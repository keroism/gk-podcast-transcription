1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,424
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday June 6 2017.

2
00:00:14,424 --> 00:00:23,678
Speaker 0: I'm rim mouse got and this is geek nights tonight talking about game controllers and game pads input devices for games.

3
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:25,677
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,443 --> 00:00:32,607
Speaker 0: So as you guys know geek nights was delayed a little bit, but Many of you probably Wario day.

5
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:33,832
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then you were sick.

6
00:00:34,294 --> 00:00:35,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was so and then you went away.

7
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:40,296
Speaker 0: Yep, so my grandfather died, which you may have seen if I posted in the forum.

8
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:41,260
Speaker 1: my grandparents left.

9
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:44,272
Speaker 0: That was my last mate like direct grandparent.

10
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:45,195
Speaker 1: I'm also down to one.

11
00:00:45,637 --> 00:00:51,145
Speaker 0: Yep, and So we thought he lived to be 88 Found out he wasn't 80.

12
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:51,306
Speaker 1: He was 87.

13
00:00:51,306 --> 00:01:02,418
Speaker 0: He was he was actually 87. and the other thing is I'll take it turns out no one in the family knew his middle name and Like everyone knew everyone knew him is eight like Jim James H, right?

14
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:05,373
Speaker 0: There was a substantial debate.

15
00:01:05,393 --> 00:01:06,420
Speaker 1: isn't there a birth certificate?

16
00:01:07,122 --> 00:01:12,180
Speaker 0: So this is what happened at the funeral someone like there's middle name and someone else was like no

17
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,522
Speaker 1: no, that's

18
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 0: not his middle name and there was a debate and no one actually knew what his middle name was and The birth certificate just said H

19
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:30,870
Speaker 1: Mysteries and I guess this is a bad joke because he had Alzheimer's but you guys you couldn't ask him either Even when he was

20
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:31,537
Speaker 0: alive, right?

21
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,846
Speaker 0: Yeah But no condolences.

22
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:34,026
Speaker 0: like.

23
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:40,607
Speaker 0: the reason I'd probably seem pretty upbeat about all this is that the dude lived like an amazing Like pretty awesome life.

24
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:42,455
Speaker 1: I'm not crying for anyone who dies 87 of an illness.

25
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:50,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially is normal especially when he was happy like I Went to see him last year.

26
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:54,464
Speaker 0: actually when does Arizona and despite the pretty advanced Alzheimer's like he was living with my mom in the Desert.

27
00:01:54,929 --> 00:01:59,712
Speaker 0: he was going out into the desert Working every day like clearing brush and taking care of the horses and

28
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:00,635
Speaker 1: he

29
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:11,211
Speaker 0: basically knew he had Alzheimer's And had lived such a full life that he was content with it and basically just living every day waiting to eventually Pass out in his sleep and he died peacefully in his sleep.

30
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:12,035
Speaker 0: And that was the end of that.

31
00:02:12,196 --> 00:02:12,617
Speaker 1: I'll take it.

32
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:25,420
Speaker 0: Yeah so, uh, it's it's funny, I guess it's fun to go to a funeral where everyone's sort of upbeat and just Remembering because it's not like this death with a shock and I'm kind of lucky that no one's really died early anywhere in my family.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,723
Speaker 0: That's affected me directly.

34
00:02:26,824 --> 00:02:32,037
Speaker 0: So all my funerals have mostly been quiet remembrances, but no more grandparents.

35
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:35,309
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Meaning, uh, let's get morbid.

36
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,756
Speaker 0: It's gonna be parents time someday.

37
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:37,539
Speaker 0: That's the next round.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:47,850
Speaker 0: But independent of that right after I found out I immediately got a stomach flu So I almost couldn't even go to the funeral.

39
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,714
Speaker 0: grandpa's ghost.

40
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:50,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was grandpa's ghost.

41
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:54,696
Speaker 1: He's like which one of my grandchildren did.

42
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:58,071
Speaker 1: I hate the most That annoying ass rim.

43
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:02,239
Speaker 1: I remember now Let me go haunt that asshole.

44
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,699
Speaker 0: He he did believe in ghosts.

45
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:14,846
Speaker 0: he also Saw a guy get shot and helped cover it up when he was young because the relatives on that side of the family were fucking mafia bootleggers Mm-hmm.

46
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,478
Speaker 0: He lived an interesting life.

47
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:20,473
Speaker 1: I'm only believing half of this cuz it's coming out of your mouth.

48
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:21,880
Speaker 0: Uh, you want to talk to my mom.

49
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,193
Speaker 0: She'll corroborate a lot of these stories Apple.

50
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:25,260
Speaker 1: Don't fall far from the tree.

51
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,927
Speaker 0: My mom though does also believe in ghosts.

52
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:28,489
Speaker 0: So watch out.

53
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,011
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

54
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,657
Speaker 0: I think most of my family believes in ghosts.

55
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:32,223
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm You did too.

56
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:33,649
Speaker 0: Yeah when I was a kid, of course, I did.

57
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,859
Speaker 1: you believed in ghosts as recently as college?

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,360
Speaker 0: I don't believe in ghosts and possibly more nonsense then but I did not believe in ghosts.

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,664
Speaker 1: You definitely believed in ghosts.

60
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:42,607
Speaker 1: you in fact told.

61
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:48,824
Speaker 1: you in fact told ghosts as if it was true to a room full of people Multiple occasions.

62
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:51,497
Speaker 0: dude, when you tell a ghost story, you gotta act like it's true.

63
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,140
Speaker 1: It was a not.

64
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:54,731
Speaker 1: This was not a Halloween ghost story situation.

65
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:57,040
Speaker 1: This was I really believe in ghosts.

66
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:02,340
Speaker 0: We were walking around the cemetery in downtown Rochester.

67
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,120
Speaker 1: No, cuz that's you're just hanging out in the apartment and you were like no I totally lived in a haunted house when I was young.

68
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,250
Speaker 0: I'll tell though you all tell all the stories on the patreon.

69
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,440
Speaker 1: then there were there bees and my brother or something.

70
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:13,266
Speaker 0: No, that was.

71
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:15,802
Speaker 0: that was not the house that as a kid I thought was haunted.

72
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:20,820
Speaker 0: the bees of my brother was just literally bees attacked him in his bedroom in New Baltimore.

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,747
Speaker 0: Anyway, we had separate bedrooms, right?

74
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,353
Speaker 0: We got separate bedroom plan.

75
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:27,140
Speaker 1: is you believed one of the houses you lived in?

76
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:28,743
Speaker 0: One?

77
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,614
Speaker 1: I want you believe that when you were old.

78
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:33,100
Speaker 0: I watched on solve mysteries.

79
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,850
Speaker 0: If you watch that show as a kid, you'll believe in ghosts.

80
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:44,771
Speaker 1: You'll think that the Mafia is literally coming to kill you Even aliens because Everywhere I did believe in aliens because of those shows.

81
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,599
Speaker 0: Oh my god, maybe high school times This will be my thing of the day on Thursday, but I'll tell you now.

82
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:55,857
Speaker 0: So I found a wiki and you know what it is every unsolved mystery whether or not they were solved.

83
00:04:56,058 --> 00:05:01,097
Speaker 0: since In detail and I went read some of them and this is like I like.

84
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:01,920
Speaker 0: this is all legit.

85
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:05,539
Speaker 0: Some of them the answers were real crazy and fucked up, too.

86
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,105
Speaker 1: How do you know that's true?

87
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:08,912
Speaker 1: and not just someone named rim was writing.

88
00:05:08,972 --> 00:05:11,000
Speaker 0: all because the ones that have answers are all like.

89
00:05:11,303 --> 00:05:19,651
Speaker 0: This person was arrested in 2011 and it was tried take trace back to the crime and then like bunch of newspapers What about America's most wanted?

90
00:05:19,671 --> 00:05:19,993
Speaker 0: I don't know.

91
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,420
Speaker 0: I only did the unsolved mysteries one.

92
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,447
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah, so we're back.

93
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,491
Speaker 0: We're doing geek nights.

94
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:26,234
Speaker 0: We're alive.

95
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:27,298
Speaker 0: Someone just said one time.

96
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:27,920
Speaker 0: I saw a ghost.

97
00:05:31,883 --> 00:05:33,584
Speaker 0: You Got any news is that Chris?

98
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,009
Speaker 0: it was not Chris.

99
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:35,732
Speaker 1: All right.

100
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:40,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the elves team You know the center of all gaming in the universe.

101
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,240
Speaker 1: They've had this thing called greenlight for a while.

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:49,020
Speaker 1: Now if you're not aware the way greenlight works is you you're making a game, but you're not a real publisher.

103
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,497
Speaker 1: You're just some people making a game some Indies or even smaller than Indy one person chopped or whatever.

104
00:05:54,537 --> 00:05:55,340
Speaker 1: Maybe you're a big deal.

105
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,750
Speaker 1: Maybe you're like kick-starting a game who knows but the point is you're making a game and you're not like Activision or some big-ass company.

106
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,660
Speaker 1: they can get your game just on steam, you know guaranteed.

107
00:06:06,222 --> 00:06:09,554
Speaker 1: So, how do you get your game on steam if steam just let all the games on there?

108
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:11,060
Speaker 1: It would just be a madhouse.

109
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,518
Speaker 0: It's already a thousand games that literally are just malware.

110
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:21,700
Speaker 1: It's already a madhouse as it is right and it's too much work for them to manually check every single goddamn submission.

111
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,486
Speaker 1: You know cuz that basically be like you could.

112
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:30,769
Speaker 1: basically their competitors could put them out of business by pumping in submissions To force them to pay to review them all.

113
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:32,255
Speaker 0: that's what uber was literally like.

114
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,999
Speaker 0: they were doing stuff like that to lift Yep but anyway.

115
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:47,660
Speaker 1: so the what they did is they have steam greenlight and the way it worked is you would put your game up on greenlight for Nothing, and then you needed to get actual steam users to steam accounts, which are relatively difficult to fake, right?

116
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,028
Speaker 1: And Have them vote for your game.

117
00:06:51,109 --> 00:07:00,160
Speaker 1: And once you got enough votes steam would be like, ah This game has some sort of community support behind it that is large enough to meet our threshold.

118
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:07,741
Speaker 1: Therefore we're going to evaluate it and see if this is good enough for real steam and that's how you would get your games on Steam.

119
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:11,295
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz you could you might say why don't they just like manually curate everything?

120
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:12,680
Speaker 0: That is way too much work.

121
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:14,787
Speaker 0: At least one automation pass.

122
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:18,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I think you also had to pay like a hundred dollar fee or something.

123
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe but whatever the point is it was an okay system, but it had some problems right.

124
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:27,916
Speaker 1: So they now have a new system.

125
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:31,633
Speaker 1: greenlight I think is as of today maybe is done and they have a new.

126
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:37,452
Speaker 1: what system called steam direct and Steam direct seems to me at least a much better system.

127
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,880
Speaker 1: Even if some people don't like it.

128
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:47,865
Speaker 1: I think that oh well too bad, right as it's you know, I come thinking about it from Valves perspective and also the gamers Perspective.

129
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:51,880
Speaker 1: I think the new system is better based on the words that have been used to describe.

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:08:00,055
Speaker 0: I think I agree, but I withhold my final judgment until I read a lot more details I mean from the indie developer perspective.

131
00:08:00,095 --> 00:08:05,179
Speaker 1: I think it may be bad Yeah, but I can't do anything about that and I don't really care about you.

132
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:12,820
Speaker 0: The indie developer situation is rough as it is like it's a hustle even without you're competing with so many people, right?

133
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,336
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, whatever.

134
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:14,700
Speaker 1: anyway.

135
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:20,020
Speaker 1: So the way the new system works is you put your game in there and you pay a hundred dollars and fill out some forms.

136
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:29,860
Speaker 1: Right, if you've never put a game on Steam before Right, they're gonna check you out to make sure you're legit for 30 days, right?

137
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,101
Speaker 1: They got.

138
00:08:30,181 --> 00:08:35,280
Speaker 1: they're gonna take 30 days to make sure that you aren't just some bullshit person trying to put up some garbage.

139
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:40,256
Speaker 1: Oh on Steam, right if they say, okay, this person's not garbage.

140
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:43,520
Speaker 1: Oh then Alright, you paid the hundred bucks your games on Steam.

141
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,817
Speaker 1: Congratulations, right if you've submitted games before you just got to pay the hundred bucks and whatever.

142
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:50,078
Speaker 1: right.

143
00:08:50,559 --> 00:09:10,070
Speaker 1: also Once you know, they find out that you are legit any games you submit and pay $100 for they're gonna review them by hand To make sure they're not malware to make sure they are what they say they are and aren't like, you know Happy ABCs after you go through the main menu is Yeah, they make sure it's actually what you say.

144
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,620
Speaker 0: it is which the game is actually just a pirated movie that plays.

145
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,660
Speaker 1: I think that could be problematic.

146
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:20,619
Speaker 1: For example the game that had fraud fractions to in it, right?

147
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,500
Speaker 1: You know, it's like what if my game is like hidden inside another game is like are they gonna really play the whole goddamn thing?

148
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,855
Speaker 1: To make there's no way they will.

149
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:37,620
Speaker 1: you Think they're gonna need some sort of tools to like scan all the files in the game to find like all the data That's you know, all the images and sound.

150
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:40,899
Speaker 0: They're gonna do a like minimal effort there.

151
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:46,877
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean at least they're checking is not malware and that actually runs doesn't crash cuz it's not malware.

152
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,222
Speaker 0: is there been a lot Important?

153
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:55,560
Speaker 1: there been a lot of problems, you know buy a game on Steam and it just crashes right away Like this bullshit and it caught and then it cost steam.

154
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,428
Speaker 1: You know money in the.

155
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:00,140
Speaker 1: they have their auto refund thing now, which takes care of that.

156
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,291
Speaker 1: But if anyone has to go to customer service, that's a problem, right?

157
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,134
Speaker 1: It cost them money.

158
00:10:04,154 --> 00:10:08,471
Speaker 1: So anyway, once your game Brings in a thousand dollars in sales.

159
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,600
Speaker 1: They give you your hundred dollars back.

160
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,774
Speaker 1: So it's like if your game doesn't really sell it's like well, why did you put?

161
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:16,140
Speaker 1: why did you bother us with this hundred?

162
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,093
Speaker 1: You know putting your game on Steam tiny ass game, you know All your game did was sell less than a thousand dollars worth, right?

163
00:10:23,113 --> 00:10:30,419
Speaker 1: We're keeping your hundred bucks as a fee Penalty to punish you for wasting our time, but putting this, you know unpopular thing on here.

164
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:34,300
Speaker 1: But once your game gets over a thousand they give you the hundred dollars back.

165
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,625
Speaker 1: So even if you know a long time goes by and your game eventually gets popular like gets discovered or something You'll get hundred dollars back.

166
00:10:41,705 --> 00:10:43,211
Speaker 1: So it's like you can you know, whatever?

167
00:10:44,356 --> 00:10:45,340
Speaker 1: and I think there's a good system.

168
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's always.

169
00:10:46,967 --> 00:10:48,112
Speaker 1: you don't like the system.

170
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:49,900
Speaker 1: you don't need to have your game on Steam.

171
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll be hard to sell because you won't get the marketing of being like on the Steam.

172
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,580
Speaker 1: You know page where people can buy it easily.

173
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:01,217
Speaker 1: But you know people like just distribute stuff on your own.

174
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:04,367
Speaker 1: you make a website You have a buy button on the website.

175
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give you money directly.

176
00:11:06,174 --> 00:11:09,530
Speaker 1: steam will not take a cut But you get a hundred percent of the money.

177
00:11:09,571 --> 00:11:11,300
Speaker 0: and Scott that's hard to do in a pain in the ass.

178
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe that's why people pay steam a hundred bucks.

179
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:16,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, also It's actually not that much of a pain in the ass.

180
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:17,919
Speaker 1: It's a way easy to do.

181
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,214
Speaker 0: Well, you see you say that but this is like an out-of-the-box thing.

182
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:24,609
Speaker 0: you and I are both ITCs professionals who do that.

183
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:27,947
Speaker 1: if you can make a video game you can make a website.

184
00:11:28,268 --> 00:11:37,120
Speaker 1: if you can't make a video game if you don't have the skills to make a website and Somehow you make a video game I can see that I can't imagine that your video game is good enough to be worth playing.

185
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,793
Speaker 1: I could see that happen as a piece of software.

186
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:40,215
Speaker 1: It would have.

187
00:11:40,235 --> 00:11:41,360
Speaker 1: it's probably garbage.

188
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:49,058
Speaker 1: If you're incapable of making a setting up a website now I guess I'm assuming that you're gonna pay services that manage all that.

189
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:52,780
Speaker 0: for you Cuz it'll be like trying to run for a mile by your arm.

190
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:56,440
Speaker 1: I did one for much less than the hundred dollar cost of the steam.

191
00:11:56,881 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 1: You can set up without having to code anything a website that will sell digital goods.

192
00:12:02,685 --> 00:12:03,289
Speaker 0: I mean ever.

193
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:10,640
Speaker 0: there's always been a complicated Discourse around steam because valve basically stopped being a game company and is just a platform.

194
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,006
Speaker 0: I don't think they'll ever make games again.

195
00:12:12,026 --> 00:12:12,427
Speaker 1: Make dota.

196
00:12:12,869 --> 00:12:14,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do they made sense?

197
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:15,400
Speaker 1: They're still making dota.

198
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,143
Speaker 1: It's a not any.

199
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,148
Speaker 1: it's a non ending game.

200
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they'll make counter-strike.

201
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:21,086
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident There will never be a half-life.

202
00:12:21,086 --> 00:12:21,327
Speaker 0: 3.

203
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:26,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably but they keep patching the games They got and they're doing a bunch of VR shit - yep.

204
00:12:26,874 --> 00:12:33,060
Speaker 1: Actually, there's a bunch of big New things coming - well the VR but the VR people left, but I think they're still doing stuff.

205
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:40,342
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of stuff coming to counter-strike that basically adds the kinds of features that overwatch started with which is interesting Mm-hmm.

206
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:45,320
Speaker 0: I think they're feeling a little bit of hurt from overwatch in the competitive circuit, but those games aren't alike at all.

207
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:45,801
Speaker 1: They're not.

208
00:12:45,861 --> 00:12:52,079
Speaker 0: but I see more and more people in like the competitive overwatch set just like the randos who?

209
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,098
Speaker 0: Mentioned say things like they used to play counter-strike, but they got bored with it.

210
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:59,155
Speaker 1: Well, you playing the goddamn thing for 17 years.

211
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,963
Speaker 0: Yeah I haven't played how to strike.

212
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:01,745
Speaker 1: the same I made.

213
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:09,999
Speaker 1: saying you're bored of counter-strike after 17 goddamn years is like saying counter-strike is the greatest game Which is close to true.

214
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:13,500
Speaker 0: I mean how long a run to tribes to head before you literally couldn't play it anymore like games.

215
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, eight months games don't last long someone.

216
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:17,660
Speaker 0: I saw an article the other day.

217
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Speaker 0: They pointed out that the fact that overwatch and it's year one anniversary is more popular than when the launch is already pretty crazy.

218
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, absolutely.

219
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:34,280
Speaker 0: I mean hearthstone fucking is like four or three four years old that So, uh, I mean in some other news that battle tech game that I still got to go.

220
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:35,780
Speaker 0: See if I actually backed or not.

221
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,684
Speaker 1: I kick-started it and the beta is now out and they let me have the beta and I haven't played it yet But I installed it.

222
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,800
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna stream it once I get home from this podcast and eat dinner.

223
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:50,178
Speaker 0: So you should in a few hours go look at Scott's YouTube channel Which I'll link to instead of listening to this as an mp3.

224
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:56,320
Speaker 1: You can't see that but you can go to my youtube and see it already uploaded like as a you know video.

225
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,207
Speaker 1: You just won't see it live.

226
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:03,956
Speaker 0: and if you go to the geek nights website www.frontrowcrew.com or just type geek nights into Google.

Speaker 0: I swear it'll get you there.

228
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:08,700
Speaker 0: You'll see a link to it because apparently no one ever does that or sees our website.

229
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,987
Speaker 0: I don't know That seems to be able to.

230
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,099
Speaker 0: our fan bases seem to be weirdly Separated trying to bring them all together and then I guess they'll fight or something.

231
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,234
Speaker 0: But I'm excited about this game, but I don't know yet.

232
00:14:21,354 --> 00:14:22,578
Speaker 0: Like I don't know if it'll be great.

Speaker 0: It might be terrible.

234
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:23,883
Speaker 0: I don't know.

235
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:27,840

00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,226
Speaker 0: Oh, they said the right words.

237

Speaker 1: They said all the right words and then I saw the game in person.

238
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,600
Speaker 1: It was at packs prime.

239
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:40,814
Speaker 1: I saw the game running in an alpha and I was like, wow That looks like they actually fucking made a game and they weren't bullshit.

295
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,914
Speaker 0: You have to buy in that two-minute gap between when Scott clicked and I clicked.

296
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:13,760
Speaker 1: so what you can do is in Twitter There's an option so that you can get notifications whenever an account tweets.

297
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:20,846
Speaker 1: So now if official packs Twitter account ever tweets anything your phone will go ding within Seconds.

298
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,400
Speaker 1: right no matter what it's guaranteed to work, right?

299
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:29,820
Speaker 1: And if you see now this might be annoying because they do tweet things other than tickets are going on sale.

300
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,177
Speaker 1: But and you'll get a mini heart attack like when last week when they tweeted our website is down.

301
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:34,397
Speaker 1: Yep.

302
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:41,240
Speaker 0: Yep Yep, but all I thought was what and I like frantically look at my watch to see what the notification was.

303
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,415
Speaker 1: Their website was just down but you know They've got it back up.

304
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:48,600
Speaker 1: So but it's okay because they do not tweet much.

305
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 1: most of their tweets are at replies to people tweeting at them with customer service stuff and you will not be notified of those.

306
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,912
Speaker 1: you will only be notified of their tweets to the world which are few in number.

307
00:17:58,932 --> 00:18:13,364
Speaker 1: and as soon as you see that on your Phone or the first internet connected device you have click that link and you'll get tickets if you're fast enough Which is if you do if you touch it when you get the notification You will be fast enough.

308
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:16,453
Speaker 0: now other packs is like especially packs East.

309
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:20,045
Speaker 0: the hotel is way more important than the badge Mm-hmm, but it West.

310
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:29,073
Speaker 0: while it is slightly annoying to not get one of the like five great hotels Even the faraway hotels are actually surprisingly close to packs like one.

311
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:32,500
Speaker 1: but the one year we had the faraway hotel was like It really said it was Blair.

312
00:18:32,681 --> 00:18:38,415
Speaker 0: Well, the problem was that that hotel was not only far away But it was far away in the wrong direction for every restaurant.

313
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:41,005
Speaker 0: We like to eat at And it was far away.

314
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:45,320
Speaker 0: Like it was like the worst possible waypoint for where tabletop was that year.

315
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,215
Speaker 1: Yes, the northern western hotels are good.

316
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:51,900
Speaker 0: the south eastern Yeah, that's the best possible hotel is the Sheraton.

317
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,295
Speaker 0: But my advice to you is to not go for it because it's probably already sold out.

318
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 1: It's also too much money.

319
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,768
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it.

320
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,700
Speaker 1: none of them are super cheap, but it's more money.

321
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:05,795
Speaker 0: but if you go for the Sheraton You'll likely fail and by the time you look at like the Olivette or something.

322
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:07,099
Speaker 0: It'll be sold out.

323
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:08,949
Speaker 1: It's a good option.

324
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,359
Speaker 1: There's plenty of good options.

325
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:14,126
Speaker 0: So be warned be prepared.

326
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:19,142
Speaker 0: even though we've been a speaker at every single packs with free badges since 2008.

327
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:21,852
Speaker 0: I'm so paranoid that I buy badges every year because I will not.

328
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:22,755
Speaker 0: I will and I know.

329
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:23,860
Speaker 1: I know I can sell them.

330
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:26,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would give them away to a friend.

331
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:35,420
Speaker 0: I think I'm just gonna buy one this year plus if you have a bunch of friends if you all agree to buy the maximum number Usually only a few of you will get in and you can help your friends go to pass.

332
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,579
Speaker 1: Are you telling me I should buy the maximum instead of one maybe two?

333
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,062
Speaker 0: I don't know.

334
00:19:39,082 --> 00:19:41,820
Speaker 1: It's always a pain in the ass to sell past and I've bought too many.

335
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,167
Speaker 1: I've had to sell them and it's annoying.

336
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:48,140
Speaker 0: so there's another secret that you can do But this is this is the money or game dev option.

337
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:52,114
Speaker 0: I go to PAX dev every year and I've only gotten a free badge.

338
00:19:52,174 --> 00:19:55,879
Speaker 0: by speaking once I kept going because I really like PAX dev.

339
00:19:55,899 --> 00:20:09,300
Speaker 0: and What many people don't know if you buy a badge to pack stuff which ain't cheap it's like 300 plus dollars Ching you have the automatic right to buy a four-day badge to PAX West even if it is sold out.

340
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,006
Speaker 0: You can just buy a badge.

341
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:19,026
Speaker 0: So actually I could just buy my dev badge now and buy one West badge now.

342
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:20,150
Speaker 0: I could do this literally today.

343
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:21,315
Speaker 1: I also get the hotel room.

344
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:24,294
Speaker 0: I don't know I've never tried that because that's what we need.

345
00:20:24,314 --> 00:20:24,960
Speaker 1: get the hotel room.

346
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:25,684
Speaker 0: I will try.

347
00:20:25,764 --> 00:20:34,678
Speaker 0: I will see if I can get the hotel room when I booked my PAX dev Tonight and I will let you all know if that works Because that would actually save me a lot of headache if I could get the hotel now.

348
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:44,320
Speaker 0: so, uh You might have noticed and this is my main news that There's another PAX website PAX unplugged and we're going to it.

349
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:53,560
Speaker 0: it's gonna be awesome and we've talked about it, but there's yet another PAX website and Most people only stumbled onto this by accident.

350
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,420
Speaker 1: It was in the new gaming news, you don't read gaming news.

351
00:20:56,702 --> 00:21:02,539
Speaker 0: So I saw it in some gaming news But now I found there's a much better article that explains what's going on here on polygon.

352
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:13,700
Speaker 0: But there's a powered by Pax running on the same infrastructure as although like PAX website stuff because all the paxes have the same back end It's not as sophisticated as you think it is, but it does exist.

353
00:21:15,421 --> 00:21:36,579
Speaker 0: There is a pax or at least a convention that is powered by all the infrastructure of pax in Guangzhou in China in November of this year November 10th, that's like right after pax Australia, I think This is not a normal pax in that as far as I can tell like Dave and Taika are not gonna be there.

354
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:40,703
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's gonna be in English or in Chinese.

355
00:21:41,064 --> 00:21:42,248
Speaker 0: I assume it'll be in Chinese.

356
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:57,513
Speaker 0: the fascinating thing about this is that this is a great way I think for them to monetize The infrastructure of running a pax because there is big money in running gaming conventions But - it allows them to do that without diluting the pax brand.

357
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:02,040
Speaker 0: because if you had more like legit paxes There's only so much gave in taiko.

358
00:22:02,622 --> 00:22:07,235
Speaker 0: There's only so much like US games industry or Australian games industry.

359
00:22:07,556 --> 00:22:15,839
Speaker 0: It would get watered down in a hurry But in most of the world there are very few or no gamer focused gaming conventions.

360
00:22:16,743 --> 00:22:24,325
Speaker 0: Most of them are industry focused or Competitive gaming audience focused But they're not People who play games.

361
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:24,766
Speaker 0: focus.

362
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:29,563
Speaker 0: pax and magfest are unique and that they're the rare ones that are like that and the rest of the world Those don't exist.

363
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:32,214
Speaker 0: So I'm really interested to see how this goes.

364
00:22:32,254 --> 00:22:33,218
Speaker 0: pretty sure those exist.

365
00:22:33,238 --> 00:22:36,297
Speaker 0: games come But there are not that many.

366
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:47,009
Speaker 0: compared to like comic cons and other kinds of things a lot of the things that people talk about as gaming cons are more industry focused and Less like random Joe gamer on the street focused.

367
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:47,711
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

368
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:49,556
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna like do an article here.

369
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,780
Speaker 0: You can read about more of the details.

370
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:55,280
Speaker 0: Kind of want to go just to see what the deal is cuz I'll be in Singapore around that time.

371
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,224
Speaker 0: Anyway need a visa.

372
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:58,552
Speaker 0: I can get a visa to Guangzhou.

373
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,419
Speaker 0: Guangzhou was pretty easy to get a visa to.

374
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:01,867
Speaker 1: I know I'm just saying you got to do it.

375
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,400
Speaker 0: It's like getting a visa to I don't know a Shenzhen those areas.

376
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:07,498
Speaker 1: It's not as easy as getting one to Australia where you click a button and pay 20 bucks.

377
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz that's not actually a visa.

378
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:10,300
Speaker 0: That's an electronic.

379
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a passport.

380
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:19,507
Speaker 1: it has the same function regardless of what name is applied to it, right but I There is a small chance.

381
00:23:19,568 --> 00:23:24,668
Speaker 0: I might just buy a badge and go to this for a day Just to see go for it cuz I like.

382
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,052
Speaker 0: I'm literally gonna be in the area.

383
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,216
Speaker 1: Anyway, it doesn't.

384
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:28,180
Speaker 1: it doesn't count as a pecs.

385
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,278
Speaker 0: No, it does not because it is powered by packs.

386
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:48,206
Speaker 0: This is extra interesting too because penny arcade Needs a made like long-term Monetization plan to continue to do the things that it does because frankly gaming conventions make a lot of money But they're also especially packs is?

387
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:56,493
Speaker 0: there's also a little bit of an industry fueled gravy train and much like the heyday of the anime Industry can't say that might last forever.

388
00:23:56,654 --> 00:23:59,304
Speaker 0: or my Peter out Gotta have backup plans.

389
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,972
Speaker 1: I'm curious what services they actually provide.

390
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:09,680
Speaker 1: I'm also curious how much they charge Yeah, and I'm curious like how much if it's not called packs it was just powered by packs.

391
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:22,392
Speaker 1: I'm curious how much that brand helps in the non english-speaking world Where it doesn't seem to have as much value really, but I do get It is really popular in a surprising.

392
00:24:22,553 --> 00:24:24,559
Speaker 1: if these conventions fail while they fail, right?

393
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if they succeed if I'm if I run.

394
00:24:28,195 --> 00:24:29,320
Speaker 1: was it called GZ play?

395
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I'm the people running GZ play I'm sure I have some sort of contract with packs that lasts more than one year.

396
00:24:35,582 --> 00:24:43,360
Speaker 1: But if my convention is successful and I learn from packs what I need to learn I'm not renewing that contract and giving them any more money.

397
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,634
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna keep running this GZ play on my own in my experience.

398
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:51,900
Speaker 0: However, I Find that almost no one is capable of doing that.

399
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,475
Speaker 0: You know of having seen someone I mean look at the conventions that read runs that aren't packs.

400
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:02,991
Speaker 0: I Mean, I'm just saying that's just saying they're part of.

401
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:11,820
Speaker 1: that is not because of you know, they're incapable, but they're Managerial decisions that you know might be overridden.

402
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:17,520
Speaker 0: Well that that is the magic of packs that makes them so unique and why I'm curious how this will go down is that?

403
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:29,046
Speaker 0: packs and magfest is like one of the few that's like this is so hyper focused on the experience of the average attendee as Company would care about when they run.

404
00:25:29,066 --> 00:25:30,090
Speaker 1: Okay milk more money.

405
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,615
Speaker 1: I know let's sell VIP badges.

406
00:25:31,635 --> 00:25:32,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, make us more money.

407
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,163
Speaker 0: Yeah What do we have?

408
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:39,740
Speaker 0: a complex bidding process where badges are very expensive and slowly get cheaper to get maximum money out of these?

409
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,140
Speaker 1: Rubes, what if we have some expensive exclusive swag that we give out to people who spend more money?

410
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:48,679
Speaker 0: What if you have to pay individual money for every game you want to play?

411
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:55,019
Speaker 0: What if panelists have to pay to get a projector in their panel room?

412
00:25:56,341 --> 00:26:12,350
Speaker 0: And for those of you who only go to PAX is literally all of those things happen routinely at other gaming cons But anyway things of the day.

413
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:29,418
Speaker 0: So there was a story that no one believed in the 1830s when some pirates Well, some convicts were on their way to the prison camps in Australia Hijacked the ship they were on Mutiny and sailed off for adventure.

414
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:45,020
Speaker 0: and when they eventually got caught again and were on trial for piracy in London Yeah one they were the last human beings on earth hung by the British crown for piracy Mm-hmm, and two they told a crazy story of getting attacked by samurai.

415
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,336
Speaker 0: and No one believed that.

416
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:48,099
Speaker 1: but it was true.

417
00:26:48,882 --> 00:26:50,750
Speaker 0: some evidence was uncovered.

418
00:26:51,252 --> 00:26:54,623
Speaker 0: Recently like really recently didn't have cannons headed.

419
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,506
Speaker 1: samurai messed them up.

420
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,008
Speaker 0: Uh So it's really funny the story.

421
00:27:00,271 --> 00:27:02,718
Speaker 0: So basically their story was pretty dumb.

422
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:03,421
Speaker 0: What year was this?

423
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:03,822
Speaker 0: 1830?

424
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:06,911
Speaker 1: You could definitely mess samurai up with cannons in 1830.

425
00:27:06,911 --> 00:27:12,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I like these coastal towns in Japan often had like one or two cannons.

426
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:19,410
Speaker 1: Yeah But they were like basically that orders from couldn't have been as good as the ones on the boat.

427
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:20,437
Speaker 0: No, no, no that one.

428
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:23,850
Speaker 0: usually they were stolen from boats or like Foreigners they'd murdered.

429
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:34,926
Speaker 0: Yeah So the I guess this town had like one raggedy-ass cannonball and they shot it at the barbarian ship And they hit it and they hit it.

430
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:35,370
Speaker 0: good job.

431
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:40,169
Speaker 0: And they actually knocked the telescope out of one of the guys hands and hurt him.

432
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:45,309
Speaker 0: And this like pitted ass lead ball was like on the ship and they kept it as a souvenir.

433
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaker 1: There's all this nonsense, but basically I just like went through the hall and landed on the floor.

434
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,791
Speaker 1: I don't even

435
00:27:49,811 --> 00:27:52,902
Speaker 0: went to the hall because the Japanese in that era was

436
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:53,825
Speaker 1: landed on the deck like

437
00:27:53,986 --> 00:28:07,265
Speaker 0: it landed on the deck like bonk And apparently the samurai were extra fucking pissed off about the fact that when they fired their cannon the pirate ship There's a quote in here, but do but

438
00:28:07,405 --> 00:28:07,808
Speaker 1: do but do.

439
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,030
Speaker 0: No, it didn't even bother.

440
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:17,660
Speaker 0: It's just very slowly and leisurely raised a sail and just kind of slowly Got out of the water.

441
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:18,789
Speaker 0: It was no big deal.

442
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,216
Speaker 0: The pirates basically showed up.

443
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:22,360
Speaker 1: Thanks to the free cannonball.

444
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we're like, we'll leave soon.

445
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,786
Speaker 0: We just let us like hang out here and like repaint our ship so we can like get away from the British.

446
00:28:30,468 --> 00:28:33,137
Speaker 0: and the samurai Were like, yeah, we have pointy swords.

447
00:28:33,157 --> 00:28:34,702
Speaker 1: We don't get to use them often enough.

448
00:28:34,923 --> 00:28:36,668
Speaker 1: We also really want to fire this cannon.

449
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:40,520
Speaker 1: That's how I would be if I was that samurai.

450
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,412
Speaker 0: so basically this French scholar like translated.

451
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:55,087
Speaker 0: they found all these accounts from samurai in the 1830s of An encounter with barbarians and They translated it and they put one in like two and two together and they figured it out that this.

452
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,749
Speaker 0: and then they like they Went and like found the records from London.

453
00:28:58,231 --> 00:29:05,952
Speaker 0: They are really confident that these are the exact pirates that they ran into and the Japanese even drew pictures of what the pirates looked Like.

454
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,089
Speaker 0: oh, they're reasonably accurate.

455
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:11,563
Speaker 0: The crowd the samurai chronicles are pretty funny.

456
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:19,270
Speaker 0: one sailor Bared his chest to the disguised samurai to reveal a tattoo of quote the upper body of a beautiful woman.

457
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:25,010
Speaker 0: Another produced a big glass of what appeared to be an alcoholic beverage and indicated that we should drink.

458
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,660
Speaker 0: We declined by waving our hands upon which they pass the glass around themselves.

459
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:38,127
Speaker 0: So this is just a fascinating story such excellent gentleman and I don't know.

460
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:45,150
Speaker 0: it shows that There's a lot of history that we actually have evidence of and just no one bothered doing the research you're putting it together.

461
00:29:45,331 --> 00:29:47,660
Speaker 1: Well, cuz it's not like this isn't world affecting history?

462
00:29:47,721 --> 00:29:49,970
Speaker 1: whether this happened or not doesn't have any you know.

463
00:29:50,151 --> 00:29:50,592
Speaker 1: Remember

464
00:29:50,612 --> 00:30:07,033
Speaker 0: while I read that the same thing happened with the Battle of Midway the turning point of World War two in the Pacific where apparently no one in America ever bothered to actually like Translate and read Japanese accounts of the battle because those Japanese accounts actually proved a whole bunch of stuff about the battle that we were Wrong about.

465
00:30:07,113 --> 00:30:08,597
Speaker 1: but winners write the history.

466
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:12,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we wrote the history dumb and wrong and we win though.

467
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,384
Speaker 1: Yeah It doesn't mean you winners write the history, right?

468
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:17,068
Speaker 1: You just write it.

469
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:26,732
Speaker 0: Yep, but a lot of the things we were wrong about like we way overestimated Japanese capabilities during that battle and Japanese primary sources gave a very different picture Mm-hmm.

470
00:30:27,134 --> 00:30:29,748
Speaker 0: So anyway, this is just a funny story that I think you should read.

471
00:30:30,692 --> 00:30:33,161
Speaker 0: All I could think the whole time was Harris and impact.

472
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:34,265
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much.

473
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:35,690
Speaker 0: So I got a thing of the day.

474
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this has been.

475
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:40,707
Speaker 1: this has been like all over the Internet's and the main the real news of.

476
00:30:40,908 --> 00:30:47,152
Speaker 1: a lot of people have Probably seen this but also a lot of people are nerds who listen to this the kind of nerds who are so sad they'd sit In our chat.

477
00:30:47,434 --> 00:30:51,110
Speaker 0: you call it sports ball and you make fun of it when other people talk about it, right?

478
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,700
Speaker 1: So the New York Metropolitan's?

479
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,825
Speaker 1: they not to do it so good.

480
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:56,090
Speaker 1: They back to their old ways.

481
00:30:56,211 --> 00:31:00,312
Speaker 1: They were in the World Series just two years ago and they didn't win it Now.

482
00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:06,370
Speaker 1: the back to being el garbage Mets as usual and at a recent technical New York tour for that is bums.

483
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:12,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, so about a week ago ish if you know They were sucking particularly badly.

484
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:16,249
Speaker 1: I think it maybe it'd been like Wednesday or Tuesday last week.

485
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:24,269
Speaker 1: Particular suckage was going on at Citi Field and Some of the fans is nothing better to do because there was nothing to see on the field.

486
00:31:25,073 --> 00:31:26,278
Speaker 1: They were heckling the mascot.

487
00:31:26,298 --> 00:31:26,519
Speaker 1: Mr.

488
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,744
Speaker 1: Met heckle heckle.

489
00:31:27,905 --> 00:31:28,588
Speaker 0: No, you never see mr.

490
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:31,057
Speaker 0: Matt It's a man in a mess.

491
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:32,623
Speaker 1: It's a beautiful person.

492
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:34,290
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of different people who are in.

493
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,660
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we don't even know who's in there.

494
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:36,466
Speaker 0: It is a person.

495
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,073
Speaker 0: Sir name is mr.

496
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:41,621
Speaker 0: So I'm assuming that their character is canonically male.

497
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:42,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is a mrs.

498
00:31:42,845 --> 00:31:43,066
Speaker 1: Met.

499
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:43,688
Speaker 0: there is.

500
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,631
Speaker 0: I've never seen mrs Matt.

501
00:31:44,952 --> 00:31:45,674
Speaker 1: it looks like mr.

502
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:47,079
Speaker 1: Matt with ponytail cuz.

503
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,829
Speaker 0: I guess there's not a lot of sexual dimorphism in baseballs.

504
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,026
Speaker 0: No, because his head is just a baseball with a mess hat.

505
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:57,823
Speaker 1: Yep Any has four fingers, yeah, mrs.

506
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,329
Speaker 1: Matt has boobs and a ponytail.

507
00:32:02,332 --> 00:32:06,690
Speaker 0: They felt the need to like super gender that literal baseball, yeah anyway.

508
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,588
Speaker 1: So they were heckling mr.

509
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:23,729
Speaker 1: Matt big time and On his way back into the underground of the field from possibly doing like a t-shirt toss or something like that They were giving him a good old heckle while videoing him with their little phone camera.

510
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:24,994
Speaker 1: And mr.

511
00:32:25,014 --> 00:32:33,501
Speaker 1: Matt, whoever was in there that day wasn't having wasn't having none of it and gave him the finger Which is really funny because a that's a New York thing to do.

512
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:33,562
Speaker 1: Mr.

513
00:32:33,602 --> 00:32:35,428
Speaker 1: Matt should be giving people the finger and be.

514
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:37,349
Speaker 1: mr Matt only has four fingers.

515
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:39,876
Speaker 0: So he was just pointing up.

516
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:42,629
Speaker 1: I guess sure so but I mean he also did you know the old.

517
00:32:45,592 --> 00:32:53,086
Speaker 1: So that so they have told us that that mr Has been relieved of their duties and will no longer be in the costume, but they could just be lying.

518
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, it don't matter I hope they are lying.

519
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,182
Speaker 1: I would you know would promote that mr.

520
00:32:58,202 --> 00:32:58,402
Speaker 1: Matt.

521
00:32:58,924 --> 00:32:59,105
Speaker 0: Yep.

522
00:32:59,185 --> 00:32:59,907
Speaker 0: I would give that mr.

523
00:32:59,947 --> 00:33:06,087
Speaker 0: Matt a bonus Yeah, and or properly demonstrating to New Yorkers what happens when you heckle mr.

524
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:06,348
Speaker 0: Matt.

525
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:06,649
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

526
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,439
Speaker 1: But anyway, here's the video of mr.

527
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:12,130
Speaker 1: Matt giving someone the second or third finger.

528
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,599
Speaker 0: You Know it's funny.

529
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,697
Speaker 0: living here long enough Like this isn't some like?

530
00:33:16,818 --> 00:33:17,803
Speaker 1: I just want people to know.

531
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:24,811
Speaker 1: like the first time I saw this I thought it was like a fan-made thing and not a real thing, you know, cuz like if a car like this is a real thing That's the actual mr Matt.

532
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:30,876
Speaker 0: like if I'm biking or walking in a car honks at me and I'm not like I'm not jaywalking or anything Like I flip them off as instinct.

533
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,706
Speaker 0: I literally don't even think it just have it's just out the fingers.

534
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:35,010
Speaker 1: It's subconsciously controlled.

535
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:39,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's such a such an instinct and it doesn't even feel like anything.

536
00:33:39,426 --> 00:33:41,476
Speaker 0: It's no emotion to it It's just like a hello.

537
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:43,229
Speaker 0: No wave gentle wave.

538
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:47,579
Speaker 0: Not only thing today but in the meta moment.

539
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,064
Speaker 0: the booklet book is Frank Herbert's Dune.

540
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:50,870
Speaker 0: I began in a while ago.

00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,734
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it soon.

542
00:33:51,754 --> 00:33:53,060
Speaker 0: I guess you're gonna read it.

00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:55,390
Speaker 1: I guess I'll start reading it.

545
00:33:55,672 --> 00:34:01,064
Speaker 0: I also start reading it but We're so excited about this in some other more interesting.

546
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,190
Speaker 1: I didn't like it the last time.

547
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:02,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't finish.

548
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:05,120
Speaker 0: you might have noticed that I keep uploading all these.

549
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:06,425
Speaker 1: you do 90 something.

550
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:20,438
Speaker 0: I got about 109 more of these to upload as I make them but I'm taking literally every tabletop review We've ever done in the middle of a geek nights episode and splitting them out into their own Separate dedicated YouTube videos.

551
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,105
Speaker 0: that are just the review.

552
00:34:22,125 --> 00:34:26,522
Speaker 0: not all that crap We talked about before the review some of these that we had to have a show.

553
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:28,610
Speaker 0: we did like five board game reviews.

554
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:35,208
Speaker 0: So I cut each one out into its own thing and there's a playlist you can click on and just watch all the reviews with none of the crap.

555
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:40,790
Speaker 0: Mmm, uh, I think this is a decent thing to do and I planted this more geek nights things in the future.

556
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,170
Speaker 0: I got a nice pipeline going on, but I don't know like and subscribe.

557
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:47,081
Speaker 1: I'm doing lots of video action in terms of like.

558
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:51,869
Speaker 1: I can now stream from my phone Immediately with the YouTube app because I have a thousand subscribers.

559
00:34:51,889 --> 00:35:04,049
Speaker 1: Yep I did it during your brother's wedding a live stream your toast because it was a good toast great And then I'm using that feature whenever I feel like it And I'm streaming more stuff from my house mostly video games because that's easier to do.

560
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:12,929
Speaker 1: But I have the technology and equipment to stream pretty much anything in my apartment whatsoever Not just video game, but anything happening in real life.

561
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:17,176
Speaker 1: so Give me ideas and whatnot.

562
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:18,279
Speaker 1: I've done some cooking.

563
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,526
Speaker 1: I've done some Gundam model building.

564
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:21,949

567
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:29,630
Speaker 0: that could be interesting.

568
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:34,470
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's gonna work with the internet quality Changing as I bike around.

569
00:35:34,677 --> 00:35:35,732
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz it was.

570
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:39,926
Speaker 0: the internet quality was pretty dodgy in that wedding venue too and the stream did not come out.

571
00:35:39,986 --> 00:35:41,110
Speaker 0: super great quality wise.

572
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:42,334

581
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:06,969
Speaker 1: It takes you to finish it.

582
00:36:07,472 --> 00:36:13,159
Speaker 0: So it'll be interesting though because while Phil is super athletic He does not run long distances all the time.

583
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,210
Speaker 1: Like I do but it's only 5k is it's not long distance.

584
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:26,039
Speaker 0: It's considered long distance running now, but uh while I'd normally train Like like six or seven five K's in a marathon Yeah, marathons like 26 miles.

585
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:28,169
Speaker 0: I don't run marathons because that's super bad for you.

586
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:36,937
Speaker 0: I run half marathons regularly, but I'm also old and like 35 is younger than you.

587
00:36:37,037 --> 00:36:41,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, 35 ain't 31 guys It's 39 ain't 29.

588
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:51,726
Speaker 0: Yep, but I'm 35 and I think my peak like the best times I ever got running these races was like 28 through 31 and then it's gonna be.

589
00:36:53,272 --> 00:36:56,844
Speaker 0: I'm lucky to even like make those half hour to run five K's.

590
00:36:56,984 --> 00:36:57,165
Speaker 1: What?

591
00:36:57,225 --> 00:36:58,188
Speaker 0: No, I've got 20 minutes.

592
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:08,839
Speaker 0: Okay, no my dad I usually place in the top three of my age group and as I get into older age groups I feel like I'll do better and better.

593
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:17,215
Speaker 0: I think I'm aging better than a lot of the people I see But me the last time I remember Emily got screwed because she was the oldest.

594
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:27,210
Speaker 0: she was the oldest person in her age group and she was like one place away from like placing like in the top and The times for the people in the age group one step above here were way slower.

595
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,809
Speaker 0: She would in first place in that age group.

596
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:37,401
Speaker 0: So the next year she was in that age group and all these super freakin fast people were in that age group And she would have been first place in the younger age group.

597
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:39,128
Speaker 0: So who runs the race?

598
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:42,061
Speaker 1: Yep There's always like 20. that's how it is the net writer tournament.

599
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:51,730
Speaker 0: I won when the good people didn't show up Yep, and then the super good people they're all like 19 to 22 years old and they beat me by like five minutes.

600
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:54,535
Speaker 0: They started the front.

601
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:55,298
Speaker 0: they they beat.

602
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:57,166
Speaker 0: they finished the thing in like 18 minutes 17 minutes.

603
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:00,568
Speaker 1: So you catch them?

604
00:38:01,751 --> 00:38:03,218
Speaker 0: So the last try real hard.

605
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:11,397
Speaker 0: the last time I said the best time I ever got I did it because I ran real hard and I ran over the finish line and Immediately just vomited in some bushes.

606
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,790
Speaker 1: Well, I'm pretty sure the prison who finished in 18 minutes also vomited in.

607
00:38:16,512 --> 00:38:18,729
Speaker 0: They're just younger and fitter than me I think is the problem.

608
00:38:20,072 --> 00:38:20,716
Speaker 1: I'll run the race.

609
00:38:20,837 --> 00:38:21,299
Speaker 1: I'm a bike.

610
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:22,648
Speaker 1: I'll finish in 18 minutes.

611
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,090
Speaker 1: In fact, I'll give you a 10-minute handicap.

612
00:38:28,112 --> 00:38:29,289
Speaker 0: You give me a 10-minute handicap.

613
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:34,870
Speaker 1: I might be able to do okay 5k on a closed course on my bike trying to go fast.

614
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:38,502
Speaker 1: No, I could probably go close to 20 miles an hour.

615
00:38:38,522 --> 00:38:40,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's Prospect Park too.

616
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:40,830
Speaker 0: So it's like easy.

617
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:42,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, 20 miles an hour.

618
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,081
Speaker 1: How long will it take to go?

619
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:46,290
Speaker 1: five K's not long Five minutes.

620
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:51,069
Speaker 0: I couldn't find a show where we specifically talked about this.

621
00:38:51,892 --> 00:38:52,554
Speaker 0: I think we've talked.

622
00:38:52,635 --> 00:39:01,830
Speaker 0: I think we might have talked once about like first party and why you should always get first party stuff But like I couldn't find shows on like just game controllers.

623
00:39:03,211 --> 00:39:06,550
Speaker 1: Seems weird, but I know well, it's such a broad topic.

624
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,220
Speaker 1: I don't even know what you think we're gonna talk about.

625
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,970
Speaker 0: I search like gamepad and everything.

626
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:10,893
Speaker 1: Why don't we are?

627
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:11,776
Speaker 1: here's how we should live.

628
00:39:11,957 --> 00:39:14,084
Speaker 1: there's many ways we could limit this right?

629
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:25,000
Speaker 1: Let's talk about specific Game controllers ones that exist and review them in the if you the pre-analog era The super NES controller.

630
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:25,422
Speaker 1: Let's go.

631
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:33,587
Speaker 0: historically is to this day I think the best console or console game or generic game pad the world has ever seen.

632
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:34,770
Speaker 0: but again pre analog.

633
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:38,883
Speaker 0: Maybe anyway name a better pre analog controller.

634
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:39,927
Speaker 1: Oh pre analog.

635
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:43,259
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz the NES controller doesn't have enough buttons.

636
00:39:43,499 --> 00:39:44,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it's too small.

637
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:45,185
Speaker 1: Why not?

638
00:39:45,446 --> 00:39:46,590
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah.

639
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,382
Speaker 1: So let's just start at the beginning right with the arcade.

640
00:39:49,803 --> 00:39:51,430
Speaker 1: right people don't know.

641
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:54,604
Speaker 1: Right arcade sticks are not all the same.

642
00:39:55,107 --> 00:40:04,090
Speaker 1: in Japan They have a square gate and in the US they have the sort of gate That's like the gate is the thing that controls the range of motion of the stick.

643
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,119
Speaker 0: All right, if you go get before that there wasn't even standards.

644
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:08,564
Speaker 0: and like what is a control?

645
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:10,510
Speaker 0: like the idea of a stick with?

646
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,376
Speaker 0: Directions wasn't like people.

647
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,347
Speaker 1: Yeah asteroids has buttons only it doesn't have a stick.

648
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:18,309
Speaker 1: Yeah Some games have a ball.

649
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:25,193
Speaker 0: There was like no standard like you'd see crazy buttons all over the place on different arcade games Took a long time.

650
00:40:25,213 --> 00:40:32,850
Speaker 0: like it really wasn't until home consoles that controllers standardized Because you needed one controller to run multiple games.

651
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,241
Speaker 1: There weren't even game pads until the NES slash Famicom.

652
00:40:36,281 --> 00:40:40,738
Speaker 1: before then it was like joysticks or you know Things with a bunch of buttons on them.

653
00:40:40,798 --> 00:40:43,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at like a little tiny joy stick.

654
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,395
Speaker 1: Some things had a big joystick.

655
00:40:44,415 --> 00:40:45,680
Speaker 1: you gripped it your whole hand.

656
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:51,635
Speaker 0: Look at Atari game controllers you had With a button on it.

657
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:56,026
Speaker 0: the Intellivision was a number pad and a flat disc.

658
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,650
Speaker 0: you could like shove down.

659
00:40:58,272 --> 00:40:59,937
Speaker 0: That actually had like like.

660
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,308
Speaker 0: it was almost like a. I don't ever seen anything like it.

661
00:41:03,649 --> 00:41:07,890
Speaker 1: Yeah No, I think maybe the NES max was somewhat similar to the disc.

662
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

663
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:21,290
Speaker 1: but anyway all of those things that came before the NES gamepad were except for arcade normal Arcade stick and buttons was good because arcade stick and buttons The controls is still good today.

664
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,575
Speaker 0: but you made a game.

665
00:41:22,655 --> 00:41:24,643
Speaker 0: the controls were literally part of the game.

666
00:41:24,683 --> 00:41:30,767
Speaker 0: as soon as you had a console you had to have one Controller or a set of controllers for all possible games.

667
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:31,390
Speaker 1: That's true.

668
00:41:31,832 --> 00:41:37,251
Speaker 1: So the really the Famicom controller for the NES the original one a B select start up down left Right.

669
00:41:37,532 --> 00:41:41,527
Speaker 1: the pad was the invention of the d-pad, which is still necessary today.

670
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:55,603
Speaker 0: Yeah, and It is terrific controller, but all third-party ones garbage in my yeah, I remember as a kid it was a very like specific differentiator of It's sad to say this but like socio-economic class in that.

671
00:41:55,684 --> 00:42:00,555
Speaker 1: and this applies also to other third-party controllers for all systems.

672
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:05,608
Speaker 0: up until today even middle-class kids in my neighborhood all had like just first-party standard controllers.

673
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:09,910
Speaker 0: the Yuppie kids all had the weird like Nintendo controllers.

674
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,151
Speaker 0: I know.

675
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:19,309
Speaker 1: I noticed that even kids who had you know were affluent they would still only have enough You know main game pads for themselves, right?

676
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:20,873
Speaker 1: No, and they would just buy.

677
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:26,230
Speaker 1: they get the cheapo madcads garbage controllers, you know for anyone who might be visiting.

678
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,217
Speaker 1: But they never use those.

679
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:32,965
Speaker 0: most of those kids in my experience They always had the special controllers that turbo buttons and nonsense on them.

680
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:33,286
Speaker 0: to cheat.

681
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:38,159
Speaker 0: some people did that They'd make me use the first-party regular old controller that didn't have the turbos.

682
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:41,397
Speaker 1: there were First party controllers that had nonsense.

683
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:42,421
Speaker 1: is the NES advantage.

684
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:46,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, which all the yuppie kids had which sucks, by the way It's it's garbage.

685
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:51,430
Speaker 1: I there's the NES max which I had which not so great, but it was okay.

686
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:53,118
Speaker 1: It wasn't as bad as it is now.

687
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:53,641
Speaker 1: You don't want it.

688
00:42:53,661 --> 00:42:55,389
Speaker 1: All right, but it's a thing.

689
00:42:56,414 --> 00:43:04,307
Speaker 1: I think there was also one that was just the same exact thing as the regular controller But just had two turbos added to it, but that might have been third party or first party.

690
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:11,970
Speaker 0: I remember yup But yeah, but actually in that era all the other consoles that were contemporary the controllers are pretty garbage.

691
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:20,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, no any all the other consoles that tried to compete with the NES even the ones that copied game pads from them Like I think there were game pads for.

692
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,330
Speaker 1: like Commodore 64, maybe Turbografx-16 had a gamepad and it was a gamepad.

693
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:31,205
Speaker 1: It wasn't awful, but it wasn't even as good as the NES one that came before it.

694
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:32,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was worse than it.

695
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,974
Speaker 1: It's like what you do now.

696
00:43:35,017 --> 00:43:36,381
Speaker 0: I don't know how you all feel about this.

697
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:44,606
Speaker 0: The Sega Genesis controller would have been Marginally acceptable if it weren't for the fact that it was contemporary to the SNES controller.

698
00:43:44,646 --> 00:43:45,850
Speaker 0: the god of controllers.

699
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Genesis controller the first one, right?

700
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,894
Speaker 1: Had three buttons ABC.

701
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:51,416
Speaker 1: It's fine.

702
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:52,238
Speaker 1: Start button good.

703
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:54,746
Speaker 1: The main problem with the original Genesis controller.

704
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:55,710
Speaker 1: Is this too big?

705
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:02,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a monster and there's people today are like so many people not just with controllers with phones and stuff.

706
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,997
Speaker 1: They're like, oh my god, my hands are too big.

707
00:44:04,057 --> 00:44:05,022
Speaker 1: My hands are too small.

708
00:44:05,363 --> 00:44:06,026
Speaker 1: I can't grip.

709
00:44:06,147 --> 00:44:07,171
Speaker 1: Oh, it's - you know It's like.

710
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:10,161
Speaker 1: no these things are made one size fits all.

711
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,207
Speaker 1: they're pretty much one size fits all.

712
00:44:12,267 --> 00:44:21,564
Speaker 1: if you have a problem It's not a problem with the size of your - barring of course accessibility concerns - unless you are not Andre the Giant You are not Shaquille O'Neal, right?

713
00:44:21,805 --> 00:44:22,890
Speaker 1: You are not Tom Thumb.

714
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:28,170
Speaker 1: Your hand is the right size for pretty much any normal controller.

715
00:44:28,311 --> 00:44:36,550
Speaker 0: In my experience most people who don't have like a disability or a reason why they can't use a normal controller Their problems stem from the fact that they held the controllers wrong.

716
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,375
Speaker 0: Yep, they use them wrong.

717
00:44:38,415 --> 00:44:40,542
Speaker 0: They gripped him in like crazy death grips.

718
00:44:41,204 --> 00:44:42,087
Speaker 0: I just I saw.

719
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:43,070
Speaker 1: I saw people.

720
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:46,246
Speaker 0: I saw kids would hold their NES controllers like from the bottom only.

721
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:50,130
Speaker 1: like recently I've seen people who are not proficient with controller, right?

722
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,129
Speaker 1: They'd have their left.

723
00:44:51,431 --> 00:45:01,429
Speaker 1: You know left thumb on the left analog and right thumb on the buttons and then to use the right analog They were bringing over the left thumb to the right analog and back.

724
00:45:02,711 --> 00:45:07,030
Speaker 0: That's like watching a top touch type is always going for left shift because they don't really know that the right ones there.

725
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:07,914
Speaker 1: I know that.

726
00:45:08,115 --> 00:45:08,275
Speaker 1: that's.

727
00:45:08,315 --> 00:45:11,430
Speaker 1: the one thing I do wrong when typing is I never push right shift.

728
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:14,202
Speaker 1: I think my right shift button that might have zero actuations.

729
00:45:14,222 --> 00:45:16,632
Speaker 1: I Type it.

730
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,480
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I type correctly except for that.

731
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,709
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't use right shift often, but I do use it.

732
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:26,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess we should talk about keyboard at some point, but I think just talk about handheld controllers only controllers.

733
00:45:27,051 --> 00:45:28,357
Speaker 0: Okay, that constrains this cuz.

734
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:31,090
Speaker 0: otherwise we're talking about yolks and all sorts of shit wheels.

735
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, you forced to see what game pads only then right?

736
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,920
Speaker 1: So we did talk about joysticks.

737
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:45,690
Speaker 0: a little bit though as a kid I remember to like a lot of my friends like Kind of how like you'd have kids who would play games to win and kids who like didn't seem to understand the point of games.

738
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:47,780
Speaker 0: It would just like play him forever.

739
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:48,645
Speaker 1: play just play it.

740
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:48,966
Speaker 0: Yep.

741
00:45:48,986 --> 00:45:49,589
Speaker 0: Play just play it.

742
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:52,249
Speaker 0: A lot of my friends who played games just play him.

743
00:45:52,612 --> 00:46:00,066
Speaker 0: Like I'd watch them hold controllers in such a wrong way that it Viscerally bothered me as a kid and people wouldn't have the muscle memory and have to look at the controller.

744
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:00,146
Speaker 1: Yep.

745
00:46:00,367 --> 00:46:02,074
Speaker 0: Yep No this day.

746
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:06,094
Speaker 0: I know despite the fact that X has been in literally every possible position It could be.

747
00:46:06,114 --> 00:46:07,182
Speaker 0: I know where it is.

748
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:08,129
Speaker 0: I know where it should be.

749
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:12,930
Speaker 1: The only time I get messed up is PlayStation controller with triangles squares circle.

750
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I never played PlayStation games.

751
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,309
Speaker 0: The only PlayStation ever owned was an RIT and that was just to play DDR.

752
00:46:18,852 --> 00:46:21,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, we never played any game but DDR in that thing.

753
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:22,613
Speaker 1: Yep I didn't play.

754
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:33,090
Speaker 1: I just haven't played enough PlayStation to get it burned into my brain and I don't really think I'm gonna know which Wasn't a problem until we were ever wanted to play Soul Calibur 2 or 3 at anyone else's house.

755
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:41,832
Speaker 1: Yeah or at the main time it hurt me is playing games that were rhythm II such as that bust a move or bust a Dancing.

756
00:46:41,892 --> 00:46:53,038
Speaker 1: they've driven a lot of trouble with a ribbon and the Naruto game because the nose Naruto Smash Brothers game on ps2 I think and it would pop up shit on the screen and you'd have to be like Circle circle X triangle.

757
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,509
Speaker 1: you have to type in a move or something.

758
00:46:55,331 --> 00:46:55,993
Speaker 0: Patrick points out.

759
00:46:56,053 --> 00:46:58,784
Speaker 0: I knew people who played Atari 26 controllers upside down.

760
00:46:59,105 --> 00:47:02,501
Speaker 0: That's actually a pro move Mmm, that controller hold it.

761
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,090
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter which way you hold it.

762
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:13,643
Speaker 0: Yeah The classic position of cupping it in one hand holding in the other super inferior pro mode was you put it on a table Sideways and you just like hold on to that thing like this.

763
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,186
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

764
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:14,729
Speaker 1: Why not?

765
00:47:15,851 --> 00:47:34,430
Speaker 0: But game pads were different cuz they're designed to be held in your hands, I think the n64 controller was revolutionary but I also hated it and that was like that spawned this era of these gigantic ass controllers that were like Fitted for your whole hand to like just fit in there to ensure that no one would hold it the wrong way.

766
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:37,579
Speaker 1: Well, the n64 controller basically had two modes right is?

767
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:38,120
Speaker 1: they were like.

768
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,750
Speaker 1: we need these analog sticks cuz PlayStation 1 already has them.

769
00:47:42,492 --> 00:47:51,799
Speaker 1: But we don't like their sort of dual shock idea going on right we're making the controller for Mario 64 But we're pretty much we don't know.

770
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,410
Speaker 1: Mario 64 was like the first 3d platforming game.

771
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,746
Speaker 1: that was not garbo right or even the first one period.

772
00:47:58,368 --> 00:48:03,130
Speaker 1: so They didn't know like they're like, okay This is the analog stick you need for this.

773
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,430
Speaker 1: But they didn't know that the 3d games are gonna catch on or people are gonna make them or you know anything.

774
00:48:07,877 --> 00:48:08,670
Speaker 1: So the mate, you know.

775
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,810
Speaker 1: So they still put the d-pad and flat buttons on the outside of the controller for regular game mode.

776
00:48:14,332 --> 00:48:18,170
Speaker 1: Right thinking that most games would still be like that not realizing that.

777
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:25,415
Speaker 1: Oh I guess 99% of the games on this system are just gonna use the analog stick in the middle and that whole left side of the controller Isn't gonna get used too much.

778
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:38,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then instead of putting a second analog stick They had see up see down see left and see right which is basically another d-pad Over there on the right side, which is okay, but not as good as another analog stick

779
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:39,172
Speaker 0: I think

780
00:48:39,192 --> 00:48:42,110
Speaker 1: is what you really needed for the free look right goal.

781
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:43,395
Speaker 1: That's the main thing that killed.

782
00:48:43,435 --> 00:48:47,470
Speaker 1: that hurts golden eye and the other is that you didn't have the second analog stick.

783
00:48:48,073 --> 00:48:50,988
Speaker 1: You know, you had to look with those 4c buttons and that was no bueno.

784
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:59,981
Speaker 0: now I do think that all of the controllers that have like the weird shape that like fits your hand completely I think the GameCube was actually the best one.

785
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,409
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not that the GameCube controller just looks weird.

786
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:04,018
Speaker 0: Yeah So scap of it.

787
00:49:04,058 --> 00:49:08,867
Speaker 0: when I saw the first images of it like I did not trust it and with like the weird yellow nipple.

788
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:11,577
Speaker 1: and It just looks weird because the shape of the plastic.

789
00:49:11,617 --> 00:49:15,310
Speaker 1: but really it's pretty normal except for the layout of the buttons on the right.

790
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:21,070
Speaker 1: But the layout of the buttons on the right is actually really it while it hurts a lot of games.

791
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,096
Speaker 1: Or you sort of want the buttons lined up nicely.

792
00:49:23,116 --> 00:49:28,030
Speaker 1: It's really great for games like say, you know, Zelda type games.

793
00:49:28,070 --> 00:49:33,256
Speaker 1: You get this big ol a button you're hitting 90% of the time and everything else Right, so that was the.

794
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,561
Speaker 1: that was the thinking that went into.

795
00:49:34,601 --> 00:49:42,550
Speaker 1: that was like look you got the four buttons and they're all equally Sized and sort of equally positioned with the bottom two a little bit easier and the top right one a little bit harder to reach.

796
00:49:43,072 --> 00:49:53,670
Speaker 1: But the GameCube controller is like look you're hitting this one button way more than the other ones And you got this little one off to the side you're hitting second most and these X and Y ones you're hitting much more rarely.

797
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,929
Speaker 1: Let's put those off to the to the back but still within reach.

798
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:59,618
Speaker 0: Thing was the game that it fit.

799
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:02,949
Speaker 0: the best for me was Soul Calibur because of the.

800
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:12,003
Speaker 0: you know They had like vertical attack horizontal attack and the way those controls map to the GameCube just felt super intuitive Because the Y button was directly on top.

801
00:50:12,224 --> 00:50:13,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, be like vertical.

802
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,489
Speaker 1: Anyway, the PlayStation controller originally didn't have the two analog sticks, right.

803
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:27,636
Speaker 1: originally it was just you know the four arrows on the left and the four buttons on the right with the But and the shoulder buttons.

804
00:50:28,218 --> 00:50:39,502
Speaker 1: it added this the extra shoulders the l2 and r2 Which is above and beyond what the Super Nintendo had with the other just L and R. So that was okay, I guess you mean we still have it today.

805
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:41,710
Speaker 1: We have those buttons right as analog things.

806
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,469
Speaker 1: So that's that's cool.

807
00:50:42,991 --> 00:50:54,150
Speaker 1: but the thing I hate about PlayStation controllers so much even to this day is that the Buttons on the left the d-pad are sort of separated by this plastic thing.

808
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,336
Speaker 1: Look the thing is underneath.

809
00:50:56,778 --> 00:50:58,723
Speaker 1: It's still one contiguous d-pad.

810
00:50:58,763 --> 00:51:00,970
Speaker 0: Wasn't that just to get around the patent or whatever?

811
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:05,382
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was But it makes it really uncomfortable to use and really annoying.

812
00:51:05,622 --> 00:51:12,589
Speaker 1: also those arrows are sort of mushy Right compared to d-pads which are more, you know digital like go.

813
00:51:12,850 --> 00:51:14,782
Speaker 0: I haven't touched in any answer as any.

814
00:51:14,842 --> 00:51:18,663
Speaker 0: as gamepad like go find it Just touch one and like move that d-pad or you haven't touched.

815
00:51:18,985 --> 00:51:22,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you might not have PlayStation buttons in general are kind of mushy.

816
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,910
Speaker 1: So that bothers me.

817
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,310
Speaker 1: I like buttons to go like, you know, where you can definitely feel like click click.

818
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,943
Speaker 1: This is pressed and this is unpressed.

819
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:32,179
Speaker 0: not sort of like Because I gotta build a Nintendo finger.

820
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:34,348
Speaker 0: Sometimes you need a Nintendo finger in there.

821
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:37,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, so It was.

822
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:40,065
Speaker 1: they did have the analog on and off thing going on.

823
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:46,967
Speaker 1: They also had invented This is the one thing Nintendo didn't invent is pushing the analog stick in to as a button press.

824
00:51:47,328 --> 00:51:53,124
Speaker 0: I'm still Real real ambivalent about that because on one hand it's super useful.

825
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:54,650
Speaker 0: Well, it's some context, right?

826
00:51:54,690 --> 00:52:01,670
Speaker 1: So the good parts about that is that you're moving analog stick and in order to press the button We say you got left on my analog stick, right?

827
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:15,985
Speaker 1: If you want to push a button with that left thumb You have to remove it from the stick and now it's reset automatically to its neutral position Which is like maybe I wanted that left stick in a non neutral position while also pressing a button on the left side with the thumb Can't do it.

828
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:21,224
Speaker 1: So you assign that function to pushing the stick inwards and the stick goes in and clicks.

829
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:23,572
Speaker 1: and that's you know, okay good You did it.

830
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:30,221
Speaker 1: also it adds an extra button to the controller without having to take up any extra space Which is also great for games that need more buttons.

831
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:34,615
Speaker 0: So in breath of the wild I Hit that fucking button.

832
00:52:34,635 --> 00:52:36,762
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm so often.

833
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:37,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I'm just.

834
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:42,883
Speaker 1: naturally when I'm playing a game I'm working that stick hard and I've put some force on the stick and

835
00:52:42,903 --> 00:52:45,351
Speaker 0: as soon as the line L comes and I start working it And

836
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:52,529
Speaker 1: I'm pushing that stick in just cuz I'm pushing the stick hard and it gets act activated Accidentally and that is bad.

837
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:57,524
Speaker 1: So I prefer I would prefer that those functions not be there.

838
00:52:57,564 --> 00:52:59,170
Speaker 1: I prefer a stick be a stick and a button.

839
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,976
Speaker 0: Here's the other problem.

840
00:53:00,017 --> 00:53:02,372
Speaker 0: I found and they're what you can do though Use.

841
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:09,965
Speaker 1: you could put an actual physical button on top of the stick like a flight stick has the missile button on time But nobody does that on a tiny little analog stick.

842
00:53:10,468 --> 00:53:15,550
Speaker 0: So The real problem with that isn't that it's an option that you could use.

843
00:53:15,711 --> 00:53:18,390
Speaker 0: It's that there was an era and there's a lot of games that still do this.

844
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:24,470
Speaker 0: But I remember all those like later ps2 and ps3 games that all our friends played at RIT that we didn't really care about.

845
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,829
Speaker 0: But we'd like watch them play like Devil May Cry or whatever.

846
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:35,190
Speaker 0: There was all these games that would because the controller had X button or N buttons a number of buttons not X button.

847
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:42,269
Speaker 0: They would map something to every single button and that was how they designed their like fighting mechanics.

848
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:44,580
Speaker 0: almost They'd be like we have this many buttons.

849
00:53:44,842 --> 00:53:47,822
Speaker 0: every fucking one of them is being used And I feel like that.

850
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:48,730
Speaker 1: you don't have to do that.

851
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:52,466
Speaker 1: You can just use some of the buttons and leave the other ones is doing nothing or just double up.

852
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:53,350
Speaker 1: be like this is jump.

853
00:53:53,511 --> 00:53:54,454
Speaker 1: This is also jump.

854
00:53:54,595 --> 00:53:56,863
Speaker 1: This one's also jump like Sonic the Hedgehog.

855
00:53:56,883 --> 00:53:58,610
Speaker 1: You had a sage is in control with ABC.

856
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:00,145
Speaker 1: What's the difference in a B and C?

857
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:00,529
Speaker 1: nothing?

858
00:54:00,891 --> 00:54:05,507
Speaker 1: Help they all did the same goddamn thing pitch whichever one's more comfortable for you because the controller is enormous.

859
00:54:05,848 --> 00:54:07,630
Speaker 1: Good luck Right.

860
00:54:08,172 --> 00:54:11,080
Speaker 1: Actually, there was a six button controller for Sega Genesis.

861
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:14,772
Speaker 1: That was actually, you know, it wasn't as good as the one I've got.

862
00:54:14,853 --> 00:54:16,846
Speaker 0: actually it wasn't as it plugs into the Atari 2600, right?

863
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:25,756
Speaker 1: It wasn't as good as Super Nintendo controller because didn't have L&R but it did have the same number of buttons, you know six Plus a d-pad and a start.

864
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:33,821
Speaker 1: the one problem the good thing about the six button controller in addition having six buttons is That it was smaller.

865
00:54:34,163 --> 00:54:35,350
Speaker 1: So you could actually hit all the buttons.

866
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:39,825
Speaker 1: Also for something like Street Fighter the rows of three and three.

867
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:41,792
Speaker 1: so important so good That's like.

868
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:51,587
Speaker 1: that's why Street Fighter 2 Championship Edition on the Genesis While the software was a little bit not as good as Street Fighter 2 turbo on the SNES had those six buttons.

869
00:54:51,627 --> 00:54:55,150
Speaker 1: six button controller Playing Street Fighter with the SNES controller.

870
00:54:55,210 --> 00:55:05,382
Speaker 1: I mean people did it but using L&R for one of the punches and one of the kicks is not as good as using, you know the Final two buttons on the Genesis controller.

871
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:05,925
Speaker 0: There's a reason.

872
00:55:05,965 --> 00:55:08,293
Speaker 0: I have that expensive Fight stick.

873
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:12,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though I suck it all non Soulcalibur 2 non Bushido blade fighting.

874
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:14,290
Speaker 1: I also use it for main arcade games.

875
00:55:14,754 --> 00:55:15,946
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and pac-man.

876
00:55:15,966 --> 00:55:16,370
Speaker 0: All right.

877
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:26,470
Speaker 1: So after PlayStation the PlayStation 2 I'm not sure like what changes they made in the DualShock 2 because that's the arrow I think they only made like subtle changes that like weren't a big deal?

878
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:29,866
Speaker 1: I don't really remember because I wasn't a PlayStation type person.

879
00:55:30,007 --> 00:55:32,590
Speaker 0: Yeah in the Xbox I was also like I hated those controllers.

880
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:40,793
Speaker 1: Well, the first X the first Xbox controller was basically a PlayStation controller only way big like a Genesis controller Right.

881
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:41,636
Speaker 1: It was enormous.

882
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:44,725
Speaker 1: And in fact, they later on released like a special edition of it.

883
00:55:45,026 --> 00:55:46,150
Speaker 1: That was a normal size.

884
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:51,929
Speaker 0: I mean penny arcade made it so many strips making fun of that giant ass controller on the Xbox.

885
00:55:51,969 --> 00:56:01,130
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh, I shouldn't forget to mention Dreamcast controller Has control the weird one from the weird console, right?

886
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:07,870
Speaker 1: So Dreamcast controller looks enormous and weird But actually it's really comfortable and really useful and just perfectly feels really intuitive.

887
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:15,852
Speaker 1: It only feels weird if you look at it while like you look down you're like, oh, right The only problem it really has is it doesn't have the right analog stick, right, you know But it's.

888
00:56:15,953 --> 00:56:16,937
Speaker 1: and the other problem has is the.

889
00:56:17,198 --> 00:56:18,504
Speaker 1: I think the cord comes out the bottom.

890
00:56:18,806 --> 00:56:19,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was always weird.

891
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:21,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't like cord coming out.

892
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:22,809
Speaker 1: the bottom cord must come out the top.

893
00:56:23,752 --> 00:56:26,710
Speaker 1: But anyway it all the thing it had is the VMU thingy.

894
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,089
Speaker 1: Right and the VMU thingy was like a little memory card.

895
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:37,390
Speaker 1: You putting it in the controller was great much better than putting a memory card for save games into the console back in the days.

896
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:39,909
Speaker 1: And we still need memory cards and we didn't just have storage.

897
00:56:40,552 --> 00:56:48,770
Speaker 1: But it also had a little screen on it and you could also take it out and play little games on it Which was in some ways better than the GBA link cable.

898
00:56:49,192 --> 00:56:54,730
Speaker 1: But since it was way weak, it was nowhere near as good as the GBA link cable Yeah, and it couldn't do funk.

899
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:56,790
Speaker 1: You couldn't have a crystal chronicles in the Dreamcast.

900
00:56:57,272 --> 00:57:10,050
Speaker 1: But I would have loved in the day for that VMU idea to have been as good, you know Like what if the GameCube the official controller was the GBA and there were no GameCube controller do right something like that?

901
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:10,766
Speaker 1: I don't know.

902
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:17,390
Speaker 0: So I think right now in terms of consoles the best controller money can buy is the Nintendo pro controller.

903
00:57:18,093 --> 00:57:19,237
Speaker 0: It feels so tight.

904
00:57:19,257 --> 00:57:20,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've had it look sticks.

905
00:57:20,502 --> 00:57:22,550
Speaker 1: I pay it's 70 bucks, which is fucking bullshit.

906
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:26,710
Speaker 0: It's worth it though, but I have it for the switch and like it's pretty great.

907
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,069
Speaker 0: It's like the analog sticks like you don't realize to use them.

908
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:34,803
Speaker 0: They're way more sensitive and they feel like they're like they have more play.

909
00:57:34,843 --> 00:57:35,244
Speaker 0: like they're just.

910
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:35,926
Speaker 1: it's just.

911
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:39,158
Speaker 1: it's just a perfect normal Controller as it has a good head.

912
00:57:39,379 --> 00:57:40,544
Speaker 1: It has two analog sticks.

913
00:57:40,705 --> 00:57:41,890
Speaker 1: It has four face buttons.

914
00:57:42,211 --> 00:57:45,122
Speaker 1: It's got l1 l2 r1 r2 and that's it.

915
00:57:45,202 --> 00:57:45,945
Speaker 0: built-in battery.

916
00:57:45,965 --> 00:57:52,527
Speaker 1: It just charges on the console USB-c cable does wireless has perfect high, you know fancy rumblin.

917
00:57:52,587 --> 00:57:53,610
Speaker 1: Oh, we didn't talk about rumblin.

918
00:57:54,193 --> 00:57:57,950
Speaker 0: I feel like we should do a separate show on rumblin a whole show and I think we do a whole show on rumblin.

919
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:01,640
Speaker 1: But yeah, the current Xbox is a big deal.

920
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,402
Speaker 1: It is a big deal.

921
00:58:02,422 --> 00:58:05,390
Speaker 1: But you know, the current Xbox controllers are perfectly serviceable.

922
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:10,110
Speaker 1: So are the current PlayStation ones except for my personal dislike of the separated arrow.

923
00:58:10,972 --> 00:58:19,598
Speaker 0: So outside of consoles until recently I would say that the regular old like Xbox 360 controller Is the best controller to use on a PC?

924
00:58:19,658 --> 00:58:20,842
Speaker 1: It's still a terrific controller.

925
00:58:20,862 --> 00:58:23,170
Speaker 1: It has a d-pad though is so weak on it.

926
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:28,050
Speaker 1: It's like a circle with a raised plus on it and it is not very good.

927
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,710
Speaker 1: You'll often be hitting the wrong arrow when you try to use it.

928
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:37,980
Speaker 0: Well, the other problem it has is that the official dongle to plug it into a PC Like they just stop making it you many years ago.

929
00:58:38,221 --> 00:58:49,288
Speaker 1: I've heard that the third-party ones work just fine Yeah, but like it was just weird that they stopped making the official way you can and I think that I think the Xbox one Controller, I think we'll just connect and so will I think the PlayStation controller?

930
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:49,710
Speaker 0: I think so.

931
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:52,430
Speaker 1: I think they just connect to PCs like with Bluetooth or something.

932
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,598
Speaker 0: What about the Nintendo Pro controller?

933
00:58:53,619 --> 00:58:55,069
Speaker 0: cuz I haven't tried to connect it to my PC.

934
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:57,062
Speaker 1: I don't think it connects to a PC cuz they would.

935
00:58:57,082 --> 00:59:00,219
Speaker 0: I think it is I think the best controller for the PC.

936
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,430
Speaker 1: I think someone tried to do it with Linux or something.

937
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:06,430
Speaker 0: I gotta look into the state of that because they would be would dethrone the Xbox controller.

938
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:14,070
Speaker 0: Maybe because the only attempt to make a better controller by anyone serious on the PC to play games with was the steam controller.

939
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:16,020
Speaker 0: Frankly I think they kind of failed.

940
00:59:16,081 --> 00:59:17,330
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that good a controller.

941
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:19,511
Speaker 0: No, it's got a lot of flaws It has.

942
00:59:19,531 --> 00:59:25,270
Speaker 1: it has some things going for it that make it good like those inside buttons are brilliant.

943
00:59:25,591 --> 00:59:26,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty good league.

944
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:28,099
Speaker 0: Those things are amazing.

945
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,925
Speaker 1: It works really well with PC.

946
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:33,597
Speaker 1: right because I'll made for PC You know, the buttons are nice.

947
00:59:33,919 --> 00:59:39,390
Speaker 1: the two touch pads with the tactile miss I'm sure this gate and like the fact that it just work as a mouse.

948
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:46,548
Speaker 1: It's like it's really good Sometimes when you want to use those things, but those times are so rare and nobody's making games.

949
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:50,631
Speaker 1: That's the thing is Nintendo made games of the analog stick Like.

950
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:54,989
Speaker 1: I talked about how they made the a64 controller and then in Mario 64 that goes with it.

951
00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:00,810
Speaker 1: Right, the steam controller has these tactile discs and the valve didn't make a game to go with that.

952
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:08,885
Speaker 1: So it's like they don't have a. you know, it's sort of the way that John Carmack would like makes game engines But without John Romero, he doesn't make a game to go with the engine.

953
01:00:08,925 --> 01:00:11,323
Speaker 1: you get something like rage Which no one wants to play.

954
01:00:11,343 --> 01:00:11,970
Speaker 1: Yep, right?

955
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:22,404
Speaker 1: You have to make a controller with a game together and then you will that those two things feed into each other And then you design the controller properly.

956
01:00:22,565 --> 01:00:24,580
Speaker 0: also the steam controller Like if we want.

957
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:28,401
Speaker 0: if I want to just like oh, hey Let's play a game and I get a like pair a bunch of controllers on my HD PC.

958
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:39,308
Speaker 0: I often find that the steam controller Sometimes because it's kind of too smart for its own good It just works brilliantly and other times it just doesn't play nice with the game or doesn't play nice with.

959
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:44,910
Speaker 0: like the fact That I also have three Xbox controllers and I ended up not using it in the living room at all anymore.

960
01:00:45,332 --> 01:00:46,999
Speaker 0: I bought another Xbox controller instead.

961
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:49,530
Speaker 1: I mostly use my steam controller on my desktop piece.

962
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,018
Speaker 1: That's what I do for those times.

963
01:00:51,058 --> 01:00:56,049
Speaker 1: You really need a controller on your desk here Even though you wouldn't use a controller when you're sitting at a desk.

964
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:00,510
Speaker 1: It's in here solely for that purpose and then I use Xbox controllers on the HD PC.

965
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:02,430
Speaker 0: That is exactly what I do as well.

966
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:06,606
Speaker 0: I would not recommend buying the steam controller unless you already have it or like you get it cheap.

967
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:09,769
Speaker 1: Yeah What are the controllers out there.

968
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:21,830
Speaker 1: Oh So also on peep on top PC before you had the steam controller and before you were able to use console controllers on your PC You had to buy like PC game pads and they were a drive his game pad, right?

969
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:30,022
Speaker 1: So they were very poorly supported for many many years because basically people making PC games didn't make games that required a game pad.

970
01:01:30,082 --> 01:01:38,870
Speaker 1: because like which one there I remember like someone bought Super Street Fighter 2 turbo for PC for DOS and it came with a six button PC game pad.

971
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,210
Speaker 1: They had a game connector.

972
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:45,630
Speaker 0: Like if you had a game controller or a flight stick or anything at all You usually plugged him directly into your sound card.

973
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:55,346
Speaker 1: So in the reasons that are way beyond the scope of this episode in the commander keen days There was the gravis game pad, which was for but for face buttons and a digital pad that you could also.

974
01:01:55,426 --> 01:01:56,670
Speaker 0: it was so garbage.

975
01:01:56,872 --> 01:01:57,438
Speaker 1: It was not.

976
01:01:57,661 --> 01:02:04,710
Speaker 1: it was not good but it was the only game pad you can get on PC and playing commander keen with that was better than playing it with the keyboard and keyboard.

977
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:09,042
Speaker 1: Yeah So they did make a gravis game pad pro that I got.

978
01:02:09,323 --> 01:02:11,450
Speaker 1: that in addition to the four face buttons.

979
01:02:11,592 --> 01:02:11,652
Speaker 1: All.

980
01:02:11,673 --> 01:02:16,630
Speaker 1: it was basically a Super Nintendo Sort of controller right and it's sort of a PlayStation controller.

981
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:22,403
Speaker 1: Also, it didn't really have the analog sticks but it had the d-pad on the left four buttons on the right l1 l2 r1 r2.

982
01:02:22,484 --> 01:02:30,169
Speaker 1: and You know, there weren't really games made for that but you could you know any game that was.

983
01:02:30,189 --> 01:02:33,374
Speaker 0: you know Games use that primarily in that era Emulators.

984
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:34,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, any SSM you later?

985
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:36,635
Speaker 1: That's exactly what I used it for.

986
01:02:36,675 --> 01:02:41,996
Speaker 1: is I would you know in those days when I had emulators on my old wind This is Windows 98 times.

987
01:02:42,478 --> 01:02:45,630
Speaker 1: I'd plug in that gravis gamepad Pro, which is not even USB.

988
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,870
Speaker 1: I don't think it might have been USB or might have been still been game controller.

989
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:56,117
Speaker 1: I actually had a game a car a PCI card that you plugged game controllers into with it, you know Yeah had a game port.

990
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,070
Speaker 0: So because we've got we've got a long enough I think but I'm good.

991
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:12,250
Speaker 0: Something that I think because we talked about Steam greenlight dying and like any games and all that it is Inexcusable in the year 2017 to release a game that doesn't just support controllers and just work.

992
01:03:12,611 --> 01:03:19,129
Speaker 0: Yep, like joy to key if you need if your game requires people to do nonsense like that you fucked up.

993
01:03:19,626 --> 01:03:21,674
Speaker 1: Yeah the steam controller you don't need joy to keep.

994
01:03:21,694 --> 01:03:34,460
Speaker 1: you have a steam controller because they have this thing where it turns into a And you'll get proof for if it's a popular game and a profile will exist for it and you can sort of download the profile Yeah, and it'll just suddenly work which is really nice.

995
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,767
Speaker 1: And that's another time that I'll use the steam controller which is why it's kind of worth having.

996
01:03:38,807 --> 01:03:45,030
Speaker 1: if you play a lot of steam games sitting at your debt, you know, but It's still not.

997
01:03:45,232 --> 01:03:46,301
Speaker 1: it shouldn't be that way You're.

998
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:50,774
Speaker 1: if you have a game that you just made your game should support controllers properly.

999
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:52,500
Speaker 1: right whether it's PC or not.

1000
01:03:52,781 --> 01:03:57,100
Speaker 0: Yep, like it's it's sort of a minimum requirement of releasing a game in the modern era.

1001
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:58,145
Speaker 0: I'm even if you don't.

1002
01:03:58,185 --> 01:03:58,909
Speaker 1: if I was steam.

1003
01:03:58,949 --> 01:03:59,311
Speaker 1: here's the thing.

1004
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:01,863
Speaker 1: if I was steam with this new system I'll just require it.

1005
01:04:02,084 --> 01:04:06,560
Speaker 1: I'd reject any game that didn't support controller the appropriate controls appropriate to the game.

1006
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,896
Speaker 1: Now you might say if doesn't need gamepad support true, right?

1007
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:12,827
Speaker 0: You might say but my I wouldn't accept platformer.

1008
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:14,412
Speaker 1: I'd be like game pads or no one steam.

1009
01:04:14,673 --> 01:04:31,171
Speaker 0: So you might say your game doesn't need it, but Having that Configurability is very important for accessibility because a lot of times crazy Accessibility devices will show up as a game controller or a keyboard of some kind And you need a way to be able to map it and use it.

1010
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:34,627
Speaker 0: if your game doesn't support that you lose Accessibility and you piss me off.

1011
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:35,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we were.

1012
01:04:35,712 --> 01:04:36,053
Speaker 1: I tried to.

1013
01:04:36,194 --> 01:04:39,911
Speaker 1: you know, the topic is so broad I wanted to only talk about the actual controllers.

1014
01:04:40,011 --> 01:04:41,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you do need to remember right?

1015
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:47,840
Speaker 1: You know part of controls is in the software as well of each and every individual game.

1016
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:53,320
Speaker 1: You can have the best controller right and a really crappy game has bad controls, right?

1017
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:53,987
Speaker 1: It's like the end.

1018
01:04:54,008 --> 01:04:54,980
Speaker 1: think about NES games.

1019
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,053
Speaker 1: You got something like Mario 3 and you got something like I don't know.

1020
01:04:59,273 --> 01:05:03,980
Speaker 0: playing Mario 3 in an emulator with a gravis gamepad Was almost impossible right but but not right that's true.

1021
01:05:04,342 --> 01:05:11,955
Speaker 1: but also just think about having an actual NES with Mario 3 and An actual NES with a really bad game with bad controls like man.

1022
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:13,200
Speaker 1: Yeah sure, right.

1023
01:05:13,461 --> 01:05:21,400
Speaker 1: It's like you have the same controller the same hardware Except the game is different and now the same controller is now garbage with that bad game.

1024
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,088
Speaker 0: Should we do another show on controls?

1025
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:32,440
Speaker 1: I think we I don't know but it's like You have to be able to separate like when is the controller at fault and when is the software at fault for being bad?

1026
01:05:33,101 --> 01:05:39,219
Speaker 1: Sometimes hard to tell if a whole bunch of software gets it wrong and you can't find any software doing it, right?

1027
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,773
Speaker 0: So anyway, get that Nintendo Pro controller working on a PC.

1028
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,778
Speaker 0: Whoever's working on that.

1029
