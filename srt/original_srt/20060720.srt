1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,570
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, July 20th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,509
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about Bezeal and the creative powers of geeks.

3
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:20,789
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,190
Speaker 0: You know it's a good day when you do a podcast after having some barbecued chicken.

5
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:32,209
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we barbecued some chicken today, which is actually the first time that I have personally attempted to barbecue chicken on my own.

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,790
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, you did a pretty good job, all things considered.

7
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:46,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think next time it will be much more awesome because I will A) marinade the chicken longer, which I didn't do only because I woke up this morning and the chicken that was in the refrigerator was rotten and I had to go buy some new chicken.

8
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,510
Speaker 0: Partly because we'd forgotten to marinate it for the previous several days.

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,070
Speaker 1: I guess that's good if you didn't waste marinade on rotten chicken.

10
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:53,302
Speaker 1: But also...

11
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,430
Speaker 0: You know what the worst thing is?

12
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,790
Speaker 0: If you'd marinated it and then not used it, you probably wouldn't have noticed the rot in the marinade.

13
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,369
Speaker 1: Ew, yeah, it smelled real bad, I almost barfed.

14
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:05,388
Speaker 1: But I'm keeping the streak alive, it's what, been a month maybe?

15
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:13,370
Speaker 0: I gotta admit though, almost nothing in the world other than a sack of rotten potatoes smells worse than rotten raw chicken.

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,349
Speaker 1: Rotten chicken smells pretty damn bad.

17
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,530
Speaker 0: Particularly raw rotten chicken.

18
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:20,090
Speaker 0: If it's been cooked, it doesn't smell nearly so bad.

19
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,570
Speaker 1: But next time I barbecue chicken, especially with our awesome special teriyaki sauce that we have, you can fair, it's gonna be awesome.

20
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:29,489
Speaker 0: I'll fair with two threes and a P and an H.

21
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:30,169
Speaker 1: Alright.

22
00:01:30,774 --> 00:01:32,870
Speaker 1: So, we got two GeekBacks today.

23
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:37,449
Speaker 0: Yep, they're both short, and actually the people who wrote us- And they're almost the same thing, so.

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:46,069
Speaker 0: The people who wrote us are probably going to be somewhat angry at the fact that we're doing two GeekBacks when their complaint was that we're spending too much time on GeekBacks.

25
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,949
Speaker 1: Well, hold on.

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,750
Speaker 1: We're gonna read both of them and then we'll reply to both of them.

27
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,110
Speaker 0: Alright, so I got this short one from Spirit Fiend.

28
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,946
Speaker 0: It's real short, I'll just read the whole thing.

29
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,129
Speaker 0: I think the feedback segment is good, though I don't think it should come at the expense of the news bits.

30
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:08,990
Speaker 0: I think the commentary on the news is one of the best parts of Geek Nights, and is one of the reasons I download and listen every day, since I don't really have such a great interest in conventions, anime, or board games.

31
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,050
Speaker 0: I'm also glad Rym enjoyed my "fallacy by accident" comment in the jury nullification thread.

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,350
Speaker 0: You guys should definitely do an episode on logical fallacies.

33
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,049
Speaker 0: Keep up the great work, Spirit Fiend.

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,529
Speaker 1: Alright, and this one is from Tresha.

35
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,069
Speaker 1: Hi, hello, I'm Tresha.

36
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,990
Speaker 1: Punk kid from Florida, I guess.

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, punk kids.

38
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:32,909
Speaker 1: I just wanted to say that I don't want you guys to make the episodes shorter, but I guess if you really have to make them shorter, oh well.

39
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,830
Speaker 1: Another thing, don't make the news shorter.

40
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,026
Speaker 1: Geek Nights has evolved into the news and then main bit podcast, and I rather like it like that.

41
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,110
Speaker 1: Most of the times, I just listen for the news, since I don't really care much for the other stuff.

42
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,309
Speaker 1: Computer lingo and board games aren't the most interesting to listen to.

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,348
Speaker 1: I haven't listened to all of Tuesday's show, and I probably won't, since I'm not really into board games.

44
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,567
Speaker 1: Flat face.

45
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:58,650
Speaker 1: But I was really disappointed with Monday's podcast.

46
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,690
Speaker 1: Bring back the news!

47
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,049
Speaker 1: I mean, it's nice that you guys talk about sci-fi, in fact, I just finished reading Foundation recently.

48
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,740
Speaker 1: But if you guys talk about sci-fi books, I'd really like it if you can do what you did with that episode.

49
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:12,690
Speaker 1: you talked about the big O. Just talking a little about a book isn't really enough, I think.

50
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,770
Speaker 1: Sci-fi novels deserve a whole episode with spoilers and whatnot talking about the book.

51
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:24,149
Speaker 1: Another problem I have is you guys have a lot of inside jokes, or jokes some people won't get if they haven't seen a certain show or played a certain game, etc.

52
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,589
Speaker 1: And it irritates me, but it's not that bad.

53
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:27,509
Speaker 0: Oh really?

54
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:35,750
Speaker 1: Other than these things, your show is awesome, and I probably continue to listen despite my complaints, since there just aren't that many other podcasts and I listen to.

55
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,170
Speaker 0: Alright.

56
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,050
Speaker 0: Well, I want to start with the inside jokes, because I can kill that off real quick.

57
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:51,409
Speaker 0: Most of the "inside jokes" we make are actually very common knowledge on the popular tech geek internet websites.

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,870
Speaker 0: They're not really that obscure.

59
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,668
Speaker 0: We really tend to avoid the obscure ones.

60
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,490
Speaker 1: Yes, and a lot of them, you know, second to the internet tech website ones, like Oh Really?

61
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,050
Speaker 1: and Ha Ha, there are, the next comes the Simpsons, Seinfeld, Futurama Family Guy jokes.

62
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:09,369
Speaker 1: And South Park, also.

63
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:14,910
Speaker 1: So if you got all those covered, there aren't that many jokes left over that are really inside.

64
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,930
Speaker 0: I mean, it seems that most geeks, though there might be some exceptions, I mean for a long time, Simpsons quoting.

65
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:29,150
Speaker 0: The act of hearing a quote from a Simpsons episode, and being able to continue the quote until the end, or make a similar relevant quote.

66
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,190
Speaker 1: That was a stat you had on your character sheet, Simpsons quoting, 7 points.

67
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:40,150
Speaker 0: I mean, that, we would have geek downs, kind of like a stare down, where people would just keep quoting Simpsons at each other until someone ran out.

68
00:04:40,491 --> 00:04:42,348
Speaker 1: Or until someone said, "I don't know that

69
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:42,570
Speaker 1: one.".

70
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,469
Speaker 1: Oh, you have the low skills!

71
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,947
Speaker 0: Shake harder, boy!

72
00:04:48,452 --> 00:04:49,890
Speaker 1: *laughter* Say?

73
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,508
Speaker 1: Exactly.

74
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

75
00:04:52,590 --> 00:05:00,928
Speaker 0: Plus, I can tell you with certainty that any time we use an actual inside joke, like, here's one, so there were 8 people, everybody was Ga Ga.

76
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:11,350
Speaker 1: If we use an inside joke that you don't understand, join the forums and ask about it, and we will tell you all about the joke.

77
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,730
Speaker 0: For example, the one we just did, the only reason we haven't done an entire episode on is because we're trying to get it to play it on the show.

78
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:23,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have two copies of this file on two separate dead hard drives.

79
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,328
Speaker 1: We'll get it back.

80
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:26,889
Speaker 1: We'll get it back, it's still good.

81
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:27,419
Speaker 1: Anyway.

82
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,904
Speaker 1: It's still good.

83
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,329
Speaker 1: It's just a little crashed hard drive, it's still good.

84
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:31,809
Speaker 0: It's gone, Dad.

85
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:33,729
Speaker 1: I know.

86
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:44,930
Speaker 1: Okay, as for talking about sci-fi and stuff, I completely agree that the episodes like we did with Big O are way better.

87
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:46,234
Speaker 1: It's just that.

88
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:59,890
Speaker 1: a lot of the things to talk about, you know, it takes a long time to finish watching or finish reading something, especially for both me and Rym to do it, and we can't do those great episodes unless we've both completed something.

89
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,770
Speaker 0: Which one is much easier for anime.

90
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,430
Speaker 1: Because we can both watch it at the same time.

91
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:10,890
Speaker 0: And despite that, go through and look at how many final thoughts anime episodes we've done versus how many previews and reviews we've done.

92
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:11,370
Speaker 1: Yep.

93
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:16,210
Speaker 0: We've only finished, I think, two or three shows since we started Geek Nights.

94
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:23,529
Speaker 1: I mean, we could do more final thoughts shows and shows that are kind of old, but, you know, a lot of other podcasts cover that.

95
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,350
Speaker 0: I mean, we will eventually.

96
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,229
Speaker 0: We're also going to review a lot of old shows.

97
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:36,457
Speaker 1: The thing is, especially for the old shows, while we know them well because they are old and we've watched them many times, we really have to watch them again before we do a legitimate episode.

98
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:37,610
Speaker 1: that does them a good service.

99
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,710
Speaker 0: Yep, especially those perennial shows that we watch periodically every few years.

100
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:52,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, so those final thoughts episodes, I agree, are the best and awesome, but we can't do too many of them simply because we can't do too many of them, especially during convention season.

101
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:01,810
Speaker 0: Now also, a little secret, the Monday episode where we talked about sci-fi was mostly a cop-out because we didn't have anything better to do and we had both recently finished sci-fi books.

102
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,285
Speaker 1: Yep.

103
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:10,130
Speaker 0: Once we both trade books and read each other's book, each one of those books is going to get a full final thoughts episode, I promise you that.

104
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:20,950
Speaker 1: Yep, plus also, I've read a lot of comic books recently and Rim hasn't read any, so if he starts to read some of them, then we can do really awesome episodes about them.

105
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,689
Speaker 0: Yep, plus once we watch some more anime, we'll get some more of that in there.

106
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,169
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

107
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,170
Speaker 1: Especially because right now we're in the middle of anime series.

108
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,950
Speaker 1: As soon as they finish, then we can have final thoughts episodes.

109
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:47,984
Speaker 0: Now anyway, to address both of the geek-backs, it seems, I mean we asked everyone for feedback as to, as we're kind of changing the format of the show a tiny bit, and so far 100% of the feedback has been that everyone wants the news to be long and unrelated to the rest of the show.

110
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,330
Speaker 1: Yep, uh, all I can say is the show has to be shorter because of Libsyn.

111
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,010
Speaker 1: There's really no way around that, short of everyone giving us huge piles of money.

112
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,364
Speaker 0: Now keep in mind shorter means the episodes are going to be 45-50 minutes every day anyway.

113
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just can't keep doing these 90 minute episodes that we seem to do by accident.

114
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:14,290
Speaker 0: The thing is, we could easily, if it weren't for the fact that we would have to pay Libsyn a lot of money.

115
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,010
Speaker 1: Like significantly more than we pay them now.

116
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,910
Speaker 0: Because we're using the maximum default service they have.

117
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,816
Speaker 0: Anything beyond that.

118
00:08:20,836 --> 00:08:22,570
Speaker 0: we have to negotiate custom.

119
00:08:23,151 --> 00:08:24,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's not good.

120
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:39,070
Speaker 1: And as for the news, cutting it, you know, I guess if you're not into board games and, you know, the reason we have separate feeds of geek nights is, you know, if you're not interested in some of the things, then why are you listening?

121
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:48,470
Speaker 0: I guess the best way to explain is, think of this, we have, uh, geek news, you know, like the Twits basically, Rim and Scott do what Twit does only, in my opinion, better.

122
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:49,488
Speaker 0: But that's just me.

123
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:59,049
Speaker 0: Then we have the, you know, sci-fi technology show, the anime/manga comics show, the video games/board games show, and the special bits show.

124
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:02,409
Speaker 0: Really, we have five separate shows.

125
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:07,809
Speaker 0: One of which we do a little bit of at the beginning of every show instead of giving it its own day.

126
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:08,989
Speaker 0: That's the news bit.

127
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,490
Speaker 0: We could basically do the news as a whole show on Friday instead.

128
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,570
Speaker 0: We just don't because we go out of town almost every weekend.

129
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:33,230
Speaker 1: I guess, and also, we try to keep the news related to whatever that day is, so on Monday we try to do tech news and on Wednesday we try to do anime news, and it's just, it was so hard for us to find news stories, I mean, not to find news stories, we found all of them, it's just to find one that's worth talking about.

130
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:44,969
Speaker 0: The worst part is we'd usually often find ones that we wanted to talk about so much that we'd end up, instead of doing a news about it, we'd basically do a whole show about it and then do a whole normal show.

131
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:54,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, you know, and while you might, you guys might really enjoy the whole episode about the news story of the day, I don't know, that's not really what we're trying to do.

132
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,510
Speaker 0: Though, we want more feedback on this because if that's really what all of you want, I mean.

133
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:10,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess what we could do is, if, from now on, if there's a news bit that we end up talking a whole lot about, we could just make that the episode instead of- Because

134
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:17,530
Speaker 0: any news bit is going to fit into one of the four days, because note that most of the news we talk about would fit into Monday, science and tech.

135
00:10:18,471 --> 00:10:21,390
Speaker 0: Monday is also the day we're the hardest hit for content.

136
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:27,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why we came up with the "how a computer works" is to fill in all the days where you can't think of what else to talk about on tech day.

137
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:38,210
Speaker 0: So, one, I think by doing one news instead of two news, you'll still get the same depth of commentary about the news as opposed to us cutting ourselves short, at least for now until maybe our hosting situation improves.

138
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:38,722
Speaker 1: Yep.

139
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:40,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

140
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:49,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also, I mean, we'll definitely address the newses that are worth talking about on Mondays or possibly other days, like Thursdays, so you'll still get everything.

141
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:56,450
Speaker 0: If you don't like anime, board games, manga, comics, video games, all of that, just listen to Monday and Thursday, I guess.

142
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:57,047
Speaker 1: I guess.

143
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:04,130
Speaker 1: The other thing is, you know, since we started the Geek Back segment, as I predicted, the amount of feedback we've been getting has exploded.

144
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:11,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't get a response from us right away, or we seem to ignore you, we've read it, and it's in our hopper somewhere.

145
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:18,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, because we like getting more feedback, we're gonna keep the Geek Back segment because it makes more feedback come in.

146
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,370
Speaker 0: Now unless you all really don't like it and we get a lot of emails saying it should go away, but at the same token, that means we're getting a lot of Geek Backs to read.

147
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:26,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

148
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:35,570
Speaker 1: So if you've got something to say about this, go to the forum or email us or voicemail us or something and open your mouth.

149
00:11:35,691 --> 00:11:40,049
Speaker 1: If you don't open your mouth, then, you know, you're not voting, that's it.

150
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:40,585
Speaker 1: Hey.

151
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:41,450
Speaker 1: Tough shit.

152
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:48,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we really need your feedback because we could basically do a podcast on anything at this point.

153
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,510
Speaker 0: Anything we know anything about.

154
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has to be something we know something about, which is a lot of stuff.

155
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:53,469
Speaker 0: So we need some direction here.

156
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,210
Speaker 1: Okay, and onto the news they wanted to hear.

157
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,590
Speaker 0: Alright, now the news, but it's right in with the main topic today.

158
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,770
Speaker 1: So right after we do the news, we're gonna do things of the day, like quick throwing in there, just to keep the order straight.

159
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:17,890
Speaker 0: Now this is something that's been known for a long time among content creators, and it's referred to in most cases as the 1% rule, or the Magic Man rule, I've heard it referred to it a whole bunch of different ways.

160
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:34,789
Speaker 0: And the basic theory here is that for every 100 people in a given medium, 1 is a content creator, 10 will interact directly with that content, and the other 89 will consume that content, and nothing more.

161
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:48,490
Speaker 1: So take 100 people, put them on the internet, 1 of them is a blogger, 10 of them are people who comment on the blog, and the rest, the other 89 people, just read the blog or just look at it, or who knows.

162
00:12:48,870 --> 00:13:03,710
Speaker 0: Now there is a great wealth of empirical evidence showing that these ratios are for the most part true, and that very few people create content, and very few people interact with content, and the vast majority of human beings in all media do nothing but consume it.

163
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,649
Speaker 0: They are basically nothing more than fans.

164
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look at Dig, you know, you've got, uh, I'm in the 89% on Dig.

165
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:18,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm in the 10% on Dig because I dig things and occasionally comment, and then the 1% are the people submitting things to Dig, you know, so hey.

166
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,419
Speaker 1: Yep.

167
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:31,830
Speaker 1: And this relates very much to our topic today of the zeal, and the creativeness, talking about, you know, how much geeks are creative, and what they do, and et cetera et cetera.

168
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:38,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically we're doing a long episode, well, we'll see how long it is, about geek- hmm, I don't know how long it is.

169
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:45,339
Speaker 0: About geek creativity, and why people like us do the things we do.

170
00:13:45,762 --> 00:13:46,939
Speaker 1: And why other people don't.

171
00:13:47,420 --> 00:14:07,098
Speaker 0: It's also partly a rebuttal to a lot of what Anime World Order has been saying lately in regards to fandom, because they seem to have a bug up their butt about anime fandom not being what it used to be, and we submit that anime fandom, just like every other geekery out there, and we're gonna talk about all of them, is not really changed.

172
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,639
Speaker 0: The rule still applies, but there's more people, and there are actually more content creators and more zeal now than there ever was.

173
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:25,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also it's sort of a shout-out to the Creative Mom podcast, it's, uh- Yeah, of all the podcasts that link to us, I never expected a podcast called "The Creative Mom" to do it.

174
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she linked to us, so I emailed her, like, "Holy crap, the Creative Mom, what's

175
00:14:29,901 --> 00:14:30,021
Speaker 1: up?"

176
00:14:30,162 --> 00:14:38,820
Speaker 1: and, you know, she was all cool and geeky, kind of, and we were talking about how geeks are creative in different ways, and very cool, very cool.

177
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,600
Speaker 0: So consider that a shout-out, I'll look, and if there's a promo, it'll get played at some point in this episode.

178
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,034
Speaker 1: Yep.

179
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:45,055
Speaker 1: Alright.

180
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,958
Speaker 1: Thing of the day.

181
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,009
Speaker 0: Things of the day!

182
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,030
Speaker 1: Who wants to go first?

183
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:56,747
Speaker 0: I'll do it.

184
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:03,269
Speaker 0: Mine is actually really cool, and I think we'll talk about this more in the future, partly because I imagine us being involved in this in some way.

185
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:03,988
Speaker 1: Oh great.

186
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:17,350
Speaker 0: Now, this is something called couchsurfing, and very simply, it is a website that allows people to either put their couch up for free rent, or seek out a free couch to borrow.

187
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,690
Speaker 0: So say I take a trip to Sweden, and I'm wandering around Sweden.

188
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,408
Speaker 1: You're to Sweden.

189
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,170
Speaker 0: So ahead of time, I went to couchsurfing and I saw there's a cool dude somewhere in Sweden, and he'll let me sleep on his couch for a week.

190
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,928
Speaker 0: So I talk to him ahead of time, we work something out, I show up and I sleep on his couch for a week while I explore Sweden.

191
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,408
Speaker 1: Pretty cool.

192
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,316
Speaker 0: Or we put our couch up, and then cool people travel in the world say, "Hey, I want to sleep in your house for tonight,".

193
00:15:42,638 --> 00:15:44,530
Speaker 0: and we work something out and we let him stay on our couch.

194
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,770
Speaker 1: Sounds very, very cool, except it also sounds very, very dangerous.

195
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:57,470
Speaker 0: Yes, however, I am seriously considering us doing this at least once, so that one, we would get an awesome story to tell, and two, we could interview this person.

196
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:12,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really not too frightened if it's like a person, because I mean, if they're not packing any weaponry, like a gun or drugs or anything like that that would get us in trouble or something like that, they're really not dangerous, I mean, even if they tried to beat us up, we could

197
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:12,620
Speaker 0: probably--.

198
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:21,446
Speaker 0: Well no no no, the worst thing that would probably happen, if they were a bad person, is they're asleep on the couch bed at night, right, and worsely, they wake up, take everything small of value.

199
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,410
Speaker 0: they can get their hands on downstairs and just leave.

200
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,448
Speaker 0: If I were an evil dude, that's what I would do.

201
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:27,906
Speaker 1: Yep.

202
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:40,210
Speaker 0: But we'll figure all that out, I just think it's a neat idea, and it seems like a lot of people are at least trying to do it, and I really like it when people actually trust their fellow human beings, even a little bit.

203
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:51,529
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, I think we're good enough judges of character to know when someone's gonna be a thief or not, and the trick is that when this person comes, you know, you kind of befriend them to make sure that they would feel bad by stealing and--

204
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,070
Speaker 0: Also, webcam, sitting pointed at them while they're sleeping.

205
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,121
Speaker 1: Exactly, you make sure you get something from them, like you say, "Alright, I'm gonna have to take your ID before you go,".

206
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:04,309
Speaker 1: you know, something simple like that, and if they're an honest person, they'll say, "Yeah, sure, why not?

207
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,229
Speaker 1: You're letting me stay in your house, you can hold on to my ID and I'll

208
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:07,369
Speaker 1: leave.".

209
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,627
Speaker 0: Of course then, now that we've got their passport, they become an indentured servant and have to buy it back.

210
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,306
Speaker 1: Ah, you are wise.

211
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,020
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is from 1957, or '58, actually it's from '58.

212
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,630
Speaker 0: We just got a feedback about people who don't want us to make inside jokes.

213
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,609
Speaker 1: It's not an inside joke so much, it's from a popular internet thing.

214
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,108
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it was a thing of the day, too.

215
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

216
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,946
Speaker 1: It's actually probably from 1958, although it's a very small chance.

217
00:17:32,966 --> 00:17:46,250
Speaker 1: it's from '59, but the point is, this is a video from BBC One with Jimmy Page and his friends when he was 14 years old playing some Skittle on BBC One.

218
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,030
Speaker 0: It's quite interesting.

219
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:52,129
Speaker 0: I laughed out loud when Jimmy said something to the effect of, "I want to be a biological

220
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:52,965
Speaker 0: researcher.".

221
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you watch it and it's just some kids playing some music.

222
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,987
Speaker 1: It's like watching a 14-year-old music recital and you see Jimmy Page there and you're like, "Yep, that's him.

223
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, he still kind of danced around like that even when he was older.

224
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:08,466
Speaker 1: Yep, wow, look, he was playing music when he was

225
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:09,030
Speaker 1: 14.".

226
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:14,188
Speaker 1: And then, the guy on BBC interviews them and he's sort of a creepy British dude, but...

227
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:15,668
Speaker 0: Creepy?

228
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,890
Speaker 0: I don't get the creepy vibe at all.

229
00:18:17,251 --> 00:18:18,629
Speaker 1: I think he was a little weird.

230
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,129
Speaker 0: No, I just get the British vibe.

231
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,888
Speaker 0: He wasn't in any way creepy.

232
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:29,590
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess if you don't think so, but he interviews all the kids and they all want to be scientific researchers, which is pretty crazy.

233
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,470
Speaker 1: And the one kid who made his own bass, that was wet mad cool.

234
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:36,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was a pretty good bassist, too, from what little we could see.

235
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:36,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

236
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:47,069
Speaker 1: So, you know, Jimmy Page, god of guitar and rock, you can see him now when he was 14 years old playing music on BBC One.

237
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,870
Speaker 0: Thus, without further ado, there is no Geek Nights.

238
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,001
Speaker 0: There is only zeal.

239
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,710
Speaker 1: Well, they said, "Don't do any inside jokes.

240
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,901
Speaker 1: Do as many jokes as

241
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:01,184
Speaker 1: possible.".

242
00:19:01,772 --> 00:19:02,530
Speaker 0: Alright, I submit.

243
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:12,717
Speaker 0: See, there's a thing on Fark where someone will make an inside kind of joke and they'll put slash obscure question mark at the end, which is them saying, "I don't think anyone will get this

244
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:13,002
Speaker 0: joke.".

245
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,790
Speaker 0: The thing is, a lot of times people will say obscure about something that is so not obscure.

246
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:24,104
Speaker 0: That's like making a Star Wars joke and then saying, "You probably don't know what this is from, but Luke, I am your

247
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:24,609
Speaker 0: father.".

248
00:19:24,854 --> 00:19:25,309
Speaker 1: It's a trap.

249
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:46,850
Speaker 0: Anyway, so like we said, the idea to do this topic all basically came out of the fact that Anime World Order has asserted, and we've appeared on their show briefly, and then they've had some feedback against our ideas on their show, that fandom, now they say anime fandom, but we're going to broaden this to fandom in general, geek fandom.

250
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:47,570
Speaker 1: Geekery in general.

251
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:48,289
Speaker 0: All geekery.

252
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:48,648
Speaker 1: All schools.

253
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,889
Speaker 1: Everything we talk about.

254
00:19:50,470 --> 00:20:02,049
Speaker 0: That it's not the same as it used to be, that people don't have the zeal, we're going to use that, the word zeal, for the rest of this podcast to describe the wither all and energy and desire.

255
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:02,609
Speaker 1: Wherewithal.

256
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,207
Speaker 0: Wherewithal.

257
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:15,009
Speaker 0: To create content for other people, to try to do something, to create something in the world that says, "Look at me, look at what I did," or trying to make the world a better place in some way.

258
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:25,550
Speaker 1: Now let's start by going through the geekeries and quickly coming up with bunches of different ways that people involved in those geekeries express themselves creatively, right?

259
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,390
Speaker 0: Alright, we'll start with anime because that's the easiest.

260
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:29,230
Speaker 0: People cosplay.

261
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:31,349
Speaker 0: People make anime music videos.

262
00:20:31,794 --> 00:20:33,030
Speaker 0: They make fan parodies.

263
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,990
Speaker 0: They make things like AMV Hell.

264
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,930
Speaker 0: They go to conventions and run panels.

265
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,910
Speaker 0: They do podcasts such as Geek Nights or Anime World Order.

266
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,670
Speaker 1: They write fan fiction.

267
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,605
Speaker 1: They make fan art.

268
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,710
Speaker 1: They make doujinshi, which I guess is sort of fan art.

269
00:20:49,738 --> 00:20:51,690
Speaker 1: They run conventions themselves.

270
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,510
Speaker 0: Yes.

271
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:54,049
Speaker 0: They voice act.

272
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:03,630
Speaker 0: A lot of amateur voice actors got their start, definitely amateur voice actors, by just trying out and trying their best and practicing at conventions and getting some crap job somewhere.

273
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,270
Speaker 1: They create webcomics.

274
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,030
Speaker 1: They create, uh, they try to go to school to become animators.

275
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,290
Speaker 0: They create review sites.

276
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,309
Speaker 0: They create blogs.

277
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,950
Speaker 1: They do arts and crafts and different merchandise to sell in Artist Alley.

278
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,849
Speaker 0: Some of them create their own anime, aka the guy who did Hoshi no Koi and Place Promised in Early Days.

279
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:35,148
Speaker 1: There are millions and millions and millions of things, that was a little exaggeration, that fans and geeks of anime and other visual arts do to express themselves and to show their zeal.

280
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,390
Speaker 0: So taking the one percent rule, there's a lot of anime fans in the world.

281
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:51,030
Speaker 0: So even if only one percent of them are trying to create, that's a lot of people who have the zeal and the desire to create content related to their hobbies and their interests.

282
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,490
Speaker 1: Now let's go to the other geekeries, the technology people.

283
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,689
Speaker 1: They write software.

284
00:21:55,936 --> 00:21:56,410
Speaker 0: Open source.

285
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,250
Speaker 1: They build all of the Linux operating system.

286
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,029
Speaker 1: That's all geek zeal.

287
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,690
Speaker 1: One hundred percent geek zeal.

288
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,450
Speaker 0: You mean the GNU operating system running on the Linux kernel?

289
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:06,946
Speaker 1: Whatever.

290
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:08,248
Speaker 1: Shut up.

291
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,930
Speaker 1: They, all open source software is one hundred percent geek zeal.

292
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,190
Speaker 1: Then you've got people building their own computers.

293
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,430
Speaker 1: People modding their own computers.

294
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,590
Speaker 0: People war driving.

295
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:18,670
Speaker 0: People hacking.

296
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,210
Speaker 1: People, you know, hacking all sorts of devices in their houses.

297
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:23,490
Speaker 1: Make magazine.

298
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,369
Speaker 1: One hundred percent geek zeal.

299
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:26,340
Speaker 0: Freakers.

300
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,310
Speaker 1: It's, it, I think tech is just, there's so much.

301
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,170
Speaker 0: We can't even, there's no reason to even continue.

302
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,950
Speaker 0: Almost everything technologies do is effectively creating content.

303
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:36,670
Speaker 1: Yes.

304
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:38,569
Speaker 1: Uh, the gamers.

305
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,269
Speaker 1: Gamers do it too, man.

306
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:49,870
Speaker 1: I mean, they, you see guys modding their Xbox 360 cases, making video games, making mods to video games, making machinima with video games.

307
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,410
Speaker 0: Making music videos to cat girls in Final Fantasy 7 or Final Fantasy 11.

308
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,169
Speaker 1: Making flash animations of Mario in an epic, epic way.

309
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,650
Speaker 1: Remixing video game songs on OC Remix.

310
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:07,050
Speaker 0: Doing live Mario shows where people do things on stage.

311
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,830
Speaker 1: Hanging question blocks around town.

312
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,250
Speaker 0: Running video game or gaming conventions.

313
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:17,690
Speaker 0: Making role playing game systems like Burning Wheel.

314
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:19,730
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, those kind of gamers.

315
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,549
Speaker 1: God, people making up their own worlds to play RPGs in.

316
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,770
Speaker 0: Our friend Alex, who was our dungeon master, who created entire worlds purely for our enjoyment and also his enjoyment.

317
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,290
Speaker 1: Yes.

318
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,850
Speaker 1: Freaking making Katamari balls.

319
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,009
Speaker 0: And rolling them around at conventions, much to my- Rolling them around the city of San Francisco.

320
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,410
Speaker 0: Mega 64.

321
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,110
Speaker 1: Making stop motion animations of, you know, figures doing stuff.

322
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,469
Speaker 1: God, there's just so much.

323
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:46,969
Speaker 0: I think we've covered video games.

324
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:57,230
Speaker 1: The point is, is that there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many ways in which geeks use their zeal to create things.

325
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:04,310
Speaker 1: And even if it's only 1% of the geek population, it is so much more now than it ever was before.

326
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:09,310
Speaker 0: Now it seems to me that, I hate to keep ragging on Anime World Order, but again, they're the.

327
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,550
Speaker 1: That's the point of this episode.

328
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,709
Speaker 1: Let's go with it.

329
00:24:11,911 --> 00:24:13,669
Speaker 0: They're the ones who basically brought this up with us.

330
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:19,750
Speaker 0: Now their assertion seemed to be that fandom, they refer specifically to anime fandom, back

331
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:20,272
Speaker 1: in

332
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:36,009
Speaker 0: the day when it was difficult, when it was hard to be an anime fan and the technology wasn't there, they seemed to have this idea that the zeal was greater than and that the people who were involved had more zeal, more desire, more will to create something, to be something, to do something.

333
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:40,550
Speaker 0: And a lot of their evidence is, like anime music videos are the perfect example.

334
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,490
Speaker 0: Back in the day, anime music videos, honestly, were mostly terrible.

335
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,750
Speaker 0: It took months to create one.

336
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,530
Speaker 0: You had to sit there with a bunch of VCRs, pausing tapes and switching tapes in and out.

337
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,050
Speaker 1: And if you were lucky, you were at a college with some video editing hardware.

338
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,029
Speaker 1: You could have a computer that could edit video.

339
00:24:59,170 --> 00:24:59,888
Speaker 1: You had machines.

340
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:00,842
Speaker 0: Yep.

341
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:07,449
Speaker 0: And yet, nowadays, with technology, anyone can create an anime music video who has any amount of intelligence and skill.

342
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:14,149
Speaker 0: And thus, a lot of people who enjoy anime really want to contribute back or make something or do something.

343
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,610
Speaker 0: And they're making AMVs.

344
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:22,989
Speaker 0: I mean, there are so many thousands of anime music videos submitted to Otacon every year that they can't even show a small portion of them.

345
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:26,230
Speaker 1: Now of course, it's obvious, most of them are crap.

346
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,100
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say 99.9999% of them are crap.

347
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,989
Speaker 0: Now I would submit that even back in the day, the same percentage of everything created was crap.

348
00:25:36,592 --> 00:25:43,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, just because someone had to work harder to make something doesn't make that thing any better.

349
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,190
Speaker 0: Now we see this fallacy in a lot of fandoms.

350
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,430
Speaker 0: A lot of people will say, "Back in the day, it was better.

351
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:59,370
Speaker 0: It took me, I had to go to Japan and get the Famicom and get the game and take it home and sit there with a Japanese-to-English dictionary and translate it as I played it.

352
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,949
Speaker 0: And kids today don't have the zeal.

353
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,170
Speaker 0: They don't have to fight.

354
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,610
Speaker 0: They don't have to try and strive to get their video game.

355
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:08,606
Speaker 0: They can just buy it and there's a fan sub or a script and they can just download it and look at it.

356
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,090
Speaker 1: That means that their energy can go into something useful.

357
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,190
Speaker 0: Something creative.

358
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:19,510
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess, the main point Anime World Order made was that fans don't have the zeal anymore.

359
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:29,070
Speaker 0: And fans never really had the zeal to begin with, in my opinion, because if you're just a fan and nothing more, you were not creating anything, you were merely consuming.

360
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:36,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if you have to go through more effort to do your consuming, that just means you're a crazier fan willing to pay a higher price.

361
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:44,030
Speaker 1: When it was harder to be a fan, there were fewer fans, and only the crazy fans were fans and no one else could get access.

362
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:54,590
Speaker 1: Now that everyone has access, the total amount of zeal or fandom hasn't increased or decreased, it's just the barrier to entry has been lowered, which is always a good thing.

363
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:03,310
Speaker 0: Yep, and one of the points they made specifically with anime fandom again was that a lot of the evidences that we cite of zeal, they say, are crap.

364
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:09,290
Speaker 0: The big thing they keep saying is cosplay, that cosplay is a waste of energy and it's crap and people do it just to get attention.

365
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're pointing at people wearing Naruto headbands and stuff.

366
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,550
Speaker 0: Those people aren't cosplaying.

367
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:15,288
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

368
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:20,155
Speaker 1: If you ask them, if you see a guy walking around a convention with a Naruto headband and you say, "Hey, are you

369
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:20,738
Speaker 1: cosplaying?"

370
00:27:20,758 --> 00:27:22,868
Speaker 1: and he'll be like, "No, what's wrong with

371
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:22,989
Speaker 1: you?".

372
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:30,870
Speaker 1: It's the same as me wearing a Spider-Man shirt that me, I don't have one, but those Spider-Man shirts that look like a piece of Spider-Man's costume.

373
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:33,930
Speaker 0: Or I have a little Locust Cline thing on my cell phone.

374
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,189
Speaker 0: People don't say, "Oh, they don't make a big deal about it, just hang in

375
00:27:37,209 --> 00:27:37,310
Speaker 0: there.".

376
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not cosplaying as Locust Cline, he just has a Locust Cline memorabilia.

377
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:42,710
Speaker 0: I should cosplay as Locust Cline.

378
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:48,930
Speaker 1: The people who are cosplaying are freaking cosplaying and those are the only people who will say they are cosplaying.

379
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:55,230
Speaker 0: I mean, I used to stay in the suite with a bunch of crazy cosplayers and voice actors at Anime Central.

380
00:27:55,953 --> 00:28:05,150
Speaker 0: Not only would they spend months and months creating intricate, perfect costumes, but they would create another costume as a group at the convention every year.

381
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,130
Speaker 0: They all brought sewing machines.

382
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,550
Speaker 0: These people were dedicated and they were creating something purely for the enjoyment of other people and their own enjoyment.

383
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:20,023
Speaker 1: I think it's because Anime World Order, you know, they don't like cosplaying, you know, they have their search for the truth making fun of these people.

384
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:23,170
Speaker 1: and don't get us wrong, we don't like those people either.

385
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:28,009
Speaker 0: Many of the people we are talking about, we would also make fun of were we to meet them.

386
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,889
Speaker 1: But we do not begrudge them.

387
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,490
Speaker 1: You know, if someone else gets their happies from wearing Naruto headbands and being all silly, we don't care.

388
00:28:36,971 --> 00:28:53,470
Speaker 0: And if someone decides to take all of their zeal, all of their energy, that in the old days would have been wasted tracking down information on obscure anime so that they could watch it, on making costumes instead, now instead of being just a consumer, which is basically almost nothing, they are being a creator.

389
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,689
Speaker 0: They're being an interactor.

390
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:57,406
Speaker 0: They have moved into the upper 10% or the upper 1% of people.

391
00:28:58,090 --> 00:28:58,154
Speaker 1: Yep.

392
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:10,170
Speaker 1: And the thing is, you know, while the rule still stands that 1% of people actually make something and then 10% actually, you know, interact with it, that rule hasn't changed.

393
00:29:10,551 --> 00:29:18,649
Speaker 1: It's just that back in the day, you know, those 89% of people who were just viewing had to do something to view it.

394
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:26,444
Speaker 1: So it looked to you like 100% of the people had zeal and were doing creative works, when in fact, it was still the 1% rule.

395
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,429
Speaker 1: It hasn't changed at all.

396
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:36,030
Speaker 0: Now another issue that they brought up was that in any convention, it's not just anime, and they even admitted that this is broadly across all the geekeries.

397
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:57,589
Speaker 0: Any time there is a famous person or a convention or a guest at a convention or someone who is big in geekery, like the man who created Metal Gear Solid or the man who created Utena, it used to be back in the day that if someone like that came to a convention or came to America, all the fans of that thing who went could just talk to them.

398
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,569
Speaker 1: This doesn't really have to do with the zeal.

399
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:21,150
Speaker 0: Well it does in that nowadays, if you're just a fan, you can't have that kind of access anymore, and I guess, I don't know why you would expect it, because the people who get the access to the things are the people who have the zeal and try to create the content and try to be the people who will be doing that thing when the person they are a fan of passes on, the next generation.

400
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:32,388
Speaker 1: It's the 1% rule has always applied and still does apply, there are just so many more people now because the barrier to entry has been lowered, that the 1% is actually a bigger number.

401
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:34,640
Speaker 1: It's just shadowed because the 89% is also tremendously bigger.

402
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:55,030
Speaker 1: So before, you would have 100 guys at a convention, and one of them would actually be a creator, and the other 10% would be interactors, and 89 guys would look like they were creators because they were putting in a lot of work, but they weren't actually making anything.

403
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,670
Speaker 1: They were just basically, that's the equivalent of spending money, it's just back in the day.

404
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:02,050
Speaker 1: you didn't spend money to get stuff, you would just do work to get stuff.

405
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:16,429
Speaker 0: Now of course, as a very brief and important aside, don't think that we're saying that people who consume are bad or anything, because consuming things is a huge part of the world, and just because you are a content creator in one sphere doesn't mean that you're not a consumer in another sphere.

406
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:27,570
Speaker 1: Exactly, I could make video games and I've thought about it, and I've kind of slowly worked towards making a few sort of game things, but in video games I'm basically a consumer.

407
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:38,749
Speaker 0: Or like, we do a podcast, we have listeners who are purely consumers or at best interactors with our podcast, yet they are content creators of other spheres that we have nothing to do with.

408
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:55,791
Speaker 1: Yep, you know, just because someone might not be creating where you can see it, or you might not like what they're creating, or what they're creating isn't very good, doesn't mean they're not creating, it doesn't mean they don't have zeal, it just means that they suck.

409
00:31:56,173 --> 00:32:00,410
Speaker 1: or, you know, they're not working as hard but they're still able to produce something.

410
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:07,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean, someone who's trying to create content, that's one of the greatest things a human being can do, in my opinion, to try to create something.

411
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:13,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if it's a lot easier for them to do it, doesn't make it any less good.

412
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,930
Speaker 0: In fact, that just makes it possible for them to reach even further bounds and go even greater.

413
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:26,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, imagine if you had a one world where if you wanted to, here, let's use the guy who made his own base in that Jimmy Page video.

414
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:27,147
Speaker 0: Alright.

415
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:49,250
Speaker 1: You know, back in the day, he had to make his own base, so not so many people could be bass players, but at the same time, that guy had to spend time making his own base that he could have spent practicing, and as a result, you know, even though he had enough zeal to make his own base and play it, he didn't get as far as he could because he lost practice time out to making instruments.

416
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:56,546
Speaker 0: Now, now, there are many more people in the world, basses you can just buy in a music store, there are a lot more bass players now than there were, you know, 40, 50 years ago.

417
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,370
Speaker 1: And most of them suck.

418
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:11,268
Speaker 0: However, the ones that don't suck are in many cases better than the ones 40 and 50 years ago simply because they have to spend far less time accessing the content and they get to spend far more time creating it.

419
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:11,930
Speaker 1: Yep.

420
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:28,750
Speaker 1: And, you know, even though you might say, ah, there's less zeal now, it was, no, before it was just concentrated and there were people with zeal back in the day that just couldn't get it out because there was no outlet that was possible for them to get their zeal out.

421
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,950
Speaker 0: Or, like, anime fandom was very small, to use that as an example.

422
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:48,270
Speaker 0: So there were probably a lot of people who would have been content creators and who would have loved anime, but because they didn't have, they didn't know it existed, or the barrier to even being a consumer was so high, they had no chance to even find out that not only do they love anime, but they're gonna be the next Miyamoto.

423
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:48,373
Speaker 0: Yep.

424
00:33:49,434 --> 00:33:49,749
Speaker 1: It is.

425
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,890
Speaker 0: I don't know why I said Miyamoto.

426
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:52,830
Speaker 1: Miyazaki.

427
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,550
Speaker 0: I meant to say, yeah, Miyamoto, though, works because, you know, video games.

428
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if there's gonna be a next Miyamoto, what do we do?

429
00:34:00,592 --> 00:34:01,249
Speaker 0: Something'll happen.

430
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:09,389
Speaker 1: The point is, is that, you know, just because you might not like what someone creates, they're still creating.

432
00:34:10,152 --> 00:34:11,188
Speaker 0: And that's a wonderful thing.

433
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:12,590
Speaker 1: It's a very wonderful thing.

434
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:15,389
Speaker 1: And there are so many ways in which people create.

435
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:16,429
Speaker 1: Zillions.

436
00:34:16,952 --> 00:34:22,050
Speaker 0: I mean, think about, we could go on for an hour just about all the things that geeks do to create content.

437
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,949
Speaker 1: I mean, go on any blog, if you look on, like, Kotaku is a great example.

438
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,188
Speaker 1: That's a gaming blog.

439
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:43,130
Speaker 1: Sure, they, you know, they do news about video games and stuff, but about half the posts every day, which is basically the reason I read the site, is for these posts, are usually videos on YouTube depicting different geeky creative works relating to video games.

440
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:51,290
Speaker 0: I mean, one big example they were using a lot was that back in the day, Gainax created the Daikon animation, and that was an example of zeal.

441
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:54,850
Speaker 0: They sat there and they powered through and they created something to show to the world.

442
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:57,310
Speaker 1: That was very difficult to make and was very high quality.

443
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:09,950
Speaker 0: Nowadays, we have the Hoshino Koga as an example, who put the same amount of zeal in, but because he had better tools, better technology, and better access, with less effort, he was able to make something so much more amazing.

444
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:11,610
Speaker 0: And that's not the exception.

445
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,610
Speaker 0: I mean, how many animations are people just making and throwing on the internet?

446
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,610
Speaker 1: That you're not seeing, because, you know, they're not big releases.

447
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:28,750
Speaker 0: But they're all out there, and there's, I mean, look, we have two things of the day, every day, and many of them are things people have created that are in some way awesome.

448
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:29,418
Speaker 1: Yeah.

449
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:39,267
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, the Hoshino Koga guy is actually, you know, just because you don't see all the other animators out there, I mean, go to any college where there's an animation class.

450
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,390
Speaker 1: Every one of those kids is making crazy awesome animations constantly.

451
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:52,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, at one point I sat through the animation screenings at RIT one time, because I was working and I didn't have much to do, so I slipped out of the office and I slipped into one.

452
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:54,068
Speaker 0: And there was some amazing stuff.

453
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:59,590
Speaker 0: I mean, honestly, a lot of it, I mean, this was just like some kid's project.

454
00:36:00,653 --> 00:36:03,110
Speaker 0: It blew away the Daikon animation in my eyes.

455
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:03,739
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:36:04,211 --> 00:36:18,250
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on that you can't see, and just because now it's such a bigger picture that only the really good stuff shines through, you're missing out on a lot of other things that don't shine through.

457
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,643
Speaker 1: It's like saying, "Oh, no one makes movies anymore,".

458
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,630
Speaker 1: and you don't even know that the art theater exists.

459
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,430
Speaker 1: You know, you're only looking at the blockbuster theater.

460
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:36,050
Speaker 0: So I guess our main point is that it doesn't take zeal to be just a fan anymore, but being just a fan in and of itself, of anything, not anime, anything in the world, is nothing special.

461
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,089
Speaker 0: Anyone can be a fan.

462
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:49,609
Speaker 0: It's only special if you go beyond that to interact with whatever it is that you're a fan of, to try to create something new, or, in the very least, if you're one of those people who tries to spread the thing you like to other people, you've already moved into the interaction category.

463
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:53,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the people who are in, you know, the 89%, who don't do anything.

464
00:36:55,291 --> 00:36:56,330
Speaker 1: They just consume.

465
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:59,050
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with those people, and they don't have zeal.

466
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:03,010
Speaker 1: The 10% of people who interact, those are cool people.

467
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:09,730
Speaker 1: You hang out with them, you talk to them, but they don't really ever make anything, you know, they don't get famous, you know, whatever.

468
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,110
Speaker 0: But they're still creating things.

469
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:20,230
Speaker 0: I mean, we've, like, in Geek Nights, in our forums, there have been a lot of very well thought out arguments and posts in our forum that, in their own right, were amazing creations in my opinion.

470
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:27,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, a lot of the people who made those are people who are doing their share of creating in the 1% in some other category.

471
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:30,770
Speaker 1: Maybe they have a podcast somewhere else, or they're a webcomic artist.

472
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:38,370
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of our listeners do a lot of awesome things, and a lot of the emails and forum posts we get are people telling us about the awesome things they're doing.

473
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:46,027
Speaker 1: We did have a discussion in our forum at one point about whether being a geek was strictly a consumer culture.

474
00:37:46,913 --> 00:37:48,570
Speaker 1: Was geek culture a consumer culture?

475
00:37:48,631 --> 00:37:49,410
Speaker 1: That was the discussion.

476
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:55,429
Speaker 0: Yep, and the answer that we gave was that, no, most people are consumers, because that's how the world works.

477
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:58,809
Speaker 0: No matter how much you create, you will always consume more than you create.

478
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,770
Speaker 0: I mean, look at it on a global scale.

479
00:38:01,211 --> 00:38:02,530
Speaker 0: I don't create my own food.

480
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,390
Speaker 0: I consume it, and I have no input into the food industry.

481
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,950
Speaker 0: I didn't build my own house.

482
00:38:07,131 --> 00:38:07,650
Speaker 0: I consume a house.

483
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:10,230
Speaker 1: Other than the capitalist invisible hand.

484
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but I'm making a broad brush point here.

485
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,250
Speaker 1: Here we go with the broad ass brush.

486
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:18,143
Speaker 0: I don't create content.

487
00:38:18,324 --> 00:38:19,530
Speaker 0: on a lot of tech sites.

488
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:23,210
Speaker 0: I read the content, because I can't create everything.

489
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:28,408
Speaker 0: I create the things I can create, I consume the things I can't, and I interact with the things I wish I could.

490
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:29,426
Speaker 1: There you go.

491
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:30,768
Speaker 0: That's the way I would put it.

492
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,558
Speaker 0: And 89% of geeks are content consumers.

493
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:37,090
Speaker 0: 89% of people are content consumers.

494
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,750
Speaker 1: Yep, a geek is just someone who's into something.

495
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,610
Speaker 1: You know, you might be a guy just buying Gundam robots, for example.

496
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,309
Speaker 0: Well, remember, a geek is someone who's into something, and a nerd is someone who's equally into something.

497
00:38:48,651 --> 00:38:52,670
Speaker 0: But a geek will get along with other geeks of different interests, and a nerd won't.

498
00:38:53,058 --> 00:38:53,407
Speaker 1: Here we go.

499
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:54,810
Speaker 1: Here's a great example.

500
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,108
Speaker 1: Because the Gundam robot.

501
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:01,090
Speaker 1: Because Gundam robots are something with which we can cover all three categories of people.

502
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:01,849
Speaker 0: Very true.

503
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,770
Speaker 0: You want to talk about Tom and his awesome Gundams?

504
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:04,567
Speaker 1: Yes, I am.

505
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:05,087
Speaker 1: All right.

506
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:10,150
Speaker 1: So, 89% of people, you take out about all the people in the world who are into Gundam robots, right?

507
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:10,589
Speaker 1: The models.

508
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:13,550
Speaker 1: 89% of them buy the models and put them together.

509
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:14,808
Speaker 1: That's me.

510
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:16,270
Speaker 1: Those people are consumers.

511
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:26,469
Speaker 1: 10% of the people who are into Gundam robots will not only buy them and put them together, but they might play with them, or make, you know, something else with them, or...

512
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:32,184
Speaker 0: Or run a panel on making them, or talk to people at a panel about making them, or share their...

513
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,010
Speaker 1: Or they'll just be on a forum online where people talk about Gundam robots.

514
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, "Hey, I built an awesome Gundam robot.

515
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,228
Speaker 0: Hey, so did I.

516
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,129
Speaker 0: Awesome.".

517
00:39:38,129 --> 00:39:48,950
Speaker 1: 1% of the people will make their own Gundam robots, or make incredible modifications to them, or enter the model contest at different conventions, and all that crazy stuff.

518
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:59,050
Speaker 1: You know, you can see how, you know, you can miss where the zeal is when you have such a broad group of people in different categories that all look the same.

519
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:14,830
Speaker 1: And you know, if you're not looking for the zeal, and you don't, maybe you don't like Gundam robots, then you'll totally miss what's going on, and you know, it's sort of like if your vision is too narrow, you won't notice things that are, you know, happening.

520
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:17,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, words, losing, not have.

521
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:26,050
Speaker 0: And I think that's one of the main reasons why geek culture seems to be expanding so rapidly, in that all geek conventions seem to be slowly converging.

522
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:45,450
Speaker 0: I mean, gaming conventions always have anime, anime conventions always have gaming and video gaming, video game conventions always have some sci-fi, everything's converging because any geek who creates things within geekery, or is interested in something, can recognize other geeks who are interested in other things, even if those things are completely unrelated.

523
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,110
Speaker 1: Even the Super Dollfie people are making something.

524
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'll admit right now, I don't like Super Dollfie.

525
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,949
Speaker 1: I hate Super Dollfie, and people who make Super Dollfie are scary, usually, and they kind of freak me out.

526
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:56,789
Speaker 1: But you know what?

527
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:03,790
Speaker 1: I will not deny their creative skills and their zeal for making little, you know, costumes to put on ball-jointed dolls.

528
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,470
Speaker 0: I have a lot of respect for those people, because they put a lot of time and effort into their hobby, and it's really an impressive thing.

529
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:16,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it wouldn't be any less impressive if they somehow had, you know, used a sewing machine instead of sewing by hand.

530
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it's like, you know, you're in math class in high school, and they let you use calculators now.

531
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:28,270
Speaker 0: Now a lot of people argue that, yeah, because people have to use calculators, everything's easier now, and kids don't learn as much.

532
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:38,609
Speaker 0: But at the same time, because kids' minds are freed from doing the mundane adding and subtracting and integrating over and over and over again, they can explore much more advanced concepts.

533
00:41:39,293 --> 00:41:39,335
Speaker 1: Mm?

534
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:40,289
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

535
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:55,470
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess in some, because we're actually going to try to stay on schedule tonight, our argument basically is that the zeal is here and has always been here, the amount of zeal has never changed, there are just, in fact, I would say that the amount of zeal has increased because there are more people total.

536
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:01,326
Speaker 0: So if there are more people, 1% of those people is also a greater number, so a greater number of people have zeal.

537
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:12,130
Speaker 1: It's just that back in the day, a lot of zeal was bottled up, because the barrier to entry was too high, so people with a little bit of zeal, or a medium amount of zeal, couldn't use it for anything, because it was too hard.

538
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:18,708
Speaker 1: And the only people who actually got their zeal expressed were the people who had insane amounts of zeal in them.

539
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:27,130
Speaker 0: Yep, if you only had 10 points of zeal, and it took 9 points to watch anime, you only had one more point to spend on trying to create anything anime related.

540
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,910
Speaker 0: Nowadays it costs 0 points to be an anime fan.

541
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,890
Speaker 0: You can spend all 10 of your points running an anime convention.

542
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:33,490
Speaker 1: Yep.

543
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:56,010
Speaker 1: So it might look like there's less zeal, because there are plenty of people doing something that used to take a lot of zeal to do, and these people don't seem to have the same zeal that was had before, because maybe, you know, back in the day, only people with 20 points of zeal were in there, and now there's a zillion people who only have 2 points of zeal in there.

544
00:42:56,491 --> 00:43:00,610
Speaker 1: But 2 times a zillion that used to be bottled up is now released.

545
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:09,030
Speaker 0: And now I would submit that most of the zeal is spent on pursuits that are much more useful to mankind, or much more creative.

546
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:12,769
Speaker 0: People are creating things instead of spending energy to consume them.

547
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:14,821
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

548
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:22,350
Speaker 0: So I guess my final thought here would simply be, I urge all of you, we generally don't get very preachy on Geek Nights, but go out and create something.

549
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:31,230
Speaker 0: That's the one thing, if nothing else in the world, that's the one thing you can do to stand out from the other 6-7 billion people on this planet.

550
00:43:31,831 --> 00:43:52,490
Speaker 1: Think about what you do in your life, and if you're just consuming and listening to podcasts, and reading blogs, and buying things, and watching them, and playing video games, and you don't make anything or do anything, take the first step and join our forum, or start a blog, or even a live journal, or something.

551
00:43:52,893 --> 00:43:53,508
Speaker 0: Do something.

552
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,929
Speaker 0: A GeoCities website.

553
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:57,710
Speaker 1: Is GeoCities still around?

554
00:43:57,832 --> 00:43:58,167
Speaker 1: Yes.

555
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,569
Speaker 0: In fact, some of my files are still up there.

556
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:06,510
Speaker 1: Do something to get yourself into the 10% of people interacting with.

557
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:12,591
Speaker 1: And once you're there, and you're comfortable, then go for the 1%.

558
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:17,988
Speaker 1: You mean, what's the point of living if you're just going to be one of the 89% of people who sucks?

559
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,539
Speaker 0: Yep.

560
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:26,030
Speaker 0: I mean, I've actually been very energized about this topic lately, because, and I'm going to plug it again, I've been listening to this 12 Byzantine Emperors podcast.

561
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,349
Speaker 1: I'm going to have to describe this damn thing, so make you shut up.

562
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,510
Speaker 0: And it's just- I'm going to do it right now.

563
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:35,569
Speaker 0: And I've also been reading a lot about Roman and Byzantine history, because they're subjects that I knew from Quiz Bowl.

564
00:44:35,972 --> 00:44:43,346
Speaker 0: Like, I could name a bunch of Roman Emperors and what they did, and I could name a bunch of Roman generals and what they did, and I could name a bunch of dates and what happened on them.

565
00:44:43,950 --> 00:45:01,629
Speaker 0: But I didn't know a lot about the details of what was going on, and the more I studied, the history of Rome condensed into a tiny little nutshell of a thimble is that the people who changed everything were the people who had the zeal to go out, and a lot of people died because it took a lot of zeal to get anywhere.

566
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:06,369
Speaker 0: But all of history back then was individual men convincing other people to do great things.

567
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:07,613
Speaker 0: Yup.

568
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:10,949
Speaker 0: So I'm on this kick of creating things.

569
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,850
Speaker 1: We've connected it to history, I think we're done.

570
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:13,447
Speaker 0: Yes.

571
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,689
Speaker 0: All we gotta do is Godwin it, and we're out.

572
00:45:17,274 --> 00:45:18,250
Speaker 0: Hitler had a lot of zeal.

573
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:18,777
Speaker 1: Whoo!

574
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:20,330
Speaker 1: Godwin alert.

575
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:21,210
Speaker 1: Godwin alert.

576
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,290
Speaker 1: Is Godwin an inside joke?

577
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,949
Speaker 1: I guess people who don't know about it.

578
00:45:26,451 --> 00:45:26,806
Speaker 0: I don't know.

579
00:45:27,431 --> 00:45:29,850
Speaker 0: I guess that'll be our final question, is Godwin an inside joke?

580
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,109
Speaker 0: Well no, my final question is, through Anime World Order, can you rebut this?

581
00:45:35,371 --> 00:45:35,685
Speaker 0: I don't know.

582
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:50,130
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna have to put this whole thing on hold, and then at Otakon, we're gonna have to sit down with them two on two and record, you know, the ultimate debate of- The ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny.

583
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:50,695
Speaker 1: Yeah.

584
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:51,941
Speaker 1: Doo-wee!

585
00:45:54,487 --> 00:45:54,740
Speaker 1: Awesome.

586
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,320
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

587
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,959

Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
