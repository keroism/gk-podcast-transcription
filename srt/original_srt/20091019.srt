00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,264
Speaker 0: We'll talk about all that.

28
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:19,800
Speaker 0: you know when we do our state of the podcast whatever on Halloween, but What's funny is that right after that we ended up having to miss a week of shows for completely unrelated reasons?

29
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, like out of nowhere.

30
00:01:23,089 --> 00:01:23,369
Speaker 0: You know.

31
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,355
Speaker 0: so Monday, and we're did the show on that but Didn't get home from work at any reasonable time because what was it?

32
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:32,680
Speaker 0: Amtrak hit some dude?

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, train the other.

34
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:40,600
Speaker 1: see we'd ride the Metro North trains But there's occasionally a few times a day Amtrak trains lose the second.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:48,172
Speaker 1: I was like occasionally a few times the day Amtrak hits someone they use the same tracks So the basically all the Metro North trains just move out of the way.

36
00:01:48,232 --> 00:01:51,887
Speaker 1: the Amtrak goes whoosh real fast And then the Metro North's move again.

37
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:54,517
Speaker 1: the Amtrak train hit somebody.

38
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:59,107
Speaker 0: now the worst thing It's so bad is bad.

39
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,736
Speaker 1: someone actually got hit and it's serious and we're making hockey jokes.

40
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:02,740
Speaker 0: the worst thing is though.

41
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:12,616
Speaker 0: I was on my train and trains don't back up but my trained like came to a stop suddenly and Then backed up to another station and the conductor the whole time they wouldn't tell anyone what was going on.

42
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:16,271
Speaker 1: our conductor was like Yeah, an Amtrak train hit a car or something.

43
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,455
Speaker 1: We don't know how long I'm gonna be here.

44
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:23,618
Speaker 0: Yeah But we'll tell that story because it's kind of the point of the show, but that aside all right.

45
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,100
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday.

46
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,083
Speaker 0: We decide I'll do a show anyway.

47
00:02:27,123 --> 00:02:31,330
Speaker 0: No Scott does late getting home cuz car battery was dead.

48
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:35,530
Speaker 1: Ah Someone left my reading.

49
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,077
Speaker 1: Someone.

50
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:44,588
Speaker 0: the passenger side reading lamp was left on except that you hadn't driven anyone around in like forever.

51
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,550
Speaker 1: It's all I'll say.

52
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:47,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone did it.

53
00:02:47,516 --> 00:02:48,320
Speaker 1: That's all I'll say.

54
00:02:50,412 --> 00:02:52,804
Speaker 0: Of course Scott was incapable of dealing with this on his own.

55
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,850
Speaker 1: no not really.

56
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:58,608
Speaker 0: So I actually had a rollerblade all the way home the next day to get a car.

57
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:03,890
Speaker 1: You've been rolling home anyway your car head doesn't even work, and then you even try to fix it.

58
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,750
Speaker 0: There's a difference between rollerblading with like a backpack with like a suit in it and rollerblading with a car battery.

59
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:11,612
Speaker 1: It's all it's.

60
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,077
Speaker 1: it's like a little motorcycle.

61
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,624
Speaker 0: You try rollerblading with that thing that things heavy.

62
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:19,874
Speaker 1: I can't rollerblade naked so It's not gonna help.

63
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:21,279
Speaker 0: so it took two.

64
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:23,930
Speaker 1: actually it might help because it helped me balance a little bit.

65
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,628
Speaker 1: I go all slow and sort of shuffle with it and use it to you know move the center of gravity about.

66
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:34,408
Speaker 0: so it took Two days for Scott to sort that out, but yeah, that's done, and you know all these other things happen all weeks.

67
00:03:34,468 --> 00:03:38,043
Speaker 0: moving Moving didn't actually interrupt geek nights at all.

68
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:42,566
Speaker 1: yeah even though You know it is sort of occupying all of my free time.

69
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:47,721
Speaker 1: just now I was calculating my moving expenses, which are greatly inflated Scott.

70
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,890
Speaker 0: it cost us like four grand to move out of Rochester.

71
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

72
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:55,326
Speaker 1: You know how much fucking like curtains cost goddamn.

73
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:55,687
Speaker 0: Yes.

74
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:56,310
Speaker 0: Yes, I do.

75
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,689
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about making my own curtains.

76
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:10,614
Speaker 1: I might have to because the cost of them is just too much and the size is that they don't sell the size I need and the custom size ones are like fuck all bajillion dollars, so Like they can't.

77
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:15,437
Speaker 1: I'm gonna have to delay on like the couch and the TV for like a month or two because just forget the curtains.

78
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:21,625
Speaker 1: for now It's like I don't care there's no one.

79
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,089
Speaker 1: I'm not worried.

80
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:31,120
Speaker 1: Looking in it's mostly an issue of if I don't want the Sun in my eyes I can't make it go away cuz the other day You know I was walking home from like the fancy part of the like.

81
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,250
Speaker 1: it'd be hard to sleep if like this lights of the City are blasting into my window.

82
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:44,651
Speaker 0: I was walking home through like the Washington Square like super fancy brownstones in Manhattan And I realized none of the rich people there have curtains their blinds No Nothing.

83
00:04:44,892 --> 00:04:51,410
Speaker 0: all those super rich people like with those giant like dude lives in a whole brownstone by himself like all floors of it.

84
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:54,683
Speaker 0: They just have their windows open to show off.

85
00:04:54,723 --> 00:05:04,624
Speaker 0: and as I walk by you know at night I could see all the op lii opulence in there and all the rich people sitting around being rich Man, this one guy's brown on the third floor.

86
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:05,610
Speaker 1: No one can see my shit.

87
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:08,560
Speaker 0: I could see up into other like third fourth floor even.

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,025
Speaker 0: but there's one guy like.

89
00:05:10,065 --> 00:05:11,390
Speaker 0: he had a living room.

90
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:22,167
Speaker 0: He our entire house would fit inside of his brownstone, and he had like Opulent decadent like mirror candle things everywhere all these fancy antiques all over the place.

91
00:05:22,247 --> 00:05:25,637
Speaker 1: you sure that wasn't like You know a clubhouse as opposed.

92
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:25,978
Speaker 0: Yes.

93
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:30,010
Speaker 0: I'm absolutely sure it was just some guy's house in the front of the window.

94
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:38,255
Speaker 0: Like to top it all off that this old-school looking wrought-iron kind of birdcage like you see in movies and in it the fanciest Most like.

95
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:39,902
Speaker 0: I'm richer than you looking bird.

96
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,570
Speaker 0: I have ever seen Faberge bird.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,015
Speaker 1: Faberge bird All right desire reminds me of this article I read today's.

98
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:47,970
Speaker 1: you know just one of those internet things people write.

99
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:49,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know some blog post or whatever.

100
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:57,219
Speaker 1: But the guy in his blog post he was basically talking about how like when you make a business you have to decide at the beginning If your goal is rich or king.

101
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,076
Speaker 1: and rich means you're going for the money And you don't give a shit about anything else.

102
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:05,032
Speaker 1: and king means you're gonna be like the king of X You know.

103
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,144
Speaker 1: like for example like Facebook is king.

104
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:14,499
Speaker 1: right king of social networking You Know but you can tell because like you know the founder of Facebook He stayed on.

105
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,726
Speaker 1: if he was about rich He would have bailed as soon as he got mad money.

106
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:21,510
Speaker 1: so right He says you have to decide from the beginning whether you're going for Richard King.

107
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:23,761
Speaker 0: I'm going for rich King or out.

108
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,043
Speaker 1: Yeah.

109
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:27,590
Speaker 1: He says if you go for King You know riches is definitely a possibility.

110
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,084
Speaker 1: But he talks about he unabashedly went for rich and got it and how.

111
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,190
Speaker 1: when he sold his company people gave him all this shit.

112
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,467
Speaker 1: But the thing is in this article he had his graph and the graph was pretty much like at.

113
00:06:38,507 --> 00:06:43,810
Speaker 1: the x-axis Was how much money you make and the y-axis is like effect on your life, right?

114
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:48,430
Speaker 1: So basically the graph was like, you know, it was going up towards a million dollars.

115
00:06:48,550 --> 00:07:06,830
Speaker 1: And as it went towards a million dollars, it was like, you know, you can eat you can buy a house You can you know own a car, you know, and then somewhere past like 1 million dollars It shot up right and then it crossed this line and the line was never need to worry about money again.

116
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:15,030
Speaker 1: And then the line sort of got towards the top and tapered off again, and then it reached the final point which is private jet.

117
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:18,285
Speaker 0: So you've been on and on with these private jets lately.

118
00:07:18,326 --> 00:07:21,239
Speaker 1: I know right It's the private basically shows you.

119
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:25,998
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, it's like money, you know as you get more money It doesn't really change your lifestyle.

120
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:29,110
Speaker 1: that significantly just changes how fancy your shit is.

121
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:42,550
Speaker 1: And then at a certain point you never have to worry about money again And then more money beyond that doesn't really change anything either, you know It's like is it is like this one spot where having more money like it's holy shit.

122
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,064
Speaker 1: And then after that, it's like, you know, so that's why he's like.

123
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:49,384
Speaker 1: I sold my business I got so many millions whatever and he's like.

124
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:50,770
Speaker 1: I never had to worry about money again.

125
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,697
Speaker 1: So why would I hold out for more?

126
00:07:52,757 --> 00:07:56,250
Speaker 1: It's like I had it there any more than that wouldn't have made a real difference.

127
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:59,450
Speaker 1: You know, I was going for rich I wasn't going for King.

128
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:01,897
Speaker 0: So what are we going for with geek nights?

129
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,182
Speaker 1: He ignites his King.

130
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:04,407
Speaker 1: something else has got to be rich.

131
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:08,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Could settle for Duke Duke.

132
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,962

00:08:56,479 --> 00:08:57,663
Speaker 0: So should I wait though?

150
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,330
Speaker 0: Cuz this could be a whole Thursday show.

151
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:00,234
Speaker 0: It's quite a story.

152
00:09:00,516 --> 00:09:02,104
Speaker 1: How could it be so much of a story?

153
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:03,350
Speaker 0: It's like the bamboo and the vision.

154
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,360
Speaker 0: It's one of those kind of.

155
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:05,208
Speaker 1: is that big?

156
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,690
Speaker 1: How long is this confrontation?

157
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:15,650
Speaker 0: I have a lot to say Around like I have this cycle out like analysis of the dude cuz I got to encounter the dude who stole my bike.

158
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,834
Speaker 1: Kind of dude was he?

159
00:09:17,215 --> 00:09:29,030
Speaker 0: I'll tell you this my analysis of him is he is a kind of thuggish 28 to 30 year old African American loser guy going nowhere who is a habitual thief of opportunity.

160
00:09:31,173 --> 00:09:36,080
Speaker 0: He's also a coward Of course, but that wasn't a coward.

161
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:37,486
Speaker 1: He wouldn't be a thief of opportunity.

162
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:38,410
Speaker 1: He'd be thief of initiative.

163
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:48,739
Speaker 0: but at the same time I will say that him being a coward and Not calling my bluff is the only way I avoided having to fight with this guy who was almost a foot taller than me.

164
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were gonna use your kung fu.

165
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:52,974
Speaker 1: What happened to that big exercise?

166
00:09:52,994 --> 00:09:54,560
Speaker 1: weightlifting kung fu man?

167
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,407
Speaker 0: I was totally set to fight him.

168
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,034
Speaker 0: you realize my bluff because I bluff.

169
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:11,180
Speaker 0: I had this huge bluff which is the only reason I really got the bike back, but The blood he bent your handlebars Actually didn't know but he put electrical tape all over the bike to try to disguise it so I wouldn't notice it.

170
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:15,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, never mind the fact that he parked it right next to where he fucking stole it from.

171
00:10:16,101 --> 00:10:20,999
Speaker 1: I kind of like it when the bike has electrical tape all over it though that I took the electrical tape off.

172
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,220
Speaker 1: Jesus I like the electrical tape styling.

173
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:33,371
Speaker 0: That's the styling of either one hipster guy who thinks it's cool to be a bike messenger even though it's kind of a dying Career or to dude what fucking stole my bike.

174
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:38,112
Speaker 1: There's also the third style of like delivery, dude That's the hipster, dude.

175
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:41,139
Speaker 1: Yeah Like messenger whatever.

176
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,091
Speaker 0: But basically my bluff was not.

177
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:45,700
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get the bike with this bluff.

178
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,523
Speaker 0: My bluff was.

179
00:10:46,543 --> 00:10:50,800
Speaker 0: I need to distract him long enough to be ready to punch a motherfucker in the face.

180
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,973
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was ready to fight him, but I didn't have to because I bluffed.

181
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,799
Speaker 0: moral of the story always blow.

182
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,060
Speaker 1: The thing is fighting is probably a really bad idea because like even if he stole your shit if you fight him That's probably gonna get you in trouble.

183
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:08,820
Speaker 0: I was not worried about that at all because one I probably could have taken him and two there's no one around.

184
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,150
Speaker 0: So as long as I take him, I just take the bike and that's the end of it.

185
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess yeah What's he gonna do?

186
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:14,548
Speaker 1: call the police?

187
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,939
Speaker 1: I stole this dude's bike and he beat me up.

188
00:11:16,145 --> 00:11:19,774
Speaker 0: Yeah Plus self-defense because basically my whole plan.

189
00:11:19,834 --> 00:11:25,093
Speaker 0: every anytime I encounter Like this level of person the kind of person who I might have to fight.

190
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:28,699
Speaker 1: I Always go for the mean bean machine.

191
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:36,884
Speaker 0: Not only that but it's always the situation where I definitely will put myself in the situation where I am Defending myself.

192
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,371
Speaker 0: the other person attacked me.

193
00:11:38,773 --> 00:11:40,160
Speaker 1: That's obviously a good idea.

194
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:52,633
Speaker 0: My whole kung fu strategy because you know, I learned enough kung fu I know like stuff My whole strategy is to wait for them to throw the first punch and do that crane spreads its wings things to basically knock Them out with their first punch.

195
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,782
Speaker 0: That's it It'll.

196
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:56,327
Speaker 0: but you want to try it on me try to punch me.

197
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:56,989
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

198
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:59,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll punch you with my gun.

199
00:11:59,256 --> 00:12:13,519
Speaker 0: Yes I bet you will lose your thief of opportunity who steals a 15 year old busted-ass bike from the train station and Isn't smart enough to sell it or to at least not park it from at the place where he stole it.

200
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,299
Speaker 0: I'm not too worried about him having a gun.

201
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:18,620
Speaker 1: He could have stolen it in an opportunistic fashion.

202
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,283
Speaker 0: But Scott in close quarters like that if you don't or anyone if you don't already have a gun out and pointed at the person You're fighting with.

203
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:26,013
Speaker 0: that gun is not a factor in the fight.

204
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:29,590
Speaker 1: Yeah That's why you run away like you're a coward.

205
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:42,000
Speaker 0: then you turn around and start walking in And then the other guy's got to run away, yeah Thing is my bluff pretty much Obviated that but I'm gonna save the story for Thursday cuz I got pictures and everything.

206
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,227
Speaker 1: You took pictures dude while he was the head and

207
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:57,312
Speaker 0: now I didn't because but I took pictures of the bike and like all the stuff he did to it because it's it's pretty sad how he disguised the bike like all the Everything about this dude reeks of sad, dude.

208
00:12:57,352 --> 00:12:58,857
Speaker 0: His life is never gonna go anywhere.

209
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,590
Speaker 0: Yeah But at least he didn't have to fight me.

210
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:03,700
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some news.

211
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:08,111
Speaker 1: Monday tech news is is a pretty obvious news.

212
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,140
Speaker 1: is the droid coming to the horizon?

213
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:13,997
Speaker 0: Is it not the drugs you're looking for?

214
00:13:14,098 --> 00:13:14,340
Speaker 1: one thing?

215
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,547
Speaker 1: I thought was weird and that my co-worker agreed.

216
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:22,298
Speaker 1: was they put out this commercial right and I watched the commercial and it was like iPhone doesn't do this.

217
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,829
Speaker 1: iPhone doesn't have a real keyboard iPhone.

218
00:13:25,869 --> 00:13:29,020
Speaker 1: You can't replace the battery iPhone and it's all true, right?

219
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,700
Speaker 1: And it was actually cut kind of good that people were actually doing this sort of like direct Point out the flaws and Apple's shit to the general public.

220
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,137
Speaker 1: I like that because you know that stuff that normal people can understand and that they don't really think about.

221
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:45,293
Speaker 1: but tech people all know And we need you know companies.

222
00:13:45,353 --> 00:13:46,380
Speaker 1: if you're gonna fight Apple.

223
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:47,219
Speaker 1: That's what you got to do.

224
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,855
Speaker 1: You got to do the same shit Apple does to Microsoft.

225
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,532
Speaker 1: where they're like Windows gets all kinds of viruses.

226
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:56,920
Speaker 1: You gotta be like hey MacBook, you know iPhone battery life not so good.

227
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,000
Speaker 1: You got to do the same shit to them because there are plenty of flaws in Apple products that just no one talks about.

228
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,370
Speaker 0: But no everyone tries to ape.

229
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:04,780
Speaker 0: Apple is kind of like all the MMOs.

230
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,593
Speaker 0: They try to be World of Warcraft instead of just saying wow sucks.

231
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,075
Speaker 0: We're different.

232
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,240
Speaker 0: play this exactly.

233
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:11,350
Speaker 0: They're like, we're almost like wow, we're cheaper.

234
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,706
Speaker 1: All right, so you got a point, you know This is the right kind of marketing.

235
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:17,960
Speaker 1: but the thing is they didn't show the fucking phone in the ad.

236
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:18,863
Speaker 1: It's like.

237
00:14:19,084 --> 00:14:25,190
Speaker 1: not only do you have to bash Apple right you also have to come and say yeah Well, we got this we got this.

238
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:26,800
Speaker 1: if you go watch the Steve Jobs keynote.

239
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:30,060
Speaker 1: He says like amazing and fantastic like, you know a hundred times.

240
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,379
Speaker 1: He's like check out our amazing this and our fantastic that you got to both.

241
00:14:34,182 --> 00:14:40,800
Speaker 1: Right, you got to ape them and smash them because smashing them is aping them you see because they smash Microsoft and Windows.

242
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:51,960
Speaker 1: So if you want to you have to ape their style and smile anyway, so yeah I'm not getting another phone until like the middle of next year, but if I had to get one now, it's looking pretty good.

243
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,539
Speaker 1: I mean the Verizon data network.

244
00:14:54,082 --> 00:15:06,287
Speaker 1: I think technically according to benchmarks isn't as fast as the Sprint one but just overall the Verizon network is about a bajillion times more reliable than everyone else's network and It's an Android phone.

245
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:11,188
Speaker 1: It looks like it's gonna you know be pretty Good as far as Android phones go.

246
00:15:11,268 --> 00:15:13,455
Speaker 1: I mean the other Android phones.

247
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:19,460
Speaker 1: I'll have like these arm CPUs But this one has the same CPU that the iPhone and the prehab.

248
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,850
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be a lot faster than the other Android phones.

249
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,056
Speaker 1: It's gonna have the new Android OS.

250
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:28,540
Speaker 1: It's got a real keyboard You know, it's got a nice touchscreen.

251
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:31,460
Speaker 1: People who've used it say it's pretty awesome.

252
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:35,352
Speaker 1: I'm really thinking that Android's gonna gonna be the way to go.

253
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,280
Speaker 1: just cuz Google's coming on so strong.

254
00:15:37,601 --> 00:15:38,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's hard to say though.

255
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:39,892
Speaker 0: I mean really.

256
00:15:39,912 --> 00:15:41,680
Speaker 1: I mean like really when I'm sitting at a computer.

257
00:15:42,462 --> 00:15:43,185
Speaker 1: I mean like Google.

258
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:44,288
Speaker 1: they determined what it's like.

259
00:15:44,348 --> 00:15:46,836
Speaker 1: six percent of all internet traffic period is Google.

260
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:48,786
Speaker 1: So having a phone That's Google.

261
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:50,239
Speaker 1: That's fucking useful as all hell.

262
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:54,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially since it looks like Google is integrating less and less with the iPhone.

263
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,005
Speaker 0: It's like considering like outside of work.

264
00:15:56,246 --> 00:16:00,800
Speaker 0: the vast majority of the work I do for geek nights is basically through Google tools.

265
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, as I plan conventions and email people.

266
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,508
Speaker 0: Yep so the thing is what we.

267
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:11,087
Speaker 0: what will really be the factor aside from this coming out is When the next web OS phone comes out.

268
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:12,794
Speaker 0: cuz web OS is not a player yet.

269
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:14,099
Speaker 0: It's just on one phone.

270
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:17,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I wonder what's gonna happen.

271
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder if it's gonna.

272
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:26,308
Speaker 0: I think in the end we're gonna see a huge huge drop-off of Apple iPhone and a big Well, you know, it's.

273
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:30,950
Speaker 1: it's actually kind of interesting like where people are, you know There's like a lot of different angles on it, right?

274
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,020
Speaker 1: There's the angle of you know, like, okay So which which persons are gonna buy which phones and you think about it?

275
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:44,607
Speaker 1: The most smartphones are actually probably sold to people who are like becoming 18 or like leaving college.

276
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:49,986
Speaker 1: right because it's like okay you're you're 18. now It's like so.

277
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:53,820
Speaker 1: you're probably gonna get some presents you're gonna go to college something like that, right?

278
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,655
Speaker 1: You've probably just had a phone phone for the you know, just texting and calling.

279
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,844
Speaker 1: you didn't have a smartphone yet Cuz you're a poor kid.

280
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:06,387
Speaker 1: now you're gonna get you know a phone for college or whatever iPhone is probably gonna win them over.

281
00:17:06,448 --> 00:17:08,896
Speaker 0: see except there's growing like normal.

282
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:14,680
Speaker 0: people that I talk to More and more are very cognizant of the AT&T is shitty problem.

283
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:19,519
Speaker 1: It is and that's why everything hinges on the iPhone being on non AT&T.

284
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,531
Speaker 0: I hear people saying things now constantly like I would get an a phone but iPhone a phone But AT&T.

285
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:27,499
Speaker 0: I can't deal with them.

286
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:30,369
Speaker 1: I know right and the thing is you and more and more like.

287
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:31,935
Speaker 0: as a secondary part of that.

288
00:17:32,256 --> 00:17:36,471
Speaker 0: those same people will then say Things like you know Sprint isn't looking so bad anymore.

289
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:38,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like Sprint was looking really terrible.

290
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:41,694
Speaker 1: The thing with Sprint is like their data networks looking really good.

291
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:46,933
Speaker 1: Their pricing is looking All right, the customer service is well, no one has good customer service.

292
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:47,735
Speaker 0: So I've given up on.

293
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,120
Speaker 0: the thing is I don't need customer service.

294
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,720
Speaker 0: I've decided yeah, really like I want to do a show on this.

295
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,380
Speaker 0: I've realized that I do not require customer service anymore and it is not something I'm willing to pay for.

296
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:58,704
Speaker 1: No, not really.

297
00:17:58,805 --> 00:18:02,860
Speaker 1: I mean so in some situations it's nice, but it's like I don't need it.

298
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,626
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna make my decision based on it.

299
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:04,847
Speaker 0: Yes.

300
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:12,593
Speaker 0: The only customer service I need is that if there is a service They are legally obligated to provide me like the phone had a flaw replace it.

301
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:14,600
Speaker 0: I can sue them if they won't do that.

302
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,144
Speaker 0: So I had everything I meant Sue about.

303
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,119
Speaker 1: so I got a new checking account online at chase calm.

304
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:30,800
Speaker 1: I didn't have to actually talk to anyone and they sent me the ATM card and I went to the ATM today with it for The first time and I realized they had never told me the pin and I had never been given the option to set a pin.

305
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:32,952
Speaker 0: They usually mail that in a separate envelope.

306
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:34,160
Speaker 1: it was I never got it.

307
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,172
Speaker 0: So are you sure you didn't throw it away as junk mail?

308
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:37,400
Speaker 0: They usually look really shady.

309
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:43,719
Speaker 1: No, cuz the eight the ATM card came in a really shady envelope But in the piece of paper in it didn't have any pin.

310
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,096
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz they always mail the pin separately obviously for a good reason.

311
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:47,679
Speaker 0: Think about it.

312
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,160
Speaker 1: Well, no, cuz it was I had to activate it anyway.

313
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:50,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't.

314
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:52,455
Speaker 0: they're not gonna give you the pin over the phone.

315
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:53,280
Speaker 0: That's not secure either.

316
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,049
Speaker 0: Regardless get a new ATM card.

317
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:57,320
Speaker 1: Let me activate it and they didn't have me set a pin.

318
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,552
Speaker 0: So that that's either you missed a mail or something.

319
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:02,154
Speaker 0: I didn't.

320
00:19:02,254 --> 00:19:03,318
Speaker 1: I didn't miss any males.

321
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:04,140
Speaker 1: I didn't screw anything.

322
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:04,642
Speaker 0: I doubt it.

323
00:19:04,662 --> 00:19:08,380
Speaker 0: cuz every time I get a new debit card, they mail me the card in a separate envelope.

324
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,408
Speaker 1: Envelope.

325
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:10,938
Speaker 1: I checked.

326
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,672
Speaker 1: I don't know they fucked up or something.

327
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:20,349
Speaker 1: I went to The chase like, you know, there are.

328
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,880
Speaker 1: there are bajillion chase branches and they'll have people in them.

329
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,664
Speaker 0: I want a midtown.

330
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:26,860
Speaker 1: I could have gone to any one of them to get to handle this situation.

331
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:36,429
Speaker 1: But it just so happened that you know my co-worker he's got this thing now where he loves going to like the food trucks Right, but not just the regular old street meat.

332
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,240
Speaker 1: He's got to find like the stylish Street, you know.

333
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:50,296
Speaker 1: so there's this Street Suites and he follows it on Twitter and it's basically a bakery in a truck and He's he goes to that like freaking every time he comes to the city and next to the street suites.

334
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:55,420
Speaker 1: today was the schnitzel and Things truck which had a line so long we couldn't wait in it.

335
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:05,659
Speaker 1: But when he attempted to wait in the line I went to the chase like The entire building was chased and I went to the branch in the bottom of that and got the shit taken care of.

336
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:10,679
Speaker 1: It was pretty weird because I went and I sat you know in the back of the bank where you almost never go.

337
00:20:11,523 --> 00:20:14,175
Speaker 0: So did you ask them how you're supposed to get the pin?

338
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,220
Speaker 0: Like did you ask them what happened?

339
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, they said there should have been a pin number in the envelope with it with the card.

340
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,043
Speaker 0: That's weird.

341
00:20:21,063 --> 00:20:25,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, I'm just you know customer service situation.

342
00:20:25,902 --> 00:20:34,894
Speaker 0: So there's that whole situation about the LHC and I do want to talk about this briefly because I think it's really cool and there's an anime called Boca Rado that you could probably watch.

343
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:37,862
Speaker 0: if you wanted to watch anime, that would be Related.

344
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:44,220
Speaker 0: but this crazy crackpot sounding theory came out and it was on slash out about how you're pretty much like.

345
00:20:44,762 --> 00:20:49,240
Speaker 1: This theory is totally real and now Timo the physicist is like, yeah, that's a crack of shit.

346
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:49,641
Speaker 1: Well, no,

347
00:20:49,682 --> 00:21:02,639
Speaker 0: no, no, no, he pointed out that the guy who said it is kind of a crack of shit Because there's the same guy who has all these other crazy similar theories about what if we flip it on and off and on and Off and then we'll find out if God exists.

348
00:21:03,621 --> 00:21:04,383
Speaker 1: How does that work?

349
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:05,927
Speaker 0: I have the paper.

350
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:06,649
Speaker 0: I didn't read it yet.

351
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:19,957
Speaker 0: Okay, but the whole idea and this is what I'm fascinated with because it's an idea that while probably is not true is Because of the way quantum mechanics are more plausible than you'd think.

352
00:21:20,077 --> 00:21:20,800
Speaker 0: but I think it's more.

353
00:21:21,562 --> 00:21:26,760
Speaker 0: I don't think it's necessarily plausible for the LHC because I don't think the LHC has a good chance of destroying the world.

354
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:35,468
Speaker 0: But the theory more is that if we could destroy the world in some quantum way We might as well keep trying because we didn't.

355
00:21:35,849 --> 00:21:39,200
Speaker 0: because if we were able to do it and did it we wouldn't exist already.

356
00:21:39,321 --> 00:21:40,045
Speaker 0: So it wouldn't matter.

357
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:42,920
Speaker 0: the fact that we still exist means we can't destroy the world that way.

358
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:53,234
Speaker 1: it is an interesting concept to think about like, you know, if You were going it's like the you know, the universe usually think of it being destroyed, you know at a moment Like the earth explodes, right?

359
00:21:53,274 --> 00:21:57,513
Speaker 1: So it's like, okay So that means we live like the dinosaurs you live and then you don't live.

360
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,460
Speaker 0: but if it's one of those quantum things, right?

361
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,464
Speaker 0: quantum causality You know buzzword.

362
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:14,369
Speaker 1: whatever the situation where you know, the universe spawns multiple universes like imagine There's a black hole, but the black hole didn't just suck in all energy and all matter But it also sucked in time and it sucked you in.

363
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:17,760
Speaker 1: then not only would you cease to exist at that point?

364
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,932
Speaker 1: But you never would have existed because that time would be getting sucked in and then.

365
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:26,413
Speaker 1: so it's like you wouldn't even exist now If in the future you got sucked in.

366
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:36,480
Speaker 0: his actually was The analogy I used with someone else I was talking to at work who's as I was a PhD in this stuff Mm-hmm, and he said it was a pretty good analogy.

367
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:39,539
Speaker 0: Is that if you destroy the world in that way?

368
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:44,493
Speaker 0: It gets destroyed both directions in time simultaneously forward and backward.

369
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:45,897
Speaker 1: Here's is an interesting thing.

370
00:22:45,937 --> 00:22:46,840
Speaker 1: I was reading up on it.

371
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,144
Speaker 1: So imagine this right?

372
00:22:48,164 --> 00:22:52,440
Speaker 1: So let's say take a laser and you shoot the laser, right and you split it two ways.

373
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:58,317
Speaker 1: Okay, so now I'm on those left split and you're on the right split and we entangle them.

374
00:22:58,357 --> 00:22:59,380
Speaker 1: Whoo, right?

375
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,134
Speaker 1: So then I twiddle my part of the laser and you're a part of the laser twiddles at the exact same time I twiddle.

376
00:23:06,154 --> 00:23:10,860
Speaker 1: so if I twiddle the one Your side turns into one and if I twiddle zero your side twiddles to zero, right?

377
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,654
Speaker 1: So now we can communicate with this entangled laser.

378
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:14,740
Speaker 1: right now.

379
00:23:15,001 --> 00:23:18,277
Speaker 1: This brings up two very interesting things to think about.

380
00:23:18,337 --> 00:23:21,629
Speaker 1: number one Let's pretend we do the same exact thing with the laser.

381
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,040
Speaker 1: only I'm an andromeda and you're on earth.

382
00:23:25,482 --> 00:23:26,707
Speaker 1: I twiddle to zero.

383
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:29,900
Speaker 1: it twiddles to zero by you at the same exact time.

384
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,679
Speaker 1: We are now somehow communicating faster than the speed of light.

385
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,309
Speaker 0: Well, because either causality or locality are broken.

386
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:36,051
Speaker 0: right then right?

387
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:40,394
Speaker 0: Well not broken, but that maybe they never really existed Right, so now here's interesting thought.

388
00:23:40,434 --> 00:23:41,240
Speaker 1: number two, right?

389
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,360
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know, we're assuming now that the laser split is like halfway between us.

390
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,769
Speaker 1: Let's say the laser splitter is right next to you.

391
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,880
Speaker 1: So you're like a foot away from it, but I'm an andromeda.

392
00:23:52,341 --> 00:23:54,287
Speaker 0: Okay, I twiddle my.

393
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:59,240
Speaker 1: you twiddle your bit or I twiddle my bit and I forget which way it goes.

394
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,910
Speaker 1: But basically your bit would twiddle before I twiddled.

395
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:07,665
Speaker 1: so basically I'd be communicating with the past Because they would.

396
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:14,160
Speaker 1: you know the amount of it takes so long to get to the split from me But it only takes you so long much less time to get to the splitting.

397
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,589
Speaker 0: Well, there's also the trouble that while you know, there's the entanglement aside.

398
00:24:17,629 --> 00:24:23,510
Speaker 0: You still can't transfer the in for actual information Really faster than the speed of light.

399
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:25,500
Speaker 0: This was explained to me and I don't really understand it.

400
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:27,480
Speaker 1: I'm starting to understand that part.

401
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:33,455
Speaker 0: I'm well that party was the idea that alright, so you can twiddle bits and they you know in real time in both places change or whatever.

402
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:40,140
Speaker 0: but Despite that you have to impart structure on that information which then takes more time and more to Italy.

403
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's here's the most I've been able to understand about the information part, right?

404
00:24:43,855 --> 00:24:45,059
Speaker 1: So let's pretend you have a box.

405
00:24:45,421 --> 00:24:48,320
Speaker 1: Okay, and the box has one particle in it, right?

406
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:59,380
Speaker 1: And if you know that the particle is in the right half of the box, then you could Partition the box right stick a plunger into the left half.

407
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:01,367
Speaker 1: You know that the half that doesn't have the particle.

408
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:08,799
Speaker 1: then remove the partition and you would get free energy Right just by knowing which half of the box the particle was in.

409
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:24,880
Speaker 1: But if you don't know Right, which half it's in then you're not going to be able to get the free energy because you don't know which side to go on right, so That's sort of like hey if you have information then you can cheat and obviously free energy ain't gonna happen.

410
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,560
Speaker 1: So that means there has to be something inherent in the information that is gonna somehow prevent you from getting the free energy.

411
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,519
Speaker 0: Well, it was like Timo pointed out on the farm information is energy and that's it.

412
00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:36,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, it's like.

413
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,031
Speaker 1: it's like.

414
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:39,100
Speaker 1: well if I do this then I get free energy.

415
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,792
Speaker 1: Well, no you didn't because you spent the energy on the information itself of the knowing.

416
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:55,860
Speaker 0: but this whole LHC bokurato theory It's just really cool because it's so Plausible just in terms of the way we understand this quantum physics and the way the universe actually works that it it makes sense.

417
00:25:56,481 --> 00:26:05,767
Speaker 1: It's just good to know that if somehow we don't know right, but if it is possible to destroy the universe in both directions in time That did not happen.

418
00:26:05,968 --> 00:26:06,913
Speaker 1: Yes will not happen.

419
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:08,100
Speaker 1: That is that is comforting.

420
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:11,780
Speaker 0: So the argument there as I make is that we can only destroy the universe forward.

421
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:15,640
Speaker 0: We must continue to strive to destroy the universe in both directions.

422
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,894
Speaker 0: Then we'll find interesting stuff and we know we're safe.

423
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:21,746
Speaker 1: Yes But the thing is we have to act.

424
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,158
Speaker 1: we have to not accidentally destroy the universe forwards only.

425
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:28,329
Speaker 0: that would be bad Yep, or at least not destroy just the part of the universe.

426
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:29,694
Speaker 0: We're in that's also.

427
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 0: that's probably easy to do.

428
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,225
Speaker 1: That's very easy to do.

429
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:33,673
Speaker 1: In fact, we can already do that.

430
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,040
Speaker 1: It's called the nuclear missile.

431
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,260
Speaker 0: But while you know, the theory is cool and I think pretty solid from a conceptual standpoint.

432
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,253
Speaker 0: But I don't think the LHC has anything.

433
00:26:45,393 --> 00:26:47,000
Speaker 0: I don't think the LHC is causing that.

434
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,840
Speaker 0: I don't think this is the magnets failing and everything has anything to do with this theory.

435
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:54,710
Speaker 0: No And the quote from Teemo in the forum says it best.

436
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:57,959
Speaker 0: I could take it seriously if I hadn't personally met Holger Beck.

437
00:26:57,999 --> 00:27:07,086
Speaker 1: Nielsen Is but I can imagine that this I've met Teemo so I know that he is a good judge of the This kind of person.

438
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:08,814
Speaker 1: I will trust his.

439
00:27:09,115 --> 00:27:10,280
Speaker 1: you know that that's a crazy dude.

440
00:27:17,171 --> 00:27:18,457
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

441
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:22,790
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell this is an ad for the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

442
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:27,774
Speaker 1: Yes, Karlsruhe from 13 Texas.

443
00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:28,276
Speaker 0: Yes.

444
00:27:28,657 --> 00:27:29,019
Speaker 1: It's a jury.

445
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:29,963
Speaker 1: It's a city in Germany.

446
00:27:30,003 --> 00:27:30,846
Speaker 1: Is that our state?

447
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:31,368
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

448
00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:34,499
Speaker 0: Yes yeah, so anyway, this is an ad for that.

449
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:40,426
Speaker 0: and they go around Germany asking people to pronounce Karlsruhe and Maha who shats?

450
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,139
Speaker 0: The Maha who shats Institute of Technology?

451
00:27:44,842 --> 00:27:47,070
Speaker 0: by and large German people can't say the word, Massachusetts.

452
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,343
Speaker 1: Well, I can't say Karlsruhe German people.

453
00:27:49,383 --> 00:27:55,497
Speaker 1: Tell me how to say it properly My Karlsruhe just like I'm laughing at their message.

454
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:55,718
Speaker 1: who was?

455
00:27:55,858 --> 00:28:02,853
Speaker 1: I love nothing more than hearing people in foreign languages pronounce words in my Language, I also like hearing people like, you know, it's like if you you know You always do that.

456
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:07,549
Speaker 1: Like if you don't know Chinese or something, you can always be like, you know The French.

457
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,471
Speaker 1: Right, you can always you know do that right but it's great, you know It's like.

458
00:28:13,752 --> 00:28:17,244
Speaker 1: I don't feel bad being racist or stereotypical doing that because I love it.

459
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:19,130
Speaker 1: when other people do that to you know English.

460
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:21,097
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure that they love it.

461
00:28:21,137 --> 00:28:22,422
Speaker 1: when I do it to their language.

462
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:29,568
Speaker 0: that Australian dude at Otacon was it was Doing what Americans do and he's like ah Welcome to America.

463
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,556
Speaker 0: Ah He's like you guys just really say your.

464
00:28:33,777 --> 00:28:36,327
Speaker 1: obviously he's never been to Boston or New York.

465
00:28:38,892 --> 00:28:43,861
Speaker 1: What do you got for me, oh so basically I Saw a link on the Internet's.

466
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:44,649
Speaker 1: that was like dude.

467
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,865
Speaker 1: So I was like drunk dude going to get more beer and I was like, alright, let me see.

468
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:52,017
Speaker 1: I Seen drunk dudes on the Internet.

469
00:28:52,037 --> 00:28:53,422
Speaker 1: What's that famous guy from FARC?

470
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:55,390
Speaker 0: Oh, I forget his name.

471
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:56,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy who's?

472
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:57,865
Speaker 1: there's a. there's a Firefox extension.

473
00:28:57,885 --> 00:29:01,496
Speaker 0: Henry Earl See what he's up to.

474
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:02,058
Speaker 0: you keep talking.

475
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:03,243
Speaker 0: I'll see if he's been arrested again.

476
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:06,313
Speaker 1: this dude in this video Is that it's like.

477
00:29:06,353 --> 00:29:07,276
Speaker 1: he's not so drunk.

478
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:12,750
Speaker 1: He's vomiting or as alcohol poisoning in the hospital, but that's the next step, right?

479
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:18,746
Speaker 1: He is like basically like at the maximum of the stumbling aspect of drunkenness.

480
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,310
Speaker 1: He is so stumble rific.

481
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:30,630
Speaker 1: It's like you can't even buy more beer and I think that's actually that's probably a good evolutionary Defense against drunkenness is that you know you get drunk?

482
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:36,770
Speaker 1: I think your body might be intentionally making you stumble about just so that you can't possibly get more drunk.

483
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:46,945
Speaker 1: It's like your body's defending itself from alcohol poisoning by making you so uncoordinated that you can't get more alcohol in your mouth Because this guy can't even walk through the convenience store.

484
00:29:46,965 --> 00:29:52,790
Speaker 0: that has been the argument I've always used for why you put drinks in those upright glasses, you know, the fancy martini glass the triangle.

485
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:59,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, because if you're drunk limiting glass it sure is Alright Henry Earl.

486
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,143
Speaker 1: Hey, why do they have like?

487
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:03,030
Speaker 1: don't they drink like sake out of a bowl?

488
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:03,712
Speaker 1: Isn't that sort of?

489
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:08,469
Speaker 1: uh, you know sometimes at least that's like but the you see the businessman.

490
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:09,689
Speaker 0: eventually They just grab the bottle.

491
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:27,804
Speaker 0: So Henry Earl as of October 6th 2009 he has been arrested five times in 2009. he has spent 276 days of this year in jail for alcohol.

492
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:29,330
Speaker 1: only for alcohol.

493
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:30,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the only thing.

494
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,603
Speaker 0: he's ever been arrested only nine times this year man.

495
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:35,649
Speaker 1: I've spent pretty much the whole day in year.

496
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:44,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sucks for four thousand four hundred and forty seven days in jail since 1992.

497
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:48,069
Speaker 0: Henry Earl, I salute you downtown James Brown.

498
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:51,195
Speaker 0: That's what he calls himself.

499
00:30:51,496 --> 00:31:02,330
Speaker 1: really yeah, I guess that's the sort of kind of thing a drunk dude says, you know that All right, so the Amtrak story, you know, it's very sad.

500
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,270
Speaker 0: This elderly gentleman was hit by an Amtrak train and my commute and everyone was delayed for a long time.

501
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:14,150
Speaker 0: There are all these troubles and as far as I can tell Every police officer in the tri-county area arrived to deal with the situation.

502
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:28,400
Speaker 0: There were like a hundred police cars blocking like the entire train station at peak skill But what amazed me was that on the train, you know on my train the first train that was stopped by it No one would say what was happening.

503
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:28,581
Speaker 0: Like.

504
00:31:28,641 --> 00:31:30,350
Speaker 0: I even asked the conductor like hey, what's going on?

505
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,877
Speaker 0: He's like can't tell you like.

506
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,490
Speaker 1: no our conductor was just like yeah cargo hit by trade.

507
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:37,300
Speaker 0: No one would tell us what happened at any capacity at all.

508
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:39,850
Speaker 0: They just said there's a delay at peak skill.

509
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,250
Speaker 0: We will be sitting here for an indeterminate amount of time.

510
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,323
Speaker 0: They opened the doors on the train and let us get out at Cortland.

511
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,590
Speaker 0: and you know, they didn't know what was going on.

512
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:49,341
Speaker 0: I almost got off the train cuz there's an Indian restaurant.

513
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:51,730
Speaker 0: I found on Google Maps like an hour away an hour.

514
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,556
Speaker 1: You're gonna walk it out.

515
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,885
Speaker 0: Sorry, I'll buy a mile away.

516
00:31:54,207 --> 00:31:58,101
Speaker 0: Oh I'm real tired because I'm working the night shift this week.

517
00:31:58,121 --> 00:31:59,908
Speaker 0: I'm going straight from this to work.

518
00:32:00,992 --> 00:32:01,719
Speaker 1: Geek morning, sir.

519
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:01,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:08,510
Speaker 0: Oh my god Plus my throat's kind of scratchy from yelling and talking at the party all night at the wedding over the weekend.

521
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:12,450
Speaker 0: But anyway, so, you know, I'm on this train and no one knows what's going on.

522
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,949
Speaker 0: So I pull out the smartphone and I find out what's going on.

523
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:22,191
Speaker 0: I found out exactly what's going on and it took me like five minutes of Twitter and SMS to find out exactly what was going On.

524
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:26,170
Speaker 0: Yep, so I kind of say out loud cuz you know, it's a there's a weird situation going on.

525
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,501
Speaker 0: Everyone's kind of friendly on the train and talking to each other about.

526
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,390
Speaker 0: you know, like man what's going on?

527
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,314
Speaker 0: I don't know man.

528
00:32:31,415 --> 00:32:32,882
Speaker 0: Maybe we should just skip and go to a bar.

529
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:34,530
Speaker 0: Are there even bars around here?

530
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:35,540
Speaker 0: Are there restaurants?

531
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,261
Speaker 0: I don't know and I just too bad.

532
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,270
Speaker 1: You couldn't be in Cold Spring.

533
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,464
Speaker 1: There's like that our peak skills like a bar right next to the train set up.

534
00:32:42,845 --> 00:32:45,535
Speaker 0: So I just say out loud Do get it by Amtrak.

535
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,983
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and everyone on the train gets silent.

536
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:48,946
Speaker 0: They're like, really?

537
00:32:49,227 --> 00:32:50,110
Speaker 0: How'd you figure that out?

538
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:51,729
Speaker 0: Oh my god, like how do you know?

539
00:32:53,492 --> 00:32:55,958
Speaker 0: And I held up my phone and I was like I have the internet.

540
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a smartphone.

541
00:32:58,966 --> 00:33:07,070
Speaker 0: and then I realized that almost every other person in that car Also had a smartphone but they they did not have a smart user.

542
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:15,457
Speaker 0: Not only that most of them were using their smartphones at that moment and none of them could figure out How I had found this information.

543
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:16,783
Speaker 0: and I was like smartphone.

544
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,570
Speaker 0: and they're like, you know, I held it up.

545
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,282
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, I just looked and found out and they're like, how'd you find out Google?

546
00:33:22,523 --> 00:33:29,361
Speaker 0: I'm like Google News Twitter SMSing the people in other trains on the train line Mm-hmm.

547
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:33,849
Speaker 0: It did not cross any of their minds to do this and then I realized step back a little bit.

548
00:33:34,552 --> 00:33:35,777
Speaker 0: All those guys are like man.

549
00:33:35,878 --> 00:33:37,323
Speaker 0: Are there any restaurants around here?

550
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:38,890
Speaker 0: Is it worth it to get off the train?

551
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,357
Speaker 0: Is there anywhere we could even go?

552
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:41,783
Speaker 1: you already use Google Maps?

553
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:42,466
Speaker 0: I already knew.

554
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:43,290
Speaker 0: I already looked up.

555
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,481
Speaker 0: There was a couple in the restaurant like a mile away.

556
00:33:45,602 --> 00:33:47,170
Speaker 0: There was like a bar a half mile away.

557
00:33:47,471 --> 00:33:48,396
Speaker 0: There were plenty of places.

558
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:51,430
Speaker 1: It's not just mobile things either, you know, how many times you know?

559
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,497
Speaker 1: There's a reason that there's that.

560
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:54,430
Speaker 1: let me google that for you website.

561
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,738
Speaker 1: It's because someone will go on like a disguise.

562
00:33:56,999 --> 00:33:57,441
Speaker 1: isn't that weird?

563
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:59,729
Speaker 1: like someone let's say someone's in like, I don't know.

564
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:00,593
Speaker 1: They're.

565
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,590
Speaker 1: they're a big fan of a football team, right?

566
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:08,590
Speaker 1: So they hang out on some communal PHP BB forum for their particular football team.

567
00:34:08,911 --> 00:34:18,422
Speaker 1: they talk to all these other football fans and maybe they'll have a problem with their home theater or Their computer or their car, right?

568
00:34:18,743 --> 00:34:20,610
Speaker 1: And that's the only internet community that they're in.

569
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,429
Speaker 1: So what they'll do is they'll post like some off-topic thread like hey, what should I do about my car?

570
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,741
Speaker 1: It's like it's a football forum.

571
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,009
Speaker 1: What the fuck is wrong with you?

572
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:36,476
Speaker 1: You know, it's because they don't you know, it's it's that old situation of when you have a have a hammer Everything looks like nails, you know.

573
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:40,570
Speaker 1: people don't you know, they use what they got, you know, and they don't branch out.

574
00:34:40,992 --> 00:34:41,715
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many.

575
00:34:41,735 --> 00:34:46,677
Speaker 1: like tech help questions I see and like comic book forums It's like what is wrong with you?

576
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,424
Speaker 1: people here are comic book people.

577
00:34:48,444 --> 00:34:49,710
Speaker 1: They don't know shit about computers.

578
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:54,330
Speaker 1: Go ask your question on super user stack overflow or something, but they don't even know those places exist.

579
00:34:54,431 --> 00:35:02,928
Speaker 0: and this now I realized on the train and we were gonna do a show on this if we hadn't been distracted by unrelated issues for the whole last week and a half and change.

580
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:07,319
Speaker 0: but People have these crazy technology tool.

581
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,346
Speaker 0: It's not just like the internet like this is going beyond.

582
00:35:09,366 --> 00:35:10,670
Speaker 0: just people don't know how to use the internet.

583
00:35:10,896 --> 00:35:11,652
Speaker 0: No, yeah Like.

584
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:12,898
Speaker 1: I think it's just like people.

585
00:35:12,918 --> 00:35:19,030
Speaker 1: it's like driving a car don't know how to use the cruise control Got a VCR didn't know that you could program it to do certain things.

586
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,254
Speaker 0: You you think Scott's joking?

587
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:24,663
Speaker 0: I've met people who don't know what cruise control does.

588
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, like seriously like.

589
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:27,470
Speaker 0: they're like.

590
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,835
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, yeah I never use the management Superman How to get it to work.

591
00:35:31,975 --> 00:35:35,826
Speaker 1: Imagine if Superman didn't know he had like the freeze breath, which he has.

592
00:35:36,227 --> 00:35:37,932
Speaker 1: that's what's going on here Right.

593
00:35:37,992 --> 00:35:40,040
Speaker 1: It's like people have all these things.

594
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,450
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, and they have all these abilities.

595
00:35:42,671 --> 00:35:47,290
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that I could set my air conditioner to turn on like eight hours after I leave the house.

596
00:35:47,892 --> 00:35:54,030
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that I could you know set my crock-pot to turn on, you know, four hours or something something.

597
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:58,970
Speaker 0: But it's starting to be a not really a problem for me because it makes me a wizard in the real world.

598
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:00,930
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's great because I have a smartphone.

599
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:10,361
Speaker 0: It used to be you know when when if one person in a group of geeks had a smartphone they were the wizard because you'd all be arguing like Man, what are the word barbecue come from?

600
00:36:10,723 --> 00:36:11,285
Speaker 0: I think it's this.

601
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:14,877
Speaker 0: I think it's that and then Wizard goes smartphone Wikipedia.

602
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:15,680
Speaker 0: Here's the answer.

603
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,726
Speaker 0: I did that on the way to the wedding.

604
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:19,130
Speaker 0: We looked up the etymology of barbecue.

605
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:19,818
Speaker 1: Oh, what was it?

606
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:20,607
Speaker 0: It's really cool.

607
00:36:23,751 --> 00:36:29,246
Speaker 0: Anyway, I also learned about thug and buccaneer comes from the same kind of root as barbecue real.

608
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:38,795
Speaker 0: Yeah Get some ribs All right, but I thought all right once everyone has smartphones No one can be wizards anymore.

609
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:41,848
Speaker 0: and in geek communities among smart people.

610
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:42,390
Speaker 0: That was true.

611
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:43,376
Speaker 1: That's absolutely true.

612
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:44,906
Speaker 1: You'll say everyone will go to the Wikipedia.

613
00:36:44,927 --> 00:36:45,410
Speaker 1: It'll be a race.

614
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,856
Speaker 0: Yes, we have the separate thing.

615
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:49,628
Speaker 0: We race to see who is the fastest wizard.

616
00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:54,021
Speaker 1: Yeah It's it's a Harry Potter wizard battles.

617
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:55,527
Speaker 1: I never even read that much Harry Potter.

618
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,450
Speaker 1: They even have wizard battles.

619
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:58,138
Speaker 1: They must have wizard bezel.

620
00:36:58,158 --> 00:36:59,062
Speaker 0: They have to try wizard.

621
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:03,214
Speaker 0: Well anyway, yeah, so Among normal people.

622
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:04,178
Speaker 0: I'm still a wizard.

623
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:07,430
Speaker 0: cuz no one in any way that everyone has a smartphone.

624
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:10,590
Speaker 0: No one even realizes they can look stuff up on the internet.

625
00:37:11,612 --> 00:37:13,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know, I think what it is.

626
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:19,110
Speaker 1: it's like People only you know, like they only know how to use what they got.

627
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:24,619
Speaker 1: It's the same situation where you know, I people like putting a database in excels because they got excel They know how to use it.

628
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,470
Speaker 0: I think it's beyond that.

629
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:34,125
Speaker 0: I think it's a cultural almost zebra storyteller situation to where They think they have a problem like I need to know X and they may know a solution.

630
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,910
Speaker 0: like I could look it up online.

631
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:38,863
Speaker 0: But they don't at any point connect.

632
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:47,310
Speaker 0: I can look it up online On my phone like they don't even think of their phone as the tool to solve that problem because they the first thought they have.

633
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,330
Speaker 1: People don't even know to look it up online.

634
00:37:49,572 --> 00:37:51,463
Speaker 1: Normally, I have to be like google.

635
00:37:51,483 --> 00:37:52,550
Speaker 1: it buy it online.

636
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:56,387
Speaker 1: How many times do I tell people that like just google it just buy it on Amazon?

637
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,093
Speaker 1: people come to me Where should I buy this?

638
00:37:58,535 --> 00:38:03,110
Speaker 1: amazon.com where you could buy absolutely anything that exists in the entire universe, you know.

639
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,825
Speaker 1: That's why it's a to z.

640
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,689
Speaker 0: Look stuff up on cars and houses.

641
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:10,362
Speaker 0: They don't think like it's like their brain has a checklist of.

642
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:14,000
Speaker 0: it goes through the list of I need to know X. How do I achieve this?

643
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:14,950
Speaker 0: it goes like down the list?

644
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,235
Speaker 0: Like if this maybe I'll do this.

645
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:17,178
Speaker 0: try this try this try.

646
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:20,190
Speaker 0: this phone is not anywhere on that list.

647
00:38:20,391 --> 00:38:21,195
Speaker 0: It just isn't there.

648
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:24,390
Speaker 0: They just they never even conceive of using the phone to solve the problem.

649
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:38,636
Speaker 0: And the weird thing is I see them using the phones but like on the train I've lately whenever I walk on the train I walk all I get on the train at the first car and I walk all the way down and I look at what everyone Is doing with their technology?

650
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:40,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm starting to do this.

651
00:38:40,162 --> 00:38:41,950
Speaker 1: laptops usually watching DVDs.

652
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:45,320
Speaker 1: People some people, you know playing some video games.

653
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,350
Speaker 1: a lot of people with blackberries playing brick breaker check an email.

654
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:49,574
Speaker 0: Here's what bothers me.

655
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:54,090
Speaker 0: I would say the majority of people I see with technology are playing solitaire.

656
00:38:54,451 --> 00:39:02,426
Speaker 0: Yes, a lot of people playing solid see people with gigantic laptops like a super powerful laptop And they open it up and they're playing solitaire on the laptop.

657
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:05,656
Speaker 0: like really Honestly, that's what you're doing.

658
00:39:05,917 --> 00:39:06,519
Speaker 0: You have all this.

659
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,783
Speaker 0: you have technology.

660
00:39:07,783 --> 00:39:14,770
Speaker 0: 90 minutes on a train Technology to never be bored ever in your life anywhere again forever.

661
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,452
Speaker 0: But I was a kid.

662
00:39:15,693 --> 00:39:22,777
Speaker 1: I've thing is I've never seen anyone with with a evdu card, you know or some internet connectivity Playing solitaire.

663
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:24,446
Speaker 1: They're usually out looking and such.

664
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:27,921
Speaker 0: Yes Well, that's because it's mostly business people whose companies pay for them.

665
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:30,270
Speaker 0: or exactly they're surfing the internet doing nothing.

666
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:35,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't see that many evdu cards to be honest on the train and a handful kind of suck.

667
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,115
Speaker 0: I like one per car.

668
00:39:37,135 --> 00:39:38,701
Speaker 0: They stop working a croton harm.

669
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:39,624
Speaker 1: They do it sucks.

670
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:43,950
Speaker 0: I Don't get like any service a croton Harmon who the hell lives there?

671
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,670
Speaker 1: Well, there's that big cell tower that they put up right next to it.

672
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,215
Speaker 1: But it's like because you're under the tower It doesn't help you.

673
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:51,869
Speaker 1: you need to be a little bit far away from it in order for it.

674
00:39:51,990 --> 00:40:03,488
Speaker 1: You know because it aims, you know line of sight ish So if you're directly under it, it's like well, it's not aiming straight at the ground You know, that would be sort of a waste of the energy Because most of you get service, I guess if you're a mole man, it's it's.

675
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:05,479
Speaker 1: yeah They don't want the mole men to get service.

676
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,289
Speaker 1: They don't aim it at the ground right under it.

677
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:11,050
Speaker 0: But I just it amazes me and I don't know what to do.

678
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:14,846
Speaker 0: I don't have any idea for this show beyond pointing out that people are stupid.

679
00:40:14,866 --> 00:40:15,850
Speaker 0: They don't use the technology.

680
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, what it is.

681
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:41,881
Speaker 1: I think just you know, if you ever have any problem whatsoever Right, you need to really put in a strong effort You know to think the technology solves all problems like not all problems But like 99% of problems every day mundane issues that people have can be solved with the existing Technology Google that can do 75% of it.

682
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:44,610
Speaker 1: Amazon can do like another five to ten percent, right?

683
00:40:45,173 --> 00:41:02,742
Speaker 1: and you just have to get in the habit of Always just look for a technological solution always don't like and you know Don't like fall onto things, you know, just you know, go and maximize find and you know, they you know There's an app for that, you know, there's a website for that.

684
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:04,410
Speaker 1: go out and find it.

685
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,654
Speaker 1: Don't just go to the website.

686
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:08,503
Speaker 1: You already know, you know, don't just keep doing things.

687
00:41:08,523 --> 00:41:10,790
Speaker 0: You know, what if you already know Google?

688
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:12,637
Speaker 1: Then you're all set.

689
00:41:12,878 --> 00:41:14,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's a more fundamental thing.

690
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:21,070
Speaker 1: The thing is even people who do know Google have really shitty Google skills, like they can't find shit on Google.

691
00:41:21,432 --> 00:41:22,740
Speaker 1: I find it with like one query.

692
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,510
Speaker 1: In fact rim really sucks at Google.

693
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:28,383
Speaker 1: How so you always take like a whole bunch of searches to find something.

694
00:41:28,423 --> 00:41:30,310
Speaker 1: I find it like two seconds mean example.

695
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:31,697
Speaker 1: I'm an example.

696
00:41:31,717 --> 00:41:34,090
Speaker 1: It's mostly I think what it is that I'll be like rim.

697
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:36,761
Speaker 1: Just look this up and you're like god takes so long.

698
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:39,487
Speaker 1: It's so much effort and I'm like boom two seconds I find it.

699
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:44,813
Speaker 0: Oh, that's just because I'm a jerk and I'm annoyed at the fact that you rather than giving me a link you tell me to Google it.

700
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:47,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz googling it should take two seconds.

701
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,425
Speaker 1: Googling is easier than finding a link, but you're the one.

702
00:41:50,445 --> 00:41:54,333
Speaker 1: you have Google skills You wouldn't you know, it's it's like up there it is But it's something.

703
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:56,984
Speaker 0: if you go to someone you're like, hey check out this video.

704
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:58,370
Speaker 0: I saw Google for it.

705
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:58,651
Speaker 0: It's like.

706
00:41:58,872 --> 00:42:00,982
Speaker 0: well, you won't even put forward the effort to give me a link.

707
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:02,308
Speaker 0: I don't care about what you're trying to show me.

708
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:02,469
Speaker 0: now.

709
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:07,029
Speaker 1: The thing is giving you a link is a lot more effort than googling.

710
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:10,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, are you that shitty at googling that you can't just boom get it on the first query?

711
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,420
Speaker 0: No, it's more than if you aren't willing to put for it.

712
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,950
Speaker 0: It's like a barrier to entry to get my attention.

713
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:18,283
Speaker 0: That's the way I look at it.

714
00:42:18,626 --> 00:42:25,553
Speaker 1: I just You suck at googling and it's so much, you know, it shouldn't be that much work for you to just get it Boom done.

715
00:42:25,573 --> 00:42:26,177
Speaker 0: I don't even do it.

716
00:42:26,197 --> 00:42:26,781
Speaker 0: I mean bother.

717
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know It's cuz you suck.

718
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:34,322
Speaker 0: But the I think it's a more fundamental problem even beyond technology.

719
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:36,530
Speaker 0: I think people just don't have basic troubleshooting skills.

720
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:39,646
Speaker 1: Well troubleshooting skills is a separate problem entirely.

721
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:48,838
Speaker 0: when I say troubleshooting I mean life like problem solving like I have four matches and a duck and a boat and I have to solve this problem.

722
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,184
Speaker 0: and it's like people don't even like.

723
00:42:50,525 --> 00:42:54,028
Speaker 0: and the problem is like Get across the river and like they won't think to use the boat.

724
00:42:54,773 --> 00:43:00,902
Speaker 0: They're like try to make a raft out of the matchsticks and drown Like that is what's happening and I don't know what to do.

725
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:02,688
Speaker 1: I think see I don't even think it's.

726
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,499
Speaker 1: yeah I think it's actually two sort of separate problems.

727
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:07,302
Speaker 1: you put them together.

728
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:14,300
Speaker 1: is troubleshooting skills is like, you know It's like there's a you don't even try to solve.

729
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,370
Speaker 1: the problem is is what we're talking about here, right?

730
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,674
Speaker 1: It's like thing doesn't work.

731
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:23,530
Speaker 1: Don't even try, you know, they don't even consider that solving the problem is an option.

732
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:24,989
Speaker 1: That is the problem.

733
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,679
Speaker 1: troubleshooting skills is okay.

734
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:33,324
Speaker 1: now you're forced to try to solve the problem and They don't know to use the process of elimination.

735
00:43:33,364 --> 00:43:34,790
Speaker 1: that's a lack of troubleshooting skills.

736
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:38,790
Speaker 1: We have to get to the troubleshooting part first.

737
00:43:39,151 --> 00:43:46,671
Speaker 1: They don't even try to solve the problem to begin with, you know, they don't even activate their shitty troubleshooting mechanism There's.

738
00:43:46,691 --> 00:43:52,590
Speaker 1: so they don't even know they have the troubleshooting mechanism to begin with just like Superman doesn't know he has freeze breath.

739
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:56,821
Speaker 0: So, how do we foster this in people?

740
00:43:56,861 --> 00:43:58,508
Speaker 0: how do we teach people to solve problems?

741
00:43:58,528 --> 00:44:00,255
Speaker 0: It's not that hard It's like let's see.

742
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:01,180
Speaker 0: I want a sandwich.

743
00:44:01,923 --> 00:44:03,350
Speaker 0: Do I go get a sandwich or not?

744
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,990
Speaker 0: How do you get someone to that level of realizing they can go get a sandwich?

745
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:13,170
Speaker 1: I actually think that if you look at something like the you know scribble knots, which is not a good game, right?

746
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:27,530
Speaker 1: But actually it has a very good model for teaching people this sort of thing, which is you know Give someone a problem to solve right then However, they solved it take away the tool and then force them to do it again and force them to do it again.

747
00:44:28,511 --> 00:45:01,950
Speaker 1: And if people solve problems even the same problem over and over again with different tools Instead of you know people tend to learn like tools and they don't learn too many tools because they don't like learning or they Don't feel like they like learning at least I don't know or they're adverse to learning things even if for whatever reason They will try to do as much as possible as they can with the few tools that they are very comfortable with and very learned With and I think forcing people to just learn more tools even just have cursory level knowledge of a wider variety of tools.

748
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:16,847
Speaker 1: Eventually you reach some sort of point where you actually choose tools when you have a problem to solve rather than just Picking up the tool that you already know immediately and then stretching it as far as you can possibly stretch it, you know We should apply this education.

749
00:45:16,908 --> 00:45:27,109
Speaker 1: though How much people try to do with Excel Excel should really really only be used if you have numbers and you need graphs and charts or accounting or something like that.

750
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:29,059
Speaker 1: Otherwise No Excel.

751
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:36,345
Speaker 0: No, I Just said they don't even get to the point of using the tools So they don't even realize they have a problem or they don't realize the problem is solved.

752
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:41,367
Speaker 1: a lot of people just you know They don't even realize they have problems and if they do they don't even try to solve them.

753
00:45:41,428 --> 00:45:41,809
Speaker 1: They just go.

754
00:45:42,472 --> 00:45:42,793
Speaker 1: They just.

755
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:46,810
Speaker 1: it's just something they'll always complain about, you know, it's like doesn't it suck, you know?

756
00:45:47,052 --> 00:45:50,824
Speaker 0: I just think of that Gervais comedy on Thought.

757
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:57,495
Speaker 1: yeah, right It's like people just have these things and they just sort of take it as a complaint with life like oh man It doesn't it suck?

758
00:45:57,515 --> 00:45:58,099
Speaker 1: how you know?

759
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,850
Speaker 1: VCRs are so hard to program.

760
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:04,090
Speaker 1: They always go 12 and you know, just like everyone would be like, yeah, doesn't that suck?

761
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:04,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

762
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,047
Speaker 1: you can program the VCR.

763
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:08,434
Speaker 1: damn it You can do it.

764
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:10,825
Speaker 1: or it's like oh man, doesn't it suck?

765
00:46:10,845 --> 00:46:11,890
Speaker 1: how you can't do this?

766
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:13,118
Speaker 1: It's like yes you can.

767
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:14,929
Speaker 1: you didn't even think about trying to fix it.

768
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:21,333
Speaker 0: Option is to not bother trying to help our fellow man in this situation and just be Wizards.

769
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:26,226
Speaker 0: the thing is it doesn't it doesn't Train and these people are all like I need food blah blah blah.

770
00:46:26,246 --> 00:46:30,162
Speaker 0: and I was like There's a restaurant here and there's a restaurant here and there's restaurant here.

771
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:32,550
Speaker 0: and they had no idea how I got this magic information.

772
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:41,470
Speaker 0: It was kind of a powerful cool feeling to be a wizard to be able to just Lord this over people like that to be Like look I have power that you will never achieve.

773
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:46,186
Speaker 0: Look at my technology that you also have in your pocket, but you don't know to use.

774
00:46:46,206 --> 00:46:47,210
Speaker 1: I know right?

775
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,654
Speaker 1: It's like and we're so worried.

776
00:46:48,674 --> 00:46:53,530
Speaker 1: This is why I think it's sort of silly to sort of regulate things in a in a commercial way.

777
00:46:53,570 --> 00:47:02,816
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, oh we can't let anyone have you know CD burners because then they'll all pirate music or whatever It's like people aren't smart enough to do.

778
00:47:02,836 --> 00:47:04,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, why aren't?

779
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:07,750
Speaker 1: why isn't everyone in the world downloading music from the Pirate Bay?

780
00:47:08,332 --> 00:47:13,430
Speaker 1: It's not because people don't want free music or they have some moral qualms so they're worried about the law.

781
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,109
Speaker 1: It's cuz they're too dumb.

782
00:47:15,985 --> 00:47:19,038
Speaker 1: You know Why is everyone buying games on the virtual console?

783
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:23,612
Speaker 1: because they are too dumb to even know that an emulator is something that could possibly Exist.

784
00:47:23,773 --> 00:47:25,380
Speaker 0: we own a lot of virtual console games.

785
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:28,654
Speaker 1: I know but I'm just saying right It's it's cuz.

786
00:47:28,675 --> 00:47:38,397
Speaker 1: people just they you know, I mean, I'm surprised It's so many people have like those deep the DSR for cards, you know that amazes me Yeah, but yeah.

787
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:39,422
Speaker 0: All right.

788
00:47:39,462 --> 00:47:40,767
Speaker 0: I think we're done cuz I gotta go to work.

789
00:47:40,888 --> 00:47:46,150
Speaker 1: Yeah Think about any time you have a complaint or anything is making you unhappy.

790
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:49,370
Speaker 1: Look for a technology that will solve it.

791
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,724
Speaker 1: It's probably a technology you don't already know and it's probably worth it to learn.

792
00:47:53,885 --> 00:47:57,397
Speaker 1: and Google is your friend Don't if you ask me anything?

793
