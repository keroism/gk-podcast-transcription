1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,892
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday November 24th 2015.

2
00:00:12,892 --> 00:00:15,600
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,819
Speaker 1: Matchmaking in video games not in other places.

4
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:22,758
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:27,700
Speaker 1: So dangerous things have been happening.

6
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:31,640
Speaker 0: Dangerous as I've said a couple times and the most dangerous.

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:49,520
Speaker 1: I joined that GMR the giant multiplayer robot long-form game of Civ 5 and then basically I first formed another one of those games For all of us, so it's like our crew like eight FRC people playing Civ 5 And I play Civ 5 a lot when I travel which against the AI like it's not the same as against humans.

8
00:00:50,243 --> 00:00:57,579
Speaker 1: But also most of our friends have not played Civ 5 a lot Recently or have never played with all the expansions that made the game good.

9
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:04,869
Speaker 1: So the problem is as a result all of us Started playing Civ 5 single-player a little bit to like.

10
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:07,979
Speaker 1: remember how to play so we don't fuck up in the game.

11
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,640
Speaker 1: It's like I'll play a bunch of turns.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,800
Speaker 0: Yeah I can play like ten turns of a single-player game over and over and over again and get really good at those first ten turns.

13
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,205
Speaker 0: And I only played like what.

14
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:23,850
Speaker 0: six turns so far seven not too many turns so far in the other game exactly But like every it's weird playing against humans like.

15
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:30,956
Speaker 1: I care a lot more about how well it goes down Like I really like if Scott gets to a hut before me fuck that I got like.

16
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:31,317
Speaker 1: I can't lie.

17
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,106
Speaker 0: I've got a lot of huts.

18
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:34,394
Speaker 1: I only got two.

19
00:01:34,414 --> 00:01:35,360
Speaker 0: computer doesn't fuck me.

20
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,483
Speaker 0: I'm about to get one more hut.

21
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,988
Speaker 1: watch out though that computers get well.

22
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:41,299
Speaker 1: like I said AI gets bonuses, but AI is stupid mm-hmm.

23
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:49,230
Speaker 1: the danger is Multiple times in the last few weeks, and I'm sure I'm not the only one this happened to I thought well It's ten o'clock.

24
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,019
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go to bed soon.

25
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:54,244
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna start a game of sieve and play like the first 20 turns And then I'll quit.

26
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:57,540
Speaker 0: you mean the first 20,000 turns you mean well I won.

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,080
Speaker 0: It's turn 200 cliche of one more turn is because of civilization.

28
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:04,406
Speaker 0: That's the game.

29
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,656
Speaker 0: there wasn't some other game with the one more turn.

30
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:07,560
Speaker 0: it was civilization.

31
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,586
Speaker 0: That's the one I think.

32
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:10,054
Speaker 1: what got me those the last?

33
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:13,047
Speaker 1: so two nights ago I'm literally just like but but but.

34
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,400
Speaker 1: and then I said to myself out loud all right just one more turn.

35
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,230
Speaker 1: And then I realized what I was saying, and I just quit the game without saving.

36
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:20,234
Speaker 0: that's immediately.

37
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:21,820
Speaker 1: I was like quit no more.

38
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,349
Speaker 0: That's right good move.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,213
Speaker 1: the problem is if I runs on my laptop So it's actually it's nice iPad here.

40
00:02:28,474 --> 00:02:31,086
Speaker 1: what I might do is I can bring.

41
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:37,124
Speaker 1: the thing is unless other people also take their turns quicker I could take the laptop to work and if my turn comes up I could just play the one.

42
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:46,189
Speaker 0: all I want is for me to take a turn when I wake up in the morning with some Orangey and some breakfast a little bagel, and I want when I get home from work Or it's before I go to bed one more turn.

43
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:50,836
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all I'm asking because that would be you know it's nice No convenient little time you know.

44
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:53,568
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna try to take my turn right after the show.

45
00:02:53,588 --> 00:02:54,813
Speaker 1: I'm not taking it while you're watching.

46
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,837
Speaker 0: cuz why not?

47
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,687
Speaker 0: yeah Really gonna learn that much in turn five six seven I'd rather you.

48
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:08,520
Speaker 1: if you want to find out what's going on my business You've either got a somehow convinced me to give you open borders or like risk sending a missionary into my biz.

49
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:10,097
Speaker 0: Why don't we make an embassy?

50
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:10,157
Speaker 0: uh?

51
00:03:11,341 --> 00:03:19,150
Speaker 1: If I meet you I will maybe grant you an embassy from mutual nominal fee mutual embassy Mutual embassy you know.

52
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:31,350
Speaker 1: it's interesting because against the AI's There's all these things of that affect your relationship based on mechanics in the game, but against a human it's just humans humaning.

53
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:37,797
Speaker 1: so Like me spreading my religion to you is not going to make you look favorably upon me.

54
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,633
Speaker 1: nope I'm not gonna go for religion.

55
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,986
Speaker 0: I think though so Religions got too much complicatedness.

56
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:45,069
Speaker 0: I don't understand well enough.

57
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,220
Speaker 1: This is eight players so only five religions can be founded.

58
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:53,214
Speaker 1: I didn't know that so you could just let other people's religions come in.

59
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:54,076
Speaker 0: and what do they do?

60
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,440
Speaker 0: for if they come in on?

61
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:56,858
Speaker 1: Me they don't hurt you.

62
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:57,152
Speaker 1: Yeah.

63
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,019
Speaker 0: So what's the problem?

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,159
Speaker 1: But the person who's spreading them get like you get a boon and the person spreading it gets like a double boom.

65
00:04:04,179 --> 00:04:04,580
Speaker 0: That's all right.

66
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,020
Speaker 0: I'll send my great musician to play non religious music all over their country.

67
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:16,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, you come for the culture victory who knows, but if I get a great musician And I don't have a spot for great music in my Cathedral or some shit guess where he going.

68
00:04:16,962 --> 00:04:19,052
Speaker 1: Yeah, it puts a lot of tourism if you get.

69
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:24,780
Speaker 1: because the thing is if you get tourism Early game and you've there's some other players that don't have a lot of culture output.

70
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:26,759
Speaker 0: What's the earliest terrorism you can get?

71
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:29,099
Speaker 0: There's someone not easy to get it.

72
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,044
Speaker 1: There are some wonders.

73
00:04:30,064 --> 00:04:33,380
Speaker 1: they give it to you like right the fuck away, which one I don't remember off.

74
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:34,347
Speaker 0: I haven't seen any.

75
00:04:34,368 --> 00:04:35,698
Speaker 1: I never go for that.

76
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:41,880
Speaker 1: Also, the musicians will give a one-time cult like tourism bonus like against one player like right away.

77
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:47,859
Speaker 1: But yeah, I've been playing a lot of sit five and I gotta play a lot less at five while I'm playing sit five.

78
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:50,230
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

79
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,280
Speaker 0: I do have some news.

80
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,520
Speaker 0: So I'm having a lack of you know.

81
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,219
Speaker 0: It's a little bit of video game season right now staying inside in the cold.

82
00:04:56,641 --> 00:05:01,640
Speaker 0: But I'm having trouble finding a multiplayer video game that you know, we'll talk about this in the main bit.

83
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a multiplayer video game I can play online that is fit in the bills Of the things that I need.

84
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:08,909
Speaker 0: so what's your bill?

85
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,440
Speaker 0: Cuz counter-strike like there's so we'll talk about that later.

86
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,772
Speaker 0: But a game that I used to play a lot multiplayer online and s2.

87
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:18,660
Speaker 1: Ooh, I stopped playing that a long time ago.

88
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:35,700
Speaker 0: I'm playing a long time ago also, but NS to natural selection - if you didn't know They basically stopped updating it and let the community update it and they the unknown worlds the company that makes it left Said all right you community volunteers can work on NS - we're gonna work on this alien ocean game called subnautica.

89
00:05:35,821 --> 00:05:41,589
Speaker 0: That's still being developed and I'm excited for subnautica, but it's not.

90
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,380
Speaker 0: it's not out yet, and I'm not really interested in the early beta play.

91
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,416
Speaker 0: I'm just waiting for it to be done.

92
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:45,639
Speaker 0: done.

93
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:49,244
Speaker 0: They decided hey, you know what we're gonna.

94
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:57,990
Speaker 0: Do is we're going to take some of those community and as two people and We're gonna hire them for as real employees now.

95
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,360
Speaker 1: That is how counter-strike went from good to great.

96
00:06:01,481 --> 00:06:02,978
Speaker 0: That's right, and we're gonna say you know what?

97
00:06:04,561 --> 00:06:10,586
Speaker 0: We are going to give you three months and see if you can You know revive this game.

98
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:11,992
Speaker 0: Can you build the player base?

99
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,760
Speaker 0: Can you improve the game now?

100
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,480
Speaker 1: That's real interesting because I have this like I loved natural selection like I played the fuck out of that game.

101
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you know.

102
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,561
Speaker 0: It's like this game is still some mildly active You know.

103
00:06:23,581 --> 00:06:28,740
Speaker 0: but can you community people if we hire you and that's all you work on can you revitalize this game?

104
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,204
Speaker 0: And if you do you know?

105
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:33,635
Speaker 0: maybe sales of you know new people coming in or right?

106
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:37,931
Speaker 0: yeah, so the new The original team was like 24 people.

107
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:48,686
Speaker 0: the current team is eight people gaga and if they can revive and like at the first patch that they release I'm gonna go reinstall the NS2 and I'm gonna see what's different.

108
00:06:48,727 --> 00:06:50,739
Speaker 0: since I played probably do that probably a whole bunch.

109
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:54,556
Speaker 0: I'm gonna see if anyone's playing it, and I'm gonna go ruin their game because I'm gonna suck.

110
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:58,630
Speaker 1: you know The reasons I stopped playing NS2.

111
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:06,560
Speaker 1: one of them is something we'll talk about in this in the real part of the show But the other part is I liked NS1 a lot partly because it was kind of weird.

112
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:06,962
Speaker 1: It's like.

113
00:07:07,183 --> 00:07:14,979
Speaker 1: I think I liked it for a lot of the reasons that people like the original dota Like it's kind of jank and broken and as one was jank NS2 was there.

114
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,127
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's like the original NS.

115
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,332
Speaker 0: That was both NS's.

116
00:07:18,473 --> 00:07:18,714
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

117
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:20,080
Speaker 0: I just maybe on slot when I go home.

118
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:26,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the original natural selection was really fun, but a lot of things I liked were the kind of weird broken bullshit things that would happen.

119
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:35,290
Speaker 1: I like the core gameplay Yeah, but I like the core gameplay in the earlier days when the matches lasted a lot longer Even though it wasn't as good of a game in a lot of ways.

120
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,510
Speaker 0: well.

121
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,477
Speaker 0: That's a fundamental problem of gaming.

122
00:07:37,497 --> 00:07:41,917
Speaker 1: yeah But the game like when they polished it with NS2.

123
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:58,711
Speaker 1: it Felt a lot like when Civ 5 first came out before the expansions because Civ 5 was like the most polished Civilization game you could possibly make and as a result like there was no emergent gameplay And it was really boring Civ 5 was not worth playing until brave new world came out.

124
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:10,299
Speaker 1: so NS2 like such people in it Polished the game a lot and I remember wanting to like it But in any I ended up over time enjoying it less.

125
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:14,234
Speaker 1: But I think that's because of it also failed in the part.

126
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:15,539
Speaker 1: We'll talk about next mm-hmm.

127
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is really interesting though.

128
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:21,800
Speaker 1: I wish them the best of luck because the concept of NS is so solid.

129
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,652
Speaker 1: I love that game.

130
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:24,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

131
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,558
Speaker 0: well You know they released tribes too recently or all the tribes games for free legally recently.

132
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:33,140
Speaker 1: all right We're gonna get in on that, but you still can't really play it online.

133
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,363
Speaker 0: Convenient it's like.

134
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:39,703
Speaker 0: you can install it, but it's crashed for me, and you can't play it online conveniently It's not.

135
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:44,000
Speaker 0: you know they didn't really put in the full effort of reviving it setting up servers and all that kind.

136
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know I gotta look into if there's a way to make that stable.

137
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,482
Speaker 0: Here's the.

138
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:53,098
Speaker 0: you know here's the setup dot exe and here's a CD key and which you didn't even need to type in.

139
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,046
Speaker 1: and yeah But at least it's a setup exe.

140
00:08:55,107 --> 00:08:55,689
Speaker 1: I can trust.

141
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,040
Speaker 1: instead of yeah set up exe from bit.

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,472
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean I have the CD-ROM probably somewhere you could use.

143
00:09:00,532 --> 00:09:05,493
Speaker 1: Oh, I know where the CD-ROM is But anyway, so yeah, but NS2.

144
00:09:05,553 --> 00:09:06,760
Speaker 0: You know is a legit game.

145
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,340
Speaker 0: You can play without those kinds of technical problems, and I'm sure there's someone playing it.

146
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel I mean some of eight people are dad dedicated to the community.

147
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,446
Speaker 0: They would get hired.

148
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,100
Speaker 0: there's definitely enough people playing it.

149
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,638
Speaker 1: Well you know things that are hurting the community more so now.

150
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,900
Speaker 1: So as you might have noticed I've streamed twice.

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:39,591
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish the stream this week possibly after Thanksgiving because I got food to eat, but I've been playing undertale which is sort of a shmup slash bullet hell slash earthbound RPG game all right released by Toby Fox.

152
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:41,116
Speaker 0: I don't know who that is.

153
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:44,264
Speaker 0: what else did that person make Mostly known for music.

154
00:09:44,906 --> 00:09:45,288
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

155
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:46,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the game hurt.

156
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:47,295
Speaker 0: really good music.

157
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:52,392
Speaker 1: the game has an Amazing soundtrack all right there you go like so amazing.

158
00:09:52,432 --> 00:09:55,341
Speaker 1: you should probably just go listen to the soundtrack even if you never play The game.

159
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,144
Speaker 0: it's on Spotify.

160
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:57,810
Speaker 1: Uh it's on YouTube.

161
00:09:58,392 --> 00:09:58,954
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good enough.

162
00:09:59,055 --> 00:09:59,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, YouTube red.

163
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:00,400
Speaker 0: It's good though.

164
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:01,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do red tube.

165
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:03,355
Speaker 1: Yep listen to it on the red tube.

166
00:10:03,576 --> 00:10:04,320
Speaker 0: It's just YouTube red.

167
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:16,259
Speaker 1: but the game is Really really fun and a lot of people I know are avoiding playing undertale because they saw the fandom going.

168
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,039
Speaker 0: ape shit Isn't it just like a 4chan homestuck kind of things?

169
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,361
Speaker 0: Stylistically.

170
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:25,096
Speaker 0: uh you know people say that but no I get I get that feels from looking at it.

171
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:30,732
Speaker 1: the homestuck has this like Incomprehensible nonsense story and all these like deep inside jokes.

172
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:36,720
Speaker 0: isn't it a fucked up internet shit kind of thing like you like Not even close, so it's more like Madoka actually.

173
00:10:37,783 --> 00:10:41,105
Speaker 1: Or imagine if earthbound Got.

174
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,339
Speaker 0: earthbound has some of that too.

175
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:46,099
Speaker 1: Yeah so imagine if earthbound itself got the Madoka treatment and when?

176
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:47,566
Speaker 1: Kind of what?

177
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:52,499
Speaker 1: if this was really the kind of game you think it is like let's go Okay, but it's short too.

178
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:07,902
Speaker 1: It's basically the game is sort of you you're a human and you fall into the underworld and there's all this drama And you kind of go around and it's RPG combat except you can fight Or you can just talk to people like in a visual novel and Spoilers.

179
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:11,803
Speaker 1: the game pretty much says like in the beginning you meet a great character and she's like.

180
00:11:12,346 --> 00:11:13,893
Speaker 1: maybe you should just talk to people like.

181
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,748
Speaker 1: maybe you shouldn't kill people and You can kill people or not people?

182
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:19,154
Speaker 1: you can kill her if you want to.

183
00:11:19,214 --> 00:11:26,860
Speaker 1: you can kill your mom like right away And just go nuts and you can kill fucking everybody if you want to can even kill that snowman you meet or not kill them.

184
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, does that mean I don't have to do stupid RPG combat?

185
00:11:29,962 --> 00:11:30,423
Speaker 1: Yes, you.

186
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 1: instead the RPG combat could boil down to in a puzzle combined with a bullet hell.

187
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:41,179
Speaker 0: But that I still have to do it to talk to people, but even I don't kill anyone.

188
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:42,720
Speaker 1: You're gonna fight people.

189
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,072
Speaker 0: It's just I don't want to fight people.

190
00:11:44,113 --> 00:11:50,660
Speaker 1: be like attack And you'll be like mercy or you'll be like try to flirt with them or ask them about their head.

191
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:56,180
Speaker 1: Oh, but then I have to do a puzzle or well No The puzzle is what do you talk to them about or ask them about?

192
00:11:56,601 --> 00:12:03,985
Speaker 1: Like you can figure out if you're smart the ways to get people to back off and then in the fighting part It's pretty much as bullet hell.

193
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:05,289
Speaker 1: move your little heart around.

194
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,554
Speaker 0: I don't want to do that part.

195
00:12:06,614 --> 00:12:08,240
Speaker 1: Why not do you ever play Gradius?

196
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I'm gonna play Gradius, I'll just play fucking Gradius or G Darius with the giant fish robots.

197
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,167
Speaker 1: Oh, it's up your alley.

198
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:23,434
Speaker 1: play the game up until cool, dude Happens with papyrus, and if you don't laugh out loud at that cool, dude and papyrus.

199
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,420
Speaker 0: this sounds internet weird shit like you.

200
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:34,439
Speaker 1: It's not because when you know internet weird shit, like the Homestuck fandom kind of nonsense is Kind of immersed in the obtuseness of itself.

201
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,705
Speaker 1: Undertale is not obtuse.

202
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:37,969
Speaker 1: It is direct.

203
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,915
Speaker 1: It is telling you what is going on.

204
00:12:39,935 --> 00:12:45,139
Speaker 1: There's no like deep Mystery, but aesthetically it's all.

205
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:47,929
Speaker 1: Why would you say it's weird?

206
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:51,040
Speaker 1: you're basing that solely on the fandom nonsense and not the game itself.

207
00:12:51,363 --> 00:12:53,139
Speaker 1: The game itself is just characters talking to you.

208
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,731
Speaker 0: I saw pictures of the game and it looked like that kind of stuff.

209
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:57,600
Speaker 1: Well, what defines that kind of stuff?

210
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,124
Speaker 0: It's hard to define.

211
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would not say it's that I'll think about it.

212
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,280
Speaker 1: I think I'll just say this a lot of people are avoiding this game because of the fandom.

213
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:13,040
Speaker 1: Imagine all of you who are doing that right now if you avoided Steven Universe because of the fandom.

214
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:15,113
Speaker 0: I know I don't judge anything by the fandom.

215
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,220
Speaker 0: I judge the thing by the thing.

216
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, most people who are avoiding undertale are avoiding it because of the fandom and because they see porn on tumblr.

217
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,064
Speaker 0: I don't care fortune.

218
00:13:22,084 --> 00:13:22,808
Speaker 0: people like a thing.

219
00:13:22,848 --> 00:13:25,620
Speaker 0: They like Monica - it's like yeah, you know, they like Yotsuba.

220
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,800
Speaker 0: That's their mascot, but I love Yotsuba, right?

221
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,888
Speaker 0: I guess I do with the fandom.

222
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:32,068
Speaker 0: it has to do with you know It looks like a particular aesthetic.

223
00:13:32,108 --> 00:13:35,000
Speaker 0: that is not my tea, but I guess of course no tea is my tea.

224
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,034
Speaker 1: I don't like tea will give you a bunch of nonsense that you basically need to read.

225
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:39,777
Speaker 1: lore and like.

226
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:40,600
Speaker 1: do about you like it's not.

227
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,438
Speaker 1: You can't really just figure it out at face value.

228
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,664
Speaker 1: Undertale is not subtle.

229
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,532
Speaker 1: It has subtle elements, but it is not subtle.

230
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:52,609
Speaker 1: It is telling you everything just like Monica is Telling you everything.

231
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,365
Speaker 1: you watch Monica and it's like Toward the end.

232
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:58,120
Speaker 1: you can step back and be like, okay that all makes a hundred percent sense.

233
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,791
Speaker 1: Now that I figured out what the deal is you didn't figure out.

234
00:14:00,811 --> 00:14:01,816
Speaker 0: they told you what to do with.

235
00:14:02,097 --> 00:14:09,619
Speaker 1: yeah, but you Figure things out and they tell you things at the end and it all makes sense and you could have figured out pieces along.

236
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,967
Speaker 1: the Undertale is like that stuff happens.

237
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:15,217
Speaker 1: And if you read the words you can figure out what's going on.

238
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:16,220
Speaker 1: It's not like homestuck.

239
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:21,380
Speaker 1: The music also really makes this game great, but I'm gonna continue live-streaming it.

240
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,620
Speaker 1: So if you can if you're not convinced I guess you can just watch my live stream until you figure out if the game is something you want to play or not.

241
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,574
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll compete with your live stream and just stream earthbound.

242
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:33,819
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, you can't beat that.

243
00:14:34,781 --> 00:14:38,252
Speaker 1: Yeah, but earthbound has random encounter fights for me to watch.

244
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,640
Speaker 0: well actually earthbound is the one great game.

245
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,280
Speaker 0: And yeah when you eventually get high enough level, they'll definitely get high enough level right away.

246
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,789
Speaker 0: I know snakes just like oh a snake.

247
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,414
Speaker 0: Oh shit is nest get the fuck out of here.

248
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:52,572
Speaker 0: Oh, no Look at that baseball bat.

249
00:14:52,612 --> 00:14:55,195
Speaker 0: That's a snake-beaten bat Isn't it no seal club?

250
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,624
Speaker 1: But say neat thing is is that everything you do matters in a little way like at the end of the game like Chrono trigger.

251
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:03,187
Speaker 0: Yeah.

252
00:15:03,227 --> 00:15:05,016
Speaker 1: Well way more than chrono trigger.

253
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:05,920
Speaker 1: I'll see.

254
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,340
Speaker 1: Yeah No Jigga, I would not watch a chrono trigger stream.

255
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:15,030
Speaker 1: I watched the chrono trigger speedrun and that was enough for me.

256
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:15,993
Speaker 0: Ooh, I should watch that.

257
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:17,017
Speaker 1: It was good.

258
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:17,760
Speaker 1: It was real good.

259
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,147
Speaker 0: Three real good.

260
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,755
Speaker 0: How do you deal with the speedy bike part?

261
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:25,631
Speaker 1: Uh Yeah, they talk a lot about the speedy bike part rail.

262
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,117
Speaker 1: That is not a happy time.

263
00:15:27,137 --> 00:15:37,185
Speaker 1: No The craziest thing about it is how much randomness manipulation they do to make fights end quickly because the character will be standing in the Right spot at the right time.

264
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:39,859
Speaker 1: because some bullshit they did like walking around before.

265
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,729
Speaker 1: Like it was kind of crazy.

266
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,859
Speaker 1: I wish the game was that fast when I just played it.

267
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:56,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm playing undertale and my official geek bite having played a significant percentage of the game Is that it is definitely worth playing and it's not even that expensive.

268
00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:57,146
Speaker 0: How much is it?

269
00:15:57,548 --> 00:15:58,031
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

270
00:15:58,051 --> 00:15:59,438
Speaker 1: I just bought on Steam like ten bucks.

271
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:01,167
Speaker 0: Mmm, that's so much.

272
00:16:01,207 --> 00:16:02,836
Speaker 0: I'm paying for fallout for next year.

273
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,723
Speaker 1: Yeah next year I can play this right now.

274
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:10,860
Speaker 1: I might I might play 15 bucks for fallout if I get all the DLC in the package.

275
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,538
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

276
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,282
Speaker 1: So now I got weird internet shit for you.

277
00:16:20,303 --> 00:16:29,410
Speaker 1: This is a mashup of The fights and the events of undertale with the old spice guy.

278
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,156
Speaker 1: Alright, it's kind of great.

279
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,542
Speaker 0: Okay, is that it?

280
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:33,983
Speaker 0: That's it.

281
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,530
Speaker 0: Okay, watch it some dude.

282
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:41,401
Speaker 0: I think his name is Nick Luciano because that's the name of his YouTube channel But it might not be his name.

283
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:44,944
Speaker 0: his dad Is an awesome dad in?

284
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:56,134
Speaker 0: This video his dad performs The victory poses of all of the combatants in Street Fighter 2.

285
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:56,827
Speaker 0: That's the video.

286
00:16:57,652 --> 00:17:02,310
Speaker 0: Dad must like Street Fighter 2 or be really willing to make a funny video with his son Nick.

287
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,539
Speaker 0: That is so great way to go dad.

288
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,442
Speaker 0: great video.

289
00:17:07,145 --> 00:17:07,767
Speaker 0: Nice doll seam.

290
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:12,005
Speaker 1: Yeah In the meta moment wheel of time was the book club.

00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:19,362
Speaker 0: I'm reading comics lately.

296
00:17:19,522 --> 00:17:20,426
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna.

297
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,230
Speaker 0: it's not Wednesday.

298
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,022
Speaker 0: There isn't gonna be a Wednesday episode for a while.

299
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:28,299
Speaker 0: So I just want to let everyone know Master Keaton is being published in English.

300
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,183
Speaker 0: I got volume.

301
00:17:29,485 --> 00:17:31,411
Speaker 0: I got volume 4.

302
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:36,150
Speaker 0: There's way more master Keaton than there is in the anime, even though a lot of it overlaps and it's the same story.

303
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, is it worth reading compared to just watching all the anime?

304
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:41,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

305
00:17:41,864 --> 00:17:45,777
Speaker 0: because I like the anime a lot and Gun in the origin manga is almost done.

306
00:17:45,797 --> 00:17:46,902
Speaker 1: No, I gotta read that.

307
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,469
Speaker 1: I really gotta read that.

308
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:51,770
Speaker 1: But otherwise, we're gonna be a magfest.

309
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,896
Speaker 1: Panels are like getting sorted out.

310
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:54,841
Speaker 0: Am I gonna be at breakfast?

311
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:56,207
Speaker 1: Well, you're on a bunch of panels.

312
00:17:56,649 --> 00:17:56,890
Speaker 0: Am I?

313
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, my name's on there.

00:17:58,401 --> 00:17:59,269
Speaker 1: I put you on them.

315
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,469
Speaker 1: Okay, if I can see well, I guess I can't announce what you're on right now.

316
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,454
Speaker 0: But are they panels?

317
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:05,283
Speaker 0: I can do I think so without preparing you.

318
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:05,645
Speaker 1: Yeah.

319
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:10,350
Speaker 0: Yeah Scott I mean am I getting a badge but not gonna have like a trouble when I go to get the badge?

320
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,858

Speaker 0: I filled out the thing and I never heard anything.

324
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:19,270
Speaker 1: cuz yeah, you waited like months before filling out the thing.

325
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,581
Speaker 1: I sent you that link like 11 times.

326
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,581
Speaker 1: This is why I'm the producer and you're the host.

327

Speaker 0: filled it out.

328
00:18:25,947 --> 00:18:26,450
Speaker 1: I'll sort it out.

329
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,477
Speaker 1: But yeah, you're at a bunch of panels.

330
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,415
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really want to be on the panel They just want to go.

331
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,489
Speaker 0: well, you can find place in space war.

332
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:36,163
Speaker 1: Well, then you can buy a badge and just go and I'll do all the panels.

333
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like being on the panel.

334
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,521
Speaker 0: Hey, but I put you I'm gonna pay.

335
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:41,930
Speaker 0: I'm a little bit quarters in the space war.

336
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:42,937
Speaker 1: I put you where did?

337
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,650
Speaker 1: there's an eSports panel that we're both on.

338
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:48,549
Speaker 1: Okay, just talking about like the current state basically eSports stuff that you weren't allowed to say.

339
00:18:49,572 --> 00:18:55,119
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I'm not allowed to say anything scheduled or anything and Probably redoing the far future of gaming.

340
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,239
Speaker 1: I did not put you on that one because What I plan to do is like it has you going.

341
00:19:00,701 --> 00:19:04,716
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, he's gonna be on much of the panels But I'm gonna record.

342
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:08,372
Speaker 1: I'm gonna also video that panel if they let us do it at magfest, you know Why.

343
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:12,334
Speaker 0: he actually called me randomly Recently recently.

344
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,721
Speaker 1: I you I was talking to.

345
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:18,438
Speaker 0: he was like in the city and he's like hey And I was like, oh wow, I was playing netrunner.

346
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:18,799
Speaker 0: that's right.

347
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,550
Speaker 1: that was not recently it was that was a while ago.

348
00:19:22,731 --> 00:19:29,288
Speaker 1: I remember cuz we Emily and I were not home Like we were actually out of town and not like yeah enough to hang out.

349
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:29,750
Speaker 0: That's right.

350
00:19:29,851 --> 00:19:30,636
Speaker 0: That's when that was.

351
00:19:30,858 --> 00:19:32,409
Speaker 1: that was a long time ago Scott.

352
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:36,224
Speaker 1: Anyway, when you said recently I was like what this week now see in town.

353
00:19:36,324 --> 00:19:36,726
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

354
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:37,810
Speaker 1: No go hang out.

355
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:38,894
Speaker 0: Not that we do some stuff.

356
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:39,898
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

357
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:42,690
Speaker 1: So what I plan to do, this is like secret spoilers for people.

358
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:50,905
Speaker 1: So you actually listen to the show is I'm take the video of the far future of gaming panel We had at PAX and the far future of gaming panel that I hope will be doing at magfest.

359
00:19:51,246 --> 00:20:00,000
Speaker 1: combine them together like the highlights and like the important answers instead of just here's a video of the panel and Then I'm gonna interview some people as well.

360
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:06,845
Speaker 1: and instead of just putting up a video of a panel It's gonna be a documentary except it's only gonna be like two hours long two hours.

361
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:16,547
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe an hour and a half We'll see what I cut it down into but this is an experiment Because it's a two-hour documentary is something that you should kick-start.

362
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:17,149
Speaker 1: I'm big.

363
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:29,401
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, maybe I will kick-start it once I have like enough together Like I got to make sure that I'll have enough content from two goings of this panel at two different conventions To be worth continuing and doing something weird with it.

364
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:30,686
Speaker 1: reason I'm doing this?

365
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:39,070
Speaker 1: because I've noticed that people watch the videos of our lectures But Almost no one watches the videos of panels on game design.

366
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,249
Speaker 1: They only watch videos of panels if it's someone who's famous just completely on their own.

367
00:20:44,252 --> 00:20:47,090
Speaker 1: They don't give a shit about like a panel on game design for the most part.

368
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:52,146
Speaker 1: So I want to see if there's a way to make that popular or make that watched by people.

369
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:52,687
Speaker 1: Mmm.

370
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:53,430
Speaker 1: That's my plan.

371
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:58,651
Speaker 1: Also, I'm just sick of putting up a video like we do the same panel 15 times Right?

372
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:06,527
Speaker 0: other meta things in the meta moment this Thursday in the United States in case you don't live here or know about here Is the Thanksgiving which you talked about in a previous episode?

373
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:12,305
Speaker 1: Yep Uh, will there be a Thursday episode only if we record one right after we record this?

374
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:13,950
Speaker 1: Otherwise, no unlikely.

375
00:21:14,312 --> 00:21:21,490
Speaker 0: So yeah, look for geek nights in the early weeks of December But probably not the late weeks of December or the early weeks of January.

376
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably in the mid January because I think the magfest is in the late January.

377
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,070
Speaker 1: Yep, and actually babe end of January February is rough because then we got packed south.

378
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:35,607
Speaker 0: I'm flying from an animo move Boston animal and impacts East are coming right after that.

379
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,469
Speaker 0: Yeah I should tell work about those things.

380
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:39,776
Speaker 1: Oh, I can think I got a deal.

381
00:21:39,796 --> 00:21:42,066
Speaker 1: I got finished sorting out the anime Boston stuff, right?

382
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:47,323
Speaker 1: Yeah Otherwise, yeah geek nights join our patreon and buy our t-shirt.

383
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,470
Speaker 0: No don't save your money.

384
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:52,509
Speaker 1: So I don't play rocket league that much anymore.

385
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,109
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I love rocket league is a great game.

386
00:21:55,491 --> 00:22:00,556
Speaker 0: But after playing it like I started playing it a lot say the past week I was playing it like hours a day.

387
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:03,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, and because you were playing I started playing again in over the weekend.

388
00:22:03,651 --> 00:22:05,620
Speaker 0: I played it a whole bunch two nights ago.

389
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,510
Speaker 1: I just started up rocket League.

390
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,699
Speaker 1: I was like, oh Scott's playing I'll play and I hit find me a game.

391
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:11,361
Speaker 1: matchmaker.

392
00:22:11,421 --> 00:22:18,165
Speaker 1: matchmaker find me a game and I sat there For like ten minutes with it not finding me a game.

393
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:19,550
Speaker 0: Whoa, that barely happens.

394
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually puts me and it kept saying messages like expanding the skill group.

395
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,750
Speaker 1: We'll look at expanding the regions and then it put me in a game in Europe.

396
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:29,250
Speaker 1: So my ping was like a hundred and sixty.

397
00:22:29,293 --> 00:22:35,533
Speaker 0: well I've never had that happen and I always get a game in the East and I was like and it doesn't take long to put Me in a game.

398
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,107
Speaker 1: I think it's cuz I haven't played much to the matchmaking decided.

399
00:22:38,127 --> 00:22:38,710
Speaker 1: I was terrible.

400
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:42,942
Speaker 1: So it matched me with people who I'm bad at rocket League.

401
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:44,025
Speaker 1: Like don't get me wrong.

402
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:47,769
Speaker 1: I was neo compared to these people.

403
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:57,476
Speaker 0: So yeah Yeah So thing is we're used to use rocket League is the example because that's what brought this topic Fucked by this real hard.

404
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:04,221
Speaker 0: There are basically almost no games ever To have gotten this right counter-strike.

405
00:23:04,522 --> 00:23:06,229
Speaker 0: counter-strike has it mostly right?

406
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,687
Speaker 0: Starcraft has it mostly right.

407
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:11,393
Speaker 0: ish Chess.

408
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:12,800
Speaker 0: chess has it right.

409
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:14,247
Speaker 0: chess has a system I guess.

410
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:20,330
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, so the problem is matchmaking specifically with online video games with random opponents.

411
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,030
Speaker 1: Yep, wait the situation is even more so with random teams.

412
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:29,490
Speaker 1: Yeah with just random opponents, which means rocket League NS - right out of strike.

413
00:23:29,731 --> 00:23:34,745
Speaker 0: So you would probably agree most people would agree rocket League is a fun game or say basketball.

414
00:23:34,805 --> 00:23:36,370
Speaker 0: basketball is a fun game, right?

415
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,410
Speaker 0: But there is a problem which we have talked about many times in the past, which is the air hockey problem.

416
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:43,896
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go play some basketball.

417
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,381
Speaker 0: Let's say me and rim play basketball.

418
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,068
Speaker 0: That'll probably be okay, right?

419
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,035
Speaker 1: Yep Both suck.

420
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:53,650
Speaker 0: rim is probably more athletically inclined but like Scott have more basketball skills.

421
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:57,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, my my free thrower percentage is like 12% like.

422
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,890
Speaker 0: I think I think I could make it like, you know ridiculous percent.

423
00:24:00,971 --> 00:24:01,536
Speaker 0: I don't understand how.

424
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:02,121
Speaker 0: NBA players.

425
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,089
Speaker 0: There's a low percentage.

426
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,841
Speaker 0: Yeah back in when I was like in middle school.

427
00:24:05,981 --> 00:24:08,050
Speaker 0: I was like, I basically didn't miss free throws.

428
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:15,546
Speaker 0: I didn't stand there as long as you want Right, but anyway, it'll probably be reasonably fun.

429
00:24:15,566 --> 00:24:17,233
Speaker 0: now Basketball.

430
00:24:17,273 --> 00:24:22,150
Speaker 0: the game is fun to play but if I had to play against LeBron, right?

431
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,225
Speaker 0: Suddenly, even though it's the same goddamn game because my opponent's skill level is so high.

432
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:28,510
Speaker 0: That is not fun.

433
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:37,514
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get to do any of the fun things that there are in basketball like touching the ball Shooting the ball dribbling the ball Blocking shot.

434
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:38,860
Speaker 0: I'll be able to do none of those things.

435
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,885
Speaker 0: LeBron will stand there.

436
00:24:39,905 --> 00:24:41,010
Speaker 0: He'll be really tall.

437
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:43,790
Speaker 0: He'll shoot it right into the net immediately.

438
00:24:44,111 --> 00:24:48,249
Speaker 0: I can't do anything about it because I can't jump that high to reach where he his hands are now.

439
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,030
Speaker 1: Imagine this is even worse than a team game.

440
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:57,181
Speaker 0: then if I if he gives me the ball and I start with it, he'll immediately steal it from me and there's nothing I Can do about it and then he'll put it in the net again.

441
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,466
Speaker 1: Let's do it on a team instead.

442
00:24:58,506 --> 00:25:02,289
Speaker 1: So it's three LeBron's versus two Jordans and Scott.

443
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:03,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

444
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:09,450
Speaker 0: So they you know, the two Jordan team is gonna have a little trouble because who's covering that third LeBron?

445
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:24,765
Speaker 0: Third LeBron is pretty much it's gonna you know, there's no fright, you know even or how about this a LeBron and two Scots right, yeah versus Three like college basketball players like average, you know, they're good at basketball.

446
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:26,330
Speaker 1: that might actually be a good matchup.

447
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,354
Speaker 0: It's possible.

448
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:28,580
Speaker 0: It could be a good man here.

449
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,929
Speaker 1: Even if it is a good matchup Scott's not having fun?

450
00:25:31,452 --> 00:25:32,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's not having fun.

451
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:36,050
Speaker 0: First of all, also I'm betting on the LeBron and two Scots.

452
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:40,973
Speaker 0: I think it's the game as such is an aspect of the game that you know You look at.

453
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:45,169
Speaker 0: even in the NBA a LeBron and four schmoes can beat five okay players.

454
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:46,743
Speaker 1: Women's hockey is like that.

455
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:52,330
Speaker 1: specifically too Like if there's one player who's really good because the you know, because the league is not does not support the players.

456
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,440
Speaker 1: Well, there isn't like a deep well to draw from.

457
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:02,149
Speaker 1: so if you've got like two really good stick handlers They just walk around scoring like boop boop boop.

458
00:26:02,551 --> 00:26:13,384
Speaker 0: Exactly so, you know in Rocket League, especially if you've got I guess the Michael Jordan of Rocket League is this guy named chrono V. So if chrono V's on your team is chrono V and two Scots, right?

459
00:26:13,424 --> 00:26:17,029
Speaker 0: Well, I know chrono V and two rims versus three Scots.

460
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,910
Speaker 0: The two rims just sit in the two rims and the three Scots will do nothing.

461
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,561
Speaker 0: Well, the chrono V just puts the ball in the net repeatedly.

462
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:23,842
Speaker 0: Boom.

463
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:24,103
Speaker 0: Boom.

464
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,870
Speaker 0: Boom go go and there's nothing we can do about it.

465
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,573
Speaker 0: in my heart we try.

466
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:36,830
Speaker 1: now what's interesting is that I was blind to this problem when I was in high school because I play, you know, I got really into FPS's and I played them all the time.

467
00:26:37,071 --> 00:26:42,370
Speaker 1: Yep, so I was in that upper like top tier in like capture the flag kinds of games.

468
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:50,476
Speaker 1: So to me like when Team Fortress 2 came out way later I didn't like it because all I could think of was wow I'm really good at this game and this.

469
00:26:50,636 --> 00:26:55,230
Speaker 1: and now Team Fortress 2 just hobbles me like it doesn't let me use my skill

470
00:26:55,591 --> 00:26:56,073
Speaker 0: Right, so

471
00:26:56,173 --> 00:27:06,390
Speaker 1: I'd be the dude with the grappling hook like flying around like if I get the flag I capture it and no one No one can stop me unless I'm playing on a private server with a bunch of pros.

472
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:13,682
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in a skill any skill based game Regardless of what the game is if it is a game that is truly testing skills.

473
00:27:14,324 --> 00:27:18,868
Speaker 0: The game will only be enjoyable even if the game itself is a really good game.

474
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:23,897
Speaker 0: a Skill game is almost universally Regardless of your taste.

475
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:30,970
Speaker 0: I mean you might really like getting your ass destroyed Someone way better than you or you might be a real asshole and really like beating up on players.

476
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,914
Speaker 0: You can't put up a fight.

477
00:27:32,356 --> 00:27:35,970
Speaker 0: Uh, but most people the majority of people do not enjoy that.

478
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,437
Speaker 0: They enjoy a good matchup right.

479
00:27:38,518 --> 00:27:45,618
Speaker 0: a skill based game becomes interesting and fun when you know It's slightly challenging for both players.

480
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:50,834
Speaker 0: Both players have a chance to win right and there's some meaningful competition.

481
00:27:50,895 --> 00:28:05,248
Speaker 0: me running a race against Usain Bolt is not interesting to spectate or Participate in but Usain Bolt versus whoever is the second fastest but not as fast as Usain Bolt becomes interesting because it's like maybe that guy improved since the last time we saw them race.

482
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:09,300
Speaker 1: now take Ice hockey or American football an example of a game.

483
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,290
Speaker 1: because the games are so widely played.

484
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:24,670
Speaker 1: There are so many levels of play from the NHL all the way down to like the local Ajo no, like local like kids playing ice hockey on a pond in the middle of Canada.

485
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:33,187
Speaker 1: Yep, so no matter how good or bad you are at that game There is a wide community of people who have the exact same skill level of or

486
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:37,531
Speaker 0: relatively, you know You might have a young Wayne Gretzky on your you know elementary school But then

487
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,642
Speaker 1: he could compete with people in a higher tier.

488
00:28:39,662 --> 00:28:41,010
Speaker 1: like that here exists, right?

489
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:48,990
Speaker 1: But with a video game that hasn't reached, you know Like in the old days where quake - like that was it like that was the game.

490
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:51,608
Speaker 1: So everyone playing FPS is we're playing quake - right?

491
00:28:51,970 --> 00:29:03,910
Speaker 0: So if you have a skill based game and you have random players on the internet playing Teams or not You need to somehow figure out how good people are and put them in games against other people of similar skill levels.

492
00:29:04,331 --> 00:29:06,897
Speaker 0: Otherwise, no one's going to have fun playing the game.

493
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:11,400
Speaker 0: Even if the game itself is Like basically rocket League really doesn't have enough many flaws.

494
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's.

495
00:29:12,203 --> 00:29:13,790
Speaker 0: I mean, it's so simple and pure.

496
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:24,101
Speaker 1: There's really nothing wrong with the game But it's not so widely played right that there is a wide body of players at every possible skill Let alone a good way to rank players skill, right?

497
00:29:24,121 --> 00:29:25,809
Speaker 0: Well, there is a good way to rank players skill.

498
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:32,390
Speaker 0: It's called Microsoft team score, which is the best way that's been invented so far and it's pretty good, but they don't use that.

499
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:39,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, so but yes, so the problem is how you know in it with the teams and the random players.

500
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:43,148
Speaker 0: how do you figure out how good someone is what team to put them on?

501
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:49,410
Speaker 0: and When there's not enough players like in your area of a similar skill level, you know rocket League.

502
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:55,106
Speaker 0: It says, you know in a few minutes as time goes by we're going to expand the skills.

503
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:56,329
Speaker 0: We will consider so great.

504
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,350
Speaker 1: So now it's LeBron's and people who literally don't have a control, right?

505
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:06,916
Speaker 0: They will air rather than make you wait for a half hour for like five other people of your skill level to show up And play with you.

506
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,386
Speaker 0: They will say alright fine We'll just play a game with who we've got even though their skill levels are have a disparity.

507
00:30:12,527 --> 00:30:18,631
Speaker 1: now as I noticed There aren't people that it determines to be at my skill level because it always does that to me immediately when I join a game Right.

508
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,742
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I have a higher skill level than you.

509
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:22,150
Speaker 0: I say a moderate skill level.

510
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,779
Speaker 0: I'm like, I know how to play.

511
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can control the card reasonably.

512
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,200
Speaker 0: Well, I can't do too many fancy aerials and hit.

513
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:33,628
Speaker 0: I make mistakes occasionally because I'm not perfect and I'm an old man with slow reaction times.

514
00:30:34,772 --> 00:30:38,030
Speaker 0: But I you know strategically like I stay on the right side of the ball.

515
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:42,530
Speaker 0: I make a lot of saves, you know, I generally ignore the general patterns, right?

516
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:56,028
Speaker 0: I'm slightly below average, you know mediocre type player, but I got you know, I got the shit down and Every single game I play I was actually writing them down for like like 10 20 games in a row.

517
00:30:56,048 --> 00:31:02,839
Speaker 0: No Every single game either a Someone on the other team had a skill level.

518
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,750
Speaker 0: There wasn't anyone like credo V level doing you know, ridiculous aerials.

519
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:16,366
Speaker 0: they were just slightly better than everyone else or having a really good game somehow and That allowed them to score like four or five goals and now every we.

520
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:17,450
Speaker 0: basically it was meaningless.

521
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,417
Speaker 0: I we should our team should forfeit.

522
00:31:19,457 --> 00:31:20,139
Speaker 0: sometimes we did.

523
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,925
Speaker 0: sometimes some idiot refused to.

524
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:25,054
Speaker 0: you had to waste the rest two minutes of Our lives waiting to lose.

525
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:25,816
Speaker 0: right.

526
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:45,058
Speaker 0: sometimes someone on our team was the best player and totally crushed the opponents And I just sat in the goal to making you know blocking some shots Maybe but the ball didn't even come to our end of the field because this good player on our team Was able to keep the ball on their end of the field and just keep scoring and I just watched myself win Which is also boring as hell.

527
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,063
Speaker 1: now part of like.

528
00:31:46,124 --> 00:31:47,330
Speaker 1: I can already see the problem, right?

529
00:31:47,430 --> 00:32:00,005
Speaker 0: And once I was the best player and I just went and scored like three goals and I didn't let the other team score I was able to get all the way back down the field and defend before they could get the ball back there Clear it to their end and score like I was just like wow.

530
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:01,170
Speaker 0: I'm really in control of this game.

531
00:32:02,391 --> 00:32:03,315
Speaker 0: did I get a lot better?

532
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:12,630
Speaker 0: and I tried that in the next game doing the same thing I did in the previous game and I wasn't able to because this really good player on the other team just came and fucked me over all the time.

533
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,430
Speaker 0: So so it really was a situation where I got matched up with people way under me right now on steam.

534
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:24,210
Speaker 1: There are like three hundred thousand people playing Dota 2 and like two hundred and fifty thousand people playing counter-strike.

535
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:26,176
Speaker 0: That is a critical mass right there.

536
00:32:26,818 --> 00:32:28,001
Speaker 1: and there are.

537
00:32:28,162 --> 00:32:30,067
Speaker 1: Rocket League is not even in the top ten.

538
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:32,319
Speaker 1: Rocket League's got about 17,000 right.

539
00:32:32,581 --> 00:32:35,114
Speaker 1: Rocket League is under Grand Theft Auto.

540
00:32:35,135 --> 00:32:36,499
Speaker 0: that's the binding of Isaac.

541
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:39,168
Speaker 0: 17,000 is all Rocket League players online.

542
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,333
Speaker 0: right now It doesn't.

543
00:32:40,453 --> 00:32:43,890
Speaker 0: so when I play Rocket League, I'm only choosing the solo queue.

544
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:51,810
Speaker 1: Yeah Right the solo queue has less than 2000 got five has twice as many people playing on a daily basis as Rocket League.

545
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,740
Speaker 0: Right and this that's not counting the PlayStation 4 players.

546
00:32:54,781 --> 00:33:00,023
Speaker 1: I don't think good who also are playing against Yeah, but I don't think it's much better over there.

547
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:01,390
Speaker 0: No, it's not really any different.

548
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:02,979
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is like.

549
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,380
Speaker 0: so even though Rocket League is a great game I want to play if you don't have enough people of the same skill level Then you can't play.

550
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,049
Speaker 0: it's not worth my time.

551
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:18,609
Speaker 0: And also even if there are enough people at the right skill level you have to figure out who they are.

552
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:20,836
Speaker 0: Alright, this is the real problem.

553
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:25,210
Speaker 0: is you know, how do you figure out who these people are in a reasonable way?

554
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:29,127
Speaker 0: Well, if you only playing one-on-one matches we have a system for that.

555
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:29,830
Speaker 0: it's called elo.

556
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,342
Speaker 1: It's not perfect but elo because it's not an acronym.

557
00:33:32,362 --> 00:33:33,126
Speaker 1: It's just a dude's name.

558
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:33,990
Speaker 0: That's fine.

559
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,338
Speaker 0: But I like to talk about the electric light Orchestra.

560
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,509
Speaker 0: They're really good at how you know, they know a lot about this sort of thing.

561
00:33:43,091 --> 00:33:51,739
Speaker 1: But yeah one-on-one there are many different algorithms that can pretty objectively say Here's the ranking of players in order.

562
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:52,161
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

563
00:33:52,462 --> 00:33:54,209
Speaker 0: But even then it works really well.

564
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:54,510
Speaker 0: in tennis.

565
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:55,553
Speaker 0: It's super accurate.

566
00:33:55,653 --> 00:34:03,530
Speaker 1: that only helps you if there is a deep well of players to draw from Mm-hmm as the well gets shallower and shallower.

567
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,930
Speaker 0: I mean the Rocket League well is deep enough for the one-on-one ranking system.

568
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:18,242
Speaker 1: maybe the problem is if a game has a very high skill cap a game like a counter-strike or a Rocket League or a Weapons factory or a dota then what you'll see is there isn't.

569
00:34:18,262 --> 00:34:27,908
Speaker 1: it's not like like saying like I am the hundred and eighth Strongest person on me pros island the hundred and seventh strongest person might be a hundred times better than me.

570
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:28,469
Speaker 0: That's true.

571
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:34,050
Speaker 1: You'll see that there'll be clusters of players in a few bands and huge gulfs between them.

572
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,360
Speaker 0: Usually that has to do with the mechanics of the game.

573
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,851
Speaker 0: For example in counter-strike, you know It's like.

574
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:40,181
Speaker 0: they'll be like sort of like the you're.

575
00:34:40,282 --> 00:34:47,893
Speaker 0: it's like you're good at counter-strike You got the fundamentals down and then like you master like actually aiming Yep, and so it's like.

576
00:34:47,914 --> 00:34:55,014
Speaker 0: this is particular skill that if you learn it like puts you way ahead of people who have not learned That particular skill.

577
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:59,030
Speaker 0: so they'll be like this huge gap between people who don't have it and people do like a tennis.

578
00:34:59,411 --> 00:35:07,014
Speaker 0: It's like if you learn the backhand and you can actually control and hit a decent backhand suddenly that puts you Way way up.

579
00:35:07,214 --> 00:35:12,394
Speaker 1: or like the serve like when you learn how to do a real serve instead of the tennis serve that most people Do and they write.

580
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:15,330
Speaker 1: it's like it's just like ace ace ace rice.

581
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:28,142
Speaker 0: There's like individual skills in these games that when you master them or at least develop them to a reasonable level Launches you into like a huge Huge gap between people have that skill and don't.

582
00:35:28,443 --> 00:35:30,270
Speaker 0: and this difference is multiple skills.

583
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:37,250
Speaker 0: There's multiple gaps right in between the groups of people who have or do not have you know, these skills developed within themselves.

584
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:46,904
Speaker 0: So in rocket League, it's aerials if you can, you know perform aerial maneuvers hit the ball when it's way up in the air Precisely, you know, you're way ahead of all these people who can't.

585
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:57,046
Speaker 0: and like it launches you way You know, it's like way up there and then people who can not only do that But also when they hit the aerial can hit the ball into towards the enemy net.

586
00:35:57,086 --> 00:35:58,090
Speaker 1: that will never happen.

587
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:03,050
Speaker 0: Accuracy on a consistent basis that puts you in the pro level, right?

588
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:12,529
Speaker 1: Yep so so if you see a game that has Like banding very distinctly where there's a bunch of players in these top tiers and a ton of players way at the bottom and big between them.

589
00:36:13,374 --> 00:36:22,430
Speaker 1: it's a self-fulfilling cycle that will only get worse because Anyone who gets good enough to get past those first bands will have no one to play with so they'll never get better.

590
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:31,850
Speaker 0: It's like if you can do a serve in tennis You can only play against opponents who can also serve well and return the serve Otherwise, it's like anyone who doesn't have that particular skill.

591
00:36:32,051 --> 00:36:33,839
Speaker 0: It's just like not even gonna play with.

592
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:45,431
Speaker 1: and if there's only seventeen thousand people playing on steam Like the odds of finding a team of people we haven't even gotten into how to rank teams Of a similar skill level for you to practice and get better are negligible and counter-strike 250,000 people.

593
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:50,158
Speaker 1: I think the peak was like 600,000 people playing the game.

594
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:53,711
Speaker 1: I'll just hit rando game and I'm pretty much guaranteed to find some people Right.

595
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:56,522
Speaker 0: So Rocket League has teams and here's the problem when you have teams.

596
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,923
Speaker 0: It's hard to just use some ELO system that's only based on winning and losing.

597
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:03,744
Speaker 0: because Did I win because I happen to have Lebron on my team?

598
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,869
Speaker 0: Am I gonna get credit for that?

599
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,829
Speaker 0: Did I lose because Lebron just happened to be on the other team and that reflects nothing about how good I am.

600
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:15,250
Speaker 0: Right, you know you're trying to figure out like, you know, this my particular skill level.

601
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:20,266
Speaker 0: But the only data you're using is whether my team won or lost.

602
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:21,310
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm really good.

603
00:37:21,591 --> 00:37:27,549
Speaker 0: I just had two really shitty teammates who really screwed it up for me and I'm not Lebron good So I couldn't win it on my own.

604
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:33,075
Speaker 0: But if I had two other people as good as me we could have beaten that opponent team, you know It's like so.

605
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:38,770
Speaker 0: but you're judging only on the wins and losses Whether my rank should go up or down and that's a problem with teams.

606
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:46,350
Speaker 0: You need something more advanced need more advanced data to figure out somebody's individual skill level when they're on a team.

607
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:56,970
Speaker 1: Now counter-strike has a very clever like modified elo system that it uses to rank teams Based on your contribution to the team and all these other fights.

608
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,928
Speaker 0: So it's theoretically possible that even if your team loses your secure rank could go up.

609
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:08,530
Speaker 0: If your individual skills are improving you just happen to get put on like shitty losing teams all day.

610
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:17,146
Speaker 0: Your rank could still be up at the end of the day Because you have you made major contributions to that team and it can tell oh you were just unlucky.

611
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,369
Speaker 0: your teammates ruined it for you.

612
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:22,230
Speaker 0: Right because it's judging you individually despite the fact that you're on a team.

613
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:28,335
Speaker 1: Yeah because you can sort of do this diff like even you can imagine algorithms that will look at the way a team a Person is performing.

614
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:30,910
Speaker 1: like alright this guy played on ten different teams.

615
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:36,343
Speaker 1: All the teams did worse when he was on them compared to similar teams without.

616
00:38:36,363 --> 00:38:41,560
Speaker 0: professional sports had been very very good at this For a very long time even before we had advanced analytics.

617
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:44,210
Speaker 0: We just regular player statistics, right?

618
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:51,399
Speaker 0: They knew Wayne Gretzky was the greatest even though he was on the LA Kings and didn't win anything Except for when he was on the Oilers.

619
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:54,541
Speaker 0: right because they're like, oh shit He scored like a million goals.

620
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:55,730
Speaker 0: his team just fucking sucks.

621
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,353
Speaker 0: So he lost.

622
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:57,035
Speaker 0: they could tell.

623
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:01,232
Speaker 0: you can watch the games and tell with and you don't even need to watch them To see.

624
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:06,550
Speaker 0: you can just look at the statistics and be like, wow, this guy scored more goals than like anyone ever.

625
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:09,627
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter that his team lost a million games.

626
00:39:09,928 --> 00:39:27,869
Speaker 0: clearly He is an amazing player Alright, and now we have an advanced analytics that eat tell you even more data than that where we can be like, aha Yeah, this picture is like the greatest picture like, you know in terms of that They're like there they have like all these crazy statistics now like wars and all kinds of not.

627
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:29,549
Speaker 1: well Look at fantasy sports like that.

628
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:37,050
Speaker 0: Mathematically and relatively empirically, you know calculate real numbers that tell you the value of that player.

629
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:44,049
Speaker 0: Like you will be expected to win this many more games if this player is on your team, right?

630
00:39:45,390 --> 00:40:06,030
Speaker 0: regardless of and that like you'll see nowadays like in baseball like people win the MVP award or like You know like all kinds of you know Trophies and awards at the end of the year like golden gloves and all these things even though their team sucked ass Because they can tell how good the player is based on all these statistics and analytics they have which aren't bullshit.

631
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:10,945
Speaker 1: So I guess the moral of all this is games that want to have a competitive scene.

632
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:17,945
Speaker 1: and it's interesting is this Primarily only applies to like eSports and video games skill and skill games.

633
00:40:18,065 --> 00:40:22,404
Speaker 0: if it's not as so because bork hardstone You don't need this because in hardstone It's mostly

634
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:27,666
Speaker 1: luck table like German style like table top board games that we like to play don't need this system because

635
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:28,208
Speaker 0: no teams

636
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:41,518
Speaker 1: well even even single-player you still need it like single-player games with board games as much because Those games tend to have a very short cycle like anyone who plays them enough and pays attention Will go from I don't know how to play to.

637
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,890
Speaker 1: I'm a near master of this game in a relatively short span of time Like and the skill cap isn't super ridiculously high.

638
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:57,641
Speaker 1: It's like you can't keep getting better at you know, like if you play fresh fish, which is a pretty good game right 20 times There is not much you can do to get better.

639
00:40:57,681 --> 00:41:02,600
Speaker 0: and if you're smart enough if you're smart enough to play fresh fish Enjoy it play it 20 times and get better at it.

640
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:04,508
Speaker 0: Right then you're smart enough to master it.

641
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:11,470
Speaker 0: I can't imagine someone who could play fresh fish 20 times want to play it understand the rules play it Well, and wouldn't master it in.

642
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:16,611
Speaker 1: Yeah, like by the end of like the Civ 5 we're all playing like we're all gonna be pretty good at Civ 5.

643
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:23,481
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a game that has dexterity components execution components There's like there's no limit to how good you could be.

644
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,430
Speaker 1: There's a theoretical limit, right?

645
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:28,602
Speaker 0: But it's like there's no hockey player in the league now who's weighing Gretzky?

646
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,510
Speaker 0: good and it's still possible.

647
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:33,410
Speaker 0: Someone could be even better than that is no reason you couldn't be there.

648
00:41:34,392 --> 00:41:40,430
Speaker 1: Like the laws of physics there could be a person who just reacts to pucks faster and is an unstoppable goalie, right?

649
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,173
Speaker 1: That could happen.

650
00:41:41,474 --> 00:41:42,720
Speaker 1: It's that what there's no what.

651
00:41:43,162 --> 00:41:44,066
Speaker 1: I want that data, huh?

652
00:41:44,147 --> 00:41:44,830
Speaker 1: I want that day to come.

653
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,124
Speaker 1: I'd love to see the god goalie.

654
00:41:46,447 --> 00:41:49,362
Speaker 0: Yeah We have the king goalie.

655
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:51,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to know something sad?

656
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:52,657
Speaker 0: How old is?

657
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,701
Speaker 1: Heinrich oh my god, they're all.

658
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:57,775
Speaker 1: he's got to be more like 31.

659
00:41:57,775 --> 00:42:06,394
Speaker 0: Heinrich Lundqvist is one Two actually two months Younger than me.

660
00:42:06,414 --> 00:42:09,443
Speaker 0: I mean older than me and younger than you.

661
00:42:09,463 --> 00:42:11,871
Speaker 0: He was born in March first 82.

662
00:42:11,871 --> 00:42:13,316
Speaker 1: Yeah thing is you want to be a real baby.

663
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:15,805
Speaker 1: March 30 look at the ages of f1 racers.

664
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,433
Speaker 0: early March 82.

665
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:24,630
Speaker 0: He's pretty much just our age and meanwhile He's like the king of this town and we're just two nerds across the river doing a podcast.

666
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he's basically the same age as us.

667
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:28,309
Speaker 0: We had just as much time.

668
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:32,688
Speaker 0: We could have done that and we beat it in his shoes right now, but we didn't.

669
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:35,460
Speaker 0: well I don't really like getting pucks flung it.

670
00:42:35,741 --> 00:42:37,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can kind of ice skate though.

671
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:37,970
Speaker 1: So you got that going.

672
00:42:38,211 --> 00:42:39,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could wobble around.

673
00:42:39,217 --> 00:42:40,324
Speaker 1: you guys keep walking.

674
00:42:40,404 --> 00:42:41,350
Speaker 0: I can't even skate backwards.

675
00:42:42,751 --> 00:42:43,837
Speaker 1: I've seen you wobble around though.

676
00:42:43,857 --> 00:42:44,299
Speaker 1: That's a start.

677
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,249
Speaker 1: That's better than a lot of people have to relearn it every time.

678
00:42:46,511 --> 00:42:58,154
Speaker 1: So think of this you need if you have a video game that you want competitive multiplayer to exist and it's a skill based game for a for a with a high skill cap for a period of time beyond the Very beginning.

679
00:42:58,174 --> 00:43:09,907
Speaker 1: when you first release your game you need to somehow one Maintain a deep and wide body of players And to have an accurate matchmaking system to ensure that those players continue to play.

680
00:43:09,927 --> 00:43:10,710
Speaker 0: and you need to air.

681
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:17,501
Speaker 0: If someone who wants to play the game, they say find me a game You cannot ever put them in a game where they are mismatched.

682
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:20,230
Speaker 0: You should just make them wait even though they are waiting.

683
00:43:20,352 --> 00:43:31,389
Speaker 0: But if you make them wait Like I do that's why you need the large body of players They'll give up and then you don't have the wide body of the wide body of players to decrease the wait time because there's a limit To how long someone's gonna wait.

684
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:45,874
Speaker 0: But you should still err on the side of waiting rather than playing a bad game because if someone has a bad experience they're gonna hate your game and blame it on your game, even though your game is perfect or really good like rocket league and The matchmaking is just awful,

685
00:43:46,175 --> 00:43:48,843
Speaker 1: but no matchmaking system will protect you from.

686
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:54,227
Speaker 1: if the player base is already stratified Yeah, and is small like NS You can always reset it.

687
00:43:54,691 --> 00:44:00,796
Speaker 1: the reason I couldn't play NS too much is that I didn't get in on the ground floor of playing the betas a lot because It didn't work that well.

688
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:09,334
Speaker 1: by the time the game was stable there was a set of people who were like unto gods compared to me and No one else.

689
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:10,598
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

690
00:44:10,618 --> 00:44:14,250
Speaker 1: So if I join any game, I was that shithead ruining it for the team.

691
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,597
Speaker 1: Yep, the mat even if the matchmaking was perfect.

692
00:44:16,818 --> 00:44:17,641
Speaker 1: It would have said rim.

693
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:18,965
Speaker 1: You're the cheese.

694
00:44:19,427 --> 00:44:20,410
Speaker 1: You're gonna stand alone.

695
00:44:20,634 --> 00:44:21,107
Speaker 0: That's right.

696
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,678
Speaker 0: So the one major prop that the.

697
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:24,681
Speaker 0: I want to just comment.

698
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:29,302
Speaker 0: one last thing which is how these games are doing it now Specifically rocket League and hearthstone.

699
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:30,470
Speaker 0: even the hearthstone is not skill base.

700
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:34,626
Speaker 0: I'll talk about Team Fortress 2 as well right is they're making this the ranking system.

701
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:36,933
Speaker 0: They are using The here.

702
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:38,798
Speaker 0: the problem with it's a rocket League.

703
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,745
Speaker 0: What is a grinding ranking system?

704
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:43,630
Speaker 0: It's not some right theoretically.

705
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:46,310
Speaker 0: Let's say I'm a natural at rocket League.

706
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,062
Speaker 0: I'm as good as kernove and I just I play rocket League a few times.

707
00:44:50,102 --> 00:44:52,370
Speaker 0: I learn it and then I'm just God, right?

708
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:59,690
Speaker 0: It's gonna take a long time for my rank to go all the way up to where it belongs.

709
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:10,789
Speaker 0: Well, cuz our grinding ranks because every time my team wins I get a few points based on you know They adjust it a little bit based on how good my opponents are how good I you know and things like that.

710
00:45:11,311 --> 00:45:23,150
Speaker 0: But if my team loses even though I may have displayed my godly skills and scored five goals Maybe my teammates own gold six times I'm gonna lose points, even though I displayed my godly skills in that game.

711
00:45:23,792 --> 00:45:24,273
Speaker 0: So it's gonna.

712
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:34,842
Speaker 0: I just had to keep playing tons and tons of fucking games before the game has recognized me at the true You know skill level and pair me up against players.

713
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,270
Speaker 0: I should be playing against who are also godlike.

714
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:38,457
Speaker 0: Sailing hearthstone.

715
00:45:38,478 --> 00:45:40,310
Speaker 0: It's like my brother is really good at hearthstone.

716
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:44,350
Speaker 0: He plays it way too much, but he didn't get to legendary until like last month.

717
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,889
Speaker 0: He was so proud, but it's like I could get to legendary too.

718
00:45:47,492 --> 00:45:50,682
Speaker 0: You know what, you know what changes my rank from season to season.

719
00:45:50,722 --> 00:45:53,050
Speaker 0: hearthstone whether or not you play how much I play.

720
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:54,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I play a lot of fucking hearthstone.

721
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:56,710
Speaker 0: I can get up to like single-digit ranks.

722
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:57,192
Speaker 0: I played it.

723
00:45:57,292 --> 00:46:09,584
Speaker 0: I'm not like rank eight or nine now, but if I don't play a lot then it's like no I should be able to play like five games of hearthstone and after trouncing five noobs It should shoot me the fuck up to like rank five where I usually.

724
00:46:09,604 --> 00:46:10,890
Speaker 0: you know where I kind of belong, right?

725
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:14,241
Speaker 0: You know, but because the system is based on grinding.

726
00:46:14,261 --> 00:46:15,184
Speaker 0: It's like it's.

727
00:46:15,324 --> 00:46:16,930
Speaker 0: you know, sometimes I randomly lose.

728
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:25,110
Speaker 1: Grinding is because a lot of people They need to feel a sense of progress even if they are not actually progressing like in counter-strike.

729
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,229
Speaker 1: I only progress through the ranks if I do well.

730
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:30,830
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I do not progress through the ranks.

731
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:36,390
Speaker 1: Yeah But a lot of games will grind up whatever indicator it gives you of how good you are.

732
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:40,124
Speaker 1: So you get a little bit of reward every time you play on rocket league.

733
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:41,670
Speaker 0: They actually have two separate measures.

734
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:46,824
Speaker 1: Yeah Trying to give the people who don't understand these things like you can mostly don't.

735
00:46:46,904 --> 00:46:50,169
Speaker 0: most people don't even play the ranked mode Which is why it's hard to find matches.

736
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:54,010
Speaker 0: But in the ranked mode your rank goes up and down as you win and lose, right?

737
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,250
Speaker 0: Which is bullshit, but it should be based on your individuals.

738
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,329
Speaker 0: We talked about that already.

739
00:46:57,631 --> 00:47:03,975
Speaker 0: But there's another thing that goes up no matter what but it goes up more if you score more and goes up more if you Do better but only goes up.

740
00:47:04,276 --> 00:47:17,604
Speaker 0: and that's sort of like your experience and you unlock like skins and all that kind of bullshit And your label changes from like pro to veteran to expert to you know And it's like that only goes up and like you're basically grinding that no matter what it's like.

741
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,330
Speaker 0: get rid of the fucking grinding bullshit.

742
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:21,489
Speaker 1: Just figure out my true skill level.

743
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:27,549
Speaker 1: But people want that grinding because someone who is not getting better at a game And someone who is not a person who is who you know.

744
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:35,650
Speaker 0: It's possible to like a skill based game like rocket league because it's way fun But not be the kind of person who cares about ranks and skills and improving.

745
00:47:36,173 --> 00:47:39,410
Speaker 1: Here's my counterpoint, but it assumes that people are making poor decisions.

746
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:40,540
Speaker 1: There's a lot of people should.

747
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:47,050
Speaker 1: they shouldn't be playing that game But you really need them to be playing or you'll have even fewer players and more gas.

748
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,790
Speaker 0: But if you just make their skill if you make their thing constantly go down because they suck at all quit.

749
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:55,430
Speaker 1: They'll quit because those people want to see their rank going up.

750
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:55,751
Speaker 1: They want.

751
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,199
Speaker 1: it's like the people who play an RPG.

752
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,730
Speaker 1: They want to see the number go up because they've played longer.

753
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:12,189
Speaker 1: That's why MMORPG players get so fucking mad when someone buys Levels or buys gold because they feel like they got cheated because they ground that shit out, right?

754
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:24,110
Speaker 1: grinding's got to go but you at the same time the psychologically people there are people who will not play your game unless you give them a reward for grinding because people you know They just want they should just play a different game.

755
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:27,830
Speaker 0: You know there needs to be games for serious people and games for not serious people.

756
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,275
Speaker 0: So here's my.

757
00:48:28,356 --> 00:48:29,225
Speaker 0: I have a crazy idea.

758
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,032
Speaker 0: All right I'm not.

759
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:31,299
Speaker 0: did I say this on the show before?

760
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,070
Speaker 1: maybe you might have said it in a panel.

761
00:48:33,332 --> 00:48:35,850
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't think I said it in a panel because it's too crazy.

762
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:42,339
Speaker 0: So you should have a game with serious mode and in serious mode You have to make some sort of deposit.

763
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,625
Speaker 1: because oh that idea.

764
00:48:43,645 --> 00:48:44,790
Speaker 0: did I tell this idea on the show?

765
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,570
Speaker 1: I don't think so and you've said in the forum a bunch of times, right?

766
00:48:48,871 --> 00:48:51,444
Speaker 0: And I definitely said it online a bunch because people are really mad about it.

767
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:52,550
Speaker 0: They're so mad.

768
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,514
Speaker 0: I don't know why they're so mad.

769
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:57,110
Speaker 0: so you to make some sort of deposit because you agreed to serious mode, right?

770
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,999
Speaker 0: You're serious enough that you're gonna put money down.

771
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:00,044
Speaker 0: We're not gonna keep.

772
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,270
Speaker 0: we're not gonna keep your money.

773
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:02,930
Speaker 0: We're not gonna spend the money's in escrow.

774
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,155
Speaker 0: It's a deposited money.

775
00:49:04,215 --> 00:49:06,344
Speaker 0: does guarantee that you're in serious mode.

776
00:49:06,364 --> 00:49:07,710
Speaker 1: like the game cost a hundred bucks.

777
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,270
Speaker 1: 50 bucks was like you bought the game and 50 bucks is sitting in s right.

778
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,062
Speaker 0: You don't have to play serious mode if you don't want to.

779
00:49:13,102 --> 00:49:14,310
Speaker 0: it's entirely optional, right?

780
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:19,304
Speaker 0: We only want serious people in serious mode serious people who are serious enough to put a deposit down.

781
00:49:19,866 --> 00:49:21,833
Speaker 0: once you're in serious mode Right.

782
00:49:21,873 --> 00:49:25,370
Speaker 0: We're only gonna let you play with people who are also in serious mode because you're all super serious.

783
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:30,890
Speaker 1: You're only playing against super pros who care a lot meaning the people who care enough to put money down in serious mode.

784
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:33,258
Speaker 0: So now matchmaking should be.

785
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:36,470
Speaker 0: you know already we've separated people who are serious enough, right?

786
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:38,059
Speaker 0: And you can always withdraw from serious mode.

787
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,225
Speaker 0: if you want, you know, we can take.

788
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:41,716
Speaker 0: give your money back Once you're in serious mode.

789
00:49:42,057 --> 00:49:43,482
Speaker 0: shit is serious, right?

790
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:48,137
Speaker 0: if you like, you know a bad sportsmanship We're just gonna penalize you in money.

791
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:50,104
Speaker 0: We're gonna take your fucking money, right?

792
00:49:50,305 --> 00:49:54,170
Speaker 0: It's like oh you cursed it that dude Five Scott five hundred dollar fine.

793
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,812
Speaker 0: Fuck yourself.

794
00:49:54,913 --> 00:50:05,790
Speaker 1: counter-strike does already have that with the cooldowns and that if you were on sportsmen like in Ranked games and people rat you out then basically you get a cooldown where you can't play for 30 minutes.

795
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:10,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, if you're not good enough if you do it again, it's like two weeks.

796
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:14,015
Speaker 1: if you do it again It's like a month like you Know.

797
00:50:14,035 --> 00:50:15,139
Speaker 0: I want to take your fucking money.

798
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:16,644
Speaker 1: why though that's not the people?

799
00:50:16,684 --> 00:50:18,570
Speaker 1: being shitty to each other is not the problem.

800
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:19,355
Speaker 0: It is a problem.

801
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,025
Speaker 0: and now it is not the problem, but there are.

802
00:50:21,045 --> 00:50:23,838
Speaker 0: there are other things I'm gonna take your money for for example.

803
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,706
Speaker 0: What if you just quit a game?

804
00:50:25,726 --> 00:50:26,389
Speaker 0: you rage quit?

805
00:50:26,529 --> 00:50:29,141
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm gonna take your fucking money because you rage quit.

806
00:50:29,302 --> 00:50:31,130
Speaker 0: but you know ruining serious mode.

807
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:33,389
Speaker 1: None of these things fix the matchmaking brah.

808
00:50:33,671 --> 00:50:45,090
Speaker 0: They can fix the matchmaking problem because by punishing people with fines for all these transgressions You're basically guaranteeing that people are gonna come play the game seriously.

809
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:54,152
Speaker 0: So we can assume all these things that we Basically can make a good ranking system even better because we have all these assumptions that are now truths Right.

810
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:58,790
Speaker 0: people aren't gonna be scoring own goals on purpose to fuck up our ranking system.

811
00:50:59,192 --> 00:51:02,070
Speaker 0: People aren't gonna be rage quitting to fuck up our ranking system.

812
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,175
Speaker 0: Everyone's actually trying to.

813
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:08,110
Speaker 0: things are fucking up the rankings every but I mean they're not fucking up the ranking systems.

814
00:51:08,272 --> 00:51:09,426
Speaker 0: The ranking system is garbage.

815
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:09,690
Speaker 0: to begin.

816
00:51:10,454 --> 00:51:13,730
Speaker 0: It will make our good ranking system even better.

817
00:51:13,931 --> 00:51:19,390
Speaker 1: I'm not having to account for even those things among the like 15 people who are in the series.

818
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:19,813
Speaker 0: It's good.

819
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:21,042
Speaker 0: If your game is really good.

820
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:22,150
Speaker 0: Hopefully you'd have a lot of God.

821
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:22,913
Speaker 1: I would not.

822
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:25,345
Speaker 1: I would not put money down in rocket league serious mode.

823
00:51:25,526 --> 00:51:28,190
Speaker 0: if that you're not serious I mean that you're not seriously enough for that.

824
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:33,844
Speaker 1: No I want to be serious at the game But I would not trust that there'd be enough people who put money now if it'd be worth it.

825
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,070
Speaker 1: and the non serious mode already Has a terrible matchmaking system.

826
00:51:38,014 --> 00:51:40,054
Speaker 0: I guess the thing is you don't really have a game That's like.

827
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,030
Speaker 0: I guess that's your game for all time.

828
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:46,209
Speaker 0: But like if there was a serious mode online netrunner with a good user interface, I'd be serious mode.

829
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:47,980
Speaker 1: Well counter-strike is kind of that.

830
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,570
Speaker 0: would you pay for counter-strike serious mode?

831
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,740
Speaker 1: No, cuz kids serious mode already exists and works great and doesn't cost money.

832
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,763
Speaker 0: It's okay.

833
00:51:53,783 --> 00:51:54,466
Speaker 1: What's wrong with it?

834
00:51:55,048 --> 00:51:56,112
Speaker 0: It's not perfect What's?

835
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:56,554
Speaker 1: no?

836
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:58,042
Speaker 1: what is not perfect about it?

837
00:51:58,082 --> 00:51:59,329
Speaker 1: that your system fixes?

838
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:06,690
Speaker 0: That people just be shitty come back and be shitty again, no one does that though you'll be rage-quitting.

839
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:08,095
Speaker 1: no, people don't rage.

840
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:08,877
Speaker 1: quit serious games.

841
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,406
Speaker 1: when they do they get punished and actually it's a pretty bad punishment.

842
00:52:11,707 --> 00:52:15,283
Speaker 1: and if and the only Way to get around those punishments is to pay for counter-strike again.

843
00:52:15,323 --> 00:52:16,790
Speaker 1: They get penalized monetarily.

844
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:20,360
Speaker 0: I thought you said that they don't get penalized monetarily up.

845
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they keep fucking up, they got to buy a new steam account.

846
00:52:23,912 --> 00:52:25,096
Speaker 0: Oh, okay by counter-strike.

847
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:26,561
Speaker 0: That's the same as what I was saying.

848
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's already there, but that is not the problem.

849
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:30,495
Speaker 0: I think you said you just had to get cool off.

850
00:52:30,595 --> 00:52:32,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cool offs keep escalating.

851
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:35,270
Speaker 1: It's not it escalates and escalates.

852
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:44,190
Speaker 1: But the problem with the matchmaking there is just that There's a top tier of super pro people and a bottom tier of terrible people and a big gulf between them.

853
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:49,770
Speaker 1: Your system doesn't fix the fundamental problems that are affecting most actual games in the real world.

854
00:52:50,313 --> 00:52:53,750
Speaker 1: You're solving the last 1% problem obviously in serious mode.

855
00:52:53,770 --> 00:53:01,153
Speaker 0: You're only gonna be playing against people, you know Really close to your skill level and you're willing to wait now because only to all of them limited number of people bother to put Money down.

856
00:53:01,937 --> 00:53:06,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people who are so serious that you want to play with I'm a noob, but I want to be serious.

857
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:07,770
Speaker 0: Well, there's something else to consider right?

858
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:13,810
Speaker 0: Is that depending on the game like take for example, you know, like especially a board game like Puerto Rico, right?

859
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:14,352
Speaker 0: It's like.

860
00:53:14,372 --> 00:53:16,644
Speaker 0: I guess there's someone out there who's even better at Puerto Rico than us.

861
00:53:16,685 --> 00:53:17,650
Speaker 0: We probably can't beat them.

862
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:19,131
Speaker 1: We haven't played in a long time Like.

863
00:53:19,211 --> 00:53:21,720
Speaker 1: I don't remember the full sequence of my like there.

864
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,502
Speaker 0: maybe there.

865
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:24,950
Speaker 0: maybe let's say you got five board gamers, right?

866
00:53:25,331 --> 00:53:30,770
Speaker 0: And there's you know, we're you know that and they're all at five different skill levels with definite gulfs between them.

867
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:35,065
Speaker 1: But if the five of us play Puerto Rico five times by the end everyone's near the top tier.

868
00:53:35,085 --> 00:53:44,682
Speaker 0: well, maybe but Even in that first game there's a huge gap between let's say who's like someone we know who's like can play board games But isn't godlike?

869
00:53:45,492 --> 00:53:48,130
Speaker 1: Alright, and then I can imagine that person, right?

870
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:55,539
Speaker 0: Okay, and then I'm like the third and then the fifth is some like genius person who's like, you know, amazing You're just gonna win no matter what right?

871
00:53:56,042 --> 00:53:57,330
Speaker 0: and we all play Puerto Rico together.

872
00:53:57,611 --> 00:54:09,489
Speaker 0: Well, even though our skill disparities are so big and it's a skill game And that person in rank one is gonna win that will still be an enjoyable time Right because we're all serious.

873
00:54:09,771 --> 00:54:13,450
Speaker 0: See you go to a netrunner tournament and you're gonna meet up with someone.

874
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,010
Speaker 1: It's just got way better than you when I hear series and they're serious.

875
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:20,330
Speaker 1: But when I play rocket League, I'm in a lot of games where everyone's serious.

876
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:25,090
Speaker 1: It's just the skill gaps are so wide that the game is terrible.

877
00:54:25,694 --> 00:54:28,270
Speaker 0: The skill disparity is way bigger than it is in a board game.

878
00:54:28,436 --> 00:54:34,561
Speaker 1: Yeah But I'm saying if the skill disparity were wider in a board game like that There are board games like glory to Rome.

879
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:37,072
Speaker 0: age of steam is the one you want to talk Rome.

880
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:44,196
Speaker 1: if I played glory to Rome so much that if I play it with someone who like it's their first time playing It is not fun.

881
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:45,683
Speaker 0: They don't get to do anything.

882
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:47,210
Speaker 0: They don't get to the I mean age of steam.

883
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:49,081
Speaker 0: It's just like I eliminated it in turn two or three.

884
00:54:49,241 --> 00:54:50,730
Speaker 1: I got eliminated not too long after you.

885
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:51,499
Speaker 1: I remember that game.

886
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:52,409
Speaker 0: I think it was the same turn.

887
00:54:52,571 --> 00:55:04,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I made it one more turn because I had like a dollar left, okay Yeah, this is one of those things where if you have a game You this meta thing that's like out.

888
00:55:04,482 --> 00:55:07,750
Speaker 0: It's like you made the perfect game But then you ruined it because you messed up this meta.

889
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:12,190
Speaker 1: Well, I think that there's a much higher level of discussion needs to be had here.

890
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:20,683
Speaker 1: Look at the game like Team Fortress 2 which despite only having like 40,000 people playing it Like doesn't have this problem because the skill disparity is lower.

891
00:55:20,703 --> 00:55:27,870
Speaker 1: because because it's a skill based game Does the game itself does not reward individual skill much beyond a pretty low bar?

892
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:31,450
Speaker 1: So the things that rewards are teamwork.

893
00:55:31,952 --> 00:55:43,050
Speaker 1: Imagine the Team Fortress 2 version of rocket League would be a game Where no matter how good you are at aerials if the other team has someone everyone has auto aim on their car.

894
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,830
Speaker 0: So if you go towards the ball, you're gonna hit it.

895
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,523
Speaker 0: You're going to hit it towards the net no matter what.

896
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:57,550
Speaker 1: so it's like in hockey if Choosing what line and who to pass to mattered but everyone had the same skill at passing.

897
00:55:57,991 --> 00:56:10,290
Speaker 1: The Wayne Gretzky can't pass better than the can't shoot harder or more accurately Yeah Or he can't shoot much harder like he's 2% more likely to score with a percent the percentage of goals that go in when you shoot or equal.

898
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:15,750
Speaker 0: Yeah goalies are all you know Like a relatively equal percentage of shots.

899
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:26,130
Speaker 1: So for a team game that is a way to address the problem by pulling down the individual skill But ensuring that that is not replaced by grinding or nothing.

900
00:56:26,652 --> 00:56:29,506
Speaker 1: It has to be replaced by team coordination matters.

901
00:56:29,526 --> 00:56:35,300
Speaker 1: like in Team Fortress 2 If a bunch of rims and a bunch of Scots play against each other It would be a dead 50/50 match.

902
00:56:35,622 --> 00:56:40,490
Speaker 1: the skill would be do the rims Coordinate like when they attack better than the Scots.

903
00:56:41,172 --> 00:56:41,874
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.

904
00:56:41,914 --> 00:56:46,247
Speaker 1: do the rims like switch classes at the right time and there's this balance going on.

905
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,850
Speaker 1: so That is a way to get around this problem.

906
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,017
Speaker 1: But it becomes a very different game.

907
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:56,572
Speaker 1: team for just it was a very different game from counter-strike as a result of mega skill Gaze game.

908
00:56:56,652 --> 00:57:02,250
Speaker 0: get the matchmaking right, you know, the Microsoft team score talked about before right is a pretty good system.

909
00:57:02,491 --> 00:57:03,253
Speaker 0: It's not perfect.

910
00:57:03,474 --> 00:57:07,807
Speaker 0: Right, but there are many systems out there for doing better, you know.

911
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:13,832
Speaker 0: analysis of Individual players skill team-based or not, right Sports.

912
00:57:13,892 --> 00:57:15,579
Speaker 0: I already talked about advanced analytics.

913
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:18,430
Speaker 0: We can determine how good someone is even if they're on the losing team.

914
00:57:18,532 --> 00:57:23,630
Speaker 0: Yep And then try to pair people up as much as you can with people of equal skill level.

915
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,230
Speaker 1: The second problem of the depth of players is almost an afterthought.

916
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:32,969
Speaker 1: You have to get the matchmaking as good as it can possibly be right right one like Rocket League You know.

917
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:37,325
Speaker 0: It's like they can do a lot better than they're doing even without getting more players.

918
00:57:37,345 --> 00:57:47,007
Speaker 0: if they don't do better Then it's making me not want to play the game even though I really like the game because I can't get a good game on because I don't get matched up with.

919
00:57:47,128 --> 00:57:59,076
Speaker 1: but it's easy to Not see the problem because if you already got past that Gulf like if you're good enough at counter-strike or good enough at Rocket League then you find a great game every time you play or No, you don't cuz it's really.

920
00:57:59,177 --> 00:58:01,106
Speaker 0: I get even games where I beat up everyone.

921
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:01,870
Speaker 0: It's kind of boring.

922
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,179
Speaker 0: I want to play against an evil match tight game.

923
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:04,460
Speaker 1: He's got.

924
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:10,623
Speaker 1: the other thing is those people form a team Mmm, if you're in that tier like I'm not good enough for that.

925
00:58:10,763 --> 00:58:12,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're not past the level.

926
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:17,130
Speaker 1: I'm saying if you get past that bar, if you're over the waterfall, you're not falling back down the waterfall.

927
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:19,095
Speaker 1: There's like a paradise of you.

928
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:27,530
Speaker 1: get your three friends and you play the perfect game all the time with other teams that are similarly Serious, no one wants to organize Yeah.

929
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:38,060
Speaker 1: but the only way to avoid that problem is either to make your blue to flatten the playing field somehow Team Fortress 2 style or To have the best possible matchmaking from day one

930
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:38,904
Speaker 0: and then

931
00:58:39,024 --> 00:58:39,265
Speaker 1: hope

932
00:58:39,285 --> 00:58:42,899
Speaker 0: you can always reset your Matchmaking and start a new with a perfect system.

933
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,875
Speaker 1: if you messed it up to begin to a degree unless you lost players It won't come back sure.

934
00:58:46,895 --> 00:58:50,510
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, you may have lost players who won't come back those critical first few weeks.

935
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,723
Speaker 0: You've got to make it so that but you can still as long as you have people playing.

936
00:58:53,763 --> 00:59:04,630
Speaker 1: you can always just reset all Your ranking system and install a new one and do things the right way as long as a pro can join and in a reasonable Amount of time be matched pretty much only with pros.

937
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:15,186
Speaker 1: Yeah And a complete noob can join and always have games with noobs and someone who's old like us Can join and at least have a reasonable game 80% of the time.

938
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:20,310
Speaker 1: Right, that's your best shot at keeping the depth of play enough to keep your game going.

939
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:28,784
Speaker 0: Also, even if you don't have enough players if your ranking systems be good enough You'll get more players playing more and that will fill it up right.

940
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:32,479
Speaker 0: if your ranking system is bad You're only gonna make it worse.

941
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:36,951
Speaker 0: It's a self-fulfilling or self, you know Helping kind of thing.

942
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:37,332
Speaker 1: Yep.

943
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:45,220
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

944
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,967
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening.

945
00:59:47,007 --> 00:59:50,100
Speaker 1: music can't leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

946
00:59:50,341 --> 00:59:52,308
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row.

947
00:59:52,348 --> 00:59:55,360
Speaker 0: crew calm for show notes discussion news and more.

948
00:59:55,620 --> 01:00:03,040
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one but four different shows sci-tech Mondays gaming Tuesdays and my comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

949
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:06,556
Speaker 0: Geek nights is distributed under a Creative Commons attribution 3.0 license.

950
01:00:07,822 --> 01:00:10,914
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

951
01:00:11,115 --> 01:00:41,231
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows It's actually recorded at night and the patrons this week are And it's kind of hard to read all these as I've said before.

952
01:00:41,332 --> 01:00:47,204
Speaker 1: so once again if I'm pronouncing your name wrong week after week Email me.

953
01:00:47,505 --> 01:00:48,849
Speaker 1: rim at front row crew.

954
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:54,660
Speaker 1: calm if you never guessed my email address that goes directly to me and I will not only fix it, but I will apologize.

955
01:00:55,705 --> 01:01:28,798
Speaker 1: but this week we have Rebecca Dunn Nicholas Brando James David White Christian Koontz Jess mechanical mind Renee from New Zealand Robert Lee Ryan Perrin drew up and Lander rare Laval Brian Cedroni Rochelle, Mantanona Finn Eric Silverald rim eats poop Edgar Mendez William Eisen rose Chris midkiff Chris Knox flame dark fire Samuel Cordery Daniel Redmond Chris Haddad Doug Snyder Shawn Klein Chris Reimer and Thomas Hahn.

956
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:36,900
Speaker 1: So yes, you know the front row crew a bunch of us are playing a sort of private civ5 game on the giant multiplayer robot.

957
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:38,665
Speaker 1: I highly recommend it.

958
01:01:38,906 --> 01:01:43,539
Speaker 1: Like I don't want to promote it or anything as an official like hey do this thing, but it's pretty legit.

959
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:49,119
Speaker 1: and Scott keeps trying to see what I'm doing on my turn.

960
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,060
Speaker 1: So I can't take my turn until he leaves after geek nights.

961
01:01:54,622 --> 01:02:00,780
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to think of a way to use the fact that he's trying to see this to trick him into doing something bad.

962
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:09,584
Speaker 1: But that might require me to craft a save file Where it looks like it's my turn in that game, but it's really a fake game I made.

963
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:11,638
Speaker 1: so I can put myself somewhere different.

964
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:26,120
Speaker 1: and If you have any ideas of how I should trick Scott With this because I'm gonna like up got to go to the bathroom before we do the main bit and he'll notice that civ5 Has got open in the background and I'm hoping you'll click on it and see what's going on in my civilization.

965
01:02:27,082 --> 01:02:29,833
Speaker 1: I really want to roll him in a critical moment.

966
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:34,445
Speaker 1: like 80 turns into this game In other patreon news.

967
01:02:34,946 --> 01:02:37,915
Speaker 1: I did start pre-production on geek nights presents utenna 14.

968
01:02:37,915 --> 01:02:44,486
Speaker 1: I Have been fighting off so many DMCA takedowns on those videos.

969
01:02:44,506 --> 01:02:50,582
Speaker 1: you have no idea but so far they're all still up and we are continuing with episode 14.

970
01:02:50,582 --> 01:02:57,190
Speaker 1: I'm doing pre-production now and it's all because of you you guys Donating money on our patreon.

971
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,396
Speaker 1: So really seriously.

972
01:02:58,436 --> 01:02:58,798
Speaker 1: Thank you.

973
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:13,280
Speaker 1: We can't keep doing the cool stuff like geek nights presents utenna without something other than just doing the show and The patreon is a big step if geek night's lieutenant goes well and that like documentary I was talking about doing also goes well.

974
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:25,599
Speaker 1: thinking about making maybe even drastic life changes that really push geek nights to a big level and If the patreon was not here, I would not have the confidence to go forward with that.

975
01:03:26,965 --> 01:03:32,290
Speaker 1: so now as always Your moment of literally the opposite of Zen.

976
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:36,180
Speaker 2: Hey, I read somewhere that mathematicians can turn a sphere inside out.

977
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:37,645
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.

978
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:38,929
Speaker 1: What's the big deal?

979
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:41,780
Speaker 2: Just poke a hole in it and pull it through?

980
01:03:42,563 --> 01:03:46,500
Speaker 2: Sure, but the point is to do it without making a hole, but then it seems impossible.

981
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:47,883
Speaker 2: You're right.

982
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:51,860
Speaker 2: You cannot do it with an ordinary sphere like a basketball.

983
01:03:53,303 --> 01:03:55,319
Speaker 2: You have to understand the rules of the game.

984
01:03:56,302 --> 01:04:05,095
Speaker 2: This sphere is made of an abstract elastic material that can stretch and bend and pass through itself.

985
01:04:06,283 --> 01:04:17,849
Speaker 2: but you cannot rip or puncture this material without destroying it and You cannot crease it or bend it sharply if the surface can pass through itself.

986
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:18,970
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

987
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:22,389
Speaker 2: Do you think allowing self intersections makes it easy?

988
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:23,732
Speaker 2: Try it.

989
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:26,448
Speaker 1: I'll push the two halves right through each other.

990
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:30,717
Speaker 2: Be careful.

991
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,968
Speaker 2: What about that ring around the equator?

992
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,029
Speaker 2: Remember you mustn't tear or crease it.

993
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:40,125
Speaker 1: Ah Let me try again.

994
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:42,498
Speaker 2: That's no good either.

995
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:48,365
