1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,149
Speaker 1: It's Thursday January 24th.

2
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:12,971
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,717
Speaker 1: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight desert bus.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,796
Speaker 0: Let's do this This weekend just couldn't come faster.

5
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:31,522
Speaker 0: I'm tired to put it lightly.

6
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:33,750
Speaker 1: I got like at work.

7
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:38,504
Speaker 1: I had some works to do right and some of the works were Works that I like to do and some were not.

8
00:00:38,565 --> 00:00:40,033
Speaker 1: and I've done all the works I like to do.

9
00:00:40,093 --> 00:00:44,777
Speaker 1: and now I'm just sitting there with these two pain in the ass works I don't want to do.

10
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,843
Speaker 1: they just suck.

11
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:46,487
Speaker 0: Well, don't do them.

12
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:46,829
Speaker 0: Just quit.

13
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:50,230
Speaker 1: I'm doing them incredibly slowly and mostly goofing off.

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:56,315
Speaker 1: The problem is there's not enough new stuff on the internet to keep me amused all day at work And it's getting pretty painful.

15
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,427
Speaker 0: You could get a job where you actually I don't know work.

16
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:00,230
Speaker 1: I work.

17
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:06,790
Speaker 1: I just do all the work so fast faster than they give it to me Because I'm so good at it.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:16,064
Speaker 1: And the only reason I haven't done all my work is because depending on the work They give me I either it's a it's a good work Which means I do it so fast like in a second like BAM.

19
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:28,390
Speaker 1: that was awesome, and it's fun And I think it's really satisfying, but it takes like a minute only because I'm awesome Not because it was actually take a minute or this other work That would take a minute if I wanted to do it, and I felt like doing it.

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,084
Speaker 1: But it doesn't because I'm a lazy slow ass and it's not pleasant.

21
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:40,321
Speaker 0: so I take my sweet ass time And see I was in the opposite situation at the hospital where the work was all trivial But I had to rely on other people who didn't know what they were doing.

22
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,558
Speaker 0: so as a result most of my time I just kind of twiddle my thumbs.

23
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:45,490
Speaker 0: would twiddle my thumbs meant sit on YouTube.

24
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now I have a job where I actually do work.

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,930
Speaker 0: the problem is because I'm it's like the higher level like you know You call a tech support place.

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,860
Speaker 0: There's like the level one guy level two guy like the levels going up The higher up you get like there's no more easy work.

27
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,610
Speaker 0: any job that is given to you is not going to be simple.

28
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if it could have been done easily or quickly someone else would have already done it.

29
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:14,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I spent most of the day at work today like you know programming something for myself, but then I finished it.

30
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,457
Speaker 1: I was like shit what I do now.

31
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:17,943
Speaker 0: I got some things you could program.

32
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:18,606
Speaker 1: What do you want?

33
00:02:18,846 --> 00:02:24,597
Speaker 0: I want a multiband dynamic range compander Written in lisp.

34
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:25,522
Speaker 1: that's not gonna happen.

35
00:02:25,723 --> 00:02:26,406
Speaker 0: That's what I need.

36
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:30,583
Speaker 0: well tough Yeah, I started to learn lisp, but I need some time.

37
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:35,986
Speaker 1: I guess to actually write these things I think it's really just whether doing something for myself or for someone else.

38
00:02:36,026 --> 00:02:43,602
Speaker 1: like if I want to do it BAM it's done, but if I don't want to do it Huh people like to do things they like to do and therefore they tend to do them.

39
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,866
Speaker 1: Oh gasps.

40
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:47,159
Speaker 0: Oh well We're tired.

41
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,268
Speaker 0: We'll see where the show goes.

42
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:54,050
Speaker 1: so Yeah, I don't have a lot of confidence for the show cuz mean it's also an incredibly slow news week and thing of the day.

43
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,619
Speaker 0: Hey, there was a new angry video game nerd.

44
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,783
Speaker 1: It was okay.

45
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:58,546
Speaker 0: It was pretty good.

46
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,630
Speaker 1: This is average work.

47
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:04,984
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's web comics coming out tomorrow and yesterday, but not today.

48

56
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,270

57
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:31,790

58
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,761
Speaker 1: So why the fuck not shrink ray?

Speaker 1: I'm gonna read this email and it's entirely.

64
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:48,559
Speaker 1: it's from vicious Smith Which I assume is vicious, but it's vic hu s.

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,044
Speaker 0: maybe he's a vic uis.

66
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,070
Speaker 1: I've seen him around on some forums.

67
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,701
Speaker 1: I think this is a longtime listener kind of guy doesn't?

68
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,810
Speaker 0: isn't he one of those Dave and Joel people do or something?

69
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,220
Speaker 1: He might be he might be.

70
00:03:58,341 --> 00:04:06,475
Speaker 1: anyway, let me read His emails short so I'm gonna read it in its entirety until I get to the the Just gonna read the whole thing.

71
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:06,716
Speaker 1: Okay.

72
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,310
Speaker 1: I'm a user of game fly and I've been angered with it lately.

73
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:15,550
Speaker 1: My original intention was to play a bunch of crap games for a few days then send them back to play more crap games.

74
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,935
Speaker 1: The problem is now.

75
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:20,649
Speaker 1: I want to play better games and preview them before I decide to purchase them now.

76
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:21,555
Speaker 1: Here are the problems.

77
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:28,230
Speaker 1: The queue is filled with a Allegedly good games that are so popular I'll have to wait months for them to be available.

78
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,850
Speaker 1: If I hold on to a game for more than a month or two I could have just bought it through eBay or some discount site.

79
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:38,904
Speaker 1: I enjoy RPGs and RPGs are more involved than an action or RPG.

80
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,330
Speaker 1: Okay Action RPG I guess.

81
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:43,916
Speaker 1: So you have.

82
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,530
Speaker 0: I haven't enjoyed an action RPG in a while.

83
00:04:46,992 --> 00:04:52,636
Speaker 1: So so have you guys used game fly and you think it's a waste of money to rent games 15 a month if you can Just wait for a good deal on games.

84
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:56,129
Speaker 0: Well, it sounds like well, I guess you can answer this since this is your bit.

85
00:04:56,551 --> 00:05:06,910
Speaker 1: I mean ideally right if the game fly was as good as Netflix was right and you're in a situation Where you have more time to play video games than you have video games to play.

86
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,826
Speaker 1: Gamefly seems like a good idea because you can buy the games that you know You're gonna play again and again and again forever.

87
00:05:13,453 --> 00:05:21,550
Speaker 1: I never want to get rid of and all those other games that are like Popular when they come out for a month or two and then they go away forever and no one ever thinks of them again.

88
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:25,766
Speaker 1: You can just rent those from the game fly and then send them back when you're done with them.

89
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:26,930
Speaker 1: or a lot of those games.

90
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,734
Speaker 1: Do you play them once?

91
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:28,799
Speaker 1: you never gonna play them again.

92
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:31,010
Speaker 1: get them from the game fly send them back, right?

93
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:37,430
Speaker 1: But I I was not aware, you know I knew game about game fly and all I knew was that it was the Netflix of video games.

94
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,800
Speaker 0: It's all that used to be before that way back.

95
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,426
Speaker 0: There was red octane.

96
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:42,551
Speaker 1: red octane I don't know.

97
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:44,137
Speaker 1: They still offer offer that service.

98
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,105
Speaker 1: think so because right now they're they're making.

99
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,407
Speaker 0: you know, guitar hero guitars Yeah, but back then I remember when I first got a ps1.

100
00:05:50,447 --> 00:05:54,059
Speaker 0: I paid $80 for it at Kmart and I then immediately.

101
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,076
Speaker 0: then I spent like 20 bucks on a six-pin mod chip and I don't think other Than one game to test.

102
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:05,641
Speaker 0: I never put a non Dance Dance Revolution game in there But you can't get real DDR in the u.s.

103
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:06,664
Speaker 0: Least back then you couldn't.

104
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:15,939
Speaker 0: there was USA makes which was possibly one of the worst contrivances ever brought up unto the world by man and I thought wait a minute.

105
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,310
Speaker 0: All right, how am I gonna get these games?

106
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:26,482
Speaker 0: I tried to pirate them and I found that every ps1 pirated game was actually just either something horrible or some sort of virus Exe like ISO exe.

107
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:27,105
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

108
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:27,829
Speaker 0: I wonder what that is.

109
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:35,119
Speaker 0: yep, but then I saw the red octane had import games and Regular games and you could rent them much like Netflix.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,190
Speaker 0: So I said, alright, I signed up for a one-month free trial.

111
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:42,090
Speaker 0: I filled my queue with every DDR game that had ever been released in Japan.

112
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,466
Speaker 0: When they came I immediately copied them and then sent them back.

113
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,537
Speaker 0: two weeks later I canceled the account.

114
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,450
Speaker 0: and I know at every game of DDR ever.

115
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:59,470
Speaker 1: Yeah when I was in high school I had a friend who would go to Blockbuster copy the ps1 games of the CD burner then bring it back to Blockbuster essentially Effectively buying video games for $3 because he also had the mod chip.

116
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,310
Speaker 1: But I don't think you can copy the ps3 in the Xbox games and the Wii game so easily.

117
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,042
Speaker 0: No, you can't copy ps1 games so easily.

118
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:08,890
Speaker 0: a lot a lot of CDs just wouldn't work.

119
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,873
Speaker 0: And yeah, if you're one of those fools who bought a four-pin mod ship or one of those external mod chips half the time It didn't work.

120
00:07:14,953 --> 00:07:22,926
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, so I was unaware that there was actually a problem with This game fly service where if a game is popular, you can't get it right away.

121
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:23,930
Speaker 1: That is bullshit.

122
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:30,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean imagine if on Netflix if you put a movie in your queue 99.9% of the time that movies coming next.

123
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,950
Speaker 1: there's never a situation where the movie is so popular.

124
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:34,020
Speaker 1: You have to wait does any?

125
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,110
Speaker 1: we never had that problem.

126
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:37,638
Speaker 0: When was the last time we watched a Netflix?

127
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,785
Speaker 1: I know but I mean even when we were super Netflix.

128
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:50,026
Speaker 0: now even when before we Podcasted when we were both out of college had plenty of money nothing to do with ourselves We watched every Netflix the day it came and sent it back.

129
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:57,680
Speaker 1: sometimes that day Yeah, and we never had a problem, you know waiting in a queue for something wait, and he says so Wait a minute.

130
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,414
Speaker 0: if we quit doing geek nights We can do stuff.

131
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:02,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can.

132
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,823
Speaker 0: we can play video games and watch movies.

133
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,167
Speaker 0: Yeah, then fuck this.

134
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:12,014
Speaker 1: Okay, but Yeah, if they're not gonna send you the games you want right away That seems like a pretty.

135
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,850
Speaker 1: you know, it's not a. the service isn't living up to its usefulness.

136
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:16,673
Speaker 1: So what's the point?

137
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,660
Speaker 0: I think there's a simpler answer to his question.

138
00:08:19,182 --> 00:08:21,470
Speaker 0: He basically said well, I wanted to use product day.

139
00:08:21,571 --> 00:08:28,850
Speaker 0: So I bought product day and I wanted to do B C and D But now I wanted to do E and it turns out it doesn't do E. should I stop paying for it?

140
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,753
Speaker 0: And the answer is yes.

141
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:30,295
Speaker 0: Yes.

142
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:31,098
Speaker 1: It's pretty simple.

143
00:08:31,138 --> 00:08:32,061
Speaker 0: You answered your own question.

144
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:34,590
Speaker 0: You said well, it doesn't do what I wanted to do.

145
00:08:34,951 --> 00:08:35,854
Speaker 0: Should I still pay?

146
00:08:35,874 --> 00:08:38,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess on paper.

147
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:39,346
Speaker 1: It's a good idea.

148
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:49,916
Speaker 1: if yours communism Yeah, if you're the kind of person who needs to play a lot more video games than you are able to buy I think Scott Johnson has gamefly does he and you want to?

149
00:08:49,996 --> 00:09:00,569
Speaker 1: you want to play more games than you can afford to buy and you don't have enough of them and You want to play a lot of games that you don't want to keep and you know You are you're willing to play crappier games then I guess it's a good idea.

150
00:09:01,491 --> 00:09:07,870
Speaker 1: Other than that, I guess it's you know, I guess the reality is it doesn't even do that and I'll admit I'll play.

151
00:09:08,152 --> 00:09:11,090
Speaker 0: Especially back when I had free time I would often play a subpar game.

152
00:09:11,332 --> 00:09:13,189
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you you get some enjoyment.

153
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:28,554
Speaker 0: in fact if you have free time a lot of times a really bad game is almost fun in this cathartic kind of the quality of media you are willing to I guess consume goes down as Your free time increases.

154
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:33,910
Speaker 1: the more free time you have the more willing you are to watch crappier things play crappier games and read.

155
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:40,750
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of it's just that when you have more free time You're more willing to invest time on a risk that something may or may not be good.

156
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:44,104
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean there are games that seem good and are good.

157
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,736
Speaker 0: But after you play them for an hour They're not so fun anymore.

158
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:51,437
Speaker 0: or games that would be good if you played them for four hours But they're not fun for an hour.

159
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's are you willing to give up that hour?

160
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:55,130
Speaker 0: The answer is usually no nowadays.

161
00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,952
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to be more discerning when you have less free time and yet you can afford to be less discerning when you have More free time.

162
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,584
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, speaking of free time and things that are worthwhile.

163
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,490
Speaker 0: I have a geek bite.

164
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:07,273
Speaker 1: No, no.

165
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:09,421
Speaker 1: now, I guess there's no news today for real.

166
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:11,709
Speaker 0: Well, there's news and I could talk about.

167
00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:16,790
Speaker 0: I'm Legally barred from talking about the one thing I do find interesting and want to talk about.

168
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,248
Speaker 1: Well, you could have just told me to talk about it.

169
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what do you have to say other than whoa, how do you do that?

170
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:25,340
Speaker 0: Oh Cuz that was the conversation we had a little while ago.

171
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,504
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what you wanted to talk.

172
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:26,806
Speaker 1: Yeah.

173
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:27,328
Speaker 1: Okay.

174
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:27,749
Speaker 0: What do you do?

175
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,079
Speaker 0: Oh, how do you do it?

176
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:39,390
Speaker 0: Oh, wow hmm, but the Scott for a long time has been meaning to read a Series of books the first of which is called Hyperion by an author named Dan Simmons.

177
00:10:39,731 --> 00:10:45,052
Speaker 0: Dan Simmons is an awesome author and Scott never got around to this Independently.

178
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:46,197
Speaker 1: we got around to a lot of things.

179
00:10:46,317 --> 00:10:49,110
Speaker 0: independently of Alex trying to convince Scott to read Hyperion.

180
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,757
Speaker 0: I have been trying to convince.

181
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:51,942
Speaker 1: he wasn't trying to convince me.

182
00:10:51,962 --> 00:10:53,830
Speaker 1: I actually knew about the books from somewhere.

183
00:10:54,213 --> 00:10:56,247
Speaker 1: I asked him if he knew about them and he had them all.

184
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:04,552
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I've been trying to tell Scott to read this other book called the terror and I remember when it dawned on Scott not Too long ago.

185
00:11:04,593 --> 00:11:06,219
Speaker 1: I get whenever anyone says terror.

186
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,303
Speaker 1: I can't think.

187
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:10,116
Speaker 1: I can't help but think about the stupid magic card Really?

188
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,132
Speaker 0: I think about Cthulhu usually also There was.

189
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:17,640
Speaker 1: was it an anime where it was like that terror?

190
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:19,225
Speaker 1: Oh gassaraki.

191
00:11:19,405 --> 00:11:19,927
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:20,870
Speaker 0: No, that's right.

193
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,513
Speaker 0: We watched that show.

194
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,321
Speaker 1: tell we watched it dubbed on VHS.

195
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:25,209
Speaker 1: I own all the dubbed VHS's.

196
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:35,586
Speaker 0: Wow this anyway, so it dawned upon Scott that the terror is written by the same person.

197
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,664
Speaker 0: So very briefly the terror is a is a fictional book about the.

198
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,770
Speaker 0: you know a novel if you will.

199
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:52,430
Speaker 0: Well, well, I'll get to that because it is fiction But at the same time it edges very very very close to nonfiction.

200
00:11:53,432 --> 00:12:02,207
Speaker 0: You see it's about an expedition that was taken in the late or middle middling 1800s To find the Northwest Passage in the Arctic.

201
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,844
Speaker 0: now This is a time when ships were mostly made out of wood and steam.

202
00:12:05,884 --> 00:12:07,290
Speaker 0: power was laughable.

203
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:16,839
Speaker 0: So a bunch of guys got into two ships the HMS Erebus and the HMS terror and they go on Into the Northwest Passage.

204
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,389
Speaker 1: What a great way to name your boat that's gonna go into the North Pole.

205
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:22,356
Speaker 0: now I'm reading this book and I didn't.

206
00:12:22,637 --> 00:12:23,359
Speaker 0: I just read it.

207
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,570
Speaker 0: I didn't do any research any backstory and oh, this book's awesome.

208
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,770
Speaker 0: It's about some monster and it's kind of eerie and good and historical fiction.

209
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:37,181
Speaker 0: But I got about three-quarters of the way through and I'm feeling okay about this book even though it's really tragic and really sad and really it.

210
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:46,038
Speaker 0: it goes into the Procedural details of dealing with scurvy when you're alone in the Arctic and dying of frostbite You mean losing eye teeth and such.

211
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,575
Speaker 0: yeah vomiting and diarrhea and blood all that Scurvy sucks.

212
00:12:51,097 --> 00:12:52,181
Speaker 1: don't get scurvy.

213
00:12:52,241 --> 00:13:00,293
Speaker 0: Even if you think you're it's gonna really help your pirate costume I think some guy at NYU got scurvy just because he didn't eat oranges For long enough.

214
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:01,096
Speaker 1: How could you?

215
00:13:01,518 --> 00:13:05,190
Speaker 1: almost everything has vitamin C even bread some bread, you know.

216
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,110
Speaker 0: I'm surprised that guy Greg's old roommate who did nothing but play Asheron's call never got scurvy.

217
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:12,929
Speaker 1: Well, because he'd always go to Gracie's get a meal a decent meal and bring it back.

218
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:22,695
Speaker 1: I mean as you know Gracie's wasn't the greatest food But it wasn't bad as bad as you know, you like to make fun of it for being and you know It's got to make it all the way to Gracie's.

219
00:13:22,715 --> 00:13:23,577
Speaker 1: it was nutritional.

220
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:26,425
Speaker 0: So well barely I guess.

221
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:39,489
Speaker 0: there there is the the the commonly known thing at RIT that freshman will have a more voluminous output of Feces than they did in their previous life do almost entirely to the composition of the food and Gracie's.

222
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:39,830
Speaker 0: it's true.

223
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:47,727
Speaker 0: But I got most of the way through this book and I'm digging it even though a lot of people are dying horribly and it's a really bleak depressing scary book.

224
00:13:47,768 --> 00:14:00,460
Speaker 0: and then randomly, I look on Wikipedia and I discover that this book is actually very close to what actually happened to these people and it's based on historical documents According to Wikipedia.

225
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,507
Speaker 0: Well, no it actually is.

226
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:09,150
Speaker 0: this book is Extremely well researched bit of historical fiction and is probably the thing is so the fiction is just the monster.

227
00:14:09,758 --> 00:14:10,568
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

228
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:18,150
Speaker 0: Everything that happens to these people is very realistic and is very probably very close to what actually happened to this expedition.

229
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:23,590
Speaker 0: but There's a monster in the novel and you think alright the monster is obviously not real.

230
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,110
Speaker 0: Well, once you realize what actually happened to these people the monster kind of makes sense.

231
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,315
Speaker 0: Uh-huh in a realistic.

232
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:38,333
Speaker 1: so they went insane and they all believed it was a monster possibly something like sort of a group You know Delusion.

233
00:14:38,614 --> 00:14:46,577
Speaker 0: well possibly due to the fact that there's a good chance that everyone on this expedition was suffering by lead poisoning Due to poorly canned food.

234
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:48,623
Speaker 1: Oh in pride in lead cans.

235
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:50,590
Speaker 0: Yeah lead solder around the seal.

236
00:14:50,912 --> 00:15:07,147
Speaker 0: Oh, so awesome, but I don't want to get in a lot of details about this book but if you like a very gritty very realistic very procedural story about the shall we say Difficulties of exploring the Arctic in a wooden ship with lead monsters in the 1800s.

237
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:21,690
Speaker 0: And one thing you'll learn and this is this is definitely true British people exploring back then in the Arctic Didn't know shit about exploring in the Arctic and most of the problems they had were due to their own stupidity as you will learn.

238
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:27,529
Speaker 0: Well, of course, they didn't know know what it done it before No, but they didn't even think that you'll see when you read the book.

239
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:33,819
Speaker 0: They brought a lot of things with them that did not need to be brought with them and failed to bring things They did need to be brought.

240
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:45,478
Speaker 0: possibly also I'd like to note that if you're going to out monster extinguisher if you're going to outfit shark into the Arctic and You're finding someone to make your food bring Batman.

241
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,749
Speaker 1: I'd recommend Batman because that way he'll have always had the right tool at the right time.

242
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:54,568
Speaker 0: They would add some canned food and then a boat shark repellent.

243
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:56,686
Speaker 0: You know, there's no sharks up.

244
00:15:56,707 --> 00:16:00,282
Speaker 1: there Should be but polar bear repellent.

245
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:01,929
Speaker 0: don't go with the lowest bidder.

246
00:16:03,431 --> 00:16:20,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, especially for the boat, but the the terror by Dan Simmons is a fantastic novel though It is not for the squeamish of stomach or light of heart things of the day.

247
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:23,735
Speaker 0: It's really rare that I read a new webcomic.

248
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,358
Speaker 0: I mean, I think dr.

249
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,236
Speaker 0: McNinja and Wondermark are the most recent comics.

250
00:16:27,256 --> 00:16:29,779
Speaker 0: I've added to my the latest Wondermark.

251
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,313
Speaker 0: It's good stuff, I don't know if that can beat stove cat.

252
00:16:33,674 --> 00:16:35,728
Speaker 1: no, it's not as good as dove cat But it's still.

253
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,519
Speaker 1: it's pretty good.

254
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,830
Speaker 1: I mean He's definitely doing a much more funniness lately.

255
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:44,366
Speaker 0: and the thing is about that comic is a lot of the jokes He does or they've been done before.

256
00:16:44,426 --> 00:16:44,928
Speaker 0: it's not like.

257
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,780
Speaker 0: oh, I haven't seen a joke like this before but sometimes his jokes original.

258
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,605
Speaker 0: It's just the way there.

259
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,813
Speaker 0: I don't know the style and the way it's done just always gets me.

260
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,220
Speaker 1: It's fantastic poop jokes and top hat.

261
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,865
Speaker 0: But I don't.

262
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,899
Speaker 0: I didn't even look at what the rest of this comic is.

263
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:04,930
Speaker 0: All I know is that I saw a link to it.

264
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,619
Speaker 0: I guess the comic is called truck bearing kibble.

265
00:17:08,242 --> 00:17:09,931
Speaker 0: But all right it the.

266
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:19,405
Speaker 0: the title of this comic is on executable and it's a Lego man and a Lego Pope and a Lego executioner and Lego gallows.

267
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:25,794
Speaker 0: it is the only thing that could have made it better I guess if it had been the same Lego gallows that I always made as a kid.

268
00:17:25,814 --> 00:17:28,624
Speaker 0: you take that whip and you stick it On top of a Lego.

269
00:17:28,744 --> 00:17:33,438
Speaker 1: I made the gallows the same way with my Robin Hood's forest men playset.

270
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:37,480
Speaker 0: I remember I got in trouble as a kid cuz my brother had his like Lego world.

271
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:38,676
Speaker 0: I had mine and we'd fight.

272
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,949
Speaker 1: See I always had all the forest men and I had these.

273
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,420
Speaker 1: at first I got this one that was like these two trees.

274
00:17:43,621 --> 00:17:48,165
Speaker 1: Right, but one tree had a door and a platform, you know and the other one had a ladder.

275
00:17:48,225 --> 00:17:53,146
Speaker 1: and then there was a bridge that went from one tree to the other and all the Robin Hood guys would stay.

276
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,960
Speaker 1: all the Robin Hood Lego guys would stand on it and shoot arrows, right?

277
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,065
Speaker 1: Well, they wouldn't really shoot the arrows.

278
00:17:57,085 --> 00:18:00,180
Speaker 0: They'd hold it bow and arrow in one hand and smile, right?

279
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,091
Speaker 1: Then I got this other.

280
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,440
Speaker 1: they also had quivers on their backs.

281
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:04,607
Speaker 1: Um, then I got it.

282
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:06,820
Speaker 1: then I got his other Robin Hood Lego.

283
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:19,244
Speaker 1: He playset where it was like this big tree like the whole thing opened up and it was at a door that would open and close like a like a port cutlass without spikes and it had a little Drawbridge.

284
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:22,840
Speaker 1: and it was like a tree in the middle of the water and it was high quality.

285
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:26,720
Speaker 1: So then I got a castle and I was big in those castles.

286
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,505
Speaker 0: Yeah I remember when I got ice planet.

287
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,675
Speaker 0: that was like the biggest hot shit to ever raise my press.

288
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,040
Speaker 1: ice planet was wicked cool.

289
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,548
Speaker 1: but all I ever had from ice planet was one guy in a snowmobile and it Orange ain't neon orange chainsaw.

290
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:40,231
Speaker 0: See that's the thing.

291
00:18:40,251 --> 00:18:50,819
Speaker 1: The neon orange was like the most valuable so high and neon orange stuff was wicked cool with the blue and the chainsaws and Lego dudes the chainsaws to cut the ice.

292
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:56,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, made out of the rarest substance in the world as far as those guys can tell a translucent neon orange Lego.

293
00:18:58,862 --> 00:19:03,895
Speaker 0: But I remember I got in trouble as a kid because you know My brother and I had our different Lego worlds and we were always war.

294
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:04,880
Speaker 1: We're not doing a show about Lego.

295
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:07,296
Speaker 1: No, you're gonna tell the story about the stupid space shuttle.

296
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,820
Speaker 0: No, no, no I'm not gonna tell the whole story.

297
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,640
Speaker 0: But I got in trouble when I I caught some of his spies that he'd stuck into my land.

298
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:19,451
Speaker 0: so to make an example to the others I Had a public hanging and I left them all.

299
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:20,154
Speaker 1: you brought it.

300
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:23,590
Speaker 1: you brought it back Back around to the yellows, but I did.

301
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 0: I hung four of his Lego men as spies And I brought them on a little cart with a gallows in front of his base and left it in his room with a warning.

302
00:19:32,447 --> 00:19:33,557
Speaker 0: And then my mom yelled at me.

303
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,130
Speaker 1: But I've been clever.

304
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,517
Speaker 0: this joke is good on multiple levels and I'll leave it at that.

305
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:49,293
Speaker 0: I think what helps one Everyone's smiling because they're like, oh man, yeah, of course and two it's just.

306
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:50,777
Speaker 0: it's so perfect.

307
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:53,465
Speaker 0: It's pretty good Alright, so what do you got for me?

308
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,040
Speaker 1: Oh, it's pretty lame for things the day if rim has to go to a webcomic.

309
00:19:57,101 --> 00:19:57,992
Speaker 1: So I'm even lamer here.

310
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:17,414
Speaker 1: formula one starts again in like 40 some odd days right before formula one begins again the next season and You know it's now's about the time and people start to show off all the new cars and the new Ferrari is like God, I don't think I've ever seen a better car in my life.

311
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,640
Speaker 1: You got to look at this thing.

312
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:23,432
Speaker 1: It's just the odd blows you away And they even show the steering wheel is more complex than ever.

313
00:20:23,452 --> 00:20:25,340
Speaker 1: I don't know how the fuck the people drive these fucking things.

314
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:25,711
Speaker 1: I don't know.

315
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:29,408
Speaker 1: But yeah There's a the f1 webs the official formula.

316
00:20:29,488 --> 00:20:33,740
Speaker 1: one website is actually redone and it's now no longer sucks ass.

317
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:41,460
Speaker 1: So they actually have this really convenient Well-designed gallery where you can easily look at all the pictures the new cars.

318
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,887
Speaker 1: So I'll just link you to that and you can go.

319
00:20:43,907 --> 00:20:50,288
Speaker 1: ooh and ah pictures of new cars that are awesome Speaking of which as soon as it gets warm up.

320
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,155
Speaker 0: We got to do that go-kart thing.

321
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:53,580
Speaker 0: We keep talking about never do it.

322
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,904
Speaker 0: Yes, we have the money.

323
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:55,767
Speaker 0: We can do it.

324
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:59,740
Speaker 1: the key words when it's warm because woman it's gold.

325
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:02,667
Speaker 0: But speaking of just going and doing things.

326
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:11,802
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've been able to guess from the title of the episode, but We at the front row crew have a long-standing tradition of every year Like.

327
00:21:12,224 --> 00:21:15,620
Speaker 0: I guess part of it's that we we did things in college when we were poor.

328
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,386
Speaker 0: So things we did had to be like.

329
00:21:17,807 --> 00:21:23,732
Speaker 0: we had to never take risks or we just lose out because we couldn't afford to make A mistake like driving to Otacon.

330
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:27,219
Speaker 0: if we'd so much as gotten lost We might not have had enough money to buy gas to get home.

331
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,251
Speaker 1: Well, maybe you I had a little buffer, but I was.

332
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:30,652
Speaker 1: I was.

333
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,459
Speaker 1: I was bad but not as bad as you were.

334
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:32,720
Speaker 1: you were.

335
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:34,543
Speaker 1: You had to.

336
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:36,148
Speaker 1: you know have people feed you.

337
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:41,335
Speaker 1: I didn't but I still would go there with a pile of money and then leave Empty-handed and then you know, yeah

338
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:55,431
Speaker 0: Yeah but Like after Kyle we kind of got set in our ways for every year like the big trip of the front row crew would be We'd all go to Otacon every year and then we'd have a road rally to Wildwood, New Jersey Where we'd stay at Scott Johnson's Beach House for the week.

339
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Wildwood is great, you know.

340
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:10,220
Speaker 1: but the thing about Wildwood is that the reason we did that is because It was sort of like you went with Otacon So you sort of were more efficient use of your vacation time Yeah, and also it was partly that that was kind of for a long time.

341
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,940
Speaker 0: That was the era where the front row crew was scattered to the wind.

342
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:15,240
Speaker 0: Everyone got out of college and all went out and got jobs.

343
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,450
Speaker 0: It was before we'd all kind of come back together in upstate.

344
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:24,894
Speaker 1: Well upstate or downstate, New York, depending on your perspective Yeah, but it was also really cheap because we someone had a house there.

345
00:22:24,934 --> 00:22:26,120
Speaker 1: We'd had to pay for a hotel.

346
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:34,959
Speaker 1: Transportation was by car, you know, we could carpool Yeah, and also being on vacation for a week like that was public and free.

347
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:39,080
Speaker 0: It definitely added the aspect of you don't have to do shit.

348
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:42,560
Speaker 0: We get there and we'd spend two days just laying in the house doing nothing.

349
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:46,240
Speaker 1: I mean you go on a vacation somewhere like Disney World or something, you know, which can be fun.

350
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,145
Speaker 1: I've done that twice.

351
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:50,020
Speaker 1: you got to like get up and run around and do things.

352
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Speaker 1: You know if you go to the public beach and your friend owns the beach house, you could just be like I wake up whenever you want.

353
00:22:58,604 --> 00:23:00,380
Speaker 1: Take your sweet ass time.

354
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,576
Speaker 1: Nothing cut nothing really cost you money, but food and arcade games.

355
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,830
Speaker 0: Yes when you're hungry There's infinite amounts of fried things.

356
00:23:08,271 --> 00:23:10,380
Speaker 1: when you're more hungry need real food.

357
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,260
Speaker 1: You got to get in the car for five minutes, but that's okay because then you go to that diner.

358
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:15,131
Speaker 0: I love that diner.

359
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:15,759
Speaker 1: It's a good dinner.

360
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,295
Speaker 0: It's not the best honor in the world, but it's in the upper some percent.

361
00:23:19,335 --> 00:23:20,480
Speaker 1: I like the Russo's.

362
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,730
Speaker 0: Other is almost as good as the de Bellas the Russo's we're.

363
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,362
Speaker 0: a small sandwich is too much and a large sandwich is fucking too much Exactly.

364
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:31,591
Speaker 0: I remember the first time I went there.

365
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,960
Speaker 0: I was like, oh man that large is eight bucks.

366
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,570
Speaker 0: I'm getting in Scott Johnson's like you should reconsider like those where the sides are better than the meal.

367
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:45,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, chocolate pudding and that cheese broccoli thing she's broccoli.

368
00:23:46,287 --> 00:23:50,478
Speaker 0: Oh That guy's out of business anyway.

369
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,000
Speaker 0: So part of the appeal to was that you know, the crew is somewhat scattered.

370
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,920
Speaker 0: We didn't get to see each other for like we'd all get together for things.

371
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,540
Speaker 0: But the week of awesome as it was called the first time we did it was kind of this chance.

372
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,386
Speaker 0: It was like our Mecca our homecoming.

373
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:17,806
Speaker 0: the whole front row crew would go to Otacon and have a crazy time But we wouldn't really hang out because Otacon you got to do stuff And then we go to the beach and we just hang out for a week and it was kind of like the annual reset of The crew but

374
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,919
Speaker 1: also New Year's and that was it though.

375
00:24:20,274 --> 00:24:25,620
Speaker 0: Yeah But now we all live together and we all were all relatively successful in our in our relative domains.

376
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:32,020
Speaker 0: And now it's to the point where I feel like we're young and I want to sew wild oats as it were.

377
00:24:32,702 --> 00:24:38,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my plan was always, you know, I like at first like it was sort of unthinkable that we would not go to.

378
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:44,985
Speaker 1: So it was like a natural thing like of course I go to Wildwood and I was trying to make plans to do another Vacation in addition to that.

379
00:24:45,005 --> 00:24:50,127
Speaker 1: like I want to go on a real vacation, you know Europe or something to see old shit That's always scotch dick.

380
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:51,637
Speaker 0: I want to go where the old shit is.

381
00:24:51,677 --> 00:24:52,100
Speaker 1: look at it.

382
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,264
Speaker 1: That's pretty much what I want to do.

383
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:59,868
Speaker 1: is I want to go where their castles and ruins and you know South America like Aztecs and Incas.

384
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:03,059
Speaker 0: that is the main reason why I want to go to Turkey so much.

385
00:25:03,441 --> 00:25:08,080
Speaker 1: Well, because you want to see that specific old shit because that podcast got you interested in that.

386
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,531
Speaker 0: Specifically, I just want to go to the the Mediterranean in general.

387
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:18,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been to Israel which is technically Mediterranean and part of it, you know and Mediterranean is awesome by me.

388
00:25:18,947 --> 00:25:20,876
Speaker 1: See some grease see some Italy.

389
00:25:21,037 --> 00:25:21,499
Speaker 1: I could do that.

390
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:24,429
Speaker 0: Well, we were thinking about this and then we kind of suddenly realized.

391
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:24,931
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

392
00:25:25,694 --> 00:25:29,638
Speaker 0: We're young and we have no Responsibilities and we have money.

393
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:30,543
Speaker 0: There's.

394
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:35,160
Speaker 0: there is no reason not to go out and do the things we want to do now while we're still young enough to enjoy.

395
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:47,782
Speaker 1: Also part of the problem is I don't have enough vacation days right - that's you yeah, but I don't have enough vacation days to do all the conventions and things and then also go to Wildwood and then also do Something else.

396
00:25:47,823 --> 00:25:50,133
Speaker 1: So the idea came and I said, you know what?

397
00:25:50,153 --> 00:25:51,539
Speaker 1: I've been to Wildwood enough times.

398
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:53,267
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna go there for us in my life.

399
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:54,493
Speaker 1: Let's do something besides.

400
00:25:54,533 --> 00:26:03,325
Speaker 0: that instead of that and Coincident to that was the idea that why don't we do one of those things that people always say they do but they won't one Of those things that we've always said?

401
00:26:03,365 --> 00:26:03,787
Speaker 0: we'll do that.

402
00:26:03,827 --> 00:26:04,249
Speaker 0: We won't.

403
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:06,920
Speaker 0: let's go on our road trip.

404
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:09,891
Speaker 1: Well, not exactly not exactly the full-on road trip.

405
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:15,875
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is the original plan was yeah Why don't we just get a Winnebago and drive from here to California?

406
00:26:15,896 --> 00:26:20,050
Speaker 0: And we're like, yeah Yeah, and we're planning our vacation days for that.

407
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,572
Speaker 1: It's a boat.

408
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:28,245
Speaker 0: We're like, alright, let's see if we start You know here and we go up through New York and we could stop it like Cedar Point along the way Stop in Chicago,

409
00:26:28,265 --> 00:26:28,325
Speaker 1: and

410
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:32,220
Speaker 0: then I realized that once we get to like Minneapolis

411
00:26:33,521 --> 00:26:36,455
Speaker 1: Once you pass like Mount Rushmore, there's nothing.

412
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:41,270
Speaker 0: once you've had Milwaukee There's nothing until you hit Mount Rushmore and then there's nothing again.

413
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,012
Speaker 0: Nothing.

414
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:42,574
Speaker 0: Nothing.

415
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,055
Speaker 0: Nothing to you.

416
00:26:43,095 --> 00:26:44,820
Speaker 0: It's Spokane, but there's nothing in Spokane.

417
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,234
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you go you got to go way south or to like Vegas to get something.

418
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:51,080
Speaker 1: It's just the middle of nowhere.

419
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:51,482
Speaker 1: So we

420
00:26:51,522 --> 00:27:04,991
Speaker 0: realized that all right, that's infeasible and also probably wouldn't be that fun Unlike because then it would basically be the week of awesome, but we'd all be sitting in a Winnebago Living out of it and instead of living at a beach house

421
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:08,143
Speaker 1: and at all that and during the that time someone would have to Be driving.

422
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:11,640
Speaker 0: Well, I think the gas yeah, that was the other thing that got me.

423
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,908
Speaker 0: It's like all right, Winnebagos get what six miles to a gallon.

424
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:16,055
Speaker 0: We're gonna drive what 2,000 miles.

425
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:17,380
Speaker 0: how much does gas cost?

426
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:25,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is, you know, if you spend the same amount of time in a hotel a nice hotel It's gonna you know be the same amount of money.

427
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:31,094
Speaker 1: ish, you know, so the gas while it's expensive You got to realize that gas is instead of your hotel cost.

428
00:27:31,114 --> 00:27:32,360
Speaker 1: so it kind of works out.

429
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:38,524
Speaker 0: Yeah But at the same time part of the reason you want to go on a road trip is not to sit in a car The whole time.

430
00:27:38,764 --> 00:27:44,420
Speaker 0: yeah with your friends you can you can sit in your house playing a DS game exactly and all and well.

431
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:53,814
Speaker 0: Oh see the country, but I I don't want to dis South Dakota and Wyoming and Montana and Idaho But I have better things to do with my time.

432
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,040
Speaker 0: I've driven through Ohio.

433
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:55,964
Speaker 0: I know what that's like.

434
00:27:56,165 --> 00:27:57,491
Speaker 1: the people in those states are probably like.

435
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:58,596
Speaker 1: we understand we live here.

436
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:02,129
Speaker 0: Yeah But so then we thought wait a minute.

437
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,078
Speaker 0: All right going to PAX.

438
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:08,391
Speaker 1: Yeah We're going to PAX no matter what we will be there at PAX.

439
00:28:08,492 --> 00:28:12,464
Speaker 1: Oh wait, there's a guarantee unless we die or something We might not be guests.

440
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:14,834
Speaker 0: We might not be doing events, but we're gonna be going.

441
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:23,300
Speaker 1: we're gonna be going if even if we have To go as normal people and if we go as normal people We'll sit around playing games go into the concert and go into the big events.

442
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:25,760
Speaker 0: Wow, it'll be so weird to beat a con as a civilian.

443
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:31,039
Speaker 1: You know this year when he starts being like Omega not something something I can actually go for it.

444
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:37,400
Speaker 0: You know what as my the odds of even having a chance to compete are so low that then why not go for it?

445
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:38,265
Speaker 0: No, I'll go for it.

446
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,599
Speaker 1: Anyway, and if I make it then I'll start training.

447
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,766
Speaker 0: I would train so hardcore.

448
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,075
Speaker 1: But anyway, I would go buy a 360 and train it up.

449
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,219
Speaker 0: I'd take a week off work.

450
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:48,167
Speaker 1: Maybe I wouldn't have a week.

451
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,031
Speaker 1: I'm using the week to go.

452
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:49,996
Speaker 0: I got another week.

453
00:28:50,277 --> 00:28:52,746
Speaker 0: I take the week off I would do nothing but train for a week straight.

454
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:57,100
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, so alright, but people always say well go out west.

455
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,366
Speaker 0: You know road trip out west.

456
00:28:58,386 --> 00:29:06,400
Speaker 0: and we thought well if you look at Google Maps all the stuff We want to see out west isn't a nice swoosh pretty much from Dallas down and all the way up to Seattle.

457
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,498
Speaker 0: so Why not just fly out there?

458
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,100
Speaker 0: Do all the drive all around the southwest and then drive into California and catch a train to Seattle.

459
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,780
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean some plan along those lines.

460
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,893
Speaker 1: I mean that the problem here is exactly how many days we have.

461
00:29:21,954 --> 00:29:23,541
Speaker 1: cuz I mean look at all the things we want to Do.

462
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:27,340
Speaker 1: we want to go to Texas to see Texas and they got the Schlitter bond there?

463
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,228
Speaker 1: Which is the best water park in the world supposedly?

464
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:34,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then we got a desert bus it from Houston all the way to El Paso.

465
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:35,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that kind of.

466
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,120
Speaker 1: that's pretty sucky, right?

467
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,579
Speaker 0: And I really want to go to El Paso.

468
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, my grandpa has been there a bunch of times and we could swing through San Antonio go to the basement.

469
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:47,980
Speaker 1: Yep We go like Mexico this cool stuff that we're going to Mexico.

470
00:29:48,061 --> 00:29:49,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, speaking of which get your passport in order.

471
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:58,296
Speaker 0: All of you all of you out there in the front row crew who may be listening to this and planning to come now My passports been in order since like 2000. my passport not so much in order.

472
00:29:58,457 --> 00:29:58,939
Speaker 1: a good job.

473
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we got to decide.

474
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,220
Speaker 0: I mean we're gonna fly into El Paso Tucson Phoenix right into Vegas.

475
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:16,637
Speaker 1: We got to fly somewhere west probably southwest and then make our way north and we had to get to Seattle on like Thursday Perplex and then fly home from Seattle to New York.

476
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:25,300
Speaker 0: Yep So this is turning into something awesome And I I'm kind of excited about it because yeah, this is kind of like the the baby run the test run.

477
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,409
Speaker 0: We're gonna we're gonna do this crazy trip.

478
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,220
Speaker 0: And while we're gonna plan we're not gonna plan so thoroughly.

479
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,600
Speaker 0: We're kind of just gonna wing it after a certain point.

480
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:38,403
Speaker 1: The thing is we do have to sort of have a schedule or else because if we don't make it to Seattle by Thursday or Friday Then it.

481
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:39,959
Speaker 1: we just botched the whole plan.

482
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,868
Speaker 0: Well, no, cuz the thing is worst case scenario.

483
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:47,460
Speaker 0: say we get to San Francisco and we've we've screwed up and we don't have time.

484
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,687
Speaker 0: Just get on a plane to see ya.

485
00:30:49,727 --> 00:30:53,520
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking like, you know, we're in Vegas on Thursday or some, you know.

486
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,580
Speaker 0: Or we catch him a red-eye flight from Vegas to Seattle.

487
00:30:56,824 --> 00:30:57,800
Speaker 0: We pay out the buck for it.

488
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,960
Speaker 1: But then we get there, you know saying we could be caught maybe like in between like Vegas and San Francisco.

489
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,053
Speaker 1: Or you know, we could have bad timing or something.

490
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,180
Speaker 0: the odds of that are pretty low.

491
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:07,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could you know.

492
00:31:07,774 --> 00:31:08,319
Speaker 1: just you know.

493
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:19,200
Speaker 1: The other thing is depending on how far away from San Francisco or Seattle we start The less time we have to spend in each thing and the more sort of interim traveling we have to do.

494
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,340
Speaker 0: Yeah Like as much as I want to see Texas and also It works that we could fly out there meet two of our friends and then continue.

495
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:30,500
Speaker 0: It's like every step closer we start we can relax more do more in that area.

496
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,680
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like if we fly just to Vegas and don't go anywhere from Vegas except Seattle.

497
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:39,320
Speaker 1: Then we can spend a whole shit a ton of time there, but you don't need to spend that much time there.

498
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:49,053
Speaker 1: But as we fly to say Arizona, then we can spend you know half time in Arizona half time in Vegas But then we lose the hours it takes to get from Arizona to Vegas.

499
00:31:49,093 --> 00:31:53,452
Speaker 1: you see so every additional thing We want to see because everything is spread out.

500
00:31:53,492 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 1: I point out we lose a bunch of travel time.

501
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,010
Speaker 0: There's effectively no speed limit in Arizona.

502
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,900
Speaker 0: I know I know we can get there pretty quick.

503
00:31:58,961 --> 00:31:59,858
Speaker 1: It's still a few hours.

504
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,660
Speaker 1: You know We're losing time each additional stop, and I'm not saying we should have the minimum number possible stops.

505
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:06,566
Speaker 1: I'm saying we need to.

506
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:15,949
Speaker 0: you know it's tough to calculate this business yep But the real deal is that the only time I've ever been out west was not that long ago when for the first time first Time I was ever west of Chicago.

507
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:18,000
Speaker 1: I've never been west of Novi, Michigan.

508
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:24,855
Speaker 0: Wow, I took Scott the furthest west he's ever been yeah, and I've been south to Florida though.

509
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:26,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've also been south.

510
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:37,679
Speaker 0: I've been all up and down the east side of the country Westside never and I've been to Israel Which is either really far east or really far west and I guess if you count the plane like flew over Italy and shit.

511
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:41,859
Speaker 0: so But yeah, you know this is one of those things that a lot of people always talk about.

512
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:50,140
Speaker 0: yeah I want to go on a road trip out west drive through the desert and A lot of people should talk when it comes to that sort of thing, but we for once are not shit talking.

513
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,985
Speaker 0: We're gonna do this.

514
00:32:51,045 --> 00:32:54,994
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of how and exactly what the Itinerary is gonna be.

515
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:56,830
Speaker 0: yeah I mean I'm thinking it in general.

516
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,887
Speaker 0: the stuff we want to do is first My mom's ranch in Tucson.

517
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:04,125
Speaker 0: we can stop there because there's a lot of stuff in Tucson to do in the desert Lot of stuff.

518
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:06,033
Speaker 1: I've been to deserts, but deserts are okay.

519
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,580
Speaker 1: I'd like to see some Grand Canyon action.

520
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:15,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is if we fly into Arizona right around there There's a lot to do and a lot to see ghost towns everywhere and those towns are cool of course.

521
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,292
Speaker 0: up We want to go to Mexico pretty much the closest place to Mexico.

522
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:26,940
Speaker 0: There is Nogales, which is See the word I would say seedy, but I don't think that really does Nogales justice.

523
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,391
Speaker 1: I don't really want to go to a seedy Mexican place.

524
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:31,400
Speaker 1: I want to sort of go to a happy Mexican place.

525
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:36,124
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to go somewhere like El Paso, but then we got to start in Texas Or Roswell or something.

526
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,229
Speaker 0: I guess we could start in El Paso.

527
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,634
Speaker 1: I don't really want to go to Roswell.

528
00:33:38,674 --> 00:33:39,618
Speaker 1: There's nutjabs.

529
00:33:39,738 --> 00:33:42,869
Speaker 0: nah Yeah But yeah, I mean from there.

530
00:33:42,889 --> 00:33:48,632
Speaker 0: We're thinking maybe we'll drive up through All that to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon.

531
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:51,060
Speaker 0: They're kind of near each other definitely want to go to those things.

532
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,884
Speaker 1: Those are high-quality.

533
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:55,580
Speaker 0: I want to spend a day or two in Vegas partly because I don't really want to gamble.

534
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,804
Speaker 0: I mean I can gamble in Atlantic City, and I've learned that gambling is great because you win a lot of money Next time rim gambles.

535
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:04,429
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry guys.

536
00:34:04,469 --> 00:34:05,794
Speaker 1: I got to go back to New York.

537
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:06,697
Speaker 1: I lost all my money.

538
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,045
Speaker 0: campaign bags See I I've.

539
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:11,637
Speaker 0: I have won for you, but 100% of the time.

540
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:20,632
Speaker 0: I've gambled once Other times when when I went to Canada what about me gambled at the RIT casino night.

541
00:34:20,652 --> 00:34:22,340
Speaker 0: you lost big, but that wasn't real money.

542
00:34:22,802 --> 00:34:25,380
Speaker 1: Hey, well you had to pay real money to get that fake money.

543
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,014
Speaker 0: I think real money to get fake money, and then we bet it all on red.

544
00:34:28,034 --> 00:34:36,040
Speaker 1: Yeah If you would have won that we would have had a ps2 on Release which we probably would have been immediately sold and then bought food.

545
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:37,059
Speaker 1: I don't think I would have sold it.

546
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,614
Speaker 0: I think oh you realize that you would have owned like 1/6 of it.

547
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:44,139
Speaker 0: We would have been in the Bart Simpson Radioactive Man number one scenario.

548
00:34:45,103 --> 00:34:47,717
Speaker 0: You're right, and I think the rest of us would have voted to sell it.

549
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:49,603
Speaker 0: So that's what.

550
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:52,924
Speaker 0: there was only one game out back then that dumb robot game That wasn't fun.

551
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,735
Speaker 1: zone of the enders was a good game was okay.

552
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:55,580
Speaker 1: It is very short.

553
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,563
Speaker 1: There wasn't much to it.

554
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:59,215
Speaker 1: like I remember I would be like anime club social nights.

555
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:03,686
Speaker 1: people do playing zone of the enders They just beat it right there, and I'd be like oh well That's not much of a game is it?

556
00:35:03,787 --> 00:35:10,240
Speaker 0: if it's so quick yeah, but in terms of Vegas I mean I feel like if you live in America you should go to Vegas at least once.

557
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,000
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the pleasure capital of this country.

558
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:14,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to see some shows.

559
00:35:15,901 --> 00:35:17,192
Speaker 1: Gamble one time at least.

560
00:35:17,212 --> 00:35:18,120
Speaker 0: I just want to see shows.

561
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,760
Speaker 0: I pretty much plan to get to Vegas and I want to eat and get tickets to every show that I want to see.

562
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, can we?

563
00:35:24,303 --> 00:35:26,400
Speaker 1: because they it's you know Vegas is the one place?

564
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,184
Speaker 1: I mean in New York.

565
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:33,240
Speaker 1: right if you want to go see a show like Broadway they have Sometimes this afternoon shows like on the weekends, and I think also Wednesdays, right?

566
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,347
Speaker 1: I don't remember exactly.

567
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:35,696
Speaker 0: plus you can just pay out the button.

568
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:36,219
Speaker 0: you know go.

569
00:35:37,382 --> 00:35:49,240
Speaker 1: And the shows at night in Vegas the shows in the morning the late morning the after Early-afternoon late afternoon the night between the late night the crack of dawn in the morning the all-you-can-eat steak buffet.

570
00:35:49,501 --> 00:35:51,674
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's like this just shows constantly.

571
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:55,007
Speaker 1: you could just spend all day Seeing a different show every single moment.

572
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:59,360
Speaker 1: live shows you know cuz live entertainment is a whole different category than you know.

573
00:35:59,561 --> 00:36:02,879
Speaker 0: Non live entertainment, and if you don't gamble it doesn't cost that much.

574
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:10,340
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't because most of those you know shows and things are sort of things to attract people to where there is gambling.

575
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:18,480
Speaker 1: and The reason those shows and things are so cheap is because the gambling subsidizes them, so if you minimize your gambling You know I'd gamble maybe once maybe twice.

576
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:21,579
Speaker 0: I'll just go into one casino put like 400 bucks on red and walk.

577
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:30,876
Speaker 1: yeah I mean no I wouldn't do that I'd go to like a cheap casino or like this very low minimums and I would like play every game once because the way I view a casino is like an arcade.

578
00:36:30,937 --> 00:36:37,239
Speaker 1: you know like if I Go into a video arcade I put money in these machines and fun comes out And I don't care that I lost money.

579
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:44,666
Speaker 1: So if I go into a casino, and I play like you know poker with some guys right and it cost me You know 20 bucks.

580
00:36:45,008 --> 00:36:46,514
Speaker 0: You're not gonna find a poker table.

581
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:47,800
Speaker 0: That's gonna cost you 20 bucks.

582
00:36:48,021 --> 00:36:51,226
Speaker 1: I'm just saying if I get 20 bucks of fun Then it was worth it.

583
00:36:51,286 --> 00:36:57,938
Speaker 1: if it cost me 500 bucks all right now I don't think I'm getting a $500 worth of fun playing poker But if I was it would be a good deal.

584
00:36:57,958 --> 00:37:04,360
Speaker 0: now How much fun would you have playing $20 worth of craps versus how much fun would you have playing $20 worth of Rampart arcade?

585
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the problem with that.

586
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:09,058
Speaker 1: that is the problem with that, but you know I like.

587
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:10,607
Speaker 0: I like the way We gambled in Atlantic City.

588
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:18,892
Speaker 0: we walked in we bet all the money We brought on red or black or whatever a bunch of times And then as soon as we were ahead we walked right out of there.

589
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:19,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what you gotta do.

590
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:23,536
Speaker 0: all right That trip is still paying for everything.

591
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,203
Speaker 1: I do No, it's not.

592
00:37:25,424 --> 00:37:27,991
Speaker 0: I've contributed one cent of that gambling money to everything.

593
00:37:28,011 --> 00:37:29,355
Speaker 0: I've done since I'd gambled.

594
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:41,969
Speaker 0: you've made a hundred transactions say Anyway So but also I really want to see Penn and tell her partly because you can just go talk to them after the show and I feel like I could talk to Penn for a little bit.

595
00:37:42,451 --> 00:37:48,212
Speaker 1: No if he doesn't just be like yeah, I'm crazy What I know blah yeah, yeah, but I could get his attention.

596
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,596
Speaker 1: I think yeah, but it's like.

597
00:37:49,616 --> 00:37:50,720
Speaker 1: what would I say to him?

598
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,760
Speaker 1: You can only you know he talked to him for like a minute or so.

599
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,684
Speaker 1: Maybe you know.

600
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,989
Speaker 0: so it's like yeah, the best angle.

601
00:37:55,029 --> 00:38:01,309
Speaker 0: I have is that I argued with Michael Godot twice nah And he actually it got to the point where he kept responding.

602
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,416
Speaker 0: so yeah, I figured I ain't him a little bit.

603
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:04,440
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe.

604
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:10,280
Speaker 0: But yeah of course right there is the Mojave National Preserve and the Grand Canyon and Death Valley.

605
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:11,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, Death Valley.

606
00:38:11,966 --> 00:38:17,938
Speaker 1: It feels like the best way to experience death valleys is drive through with air conditioning real fast.

607
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:24,340
Speaker 0: So I think the plan is something along the lines if we want to fly into either like Texas or more likely, Arizona.

608
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:31,780
Speaker 0: And then and you can do this I've been looking at I'm trying to find the best deals and everything But you can rent one-way RVs and one-way Winnebagos.

609
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:38,623
Speaker 0: Huh, so we're thinking get an RV or Winnebago or something and then just drive through all the stuff We want to see.

610
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:46,483
Speaker 0: you know tool around the desert hit that hit the Grand Canyon and hit Las Vegas And then from there hike all the way through Death Valley To Reno.

611
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:49,574
Speaker 1: and you want to walk through Death Valley all the way to Reno.

612
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:54,071
Speaker 0: well hike in the colloquial sense In drive in a Winnebago.

613
00:38:54,131 --> 00:39:00,520
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm like okay You know going for a hike in Death Valley like for a few hours like you know look at some cactuses.

614
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,493
Speaker 1: Avoid some scorpions.

615
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:03,882
Speaker 1: that could be cool You know.

616
00:39:04,183 --> 00:39:07,233
Speaker 1: but hike across Death Valley first of all.

617
00:39:07,253 --> 00:39:11,414
Speaker 1: that would take our entire vacation in terms of days And I know the much more important.

618
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,985
Speaker 0: We would die Would die.

619
00:39:14,126 --> 00:39:14,789
Speaker 1: I wouldn't die me.

620
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:21,355
Speaker 0: I walked for two days in the desert in Israel Two days in the desert in Israel, I don't think you understand how hot Death Valley is.

621
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,527
Speaker 1: I don't know Desert near the equator.

622
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:24,768
Speaker 1: I did.

623
00:39:24,788 --> 00:39:26,074
Speaker 1: can it really get worse than that.

624
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,098
Speaker 0: Death Valley is pretty bad.

625
00:39:28,301 --> 00:39:30,551
Speaker 1: Also, I point out as long as you have enough water with you.

626
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:31,515
Speaker 1: It's all good.

627
00:39:31,655 --> 00:39:33,443
Speaker 1: and equipment yeah Yeah, I I.

628
00:39:33,765 --> 00:39:38,124
Speaker 0: here's the thing with our level of expertise and the amount of strength We have to carry water.

629
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,589
Speaker 0: We would die if we tried to.

630
00:39:39,629 --> 00:39:39,790
Speaker 0: well.

631
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,535
Speaker 1: We had camels carrying the water.

632
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:45,248
Speaker 1: ah See the camel is very necessary.

633
00:39:45,288 --> 00:39:46,474
Speaker 1: so yeah in Death Valley.

634
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,683
Speaker 1: I would have some sort of horse Carrying the water.

635
00:39:49,703 --> 00:39:55,380
Speaker 0: I think we sort of a camel motorized horse with wheels perhaps with several hundred horses.

636
00:39:56,166 --> 00:40:03,080
Speaker 0: hundred horses yes Ours is a fire and steel, but we're also thinking I mean there's a lot to do out there.

637
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:17,177
Speaker 0: But pretty much after we had Vegas and all that and drive through Death Valley and go on the final road trip bit Instead of driving all the way up, California because I don't really want to drive all the way up, California We could hook up with one of the penny arcade pegs.

638
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:21,591
Speaker 1: super trips Maybe maybe but we have to I think those super trips.

639
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:23,620
Speaker 1: You know they they start pretty early.

640
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,380
Speaker 1: We'd have to get like on a train somewhere.

641
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:26,266
Speaker 1: I know this.

642
00:40:26,286 --> 00:40:33,900
Speaker 1: there's got to be a train from San Francisco to Seattle But I don't know how long would it take to drive from say Reno to San Francisco or something like ways?

643
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might take like a whole day.

644
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:36,424
Speaker 1: So it's like.

645
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:37,007
Speaker 1: you know.

646
00:40:37,107 --> 00:40:43,720
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's gonna be the most efficient use of the time But at the same time it might be fun because we can stop at all those weird places along the way.

647
00:40:43,961 --> 00:40:48,539
Speaker 1: Maybe it would be Springs, Tonopah Gibbs maybe you know.

648
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:55,420
Speaker 1: Usually I'm sort of against like travel agents because travel agents tend to you know.

649
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:02,760
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you're paying for something that you could do yourself You know with like AAA, or you know just Google Maps, and it's like what do they really do for you?

650
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:06,485
Speaker 1: But then again you know it's like They know exactly.

651
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:10,420
Speaker 1: you know they have tools that we don't have access to like proprietary travel agent software.

652
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,408
Speaker 1: That could be like this is exactly how long it will take.

653
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:18,419
Speaker 0: or I can just ask my grandpa Who knows the Old West like the back of his hand that works, too?

654
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:23,580
Speaker 0: You know and and my mom knows where all these like crazy ghost towns are and just things all over, Arizona.

655
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:24,365
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

656
00:41:24,385 --> 00:41:26,740
Speaker 1: the point is to ask someone else who knows more than we do.

657
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:32,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not a trap I feel like if we just try to plan it ourselves on Google Maps that we will mess up and not make it in time.

658
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:35,277
Speaker 0: I'm definitely pursuing other angles than Google Maps.

659
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:42,806
Speaker 1: Yeah Yes, I'm also pursuing the the paper map And the the map quest.

660
00:41:42,846 --> 00:41:45,055
Speaker 0: come on we can go to gabs and Tonopah.

661
00:41:45,557 --> 00:41:47,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, yante Yes, sir.

662
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,836
Speaker 1: I want to go.

663
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:50,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty.

664
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,507
Speaker 0: You know those things like you.

665
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:58,214
Speaker 1: You see him for the sky, and it's like they'd like arrange the rocks to look like something.

666
00:41:58,876 --> 00:41:59,197
Speaker 1: Yeah.

667
00:41:59,357 --> 00:41:59,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, where is that?

668
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:05,954
Speaker 1: South America, okay, not, Nevada, okay, I thought maybe go see that.

669
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:07,900
Speaker 0: no unless we go to South America.

670
00:42:09,623 --> 00:42:14,327
Speaker 0: So I guess I think the real issue the real thing we have to consider is not so much What are we going to do?

671
00:42:14,347 --> 00:42:15,614
Speaker 0: because that's gonna work itself out.

672
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:16,740
Speaker 0: not are we gonna?

673
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:17,062
Speaker 0: Do it?

674
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,394
Speaker 0: because obviously we're doing this.

675
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:18,879
Speaker 1: we're doing it.

676
00:42:19,141 --> 00:42:19,663
Speaker 1: It's a lock.

677
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:26,813
Speaker 0: the question is who among the front row crew has enough balls to come on a week-long Excursion into the wilds of the Southwest?

678
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:31,658
Speaker 1: yeah, I think also for some people It's not just the balls, but it's also the money in the vacation days.

679
00:42:31,678 --> 00:42:37,419
Speaker 1: like I know There's some people if they had the vacation days they would do it But they don't and some people they have the days or they don't have the money.

680
00:42:37,781 --> 00:42:41,377
Speaker 0: So Emily's the only one with a good excuse because instead of doing this she's going to Finland.

681
00:42:41,397 --> 00:42:45,714
Speaker 1: That's fine You know it's all you know, but you know it's not a lot for not.

682
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:48,104
Speaker 1: It's not a lack of some people It's also a lack of.

683
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:50,054
Speaker 1: it's a lack of balls, but forever.

684
00:42:50,135 --> 00:42:53,951
Speaker 1: It's It's not a lack of balls for everybody there.

685
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,879
Speaker 1: people have the balls that aren't going despite.

686
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:57,626
Speaker 0: Well we don't know who's going yet, or not.

687
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:03,762
Speaker 0: all I know is that some people are particularly excited and some people seem really Reluctant.

688
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:08,239
Speaker 0: yeah, and I wonder how many people we'd have along with us if we were going to Turkey instead of this.

689
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:09,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, well what if we had?

690
00:43:09,814 --> 00:43:10,440
Speaker 1: you know well?

691
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:16,080
Speaker 1: You know if we had a zillion dollars right everyone had a zillion dollars and infinite vacation and no jobs.

692
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,246
Speaker 1: How many people would be up for?

693
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:18,071
Speaker 1: probably everybody.

694
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:22,553
Speaker 0: well, then I would try I wouldn't go to the Southwest I'd be in Europe pretty much to be living in the Mediterranean.

695
00:43:22,654 --> 00:43:24,824
Speaker 1: I'd be in the Southwest at some point Everywhere.

696
00:43:24,945 --> 00:43:26,814
Speaker 0: oh yeah, but I'd spend a lot of time in Monaco.

697
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:40,426
Speaker 1: Oh Monica Yeah, I might spend like a month there Living in the hotel that is also a casino Playing baccarat watching Formula One races Which is once a year.

698
00:43:40,446 --> 00:43:43,400
Speaker 0: if you had that much money you could buy your way into racing in Formula One races.

699
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,511
Speaker 1: No formula one team is like five hundred million dollars.

700
00:43:46,893 --> 00:43:48,860
Speaker 0: if I use that zillions, okay?

701
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,977
Speaker 1: If I have zillion I didn't know a zillion was bigger than five I can buy.

702
00:43:52,198 --> 00:44:00,354
Speaker 0: if I have Effectively Monte Cristo money I can buy an f1 team and then pay them to put me in the car until I die which won't Take long, so you'll die.

703
00:44:00,394 --> 00:44:03,689
Speaker 0: practice one Maybe not practice one cuz I'd probably go.

704
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:04,051
Speaker 1: you're right.

705
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:04,372
Speaker 1: You're right.

706
00:44:04,412 --> 00:44:04,814
Speaker 1: You died.

707
00:44:04,854 --> 00:44:08,219
Speaker 0: go so I would drive So slowly that the engine would catch fire.

708
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,303
Speaker 1: That's not well.

709
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:18,179
Speaker 1: first of all if you drove that slowly the brakes would catch fire first right and second It's not even worth discussing this.

710
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:21,919
