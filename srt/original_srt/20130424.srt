1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,605
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 24th 2013.

2
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:17,982
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight the anime we're not watching.

3
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:25,649
Speaker 1: let's do this all right.

4
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:34,379
Speaker 0: so I think it's just about Oh near the end of April so it's time to curse the Mets because they're not doing the worst.

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,243
Speaker 1: you know every.

6
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,168
Speaker 0: make sure they do the worst.

7
00:00:36,188 --> 00:00:38,638
Speaker 1: every year season starts.

8
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,988
Speaker 1: either someone links it to me or whatever.

9
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:42,032
Speaker 1: it's in a forum somewhere.

10
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:42,715
Speaker 1: it's on Farc.

11
00:00:43,017 --> 00:00:53,552
Speaker 1: there's just that video of Stewie Griffin and family guys sitting down for a baseball game and at the announcer's like and it's opening season and the Mets have lost and then he's like throws his head down and walks away.

12
00:00:53,874 --> 00:00:55,118
Speaker 0: yep that's how it is so.

13
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:58,010
Speaker 0: but anyway we have a pitcher on our team.

14
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:03,168
Speaker 0: his name's Matt Harvey right and he's apparently like the best.

15
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:04,777
Speaker 0: he's pretty much the best pitcher there is.

16
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,306
Speaker 0: he just showed up out of nowhere.

17
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:11,416
Speaker 1: it doesn't mean much though because I mean there was a point where the Tigers had a great pitcher didn't really win.

18
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:12,961
Speaker 1: yeah.

19
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:21,197
Speaker 0: so I thought of talking about this as an opening bit because I saw a guy on the subway just now wearing a Matt Harvey jersey and the.

20
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:23,766
Speaker 0: he didn't go to the.

21
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:26,135
Speaker 0: he thought he was gonna get on the seven and go to the game but he didn't.

22
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:30,874
Speaker 0: okay well you got off at Queensborough Plaza and he went somewhere.

23
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,603
Speaker 1: you know you thought he was.

24
00:01:32,623 --> 00:01:35,983
Speaker 0: I thought you said he thought like I got he was going to the game.

25
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:39,664
Speaker 1: and I'm like what you said that I thought he thought he was going to the game and then didn't.

26
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,914
Speaker 1: and I was like how could you even know?

27
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:47,580
Speaker 0: no it's like you see someone going on the seven train platform wearing a lot of Mets.

28
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:53,956
Speaker 0: shit you think they're gonna get on the seven train especially when the game is gonna start at like 710. right he could easily made it to that game on time.

29
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,065
Speaker 0: he was on the train.

30
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:57,773
Speaker 0: that was the perfect way to get to the game.

31
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:02,857
Speaker 1: I would posit that that's only the case if he's also loud and or belligerent on the train.

32
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:05,970
Speaker 0: no that's on the way home after but anyway.

33
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,698
Speaker 0: so you know the thing is right.

34
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:10,021
Speaker 0: my dad's name is Harvey.

35
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:18,304
Speaker 0: so we usually have a no Jersey buying policy because if you buy if you know if I buy a Matt Harvey Jersey guess it's gonna happen he's gonna break his arm.

36
00:02:18,526 --> 00:02:19,451
Speaker 0: right it's guaranteed.

37
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:24,592
Speaker 0: it's basically saying hey sporting goods store I will pay you I don't know.

38
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,242
Speaker 0: what do they cost like 75 to 100 bucks.

39
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:30,729
Speaker 0: I'll give you a hundred bucks if you can make sure the Matt Harvey breaks his arm like in the next week.

40
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,094
Speaker 0: so thank you.

41
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:34,883
Speaker 0: here have a free Jersey as a token.

42
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:37,452
Speaker 1: see hockey has such the opposite culture.

43
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:41,635
Speaker 1: like you buy the Jersey of the guy that you are sure is going to live forever and he will.

44
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,870
Speaker 1: I mean I still have a Fedorov Jersey and I was good Jersey.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,602
Speaker 1: I think even have a Vernon Jersey laying around.

46
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:47,991
Speaker 0: you should have bought a jogger Jersey.

47
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:49,016
Speaker 0: he's we can live forever.

48
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:52,792
Speaker 1: anyway my brother has a thing in Constantine off.

49
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:56,590
Speaker 0: my dad can buy a Matt Harvey Jersey because at least for him it'll be good.

50
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,952
Speaker 0: even if Matt Harvey like gets hit by a bus he'll still be like because it says Harvey.

51
00:03:01,012 --> 00:03:02,018
Speaker 1: huh so it's Harvey.

52
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:04,772
Speaker 1: we're in the Harvey Jersey drinking a Harvey wall banger.

53
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:17,343
Speaker 1: sure though I you know it's kind of a random aside but I was uh you know I have this like I don't know whitewater rafting Jersey that I just have that I wear when I go skiing like over my under armor but

54
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:18,247
Speaker 0: a white one yeah

55
00:03:18,267 --> 00:03:19,914
Speaker 1: but under my ski jacket.

56
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:25,603
Speaker 1: so when I'm like in the lodge I have something on other than just my undershirt basically and it's for warmth and whatever.

57
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:26,910
Speaker 1: no one ever commented on it.

58
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,464
Speaker 1: it's totally utilitarian kind of old and stained and worn out.

59
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:39,282
Speaker 1: the last few times I went skiing I started wearing my Fedorov red wings Jersey instead and apparently red wings jerseys are girl magnets.

60
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:49,419
Speaker 1: okay because once I was wearing that instead of my white Jersey girls would hit on me at the bar after I was skiing before I got on the bus home reliably.

61
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,226
Speaker 0: it is a ski lodge.

62
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:53,396
Speaker 0: yeah what do you think they do there?

63
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:54,321
Speaker 0: they're not skiing.

64
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:57,156
Speaker 0: they're always like the only one who's going there to ski.

65
00:03:57,297 --> 00:04:00,474
Speaker 1: or they're from upstate New York or they're from there like local.

66
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:08,656
Speaker 0: you are the only one who is at the ski lodge for skiing except for that old guy with the crazy not matching clothes and the young kid on the bunny slope right.

67
00:04:08,676 --> 00:04:10,063
Speaker 0: so and the ski patrol?

68
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:11,168
Speaker 1: I've talked about this a lot.

69
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:12,595
Speaker 1: well not a lot but I brought it up often.

70
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:24,564
Speaker 1: but now that I've gotten past the middle point of the show I want to give a kind of for real review of from the new world or Shinsekai Ori because I've seen enough now to know that it is a good show.

71
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:31,449
Speaker 1: in the very least the worst-case scenario this is a b-plus anime like beaten-out scrap princess.

72
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,358
Speaker 0: is this the one that had a porny manga or was it the pointy at it?

73
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:47,137
Speaker 1: okay there is a it's complicated I'll put it this way what this show is about and I believe it's based on some light novels.

74
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,187
Speaker 1: there may be a manga in other words porn.

75
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,733
Speaker 1: no no so here's the deal.

76
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:54,287
Speaker 1: people say that but it's actually a plot point.

77
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,798
Speaker 1: that's kind of zebra storyteller ition.

78
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,358
Speaker 1: interesting the plot of this show is that sounds like a true bra excuse.

79
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,583
Speaker 1: okay so hear me out.

80
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:11,621
Speaker 1: in the in the nearing future some sort of modern society like today suddenly out of nowhere people start manifesting psychic powers like x-men style.

81
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:16,925
Speaker 1: but imagine if everyone had Jean Grey's powers great automatically the end of the world.

82
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:17,166
Speaker 0: so.

83
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,139
Speaker 1: and the opening montage is horrifying.

84
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:25,102
Speaker 1: like a kid just suddenly everyone around him explodes in piles of blood and yeah ours are just flying everywhere.

85
00:05:25,464 --> 00:05:27,453
Speaker 1: society basically falls apart.

86
00:05:27,634 --> 00:05:29,702
Speaker 0: so it's a lot like what's it called.

87
00:05:30,645 --> 00:05:36,828
Speaker 0: that's the cute town that's actually murderville with the labor unions or whatever it was.

88
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:39,378
Speaker 0: what are you talking about that anime where?

89
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:45,479
Speaker 1: oh oh the one with Colonel Sanders when they cry yeah yeah as a million sequels.

90
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,089
Speaker 1: I kind of liked that show and I show one episode.

91
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:53,002
Speaker 1: I was about to say that shows relevant to our topic today's indeed.

92
00:05:54,046 --> 00:05:56,317
Speaker 1: so you made me lose my train of thought there.

93
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:56,478
Speaker 1: right.

94
00:05:56,498 --> 00:05:58,048
Speaker 1: so since I got yours so this happens.

95
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:10,328
Speaker 1: you just get like this sort of montage of this happening and then the show just starts with a bunch of kids in elementary school into what looks like old Japan but with a few anachronistic modern technologies laying about.

96
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:15,663
Speaker 1: so it's a prequel to Adventure Time and it's weird and you're not really sure what's going on.

97
00:06:16,165 --> 00:06:21,166
Speaker 1: and basically the plot is that society Futurama style.

98
00:06:21,186 --> 00:06:29,158
Speaker 1: remember when you see that that montage where he's frozen and like society gets destroyed by aliens castles aliens destroy the castles.

99
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,403
Speaker 1: the same thing happens.

100
00:06:30,444 --> 00:06:53,645
Speaker 1: society kind of rebuilds over time and eventually the society that works is based on this amalgam of old cultures and hypnotism and eugenics and societal structures set up in place to allow humans who had basically have Jean Grey's powers to coexist with each other and not accidentally murder everybody.

101
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:55,772
Speaker 1: okay and it works really well.

102
00:06:56,755 --> 00:07:01,995
Speaker 1: and but at the same time the eugenics is to such a degree because the danger is.

103
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,843
Speaker 0: so let's see this baby up.

104
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,349
Speaker 0: this is dangerous baby kill it.

105
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:07,880
Speaker 1: yeah there's a point where you find out.

106
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:28,748
Speaker 1: you find out from I guess the Ethics Committee that they changed the Constitution or the rules of the society so that the dates before which is legal to abort someone is moved from like a week or two after birth to the age of 17.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:34,832
Speaker 0: and in case they discover somebody's gonna destroy the world by accident they say you know the way I would describe this show.

108
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:43,437
Speaker 1: really is it's a post apocalyptic psychic 1984. all right and it's really good.

109
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,723
Speaker 1: and the reason it's really good.

110
00:07:44,743 --> 00:07:59,635
Speaker 1: I want to compare it to another show we tried to watch and didn't watch called number six because number six started out in kind of the same way in the sense that all right there's some awesome stuff here there's some kind of mystery of space there's all the stuff that I care about.

111
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:02,147
Speaker 1: and then that show just went nowhere.

112
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:05,946
Speaker 1: it had like the worst pacing like it got to a point of all right.

113
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:07,295
Speaker 1: now it's time to move on to the next thing.

114
00:08:07,335 --> 00:08:09,852
Speaker 1: and then it stayed on a thing for so long that I stopped watching.

115
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:11,421
Speaker 0: I noticed this theme a lot in anime.

116
00:08:11,482 --> 00:08:14,292
Speaker 0: number six ergo proxy Raza fon of the.

117
00:08:14,312 --> 00:08:19,694
Speaker 0: you know there is a an evil 1984 society in a dome and something else going on outside the dome.

118
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,975
Speaker 0: big oh big oh has the same thing but it some shows like number six.

119
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:30,259
Speaker 1: as soon as they get outside of the dome the plot just goes nowhere and the end is stupid.

120
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,103
Speaker 1: Emily spoiled it for me.

121
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:32,470
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't watch number six.

122
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,092
Speaker 1: fuck that show.

123
00:08:33,777 --> 00:08:44,968
Speaker 1: so the reason this show is good one is pretty good music - it escalates rapidly and it time skips several times.

124
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,654
Speaker 0: and where's all this porn come in?

125
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:51,961
Speaker 1: okay so one of the aspects of the show is that basically the plot like you don't know what's going on.

126
00:08:52,002 --> 00:09:07,854
Speaker 1: they just keep showing you vignettes from different eras of history like at one point it cuts to some point that looks older than the current time in the show but much newer than the apocalypse and it looks like a traditional Japanese like this is the new Emperor.

127
00:09:07,874 --> 00:09:19,848
Speaker 1: and then the Emperor uses psychic power to float over the crowd and very happily announces that they're that in celebration of the inauguration of his eternal reign the first hundred people to stop clapping will be executed.

128
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:25,873
Speaker 1: and then later you see a flashback of later than that someone assassinating him.

129
00:09:25,953 --> 00:09:36,841
Speaker 1: and it keeps going back and forth current day and these weird sort of flashbacks to things that happened in this society and then eventually the kids who are kind of the focus of the show.

130
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:42,306
Speaker 1: they're like the main characters go on a school trip and they go kind of outside where they're supposed to.

131
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:50,804
Speaker 1: they find a library and they get zebra storyteller because the library is like yeah your society is designed eugenics eugenics eugenics.

132
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,532
Speaker 1: babies get murdered and they're like what.

133
00:09:53,758 --> 00:09:54,884
Speaker 1: and they learn things like.

134
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:56,313
Speaker 1: here's an example I get.

135
00:09:56,353 --> 00:09:57,420
Speaker 1: the show kind of goes really in-depth.

136
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,756
Speaker 1: there's a point at which they skipped over all the porn part.

137
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:00,982
Speaker 1: I'm getting to the porn part.

138
00:10:02,006 --> 00:10:05,057
Speaker 1: so they learn that humans have this sort of.

139
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:06,082
Speaker 0: just tell everyone the whole show.

140
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:07,211
Speaker 0: you've been going on for like 10 minutes.

141
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:09,285
Speaker 1: yeah cuz this is not the spoiler stuff.

142
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,433
Speaker 1: you sort of learned that like.

143
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:14,313
Speaker 1: one of the ways the society works is that humans cannot harm things that look like humans.

144
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:20,305
Speaker 0: mm-hmm that's like embedded deep into the psyche of all except for that kid who just made out everyone explode around.

145
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:21,572
Speaker 1: that was way before.

146
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:23,863
Speaker 1: that was before this new society existed.

147
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,571
Speaker 1: okay that was like modern times.

148
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,122
Speaker 1: it's like today kid in the street get psychic powers.

149
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:40,942
Speaker 1: one of those things is that what is implanted into humans is very sort of specific sexual needs and progression such that they won't get pregnant.

150
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:47,478
Speaker 1: or have you know the urges that might cause them to lash out until they're ready and then they'll sort of immediately pair off and have babies.

151
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:53,037
Speaker 1: and in stressful situations they took genes and brain things from bonobos.

152
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:59,902
Speaker 1: so people will respond to stressful situations with pleasure or sex rather than violence.

153
00:11:00,685 --> 00:11:04,140
Speaker 0: so in other words they created that plot point just to put lots of porn.

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,171
Speaker 1: no they actually don't really show that at all.

155
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:11,359
Speaker 0: then why are all these pictures of the show really sort of perverted looking like all the other anime?

156
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:15,824
Speaker 1: I really don't know because I've seen 14 episodes of the show and that's not there at all.

157
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:18,334
Speaker 1: there is literally nothing like that in the show.

158
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:25,993
Speaker 1: okay there is one point where one of the girls is in a relationship with another one of the girls because that's how the society set up.

159
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:29,634
Speaker 1: they don't want to have babies yet so they're all kind of automatically homosexual.

160
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:30,821
Speaker 1: but the show that's just part of the.

161
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,666
Speaker 1: you know what's going on.

162
00:11:32,249 --> 00:11:36,916
Speaker 1: suddenly the girls like because she knows about the bonobo thing she wants to kiss the other girls.

163
00:11:36,936 --> 00:11:38,282
Speaker 1: she's like wait a minute wait a minute.

164
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,007
Speaker 1: this is just the society.

165
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:52,896
Speaker 1: psychic bullshit 1984. and these kids are all sort of zebra storytellers and the ethics committees and everything are watching them and it's just like 1984 but they have psychic powers.

166
00:11:53,197 --> 00:11:54,844
Speaker 1: yeah everyone has psychic powers.

167
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,430
Speaker 0: yes it's like a battle time.

168
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:58,640
Speaker 1: they can't battle each other.

169
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:04,827
Speaker 1: because of that thing where you can't hurt other humans physically prevented from doing so you basically die.

170
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:08,702
Speaker 1: if you try to do it the show is really really good.

171
00:12:08,722 --> 00:12:10,029
Speaker 0: I'll just knock this building down.

172
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:10,934
Speaker 0: I was hurting the building.

173
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,207
Speaker 1: that's also very difficult to do that.

174
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:16,789
Speaker 1: I mean I'm trying to skip stuff because you wanted me to not talk about the show too much.

175
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:19,243
Speaker 1: anyway I'll put it this way the show is really well done.

176
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,368
Speaker 0: no reason to watch the show now.

177
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,209
Speaker 1: really well animated escalates very rapidly every time.

178
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:27,660
Speaker 1: I think alright now the show is gonna get boring.

179
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:35,474
Speaker 1: it immediately skips to the next plot point burning wheel style and every time you think well why don't the characters just do act?

180
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:36,962
Speaker 1: yeah they do pretty much immediately.

181
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:41,803
Speaker 1: they're smarter than you or at least as smart as you and I really like this show.

182
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,982
Speaker 1: I think it's the best anime I'm watching currently or know about.

183
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:47,614
Speaker 1: that is on recently that I haven't seen yet man.

184
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:51,854
Speaker 1: so I'll probably finish it soon and whenever Scott watches it will do a kind of full review.

185
00:12:51,974 --> 00:12:56,836
Speaker 0: but it's super good on your porn if you need any anime to watch right now.

186
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,001
Speaker 1: watch since that guy you're.

187
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,270
Speaker 1: it's all on crunchyroll alright.

188
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,702
Speaker 0: so we've been talking about this for a thousand years.

189
00:13:03,722 --> 00:13:05,847
Speaker 0: the Monaco is out today.

190
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:18,931
Speaker 0: yes I've been playing it for about a two keys already one in the newsletter that you subscribe to and one on Google Plus on our Google Plus page which you should you know look at.

191
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:23,868
Speaker 0: so you know hey benefits for following us in all the places.

192
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,677
Speaker 0: yep Monaco is the best.

193
00:13:26,898 --> 00:13:28,464
Speaker 1: Monaco is pretty fun.

194
00:13:28,484 --> 00:13:35,589
Speaker 0: if you play video games and you have a computer you should be playing this video game seriously.

195
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:41,490
Speaker 0: how often do we say this video game is the game to play doesn't even begin with N?

196
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:52,289
Speaker 1: the way I would sell it to you is it's a stealth cooperative competitive game but unlike most stealth games like mark of the ninja where oh I got seen start over.

197
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:52,811
Speaker 1: fuck this.

198
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,340
Speaker 1: when you get seen it's oh shit.

199
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,837
Speaker 1: and that's when you start bombing everything and running away.

200
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,079
Speaker 1: and it's.

201
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,607
Speaker 1: it's just like a heist movie.

202
00:13:59,668 --> 00:14:00,573
Speaker 0: it's a party game.

203
00:14:00,693 --> 00:14:01,317
Speaker 1: it's a party game.

204
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:05,276
Speaker 0: heist movie with it might be it might be the ultimate party game.

205
00:14:05,296 --> 00:14:07,327
Speaker 0: that's actually not just something like Tetris.

206
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:14,686
Speaker 1: well the ultimate party game is still a wario where on the game I'm just saying this is there's no better might be like the skill based party game.

207
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,317
Speaker 0: it's pretty great just never really existed before.

208
00:14:17,337 --> 00:14:18,504
Speaker 1: I'm digging it.

209
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:20,060
Speaker 1: and our review of early be on Tuesday.

210
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,682
Speaker 0: yep yep all right all right.

211
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,228
Speaker 1: so things of the day.

212
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:39,593
Speaker 1: if you guys haven't noticed I'm a pretty big fan of adventure time and had the same progression that ponies had that.

213
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:46,608
Speaker 1: a lot of things I've seen recently had even venture brothers where I watch the first like couple episodes of something I'm like oh this is okay.

214
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:47,332
Speaker 1: I know why.

215
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,805
Speaker 1: I understand why people like it now but I'm not that into it.

216
00:14:50,368 --> 00:14:58,323
Speaker 1: and then a few more episodes later just one of my favorite things ever adventure time pretty much followed that exact same progression.

217
00:14:58,343 --> 00:15:04,986
Speaker 1: I watch every episode like the day it comes out on some ultra like bootleg cam cap bullshit.

218
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:06,270
Speaker 1: okay it's great.

219
00:15:07,092 --> 00:15:09,339
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is just a pretty good.

220
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:10,864
Speaker 1: what time is it?

221
00:15:11,366 --> 00:15:13,512
Speaker 1: musical mashup from adventure time.

222
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:22,946
Speaker 1: that reminds me very much of this cool guy who did similar mashups of for example the old Alice in Wonderland cartoon pogo.

223
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,950
Speaker 0: yeah yeah the guy who can't come in the US because he fucked up his visa pogo is pretty cool.

224
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:34,549
Speaker 1: this is reminiscent of his style and it's also if you haven't seen adventure time it gives you a nice sampling of what the deal is with adventure time.

225
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,251
Speaker 0: alright.

226
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,280
Speaker 0: so my thing of the day.

227
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:43,143
Speaker 0: this guy works at Publix which is a pretty good grocery store not as good as Wegmans but it's down in Florida.

228
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,918
Speaker 0: Publix has a secret if you've never been to one.

229
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:55,947
Speaker 0: if you live down south where they have these stores you can actually go to the deli counter where they have the meats and the cheeses and get peanut butter that they make in the store from peanuts.

230
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:57,615
Speaker 0: fresh is the best peanut butter.

231
00:15:58,097 --> 00:16:00,067
Speaker 1: like the grocery store right here has that too.

232
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:02,622
Speaker 1: which grocery store the food cellar like right there?

233
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:03,829
Speaker 0: that's a fancy grocery store.

234
00:16:03,849 --> 00:16:05,881
Speaker 0: yeah this would be like if stop and shop had that shit.

235
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:11,565
Speaker 0: this is like you know if you went to you know fine fair and they had some Trader Joe's shit up.

236
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:12,690
Speaker 0: it's like whoa.

237
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,555
Speaker 0: what is this doing here?

238
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:15,308
Speaker 0: cuz Publix is like a normal grocery store.

239
00:16:15,328 --> 00:16:19,416
Speaker 0: it's like a stop and shop but it's like they got some pretty good stuff there that you wouldn't expect to be you know.

240
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,687
Speaker 0: so anyway this guy works in a Publix.

241
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:29,348
Speaker 0: he looks like maybe a high school kid or whatever I can't even tell and he's cutting up a watermelon cuz you know what they do is they have an ugly watermelon.

242
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:30,675
Speaker 0: it's not gonna sell you know.

243
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:34,818
Speaker 0: so they cut it up and they will sell slices in a plastic package or they'll sell.

244
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:38,277
Speaker 0: they'll put up a bunch of chunks into like a little plastic cup and sell that.

245
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:39,503
Speaker 0: you know grocery stores do.

246
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,192
Speaker 0: she's cutting up a watermelon.

247
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,408
Speaker 0: this dude can cut the whole watermelon in 30 seconds or less.

248
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:45,232
Speaker 0: it is crazy.

249
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:46,659
Speaker 0: his watermelon cutting skills.

250
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:49,553
Speaker 0: you got to invite him to your you know 4th of July party.

251
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:58,889
Speaker 1: it goes to show if your job if you have a job that makes you do one thing that's boring and mechanical repeatedly you will get good at it.

252
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,370
Speaker 0: I always have a lot of respect for people with those menial jobs where they get.

253
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,109
Speaker 0: you know incredible dexterity and you know reflex skills got to this day.

254
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,367
Speaker 1: you should see me or Alex make a fucking submarine sandwich after working.

255
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,523
Speaker 0: right but it's like see how many videos are things of the day.

256
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:20,413
Speaker 0: we're like guy really good at ironing or guy really good at making pancake or guy really good at doing his little ice cream trick where he gives you ice cream and then takes it back.

257
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:32,168
Speaker 0: you know all that kind of stuff I kind of actually you know think one day maybe I'm an old man or when computers program themselves I'll get a job like that and master some meaningless skill for awesomeness.

258
00:17:32,188 --> 00:17:33,453
Speaker 0: you know I kind of want to do that.

259
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:34,316
Speaker 1: book club.

260
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:38,372
Speaker 1: book is player of games by you know banks.

261
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,537
Speaker 1: we'll do it soon.

262
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:40,603
Speaker 1: it's biking seasons.

263
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:41,447
Speaker 0: only next month.

264
00:17:41,608 --> 00:17:46,412
Speaker 1: I don't read as much as I do in normally in biking season because I primarily read on the subway.

265
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,183
Speaker 1: we got internet stuff.

266
00:17:49,203 --> 00:17:50,248
Speaker 1: we're gonna be an anime Boston.

267
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,493
Speaker 1: we're gonna be at PAX Australia.

268
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:52,376
Speaker 1: we're gonna be a pecs prime.

269
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:53,220
Speaker 1: we might be a pecs dev.

270
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:56,934
Speaker 1: yeah we're gonna be at all those things.

271
00:17:57,556 --> 00:17:58,480
Speaker 1: it's gonna be awesome.

272
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,166
Speaker 1: check out our youtubes.

273
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:06,004
Speaker 1: and rave master was a pretty shitty show I don't know.

274
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:08,132
Speaker 1: I know you watch way more of it than I did.

275
00:18:08,574 --> 00:18:11,769
Speaker 0: I watch like five six seven episodes something like that.

276
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:12,937
Speaker 0: I thought it was long ago.

277
00:18:12,957 --> 00:18:13,360
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

278
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:18,728
Speaker 1: we were trying to think about a show vaguely around the idea of anime we won't watch or didn't watch.

279
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:21,766
Speaker 0: but I started watching and didn't finish watch because I thought way back.

280
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:23,475
Speaker 1: someone put together a pretty good list.

281
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:33,259
Speaker 1: it was like the hundred best anime of all time and I remember looking at the list realizing I had watched like 97 of them most and I knew what the other three were.

282
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:41,977
Speaker 0: I knew I knew what every single thing on the list was and I had seen the overwhelming plurality of them and I realized I've seen a lot of goddamn anime.

283
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:56,480
Speaker 1: but yet there is a large list of anime that I have specifically despite knowing it exists chosen not to watch it and I'm talking about stuff that I barely know exists like I don't know crappy new moe show that is obviously just incest.

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,120
Speaker 0: yeah like I know there's a show called Canon but do I really need to tell you why I haven't watched it?

285
00:19:01,602 --> 00:19:06,543
Speaker 1: yeah I watched one episode of that Tokimeki anime and it was awful.

286
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:07,908
Speaker 0: there's the Tokimeki anime.

287
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:11,892
Speaker 1: I got it because the kill the guy who did those Sailor Moon subs and the end of Eva subs.

288
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:15,144
Speaker 1: back in the day that I got he also randomly subbed that.

289
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:21,919
Speaker 0: yeah let's start by talking about anime that we started watching but didn't finish and then we'll move on from there rave master.

290
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:24,592
Speaker 0: so rave master I watched five six episodes.

291
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:33,477
Speaker 1: I watched two episodes and I remember thinking it was just dumb and I actually stopped watching current anime after that because that was the popular show everyone was watching.

292
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:35,973
Speaker 1: I was you know it wasn't that popular in the anime club at the time.

293
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:37,562
Speaker 1: it was yeah was?

294
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:40,664
Speaker 1: we showed in the anime club but then people were all talking about it and watching it like.

295
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:45,950
Speaker 1: I don't remember that was the show all the normal people in the club would talk about before club for like.

296
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,539
Speaker 0: well I don't remember that.

297
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,213
Speaker 0: I watched just a few episodes because it was the new show.

298
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,082
Speaker 0: it had bright colors the.

299
00:19:52,222 --> 00:20:00,411
Speaker 0: it was a basically an adventure show where the guy had a big sword and a pet and the pet was really cute and there was some sort of mysterious fantasy adventure that I want to know the secret of.

300
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:08,200
Speaker 0: but what ended up happening was after five six episodes I realized wait a minute and I rewinded and I looked.

301
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,455
Speaker 0: they spent like four or five episodes in a row like a whole bunch of them.

302
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:14,203
Speaker 0: they were in one room.

303
00:20:14,906 --> 00:20:17,359
Speaker 0: all the characters are in that room not leaving the room.

304
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:29,352
Speaker 0: it was like some throne room or something or something right and just this one battle that was even slower than Naruto battle and I was like wow nothing has happened in these past few episodes.

305
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:32,023
Speaker 0: it is still the same battle not watching anymore.

306
00:20:32,284 --> 00:20:36,220
Speaker 0: yep the same thing happened to me with Naruto.

307
00:20:36,381 --> 00:20:37,103
Speaker 1: oh my god we've.

308
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:39,111
Speaker 1: I remember Naruto like the people who are.

309
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:43,975
Speaker 1: why cuz you know we were running the anime club so we didn't have as much time to watch anime.

310
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:49,942
Speaker 1: a few of the harder core people in the club watched Naruto before us and we're raving about.

311
00:20:50,043 --> 00:20:53,963
Speaker 0: everyone is raving about Naruto and it was this was Naruto was brand new the newest.

312
00:20:54,124 --> 00:20:56,114
Speaker 1: so we were like all right it's funny ninja school.

313
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,320
Speaker 1: let's show it to the club.

314
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:00,317
Speaker 0: I had never I had never seen it and but everyone was talking it up.

315
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:01,605
Speaker 0: so I said I'll get to it someday.

316
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:09,284
Speaker 0: so we showed it at clubs and I watched those four episodes and I said that is hysterical that ninja school with the sexy nojitsu this is.

317
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:10,549
Speaker 0: everyone was totally right.

318
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,212
Speaker 0: the show is awesome.

319
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:12,859
Speaker 1: that show was awesome.

320
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,295
Speaker 0: and then I recall so I went home and I kept watching Naruto.

321
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:18,225
Speaker 0: yeah but I recall it was so awesome.

322
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:20,294
Speaker 1: where actually two moments ruin the show from.

323
00:21:20,335 --> 00:21:22,062
Speaker 0: I got episode 13.

324
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:32,619
Speaker 1: the moment that ruined it for me was there was this whole build-up in this big fight that I didn't notice yet was just a Dragon Ball fight and sudden fine the whole thing was how did Naruto do that like how did he win?

325
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,223
Speaker 1: I don't know.

326
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:37,065
Speaker 1: everyone's trying to figure out how he won and then it was just some proper noun bullshit.

327
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:39,278
Speaker 1: he just used a special technique and I was like wait a minute.

328
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:40,163
Speaker 1: how long did that fight?

329
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:41,270
Speaker 1: wait a minute.

330
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,636
Speaker 1: this is Dragon Ball.

331
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:58,530
Speaker 0: I got to episode 13. they were basically in this fight against like magic crystal mirror girl and big sword guy and it was you know Naruto and the girl and Sasuke I remember the girl's name anymore right and they're fighting against magic mirror crystal girl and big sword guy.

332
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,419
Speaker 0: it's like the first big fight of the show.

333
00:22:00,439 --> 00:22:10,288
Speaker 0: and first of all I'm already upset because funny ninja school is gone right yep and the best character the teacher guy is not there and I'm like what the fuck where is the awesome teacher?

334
00:22:10,349 --> 00:22:11,474
Speaker 0: I want him in every episode.

335
00:22:11,494 --> 00:22:18,654
Speaker 0: he should be the main character and that fight finally ends like episode 13 and I said wait a minute rave master.

336
00:22:19,356 --> 00:22:24,134
Speaker 0: this fight has been going on since like episode 7 now watching any more Naruto's.

337
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:29,998
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to belabor the point on fighting shows but suffice it to say there's a problem.

338
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:40,380
Speaker 1: we had in those days where we were mostly watching really old anime from the library and the current popular show and every time it was a shonen fighting show.

339
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,054
Speaker 1: the first couple episodes of those shows are usually awesome because they usually have really cool iconic characters.

340
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:49,369
Speaker 0: yeah bleach yeah bleach bleach is the worst of them all.

341
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,904
Speaker 0: cuz after episode one I knew and I was done with it.

342
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:54,149
Speaker 0: yeah I was like episode one.

343
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,005
Speaker 0: all right this is a little bit like Yu Yu Hakusho kind of.

344
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,291
Speaker 1: yeah Yu Yu Hakusho episode.

345
00:22:58,392 --> 00:22:58,954
Speaker 1: one same thing.

346
00:22:58,994 --> 00:22:59,857
Speaker 1: I thought it was great.

347
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:00,900
Speaker 0: then episode two.

348
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:06,600
Speaker 0: wait a minute I'm catching on now you're not fooling me till episode 13 again.

349
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,310
Speaker 1: so I think the worst of all of those it's because it's so bad it warrants a special mention.

350
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:20,989
Speaker 1: because this show we I watched four episodes of yeah partly because we showed it in club and I was the one who had to stick around to lock the door.

351
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,655
Speaker 1: Final Fantasy unlimited.

352
00:23:25,357 --> 00:23:26,800
Speaker 0: I did not watch that.

353
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,208
Speaker 1: that might be the worst show.

354
00:23:30,228 --> 00:23:37,414
Speaker 1: I say show because there's special things like gray the digital target that I had ever seen up to that scene.

355
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:49,216
Speaker 1: okay it was unbearable and had nothing to do with Final Fantasy except it happened to have a chocobo and this is before a lot of the final thing wasn't there.

356
00:23:49,256 --> 00:23:51,024
Speaker 0: that other Final Fantasy anime?

357
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:54,861
Speaker 0: yes it is older it is worse worse Christiana whatever?

358
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,472
Speaker 1: yeah yeah that's worse and I chose not to watch it.

359
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:57,895
Speaker 0: never see.

360
00:23:57,916 --> 00:24:01,299
Speaker 0: I remember that tape was always in the library and that would be one of the tape was always in blows.

361
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,231
Speaker 0: one of the tape see but always point you and go.

362
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:05,601
Speaker 1: wow the worst that was a show.

363
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:06,766
Speaker 0: I didn't watch that either.

364
00:24:07,088 --> 00:24:14,600
Speaker 1: I'd go I'd look at blockbuster and I'd see that and I'd see like Armageddon and I'd be like I'm gonna watch Armageddon anyway.

365
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:18,034
Speaker 0: so another just to finish off the fighting show list.

366
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:18,819
Speaker 0: right one piece.

367
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,064
Speaker 0: I will actually watch the one piece anime for episodes and I liked all of them and I wanted to keep watching.

368
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:31,038
Speaker 0: but I switched over to the manga and I got to fighting the swordfish man and that lasted multiple volumes of manga.

369
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:32,945
Speaker 0: so I stopped buying new volumes.

370
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:41,411
Speaker 0: but then it the final volume showed up because I pre-ordered and that volume they beat the fish man and the plot moved crazy fast and I was like oh my god this is why one piece is awesome.

371
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:42,818
Speaker 0: why can't every volume be like this?

372
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:46,917
Speaker 0: but then I still held fast and did not order any more volumes.

373
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:48,265
Speaker 1: yep these are just showing.

374
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,090
Speaker 0: that is a good thing.

375
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,867
Speaker 0: otherwise I would need the whole bookshelf just through the one piece.

376
00:24:51,967 --> 00:25:01,338
Speaker 1: I don't know if I will ever be at a point in my life where I can deal with the shonen fighting formula of fights go on forever and the show also goes on forever no matter how good the character.

377
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:04,975
Speaker 0: watched all of Hokuto no Ken and now I feel as if I'm done.

378
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:11,101
Speaker 0: I feel like and if I need that again I'll watch Hokuto no Ken again for whatever reason.

379
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:20,114
Speaker 1: well like we've talked about this before Hokuto no Ken despite having many of the same issues feel because it invented the issue exactly.

380
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:23,589
Speaker 1: but it also feels faster like if I watched ten episodes.

381
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:27,008
Speaker 0: yeah because when he punches someone in the head they die immediately.

382
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:30,750
Speaker 0: none of this ten episode per fight it's just a different fight every fucking episode.

383
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,298
Speaker 1: there might be several episodes of.

384
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,067
Speaker 1: I'm going to do this thing.

385
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:44,317
Speaker 0: even the climactic fights like against row and shit are like two episodes the same as the initial D. a race doesn't last more than two episodes in initial D but one piece I just couldn't deal with.

386
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,466
Speaker 1: yeah I think it might have be the one.

387
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:56,463
Speaker 1: how long the show is like initial D. even when I was watching it I recognized the formula that was going on but I knew it was 26 episodes.

388
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:57,185
Speaker 0: but it's not.

389
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:08,356
Speaker 1: it was at the time one piece I knew from the beginning was gonna be even longer than freakin anything all right.

390
00:26:08,758 --> 00:26:11,110
Speaker 0: so other anime started watching did not finish.

391
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:15,552
Speaker 1: interesting though I watched all of Sailor Moon that's 200 episodes so whatever.

392
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:18,566
Speaker 1: so let's get into something different not a fighting show.

393
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:21,038
Speaker 1: ergo proxy was the show that I liked.

394
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:22,586
Speaker 0: I kind of liked it was good.

395
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,289
Speaker 0: it wasn't the best.

396
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:29,948
Speaker 0: it was a show that when I was wondering what the terrible secret of space was started out kind of boring and then really quickly got really good.

397
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,377
Speaker 0: I actually thought the first episode is more exciting because all the cool sci-fi stuff in the city.

398
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:46,700
Speaker 1: I thought the first episode was less exciting because it seemed so like it was trying so hard to be dark and gritty and it wasn't the best cool sci-fi city cyberpunk.

399
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,423
Speaker 0: but it was okay.

400
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,070
Speaker 0: but basically outside the city.

401
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,655
Speaker 0: it was like oh I don't care about these people outside the city I just want to see you try to get back in.

402
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:53,759
Speaker 1: well the show.

403
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,080
Speaker 1: I was like.

404
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,642
Speaker 1: I liked it.

405
00:26:55,225 --> 00:27:00,735
Speaker 1: and then just when I started to get bored they were like we're getting out of the city with the girl in the rabbit costume.

406
00:27:01,237 --> 00:27:08,796
Speaker 1: then I was like oh this is awesome and then it got boring again and it just started to pick up and then we were just busy and kind of stopped watching it.

407
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:18,675
Speaker 1: cuz I think we were Netflix net at the time and I didn't like it so much that I like fought to go back and see it again so that eventually we kind of like it was a show that we liked but we kind of forgot we were watching.

408
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,161
Speaker 1: yeah because there was a gap.

409
00:27:20,201 --> 00:27:24,707
Speaker 1: like if there hadn't been that gap I think it was like we went to two conventions or something.

410
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:25,452
Speaker 1: we didn't have time.

411
00:27:25,814 --> 00:27:30,701
Speaker 1: we probably would have finished the show but as soon as we forgot we were watching it we've never stopped.

412
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:31,929
Speaker 1: we never watched any more of it.

413
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:33,921
Speaker 0: Kazu no Yojimbo is similar right.

414
00:27:33,942 --> 00:27:37,017
Speaker 0: it's like we watched a little bit of anime club back in the day or something I

415
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,382
Speaker 1: tried to watch a

416
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:45,782
Speaker 0: watching it for Netflix and it's like it wasn't the best show but it wasn't bad and I was kind of curious what the D of mystery was in the town.

417
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:48,921
Speaker 1: yeah it also had really good moments like where the guy'd go out.

418
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:49,887
Speaker 1: then there's the gunshot.

419
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:50,893
Speaker 1: he's like who fired that.

420
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:51,738
Speaker 1: what's going on?

421
00:27:51,758 --> 00:28:02,190
Speaker 0: yep so it's just we just kept watching it sort of you know rolling with it just seeing what's up and then something interrupted them because it wasn't so good that we were desperate and wanted to seek again.

422
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,743
Speaker 0: we wasn't good enough for us to put an effort to see more.

423
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:10,584
Speaker 0: so any interruption in the habit of watching it basically ended watching it.

424
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:21,920
Speaker 1: so years later when I was commuting every day on the train to Yonkers from Beacon I had a little DVD thing and I was like you know what I'm gonna start why I need some anime I can watch going to and from work on the train.

425
00:28:22,522 --> 00:28:25,798
Speaker 1: so I got I was like oh yeah Kazu no Yojimbo I remember kind of liking that.

426
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,833
Speaker 1: so I started watching it and I got to about the point.

427
00:28:28,914 --> 00:28:34,477
Speaker 1: Scott and I had watched it before and I suddenly realized it was a chore like.

428
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:35,019
Speaker 1: I liked it.

429
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:39,682
Speaker 1: okay but an episode would end and I'd be like well guess I should watch the next one like I got.

430
00:28:39,722 --> 00:28:45,470
Speaker 0: if I gotta get it's not like that time when I put Evangelion on my phone and was like can't stop oh my god.

431
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:53,226
Speaker 1: there was one time one of our friends was on my phone one of the FRC you know Scott and I moved back into our apartment at RIT mm-hmm like we're.

432
00:28:53,306 --> 00:28:57,050
Speaker 1: I forget if we move back in or if we just been there and then someone returned.

433
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:59,422
Speaker 1: cuz I figure we hear the turn cowboy bebop on.

434
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:03,661
Speaker 1: yeah we just like marathoning it to an unnamed member of the FRC.

435
00:29:03,782 --> 00:29:06,755
Speaker 1: we were like what you've never seen cowboy bebop what the fuck.

436
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:13,343
Speaker 1: well here we'll show you a couple episodes and then whatever and then the three of us marathon the entire show.

437
00:29:13,363 --> 00:29:15,552
Speaker 1: at that moment I watched episode one.

438
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,862
Speaker 1: I was like oh right the show is the best.

439
00:29:18,666 --> 00:29:21,618
Speaker 1: so I was watching cos the new yojimbo kind of forcing my way through it.

440
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,904
Speaker 1: it was okay.

441
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:31,086
Speaker 1: but then I watched one episode of eska flown and I was like oh my god that's what it feels like to really want to watch the next episode of a show.

442
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:31,568
Speaker 1: that's right.

443
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:38,356
Speaker 1: and then I decided right then and there I will never again watch another episode of any show that I don't feel.

444
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:42,750
Speaker 1: hmm as soon as I detect that it is they chore a slog.

445
00:29:42,951 --> 00:29:52,845
Speaker 1: perhaps I'm bailing and going home and I'm watching Ava or eska cowboy bebop Gundam seed yeah ghost in the shell all right.

446
00:29:53,427 --> 00:30:03,123
Speaker 0: are there any other shows you started watching and did not well pleat watching we so Scott and Emily both had never really seen slayers a while ago.

447
00:30:03,183 --> 00:30:05,996
Speaker 1: so we started watching it bit by bit because I've seen most of slayers.

448
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:09,591
Speaker 1: yeah this is before revolution or any of this stuff.

449
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:15,716
Speaker 1: so we you know I got a dvds a bard and we started watching regular slayers again and super fun.

450
00:30:15,736 --> 00:30:19,188
Speaker 1: and we watch next and we just haven't started.

451
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,273
Speaker 1: try yet.

452
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:21,743
Speaker 0: well that's not sweet haven't started it.

453
00:30:21,804 --> 00:30:23,536
Speaker 0: so it doesn't really fit the start of it.

454
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:24,241
Speaker 1: you've never seen it.

455
00:30:24,261 --> 00:30:25,288
Speaker 1: you could watch it at any time.

456
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,613
Speaker 1: it's sitting right there I will.

457
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:28,199
Speaker 0: I want to.

458
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,182
Speaker 0: yeah it's good.

459
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:32,295
Speaker 0: I did watch the first episode of slayers revolution.

460
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:33,160
Speaker 0: that doesn't really go.

461
00:30:33,482 --> 00:30:33,965
Speaker 0: there's a lot of.

462
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:36,946
Speaker 0: have the animes that I've watched one episode of but I don't think those count.

463
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:38,012
Speaker 0: I think it's more animes.

464
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:40,081
Speaker 0: you watched a few episodes of right for example.

465
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:47,516
Speaker 1: I think the killer is the show that you watch most of and that like if you got more than halfway through and then you stop.

466
00:30:47,536 --> 00:30:49,405
Speaker 0: yeah so check this out right over the winner.

467
00:30:49,485 --> 00:30:50,992
Speaker 0: I got my bike in place thing.

468
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:56,519
Speaker 0: I was watching space runaway eating on while biking in place right I remember that shows name.

469
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:08,243
Speaker 0: originally I had watched like five episodes and stopped and then I got this time while biking in place in my apartment I watched seventy to eighty percent of that show before stopping.

470
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:12,316
Speaker 0: wow and it's not that it really changed.

471
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:14,604
Speaker 0: it got bad or was a slog.

472
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,611
Speaker 0: it was you know it was just sort of.

473
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:21,007
Speaker 0: so nothing in is a terrible secret I want to learn to.

474
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:29,607
Speaker 0: but the thing is most of the episodes it's pretty much every episode has a space battle no matter what right even though it's a different space battle each episode.

475
00:31:29,628 --> 00:31:32,487
Speaker 0: so it's sort of like I really just want to fast forward through that battle.

476
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:33,211
Speaker 0: see who wins it.

477
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:42,409
Speaker 0: it's just like okay you're flying around and shooting each other in spaceships again and the robot okay and yep and that takes up a lot of time.

478
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,702
Speaker 0: some of the episodes it'll take up like half the episode.

479
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:47,336
Speaker 1: you know Wolf's Rain which is people have talking about again.

480
00:31:47,437 --> 00:31:47,920
Speaker 0: another one.

481
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,575
Speaker 1: I started I got more than halfway through it.

482
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:53,209
Speaker 1: I got ten episodes maybe and then I got bored with it.

483
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,014
Speaker 1: I never saw the end.

484
00:31:54,095 --> 00:31:57,836
Speaker 0: I got it when I got it when the party was together and running through the snowy place.

485
00:31:58,118 --> 00:31:59,384
Speaker 1: yep but there's a part.

486
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:04,004
Speaker 1: I literally I was just like I didn't care anymore like I couldn't see where the show was going.

487
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:12,080
Speaker 1: yep but I got more than halfway through at least with a speedgrapher four episodes in I was like fuck this yeah as soon as he got weird.

488
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,807
Speaker 1: no I like weird.

489
00:32:14,068 --> 00:32:15,975
Speaker 1: it just it was weird that I didn't care about.

490
00:32:15,996 --> 00:32:24,767
Speaker 1: yep I mean and it was slow but not in a good way like gassaraki is slow but I like that kind of slow.

491
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:28,205
Speaker 1: yep I like that kind of slow a lot way more than a lot of other people do.

492
00:32:28,326 --> 00:32:33,044
Speaker 0: but you don't like the galaxy train kind of slow night on the galactic railroad.

493
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,977
Speaker 1: yeah no I don't enjoy that movie don't enjoy it at all.

494
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:41,111
Speaker 1: but slow space other kinds of shows that do like.

495
00:32:41,191 --> 00:32:45,925
Speaker 1: yeah but speedgrapher was just like.

496
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:56,707
Speaker 1: it's the kind of show where I if I can't project any good direction like any angle for the show like Ava watching it I projected immediately there's all these angles that could have like.

497
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:00,348
Speaker 1: maybe it's gonna be about gods maybe it's gonna be about transhumanism.

498
00:33:00,368 --> 00:33:09,086
Speaker 1: but I can project or predict angles that are gonna be awesome but like Wolf's reign I couldn't come up with any possible way for it to have a satisfying ending.

499
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:11,761
Speaker 1: hmm and the same thing with speedgrapher.

500
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:18,875
Speaker 1: I was like there is nothing the show could be about that would actually satisfy me at the end and explain this bullshit that I just watched.

501
00:33:19,056 --> 00:33:23,359
Speaker 0: right I got two other shows that I can think of on the top of my head that fit this category.

502
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:26,073
Speaker 0: all right one is the or on high school host club.

503
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:27,861
Speaker 1: I really like that show.

504
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:31,477
Speaker 0: actually watch like four episodes and it was funny and it was good.

505
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:36,802
Speaker 0: but by the fourth episode it was sort of like it's the same joke all this sort of same.

506
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:39,033
Speaker 0: you know jokes that you had in the other episode.

507
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:42,731
Speaker 0: you know these sort of gendery jokes and things like that and you know what.

508
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:49,736
Speaker 0: I've heard those jokes before and I don't really feel a strong desire to see the next episode because I'm not laughing at these jokes that hard.

509
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:58,603
Speaker 0: so I actually did want to keep watching.

510
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,038
Speaker 1: I watched two episodes of that and I marathon the whole thing with Emily.

511
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,133
Speaker 0: I want to know the terrible secret but I did terrible see.

512
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,404
Speaker 1: that show is great.

513
00:34:07,544 --> 00:34:08,830
Speaker 0: I know most of the terrible secrets.

514
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:10,496
Speaker 0: actually at least I'm pretty close.

515
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:17,188
Speaker 1: yeah I know you don't and then I'll put it this way who do you think is the terrible secret like?

516
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,193
Speaker 1: what do you think it revolves around?

517
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:18,676
Speaker 0: well is it?

518
00:34:18,978 --> 00:34:21,089
Speaker 0: isn't the idea that Hari is looking for aliens?

519
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:22,375
Speaker 0: she believes all this crazy shit.

520
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,123
Speaker 0: yeah and so.

521
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:31,920
Speaker 0: and then she's with all these people think she's crazy but they're all in the same club but actually all of them are the aliens all the time except maybe the guy.

522
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:34,609
Speaker 0: okay and then I don't know.

523
00:34:34,869 --> 00:34:38,525
Speaker 1: okay there is a significant something about time travel.

524
00:34:38,545 --> 00:34:39,911
Speaker 0: that's why the episodes are all mixed up.

525
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,688
Speaker 1: you have not even conceived of what the show is actually about.

526
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:44,889
Speaker 1: yet.

527
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,996
Speaker 1: okay show is gonna do a thing.

528
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:51,958
Speaker 0: you're gonna be like oh all right all right at a point anyway but yeah that's you know.

529
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,324
Speaker 0: sometimes that just happens.

530
00:34:53,906 --> 00:35:07,520
Speaker 1: so there's some shows that are big popular well-known or at least in their time we're super well-known that despite being the biggest goddamn anime fans not only did we never watch them or at least I never watched them.

531
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:19,653
Speaker 1: but in that era in the 2000s if I was an anime con and I was like I've never seen the - Co people be like what the fuck rim what the fuck actually I did watch a few episodes in - Co and not finish.

532
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:20,917
Speaker 1: I didn't watch any.

533
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:23,566
Speaker 1: I I never cared about a - Co.

534
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:36,520
Speaker 1: everyone who ever tried to tell me to watch it told me it was about something different never told me it was about something good and the fact that it is basically completely forgotten except by people

535
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:37,343
Speaker 0: who were big

536
00:35:37,444 --> 00:35:40,476
Speaker 1: into anime and watched it in the two in the 2000s.

537
00:35:41,621 --> 00:35:43,529
Speaker 1: I think I made the right choice and never watching it.

538
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,519
Speaker 0: yeah I didn't finish it and I'm good.

539
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:48,132
Speaker 1: yeah but sir I don't think you guys can understand.

540
00:35:48,172 --> 00:35:50,464
Speaker 1: that was people would say in the - Co.

541
00:35:50,484 --> 00:36:01,520
Speaker 0: it was a pretty big show at the list of the five or ten shows that they assume everyone in the club has seen all of and when the anime club had like giveaways there would be like a - Co wall scroll and people knew what it was.

542
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,551
Speaker 1: it was like right next to the Ava wall scroll.

543
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:04,937
Speaker 1: that's right that level.

544
00:36:05,118 --> 00:36:06,966
Speaker 1: yep and completely forgotten.

545
00:36:07,066 --> 00:36:08,555
Speaker 1: Ava people still argue about it.

546
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,437
Speaker 0: well I don't even remember the last time I heard someone mentioned a - Co before.

547
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:16,186
Speaker 1: right now yeah it came up recently because someone one of our friends was like you've still not seen the - Co.

548
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:19,926
Speaker 1: which is why I was thinking about this and I was like I don't actually ever plan to.

549
00:36:19,946 --> 00:36:21,877
Speaker 1: yeah no one has ever told me it was good.

550
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:23,527
Speaker 0: don't we have the full set right here?

551
00:36:23,588 --> 00:36:24,673
Speaker 1: yes I bought the box set.

552
00:36:24,693 --> 00:36:26,078
Speaker 1: it was like five dollars.

553
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:28,126
Speaker 1: I've never even opened it.

554
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:35,651
Speaker 1: yeah there was another show that was stupidly popular among a good chunk of the anime club.

555
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:39,349
Speaker 0: I remember Weiss Cruz White Cross mmm that's what I was a cute boys show.

556
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,176
Speaker 1: I think I don't know what it's about.

557
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,424
Speaker 0: I never learned it.

558
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:43,645
Speaker 0: st.

559
00:36:43,725 --> 00:36:45,754
Speaker 0: say huh or am I just way off?

560
00:36:46,076 --> 00:36:49,454
Speaker 1: I think it's about flowers people who run a flower shop but are also terrorists.

561
00:36:49,695 --> 00:36:51,504
Speaker 0: isn't that gravitation which I also didn't see?

562
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:53,091
Speaker 1: I watched some of it.

563
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:55,924
Speaker 1: I have beef with gravitation but not in this sense.

564
00:36:56,366 --> 00:36:59,117
Speaker 0: I think I connect them because they're both cute boys shows.

565
00:36:59,178 --> 00:37:00,302
Speaker 1: right White Cross?

566
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:13,893
Speaker 1: the reason I did not watch it was that a ton of people I remember we're going crazy about this show and then I learned that most of them had not ever actually seen a single episode of it.

567
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:23,803
Speaker 1: really so when I learned that I decided that show is probably stupid and in retrospect I was 100%.

568
00:37:23,803 --> 00:37:26,210
Speaker 0: another show no one talks about anymore.

569
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:31,685
Speaker 1: that show is forgotten mm-hmm I remember.

570
00:37:31,765 --> 00:37:34,112
Speaker 1: so the tenchi or what gal gaga?

571
00:37:34,132 --> 00:37:34,836
Speaker 1: I've never watched.

572
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:35,721
Speaker 1: I have no plans to.

573
00:37:35,762 --> 00:37:36,506
Speaker 0: I don't watch that.

574
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:47,105
Speaker 0: simply I think I actually might like gal gaga but everyone says well it doesn't get good until this late episode and it's way too many episodes to sit through that are bad unlike say hoke don't know can which is good every episode.

575
00:37:47,628 --> 00:37:50,282
Speaker 1: thus gal gaga for me is in that same category.

576
00:37:50,342 --> 00:37:52,716
Speaker 1: that not worth the effort of the galactic heroes is.

577
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,532
Speaker 1: is that it is worth the effort when I don't have anything else to do?

578
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:58,102
Speaker 0: when I'm an old man and we're tired I'll watch gaga shows like that.

579
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:03,271
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch when I'm 90 in a retirement home and all my friends are dead.

580
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:07,042
Speaker 0: yep well I'll be the one alive when I'll be the one alive.

581
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:12,360
Speaker 0: okay on this I will watch gaga gaga and be like this.

582
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,536
Speaker 0: one's for you rim but and I'll pour out some digital bits.

583
00:38:16,757 --> 00:38:20,692
Speaker 1: so there was a whole special class of shows that I stopped watching.

584
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:27,457
Speaker 1: that were basically the shitty TV knockoff of what was a good Oh AV reader die TV.

585
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:31,251
Speaker 1: so actually that's the one I watched all the way through that for last.

586
00:38:31,272 --> 00:38:34,260
Speaker 1: so El Hazzard is a great show.

587
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:41,484
Speaker 1: the Wanderers is just a slow-paced poorly done shitty watered-down TV show.

588
00:38:41,684 --> 00:38:44,356
Speaker 0: redo yep I knew better and didn't even try to watch the Wanderers.

589
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:45,522
Speaker 1: I was like five episodes.

590
00:38:45,562 --> 00:38:46,105
Speaker 1: I was like what?

591
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:51,473
Speaker 1: the same with lotus war lotus war oh yeah same thing tenchi muyo.

592
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:55,728
Speaker 1: same thing the original av love or hate that kind of harem show.

593
00:38:55,748 --> 00:38:57,676
Speaker 1: it was an important show in its time.

594
00:38:57,696 --> 00:38:59,684
Speaker 1: I enjoyed that show a lot.

595
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:07,153
Speaker 1: the TV series is is is is that came afterward where each and every one of them increasingly mediocre?

596
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:15,183
Speaker 1: you can tell how mediocre attention episode of anything is by how much later it came out after the first OAV ended.

597
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,172
Speaker 0: that reminds me of similar things.

598
00:39:17,212 --> 00:39:25,936
Speaker 0: for example I watched all of the first season of full metal panic but did not watch any other full metal panics because I sort of regretted finishing watching the first one.

599
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:28,189
Speaker 1: I didn't finish the first one because I knew better.

600
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,636
Speaker 1: I watched that show and I was like all right.

601
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:38,492
Speaker 1: it's got an average to like be level robot plot and a mildly funny school plot and they mash them up and the.

602
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:41,950
Speaker 1: the good part of the show is that they mashed them up and that's like.

603
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,714
Speaker 1: that's the cool part.

604
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:50,569
Speaker 1: then they'd film a food where they just took it's like they took the worst most pedestrian jokes and made the entire show that right.

605
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:56,501
Speaker 0: so similarly I watched all of the Full Metal Alchemist TV series as did I as it came out own all the manga.

606
00:39:56,581 --> 00:40:04,016
Speaker 0: even though I haven't read all of it yet I do plan to have not seen a single second of Brotherhood or any movie I remember.

607
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:07,268
Speaker 1: I was excited that the movie was coming and then it came out.

608
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:11,002
Speaker 0: I didn't watch a second of it not in one and by that point it's funny.

609
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:14,758
Speaker 1: I we were super invested in Full Metal Alchemist.

610
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:18,918
Speaker 0: that like we would all get together to watch a new episode the day it came out.

611
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:20,203
Speaker 1: that was the big show.

612
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:22,111
Speaker 1: I was huge like we went to.

613
00:40:22,311 --> 00:40:29,720
Speaker 1: I remember we were at Otacon and Lark OCL did their crazy concert partly because Full Metal Alchemist and they had.

614
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,805
Speaker 1: they did one of the openers.

615
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:31,508
Speaker 1: yeah.

616
00:40:31,589 --> 00:40:41,057
Speaker 1: so we were there and they showed like the first episode of the show and while we were waiting for the concert to start and even a bunch of her friends were like whoa that's what this show is about.

617
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:41,860
Speaker 1: oh my god.

618
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,917
Speaker 1: and it was the biggest and I thought that show was the best.

619
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:46,760
Speaker 1: it was pretty good.

620
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:53,373
Speaker 1: within a week of it ending I forgot about it didn't care anymore never remembered it have no plans never watch it again.

621
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:58,094
Speaker 1: it was one of those shows that was good in its era and everyone watched it and the no one will remember it.

622
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:06,300
Speaker 1: mm-hmm uh but yeah in the knockoff genre I did actually watch all of read or die TV.

623
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,334
Speaker 1: let me tell you there is no payoff.

624
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:11,582
Speaker 1: that could have been possible.

625
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:12,650
Speaker 1: that would have made that worthwhile.

626
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:15,059
Speaker 1: there was in fact no payoff.

627
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,726
Speaker 0: I watched all of love Hina.

628
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:17,609
Speaker 0: why did I do this?

629
00:41:18,151 --> 00:41:23,915
Speaker 0: because the summer after freshman year at RIT I spent that summer doing being camp counselor.

630
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:25,726
Speaker 0: but then that didn't take the whole summer.

631
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:28,401
Speaker 0: that only takes eight weeks maybe nine weeks because of the training week.

632
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:30,914
Speaker 0: right then I had the rest of the summer to do nothing.

633
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:32,741
Speaker 0: internet was a vt16 modem and mm-hmm.

634
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:35,834
Speaker 1: wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute.

635
00:41:35,934 --> 00:41:45,636
Speaker 0: so the only anime that I had available to me the only thing I had to do was I had all of love Hina which I downloaded at RIT on this hard drive.

636
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:46,684
Speaker 1: let me tell you a little story.

637
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:51,749
Speaker 1: so I'm living in the mountains with no internet working at IBM no friends within hundreds of miles of me.

638
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,926
Speaker 1: yeah just kind of you know being bored and I'm a hard drive.

639
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:58,684
Speaker 1: I happen to have all of gunslinger girls and all of read or die TV.

640
00:41:58,704 --> 00:41:59,970
Speaker 1: so guess what I watched all of.

641
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:06,217
Speaker 0: ah yeah someone who's trapped with nothing no way to get more things is gonna watch something crappy.

642
00:42:06,498 --> 00:42:07,664
Speaker 1: fuck both of those shows.

643
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:09,252
Speaker 0: fuck all three of those shows.

644
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:09,714
Speaker 0: love Hina.

645
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,924
Speaker 0: also love Hina has cute turtles and that's it.

646
00:42:12,547 --> 00:42:22,567
Speaker 1: but I remember like when when they announced tenchi in Tokyo I was actually excited because I wanted to see the kind of mainline plot of tenchi go forward.

647
00:42:22,928 --> 00:42:24,234
Speaker 1: it looked like it was gonna be cool.

648
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:28,454
Speaker 1: I watched the first episode and I never watched any more tenchi after that.

649
00:42:28,494 --> 00:42:29,822
Speaker 1: I haven't seen any tenji since then.

650
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:31,972
Speaker 0: one episode of tenji gxp.

651
00:42:32,734 --> 00:42:35,521
Speaker 1: uh try to forget that fact.

652
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:44,875
Speaker 1: that was that is still the worst disparity in all of history between the goodness of the opening theme song to an anime and the reality of what that anime is.

653
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,557
Speaker 1: mm-hmm.

654
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,122
Speaker 1: I don't know who gxp was for.

655
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,941
Speaker 1: nobody like not even tenji fans because the characters aren't even in it.

656
00:42:52,001 --> 00:42:55,258
Speaker 0: let's wrap this up by talking about anime.

657
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:57,249
Speaker 0: we know exists but we know not to watch.

658
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:59,741
Speaker 0: so we haven't watched for example every incest show.

659
00:42:59,882 --> 00:43:02,114
Speaker 0: well yes but I'm talking about less obvious ones.

660
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:03,502
Speaker 0: for example you mentioned tenchi.

661
00:43:03,643 --> 00:43:05,895
Speaker 0: you always used to go to media play and what was on the shelf?

662
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,032
Speaker 0: Oh Oh photon that's right and you know what time.

663
00:43:10,112 --> 00:43:11,880
Speaker 0: never bought it never watched it.

664
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,708
Speaker 0: just ignore it was there.

665
00:43:13,748 --> 00:43:14,954
Speaker 0: I kept seeing it over and over again.

666
00:43:14,974 --> 00:43:25,742
Speaker 1: I've seen the same poorly dubbed with weird music trailer for it in front of other anime on DVDs like a hundred times every time like oh right that show that I'll never watch exists.

667
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,972
Speaker 1: mm-hmm as far as I can tell it's about.

668
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:31,428
Speaker 1: I don't know it is a tenchi knockoff and the guys an idiot.

669
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:34,702
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is but I know it exists.

670
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:35,947
Speaker 0: and there's an anime called photon.

671
00:43:35,987 --> 00:43:39,705
Speaker 1: anyone give us a good reason to watch one second of that show right?

672
00:43:40,288 --> 00:43:41,554
Speaker 0: any other ones in that category?

673
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,808
Speaker 0: ah in that category something you know is bad.

674
00:43:44,848 --> 00:43:52,983
Speaker 1: there's a lot of shows that other people probably haven't watched for similar reasons but it's I think usually those reasons boil down to.

675
00:43:53,345 --> 00:43:55,214
Speaker 1: they're just too young and don't remember or know.

676
00:43:55,255 --> 00:44:02,445
Speaker 1: these shows exist because there's no longer a culture in an anime fan society of discovering old shows.

677
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:03,107
Speaker 1: there's no more.

678
00:44:03,127 --> 00:44:05,135
Speaker 1: the old guy says hey watch golden boy.

679
00:44:05,155 --> 00:44:07,446
Speaker 1: so no one will ever watch golden boy.

680
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:10,239
Speaker 0: actually haven't seen golden boy though it's good it's pretty funny.

681
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,324
Speaker 1: yeah I like it.

682
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:13,393
Speaker 0: I know enough to know is good.

683
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:19,241
Speaker 1: or like bakuretsu hunters like no one's gonna tell anyone to watch that I do not watch that it's actually pretty funny.

684
00:44:19,261 --> 00:44:21,271
Speaker 1: yeah it's free it's okay it's not.

685
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:26,212
Speaker 1: you know what it's on the level of all those shows like that from that era.

686
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:32,516
Speaker 1: they're throwaway shows that are moderately funny that were surprisingly popular in their element at the time.

687
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,587
Speaker 0: what was that weird?

688
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,029
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna remember it and I'm not gonna be able to describe it because I didn't wear it.

689
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,558
Speaker 0: it came in a weird box.

690
00:44:43,618 --> 00:44:44,982
Speaker 0: Nicole liked it.

691
00:44:45,384 --> 00:44:46,668
Speaker 0: the box is like black.

692
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:48,814
Speaker 0: that has something to do with lesbians.

693
00:44:49,316 --> 00:44:54,352
Speaker 1: oh oh that was the show about the lesbian space pirates.

694
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:55,838
Speaker 1: that was just really dumb.

695
00:44:55,878 --> 00:44:56,541
Speaker 0: what's it called?

696
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:57,404
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

697
00:44:57,424 --> 00:45:00,359
Speaker 1: I'm gonna Google for lesbian space pirates.

698
00:45:00,499 --> 00:45:03,135
Speaker 0: you're gonna find the lesbian space pirates which is a comic book.

699
00:45:03,155 --> 00:45:04,021
Speaker 0: that's actually really good.

700
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:11,889
Speaker 1: I actually do really like that comic space pirate anime not bodacious space pirates.

701
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:12,571
Speaker 0: that's the good one.

702
00:45:12,632 --> 00:45:15,509
Speaker 0: yeah and I don't know I don't know if that's actually the good.

703
00:45:15,529 --> 00:45:17,341
Speaker 1: people are gonna be mad at us because I hurt people.

704
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,871
Speaker 1: a lot of people say this show is pretty good.

705
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:30,161
Speaker 1: I remember debating with people about it but I just remember people told me it was cowboy bebop with an all-female cast and that is not what that show was mm-hmm.

706
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,346
Speaker 1: and actually you know what.

707
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:35,163
Speaker 1: there's a show that's really popular that like David Riley and Joel I really like it.

708
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:39,766
Speaker 1: but uh Black Lagoon I watched a bunch of episodes of and I just didn't like it.

709
00:45:39,846 --> 00:45:42,302
Speaker 0: I watched like three episodes and I was like what the fuck this bullshit.

710
00:45:42,463 --> 00:45:49,274
Speaker 1: it just seemed really kind of why I don't understand why everyone likes that show like it is the word I would use to describe that show.

711
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:50,680
Speaker 0: yeah I just don't get it.

712
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:59,399
Speaker 1: but at least we know about these shows though it's kind of bad that I can't remember the name of the show we were just talking about.

713
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:01,007
Speaker 0: yeah I can think I can think.

714
00:46:01,027 --> 00:46:03,863
Speaker 0: you know I just realized it's just coming into my head now.

715
00:46:03,984 --> 00:46:08,860
Speaker 0: all these shows like get backers and you know there's just so many shows.

716
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,044
Speaker 0: D gray man.

717
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:14,877
Speaker 1: but yeah well there was heat guy J guy J.

718
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,442
Speaker 0: it's just so.

719
00:46:16,462 --> 00:46:22,490
Speaker 1: the problem is the anime weren't really notable because there's shows that we watched like one episode of her like.

720
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,180
Speaker 1: yeah this isn't any good and just didn't bother.

721
00:46:24,562 --> 00:46:34,282
Speaker 1: there's a difference between that and the show that you know exists could watch and choose to never watch or the show that you watch a lot of and then stop watching.

722
00:46:34,302 --> 00:46:34,362
Speaker 1: mmm.

723
00:46:35,707 --> 00:46:42,979
Speaker 1: so yourself think about shows like that like try to list the shows you gave up on after having invested substantial time in them.

724
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,647
Speaker 1: yeah you might see a pattern.

725
00:46:44,808 --> 00:46:47,320
Speaker 0: I never watched any of those crest or star banners.

726
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:53,509
Speaker 1: our crest of the stars was okay but I never watched banner of the star because crest was actually kind of too boring for me.

727
00:46:53,911 --> 00:47:03,567
Speaker 1: hmm and that's coming from a man who thinks gassaraki is a great anime that everyone should see someone who did not fall asleep during sky crawlers.

728
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:07,059
Speaker 0: all right have we gone on long enough?

729
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:07,603
Speaker 0: I think we're good.

730
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:12,091
Speaker 1: all right via this lot and so I wonder how many people stopped listening to this show before it finished.

731
00:47:12,312 --> 00:47:13,595
Speaker 0: hopefully they're smart.

732
00:47:13,615 --> 00:47:14,377
Speaker 0: most of them.

733
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:19,753
