18
00:00:55,686 --> 00:00:59,889

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,820
Speaker 1: and I'm gonna go back to wearing the coat I like instead of the coat I wear when it's like bitterly ass cold out.

20
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:14,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I'm wearing the winter coat right and soon I'll transfer to like a leather jacket and then the hoodie and then the Nothing, I'll pretty much go to the blazer until I can get away with nothing.

21
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:16,473
Speaker 0: I can't wait until I can go to the nothing.

22
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:17,319
Speaker 0: That'll be good times.

23
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,174
Speaker 1: But uh, I actually had to go.

24
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:27,520
Speaker 1: I went outside stood there for a second when Woman walked back in took off my nice coat put on the snow coat and went back outside.

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,655
Speaker 1: He usually was like one degree.

26
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:30,280
Speaker 1: this morning.

27
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:35,080
Speaker 0: Usually I put my hand on the window to figure out how cold it is outside and that's a pretty good test.

28
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't so I don't ever.

29
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:39,280
Speaker 0: so I don't go outside and then go back in like a dumbass.

30
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,533
Speaker 1: It was extra cold plus hand on the window doesn't help.

31
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:45,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does now Not if it's just windy cold because it wasn't that cold.

32
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:49,476
Speaker 1: I think what really brought it below the line was the fact that it was like a billion mile an hour.

33
00:01:49,536 --> 00:02:01,300
Speaker 0: wind hand on the Window is not you know, like super accurate temperature telling, you know, but regardless of that I only have like three or four coat options, you know ranging from no coat to heaviest coat.

34
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:06,036
Speaker 0: By touching the window I can pretty much figure out which option is.

35
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:11,599
Speaker 1: I go from Actually wearing shorts and stuff and then changing when I get to work and biking to wear in.

36
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:20,974
Speaker 1: you know my trench coat to wear in the trench coat with the liner to wear in just the liner to wear in the Winter jacket plus or minus gloves plus or minus hood plus or minus hat.

37
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:21,336
Speaker 0: Yes.

38
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:22,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't have these problems.

39
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:29,250
Speaker 1: I have multiple levels of glove ranging from my nice leather driving loves all the way up to the Ski gloves that also protect me.

40
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,200
Speaker 0: and see I have just these the winter gloves.

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,760
Speaker 0: I also pretty much only use them if I have to touch snow.

42
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:38,020
Speaker 1: I also have my hockey gloves, but I don't think I'll ever need to wear them again in my life.

43
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,248
Speaker 0: Where do you have hockey gloves?

44
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:39,712
Speaker 0: They're not here.

45
00:02:39,732 --> 00:02:40,840
Speaker 1: You want to see my hockey gloves?

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,979
Speaker 0: You have hockey gloves here.

47
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,749
Speaker 1: They're in my bag with all my other gloves that I never use because there's never good skiing weather when I'm ready to go skiing Uh-huh, and no one ever wants to play hockey.

48
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:51,855
Speaker 0: I would like to play hockey.

49
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,297
Speaker 0: I'll teach you.

50
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:56,676
Speaker 1: I'll spend as much time as you want teaching you how to play hockey.

51
00:02:56,696 --> 00:03:04,633
Speaker 0: You need to get two goalies and Eight other people and you know ten sticks and a puck.

52
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:11,400
Speaker 1: I think to rent out an ice rink I think you need to learn first how to skate and then from there how to hold a hockey stick.

53
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,243
Speaker 0: I know how to hold a high.

54
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:14,653
Speaker 0: I know all the hockey skills except for skating.

55
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,340
Speaker 1: I somehow doubt that?

56
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:21,095
Speaker 1: Yeah I really somehow doubt that you somehow don't know how to skate yet know how to play hockey.

57
00:03:21,276 --> 00:03:26,180
Speaker 0: if you want to play hockey without Skates just like in a gym with a rolly ball and feet awesome.

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:35,409
Speaker 1: I can realize that skating and shooting and handling a puck is effectively a completely different skill from Walking or running and doing the same thing.

59
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:39,140
Speaker 1: and also handling a puck is nothing like handling a ball.

60
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can get one of those floor pucks.

61
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:45,410
Speaker 1: Those are nothing like handling a real hockey puck.

62
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,975
Speaker 1: I think also they really don't roll.

63
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,760
Speaker 1: Usually they just kind of tumble it over heels.

64
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:52,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I'll be alright once I get the the skating action.

65
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:53,639
Speaker 1: you want to learn how to skate.

66
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:54,603
Speaker 1: no Why not?

67
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,720
Speaker 0: It's not too much money in time takes almost no money.

68
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,167
Speaker 1: You can run skates for like nothing.

69
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,574
Speaker 0: I got better things to be doing.

70
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:01,700
Speaker 1: Okay, you're never gonna play.

71
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:02,966
Speaker 0: All right, we get rid of the podcast.

72
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:03,650
Speaker 0: we can play hockey.

73
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:05,540
Speaker 1: I really want to play some hockey.

74
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,714
Speaker 0: Goddamn, why don't you go join like the old guys hockey league?

75
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:11,039
Speaker 1: I'm not old enough for that.

76
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:12,819
Speaker 0: You can join the semi old guys.

77
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:18,610
Speaker 1: It's not like when I was a kid where I could just walk outside and there would be multiple roller hockey games Just going every day.

78
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:19,577
Speaker 0: all I'd have to do.

79
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,978
Speaker 0: I was talking about ice hockey.

80
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:27,632
Speaker 1: Well, actually if I wanted to get in my car There were just pick up games of ice hockey pretty much every pond and reservoir.

81
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,759
Speaker 0: everywhere didn't people fell fall in.

82
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,024
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

83
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:34,156
Speaker 0: fall in like, you know, cuz where I was, you know, there was.

84
00:04:34,176 --> 00:04:38,820
Speaker 0: there were ponds and things But they were rarely frozen enough for safe skating.

85
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:43,897
Speaker 1: I lived in Michigan where people would make a point of making sure that ponds were ready to be skated in.

86
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:49,960
Speaker 0: Uh-huh As long as you check you can't go skating on some random pond.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,760
Speaker 1: If you grow up above the Messier line, especially in a place like Michigan, I'm well above the Messier.

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,119
Speaker 1: you just know you've been not you're not in spirit because you just know you can look at a pond and go that is a Hockey pod or that is a dying pond.

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:11,390
Speaker 0: Well, I think another thing is that your proximity to the Great Lakes offered you many more pond options Even though you didn't play hockey on the Great Lakes.

90
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:14,020
Speaker 1: No, that's like saying you haven't go play hockey in the Atlantic.

91
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:19,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll go play hockey in the Gulf of Mexico Sing some Volga boat song while we go out there to die.

92
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:20,860
Speaker 0: I'll play hockey in the Caribbean.

93
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,552
Speaker 1: You know what you do do on the Great Lakes though ice fishing.

94
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:25,696
Speaker 0: No great.

00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:38,417

00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:39,160
Speaker 1: I have ice fish.

102
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,508

Speaker 1: What does sunfish look like?

106
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:46,812
Speaker 0: I don't know.

107
00:05:46,872 --> 00:05:48,360
Speaker 0: I was talking about fishing in the Sun.

108
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,513
Speaker 1: I'm talking about sunfish because I don't want to fish for sunfish.

109
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:53,019
Speaker 1: I just want to be friends with sunfish.

110
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:55,529
Speaker 0: Okay, I want to fish where it is sunny and warm.

111
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:57,396
Speaker 1: just you google image for sunfishes.

112
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:02,791
Speaker 1: But anyway All that aside my new laptop is so hot.

113
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:03,835
Speaker 1: I think it's alright.

114
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:05,500

Speaker 0: you bought it.

117
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:13,588
Speaker 1: Yes after a lot of research I decided on this one and I got to say once my bag comes like a sunfish Normal-looking fish.

118
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:15,739
Speaker 1: They're big and they're flat.

119
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:21,159
Speaker 0: Some of them all the cool ones are anyway, some of them look kind of sharky.

120
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:31,239
Speaker 1: I know a lot of you read my blog early on and then notice that I Haven't really posted in my blog in a long time and many of you complained that Scott and I don't really blog so much.

121
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,119
Speaker 0: Not not much, but I came up with an idea of something to blog.

122
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:43,019
Speaker 1: Well, actually now that I cuz a lot of times pretty much every day I'd be on the train right and I think I know what to blog about and I'm ready to go.

123
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:47,538
Speaker 1: but I was on the train and I thought oh, well, I'll write it in my moleskine and I thought didn't happen.

124
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,229
Speaker 1: and Then I'd get home be like time to blog.

125
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,780
Speaker 1: No time to take a nap time to play a game time to do something.

127
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:03,429
Speaker 0: it's just sort of like when I think about it completely randomly, then maybe something will happen Really?

128
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,257
Speaker 0: I don't think about it.

129
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:09,231
Speaker 1: often I got a lot to say about a lot of things that I can't talk about on the podcast Mostly because you don't care about politics.

130
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:13,835
Speaker 0: So, uh Once my bag a great rim what we need is another political block.

151
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,908
Speaker 0: You just wave your finger and then it works.

152
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,620
Speaker 1: I just set up all the like password things I can do with it.

153
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,567
Speaker 1: I can do some cool stuff internally with it.

154
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:13,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also the camera.

155
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:19,460
Speaker 1: I played with it a little bit and I might just start putting really bad YouTube's of my face off on YouTube.

156
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,005
Speaker 0: How are you gonna record these?

157
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,673
Speaker 1: uh, it comes with some software.

158
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:24,756
Speaker 0: They can't be good software.

159
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:25,819
Speaker 1: It's good enough for YouTube.

160
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,825
Speaker 1: Uh YouTube doesn't need much plus.

161
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:32,052
Speaker 0: The only YouTube you can make is your face talking.

162
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:33,597
Speaker 1: I could also hold stuff up.

163
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,960
Speaker 0: I guess You could you know, you could use the webcam for actually that wouldn't suck testicles.

164
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,508
Speaker 0: Well, no you could.

165
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,880
Speaker 0: you could Skype people and you could see you what you're skyping them.

166
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:57,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't really have a need for that though I guess that'd be good if we were interviewing someone because then especially someone who's not used to being on the radio you can get that kind of a People on skype show things to them.

167
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,774
Speaker 0: Like what do you think about this?

168

00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:14,380
Speaker 0: wake up get ready to go to work.

174
00:09:14,741 --> 00:09:17,773
Speaker 0: Take one train later than I usually take, you know all this week.

175
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:19,360
Speaker 0: I've been taking the one train later.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,725
Speaker 0: Oh, why cuz I'm lazy.

177
00:09:20,745 --> 00:09:23,576
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this morning actually forget to set my alarm.

178
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:29,690
Speaker 0: I Wasn't going to take the later train, but Wow Actually forgot to set the alarm.

179
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,300
Speaker 0: I woke up at like quarter to seven.

180
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,166
Speaker 0: I didn't take a shower.

181
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:39,693
Speaker 1: you luckily with this IP phone and all this stuff I got if I actually woke up too late to catch my train I could pretty much just do my job from home.

182
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:40,819
Speaker 0: I could do my job from home, too.

183
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,766
Speaker 0: I just you know don't see.

184
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:47,200
Speaker 1: I would and they wouldn't you know pay me to see my job would pay me to it.

185
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:54,540
Speaker 1: In fact, I I have a feeling I'm not gonna test this yet cuz I'm doing a lot of work But I'm pretty sure I'd be a lot more productive at home than I am in the office.

186
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:57,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, they of course anyone will say that.

187
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll be more productive at home.

188
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:10,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I think I would be because when I work when I worked from home at IBM I always got more done in like the four hours I worked from home before I actually drove into the office than I ever did in my office.

189
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,016
Speaker 0: Well, I think I'd be more productive as a whole in my life.

190
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:14,820
Speaker 0: I work from home.

191
00:10:15,202 --> 00:10:25,867
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'd be more productive in terms of my work for work, you know for work I definitely think I would be mostly because people can't walk up to me and say hey You work on the blah.

192
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,000
Speaker 1: They can only interact with me via email and telephone calls.

193
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:30,474
Speaker 0: I see that actually doesn't that?

194
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:36,177
Speaker 0: that's actually Like I'll be sitting there with no work and someone will come and say hey do the blah and that's like.

195
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:37,222
Speaker 0: that's how I get Work.

196
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:47,660
Speaker 1: my job is different because my job is basically stare at very important computers and react furiously if anything it all goes wrong with them and also networks and stuff.

197
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,791
Speaker 1: but When nothing is going wrong, I have enough Proactive kind of cool work to do.

198
00:10:53,812 --> 00:11:01,300
Speaker 1: I Have more work to do that I don't have to do which is work that I can do when I'm not working on more important like critical things.

199
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:03,930
Speaker 1: Then I had in my previous two jobs combined.

200
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,676
Speaker 0: ever is that's the kind of work.

201
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:07,765
Speaker 0: late is if there's work That doesn't have to be done.

202
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,092
Speaker 0: Usually I don't do it.

203
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,700
Speaker 0: I'll just play like flash games instead.

204
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:11,807
Speaker 1: Well, see this is work.

Speaker 1: I always said man, if only a company would let me do this.

208
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:18,196

Speaker 0: Well, I stopped reading news and things.

219
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,573
Speaker 0: So now it's very hard for me to get a news, especially on Thursday, you know, at least on like Tuesday I can read gaming blogs or Wednesday.

220
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,440
Speaker 0: I can read anime.

221
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:47,522
Speaker 1: On Thursday, I just go to Google News and there's like four things on the front page I could talk about.

222
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:54,526
Speaker 0: I went to Google News and I didn't find anything particularly interesting until I looked at the local Google News And I found out a story.

223
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:58,158
Speaker 1: just it's a story about his doodoo from yesterday.

224
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,745
Speaker 0: No That would have been great.

225
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,400
Speaker 1: I wish cuz I know that it what whatever it was wasn't there this morning.

226
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:09,638
Speaker 0: No, this is just a simple, you know crime watch news story from the town of B.

227
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,725
Speaker 1: Oh, man At our IT.

228
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,595
Speaker 1: The only reason to read the reporter was the crime one.

229
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:23,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did some stupid Unlike other schools, which have real like school newspapers RIT had this weekly magazine.

230
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:31,125
Speaker 0: that was you know, no offense to the people who worked on it because they did what they could do, you know what they were allowed to do, but It sucked pretty

231
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:37,848
Speaker 1: much every year at some point the University of Rochester We're just kind of dropped their school newspaper off and

232
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:40,135
Speaker 0: which is a real newspaper on newsprint

233
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,218
Speaker 1: as this kind of big.

234
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:42,265
Speaker 1: Haha Fuck you.

235
00:12:42,306 --> 00:12:43,539
Speaker 1: Here's a real newspaper guys.

236
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even though I didn't go to their school their newspaper was good to read.

237
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,657
Speaker 1: Also their arcade.

238
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:51,273
Speaker 1: All right God, we lived at RIT.

239
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:59,301
Speaker 1: RIT was awesome But if you wanted to play arcade games or read a newspaper, you had to go to the University of Rochester All right.

240
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,596
Speaker 1: So anyway, of course if you wanted to learn, okay, you're dragging it out here.

241
00:13:02,636 --> 00:13:04,983
Speaker 1: I am dragging it out Let's not.

242
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:05,485
Speaker 0: Why?

243
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,153
Speaker 0: Because I want this episode shorter.

244
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:07,534
Speaker 0: Why?

245
00:13:07,615 --> 00:13:08,258
Speaker 0: And I want to eat.

246
00:13:08,418 --> 00:13:12,420
Speaker 0: Okay Anyway, so check out this local crime watch news.

247
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,132
Speaker 0: Usually the best part of the shitty RIT newspaper was the new.

248
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,379
Speaker 0: the crime news is the crime news from Beacon.

249
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:18,680
Speaker 0: You ready?

250
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,895
Speaker 0: Okay, so a guy He was driving 25 years old around 8 at night on Church Street.

251
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:26,617
Speaker 0: He's driving.

252
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:27,380
Speaker 1: I know where that is.

253
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:28,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know where that is, too.

254
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,017
Speaker 0: It's it's in the town we live in right and the cops try to pull him over.

255
00:13:33,037 --> 00:13:33,940
Speaker 1: huh for what?

256
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 0: You know for not wearing a seatbelt.

257
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:39,256
Speaker 0: Aha the cops saw he didn't have a seatbelt.

258
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:39,840
Speaker 0: so the cop goes.

259
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:51,179
Speaker 1: We you know, I'm often dubious because I look at other cars and unless I am right there You can't tell if someone's wearing a seatbelt or not unless you're really really gunning for him.

260
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:58,358
Speaker 0: Okay, regardless right the cops start chasing him, you know for the seatbelt, right and he doesn't.

261
00:13:58,398 --> 00:13:59,120
Speaker 0: he doesn't pull over.

262
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,492
Speaker 1: All right, obviously car full of weed.

263
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:11,003
Speaker 0: Oh So he keeps driving away from the cops the cops chasing down Church Street, right and they see something fly out the window of the car.

264
00:14:11,124 --> 00:14:12,859
Speaker 1: ha obviously a dime bag.

265
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,714
Speaker 0: Okay, so they they pull.

266
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:17,800
Speaker 0: they finally pull them over.

267
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:26,170
Speaker 1: I got to say one thing to this dude regardless of where the story goes and this is a public service announcement There are two parts one and I'm quoting someone else.

268
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,079
Speaker 1: No one ever got arrested for pot brownies.

269
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:42,284
Speaker 1: and two if You're gonna get pulled over Unless it's out in the open or you were smoking it just then which is a bad idea They're not gonna.

270
00:14:42,505 --> 00:14:46,019
Speaker 1: they're gonna give you a ticket from speeding or whatever and you're gonna go along your business.

271
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:51,920
Speaker 0: So anyway, they got him right for the seatbelt, whatever and they did their police thing, right?

272
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,239
Speaker 0: And then they went and they went they found the thing he threw out of the window.

273
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,820
Speaker 1: So the obvious was this not a dime bag because I'm hoping that the story suddenly turns Park.

274
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,080
Speaker 0: No, it was a. it was a CD case a CD jewel case full of CDs.

275
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:08,756
Speaker 0: No full of two and a half ounces of cocaine.

276
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:11,246
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, okay, right.

277
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:16,847
Speaker 1: So oh because if if you would said two and a half ounces of weed, I would have said wow no, no, that's like that.

278
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:21,065
Speaker 0: that's Dwayne said right here, but It's in his.

279
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:23,019
Speaker 0: it fit in a CD case.

280
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:24,705
Speaker 0: It was two and a half ounces.

281
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:31,728
Speaker 0: if you would have just left the CD case where your CD cases in your car go how would the cops have seen it were they?

282
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:41,157
Speaker 1: it's not like if you had just pulled over calmly and Acted like a normal person or pulled over and gone into the tirade of fucking officers seatbelt blah.

283
00:15:41,258 --> 00:15:47,800
Speaker 1: even then yeah They would have gotten you for the seatbelt and maybe you know, like the the dice hanging there or something.

284
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,677
Speaker 1: But they wouldn't really have had probable cause to search your card.

285
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,765
Speaker 1: now You're a dumbass.

286
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:58,262
Speaker 1: a lot of marijuana people get caught because they were smoking it right then in which case I have no sympathy for You at all.

287
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,809
Speaker 1: No smoking weed and driving.

288
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,135
Speaker 0: No, that's a bad idea.

289
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:02,280
Speaker 1: You weren't smoking it right then?

290
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:07,228
Speaker 1: I mean granted if you've got a lot of it Just snorted some of the cocaine.

291
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:11,600
Speaker 1: but even then there is a somewhat distinctive scent of marijuana.

292
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,408
Speaker 1: I've smelled it often at our eyes.

293
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:14,532
Speaker 0: smells like trash.

294
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:16,280
Speaker 1: It smells like dammit Dwayne.

295
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:29,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually no doesn't smell at all like dammit Dwayne because no one would sell dammit Dwayne any damn weed Because he was called dammit Dwayne for a reason dammit Dwayne dammit, but Unless you were just smoking it.

296
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:30,299
Speaker 1: Well, what cocaine?

297
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:38,028
Speaker 1: 2.5 ounces of that is not going to smell like anything At least not if it's in a CD jewel case.

298
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:43,970
Speaker 0: and I think this just this is a really great argument of not to snort cocaine.

299
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:53,180
Speaker 0: because you know if you If you snort cocaine, it'll make you so stupid that you'll be caught with two and a half ounces of cocaine.

300
00:16:53,301 --> 00:17:05,720
Speaker 0: You see if he wasn't snorting the cocaine Like if I had had that cocaine in my car and if I wasn't snorting it I wouldn't have been stupid because they wouldn't they wouldn't have fucked up my brain and I wouldn't have gotten caught.

301
00:17:05,962 --> 00:17:14,060
Speaker 1: Well anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that Cocaine doesn't really make you stupid so much as it just turns you into kind of an asshole kind of a really intense asshole.

302
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:25,916
Speaker 0: Well, obviously it makes you stupid because here I have I guess I have correlating sort of evidence and not so much the causation Submit that provides what there's a there's a correlation of one-to-one here.

303
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:34,338
Speaker 0: in my sample I submit my my scientific study of people who snow who snorted cocaine and people who are so stupid They got caught with a small amount of it.

304
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,497
Speaker 1: simple dude was kind of dumb and panicked and If had he not panicked, he would have had a relatively minor ticket that he probably could have fought in court.

305
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:50,150
Speaker 0: Yep So I in other news, I think it just goes well with your fake seat belt from yesterday The fake seat belt.

306
00:17:50,352 --> 00:17:55,526
Speaker 1: that guy's almost my hero Is the antihero.

307
00:17:55,586 --> 00:17:59,319
Speaker 0: if antihero meant something different but I like antiheroes I don't like him.

308
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:00,745
Speaker 1: I guess I like him.

309
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:04,139
Speaker 0: in the I said if antihero meant something different as in the opposite of hero.

310
00:18:05,381 --> 00:18:08,973
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm not gonna talk about the details of this, but I think it's kind of cool.

311
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,830
Speaker 1: There's this article on slashdot about Nanotechnology powered wiperless windshields.

312
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:22,239
Speaker 1: now people always talk about yeah The future is flying cars and terabit Ethernet and in like levitating whatever and how and collect up.

313
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:32,940
Speaker 1: The real future of science is things like this simple Technological advances that can just make a known problem go away forever.

314
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:36,314
Speaker 1: The idea here now, there's also a cool side bit.

315
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:37,680
Speaker 1: There's no English article.

316
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:41,540
Speaker 1: There is a translation of the Italian article done by the Google thing.

317
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:48,230
Speaker 1: How can you trust that if you just read the article and didn't know it was translated You wouldn't know it was translated.

318
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:58,700
Speaker 0: the Google translators come a long Freaking way because I remember the last time this happened where the only source was a foreign article Was that time where it was like Australia they made werewolves.

319
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,490
Speaker 1: That was Russia.

320
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,483
Speaker 1: I thought I Forget plus.

321
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:07,260
Speaker 1: that article has come up perennially and it always has the same picture of a dog every time.

322
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,954
Speaker 0: Yep, but this story the idea no zombie dogs, not werewolves.

323
00:19:11,994 --> 00:19:16,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever the idea here Is that what if you made a windshield using you know?

324
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,443
Speaker 1: Nanosurfaces?

325
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:21,679
Speaker 1: that just was hydrophobic to the point that you didn't need windshield wipers?

326
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:34,238
Speaker 0: And see this is a. this is the kind of problem where you know solving it or coming up with a better solution right is difficult because it's basically you only notice problems that are problematic.

327
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:41,440
Speaker 0: and if we have a Solution for something right it's Unless you like our your attention is drawn to it.

328
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,834
Speaker 0: I mean the problem of water on windshields is solved by windshield wipers.

329
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:53,403
Speaker 0: so no one thinks well Yeah, so no one thinks to solve that problem because it's not a problem It's not an annoyance.

330
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:58,076
Speaker 0: in everyday life people only think to solve the problems for which there is no solution.

331
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:05,474
Speaker 0: and since Pretty much most of the things of everyday life are sort of solved to some extent.

332
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:10,046
Speaker 0: That's why we've sort of switched from Invention to innovation.

333
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:20,274
Speaker 0: you know where you're sort of improving on things, but even then it's hard to Recognize that something needs improvement when the existing solution is not so bad now.

334
00:20:20,314 --> 00:20:29,495
Speaker 1: beyond that they claim that these Nanosurfaces could theoretically also Remove dirt from the windshield by moving it toward the side and then eliminating it.

335
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:35,774
Speaker 1: so make the rest of your car dirtier Basically making it an active windshield that does not require wipers.

336
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,820
Speaker 0: That's pretty good if it works.

337
00:20:38,021 --> 00:20:39,891
Speaker 0: I think the thing is does it only work if you're driving.

338
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,540
Speaker 0: I mean cuz like I don't know this is such.

339
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:44,927
Speaker 0: Does it require the wind of the car moving?

340
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:48,235
Speaker 1: cuz it looks like it's powered power with electricity.

341
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:54,020
Speaker 1: Yes, okay, however Someone this is a side that I brought up this articles.

342
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:06,799
Speaker 1: I think this is cool And I think it makes the point that regardless of how well this specific technology turns out or works or whatever The future of a lot of technology are very very minor subtle improvements to our day-to-day lives.

343
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:18,760
Speaker 1: that That's how to write good science fiction is to have these little touches like if you write a thing that's set 30 years in the future No cars have winch no sards of windshield wipers because you don't need them anymore and just you know little things like that.

344
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,899
Speaker 0: Can you think of one other thing like that?

345
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:24,263
Speaker 1: Probably if I put my mind to it But I want to get you.

346
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,729
Speaker 0: I thought see that's not see.

347
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:32,700
Speaker 0: actually I think that's the harder part than Figuring out like the net the actual nanotechnology of doors that just use biometrics.

348
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:40,649
Speaker 1: I walk out to my house and the door opens when I walk up no matter what they kind of sort of have that kind Of just without me having to do anything active.

349
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,210
Speaker 0: Yeah.

350
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:43,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess elevators without doors.

351
00:21:45,421 --> 00:21:49,394
Speaker 1: We could have those now, but we don't because of a lot of problems that could be.

352
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,280
Speaker 0: that could be the falling out of them.

353
00:21:51,546 --> 00:21:54,267
Speaker 0: Yes So so what problem?

354
00:21:54,307 --> 00:21:57,580
Speaker 0: what problem is solved by removing elevator doors from elevators?

355
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,346
Speaker 1: You don't have to wait for the door to open and close Wanted me to get to the point because you want the show to end quickly.

356
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:18,057
Speaker 1: So my point here was simply that it was noted that this was powered and Someone made an argument about wasting power and then someone brought up Daytime running lights now.

357
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,944
Speaker 0: Oh, this is what you're gonna talk about.

358
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,890
Speaker 1: I have a very short rant.

359
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,940
Speaker 1: I don't think I need to get into all the details.

360
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:26,050
Speaker 1: if you disagree with me, you're wrong.

361
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:31,710
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand the level of hatred and shit that will come down upon you or me.

362
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,699
Speaker 0: I don't think you realize how wrong you are.

363
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:43,410
Speaker 1: This isn't a matter of opinion as a matter of fact But someone made the point of yeah, it's wasteful just like daytime running lights pushed upon us by the cartels.

364
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:45,477
Speaker 1: Whatever waste of resources.

365
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:51,750
Speaker 1: don't do anything annoying as hell and there are a lot of people who are really against Daytime running lights now, they're morons.

366
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:58,430
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind that daytime running lights should be absolutely mandatory as they are in Canada and a lot of other civilized nations.

367
00:22:58,691 --> 00:23:04,630
Speaker 0: I think that every single car I think if you don't have daytime running lights You should have to have your headlights on all the time

368
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:11,523
Speaker 1: Now that the problem with that is that there is a difference in that Headlights do use more electricity are brighter are not designed for that.

369
00:23:11,583 --> 00:23:12,727
Speaker 1: daytime running lights are.

370
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,610
Speaker 1: they're very different.

371
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:14,873
Speaker 0: I do know this.

372
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:20,830
Speaker 0: However, the safety that will be increased by having the headlights on is working constant energy.

373
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,566
Speaker 0: I think there's a much simpler way and eventually those people get newer cars.

374
00:23:23,586 --> 00:23:24,310
Speaker 1: just do a candidate.

375
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:35,130
Speaker 0: All they said was all new cars have to have daytime running lights and eventually yeah, but itself Yeah, but you know, it'll eventually solve itself, but we can actually enforce because people right now They don't even know how to use their headlights.

376
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,010
Speaker 0: They put on like their parking lights on the highway when it's raining and I'm like you piece of shit Turn on your fucking headlights.

377
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,525
Speaker 1: those are like the same people who don't brush off the top of their car after a heavy snow.

378
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:45,248
Speaker 0: exactly.

379
00:23:45,268 --> 00:23:51,714
Speaker 0: if I were a State trooper those those I would give all my tickets to people who don't know how to use their headlights and people who don't brush Off the top of their car.

380
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm not going to get into all the reasons.

381
00:23:54,891 --> 00:24:09,977
Speaker 1: But daytime running lights being mandatory is a good idea from so many perspectives like The anyone who is against it either is an idiot or doesn't understand all of the scientific evidence backing the fact that they are an amazing idea.

382
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:26,569
Speaker 0: they increase safety but God, so there are numerous high-quality Scientific studies that clearly show that daytime running lights decrease accidents Tremendously, this is why you get such a break on your insurance if you have them.

383
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:30,169
Speaker 0: Trust me your insurance wouldn't give you a break on something if they didn't have to.

384
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:37,850
Speaker 0: They're giving it to you for daytime running lights because it does reduce the chances of you getting in an accident incredibly significantly.

385
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,004
Speaker 1: things of the day.

386
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:52,759
Speaker 1: now I'm probably never gonna do a thing of the day from this again because In case you're not aware of it.

387
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,988
Speaker 1: There's this thing called the onion.

388
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:59,782
Speaker 1: now The onion is my favorite newspaper my favorite news network.

389
00:24:59,822 --> 00:25:00,885
Speaker 1: My favorite God.

390
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:02,830
Speaker 1: I've loved the onion pretty much forever.

391
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,800
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think I need to explain what the onion is.

392
00:25:05,821 --> 00:25:11,190
Speaker 0: you can figure it out the level of professionalism Do they have at the onion for their podcast and their video?

393
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,809
Speaker 1: Okay, the onion radio news and the onion news network their production values rival the real news.

394
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,564
Speaker 0: That's the production value that we at geek nights are aiming to to get now.

395
00:25:22,675 --> 00:25:24,210
Speaker 0: That's the level we're shooting for now.

396
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:26,117
Speaker 1: It's hit or miss with the onion news network.

397
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:28,927
Speaker 1: the onion radio news is always solid gold.

398
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:33,040
Speaker 1: always almost The onion newspaper is hit or miss.

399
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,350
Speaker 1: I mean the articles are always that's got ads in it too are very very clever.

400
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,514
Speaker 1: It just depends on.

401
00:25:37,775 --> 00:25:41,510
Speaker 1: sometimes they're clever in a cheeky way and sometimes they're clever in an absolutely amazing way.

402
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,867
Speaker 1: But this particular onion news network now one it takes a stab at d-bold.

403
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,560
Speaker 1: Oh It takes a very clever stab at d-bold.

404
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,010
Speaker 1: and number three, it takes a vicious.

405
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,541
Speaker 1: vicious stab at d-bold.

406
00:25:55,763 --> 00:26:00,930
Speaker 0: the level of Vicious It's a triple stabbing is what you're saying.

407
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:12,810
Speaker 1: I mean The onion is usually really kind of tongue-in-cheek and funny and they tend to lean to the left and actually know that I should take That back because in American politics when people say liberal or left they actually mean centrist.

408
00:26:13,152 --> 00:26:19,721
Speaker 1: There are almost no liberals in American politics and haven't been for a long time Pretty much at least any that had a chance or mattered.

409
00:26:20,364 --> 00:26:26,011
Speaker 0: if you think that like, you know Like Obama or Hillary Clinton or the or even Bill Clinton or Bill Clinton.

410
00:26:26,031 --> 00:26:32,489
Speaker 0: if you think that is liberal or leftist if you think that's leftist you have no idea what leftist is.

411
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,148
Speaker 0: Lenin is left.

412
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:36,353
Speaker 0: That's left.

413
00:26:36,754 --> 00:26:45,879
Speaker 0: Okay, Bill Clinton far away from left Bill Clinton very far away was a socially liberal But right-leaning political centrist.

414
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, also a fiscal conservative nowhere near Chums nachos Noam Chomsky.

415
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:52,879
Speaker 0: No, I'm sorry.

416
00:26:52,899 --> 00:26:53,401
Speaker 1: He's special.

417
00:26:53,501 --> 00:26:54,224
Speaker 0: He's a pretty low.

418
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:55,488
Speaker 0: I meant to say Trotsky.

419
00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:00,450
Speaker 1: Yes Yes, Trotsky Chomsky effectively the same political.

420
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:02,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know right.

421
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:03,361
Speaker 1: I'm fan.

422
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:05,230
Speaker 1: Noam Chomsky is hit 50/50 as well.

423
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,601
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know but the the Oski but got me.

424
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:18,299
Speaker 1: this is funny and tongue-in-cheek but I gotta say the Onion News Network this particular d-bold leaks the 2008 election results is So vicious.

425
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:25,090
Speaker 1: but in that court jester, haha You can't actually do anything to me because I'm obviously making a joke.

426
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:36,850
Speaker 1: I pushed the parody so far that if you actually tried to sue me for what I just said you would be laughed out Of court, but at the same time, oh man, is it vicious, especially when they get the quote-unquote d-bold representative?

427
00:27:38,392 --> 00:27:41,043
Speaker 0: Mmm, man good actors - very good actors.

428
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:42,650
Speaker 1: They kind of pull that Colbert.

429
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:46,321
Speaker 1: It's so stupid, but yet they do it so straight-faced.

430
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:46,763
Speaker 0: It's good.

431
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:47,405
Speaker 0: It's the onion.

432
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,999
Speaker 0: I really like the straight-faced comedy But I love the interviews of the people on the street.

433
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:52,326
Speaker 0: That's always the best part of the onion.

434
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,769
Speaker 0: Oh, yes it is Alright, so check this out ready.

435
00:27:54,769 --> 00:28:00,863
Speaker 0: 2008 North Dakota high school state hockey championships.

436
00:28:01,204 --> 00:28:01,865
Speaker 1: There's no way.

437
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:16,669
Speaker 0: this is not awesome, North Dakota Definitely cares about the hockey because their state hockey their state high school hockey championships are in What looks to be a full-sized arena of hockey right with you know real refs and real ice and the whole thing, right?

438
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,629
Speaker 0: bigger than the RIT's hockey arena.

439
00:28:21,311 --> 00:28:22,536
Speaker 0: this is a game between.

440
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:28,749
Speaker 0: it's the championship game between Grafton Park River and Grand Forks River.

441
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,362
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know a GFR and GPR.

442
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:32,046
Speaker 0: I don't know.

443
00:28:32,066 --> 00:28:32,970
Speaker 0: I'm not from North Dakota.

444
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:36,810
Speaker 0: All I know is is a game of hockey and all I know is that in this video?

445
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:42,610
Speaker 0: What we have here is a situation in which the game is tied and there is not much time left.

446
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:49,121
Speaker 0: Now when a game is tied and there is not much time left What do I actually know?

447
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,789
Speaker 0: I think a team is winning by one.

448
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,259
Speaker 0: The score is not on the screen.

449
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:53,761
Speaker 0: All right.

450
00:28:54,062 --> 00:28:55,428
Speaker 1: So what do you do?

451
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,137
Speaker 0: Well, like the score is not on the screen.

452
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:05,110
Speaker 0: So yeah, so I can't really you know, figure out Because a high school game it's you know, someone in the crowd with a camera man.

453
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,581
Speaker 1: I was waiting for you to say what do you do.

454
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:11,362
Speaker 1: so I could say shoot the hostage But anyway, no, so okay a team is down by one.

455
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,850
Speaker 0: All right, the hockey game is almost over.

456
00:29:14,514 --> 00:29:15,179
Speaker 0: What do you do?

457
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,004
Speaker 1: start a fight?

458
00:29:16,628 --> 00:29:19,235
Speaker 1: No Kill the opponent's ref.

459
00:29:19,476 --> 00:29:20,298
Speaker 0: It's a much simpler.

460
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,221
Speaker 0: It's a much simpler.

461
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:21,923
Speaker 1: and a ref.

462
00:29:22,324 --> 00:29:24,390
Speaker 0: Okay rim pretend you're the coach of a hockey team.

463
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:24,711
Speaker 0: Okay.

464
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:26,339
Speaker 0: All right, you're down by one.

465
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,806
Speaker 0: There's not much time left.

466
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:28,187
Speaker 0: What do you?

467
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:28,690
Speaker 0: what do you say?

468
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,910
Speaker 1: Well, all right what I do and this is kind of like one of those game theory like there's an obvious answer.

469
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:44,650
Speaker 1: There is an obvious answer you pull the goalie Yeah, and you put in your special offensive team Which is basically these six people who are your best offensive players, right?

470
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,212
Speaker 1: You tell them score a goddamn goal or I'm murdering all of you after this Okay.

471
00:29:49,232 --> 00:29:51,443
Speaker 0: Now now let's say you want to pull the goalie, right?

472
00:29:51,584 --> 00:29:52,850
Speaker 0: What are the mechanics?

473
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,229
Speaker 0: How do you pull the goalie without having the referee come after you?

474
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:02,310
Speaker 1: Well, it's tricky because there's a lot of leeway in terms of how many men are on the ice.

475
00:30:02,732 --> 00:30:11,298
Speaker 1: But as long as the goalie is on his way Toward the bench and you put someone else out You can usually get away with it.

476
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:18,119
Speaker 0: get away with it is what has happened here, basically They just put a sixth man out on the ice, you know

477
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:34,216
Speaker 1: the too many men if you get away with it That's that's because if there are many times at RIT We'd be watching a game and the Tigers would put out an extra man for like 10 seconds and no one noticed Except us and we kept our mouths shut.

478
00:30:34,618 --> 00:30:42,543
Speaker 1: Of course whenever the other team tried this we had a guy whose job It was to count at all times the opponent's team and at any time.

479
00:30:42,904 --> 00:30:49,750
Speaker 1: if there were even a hint of six men The entire crowd would immediately be queued to start chanting too many men.

480
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:59,110
Speaker 1: And if you're at a women's hockey game, it was too many people Too many people and many a time the ref would look up hear it because you could hear it.

481
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,018
Speaker 1: We chatted in unison and you didn't see 50 people going.

482
00:31:02,078 --> 00:31:04,225
Speaker 0: too many men too many men.

483
00:31:04,265 --> 00:31:09,640
Speaker 1: look at the ice and go Oh Tweet yeah to which the opponent's coach would always go.

484
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,586
Speaker 0: what the fuck what the fuck you had.

485
00:31:11,606 --> 00:31:12,630
Speaker 0: too many men tweet.

486
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:18,582
Speaker 0: The refs loved and hated us right anyway, this is a video.

487
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:20,166
Speaker 0: and watching this video.

488
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:23,799
Speaker 0: There is no Denying none.

489
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:24,643
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

490
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:31,489
Speaker 0: No denying whatsoever That what has happened here right is that a guy came out of the booth, right?

491
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,169
Speaker 0: But well before the goalie was in the booth way before right?

492
00:31:36,793 --> 00:31:38,899
Speaker 1: Not only that He got the puck.

493
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:47,226
Speaker 0: pretty much as he came out of the booth Which is the definition of too many men is when the puck goes near, you know You can have a guy sort of come out on the ice as long as the puck doesn't go over there.

494
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:51,869
Speaker 0: Like you know if they if you're far away from the play, it's sort of okay.

495
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:55,890
Speaker 0: ish The gets the puck he takes it over and he scores.

496
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,940
Speaker 0: he's the sixth man will the seventh man?

497
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,076
Speaker 0: because the goalie was still on the ice and That forces a tie.

498
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:04,321
Speaker 0: and then they win in overtime.

499
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:06,090
Speaker 1: So no one noticed from the other team.

500
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:10,626
Speaker 0: No, well, they totally noticed and everyone's yelling going boo.

501
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,415
Speaker 0: Whoo too many men.

502
00:32:12,435 --> 00:32:16,636
Speaker 0: and then they say there's a. the refs are you know, We're sitting there discussing it like ah fuck.

503
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:21,309
Speaker 0: and here is on YouTube undeniable video evidence of this travesty.

504
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:37,145
Speaker 0: I really don't have a stake in either of these two teams But I feel for the team that is lost because they got screwed But at the same time plus one balls for pulling that shit The team that was bad call ref won the game.

505
00:32:37,185 --> 00:32:40,056
Speaker 0: for the other team They definitely too many men on the ice.

506
00:32:40,176 --> 00:32:45,895
Speaker 0: They had like let's see six then they had the goalie so seven and then Three refs.

507
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:47,663
Speaker 0: so is nine on nine on six?

508
00:32:47,723 --> 00:32:48,447
Speaker 0: not very fair.

509
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:52,410
Speaker 1: Wow Yeah, so we had a lot of trouble coming up with the show to do tonight.

510
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,185
Speaker 0: We basically sat around for the last 10-15 minutes going.

511
00:32:55,205 --> 00:32:55,949
Speaker 0: Let's do a show on this.

512
00:32:56,271 --> 00:33:03,687
Speaker 1: Originally planned to talk about Disney But like Disney World Disneyland or maybe Disney movies or Disney something just rotten.

513
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:04,610
Speaker 1: Maybe not Disney movies.

514
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:18,139
Speaker 1: We wanted something kind of short, but most of my memories of Are actually about the awesome road trips I took with my family or other like all the events around Disney World Disney itself, man Yeah, Disney World isn't you know, there's.

515
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,173
Speaker 0: there are some people who are like Disney World geeks, you know, but It's.

516
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:26,214
Speaker 0: it's really not the super exciting But there's just.

517
00:33:26,456 --> 00:33:35,870
Speaker 0: there's so many things there cuz you know It's such a big place with such a long history That if you've been there even once that you can talk about it for at least one shows worth.

518
00:33:36,093 --> 00:33:37,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but tonight was not that night.

519
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:45,344
Speaker 1: we wanted something quick because we're still kind of recovering from concert con and We're actually already ramping up to get ready for the big stuff.

520
00:33:45,364 --> 00:33:48,535
Speaker 1: We're gonna be doing at other conventions This August.

521
00:33:48,676 --> 00:33:50,786
Speaker 1: Yes, and we got a lot of stuff to get ready.

522
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:54,279
Speaker 1: Yeah God stupid podcast.

523
00:33:54,601 --> 00:33:55,909
Speaker 1: So, uh, we needed something quick.

524
00:33:57,091 --> 00:33:58,035
Speaker 1: Let's talk about underwear.

525
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:05,645
Speaker 0: I mean we were basically sat around and I was just like, you know trying to think of other shows we've done and like you know try not to repeat a show and

526
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:11,230
Speaker 1: It had to be something short and not something good because we didn't want to waste something good on a night when we're tired

527
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:12,978
Speaker 0: And it's Thursday.

528
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:15,489
Speaker 0: So I'm trying to think of something like not related to you know.

529
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,270
Speaker 0: I just try to think of something that compete that relates to every human being you know.

530
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,099
Speaker 1: And plus this went like this weekend.

531
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,210
Speaker 1: We're gonna record the rest of our katsucon coverage.

532
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,210
Speaker 1: So we got like another hour to record at some point.

533
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:31,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my brain just sort of eventually wandered from like, you know The masturbation episodes like the hygiene episode underwear.

534
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:39,456
Speaker 1: I'm like, uh, I'm a boxer's man And I think briefs are like the worst thing you can ever Inflict upon yourself.

535
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:41,583
Speaker 0: I wear the briefs, but I am NOT.

536
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:48,310
Speaker 0: I'm not like, you know Adamantly opposed to other types of underwear except for the boxer brief, which I which is terrible.

537
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,589
Speaker 1: I don't know how you can deal with wearing briefs.

538
00:34:51,232 --> 00:34:56,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I just put them on and I go but they kind of hold everything up there and together.

539
00:34:56,792 --> 00:35:00,750
Speaker 0: That's if you get they're too small and you should buy new ones even if they're too big.

540
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:02,969
Speaker 1: I need to be able to hang completely loose.

541
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:09,510
Speaker 0: But then you could like See when I hang completely loose, you know, cuz I wear boxers, you know, I like I've one or two pair.

542
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:10,656
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'll wear.

543
00:35:10,716 --> 00:35:13,170
Speaker 1: maybe I don't have saggy ball syndrome.

544
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:16,974
Speaker 0: It's not the balls that say it's you know The the stake.

545
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:19,810
Speaker 0: he'll go down one leg or the other leg or out the hole.

546
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:26,350
Speaker 1: I'd rather him be able to go down a leg and get his exercise then be crammed into a tiny little space.

547
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,796
Speaker 0: He's not rammed in he's.

548
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:28,499
Speaker 0: he's going up.

549
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,343
Speaker 0: He's going up.

550
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:30,829
Speaker 1: I don't want him to go up.

551
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:33,116
Speaker 1: If he goes down I can hire.

552
00:35:33,157 --> 00:35:36,590
Speaker 0: he's not bouncing back and forth, you know slapping around.

553
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:42,890
Speaker 1: If he's going down I can hide him, especially if he gets excited, but if he's going up I got problems going up.

554
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,860
Speaker 0: He's perfectly hidden right in the middle.

555
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:52,310
Speaker 0: if he's going down one leg or the other That's when you can see him one leg protruding if you're wearing span more than the other leg if you're wearing tight pants.

556
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:53,239
Speaker 1: I can see your point.

557
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:54,712
Speaker 0: I'm not wearing tight I don't.

558
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,410
Speaker 0: I never wear any tight pants so you can't see him no matter where he is.

559
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,010
Speaker 0: But the point is there's a better chance of seeing him if he goes down one leg or the other.

560
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,590
Speaker 1: I feel like I'd rather have even if it's not a tight pant.

561
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:05,956
Speaker 0: It could be pulled taut against one leg or the other.

562
00:36:06,217 --> 00:36:11,713
Speaker 1: plus usually I mean I definitely am of the camp of grower Not a shower.

563
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:14,062
Speaker 0: So not like I'm also the girl without a shower.

564
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:14,966
Speaker 1: He's not in use.

565
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,712
Speaker 1: nice and compact It's usually.

566
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:18,378
Speaker 0: that's why he's so nice and compact.

567
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,469
Speaker 1: I can point him up, but I'd rather have him go down.

568
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:24,518
Speaker 0: No, I would not rather have him go down.

569
00:36:24,578 --> 00:36:29,714
Speaker 1: the sense of freedom the exhilaration just that having so much space down They're so important to me.

570
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,521
Speaker 0: and then why don't you just go commando?

571
00:36:32,264 --> 00:36:36,349
Speaker 1: The only reason I don't is because one Occasionally zipper is exposed to flesh.

572
00:36:37,475 --> 00:36:40,820
Speaker 0: You know, I don't really Like other, you know people they like.

573
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,066
Speaker 0: they open just the zipper.

574
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:44,779
Speaker 1: That's I'm talking about.

575
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:52,270
Speaker 1: sometimes, you know There's rough spots in the denim or in the pen depending on what pants I'm wearing and I need that one thin layer of protection.

576
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:53,975
Speaker 0: That's exactly what the brief is.

577
00:36:54,637 --> 00:36:59,636
Speaker 0: It's just a layer of protection between the parts of your body or the boxers But the boxers.

578
00:36:59,878 --> 00:37:02,114
Speaker 1: it's like you're not wearing underwear But you still have.

579
00:37:02,154 --> 00:37:05,890
Speaker 0: that's the thing is sometimes the boxers are sort of not a complete layer of protection.

580
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,454
Speaker 0: Yes, they are.

581
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, only if you have broken boxers.

582
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:12,143
Speaker 0: Look, it's like they have a hole in the front, you know, that's more loose and the boxers.

583
00:37:12,243 --> 00:37:14,009
Speaker 1: I mean my quality boxers.

584
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the thing is there.

585
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,405
Speaker 0: they're mad expensive.

586
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:18,561
Speaker 0: I buy Quality box.

587
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:19,670
Speaker 0: how much money they cost?

588
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:28,809
Speaker 0: I've spent between about five to fifteen dollars per boxer see per boxer for 15 bucks I get a sack of briefs like a huge.

589
00:37:30,334 --> 00:37:46,798
Speaker 1: Over the years my policy especially in college when it came to laundry and this is important and I think anyone who wears underwear Should follow a similar strategy and then every time you were forced to do laundry when you were not prepared to Look at take inventory and say alright What was it that forced me to do laundry?

590
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,810
Speaker 1: and you should probably buy more of whatever that was.

591
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,785
Speaker 1: So you're never forced to do laundry, but laundry at your leisure,

592
00:37:52,906 --> 00:37:57,559
Speaker 0: but eventually You're going to have like way too much of everything

593
00:37:57,579 --> 00:38:05,910
Speaker 1: or eventually you'll get to the point where you will get to the debt the time Or day when you are willing and ready to do laundry before you run out of something and are fucked.

594
00:38:06,596 --> 00:38:07,443
Speaker 0: I guess that's possible.

595
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:08,290
Speaker 1: I've reached that point.

596
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:14,030
Speaker 0: I would just if I had more like if I had ten more shirts ten more pants ten more everything, right?

597
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:19,768
Speaker 0: I would just do laundry ten days ten twenty days after all that way, but in college I did.

598
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,740
Speaker 1: in college I would wear the last scrap.

599
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:25,070
Speaker 1: I'd wear that loincloth before I would do laundry.

600
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:26,093
Speaker 0: Oh that line fly.

601
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:31,110
Speaker 1: that was a pair of boxers that was basically worn down to the point because they had having money in college.

602
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:35,995
Speaker 1: It was basically a loincloth and even then it was mostly Transparent people.

603
00:38:36,055 --> 00:38:40,190
Speaker 0: people did not enjoy when you wore that and nothing else, but it was so comfortable.

604
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, not comfortable for everyone's eyes.

605
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:48,085
Speaker 1: When I hit the point in college It was usually socks or boxers and I'd buy more whenever I could get some money.

606
00:38:48,747 --> 00:38:52,308
Speaker 1: as a result I have like 25 pairs of boxers.

607
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,215
Speaker 0: See the one advantage.

608
00:38:54,316 --> 00:38:58,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I do wear the boxers sometimes and I don't like how it manages the boys.

609
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:04,350
Speaker 0: However, there is one advantage of the boxer that I do like and that is the the airflow of the block.

610
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:19,939
Speaker 1: Yes, the airflow is key because whitey tighties tiny white easy got it backwards cause the Cause the gases and the sweat to be really close to you at all times and not you see if you manage them properly It's really it's not unpleasant events.

611
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,170
Speaker 0: The thing is is actually the boxer is so airy.

612
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:39,490
Speaker 0: It's like ah, right The thing is right and I have tested this in my in my lab I wearing a lab coat that if you actually keep wearing the boxer at least for me Right, then the airiness you actually sort of stop noticing it because you don't have the brief to sort of compare it to.

613
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,461
Speaker 0: I notice it every day.

614
00:39:41,481 --> 00:39:43,150
Speaker 0: It's like it's a relative thing.

615
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:47,910
Speaker 1: It's like if you keep drinking cold water then wait a minute, but you know what that argument is.

616
00:39:48,272 --> 00:39:49,459
Speaker 1: You should eat shitty food.

617
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,989
Speaker 1: Just so you appreciate the good food.

618
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,246
Speaker 1: You should drive a shitty car every now and then just remind yourself of it's not shitty.

619
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:55,788
Speaker 0: It's just.

620
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:56,270
Speaker 0: it's different.

621
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:57,317
Speaker 1: It has shitty.

622
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:57,881
Speaker 0: No, it's.

623
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:06,019
Speaker 1: one is good in one way Another way and neither is completely serious one use for for tight underwear But even then I prefer the boxer briefs.

624
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:14,310
Speaker 0: if I'm gonna wear a tight underwear a box of briefs Oh, no Cuz the way because that basically a boxer brief is the worst thing ever cuz all it is is a pretty cool shield.

625
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:16,609
Speaker 0: It's a brief right, which is fine.

626
00:40:17,131 --> 00:40:21,083
Speaker 0: But then it just has these leg things which are just really tight.

627
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:23,290
Speaker 0: cloth against the legs are not that tight.

628
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:27,170
Speaker 0: It's tight cloth against your legs for no reason whatsoever.

629
00:40:27,672 --> 00:40:36,320
Speaker 1: Because otherwise if you were just whitey-tighty whitey's especially if it's a sweaty environment Oftentimes, especially if it's really hot out you might saturate them.

630
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:42,062
Speaker 0: and then as you okay, I'm pants I have never saturated the briefs ever.

631
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,750
Speaker 1: Maybe that's cuz you never exert yourself.

632
00:40:44,212 --> 00:40:46,058
Speaker 0: Never have the briefs become saturated.

633
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:46,921
Speaker 0: that that is not.

634
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:56,239
Speaker 0: you never go running or actually Biking or a mountain climbing or anything and if I were in a situation where I think they might become saturated I would go for the boxer.

635
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,130
Speaker 0: that way the boxer isn't really touching me.

636
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:05,985
Speaker 1: It wouldn't absorb any know because if you're in glow in heavy Activity and also the air would evaporate at all if you're engaged in a heavy activity like that.

637
00:41:06,366 --> 00:41:07,650
Speaker 1: You're gonna need some support.

638
00:41:09,212 --> 00:41:12,569
Speaker 0: You can get some support from other places like jock strap.

639
00:41:13,233 --> 00:41:16,830
Speaker 1: You don't want to wear a jock strap you want to wear boxer briefs?

640
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:19,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, boxer briefs are never doors.

641
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:19,937
Speaker 1: the other the other.

642
00:41:20,038 --> 00:41:26,601
Speaker 1: the other important part is that nobody has tidy silks But a lot of people have silk boxers.

643
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:27,404
Speaker 1: not gonna tell you.

644
00:41:28,128 --> 00:41:32,143
Speaker 1: in my life I've always kept at least one pair of silk boxers ready.

645
00:41:32,444 --> 00:41:39,590
Speaker 1: and while you do not want to get engaged Then you strain use activity and silk boxers because wet wet silk is basically very fine sandpaper.

646
00:41:40,355 --> 00:41:42,390
Speaker 1: But that's true silk boxers.

647
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:53,436
Speaker 0: So boxers can be pretty nice especially for like a pajama type situation something along those lines or a Sexy time situation.

648
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:53,777
Speaker 1: of course.

649
00:41:54,058 --> 00:41:56,510
Speaker 1: one step beyond that is the dangerous velvet boxers.

650
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,079
Speaker 0: Well, I was about to say in high school.

651
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:10,730
Speaker 0: Somebody had a a girlfriend of theirs Construct for them the velvet boxer thinking if the silk boxer is so great would not the velvet or velour boxer be infinitely greater?

652
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:14,118
Speaker 0: Yes, and the answer is yes.

653
00:42:14,419 --> 00:42:14,680
Speaker 0: Yes.

654
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,662
Speaker 0: It is so great.

655
00:42:15,963 --> 00:42:26,305
Speaker 0: The problem is no, it's too great It is too great that it causes, uh, it can cause problems Problems indeed messes if you will, huh?

656
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:33,982
Speaker 0: Yes do not Go for the velvet or velour boxer unless you Yeah, unless you know what you're in for.

657
00:42:34,002 --> 00:42:40,568
Speaker 1: and I got one thing to say though There's not this common colloquial, you know skid marks people the word comes up.

658
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:46,147
Speaker 1: I will say this to you if you've got skid marks, you're not wiping properly and that's the end of that.

659
00:42:46,227 --> 00:42:51,641
Speaker 1: Good God Well, okay Okay, there's there's in the vast majority of cases.

660
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:52,523
Speaker 0: You are correct.

661
00:42:52,644 --> 00:42:53,346
Speaker 0: However, there is.

662
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:59,670
Speaker 1: there is the shart incident The occasional shard or the occasional incident is okay.

663
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:11,943
Speaker 1: however, if you have Perennial skid marks or many a percentage of your boxers have permanent skid marks Then you are either a sharding way too much or be not wiping enough.

664
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,046
Speaker 0: or see all the above.

665
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:17,329
Speaker 0: got a white bro Got a wife You should wipe so much.

666
00:43:17,972 --> 00:43:22,127
Speaker 0: See the thing is you need to wipe until you don't see anything anymore, right?

667
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:22,850
Speaker 0: I'm the toilet paper.

668
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:23,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, did I see a lot of?

669
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:24,934
Speaker 1: well I guess I don't see.

670
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:26,803
Speaker 1: but I hear tell of a lot of people who blind wipe.

671
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,893
Speaker 1: they wipe a bunch and then they just Pull the pants up.

672
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:29,817
Speaker 1: No, no good.

673
00:43:29,837 --> 00:43:31,303
Speaker 1: You got to do that final test.

674
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:33,935
Speaker 1: It's like the scientist like alright Is it clean?

675
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:35,766
Speaker 1: final wipe it's clean.

676
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:36,450
Speaker 1: Let's go.

677
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,890
Speaker 0: Yes, me and rim agree on this issue that you need to wipe until you don't see anything in more.

678
00:43:40,912 --> 00:43:51,250
Speaker 0: Rim uses much too much toilet paper to accomplish this task and the an Adequate cleaning can be accomplished with far less toilet paper than rim uses.

679
00:43:51,572 --> 00:43:51,874
Speaker 1: I would.

680
00:43:51,894 --> 00:43:52,658
Speaker 1: I would make the counter.

681
00:43:52,679 --> 00:44:00,267
Speaker 1: this is why rim buys the toilet paper I would make a counter use is way too much of it that I use a normal amount of toilet paper and that Scott has a filthy ass.

682
00:44:01,512 --> 00:44:02,656
Speaker 0: Yes, skid marks.

683
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:03,500
Speaker 0: None.

684
00:44:03,701 --> 00:44:04,926
Speaker 1: Should we go charity ass?

685
00:44:04,946 --> 00:44:05,609
Speaker 0: No, no check.

686
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:09,870
Speaker 1: Pull out all our boxers or briefs if we're heathens and compare.

687
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:15,084
Speaker 0: We can compare whatever you want, but mine are gonna hold this offer.

688
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:16,709
Speaker 1: I think we have a separate show on poopin.

689
00:44:18,551 --> 00:44:20,710
Speaker 1: Regardless I why you need a show on poopin?

690
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:26,470
Speaker 0: I wipe my ass until there is nothing on the toilet paper and I use less toilet paper than you use.

691
00:44:26,815 --> 00:44:30,601
Speaker 1: I was a Somewhat dedicated reader of poop report back at RIT.

692
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,930
Speaker 1: I study the science of pooping.

693
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:42,030
Speaker 1: I try to make pooping a more pleasant experience for myself and as the eminent Dave Riley said in When asked the question, what are the best and worst things in the world?

694
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,235
Speaker 1: The best thing in the world is pooping.

695
00:44:44,737 --> 00:44:46,663
Speaker 1: the worst thing in the world is too much pooping.

696
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:55,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Just want to go end this on a point We brought up earlier about when when you go to pee, I guess girls this show really doesn't apply to you.

697
00:44:55,752 --> 00:44:56,704
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a guy thing.

698
00:44:56,745 --> 00:45:01,710
Speaker 1: Definitely We know every guy with rare exceptions has experienced this at some point.

699
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:09,849
Speaker 1: Maybe not to this degree, but there are situations where I don't know if it's primal Whatever like the base of the spine kind of action.

700
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:17,779
Speaker 1: But some there are certain situations where a man body will say, you know what not gonna pay It's not the time we're not peeing.

701
00:45:18,261 --> 00:45:18,381
Speaker 1: Yep.

702
00:45:19,043 --> 00:45:20,830
Speaker 1: Now some people have this problem a little bit.

703
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,368
Speaker 1: I think that's what Scott was gonna allude to.

704
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:27,710
Speaker 0: Well, what I was gonna allude to is that some people when they go to pee, right?

705
00:45:28,213 --> 00:45:30,688
Speaker 0: They will you know, just open the zipper.

706
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:34,338
Speaker 0: Oh Pull the boys out.

707
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:36,750
Speaker 1: I thought you're talking about the shameful peers and the shame.

708
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:41,950
Speaker 0: No, no, no, they'll pull the boys out through the hole in their underwears and then through the hole in the zipper.

709
00:45:42,194 --> 00:45:44,956
Speaker 1: I got this to say Most of my pants.

710
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:46,825
Speaker 1: I really don't think that's.

711
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:47,730
Speaker 0: that's not gonna happen.

712
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,747
Speaker 0: He's gonna scratch me scratch scratch my John Thomas up on the zipper.

713
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:52,109
Speaker 0: It's no.

714
00:45:52,129 --> 00:45:58,087
Speaker 1: guess The young master does not really fit well through a zipper or button only hole right.

715
00:45:58,147 --> 00:45:59,210
Speaker 1: bring the whole thing down, right?

716
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,681
Speaker 0: So the thing is other people go too far.

717
00:46:01,742 --> 00:46:03,189
Speaker 0: They drop the drawers to the floor.

718
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:06,863
Speaker 1: I is also seen someone over the age of seven do that.

719
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,690
Speaker 0: That is unacceptable behavior.
