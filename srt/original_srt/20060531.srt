1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,421
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday May 31st, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:16,730
Speaker 0: I bring you my somewhat rambling coverage of an amazements.

3
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:18,648
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:25,248
Speaker 0: So I spent most of today in the South South South Bronx doing various odd jobs.

5
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,666
Speaker 1: Now South were you?

6
00:00:29,674 --> 00:00:33,689
Speaker 0: Very very south left claw north right closet.

7
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:37,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I did something that I haven't done in a long time.

8
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:44,436
Speaker 0: it's been many months, but while I was driving down I passed one of my favorite restaurants and I had a break.

9
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:48,535
Speaker 0: so I took the subway back up the way it came and For the first time in many many months.

10
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:49,538
Speaker 0: I had a White Castle.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had like ten burgers and some onion rings.

12
00:00:54,312 --> 00:00:57,986
Speaker 0: The best part was the onion rings cost more than two point six burgers.

13
00:00:58,187 --> 00:01:00,841
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know what you have against White Castle.

14
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:02,310
Speaker 0: It is perhaps the king of food.

15
00:01:04,092 --> 00:01:07,410
Speaker 1: Maybe because it is in a castle it is a king.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,470
Speaker 1: However, the food itself is of the lowest quality.

17
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:31,333
Speaker 1: well, not the absolute lowest quality because you mean you could just be eating dog poop or something, but of Restaurants legally established in the United States with no health violations White Castle is among the lowest possible Caliber.

18
00:01:31,575 --> 00:01:34,190
Speaker 0: now the funny thing is I can't stand most fast food.

19
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:45,650
Speaker 1: I mean the thought of McDonald's makes me kind of ill and only fast food I can really eat Today is like Arby's type and I guess if you count stuff like Quiznos as fast food because it kind of is.

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,888
Speaker 0: Yeah All that plus White Castle.

21
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,774
Speaker 0: I Can just any white guess.

22
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:53,590
Speaker 0: I can pretty much eat White Castle burgers as fast as my body can process them.

23
00:01:53,772 --> 00:01:55,105
Speaker 0: I can eat an infinite number of them.

24
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, as long as I have access to a facility of relieving them from my body.

25
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,470
Speaker 0: Maybe because I grew up on White Castle.

26
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,833
Speaker 0: I mean I lived in Detroit and and then I moved to New Baltimore and there was a White Castle right down the street from My house.

27
00:02:11,416 --> 00:02:13,550
Speaker 1: So if you eat a White Castle does a white brick come out?

28
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,409
Speaker 1: No, no, no Cuz I figure that's how they made those places.

29
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:28,403
Speaker 0: Actually the one I ate at or the one at which I ate is a. mr Perry doesn't yell at me since he's back as you've noticed in the farm.

30
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:30,008
Speaker 1: He's been there the whole time.

31
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,486
Speaker 1: He just hasn't Noticed any severe enough violations.

32
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,870
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, he kind of went on like a sabbatical or something and he's back and then someone finally went over the line.

33
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:40,384
Speaker 0: You know who you are.

34
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:41,952
Speaker 1: Mr.

35
00:02:41,972 --> 00:02:43,779
Speaker 1: Perry had failed to edit the subject line.

36
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,105
Speaker 1: I saw that particular post.

37
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:46,370
Speaker 0: I wonder if he knows that he can.

38
00:02:48,891 --> 00:02:52,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway I forgot what I was gonna say.

39
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:57,966
Speaker 0: good So we'll forget all about nasty-ass white cat which is fine because there's actually some big news in the Geekfront today.

40
00:02:57,987 --> 00:03:08,610
Speaker 0: Mmm now reports indicate that the Pirates Bay the Bastion of freedom and awesome has been raided by the Swedish police and is shut down currently.

41
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:15,575
Speaker 1: well this morning I tried to go to the Pirates Bay because I was looking for some techno song from Norway, oh really?

42
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:16,417
Speaker 1: I think no.

43
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:17,260
Speaker 1: was it from Norway.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,203
Speaker 1: I can't even remember.

45
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,493
Speaker 0: now this Norwegian music's really picking up I'm not sure.

46
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:26,110
Speaker 1: I was looking for something and I knew it was from Northern Europe and Pirate Bay is also is in Sweden.

47
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,855
Speaker 1: so I Was like, huh?

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:29,238
Speaker 1: What's up?

49
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,410
Speaker 1: Why isn't Pirates Bay working?

50
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,405
Speaker 1: I did a little trace route and I realized optimum online wasn't doing the blocking because I made it to the Swedish routers and then I just kind of gave up.

51
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:42,410
Speaker 1: and Then I got to work and I looked at the news on dig and it said Pirates Bay rated.

52
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,481
Speaker 1: Oh my god, what the fuck.

53
00:03:43,561 --> 00:03:46,093
Speaker 1: and I said, oh shit It's yeah.

54
00:03:46,153 --> 00:03:50,866
Speaker 0: now normally I don't care about anything like this, but this isn't over with the raid.

55
00:03:51,267 --> 00:04:02,330
Speaker 0: I mean there have been countless little porn areas or where's areas or Generally seedy parts of the internet where people would do this sort of thing and they've come and gone over the years.

56
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:09,090
Speaker 0: But the Pirates Bay has been the highest quality most reliable and most resilient one ever.

57
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:16,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean supernova was the big torrent tracker and no one else bothered to be a torrent tracker And supernova really wasn't that great.

58
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,769
Speaker 1: So I'm kind of glad that it got killed.

59
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:29,168
Speaker 1: But when they came to kill supernova supernova basically bent over and said, all right, and they open the asshole, but the Pirates Bay This gave the two double deuces and stayed on the sinking ship.

60
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:31,876
Speaker 1: I mean they not sunk yet either.

61
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:42,730
Speaker 0: the Pirates Bay has received countless legal threats for many years and Every one of them not only have they ignored but they've responded publicly and hilariously.

62
00:04:43,433 --> 00:04:48,129
Speaker 1: Have their own political party the pirates in something.

63
00:04:51,932 --> 00:05:03,687
Speaker 0: Now the thing is I mean a lot of people rely on Pirates Bay and someone noted on slashdot that the average Traffic in Sweden on the internet dropped precipitously as Pirates Bay went down.

64
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,850
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

65
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,910
Speaker 0: And the thing is the people who run Pirates Bay know what they're doing.

66
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:15,829
Speaker 0: They are well aware of the laws that protect them and I don't think the people rating them will actually have anything on them.

67
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:22,568
Speaker 1: No because they're pretty much gonna look through all the Pirate Bay computers to see if they violate Swedish laws and they won't.

68
00:05:22,628 --> 00:05:24,433
Speaker 1: because what is On the Pirate Bay computers.

69
00:05:24,473 --> 00:05:35,738
Speaker 1: Well, it's a web server probably Apache and an index of torrent files which aren't copyrighted and They don't actually have the torrent files.

70
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:38,210
Speaker 1: They just have links to torrent files on other sites.

71
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:47,527
Speaker 0: Now it looks somewhat like a fishing expedition because I assume the Pirates Bay people because they're very smart Don't have anything infringing on their actual servers, of course not.

72
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,428
Speaker 0: now they also raided the homes of several of the pirate and people.

73
00:05:51,448 --> 00:06:02,050
Speaker 0: I wouldn't doubt that some of them will have at least one or two pirated songs as people tend to have as people who run the Pirates Bay tend to have.

74
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:09,765
Speaker 0: yeah, but I mean that would be like say if Alcohol was illegal you can bet that in the vast majority of homes in the u.s.

75
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:13,955
Speaker 0: There would be some amount of alcohol Mm-hmm, same deal.

76
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:18,029
Speaker 0: So one mp3 they get him and I don't know what's going to come of that.

77
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:23,604
Speaker 0: Swedish law regarding that is much more open when it comes to personal private non-commercial use.

78
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:27,555
Speaker 1: see if I was one of those pirate guys I would be double slick.

79
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:37,049
Speaker 1: I would have stored all my MP threes and all that stuff on Either portable hard drives and such that were hidden away where no one would find them.

80
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:38,354
Speaker 1: You know when?

81
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:42,388
Speaker 1: when anyone, you know police came to my house and just hide him in a secret cubby or I?

82
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,729
Speaker 1: Would put all of them on a server far away or in someone else's house and network to it.

83
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,430
Speaker 0: Um, I have a much simpler solution.

84
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:56,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, when the police officers ask me where I got all these mp3s I say I bought.

85
00:06:56,947 --> 00:06:58,030
Speaker 0: use CDs with cash.

86
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:01,229
Speaker 0: I then rip them and threw the CDs away because I no longer needed them.

87
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:07,410
Speaker 0: It's a good one and I and no matter what mp3 they ask about that is my answer because it is completely unverifiable.

88
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:10,626
Speaker 0: Mmm, it cannot be proven either true or false.

89
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:14,676
Speaker 1: That's a problem nowadays Isn't a lot of the stupid u.s.

90
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:18,629
Speaker 1: Courts the people are doing guilty until proven innocent instead of the way it's supposed to be.

91
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:20,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it sucks.

92
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:23,464
Speaker 0: a thousand guilty men go free before one innocent man.

93
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,146
Speaker 0: Yeah.

94
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:25,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, what happened to that?

95
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:38,400
Speaker 1: It seems that a lot of judges and companies Basically care more about money and being stupid and being right, huh and about being You know, I don't know about stupid and right.

96
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,790
Speaker 0: I think money is just really the only factor there.

97
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:42,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm thinking justice.

98
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:47,299
Speaker 1: Maybe you know you're by default Innocent that someone has to prove that you did something.

99
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,694
Speaker 1: if it's impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you did it You didn't do it.

100
00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:52,538
Speaker 1: Even if you did it.

101
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:53,442
Speaker 0: Yep.

102
00:07:54,165 --> 00:08:01,614
Speaker 1: Yep now that That's exactly right Woe betide if I go rim and there's no evidence He can't put me in jail.

103
00:08:01,855 --> 00:08:05,750
Speaker 0: woe betide the judge that ever has mere Scott on his jury.

104
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:14,225
Speaker 0: woe betide or defendant or Complain plaintiff, you know what pretty much anyone involved in that trial is not going to have a good week.

105
00:08:14,446 --> 00:08:15,509
Speaker 1: No, no, they're not.

106
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:23,890
Speaker 0: But the one thing I really want to note here is that the Pirates Bay people are going to fight to the bitter end.

107
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:27,903
Speaker 0: They have hinted that if they have to they will take everything and leave the country.

108
00:08:28,264 --> 00:08:29,689
Speaker 0: the Pirates Bay will return.

109
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:32,746
Speaker 1: It's like the ghost ship.

110
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:38,630
Speaker 0: Now the other thing about the Pirates Bay is that most of these sites prior to them were very porny and seedy.

111
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,910
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean where sites were generally bastions of wares, but they're also full of terrible porn and just scuzzy people.

112
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,256
Speaker 1: The other thing is a lot of.

113
00:08:48,297 --> 00:08:51,970
Speaker 1: so sites are poorly designed or they're designed like wares sites.

114
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:58,750
Speaker 1: You know this design of a wares site all cluttered and the interface is shitty and it's hard to figure out what to click on.

115
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,064
Speaker 0: They have that animated gif of a fire.

116
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:04,309
Speaker 1: Yeah You know, I hate those kind of sites.

117
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:10,890
Speaker 1: But then there's good sites like mini Nova or Pirates Bay which are designed nicely and they're useful and they work.

118
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,557
Speaker 0: I mean the Pirates Bay was slick user-friendly.

119
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:14,519
Speaker 0: It was very.

120
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,043
Speaker 0: it was run very professionally.

121
00:09:16,204 --> 00:09:18,149
Speaker 0: everyone involved in it was generally cool.

122
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:38,127
Speaker 0: and They're not just doing it for reasons of being pirates they're doing it for ideological reasons as well and I really look upon them as the early stages of freedom fighters against the Various takeovers of the internet by I don't want to say capitalist but greedy corporate bucks, I guess.

123
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:40,772
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yep.

124
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:41,535
Speaker 1: Yep.

125
00:09:41,575 --> 00:09:41,796
Speaker 1: Yep.

126
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:41,996
Speaker 1: Yep.

127
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:45,869
Speaker 0: So of course we will be covering this developing story as it well develops.

128
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:49,639
Speaker 0: Ah Now Scott, don't you have some news?

129
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:50,825
Speaker 1: Oh, I do so.

130
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:56,745
Speaker 1: CPM Central Park Media, if you don't know the being anime day at all.

131
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:58,130
Speaker 1: Hey, they're an anime company.

132
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:04,633
Speaker 1: They put out lots of anime in America that you've probably bought like Gonna.

133
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:05,196
Speaker 0: watch some of that.

134
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:05,518
Speaker 0: ootna.

135
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, they're not the best.

136
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:12,627
Speaker 1: They haven't really been able to compete with the likes of these I guess don't?

137
00:10:12,647 --> 00:10:15,399
Speaker 1: the funimation Geni on etcetera.

138
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,355
Speaker 1: there, you know the second tier Anime producing company.

139
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:24,530
Speaker 1: they were big back in the day, you know, but they haven't been able to get the new licenses.

140
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,395
Speaker 1: So they haven't been doing so.

141
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,942
Speaker 1: well, they're amazingly milking their old licenses.

142
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:36,346
Speaker 1: They're also not that good at making DVDs To be honest, but they do license some important anime now.

143
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:46,028
Speaker 1: recently They laid off a bunch of people and everyone said oh no This means that they laid off everyone they don't need and the only people still working for them are some business people.

144
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:50,448
Speaker 1: and those business people are gonna take care of the bankruptcy and then it'll all be over.

145
00:10:50,469 --> 00:11:03,190
Speaker 1: and I was like, oh, oh, well I guess someone to see which anime companies pick up which of their licenses and which shows Disappear into the void and maybe we can get a whole bunch of cheap CPM DVDs.

146
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:14,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd really like to get some more ootna Martin Yeah, so as much as I love that show all I have for like fifth generation unwatchable fansubs Yeah, and and ootna is a joke.

147
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:15,905
Speaker 1: The the actual pronunciation is ootana.

148
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:16,548
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:11:16,608 --> 00:11:19,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Don't care that.

150
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:21,763
Speaker 0: sometimes they say ootana in the show.

151
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:23,510
Speaker 0: You don't call the show ootna.

152
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:34,908
Speaker 0: In fact, I saw an interview with Ikuhara, you know the crazy man who is partly responsible for ootana And he said shoujo kakumei ootana You can hear them say it in the show.

153
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:46,308
Speaker 0: Sorry, this is just a pet peeve of ours because we've had we've ran into people who in a non-ironic way would say ootna Yep, and they'd say just like that gonna watch me some ootna you ever watch ootna?

154
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,067
Speaker 0: God ho down.

155
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:56,710
Speaker 1: Okay, so the latest news is that CPM they're not bankrupt yet.

156
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,560
Speaker 1: They didn't file for bankruptcy yet, and we don't know if they're going to.

157
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:06,530
Speaker 1: but the real thing that did them in was Media play going out because that was their biggest customer.

158
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:14,890
Speaker 1: So yeah, their biggest customer died and now they're in big trouble just like a lot of other anime Related companies were in big trouble when media play died.

159
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:17,454
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean media plays Failure was.

160
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:24,340
Speaker 0: it really sent shockwaves through the anime industry because they were a major major distributor of anime and anime related merchandise.

161
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:40,290
Speaker 1: the major distributor of anime merchandise I mean compared to there was no company that bought more anime DVDs than Media play I mean consider that by media play went under because the stores were terribly terribly non profitable.

162
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:47,950
Speaker 0: But there were a few that were profitable and they were doing well But they still had to be shut down because the whole franchise was being collapsed.

163
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:55,726
Speaker 1: Yep and the reason that the whole thing died was because They sold CDs and that was a large part of their business that they depended on.

164
00:12:55,846 --> 00:13:04,556
Speaker 1: and CD sales *DING* Yep, so as a result all the other profitable parts of the store *DING*.

165
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:13,659
Speaker 0: Now the what the few media plays that I know of at least that were being successful despite all this Made almost all their money from anime.

166
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:14,322
Speaker 1: Yep.

167
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,190
Speaker 0: I mean the one in Rochester.

168
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:18,720
Speaker 0: I think anime was really the only thing they sold.

169
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,230
Speaker 1: It was basically an anime store within the media play.

170
00:13:21,411 --> 00:13:23,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like a whole corner of the store.

171
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:23,679
Speaker 1: It was huge.

172
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:24,502
Speaker 0: I mean hell.

173
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:25,827
Speaker 0: we used to run events there.

174
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:35,287
Speaker 1: Yep alright, so Apparently CPM, you know didn't fuck is saying we didn't fire anyone cuz they suck a lot of all.

175
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:36,230
Speaker 1: these people are awesome.

176
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,056
Speaker 1: We just had to lay them off cuz we suck.

177
00:13:38,598 --> 00:13:46,306
Speaker 1: if you want to hire anyone who you just got laid off from CPM Then email HR 519 at team CPM calm.

178
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:46,969
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

179
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,943
Speaker 1: So if you need some anime employees, you know, maybe some.

180
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,450
Speaker 0: I guess we should hire someone for geek nights.

181
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if anyone works at CPM has the skills we need maybe DVD producers or something, I don't know.

182
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't mind an editor.

183
00:14:02,435 --> 00:14:04,081
Speaker 0: So I wouldn't have to do post-production anymore.

184
00:14:04,322 --> 00:14:06,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're paying them if you get.

185
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,623
Speaker 0: oh We're not paying anyone.

186
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:13,600
Speaker 0: Oh Okay Our first employee we don't pay him anything.

187
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,909
Speaker 0: He just does it because he loves making people suffer.

188
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,066
Speaker 0: I don't think we'll ever pay any employees anything.

189
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:21,435
Speaker 0: Awesome Okay, what do you think?

190
00:14:21,455 --> 00:14:24,950
Speaker 0: in pain people for labor that's that's almost capitalism.

191
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:38,169
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's anime day and I do a lot of things of the day about Mario.

192
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:41,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had your all fruity cocky thing the other day.

193
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:53,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one wasn't so great, but it was something and I guess You know a lot of the Mario things I do were commercials Video game things or someone acting out a live-action Mario.

194
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:54,760
Speaker 1: There's been like two or three of those.

195
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,648
Speaker 1: They do a lot of Mario things today.

196
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,532
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

197
00:14:58,295 --> 00:15:03,379
Speaker 1: So I got another one Just to add to the the glut of Mario things of the day.

198
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,208
Speaker 1: This one though is kind of crazy.

199
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,292
Speaker 1: I didn't even know it existed.

200
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:11,120
Speaker 1: It's an entire Mario anime.

201
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:13,892
Speaker 0: Goddamn, is this like a movie or an OAV or what?

202
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:14,676
Speaker 0: I can't tell.

203
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:15,620
Speaker 0: when was this made?

204
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,303
Speaker 1: I don't know.

205
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:18,171
Speaker 0: Why didn't we know about it until just now?

206
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,160
Speaker 1: I don't know but it's old.

207
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:22,791
Speaker 1: It's got to be 70s 80s time.

208
00:15:22,992 --> 00:15:23,956
Speaker 1: Oh, no, wait, it can't be 70s.

209
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,467
Speaker 1: Mario didn't exist in the 70s.

210
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:27,230
Speaker 0: No, he didn't.

211
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:34,197
Speaker 1: it's got to be mid to late 80s early 90s at the latest and it looks like a movie.

212
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:43,320
Speaker 1: so Given that the production quality looks about equal to the Mario Super Show, which is TV in the early 90s I'm thinking this is an 80s movie.

213
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:47,492
Speaker 0: I think you forget how absolutely piss-poor the Super Mario Brothers Super Show was.

214
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:49,960
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand how piss-poor this anime looks.

215
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:56,283
Speaker 0: Well, the only problem I see with it is Luigi, but you mean blue and yellow Luigi, yeah What's up with that?

216
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,839
Speaker 1: You need to mix the blue and the yellow ink together to get the green people.

217
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:05,348
Speaker 0: how it works Luigi kind of reminds me of Lupin a little bit.

218
00:16:05,468 --> 00:16:13,334
Speaker 0: just the way the voice actor is and the way Luigi seems to act I Guess kind of barely like a little bit like I thought of Lupin.

219
00:16:13,676 --> 00:16:22,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Didn't notice it until you said something and then it was like, okay, maybe the the tiniest tiniest bit anyway.

220
00:16:23,281 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 1: This is pretty humorous even without subtitles, but you're not gonna be able to see the whole thing on YouTube.

221
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,380
Speaker 1: They're only three parts the pre credits the credits in the beginning part and then a little bit more the beginning part.

222
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,928
Speaker 1: And then it is that's it.

223
00:16:36,968 --> 00:16:49,820
Speaker 1: They don't have the rest of the movie on YouTube yet But obviously someone has this movie somewhere and someone should fansub it because right now watching it without subtitles I can only get so much of the plot, but there's some crazy stuff in there.

224
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:58,200
Speaker 1: There's Luigi raiding casinos and coins and eat everyone eating magic mushrooms, and they're working in some sort of grocery store.

225
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:04,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's a giant paratrooper that brings into a paratrooper nest and there's more magic mushrooms.

226
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,700
Speaker 1: And we're not just talking about the mushrooms that make you big.

227
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,634
Speaker 1: We're talking about all kinds of magic mushrooms here.

228
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,829
Speaker 1: I Think it looks to me like they're trying to figure out which mushrooms are poison and which ones aren't and Luigi's being stupid and eating All the mushrooms.

229
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:26,115
Speaker 1: and yeah What I like about it though is it definitely only includes Super Mario Brothers.

230
00:17:26,156 --> 00:17:27,740
Speaker 1: It doesn't have regular Mario Brothers.

231
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 1: There's no pal blocks.

232
00:17:29,246 --> 00:17:30,632
Speaker 1: It doesn't have doki-doki panic.

233
00:17:30,672 --> 00:17:31,937
Speaker 1: It doesn't have Mario 3 or world.

234
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:36,380
Speaker 1: It's just Super Mario Brothers mushrooms and fire flowers and stars.

235
00:17:37,602 --> 00:17:39,492
Speaker 0: We really need to figure out more about this.

236
00:17:39,512 --> 00:17:43,309
Speaker 1: I Think this needs some research, but you know what?

237
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:46,420
Speaker 1: I'm willing to bet someone's gonna post all the answers in our forum.

238
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:53,807
Speaker 0: So if you want to know the answers, yep, and if not, I imagine someone will make a wiki a Wikia which may or may not be deleted.

239
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:54,429
Speaker 1: Yep.

240
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,319
Speaker 0: Yep, like the juggernaut bitch one was recently.

241
00:17:58,282 --> 00:17:59,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think for the second time.

242
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,899
Speaker 1: I think the haha wiki and the really wiki is still there.

243
00:18:03,401 --> 00:18:04,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is it.

244
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:06,191
Speaker 0: I think certain.

245
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,720
Speaker 0: I mean they won't let any meme get on Wikipedia.

246
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:15,560
Speaker 0: But some memes are just so widespread and so well known that they warrant intellectual discussion.

247
00:18:16,122 --> 00:18:20,160
Speaker 0: Hmm, at least that seems to be the general opinion of the editors of Wikipedia.

248
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:26,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was some other meme I was looking for in Wikipedia that just wasn't there which one I forget.

249
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,248
Speaker 0: Oh great Yeah, are you sure it was a thing?

250
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,916
Speaker 0: Are you sure it wasn't nothing?

251
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:31,539
Speaker 1: I'm sure.

252
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:32,964
Speaker 0: oh Really?

253
00:18:33,286 --> 00:18:33,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, really?

254
00:18:34,554 --> 00:18:43,256
Speaker 0: All right, so my thing of the day is Related to the main topic of today's show which is my trip to an amazement.

255
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:46,180
Speaker 0: now I'll talk about this when I was it an amazing.

256
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:47,383
Speaker 0: You know what?

257
00:18:47,824 --> 00:18:53,499
Speaker 0: I actually forgot that I was gonna say that in every episode until you said it you have inadvertently done my bidding.

258
00:18:57,121 --> 00:19:02,938
Speaker 0: Wait, actually wait till I talk about the musical which I'm going to talk about later because there is a joke there, too.

259
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,488
Speaker 0: But anyway, an amazement.

260
00:19:05,568 --> 00:19:15,553
Speaker 0: I almost said an amazing has this thing they do every year like, you know every con is their little thing like the thing that makes them stand out or their cool thing or the thing they Do really well or the thing people say?

261
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:20,612
Speaker 0: Oh Like Otakon they always have the musical guest or katsu khan as the awesome cosplay.

262
00:19:21,053 --> 00:19:28,019
Speaker 0: or anime central has the iron guest competition An amazements thing is there's a bunch of people who put on an anime musical every year.

263
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:31,260
Speaker 0: Apparently this is started recently and it's pretty badass.

264
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:43,508
Speaker 0: But the thing they did this year was and I'm still this is my thing of the day they did a musical on how to run an anime convention and The what is involved in anime conventions as a whole.

265
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,339
Speaker 0: the title I believe was it seemed like a good idea at the time.

266
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:50,511
Speaker 0: Now they did in one point.

267
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:57,299
Speaker 0: They're making fun of the music video You know and V bits and they have an AMV contest and the two judges are sitting there.

268
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:08,007
Speaker 0: They actually went through the trouble of making The anime music videos that they then showed in the musical to make fun of anime music videos High production values and everything they got.

269
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:09,871
Speaker 0: whoever did it knows what they're doing.

270
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:18,973
Speaker 0: and they made high quality good music videos to weird German music and Terrible anime but very well done.

271
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:22,086
Speaker 0: I Mean what I expected was.

272
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:32,660
Speaker 0: All right, they're probably gonna have a black 10 Dragon Ball Z Linkin Park videos or Okay, they're gonna do like a million Ava videos or you know something Naruto making fun of AMVs and why they're bad nowadays.

273
00:20:33,701 --> 00:20:45,760
Speaker 0: They did that but they did it with this weird German polka music and at the end like the last four videos all are to the exact same song like this And it's just hilarious.

274
00:20:46,563 --> 00:20:51,440
Speaker 1: It's actually somewhat reminiscent of what actually happens at anime music video competitions.

275
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:56,286
Speaker 1: I remember thing was Otakon two years ago The AMV competition.

276
00:20:56,366 --> 00:21:06,014
Speaker 1: all the videos were really fancy with all sorts of special effects and high production But like someone spent a long time making those things with fancy software.

277
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:20,171
Speaker 0: They may have paid for or pirated Yeah, but the videos themselves just weren't good Yep, but these were bad on purpose at least like they went out of their way to make them terrible And it was fantastic that the best one is.

278
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:31,680
Speaker 0: the very first one they show is to char as in you know Char's counter-attack char from Gundam guy in the mask old school, but it's to that same German polka thing and it's just hilarious.

279
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:42,849
Speaker 0: The thing I'm linking to is the forum post in the an amazement forums where they're going to eventually post the actual music videos That they showed currently is just a discussion of them.

280
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:49,720
Speaker 0: I Internet's yet and I wasn't about to go bother the people responsible.

281
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,593
Speaker 1: How come some things take negative time to get on the internet like you go?

282
00:21:53,653 --> 00:21:55,840
Speaker 1: and did someone already put it up before you even?

283
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,603
Speaker 1: Thought to look for it.

284
00:21:56,744 --> 00:21:59,316
Speaker 1: Sometimes people take forever.

285
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:03,275
Speaker 1: It's like a year later It comes up out of the woodwork and you're like, what the hell this isn't.

286
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:04,220
Speaker 1: I don't even care anymore.

287
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:10,582
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason here is that they also filmed the musical itself and they're trying to put together a thing to have it Available.

288
00:22:11,305 --> 00:22:12,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the thing.

289
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:16,427
Speaker 1: is making something like that available Isn't really difficult?

290
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:21,280
Speaker 1: if they put someone like me in charge of it I would have had it available before the con was over.

291
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:27,540
Speaker 0: Well, no Does it take people so long to do this or one video is a lot harder to edit and deal with an audio.

292
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:28,323
Speaker 0: Too many.

293
00:22:28,484 --> 00:22:31,859
Speaker 0: They also have to deal with audio which was spotty at best.

294
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:40,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is if it's if you're making an anime music video then yes video takes a long time to edit and all.

295
00:22:40,682 --> 00:22:48,178
Speaker 1: But if you're video taping an event and you only have one camera now if you have three cameras then is editing because you had To choose which cameras for which scene.

296
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:53,399
Speaker 0: well There's editing anyway because there were you know some delays between scene changes and bits when the crowd was unruly.

297
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:57,366
Speaker 0: that you know I got to edit out And they got a splice in.

298
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:01,500
Speaker 0: because you know, they were filming it and there were actors on stage doing their thing.

299
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:04,692
Speaker 0: But then when they did the AMVs they showed them on a screen.

300
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:12,980
Speaker 0: Oh, well, they had the AMVs And they're going to put them up shortly, yeah Still I mean, I got a note that I'm still recovering from this frickin con.

301
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:14,950
Speaker 0: I'm sure the other staffers are.

302
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:16,839
Speaker 0: hey if you were there I got almost no sleep.

303
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:23,570
Speaker 0: even so Even so, yeah, plus I commute now and unlike you I actually do work at work.

304
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:27,580
Speaker 1: I do kind of work at work today.

305
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:31,760
Speaker 1: It took me less than a minute to do the work that someone told me to do today.

306
00:23:32,342 --> 00:23:36,179
Speaker 0: I actually drove around the Bronx plugging things into other things and then writing things down about them.

307
00:23:37,121 --> 00:23:38,185
Speaker 1: That's not very difficult.

308
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:44,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's time-consuming and I can't just like take a nap Like I used to be able to do at IBM.

309
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't take naps at work.

310
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:47,890
Speaker 0: I just kind of yeah, I kind of miss.

311
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:56,820
Speaker 0: I mean for the last three weeks at IBM I would show up late every day and I left early every day and I took a long lunch Yeah, and I still got all the work done that I would have gotten done anyway.

312
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, it made me realize that I probably could have worked about four hours a day and still done everything They ever wanted me to do.

313
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:03,226
Speaker 1: man.

314
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,377
Speaker 1: I could work an hour a week and do everything.

315
00:24:05,437 --> 00:24:06,080
Speaker 1: I'm doing now.

316
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,608
Speaker 1: I wish they would give me a new project.

317
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:10,100
Speaker 1: if they don't give me I'm gonna look start looking for a new job.

318
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:12,126
Speaker 1: For real that's talking.

319
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:13,551
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be a shit talker anymore.

320
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:14,233
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

321
00:24:14,374 --> 00:24:14,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, really.

322
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:15,397
Speaker 0: We'll see.

323
00:24:15,598 --> 00:24:17,905
Speaker 1: We will see All right.

324
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:19,417
Speaker 0: So today is anime day.

325
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,375
Speaker 0: Well, it's also manga comics day because we're gonna be covering covering other conventions next weekend and such.

326
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:35,340
Speaker 0: but today I am covering Animas men, which I alone went to this year, though I think next year I'm going to drag a whole bunch of my crew along because an amazement was freaking awesome.

327
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:50,636
Speaker 0: Mmm, it I mean I when I go to a con cuz I've been to a lot of cons I have a level of expectations based on what I've heard what I see on their website and everything and I don't want to sound mean but I had middling to low expectations of an amazement.

328
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,768
Speaker 1: I Also had a similar expectation.

329
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:58,752
Speaker 0: like it seemed like this kind of small southern convention Like I never even been to the Carolinas.

330
00:24:59,013 --> 00:25:05,523
Speaker 1: I expected it to be somewhat similar in size and structure to say Ohio con.

331
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:11,218
Speaker 1: when we went only I assumed it would be a slightly larger and slightly better run.

332
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:16,640
Speaker 0: now Many cut like katsu khan basically meets or slightly beats expectations.

333
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:19,094
Speaker 0: I mean, I like katsu khan, but it's not.

334
00:25:19,154 --> 00:25:20,220
Speaker 0: it's pretty much what I expect.

335
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:35,259
Speaker 0: Compared to what I expected an amazement blew me away first off and second Regardless of my expectations an amazement was awesome enough to where I am more than willing to go back there every year Despite the massive expense of flying all the way out there.

336
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:44,344
Speaker 0: I'm not that far out there Yeah, but all told it cost me a lot more money to go to an amazement than it's cost me to go to any other Con ever really?

337
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:50,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Otakon cost us very little considering, you know, how we take care of the hotel rooms.

338
00:25:50,544 --> 00:25:56,199
Speaker 0: Katsu khan is super super expensive But that's just because the hotel costs a lot and there are only like three of us in it.

339
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:00,474
Speaker 1: We should go to PAX on the cross-country super trip.

340
00:26:00,856 --> 00:26:01,799
Speaker 0: god, that would kill us.

341
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:03,365
Speaker 1: We should do it.

342
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,855
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, not this year.

343
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,439
Speaker 1: I got it.

344
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,537
Speaker 1: I'll quit my job right after and then I'll be able to do it.

345
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:15,040
Speaker 0: Well you if you do that and you bring I'll give you my little recording bit and you get coverage of the cross-country thing.

346
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:15,839
Speaker 1: God.

347
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I do it though, I'm gonna have to bring some strange gamers in my car.

348
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,149
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, you could deal with that.

349
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:32,240
Speaker 0: Yeah If they'll fit if I won't kill them along the way, yeah, but anyway an amazement is in Raleigh, North Carolina.

350
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,693
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually in I believe Durham, North Carolina, which is right next to Raleigh.

351
00:26:37,034 --> 00:26:38,257
Speaker 1: Raleigh Durham is the same.

352
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:39,300
Speaker 1: It's it's one place.

353
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:48,884
Speaker 0: It's like how anime central is in Chicago, but it's actually in Rosemont, but they're the same same deal same deal and It was Memorial Day weekend.

354
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,991
Speaker 0: I was I was there for five days.

355
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:54,060
Speaker 0: I mean I left Thursday and I came back Monday.

356
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:59,954
Speaker 0: so it was basically a week-long vacation for me and The convention was awesome.

357
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:00,236
Speaker 0: Awesome.

358
00:27:00,297 --> 00:27:00,559
Speaker 0: Awesome.

359
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:10,846
Speaker 0: I went because a good friend of ours Nury who you she's been on the show at least once and I we're gonna talk to her again sometime soon, hopefully She invited me to an amazement.

360
00:27:10,947 --> 00:27:17,559
Speaker 0: to you know, do a panel like I always do I do the same panel at every frickin con And I said yes, and I kind of forgot about it.

361
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,760
Speaker 0: And then she reminded me and another the other guy was going reminded me and like oh, oh, yeah that thing.

362
00:27:24,382 --> 00:27:28,840
Speaker 0: So I went and bought my plane tickets and I took care of all my stuff and I took the plane out there.

363
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:31,634
Speaker 0: I'm not going to now from this point forward.

364
00:27:31,714 --> 00:27:35,910
Speaker 0: I will do my typical Convention coverage style which is semi chronological.

365
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,515
Speaker 0: It seemed to work pretty well for Katsu khan.

366
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,831
Speaker 0: I Will ignore all of my travel because traveling will be covered tomorrow.

367
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:53,159
Speaker 1: when I rail about the airline industry and how much I hate it I can talk about how many things in the airline industry are stupid But I am awesome when it comes to airplanes and you all suck.

368
00:27:54,182 --> 00:27:54,845
Speaker 0: No problem.

369
00:27:54,885 --> 00:28:02,779
Speaker 0: I've ever had with an airline has had anything to do with me And actually I've avoided many problems that airlines would have caused me by being me.

370
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:14,620
Speaker 0: Yeah the one time I had a major problem with airlines was mostly because I had to fly somewhere over a holiday when normally I Refuse to travel on holidays and I'll visit my family at other times when they're on a billion mouth breathers in the airport.

371
00:28:15,102 --> 00:28:19,920
Speaker 1: I've traveled during busy holiday season on two occasions with no problem.

372
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you fly places for jet blue goes I fly places where there's not stupid.

373
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see I really can't fly to Detroit any other way.

374
00:28:28,913 --> 00:28:29,695
Speaker 0: There's no jet blue.

375
00:28:29,736 --> 00:28:32,898
Speaker 0: They don't go to Detroit But that's where my family is.

376
00:28:33,928 --> 00:28:35,019
Speaker 1: Tell your family to move.

377
00:28:36,087 --> 00:28:48,540
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so I arrived Thursday night and this is the one thing I mean, I'll say this a bunch of times but an amazement is a small con that has all the niceties of a large con.

378
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:54,985
Speaker 0: It is the best that a small con can be as far as I'm concerned and Along that lot those lines.

379
00:28:55,286 --> 00:29:10,200
Speaker 0: They have Thursday night registration, which many cons do not have or added recently and I didn't bother with that because I was a well I was a panelist and I became staff very shortly as a result at after some things that I'll talk about later.

380
00:29:10,902 --> 00:29:12,850
Speaker 0: But I got there Thursday and it was really kind of today.

381
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,240
Speaker 0: There were a few cosplayers wandering the halls.

382
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:20,919
Speaker 0: I sat in the artist's alley and watched people sign up for tables and set up and check in and do all their stuff.

383
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,424
Speaker 0: Very uneventful.

384
00:29:23,605 --> 00:29:29,900
Speaker 0: However, unlike most cons who have a Thursday check-in Anamazement had stuff going on on Thursday.

385
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:31,967
Speaker 0: They had.

386
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:36,959
Speaker 0: they had some karaoke going on in one room And I think they were showing something in another room like not a lot.

387
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:41,636
Speaker 0: Definitely not a con but there was stuff to do if you were there Thursday night.

388
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:51,306
Speaker 1: Whoa the most I can see going on a Thursday night at a con would be swimming in the hotel pool and DS battles.

389
00:29:51,587 --> 00:29:56,490
Speaker 1: Yep, the fact that they actually had a con Sponsored event Thursday is crazy.

390
00:29:56,711 --> 00:30:01,068
Speaker 0: Well, remember the way because it's a small con It's still in a hotel hotel.

391
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,635
Speaker 0: cons can go 24/7 and there's no rules really.

392
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,297
Speaker 0: So if they have the place of reserve Thursday night, they can just use it.

393
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:09,655
Speaker 0: Otakon they have to kick you out at 2 a.m.

394
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:12,235
Speaker 1: No matter what Yep, but it's all good.

395
00:30:12,698 --> 00:30:18,736
Speaker 0: Yeah Though I do remember our mini Otakon in the hotel pool last year Thursday night.

396
00:30:20,463 --> 00:30:21,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't get me started on that.

397
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:23,854
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that some other time.

398
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,398
Speaker 0: I believe we already talked about it.

399
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 1: Did we?

400
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, but I have some banana phone stories from this.

401
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,755
Speaker 0: con a great now.

402
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,280
Speaker 0: Friday the business started.

403
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:47,420
Speaker 0: I got there pretty ass early because Nuri who was the person who was basically taking care of me this weekend since she invited me out her and Evan They she had to be there to do the artist alley stuff because she was staff and I needed a ride to the con.

404
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:50,330
Speaker 0: So I went with her at the crack of early morning.

405
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,799
Speaker 0: Well crack of early morning, you know, like eight o'clock Yeah, the butt crack of dawn Yeah.

406
00:30:56,422 --> 00:31:06,618
Speaker 0: But we get there and I help out and set stuff up and I have my little badge and then they give me a little Security badge and they're like, hey, could you go take help us with this line over here?

407
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,439
Speaker 0: Because I kind of volunteered to do that sort of thing.

408
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:15,300
Speaker 0: So I walked over to all these people milling her out and I put them in line to get into the dealers room.

409
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,520
Speaker 0: They're trying to get into the dealers room.

410
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,926
Speaker 0: It wasn't open yet And I just did my thing.

411
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,737
Speaker 0: the thing I've been doing at the RIT anime club for how many years.

412
00:31:22,078 --> 00:31:24,487
Speaker 0: the thing that I did At Katsucon, you know crowd control stuff.

413
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:29,246
Speaker 0: that while it sounds silly Scott and I really know how to do that stuff Like we're good at it.

414
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:31,320
Speaker 1: Hey you fools get your asses in line.

415
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:31,862
Speaker 1: but

416
00:31:31,942 --> 00:31:41,602
Speaker 0: even the little things like how to set up a line like how to make the gap so the fire marshal doesn't get mad or How to keep people from cutting or how to get people to actually listen to you as opposed to just ignore you Yeah,

417
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:42,366
Speaker 1: that's one thing.

418
00:31:42,406 --> 00:31:45,099
Speaker 1: Is that this typical grumpy security guy?

419
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,962
Speaker 1: He doesn't work So well.

420
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:59,174
Speaker 1: when I mean in terms of if you're a typical grumpy paid security guy you do one thing really well You prevent people from being violent and stealing and all those sorts of sir.

421
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,304
Speaker 0: I'm gonna need you to move along Exactly.

422
00:32:02,344 --> 00:32:04,933
Speaker 1: That's pretty much all you can do or or my can't do.

423
00:32:04,974 --> 00:32:06,620
Speaker 0: my favorite con security person ever.

424
00:32:06,941 --> 00:32:12,215
Speaker 0: Remember the TMR concert at Otacon way back all of your cell phones and pagers.

425
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:13,719
Speaker 1: That was a con security.

426
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:20,385
Speaker 1: That was That was an Otacon staff person who was not pleasant Yes, but she was part.

427
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,911
Speaker 0: well Otacon is a weird staff structure.

428
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:31,640
Speaker 0: But at this con security and staff were kind of synonymous Like staffers had jobs, but then there were staffers who were security

429
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:32,484
Speaker 1: mm-hmm,

430
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:41,857
Speaker 0: and I was given a little security thing and I took care of this line and Then the staffers started coming over and they were basically like wow, you're admiring

431
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:42,438
Speaker 1: your line

432
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,457
Speaker 0: like wow That was a really good line.

433
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:46,706
Speaker 0: And over the next few hours.

434
00:32:46,786 --> 00:32:53,665
Speaker 0: I was basically promoted to full-on staff and I became like the security dude You they gave you.

435
00:32:53,886 --> 00:32:55,613
Speaker 1: oh you did such a good job on that line here.

436
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,360
Speaker 0: take care of all our line.

437
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:58,246
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

438
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:00,097
Speaker 0: It was freakin great because I hate it.

439
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,609
Speaker 1: I yeah, you know what all the anime some people were thinking.

440
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:03,251
Speaker 1: Haha.

441
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,340
Speaker 1: We got that chump to take care of all the lines.

442
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,820
Speaker 0: It's more that I really like being staff at things like this.

443
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:19,150
Speaker 0: I mean It's gotten to the point with conventions where if I'm not going to the con for something other than just going as a fan I'm really usually not gonna enjoy myself.

444
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:29,877
Speaker 0: I'm not I'm not that kind of fan anymore And I really get most of my enjoyment out of I guess giving back or like being the person who provides all this stuff to People as opposed to being the one who consumes it.

445
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:34,339
Speaker 0: I'm slowly becoming a provider of services as opposed to a consumer of them.

446
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:39,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of the services that cons have already been provided so they're no longer entertaining.

447
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:42,629
Speaker 1: But you know a lot of cons.

448
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:46,520
Speaker 1: this is all you know, I always do something new that I haven't done at cons before.

449
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:48,899
Speaker 1: Eventually, it'll run out but not yet.

450
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:50,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's run out for me.

451
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,260
Speaker 0: But I've been to a lot more cons than Scott has mainly because I was living alone and bored for a long time.

452
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:02,020
Speaker 0: so I went to every frickin con I get my hands on uh-huh and Plus also, I mean I ran that RIT anime club for so long and I really liked it.

453
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,039
Speaker 0: And I guess I'm kind of an attention whore.

454
00:34:04,841 --> 00:34:05,644
Speaker 0: You know a little.

455
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:08,172
Speaker 0: I like to be in charge a bit a bit.

456
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:09,960
Speaker 0: I like to be a lot.

457
00:34:10,462 --> 00:34:12,007
Speaker 0: Well, it's mostly that I'd like to let

458
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:12,609
Speaker 1: you buck down

459
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:21,081
Speaker 0: charge of things because I know that usually I can run them Well, and it bothers me when I see something run poorly when I know that it could have been done Well,

460
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:23,440
Speaker 1: oh that bothers me like also the most.

461
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:31,739
Speaker 1: Yeah When you see someone doing a job that you could do that job and it's like when you watch someone play Mario 1 and run Into the first goomba, that's what it's like.

462
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,005
Speaker 1: You're like, oh my god.

463
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:39,214
Speaker 1: when you see someone playing Mario and maybe they're doing just fine But they're not holding B to make Mario run fast.

464
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:45,420
Speaker 1: It's like ah You're so uh, yeah someone puts a piece in the wrong place in Tetris.

465
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,324
Speaker 1: It's the same feeling.

466
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:47,428
Speaker 1: Oh, why don't?

467
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:49,416
Speaker 1: why aren't you getting these people to line up properly?

468
00:34:49,476 --> 00:34:50,500
Speaker 1: Why don't you know how to do it?

469
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,248
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

470
00:34:51,512 --> 00:35:00,379
Speaker 0: Ah, yep And as a result because it bothers me so much Scott is more immune to this because he seems to have avoided most responsibility in most of his life.

471
00:35:02,221 --> 00:35:04,973
Speaker 0: But I love it, I mean I like being that guy.

472
00:35:05,013 --> 00:35:06,540
Speaker 0: I like being the guy who takes care of things.

473
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,584
Speaker 0: I like being in charge.

474
00:35:07,645 --> 00:35:16,359
Speaker 0: I like and it's worked out pretty well for me and I've slowly, you know Like every kind I go to now I'm a panelist or I'm a staffer or I'm some sort of press guy or I'm something.

475
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,050
Speaker 1: the Trick is to do all those things without making any promises.

476
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:23,967
Speaker 1: that way you can't be the target of blame True, but the thing is being security.

477
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:27,980
Speaker 0: you really have to accept the fact that you will be blamed if something horrible happens.

478
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:35,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah but it worked out really well because they the crowd was big like it was bigger than they expected.

479
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:42,559
Speaker 0: a lot of extra people showed up this year and There were some lines that really needed someone to take care of them or else bad things could have happened.

480
00:35:44,221 --> 00:35:50,860
Speaker 0: Now Saturday is the day when I can talk about the big line where I gained a bunch of fans and I even signed an autograph.

481
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:55,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, right I became very popular about.

482
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:56,380
Speaker 1: our signatures are terrible.

483
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,919
Speaker 0: I know my signature is a scribble with another scribble.

484
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,937
Speaker 1: Mine is also two scribbles with some big scribbles towards the left edges of each scribble.

485
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:04,238
Speaker 1: Yeah

486
00:36:06,162 --> 00:36:19,500
Speaker 0: But I you know, I was so I started doing the security thing and basically for the entire con I mean I enjoyed myself and I did a couple events But mostly I walked around and made sure that everything was running smoothly and that no one you know was doing anything stupid.

487
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:21,926
Speaker 0: Now fun stupid as fun.

488
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,989
Speaker 1: It's an anime convention.

489
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:25,937
Speaker 1: This is someone doing something stupid every which way.

490
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:35,952
Speaker 0: actually People always say, you know southern hospitality and southern, you know politeness and all that and Just the how people are down there.

491
00:36:35,972 --> 00:36:46,792
Speaker 0: and I got to say The people I had to deal with at this convention and term from the security standpoint were the most polite Well-mannered kids I have ever run afoul of.

492
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:52,599
Speaker 0: when I asked people to stand in line They would be like, oh, alright great and they'd stand in line be like is this good enough?

493
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,948
Speaker 1: Are you sure they weren't being like?

494
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:56,560
Speaker 1: is this good enough for you?

495
00:36:58,782 --> 00:36:59,665
Speaker 0: Now they really were.

496
00:37:00,066 --> 00:37:03,820
Speaker 0: they like everyone like I didn't have to yell at anyone ever for the entire convention.

497
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:13,211
Speaker 0: now Contrast that with katsu-kan where I did security where half the con was sir Please you can't stand in front of the fire exit move.

498
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:14,556
Speaker 0: No move.

499
00:37:14,656 --> 00:37:14,797
Speaker 0: No.

500
00:37:14,837 --> 00:37:21,170
Speaker 0: Yes you I'm and I don't ever want to do security at katsu-kan again.

501
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:21,812
Speaker 0: Luckily.

502
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:23,318
Speaker 0: We're guests at katsu-kan next year.

503
00:37:23,378 --> 00:37:28,519
Speaker 0: Most likely Or at least panelists again, there's no way I would ever do security there again.

504
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,806
Speaker 0: But I will be staff forever.

505
00:37:31,846 --> 00:37:35,700
Speaker 0: at an amazement if they'll have me back because it was fun and I really got along with the staff.

506
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,979
Speaker 0: I'll talk about that all at the end when I talk about the after party.

507
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:52,999
Speaker 0: Now as for the con itself an amazements main thing that it seems to have going for it is that they have awesome guests as In they have a whole bunch of cool Japanese guests and whatever American voice actor and such guests they can get.

508
00:37:53,903 --> 00:38:04,954
Speaker 0: But the really cool thing is that the Japanese guests many of them come every year because they like this con And all of the Japanese guests that come really like, you know You see it Otakon or katsu-kan.

509
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:14,273
Speaker 0: when you have the guests they always have like their entourage around them or they're always kind of shielded from the con goers except for an autograph session and They stay like in a different hotel and they're protected.

510
00:38:14,495 --> 00:38:28,880
Speaker 1: Well, that's because Mostly Otakon specifically if you let a Japanese guest out into the open that they're just so many people Like at a small con, you know, they might be safe because at worst five fanboys come up and bother them.

511
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,380
Speaker 1: Yes, that's just how many people will care enough to go up and make some mischief.

512
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:42,694
Speaker 1: but but it Otakon the sheer numbers of people that will just you know mob and start being a Stupid fanboys is insane and that's why they have to do it that way.

513
00:38:42,774 --> 00:38:49,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess they don't like doing it that I guess the difference here is that this is a con that has the kind of guests that a big con would get.

514
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:53,833
Speaker 0: I mean Akira Kamiya was there and that man is my freaking hero.

515
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,599
Speaker 1: All right, what does he do?

516
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,393
Speaker 0: Oh, he was the voice of people in old anime that I like.

517
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:03,285
Speaker 0: that you either haven't heard of or don't care about Awesome.

518
00:39:03,546 --> 00:39:04,754
Speaker 0: Although he was Roy Fokker.

519
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:07,407
Speaker 1: Oh Wait, the Roy Fokker guy.

520
00:39:07,669 --> 00:39:09,255
Speaker 0: He was the toga guy.

521
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:12,950
Speaker 0: He was I'm trying to think all the weird ones that people are not know.

522
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,068
Speaker 1: that's the guy who is toga and because it's all the Same guy, isn't it?

523
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:17,240
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think of all the weird ones.

524
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:24,139
Speaker 0: He was professor Tomoe in Sailor Moon which was an I'm a big fan of professor Tomoe.

525
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:29,600
Speaker 0: Okay, he was sure to remember from Ura Seyed Sura who is another one of my favorite characters.

526
00:39:30,764 --> 00:39:32,217
Speaker 0: He was also now I didn't know this.

527
00:39:32,278 --> 00:39:37,039
Speaker 0: apparently He's also a dub voice actor for American movies that get taken over to Japan.

528
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,160
Speaker 0: He was Eddie Murphy in the golden child and he was Mel Gibson in tequila sunrise.

529
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:45,650
Speaker 1: I don't know what either of those are but that's okay.

530
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,580
Speaker 0: The golden child is actually kind of a crappy movie.

531
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:49,690
Speaker 0: Oh, he was bond.

532
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:53,224
Speaker 0: He's the voice of bond in Japan James Bond.

533
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:56,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know 007 Goldeneye and tomorrow never dies.

534
00:39:57,766 --> 00:39:58,518
Speaker 0: He was bond.

535
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:04,740
Speaker 0: Now the thing is he he's a really cool guy and he did a panel on voice acting.

536
00:40:05,621 --> 00:40:11,720
Speaker 0: Now, you know normally you see a panel on voice acting and it's always like some amateurs or like some people talking about voice actors.

537
00:40:12,462 --> 00:40:14,760
Speaker 0: This was him like training the audience.

538
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:18,235
Speaker 0: Here is how to be a good voice actor this and this and this and this and this.

539
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,300
Speaker 0: it was really awesome.

540
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:26,428
Speaker 0: Like I haven't been to a panel that I've enjoyed at a con in a long time and this guy put on one hell of a panel.

541
00:40:28,421 --> 00:40:34,500
Speaker 0: But I mean they have all the whole bunch of fairly big-name guests like cool people that you'd only see at a big con.

542
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:35,907
Speaker 0: But they're this little con.

543
00:40:36,209 --> 00:40:37,214
Speaker 0: So there's a good chance.

544
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,280
Speaker 0: You'll see him wander in the hall.

545
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,887
Speaker 0: You can shake their hand or say hi to him.

546
00:40:40,168 --> 00:40:42,760
Speaker 0: If you know Japanese or their translators around you can talk to him.

547
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:48,650
Speaker 0: There was a Koichi Tsunoda who was trying to think of one of the he was made.

548
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:54,362
Speaker 0: he did some stuff for Mezinger Z and Galaxy Express 999 Mm-hmm.

549
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:58,039
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna list all the guests you can look that up, but they were all awesome.

550
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,274
Speaker 1: That's one thing I noticed about cons.

551
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:01,758
Speaker 1: is you?

552
00:41:01,778 --> 00:41:01,959
Speaker 1: you know?

553
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:09,869
Speaker 1: I always look at someone's resume when deciding if they're a guest I care about or not and says oh this guy was a Character designer on blah and I'm kind of like.

554
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:13,483
Speaker 1: I don't really care about character designing But it does.

555
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:21,459
Speaker 1: they never tell you if the person is cool or if the PR, you know That's what it's really about is this is a cool person who cares what they did.

556
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:24,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, and here all the guests were really cool.

557
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:33,089
Speaker 0: I mean they were kind of big names but they really had a lot of interesting stuff to say and They were really cool about the autograph sessions like Caitlin glass.

558
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:49,066
Speaker 0: She she's a voice actress and director and all this stuff and Some poor girl in the artist alley had her sketchbook stolen with all of her prints except they left a couple of them in there and one of them was this original thing of a character that she had played.

559
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:58,260
Speaker 0: actually it was a winery from Fullmetal Alchemist in the dub and The fan wanted like gave it to the staff to give to her as a gift.

560
00:41:58,521 --> 00:42:01,640
Speaker 0: Like this is my last thing that I have from everything that was stolen.

561
00:42:01,701 --> 00:42:03,355
Speaker 0: I want to give it to you because it's your character.

562
00:42:03,577 --> 00:42:17,020
Speaker 0: Ah, and It ended up being where she actually got to meet Caitlin glass and hang out with her a little bit and it was really cool and happy All right But I had all the voice actors were just walking around the con hanging out at the after-party.

563
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:19,334
Speaker 0: They were talked to anyone who wanted to talk to him.

564
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:20,340
Speaker 0: They seem to enjoy themselves.

565
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:21,042
Speaker 1: Hmm

566
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:38,540
Speaker 0: now aside from that the actual panels one other neat thing about an amazement is that they do they really focus a lot on Japanese culture and language and Apparently they do a lot of outside of Khan stuff like funding Japanese studies and funding schools where people can learn about this stuff.

567
00:42:39,222 --> 00:42:42,696
Speaker 0: So all of their panels really have an educational bent to them.

568
00:42:42,716 --> 00:42:53,540
Speaker 0: I went to this one panel on geisha as You know like Maiko and geisha and that sort of thing from Japan and it was a very informative very awesome panel.

569
00:42:53,682 --> 00:42:54,978
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what else I can say about that.

570
00:42:55,709 --> 00:43:03,545
Speaker 1: It's good to hear that There were a lot of interesting panels because usually I look at the list of panels and most of them are kind of bleh I don't care.

571
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,996
Speaker 1: I've seen a webcomic panel before you seen one.

572
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:06,800
Speaker 1: you seen them all.

573
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:09,390
Speaker 1: Yep, you know that sort of thing and you know.

574
00:43:09,772 --> 00:43:11,679
Speaker 1: the first time I went to Otacon I went to.

575
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:19,180
Speaker 1: You know the industry panel where you know, they had the the trygun guy was there and it actually isn't so exciting.

576
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:25,200
Speaker 1: The only important part of going is when they announce new things and you can just read that on anime news network the next day.

577
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:31,819
Speaker 0: Yep, it really the only things are worth going to are where the guest is cool or the person talking has something interesting to say.

578
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:39,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know don't Don't discount some because I did this allies you discount someone.

579
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,420
Speaker 1: you look at their resume of what they are.

580
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,600
Speaker 1: You know this guy did this and you're like, oh who cares about that guy?

581
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,940
Speaker 1: But then if you actually go see the guy he's way cool and that's why those panels are crowded.

582
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:51,732
Speaker 1: He used to think oh, why is that panel crowded?

583
00:43:51,752 --> 00:44:03,495
Speaker 1: and sometimes it is because oh He's the American voice actor for some character character and all the teenage girls are going Whenever he talks in the voice, but some of the panelist guys are actually in.

584
00:44:03,756 --> 00:44:04,879
Speaker 1: girls are super cool.

585
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:11,360
Speaker 0: Now I do have to say that one panel that was particularly awesome was the anime club summit.

586
00:44:12,281 --> 00:44:14,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's oh my god.

587
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:16,153
Speaker 1: Oh my god, you know what Akira Kamiya did.

588
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:21,691
Speaker 1: hmm non sequitur in When they took Aladdin over to Japan.

589
00:44:21,711 --> 00:44:22,495
Speaker 1: he was.

590
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,218
Speaker 1: he was Iago.

591
00:44:23,379 --> 00:44:25,226
Speaker 1: really Yeah, really it says right here.

592
00:44:25,768 --> 00:44:26,491
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should.

593
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:28,259
Speaker 0: you should have seen this guy in person.

594
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,064
Speaker 1: this guy This is just to clarify.

595
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,950
Speaker 1: This is not the Toga guy.

596
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:39,159
Speaker 1: That's um and because the guy who's Toga in utenna and Takahashi ryusuke in initial D is not this guy.

597
00:44:39,962 --> 00:44:41,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, this guy is just awesome.

598
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,880
Speaker 0: If you ever want he's I think he's gonna be an animasment next year.

599
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,783
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be surprised.

600
00:44:46,004 --> 00:44:50,240
Speaker 0: if you ever see him at a con go to whatever he does because it's always awesome.

601
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:55,115
Speaker 1: He was Logan and Logan's run in Japan like not to like.

602
00:44:55,176 --> 00:44:56,280
Speaker 0: all the other guests were really cool.

603
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,535
Speaker 0: I'm not really trying to downplay all of them, but this guy is my hero.

604
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,279
Speaker 0: This guy's my man.

605
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:03,546
Speaker 0: Now other highlights cuz.

606
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:05,253
Speaker 0: I realized we've been talking for a long time.

607
00:45:06,017 --> 00:45:08,549
Speaker 1: talking for a long time Yeah, mostly me the.

608
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:14,350
Speaker 0: there was a just a bunch of little highlights about the con And then I'll go back to some more long detailed diatribes now.

609
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:16,918
Speaker 0: my anime club summon panel was scheduled at 9 a.m.

610
00:45:18,022 --> 00:45:20,673
Speaker 0: On Saturday, which meant I had to get up early again.

611
00:45:20,693 --> 00:45:25,915
Speaker 1: I hate it when Cons really need to start asking the person running the panel.

612
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:26,659
Speaker 1: You know is well.

613
00:45:27,081 --> 00:45:29,300
Speaker 0: I was fine with it cuz they didn't really know what to expect from me.

614
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,159
Speaker 0: I mean I was just some guy that some staffer said was cool, and they should let come to the con and do stuff.

615
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:38,205
Speaker 0: They were like all right And they scheduled me there, and I did the panel.

616
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:42,860
Speaker 0: and actually when I started there was one person in the audience.

617
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,036
Speaker 0: Great the thing is she was really interested in what I had to say.

618
00:45:47,076 --> 00:46:00,920
Speaker 0: so we talked a little bit And then a few minutes later more people trickled in and then more people trickled in and then a frickin gaggle of people came in and at one point this mother and a whole bunch of like high school girls came in and They were interested.

619
00:46:01,001 --> 00:46:12,300
Speaker 0: They were trying to start an anime club at their high school And they came to my panel specifically to hear my wisdom And it was an interesting experience to be giving this lecture and having all these high school aged people taking notes.

620
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:14,660
Speaker 0: I felt like a teacher whoa scary.

621
00:46:15,881 --> 00:46:18,776
Speaker 1: But the things they were taking notes a lot of people don't listen to what we had to say.

622
00:46:18,797 --> 00:46:23,168
Speaker 0: those panels Yeah, well at this one I mean It's like the Otacon one where we do the same thing.

623
00:46:23,228 --> 00:46:28,320
Speaker 0: people the people who came were people who actually wanted to know about This stuff, and I think the panel went really well.

624
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,430
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to run it next year with Scott Johnson.

625
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:32,399
Speaker 0: You know the legendary Scott Johnson.

626
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:45,439
Speaker 0: And one interesting thing I noticed about an amazement is there was a Disproportionately large number of both furry fans and doll fee fans.

627
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:55,280
Speaker 0: I Have no Statement to make regarding that other than that there was a significant number of furries, and there is significant number of doll fees.

628
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:57,917
Speaker 0: Take that as you will.

629
00:46:58,702 --> 00:47:04,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were definitely not an overpowering force, and I have nothing against them other than I no offense to.

630
00:47:04,677 --> 00:47:05,640
Speaker 0: people are into doll fee.

631
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,060
Speaker 0: It's cool, but it's also a little creepy, but I know you're not all creepy.

632
00:47:10,221 --> 00:47:15,639
Speaker 0: I think it's just that I noticed the creepy ones because they're the ones who treat the doll like it's a little tiny human being.

633
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:15,679
Speaker 0: I

634
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:27,900
Speaker 1: Think when you spend that kind of money on a doll if you're not going to be crazy enough to treat it like a human Being then you're going to recognize how stupid you are for spending the money and hate yourself and sell it to someone who is insane.

635
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:32,362
Speaker 1: And that's why the only ones you notice are insane because they think the only ones are insane Honestly

636
00:47:32,402 --> 00:47:48,560
Speaker 0: the only doll fee people that really scare me are the ones who are j-rock types and doll fee types combined Because then the doll fee turns into like this Idol avatar of whatever j-rocker they currently have the hots for and it gets kind of weird.

637
00:47:50,462 --> 00:48:01,120
Speaker 0: I tried to interview some doll fee people about their super doll fee And I failed mostly because they I'm not sure if they didn't want to talk to me, or if they're just that anti-social.

638
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:04,888
Speaker 0: I really couldn't tell but I couldn't get.

639
00:48:04,968 --> 00:48:09,150
Speaker 0: I couldn't approach them in a way where I could ask them if they wanted to be interviewed.

640
00:48:10,082 --> 00:48:15,758
Speaker 0: Huh at least without breaking all of my social I guess rules Which are?

641
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:19,973
Speaker 0: You know some people like they give off the body language of don't talk to me.

642
00:48:19,993 --> 00:48:21,518
Speaker 0: all the doll fee.

643
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:26,547
Speaker 0: doll fee people I wanted to talk to constantly exuded that aura kind of like those board gamers I tried to talk to.

644
00:48:27,152 --> 00:48:28,099
Speaker 0: that I talked about yesterday.

645
00:48:29,761 --> 00:48:33,295
Speaker 0: You know the one group of people who were playing a semi-german board game at an amazement.

646
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:37,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah Now you know more overview stuff.

647
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:40,120
Speaker 0: the dealers room was about what you'd expect.

648
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:41,908
Speaker 0: It was a typical dealers room though.

649
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:44,700
Speaker 0: They also there was a game seller who had German board games.

650
00:48:45,682 --> 00:48:54,139
Speaker 0: There were the two typical guys selling knives and swords Which luckily I didn't have to deal with anyone buying a sword and then running around the con with it.

651
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,525
Speaker 1: That's always a worry.

652
00:48:56,545 --> 00:49:01,164
Speaker 1: I remembered Otakon the kid who came up to me, and he was like hey, man How old are you?

653
00:49:01,184 --> 00:49:01,828
Speaker 1: and I'm like.

654
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,700
Speaker 1: why is this guy asking me how old I am?

655
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,005
Speaker 1: Does he want me to buy him alcohol?

656
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,851
Speaker 1: He's like I'm like 22.

657
00:49:06,851 --> 00:49:09,260
Speaker 1: What are you coming out to me punk kid?

658
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,760
Speaker 1: He's like you buy a sword for me, and I just said no get the hell away from me.

659
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,306
Speaker 1: but what I should have said was How much does the sword cost?

660
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,619
Speaker 1: and then he would have said something along the lines of?

661
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:22,265
Speaker 1: $75 I don't know.

662
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:26,240
Speaker 1: and I would have said give me $200 and I'll buy you the sword.

663
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:29,106
Speaker 1: And then I would have bought the sword.

664
00:49:29,126 --> 00:49:35,332
Speaker 1: and then he would have come up to me and said give me my sword and be like Why should I give you the sword?

665
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:42,115
Speaker 1: I just bought And if you would have said something I would have been like who here is holding a sword?

666
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:42,637
Speaker 1: who?

667
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:43,720
Speaker 1: you should keep their mouth shut.

668
00:49:45,462 --> 00:49:49,948
Speaker 1: And I'm good if anyone cuts out to me at Otakon next year Asking me to buy them a sword.

669
00:49:49,968 --> 00:49:52,740
Speaker 1: I am totally doing that not even joking all right.

670
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,868
Speaker 1: And if they're stupid enough to give me a pile of money.

671
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:56,414
Speaker 1: I might not even buy a sword.

672
00:49:56,434 --> 00:50:00,517
Speaker 1: I'll just take the money And be like the kid gave me 200 bucks around for me.

673
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:08,060
Speaker 0: now in regards to cosplay there were a surprising number of jig ends from Lupin.

674
00:50:09,081 --> 00:50:11,515
Speaker 0: Really for some reason there were at least four of them.

675
00:50:11,636 --> 00:50:12,802
Speaker 0: Maybe five I'm not.

676
00:50:12,942 --> 00:50:14,066
Speaker 0: I'm not entirely sure.

677
00:50:14,106 --> 00:50:15,692
Speaker 0: if there were four or five there were at least four.

678
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:20,640
Speaker 0: there were two Lupin groups each Of which had their own jig end plus just jig ends on their own.

679
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:25,200
Speaker 1: It's you know jig ends always been a moderately popular cosplay.

680
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,183
Speaker 1: but what is with the it's?

681
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,211
Speaker 1: you know that number at that small of a con?

682
00:50:29,411 --> 00:50:36,976
Speaker 1: either means there's some sort of local Lupin interest or Something because Lupin hasn't been on Cartoon Network in a while.

683
00:50:36,996 --> 00:50:42,259
Speaker 1: yeah But Lupin is real popular among people who know about it is real popular among people who know about it.

684
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,827
Speaker 1: But how are you know?

685
00:50:44,028 --> 00:50:45,255
Speaker 1: more be I don't know.

686
00:50:45,617 --> 00:50:46,099
Speaker 0: there were also.

687
00:50:46,381 --> 00:50:48,710
Speaker 0: There was also a very large number of Rukia's.

688
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,794
Speaker 1: I don't know who that is.

689
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,440
Speaker 0: there was an awesome Bato.

690
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:55,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bato and my favorite two cosplays at the con.

691
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:58,459
Speaker 0: number one Well number two.

692
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,483
Speaker 0: I'll start with number two.

693
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:04,940
Speaker 0: these my second favorite cosplay at this convention was a bunch of guys who dressed up as Fark calm.

694
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:18,335
Speaker 0: They had a whole bunch of big pieces of paper that basically had Fark posts on them that were like like they were in an anime Thread or really owls and ha ha Their ha ha's and a really owls for real and everything.

695
00:51:18,717 --> 00:51:21,569
Speaker 0: every cliche It was.

696
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:22,433
Speaker 0: and they.

697
00:51:22,473 --> 00:51:27,540
Speaker 0: the thing is they had markers and pieces of paper And they kept making more posts and walking around constantly.

698
00:51:28,202 --> 00:51:33,399
Speaker 0: There's a point at which they were entertaining a small portion of the cosplay line for quite some time.

699
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:38,340
Speaker 0: I would have interviewed them, but I was standing in a tree which I'll get to in a minute.

700
00:51:38,803 --> 00:51:40,700
Speaker 1: They already talked about the tree when I wasn't paying attention.

701
00:51:41,502 --> 00:51:43,454
Speaker 0: The I don't think I talked about it fully okay.

702
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:45,764
Speaker 0: the other Awesome, you know.

703
00:51:45,784 --> 00:51:49,239
Speaker 0: number one thing was someone dressed up as Jameson.

704
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't know who Jameson is you got to be watching some ghost in the shell standalone complex.

705
00:51:54,942 --> 00:51:55,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jameson.

706
00:51:55,849 --> 00:51:57,400
Speaker 0: I mean the costume was really well done.

707
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:01,840
Speaker 0: I mean it could have been done better, but the concept alone was worth a picture of it on fans view.

708
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,687
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll link to it the.

709
00:52:03,808 --> 00:52:06,920
Speaker 0: the item itself was really high quality and the way you did it was really cool.

710
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:10,612
Speaker 0: And I like costumes like that like the unique costume.

711
00:52:10,653 --> 00:52:12,520
Speaker 0: that isn't what you'd think or what you'd expect.

712
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:15,129
Speaker 0: I mean you wouldn't expect anyone to dress up as him.

713
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:18,020
Speaker 0: if you someone said that you'd say you couldn't dress up.

714
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,500
Speaker 0: Is that that's stupid and the way he did it?

715
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,347
Speaker 1: It's not what I would say.

716
00:52:21,368 --> 00:52:23,706
Speaker 1: I would say oh I never would have thought to do that.

717
00:52:23,747 --> 00:52:25,477
Speaker 1: the guy's awesome for thinking of that first.

718
00:52:25,758 --> 00:52:32,900
Speaker 0: well the way He did it was he instead of being Jameson He made a Jameson, and he pulled it around and he dressed up himself as Jameson's assistant.

719
00:52:34,441 --> 00:52:35,023
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

720
00:52:35,404 --> 00:52:40,280
Speaker 0: yeah, no I gotta give props again to the Bato because he did the perfect Bato smile.

721
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,365
Speaker 0: There's also this little kid.

722
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:50,102
Speaker 0: he was seven years old and he was dressed up as a very good cute link Man.

723
00:52:50,162 --> 00:52:52,309
Speaker 1: all the little kid cosplays kind of freaked me out.

724
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:58,919
Speaker 1: like when the mom is dragging around a little mega man a little proto Man, I'm always kind of like yay mega man and proto man.

725
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:03,651
Speaker 0: Well at least in this case it was definitely this kid's idea.

726
00:53:03,671 --> 00:53:06,540
Speaker 0: this kid is all about link and all about anime.

727
00:53:07,021 --> 00:53:12,450
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, and his mom is like yeah, he's getting into this stuff, and I gave her some recommendations what to watch.

728
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:16,540
Speaker 0: Actually I talked to a lot of parents.

729
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,064
Speaker 0: Animasment is a very.

730
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:21,173
Speaker 0: it's probably the most family-friendly con I've ever seen.

731
00:53:21,715 --> 00:53:23,400
Speaker 1: really cos Otakon is pretty family-friendly.

732
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Speaker 1: They just keep the families sequestered in like one or two rooms far away from all the craziness.

733
00:53:28,861 --> 00:53:35,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean you couldn't just let a 13 year old wander Otakon without worrying as a lot of people do.

734
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:37,274
Speaker 0: but yeah But a lot of people don't.

735
00:53:37,295 --> 00:53:39,425
Speaker 0: yeah Otakon is a mess in one.

736
00:53:39,445 --> 00:53:41,936
Speaker 0: you couldn't really drag a seven-year-old around Otakon.

737
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:42,880
Speaker 0: They would get crushed.

738
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:45,030
Speaker 1: That's why you bring them to the little Oda kindergarten.

739
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,015
Speaker 0: Yep, Oda.

740
00:53:46,036 --> 00:53:46,840
Speaker 0: I forget what they call it.

741
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,408
Speaker 1: I always I also forget what they call it.

742
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:49,393
Speaker 1: They call it Oda something.

743
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:55,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a name Oda kids Oda-chan Oda-chan, that's it, but animasment.

744
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,180
Speaker 0: There were a lot of parents there who were taking their kids to their first anime con.

745
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:03,300
Speaker 1: Now remember at ubercon we talked to that cool dad.

746
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read a Scrooge comics, but I in.

747
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:07,860
Speaker 0: I talked to a whole bunch of parents.

748
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:12,070
Speaker 0: I interviewed a bunch of them about it and Overwhelmingly they were all.

749
00:54:12,171 --> 00:54:16,530
Speaker 0: all they could say is that None of them watched the anime like with few exceptions.

750
00:54:16,591 --> 00:54:19,460
Speaker 0: very most of the parents don't have any idea what this anime stuff is about.

751
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,119
Speaker 0: They're not interested in it at all But they know their kids are into it.

752
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:32,279
Speaker 0: They're happy their kids are into it because now that they've gone to these conventions They've seen that the kids who were into it seemed a very smart polite interesting not druggies not losers.

753
00:54:34,262 --> 00:54:40,727
Speaker 0: Half the parents said things along the lines of at least they're not into drugs They're just perverted now.

754
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:44,419
Speaker 1: I did find it interesting that- sex, praise, and infomania, and hormone enraged teens.

755
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:51,220
Speaker 0: None of the parents knew what yaoi and yuri and hentai were but their kids definitely did.

756
00:54:53,146 --> 00:55:00,920
Speaker 1: All I have to say is You should have told the parents what yuri yaoi and hentai meant.

757
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,864
Speaker 0: Nah, nah, cuz.

758
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:03,391
Speaker 0: I wasn't gonna do that to these kids.

759
00:55:03,652 --> 00:55:05,340
Speaker 0: These kids seem to have their stuff together.

760
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,124
Speaker 1: You know what?

761
00:55:06,165 --> 00:55:08,880
Speaker 1: We should do it to just one to see what happened.

762
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,597
Speaker 0: Wow, real like if you're as you're a daughter ever mentioned to you yaoi.

763
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:15,568
Speaker 0: She's like, oh, yeah She says it's her favorite book or whatever.

764
00:55:16,089 --> 00:55:17,193
Speaker 0: Do you know what yaoi is?

765
00:55:17,474 --> 00:55:19,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's robots and nurses and shit.

766
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:21,820
Speaker 1: I think you're really gonna like it.

767
00:55:24,423 --> 00:55:27,000
Speaker 0: We could do a whole bit on that explaining to parents what that is.

768
00:55:28,246 --> 00:55:29,883
Speaker 1: Maybe we should Like.

769
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:35,019
Speaker 1: it's a public service thing because the problem here is that it's a really big problem for manga.

770
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:38,493
Speaker 1: actually Is that because that's where most of the yaoi that's in this country is?

771
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:47,400
Speaker 1: it's not you know and hentai DVDs But hentai DVDs, you know, they check those but the yaoi manga isn't checked as much because people don't recognize.

772
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:53,420
Speaker 0: Well, you know what, how about we just do a show whenever we have a free Wednesday on like a parent's guide to anime?

773
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,303
Speaker 1: That'd be good.

774
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:55,488
Speaker 0: I think it'd be really good.

775
00:55:55,628 --> 00:56:09,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, the thing is is that Right now the yaoi is real and the shounen and I are popular with the teen girls but parents don't realize what the kids are buying and they're just like oh, it's all manga stuff.

776
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:20,254
Speaker 1: and if they real if someone sees then So, you know all manga might get a bad name because of the yaoi sneaking in you see.

777
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:34,588
Speaker 1: so in trying to avert this seeming inevitability of There being a big hate against manga like there's a big hate against video games, which are violent Yeah, we should try to you know inform parents.

778
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:35,972
Speaker 1: Not all of it is yaoi.

779
00:56:36,072 --> 00:56:38,138
Speaker 1: Just don't let your kid buy the shrink-wrap stuff.

780
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:40,916
Speaker 0: Yeah That's pretty much the best rule.

781
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:48,840
Speaker 0: Yep Now we I've talked a long time So I'm probably gonna try to wrap up this a little bit because I could talk for many hours about all the crazy things that happen.

782
00:56:49,763 --> 00:56:54,280
Speaker 0: I guess I'm gonna turn half of my stories from this con into geek fables for future Thursdays.

783
00:56:54,601 --> 00:57:01,337
Speaker 0: Great, because they're very generic and very just funny like my adventure of trying to get food with Evan on Friday.

784
00:57:01,357 --> 00:57:07,919
Speaker 0: Oh Food it turned into into like the worst ordeal of the entire convention.

785
00:57:08,681 --> 00:57:09,906
Speaker 1: Wasn't there a nearby food place?

786
00:57:10,287 --> 00:57:10,909
Speaker 0: Oh that we would.

787
00:57:11,632 --> 00:57:12,957
Speaker 0: I'll talk about it someday.

788
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:13,358
Speaker 0: Okay.

789
00:57:13,459 --> 00:57:14,303
Speaker 0: Oh good God.

790
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:19,243
Speaker 0: now to its credit it ended with me getting some good shawarma Shawarma, yeah.

791
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:24,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, but some highlights from my duty as security at one point.

792
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:34,540
Speaker 0: I heard a large group of people going You know getting louder and louder and louder.

793
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder what could be going on over there.

794
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:48,420
Speaker 0: I turn and I see a bunch of kids with a beach ball and some duct tape and some saran wrap and they're rolling this Beach ball around and then they come across some garbage and they tape it to the beach ball and they continue.

795
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:51,150
Speaker 1: At least they're keeping the con clean now.

796
00:57:51,251 --> 00:58:05,071
Speaker 0: I let him keep doing it because I'm basically Animasement is probably the laxest in terms of keeping kids out of it not out of trouble But keeping kids in line of any major con I've gone to.

797
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:08,140
Speaker 0: I mean they let the kids get away with a lot more.

798
00:58:08,621 --> 00:58:14,020
Speaker 0: They just really stop them if they do anything dangerous or stupid or anything that could cause a problem.

799
00:58:14,884 --> 00:58:18,369
Speaker 0: But if kids are just being loud They just kind of let him roam free and get it.

800
00:58:18,389 --> 00:58:20,980
Speaker 0: a lot of their systems and it was kind of refreshing.

801
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:31,099
Speaker 0: I mean I was allowed to let kids do things that I thought were cool that if they tried to pull that stuff at Otacon or Katsucon I have to stop him Like this katamari thing.

802
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,377
Speaker 0: Now I let him go and I forgot about it.

803
00:58:35,464 --> 00:58:39,560
Speaker 0: The next night the katamari ball had grown substantially.

804
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,171
Speaker 1: That's what katamaris tend to do.

805
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:50,200
Speaker 0: I Don't know how they fit it out the door of the hotel But apparently they're gonna take it to every con they go to for the rest of the summer.

806
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,705
Speaker 1: Who's gonna store it at their house?

807
00:58:51,906 --> 00:58:52,930
Speaker 0: Someone has a truck.

808
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,355
Speaker 0: They've got it all taken care of.

809
00:58:54,435 --> 00:58:55,840
Speaker 0: like I interviewed the kid about it.

810
00:58:56,163 --> 00:58:57,539
Speaker 0: They have got this planned.

811
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:00,479
Speaker 1: We'll see how good they are You know?

812
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:02,628
Speaker 1: That's how you tell the quality of people.

813
00:59:03,090 --> 00:59:03,492
Speaker 1: is you come?

814
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:08,920
Speaker 1: if it was us making that katamari ball You would see that katamari ball at every goddamn convention.

815
00:59:10,102 --> 00:59:11,366
Speaker 1: We would have a storage shack.

816
00:59:11,446 --> 00:59:11,947
Speaker 1: rent it out.

817
00:59:12,288 --> 00:59:13,472
Speaker 1: But that's how you tell.

818
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:16,823
Speaker 1: is if someone sucks then they'll say yeah We're gonna do this.

819
00:59:16,843 --> 00:59:18,931
Speaker 1: They'll come up with a plan and then they won't.

820
00:59:19,011 --> 00:59:20,456
Speaker 1: it'll fall apart and just crumble.

821
00:59:20,476 --> 00:59:21,360
Speaker 1: That's sucky people.

822
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:29,078
Speaker 0: Yep, so my litmus test here is I'm not going to search for them But if I hear about their katamari ball again, I will consider them a success.

823
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,241
Speaker 1: Yep I agree.

824
00:59:30,963 --> 00:59:37,049
Speaker 0: now at one point some kids formed a conga line And it was like ten people.

825
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:39,840
Speaker 0: so whatever I let him go and they're doing their little thing.

826
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,306
Speaker 1: It came back as a hundred people.

827
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:47,020
Speaker 0: it came back because the con was this long long line Basically, and everything was this long line long hallway.

828
00:59:47,844 --> 00:59:51,300
Speaker 0: It went to the end of the con and turned around and now it was a danger.

829
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:57,020
Speaker 0: Now it was a mob that was running at full tilt in a conga line fashion.

830
00:59:57,462 --> 00:59:59,590
Speaker 1: Whoa, whoa, they can't run in a conga line.

831
00:59:59,611 --> 01:00:01,880
Speaker 1: You haven't had the nice slow cool.

832
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:07,180
Speaker 0: It was basically a line of fans kind of holding out of each other's backs running full bore.

833
01:00:07,442 --> 01:00:08,087
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

834
01:00:08,349 --> 01:00:09,680
Speaker 0: growing and growing and growing.

835
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:12,294
Speaker 1: You're supposed to do the conga and the guy in front needs maracas.

836
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:20,839
Speaker 0: now at this point I could not catch them because while I can run faster than a crowd like that I can't run faster than a crowd like that through a crowd.

837
01:00:22,582 --> 01:00:24,171
Speaker 0: And I was yelling at the end of it.

838
01:00:24,211 --> 01:00:30,027
Speaker 0: Like I cut off like I caught the end of it I was like you please just stop and Luckily, they were all still going.

839
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,820
Speaker 0: so I basically set up like a mirror.

840
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:34,810
Speaker 0: They were running toward one end of the con.

841
01:00:35,071 --> 01:00:36,599
Speaker 0: There was a dead end over there.

842
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:44,898
Speaker 0: So I ran over and I waited and it hit the wall and if it was gonna turn around I was gonna be like all right, you had your fun, that's enough.

843
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:52,579
Speaker 0: and Luckily, they ran into the wall and kind of derailed into a mass Mm-hmm and it all collapsed.

844
01:00:53,306 --> 01:01:02,219
Speaker 0: uh-huh, and Actually later on like Saturday because this happened Friday night I was talking to another staffer and they came up and they were like, can we do the conga line again?

845
01:01:03,002 --> 01:01:05,219
Speaker 0: And she had the most brilliant idea.

846
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:12,180
Speaker 0: She said yeah, you know what if you guys can get one going around the entire outside of the hotel.

847
01:01:13,141 --> 01:01:14,125
Speaker 0: That'd be really awesome.

848
01:01:14,606 --> 01:01:16,393
Speaker 0: And I didn't see those kids for like an hour.

849
01:01:16,413 --> 01:01:17,477
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

850
01:01:17,577 --> 01:01:18,340
Speaker 0: That was brilliant.

851
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,617
Speaker 1: Did they actually get it going around the outside of the hotel?

852
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:21,060
Speaker 0: You know what?

853
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:24,219
Speaker 0: I don't actually know but they tried which meant they weren't bothering me.

854
01:01:26,961 --> 01:01:32,077
Speaker 0: At one point a bunch of guys decided to have their own mini rave, you know every con has the dance.

855
01:01:32,137 --> 01:01:32,939
Speaker 0: well every big con.

856
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:39,221
Speaker 0: They had a little boombox and they set up in the middle of a hallway and started having a dance just in the middle of The day.

857
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:41,146
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it was awesome.

858
01:01:41,507 --> 01:01:45,378
Speaker 0: Except for the fact that it was completely blocking off any sort of traffic.

859
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:52,783
Speaker 0: Oh, no Now I walked over and I was like guys guys guys guys and they all look at me and the music turns off with this Look of like.

860
01:01:53,245 --> 01:01:54,531
Speaker 0: you're not gonna stop us.

861
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:55,174
Speaker 0: Are you?

862
01:01:55,194 --> 01:02:01,567
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah And I was like You guys are awesome.

863
01:02:01,928 --> 01:02:05,140
Speaker 0: Could you take it around the corners of that big open space and do whatever you want?

864
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:12,860
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I've never seen kids be that like thankful and happy and they put on a cool little party for another hour at least.

865
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:14,560
Speaker 1: Oh, no, wait a minute.

866
01:02:18,057 --> 01:02:24,680
Speaker 0: Now Another group of people I believe this was Saturday or Sunday They decided that they were going to have this out of the blue.

867
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:30,560
Speaker 0: They did this and they stood in the middle of a big hallway area and they started having a revivalist church meeting.

868
01:02:31,442 --> 01:02:32,085
Speaker 1: Now you tell me this.

869
01:02:32,146 --> 01:02:33,473
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sounds pretty terrible.

870
01:02:33,734 --> 01:02:34,740
Speaker 1: That is pretty terrible.

871
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,940
Speaker 0: But no, it was actually a revivalist Church of the elite master.

872
01:02:40,742 --> 01:02:42,574
Speaker 1: Wait a minute the Church of the master.

873
01:02:42,594 --> 01:02:48,019
Speaker 0: No I Don't think we ever told the story of the Church of the master on this show.

874
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:51,778
Speaker 1: No, we're tells the church story of the Church of the master in the future.

875
01:02:51,919 --> 01:02:56,277
Speaker 0: Yep That'll be a geek fable because the moral will be we should have bought the Church of the master.

876
01:02:56,538 --> 01:02:59,491
Speaker 1: Yes Should have bought the church.

877
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,980
Speaker 1: real immorality.

878
01:03:01,726 --> 01:03:03,600
Speaker 1: You should have bought the Church of the master.

879
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:09,960
Speaker 0: But what they were doing is they set up this little congregation and they did like a typical like southern revivalist thing.

880
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:12,345
Speaker 1: Only can I get a can.

881
01:03:12,385 --> 01:03:24,800
Speaker 0: I get an OM Jesus and it was all funny and silly and and totally in elite speak Like one of them would read a serious sounding scripture II thing and then the other guy would be like OMG WTF Abraham.

882
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was just.

883
01:03:27,028 --> 01:03:29,060
Speaker 0: it was really hilarious and I give props to these guys.

884
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,724
Speaker 0: they they.

885
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:37,899
Speaker 0: they also said I interviewed them that they're going to try and Go around to other conventions and do the same thing and try to make it a thing.

886
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:39,699
Speaker 0: I give them the best of luck.

887
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:46,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as they're not using it as a Trojan to actually get some religion going on It's all good.

888
01:03:46,803 --> 01:03:47,264
Speaker 0: Luckily.

889
01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:51,596
Speaker 0: One of the guys involved was that way because I was trying to Trojan horse it.

890
01:03:51,937 --> 01:04:00,200
Speaker 0: Yes now Fortunately the rest of the people involved seemed very much of the mind that this is just funny and cool and no more than that.

891
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,490
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah.

892
01:04:05,285 --> 01:04:09,379
Speaker 0: And then An amazement as one awesome thing that they do.

893
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:16,640
Speaker 0: You know every con the most painful experience ever is getting in line for the big event or getting in line for the cosplay.

894
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,988
Speaker 1: No, cuz I don't get in line for the.

895
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,719
Speaker 0: well you get in line for the big event.

896
01:04:20,181 --> 01:04:22,910
Speaker 0: It depends like the laraku concert.

897
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,996
Speaker 1: Well, that wasn't really a line.

898
01:04:25,037 --> 01:04:26,080
Speaker 0: That was a line.

899
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:27,710
Speaker 0: The fact that was

900
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:28,678
Speaker 1: there like a snake

901
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:31,476
Speaker 0: An amazement has a general no lines

902
01:04:31,496 --> 01:04:31,879
Speaker 1: policy

903
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:51,495
Speaker 0: And the way they did the seating for the cosplay and the musical was that they they said gave everyone who wanted numbers to get into the cosplay like Otakon you have a sticker and At like 10 o'clock in the morning on Saturday you can go to this desk at any time and get a sticker and the sticker has a number one.

904
01:04:51,575 --> 01:05:03,986
Speaker 0: through like seven and an hour before the cosplay or an hour before the musical they'll set up these big poles that have numbers in the top from outside the Otakon and you were guaranteed to.

905
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:17,028
Speaker 0: if you if you have a number one, you can stand by the number one and When they form the line for the cosplay they take all the number ones first Then they take the number twos then they take the number threes So you don't have to stand in line.

906
01:05:17,048 --> 01:05:19,118
Speaker 0: you just go over to your number right before they take them in.

907
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:22,734
Speaker 0: Mmm, that way you're standing in line without standing in line.

908
01:05:23,216 --> 01:05:24,039
Speaker 0: It worked really well.

909
01:05:24,942 --> 01:05:30,672
Speaker 0: The only drawback was that the musical is delayed somewhat For various technical difficulties.

910
01:05:31,397 --> 01:05:38,340
Speaker 0: as a result I was standing outside and I realized that I was pretty much for a bit of time the only staffer anywhere.

911
01:05:38,521 --> 01:05:41,019
Speaker 0: There was a large increasingly unruly mob.

912
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:43,907
Speaker 0: So I did what any sane man would do.

913
01:05:43,927 --> 01:05:56,560
Speaker 0: I climbed a tree and from there dealt with the crowd And I learned that there is one and only one way to get the attention of a crowd of geeks and that is to yell Leroy.

914
01:05:57,641 --> 01:06:00,932
Speaker 1: There are other ways but you do something akin to Leroy.

915
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:03,360
Speaker 0: it were it worked so well, it was amazing.

916
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,846
Speaker 0: I couldn't get their attention.

917
01:06:04,866 --> 01:06:15,814
Speaker 0: So finally I yelled Leroy and half the crowd yells Jenkins and then they all looked around to try to figure out who yelled Leroy and then they all saw me and then I could Do what I needed to do.

918
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:24,060
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I got to say that is the point at which I became a semi celebrity among the people of the con.

919
01:06:24,545 --> 01:06:28,267
Speaker 0: Because being in the tree I had people call me such thing first.

920
01:06:28,328 --> 01:06:29,230
Speaker 0: I was the tree guy.

921
01:06:29,812 --> 01:06:32,320
Speaker 0: then some a bunch of girls started calling me the tree bishi.

922
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:34,466
Speaker 0: That was very fun.

923
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:42,815
Speaker 0: One girl gave me the second oddest compliment I've ever been given in a public place where her and her a second oddest.

924
01:06:43,216 --> 01:06:43,517
Speaker 0: Yes.

925
01:06:43,537 --> 01:06:47,049
Speaker 0: I Was told that that I look like some guy.

926
01:06:47,129 --> 01:06:49,920
Speaker 0: she knows and I was like, well, how should I take that?

927
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:54,772
Speaker 0: She said well, he looks like an elf And I was like, all right, that's a compliment right.

928
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:59,599
Speaker 0: and she's like yes very much Because you know, I have my long hair and I was like hanging in this tree.

929
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,129
Speaker 0: One group of people called me this bit of the be shown in Dryad quotes Exactly that some two girls wanted to.

930
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,120
Speaker 0: they took they posed with me and had someone else take pictures.

931
01:07:11,802 --> 01:07:13,348
Speaker 0: I signed an autograph for someone.

932
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:15,595
Speaker 0: someone took a video of me standing in the tree.

933
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:17,865
Speaker 1: I Don't know what it is like.

934
01:07:18,448 --> 01:07:19,715
Speaker 0: it was just a really good climbing tree.

935
01:07:19,755 --> 01:07:21,503
Speaker 0: like it had a nice spot I could stand on.

936
01:07:21,523 --> 01:07:23,690
Speaker 1: Oh stand so a pretty big branch.

937
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:26,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, and at one point I had a megaphone up there.

938
01:07:26,821 --> 01:07:28,105
Speaker 1: How high was the lowest branch?

939
01:07:28,486 --> 01:07:30,733
Speaker 0: Oh, the lowest branch was about like shoulder height.

940
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,478
Speaker 0: Oh really above shoulder.

941
01:07:32,498 --> 01:07:33,080
Speaker 1: That's like great.

942
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,891
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the perfect climbing tree.

943
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:35,957
Speaker 1: That's like perfect.

944
01:07:36,379 --> 01:07:39,460
Speaker 1: now I know it's not so low that it's like a stepping stone, you know.

945
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:39,701
Speaker 1: Like.

946
01:07:39,721 --> 01:07:45,100
Speaker 1: it's like it's a staircase made of branches, but it's not so high that you have to do a pull-up to get on there.

947
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,560
Speaker 0: Yeah now second oddest compliment.

948
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:50,968
Speaker 0: Now that's a statement that warrants some sort of explanation.

949
01:07:51,028 --> 01:07:58,120
Speaker 0: I assume I was once complimented by someone at RIT Who said to me and I quote exactly?

950
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:06,099
Speaker 0: You walk like a vampire All right, and she meant it as a compliment.

951
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,970
Speaker 0: Mmm, freaky freaky.

952
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:14,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, I found that interesting Freaky larpers and to this day, I'm still not sure.

953
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,538
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm still not sure what that means.

954
01:08:17,384 --> 01:08:19,678
Speaker 1: It means freaky larpers wanted to you.

955
01:08:22,069 --> 01:08:28,639
Speaker 1: So to me Yeah run away very quickly because they want to take their golden goblet and put your blood in it and drink it.

956
01:08:29,201 --> 01:08:40,013
Speaker 0: Yep, but I got to say it was real fun to have a crowd to you know muck with and actually other staffers arrived at at some point to help me and Then they did their awesome thing.

957
01:08:40,053 --> 01:08:41,220
Speaker 0: the staff were all really awesome.

958
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,812
Speaker 0: Like if any of you are listening to this I have to give props.

959
01:08:43,872 --> 01:08:47,225
Speaker 0: you guys pulled off one hell of a con Especially considering how few of you there were.

960
01:08:47,246 --> 01:08:52,100
Speaker 1: I remember before the con you were skeptical of the intelligence of the staff that you'd never met.

961
01:08:52,721 --> 01:08:57,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz when I basically when I haven't met people who run like an event you assume they're stupid.

962
01:08:57,962 --> 01:09:01,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly because most events I've gone to were run terribly.

963
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:04,060
Speaker 0: The staff at an amazement are badass.

964
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:07,066
Speaker 1: Huh most events are run terribly.

965
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:09,112
Speaker 1: there are some people running some event.

966
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:11,179
Speaker 1: those people must be terrible.

967
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:13,468
Speaker 0: Yep But then they'll prove it.

968
01:09:13,508 --> 01:09:18,082
Speaker 0: Otherwise, yeah, we'll look at the New York comic-con Comic-con.

969
01:09:18,103 --> 01:09:22,459
Speaker 1: your comic-con is run by a company that runs conventions and you know what they suck.

970
01:09:25,301 --> 01:09:31,832
Speaker 0: It's funny how the people who volunteer and do it just because they love doing it are always better than the people who are paid To do it.

971
01:09:32,662 --> 01:09:33,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wonder.

972
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:36,078
Speaker 0: well, no, I don't wonder I know exactly why that is open.

973
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:43,700
Speaker 0: so Actually to explain to some of the people at my new work because I was trying to explain wait a minute.

974
01:09:44,081 --> 01:09:54,010
Speaker 0: So you paid to fly to Raleigh so you could work security and talk at a convention Mm-hmm, and they didn't pay you to do this.

975
01:09:54,029 --> 01:09:54,974
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

976
01:09:55,235 --> 01:09:56,260
Speaker 0: Why would you do that?

977
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,925
Speaker 0: It's fun, yeah, but the you know, why what?

978
01:09:59,985 --> 01:10:02,068
Speaker 0: why would I do work like that for other people?

979
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:03,030
Speaker 0: they people just don't get it.

980
01:10:06,521 --> 01:10:14,413
Speaker 0: Now the last thing I'd really like to talk about at an amazement is I Wouldn't say was the highlight of the con because I couldn't really pick out one highlight.

981
01:10:14,453 --> 01:10:24,915
Speaker 0: I had a freaking amazing time and Amazing, but last year they did I promised I would say an amazing at every day of this week.

982
01:10:25,196 --> 01:10:26,019
Speaker 0: So I said it again.

983
01:10:26,982 --> 01:10:30,347
Speaker 0: but The previous year they did a musical.

984
01:10:30,808 --> 01:10:34,518
Speaker 0: people got together and did a full-on musical to Evangelion.

985
01:10:34,558 --> 01:10:37,938
Speaker 0: That was supposedly hilarious.

986
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:41,894
Speaker 0: as A result they decided to do one this year and he talked about this.

987
01:10:41,914 --> 01:10:42,596
Speaker 1: Do you think of the day?

988
01:10:43,158 --> 01:10:43,640
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I did.

989
01:10:43,922 --> 01:10:44,306
Speaker 0: That's right.

990
01:10:44,771 --> 01:10:49,711
Speaker 0: Well anyway To summer because I said I talked more about it.

991
01:10:50,274 --> 01:10:51,017
Speaker 0: It was called at.

992
01:10:52,223 --> 01:10:55,900
Speaker 0: It seemed like a good idea at the time and you know, this con was called an amazement.

993
01:10:56,241 --> 01:11:05,660
Speaker 0: so they did this parody musical about running a convention called animosity and It was utterly utterly hilarious.

994
01:11:06,122 --> 01:11:10,640
Speaker 0: I didn't get to interview the people who actually did it because I only ran into they actually have songs.

995
01:11:10,901 --> 01:11:12,225
Speaker 0: Yes, they were good.

996
01:11:12,305 --> 01:11:17,000
Speaker 1: any spoken lines or was it all singing spoken lines and singing like a typical Broadway musical?

997
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,967
Speaker 0: All right And the scene changes were actually the funny.

998
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:23,117
Speaker 0: the scene changes convinced consistent entirely of this.

999
01:11:23,217 --> 01:11:30,170
Speaker 0: lights would go down They would move this potted plant from one part of the stage to another part and the lights would come back on with different people standing around.

1000
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:42,502
Speaker 0: yeah There is supposedly going to be a DVD or a video of the entire Musical and I will let you all know when that appears because this was freaking hilarious Mm-hmm.

1001
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:43,584
Speaker 0: I really can't.

1002
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:56,509
Speaker 1: I've heard tale of similar things at other conventions and they're very popular because it's like most Cosplays are a ragtag bunch of guys throw something together at the last second with people They met at the con

1003
01:11:56,833 --> 01:12:01,440
Speaker 0: or they're the crazy Professionals who can't do much because you only get a minute and 30 seconds to do your skin.

1004
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,664
Speaker 1: You can't control the lighting.

1005
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:03,568
Speaker 1: You can't control the art.

1006
01:12:03,588 --> 01:12:03,829
Speaker 1: You can't.

1007
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:05,193
Speaker 1: you can barely control anything.

1008
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:14,080
Speaker 1: All you got is like a CD Costumes maybe a set piece if you can move it really quickly, you know, so it's got to be made of cardboard.

1009
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,999
Speaker 1: I mean remember the awesome Muppet Revolution thing at Otacon.

1010
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:21,860
Speaker 1: Yep Whip it out and run through the skit so fast.

1011
01:12:23,363 --> 01:12:28,040
Speaker 0: Any other choice, you know, see there's another nice thing in the musical, you know, they did the AMV thing.

1012
01:12:28,605 --> 01:12:34,874
Speaker 0: they also made fun of the cosplay and For that they had a whole bunch of actual cosplayers.

1013
01:12:34,954 --> 01:12:45,294
Speaker 1: do actual cosplay skits Which were ended with hilarity Because they were I mentioned they were commenting on the cosplay seats on yes.

1014
01:12:45,615 --> 01:12:45,937
Speaker 0: Yes.

1015
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,475
Speaker 1: Wow, that's Yeah.

1016
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:51,769
Speaker 1: So is that all your an amazement action?

1017
01:12:52,412 --> 01:13:00,580
Speaker 0: Actually while I have a lot more I could say I'll probably just hold off and talk about them as stories in general as opposed to coverage of an amazement.

1018
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:06,789
Speaker 0: All right, and while I also have all the interviews I did at an amazement We don't have a Windows computer to get.

1019
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:09,518
Speaker 0: the interview was off so I can put them in this episode.

1020
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:10,060
Speaker 1: All right.

1021
01:13:10,481 --> 01:13:12,408
Speaker 0: So because they were mostly generic.

1022
01:13:12,468 --> 01:13:16,040
Speaker 0: I didn't ask so much about an amazement, but I asked about anime cons in general.

1023
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:19,360
Speaker 0: Whenever I get a chance I will use them for that.

1024
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,600
Speaker 0: I asked a lot of people why they go to anime conventions and I got a lot of very interesting answers.

1025
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:29,500
Speaker 1: You should send them over to those animal order guys so you can do his search for the truth business that he keeps doing.

1026
01:13:29,942 --> 01:13:34,077
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, or in the very least I'll do a bit about my version of the truth and send it to him.

1027
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:36,051
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that'll be a good idea.

1028
01:13:36,071 --> 01:13:38,324
Speaker 1: So yeah It's even better idea cuz.

1029
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:43,562
Speaker 0: I interviewed a lot of people at an amazement and send him like rims search for the truth at an amazement.

1030
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:45,249
Speaker 0: the interviews were mostly awesome.

1031
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:50,750
Speaker 0: almost everyone I ran into was great and Other than one guy who these two guys?

1032
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:56,012
Speaker 0: I tried to interview him and they were really excited and one guy was giving me a normal Interview and they were both normal people like.

1033
01:13:56,033 --> 01:13:57,360
Speaker 0: they were smart cool people.

1034
01:13:58,264 --> 01:14:01,899
Speaker 0: One guy and he's from the Carolinas like he's a local but he didn't have much of an accent.

1035
01:14:02,702 --> 01:14:11,787
Speaker 0: Once I turned the mic on he started talking in the most horrid backwater like Southern Alabama accent I've ever heard some folk don't ever.

1036
01:14:11,867 --> 01:14:14,455
Speaker 0: he's gonna bet against some focal likely.

1037
01:14:14,475 --> 01:14:16,200
Speaker 0: It is the slack shot yokel.

1038
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:20,597
Speaker 1: Hey mom get off her damn roof.

1039
01:14:20,617 --> 01:14:23,749
Speaker 0: oh Dang it.

1040
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,648
Speaker 0: But the guy was doing it on purpose and afterward.

1041
01:14:26,668 --> 01:14:29,920
Speaker 0: He said something like hey, maybe it'll scare the yanks away from the con.

1042
01:14:30,323 --> 01:14:34,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he was really funny and cool And he was just basically making fun of.

1043
01:14:34,406 --> 01:14:45,119
Speaker 0: he was making fun of people who live down there who don't understand anime cons By pretending to be one of them, but once I turn the mic off He turned back to a normal person and told me what he really thought.

1044
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:54,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right This weekend as in June 4th I guess yeah give or take.

Speaker 0: We're gonna be like kind of press, but without any of the press credentials.

1050
01:15:15,461 --> 01:15:19,794
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna be walking around and we're gonna talk to some other podcasters.

1051
01:15:19,834 --> 01:15:20,617
Speaker 1: That'll be there.

1052
01:15:20,657 --> 01:15:22,826
Speaker 1: We'll be with our friends We'll be buying comic books.

1053
01:15:22,846 --> 01:15:24,012
Speaker 0: We'll be interviewing people.

1054
01:15:24,072 --> 01:15:25,500
Speaker 1: We'll be talking to comic book guys.

1055
01:15:26,882 --> 01:15:29,300
Speaker 1: You know we'll be go won't go to any panels.

1056
01:15:29,501 --> 01:15:35,020
Speaker 0: We might not even say they're all day cuz it's not the biggest con yeah And we'll just jump over to the Jersey Shore as soon as we're done.

1057
01:15:35,062 --> 01:15:36,965
Speaker 1: Yeah We're gonna make like the once through.

1058
01:15:36,985 --> 01:15:44,250
Speaker 1: then we'll make the twice through where you go digging through all the 50 cent bins and the Dollar bins for the cheap comics, and then we're out.

1059
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:54,553
Speaker 1: so if you are near the Philadelphia's Then head on over there to the little tiny Comic convention in the big Philadelphia Convention Center.

1060
01:15:54,573 --> 01:15:57,424
Speaker 1: yep, and on Sunday Don't look for us.

1061
01:15:57,484 --> 01:15:58,007
Speaker 1: and on Friday.

1062
01:15:58,027 --> 01:16:00,579
Speaker 1: Don't look for us because we will be at the beach.

1063
01:16:01,201 --> 01:16:03,788
Speaker 1: Haha cuz Andy juggernaut the beach.

1064
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,753
Speaker 0: that was dumb.

1065
01:16:05,933 --> 01:16:07,236
Speaker 1: Don't worry dad.

1066
01:16:07,798 --> 01:16:18,621
Speaker 1: I couldn't resist And come on comic convention juggernaut beach get it Fuck you Yeah.

1067
01:16:19,122 --> 01:16:29,845
Speaker 0: now my final thoughts on an amazement because my coverage was again kind of fractured partly because I Originally intended to go solely as a panelist and as a press guy.

1068
01:16:29,946 --> 01:16:45,497
Speaker 0: you know my coverage of the con Because I ended up being staff and doing all the awesome stuff and like this is being staff the whole time I Didn't get to cover the con so much as I was a part of it Which is something I didn't expect to do.

1069
01:16:45,979 --> 01:16:52,614
Speaker 0: so I didn't really have any of the notes or anything I usually take when I go to a con Mm-hmm.

1070
01:16:52,815 --> 01:16:56,097
Speaker 0: so I can promise you that least our coverage of the next few cons We go to will be much more.

1071
01:16:56,137 --> 01:17:01,120
Speaker 1: I guess regimented yep Because like I said this weekend wizard word Philly.

1072
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,967
Speaker 1: the weekend after that nothing.

1073
01:17:03,088 --> 01:17:05,878
Speaker 1: yet The weekend after that anime.

1074
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:09,008
Speaker 1: next we'll probably be going to at least one day of anime next.

1075
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:09,530
Speaker 0: yep.

1076
01:17:09,831 --> 01:17:18,658
Speaker 0: And of course when Otacon comes not only are we going, but we are doing a full-on geek night's show there Now at Otacon.

1077
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,265
Speaker 1: and well it's a hundred.

1078
01:17:20,346 --> 01:17:20,687
Speaker 1: it's 90% confirmed.

1079
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:35,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, 90% concerned, and I'll tell you this if we somehow don't have our geek night show for whatever reason I'm still doing the anime club summit extravaganza Yep, and in addition always do our geek night show in the hallway in where there's no people walking around.

1080
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:36,010
Speaker 0: yeah.

1081
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:45,950
Speaker 1: so Also, so you know we're gonna be like every day of Otacon and the week after that is the quote-unquote week of awesome.

1082
01:17:46,251 --> 01:17:50,630
Speaker 0: We're not sure exactly how we're going to handle geek nights that week because there's no internet content.

1083
01:17:50,630 --> 01:18:03,290
Speaker 1: We might prepare like for best of episodes and have them automatically post each day Or we might not do podcast that week or we might podcast from the week of awesome.

1084
01:18:04,232 --> 01:18:12,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you know when jeopardy is on like you know not where it usually is and it's somewhere else We might get a little bit on the beach.

1085
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:13,336
Speaker 0: We might get someone we know.

1086
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:23,081
Speaker 0: if we don't have any way to get internet connectivity easily We'll just call in on our cell phones every day to a friend who has Skype to record it And then have them upload it and everything.

1087
01:18:23,545 --> 01:18:24,330
Speaker 1: That's a little crazy.

1088
01:18:24,672 --> 01:18:25,436
Speaker 0: That's not so bad.

1089
01:18:25,898 --> 01:18:27,667
Speaker 0: just do a short like like penny arcade.

1090
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:32,592
Speaker 0: when they go to cons They do the sketches will do the sketches on the audio I Guess.

1091
01:18:32,632 --> 01:18:33,698
Speaker 0: yeah, we'll see.

1092
01:18:33,939 --> 01:18:35,205
Speaker 0: we got a long time to plan that out.

1093
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:45,209
Speaker 0: we do and I can tell you with certainty that I will be at an amazement next year And there's a decent chance that we'll be doing a full-on show there a geek night show.

1094
01:18:45,751 --> 01:18:49,686
Speaker 1: Alright, let's see how many conventions we can do geek night shows at.

1095
01:18:49,747 --> 01:18:49,907
Speaker 0: well.

1096
01:18:49,947 --> 01:18:51,553
Speaker 0: Let's see so far It's gonna be Otakon.

1097
01:18:51,653 --> 01:18:53,339
Speaker 0: an amazement on katsu khan.

1098
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,610
Speaker 1: We got to start hitting up some non anime conventions.

1099
01:18:57,031 --> 01:18:58,415
Speaker 1: We got uber khan.

1100
01:18:58,876 --> 01:18:59,397
Speaker 1: Let's go first.

1101
01:18:59,478 --> 01:19:01,463
Speaker 1: Let's go for a couple more gaming conventions.

1102
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:03,890
Speaker 0: Oh people talk really well of dragon khan.

1103
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:06,466
Speaker 0: Where is it somewhere far away great?

1104
01:19:07,831 --> 01:19:10,630
Speaker 1: Is that origins which I'd like to go to but that's kind of far away.

1105
01:19:10,770 --> 01:19:15,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one of those moving cons where it's in a different location all the time.

1106
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:16,334
Speaker 0: You know what I don't actually know.

1107
01:19:16,374 --> 01:19:20,490
Speaker 1: I've never been to origins like don't bot khan and gen khan move around all the time.

1108
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:22,398
Speaker 0: Gen khan is complicated.

1109
01:19:22,438 --> 01:19:32,522
Speaker 0: I don't know what the state of gen khan is now, but it used to be it exists it's big it used to be in Wisconsin and or Europe and it's England, Wisconsin and somewhere else.

1110
01:19:32,562 --> 01:19:32,883
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1111
01:19:33,164 --> 01:19:37,922
Speaker 0: I don't know what the deal is with it anymore Mainly because that kind of khan is not my bag usually.

1112
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,570
Speaker 0: yeah neither comic cons.

1113
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:43,310
Speaker 0: So I think I'll have Scott do any of the interviewing we do this weekend.

1114
01:19:44,311 --> 01:19:48,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, because my interviews would consist of so why the hell do you read comics?

1115
01:19:48,805 --> 01:19:50,250
Speaker 0: Why do they bold every other word?

1116
01:19:50,790 --> 01:19:52,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's wrong with Stan Lee?

1117
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,787
Speaker 0: Does he not have a dictionary then?

1118
01:19:55,371 --> 01:19:56,421
Speaker 0: Maybe a thesaurus.

1119
01:19:56,845 --> 01:20:03,640
Speaker 1: Yeah No, even I'm not too good with the comics, you know I walk around and there really are beside.

1120
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,727
Speaker 1: I think Kevin Smith is gonna be there besides him.

1121
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:06,550
Speaker 1: I don't really know.

1122
01:20:07,233 --> 01:20:08,803
Speaker 1: Well, no, actually, you know who we can interview.

1123
01:20:08,823 --> 01:20:17,498
Speaker 1: That'll be awesome Like the brothers Cubert are gonna be there and one of them Studied medical illustration at RIT.

1124
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,146
Speaker 1: So wait if I can remember which one it's either Andy or Adam Which one went to RIT we can talk to him.

1125
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:23,670
Speaker 1: It'll be cool.

1126
01:20:26,277 --> 01:20:30,610
Speaker 0: So in closing animasement is fan-fucking-tastic.

1127
01:20:31,492 --> 01:20:34,082
Speaker 0: I cannot express to you enough how much I enjoyed this khan.

1128
01:20:34,524 --> 01:20:40,950
