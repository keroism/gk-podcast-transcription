1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,867
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday, February 25th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,867 --> 00:00:13,030
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,433
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:24,500
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight because all you haters were talking about augmented reality in light of Google Glass and a super long intro bit just to make Scott mad.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,360
Speaker 0: I was about to comment on the super long intro bit, and now I'm making it longer.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,398
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:41,718
Speaker 1: You know, Scott, what they say, "If you wrestle with a pig, you only make the pig happy and you get just as

8
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:41,959
Speaker 1: muddy.".

9
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:49,419
Speaker 0: I think what they say is, "If you let Rem know the thing he does that bothers you, he will do it

10
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:49,880
Speaker 0: nonstop.".

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:56,160
Speaker 1: Ah, but it's a catch-22, for if you do not let me know that it bothers you, then I will keep doing it because that's what I do.

12
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,439
Speaker 1: And if you let me know, I'll keep doing it because that's what I do.

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,600
Speaker 0: But you'll do it in a more goading fashion.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:09,340
Speaker 1: So in fact, the more you express disdain or criticism for a thing I do that you don't like, the more I'll do it.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,980
Speaker 1: If you just never complain, I'll still do it, but at a baseline, manageable level.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,203
Speaker 0: There's only one solution.

17
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:23,278
Speaker 0: Instead of letting Rem know that the thing bothers you, you must do something that bothers him whenever he does something that bothers you.

18
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,680
Speaker 1: Except the only thing you ever do that I can even think of.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,260
Speaker 0: And eventually you can reverse Pavlov's dog him.

20
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:45,140
Speaker 1: The best thing I've ever had Scott do is whenever we're ready to start a video or a show or anything, he'll just sit there going like... So I don't have a clean start, then I have to do some editing bullshit when we actually... It's too late, we're already recording.

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,920
Speaker 1: So I went skiing over the weekend, and I feel like I'm stepping up my ski game to a big degree.

22
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:53,639
Speaker 1: But I saw something kind of funny.

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,860
Speaker 1: So you saw that South Park episode about ziplining, right?

24
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:57,579
Speaker 0: Yup.

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,680
Speaker 1: You ever been ziplining?

26
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:04,100
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but not like that super ziplining, but like normal.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,377
Speaker 0: Like, oh, there's one zipline, I went down it, we...

28
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,200
Speaker 1: Okay, so basically, I went ziplining with Emily in Costa Rica, but that was awesome.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,040
Speaker 1: Because that was basically the only way to go through the rainforest and see all the inside business without hurting anything.

30
00:02:17,641 --> 00:02:19,160
Speaker 1: So that was just like crazy and awesome.

31
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:24,816
Speaker 1: But ziplining pretty much anywhere else is exactly like that South Park episode.

32
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,940
Speaker 1: It's just stupid.

33
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,260
Speaker 1: So at Hunter Mountain, where I go skiing every weekend, they have zipline tours.

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Speaker 1: I can't imagine those people terribly appreciated that South Park episode.

35
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,600
Speaker 1: I actually would expect that it hurt their business at least a little.

36
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:50,680
Speaker 1: But I saw, I was standing in line to go up the big lift up to the top of the mountain, and they stop it because six zipliners are going to take the lift up to do their ziplining thing on the ski mountain.

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,220
Speaker 1: So they stop the lift, because you can't get on a lift that's moving unless you're in skis or something.

38
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:57,199
Speaker 1: And these guys walk over and they sit down.

39
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Speaker 1: What I saw that was interesting was that five out of six of them had GoPros.

40
00:03:03,902 --> 00:03:04,198
Speaker 0: Okay.

41
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,580
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say that a full quarter of the people skiing had a GoPro on them.

42
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:13,340
Speaker 1: And easily a third of those people had the newest, newest GoPro.

43
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:17,500
Speaker 1: If GoPro sold stock, I would buy all of it.

44
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,519
Speaker 0: I don't know why they didn't sell it before when I had that idea months ago.

45
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,307
Speaker 1: I know exactly why.

46
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,840
Speaker 1: Because it sucks to be a public company in the modern world.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,619
Speaker 1: If I own a company, I will never go public.

48
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:31,460
Speaker 0: But it's such a no brainer to make mad money for me without having to do any work.

49
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:33,179
Speaker 0: Just buy GoPro stock.

50
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,104
Speaker 1: Exactly.

51
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,233
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

52
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:35,878
Speaker 1: It does not help them.

53
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,680
Speaker 1: It gives them a pile of money and a pile of obligations.

54
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,320
Speaker 0: Dude, with that pile of money, they can come out with an even crazier GoPro.

55
00:03:42,561 --> 00:03:43,619
Speaker 0: That would be so insanely good.

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, that's, in my opinion, that's what's wrong with our entire economy right now.

57
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:58,947
Speaker 1: If I have a company, like a video game company, and I make enough money to pay all my employees really well and keep doing what I'm doing and maybe do some things that I want to do that won't be profitable, that's all I want.

58
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:00,199
Speaker 1: I don't need more.

59
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:06,853
Speaker 1: I'd be happy to have a video game studio that could pay everyone enough to live in New York and have reasonable vacation time.

60
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:07,398
Speaker 1: That's all I want.

61
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,780
Speaker 1: But yeah, I skied, leveled up, I'm feeling good.

62
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,420
Speaker 1: They told me I have to take this one kind of special lesson, and they were very clear.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,820
Speaker 1: The instructor was like, "Look, you've kind of hit the top of how these sort of group lessons go.

64
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:22,797
Speaker 1: So come back and tell them you need

65
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:22,999
Speaker 1: this.".

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,719
Speaker 1: And she handed me a piece of paper and wrote a thing on it.

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,277
Speaker 1: And she's like, "If you ski every weekend for the rest of the year and you come back and ask for that lesson, you will be a semi-professional

68
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:31,499
Speaker 1: skier.".

69
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:32,639
Speaker 1: And I was very proud of that.

70
00:04:34,562 --> 00:04:34,847
Speaker 1: That's all.

71
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:35,660
Speaker 1: I'm just tooting my own horn.

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,960
Speaker 1: I was waiting for you to jump in with your own opening bit anecdote for today.

73
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,620
Speaker 0: Well, I just wanted to let everyone fully bask in how full of yourself you are.

74
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,334
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, you want to bask.

75
00:04:46,101 --> 00:04:47,956
Speaker 0: Your opening bit was basically, "I am so

76
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:48,219
Speaker 0: great.".

77
00:04:48,504 --> 00:04:48,775
Speaker 0: I am.

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,819
Speaker 1: More importantly, do any of you listeners live in this area and want to go ski with me?

79
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,575
Speaker 0: So at work today, some co-workers are talking.

80
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:58,520
Speaker 0: I wasn't really paying attention.

81
00:04:58,601 --> 00:04:59,187
Speaker 0: But a guy said,

82
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:00,258
Speaker 0: "Non-burrito.".

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,946
Speaker 0: And I was like,

84
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:01,572
Speaker 0: "Mmm.".

85
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,371
Speaker 1: Wait, non-burrito?

86
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:04,260
Speaker 1: Like not a burrito?

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,580
Speaker 0: Non, as in the bread from, you get an Indian restaurant.

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,710
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Hey, that sounds pretty good.

89
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:13,960
Speaker 0: You think I could put my leftover taco meat, which I have in the fridge right now, inside of a non?

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,817
Speaker 0: Because I could just go down to Rode Bode and get a fresh

91
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:16,100
Speaker 0: non.".

92
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,800
Speaker 1: Now I am quite the advocate of breaking the shackles of expected uses of food.

93
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,058
Speaker 0: Right, so they were like, "No, non-burrito is when you put Indian food in the non and then roll it up like a

94
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:26,500
Speaker 0: burrito.".

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,029
Speaker 0: And I was like,

96
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:27,355
Speaker 0: "Oh.".

97
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,840
Speaker 1: You know, that's a great analogy for the topic of the show, because think about it.

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,255
Speaker 1: They came up with a great concept, "Use non in a non-standard

99
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:34,636
Speaker 1: format.".

100
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:35,845
Speaker 1: Get it?

101
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:36,960
Speaker 1: Non-standard?

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Speaker 0: I think that they were discussing a place that actually served the Indian food in the non in burrito fashion.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,119
Speaker 0: So like an Indian bomb me.

104
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:44,824
Speaker 0: I don't know.

105
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:47,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, it was called a non-burrito, wherever they got it from.

106
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,886
Speaker 0: But they didn't get it here.

107
00:05:48,926 --> 00:05:50,919
Speaker 0: They were talking about having it somewhere else.

108
00:05:51,362 --> 00:05:53,917
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Man, should I just put my taco meat in a

109
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:54,199
Speaker 0: non?".

110
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,896
Speaker 0: And they were like, "No, you shouldn't do

111
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:56,078
Speaker 0: that.".

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,304
Speaker 1: Ah, but see, that's the thing.

113
00:05:57,364 --> 00:06:01,198
Speaker 1: They recognize the potential utility of non.

114
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,720
Speaker 1: But yet they cannot break outside of the non box.

115
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,580
Speaker 0: I had to buy a bag of cheese though at the grocery.

116
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,780
Speaker 1: They cannot imagine far forward enough.

117
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,657
Speaker 1: They're like, "Yeah, what if I take the non and I put the Indian food in

118
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:11,878
Speaker 1: it?".

119
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,320
Speaker 1: In case they did, but Indian, that'll be awesome.

120
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,058
Speaker 1: And then you suggest, "Why don't I just put something

121
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:17,260
Speaker 1: else?".

122
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,634
Speaker 1: They're like, "No, you wouldn't play

123
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,018
Speaker 1: god."

124
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:20,498
Speaker 1: You wouldn't play gods.

125
00:06:21,421 --> 00:06:23,980
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if I am going to play gods.

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,340
Speaker 0: Because the thing is, I'll probably do that eventually.

127
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:27,611
Speaker 0: But I don't know if I'll do it tonight.

128
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:28,640
Speaker 0: Only for one reason.

129
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,160
Speaker 1: I've never successfully reheated a non, for what it's worth.

130
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:31,841
Speaker 0: Okay.

131
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:35,960
Speaker 0: It's because I bought this package of corn tortillas, the little ones.

132
00:06:36,161 --> 00:06:36,778
Speaker 1: You got to use them up?

133
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,826
Speaker 0: I got to use them up.

134
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,380
Speaker 0: But the thing is, they fucking suck.

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,340
Speaker 0: Like they fell apart.

136
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:42,160
Speaker 0: I heated them up and I put the meat in them.

137
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,780
Speaker 0: And then, boop, the meat went straight through.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,478
Speaker 0: I might have to double them up.

139
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,360
Speaker 1: I, in my life, have a policy now on corn tortillas.

140
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:48,810
Speaker 0: Yep.

141
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,159
Speaker 1: So my policy is, I will only use a corn tortilla in something I'm cooking if I fry it in a pan.

142
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:56,940
Speaker 1: I'm not just going to steam it or heat it up.

143
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,000
Speaker 1: I'm either going to fry it or I'm using flour.

144
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,340
Speaker 0: Listen, I would have wanted to buy flour ones.

145
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,380
Speaker 0: I didn't have any of the ones I wanted.

146
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Speaker 1: What kind of jank ass grocery store are you going to?

147
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,800
Speaker 0: The one next to my house.

148
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:12,940
Speaker 1: I mean, I had a problem buying stuff yesterday, but at least what I was trying to buy was weird.

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Speaker 1: I was trying to buy vegan cream cheese.

150
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,000
Speaker 1: And let me tell you.

151
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,020
Speaker 0: Why did you want vegan cream cheese?

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,616
Speaker 0: Don't ask.

153
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,064
Speaker 0: Okay.

154
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:20,459
Speaker 1: It is not easy to find.

155
00:07:21,925 --> 00:07:23,480
Speaker 0: What is even in vegan cream cheese?

156
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,833
Speaker 0: Not cream or cheese.

157
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,097
Speaker 1: I did not know.

158
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:33,819
Speaker 1: I was partially curious as I asked to the manager of this grocery store, "Excuse me, do you carry vegan cream

159
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:34,020
Speaker 1: cheese?".

160
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:36,337
Speaker 1: My mind immediately said, "How could such a thing

161
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:36,518
Speaker 1: be?".

162
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,397
Speaker 1: And the manager is like, "Vegan cream

163
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:38,620
Speaker 1: cheese?".

164
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,919
Speaker 0: Is she just called hummus?

165
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,318
Speaker 0: I mean, what would you call it?

166
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,080
Speaker 0: Right?

167
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,799
Speaker 1: So it exists.

168
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:45,500
Speaker 0: Okay.

169
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,240
Speaker 1: And we acquired some, but not at the grocery store.

170
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,653
Speaker 0: What's it made of?

171
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:53,460
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell, oils of various kinds.

172
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:53,697
Speaker 0: Just oil.

173
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,599
Speaker 0: Okay.

174
00:07:55,021 --> 00:07:55,254
Speaker 1: Anyway.

175
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,380
Speaker 0: So it's margarine.

176
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:00,799
Speaker 1: It's more like... I haven't even looked at it yet, but it came in a weird box.

177
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:03,899
Speaker 0: With sugar in it?

178
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:05,320
Speaker 1: At least that is weird.

179
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,940
Speaker 1: Flower tortillas are in the key food in Beacon.

180
00:08:10,081 --> 00:08:13,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, the key food always has everything, but I was trying to go to the sea town next to my house.

181
00:08:15,387 --> 00:08:15,620
Speaker 0: Anyway.

182
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,920
Speaker 1: But they have corn tortillas, but not flour?

183
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,620
Speaker 1: I feel like in America, more people eat flour tortillas.

184
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,460
Speaker 0: They've had them before.

185
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,459
Speaker 0: They just didn't sell them.

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,140
Speaker 0: They didn't have them in stock at that moment, and they had so many corn ones.

187
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,540
Speaker 1: Actually, guys, there's a thread in our forum about moving to New York City.

188
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,719
Speaker 1: That's one thing you really need to realize if you move here.

189
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:33,900
Speaker 1: If you live anywhere else in the country, go to a grocery store.

190
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,020
Speaker 1: The idea that they're out of something is crazy.

191
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:37,986
Speaker 1: It's like, "What do you mean?

192
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:38,352
Speaker 1: they're out of

193
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:38,575
Speaker 1: milk?".

194
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,059
Speaker 1: But yet in New York, grocery stores sell out.

195
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,280
Speaker 0: Right.

196
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:44,120
Speaker 0: There's no supermarket that has everything, right?

197
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,060
Speaker 0: You're going to a regular grocery.

198
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,440
Speaker 1: It's not super.

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,660
Speaker 1: It only has like 30 gallons of milk.

200
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,400
Speaker 1: If someone buys a bunch, there just isn't any until the next day.

201
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they get deliveries so often.

202
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:02,240
Speaker 0: They're not giant mega groceries that have trucks full of food showing up every day, and each individual one doesn't have enough customer, so that's how it goes.

203
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:02,719
Speaker 0: All right.

204
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:04,237
Speaker 0: News.

205
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,340
Speaker 0: So there was this guy in Australia.

206
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,479
Speaker 0: His name was SuperDAE.

207
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:17,719
Speaker 1: Oh, is that the guy who hacked the encryption key in the PS3?

208
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,559
Speaker 0: No.

209
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:18,932
Speaker 0: Okay.

210
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:24,638
Speaker 0: That's another guy who is going to school at CMU.

211
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,859
Speaker 1: Is that the guy that Totillo just wrote an article about?

212
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:27,277
Speaker 0: Yes.

213
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:27,696
Speaker 0: Okay.

214
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,679
Speaker 1: So we're talking about a different guy.

215
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,820
Speaker 0: No, the guy who Totillo wrote an article about is the guy I'm talking about.

216
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,700
Speaker 1: Okay, so then I mistook the guy he wrote an article about with a different guy.

217
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,180
Speaker 0: That's right.

218
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:36,579
Speaker 1: Okay.

219
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:44,779
Speaker 0: The guy he wrote the article about is SuperDAE Australian guy, and what he did is- Wait, is his name SuperDAE Australian guy?

220
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:45,386
Speaker 0: One word?

221
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:49,160
Speaker 0: I think his actual name does start with a D. It's in the article somewhere.

222
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,360
Speaker 1: No, but is Australian guy in his name?

223
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:51,775
Speaker 0: No.

224
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,700
Speaker 1: Because you didn't make that clear.

225
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:55,019
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

226
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,060
Speaker 1: This is why the Oxford comma is anyway.

227
00:09:57,441 --> 00:10:02,310
Speaker 0: But anyway, this guy basically "hacked" various video game companies.

228
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:02,988
Speaker 0: Oh, Dylan.

229
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,000
Speaker 0: Dylan's his name.

230
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,060
Speaker 0: So Dylan, that's easier to remember than SuperDAE.

231
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:09,799
Speaker 0: Of course, I remembered SuperDAE first.

232
00:10:12,202 --> 00:10:16,700
Speaker 0: He hacked into Epic, the Gears of War company, and Microsoft.

233
00:10:17,822 --> 00:10:21,980
Speaker 0: The exact extent of his hacking is unclear and the methods of his hacking.

234
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,440
Speaker 0: I hate calling it hacking when all it is is you got someone's password.

235
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,676
Speaker 0: It seems like you basically got people's passwords or email accounts who work at these places.

236
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,180
Speaker 0: We need a level- And was able to log into various systems, including the system that lets you just buy dev kits, right?

237
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:53,180
Speaker 0: Because imagine if you work at some company that makes Xbox games, there's a website you can go to to buy Xbox development hardware and software that you have to log into after you become a registered official Microsoft Xbox developer and sign an NDA and all these contracts.

238
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:54,899
Speaker 0: They give you a log in on that site.

239
00:10:55,741 --> 00:11:08,979
Speaker 0: Since he hacked into or got, you know, logging credentials from the video game developers networks, he was able to get that other information and he just had like Xbox and PlayStation dev kits sent to his house, just bought them.

240
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:14,160
Speaker 0: And, you know, the exact extent of what he was able to do is not clear.

241
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:15,660
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like he was evil.

242
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:24,000
Speaker 0: And it seems like some of the companies even, you know, liked him for just telling them how he got in and, you know, they patched up the vulnerabilities he told them about.

243
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,540
Speaker 0: But looks like he went a little step too far and the FBI went over there and the Australians cooperated and they snatched him up all this stuff.

244
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:34,640
Speaker 1: Come on, Australia.

245
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,740
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like he doesn't seem like he's in jail, but they took all this shit.

246
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:47,719
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's actually when it in general to to really zoom out when it comes to computer quote, unquote, crime, especially in the United States.

247
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,679
Speaker 1: Pretty much the worst thing they can do to you is the thing they always do, even if you're found innocent, which is take all your shit and never give it back.

248
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:56,177
Speaker 0: Yep.

249
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:57,837
Speaker 0: It's bullshit.

250
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,396
Speaker 1: Yeah.

251
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,000
Speaker 0: Well, search and seizure, seizure anyway.

252
00:12:02,523 --> 00:12:02,957
Speaker 1: So is that it?

253
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,639
Speaker 1: Just cool article.

254
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:04,157
Speaker 0: Yeah.

255
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:15,075
Speaker 0: You should read this, you know, to see like, oh, you know, you can, you know, because the reason we know this guy was legit is because he wrote all this stuff about what's going to be in the PS4.

256
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,740
Speaker 0: And he was really right on target.

257
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:17,931
Speaker 1: Yeah.

258
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,552
Speaker 1: Two butts.

259
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:23,011
Speaker 0: So anything he has to say about the Xbox 480 720, probably also right on target.

260
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,080
Speaker 1: Stay on target.

261
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:29,120
Speaker 0: Stay on target.

262
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:35,283
Speaker 1: So in another kind of interesting and open ended bit, Scott showed me this article and we've been.

263
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:37,752
Speaker 1: I was puzzling through it to.

264
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,660
Speaker 0: I still haven't really figured it out.

265
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:43,400
Speaker 1: So independently, Scott and I have been having trouble with YouTube lately.

266
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:43,738
Speaker 0: Yeah.

267
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:45,177
Speaker 1: As many people have.

268
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,000
Speaker 0: It used to be in the olden days when you tried to go to YouTube, even not in the RIT days.

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,340
Speaker 0: That doesn't count with our OC threes.

270
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,080
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

271
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:52,598
Speaker 1: I miss those.

272
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,520
Speaker 0: But when we had like Cablevision and Beacon, you can go to YouTube, you could push pause and the video would completely load pretty quickly and then you would push play.

273
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:10,892
Speaker 1: Now when I first moved to New York City, I had Verizon FiOS, so I would pick a 1080p like 45 minute long video and the whole thing would just buffer in like a minute and just be ready to rock 1080p.

274
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:11,818
Speaker 0: Yes.

275
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,661
Speaker 0: This isn't like 09, 010.

276
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:28,919
Speaker 1: In the last few weeks, YouTube's been, I think in the last year and a half, you know, that's interesting because for me, YouTube has been just infinitely perfect and we've had YouTube problems here intermittently, intermittently for very short periods of time until the last several weeks.

277
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Speaker 1: So maybe the last four or five weeks, YouTube has gotten increasingly slow and have an increasing problems here that I never had before, despite the fact that I have basically infinite bandwidth and while YouTube will just fucking come to a halt.

278
00:13:43,221 --> 00:13:45,215
Speaker 1: Any other video site is still streaming 1080p just fine.

279
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,060
Speaker 1: Netflix, perfect 1080p just fine.

280
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,240
Speaker 1: It's just YouTube.

281
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,119
Speaker 0: Even at my house, like sometimes YouTube, you get the spinny spinny, but Netflix always plays 1080p just fine and I don't have FiOS.

282
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:09,799
Speaker 1: Now this article is specific to Time Warner and based on anecdotal testing that Scott and I have conducted, it appears to have an effect if you are a Time Warner customer, but not on FiOS.

283
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,600
Speaker 0: Well, it's, you know, we've done two tests, right?

284
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,260
Speaker 0: It's not much.

285
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,600
Speaker 1: Hence I said anecdotal evidence, just the two of us.

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,379
Speaker 0: But anyway, uh, and that was the only did the test once.

287
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,340
Speaker 1: But basically you use my wireless network, which you claim has problems anyway.

288
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,839
Speaker 0: Here's the thing is there's a thing you can do that works.

289
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,360
Speaker 0: We don't know why it works and we don't know how, where and when and where it works.

290
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
Speaker 0: It works sometimes and not other times.

291
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,660
Speaker 0: And we're not sure what the real problem is.

292
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,700
Speaker 0: And there is some people are claiming things that they don't have evidence for because it sometimes works and it's weird.

293
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,551
Speaker 1: So I did some investigation and I tried to kind of chart it out and all I will say is this.

294
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:54,057
Speaker 1: It is feasible that this would work, that a thing like this would have the intended effect.

295
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:58,600
Speaker 1: It is also feasible that I can explain why.

296
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:09,240
Speaker 1: And I've come up with three or four sort of high level scenarios where this would be the case, but anecdotally it seems to work anecdotally completely shooting from the hip.

297
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,300
Speaker 1: I am making no claim to back this up at all.

298
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,940
Speaker 1: This is pure rampant abject conjecture.

299
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,300
Speaker 1: The time order cable is probably possibly maybe with no evidence on my part at all.

300
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,020
Speaker 1: Don't sue me for libel or slander throttling the YouTube CDN.

301
00:15:28,422 --> 00:15:30,940
Speaker 0: I think it's more, here's the real thing, right?

302
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:40,156
Speaker 0: A lot of the explanations we come up with would mean that Google is doing something that is not optimal and has been doing it for a while, which is hard to believe.

303
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,460
Speaker 1: Half of them would imply that ISPs and peering arrangements are causing the problems.

304
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:47,858
Speaker 1: Well a third of them.

305
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:59,460
Speaker 1: The three thirds I can come up with are Google's internal CDN, peering internet bullshit, which may or may not involve the lower level ISPs, but Google or DNS shenanigans causing weird asymmetric routes.

306
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,120
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any DNS shenanigans.

307
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,396
Speaker 1: There very well could be.

308
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:07,939
Speaker 1: In fact, I ran into a complication because you see, when I was at RIT.

309
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,558
Speaker 0: Because I'm using Google DNS.

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Speaker 0: I'm not using Time Warner DNS.

311
00:16:12,942 --> 00:16:13,032
Speaker 1: Yes.

312
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,040
Speaker 1: Now there were reports in the early days of Google DNS that that would actually slow down your YouTube.

313
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:20,279
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

314
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,400
Speaker 0: Why would Google using Google DNS slow down Google YouTube?

315
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:36,160
Speaker 1: Because your ISP's DNS could, for example, be set to automatically redirect you first to the IPs of the nearest CDNs, but a global like open DNS.

316
00:16:36,901 --> 00:16:43,579
Speaker 0: But I thought that the Google open DNS is clever to know where you're coming from and thus will give you different answers.

317
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,479
Speaker 1: Ah, but you can only be clever so far.

318
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,198
Speaker 0: I think it's Google is about as clever as it can be.

319
00:16:48,663 --> 00:16:49,239
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

320
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:51,280
Speaker 1: DNS also is an ancient protocol.

321
00:16:51,825 --> 00:16:53,280
Speaker 0: Google is also ancient genius.

322
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,540
Speaker 0: But here's what I ran into.

323
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,180
Speaker 1: Just to give you some clarity on my old age.

324
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,060
Speaker 1: When I was at RIT, the beginnings of IPv6 were becoming available for initial testing.

325
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:07,438
Speaker 1: And I had an account on the old six bone, which was the sort of test internet for IPv6.

326
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:14,715
Speaker 1: And yeah, IPv6 is not commonly used unless you're an IT dude who's deep into networking, you don't really run into it.

327
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:21,779
Speaker 1: And I did a domain look up to play with some of this stuff last night and try to rationalize my theories.

328
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,280
Speaker 0: You're trying to do IPv6 YouTube?

329
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:27,260
Speaker 1: No, I just did a look up and I got all these IPv6 addresses.

330
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,320
Speaker 1: I was like, what the f... Oh, right.

331
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,599
Speaker 1: IPv6 exists.

332
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,493
Speaker 1: And I had to remember all the weird details of.

333
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,240
Speaker 1: IPv6 resolves addresses.

334
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:38,478
Speaker 1: That's a separate thing.

335
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,380
Speaker 1: A little known fact, you know what the DNS record is for an IPv6 address?

336
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,516
Speaker 1: Forward look up?

337
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:46,017
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not A?

338
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:47,331
Speaker 0: That's not A. Is it B?

339
00:17:47,946 --> 00:17:48,136
Speaker 1: No.

340
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,099
Speaker 0: That's a good guess.

341
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,119
Speaker 1: That's a pretty good guess.

342
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:51,277
Speaker 0: How about P?

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,739
Speaker 1: You will never guess.

344
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:55,144
Speaker 0: Is it F?

345
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,900
Speaker 0: Because F is the sixth letter of the alphabet?

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:17:59,985
Speaker 0: No.

347
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,580
Speaker 0: No?

348
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Speaker 1: Do you know other names, other kinds of records?

349
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:03,930
Speaker 0: C name?

350
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,080
Speaker 1: All right.

351
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,040
Speaker 1: So C name is a whole word basically as opposed to just A.

352
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:10,200
Speaker 0: MX, TXT.

353
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:11,212
Speaker 1: Yup.

354
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:11,979
Speaker 1: PTR.

355
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:14,500
Speaker 1: PTR is one of the most important records you can write.

356
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:15,719
Speaker 1: I don't know.

357
00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:19,036
Speaker 1: It's A, A, A, A.

358
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:19,660
Speaker 0: Awesome.

359
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:20,677
Speaker 0: It's not even six A's.

360
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,876
Speaker 1: It's just four A's.

361
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,255
Speaker 1: Do you know why it's four A's?

362
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,700
Speaker 1: Believe that is Geek Night's trivia.

363
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,316
Speaker 1: I dare anyone.

364
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,300
Speaker 0: Because it's four times as many bits as an A record.

365
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,499
Speaker 0: It's four A records number of bits.

366
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 1: The best I can say, and I'm trying to not say a lot, is that based on my knowledge of networks and it's one of the few areas in technology where I know a lot more than Scott.

367
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:47,100
Speaker 1: There aren't that many.

368
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:51,040
Speaker 1: Scott's a better coder than me and all sorts of things, but this is one area I got.

369
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:52,939
Speaker 1: It is feasible that this works.

370
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:54,739
Speaker 1: I can come up with reasons why.

371
00:18:55,221 --> 00:19:02,560
Speaker 1: I cannot prove without a lot of work on my part if any of them are actually why, and it'll be difficult to prove beyond any reasonable doubt.

372
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,880
Speaker 0: It's tough to even tell if it's working when you use it.

373
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:12,259
Speaker 0: So what you got to do is if your YouTube is sucking, try to do this and turn it on and off and try different videos a whole bunch.

374
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,060
Speaker 1: No, no.

375
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,720
Speaker 1: More importantly, try this.

376
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,098
Speaker 0: Use a stopwatch to see how fast they load.

377
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:16,877
Speaker 0: Try this.

378
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,971
Speaker 1: Come up with some method and tell us the results.

379
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:28,826
Speaker 1: because I brought this up as the news, even though Scott's the one who showed it to me primarily because I'm going to investigate this to the extent of my ability

380
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,515
Speaker 0: because the fact there is

381
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:37,338
Speaker 1: too much anecdotal evidence that it works, and I'm frankly pissed off that YouTube doesn't work that well anymore on files.

382
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,020
Speaker 0: That's right.

383
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,958
Speaker 0: And the thing is, when I did enable this at my house, YouTube was so fast, 10 AP.

384
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:48,577
Speaker 0: The gray bar was literally running away from the play dot, whereas before the spinning was there.

385
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,060
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

386
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,837
Speaker 1: So things of the day, this.

387
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:01,090
Speaker 1: apparently it was margarita week.

388
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:07,470
Speaker 0: One of those fake holiday is sangria in any way related to a margarita.

389
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:09,369
Speaker 0: I know Mexican restaurants serve both.

390
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:10,409
Speaker 1: Not at all.

391
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:13,370
Speaker 0: I saw some sangria at the grocery store today and this really nice job.

392
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,489
Speaker 1: It's gotta be awful.

393
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:18,610
Speaker 0: And I was thinking, man, I wonder if rim will drink that so I can get the nice jug.

394
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:19,789
Speaker 0: No, no.

395
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,809
Speaker 1: I realize you can just buy jugs on Amazon.

396
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:23,389
Speaker 1: Really nice one.

397
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,107
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

398
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:27,064
Speaker 1: If you want a particularly good jug, that is nice stopper.

399
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:28,069
Speaker 1: search for a growler.

400
00:20:28,751 --> 00:20:34,109
Speaker 0: I want a jug that's got three X's on the side and then I want to put water in it growlers that have three X's on the side.

401
00:20:34,716 --> 00:20:34,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:20:35,831 --> 00:20:41,824
Speaker 1: Now, if you want a clay jug, you know the who, who, who, who, I would buy the music store.

403
00:20:42,677 --> 00:20:43,250
Speaker 1: They don't sell those.

404
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:43,790
Speaker 1: The music store.

405
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:44,405
Speaker 0: I'm sure they do.

406
00:20:45,136 --> 00:20:45,970
Speaker 0: They sell wood blocks.

407
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,190
Speaker 1: They also don't sell washboards at the music store.

408
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,450
Speaker 0: And they sell tambourines.

409
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,810
Speaker 0: They might as well fucking sell a jug.

410
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,090
Speaker 1: All I can think of is the Homer Simpson and Lisa with the hoot.

411
00:20:56,772 --> 00:21:04,090
Speaker 1: So this is a perfectly serious video on how to make a perfectly excellent margarita margarita mix in the freezer.

412
00:21:05,272 --> 00:21:08,190
Speaker 1: This video is truth in a Darryl Ceratian sense.

413
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:09,728
Speaker 1: There's this moment.

414
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,009
Speaker 1: Basically it's a parody video.

415
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:11,969
Speaker 1: You're going to watch it.

416
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:15,789
Speaker 1: If you actually try to do what this video says, you're going to get sick.

417
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:17,310
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

418
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,670
Speaker 0: If you try to make a margarita, you're going to get sick.

419
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:24,988
Speaker 1: The reason I say that as a joke, cause the first step is to take a shot of grappa.

420
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:27,669
Speaker 1: You would not like grappa.

421
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:28,389
Speaker 0: No kidding.

422
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,829
Speaker 1: Most people do not like grappa.

423
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,008
Speaker 1: I love grappa.

424
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,268
Speaker 0: Of course.

425
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:34,209
Speaker 0: Anything is bad.

426
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,169
Speaker 0: Ram, how do you like the liver and onions?

427
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,470
Speaker 1: Disgusting.

428
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:38,428
Speaker 1: I hate liver onions.

429
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,106
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

430
00:21:39,478 --> 00:21:39,828
Speaker 1: Don't even.

431
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:42,509
Speaker 0: Cause you seem to like nasty things that no one likes.

432
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:59,626
Speaker 1: So this video is truth because the instructions say something to the effect of you need one bottle of tequila, one bottle of gross old triple sec, because triple sec is the bottle of gross old liquor, much like that peppermint schnapps at Gojo's house

433
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:02,041
Speaker 0: or that yellow shit you used to make a Harvey Wall down

434
00:22:02,081 --> 00:22:02,222
Speaker 1: here.

435
00:22:03,718 --> 00:22:04,150
Speaker 0: Your favorite?

436
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,410
Speaker 1: Your dad's favorite.

437
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:08,390
Speaker 1: I could get some of that.

438
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:09,530
Speaker 1: We could make a Harvey Wallbanger.

439
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:10,108
Speaker 0: That's all you.

440
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,550
Speaker 1: Want to have a Harvey Wallbanger party?

441
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:11,966
Speaker 0: All you.

442
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,090
Speaker 1: Because if we, if we tell Chase that he'll already be here, I think we should have a Harvey Wallbanger party.

443
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:18,446
Speaker 0: All you.

444
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,010
Speaker 1: Anyway, this video is great.

445
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:21,810
Speaker 1: I found it randomly.

446
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:22,779
Speaker 1: It only has 358 views.

447
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:27,110
Speaker 1: So you're going to get in on the early stages of this video.

448
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,270
Speaker 0: It's not going to get much farther than this.

449
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:31,370
Speaker 1: It's by a guy named Mark Buttcavage.

450
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,450
Speaker 0: That's a good name.

451
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,510
Speaker 1: I found it by searching for his name again.

452
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,503
Speaker 0: It's worth about 308 views.

453
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,288
Speaker 0: So there seems to be this new college major that's been going on for the, they invented it maybe five, six years ago.

454
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,350
Speaker 0: And then it's called IT.

455
00:22:43,952 --> 00:22:46,530
Speaker 0: It's called get quad copters and make them do something.

456
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:55,330
Speaker 0: And people seem to be doing this for like their masters projects is get some quad copters, make them do something, make them do a formation, make them say one thing.

457
00:22:55,971 --> 00:23:04,110
Speaker 1: If quad copters like kids have today existed when I was at RIT, oh fuck, would I have gotten myself expelled anyway.

458
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:10,509
Speaker 0: So this guy, he does something slightly more impressive than what all the other graduate students did with their quad copters.

459
00:23:11,051 --> 00:23:16,790
Speaker 0: He basically gets the quad copter to balance an inverse pendulum, which is also known as a stick.

460
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:25,790
Speaker 0: So sort of like when you have a pencil and you hold it on your hand and you keep the pencil upright, but moving your hand, calling it inverse pendulum is like calling your elbow, your bender and anti bender, right?

461
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:31,190
Speaker 0: So he gets this, uh, you know, quad copter to basically balance this inverted pendulum.

462
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:38,969
Speaker 0: And then the really impressive part is it throws the inverted pendulum into the air at another quad copter catches it and balances it.

463
00:23:39,994 --> 00:23:41,389
Speaker 0: It's pretty insanely awesome.

464
00:23:42,312 --> 00:23:49,490
Speaker 0: Uh, I was literally, usually I'm like up another guy doing something with a quad copter, but I saw this and I was like, Whoa, I am impressed.

465
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,154
Speaker 0: I will think of day.

466
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:56,730
Speaker 0: you play gods, you M play good at quad counter programming.

467
00:23:58,051 --> 00:24:01,950
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the book club book was the great Gatsby by F Scott Fitzgerald.

468
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:02,809
Speaker 1: We did a show on it.

469
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:03,428
Speaker 1: It's done.

470
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:04,869
Speaker 0: We're never going to talk about it again.

471
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:05,270
Speaker 1: Yup.

472
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,130
Speaker 1: But suffice it to say, if you didn't read it, you're a terrible person.

473
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,130
Speaker 1: If you didn't enjoy it and appreciate it, you're also a terrible person.

474
00:24:11,191 --> 00:24:11,488
Speaker 1: That's right.

475
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:18,950
Speaker 0: The new book club book is player of games by E and M banks, which is the second book in the culture series.

476
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,310
Speaker 0: The first book is optional.

477
00:24:20,451 --> 00:24:21,049
Speaker 0: I didn't read it.

478
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,070
Speaker 0: I just started reading book two and I guess two chapters or whatever.

479
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:33,907
Speaker 0: I don't know how many, cause I don't think it has even as chapter markers, but, uh, I didn't need to read the first one to understand the second one and it's called fucking player of games.

480
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,669
Speaker 0: This book could not be more geek nights.

481
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,230
Speaker 0: I don't think there could be a more geek nights book.

482
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:46,890
Speaker 0: It's my, you know, I mean, we probably like prince of nothing more, at least judging by what's happened so far, but this is more geek nights than prince of nothing.

483
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:49,670
Speaker 1: I think the phrase would be, it is perhaps in our wheelhouse.

484
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:51,329
Speaker 0: It is our wheelhouse.

485
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:56,789
Speaker 0: It is as if, you know, I was, I needed to move somewhere and I really liked the house I was living in.

486
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,810
Speaker 0: Then I saw a house that seemed, you know, the doorway was the exact shape of my body and the toilet was the exact shape of my butt.

487
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,230
Speaker 1: You realize all I can think of now is that Japanese horror comic about this is my hole.

488
00:25:09,371 --> 00:25:12,810
Speaker 1: It was made for me and it's a hole in the shape of a dude and he jumps into it.

489
00:25:12,931 --> 00:25:13,947
Speaker 0: That's exactly what this is.

490
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,450
Speaker 1: Have you ever read that comic?

491
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:15,786
Speaker 0: No.

492
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:16,670
Speaker 1: I forget what it's called.

493
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,290
Speaker 1: It's great though.

494
00:25:17,412 --> 00:25:18,170
Speaker 0: Other meta moments.

495
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:18,250
Speaker 0: Yes.

496
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,930
Speaker 0: The next convention is PAX East.

497
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:20,290
Speaker 0: PAX East.

498
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,105
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

499
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,270
Speaker 0: We're enforcing and paneling and gaming.

500
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,450
Speaker 1: We are doing on Saturday or Friday, I already forget, I gotta look at the schedule again.

501
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:31,770
Speaker 1: We are doing mastering game mechanics.

502
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:33,950
Speaker 1: We are doing practical game theory.

503
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:42,730
Speaker 1: We are possibly doing a third yet unnamed events and they're all in these small tabletop theater for once instead of in the giant normal theaters.

504
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:55,199
Speaker 1: So not going to say that it's going to fill, but I'll put it this way, when we do panels in the normal rooms, they see, you know, between 500 and a thousand people and a lot of people show up.

505
00:25:56,371 --> 00:26:01,210
Speaker 1: If history is any indication, this room seats between 50 and a hundred people.

506
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:05,285
Speaker 1: So we're already five times the capacity if we get our basic attendance.

507
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:07,287
Speaker 0: guys are listening to the show.

508
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,990
Speaker 0: Don't show up in the front of the line, get at the back of the line.

509
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,155
Speaker 0: So that way people who don't know who we are will be at the front of the line and then show up at the line.

510
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:18,523
Speaker 0: anyway, in case the room doesn't fill, you got to pack it in and fill it up.

511
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:25,750
Speaker 1: But also the reason you should get in line is that because it's not the big normal theater, it's going to be really hard to video it effectively.

512
00:26:25,931 --> 00:26:32,030
Speaker 1: So unlike every panel we've done up to this point, there's a good chance there won't be good video and audio of the presentation.

513
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:32,603
Speaker 0: Maybe not.

514
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,408
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

515
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,070
Speaker 1: And because it's a smaller room, we might do it more classroom style, which is going to be pretty awesome.

516
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,888
Speaker 1: So I'm cool with that.

517
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,770
Speaker 1: Kineticon submit your goddamn panels.

518
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,530
Speaker 1: I am actually scheduling panels every minute that goes by that you don't submit your panel.

519
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,989
Speaker 1: You are less likely to get a good slot or a slot at all.

520
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,463
Speaker 1: Yes.

521
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,330
Speaker 1: We're we already have more panels than we need.

522
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,330
Speaker 1: I could fill the entire schedule, but some of those panels, I would like, I would like more panels.

523
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:04,910
Speaker 0: We'd like another panel that is better than them to kick their asses out because we really don't want to have 10 Homestuck panels, right?

524
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:05,990
Speaker 0: One is enough probably.

525
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:06,690
Speaker 1: Anime Boston.

526
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:11,050
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone's heard back from Lou yet, but I assume we'll be there in April.

527
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:11,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

528
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:15,169
Speaker 1: And we will be doing between three and six panels.

529
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:21,087
Speaker 1: Some number of panels and I don't know, Pax Australia, all that other stuff kind of down the road.

530
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,163
Speaker 1: Pax Prime, Pax Dev, Pax East 2014.

531
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:26,470
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

532
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:28,910
Speaker 0: Any other meta things?

533
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:29,888
Speaker 0: Oh, of course.

534
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,342
Speaker 0: This is the, this week, right?

535
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:41,610
Speaker 0: At the end of this week, we will begin the first ever FRC gaming Grand Prix.

536
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,589
Speaker 0: I'm not going to go over all the info again.

537
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:52,910
Speaker 0: I'm just going to say that number one, it is a competition in games of skill that is accessible to all peoples capable of listening to a podcast.

538
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,250
Speaker 1: So what about people who are blind and have no arms?

539
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,667
Speaker 0: They might have a hard time, but they might also be able to play a monkey.

540
00:28:01,572 --> 00:28:07,489
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah, everyone who listens to this show and anyone on the whole internet can participate.

541
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:13,129
Speaker 0: We're going to find out who is the strongest gaming listener through a series of point scoring game rounds.

542
00:28:13,814 --> 00:28:15,450
Speaker 0: All of the info is on the website.

543
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:22,550
Speaker 0: If you want to join, you have to read the forum post and then, you know, join the forum if you're not already in there.

544
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,030
Speaker 0: So just to make a point and all the instructions will be there.

545
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:31,490
Speaker 1: You can't really say it's the best overall gamer because you're really constrained by the types of games you can pick with your accessibility.

546
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:36,730
Speaker 0: So I have already selected many games and it is covering a wide variety.

547
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:39,450
Speaker 1: So I'm just curious, are rhythm games represented?

548
00:28:39,571 --> 00:28:39,633
Speaker 0: Yes.

549
00:28:40,372 --> 00:28:40,809
Speaker 1: All right.

550
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:45,590
Speaker 1: In a sense, are games of physical exertion represented?

551
00:28:47,091 --> 00:28:47,133
Speaker 0: No.

552
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,330
Speaker 1: Okay.

553
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,549
Speaker 0: So there might be someone with no goddamn legs.

554
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:50,950
Speaker 1: Okay.

555
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:53,470
Speaker 1: So this doesn't test people who are good at, for example, sport.

556
00:28:53,812 --> 00:28:54,690
Speaker 0: It is not a sport test.

557
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,330
Speaker 0: It is only a skill game test, but many sports are also games of skill.

558
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,590
Speaker 0: Many are, but we are not testing those.

559
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,529
Speaker 0: We are testing the video and tabletop games.

560
00:29:05,414 --> 00:29:05,600
Speaker 1: All right.

561
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:10,030
Speaker 1: Are you going to require people to perhaps pirate old NES games?

562
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:22,129
Speaker 0: That may be a requirement if they do not have some other means of playing them such as virtual console and actual old NES, a DS with a piracy card or any other number of ways to play many games.

563
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,750
Speaker 1: Is Advance Wars one of the games?

564
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,689
Speaker 0: Advance Wars is not one of the games.

565
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,429
Speaker 1: Oh, come on.

566
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,688
Speaker 1: Nor will it be.

567
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,195
Speaker 1: Come on.

568
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,810
Speaker 1: No, no, but there's Atari emulators.

569
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,530
Speaker 1: Are there any Atari games?

570
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:44,082
Speaker 0: The problem with representing kaboom considered a similar kaboom game is that people do not have paddles and this would exclude all non paddle owners.

571
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,206
Speaker 1: is co-op one of the games?

572
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:50,868
Speaker 0: co-op was a thought that crossed my mind because I'm good at co-op, but it is not co-op.

573
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:51,949
Speaker 0: co-op is not a game.

574
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,110
Speaker 0: And this is what end the guessing portion of our program received to the geek size portion.

575
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,190
Speaker 1: So I have been waiting.

576
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,490
Speaker 1: I'm not even joking.

577
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:02,970
Speaker 1: This isn't hyperbole by any stretch.

578
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,749
Speaker 1: I've been waiting for augmented reality since I was four or five years old.

579
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,030
Speaker 0: I've been waiting for augmented reality since I was negative 10.

580
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:11,788
Speaker 1: So that's hyperbole.

581
00:30:12,591 --> 00:30:13,130
Speaker 1: No, seriously.

582
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,390
Speaker 1: My parents were gamers.

583
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,090
Speaker 1: I was born to a family that was playing Atari.

584
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,330
Speaker 0: This is not hyperbole or a joke or an exaggeration.

585
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:23,010
Speaker 0: When I was in the womb, my mom was playing super breakout.

586
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:28,284
Speaker 1: In fact, my mom tells stories of she couldn't lean over towards the end of her pregnancy with me.

587
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,510
Speaker 1: So remember the Atari 2,600 has those top switches.

588
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:34,370
Speaker 1: She would reach over with her foot to reset the game.

589
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,250
Speaker 0: What game was she playing?

590
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,710
Speaker 1: Uh, she was playing outlaw breakout, uh, dig dug.

591
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:47,230
Speaker 0: So me and rim, we had this, uh, cutie marks on a grain boom destiny as our moms were playing breakout turning us into ribbon Scott.

592
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:47,561
Speaker 0: Yup.

593
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,510
Speaker 1: Now my mom also had the Intellivision.

594
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,050
Speaker 0: Actually, my mom only played super break.

595
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:57,310
Speaker 1: My grandma actually kept the Intellivision and she played burger time my entire life.

596
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:57,768
Speaker 0: Okay.

597
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:06,250
Speaker 1: So, uh, as soon as I was old enough to kind of recognize the world existed, I was already playing like, I like, you know, Scott had his anecdote.

598
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:08,230
Speaker 1: He became sentient in the course of color.

599
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:11,110
Speaker 1: One day you realized color inside the lines.

600
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:20,250
Speaker 0: Everyone kept saying colors had lines, but I kept not doing it until one day it was like, Oh, my moment like that was playing, was playing the Atari.

601
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,369
Speaker 1: I was playing, I think kaboom.

602
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,410
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't kaboom.

603
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,470
Speaker 1: I don't even remember what game it was.

604
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:30,082
Speaker 1: I was playing the Atari, just kind of around and suddenly I'm like, Oh, I want that score to go up.

605
00:31:30,753 --> 00:31:32,790
Speaker 0: Oh, mine, mine was, I was playing shitty.

606
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,597
Speaker 0: I was playing shitty Atari Pac-Man.

607
00:31:34,657 --> 00:31:38,007
Speaker 0: and I was like, Oh, Pac-Man's supposed to eat all the dots.

608
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:39,627
Speaker 0: All of them.

609
00:31:40,234 --> 00:31:41,490
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm just walking around.

610
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:46,350
Speaker 1: So shortly after that time I had to get glasses because you know, I've got broken eyes.

611
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,209
Speaker 0: I didn't have that problem.

612
00:31:47,611 --> 00:31:56,410
Speaker 1: And soon as I got my glasses, the first thing I thought was, why can't I have a heads up display like fighter jets have in my glasses?

613
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,729
Speaker 1: I asked my parents and they said, that's not a thing.

614
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,689
Speaker 1: And I was really pissed off.

615
00:32:01,411 --> 00:32:07,569
Speaker 1: And I have fantasized and dreamed about having a heads up display in my glasses for almost my entire life.

616
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:16,750
Speaker 0: I've generally fantasized about some sort of, you know, actual cyberpunk future ever since reading Shadowrun rules.

617
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:21,209
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, I didn't see Ghost in the Shell till like high school early ish.

618
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:21,610
Speaker 0: Right.

619
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:31,330
Speaker 0: So I'm going to have to say reading Spider-Man 2099 when I was in middle school, which is totally in the cyberpunk universe and has all sorts of shit like that.

620
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:38,610
Speaker 1: I learned about cyberpunk when I picked up at the role playing game store, when I was buying some Dungeons and Dragons crap, I was like Shadowrun.

621
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,560
Speaker 1: In fact, you know what I think I'm going to go and I pull out Shadowrun and I flip it open.

622
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:48,310
Speaker 1: And I'm like, wait a minute, computer hackers and dragons in the same game.

623
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,046
Speaker 1: What?

624
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:50,288
Speaker 1: What is this?

625
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:50,902
Speaker 1: And I bought it.

626
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:51,829
Speaker 0: Definitely.

627
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,070
Speaker 0: I should reread Spider-Man 2099.

628
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,630
Speaker 0: And people don't know that was pretty much the comic book I grew up with.

629
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,070
Speaker 0: Like I would go to the comic store and I'd buy two comics, Spider-Man 2099 and Adjectiveless X-Men.

630
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,089
Speaker 0: And those are my two books.

631
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,474
Speaker 0: Spider-Man 2099 is so good.

632
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:07,866
Speaker 0: People don't know.

633
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:10,510
Speaker 1: I was more Adjective X-Men like uncanny.

634
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:11,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

635
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,069
Speaker 0: I read the Adjectiveless.

636
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,001
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should read if you can get.

637
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:17,690
Speaker 0: I think there's a trade now you can get.

638
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:20,509
Speaker 0: It's a really good cyberpunk book.

639
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:23,417
Speaker 0: You know, the guy it's.

640
00:33:23,999 --> 00:33:25,244
Speaker 0: if you read that, you will know.

641
00:33:25,284 --> 00:33:27,860
Speaker 0: you will say, oh, I see why Scott likes this book anyway.

642
00:33:29,531 --> 00:33:36,150
Speaker 1: The point is that we've both been waiting for augmented reality, cybernetic eyes, all those things, anything forever.

643
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:44,709
Speaker 0: The only difference between me and rim is that rim is first in line for, you know, replacement body parts where I'm like second in line.

644
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,329
Speaker 0: I'm not first in line for brain.

645
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,850
Speaker 0: I'll watch the first guy get the robot body and if that works out, I'll get a robot body.

646
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,970
Speaker 0: If I hear screams, I'll let another guy go in front of me in line and I'll let people have cuts until it goes well.

647
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:04,250
Speaker 1: I'm mostly hoping holding out for a robot knees, robot hip, robot eyeballs, robot teeth.

648
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,938
Speaker 0: I just want to have maybe I can get.

649
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:09,789
Speaker 1: those are the parts of my body that are most likely to break before my brain breaks.

650
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,409
Speaker 0: I'll take the robot teeth.

651
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:17,349
Speaker 0: Robot eyes are not bad necessarily, but I don't really have to look like bottle eyes.

652
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:19,322
Speaker 0: I don't think that's like demon eyes.

653
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:21,027
Speaker 1: That'd be cool.

654
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:28,429
Speaker 0: Mostly it's like, you know, when my shit, my shit's working pretty well right now, but you know, if I had some robot arms, I bet I could do pushups.

655
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:45,810
Speaker 1: So the reason we bring this up now is that I've realized something kind of surprising in the last week because you realize, I hope you realize it's all we've been talking about for a while now, at least in our normal lives, that Google glass has been, you know, on the horizon for a long time.

656
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,550
Speaker 1: We've kind of foreseen this coming and now it's really close.

657
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:48,991
Speaker 0: So

658
00:34:49,130 --> 00:35:01,518
Speaker 1: now they have announced that if you submit an application, a 50 word essay, up to five photos and up to 15 seconds of video, they're going to select 8,000 people who aren't Google employees to get access

659
00:35:01,658 --> 00:35:03,624
Speaker 0: to be in the Explorer program

660
00:35:03,664 --> 00:35:10,503
Speaker 1: who have the privilege of paying $1,500 for Google glass and get access to it in the really near future

661
00:35:10,844 --> 00:35:13,484
Speaker 0: as in weeks, if not a month or two.

662
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:13,950
Speaker 0: Yeah.

663
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,529
Speaker 1: Like I could have it by packs.

664
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,390
Speaker 1: I think there's only two more days left in the applications.

665
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,070
Speaker 1: Like it's correct.

666
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:19,464
Speaker 1: Quick.

667
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:19,844
Speaker 1: Yup.

668
00:35:20,113 --> 00:35:20,930
Speaker 1: I saw the announcement.

669
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,590
Speaker 1: I went home that night and started editing my video together.

670
00:35:23,792 --> 00:35:24,689
Speaker 0: I did the same thing.

671
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,409
Speaker 0: I submitted a quick one, a quick and dirty one, and then I went and put together a really good one and then that was it.

672
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,770
Speaker 0: I'm not going to do a third application.

673
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:55,030
Speaker 1: Now I'm not so much surprised by sour grapes or people who don't understand like where this could go and where it could come from and why we're so excited about it, but what I'm surprised by is the lack of vision that most people I talk to have about the potential of augmented reality in general, not Google glass specifically, not the immediate physical technology now, but the potential, the idea.

674
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:58,330
Speaker 1: I mentioned something in my Tumblr, but like, yeah, why don't I take my friends?

675
00:35:58,431 --> 00:35:59,869
Speaker 1: I never lose track of people's names again.

676
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,629
Speaker 1: And I get a lot of people who responded like, wow, that's an amazing idea.

677
00:36:05,336 --> 00:36:05,829
Speaker 0: It's just weird.

678
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:19,410
Speaker 0: I always have this weird thing too, where it's like, I'm somebody who, you know, I know that in order to make it, you know, really successfully, at least depending on how you define that in this world, the key is executing and working for a long time and keep working on stuff.

679
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,350
Speaker 0: And I'm lazy and I got enough, so I don't do that.

680
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,810
Speaker 0: But what I do have is fuck tons of ideas and I just have ideas all over the fucking place.

681
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:30,070
Speaker 0: And I see online, there's like people who are like, I got no ideas.

682
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,110
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what do you mean?

683
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:31,870
Speaker 0: You got no ideas.

684
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,590
Speaker 0: They're like no imagination whatsoever.

685
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,710
Speaker 0: It's like, they seem to not.

686
00:36:36,091 --> 00:36:45,510
Speaker 0: And it's, I can't really like, I know for a fact there are people who lack imagination, but I don't grok like, what is it like to not have an imagination?

687
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,410
Speaker 0: What the hell is your brain doing all the time?

688
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,882
Speaker 0: My brain is coming up with shit and things at once and imagining things that don't exist now.

689
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,730
Speaker 1: I wasn't planning on going down the road of making all you people feel bad.

690
00:36:56,177 --> 00:36:56,788
Speaker 1: Like Scott is.

691
00:36:57,052 --> 00:36:58,230
Speaker 0: How am I making people feel bad?

692
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,870
Speaker 1: I just want to.

693
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,510
Speaker 1: So basically I threw together this list.

694
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:02,985
Speaker 1: I was like, all right, here's 20 in five minutes.

695
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:07,890
Speaker 1: Like here's 20 things that'll change the world with like a thousand things.

696
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,688
Speaker 1: But I came up with 20 just like that.

697
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:26,589
Speaker 1: And I realized looking around the internet that when it comes to Google and augmented reality, the vast, vast, overwhelming majority of the discussions are around videoing stuff from the perspective of your eyeball.

698
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,550
Speaker 0: It's like, I can have a GoPro in my head and do that.

699
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,170
Speaker 1: It's like that is what most people are fixated on.

700
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,829
Speaker 1: Like they don't even, they, they're looking at the non and they're thinking, well, I can put any food in that.

701
00:37:36,152 --> 00:37:38,390
Speaker 1: They're not even thinking about the non taco.

702
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:42,130
Speaker 1: They're not even conceiving of putting ham in the non.

703
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:48,609
Speaker 0: They just watch the video of Google Glass, saw what it already does, and I guess they can't imagine it doing anything else.

704
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:55,690
Speaker 0: Whereas I imagine Ghost in the Shell because, and it's not even imagining, it's like Ghost in the Shell, Masamune, Shiro, imagine that shit.

705
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:03,069
Speaker 0: And so did the people at a production IG and I'm just saying, Hey, I could have that shit that other guy imagined for reals.

706
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:07,569
Speaker 1: So I made a statement and a lot of people took surprising umbrage with it.

707
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:13,850
Speaker 1: That augmented reality as a concept is going to change the world in the near term.

708
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,050
Speaker 1: I'm talking in the next five, 10 years, not in the next 30.

709
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,450
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

710
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,470
Speaker 1: More than the last 10 years of development of the internet.

711
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:22,409
Speaker 0: Maybe.

712
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:33,290
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty confident in that augmented reality has potential to radically change social structures in ways that I think a lot of people really aren't grokking.

713
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:42,722
Speaker 0: Uh, pretty much the people who can see the extra world, uh, as they walk around are going to be separated from the people who can't.

714
00:38:42,762 --> 00:38:42,983
Speaker 1: even

715
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:47,539
Speaker 0: more so, I mean, look at how culturally separated internet people are from not

716
00:38:47,619 --> 00:39:06,230
Speaker 1: listening to a conversation on a ski lift where I was trapped with a guy who was quiet and two girls, they were like 25, let's say they had the most vapid, inane, stereotypical conversation about waterproof, mascara and boys you could ever imagine.

717
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:09,750
Speaker 1: But in the middle of this, they both have iPhones out the whole time.

718
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:10,948
Speaker 1: I don't know what they were doing with them.

719
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:14,328
Speaker 1: And at one point service on the mountain, like 4g.

720
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:15,067
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

721
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:15,509
Speaker 0: Nice.

722
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:17,170
Speaker 1: And this one girl just stops.

723
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,250
Speaker 1: She's like, Oh my God.

724
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:21,327
Speaker 1: So if you heard of this Harlem shake thing, then it was like, no, what is it?

725
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:23,330
Speaker 1: And they start talking.

726
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,650
Speaker 1: This girl doesn't even know what the Harlem is.

727
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,129
Speaker 1: She starts describing it and she's just wrong.

728
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:32,530
Speaker 1: She's like, Oh my God, it's like this dance that these hockey players did.

729
00:39:32,931 --> 00:39:36,166
Speaker 1: And then it like spread around the YouTube and it got like 5,000 likes.

730
00:39:37,212 --> 00:39:39,390
Speaker 1: And now it's like this huge thing all over the world.

731
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:45,948
Speaker 1: It's going to be bigger than PSI and, and they didn't like, they, they're talking about a thing.

732
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:51,770
Speaker 1: They have in their hands, the ability to look up immediately in real time.

733
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:52,788
Speaker 1: What that thing is.

734
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,330
Speaker 1: And instead the first girl makes shit up about it.

735
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:57,866
Speaker 1: And the second girl believes her cause she's never heard of it.

736
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:03,203
Speaker 1: If Scott and I have Google glass on, I say Harlem shake.

737
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:20,890
Speaker 0: Scott's glass is already showing and it's reading it into the headphone in my ear and eventually, but hopefully before I, at the time when I am dead, it will insert the information into my brain, through some sort of cable into my spine, Allah, the matrix.

738
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,987
Speaker 0: I know Kung Fu.

739
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:31,370
Speaker 1: I mean already with just smartphones, arguments among people with smartphones are literally, Hey, why did cockroaches die upside down in the old days?

740
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,270
Speaker 1: We debated for awhile and then forget, or we'd go home and look it up and then have another argument.

741
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,388
Speaker 0: We need to go to a library.

742
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:40,210
Speaker 1: Then the question is asked, everyone pulls out their phone.

743
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:45,070
Speaker 1: There's two minutes of research and then we just don't talk anymore cause we all looked up the answer with Google glass.

744
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:45,907
Speaker 0: It's even faster.

745
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:47,970
Speaker 0: Someone says cockroach dying.

746
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,350
Speaker 0: The page already shows up on my eyes.

747
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:58,810
Speaker 0: I've already read it while they're talking and I say, no, you're and everyone else who has these simultaneously reads the same thing and we don't need to say anything.

748
00:40:58,891 --> 00:41:01,450
Speaker 0: And then the one person who doesn't have them is the dumb person.

749
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,250
Speaker 1: You realize the future of augmented reality.

750
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:09,090
Speaker 1: I walk into a restaurant and I look at the menu and immediately metadata is hovering in front of every menu.

751
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,490
Speaker 0: I walk into a restaurant.

752
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,370
Speaker 0: I, you know, as I'm walking to it, the menu is on my glasses.

753
00:41:15,033 --> 00:41:16,450
Speaker 0: The room is being reserved.

754
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:19,390
Speaker 0: As I'm looking at the menu, I order the food.

755
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,290
Speaker 0: I walk in my table has my name digitally floating above my seat.

756
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,969
Speaker 0: I sit in the seat that already had my name floating above it.

757
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:36,909
Speaker 1: The waiter saw I was on my way and is already standing there to make sure my order was correct, He sees the name Scott above me and where I'm going to sit.

758
00:41:37,212 --> 00:41:39,110
Speaker 0: It alerts him that I've arrived.

759
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,330
Speaker 0: He brings the food to me as I am sitting down.

760
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,970
Speaker 0: I eat it immediately.

761
00:41:44,431 --> 00:41:51,330
Speaker 0: I walk out without paying because it's automatically digitally paid when I stand up the burger.

762
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:56,728
Speaker 0: When it comes out, he sees in his eyeballs the amount Scott tipped him and he knows that I'm a good guy.

763
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,930
Speaker 0: And he says, thanks, Scott.

764
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:05,150
Speaker 0: As I leave the restaurant, looking at the map of the way to get back to wherever I'm going, I'm walking down the street.

765
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:10,104
Speaker 1: And if there's someone I know nearby, I see a flag off in the distance showing where they are.

766
00:42:10,491 --> 00:42:12,649
Speaker 1: If I put them on my list of people I care to see.

767
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:18,250
Speaker 1: If I meet a bunch of strangers at a party, all my metadata links up with all my friends'.

768
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:25,970
Speaker 1: So if someone's there that Scott knows that I don't and we share data, their name, I've never met this person, hovers over their head.

769
00:42:26,312 --> 00:42:28,910
Speaker 1: And the flags that Scott has put on them like this is a good guy.

770
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:29,990
Speaker 1: This is a douchebag.

771
00:42:30,373 --> 00:42:31,689
Speaker 1: This is a Randy Woo-Woo guy.

772
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:32,890
Speaker 1: I tag people.

773
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:33,689
Speaker 1: He tags people.

774
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,409
Speaker 1: I know to avoid this guy because Scott's already flagged him as an idiot.

775
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:44,990
Speaker 0: I flagged someone and then when I see someone familiar in another setting, I wonder, is that the same person that I saw in this other context?

776
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:48,029
Speaker 0: And I'll have 100 percent confirmation because they're either...

777
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,650
Speaker 1: Glasses, when have I met this person before?

778
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,210
Speaker 1: Glasses, who is the third person from the left on that panel I'm watching?

779
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:58,170
Speaker 1: This is just like and this is just like the baby stuff.

780
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:09,450
Speaker 0: I go to a convention, the map of the convention, I can just see on my glasses and it'll give me a little grand theft auto arrow showing me to get to the thing that I have chosen to next on my schedule.

781
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:12,905
Speaker 1: I'm playing paintball and my ammo counter shows up in my HUD.

782
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:17,289
Speaker 0: like when I'm playing counter I'm in the gigantic tabletop room and I can't find my friends, oh there they are.

783
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:20,609
Speaker 0: I go to the stadium and I want to find my seat, oh there it is.

784
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:33,189
Speaker 1: I'm playing poker with my friends, my glasses are on all the time, keeping a perfect count of all the cards that have been shown based on the number of decks that were shuffled, giving me odds of everything calculated from all the information I could possibly see.

785
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,648
Speaker 0: I walk up to the casino, they look at me and they see a big skull above my head and don't let me in.

786
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:46,670
Speaker 1: On the off chance that I'm looking at the board and someone leans forward for a second and their cards are visible to glass, it immediately catalogs them and shows me their hand.

787
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:47,101
Speaker 0: Yep.

788
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,790
Speaker 1: That might be cheating, but that's what it'll do.

789
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,990
Speaker 0: Don't show me your cards, asshole.

790
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's what it'll do.

791
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:54,970
Speaker 0: I'm playing a game, there aren't even any cards.

792
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,670
Speaker 0: Me and Rym sit down at an empty table with no dice, no cards, no nothing.

793
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:00,209
Speaker 0: We just look at each other.

794
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,770
Speaker 0: All of the same things appear to us digitally, there's no way he can look at my hand, right?

795
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:16,730
Speaker 0: I touch parts of the table, glass sees where I'm touching and knows what card is supposed to be there or what piece is supposed to be there and, you know, I can just tell it, okay, I choose captain.

796
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:20,190
Speaker 0: And he goes, which one do you want to sell the corn?

797
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,008
Speaker 0: It sells the corn.

798
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:22,850
Speaker 0: I see corns moving around.

799
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:28,249
Speaker 1: I'm in a bar or at a concert and a song starts to play and it immediately just kind of flashes the name of the song.

800
00:44:28,612 --> 00:44:31,429
Speaker 1: And records a history, Latitude records everywhere I go.

801
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:35,069
Speaker 1: This records a history of every song I've ever heard and where I heard it.

802
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,230
Speaker 1: In case I think back a week later, what was that song I heard at that club?

803
00:44:38,351 --> 00:44:38,480
Speaker 1: Bam!

804
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:47,770
Speaker 0: I walk around the store looking at products and the Amazon prices with little A smiley logos next to them are shown hovering above every product in the store.

805
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,650
Speaker 0: And if I want one of them, I look at it and I say, buy that and it orders on Amazon and sends it to my house.

806
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:57,329
Speaker 1: Every non-English word I ever see is immediately translated for me as I look at it.

807
00:44:58,694 --> 00:44:58,926
Speaker 0: Okay.

808
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,550
Speaker 1: Scott and I are playing a board game.

809
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,369
Speaker 1: We see sideband communication between each other and can use that to hustle the non-cybernetic douche bags at the table.

810
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:10,890
Speaker 0: Oh, we can see, yeah, I can ghost in the shell, right?

811
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:14,390
Speaker 0: The secret encrypted communications just between two people.

812
00:45:14,732 --> 00:45:14,799
Speaker 1: Yep.

813
00:45:15,437 --> 00:45:15,727
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

814
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:19,690
Speaker 1: Playing my trumpet, there's cheap music just scrolling, never have to flip the page again.

815
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:22,870
Speaker 0: And you think, wait a minute, how are they going to communicate?

816
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:25,970
Speaker 0: They still have to talk, but what if I have eye tracking and Dasher?

817
00:45:26,071 --> 00:45:32,490
Speaker 0: If you don't know what Dasher is, you should look that up, especially if you have no arms or legs, because it lets you type really quickly if you have no arms or legs.

818
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:39,210
Speaker 1: What if I also have, in addition to all this, a personal cloud where I have a wristwatch that has a screen on it for data input.

819
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:44,569
Speaker 1: And I have gloves on that do gestures and I have a pad in my pocket and I have a pad on the glass.

820
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:46,590
Speaker 1: So I have all these input IO mechanisms.

821
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,090
Speaker 0: You don't need anything but the glass.

822
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:51,890
Speaker 0: That's the whole point though, because if it has a camera, it can see where your hands are and what they're doing.

823
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:59,889
Speaker 0: So you don't need gloves and you don't need a wristwatch because if you have the glass, you look at your wrist and look, there's something there on your wrist, even though there isn't actually a watch.

824
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,910
Speaker 1: There is a use case for the occasional sort of second order physical interface.

825
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:11,330
Speaker 1: And the example I'll give you rather than a real world example is from a diamond age.

826
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:12,609
Speaker 1: Remember the beginning of diamond age?

827
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:13,087
Speaker 0: A book.

828
00:46:13,611 --> 00:46:15,089
Speaker 1: The guy who has the forehead gun?

829
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,129
Speaker 0: No.

830
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,489
Speaker 1: The first guy you meet is the dude with the forehead gun.

831
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:18,849
Speaker 0: Okay.

832
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:27,268
Speaker 1: So they might get clear that he could just control it with a thought, but then it would probably just fire kind of randomly every now and then.

833
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,090
Speaker 1: So instead it's tied to a physical action.

834
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:44,049
Speaker 0: I mean, if something is as important as say the nuclear laws, you need to have the two keys no matter how tight under his breath to actually fire it while simultaneously doing the brain trigger.

835
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:50,554
Speaker 1: So I could see a situation where you would want a screen on your wrist that you can touch physically.

836
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:53,810
Speaker 0: for my head mounted gun or something like that.

837
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,970
Speaker 1: Now, imagine this, you have a thing on your wrist, right?

838
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,590
Speaker 1: That is the physical input device in case you do need fine control of something.

839
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,330
Speaker 1: But that isn't actually a display.

840
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,870
Speaker 1: That's just a surface for you to physically touch.

841
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,888
Speaker 1: That also has maybe advanced sensors for fine control, but the display is still overlaid from your glasses.

842
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,070
Speaker 0: The glass has a touch screen and a touch surface and a button on the side of it.

843
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:16,929
Speaker 0: So yeah, I know.

844
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:17,288
Speaker 1: Yeah.

845
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,719
Speaker 1: I'm saying there's a case for all these are.

846
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,430
Speaker 1: is IO devices in a cloud around your body.

847
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:23,070
Speaker 1: Highly.

848
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:26,850
Speaker 0: Well, the personal area network has been around for a long time since it was invented.

849
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,249
Speaker 1: Yes, but it hasn't been a decade ago.

850
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,090
Speaker 0: Well, there just haven't been enough devices for that.

851
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:37,450
Speaker 0: It's like they've made all this stuff and they just haven't made enough devices to, you know, the pebble watch is like the first one really.

852
00:47:37,736 --> 00:47:38,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:46,110
Speaker 0: Well, I think I before then, personal area networks are pretty much just wireless Bluetooth headphones, a cell phone and a laptop.

854
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:52,049
Speaker 1: And I think the problem was just that material science, battery technology and wireless transmission technology just weren't there yet.

855
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,028
Speaker 1: We're just at the point where they're there.

856
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:07,490
Speaker 1: But the point is that augmented reality, like each one of these things completely on its own sounds like something that's a cool toy that is great and really awesome, but doesn't sound individually all that society shattering.

857
00:48:08,698 --> 00:48:09,168
Speaker 1: They aren't.

858
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:16,869
Speaker 1: None of them are by themselves, but the sum of all of them together means that I have a, I basically have a new sense.

859
00:48:17,331 --> 00:48:23,090
Speaker 1: That sense is a constant stream of metadata about everything I am ever interacting with.

860
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,408
Speaker 1: I will never have a, in the future, I will never have a question about a thing I'm interacting with again.

861
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,490
Speaker 1: I mean, in New York city, here's a really common problem.

862
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:34,369
Speaker 1: You're walking down the street, you know, an address you want to get to.

863
00:48:35,011 --> 00:48:40,190
Speaker 0: So yeah, maybe you have Google, you know, whatever, but the numbers on the side of the buildings are not visible often.

864
00:48:40,291 --> 00:48:42,266
Speaker 0: So I want to go to two, two, three, where the hell's?

865
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:42,750
Speaker 0: two, two, three.

866
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:44,169
Speaker 0: I know this side of the street is odd.

867
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:53,988
Speaker 1: Here's two, two, oh, and there's two, two, six, two to, oh, the next building is one that happens to me a lot.

868
00:48:55,035 --> 00:48:55,990
Speaker 0: I don't know where you're going.

869
00:48:56,551 --> 00:49:02,684
Speaker 1: A lot of places downtown or maybe on the corners because you're on it now in the middle, because there's, for example, there's 60 East 42nd street.

870
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:06,709
Speaker 1: That is also one grand central place.

871
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:10,590
Speaker 1: The place augmentation is bullshit anyway.

872
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:10,950
Speaker 0: That's right.

873
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:11,550
Speaker 0: It's on a corner.

874
00:49:11,691 --> 00:49:12,250
Speaker 0: It's on two streets.

875
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,370
Speaker 1: No, it's not on a corner.

876
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:14,110
Speaker 1: That's the problem.

877
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:15,190
Speaker 1: It's just bullshit anyway.

878
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:17,947
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'll just overlay those numbers.

879
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,290
Speaker 0: There you go.

880
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,009
Speaker 0: Problem solved.

881
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:38,609
Speaker 1: But all these things together mean that the people who use augmented reality and double down on it, and especially the people who grow up with it are going to be more different than people who don't engage with that technology than the current difference between people who use smartphones heavily and people who don't own them.

882
00:49:39,832 --> 00:49:50,709
Speaker 1: And think about, I mean, you all who have smartphones, no people, probably parents, grandparents who don't have smartphones or maybe not even cell phones, maybe not even computers or internet.

883
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:54,670
Speaker 1: Think about how hard it is to communicate with those people.

884
00:49:55,171 --> 00:50:00,610
Speaker 1: Think about how many things you cannot assume when you talk to them and think about, right?

885
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:02,510
Speaker 0: See, even if you do have these things, right?

886
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,170
Speaker 0: Think about rims girls on the ski lift.

887
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,690
Speaker 0: They had iPhones, but they just didn't know how to use them well.

888
00:50:07,878 --> 00:50:08,110
Speaker 0: Right.

889
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:17,010
Speaker 0: Well, even though I'm the kind of person where I can learn how to use it really well, having it earlier just means I have more practice sooner.

890
00:50:17,151 --> 00:50:21,050
Speaker 0: I'll be better sooner and farther ahead sooner, you know?

891
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:31,750
Speaker 0: And it's like if I had to choose which people I want to be in the same group with, it's the people who are awesome, not the people who don't know what a Harlem Shake is three weeks after it's over already.

892
00:50:32,031 --> 00:50:42,009
Speaker 1: I have the entire internet at my disposal, but I also have to physically think I'm going to look that thing up and go through the motions and usually I'm not at leisure to do that.

893
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,510
Speaker 1: I'm walking somewhere, I'm interacting with something else.

894
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:54,810
Speaker 1: Just having that information all queued up and setting my level of what metadata do I want in different contexts means that it's like I'm a superhuman with a perfect memory.

895
00:50:56,111 --> 00:51:06,350
Speaker 1: There is the obvious drawback that if my data stream suddenly becomes unavailable, it's like not having a sense, but I already experienced that when I don't have my cell phone on me.

896
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:06,869
Speaker 0: That's right.

897
00:51:07,552 --> 00:51:09,829
Speaker 1: So I don't, I think I'll be able to deal with it.

898
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,670
Speaker 0: If there's an apocalypse, there's an apocalypse, right?

899
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:19,930
Speaker 0: I'm not going to, it's like the dumbest argument people make is like, what if the worst thing happens and you don't have it anymore?

900
00:51:20,091 --> 00:51:22,969
Speaker 0: It's like, well, I'm doing just fine now without it.

901
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,528
Speaker 0: And it's like, so because I might not have, I might lose it, I shouldn't have it while I can.

902
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:32,270
Speaker 0: It's like, well, there might not be any more bananas ever.

903
00:51:32,552 --> 00:51:34,389
Speaker 0: So I don't eat any bananas now.

904
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:35,330
Speaker 0: So here's one thing.

905
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:43,170
Speaker 1: And you could argue it's possible that someone who has access to technology like this from birth would never actually learn how to remember anything.

906
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:47,529
Speaker 1: So then if their glasses break, they don't know how to get home.

907
00:51:48,378 --> 00:51:48,610
Speaker 0: Okay.

908
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:49,465
Speaker 1: That can happen.

909
00:51:51,613 --> 00:51:52,310
Speaker 0: It's possible.

910
00:51:52,450 --> 00:52:00,090
Speaker 0: And I find it unlikely because you consider something like, you know, if you, in a, in a, in a mid future, I don't see it as being that unlikely.

911
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,650
Speaker 0: I don't see, here's why I don't see it as likely ever, right?

912
00:52:02,951 --> 00:52:04,830
Speaker 0: Look at just the way the human brain works.

913
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,730
Speaker 0: You play a game like, uh, say super Metroid, right?

914
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:12,270
Speaker 0: And super Metroid, they started to introduce the map, right?

915
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,050
Speaker 0: Showing you where you were in the game before.

916
00:52:14,211 --> 00:52:17,769
Speaker 0: Then you were lucky if you had a Zelda one map, if any map at all, right?

917
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:23,730
Speaker 0: But yet, even though you had the map helping you in super Metroid, you covered this.

918
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,950
Speaker 0: If you played it without a strategy guide, you covered the same ground over and over again.

919
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:28,690
Speaker 0: Right.

920
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:33,070
Speaker 0: And even with the map, you eventually learned that you remembered it.

921
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:35,527
Speaker 0: Even though you had an aid, right?

922
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,089
Speaker 0: That was teaching you true.

923
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:42,950
Speaker 1: But what as other, even if you played Mario three with a strategy guide, other things get similarly automated.

924
00:52:43,151 --> 00:52:46,750
Speaker 1: So I'm also using the Google car to get everywhere.

925
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:51,010
Speaker 1: I don't know my own address and I never even looked out the window in the Google car.

926
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:53,370
Speaker 0: Well, the Google car is driving you.

927
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,709
Speaker 0: You're not doing the driving then.

928
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:54,902
Speaker 0: Yes.

929
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:57,489
Speaker 0: You might not know how to get to the place.

930
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:58,388
Speaker 1: Yup.

931
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:02,350
Speaker 0: But anyway, but if you did the driving and had a heads up display map.

932
00:53:02,924 --> 00:53:03,130
Speaker 0: Sure.

933
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:03,729
Speaker 0: You might not.

934
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:09,309
Speaker 0: You might take a while to remember the directions because the map is helping you, but eventually you won't need the map because you've done it.

935
00:53:09,491 --> 00:53:09,910
Speaker 1: But here's the thing.

936
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,183
Speaker 1: That level of existential argument is never there.

937
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:15,850
Speaker 1: when people make, they usually make an argument more law to use an older analogy.

938
00:53:16,371 --> 00:53:24,890
Speaker 1: When cell phones first started becoming ubiquitous, the primary complaint against them from people who didn't want them was that they don't want to be able to be gotten ahold of.

939
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:26,910
Speaker 1: They don't want to be interrupted on their vacation.

940
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,790
Speaker 1: It's like they never conceived of the fact that they could turn it off.

941
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:35,589
Speaker 1: If I go to the beach and I'm going to go on the beach, I'll probably turn my glass off

942
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:36,192
Speaker 0: and

943
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,076
Speaker 1: just lay on the beach

944
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:40,555
Speaker 0: and let, until I get one that's installed in me and waterproof and say,

945
00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:43,410
Speaker 1: I might say, Hey, go into autistic mode for an hour.

946
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:44,069
Speaker 1: I'm just going to chill.

947
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:45,628
Speaker 1: I don't care if anyone tries to call me.

948
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:46,005
Speaker 0: Yup.

949
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,770
Speaker 0: Uh, how much time do we have left here?

950
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,130
Speaker 0: We

951
00:53:50,151 --> 00:54:22,788
Speaker 1: can talk for a while, but the, the, the connectedness of people who use augmented reality over the next decade is going to set them increasingly, possibly dangerously apart from everybody else because they'll have so much access to information live in real time that it will be increasingly difficult to, you're not, it's not just that you have access to the information that with a, with an augmented reality that you are using in an integrated fashion with your life, you are experiencing the world in a completely different context from other people.

952
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:31,410
Speaker 1: And I think that is what's going to cause the great social change that suddenly you have two classes of people who are seeing a, they're actually two classes.

953
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:32,450
Speaker 0: It's like a stretching.

954
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,350
Speaker 0: You think of it as like a big gray scale, right?

955
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,329
Speaker 0: Of the classes.

956
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:43,148
Speaker 0: You know, when you think of economic classes, usually think of technological classes and on the one end is the earliest adopter who has the hottest shit and the other end is the caveman.

957
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:43,450
Speaker 0: Right.

958
00:54:43,793 --> 00:54:45,230
Speaker 0: And you just stretch it out.

959
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:51,170
Speaker 0: So the technological power and difference between people is, is so much greater, right?

960
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,770
Speaker 0: From the, from the highest end person, lowest end person, right?

961
00:54:54,432 --> 00:55:05,133
Speaker 0: And then at the same time, the real conflict that we're already seeing for the past 20 years and probably for the next 20 as well, is that the people at the highest end and the lowest

962
00:55:05,395 --> 00:55:07,303
Speaker 1: end are accelerating away from each other,

963
00:55:07,384 --> 00:55:17,427
Speaker 0: away from each other, but are also equally oppressed because the political power in the world is held by these people sort of in the middle, lower end, right?

964
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:22,750
Speaker 0: So the people who are at the extreme low are oppressed by their lack of access to the technology.

965
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:27,645
Speaker 0: the same way in a literate person would be oppressed right in the, you know, in even today.

966
00:55:28,142 --> 00:55:28,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

967
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:44,349
Speaker 0: At the same time, the extremely high tech people are oppressed by because the people who are holding governmental and other power in the world forms of power that aren't technology power and are afraid and don't want to be owned by those people with the high technological power.

968
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:53,230
Speaker 1: Now there is one drop, one serious drawback to augmented reality that it really does just make this digital divide a thousand times worse.

969
00:55:53,651 --> 00:56:02,590
Speaker 1: I mean, right now we live in a world where I have a smartphone because I'm fairly well off and you know, I don't have any economic trouble and there are smart people who don't have access to that technology.

970
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,149
Speaker 1: They're less connected to me.

971
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,649
Speaker 1: I'm less likely to interact with them.

972
00:56:05,911 --> 00:56:07,330
Speaker 1: They don't have access to this information.

973
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,389
Speaker 1: They live in a different world.

974
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:13,910
Speaker 1: People one step beyond that who have economic hardship, they can't even afford basic necessities.

975
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:16,430
Speaker 1: Maslow's pyramid, they're even further removed.

976
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:27,189
Speaker 1: And now among the people who have money and reasonable security and reasonable power and reasonable technology, there is now going to be a divide between the AR people and the non AR people.

977
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,470
Speaker 0: And it's weird because like the goal, right?

978
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:36,421
Speaker 0: One of the goals of having all this technology is to bring the world together to have just one people that not these separate countries.

979
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:42,790
Speaker 1: are you telling me that harsh socioeconomic realities are crushing our democratization utopia, right?

980
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:46,150
Speaker 0: It's like we're trying to use technology to make it to where all people are people.

981
00:56:46,551 --> 00:56:50,550
Speaker 0: You know, there's no separate countries, no separate races, no separate nonsense, right?

982
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,550
Speaker 0: You know, globalization was just one.

983
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:53,930
Speaker 0: You know, people are people.

984
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:54,609
Speaker 0: Earth is earth.

985
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:55,065
Speaker 0: The end.

986
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,830
Speaker 1: I like a diamond age world where there is no physical culture.

987
00:56:57,891 --> 00:56:58,750
Speaker 1: There's just the idea.

988
00:56:59,032 --> 00:56:59,290
Speaker 0: Exactly.

989
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:00,150
Speaker 1: But mental culture.

990
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:13,350
Speaker 0: But at the same time we are, you know, if our technology progresses too quickly and isn't equally accessible to all right, we're going to end up actually separating people even if we can bring everyone together in those ways.

991
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:19,110
Speaker 0: We'll separate people again into, you know, the advanced technological people who live in cyberspace.

992
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:27,865
Speaker 0: So might even, you know, get as far over a long period of time to be a separate species, you know, almost, or at least the culture where it's like.

993
00:57:27,885 --> 00:57:39,410
Speaker 1: they don't even recognize that the non technological people as being the same kind of organism, the extreme of ghosts in the shell, people who don't have cyber brains and aren't connected at all are in salt.

994
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:46,210
Speaker 1: Like homeless people are literally invisible to a lot of normal citizens and to a lot of the societal machines.

995
00:57:46,410 --> 00:57:52,729
Speaker 1: There's a great scene in ghost in the shell where there's a bunch of hobos living inside of a factory because the machines don't even see they're there.

996
00:57:53,392 --> 00:58:00,746
Speaker 0: Well, there's also right when the, the, when the laughing man hacked everybody so that, you know, all they could see was the laughing man icon and not his face.

997
00:58:00,887 --> 00:58:02,273
Speaker 1: hobos are the only ones who can see.

998
00:58:02,293 --> 00:58:06,790
Speaker 0: there are two hobos who saw his actual face because they didn't have any cyber anything.

999
00:58:07,122 --> 00:58:07,290
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1000
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:07,463
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1001
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,245
Speaker 1: We're not, I'm not talking about the hacking side of this cause.

1002
00:58:10,265 --> 00:58:11,089
Speaker 1: that could be a whole show.

1003
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:22,650
Speaker 1: But the point is that yes, it might be silly for someone who doesn't have 1500 bucks to throw away and who isn't willing to double down on this stuff to pay for it.

1004
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:23,710
Speaker 0: Now I'm not arguing that.

1005
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:32,450
Speaker 0: And it might, and it might not have all the, it's actually, I guarantee it won't have even a small percentage of all these imaginary things we have imagined right away.

1006
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:38,550
Speaker 1: If I was an RIT at w at the economic level, I was zero came out node car.

1007
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,809
Speaker 1: I could not have gotten Google last.

1008
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:41,210
Speaker 1: True.

1009
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:47,908
Speaker 1: I would have been sad that I didn't have it, but I would not have ruined my life to get the money to get it.

1010
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:53,534
Speaker 0: I also, but at the same time, while that is true for me as well, I would not be poo pooing it.

1011
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,029
Speaker 0: I would be saying, man, I wish I could have that motherfucker.

1012
00:58:56,471 --> 00:59:01,946
Speaker 1: It's like, I remember saying totally aside Google stock, I really wish I could buy some of this right now.

1013
00:59:02,516 --> 00:59:03,530
Speaker 0: And here's the thing, right?

1014
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,209
Speaker 0: You might say, okay, it'll be buggy.

1015
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:10,130
Speaker 0: It'll let's assume worst case scenario, like one feature works and it's crazy buggy.

1016
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,329
Speaker 1: That feature is video of everything all the time.

1017
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:14,169
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

1018
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:17,705
Speaker 0: Still, it still has more features than nothing.

1019
00:59:19,375 --> 00:59:20,590
Speaker 1: It has more than zero.

1020
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:24,770
Speaker 0: Even if one thing works, that's one thing that people who don't have it don't have.

1021
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,750
Speaker 0: It's the first, that is one super power.

1022
00:59:26,831 --> 00:59:29,750
Speaker 0: It's like, oh no, I don't have Superman super strength.

1023
00:59:29,972 --> 00:59:31,629
Speaker 0: I only got his laser heat.

1024
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:33,230
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes that's bad.

1025
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:36,830
Speaker 1: For example, oh my God, I don't have Wolverine's fast healing factor.

1026
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:44,050
Speaker 1: I only have his claws still useful if I encounter a can that doesn't want to open.

1027
00:59:44,355 --> 00:59:44,490
Speaker 1: Yes.

1028
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:51,749
Speaker 0: Once man, it's that kind of, you know, those plastic twisties, they tie stuff into the package.

1029
00:59:51,950 --> 01:00:00,830
Speaker 1: You know how many times recently I've gotten a bottle of like, or not a bottle, but like one of those, uh, special packs, like the cardboard, uh, tetra pack of like guava juice.

1030
01:00:01,132 --> 01:00:03,849
Speaker 1: And I pull on the tab and the tab comes off and it's still sealed.

1031
01:00:05,053 --> 01:00:07,110
Speaker 1: Oh God, that's first world problems.

1032
01:00:07,418 --> 01:00:07,689
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1033
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:12,530
Speaker 1: But, but the point is that, yes, it's not going to be perfect.

1034
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:13,508
Speaker 1: I perfectly understand.

1035
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:14,850
Speaker 0: Here's the other thing, right?

1036
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:22,590
Speaker 0: Is even though it won't be perfect, remember these days, some people seem to have a hang up about, oh, it's still beta.

1037
01:00:22,754 --> 01:00:23,370
Speaker 0: It's testing.

1038
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:24,430
Speaker 0: It's not the real deal.

1039
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,190
Speaker 1: There's no, so is Google Gmail.

1040
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,546
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1041
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,250
Speaker 0: There is no such thing.

1042
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:33,430
Speaker 0: Everything these days, there is no, you know, when something is done is arbitrary, right?

1043
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,708
Speaker 1: You know what you could say right now?

1044
01:00:35,251 --> 01:00:37,249
Speaker 1: Measure is on CC.

1045
01:00:37,491 --> 01:00:37,949
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1046
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,090
Speaker 0: Everything these days is done by incremental development, right?

1047
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,230
Speaker 0: You put it out and it gets updates and updates and updates constantly.

1048
01:00:45,313 --> 01:00:45,789
Speaker 0: Look at steam.

1049
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,970
Speaker 0: It updates every other week is steam and beta.

1050
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,200
Speaker 1: No, but Java and nothing is ever done because of software.

1051
01:00:54,513 --> 01:00:54,847
Speaker 0: Updates.

1052
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:55,644
Speaker 0: Things come out.

1053
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,338
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it is done, you know, it is done.

1054
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:06,952
Speaker 1: non Samsung Android devices, but I mean, they just get updated constantly, even though the point is that non Samsung Android devices don't.

1055
01:01:06,992 --> 01:01:12,050
Speaker 0: the Google glass you get on the first day is going to be poop compared to the exact same thing.

1056
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,290
Speaker 0: If you just hold onto it for a few months, it's just going to keep getting better.

1057
01:01:15,631 --> 01:01:19,010
Speaker 0: Just as you use it all the time, everything just keeps getting better constantly.

1058
01:01:19,693 --> 01:01:21,830
Speaker 0: So better to have it earlier than later.

1059
01:01:22,032 --> 01:01:23,770
Speaker 0: So you can always upgrade.

1060
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:26,770
Speaker 0: You can, you know, I used to have an iPhone three G. Oh no.

1061
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,335
Speaker 0: Now I have an iPhone.

1062
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:36,249
Speaker 1: now in the immediate term as in say I get selected and Scott gets selected and we have these next week out of the box.

1063
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:43,308
Speaker 1: Anytime crazy shit happens on the, on, you know, anywhere in my life, I've got a Russian dash cam of it.

1064
01:01:43,736 --> 01:01:43,948
Speaker 0: Yup.

1065
01:01:44,312 --> 01:01:45,749
Speaker 1: So already that's awesome.

1066
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,970
Speaker 1: That's not $1,500 awesome, but that's awesome already.

1067
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:50,745
Speaker 1: I don't have to.

1068
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:54,769
Speaker 0: I might, I'm not going to get much better pictures of things cause I'm not going to be too late.

1069
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,210
Speaker 0: Cause I had to get a camera or my phone out of my pocket.

1070
01:01:57,313 --> 01:01:57,377
Speaker 1: Yup.

1071
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:01,241
Speaker 1: Already I'm going to have a HUD of Google map.

1072
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:07,609
Speaker 1: when I walk out of the subway and I'm at an unfamiliar station, I don't know which way is north right away or when I'm biking in a weird place.

1073
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,649
Speaker 0: I don't have to stop and get my phone out.

1074
01:02:09,850 --> 01:02:20,046
Speaker 1: I can just keep saying guys, if you've never biked a long distance, you still need navigation, especially if you're taking a complicated route, mounting your phone on your bike sucks ass.

1075
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:20,466
Speaker 0: Yup.

1076
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:25,870
Speaker 1: And you, you know, if you think it's dangerous to keep looking at your map while you're driving, yeah, biking is a little worse.

1077
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,910
Speaker 1: So I'm going to have a HUD of my Google directions.

1078
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:30,107
Speaker 1: It already does that.

1079
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:32,129
Speaker 0: It already does that.

1080
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:34,570
Speaker 0: I can Google search without having to get my phone out of my pocket.

1081
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:40,630
Speaker 0: I can just say, you know, Google goggles, I can just be like, okay, glass search for upside down cockroaches.

1082
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,485
Speaker 1: You know, Google goggles, the, uh, you know, reverse image shirts, like look up what this thing is.

1083
01:02:44,971 --> 01:02:49,090
Speaker 1: That's a thing that already works now, which is going to be integrated with my glasses.

1084
01:02:49,672 --> 01:02:57,829
Speaker 1: I'm going to use it a lot more often and to part of being an Explorer is, you know, getting access to the SDKs and actually trying to write software for this shit.

1085
01:02:58,331 --> 01:03:03,289
Speaker 1: And you know what, you know, if no one else does it, what my project's going to be, it's so simple.

1086
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:04,310
Speaker 1: It's so easy.

1087
01:03:04,634 --> 01:03:05,909
Speaker 1: I can write software to do this.

1088
01:03:06,631 --> 01:03:14,310
Speaker 1: I just want to take a PowerPoint and see my slide previews and my talking points and the time left in my HUD.

1089
01:03:14,651 --> 01:03:22,747
Speaker 0: Also, you know what this also already does Google hang out where the person sees what you're looking at in the hangout and you see their face or what they're looking at if they have glass.

1090
01:03:22,952 --> 01:03:23,244
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1091
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:25,910
Speaker 0: That's already on its own slowly.

1092
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,349
Speaker 0: And that's what it does now.

1093
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:27,694
Speaker 0: Today.

1094
01:03:28,736 --> 01:03:29,048
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

1095
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:29,727
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1096
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:40,510
Speaker 1: So I am doubling down on this because I am in a situation in my life where $1,500 is not a significant hardship.

1097
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:46,387
Speaker 1: If $1,500 worries significant hardship to me, I probably would wait until they were generally available.

1098
01:03:47,016 --> 01:03:48,830
Speaker 0: They still be $1,500.

1099
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,369
Speaker 1: They may not be.

1100
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:52,909
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's hard to say because the people are saying they're going to be 300 bucks.

1101
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,909
Speaker 1: I don't think that.

1102
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:54,928
Speaker 0: Not for a few years.

1103
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:55,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1104
01:03:56,191 --> 01:03:57,524
Speaker 0: I mean, iPhones aren't even 300 bucks.

1105
01:04:00,191 --> 01:04:01,142
Speaker 1: Android phone is 600 bucks.

1106
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:04,972
Speaker 0: An unsupervised iPhone five is like 800.

1107
01:04:04,972 --> 01:04:05,344
Speaker 0: Forget it.

1108
01:04:06,235 --> 01:04:07,248
Speaker 0: You need a lot of monies.

1109
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:20,029
Speaker 1: But mark my words, augmented reality is going to take the people who use it over the next five and 10 years to a surprising level of connectedness that is going to leave everyone else behind.

1110
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:26,110
Speaker 1: And society is going to start changing in really weird ways because it's like a diffuse brain injury.

1111
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:27,870
Speaker 1: Some people are moving faster than others.

1112
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:33,084
Speaker 1: So suddenly within individual families and individual communities, I mean, imagine this future.

1113
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:38,790
Speaker 1: I'm walking down the street and this is a future of three years from now, Yelp reviews are just kind of popping up over restaurants.

1114
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:41,750
Speaker 1: I look at the one restaurant that isn't on Yelp.

1115
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:43,008
Speaker 1: I don't even see it.

1116
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:44,127
Speaker 1: I don't even know it's there.

1117
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:45,970
Speaker 1: It's just what's that building?

1118
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:46,389
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1119
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,329
Speaker 1: There's no name over it.

1120
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:48,165
Speaker 1: Why would I even look there?

1121
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:52,110
Speaker 1: Or the secret theater shows up out of nowhere.

1122
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:54,310
Speaker 1: I think that doesn't even exist except occasionally.

1123
01:04:55,631 --> 01:04:57,299
Speaker 1: I'm really excited about this future.

1124
01:04:57,319 --> 01:04:59,990
Speaker 0: or, you know, there could be just a door on the side of the street.

1125
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:00,948
Speaker 0: Looks like a maintenance door.

1126
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:04,109
Speaker 0: But anyone with glass can see that what it really is.

1127
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:04,744
Speaker 1: Imagine.

1128
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:07,210
Speaker 0: Imagine an arcade of awesome.

1129
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:10,650
Speaker 1: We're talking about adults like us who want to use this stuff.

1130
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,210
Speaker 1: Imagine being in middle school and have an access to this shit.

1131
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,789
Speaker 0: Everyone's drawn penises in the teacher's face, but the teachers all old and crut, fuddy duddy, they don't notice.

1132
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:21,870
Speaker 1: And they try to ban glass in the classroom, but then they probably will.

1133
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,947
Speaker 1: I mean, when I went to high school, you couldn't bring a cell phone to school.

1134
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:27,810
Speaker 0: You can't now either.

1135
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:28,268
Speaker 0: No.

1136
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,610
Speaker 1: A lot of people can bring them to school.

1137
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:30,570
Speaker 1: They have to keep them in their lockers.

1138
01:05:30,690 --> 01:05:36,990
Speaker 0: There's a truck outside of the school downtown where if you're a kid, you go to the truck and give them like a few bucks every day.

1139
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:40,470
Speaker 0: They hold on to your phone and you pick up the phone from the truck after school.

1140
01:05:40,551 --> 01:05:43,570
Speaker 0: It's like a private business that just realized kids had this problem.

1141
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,450
Speaker 1: Now, see, that's a problem.

1142
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:50,468
Speaker 1: So schools don't let kids have cell phones in an era where that level of connectedness is a big deal.

1143
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:51,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1144
01:05:51,631 --> 01:05:53,630
Speaker 0: It's like saying, all right, people, let's teach.

1145
01:05:53,770 --> 01:06:02,449
Speaker 0: We need to teach you how to get by and get jobs and live in this 21st century society by coming to the school where you may only caveman.

1146
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:04,889
Speaker 0: Here is how you hit with club.

1147
01:06:05,417 --> 01:06:05,670
Speaker 0: All right.

1148
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,549
Speaker 0: Now go back to your normal everyday lives.

1149
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:10,250
Speaker 1: It's already like that in every other realm.

1150
01:06:10,671 --> 01:06:11,430
Speaker 1: Social studies.

1151
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:14,330
Speaker 1: Hey, let's learn about democracy and freedom of speech.

1152
01:06:14,951 --> 01:06:21,310
Speaker 1: Oh, you can't write that article about the principal in the school paper and you don't get to vote on whether or not we have a school uniform.

1153
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:23,830
Speaker 0: The hypocrisy.

1154
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:24,121
Speaker 1: Yep.

1155
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:25,708
Speaker 0: We don't want justice.

1156
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:26,570
Speaker 0: We want quiet.

1157
01:06:28,932 --> 01:06:31,410
Speaker 1: The thing is I can feel occasionally my brain.

1158
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:35,936
Speaker 1: I'll be at like an anime con and some kids like, and a part of my brain is like, shut up.

1159
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:37,950
Speaker 1: And then another part of my brain is like, you know what?

1160
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:38,347
Speaker 1: I don't care.

1161
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,266
Speaker 1: Just don't care.

1162
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:48,169
Speaker 0: Hey, if I do a glass, I just be like, I would see who that was and give them a thumbs down and then I would, they would be muted depending on what they're doing.

1163
01:06:48,591 --> 01:06:48,902
Speaker 0: They'd be muted.

1164
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,009
Speaker 0: I wouldn't hear him anymore.

1165
01:06:50,391 --> 01:06:50,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1166
01:06:51,910 --> 01:07:03,450
Speaker 1: But this, our society is going to change in surprising, sometimes dangerous ways and augmented reality is going to rapidly faster than any of you think is going to happen, drive this.

1167
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:10,050
Speaker 0: And the thing is, if you're not in it, it's just dangerous, more dangerous for you to not be in it right then to be in it.

1168
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:13,350
Speaker 0: If you are able, if you're able, you really just need to get on it.

1169
01:07:13,430 --> 01:07:15,108
Speaker 0: Otherwise it's only going to hurt you.

1170
01:07:15,771 --> 01:07:23,470
Speaker 0: Like there's a reason people are looking at each other and smiling and meanwhile, you know, your face has poo poo on it and they're making fun of you and you don't even know.

1171
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:23,928
Speaker 0: this is going on.

1172
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:28,690
Speaker 1: There was a recent, a relatively, that's the lightest example that Scott should watch.

1173
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,349
Speaker 1: I should watch.

1174
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:31,270
Speaker 1: I've only seen a little bit of it, but it's been highly recommended.

1175
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:40,110
Speaker 0: It's called Denno coil and it's basically set in a, well, that's more pokemons, but if it is, yes, I should program fucking Google glass Pokemon.

1176
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:40,541
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1177
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:42,519
Speaker 0: King following you around, you know what.

1178
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,369
Speaker 0: you're walking down the street and like you just see a Bulbasaur hanging out behind that dumpster.

1179
01:07:46,531 --> 01:07:48,150
Speaker 1: Well that's the plot of this anime.

1180
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:52,930
Speaker 1: The anime is a really kind of realistic look at, imagine a world where kids grow up with augmented reality.

1181
01:07:53,050 --> 01:08:00,025
Speaker 1: So every kid has his pet Pokemon and all the kids see the shared reality that no adult sees.

1182
01:08:00,571 --> 01:08:11,709
Speaker 1: Adults can interact with that and how different those kids are culturally from the people who don't see these things and how that changes their fundamental interaction, their fundamental socialization.

1183
01:08:12,410 --> 01:08:18,049
Speaker 1: I think shows like that are a vast understatement of how much things are going to change with augmented reality.

1184
01:08:18,609 --> 01:08:22,309
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm going to get in on his ground floor as I possibly can.

1185
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:27,323
Speaker 1: Geek Nights Mondays might turn into the augmented reality show once we get these, if we get them.

1186
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,069
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, eventually we, you know, who wants a podcast, right?

1187
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:35,429
Speaker 0: We'll just sort of look at each other and everyone else who's cool, we'll just sort of know what's up and then, uh, that's it.

1188
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:36,229
Speaker 1: I do suspect.

1189
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:38,729
Speaker 1: Here's one thing I think, cause I watched current Google glass.

1190
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,729
Speaker 1: You can kind of look up like it's not, it's not a complete overlay.

1191
01:08:42,069 --> 01:08:44,490
Speaker 0: No, it's a little, it's obviously in the top right corner, a little rectangle.

1192
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:56,209
Speaker 1: So I suspect all of us who use them heavily are going to have a tick when we're not wearing them or every, we're constantly just looking up to the left, up to the left, up to the right, wherever it is, we're going to be looking up, yep.

1193
01:08:58,078 --> 01:08:58,488
Speaker 1: Up to the left.

1194
01:09:00,216 --> 01:09:00,908
Speaker 1: It is up to the left.

1195
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,050
Speaker 0: I thought it was up to the right.

1196
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:04,630
Speaker 1: No, take these glasses I'm looking at and rotate them.

1197
01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:05,549
Speaker 0: Why would you rotate them?

1198
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:06,263
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1199
01:09:06,911 --> 01:09:10,490
Speaker 1: Oh no, it's, it's inverted because this part's blurry and that part's not.

1200
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:11,187
Speaker 1: It's like a tilt shift.

1201
01:09:11,974 --> 01:09:12,229
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1202
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:15,229
Speaker 0: I think you need to go to the eye doctor before you go to get the Google glass.

1203
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:21,290
Speaker 1: Actually, when I was looking at mockups of if you mount them onto existing glasses, you can mount, like you can get one for either side.

1204
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:25,930
Speaker 0: One thing I'm worried about is I have, you know, I'm a person who doesn't wear glasses, but I wear sunglasses often.

1205
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,089
Speaker 0: You're going to lose them immediately.

1206
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:34,529
Speaker 0: So I need to put like, I need to put them on with sunglasses, take the sunglasses off, leave the Google glass on, you know, and then put the Google glass on with the sunglasses without the sunglasses.

1207
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,429
Speaker 1: Scott, welcome to the last 20 years of my life.

1208
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:39,126
Speaker 0: But now I'm double glasses and switching.

1209
01:09:40,331 --> 01:09:41,388
Speaker 1: Scott, double glasses.

1210
01:09:41,912 --> 01:09:42,710
Speaker 1: That's what I have.

1211
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:45,209
Speaker 1: I have to take off my regular glasses and put on my sunglasses.

1212
01:09:45,691 --> 01:09:47,430
Speaker 0: But this is the thing that goes with the glasses.

1213
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:54,790
Speaker 0: So like I'll snap the Google glass off of the sunglasses, put it on by itself, then snap it onto the sunglasses and put them both on and it's like, whatever.

1214
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:55,990
Speaker 1: Anyway, we'll see.

1215
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,190
Speaker 1: I, I'm, I'm, I reek of effort in my attempts to get these.

1216
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:02,890
Speaker 1: I put a lot of work and thought into my application, as did Scott.

1217
01:10:08,731 --> 01:10:10,870
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1218
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:15,990
