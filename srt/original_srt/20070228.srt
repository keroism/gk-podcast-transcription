1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,049
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 28th.

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:12,931
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:15,840
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,018
Speaker 0: We reviewed the New York comic-con at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

5
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,317
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,845
Speaker 0: So for the first time in a long time, I'm actually a little excited about an anime coming out Really?

7
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:30,093
Speaker 0: Well Scott downloaded.

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:39,120
Speaker 0: we finally watched this preview trailer interview special for this new anime called Moonlight Mile that's debuting in Japan in a few days.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:52,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually, you know previews what you download for anime, you know Tend to be really short and they don't tell you much about the show But I like to download them because it takes like five minutes to get one of these things.

10
00:00:52,375 --> 00:01:02,820
Speaker 1: when they do fan sub them And it just it saves me the trouble of downloading episode 1 And wasting, you know more time in my life trying to figure out if the show was worth watching or not.

11
00:01:03,382 --> 00:01:16,164
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is this looks really cool and it looks like kind of this gritty Serious take on exploration and politics and space and I guess it has the potential to be like gassaraki Which is something I really dig.

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:34,296
Speaker 1: Well, I think at this point pretty much any anime that isn't high school drama wacky high school crap a fighting show or any of the you know, typical Anime genres that are super popular is the show that we're gonna latch on to?

13
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:52,880
Speaker 1: yeah like ergo proxy It's like if you make a show that's like a serious plot that takes place in sort of the real world like a sci-fi anime or a real horror anime or a Real historical anime and not just samurai fighting Kenshin style.

14
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:53,905
Speaker 1: It doesn't.

15
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:58,653
Speaker 1: you don't have to do that great a job to get us to latch on to it Just because we're desperate at this point.

16
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:08,787
Speaker 1: So Moonlight Mile seems to be a serious show about Explorers and politics in space and Energy and all sorts of stuff.

17
00:02:08,827 --> 00:02:10,551
Speaker 1: So I hope it's good.

18
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:16,119
Speaker 1: And even if it's only kind of good Still kind of reaching here for it.

19
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,585
Speaker 0: The thing was I had never heard of the guy who directed it at Iku Suzuki as I looked it up and Apparently he hasn't done much.

20
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:28,160
Speaker 0: but he is known for dear s which he worked on not a good show.

21
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:35,123
Speaker 0: Maze which he worked on average as direct average to not good show and it looks like he directed the fake Oav.

22
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,127
Speaker 1: not a good show.

23
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:37,673
Speaker 0: also not that bad of a show.

24
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:38,516
Speaker 1: I never watched it.

25
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:39,520
Speaker 1: I've never seen it either.

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,747
Speaker 1: But isn't that a boy a man love show?

27
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,071
Speaker 0: It's rated highly.

28
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:43,814
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

29
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,837
Speaker 0: A lot of people like it.

30
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,705
Speaker 0: Alrighty I can't speak on it.

31
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:49,680
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll review it if you guys out there really want us to.

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,634
Speaker 1: I just heard that fake was a sort of a boy love show.

33
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:53,719
Speaker 1: So I kind of wrote it off.

34
00:02:55,361 --> 00:03:00,414
Speaker 0: So in the news, I suppose we should talk about that it's over it's done.

35
00:03:00,434 --> 00:03:10,893
Speaker 0: the American Anime Awards have finished their scam and With the final tragic, you know, they're gonna do it again next year.

36
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:12,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see about that.

37
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:17,534
Speaker 0: I'm telling you you me and Daryl Surratt have to make our own anime awards.

38
00:03:17,834 --> 00:03:26,220
Speaker 1: I think we should an independent Non Industry body should decide the American Anime Awards for stuff that happened this year only.

39
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:34,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you're gonna do stuff that's if you're gonna give a lifetime achievement award You don't go giving it to who do they give freaking awards to whatever.

40
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:38,138
Speaker 0: I mean our lizard pretty much be Satoshi khan Miyazaki.

41
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:40,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're basically before guys.

42
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,396
Speaker 1: Well, maybe five guys winning all the awards and everyone else would get dick.

43
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:48,880
Speaker 1: because well Maybe six guys and if you're not as good as them then you suck.

44
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:51,187
Speaker 0: Yeah, so who did win awards?

45
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:52,651
Speaker 0: I mean we talked about this.

46
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,093
Speaker 1: Well, let's see.

47
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:53,835
Speaker 1: Wait.

48
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,119
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the results.

49
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,083
Speaker 1: actually I'm not kidding.

50
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:57,309
Speaker 0: I'm looking at him right now.

51
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,371
Speaker 1: All right, so it was fan voting Which is why it sucked the primary reason why it sucked.

52
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:04,600
Speaker 1: So with fan I did see the nominees.

53
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:09,433
Speaker 1: So with fan voting I would say that Naruto had to win at least one award.

54
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:11,419
Speaker 0: Naruto didn't win dick.

55
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,262
Speaker 1: Wow Okay.

56
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:12,543
Speaker 1: All right.

57
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:13,246
Speaker 1: Let me try again.

58
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:14,492
Speaker 0: Well, remember I have.

59
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,220
Speaker 0: the categories were really weird.

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,420
Speaker 0: I mean, they have such things as best male actor in a comedy.

61
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:25,413
Speaker 1: Is it that Vic guy that is everyone's super popular these days?

62
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:27,380
Speaker 0: No, no Vic won an award for something else.

63
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:29,579
Speaker 1: Oh, well, at least I'm getting the right track.

64
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:37,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Vic won best actor but not best male actor in a comedy which goes to Dave Wittenberg for Zatch Bell.

65
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:39,528
Speaker 1: I never even heard of Dave Wittenberg.

66
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:46,293
Speaker 0: Zatch Bell had best actress in a comedy - Full Metal Alchemist won pretty much every normal award.

67
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:46,996
Speaker 1: Oh, I could.

68
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:47,899
Speaker 1: that was my next guess.

69
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:54,406
Speaker 0: Best actress went to Mary Elizabeth from Ghost in the Shell Standalone complex second gate.

70
00:04:54,467 --> 00:04:56,333
Speaker 1: Oh my god an award that makes sense.

71
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,927
Speaker 1: an anime that came out in the US this year With a great actress.

72
00:05:00,987 --> 00:05:01,569
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

73
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:02,511
Speaker 1: There's one award.

74
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:03,374
Speaker 1: They got one.

75
00:05:03,434 --> 00:05:04,477
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait, wait, though.

76
00:05:04,517 --> 00:05:05,600
Speaker 0: That was for the dub.

77
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was good.

78
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,010
Speaker 0: I haven't seen the dub.

79
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,873
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, she's all right.

80
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:09,295
Speaker 1: Really?

81
00:05:09,556 --> 00:05:09,697
Speaker 0: Yeah.

82
00:05:09,898 --> 00:05:13,980
Speaker 1: All right That's the only award on there that has any validity at all.

83
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:28,220
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah and remember according to the internet population who voted on the American anime Awards the best manga ever in the History of manga since anything that had been published in the US is up for grabs was fruits basket apparently.

84
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:33,589
Speaker 0: so I guess I gotta throw away all that sanctuary and and Buddha we got laying around.

85
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:41,320
Speaker 1: I guess Osamu Tezuka Katsuhiro Otomo and Masamune Shiro have nothing on I don't know just the popular shoujo of the day.

86
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:42,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't forget going a guy.

87
00:05:42,814 --> 00:05:49,500
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, yeah, I could have guessed that though cuz fruits basket is sort of the number one most popular manga in the US.

88
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:50,658
Speaker 1: So that does make sense.

89
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:54,150
Speaker 0: But oh, well, I just I can't reiterate enough.

90
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,460
Speaker 0: these American anime Awards are such a bullshit scam.

91
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:03,597
Speaker 0: I'm really surprised we haven't been sued or at least threatened for libel or slander, but that's the way it is.

92
00:06:03,617 --> 00:06:18,300
Speaker 1: I Think it's just that they wanted to make awards for I don't know because they felt like there weren't any and there had to be And they didn't actually bother to make the awards any good or have any meaning or respect?

93
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,550
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't need to remember the way these things work.

94
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,739
Speaker 0: is it's kind of this industry circle jerk?

95
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,371
Speaker 0: I mean look at the Academy Wars the real Oscars.

96
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,260
Speaker 0: I didn't even realize they happened until recently.

97
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:36,251
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that happened until the day after they happened when everyone started talking about what happened at them and I saw YouTube videos From it, but I never actually saw a list of winners.

98
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,078
Speaker 1: I don't even know what won best picture or anything.

99
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:38,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, me either.

100
00:06:38,861 --> 00:06:42,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pretty much never cared about in my life and I still don't care about him.

101
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:51,340
Speaker 0: But yeah from all the people who talk about going Candidly as opposed to the actors who try to pretend like they mean something they always say that it's boring as hell.

102
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,300
Speaker 0: I mean, I think Penn Jillette and teller said something to the effect of every award ceremony ever is just like the high school.

103
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,331
Speaker 1: Whatever Awards, it's so true.

104
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:00,155
Speaker 1: God so true.

105
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,920
Speaker 0: But yeah, thankfully we won't have to talk about this again.

106
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:13,800
Speaker 0: Hopefully next year, hopefully by next year either We'll be having our own anime Awards or these people will all be dead in a gutter.

107
00:07:14,362 --> 00:07:27,636
Speaker 1: I think what we should just do is the anime podcasters should get together every year Get a list of all the manga and all the anime that came out in the u.s That year and then we should pick and it'll just be the American anime podcaster awards.

108
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:29,200
Speaker 1: We'll decide among ourselves.

109
00:07:29,703 --> 00:07:33,160
Speaker 0: I think among ourselves by ourselves meaning us and our podcast friends.

110
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:42,697
Speaker 0: We have to decide who counts as an anime podcast Because I looked on dig the other day after I noticed that dig podcast searching was broken as I was trying to find a new podcast to listen to.

111
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:52,002
Speaker 0: Oh And there's a lot of anime podcasts out there now like they're growing exponentially and they all really Suck.

112
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:55,414
Speaker 1: Well, no, it would just be the anime podcasters.

113
00:07:55,454 --> 00:08:02,594
Speaker 0: We know yeah, it would just be us and Fast karate Darryl Surratt and Gerald and Clarissa on anime world order.

114
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just be Ninja Consultants.

115
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,503
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's who.

116
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,034
Speaker 1: it would be all those people some weekly anime review.

117
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,395
Speaker 1: Yep.

118
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:10,724
Speaker 1: They could be in there, too We wouldn't we?

119
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:14,133
Speaker 1: basically we would make a little coalition amongst ourselves.

120
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:16,600
Speaker 1: You wouldn't just let any anime podcaster vote.

121
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,787
Speaker 1: It would be us.

122
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:27,244
Speaker 0: we would all sit down together on Skype or something and discuss the winners amongst ourselves and of course the thing you can do to always at lend Legitimacy to anything like that.

123
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:36,291
Speaker 0: we'd send invitations to all the great directors of anime that are still alive Asking them for their votes on our nominations.

124
00:08:36,371 --> 00:08:37,575
Speaker 1: No, we don't need them to vote.

125
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,059
Speaker 0: No, no, we just asked him.

126
00:08:39,572 --> 00:08:39,758
Speaker 1: No, no.

127
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:49,736
Speaker 1: What you do is after you pick the winners you send letters to the people who won and if they want they could call in And we'll record like their acceptance speech.

128
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:50,460
Speaker 1: Thank you, whatever.

129
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,639
Speaker 0: No, but before that you see you're missing the point here.

130
00:08:53,102 --> 00:09:03,359
Speaker 0: If you even if no one responds to your letter at all Even if your letter gets lost in the mail You can then legally say that among the voting members of your board include blah blah.

131
00:09:04,642 --> 00:09:05,686
Speaker 1: I know that is necessary.

132
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:06,369
Speaker 0: Why not?

133
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,192
Speaker 1: if I think it's I think it's much better to for us We should just do the penny arcade style, but we were right.

134
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,780
Speaker 0: awards, you know, they stopped doing that.

135
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:15,519
Speaker 1: Well, that's just yeah, they missed it years and years ago.

136
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:16,484
Speaker 1: Yeah We should.

137
00:09:16,545 --> 00:09:17,576
Speaker 1: I think we need to pick it up.

138
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,800
Speaker 0: Someone needs to even if not us because the American Anime Awards are a blight upon this earth.

139
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,530
Speaker 1: Alright now I was gonna.

140
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 1: let's move on to my news Which is nothing because I was gonna talk about I guess something that was announced.

141
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Speaker 1: I mean the New York Comic Con happens.

142
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:39,364
Speaker 1: We're talking about this show and there were a lot of panels there and you had to imagine among all those panels and now They were all industry panels.

143
00:09:39,725 --> 00:09:44,720
Speaker 1: There had to be some news worth talking about but no none of it's really worth talking about.

144

Speaker 1: I mean such-and-such manga was licensed such-and-such comics are gonna come out such-and-such movies are now available Such-and-such people are working on such-and-such thing.

00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,460
Speaker 1: It's all just information.

147
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:04,010
Speaker 1: None of it is particularly interesting or new or exciting.

148
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,260
Speaker 1: You can go read it on newsarama and anime news network.

149
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,699
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother reiterating it.

150
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,383
Speaker 1: It's not worth it my time or the time in the podcast Of course.

151
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:14,551
Speaker 0: one final thing just so.

152
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:15,960
Speaker 0: you're all aware and you'll be ready for it.

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:28,580
Speaker 0: But later in the episode when I get to a certain thing that happened at the CPM booth I am now announcing that I a contest we're going to run for a Somewhat interesting prize that is currently sitting in front of me on my desk.

154
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,952
Speaker 0: Uh-oh, but we'll get to that when the time comes.

155
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:32,620
Speaker 1: I was just trying to get rid of crap.

156
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,248
Speaker 0: I don't want to spoil.

157
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,640
Speaker 1: we should do is all the crap at our house that we don't want anymore.

158
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,159
Speaker 1: We should just get rid of in contest.

159
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,529
Speaker 1: I feel like yeah, I eat this banana.

160
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,012
Speaker 1: I don't need this banana peel anymore.

161
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:45,098
Speaker 1: All right, nice contest for Scott's banana peel.

162
00:10:45,298 --> 00:10:50,542
Speaker 0: next Monday We'll have a contest for who can get the 12 inch CRT.

163
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,608
Speaker 0: that is sitting under my desk unused.

164
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:58,809
Speaker 1: Oh then after that don't tell him though that the week later There'll be a contest for the 710 inch CRT.

165
00:10:58,849 --> 00:10:59,492
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get rid of.

166
00:10:59,512 --> 00:11:01,280
Speaker 0: Oh, don't forget the 40 gig hard drive.

167
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,925
Speaker 0: That doesn't work.

168
00:11:02,348 --> 00:11:03,033
Speaker 1: Whoo.

169
00:11:03,275 --> 00:11:03,939
Speaker 1: Good prize.

170
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,952
Speaker 0: So that was kind of awesome.

171
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:20,717
Speaker 0: normally I say things the day right about then but instead for about 10 minutes I was saying such things as motherfucker shit shit shit.

172
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:24,380
Speaker 1: God, damn it crap ass shit motherfucker.

173
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:33,460
Speaker 0: You see between doing the front half of the show in the back half of the show I thought hey, let's get that cool Scott's thing of the day so I can put the audio in the show.

174
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:42,839
Speaker 0: So I started fiddling with my awesome mixer to record it and that Causes my awesome mixer to crap itself partly because my computer is physically a nightmare mess.

175
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,410
Speaker 1: And you're holding out replacing it until the summer.

176
00:11:46,491 --> 00:11:48,537
Speaker 1: God knows why you should have replaced it last summer.

177
00:11:48,557 --> 00:12:00,143
Speaker 0: Oh, no, sorry I lied three summers ago every day that I don't upgrade my computer the computer I'm going to get with the same amount of money is like 1% faster I know.

178
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:06,021
Speaker 1: but if by that logic you'll be sitting here in 2030 not buying a new computer.

179
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:15,590
Speaker 1: No, it's gonna push me over the line 31 the computer will be 10 bajillion terahertz instead of 90 bajillion terahertz.

180
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:25,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see we're still on this cusp here and to Write about when I'm gonna get a computer is right about when Team Fortress 2 is gonna come out and I'm gonna start playing FPS's again.

181
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:26,568
Speaker 0: But that's all beside the point.

182
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:31,850
Speaker 0: After rummaging around and hitting my computer on the side a bunch of times USB started working again.

183
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,094
Speaker 0: So we're back on the road.

184
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:34,580
Speaker 0: Oh by the road.

185
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,266
Speaker 0: I mean the road to podcast Ville.

186
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,339
Speaker 1: I Think we're already living in podcast Ville.

187
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:53,830
Speaker 1: so things of the day Right all this week are things of the day have been openers to various television shows from that are sung in other languages besides English.

188
00:12:54,432 --> 00:13:00,290
Speaker 1: Not and I can say foreign languages because this might be your home country that we're talking about here on Monday.

189
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:00,912
Speaker 1: What do we do?

190
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:02,759
Speaker 1: like you did Chinese Sailor Moon?

191
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,063
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I did.

192
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,070
Speaker 1: I don't remember doesn't matter.

193
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:06,550
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

194
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,776
Speaker 0: I don't think we need to do a recap.

195
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:10,270
Speaker 0: suffice to say check out the things of the day all week.

196
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:14,102
Speaker 0: Because of all these things out there we have been kind of picking the best.

197
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:16,349
Speaker 1: or I did Hebrew macron one.

198
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:24,932
Speaker 1: Yesterday you did Sonic Underground in French Mario Brothers Super Show in German.

199
00:13:25,153 --> 00:13:29,410
Speaker 0: now today we're going to prove probably something that we've been thinking about it now.

200
00:13:29,532 --> 00:13:30,489
Speaker 0: There's no way around it.

201
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:49,047
Speaker 0: It seems that the German people for whatever their good points and bad points are the masters of taking American or Japanese shows and either faithfully recreating the openers in their native language or in Creating entirely new openers that are in many ways better than the originals.

202
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:54,503
Speaker 1: Yes I present to you the original opener to Sailor Moon again.

203
00:13:54,524 --> 00:13:56,830
Speaker 1: Why is Sailor Moon showing up twice this week?

204
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:57,375
Speaker 1: I don't know.

205
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,172
Speaker 1: I don't even like Sailor Moon Moon.

206
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:00,955
Speaker 1: the germ.

207
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:06,070
Speaker 1: the original opener to Sailor Moon in German is so badass.

208
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,662
Speaker 1: It might be one of the best openers ever.

209
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,290
Speaker 0: I mean the music is really good.

210
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,649
Speaker 0: It's so good in the kind of techno that we like.

211
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,173
Speaker 0: It's good song.

212
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:31,003
Speaker 0: aside from that the opener itself like all the Sailor Moon openers is very well animated and very Stylistic and if the show were anything like that opener Sailor Moon would be a great freaking show man If Sailor Moon was like that opener, that would be holy crap.

213
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:31,485
Speaker 1: Awesome.

214
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,990
Speaker 1: I would watch every episode of that show.

215
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:40,779
Speaker 0: See the thing is the reason I watched all of Sailor Moon was that while the show is mostly monster of the day and you Know Sailor Moon style antics.

216
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:46,810
Speaker 0: There are a lot of scenes in the show Just not enough of them that are just like that opener.

217
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many scenes like that?

218
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,387
Speaker 0: like one every 20 episodes about one every eight or nine?

219
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:54,274
Speaker 1: It's not that bad It's still pretty bad.

220
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:58,309
Speaker 1: It should be the whole show and the whole show should only be 26 episodes long.

221
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:03,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah as opposed to 200, but yeah suffice to say I watched it all and it's not that bad of a show.

222
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:04,494
Speaker 0: There are worse.

223
00:15:04,897 --> 00:15:09,750
Speaker 1: I guess if you have nothing better to do with your time Then you can watch 200 episodes of Sailor Moon.

224
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,307
Speaker 1: But anyway things I want to point out about this opener.

225
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:22,476
Speaker 1: number one Of course, we said already the music in this opener is so badass Holy shit, and two there's like towards the middle of the opener There's a quick like.

226
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:26,670
Speaker 1: it's like less than a ten less than two seconds of animation.

227
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,670
Speaker 0: It's like three beats worth of stuff.

228
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,115
Speaker 1: Yeah of the masks.

229
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:36,759
Speaker 1: like turning around multiplying and then like the mask guys Sort of coming up and taking up the whole screen.

230
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:41,528
Speaker 1: like every time I see that imagery It just gives me this feeling of whoa.

231
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:44,339
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just like a new tenor in the Black Rose saga.

232
00:15:44,359 --> 00:15:50,781
Speaker 0: whenever it cuts to the basement where all those kids died long ago And they all just in one motion look back toward you.

233
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:52,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of.

234
00:15:52,468 --> 00:15:53,150
Speaker 1: it's really cool.

235
00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:00,275
Speaker 1: And if there was an anime they gave me that same feeling that I get when I see those masks turn around Throughout the whole anime.

236
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:01,660
Speaker 1: that'd be the best anime ever.

237
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:02,844
Speaker 0: now see this.

238
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,410
Speaker 0: this has happened before to us.

239
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,153
Speaker 0: You know this thing.

240
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:12,198
Speaker 0: the style and the mood and the vibe of this opener is So much darker and better than what Sailor Moon actually is.

241
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,465
Speaker 0: the same thing happened with you ten a movie.

242
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:19,310
Speaker 0: if you watch the AMVs To the you ten a movie they make that movie look amazing.

243
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:23,228
Speaker 0: You'll watch them and think holy shit this movie is gonna be the best thing ever.

244
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,514
Speaker 1: no It's not snake cars.

245
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:27,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, naked cars, but you wouldn't know that from those music video.

246
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,450
Speaker 0: No, cuz naked cars aren't in the music videos, so I was gonna do the one-piece opener in Italian.

247
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,350
Speaker 1: Oh my god is the one-piece opener in Italian awesome?

248
00:16:36,732 --> 00:16:43,067
Speaker 0: It is so much better than the Japanese and the American openers I agree, but the right.

249
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:58,066
Speaker 0: instead I want to do the opener to gargoyles the American cartoon in Germany now while in unlike the Sailor Moon thing which is totally different and better it is pretty much a straight-up Perfect rendition just had happens to be in German.

250
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:05,790
Speaker 0: in fact It sounds a little bit cooler because the German language at least to my American ears sounds a little bit more dark and medieval.

251
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,922
Speaker 1: Maybe because that's where the medieval stuff happened.

252
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:09,726
Speaker 1: You know in Germany.

253
00:17:09,867 --> 00:17:11,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah But it just.

254
00:17:11,936 --> 00:17:20,980
Speaker 0: I like gargoyles, and I like this German opener And I think this proves that the Germans are absolute badasses when it comes to Remastering or remaking the openings of shows.

255
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:27,361
Speaker 1: maybe they try really hard at it I have no idea, but yeah the German opener to the gargoyles TV.

256
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,885
Speaker 1: Show is tat awesome.

257
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,690
Speaker 0: so enough awesome.

258
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,609
Speaker 0: Let's review the New York comic-con.

259
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:43,230
Speaker 1: Alright, so New York comic-con for those of you who do not know is a comic primarily comic convention But it also includes anime and gaming in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

260
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:48,746
Speaker 1: This is the the second annual one happened this past weekend.

261
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,010
Speaker 0: That was an awkward sentence.

262
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,618
Speaker 0: Yes, you see you might remember.

263
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,870
Speaker 0: We've talked about it a bit, and we did a show on it last year.

264
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:07,610
Speaker 0: But last year they tried to do a New York comic-con for the first time ever and it was perhaps the most poorly managed debacle of a disaster to ever have graced New York City at least in terms of anime manga comic conventions.

265
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:15,950
Speaker 1: Yes, well basically to sum it up They decided to have a convention in New York City because there wasn't one and it felt like there should be which is correct.

266
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,793
Speaker 0: They did it eating.

267
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,600
Speaker 0: There's a reason why there aren't any.

268
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:29,461
Speaker 1: there's a reason why there aren't any conventions in New York City At least not nerdy ones because there aren't any convention centers in New York City that are Good for having nerdy conventions in.

269
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:31,430
Speaker 0: yeah, we're not going to talk about what happened last time.

270
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,659
Speaker 0: We've talked about it enough yet.

271
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,363
Speaker 0: I want to hear about.

272
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,423
Speaker 1: just to sum it up They had a lot more people than they could handle.

273
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,670
Speaker 1: they had to turn people away.

274
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:38,636
Speaker 1: It was unhappy.

275
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:39,481
Speaker 1: It was crowded.

276
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,306
Speaker 1: It was black.

277
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:49,109
Speaker 0: so this year They got more space and they tried to rectify these problems and instead we got to see the actual con Which had a very different set of problems?

278
00:18:49,850 --> 00:19:02,349
Speaker 1: Well, yeah basically, I think the number one problem with the convention this year is the timing of things and The like basic simple logistics of what went on.

279
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,230
Speaker 1: It's like you could buy a ticket and you could get in and they stopped selling tickets for Friday.

280
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,000
Speaker 1: So everyone who paid got in and no one showed up.

281
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:17,890
Speaker 1: if you showed up and didn't get a ticket and get in That was your own damn fault for not visiting the website or not reading any information, you know.

282
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,715
Speaker 1: So that problem was averted.

283
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:20,717
Speaker 1: They solved that one.

284
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:21,720
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

285
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,362
Speaker 1: They did have.

286
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:25,590
Speaker 1: let's use our personal experience as the example.

287
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,457
Speaker 1: We show up.

288
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:34,703
Speaker 1: All right on Saturday Friday We have Friday only badges and on Friday The con is open to normal people from 4 p.m.

289
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:35,366
Speaker 1: To 9 p.m.

290
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,000
Speaker 0: Now now think about 4 to 9 p.m.

291
00:19:38,382 --> 00:19:39,347
Speaker 0: And it costs us what 30 bucks.

292
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:46,066
Speaker 0: Yep, see I'm trying not to be hard on this con, but 30 bucks for 4 p.m.

293
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:53,770
Speaker 0: To 9 p.m Where for very little much more than that I can get a whole weekend at Katsu con or Otakon.

294
00:19:54,413 --> 00:20:02,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, the prices the badges don't really make too much sense Unless you buy the weekend pass which is sort of annoying because there's no reason as I will get to.

295
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:05,563
Speaker 1: there's no reason to Buy a weekend pass to the newer comic sadly.

296
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,569
Speaker 0: That was the saving grace.

297
00:20:06,629 --> 00:20:14,699
Speaker 0: Sure It was only open 4 to 9 but by 6 45 I had done everything I wanted to do with the con and I grabbed my stuff and left.

298
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:15,341
Speaker 1: Yep.

299
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,470
Speaker 1: I left soon after I think like seven something.

300
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,133
Speaker 1: Ish I left.

301
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:20,177
Speaker 1: I don't really remember.

302
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,070
Speaker 0: you could literally do everything at this con in two hours.

303
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:33,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean not coming unless you if you're someone who cares about buying comics first of all This isn't the con for you because there isn't much in the way of buying comics.

304
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:43,009
Speaker 1: and to Even if you did want to buy comics and you came there to buy them now, you know that would basically take you a half a day to look through all the comics there.

305
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:54,530
Speaker 1: and If you wanted to go to panels and events, which I don't really you know I'm not interested in the panels and events that they were offering then maybe it would be worth it to go all three days.

306
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:04,288
Speaker 0: but yeah, except all the panels that are worthwhile cost extra money and sell out and are hard to get to or Happen before anyone can actually get into the car.

307
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:06,419
Speaker 1: Yes That's what I was trying to allude to before.

308
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:07,926
Speaker 1: the number one problem with this convention.

309
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:09,192
Speaker 1: We show up We have.

310
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,370
Speaker 1: they were smart in that we could get our badges any time during the day.

311
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, we showed up at like two o'clock.

312
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:15,358
Speaker 0: We went in.

313
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:16,161
Speaker 0: there was no line.

314
00:21:16,201 --> 00:21:16,703
Speaker 0: No crowd.

315
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,025
Speaker 0: We got our badges and alright Let's go get some food.

316
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:20,489
Speaker 0: So we left.

317
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:26,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we looked and there were people who were waiting to get in the doors at 4 p.m Cuz until 4 p.m.

318
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:34,514
Speaker 1: It was like, you know exhibitors and industry only time which I think they should have moved to Thursday and had Friday been every one Day, but whatever.

319
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:37,428
Speaker 1: and there are people waiting in line to get in the door at 4 p.m.

320
00:21:38,072 --> 00:21:41,866
Speaker 1: Maybe like a hundred people 200 at the most I counted.

321
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:47,290
Speaker 0: there were about 180 people because I had that stupid axe clicker since we got a box of a billion of them from Katsu Kan.

322
00:21:47,777 --> 00:21:55,110
Speaker 1: yeah, and There was no point in us waiting for two hours in that line so that we could be among the first to get into a room.

323
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:58,910
Speaker 0: So of course because there's no food anywhere near the Javits we walked aways.

324
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,725
Speaker 1: We walked aways to like 8th Avenue.

325
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:02,470
Speaker 1: We got some food.

326
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:05,027
Speaker 1: We came back at around 3. ish.

327
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,521
Speaker 1: So we got an hour until the doors open.

328
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:15,410
Speaker 1: when we get back at 3 There was a line going from where the line was before out into the street and we had already checked our coat.

329
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:19,904
Speaker 1: So there was no way we were going outside again now, so we're smart.

330
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,867
Speaker 0: now all these other people.

331
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:28,656
Speaker 0: we watch people Trying to like game their way into the line or cut ahead of people or you know Just kind of walk in the door.

332
00:22:28,977 --> 00:22:31,690
Speaker 0: and there's this one awesome security dude standing there.

333
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:34,190
Speaker 0: He was probably the best part of the whole con as far as I was concerned.

334
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:39,583
Speaker 0: Maybe he's standing there and he's just yelling with high energy keeping these nerds in line.

335
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:40,305
Speaker 0: Keep walking.

336
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:48,042
Speaker 0: Let's talk in yelling at him Very much ridiculing anyone who actually tried to jive him and get into the line where they shouldn't.

337
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:52,785
Speaker 0: and he was sending everyone outside and telling them they Were stupid for trying to get into the line at the middle.

338
00:22:53,228 --> 00:22:55,801
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm He was the only reason this didn't descend into chaos.

339
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,470
Speaker 0: that single man saved the con.

340
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:05,132
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean because he pretty much beyond him was the roped off area where you don't need so many people to manage because this roped Off area.

341
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:11,169
Speaker 1: but you know, he was managing everyone who is not in the roped off area keeping them from being stupid.

342
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:19,879
Speaker 0: now I gotta say the sheer number of people at this con who tried to sneak in or cut in line or get past This guy was astounding to me.

343
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:21,790
Speaker 0: it averaged about two or three a minute.

344
00:23:22,284 --> 00:23:26,062
Speaker 1: Yeah it was kind of crazy like how many people were trying to like sneak around.

345
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:35,152
Speaker 0: the guy was getting more and more angry as time went on as people kept coming up with sob stories or excuses or trying to like distract him and get around behind him just to cut in line, he

346
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:47,960
Speaker 1: was cool though because obviously this line was for people who had badges already and wanted to get in you know to the actual con and Anytime someone showed up to him without a badge yet.

347
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:52,015
Speaker 1: He would say go up there get your badge and when you come back I'll let you in here.

348
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:52,920
Speaker 1: At least he was cool.

349
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,930
Speaker 1: You know, he wasn't like mean or anything.

350
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:05,119
Speaker 1: Anyway as a result of this crazy line and there being only one entrance to the convention The convention that supposedly started at 4 p.m.

351
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,428
Speaker 1: We couldn't get into it until past 5 p.m.

352
00:24:09,291 --> 00:24:13,590
Speaker 0: In fact, it was about 5 30 little after 5 30 that we finally got through the doors.

353
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,903
Speaker 0: And the thing is there wasn't really wasn't any reason for it to take that long it.

354
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:20,290
Speaker 0: the line could have been easily processed faster.

355
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,337
Speaker 0: I don't know what they were doing.

356
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,450
Speaker 0: Maybe they only had one guy at the front checking badges.

357
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:29,268
Speaker 1: It was like a single file line of everyone who wanted to get into the con right away at 4 p.m.

358
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,939
Speaker 1: Now here's why it had to be a single file line.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,430
Speaker 1: It could have been like a five file line.

360
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,970
Speaker 1: It could have been three or four or five file lines.

361
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,970
Speaker 1: There are multiple entrances to this place.

362
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,237
Speaker 0: Well, here's what really bothered me.

363
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,390
Speaker 0: after we got into the con and I got bored.

364
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:50,290
Speaker 0: So I went to leave and I noticed after I went out and got my coat That there was no line to get in and there was almost no security or anything.

365
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 0: So on a whim I just walked back up without my badge visible and had no trouble getting anywhere.

366
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:57,678
Speaker 0: I wanted to go just about.

367
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,409
Speaker 1: yeah, it's kind of silly.

368
00:25:00,072 --> 00:25:03,750
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, so we finally get in after standing in the first.

369
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,356
Speaker 1: There's a problem with this.

370
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:16,698
Speaker 1: the fact that the con opens at 4 right and people can't Realistically get into the convention until about 5, you know what the problem is Well, wasn't there an event that you wanted to go to it for?

371
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:18,745
Speaker 1: there are a lot of things scheduled for 4g.

372
00:25:21,092 --> 00:25:21,795
Speaker 1: That's great.

373
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:25,067
Speaker 1: You scheduled something for 4 when even though the con is open.

374
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:25,790
Speaker 1: No one can get in.

375
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,070
Speaker 1: I mean even conventions like, you know Otacon are not so run by fans.

376
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:35,062
Speaker 1: This is a convention New York Comic Con run by the industry.

377
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,266
Speaker 1: It is paid for.

378
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:39,135
Speaker 1: there's a Company that runs the thing.

379
00:25:39,196 --> 00:25:40,519
Speaker 1: It's a company.

380
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,502
Speaker 1: read exhibitions.

381
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:43,247
Speaker 1: All they do is run conventions.

382
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:44,410
Speaker 1: That is their job.

383
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,754
Speaker 1: They run trade shows.

384
00:25:46,135 --> 00:25:57,210
Speaker 1: you think they would know better than to have events at the same time as you start letting people in Like someone's gonna come into the door at the exact moment the con starts and run to an event immediately.

385
00:25:57,774 --> 00:25:59,909
Speaker 1: Otacon is that smart enough not to do that?

386
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:06,531
Speaker 1: In fact every anime con I've ever been to even the really terrible ones like Ohio con 2.0.

387
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,735
Speaker 1: I don't know how con is now But you have a con.

388
00:26:10,016 --> 00:26:15,170
Speaker 1: you don't start your programming your scheduled programming until a little bit after.

389
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,384
Speaker 1: You know you give people time to get into the convention.

390
00:26:18,766 --> 00:26:23,569
Speaker 1: you have your main You know room open so people have something to do as soon as they get in.

391
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:30,150
Speaker 1: But you don't start scheduled events until people have time to get into the convention center, that's just stupid.

392
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:33,531
Speaker 0: So we finally get in and there's a big open area We can see.

393
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:40,550
Speaker 0: it's pretty much to your left is a gigantic dealer's room and that's it a dealer slash exhibition room.

394
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,229
Speaker 0: It's just a dealer's room.

395
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:47,310
Speaker 1: Did you actually know if you actually look at who's in that room only about?

396
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,814
Speaker 1: 25% of it is Dealing and selling shit.

397
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:56,730
Speaker 1: the rest of it is all people just exhibiting shit and showing stuff off, but it wasn't anything special.

398
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,412
Speaker 0: I mean there was no.

399
00:26:57,552 --> 00:27:02,367
Speaker 0: there were mediocre games that were being demoed and effectively was just marketing.

400
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty That's what exhibition is.

401
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:14,085
Speaker 0: yeah, and to your right was a little escalator that went up to the artist alley area Except there was a line to go up the escalator And they couldn't let anyone up until people came down already.

402
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,170
Speaker 0: mind you the kind of just started.

403
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:21,650
Speaker 0: We just gotten in the door and pretty much It was almost impossible to get up there at any time, and they weren't managing this line very well.

404
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:33,430
Speaker 0: There was one guy and every time one person came down the escalator you let one person up and the line pretty much went Straight across the entrance to the con preventing anyone trying to get in from getting anywhere else without shoving through them.

405
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:39,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah They should have just turned the and no one even said no one even said what the line was.

406
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:48,668
Speaker 0: so there was just this crowd of people and then this other crowd of people standing around this crowd of people trying to figure Out what this first crowd of people is for and he after the guard he pretty much just said I don't know.

407
00:27:49,412 --> 00:27:56,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically when I went up to the escalator when I was done in the X main exhibition hall I wanted to go upstairs to the artist alley the guy.

408
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:59,654
Speaker 1: you would just stop everyone from going up the escalator Unless you had us.

409
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:02,469
Speaker 1: unless you were a special person then he would just let you up then.

410
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,944
Speaker 1: You know people are basically constantly coming down the escalators.

411
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,470
Speaker 1: many people has wanted to come down.

412
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,218
Speaker 1: They didn't care and then every like minute.

413
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,190
Speaker 1: He would let like 10 people up the escalator, then he would stop everyone.

414
00:28:14,351 --> 00:28:15,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would let 10 people.

415
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:23,726
Speaker 0: I went over here earlier than Scott while he was still looking around the dealer area And when I finally got up there, I couldn't actually go into the artist alley.

416
00:28:23,786 --> 00:28:32,039
Speaker 0: It was so full of people I literally would have had to push people out of my way or stand there and shuffle at a rate slower than an old person Buying fruit at a convenience store.

417
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:46,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, the artists alley was Ludicrously crowded and the out the aisles in the artists alley were very narrow Narrower than they should have been and the actual booths at the artists alley were kind of small and close together.

418
00:28:46,851 --> 00:29:00,017
Speaker 1: So like if there was a popular guy at a booth next to you and like three people were waiting to talk to him they would basically cover the front of your booth and then make it harder for people to walk in the aisle and Etc etc.

419
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:00,480
Speaker 1: etc.

420
00:29:00,904 --> 00:29:01,650
Speaker 1: if they have it.

421
00:29:02,453 --> 00:29:14,310
Speaker 1: I think the problem was and this is actually one good thing about the New York comic convention Usually when you go to a comic convention, right the the semi famous people or the famous people are guests of the convention.

422
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,569
Speaker 1: You know, they have panels, you know, they wheel them out for autographs and stuff like that.

423
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,941
Speaker 1: But they don't usually have artists alley tables.

424
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:25,479
Speaker 1: artists alley tables are for you know The small-time people who they're not guests of the convention.

425
00:29:25,499 --> 00:29:26,984
Speaker 1: they pay to get in there and whatever.

426
00:29:27,346 --> 00:29:29,512
Speaker 1: at the New York comic convention There were

427
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:30,154
Speaker 0: lots of

428
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:48,250
Speaker 1: famous creators who would have been guests of honor at most mid to small sized comic conventions and Since the New York Comic Con was so big and so up there these people were just in artists alley Which was awesome except for the fact that artists alley was tiny.

429
00:29:48,712 --> 00:29:53,112
Speaker 1: Thus it created a bigger problem when you have a famous guy just sitting there going hi How you doing?

430
00:29:53,614 --> 00:29:57,028
Speaker 1: And now people are lining up and crowding around in a cramped artists alley.

431
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:06,040
Speaker 0: granted I'll admit since I don't really read many comics I didn't know who any of those people were so I had really no reason to be up there and I I wanted to just But I couldn't really know.

432
00:30:06,081 --> 00:30:07,470
Speaker 1: browsing is pretty much impossible.

433
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,910
Speaker 0: The only thing I could have done there was look for names of people, but I don't recognize any of these people.

434
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,508
Speaker 0: So I just gave up after about 10 minutes of trying to squeeze in.

435
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:21,916
Speaker 1: Yeah I basically walked up and down the artists alley looking at the people's names above the booths and then looking down to see if they Were actually there.

436
00:30:21,996 --> 00:30:24,754
Speaker 1: if I recognize the name, let's see What else is going on.

437
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:27,610
Speaker 1: at the end of the artists alley was the podcast arena?

438
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,679
Speaker 1: I think which is where all the comic podcasts were hanging out and You know, they had a lot of room over there.

439
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,830
Speaker 1: they were having a good old time and whoo-hoo awesome for them.

440
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:38,569
Speaker 1: I went over there.

441
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,266
Speaker 1: I talked to a bunch of people and it was awesome fun going down that away.

442
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:47,090
Speaker 1: if you're interested in Podcasts if you didn't know those people if you didn't you weren't interested in podcast.

443
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,134
Speaker 1: You're privately just like.

444
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,760
Speaker 1: what the fuck is this shit Charles?

445
00:30:50,101 --> 00:30:50,924
Speaker 1: Who are these people?

446
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:52,550
Speaker 1: Why are they in between?

447
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:56,169
Speaker 1: You know the gaming room and the artists alley, huh?

448
00:30:56,832 --> 00:31:01,247
Speaker 1: You know, whatever it was cool to have a podcast arena that was sort of like.

449
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:06,870
Speaker 1: noted It shows that the con is respecting podcasts in some way, but I don't know.

450
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:14,910
Speaker 1: It didn't really seem to do anything except provide the podcasters with a fun place to hang out for them And a place for their listeners to meet up and hang out.

451
00:31:15,091 --> 00:31:21,464
Speaker 0: I imagine the only reason they have podcasting there at all is Simply because they expect these people to cover the con and those provide more press.

452
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:27,766
Speaker 1: perhaps perhaps I mean, it really does seem like the New York Comic Con is incredibly podcast friendly.

453
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:28,950
Speaker 1: I mean they have their own podcast.

454
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:31,979
Speaker 1: They're podcasting all their panels over time.

455
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:41,048
Speaker 1: the guy who runs the con goes on podcasts and talks to people You know, so I guess they're really trying to harness the power of podcasting in some way.

456
00:31:41,249 --> 00:31:51,390
Speaker 1: great Yeah, and beyond there was the gaming room, which I didn't go in But it was basically a bunch of CCG is being played and stuff like that And that was also where the autographs were being done.

457
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,129
Speaker 1: But I didn't even know that because there was no way to know that.

458
00:31:55,632 --> 00:32:07,269
Speaker 1: I actually heard stories from other people that they wanted to go to someone's autograph session, you know Cuz I don't really care about autographs and they couldn't find it because it was hidden in the side of the game room and there Wasn't much signage to tell you that it was going on.

459
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:12,850
Speaker 0: So pretty much the only other thing we did was wander around the giant dealers room and not even all of it.

460
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,969
Speaker 0: I mean half of it was just people selling comics.

461
00:32:15,572 --> 00:32:19,309
Speaker 1: yeah, the back like left-hand corner was just people selling comics.

462
00:32:19,329 --> 00:32:24,374
Speaker 1: and You know, I guess if you want to buy comics Good for you.

463
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:27,206
Speaker 1: But if you're in New York City, why don't you to go to a convention for that?

464
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:33,196
Speaker 1: There's like four Tremendous awesome comic book stores that you can go to though at least a better deal in this area.

465
00:32:33,256 --> 00:32:44,607
Speaker 0: konami had a big setup and they were pushing you all the new DDR mixes and They gave us a bunch of free CDs of the music from all their new mixes Which of course we actually kind of threw him for a loop.

466
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:49,494
Speaker 0: when you know They give them to us and we said something like oh, yeah We had these Akatsukan.

467
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:53,750
Speaker 0: we were giving them away and they were taken aback by this like what how'd you get him?

468
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,555
Speaker 0: And then we just left.

469
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:55,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

470
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:59,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I Guess one of them.

471
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,063
Speaker 1: it was an EBE giveaway, I guess right?

472
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:02,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, we only had one of them.

473
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,939
Speaker 1: They gave us three or four that we didn't have already.

474
00:33:05,461 --> 00:33:07,550
Speaker 1: Oh, well, what else was in that main dealers room?

475
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,773
Speaker 1: That was good to look at.

476
00:33:08,994 --> 00:33:13,710
Speaker 0: Well CPM was selling stuff, you know CPM the company that's pretty much going out of business.

477
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:16,364
Speaker 0: Yep, if they're not well, they're effectively out of business.

478
00:33:16,384 --> 00:33:17,510
Speaker 0: They're just selling off their stock.

479
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:19,065
Speaker 0: So we talked to them for a while.

480
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:19,530
Speaker 0: They were cool.

481
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:19,972
Speaker 0: They had.

482
00:33:19,992 --> 00:33:36,298
Speaker 0: it wasn't just you know, like the usual five dollar DVDs or whatever's deal I bought a pile of really bad anime for almost no money including a silent service and Grappler Baki, we're not watching that shit.

483
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,806
Speaker 0: No, however, the guys were really cool.

484
00:33:38,826 --> 00:33:50,585
Speaker 0: We talked to him for a while and When they you know rang up my order and they gave me my little baggie with my DVDs in it He grabbed a fistful of other Stuff and shoved it in the bag and said here you go now.

485
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:51,690
Speaker 0: little did I know at the time?

486
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,088
Speaker 0: But he was actually trying to kill me.

487
00:33:53,613 --> 00:34:07,330
Speaker 0: You see when I got on the train to go home I looked in the bag and among the things that he had shoved in there without my asking or paying for Was the soundtrack the OST to the second worst anime ever MD Geist?

488
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:11,260
Speaker 0: OMG, so thus I'm going to have a little contest.

Speaker 1: what else did we see?

509
00:35:08,784 --> 00:35:09,750
Speaker 1: that was cool in the dealers room?

510
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:16,690
Speaker 1: Oh, there was a. there was like a sci-fi DVD purse selling person, but they had a lot of cheap anime DVDs.

511
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,763
Speaker 1: We got all of ko beast for $25.

512
00:35:19,763 --> 00:35:20,045
Speaker 0: Yep.

513
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,250
Speaker 0: I'm very pleased with that.

514
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:28,328
Speaker 0: We're gonna be reviewing ko century bees probably next Wednesday, maybe What else is cool in there?

515
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,271
Speaker 1: There were.

516
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:35,589
Speaker 1: basically there was a different, you know, every major comic publisher had some sort of booth or display there.

517
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:39,562
Speaker 1: You know, I stopped off at all the ones that I know and I chatted him up.

518
00:35:39,662 --> 00:35:42,270
Speaker 1: ATV was there selling their Chevalier DVDs.

519
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:48,707
Speaker 1: There are quite a few people selling the same manga that I saw katsu khan at the same prices.

520
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:49,630
Speaker 1: I saw at katsu khan.

521
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:56,984
Speaker 0: Granted the anime industry seems to be slowly recouping from the bad years They've had recently since they were here at least the ones that were here.

522
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,329
Speaker 0: We're here in full force.

523
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:11,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, they basically I mean Viz had like I think right up front like they had a little like a little house and Like they gave they were giving away their canvas bags and their free sneak peek Mangas.

524
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:12,736
Speaker 1: Viz was out like.

525
00:36:12,856 --> 00:36:17,110
Speaker 1: that's the biggest convention setup Viz has and Viz didn't even go to Otacon this year.

526
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,819
Speaker 1: So that was pretty cool to see them there.

527
00:36:19,463 --> 00:36:20,650
Speaker 1: Who else was cool?

528
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:36,500
Speaker 1: the DC booth was basically just like this rotation of comic creators doing signings and whatnot and it was actually kind of funny because it was really small and cramped and You had to like kind of look around to see who was sitting where.

529
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:45,778
Speaker 1: they had like four separate desks of different heights and positions And if you were the last person in line to talk to a creator They would give you the sign to hold.

530
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:47,928
Speaker 1: that said I am the last person in this line.

531
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:51,448
Speaker 1: Haha Wow, I saw some nerd holding the sign and I laughed at him.

532
00:36:52,551 --> 00:37:05,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did see while we were waiting to try to get into the con Stan Lee walked by with his entourage and if he Hadn't been as far away as he was I would have totally run up before the guard shot me and asked him why the hell He bolded all those random words.

533
00:37:06,364 --> 00:37:06,727
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:13,824
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we probably could have run up and like been like, excuse me We can get an entourage of like 30 people or I was in like 30.

535
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:15,390
Speaker 0: It was at least 18 people.

536
00:37:15,772 --> 00:37:16,816
Speaker 0: There were a lot of people.

537
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:17,901
Speaker 1: it was like five feet.

538
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:19,266
Speaker 0: Oh, it was far more than that.

539
00:37:19,286 --> 00:37:20,110
Speaker 1: That's not what I saw.

540
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,014
Speaker 0: That's what I saw.

541
00:37:21,034 --> 00:37:22,662
Speaker 1: I think you're there were.

542
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:30,110
Speaker 0: no there were in all seriousness At least 15 people following him and like this teardrop shaped trail, that's not what I saw anyway.

543
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:37,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, Oh one cool thing about this actually was down the right side of the exhibition hall.

544
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:39,658
Speaker 1: it was actually sort of poorly laid out.

545
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:46,049
Speaker 1: these people all had their backs to the wall and there was like a pillar in the Way and there wasn't a lot of room in front of them.

546
00:37:46,631 --> 00:38:05,770
Speaker 1: But down the right side of the exhibition hall in the last aisle were tiny booths for all like the ridiculously independent small-time publishers like vertical was over there and Like all the people usually see an artist alley at mid-sized conventions and that I saw a lot of cool stuff down that way.

547
00:38:05,931 --> 00:38:08,683
Speaker 1: I just didn't want to buy any of it, but it was pretty cool.

548
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:11,115
Speaker 1: talking to a lot of those people like hey What do you make here?

549
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:12,522
Speaker 1: Whoa, I never heard of that.

550
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:13,749
Speaker 1: Ooh, that looks pretty cool.

551
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:15,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, other than that.

552
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:17,561
Speaker 0: I mean we ran into the guy who does dr.

553
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:19,146
Speaker 0: McGninja who is totally awesome.

554
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:19,467
Speaker 0: Yep.

555
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:19,748
Speaker 1: Dr.

556
00:38:19,788 --> 00:38:21,175
Speaker 1: McGninja guys Awesome.

557
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:23,690
Speaker 0: Scott ran into Jim Vowles the former con chair of Otacon.

558
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:26,790
Speaker 0: I had already given up on the con and was getting my coat at that point.

559
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:32,509
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically, I think the final word in the New York Comic Con is that is a big room.

560
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:36,070
Speaker 1: It's full of some awesome stuff and some not-so-awesome stuff.

561
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:40,623
Speaker 1: If you know comics the artist alley is really awesome.

562
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:42,830
Speaker 1: if you can get around the crowdedness of it.

563
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,427
Speaker 0: Well, if you know comics and you care about the semi-famous people who do them.

564
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,976
Speaker 1: Yep I don't know.

565
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:57,210
Speaker 1: if you want to get autographs and sketches There's pretty much no better place because whoever you want to get them from is almost guaranteed to be there.

566
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,450
Speaker 0: But other than that, I mean don't because there I saw a lot of anime fans.

567
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:14,213
Speaker 0: I walked around just kind of asking people about the con since I really didn't have much to do at it And there were a lot of anime fans or people who like were at katsu kana went to anime cons at this con and without Exception.

568
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:17,423
Speaker 0: they were all very much disappointed and bored and said they'd never come back.

569
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:27,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much Even though this is like the biggest baddest comic-con in the East Coast I mean pretty much only San Diego comic-con beats out this one.

570
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:35,690
Speaker 1: It's not run any differently from any other comic cons except that it's bigger really big too big for its own shoes.

571
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:38,690
Speaker 0: I mean really if you like the stuff they've got you can do all that stuff.

572
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:42,010
Speaker 0: But even beyond that there's really no way to hang out.

573
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,850
Speaker 0: There's no where you can just sit and hang out with other comic fans easily.

574
00:39:45,352 --> 00:39:52,530
Speaker 0: it's just crowded and hard to get around and expensive and difficult to get to and I was thoroughly unimpressed.

575
00:39:53,652 --> 00:40:02,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you like comics I'd say it's worth it to go for one day if you're a comic fan like Friday or Sunday not Saturday It's not.

576
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:08,481
Speaker 1: it's not worth it to go to this thing on Saturday ever unless There's some crazy event that you must go to.

577
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,930
Speaker 1: but none of the events really interested me.

578
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,598
Speaker 1: you can go to the website and look and see what the events were.

579
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:27,098
Speaker 1: all of the cool events like see Stephen Colbert or see Stephen King or Watch the new sci-fi TV episodes before they're on TV.

580
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,170
Speaker 1: you need separate tickets for all that shit and They don't really tell you where to get those separate tickets or how much they cost.

581
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:39,763
Speaker 0: Actually when I was going around asking people about the con They they must have assumed I was press or something.

582
00:40:39,783 --> 00:40:41,170
Speaker 0: cuz you know, I'm asking him stuff.

583
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:46,004
Speaker 0: So they're always at the end like hey So, you know where I can get tickets to whatever and I had no way to tell him.

584
00:40:46,064 --> 00:40:46,586
Speaker 0: I didn't know.

585
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:50,316
Speaker 1: yeah I mean That's one thing that I really like about.

586
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:54,086
Speaker 1: pretty much every anime convention is a badge to the con.

587
00:40:54,507 --> 00:40:55,830
Speaker 1: is a badge to the con.

588
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,175
Speaker 1: You have a badge.

589
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:01,470
Speaker 1: you can do anything as long as your badge is for the right day.

590
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:04,413
Speaker 1: You know if you buy a Friday badge You can do anything.

591
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:08,990
Speaker 1: that happens on Friday at this con and I think a lot of other comic cons.

592
00:41:09,572 --> 00:41:12,843
Speaker 1: Alright a Friday badge gets you in the door on Friday.

593
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:14,990
Speaker 1: Oh you want to do that ten bucks.

594
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:19,728
Speaker 1: Oh you want to do that ten bucks and a lot of the stuff happens at the same time.

595
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:29,148
Speaker 1: or You don't know where to get the tickets or only special people can get the tickets and alright You know while that's not nice and I don't like it I guess it's fair.

596
00:41:29,691 --> 00:41:37,778
Speaker 1: But what I don't think is fair is that when they promote this con to you they say hey come to the New York Comic Con Stephen King will be here.

597
00:41:37,878 --> 00:41:43,061
Speaker 1: or hey come to the New York Comic Con Wes Craven and Stan Lee will be here and you that's.

598
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:43,643
Speaker 1: it's like.

599
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:45,530
Speaker 1: that's a selling point to come to the con.

600
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:48,119
Speaker 1: But coming to the con doesn't actually get you.

601
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:57,490
Speaker 1: that it's like if I said hey buy this game It has this awesome car in this racing game, but then you buy the get racing game and the car isn't in there.

602
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,950
Speaker 1: Oh you actually have to buy this other thing to have that car.

603
00:42:00,493 --> 00:42:04,481
Speaker 1: You know it's sort of like a disingenuous sell when they do that And I don't like it.

604
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:11,506
Speaker 0: plus It's just more that the greater problem with cons like this is that Con you no matter how great a con is the content will only take you.

605
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:12,853
Speaker 0: so far You're not.

606
00:42:13,094 --> 00:42:19,600
Speaker 0: not many people who go to these geek cons really seem to want to go to Nothing, but panels and events.

607
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:21,990
Speaker 0: they want to spend some time hanging out with other geeks.

608
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,517
Speaker 0: But you really can't do anything like this.

609
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was then again at a comic-con.

610
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:33,002
Speaker 0: I mean you all remember when I covered Philly Wizard World last year It was very difficult to strike up a conversation with anyone.

611
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:36,738
Speaker 0: people tended to shy away if I said hello That was without a microphone.

612
00:42:36,758 --> 00:42:39,370
Speaker 0: I might add not II I didn't even have any of my stuff out.

613
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,582
Speaker 0: I was just some guy saying hi trying to talk about spider-man.

614
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:43,084
Speaker 1: Yep.

615
00:42:43,164 --> 00:43:01,650
Speaker 1: I mean the primary reason I Decided to go as opposed to not go is because there were a lot of people at this convention that I knew Either from the Internet's or from real life or from whatever that I wanted to go and say hi to Hell, there were people there that I knew that I need even know we're gonna be there like the ninja consultants were there.

616
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:06,030
Speaker 1: I'd even run into them, but they were there and I didn't know until afterwards and they did a show on it.

617
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:12,841
Speaker 1: You know if I had saw if I had seen them there I would have stopped to chat and say hi You know and that's I think that's the number one thing that he were.

618
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,085
Speaker 1: comic-con is going for.

619
00:43:14,105 --> 00:43:15,630
Speaker 1: is that a bunch of people?

620
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,428
Speaker 1: I know were there.

621
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:29,550
Speaker 1: But even when I ran into people I knew and started to talk to them like Jim Vowles or whatever we had to stand in the aisle and talk blocking the way and We couldn't talk for that long because you know, it wasn't really like a hangout.

622
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:35,690
Speaker 1: It was just stopping and saying hi in the middle of a hallway in a busy busy convention room.

623
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:41,350
Speaker 1: It's not like in an anime con where there's even an anime con if all you do is events and stuff.

624
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:55,970
Speaker 1: there are lots and lots of events where you can go to the event and talk to people and And this like it's sort of like a social event or play events where you can, you know Even at a panel at an anime con there's a lot more interaction with the panelists themselves.

625
00:43:56,131 --> 00:44:04,670
Speaker 1: It's it's less of a top-down sort of thing when you go to a panel at a comic-con It's super famous guy up on the day as you sit there and be quiet and listen to what they say.

626
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,081
Speaker 1: Maybe you can ask a question at the end.

627
00:44:07,181 --> 00:44:07,503
Speaker 1: That's it.

628
00:44:08,005 --> 00:44:11,810
Speaker 0: It's it's I don't know I just I really can't jive with cons like this.

629
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:12,915
Speaker 0: I'm a social creature.

630
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:20,110
Speaker 0: if I go to a con is mostly because I want to meet and hang out with people and Even if I wanted to do events there was really no event at this con.

631
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:27,898
Speaker 0: Maybe just cuz I'm not much of a comic fan that interested me at all and I must say Part of the reason I went was that way back.

632
00:44:27,979 --> 00:44:29,705
Speaker 0: I used to complain like yeah comic cons.

633
00:44:29,806 --> 00:44:30,850
Speaker 0: I definitely don't like them.

634
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:37,536
Speaker 0: They're kind of a they're not my bag and a lot of people out there are listeners and Scott said hey You can't knock it till you tried it.

635
00:44:37,878 --> 00:44:40,630
Speaker 0: Well, I went to Philly Wizard World and I went to the New York Comic Con.

636
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:45,690
Speaker 0: I hated both of them and regretted going to them and I probably will never go to a comic-con again.

637
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:57,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I go back to the New York Comic Con It'll it'll have to be because like I don't know in order to get me to go back There would have to be some like awesome shit going down for me to buy the one day.

638
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,994
Speaker 0: It would have to go beyond.

639
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,504
Speaker 0: I mean we could get a table in the podcaster alley.

640
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:02,970
Speaker 0: That wouldn't be difficult to do at all.

641
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:06,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I got it if we had a title in the podcast alley I might sit.

642
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:16,447
Speaker 0: see you know, what I'm saying is even if we were given one totally free unsolicited I still wouldn't go really because that means I have to for three days in a row.

643
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:28,905
Speaker 0: Friday Saturday Sunday Take the train down to the city Walk my ass over to the Javits and sit there in a loud room not playing music not DJing not doing fun stuff just sitting there talking to people.

644
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:30,010
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.

645
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,965
Speaker 1: I might go if he had a podcast alley table, but that's all you.

646
00:45:33,025 --> 00:45:33,588
Speaker 0: you can run it.

647
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:36,519
Speaker 0: Other than that you're gonna take the train every day.

648
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

649
00:45:38,164 --> 00:45:40,555
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about it's not just a train It's a tough car.

650
00:45:40,595 --> 00:45:53,750
Speaker 1: It's the train and then walking over to is I can get the table right and I could go on Friday and If I'm not having a good time hanging out with people in the podcast arena on Friday, I could just stop coming.

651
00:45:53,871 --> 00:45:54,959
Speaker 1: I just won't show up Saturday.

652
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:56,490
Speaker 0: You can't really do that.

653
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:56,972
Speaker 1: Why not?

654
00:45:57,314 --> 00:45:58,680
Speaker 0: if you're gave I mean a kind like that.

655
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:04,281
Speaker 0: if you've got one of those precious table spots It's really not cool to just not be there.

656
00:46:04,401 --> 00:46:05,525
Speaker 1: I can give it to someone else.

657
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:06,990
Speaker 0: Oh, how are you gonna give it to some?

658
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:08,314
Speaker 1: Artists I know or something.

659
00:46:08,735 --> 00:46:12,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now there's an artist sitting next to me who already has a table.

660
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:16,660
Speaker 1: Yeah Oh even so that it it's I cannot.

661
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,586
Speaker 0: yeah, I cannot think of a situation.

662
00:46:18,646 --> 00:46:19,870
Speaker 0: Well, then again, it's not just that.

663
00:46:19,991 --> 00:46:27,330
Speaker 0: I can't think of a situation where I would ever go To a fan convention in the Javits Center in New York City ever again, let alone a comic convention.

664
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:32,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they're gonna have that anime festival in the Javits Center like what later this year.

665
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:34,819
Speaker 0: next year I predict that's not going to go.

666
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,670
Speaker 1: Well, I also predict it's not gonna go.

667
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:41,189
Speaker 1: Well, but I somehow feel like I have to go to it to see what's gonna go.

668
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:41,649
Speaker 1: You know what?

669
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:48,279
Speaker 0: You said that last year about the New York Comic Con and I wisely stayed home and did whatever I did and I'm a better Man for it.

670
00:46:48,765 --> 00:47:00,920
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess now that I'm gonna be working in the city again It'll be I guess less painful because I won't have to pay for the ticket because I've already paid to go to the city Every day of the month, so it's all you.

671
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:03,570
Speaker 0: I can't think of anything that would drag me back to a comic-con.

672
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:11,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a tough call because you're basically paying for anyone who buys a weekend pass.

673
00:47:11,396 --> 00:47:24,650
Speaker 1: you better be one hell of a comic fan who's gonna go around to every artist and spend time looking at everything in every booth and go to all the autograph sessions and Figure out how to get the secret tickets to the secret special event.

674
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,350
Speaker 0: Yes, you'd better know the names all the people who draw your comics.

675
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:28,013
Speaker 0: You're not gonna.

676
00:47:28,214 --> 00:47:31,831
Speaker 1: if you're not someone who like is fans of comic creators Like.

677
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:37,610
Speaker 1: if you're not that nerdy there is really nothing at this con for you because you're basically gonna.

678
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:38,373
Speaker 1: He.

679
00:47:38,574 --> 00:47:47,776
Speaker 1: there's gonna be a bunch of people who are somewhat famous, but you don't know their names You don't know who they are and that's like 90% of the cons Entertainment value right there.

680
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:53,539
Speaker 0: So once again more important than all that Tell me about the worst anime you've ever seen.

681
00:47:53,961 --> 00:47:59,669
Speaker 0: whoever tells me about it the best gets the original soundtrack to the hit anime video.
