3
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:30,585
Speaker 1: this is a joke about a socks proxy actually An obvious joke.

4
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:36,671
Speaker 1: I was I was also thinking it but I feel like the average listener Is too young to have ever encountered that.

5
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:38,739
Speaker 0: I was also thinking it like war.

6
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,334
Speaker 1: yeah, but we're the same age and we come from the same.

7
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:44,090
Speaker 1: like generation of computer.

8
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:49,954
Speaker 1: like Sox isn't really used anymore except in like archaic enterprise nonsense.

9
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:50,917
Speaker 0: Just saying that.

10
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:51,980
Speaker 0: I was also thinking this.

11
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:03,741
Speaker 1: Yep In fact, one of my first jobs was maintaining a socks proxy that ran on os2 warp To connect this SNA network with the internal Ethernet network in a print in an IBM Mm-hmm.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,259
Speaker 1: That was a Shall we say ancient times?

13
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,192
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, it's a Thursday geek nights.

14
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:11,855
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

15
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:12,780
Speaker 1: we can talk about anything.

16
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,584
Speaker 1: It's not the lounge.

17
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:15,729
Speaker 1: You can't talk about anything.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,135
Speaker 0: No, that's it going home.

19
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:21,669
Speaker 1: Yeah But uh, yeah packs is coming up real soon.

20
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,220
Speaker 0: we're doing kind of a weird skip into the minute moment right now.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,763
Speaker 0: I'm saying we're.

22
00:01:24,803 --> 00:01:30,549
Speaker 1: it means we're doing sort of like a weird abbreviated schedule and I'm sort of Preoccupied with the fact that packs has come in.

23
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:32,556
Speaker 1: I'm pretty hyped for it like more.

24
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:33,540
Speaker 0: so I knew furniture.

25
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:36,139
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you just then.

26
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:39,112
Speaker 1: It's interesting to be in the position.

27
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:40,380
Speaker 0: We're having rid of a bunch of crap.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,467
Speaker 0: My apartment is taking up too much room that would need.

29
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,551
Speaker 0: the furniture needs to go.

30
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:47,163
Speaker 1: We're old enough to where you Telling us.

31
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:50,820
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm buying furniture and like the details are like who are you getting a chase?

32
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,960
Speaker 1: Like what are you gonna put what kind of furniture you get?

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,111
Speaker 1: And that was a real exciting conversation for us when I moved into the apartment.

34
00:01:57,452 --> 00:02:05,018
Speaker 0: I just got IKEA furniture as fast as possible And that was the cheapest and the most convenient without planning or designing or anything.

35
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:07,489
Speaker 0: and now it's like, okay The couch is broken.

36
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,160
Speaker 0: I need new furniture.

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,995
Speaker 0: Now I can actually think about this and get the best furniture.

38
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,380
Speaker 1: furniture ain't cheap?

39
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:19,680
Speaker 0: No, not good furniture unless you want the worst furniture or you know.

40
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,794
Speaker 0: I mean IKEA is slightly less cheap, you know, it's still way cheap compared to real furniture.

41
00:02:24,814 --> 00:02:27,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't last that long.

42
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:32,159
Speaker 1: And the problem is it's very easy to find furniture that I like.

43
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,009
Speaker 1: That looks good.

44
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,095
Speaker 1: That would be 100% perfect.

45
00:02:37,061 --> 00:02:41,553
Speaker 1: Usually the things that are perfect are it's not even like oh, it's a few thousand dollars.

46
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:44,301
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, that's eight thousand dollars fucker Yep.

47
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:49,906
Speaker 0: Well also, you know the other problem is like if I had a big old empty house It'd be really easy to get furniture.

48
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,340
Speaker 0: But when you have a tiny ass apartment suddenly, everything is difficult.

49
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:57,620
Speaker 1: Yep, like giant like when I was a kid, we had a giant living room and a giant family room.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,395
Speaker 0: So they go to the furniture store and you see this big layout.

51
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:03,360
Speaker 0: You're like, oh, this is perfect And it's like take that whole place to be late.

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,336
Speaker 0: This would be terrific if I had an enormous room that was bigger than my apartment.

53
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,400
Speaker 0: five times five.

54
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:18,492
Speaker 1: Yeah the Midwestern like Large house you have the giant lazy boys somewhere and then he got like the big sectional couch That takes up like it would fill this entire room.

55
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,780
Speaker 0: I don't think you could fit it in this room.

56
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:23,457
Speaker 1: You could probably cut it up and fit all the pieces in this room.

57
00:03:23,678 --> 00:03:25,189
Speaker 0: sure It would be just a big.

58
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,560
Speaker 0: the room would just be one big cushion.

59
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,848
Speaker 1: So maybe that's my strategy just cushion the floors.

60
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,774
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got any news?

61
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,560
Speaker 0: I do have a news.

62
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,868
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if this is really news.

63
00:03:34,888 --> 00:03:36,880
Speaker 0: It was almost thing of the day, but whatever.

64
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:43,320
Speaker 0: So they someone wrote and investigated and got this article about the history of nesticle.

65
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:46,275
Speaker 0: And if you don't know back in the day like late 90s, right?

66
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,007
Speaker 0: I'll never get over that icon.

67
00:03:49,167 --> 00:04:08,325
Speaker 0: when I first discovered what an emulator was and realized I could play Console games on my computer and download them for free and not have to pay money and get cartridges And just use my gravis gamepad and not you know, the real controllers Which you can now use the real controllers things to USB which didn't really exist too much then eggs only uses it then a little bit.

68
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:13,608
Speaker 0: but yeah Someone went and researched the history of nesticle.

69
00:04:13,648 --> 00:04:19,117
Speaker 0: who made it where it came from when they made it how they made it all the Drama that happened in the scene around it.

70
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,619
Speaker 0: You know where the why there was a pair of testicles as the icon.

71
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,629
Speaker 0: All this grand nesticle was.

72
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:39,329
Speaker 1: it's interesting because not only was it like the first Widespread use emulator that like nerds would find and use who weren't like deep into the scene It was really like fully featured.

73
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:49,277
Speaker 0: No, it was in this emulator basically invented all those features They talk about like what happened is nesticle what you know, what happened to the guy I ended up using SNES 9x for SNES?

74
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,679
Speaker 0: You read this article you'll know I just saw.

75
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:57,117
Speaker 0: You'll find out why you ended up using SNES 9x.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,208
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, and yes and ZSNES that came later.

77
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:05,923
Speaker 0: And yeah, I didn't realize that Genesis was made by the same guy who made nesticle Stuff like that.

78
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:10,380
Speaker 0: So this is like it's like weird to read an article about history that I lived.

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:19,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, right like it'd be like if there was an article that described the inner workings of the magic the gathering scene during the revised era.

80
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:22,560
Speaker 0: It's yeah, it's like what this is.

81
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:30,205
Speaker 0: So yeah If you know if you're just somebody takes emulators for granted or someone who also lived through this And doesn't you know?

82
00:05:30,225 --> 00:05:35,528
Speaker 0: because I lived through this but I didn't know all these details about what was going on Wasn't in the scene.

83
00:05:35,609 --> 00:05:37,640
Speaker 0: I was just some kid who was downloading rums.

84
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:48,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, a friend of mine on a BBS was like yo You can play any yes games on a computer and I was like you're lying Mm-hmm, and then they were like no no no check this out.

85
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:51,689
Speaker 1: And then I installed nesticle and it was it.

86
00:05:51,970 --> 00:06:03,500
Speaker 1: it was like that moment when I first heard an mp3 And I realized what that meant for the future the first time I started Mario 1 in an emulator.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,220
Speaker 1: I just paused it and sat there thinking wow, this changes everything.

88
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,628
Speaker 1: and Most of the NES games I played on the emulator were games I already owned cartridges for.

89
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:19,765
Speaker 1: it was just way more convenient to play on the computer Also saves eights men.

90
00:06:19,886 --> 00:06:27,734
Speaker 1: I beat a lot of games that I never bet beat on a real console Like Wizards and Warriors games Wizards warriors fucking three.

91
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:31,393
Speaker 0: There was no way I was gonna beat that game I like with no warriors to all the elemental bosses.

92
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:33,124
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah - it's pretty good I like -.

93
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:34,657
Speaker 0: I had a strategy guide for that.

94
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:42,236
Speaker 0: I was one of those times where you're a kid you buy a strategy guide and all the strategies for games You don't have yep, which just made me want to buy those games.

95
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:43,119
Speaker 0: It was in there.

96
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:53,464
Speaker 1: but actually I was thinking I was watching the world records for Wizards warriors 1 and I remember I played that again recently on an emulator and Hard as balls.

97
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's also pretty fun.

98
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,403
Speaker 1: Like I feel like I could beat Wizards and Warriors 1.

99
00:06:58,403 --> 00:07:00,329
Speaker 0: I like the aesthetic of it Wizards and Warriors.

100
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,740
Speaker 0: Well the spiders and the treasure chests and the candidates and the wizards.

101
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:11,760
Speaker 1: Yeah I'd like I'd like to see a remake of that kind of game Sure, like Shovel Knight style like take it and make it a little bit more accessible and less bullshit.

102
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:23,486
Speaker 1: But no I mean I have not read this article and I'm going to read it because I'm really curious about all these details that were Completely opaque to me as a child.

103
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:28,824
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the main takeaway from this right is like, you know There's all this scene drama.

104
00:07:28,845 --> 00:07:31,935
Speaker 0: and we you know, even today this every scene has drama.

105
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:41,020
Speaker 1: right now, you know any fandom whatever Going crazy right now about some like YouTube shouty man that I'd no idea right kind of in that scene.

106
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,780
Speaker 0: But in the long run, it's the all that scene drama doesn't matter and goes away.

107
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,419
Speaker 0: No one cares everyone just laughs about it if they even remember it.

108
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,726
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it turns into like.

109
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:54,351
Speaker 0: and this is you know, you can see the things that last you know That really matter is goddamn.

110
00:07:54,372 --> 00:08:06,179
Speaker 1: we can all play any of this game yep, and but I guess like which emulator became the one of choice is probably driven by drama that No longer is remembered only the result remains.

111
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:11,619
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this is actually Really relevant to the fact that we're going to PAX.

112
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,853
Speaker 1: So, you know, you can crack your knuckles make some noise.

113
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:17,587
Speaker 1: Some people can some people can yep Some people can some people can.

114
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,459
Speaker 1: did you know that to this day?

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,050
Speaker 1: No one Actually knows what makes that sounds.

116
00:08:24,412 --> 00:08:24,874
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

117
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,160
Speaker 0: It's like your knuckles, right?

118
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:32,539
Speaker 1: Okay, explain it to me what when I crack my knuckle what causes that sound specific?

119
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
Speaker 0: Well, I've seen this article so I know the real answer.

120
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,828
Speaker 0: But this is the answer that a common person would say.

121
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,854
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna pretend to be naive, right?

122
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:41,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you got bones.

123
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got muscles holding the bones together.

124
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,636
Speaker 1: Well, you got tendons holding the bones.

125
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:47,740
Speaker 0: It's all the same shit.

126
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:48,885
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

127
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,820
Speaker 0: you got flesh holding bones together, yeah, there's human.

128
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,294
Speaker 1: Otherwise the bones would just sort of fall apart like like the other half of stone to flesh the spell Which is really gross.

129
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:05,860
Speaker 0: if you cast Kellan's that you see in the classroom are held together with screws because without the flesh the bones don't stay together.

130
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:10,020
Speaker 0: Yep, and then the flesh moves and the bones are in there, right?

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:18,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, and when you don't move them for a while, you know the muscles sorta, you know Or whatever and the bones get close they're moving around.

132
00:09:18,835 --> 00:09:23,019
Speaker 0: so sometimes, you know You'll loosen them up and when you move the muscle the fleshy bits.

133
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:26,454
Speaker 0: Sometimes the bones scrape against each other and go click click.

134
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:32,120
Speaker 0: No, no the reality is That is incorrect, but isn't that a common sense?

135
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,954
Speaker 1: It is a common sentiment and the thing I can say is that it's a common sense answer.

136
00:09:36,135 --> 00:09:41,194
Speaker 1: you would but the other common sense Answer is you would fucking know if your bone was scraping against your bone.

137
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know really.

138
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:45,851
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a lot of the problems that runners and people get.

139
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:48,100
Speaker 0: isn't that every joint bones are touching bones?

140
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:49,809
Speaker 1: No, actually the like.

141
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,920
Speaker 0: your shoulder is in a socket and it moves.

142
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,225
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a total in all the.

143
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,660
Speaker 1: there's a joint and tendons and pads and buffers in there.

144
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:59,619
Speaker 1: We have actual bone is scraping against actual bone.

145
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:07,767
Speaker 0: You're in for you're in you're in trouble so that you're telling me that not no zero bones in my body makes No contact whatsoever with any other bone.

146
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:10,334
Speaker 0: There's always just something in between every bone.

147
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,540
Speaker 1: There are definitely exceptions to that.

148
00:10:12,801 --> 00:10:16,636
Speaker 1: Okay, but generally like the bones you're thinking about there's tendons.

149
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:21,706
Speaker 0: There's cartilage I mean like my my in my shoulder socket moving around.

150
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's like cartilage around it.

151
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:24,390
Speaker 1: Okay stuff there.

152
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:31,700
Speaker 1: The next most common theory is you get bubbles in your joint and if yep, that's partially true.

153
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:35,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you a lot of you some people get always there's fluids and shit.

154
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:43,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's fluids and there's bubbles But the bubbles popping is not what causes the sound and apparently this article is fascinating.

155
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:50,720
Speaker 1: the reason why it's so hard to answer this question is The same reason why it's actually hard to answer a lot of questions about the human body.

156
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,987
Speaker 1: There's no way to just video it happening.

157
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:58,058
Speaker 1: Like you can't just make a video x-ray and high enough speed.

158
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,562
Speaker 0: You'll see bones That's it.

159
00:10:59,783 --> 00:11:04,380
Speaker 1: You'll see bones and a lot like you and you might say oh, but I can see like the inside of a cell.

160
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:11,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like dead died Stabilized cell that was held under a special microscope for a long time.

161
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:21,166
Speaker 1: Yeah live video, especially high-speed live video of fast events inside of things that you did not kill are Almost impossible to get.

162
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:29,659
Speaker 1: and is it even gonna work if you're alive or like, you know, yep So I mean there's a reason if you get an MRI, you're basically strapped in and can't move at all.

163
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:55,796
Speaker 1: So this article talks about how the way they figured this out recently like really recently was by making mathematical models of what those bubbles would look like and then simulating them and then comparing the sound that the simulated bubbles would make when they're interacting with the rest of these joints and bones to Actual recordings of knuckles cracking and looking for matches and all this fancy stuff.

164
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:56,880
Speaker 1: the article goes into detail.

165
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:59,291
Speaker 0: It sounds like bones hitting against each other, right?

166
00:11:59,311 --> 00:12:01,822
Speaker 1: Yep, so it ain't even bubbles popping Mm-hmm.

167
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:12,180
Speaker 1: It seems like at least from this data, which is these data, which is pretty new which are pretty new is That it is the cavitation of those bubbles.

168
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,239
Speaker 1: So the bubbles compress and they expand again and that makes the sound they don't pop.

169
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,518
Speaker 0: Oh am I less cracky because I have less gas?

170
00:12:22,644 --> 00:12:24,111
Speaker 1: So they don't know any of those other answers.

171
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,237
Speaker 1: Okay, they don't.

172
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:28,970
Speaker 0: they still don't know Why some people can crack like crazy and other people can't.

173
00:12:29,452 --> 00:12:30,776
Speaker 1: seems like they don't know that either.

174
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:33,920
Speaker 0: wouldn't it just be because I'm less Gassy, ah, it's hard to say.

175
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,940
Speaker 1: It's also not clear if those gas bubbles have like if they're important or not.

176
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:40,533
Speaker 0: Are they have any connection to arthritis or other joint?

177
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,578
Speaker 1: that seems to still be.

178
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,714
Speaker 1: no There's see there doesn't seem to be.

179
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:49,240
Speaker 1: now again This is just based on my like not scientists and I try problems that people have.

180
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:54,140
Speaker 1: It seems like there is no real correlation between knuckle cracking and any negative outcomes.

181
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:58,958
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna keep cracking my knuckles cuz it feels great and I like the sound.

182
00:12:59,299 --> 00:13:02,694
Speaker 0: yeah They can't do it, you know based on the feeling we can't figure anything out.

183
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:03,518
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

184
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:07,300
Speaker 0: No, does it feel like gas bubbles are popping when you feel the crack?

185
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,775
Speaker 1: I don't know what it feels like if a gas bubble pops inside of me.

186
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:11,659
Speaker 0: Maybe you do.

187
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:18,977
Speaker 1: I know what it feels like when I'm full of gas in certain specific areas But it doesn't make it sound like that.

188
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:19,862
Speaker 0: no Doesn't.

189
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:28,379
Speaker 1: if they if that area of gas made a sound like that I would be waiting for the ambulance If I wasn't already dead.

190
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,387
Speaker 1: But this is just sort of a fascinating greed.

191
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:40,754
Speaker 1: things that appear to have simple answers or common-sense answers Very often have a complex and ambiguous answer.

192
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:44,246
Speaker 1: That is way Different from what you think.

193
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,610
Speaker 0: Oh, but my Occam's razor.

194
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:45,851
Speaker 0: Why?

195
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,838
Speaker 1: Yeah Occam's razor doesn't always work.

196
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:56,571
Speaker 1: son I cut you with the reason this is relevant and I'll say it because a lot of you might not go to Pax's and you Might not have listened to old episodes of geek knives.

197
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:57,780
Speaker 1: There's a tradition.

198
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,788
Speaker 1: It doesn't happen at every packs anymore not safe.

199
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:02,800
Speaker 1: The envelope was invented every now and then someone puts it in the envelope.

200
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,680
Speaker 1: I feel like I should ask the question in the envelope for a future packs.

201
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,655
Speaker 1: But occasionally at Pax's in the main theater at the opening ceremonies the

202
00:14:10,795 --> 00:14:11,276
Speaker 0: Q&A

203
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:23,500
Speaker 1: will do a thing where Everyone in the audience so like thousands of people Crack their knuckles at the same time and you might think that it couldn't possibly be that loud you crack your own knuckles.

204
00:14:23,581 --> 00:14:25,679
Speaker 0: It's not that everyone's quiet and trying to listen.

205
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:32,543
Speaker 1: Yeah but like even if you're and it's indoors if you're in a giant quiet room and like you crack a knuckle like in a football stadium Like how loud could it be?

206
00:14:33,226 --> 00:14:41,923
Speaker 1: But when a thousand people all crack their knuckles at the same time It is one of the worst sounds Imaginable.

207
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:42,003
Speaker 1: Mmm.

208
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:43,272
Speaker 0: It's not that bad.

209
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:52,000
Speaker 0: It sounds like Someone being destroyed by horrible magic like what it sounds like a whole bunch of people clapping once.

210
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:55,642
Speaker 1: Nah, it sounds more like squeaky than that I imagine.

211
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:56,144
Speaker 1: it said.

212
00:14:56,224 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 1: it sounds like what I imagined the sound was when a certain character in the fifth season was killed by.

213
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,767
Speaker 0: Sounds like a whole bunch of people holding little twigs and then sort of everyone breaks their twig.

214
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:12,321
Speaker 1: No, but it only if the twigs were like Meaty and wet like it has this wet character to it.

215
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:14,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, it recordings of it.

216
00:15:14,407 --> 00:15:18,063
Speaker 1: Don't really do it justice You just have to be in the room physically to see what I mean.

217
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:19,692
Speaker 1: It's a good time It.

218
00:15:19,914 --> 00:15:21,022
Speaker 1: it always goes the same way.

219
00:15:21,244 --> 00:15:25,386
Speaker 1: they count down Everyone cracks their knuckles and then most of the crowd goes.

220
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,919
Speaker 1: Ah Then we all shiver and then we move on.

221
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,069
Speaker 0: I don't I just are like, alright, I don't know.

222
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,035
Speaker 1: good Do you like that sound?

223
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,161
Speaker 0: it doesn't bother me.

224
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,830
Speaker 1: We should make an album about that sound.

225
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,724
Speaker 1: Okay, so one last little bit of news before we get into the very important main bit.

226
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:45,539
Speaker 1: Scott found this article like 14 minutes ago and I didn't read it.

227
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,643
Speaker 0: I didn't read it either.

228
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:47,306
Speaker 0: Okay.

229
00:15:47,346 --> 00:16:06,343
Speaker 1: Well, there you go but the article is essentially about The idea of active travel and how pretty much Americans in particular But just people in general who live in modern industrialized societies tend not to travel via their own Capable, like they don't bike or walk anywhere.

230
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:19,469
Speaker 1: They drive everywhere Mm-hmm, and the article talks basically from what I skimmed about how the average person Vastly overestimates the time and effort actually required to travel in that manner.

231
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I mean if you don't use if you'd never use a car, right?

232
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, then you're gonna be pretty bad at estimating how long it takes to get somewhere with a car.

233
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:36,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you never use a plane You're not gonna be good as so people who don't walk and don't bike Don't know how long it takes to get places with cars and bikes.

234
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:45,830
Speaker 1: So they literally don't realize with feet and by things like it only takes 15 minutes to walk to that like bodega That's down the street from your neighborhood.

235
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:55,929
Speaker 1: And it's just sort of interesting because we live in New York Which is almost the opposite problem because you're pretty much everyone walks because there's no other way to get to places.

236
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:57,984
Speaker 0: So people who can't walk

237
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:15,406
Speaker 1: yeah Well, yeah, but obviously but I feel like among all the people we know here The real problem is that most people vastly Underestimate how long it takes to walk or take a subway to get somewhere like oh I'll be there in a half hour when it'll guaranteedly take them at least 45 minutes to walk there.

238
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:15,788
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

239
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:22,087
Speaker 1: So, I don't know people need to walk and bike more and we really need to ban cars is the only thing I got to Say about this.

240
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,891
Speaker 0: That was good.

241
00:17:29,699 --> 00:17:32,099
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

242
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:46,918
Speaker 1: So, uh, I found this YouTube video that was fascinating and it was just this long video showing a machine that Semi automatically knits socks from the main bit.

243
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:53,420
Speaker 1: So I decided to make this my thing of the day before we decided to do the show on socks.

244
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,013
Speaker 1: The fact that this is about socks is literally 100% a coincidence.

245
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:57,836
Speaker 1: There is a connection.

246
00:17:59,202 --> 00:18:00,370
Speaker 0: It is only in rims brain.

247
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,034
Speaker 0: this connection.

248
00:18:01,074 --> 00:18:02,040
Speaker 0: He's denying it exists.

249
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,189
Speaker 1: You know how we decide how to do a Thursday show.

250
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:06,980
Speaker 1: the uh, so Scott and I will be on G chat.

251
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:15,891
Speaker 1: We're at work on Thursday Usually like Thursday afternoon and one of us will measure the other one show tonight on question mark And then we won't say anything for a while.

252
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:26,473
Speaker 1: What I tend to do is literally look around wherever I happen to be and If anything I can see gives me an idea for a show.

253
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,562
Speaker 1: Those are the things I suggest Like.

254
00:18:29,864 --> 00:18:32,979
Speaker 0: I'll look around and I'll be like see you looked around at this YouTube video.

255
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:44,414
Speaker 1: No I looked around and I happen to be wearing green smartwool socks despite the fact that I was wearing black dress shoes because I was out of my Shitty black socks and I actually I wanted to wear my comfortable socks.

256
00:18:44,796 --> 00:18:49,156
Speaker 1: So I wore socks I wouldn't normally wear so I was thinking about my socks all day.

257
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:49,678
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

258
00:18:50,302 --> 00:18:52,740
Speaker 1: And then we're like, oh, let's do a show on socks and it totally worked.

259
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:54,750
Speaker 1: Never talked about socks before somehow.

260
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:59,828
Speaker 1: But anyway, that video is fascinating But it doesn't explain anything.

261
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:06,286
Speaker 1: So I have this other video that's my thing of the day and it is someone Explaining how these machines work.

262
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:11,600
Speaker 1: These machines are things that were used like a hundred years ago as an early form of mass production.

263
00:19:12,262 --> 00:19:18,917
Speaker 1: they were there way way faster than hand knitting and way way slower than the modern machines that make these things.

264
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:32,604
Speaker 1: but it is really fascinating to see in detail how this kind of Purely mechanical machine run driven and run by humans manipulating physical bits Like.

265
00:19:32,664 --> 00:19:41,676
Speaker 1: the complexity of what it's accomplishing is pretty pretty amazing Mm-hmm, and this video is like seven minutes long and you'll know everything about how this machine works by the end of it.

266
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:42,538
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

267
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:44,125
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

268
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:45,673
Speaker 0: Oh, what do you have?

269
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:46,880
Speaker 1: anything sock related, you know?

270
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,979
Speaker 0: So there was a news today that they're gonna sell a Kirby Automaton which is something just makes sense if you don't know what automaton is.

271
00:19:54,841 --> 00:20:00,420
Speaker 0: It's a cheapo musical instrument of the digital variety and at the bottom is a ball with a slit in it.

272
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:11,125
Speaker 0: The only reason the slit is there is because when you squeeze the ball at the bottom you don't you know It's it's cute that it has the mouth open up and also as the sound comes out of and you can sort of you know More sound will come out of this.

273
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:20,239
Speaker 0: like it's like you cut a tennis ball and you can make a little face and make it Talk, it's like that right except and then coming out The back is a stick and it looks like a musical note.

274
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:28,616
Speaker 0: Right because you got a stick with a ball and a little flag at the top and then you can move your finger up and down The stick, you know, there's a little touch sensitive strip to make the.

275
00:20:28,757 --> 00:20:29,400
Speaker 0: you know, the sound go.

276
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:34,764
Speaker 0: We sort of like a slide whistle, but you know, whatever And there's no like.

277
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,532
Speaker 0: as far as I know there's no frets on it.

278
00:20:36,592 --> 00:20:36,813
Speaker 0: So it's.

279
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,520
Speaker 1: no it's a hundred percent portamento.

280
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,088
Speaker 0: So it's like a violin where you got it.

281
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:40,611
Speaker 0: You gotta know.

282
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:42,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to feel it out.

283
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:49,828
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's portamento in the sense that if you if you naively play it Notes will just slide into each other.

284
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:54,100
Speaker 1: you could you might say they drift into each other as opposed to.

285
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they're coming up with a kirby themed on which is obvious.

286
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,900
Speaker 0: It'll be pink and have Kirby's face at the bottom and someone's gonna play.

287
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:08,939
Speaker 0: As soon as they get one, they're gonna play that song, right drop it like it's hot, but no one has that.

288
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,492
Speaker 0: yet It's I don't think anyone.

289
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:16,740
Speaker 0: I think you just announced Uh, but because of this, everyone posted all sorts of automatoned videos today.

290
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,522
Speaker 1: Now this ain't new.

291
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:21,458
Speaker 1: I feel like seven months ago there was like a big automatoned like wave.

292
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:26,558
Speaker 0: Probably, but the point is that wave has made a second wave.

293
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,699
Speaker 0: Look, you know, the roller coaster, the big hill, and then the second second hill that's still big.

294
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,864
Speaker 0: That's the second big hill.

295
00:21:32,904 --> 00:21:38,180
Speaker 0: So, uh, here is a video of the best automatoned video that I could find.

296
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:44,260
Speaker 1: This is better than what was hitherto my favorite automatoned video, which was Ave Maria.

297
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:45,216
Speaker 0: Okay.

298
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,684
Speaker 1: This is pretty good.

299
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 1: I debate, I'm still debating whether or not I should get one because in terms of musical complexity- On the one hand, it is a annoying noise-making device, which is a thing that RIM wants.

300
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,699
Speaker 1: Yo, say, say hello to my harmonicas.

301
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,371
Speaker 0: On the other hand, we must not allow for the sake of all of our sanity and preventing the end of the world and making, you know, God's too angry.

302
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,600
Speaker 0: We must prevent RIM from having any more-.

303
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:18,620
Speaker 1: Just warning you, what I think is going to happen is I might bring one of these to say MagFest, and I feel like- That's an appropriate place to have one.

304
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 1: I feel like a lot of other nerds are going to bring the Kirby one specifically to the next MagFest.

305
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:34,080
Speaker 1: Are you going to go to a jam space with your automaton and- I feel like there's going to be an automaton specific jam space event at the next MagFest.

306
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,392
Speaker 1: This is a prediction.

307
00:22:35,412 --> 00:22:36,260
Speaker 1: I feel like this is going to happen.

308
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,419
Speaker 0: I should make a double automaton.

309
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,182
Speaker 0: Ooh.

310
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,559
Speaker 0: There's still one face at the bottom, but there's daddy two sticks.

311
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,171
Speaker 0: The barrier to entry.

312
00:22:44,271 --> 00:22:49,679
Speaker 1: on playing an automaton, it's like a theremin, but way easier coupled with a kazoo.

313
00:22:50,461 --> 00:22:52,352
Speaker 0: Also way cheaper.

314
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,439
Speaker 0: You can just get one of these.

315
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,020
Speaker 1: Yup.

316
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:58,700
Speaker 1: Like it costs less to buy one of these than to buy an okay harmonica.

317
00:22:59,521 --> 00:22:59,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:02,840
Speaker 0: And you know, musical instruments that are real are actually kind of expensive.

319
00:23:03,021 --> 00:23:03,322
Speaker 1: Yup.

320
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:10,259
Speaker 1: Now I feel like maybe I'll just start playing my harmonic again because that is sufficiently annoying and I already- It's sufficiently annoying.

321
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,319
Speaker 0: He admits his goal is to produce annoying sounds.

322
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:26,040
Speaker 1: Well, because playing my trumpet is too much investment like physically, but playing like harmonicas or this kind of thing doesn't really require me to stay in a good physical shape vis-a-vis my lungs and lips and tongue.

323
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,120
Speaker 1: I can kind of just play them whenever I want.

324
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,512
Speaker 1: Like I'll be just as good at them if I don't play them for a month as if I play them every day.

325
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,659
Speaker 1: My skill level won't change.

326
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:41,974
Speaker 1: In the meantime, the Book Club book remains Emily Wilson's modern translation of Homer's Odyssey.

327
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:46,137
Speaker 0: The- I'm still reading it on the pooper in the train and you know what?

328
00:23:46,317 --> 00:23:48,345
Speaker 0: The Odyssey, you know, it's an epic.

329
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:49,834
Speaker 0: It's the Odyssey.

330
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:51,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:23:52,047 --> 00:23:52,954
Speaker 1: The word Odyssey.

332
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:53,579
Speaker 1: Odysseus.

333
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,252
Speaker 0: It makes it seem real big, but you know what?

334
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:56,834
Speaker 0: It's not so big.

335
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,860
Speaker 0: This book is going by fast.

336
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:58,262
Speaker 0: Yeah.

337
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:58,945
Speaker 1: I told you.

338
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:02,945
Speaker 1: I mean, it starts with Telemachus being like, oh shit.

339
00:24:03,046 --> 00:24:04,720
Speaker 0: I'm already like book four or five or something.

340
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:05,384
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

341
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,310
Speaker 1: Where's my dad?

342
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:12,629
Speaker 1: And Athena being like, yo, I'm going to make you a man and you're going to have a crush on me, but that's not going to matter.

343
00:24:13,031 --> 00:24:14,139
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to help your dad.

344
00:24:14,681 --> 00:24:16,799
Speaker 1: And then we're going to kill a whole bunch of people at the end.

345
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:19,900
Speaker 0: I'm hanging with King Nestor.

346
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,867
Speaker 1: Oh, the Nestor.

347
00:24:22,188 --> 00:24:24,760
Speaker 1: I didn't remember all the details of King Nestor.

348
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,387
Speaker 1: I love how he never fucking shuts up.

349
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:37,520
Speaker 1: Like Nestor is, it's not my favorite character, but if there was a, if there was a good movie version of the Odyssey, I feel like he would be the funniest character.

350
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,225
Speaker 0: I think we're next.

351
00:24:38,245 --> 00:24:39,880
Speaker 0: We're going to go check out Menelaus.

352
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:41,062
Speaker 1: Yup.

353
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:46,099
Speaker 1: You're going to go to Menelaus and then you're going to cut back to what Odysseus is up to with Calypso.

354
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,520
Speaker 0: And being sad, even though he's banging the god lady.

355
00:24:51,681 --> 00:25:00,878
Speaker 1: I still like the idea that the implication is eventually he's too sad and wants to go home, but he does just go and have sex with her literally every night.

356
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,019
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you?

357
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,840
Speaker 1: The opening scene is like, he's like, oh, I want to go home.

358
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,108
Speaker 1: And she's like, well, you can't anyway.

359
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:12,539
Speaker 0: It's about 5 p.m So, uh, I'm like, I'm also like the hottest guy.

360
00:25:14,143 --> 00:25:18,560
Speaker 1: I mean, it's telling when, uh, uh, Mercury comes or Hermes.

361
00:25:19,505 --> 00:25:20,539
Speaker 0: Mercury is his Roman.

362
00:25:20,741 --> 00:25:20,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

363
00:25:21,182 --> 00:25:25,960
Speaker 1: When Hermes comes to tell Calypso, yo, you've got to let Odysseus go.

364
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:29,220
Speaker 1: Even he is like, wow, she is beautiful.

365
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:30,062
Speaker 1: Wow.

366
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:31,372
Speaker 1: This island is a paradise.

367
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,320
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

368
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:33,466
Speaker 1: I'm impressed.

369
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,280
Speaker 1: And I literally just came here from Olympus.

370
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,121
Speaker 0: Yeah.

371
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:39,580
Speaker 0: Why doesn't, uh, Hermes get it on with Calypso?

372
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,618
Speaker 0: I feel like.

373
00:25:40,901 --> 00:25:42,800
Speaker 0: Why does it, why does Calypso want Odysseus?

374
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,679
Speaker 1: I feel like Calypso doesn't particularly like Hermes or Zeus or really any of them.

375
00:25:49,084 --> 00:25:50,099
Speaker 0: Why did you like Odysseus?

376
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,767
Speaker 1: Uh, they get into that the same reason.

377
00:25:52,848 --> 00:26:07,240
Speaker 1: Athena and Zeus like Odysseus, because of all the humans, he's kind of the smartest one, but in quotes, because he's smart, the way they like people to be meaning lying all the time to everyone about everything.

378
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,035
Speaker 0: God's just decided he shall be the protagonist.

379
00:26:10,075 --> 00:26:10,699
Speaker 0: Therefore he is.

380
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,629
Speaker 1: I mean, the book opens with literally Athena's like, yo, you can help Odysseus out.

381
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:16,000
Speaker 1: And Zeus is like, oh, right.

382
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,603
Speaker 1: Odysseus.

383
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:16,865
Speaker 1: Yeah.

384
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:17,894
Speaker 1: He's pretty cool.

385
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:18,519
Speaker 1: I like him.

386
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:19,952
Speaker 1: But he pissed off Poseidon.

387
00:26:19,972 --> 00:26:20,679
Speaker 1: What do you want me to do?

388
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,286
Speaker 0: Oh, my boy, Poseidon.

389
00:26:23,371 --> 00:26:23,813
Speaker 0: What's up?

390
00:26:23,894 --> 00:26:27,600
Speaker 0: I like how, uh, King Nestor, he'd be sacrificing to Poseidon because he knows.

391
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,580
Speaker 1: Because nobody likes Poseidon.

392
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:29,957
Speaker 0: I do.

393
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,340
Speaker 1: No, no one does.

394
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:31,979
Speaker 0: Scott does.

395
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:35,598
Speaker 1: You, you avoid pissing Poseidon off.

396
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,566
Speaker 1: Yes.

397
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:37,459
Speaker 0: Because he's awesome.

398
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,078
Speaker 1: Yes.

399
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:40,500
Speaker 0: You should avoid pissing Scott off the same way.

400
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,760
Speaker 1: Poseidon is awesome.

401
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,839
Speaker 0: So don't make annoying noises.

402
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,440
Speaker 1: And everyone will say that he is awesome because you don't want to piss him off.

403
00:26:46,704 --> 00:26:47,000
Speaker 0: Anyway.

404
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:54,940
Speaker 1: But yes, we will be very soon at the Penny Arcade Expo East in Boston.

405
00:26:55,902 --> 00:26:57,319
Speaker 1: It is four days long.

406
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,860
Speaker 1: We're going to be there on Wednesday and there is official gaming on Wednesday.

407
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,038
Speaker 1: It's five days long.

408
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,180
Speaker 1: So we will be there and it's going to be awesome.

409
00:27:07,703 --> 00:27:14,659
Speaker 1: If you want to find us and play games, we're pretty much going to be in tabletop morning and afternoon every day.

410
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:21,720
Speaker 1: Except on Sunday morning, we're going to be doing, uh, the final full version of our 40 tabletop games.

411
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,800
Speaker 1: You must play panel at 10 30 AM in the arachnid theater.

412
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:33,700
Speaker 0: Also, if you're listening to this right now, it's probably too late, but anime Boston that we used to go to, but no longer go to is like tomorrow.

413
00:27:33,982 --> 00:27:45,140
Speaker 1: And I do want to say, or today for most of you, us not going to anime Boston for a few years should not convince you not to go because you're near it and you like anime.

414
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,666
Speaker 0: Go to it is the best anime con on the Eastern Seaboard.

415
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,579
Speaker 1: Like there is these days.

416
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,719
Speaker 1: I haven't been, I mean, I hear things.

417
00:27:57,004 --> 00:27:57,718
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

418
00:27:58,162 --> 00:28:01,440
Speaker 1: Like it's hard to tell what these definitely past its peak is the thing.

419
00:28:01,541 --> 00:28:02,377
Speaker 0: So it's like, I don't know.

420
00:28:02,801 --> 00:28:08,100
Speaker 1: But having been to much more recent anime Bostons, it's got everything you want out of an anime.

421
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:10,374
Speaker 0: You want to go to anime con is worth going to.

422
00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:11,159
Speaker 1: the panels are.

423
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,379
Speaker 0: NYC is too new for me to judge.

424
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,540
Speaker 1: But you heard me saying the panels and anime Boston.

425
00:28:16,984 --> 00:28:18,340
Speaker 1: There are good panels there.

426
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,635
Speaker 1: I barely even say that about packs is also a real good.

427
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:22,620
Speaker 0: Japanese guests there.

428
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:23,140
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:28:23,381 --> 00:28:26,140
Speaker 1: Like if you want to see legit guests, good artists alley there.

430
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:26,578
Speaker 0: Yeah.

431
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:28,700
Speaker 1: And there's great food like right there.

432
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,239
Speaker 1: Like anime Boston has got a lot going on.

433
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:37,320
Speaker 1: The only reason we are not there is that we go to four between four and six packs as a year and magfest.

434
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,499
Speaker 1: And it's hard to go to more than 10 conventions a year.

435
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:49,417
Speaker 0: Also, we gotta be doing some, uh, anime judging for the, uh, spring, whatever season is next real soon.

436
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:50,020
Speaker 1: Yep.

437
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,587
Speaker 1: So what would be on the lookout for?

438
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:57,820
Speaker 1: our geek nights presents utenna show, which is continuing, uh, the geek nights judges anime by its cover, which is continuing.

439
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,800
Speaker 1: All that stuff is coming.

440
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,620
Speaker 0: There's a new season.

441
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,156
Speaker 0: We got judge.

442
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,400
Speaker 1: And if you want to actually find us and see us at packs east, it's actually really hard to find us in tabletop because east is an enormous convention.

443
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,919
Speaker 1: It's the biggest packs.

444
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,160
Speaker 0: And it's at least it's all one building at west.

445
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,300
Speaker 0: It's like you could be in any building.

446
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,096
Speaker 0: You don't know where someone is.

447
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,240
Speaker 1: Well, you know where we are.

448
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,080
Speaker 1: There's only two buildings with tabletop in them.

449
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,700
Speaker 0: I'm just saying at east, you know, it's, it's one building.

450
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,420
Speaker 1: East we say, Oh, I'm in tabletop.

451
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,557
Speaker 1: That literally doesn't help.

452
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can find them.

453
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,719
Speaker 1: You can't find us, but coming to our panel is the only guaranteed way to find us.

454
00:29:32,822 --> 00:29:35,060
Speaker 1: Just saying so socks.

455
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:36,799
Speaker 1: Let's talk about socks.

456
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,979
Speaker 0: You put them on your feet because it's cold.

457
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,159
Speaker 1: So there are two kinds of socks.

458
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:42,200
Speaker 1: Well, there's three kinds.

459
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,579
Speaker 0: There's four more than three guys for a, then there's five.

460
00:29:45,862 --> 00:29:46,698
Speaker 0: There's many kinds.

461
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,540
Speaker 1: So five socks.

462
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,208
Speaker 1: Five is from RFC 1928, which extends the socks.

463
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,560
Speaker 0: So the first thing I got to say, holy shit socks.

464
00:29:55,741 --> 00:29:57,519
Speaker 1: Five supports IPV six.

465
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:12,160
Speaker 0: The first thing I got to say, okay, I'm not going to is that if it's warm out and you got sneakers, no socks is maximum comfiness, but the problem your S your feet and your shoes will smell like death forever permanently.

466
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,039
Speaker 0: Yes, that is the old.

467
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,200
Speaker 0: So that is like the worst.

468
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:24,299
Speaker 1: So there's a second worst there that I have found that if you go barefoot and you do sports, you will get blisters even if you have really comfortable shoes.

469
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:26,680
Speaker 0: Also, you'll probably get foot fungus.

470
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're, you're gonna have a lot of trouble.

471
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:34,474
Speaker 1: Same reason why if you never wear underwear, uh, you're gonna have trouble with the jeans, son.

472
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,460
Speaker 1: Just saying, just saying.

473
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:46,840
Speaker 0: So, uh, therefore I found that in the summer when it's warm and when I'm wearing sneakers, I have discovered that I prefer the most minimal sock possible.

474
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:48,446
Speaker 1: I was at work.

475
00:30:48,466 --> 00:30:52,160
Speaker 0: that only covers the bottom of the foot and the back as a little rubbery bit.

476
00:30:52,221 --> 00:30:54,039
Speaker 0: So it stays on at the heel, the no-shows.

477
00:30:54,702 --> 00:30:58,340
Speaker 0: And then when you put your sneaker on, you can't even know that I'm wearing a sock.

478
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:02,760
Speaker 0: And then it's basically almost as comfy as not wearing any socks.

479
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:07,280
Speaker 1: So my UX team at work, actually, they were going out to like to have drinks and hang out and celebrate something today.

480
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:08,660
Speaker 1: And they were like, oh, you should come.

481
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,380
Speaker 1: And I only didn't come because I was coming here to do this.

482
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,598
Speaker 1: I was like, oh no, I get to do the show.

483
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,540
Speaker 1: And they were like, oh, what are you doing the show on?

484
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:15,820
Speaker 1: And I was like socks.

485
00:31:17,161 --> 00:31:20,720
Speaker 1: The immediate reaction was the conversation we're having immediately.

486
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:23,060
Speaker 1: They were like, oh yeah, I'm all about the smart wool.

487
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,100
Speaker 1: And someone else is like, no, no, you got to get the no-shows.

488
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:28,780
Speaker 1: And everyone like took their shoes off and socks happened.

489
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,100
Speaker 1: The no-shows are really popular lately.

490
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,793
Speaker 0: So the ones I found, so I've researched them.

491
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,840
Speaker 1: Why do you care if they show or not?

492
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:39,519
Speaker 0: It's not about the showing.

493
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:43,700
Speaker 0: It's about the fact, like I just said, having no sock is maximum comfort.

494
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,020
Speaker 0: So you're getting as close to no sock as possible.

495
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,299
Speaker 1: Ah, the minimal sock.

496
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:49,979
Speaker 0: That's the same reason I wear toe shoes.

497
00:31:50,140 --> 00:32:04,778
Speaker 0: While also still gaining all the benefits of sock of avoiding the fungus, avoiding the smell, avoiding the, you're basically getting all the benefits of sock with the least amount of socks when it's warm and you don't need the sock to warm your foot and you're wearing a comfy shoe and such and

498
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:04,920
Speaker 1: such.

499
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:12,359
Speaker 1: I do point out that there is a very specific use case between like maximum comfort, barefoot, and you're trying to be as close to that as possible is one thing.

500
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:17,760
Speaker 1: But one thing you don't do is endurance sports, like running.

501
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:26,900
Speaker 1: When you're running, you actually need the sock for a specific thing where barefoot would be objectively worse, even if you, even if you ignored the fungus in the smell.

502
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:30,520
Speaker 1: And the problem is it'll get wet and sweaty and lead to blisters.

503
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,159
Speaker 1: And like the wetness will be a problem.

504
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:40,360
Speaker 1: Good quality socks, even the no-shows provide the wicking effect to keep your foot nice and dry when you're running like 10 miles.

505
00:32:41,522 --> 00:32:46,340
Speaker 1: It also provides a tiny bit of padding to prevent like chafing.

506
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:52,760
Speaker 1: Like you don't want your toes to chafe because when you're just walking somewhere, you're not like rubbing your toe against the front of your shoe.

507
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,240
Speaker 1: But when you're running, you're rubbing your toe against the shoe because you're hitting the ground hard with every step.

508
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:00,340
Speaker 1: And your foot has a lot more movement.

509
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,060
Speaker 1: Even if you've tied your shoes, you should be the wrong size.

510
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,220
Speaker 1: If your toe is hitting the, uh, no, even, even if there's buffer in the front, like your foot's going to move a little bit, you might hit the ground hard.

511
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,818
Speaker 1: There's no shoe.

512
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:12,820
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's perfect.

513
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,540
Speaker 0: So as for the showing part, right?

514
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,138
Speaker 0: It's, you know, depending on the pants you're wearing and the shoe you're wearing, right?

515
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:25,880
Speaker 0: The amount of showing and the style of showing could be cool and or dorky.

516
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:45,740
Speaker 1: Well, case in point, I see a lot of people, like a lot of people and it kind of, it kind of bothers me when people have pants that are a little too short and they're wearing socks that show like a crew sock size, but the pain when they sit down, you see bare leg above a tall sock.

517
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,536
Speaker 0: That's me right now.

518
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,779
Speaker 0: That is bad news because I'm sitting down.

519
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:57,900
Speaker 1: But if you show bare leg because you're wearing no shows, that's, that feels more like that seems more socially acceptable and more like this hipster style.

520
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,167
Speaker 0: That real, I don't like.

521
00:33:59,227 --> 00:34:04,520
Speaker 0: where you're wearing like, you know, like the dress sock with the designs on the side or whatever, like the diamonds and shit.

522
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,760
Speaker 1: With that, the argyle sock, it's all cover.

523
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:07,939
Speaker 0: It's all colored and shit.

524
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:16,119
Speaker 0: But when that, when someone's wearing that, I like that, but the, it doesn't go and the length is wrong and it's sort of like, well, that's it.

525
00:34:16,481 --> 00:34:20,940
Speaker 0: Sort of like this awkward hipster, you know, situation.

526
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:30,320
Speaker 1: If you're wearing the sock that has stuff on it, but the, there's a gap between the top of the sock and the bottom of your pants.

527
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:31,578
Speaker 1: You fucked up, son.

528
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:40,819
Speaker 1: But yeah, as long as they're properly sizing most people, their pants are the wrong size and I don't know why this is such a common problem to be honest.

529
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:45,759
Speaker 1: But in terms, I guess, so I have, I'll go straight in.

530
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,739
Speaker 1: I used to, when I was in like RIT, I would buy big old bags of just Hanes cotton socks, like as many as possible.

531
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,140
Speaker 0: I would buy bags, bags of white socks and then.

532
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,100
Speaker 1: And bags of black socks.

533
00:34:59,381 --> 00:35:00,239
Speaker 0: And when they got, oh, I didn't do that.

534
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,599
Speaker 1: And then when they went bad, I had to dress up a lot for my work.

535
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,359
Speaker 0: When they went bad, I would get rid of them and replace them again.

536
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:05,804
Speaker 1: Yup.

537
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:07,118
Speaker 0: And that was all I did.

538
00:35:07,662 --> 00:35:12,000
Speaker 1: But the problem, and the only, the main reason I bought them in bulk was one, I was poor.

539
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,839
Speaker 1: Like that, that's a valid reason.

540
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,740
Speaker 0: Cause I didn't care.

541
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,436
Speaker 1: Yeah.

542
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:16,199
Speaker 1: Two, I didn't care.

543
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,240
Speaker 1: And three, I didn't know better.

544
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,958
Speaker 1: Like I didn't know.

545
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,160
Speaker 0: Also even like El cheapo, you know, generic white socks are way comfy when they're new.

546
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,939
Speaker 0: It's like, wow, these are great.

547
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

548
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,300
Speaker 1: But as they get old, they get like, they become negative comfort.

549
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:27,592
Speaker 1: Yes.

550
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,899
Speaker 0: They're a little scratchy and stiff.

551
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:42,040
Speaker 1: But I also didn't really, I didn't know like in high school and even like in the early years of RIT, that there were kinds of socks that were objectively better in structural ways or materials that like, I didn't know.

552
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:44,680
Speaker 0: I went to the store, there was a bag of white socks and I was like, hell yeah.

553
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,400
Speaker 1: And then next to them, I'd see one pair of socks that cost the same as the whole bag.

554
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:48,625
Speaker 1: Yeah.

555
00:35:49,601 --> 00:35:55,160
Speaker 1: And more importantly, same, I did the same thing with underwear and t-shirts in college.

556
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:00,640
Speaker 1: My main, one of my main goals in life was to do laundry as few times as possible.

557
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:07,420
Speaker 1: So buying more socks, man, I could go longer before I had to do a unit of laundry.

558
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,555
Speaker 1: And then I do a little, I'd literally take all my socks and wash them all at once and put them right in the dryer.

559
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:16,820
Speaker 1: But yeah, those socks suck.

560
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:17,560
Speaker 1: And now I know better.

561
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,776
Speaker 1: So nowadays I probably, I actually have a bunch of different kinds of socks for different contexts.

562
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,520
Speaker 1: So on one hand I threw away on my old shitty side.

563
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,579
Speaker 0: I just change them with the weather.

564
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:33,640
Speaker 1: So I do buy black cotton crew socks in bulk still.

565
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,120
Speaker 1: I have a big old bag of like Hanes equivalent, just black socks.

566
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:42,579
Speaker 1: And the reason for that is black and nondescript socks are what I generally like.

567
00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:44,739
Speaker 1: They're the safest thing to wear at work.

568
00:36:45,985 --> 00:36:46,957
Speaker 1: Just the way I dress at work.

569
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:52,060
Speaker 1: They don't in any way interfere with anything I would wear at work in any context.

570
00:36:53,082 --> 00:37:03,236
Speaker 1: And I can throw them away as soon as they start to wear out and replace them and never worry about it without wearing out my actually really expensive socks by wearing them every single day.

571
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:09,060
Speaker 1: So I have these like shitty socks that I wear when it doesn't matter and I buy them in bulk.

572
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,199
Speaker 1: I throw them away when there's even a hint of trouble and just buy them in bulk again.

573
00:37:14,363 --> 00:37:16,540
Speaker 1: But then I have my running socks.

574
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,500
Speaker 1: They're not no shows because actually I have a problem when I run.

575
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:32,199
Speaker 1: If I wear the completely minimalist socks that you don't even see the top of my foot, like my ankle area, like the bottom of the ankle will interact with the top of my shoe and cause chafing.

576
00:37:32,582 --> 00:37:36,159
Speaker 1: If I run long distances, I need a sock that at least gets above the ankle.

577
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:37,979
Speaker 1: So I have ankle socks.

578
00:37:38,361 --> 00:37:39,240
Speaker 1: They're all smart wool.

579
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,379
Speaker 1: I buy this one particular smart will sock.

580
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:45,260
Speaker 1: That is like the perfect long distance running smartwool.

581
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
Speaker 0: Smartwool is a brand like TM Smartwool.

582
00:37:48,021 --> 00:37:48,700
Speaker 0: You can get anything.

583
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,560
Speaker 1: You can get any smartwool equivalent, right?

584
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:53,340
Speaker 0: It's like, but the actual smartwool brand costs a fucking fortune.

585
00:37:53,788 --> 00:37:54,298
Speaker 0: You can buy it.

586
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,900
Speaker 0: Like for example, when it gets cold, I wear like big fancy wool socks, right?

587
00:37:58,961 --> 00:38:01,260
Speaker 0: And I bought them in bulk on Amazon, but they're high quality.

588
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:06,080
Speaker 0: But the brand is like people socks, but they're the exact same thing as smartwool socks.

589
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:08,439
Speaker 1: It is the way it makes really good ones too.

590
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,820
Speaker 0: There's tons of them you can get.

591
00:38:09,941 --> 00:38:11,020
Speaker 0: They're all pretty great.

592
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:11,540
Speaker 0: They're real.

593
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,460
Speaker 0: You know, they're really meant for like wearing big boots and hiking in the woods, but they keep your feet so warm and toasty and they're so nice and comfy.

594
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:20,759
Speaker 0: If it's cold out, why not wear them?

595
00:38:21,905 --> 00:38:25,140
Speaker 1: So I have smartwool socks that are like crew length that I'll wear.

596
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,919
Speaker 1: Like if I'm not at work, like if I'm hanging out on the weekend, I'll wear those kinds of socks with my comfortable shoes.

597
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,100
Speaker 1: But, or like at a packs, like those are the best things to wear at a pack.

598
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,560
Speaker 0: So you can, you can also just wear them without any shoes if you're in the house or whatever.

599
00:38:38,841 --> 00:38:40,059
Speaker 0: Cause it's almost a slipper.

600
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:40,977
Speaker 0: Almost.

601
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:41,313
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,400
Speaker 1: It does wear them out faster though.

603
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,360
Speaker 1: You're going to wear out the bottoms.

604
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,996
Speaker 0: You mean you put your slippers on if you got them, but you know, you, you know, they're still comfy.

605
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:47,394
Speaker 1: Yep.

606
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,659
Speaker 0: You can wear them while you're sleeping to keep your feet warm.

607
00:38:49,921 --> 00:38:59,360
Speaker 1: Then when I'm doing shorter runs or like high speed runs, like I'm running a 5k instead of the smart wool ankle socks, I wear the like super middle.

608
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,600
Speaker 1: They're basically like spandex no-shows.

609
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,840
Speaker 1: They're kind of, they're made out of various materials.

610
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,654
Speaker 1: They're like super sporty.

611
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:08,020
Speaker 1: Their sole goal is to protect my foot, wick sweat away.

612
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,679
Speaker 1: And I wear those for like short runs.

613
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,719
Speaker 1: And then I have a whole bunch of winter socks that might be smartwool or other brands, but those are like the ones that go all the way up my leg.

614
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:21,059
Speaker 1: They're like super warm.

615
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,060
Speaker 1: They're super expensive relative to socks.

616
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:31,680
Speaker 1: I only wear them when I have a good reason to like, I'm going skiing or I'm going to be walking outside in New York a lot on this day.

617
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,499
Speaker 1: That's really cold.

618
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:36,599
Speaker 1: Or I'm at PAX East because fuck the weather in Boston during PAX East.

619
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:44,159
Speaker 0: My sock drawer actually right now is full of the previous generation of socks I have to get rid of, which I don't wear.

620
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,654
Speaker 0: Right.

621
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:49,040
Speaker 0: It's full of the no-showing socks, right?

622
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,870
Speaker 0: It's full of the wool, the big wintery warm socks.

623
00:39:55,482 --> 00:40:01,800
Speaker 0: I have two pairs of socks that are just for bicycling because they're warm, but they are also thinner.

624
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:05,700
Speaker 0: I couldn't wear the big thick wool socks in a bicycle shoe.

625
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,980
Speaker 1: If it's summer, I wear those no-show minimalist ones on my bike shoes.

626
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,780
Speaker 1: And if it's cold out, I just wear my smartwools.

627
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:23,018
Speaker 0: And then I have one dress sock of each color in case there is a dress occasion, which there hardly ever is.

628
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:32,979
Speaker 1: So because of the nature of the dress, when I wear dress clothes, like formal attire, I tend to do traditional black suits.

629
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:37,940
Speaker 1: And I tend to have a slightly longer leg cut on my dress pants on purpose.

630
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:42,800
Speaker 1: So I tend to actually use my shitty black socks because no one can tell.

631
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,240
Speaker 1: Like I don't have, I do not have proper dress socks currently.

632
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,320
Speaker 0: I just have one pair of every, you know, one black, one brown, one blue, one, you know.

633
00:40:52,421 --> 00:40:53,518
Speaker 0: I do not have an occasion.

634
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:57,640
Speaker 1: I have no formal outfit that would require a non-black dress sock.

635
00:40:59,703 --> 00:41:01,980
Speaker 0: I think my suit is blue and my shoe is brown.

636
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,600
Speaker 0: So they usually use the blue sock, but I can switch it up.

637
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,760
Speaker 1: Well, usually I'm wearing like a jacket.

638
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,914
Speaker 1: Like I'm wearing like more business casual or like pre-formal wear.

639
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,119
Speaker 0: The point is it never hurts to have, right?

640
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,240
Speaker 0: Just one of each just covers any possible scenario.

641
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,020
Speaker 0: You don't, cause you know, what ends up happening is if you don't have that, you know, there's that like, Oh no, I got to go to a thing.

642
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:23,500
Speaker 0: And you go to the store and I had to buy a sock.

643
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:25,800
Speaker 0: I never had to do that because I have one of everything.

644
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:34,939
Speaker 1: It also, I do need a new like set of dress socks because the deal with the dress sock is that unlike say the cheapo black socks I have, the dress sock will still look black.

645
00:41:35,683 --> 00:41:37,019
Speaker 1: Like the color will be good.

646
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:38,399
Speaker 1: So no one will notice it.

647
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:43,514
Speaker 1: Someone who pays attention to the fashion will notice if they see your shitty sock, but normal people don't.

648
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:52,400
Speaker 1: But two, if your dress pants are not perfectly fitted, you need to make sure the dress sock is tall enough to make sure you never show any skin.

649
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,680
Speaker 1: You cannot show skin with formal dress pants.

650
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:02,120
Speaker 0: The other important thing is that like, you know, you get a tall sock, you got to make sure it's nice and tight against your leg.

651
00:42:02,181 --> 00:42:03,260
Speaker 0: Oh, it can't roll down.

652
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:07,400
Speaker 0: If it sags or rolls down, you're going to be pulling it up all the time.

653
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:12,999
Speaker 1: Or you're going to give up and then you're going to maintain that elasticity.

654
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,359
Speaker 0: A sock that gets pushed down a whole bunch or falls down is no good.

655
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,400
Speaker 1: So I have one more kind of sock actually.

656
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,740
Speaker 1: And I did recently, I actually bought a bunch of metal bins and I filled my sock drawer with them to separate all my kinds of socks.

657
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,500
Speaker 1: So I never have to fumble because I got a bunch of different kinds of socks.

658
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,900
Speaker 1: But, uh, so I have toe socks.

659
00:42:32,544 --> 00:42:33,260
Speaker 1: They're all minimalist.

660
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,980
Speaker 0: They're all like, oh, for your toe shoes.

661
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,180
Speaker 1: I got the toe shoe, but actually toe sock real comfortable inside of regular shoe.

662
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,859
Speaker 0: Well, because I mean, yeah, you got something in between your toes, right?

663
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,719
Speaker 0: You know, scratching that bit in between there where the web is.

664
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,640
Speaker 1: Which feels good, which is interesting because full disclosure, when I was a kid, like elementary school, I had two weird hangups.

665
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:58,099
Speaker 1: If I, if my sock got wet at any point, it has to go.

666
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:58,659
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

667
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,600
Speaker 0: So I think everyone has this hang up.

668
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,080
Speaker 0: I got, I can't deny if I'm wearing a wet sock.

669
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:04,280
Speaker 0: That is awful.

670
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,099
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, like if I was getting dressed for school and I stepped in some water in the bathroom in my sock, I took the sock off new sock.

671
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,660
Speaker 0: But some people, you know, obviously I think, I don't know anyone who likes a wet sock.

672
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,860
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's someone, right?

673
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,358
Speaker 0: But most people, I think when their sock is wet or like, oh, this is really uncomfortable and awful.

674
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,100
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,560
Speaker 0: But, uh, there are some people like you and other people I've known where if the sock gets wet, it's beyond awful.

676
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,340
Speaker 0: Like they're like, oh my God is the worst thing.

677
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,420
Speaker 1: I was only like that.

678
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:34,860
Speaker 1: However, in elementary school and nowadays it's more like, uh, my sock is wet.

679
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,498
Speaker 0: For me, I just go and I get rid of it as quickly as possible, but I don't like freaking freak out.

680
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,840
Speaker 1: But I, well, but it's more like if I, like, even if I'm rushing out the door and I step into some water, I don't replace the sock.

681
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,960
Speaker 1: I just, this too shall pass.

682
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:49,700
Speaker 1: And then I go about my day cause it'll dry soon enough.

683
00:43:50,321 --> 00:43:51,400
Speaker 1: That's the advantage though.

684
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,299
Speaker 0: You can get some, you know, then you get stinkies and funguses if you do that.

685
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,139
Speaker 1: Well, if it gets that wet, then yeah, if I like step in the toilet, of course I'm replacing the sock.

686
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:01,619
Speaker 1: I like spill an entire glass of water on my foot.

687
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:08,640
Speaker 1: But if you wear the fancy socks, like the sports socks, it doesn't matter if they get wet, they like dry immediately.

688
00:44:09,061 --> 00:44:09,457
Speaker 0: No, some of them.

689
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,260
Speaker 1: The good ones.

690
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,880
Speaker 1: Like, so one time we went to anime Boston, right?

691
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,599
Speaker 1: And I was wearing my toe shoes and I was wearing some, uh, fancy sport, like wicking socks, like toe socks.

692
00:44:19,382 --> 00:44:22,159
Speaker 1: I forgot to actually pack socks for the trip.

693
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:25,459
Speaker 1: So for three days in Boston, I only had one pair of socks.

694
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:31,659
Speaker 1: So every night when we got from, when he came in from the con, I took the socks, I just washed them in the sink.

695
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,900
Speaker 1: Like it went with my hands and a tiny bit of soap.

696
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:40,659
Speaker 1: And then I just left them out and they were always dry by morning because they were fancy modern wicking socks.

697
00:44:41,141 --> 00:44:43,760
Speaker 1: If those had been cotton socks, I would have been fucked.

698
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,876
Speaker 1: I would have had to go buy socks.

699
00:44:46,342 --> 00:44:47,920
Speaker 1: Cotton socks have a lot of problems.

700
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,918
Speaker 1: Like you were better off having synthetic, uh, Merino wool or a combination of synthetic and Merino wool.

701
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:56,420
Speaker 0: Here's the thing about cotton, right?

702
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,620
Speaker 0: And it counts not just for socks, but for all clothes.

703
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,738
Speaker 1: There's an entire Seinfeld episode about this.

704
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,480
Speaker 0: Is that cotton clothing is way comfortable and way inexpensive and it can be way nice, right?

705
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,020
Speaker 0: But it's only good for sedentary, dry activities.

706
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,719
Speaker 0: Also good if you're going to get set on fire somehow.

707
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,879
Speaker 1: Real good for like firemen, not pajamas you're going to wear to bed necessarily, but pajamas you walk around the house with.

708
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:24,880
Speaker 0: But any other activity, right?

709
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,540
Speaker 0: Cotton is not so good.

710
00:45:26,621 --> 00:45:28,620
Speaker 0: If you're doing anything athletic, right?

711
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,379
Speaker 1: If it gets wet, it's not going to dry.

712
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:30,760
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,560
Speaker 0: You'll melt inside of it and it doesn't block the wind.

714
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:33,724
Speaker 1: Right.

715
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,139
Speaker 1: It doesn't wick sweat away so much as concentrated in your armpits.

716
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:39,260
Speaker 0: It's not proof.

717
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:40,820
Speaker 0: It doesn't protect you from the rain.

718
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:42,940
Speaker 0: It's like it turns into sandpaper.

719
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,080
Speaker 0: It's basically the worst possible fabric material for actually doing stuff and the best for laying, lazing about.

720
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:55,920
Speaker 0: Most people laze about all the time and the cotton can work for all their clothes.

721
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:04,080
Speaker 0: But if you do any activity whatsoever involving the environment or athleticism, then you want zero percent cotton.

722
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:04,837
Speaker 0: Cotton is the worst.

723
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:05,358
Speaker 1: Yup.

724
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,757
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much it.

725
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:10,479
Speaker 1: But yeah, I watched those toe socks.

726
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,520
Speaker 1: They just dried immediately.

727
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,959
Speaker 1: But I have a whole bunch of toe socks.

728
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,320
Speaker 1: There's one real annoying thing about toe socks.

729
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:19,100
Speaker 1: Left and right matter because they're different.

730
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:24,460
Speaker 1: So you can't just have a bin of 30 identical socks and just pull two out of it.

731
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:27,079
Speaker 1: You got to get a left one and a right one.

732
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,560
Speaker 1: And for a while, I tried to separate left and right and two separate bins.

733
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,040
Speaker 0: What if one person has long toes and one person has short toes?

734
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:39,499
Speaker 1: That usually doesn't matter because actually I have a freakishly long middle toe and it just doesn't matter because they stretch a little bit.

735
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,818
Speaker 1: No one makes shady toe socks really for sports.

736
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:45,354
Speaker 1: They're all fancy.

737
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:48,760
Speaker 1: And EG makes them and Smartwool, that kind of stuff.

738
00:46:49,221 --> 00:46:49,839
Speaker 1: So they just work.

739
00:46:50,061 --> 00:46:50,336
Speaker 1: They fit.

740
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,680
Speaker 1: But I tried separating left and right and that was not tenable.

741
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,780
Speaker 1: So what I did instead is every single toe sock I buy is a different color.

742
00:47:04,982 --> 00:47:07,280
Speaker 1: So every pair is absolutely unique.

743
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,978
Speaker 1: So I just have to find the pair as opposed to finding the one with the L on it and then finding the one with the R on it.

744
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:16,619
Speaker 1: Or even worse, the shitty brands that don't label them.

745
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,760
Speaker 1: So you got to dig through and be like, is this a left?

746
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,639
Speaker 1: Is this a right?

747
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,199
Speaker 1: Whoa betide, you bring four left socks on your trip.

748
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,820
Speaker 1: Granted, actually my fancy ski socks also have a left and right despite the no toes because they're sort of like they're set to fit your foot very particularly.

749
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:34,640
Speaker 1: But that's sort of a weird edge case.

750
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,699
Speaker 1: That's like specialty sports equipment more so than sock.

751
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:42,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I didn't think a lot about socks in high school.

752
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:46,520
Speaker 1: And I think a lot more about socks now that I'm older.

753
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,960
Speaker 1: And apparently on this Wikipedia page, there are special specific socks just for flip flops.

754
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:54,506
Speaker 0: No.

755
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:56,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

756
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,600
Speaker 0: Flip flops if you should never wear them, but if you do, no socks.

757
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:08,180
Speaker 1: The whole point of a flip flop is that they are the minimum barrier to entry between barefoot and something on your foot.

758
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:16,220
Speaker 1: If you do anything to increase the complexity of that arrangement, you have already ruined the sole reason to wear flip flops in the first place.

759
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:26,260
Speaker 1: The whole point of a flip flop is you literally want there to be less than a second between not wearing shoes and technically wearing the barest minimum legal definition of shoes.

760
00:48:27,381 --> 00:48:27,818
Speaker 0: That's right.

761
00:48:28,962 --> 00:48:29,158
Speaker 1: All right.

762
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,278
Speaker 1: I think we killed enough time with this.

763
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,600
Speaker 1: Share your sock comments in the forum.

764

765
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,579
