1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:22,360
Speaker 1: So, quite some time ago, I was biking home from work and I stopped and actually took a picture of it on my cell phone because there was a gigantic horse-headed man painted on a wall in Williamsburg.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,580
Speaker 0: And he was like sexy pose, right?

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,915
Speaker 0: It was like he was mostly nude and it looked like an underwear ad but with this cartoon horse and we're almost like, "I remember you tweeted about

4
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:32,996
Speaker 0: it.".

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,498
Speaker 1: Well, first I messaged it directly at Adam and I was like, "Hey

6
00:00:36,598 --> 00:00:36,920
Speaker 1: there.".

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,098
Speaker 1: Because it said, "Hey there," like, "Hey," like, "Horses eat

8
00:00:40,138 --> 00:00:40,320
Speaker 1: hay.".

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:48,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so you were just like, and you know, it's the kind of thing that's basically like weird shit that's Rims aesthetic, just like bizarre furry stuff.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 1: I mean, I like bizarre furry stuff, skeletons.

11
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,219
Speaker 0: Bojack doesn't have any skeletons, but it does have a lot of bizarre furry stuff.

12
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:00,278
Speaker 1: Sort of though, because it's basically, so if I had to describe, so Bojack...

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,040
Speaker 0: Anthropomorphic animals, you know, like we said during the Zootopia review.

14
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,280
Speaker 1: It's more like Californication, but half the people are animals.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,959
Speaker 0: Have you watched Californication?

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,379
Speaker 0: I was like, "How do you know what it's like if you haven't seen the

17
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:13,620
Speaker 0: show?".

18
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,139
Speaker 1: I saw some bits of it just because you see things, but eh.

19
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,860
Speaker 1: It was not the kind of show I expected I would care about.

20
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:27,760
Speaker 0: It's the quintessential, you know, the tainted life of Hollywood celebrities down and out.

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,600
Speaker 1: But I don't, because we started watching Bojack like pretty early after it actually came out and I don't remember who recommended it to us.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,503
Speaker 0: Cat and Carl.

23
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:40,820
Speaker 0: I know for a fact it was our friends Cat and Carl, because Carl, he likes a lot of comedy stuff.

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Speaker 0: He's a comedian, so he's always recommending comedy shows and stuff like that.

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,239
Speaker 0: And so I was over at their house and they're like, "Let's put on that Netflix

26
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:50,440
Speaker 0: show.".

27
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:53,760
Speaker 0: And I watch a few episodes, and they were early episodes, right?

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,289
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Haha, this is actually pretty funny.

29
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:58,839
Speaker 0: This is better than I expected it to

30
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:58,960
Speaker 0: be.".

31
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:08,380
Speaker 1: Honestly, it was funny, but it was also kind of like it's a typical four adults American cartoon where everything's kind of vulgar and gross and a little bit weird.

32
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was kind of like, "Oh wow, it's a cartoon, but they're talking about sex.

33
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:13,298
Speaker 0: Oh, let's be

34
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:13,599
Speaker 0: edgy.".

35
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,356
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Oh, this is

36
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:15,619
Speaker 0: good.".

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:23,020
Speaker 1: And that was juxtaposed with just really obvious and really low-hanging fruit animal puns everywhere and animal jokes.

38
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:26,837
Speaker 0: But even early episodes, I was like, "This is

39
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,439
Speaker 0: watchable.".

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,145
Speaker 0: And I actually got you to watch it.

41
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:31,935
Speaker 0: I was like, "Hey, we don't have anything to watch tonight.

42
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:33,380
Speaker 0: Let's just put on this show I saw over at

43
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,500
Speaker 0: Cat's.".

44
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watched an episode, it was okay, and then we watched another episode a few days later and it was okay.

45
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,638
Speaker 1: And it really quickly happened.

46
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:41,781
Speaker 0: It changes.

47
00:02:41,942 --> 00:02:45,535
Speaker 0: Halfway through the first season, it really takes a turn and you're like,

48
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:46,057
Speaker 0: "Whoa.".

49
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:53,791
Speaker 0: A few episodes will end and it kind of creeps up on you, and you're like, "I didn't expect it to go there and get quite that

50
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:53,952
Speaker 0: dark.".

51
00:02:56,622 --> 00:03:00,175
Speaker 1: The first season was a bunch of, "Wow, I didn't think it would get that dark.

52
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:01,179
Speaker 1: Whoa, what's the show really

53
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 1: about?".

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,260
Speaker 1: And then season two was just this steam train to hell.

55
00:03:06,042 --> 00:03:07,867
Speaker 0: It is a hard show to watch.

56
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:13,580
Speaker 0: I would not recommend this show to anybody who is... Yeah, exactly.

57
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:28,560
Speaker 1: This show, really, it's about a depressed, rich celebrity who's not really a celebrity anymore, who is kind of a toxic person, and one by one he just poisons and ruins everyone around him who doesn't abandon him.

58
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,589
Speaker 0: I would say it's a show about failure.

59
00:03:30,951 --> 00:03:32,136
Speaker 0: That's really what it's about.

60
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:43,791
Speaker 0: It's like people failing to communicate, people failing in their careers, people failing in their relationships, all different ways in which people fail and...

61
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,760
Speaker 1: But they're all rolled up into basically one person failing.

62
00:03:49,060 --> 00:04:00,080
Speaker 1: Everyone else fails and also succeeds and lives a more reasonable life, and he just either always fails or fails and causes other people around him to fail, and when he does succeed, he treats it like a failure.

63
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, he can't be happy at his successes.

64
00:04:02,425 --> 00:04:18,416
Speaker 0: He has this kind of toxic thinking that doesn't allow him to... Princess Carolyn says at one time, "I could say ten nice things about you and one bad thing, and you would always focus on that one bad

65
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:18,678
Speaker 0: thing.".

66
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,340
Speaker 1: I think what Todd said in season three was a little more on the nose, though.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,082
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

68
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:30,420
Speaker 0: I don't even want to go into his monologue, because his monologue is like... A lot of times, the end of the show, it's kind of like Rick and Morty.

69
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,390
Speaker 0: Rick and Morty was another show where it started out, and I was like, "Haha.

70
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,152
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

71
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,078
Speaker 0: This is edgy adult

72
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:37,619
Speaker 0: animation.".

73
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,260
Speaker 1: And then they'll play the sad song.

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:47,228
Speaker 0: The sad song at the credits, and the part right before the credits just hits you really hard, and you're like, "That's where they're ending it?

75
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,071
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

76
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:48,513
Speaker 0: Fuck.

77
00:04:48,573 --> 00:04:49,175
Speaker 0: That's pretty

78
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:49,858
Speaker 0: harsh.".

79
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:57,275
Speaker 1: Of course, at least they set a precedent, because even an episode that didn't have that serious plot would still end kind of suddenly like, "Yay!

80
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:57,878
Speaker 0: Roll the

81
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:58,180
Speaker 0: credits!".

82
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:58,779
Speaker 0: The end.

83
00:04:58,981 --> 00:05:14,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but... But this show is more... The episodes pretty much always end on either a kind of pointed joke or a very pregnant moment in Bojack ruining everything around him.

84
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,331
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes they... One episode, literally.

85
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:19,219
Speaker 1: Motherfucker.

86
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:24,740
Speaker 0: Well, they end very melancholy in a lot of cases.

87
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:31,360
Speaker 0: Sometimes the plot threads have been wrapped up, but not necessarily in a happy ending sort of way.

88
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:34,108
Speaker 0: Or they're left hanging.

89
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:37,480
Speaker 0: It's almost like a cliffhanger, but not a high-intensity cliffhanger.

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,073
Speaker 0: A kind of like, "Oh, what's going to happen

91
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:41,434
Speaker 0: now?".

92
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:42,960
Speaker 0: kind of cliffhanger.

93
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,739
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, it's just going to get worse from here, isn't

94
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:45,820
Speaker 0: it?".

95
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,575
Speaker 1: I think almost every episode in season three ends with both of us saying,

96
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:49,178
Speaker 1: "Yeesh.".

97
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:50,840
Speaker 0: It's not rock bottom yet.

98
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:58,160
Speaker 1: So, I'm glad we waited until we're pretty much almost all the way through the third season.

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,935
Speaker 1: In fact, the episode we just watched, I think it ended on the lowest point.

100
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 1: the show has ended yet.

101
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,439
Speaker 0: But it was a really good scene, too.

102
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,220
Speaker 1: It was a really good episode, and in fact, season three has been hitting it out of the park.

103
00:06:11,401 --> 00:06:12,699
Speaker 1: It's like they're going for an Emmy.

104
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, high-concept episodes.

105
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,740
Speaker 0: There was one where he's at a film festival.

106
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:18,699
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's about an actor.

107
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:25,940
Speaker 0: And so, a lot of the humor stems from all the Hollywood jokes and the film industry.

108
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:26,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hollywood.

109
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,459
Speaker 0: That's another thing I like about it, is that there's a continuity in it.

110
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:35,620
Speaker 0: They'll have a throwaway joke, but then that joke will come back later.

111
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,980
Speaker 0: There will be a brand name or something, some character is representing.

112
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,120
Speaker 0: And then that brand name will be used for a joke half a season down the line.

113
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:55,240
Speaker 0: But yeah, Hollywoo, and the high-paced life of agents, and the stupid personal politics that are involved in the film business.

114
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,820
Speaker 0: But yeah, so he's at a festival underwater.

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
Speaker 0: And so he's unable to talk to anyone throughout the whole episode.

116
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:05,680
Speaker 0: And it's actually one of my favorite episodes.

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,666
Speaker 0: It's very beautiful.

118
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:08,298
Speaker 0: It's got good music and stuff.

119
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:19,440
Speaker 0: But I feel like Season 3 plays a lot more with the form of the episodes and does a lot more stuff, kind of experiments with the format.

120
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,045
Speaker 0: Well, that's it.

121
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,820
Speaker 1: Season 1 was the show sort of finding its feet.

122
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,601
Speaker 1: And if you look at the Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic stuff, it's 56% for Season 1.

123
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:30,480
Speaker 1: And it's actually 100% for both 2 and 3.

124
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny because the AV Club, they reviewed it based on the first few seasons.

125
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:40,120
Speaker 0: And like I said, the first few -- or not the first few -- Well, originally, didn't they do the first six episodes, I think?

126
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, they did the first few episodes.

127
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,264
Speaker 0: Oh, IndieWire.

128
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:50,540
Speaker 1: IndieWire changed their policy because they realized that they can't review a show just based on -- let's see.

129
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,120
Speaker 1: And they used to always watch the first six episodes.

130
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,700
Speaker 1: They shifted to watching an entire season before they said anything.

131
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:05,294
Speaker 0: That seems good because, like I said, if you review it based on the merit of the first half of Season 1, you'll be like, "Yeah, this is funny.

132
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:05,576
Speaker 0: This is

133
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:05,838
Speaker 0: okay.".

134
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,620
Speaker 1: It's about as funny as the first few episodes of Venture Brothers if I had to compare it to something.

135
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,259
Speaker 0: But Venture Brothers is another one.

136
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:28,199
Speaker 0: I almost feel like a lot of these animated shows that are targeted at adults, they tend to have the problem where they start out and they go for the low-hanging fruit of shock value because Americans -- Ah, that horse had sex.

137
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:32,054
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's like -- or Adventure Brothers.

138
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:34,958
Speaker 1: Oh, haha, it's -- Brock totally murdered that guy.

139
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the sex and violence.

140
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,340
Speaker 0: It's the crude humor.

141
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:46,260
Speaker 0: And part of it is because it's the taboo of using what is viewed as a children's medium for these adult jokes.

142
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:54,300
Speaker 1: But both those shows -- and the reason I keep comparing it to Venture Brothers, too, is that Venture Brothers is specifically stated by the creators as being a show about failure.

143
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:58,078
Speaker 0: Maybe that's where I got that from, and I was thinking, "Yeah, BoJack is a show about

144
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:58,380
Speaker 0: failure.".

145
00:08:58,481 --> 00:09:01,459
Speaker 0: And then I'm like, "You said the same exact thing about the Venture Brothers, didn't

146
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:01,540
Speaker 0: you?".

147
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:08,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the creators of the Venture Brothers themselves said that was the overarching milieu of the show, is that these people are failures.

148
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:14,880
Speaker 0: You know, in some ways, I kind of feel like there are certain parallels between them.

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,240
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, washed-up has-been kind of thing.

150
00:09:18,781 --> 00:09:21,500
Speaker 0: And I mean, they're using very different genres.

151
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:30,120
Speaker 0: One is like, you know, the behind-the-scenes of a celebrity, and the other one is like parroting superhero genre.

152
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,163
Speaker 0: But at the same time, Dr.

153
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:35,860
Speaker 1: Venture is the washed-up remains of basically a child actor.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,843
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

155
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:45,480
Speaker 0: The Rusty Venture stuff is actually kind of similar to BoJack, in that they both are constantly referring to this, you know, this golden age.

156
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,795
Speaker 0: These, you know, "Those were my halcyon

157
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,379
Speaker 0: days."

158
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,320
Speaker 0: You know, "I miss my glory days," that kind of thing.

159
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:56,260
Speaker 1: But then season two of BoJack in particular really took off.

160
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,180
Speaker 1: Season two, the show just found its stride and just was perfect.

161
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,859
Speaker 1: Season two was a very complete and very compelling arc.

162
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,520
Speaker 1: And there's one episode where he just gets on a boat and takes it all the way home.

163
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,012
Speaker 1: Oh, I love that.

164
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:15,100
Speaker 1: That was the hardest thing to watch in that entire series up to that point.

165
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:17,006
Speaker 1: No words.

166
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:22,479
Speaker 1: It was just him on the boat and some music playing, as you sort of processed what just happened in the show.

167
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,400
Speaker 0: So hard with BoJack, because on one hand, you're granted access to kind of how he feels.

168
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,900
Speaker 0: You know, you can see his fantasies sometimes.

169
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:38,140
Speaker 0: You actually can, to some extent, sympathize with his depression and his sadness and his self-loathing.

170
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,660
Speaker 0: And so, on one hand, you know, you feel bad for BoJack.

171
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,419
Speaker 0: The show is very good.

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,900
Speaker 0: It's almost like, you know, when you feel bad for a villain.

173
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:50,840
Speaker 0: Because in some cases, BoJack does play the villain.

174
00:10:51,122 --> 00:10:52,358
Speaker 1: He fucks people up.

175
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,340
Speaker 1: He's charming enough both to you, the viewer, who's sort of enjoying his escapades.

176
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,531
Speaker 0: And he has pathos.

177
00:10:58,612 --> 00:10:59,380
Speaker 0: He's pathetic.

178
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,300
Speaker 1: But to the characters around him, too, he's charming enough to where people overlook it.

179
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,359
Speaker 1: What does Wanda say?

180
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:07,937
Speaker 1: "If you're wearing rose-colored glasses, red flags just look like

181
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:08,359
Speaker 1: flags.".

182
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:13,020
Speaker 1: But, so, you see, like, you kind of enjoy watching this.

183
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,800
Speaker 1: And at the same time, you kind of forget that he's gonna ruin it.

184
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,760
Speaker 1: He's gonna draw you in, and then he's gonna disappoint you.

185
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,739
Speaker 1: And this happens over and over and over again.

186
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:25,620
Speaker 1: To the point to where you almost dread watching him interact with anyone by the third season.

187
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,980
Speaker 0: Well, like, you look at Princess Carolyn, right?

188
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,460
Speaker 0: And this is really emblematic of their relationship.

189
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,200
Speaker 0: In that, she's somebody, she's very capable, and she likes to fix problems.

190
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:37,920
Speaker 0: She views herself as a problem solver.

191
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:43,859
Speaker 0: And here's Bojack, who, you know, is very appealing to her and seems to need her.

192
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,760
Speaker 0: And yet, you know, despite all her sympathies, time and time again, he just takes and takes and takes.

193
00:11:52,341 --> 00:12:01,460
Speaker 0: And, you know, it gets to the point where it's just like, you can understand why these characters keep giving him the benefit of the doubt and keep helping him.

194
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:06,140
Speaker 0: But there comes a point where it's like, you know, he's just gonna do it again.

195
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:07,287
Speaker 0: He's gonna break your heart.

196
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,239
Speaker 0: He's gonna screw you over, you know?

197
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,099
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna be real, like, watching this show.

198
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,825
Speaker 0: And he does it for selfish reasons.

199
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,889
Speaker 0: He's not malicious.

200
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,880
Speaker 0: He's just incredibly, incredibly selfish and damaged.

201
00:12:17,281 --> 00:12:22,940
Speaker 1: It would be difficult to watch this show, and I don't even know if I'd enjoy it that much, if it were just human actors doing this.

202
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,940
Speaker 1: Sort of the fact that it's these animals and people in this sort of weird contrived world with its own rules that are very self-consistent, but the rules are there.

203
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,452
Speaker 0: Like that chicken episode?

204
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,259
Speaker 1: That was so fucked up.

205
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, the show goes into dark places with everyone.

206
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,218
Speaker 0: How do people eat meat in this world where there are animals and...

207
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,780
Speaker 1: And the answer in that episode is they eat meat, and that's a big problem.

208
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,080
Speaker 0: And we leave it at that.

209
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,858
Speaker 0: The chickens run in the chicken farms, and so it's like, what?

210
00:12:49,241 --> 00:12:50,840
Speaker 1: Sea World's not a great place either.

211
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,098
Speaker 0: Oh, is Sea World with the stripper orcas and stuff?

212
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:55,759
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, it's educational for the kids.

213
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:08,320
Speaker 1: But this show, it's almost like how soda, like soda pop, pop in the Midwest, it's extremely acidic to counterbalance the sugar, and both that acidity or sugar by themselves would be off-putting.

214
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,499
Speaker 1: This show, without that sort of punny, wink-and-a-nod backdrop to everything, would just be too depressing to watch.

215
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,520
Speaker 1: But it's even more insidious than that.

216
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:27,335
Speaker 1: I think because the show has the animal people and the light-hearted and weird stuff going on in the background, just random things about the...

217
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:29,736
Speaker 0: Like, "Haha, he's a mouse, he's a

218
00:13:29,796 --> 00:13:30,099
Speaker 0: cat.".

219
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,022
Speaker 1: Or like the dog who keeps trying to fetch the keys, or Mr.

220
00:13:34,102 --> 00:13:35,972
Speaker 1: Peanut Butter just going to the Labrador Peninsula.

221
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:38,826
Speaker 0: Well, Mr.

222
00:13:38,887 --> 00:13:40,420
Speaker 0: Peanut Butter, I love him.

223
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,140
Speaker 0: He's the cinnamon roll of the show.

224
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,140
Speaker 0: He's dumb as a brick.

225
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,760
Speaker 1: Just when he runs around in the circle before he gets in his bed.

226
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:54,720
Speaker 0: He goes, he circles, and it's basically like, because there's the animal puns, it gives it a lot of slight comic relief.

227
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:01,920
Speaker 1: But if it didn't have that constant low-level humor and absurdity, this would be way too hard to watch.

228
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:09,640
Speaker 1: It draws you in, and it makes you almost forget what kind of show it is, and then something horrible happens in the last minute of an episode.

229
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:19,900
Speaker 0: And it's kind of weird because I feel like you're able to sympathize with Bojack more because he's a horse than if he was a live-action 50-year-old man.

230
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,955
Speaker 0: You just look at that 50-year-old man and be like, "Ugh, I hate you.

231
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:24,638
Speaker 0: You're so

232
00:14:24,859 --> 00:14:25,100
Speaker 0: awful.".

233
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,178
Speaker 0: And you do that for Bojack a little bit, but you're like, "But he's a

234
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 0: horse.".

235
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,319
Speaker 0: You know, a horsey.

236
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,579
Speaker 0: And then you're thinking, "Oh, pathetic horsey, and I feel bad for-- Oh, that pathetic horsey just--".

237
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:38,649
Speaker 0: Aww.

238
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:57,479
Speaker 0: But I think some of it is very inside jokey about, like I said, the politics of film and stuff and goes into a lot of agencies and that puff, puff, puff, go, go, go aspect.

239
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:09,820
Speaker 1: And the third season sort of spreads beyond just mostly lampooning celebrity and Hollywood and also just lampooning stuff in the news, or also just being very kind of social commentary series.

240
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was surprised.

241
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:27,199
Speaker 1: There's an episode in season three where a character gets an abortion, and it's probably the first time I've seen a mainstream television show in American history where the topic comes up, and not really spoilers, but the person who wanted an abortion just gets one and it just happens right away.

242
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,780
Speaker 1: She goes to the clinic and it happens, and that's it.

243
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:38,640
Speaker 1: And she's back home watching TV, and they treat it a lot more sort of normally, as opposed to making it a gigantic plot point.

244
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:50,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, it wasn't like this huge-- I mean, there was angst surrounding it, but it was more like personal relationship angst, the kind that had been back and forth throughout the entire show.

245
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:59,000
Speaker 0: And it was a very meta episode, too, because it was like there was this whole subplot about this pop star who was faking-- Awkwafina.

246
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, 16 Awkwafina.

247
00:16:02,201 --> 00:16:06,377
Speaker 0: And so it was very like, "Ugh, this is so tasteless.

248
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:07,140
Speaker 0: This is hum--".

249
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:15,480
Speaker 0: And then they actually kind of were like, "Sometimes we use humor to help us deal with these things,".

250
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,619
Speaker 0: and then it's kind of like making commentary on the episode itself.

251
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,600
Speaker 1: So it was like-- Well, they bring it back around to that.

252
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:30,340
Speaker 0: It was like the subplot within the episode was kind of like a parallel to the episode.

253
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:53,194
Speaker 1: Well, it's also just the fact that that particular thing-- Abortions are almost always used in media, if they're even used at all, either to have a big conflict where someone wants to keep the baby and the other partner doesn't, and that's the big drama, or the person deciding not to do it, or this giant story of someone deciding to do it, but then consequences, and it'll always be an arc.

254
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,760
Speaker 1: It'll never be a beat in an episode.

255
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:16,239
Speaker 0: There was one episode, and I'm pretty sure based on the content of the episode, that was exactly their intent, is they wanted to take some of the stigma away, partly through humor, but also partly just to be very realistic about it.

256
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:18,160
Speaker 1: I guess that's the strength of season two.

257
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,440
Speaker 1: Season two has several long arcs that come to a conclusion.

258
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:37,139
Speaker 1: Season three is actually almost like a-- It's more like the episodic nature of older shows or sitcoms that it might be lampooning, in that the plot and the story moves very quickly, like this Oscars thing comes up, and before you know it, it's over.

259
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,160
Speaker 1: It's dealt with, and that pushes other things on.

260
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:47,320
Speaker 1: Every story that a normal show would draw out a lot longer gets resolved, or at least ends, way quicker than you expect.

261
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:48,839
Speaker 1: Always sad.

262
00:17:49,643 --> 00:17:52,080
Speaker 0: Is this show going to have another season?

263
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,899
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

264
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,920
Speaker 1: On Polkadot and Wikipedia, there are three seasons and 37 episodes to date.

265
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,359
Speaker 1: Yep, fourth season is coming next summer.

266
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Speaker 1: Bojack's probably not dead at the end of season three.

267
00:18:07,346 --> 00:18:12,659
Speaker 0: I hope that the fourth season is the last season, because I don't know how long this could go on.

268
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:16,480
Speaker 1: This can't go on without either him killing himself or someone else killing him.

269
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:23,618
Speaker 0: It either has to have some sort of redemption aspect to it, or it just like--.

270
00:18:24,741 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 0: I don't know if he could do that, though, because he's had a few chances.

271
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,444
Speaker 1: A few?

272
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:31,560
Speaker 1: He's had nothing but chances in this show.

273
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,160
Speaker 0: He has chances, but he doesn't recognize them as much.

274
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,298
Speaker 1: I remember season two with the jogger who runs by when he's trying to jog, and he has life together, and the guy's like, "It's hard, but you just got to keep doing it every

275
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:40,539
Speaker 1: day.".

276
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:41,840
Speaker 0: I love that scene.

277
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:55,440
Speaker 0: That's the kind of scene that I like about this show, where it will be crass one moment, and then the next moment, this kind of dark humor, crassness, and then it will have something very poignant.

278
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,339
Speaker 0: I always like when shows do that.

279
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:08,679
Speaker 0: It's like the one-two punch of they smack you upside the head with something pretty sick, and then they give you a little tear in your eye.

280
00:19:10,203 --> 00:19:28,960
Speaker 1: And season three in general, because these episodes are a little more self-contained, they're all very different, like the one where you have the two competing agencies together, and it's almost like showing the story in a typical inspirational movie, where everything works out, and we saved Christmas.

281
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,340
Speaker 0: Everybody loves a happy ending.

282
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,820
Speaker 1: But it sort of shows it to you from the perspective of the villains who lose in a movie like that.

283
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:46,080
Speaker 0: Well, it's the antagonists win, but at the same time, the antagonists are equally as morally bankrupt as the main characters.

284
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,100
Speaker 0: They're no better or worse than the people you're usually working with.

285
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,100
Speaker 1: They are at that point actually a lot better.

286
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:52,440
Speaker 0: They're kind of the good guys.

287
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,780
Speaker 0: They're getting their lives together.

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,680
Speaker 0: They're just trying to do their jobs and make movies and stuff.

289
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,020
Speaker 0: So a little bit of a tangent.

290
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,039
Speaker 0: Who's your favorite character, do you think?

291
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,899
Speaker 1: Well, Wanda's kind of a minor character.

292
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,759
Speaker 1: Wanda was perfectly likable, and that's why she got the hell out of that.

293
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:10,820
Speaker 0: She was a bit character, and she was a sweet person.

294
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:13,340
Speaker 1: But I guess she's very emblematic of the character.

295
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:21,299
Speaker 1: It seems like her character was there almost to make you fully understand how corrupting Bojack is.

296
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, to kind of provide a contrast and to be like, "Okay, here's your...".

297
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:26,600
Speaker 0: Again, with the chances.

298
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,180
Speaker 0: He had this chance.

299
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:45,020
Speaker 0: This is somebody who lived in the past, basically, and thought he was great and perfect, and it was like he could forget his slump ever happened, but he still managed to squander this opportunity.

300
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:49,000
Speaker 0: But I think Princess Carolyn is my favorite character.

301
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:55,680
Speaker 1: She's definitely the strongest of the characters, in terms of she's actually a strong person as a character.

302
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:58,400
Speaker 0: She's good because she's not perfect.

303
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,380
Speaker 0: It's not like, "Oh, this one's a cinnamon roll.

304
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:00,948
Speaker 0: This one's

305
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:01,416
Speaker 0: terrible.".

306
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:03,860
Speaker 0: Princess Carolyn does a lot of bad stuff.

307
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,240
Speaker 0: She's like the fast-talking hustling agent.

308
00:21:09,962 --> 00:21:20,516
Speaker 0: But I really like her because she's one of those people who's... She's good at her job, and she's trying to do the right thing, and you're like, "Yeah, Princess Carolyn's pretty

309
00:21:20,556 --> 00:21:20,717
Speaker 0: cool.".

310
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,262
Speaker 1: Yup.

311
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,511
Speaker 1: In terms of, I don't know, I enjoy whenever Mr.

312
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:25,620
Speaker 1: Peanutbutter's on screen.

313
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,736
Speaker 0: It's just so... You love Mr.

314
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:29,240
Speaker 0: Peanutbutter.

315
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,685
Speaker 0: You're like,

316
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:30,332
Speaker 0: "Oh.".

317
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,955
Speaker 0: But he's perfect golden retriever.

318
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:34,940
Speaker 0: He's dumb.

319
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,279
Speaker 0: He's so dumb and so good.

320
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,719
Speaker 1: Yup, he's a good boy.

321
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,920
Speaker 0: He's like everything.

322
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:48,980
Speaker 0: His initial purpose in the show, even from the get-go, it's obvious that he's good version Bojack.

323
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:53,479
Speaker 0: It's like another sitcom actor who's just like...

324
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:57,460
Speaker 1: He's not as rich, he's not as famous, but he sort of just keeps living his life.

325
00:21:57,763 --> 00:22:07,220
Speaker 0: He's pure as the driven snow, and always wants to help people, and when he screws up, it's with the best intentions.

326
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:09,773
Speaker 0: And with Mr.

327
00:22:09,814 --> 00:22:27,020
Speaker 0: Peanutbutter, it's basically like he doesn't even want these opportunities, and they just kind of come to him, and then he'll fail, and then he'll just let it roll right off his back, whereas if Bojack succeeds, he manages to treat it like failure.

328
00:22:27,242 --> 00:22:27,504
Speaker 0: Mr.

329
00:22:27,524 --> 00:22:32,979
Speaker 0: Peanutbutter treats failure like, "Oh, well, I guess my house is full of spaghetti strainers

330
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:33,220
Speaker 0: now.".

331
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:40,640
Speaker 1: But he has issues, too, and I like how they put him and Diane together and make just a very complex relationship story.

332
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:46,300
Speaker 1: that sort of breaks outside of almost all of these stereotypes of those kinds of arcs in television.

333
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:50,577
Speaker 0: It's nice, because as of season three, they haven't broken up.

334
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,300
Speaker 0: You know, they're still together.

335
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,400
Speaker 0: I mean, that's not a major spoiler, though.

336
00:22:54,501 --> 00:23:00,880
Speaker 0: It's like they have a long-term relationship, and it's not perfect, and it has a lot of conflict.

337
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,540
Speaker 1: But it's a very strong contrast to all the other characters around them in that while their relationship is often very dysfunctional...

338
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:08,094
Speaker 0: It's very flawed.

339
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:17,380
Speaker 1: ...they both work toward it, and that's shown very directly while all the other characters work actively against or work very differently.

340
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:17,990
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,980
Speaker 0: So I think a lot of the characters in that show are about providing contrast.

342
00:23:24,661 --> 00:23:29,879
Speaker 0: And I kind of feel like Diane hasn't been around as much as she was in the first season.

343
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,340
Speaker 0: I feel like the first season really focused on her and Bojack.

344
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:40,600
Speaker 0: Those were the two main characters, and it was the contrast between Bojack and his ghost writer.

345
00:23:41,581 --> 00:23:49,439
Speaker 0: And I feel like Diane's kind of taken a little bit of the backseat while Bojack interacts with all these other people in his life, or animals, as it were.

346
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:53,940
Speaker 0: I still don't understand why Princess Carolyn is pink.

347
00:23:55,121 --> 00:23:58,737
Speaker 0: Of all the things to be hung up on, I'm like, "Why is she

348
00:23:58,817 --> 00:23:59,058
Speaker 0: pink?".

349
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,767
Speaker 0: I don't know.

350
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:02,960
Speaker 1: I guess it just works, because her name's Princess.

351
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,563
Speaker 1: I mean, Mr.

352
00:24:03,604 --> 00:24:05,520
Speaker 1: Peanutbutter's first name is Mister.

353
00:24:06,502 --> 00:24:10,640
Speaker 0: And Captain Peanutbutter is his brother in the Labrador Peninsula.

354
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:22,020
Speaker 1: But just this show is super good, and especially after the first six or seven episodes, super nuanced, just really well constructed.

355
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:28,160
Speaker 1: Everything about television and the production and the voice acting and everything is just basically great.

356
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,840
Speaker 1: I can't make any complaints about the show other than that it's really depressing.

357
00:24:33,564 --> 00:24:34,800
Speaker 0: The voice talent's pretty good.

358
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,599
Speaker 0: I mean, Amy Sedaris is Princess Carolyn, right?

359
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:45,539
Speaker 0: And the voice acting, like a lot of these shows targeted at adults, I think the animation's not all that great.

360
00:24:46,442 --> 00:24:47,595
Speaker 0: It serves its purpose.

361
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:53,154
Speaker 0: And you can kind of see it's an animated show.

362
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,260
Speaker 0: that's not about the animation.

363
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:03,919
Speaker 0: It's animated so it can have that animal aspect to it and kind of distance you from the characters a little bit.

364
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:12,759
Speaker 0: But usually with this kind of show, it's the acting that really shines, and I feel like it's that case in this show, too.

365
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,330
Speaker 1: But yeah, I hope season four, maybe they could stretch it to five, but the show can't go on forever.

366
00:25:19,015 --> 00:25:19,740
Speaker 1: It has to end.

367
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,580
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want it to go on forever.

368
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:35,460
Speaker 0: And it doesn't have to end necessarily with anything super dramatic, but I don't know how long I can watch a show with this much sadness in it.

369
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,780
Speaker 0: It's not like I cry out loud sobbing kind of sadness.

370
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:43,420
Speaker 0: It's just like this is kind of soul destroying.

371
00:25:44,361 --> 00:25:55,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's just very real, and it's almost, like I said, because of the animal people and those other things, it pulls you lower before you really realize how bad it is or what's actually going on in a lot of these episodes.

372
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,780
Speaker 0: So who would you recommend BoJack to?

373
00:25:59,782 --> 00:26:03,160
Speaker 1: Anyone who likes dramatic television, honestly.

374
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:06,680
Speaker 1: Pretty much anyone who likes good television.

375
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,540
Speaker 1: This show is like A-game television.

376
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:15,140
Speaker 0: I feel like you've got to have a certain amount of appreciation for black comedy, and you've got to be in a certain kind of mood.

377
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:20,540
Speaker 0: If you're feeling crummy about your day, just watch My Little Pony or something like that.

378
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you watched Rick and Morty and you liked it when it was funny, but didn't like it when it was serious, BoJack is nothing but that serious part.

379
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

380
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,860
Speaker 0: It's like the serious parts of Rick and Morty.

381
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,579
Speaker 0: And actually it's weird because I'm feeling a lot of parallels there too.

382
00:26:37,381 --> 00:26:38,524
Speaker 0: Think about Rick.

383
00:26:38,544 --> 00:26:47,396
Speaker 0: He's this fucked up person who kind of messes with other people's life, and you're like, "What is your deal,

384
00:26:47,457 --> 00:26:47,639
Speaker 0: man?".

385
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,460
Speaker 1: Except he hides everything inside.

386
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,938
Speaker 1: Bottles of Love never shows vulnerability, except when he's alone, ever.

387
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:59,820
Speaker 0: Whereas BoJack's just bleeding his vulnerability and his tragedy all over everything.

388
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:09,700
Speaker 1: But I guess the end of season three hits this rock bottom, which is definitely the theme of season three is where is rock bottom?

389
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:13,740
Speaker 0: This was even brought up in the script.

390
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:18,500
Speaker 0: There's a slug at an AA meeting talking about being under a rock.

391
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,359
Speaker 1: Oh, you know who voiced Captain Peanutbutter?

392
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:20,748
Speaker 1: Who?

393
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,719
Speaker 1: That was Weird Al.

394
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:22,623
Speaker 1: No shit.

395
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:26,019
Speaker 0: That's funny because it was a serious thing.

396
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,219
Speaker 0: Weird Al, I feel like lately he's been doing a lot of cameos and animated stuff.

397
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:32,510
Speaker 0: Yeah.

398
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,600
Speaker 1: That's cool.

399
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:39,758
Speaker 1: But I guess season four is either going to be the rebound in the redemption story, or it's just going to be the end.

400
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:43,800
Speaker 1: I don't expect this show to have a happy ending.

401
00:27:45,389 --> 00:27:46,240
Speaker 1: I don't know if it can.

402
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,060
Speaker 1: I don't know if it would work if it had a happy ending.

403
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:57,260
Speaker 1: I don't know if that typical story of, but then they realize they hit rock bottom, and they clean up, and they fix themselves, and they want to change.

404
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,720
Speaker 0: You know what I want out of the show?

405
00:27:59,642 --> 00:28:03,100
Speaker 0: What I want out of the show is a bittersweet ending.

406
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:07,140
Speaker 0: I want things to get better, but I don't want them to be fixed.

407
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:21,620
Speaker 0: My favorite thing in fiction is when a bad guy realizes that they are a bad guy, and they have a certain amount of self-awareness.

408
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,471
Speaker 0: I think that's what it is.

409
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:33,559
Speaker 0: It's like if there's some sort of breakthrough, but it doesn't magically fix everything, just a little bit better, like livable better.

410
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:41,739
Speaker 1: I guess I still expect every other character to have dealt with their issues and basically be on this trajectory away from him.

411
00:28:42,185 --> 00:28:42,436
Speaker 0: Yeah.

412
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,799
Speaker 1: And I just don't know if he's going to be dead or alone or what at the end of all that.

413
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,304
Speaker 0: Who knows?

414
00:28:48,726 --> 00:28:50,820
Speaker 0: Well, I like the show anyway.

415
00:28:51,323 --> 00:28:52,174
Speaker 1: I like the show a lot.

416
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:02,760
Speaker 1: It's not like House of Cards, where I pretty much, as soon as I finish an episode, I have to watch the next one immediately, because I've just got to follow this plot thread.

417
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:11,340
Speaker 1: These episodes, as much as I would if I had free time, marathon the show faster, every episode actually ends on a really good dramatic stopping point.

418
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:11,536
Speaker 1: Yeah.

419
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,959
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty comfortable just watching one episode every night or so.

420
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:22,219
Speaker 0: Like I said, the episodes end very well, but sometimes they're a little cliffhanger-y, but not intense cliffhanger-y.

421
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,910
Speaker 0: They're kind of like, "And then

422
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,192
Speaker 0: what?"

423
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:25,360
Speaker 0: kind of feeling.

424
00:29:25,982 --> 00:29:30,073
Speaker 0: But usually, they hit a good emotional note to end with.

425
00:29:33,783 --> 00:29:35,119
Speaker 1: And I guess don't take it from us, too.

426
00:29:35,621 --> 00:29:40,760
Speaker 1: The critics pretty much overwhelmingly have high praise for this show.

427
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:49,200
Speaker 1: If you have complaints about the low brownness or bad quality of television, this is near the top of what you're going to get these days.

428
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:56,859
Speaker 0: The dream is not written to be completely biased against the suicide squad, and they like the Ghostbusters.

429
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,083
Speaker 1: What about Scott?

430
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,360
Speaker 1: Scott won't watch anything lately, except anime.

431
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:06,820
Speaker 0: Well, that's why we're doing Rimmelhauge reviews, because we tend to watch things together because we live together.

432
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:13,640
Speaker 0: And back at The Geek House, you guys live together, so there was a lot more to choose from in terms of things you both have seen.

433
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,060
Speaker 1: So if you subscribe to the Patreon, we do a bunch of these Rimmelhauge reviews of just little ones, of shows that Scott just didn't watch.

434
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,899
Speaker 0: Little 20-minute bits.

435
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,260
Speaker 1: We'll be doing more of those in the near future.

436
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:25,407
Speaker 1: But that anime erased.

437
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:27,220
Speaker 1: We did a full review and a full final thoughts.

438
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:32,538
Speaker 1: We'll probably do a full final thoughts of BoJack once season 4 ends, assuming that's the end.

439
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:34,539
Speaker 0: That's going to be a while, though.

440
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:36,558
Speaker 1: Next summer, about a year from now.

441
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:39,159
Speaker 0: But very good.

442
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:47,640
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rimmelhauge and Scott.

443
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,760
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

444
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,140
Speaker 1: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

445
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,080
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

446
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,738
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

448
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,600
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

449
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,780
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

450
00:31:31,400 --> 00:32:13,820
Speaker 1: The Patrons for this episode, in order of the amount of money they give us on a continuing basis, the numbers they give us at least $5 a month are... I am actively editing the video of Atari Game Design.

451
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,840
Speaker 1: I'll try to have that up soon.

452
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,040
Speaker 1: We also will probably have some tidbits of what's going to be in our panel at PAX West.

453
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,387
Speaker 1: We've been working on that.

454
00:32:21,428 --> 00:32:22,419
Speaker 1: The slides are looking pretty good.

455
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:32,440
Speaker 1: We've got to cut two hours worth of lecture down to one hour, so maybe I'll share some of the slides and some of the things we're going to talk about after I make some of the charts and graphs that we're using.

456
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:37,100
Speaker 1: And yeah, now I'll leave you with something strange.

457
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,400
Speaker 0: No dragons.
