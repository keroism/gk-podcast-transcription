1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,531
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday December 23rd 2020.

2
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:12,576
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,058 --> 00:00:15,369
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:23,812
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about the last decade in animation and comics 2010 to 2020.

5
00:00:23,812 --> 00:00:24,848
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:33,010
Speaker 1: So, uh, I figured cuz I'm stuck inside I wanted to put up some fairy lights some Christmas lights to out of the balcony.

7
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,180
Speaker 1: Normally, I don't even bother with that kind of thing.

8
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,533
Speaker 1: Like there's enough Christmas going on around me, but I'm stuck inside.

9
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:42,264
Speaker 0: We had a can even see your lights here in the back and facing nothing.

10
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,010
Speaker 1: What a million people see it.

11
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,114
Speaker 1: There's a giant muse.

12
00:00:45,134 --> 00:00:48,990
Speaker 1: There's like four or five hundred apartments that all have balconies face.

13
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,449
Speaker 0: You're just showing it to the other building and I showing it to like the street.

14
00:00:53,032 --> 00:00:56,105
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm showing it to all the other people who have apartments in this whole complex.

15
00:00:56,707 --> 00:00:57,269
Speaker 1: Yeah to myself.

16
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,482
Speaker 0: No, no one on the street can see it.

17
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:00,850
Speaker 0: only people in this like.

18
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,181
Speaker 1: I didn't want an apartment facing the street.

19
00:01:03,201 --> 00:01:04,247
Speaker 1: There's cars honking out there.

20
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:13,889
Speaker 0: I'm just saying like you're showing it to a very small number of people like Several hundred apartments full of people plus for it's for me.

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,575
Speaker 1: It's for me and Emily to look at like I see the lights when I wake up in the morning And they're out there.

22
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:18,382
Speaker 0: you should hang them on the.

23
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:19,169
Speaker 0: if you wanted there for you.

24
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:25,717
Speaker 0: You should hang them on the other building But you could see them.

25
00:01:25,938 --> 00:01:29,052
Speaker 0: it would be better to see ones on someone else's Apartment.

26
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:31,589
Speaker 1: only one other apartment has put up lights in the whole complex.

27
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's silly to put them up on the inside part.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,883
Speaker 1: It's the why that's worse.

29
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:37,849
Speaker 1: There's more people would see him there.

30
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:42,310
Speaker 0: It's like if you had a house in a suburb and you only put your Christmas lights in the backyard.

31
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:49,650
Speaker 0: Them Neighbor in the back could see them now because where is that privacy fences?

32
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,270
Speaker 0: They could see them over the fence like this.

33
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,769
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's not like that at all because there's a huge number of apartments that all see them.

34
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:01,130
Speaker 1: Like many people have apartments facing inward not outward in this neighborhood.

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,755
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I went.

36
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,157
Speaker 1: I got some.

37
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:05,889
Speaker 1: we had some ancient ancient like regular Christmas lights like the.

38
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:16,172
Speaker 1: you know The green string with the simple plug and that one particular light bulb and I got him out looking and Half of the strand didn't light because you know They're old.

39
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:21,737
Speaker 0: and that's the thing that can happen due to the way Christmas lights are really shitty and they weren't using you know The modern ones.

40
00:02:21,777 --> 00:02:22,563
Speaker 0: I think of LEDs.

41
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:23,269
Speaker 0: so that doesn't happen.

42
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:28,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, people still apparently mostly buy non LED ones because LED works a lot cheaper.

43
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:34,860
Speaker 1: well LED ones are expensive or LED ones are dangerous.

44
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:35,729
Speaker 1: bootleg nonsense.

45
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,659
Speaker 1: What most LEDs Christmas lights you can buy are?

46
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,685
Speaker 1: The kind of thing that would be featured on big Clive for catching fire.

47
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:48,162
Speaker 1: Good lord Are they dodgy like probably illegally imported shit?

48
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:49,707
Speaker 0: It's not that hard to make one.

49
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:50,409
Speaker 0: It's yes it is.

50
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:51,796
Speaker 0: How hard could it be?

51
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:53,930
Speaker 0: I made it I made an LED menorah, it's just fine.

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,481
Speaker 1: So here's the main reason why these are a problem one.

53
00:02:56,823 --> 00:02:57,305
Speaker 1: They have to keep.

54
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,510
Speaker 1: they have to do voltage conversion.

55
00:02:58,771 --> 00:02:59,674
Speaker 1: You can't just run it.

56
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:00,015
Speaker 1: Yes.

57
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've got to put resistors on there.

58
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,897
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's not not resistors Don't convert voltage Scott.

59
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,590
Speaker 0: Oh, you need to turn it to DC first and they got it.

60
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got all.

61
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,764
Speaker 1: you need logic in there.

62
00:03:10,805 --> 00:03:11,570
Speaker 1: You need a bunch of stuff.

63
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,074
Speaker 0: There's any logic?

64
00:03:14,134 --> 00:03:16,646
Speaker 0: you just you just need a. you know, you can take DC you can actually use.

65
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:18,296
Speaker 0: if you powered it you know you could do.

66
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:19,686
Speaker 0: that would work really well.

67
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:26,307
Speaker 0: is At the end of the cable instead of having you know, a power cable.

68
00:03:26,428 --> 00:03:27,030
Speaker 0: just have a USB.

69
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:28,255
Speaker 1: They've helped.

70
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:28,759
Speaker 1: those exist.

71
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,365
Speaker 1: people sell those.

72
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:34,330
Speaker 0: they're really nice Yeah, and then you could just then that's already done for you because like you can do if you've got you're putting Christmas lights indoors.

73
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:35,835
Speaker 1: That's like the perfect way to do it.

74
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:40,469
Speaker 0: Just get USB once you can use whatever USB power you want and then have a string of LEDs.

75
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:43,590
Speaker 1: Right, just don't plug that shit into like a computer USB port.

76
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,690
Speaker 0: Are you know you plug it into like you would take like your phone charger and plug it in with that, right?

77
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:53,223
Speaker 1: so basically the problem with LED lights is that most of them are like.

78
00:03:53,384 --> 00:03:54,950
Speaker 1: UL has never seen these things before.

79
00:03:56,213 --> 00:04:06,444
Speaker 1: These things are imported dodgily And even though they often say that they are waterproof the reality is most of those LED Christmas lights are not even close to waterproof.

80
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,893
Speaker 1: because well, the lights are all waterproof at the Cape.

81
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:16,488
Speaker 1: the cable that plugs into the wall will have some sort of transformer in it and then a box that has the circuitry to do things like change the colors and stuff.

82
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:24,010
Speaker 1: and Those things aren't waterproof at all like they're dodgy and not safe for outdoor usage.

83
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,401
Speaker 1: And if you want ones that actually do work nicely outdoors and are safe.

84
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:29,086
Speaker 1: They're like 40 bucks a strand.

85
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,296
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's not you know, the like.

86
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:37,190
Speaker 0: I know people like to light their pools with LEDs, right and was like underneath the pool.

87
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,358
Speaker 0: They'll be like little domes with LEDs under them.

88
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,469
Speaker 0: It's like that shit ain't cheap at pools expensive enough already.

89
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,115
Speaker 1: So basically I did.

90
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:45,718
Speaker 1: I got one.

91
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:49,913
Speaker 1: I got the smallest strand of lights I could to put up out there and They could.

92
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:57,827
Speaker 1: they were expensive because I got ones that are actually waterproof Actually designed for outdoors had a UL logo on them that didn't look like it was bootlegged.

93
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:00,830
Speaker 1: Yeah And they'll probably last the rest of my life.

94
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,274
Speaker 1: They're using like no power.

95
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:09,069
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of amazing how little power they use compared to even half a strand of traditional lights.

96
00:05:10,111 --> 00:05:12,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh yeah, cuz they're LEDs right exactly.

97
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,604
Speaker 1: they're also wicked bright and have way more colors.

98
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,129
Speaker 1: cuz they're just aren't you can.

99
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,441
Speaker 1: I can Light individually to do whatever color I want it to be.

100
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:22,210
Speaker 0: I said my LED menorah.

101
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,809
Speaker 0: I can do any color I want and any light with any kind of pattern they could change while it's on.

102
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can have it cycle and rotate and do all kinds of stuff.

103
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,090
Speaker 0: So it's that those actually really good.

104
00:05:32,592 --> 00:05:37,150
Speaker 0: I think that must be what the people who are doing those like fancy displays outside are using the ones that like.

105
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,869
Speaker 1: Yes, the tricky part is you often can't get those in very long strands and they very rarely can daisy-chain like traditional lights.

106
00:05:46,473 --> 00:05:53,440
Speaker 1: So a lot of the fancy ones outside are still traditional Regular old light bulbs like incandescents because they're just at that scale.

107
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:54,402
Speaker 1: that's easier.

108
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:57,330
Speaker 1: The consequence is they use way more power.

109
00:05:58,153 --> 00:06:02,390
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know you see like people make like, you know LED video walls, right?

110
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,263
Speaker 0: Screen I've made out of a bazillion LEDs and a grid but you're just.

111
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:09,958
Speaker 0: it's so big and you're so far away that it looks Really great.

112
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:12,713
Speaker 0: Yeah So you can use.

113
00:06:12,753 --> 00:06:18,010
Speaker 0: you can set up something like that and just imagine that same sort of video Tron setup, right?

114
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:32,830
Speaker 0: Except instead of you know being in a rectangle you just split up the LEDs all over the place In front of a house right down the street on the side of the driveway up In Santa's ass wherever you got to put them, you know.

115
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,350
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's literally all that's going in my life and I don't have work this week.

116
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,965
Speaker 0: So I'm like wearing pajamas right now work of this a week or a next week.

117
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,030
Speaker 1: I got to work next week.

118
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:43,142
Speaker 1: I got a lot to do next week.

119
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:47,263
Speaker 0: actually Just you know waking up do whenever I feel like doing.

120
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:53,936
Speaker 0: I feel like after the show I'm gonna have someone deliver some food for me to eat and Maybe I'll bike to nowhere.

121
00:06:53,976 --> 00:06:56,946
Speaker 0: I biked this morning do whatever I feel like doing.

122
00:06:57,027 --> 00:06:58,050
Speaker 1: play some video games.

123
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,281
Speaker 1: Mmm talk about some of the video games.

124
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:01,684
Speaker 1: I'm playing.

125
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:04,981
Speaker 0: maybe next week I'm playing some games also.

126
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,470
Speaker 1: I guess we'll get into it.

127
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,870
Speaker 1: So just like on Monday, we're doing the show on like the decade of anime and animation everything, but there is some news.

128
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,140
Speaker 1: There's actually some extremely important news.

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,530
Speaker 1: I'll link to this verge article that goes to into it in detail.

130
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:29,320
Speaker 1: Sony who if you don't recall owns Funimation Has bought crunchyroll for 1.2 billion dollars from if you didn't know who owned crunchyroll AT&T.

131
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:42,260
Speaker 0: yeah, so You know we've talked before about antitrust and stuff and how unifying and merging and stuff is not great for you know Assuming you're already on board with capitalism or whatever right now.

132
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:47,390
Speaker 0: It's not good for a host of reasons That we but it struggle it always fight.

133
00:07:47,390 --> 00:08:04,188
Speaker 1: There's this competing like this duality of interest in that on one hand We need to break up monopolies to make sure there's competition and a free market and to make sure that no company gets too powerful And starts to have undue influence, but on the other hand as a consumer I only want to go to one web page to do a particular kind of thing.

134
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,081
Speaker 0: yep That's a constant struggle is?

135
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,553
Speaker 0: I only want to go to see Some things.

136
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:12,728
Speaker 1: I never even work with epic store because I didn't want to have two things on my desk.

137
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:12,929
Speaker 1: right.

138
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:21,434
Speaker 0: there are some things in the world that benefit from Unification of there being only one thing and there are some things that benefit from having Choices.

139
00:08:21,454 --> 00:08:28,813
Speaker 0: in this case society loses but user experience wins and it's hard to get the best of both worlds unless you For you have.

140
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,623
Speaker 0: the capitalism will never give you the best of both worlds.

141
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:38,740
Speaker 0: the only way to get the best of both worlds is To force it either by saying Here's an open standard that everyone must follow.

142
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,885
Speaker 0: period so like say for instant messaging.

143
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:41,427
Speaker 0: right you could be like.

144
00:08:41,528 --> 00:08:48,874
Speaker 0: everyone must use this Xmpp even though Xmpp is not great just using this example and then choose whatever Thing you want.

145
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:53,630
Speaker 0: so in web browsers right it's like okay, you know choose whatever web browser you want.

146
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,261
Speaker 0: Here's how HTTP works yep, but then the other thing.

147
00:08:57,281 --> 00:09:00,110
Speaker 1: messaging used to be that way, but it's all proprietary again.

148
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,869
Speaker 0: Yep, the other thing you can do is you can say okay?

149
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,541
Speaker 0: There's only one thing, but it has to follow all these rules.

150
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:08,842
Speaker 0: right.

151
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,386
Speaker 0: there's one telephone system.

152
00:09:10,446 --> 00:09:13,575
Speaker 0: It must work this way You know you can't.

153
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,223
Speaker 0: you have to provide service to everyone.

154
00:09:15,243 --> 00:09:16,730
Speaker 0: right here's how the numbers work.

155
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,249
Speaker 0: No deviating right it's not her etc.

156
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,100
Speaker 0: So you know that's how it goes.

157
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,090
Speaker 0: so but that his thing with the anime situation.

158
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:29,384
Speaker 0: It's like okay You don't want to have to get 10 subscriptions to be able to legally watch all the anime.

159
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:29,726
Speaker 0: because I've.

160
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:34,206
Speaker 1: but the weird thing is My like crunchyroll because it has a lot of the stuff that people don't talk about that.

161
00:09:34,346 --> 00:09:40,785
Speaker 0: I want to watch Yes, but like how many times have we done a geek nights episode on some tiny show?

162
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,310
Speaker 0: that's got like short episodes?

163
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:50,610
Speaker 0: Or is a really weird thing like yummy Yeah clothes Key clothes any of these kind of things?

164
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,798
Speaker 0: It's like the Netflix ain't doing those right.

165
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:58,188
Speaker 0: funimation ain't doing those as to my knowledge right crunchyroll was like specializing in.

166
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,152
Speaker 0: so you know Bananya.

167
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:00,693
Speaker 0: right.

168
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:06,230
Speaker 0: it's like without crunchyroll you would not have no bananya right in the u.s.. It's so tiny.

169
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:13,409
Speaker 1: But at the same time every time I wanted to watch a bigger anime It was either on Netflix which I paid for or funimation, which I didn't pay for

170
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:19,007
Speaker 0: Right as those other services are just into those big shows that you can get a lot of people to watch.

171
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:38,494
Speaker 0: crunchyroll As a service would go sort of that extra mile To get this long tail of the smaller anime the animes that otaku's knew about some of them quite popular right And get them subtitled fast right sometimes same day as the you know simulcast or whatever.

172
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:46,481
Speaker 0: if you cared about that which I never did right at a. And it's it's you know pretty good.

173
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,610
Speaker 0: remember a crunchyroll started as just piracy.

174
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:54,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, people forget that crunchyroll just started as a website that was blatantly pirating everything it was.

175
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,117
Speaker 1: It wasn't too far before.

176
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,169
Speaker 1: the start of this decade was when crunchyroll made that shift to be legit.

177
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,216
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

178
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:03,881
Speaker 0: and then they sold right.

179
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,990
Speaker 0: and look at these other all the manga piracy pirating websites.

180
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,221
Speaker 0: They weren't able to make that crunchyroll transition to legitimacy.

181
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:11,184
Speaker 0: or did they even try?

182
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,890
Speaker 1: I don't think they tried.

183
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:22,929
Speaker 1: I also think that sadly despite one of the news's we're going to talk about don't think there's enough money in that in the American Market, I don't know if there is either or not, but that's but anyway.

184
00:11:22,969 --> 00:11:24,759
Speaker 0: so Crunchyroll is bought.

185
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:33,429
Speaker 0: it is not yet unified But presumably this might be received is gonna be a mix of good and bad for the anime fan in the United States.

186
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:43,100
Speaker 1: on one Hand Sony now has near absolute power over the American anime industry In terms of legal anime watching in the US.

187
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,227
Speaker 0: you're gonna be having in your Netflix and your Sony.

188
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:48,136
Speaker 0: those are your two choices And I think we're gonna.

189
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:59,117
Speaker 1: what I suspect we'll see is Sony will Start to go after shows that are made by regular studios and Netflix will double down on funding their own anime to be made Via studios.

190
00:11:59,137 --> 00:11:59,780
Speaker 1: that that's what's been.

191
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,927
Speaker 0: that's been happening.

192
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,396
Speaker 0: Yeah We might see.

193
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,290
Speaker 0: I think you're gonna see unification of Funimation and crunchyroll.

194
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,292
Speaker 0: So you're not gonna have to be like ah damn the show is not on the service I want.

195
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,669
Speaker 0: you're gonna subscribe to the one service and get all the shows.

196
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:14,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and that's gonna be I guess a positive.

197
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,009
Speaker 0: who knows what the price will be though, right with their monopoly power They might be able to jack up the price on us.

198
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,576
Speaker 1: I think I was watching some anime.

199
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:21,360
Speaker 1: that's Funimation.

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,364
Speaker 1: that was also on Hulu.

201
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:23,850
Speaker 1: cuz we had a free trial of Hulu.

202
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,625
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think now there's no reason to watch Hulu at all for anything.

203
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:28,730
Speaker 0: I don't know.

204
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:31,907
Speaker 0: Well, they're not unified yet crunch your own Funimation is still separate.

205
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:36,120
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, you're also gonna be seeing I guess bad news.

206
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:45,409
Speaker 0: one company deciding right which things to bring over And you know translate and stream pretty much.

207
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:47,076
Speaker 1: So they're gonna be at that.

208
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:50,510
Speaker 1: so far in the ecosystem pretty much everything gets brought over, right?

209
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,837
Speaker 0: But well, they will.

210
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:54,090
Speaker 0: they start making different choices because there's no one else.

211
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:59,470
Speaker 0: It's not like they don't have to say Oh, no, if we don't bring this over someone else will and and steal our customers.

212
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,130
Speaker 0: They'd like our customers have to go with us.

213
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,696
Speaker 0: We have all the anime no one else has.

214
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:11,088
Speaker 0: we can just bring over just enough anime to keep them Subscribed and we don't need to bring over your you know, or do a bunch of hard work to try to.

215
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:12,113
Speaker 1: now Here's are the.

216
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:15,350
Speaker 0: you see the magic of a bananya and try to spread it, right?

217
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,010
Speaker 0: They can just be like, yeah We'll get your borutos and we're good.

218
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:33,210
Speaker 1: If we look at just animation as a global industry instead of focusing just on anime It gets a little more interesting because part of the reason AT&T Was willing to sell crunchyroll was that they're going the Netflix route and partnering with HBO max

219
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:34,313
Speaker 0: Mmm

220
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,821
Speaker 1: Which as you know is getting all of the pristine.

221
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:45,970
Speaker 1: a lot of the prestige animation Likely venture brothers the adventure time stuff like HBO max has got a lot going on as we've talked about in previous geek nights.

222
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:55,058
Speaker 1: I think the players in this space now are gonna be Sony HBO and Netflix and those will be the three.

223
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,183
Speaker 1: that's where animation is.

224
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:57,510
Speaker 0: apples trying a little bit.

225
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:00,459
Speaker 1: Apple's barely got the wolf walkers exclusive.

226
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,408
Speaker 1: it look even Apple people were complaining about the exclusive on Apple TV.

227
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean now that the thing is Apple's big thing.

228
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:13,155
Speaker 0: historically Animation wise movie wise has been their ties with Disney Pixar But this is their own thing.

229
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:17,388
Speaker 0: now that Disney has their own thing Apple has lost that and I think that's gonna.

230
00:14:17,428 --> 00:14:20,490
Speaker 0: that pretty much Really hurts Apple videos prospects.

231
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:28,387
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be super shocked if Apple over time gets out of this business and just Basically tries to take a vague from give up.

232
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,010
Speaker 0: easily.

233
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:35,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but business wise the better way to go would be to provide first-class experiences for all these other services.

234
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:44,598
Speaker 0: I do all those services have first-class like a plus Apple TV apps and they they when they're on you go to watch an Apple Keynote, they're like we got Disney Plus app.

235
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,301
Speaker 0: How great is that?

236
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:50,829
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, but Apple I wonder I don't know how widespread Apple TVs usage actually is.

237
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,484
Speaker 0: Well a bunch of people getting free trials when they get iPhones.

238
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,429
Speaker 0: I didn't activate mine.

239
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,670
Speaker 1: Yeah But I'd love to see the stats on how many people get a free trial and don't bother.

240
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:12,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, speaking of I was told by Tom Moore on Twitter director of wolf walkers that you would be able to Buy wolf walkers on iTunes like buying a movie, but apparently I looked on iTunes and it's not there.

241
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,410
Speaker 0: I think it really is Apple TV plus exclusive.

242
00:15:15,252 --> 00:15:20,846
Speaker 0: You have to have a free or non free subscription to Apple TV plus to watch it legally in the US.

243
00:15:21,348 --> 00:15:22,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a shame.

244
00:15:24,311 --> 00:15:26,056
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I think another you know.

245
00:15:26,136 --> 00:15:31,330
Speaker 0: one last thing though is in terms of going over to Japan to try to license anime.

246
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:38,673
Speaker 0: right When I think you're actually see one of the more positive sides of monopoly power is We.

247
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:42,130
Speaker 0: when it's wielded against the consumer it's bad.

248
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:52,430
Speaker 0: But when it's wielded against another company, it can sometimes be good or bad right depending on for the consumer But it's almost never good for the workers in those companies right depending on whose side you're on right?

249
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,116
Speaker 0: So like when Amazon right?

250
00:15:54,277 --> 00:15:56,085
Speaker 0: I remember here's a better example Walmart.

251
00:15:56,145 --> 00:15:57,049
Speaker 0: I remember this dude.

252
00:15:58,055 --> 00:16:00,330
Speaker 0: He taught he was a. he was a lawnmower company.

253
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,451
Speaker 0: He made lawnmowers and he made really good lawnmowers like high-quality ones Right.

254
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:10,701
Speaker 0: and Walmart wanted to buy his lawnmowers and put him on the shelf and they said hey We want you to make we don't want to buy the lawnmowers you have.

255
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,990
Speaker 0: those are too expensive and fancy for Walmart customers.

256
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,043
Speaker 0: We want you to make a shitty low-quality lawnmower that's cheaper.

257
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 0: that has your brand on it, right?

258
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,079
Speaker 0: It's a special model just for Walmart.

259
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:28,630
Speaker 0: and it's like if he says yes He becomes mega rich because suddenly Walmart right signs a check to buy all those lawnmowers from him, right?

260
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:33,450
Speaker 0: And if he says no, it's like, you know, he has his principles and he can go home, right?

261
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,070
Speaker 0: And but that's a lot of power Walmart has as being such a big company, right?

262
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,110
Speaker 0: So in the same way that you know that power can be used for good.

263
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:49,321
Speaker 0: That's why single-payer health care is a great idea because you can go to all the pharmaceutical companies and saying this is what we're gonna Pay for that drug deal with it.

264
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:49,563
Speaker 1: now.

265
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:52,896
Speaker 0: a better way to get would know Those pharmaceutical companies.

266
00:16:52,996 --> 00:17:00,207
Speaker 0: but obviously but in this case you'll have you'll have funimation crunchyroll Sony Going to Japan or I guess they are Japan.

267
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:00,670
Speaker 0: They're Sony.

268
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:09,170
Speaker 0: They're in Japan But going to the anime studios of Japan and saying you want your anime to be on computers streaming in the US legally, huh?

269
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:10,554
Speaker 0: This is what we're gonna pay.

270
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:15,069
Speaker 0: the end right as opposed to negotiating, right?

271
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:20,549
Speaker 0: They'll just set the price because it's them or yep the highway right nothing.

272
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:21,613
Speaker 1: The thing is.

273
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:28,695
Speaker 1: what's interesting is this means that the way I like the streaming servers are to use assuming crunchyroll and funimation Like merge their stuff completely.

274
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:33,970
Speaker 1: I'll basically have an account on all three places that I would ever want to watch animation.

275
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,530
Speaker 1: So I'll be covered as a consumer.

276
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:38,249
Speaker 0: We'll see.

277
00:17:39,172 --> 00:17:42,004
Speaker 0: So this isn't necessarily a news is something that's holy's.

278
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:43,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a tweet.

279
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:46,643
Speaker 0: It's something that's always true or it's been true for quite a while.

280
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:48,490
Speaker 0: We can almost put this into the main bit area.

281
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:51,190
Speaker 1: We've talked about this many times, right?

282
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,269
Speaker 0: But this you know.

283
00:17:52,351 --> 00:18:08,610
Speaker 0: But you know I actually tried to when I was trying to find the tweet that as somebody retweeted this week I actually found many tweets about this because like people trying to drive this point home because it's not in the consciousness of People who think about comic books and graphic novels in the US even though it's so true, right?

284
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,052
Speaker 0: and it's like when you think about comic books graphic novels in the US you think about You know, what's?

285
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:18,906
Speaker 0: the general consciousness is like Marvel and DC the big two right with their superheroes.

286
00:18:18,966 --> 00:18:25,130
Speaker 0: stuff right is being the top Right, even if you look at Eisner Awards, which do have plenty of non superhero things.

287
00:18:25,691 --> 00:18:29,522
Speaker 0: There's plenty of superhero things in the Eisner Awards even even now, right?

288
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:35,679
Speaker 0: It's like San Diego comic-con you go there Superheroes all over the place, right and it's like.

289
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,203
Speaker 0: that's the thing people think of.

290
00:18:37,644 --> 00:18:39,890
Speaker 0: and then under that you think of like.

291
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:47,330
Speaker 0: You know, you got your mangas and you got your indie books, you know your image your IDW your whoever's right your dark horses.

292
00:18:48,153 --> 00:18:53,330
Speaker 0: And then under that, you know, you got just other graphic novels artsy people mocha type stuff, right?

293
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,408
Speaker 0: But the fact is if you actually look at numbers, right?

294
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:04,447
Speaker 0: It's this tweet says the big two aren't Marvel and DC they're Dave Pilkey and Raina Tegelmeier, right?

295
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:12,123
Speaker 0: So Scholastic is the biggest Comic book company and yeah, but nerds won't talk about that.

296
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:13,027
Speaker 1: I mean, they're already.

297
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:13,950
Speaker 1: they won't talk about manga.

298
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,779
Speaker 1: They're definitely not gonna talk about that.

299
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,250
Speaker 0: Do you know how much like captain underpants?

300
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,975
Speaker 0: Do you know how much that sells.

301
00:19:20,477 --> 00:19:24,230
Speaker 0: the amount it sells is so ludicrous, right?

302
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:31,450
Speaker 0: It's like there are more kids reading that shit than have ever read like any spider-man ever.

303
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:33,595
Speaker 1: Next tweet in that thing.

304
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:34,517
Speaker 1: It's so.

305
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,480
Speaker 1: so on point.

306
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:35,941
Speaker 1: Jeff.

307
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:39,252
Speaker 1: Kitty has sold 200 million books since 2007.

308
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:43,209
Speaker 1: That's more than all Avengers comics have sold since their launch in.

309
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:50,606
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, and he says anyway some nerd told me I don't know much about me.

310
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:53,136
Speaker 0: comics Right, is that the?

311
00:19:53,617 --> 00:20:01,036
Speaker 0: even when they were like big right say like, you know Like Golden Age comics and Superman was a big deal, right?

312
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:08,204
Speaker 0: It's like, you know Superhero comic books even when they were great and and huge and everyone was buying them.

313
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:10,470
Speaker 0: I've never been as big.

314
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:16,910
Speaker 1: They were dwarfs by a scholastic book by some random manga worked by Disney ducks, right?

315
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,821
Speaker 0: You want to talk about sales, right?

316
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,290
Speaker 0: Let's talk about one piece, right?

317
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,445
Speaker 0: H-year Oda has sold more one piece worldwide.

318
00:20:24,465 --> 00:20:25,650
Speaker 0: Is that I don't know.

319
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:29,764
Speaker 0: Is it the best-selling book period in the history of baby other than the curse?

320
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,389
Speaker 0: I don't even know if it's.

321
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:31,992
Speaker 0: yeah It's like.

322
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:34,130
Speaker 0: I guess it's not Bible level, right?

323
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:44,932
Speaker 0: But it's like if you take all the one piece volumes combined You are getting pretty high on that list of like best-selling as of September 2019.

324
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:53,550
Speaker 1: So a little over a year ago one piece Has sold 454 million copies globally according to the statistic I found online, right?

325
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,960
Speaker 0: So Jeff Kinney has sold 200 million books since o7.

326
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,169
Speaker 0: h-year Oda has sold for two Jeff Kinney's.

327
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,427
Speaker 0: So Jeff Kinney's already bigger than every Avengers comic ever.

328
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:05,853
Speaker 0: all the issues Right.

329
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:13,127
Speaker 1: and h-year Oda is like to Jeff Kinney's Kenny is a little bit above blackjack But a little bit below detective Conan, right?

330
00:21:13,247 --> 00:21:19,589
Speaker 0: It's like Right, so when you got I think you know, the comics media is such an un.

331
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,282
Speaker 0: you know There's not a lot of money in in talking about comics.

332
00:21:23,502 --> 00:21:36,452
Speaker 0: even these, you know small low-budget Journalistic outfits that have tried to talk about, you know get into comics journalism, you know They either have to go full superhero and talk about superhero movies and all that other stuff Right.

333
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:42,529
Speaker 0: the same way a comic book store has to sell a whole bunch of other stuff Right, the comic book news has to talk about a bunch of other stuff.

334
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:49,766
Speaker 0: Or like the tiny indie ones and the comics journal It's like those things actually they.

335
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:57,109
Speaker 0: they said yeah We're gonna be a low-budget high-brow kind of thing and you know They try to keep it going and they worth it.

336
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,674
Speaker 0: Not a lot of them able to keep it going.

337
00:21:59,376 --> 00:22:04,290
Speaker 0: all the comics journalism these days is fan journalism, which is has the wrong perspective.

338
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:11,515
Speaker 0: Superhero comic books making a podcast and not kids talking about captain underpants Let's.

339
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:20,810
Speaker 1: it's more interesting that I think cuz it's fans who Often have a grudge against all the things that are more popular than their thing and try to rationalize how their thing is actually bigger.

340
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:24,749
Speaker 1: I think some of it is not unconscious bias, but conscious active bias.

341
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:28,914
Speaker 0: hmm, maybe or you know, it's just You know the the.

342
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,521
Speaker 1: I think another part of it is the American comic.

343
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:39,149
Speaker 1: like superhero comic industry does a good job of controlling What limited amount of their media gets talked about in mainstream news?

344
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,500
Speaker 0: Controlling their movies are a big thing, right?

345
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,110
Speaker 0: So the intellectual property of spider-man is enormous.

346
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:50,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, much more than cats underpants hasn't had a movie Although I don't know why he hasn't.

347
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,310
Speaker 0: cuz how much money would that thing fucking make?

348
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:58,770
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ, you'd have like everyone under the age of 10 in the whole country going to that.

349
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:07,298
Speaker 0: But it's like just the Percy how big a thing is Compared to how big it is perceived to be.

350
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,189
Speaker 1: there was a captain underpants movie in 2017 shows what I fucking know.

351
00:23:13,612 --> 00:23:21,156
Speaker 0: Was it in theaters, uh, yeah budget 38 million box-office 125 million That's that's lower than I expected.

352
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:23,524
Speaker 0: Why I still made a lot a bunch of money.

353
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:24,848
Speaker 0: I'll take hundred something million, right?

354
00:23:24,889 --> 00:23:25,210
Speaker 0: Why not?

355
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:34,135
Speaker 0: but it's like the the perception of how big things are right is based on the Media journalism.

356
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:37,606
Speaker 0: how much people talk about it how much people tweet about it, right?

357
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:38,870
Speaker 1: There's also a Netflix show.

358
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,799
Speaker 0: Okay, how big things actually are is?

359
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:50,151
Speaker 0: Unrelated to that right there are things that are relatively not that popular that get talked about a lot Right.

360
00:23:50,452 --> 00:23:59,467
Speaker 0: the people who run the big media companies the people who run television talk about things that are on television because that's where they make their money right.

361
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:04,710
Speaker 0: so that you know If you're CBS and you have golf on the news is gonna talk about golf, right?

362
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:05,812
Speaker 0: But guess what?

363
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,280
Speaker 0: If League of Legends is bigger than golf.

364
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:11,210
Speaker 0: You're not gonna feel like it's bigger than golf.

365
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, like what was that thing?

366
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:16,870
Speaker 1: more people watch the overwatch championships than watch the Super Bowl, but no one's talking about that

367
00:24:17,837 --> 00:24:37,367
Speaker 0: right exactly, so There's this mismatch and you have to be constantly aware of it because even if you block all ads everywhere always Right that consciousness of just the general you know media right will cause a mismatch in your brain of how big is a thing really?

368
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:40,662
Speaker 0: or is that Actually a not as big thing?

369
00:24:40,702 --> 00:24:41,950
Speaker 0: that's just talked about a lot.

370
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,295
Speaker 1: You know where we see this a lot right now And I think there's a lot like.

371
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:47,503
Speaker 1: a lot of toxic consequences happen as a result.

372
00:24:47,865 --> 00:24:54,920
Speaker 1: is the cosplay at conventions and the cosplay and nerdery Non like nerd inside baseball.

373
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:04,469
Speaker 1: coverage of fan conventions of all kinds Focuses almost entirely on the cosplay that's true Which you can understand why like some reporter doesn't know sent like go cover.

374
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:13,449
Speaker 1: this Convention sees a bunch of people in crazy costumes gets a whole bunch of b-roll at that and they're good They pack up and leave but not go to like the basement panel room to sit through something for an hour.

375
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,321
Speaker 0: Well, but also cosplay is kind of big right?

376
00:25:16,441 --> 00:25:16,662
Speaker 0: It is.

377
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:23,409
Speaker 1: it's big to a point play that your panel It's not like the focus of these cons that a lot of people think it is.

378
00:25:24,031 --> 00:25:27,244
Speaker 1: A lot of people have a perception that it is the primary focus of almost all these cons.

379
00:25:27,585 --> 00:25:33,679
Speaker 0: and you see a lot of people You've made a chart I've made a pie chart of like primary thing.

380
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:40,810
Speaker 0: you are here at this con for cosplay would be the biggest wedge But it would not be a wedge that is greater than 50%.

381
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:46,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what I think I've seen happen is that is at comic cons that sort of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, which fine.

382
00:25:47,151 --> 00:26:03,870
Speaker 1: But then there's other cons that don't support cosplay and cosplay people tend to have an outsized impression of how big they're like industry and like the space around them is and then they seem to Get mad and cause drama when they're at conventions that don't support them the way they expect to be supported.

383
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:14,654
Speaker 1: There's a whole thing going on there but anyway things Of the day.

384
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:15,340
Speaker 1: What do you got?

385
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,147
Speaker 0: What do I have?

386
00:26:17,228 --> 00:26:18,679
Speaker 0: so, you know the old toy?

387
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:20,487
Speaker 0: Right the chattering teeth.

388
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:23,340
Speaker 0: you wind it up and it's just a set of teeth and they start chattering like.

389
00:26:24,322 --> 00:26:27,014
Speaker 1: I think I saw that for the first time in Pee Wee's great big adventure.

390
00:26:27,597 --> 00:26:28,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's used.

391
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:30,520
Speaker 0: You know a lot you see it's like, you know cartoons.

392
00:26:31,243 --> 00:26:36,000
Speaker 0: I never had one but it was like a common slapstick comedy device, right?

393
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,025
Speaker 0: You know, you would see.

394
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:41,420
Speaker 0: it's a kind of thing you would see next to a mad magazine, right?

395
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:45,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you know like right in the same collection of like a whoopee cushion.

396
00:26:45,877 --> 00:26:48,206
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah No, yeah, right.

397
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:55,976
Speaker 0: so the that was invented by a person specifically Obviously, right a person named.

398
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:56,740
Speaker 0: What's this dude's name?

399
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,686
Speaker 0: It's not in the title of the YouTube video.

400
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:02,679
Speaker 0: Goldfarb Eddie Goldfarb, probably an old Jewish guy.

401
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:08,130
Speaker 0: So yet I did not know until today.

402
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,478
Speaker 0: today I learned Eddie Goldfarb.

403
00:27:10,538 --> 00:27:11,039
Speaker 0: it lives.

404
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,899
Speaker 0: He's like invented kerplunk.

405
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:17,602
Speaker 0: Eddie Goldfarb is 98.

406
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,652
Speaker 0: Not only did he invent the chattering teeth and kerplunk.

407
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:33,372
Speaker 0: He invented like the gun that shoots bubbles He invented a shark attack the board game like the amount of stuff that Eddie Goldfarb has invented toy wise is like.

408
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:36,400
Speaker 0: why is this this person like, you know?

409
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:47,368
Speaker 0: I don't think it's an exaggeration to say Like is probably unlike the great artist level like Picasso van Gogh level of Contributions to art.

410
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:56,400
Speaker 1: if you consider a toy art, which I think is obvious I mean think those kinds of toys like blended into the background of like Americana and the fabric of comedy.

411
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,476
Speaker 0: right, so it's like.

412
00:27:59,582 --> 00:28:02,269
Speaker 0: This amazing person has been unknown until today.

413
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:03,593
Speaker 0: There's a video about this person.

414
00:28:03,633 --> 00:28:07,445
Speaker 0: He's living in a retirement place in somewhere Looks like a nice one.

415
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:09,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's got like a whole house.

416
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:10,257
Speaker 0: You can walk.

417
00:28:10,337 --> 00:28:13,894
Speaker 0: He's 98 And he's not as well as he is when I'm 98.

418
00:28:13,894 --> 00:28:14,880
Speaker 1: I'll consider that a win.

419
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:18,140
Speaker 0: Yeah in the video they show it's like a little mini documentary about him.

420
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,734
Speaker 0: It shows like what his life is like hanging out with the old people being active.

421
00:28:21,775 --> 00:28:23,040
Speaker 0: He's still got a workshop.

422
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,788
Speaker 0: He's still making toys in there, right?

423
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,893
Speaker 0: He's got a little lathe.

424
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:27,200
Speaker 0: He's got all kinds of action going on.

425
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:36,268
Speaker 0: He knows and not only that this is a cool old man, right despite being 98. right Despite being a veteran of World War two.

426
00:28:36,308 --> 00:28:39,339
Speaker 0: who's doing radar on a Navy submarine, right?

427
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:41,224
Speaker 0: Pretty sure.

428
00:28:41,264 --> 00:28:42,820
Speaker 0: World War one didn't have the submarine.

429
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,719
Speaker 1: World War one did have the submarine.

430
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:52,099
Speaker 0: He's not a World War one veteran because there are yes, but World War one had the submarine didn't have this kind of summary.

431
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:57,694
Speaker 1: Anyway, you would be surprised how advanced the submarines of World War one were.

432
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:58,997
Speaker 0: I guess I would be.

433
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,214
Speaker 0: the point is Despite being 98 in the video.

434
00:29:02,254 --> 00:29:03,120
Speaker 0: They show this dude.

435
00:29:03,761 --> 00:29:07,960
Speaker 0: He knows he's googling for other toys to see if someone's patented it already.

436
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,489
Speaker 0: He's you know talking to Siri.

437
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,721
Speaker 0: right to do is to get the weather Right.

438
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:19,840
Speaker 0: He's using a 3d printer to make shit in his workshop as like this is a dude who kept up with the time.

439
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:24,420
Speaker 1: Right, that's one of the most important things you can do in your life is just keep up with the times, right?

440
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:29,200
Speaker 0: This is not someone who's like and you know still do I'm cranky and doing it the old-fashioned way.

441
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,198
Speaker 0: I think about another video I saw recently of the the guy who's still making phyllo dough the old-fashioned way.

442
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:39,975
Speaker 0: and it's like a tourist attraction Almost because it's not economical to make phyllo dough the old-fashioned way.

443
00:29:40,015 --> 00:29:49,088
Speaker 0: It's really slow and laborious And but it's like that kind of life that the very old You know craftsman leads right.

444
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:53,300
Speaker 0: and it's like, you know, that's kind of what I want to be when I'm an old man.

445
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,219
Speaker 0: I want to be the old Craftsman type old man, right?

446
00:29:58,561 --> 00:30:04,000
Speaker 1: But I hope I'm still recording some thing like geek nights when I'm 90, yeah, we'll see what happens.

447
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:09,080
Speaker 0: But I think you know, I saw the old phyllo man and I was thinking that's who I want to be old phyllo man.

448
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,768
Speaker 0: But now that I see old chattering teeth toy man.

449
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:15,460
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know what while old phyllo man is amazing, right?

450
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:31,039
Speaker 0: There's actually you know, I think there's something to be said here for old You know toy man being I guess better in that he's managed to maintain The essence and importance of the craftsmanship but not out himself to traditions and tools.

451
00:30:31,602 --> 00:30:35,180
Speaker 0: Right without being stubborn about the tool, right?

452
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,627
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's.

453
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:39,000
Speaker 0: it's like you can still take great, you know.

454
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,460
Speaker 0: Be some great photographer using a brand new digital camera and some Photoshop.

455
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,411
Speaker 0: You don't just got to use film in the and the the darkroom forever.

456
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but you can you know.

457
00:30:47,900 --> 00:31:01,360
Speaker 0: I think what's important is that with whichever method or tools you're using that you're the old person who's still you know Making stuff right whatever whether it's phyllo dough or photos or toys right and keep keeping it going, right?

458
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:07,254
Speaker 0: So yeah, great little 20-minute documentary here highly recommend.

459
00:31:07,695 --> 00:31:09,180
Speaker 1: All right, so I got a simple thing.

460
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:17,499
Speaker 1: it's a technology conventions video or connections video, but I haven't linked to this guy in a while, but He cuts a hole in the side of a dishwasher because he's replacing it.

461
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,560
Speaker 1: So he does some video of like what goes on into dishwasher and explain.

462
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,335
Speaker 0: So he puts like a piece of plastic over the side with a camera next to it.

463
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:23,898
Speaker 0: Basically.

464
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:26,200
Speaker 0: Yeah Before yeah.

465
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,976
Speaker 1: So the dishwasher with a light that you and I are often mad about in a very good way.

466
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:42,129
Speaker 1: for everyone who doesn't realize this All he basically talks about why all the people who wash their dishes before they put their dishes in the dishwasher Just like fundamentally misunderstand how dishwashers work.

467
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,574
Speaker 0: Well modern dishwashers.

468
00:31:43,594 --> 00:31:45,299
Speaker 1: Yes, old dishwashers were fine, too.

469
00:31:45,802 --> 00:31:48,660
Speaker 1: You've never had to rinse off your dishes before you put them in a dishwasher.

470
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:49,904
Speaker 0: I mean I never have.

471
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:56,385
Speaker 0: but I was all under the impression that the reason that people did was because old dishwashers were shitty And so they needed.

472
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,697
Speaker 1: so old dishwashers were even better at this than modern dishwashers.

473
00:31:59,737 --> 00:32:00,580
Speaker 1: They just were more wasteful.

474
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:07,503
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I was only the impression that people were rinsing dishes because old dishwashers didn't get them all the way clean and new ones Did.

475
00:32:07,564 --> 00:32:07,909
Speaker 0: but is that?

476
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:08,578
Speaker 0: I guess that's wrong?

477
00:32:10,321 --> 00:32:13,130
Speaker 0: Maybe it's not old dishwashers, but people had shitty dishwasher.

478
00:32:13,491 --> 00:32:15,859
Speaker 1: Yep, or more importantly people.

479
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:22,340
Speaker 1: The current problem people are having is that they're using those pods instead of regular old dishwasher formula, which is fine.

480
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:23,386
Speaker 1: It's like the same I use.

481
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:23,989
Speaker 0: I use one.

482
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:24,713
Speaker 0: It's not a pot.

483
00:32:24,753 --> 00:32:26,040
Speaker 0: It's not like a plastic bag one.

484
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,594
Speaker 0: It's like a. it's like a cube almost like a little rectangle of solid powder.

485
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:31,417
Speaker 0: That's just been packed.

486
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:34,244
Speaker 0: Yeah It works pretty great.

487
00:32:34,305 --> 00:32:34,866
Speaker 0: I don't have a problem.

488
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:42,300
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically if they if you use those But yet don't put any detergent in the pre-wash thing.

489
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:52,065
Speaker 0: That is usually the reason why dishwashers don't actually wash unless people because they're not using the the what's it called the blue stuff Not even the blue stuff.

490
00:32:52,146 --> 00:32:56,205
Speaker 1: you put two of those pods in but one pod in the main thing and put one pod just In the Bob.

491
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:56,731
Speaker 1: just tuck it in.

492
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,408
Speaker 1: the way dishwashers worked before the pods is.

493
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:06,867
Speaker 1: you put a bunch of detergent in the cup that opens midway through and you put Some detergent in the cup that's already open.

494
00:33:06,907 --> 00:33:08,413
Speaker 1: That's just right there in the first cycle.

495
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,252
Speaker 1: Oh Interesting, okay, you know dishwashers watch where it wash things.

496
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:14,954
Speaker 0: I did my.

497
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,339
Speaker 0: I don't know if my dishwasher has a.

498
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:22,439
Speaker 1: I am confident your dishwasher does support that like if you have a Bosch cuz.

499
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,108
Speaker 1: Some newer dishwashers have given up.

500
00:33:25,148 --> 00:33:28,900
Speaker 1: They've realized that people just use those pods and they redesigned how they work.

501
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:31,308
Speaker 0: Yes, like my dishwasher.

502
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:36,788
Speaker 0: There's one thing it opens and there's two Compartments in there separated by like a little bridge.

503
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:40,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's just I think to help you measure the amount of detergent.

504
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,474
Speaker 0: Right because they both of those open together.

505
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:43,220
Speaker 0: It's just one little.

506
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,300
Speaker 1: You know the real key is there are two doors.

507
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:51,160
Speaker 0: I have seen though some dishwashers that have two flaps that are separate for different things.

508
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:51,844
Speaker 1: Mine has one.

509
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,091
Speaker 0: I have only has one flap.

510
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:54,279
Speaker 0: it opens and that's it.

511
00:33:54,641 --> 00:34:00,180
Speaker 1: But basically the the gist of it is and also the drain impeller on most American dishwashers is.

512
00:34:00,421 --> 00:34:01,846
Speaker 1: Actually, remember how I said I weigh.

513
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:05,419
Speaker 1: when I was a kid grandma had a dishwasher just had a full-on garbage disposal in it.

514
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:12,092
Speaker 1: Okay, most modern dishwashers do have something like that in them There's little blades in the impeller at the bottom.

515
00:34:12,474 --> 00:34:12,835
Speaker 1: that does.

516
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:13,520
Speaker 1: that runs the drain.

517
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:18,599
Speaker 0: I think mine might actually have that even though we're told in New York that we don't have.

518
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:24,040
Speaker 1: The ones in dishwashers are apparently legal in New York because they don't count as garbage disposals.

519
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:30,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you have some brands they replace that with a stupid little filter.

520
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,320
Speaker 0: instead You got a clean like regular right exactly as I was looking for the filter in the dishwasher and I didn't find one.

521
00:34:36,781 --> 00:34:38,407
Speaker 0: And it sometimes it does make a noise.

522
00:34:38,427 --> 00:34:41,617
Speaker 0: that sounds that could be you know blade esque.

523
00:34:41,657 --> 00:34:42,320
Speaker 0: so yep.

524
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:44,715
Speaker 1: But basically he points out even doesn't like.

525
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:45,360
Speaker 1: he does this whole thing.

526
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,237
Speaker 1: You can watch but you don't even have to like.

527
00:34:48,761 --> 00:34:49,605
Speaker 1: Put like.

528
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,880
Speaker 1: maybe if there's like a pound of rice on the plate like get rid of that.

529
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:01,590
Speaker 1: But even if there's a chunk stuck to it if you actually put dishwasher detergent in for the pre-wash It'll wash that stuff off like completely fine.

530
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:04,080
Speaker 1: and most people who complain about the dishwasher were not working.

531
00:35:04,421 --> 00:35:07,152
Speaker 1: Well, just don't understand how to use their own dishwasher.

532
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:09,260
Speaker 0: my dishwasher has been working very well.

533
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,440
Speaker 0: I've just been using the automatic mode on it not choosing any special modes.

534
00:35:12,761 --> 00:35:16,977
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go read the manual for it and just double-check to make sure we're using it optimally.

535
00:35:17,098 --> 00:35:19,920
Speaker 0: the other thing I did not know soon a great job though.

536
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,138
Speaker 1: So is that the pre-wash on most dishwashers?

537
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,879
Speaker 1: uses it assumes that the hot water because it's plugged into your hot water tap that the hot water will come in hot.

538
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:37,739
Speaker 1: and if your Apartment or house is the kind of place where it takes a while to get hot water Your dishwasher actually will work way shittier.

539
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:47,440
Speaker 1: It won't heat that water for the pre-wash cycle because it assumes it'll unless it's a really fancy dishwasher Or it'll assume that the water coming in is already hot.

540
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:54,997
Speaker 1: So if you run your tap until hot water comes out first your dishwasher that's not working So well will magically probably work a lot better.

541
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:59,280
Speaker 1: It's just a video that's like at the level.

542
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:03,177
Speaker 0: I guess that would only happen if like you woke up and turn the dishwasher on right?

543
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:03,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

544
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,708
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I get hot water pretty much instantly.

545
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,798
Speaker 1: It's unless I wake up and take a shower before like 6 a.m.

546
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:09,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

547
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:13,125
Speaker 0: So then you're Yeah, anyway, anyway, let's get ready.

548
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:13,687
Speaker 1: We've been a moment.

549
00:36:13,727 --> 00:36:14,589
Speaker 1: We ain't doing anything.

550
00:36:14,649 --> 00:36:15,270
Speaker 1: We're stuck at home.

551
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:26,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm continuing to be home for the rest of the year and going back to work January 4th, so I'm continuing to work on Playing video games.

552
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,381
Speaker 1: mostly I'm off work this week.

553
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:29,264
Speaker 1: I see you're playing Hades.

554
00:36:29,324 --> 00:36:30,629
Speaker 1: I gotta play that so we can talk about it.

555
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, play that we'll talk.

556
00:36:32,054 --> 00:36:32,797
Speaker 0: Well, it's a good game.

557
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:33,419
Speaker 0: It's very.

558
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,784
Speaker 0: it's an action RPG.

559
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,088
Speaker 0: That's very slay.

560
00:36:36,128 --> 00:36:36,690
Speaker 0: the spire esque.

561
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,965
Speaker 1: Think tonight I'm gonna finally play either tonight or this week.

562
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:44,358
Speaker 1: this week later the week I'm playing phasmophobia cuz everyone's saying real good things about it.

563
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:48,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, what is that Cora co-op like ghost fighting game?

564
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:58,069
Speaker 1: Okay, it's one of those games that is good in that it supports VR players and desktop players pretty well And in fact, some of the roles are better for desktop or better for VR.

565
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:06,079
Speaker 1: That's that's a hybrid model that I think will be very good for game designers to internalize Over the next five or six years.

566
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:10,161
Speaker 1: as not everyone has VR headsets Like making you get like Star Wars quadrants.

567
00:37:10,181 --> 00:37:15,580
Speaker 1: the game that works well with VR But doesn't require VR is a sweet spot of design right now.

568
00:37:16,122 --> 00:37:21,454
Speaker 0: I definitely think in general games that require Different you have.

569
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:24,930
Speaker 0: you have different roles for different players that require different skills.

570
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:27,512
Speaker 1: I want to see radically different interfaces Right.

571
00:37:27,532 --> 00:37:34,630
Speaker 0: that require different interfaces different skills different equipment different things are very good because they are very inclusive, right?

572
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:42,686
Speaker 0: It's like you want to play something with your friend and you're really good at head-clicking So you want to play counter-strike and your friend is not good at head-clicking, right?

573
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:43,690
Speaker 1: That's a selection.

574
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,585
Speaker 1: They could they could be the commander instead.

575
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:46,130
Speaker 0: exactly.

576
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:54,090
Speaker 0: So just games where different roles are actually very very different and to the point where the people are almost playing different games.

577
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:57,801
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of like radical asymmetry in games lately.

578
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,647
Speaker 1: Anyway, both tabletop and video.

579
00:38:00,229 --> 00:38:02,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Give me that captain sonar action, right?

580
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:08,056
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so submarines again Captain sonar World War one.

581
00:38:08,398 --> 00:38:10,065
Speaker 1: you uh, you really didn't know.

582
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:12,497
Speaker 1: there were submarines in World War one That was like not good ones.

583
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:13,382
Speaker 1: That was odd.

584
00:38:13,402 --> 00:38:14,690
Speaker 1: They were actually really good.

585
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:18,790
Speaker 1: That was kind of the entire German war strategy after the Schleifen plan failed.

586
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,015
Speaker 0: Isn't that pretty sure?

587
00:38:21,156 --> 00:38:22,865
Speaker 0: you know does boot is World War two, right?

588
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:26,876
Speaker 1: Ah Right, I'm just not gonna touch that one.

589
00:38:26,896 --> 00:38:28,200
Speaker 0: Let's get into the main thing.

590
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:28,481
Speaker 0: You don't?

591
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:29,324
Speaker 0: you don't know do you?

592
00:38:29,785 --> 00:38:34,620
Speaker 1: now, I don't know Scott you boats were used in World War one.

593
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,110
Speaker 0: I'm looking it up now anyway.

594
00:38:38,631 --> 00:38:42,030
Speaker 1: Anyway, we're talking about the last decade.

595
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,715
Speaker 1: It is World War two.

596
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:44,337
Speaker 0: I was right.

597
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:45,239
Speaker 1: You're right on that one.

598
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:48,790
Speaker 0: Okay, I was right about why were you boats in both?

599
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:59,890
Speaker 1: but the you boats that were used in World War one were Not way far off from modern diesel submarines in a lot of surprising ways.

600
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,584
Speaker 0: Well it the one they had in dazboo, which is World War two is real shitty.

601
00:39:03,604 --> 00:39:11,110
Speaker 1: So I can't imagine Well, we hate that one was they were not pleasant to be in and they were dangerous.

602
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:13,244
Speaker 0: Alright, let's let's move on.

603
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:17,685
Speaker 1: So We figured you know end of the year.

604
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:21,956
Speaker 1: every year We're gonna do shows like this cuz it's really easy to come up with this idea But we're not.

605
00:39:22,037 --> 00:39:23,909
Speaker 0: well wait ten more years before you do shows like this.

606
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,565
Speaker 1: Well, we can do the year like last year next year thing.

607
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:30,323
Speaker 0: No, let's do 2020s and 2030s the next time we can do this show.

608
00:39:30,343 --> 00:39:30,625
Speaker 0: Sorry.

609
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:34,154
Speaker 1: No, okay Okay, then I'll ask you to come up with well I guess next year.

610
00:39:34,194 --> 00:39:37,910
Speaker 1: We'll probably just take time off this time of year because there won't be a pandemic murdering everyone.

611
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:40,479
Speaker 1: That's the only reason we're doing all these extra shows right now.

612
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,210
Speaker 1: It's so weird to do a show when I didn't go to work.

613
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:47,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can only hope anyway, usually if one of us doesn't go to work, please don't bother doing so.

614
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,410
Speaker 0: What happened this decade 2010 to 2020 in animation comics, whatever?

615
00:39:52,590 --> 00:40:03,445
Speaker 0: So what I seen is that at least as far as animation goes right, you know, there's it's sort of Like this, how did it go for me personally versus how did it go for the industry?

616
00:40:03,525 --> 00:40:04,830
Speaker 0: kind of difference, right?

617
00:40:06,423 --> 00:40:17,330
Speaker 0: and so For I think what happened is that if you look at when I looked back at my my data on my computer here All right, what was happening around 2009 2010?

618
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:17,612
Speaker 0: Right?

619
00:40:18,134 --> 00:40:21,929
Speaker 0: is this sort of shift happened where a lot of things?

620
00:40:22,613 --> 00:40:29,118
Speaker 0: ended started right sort of booted up and All those shifts that happened.

621
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:33,050
Speaker 0: then the rest of the decade you can see everything that happened.

622
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:41,673
Speaker 0: it was sort of those the the end result of that just either continuing or increasing or Accelerating.

623
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:42,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, there wasn't like.

624
00:40:42,778 --> 00:40:57,587
Speaker 0: I didn't see a lot of major shifts afterwards between say 2010 2011 and 2020 like one thing that really stands out Adventure time which we've talked about a lot recently on geek nights because it's still going.

625
00:40:57,848 --> 00:41:01,420
Speaker 1: technically Adventure time started in 2010.

626
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:17,689
Speaker 1: There you go the pilot was in 2007, but the actual show adventure time the premiered for real in April of 2010 and sort of set the tone for the decade of animation especially in America.

627
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:26,570
Speaker 1: How many shows only exist because adventure time like broke that ground for them to make a show like that.

628
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:34,283
Speaker 0: Yep, Cartoon Network like shifted its gears from what it had before then, you know Your Dexter's labs your Powerpuff Girls right and all that stuff right.

629
00:41:34,644 --> 00:41:39,118
Speaker 0: Adventure Time was like, alright Alright, this is now how Cartoon Network do right.

630
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:42,448
Speaker 0: and then you got your Steven universes and all you're right.

631
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:43,832
Speaker 1: Like.

632
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:51,789
Speaker 1: there's a serial show that builds on itself that grows that deals with complex real even adult themes But yet it's still accessible to kids.

633
00:41:52,872 --> 00:41:55,650
Speaker 1: Adventure time broke a lot of ground in terms of representation.

634
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,380
Speaker 1: It's even scary to think back on like that.

635
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:05,054
Speaker 1: that was even controversial in popular culture So recently like within this decade But it was.

636
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,360
Speaker 1: the networks wouldn't even let.

637
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,465
Speaker 1: Marceline and bubblegum kiss.

638
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:14,870
Speaker 1: and here we are in 2020 where there was a whole special dedicated to and then they kiss and Steven universe ran in entirety.

639
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:21,030
Speaker 0: I was always surprised that Powerpuff Girls let them have him even though him was not on very many episodes.

640
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:26,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, every Powerpuff Girls character by a lot him was definitely the best Powerpuff Girls character bar.

641
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:33,130
Speaker 1: No, no, I even made a mash-up of My Little Pony and Powerpuff Girls with him at one point.

642
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:34,796
Speaker 0: So that's another thing right.

643
00:42:35,138 --> 00:42:36,864
Speaker 0: My Little Pony friendship is magic.

644
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,290
Speaker 0: another cereal, right?

645
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,693
Speaker 0: When did that show?

646
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:42,281
Speaker 0: fucking start right that and it ended.

647
00:42:42,541 --> 00:42:44,066
Speaker 0: it's pretty much this decade.

648
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,450
Speaker 0: is the My Little Pony decade.

649
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:54,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, right that started then and it went through and it ended all within 2010 to 2020. there wasn't something that started in the late 2000s.

650
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:55,024
Speaker 1: Yep.

651
00:42:55,045 --> 00:42:59,510
Speaker 1: So think Adventure Time and My Little Pony friendship is magic.

652
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:02,389
Speaker 1: That's that those are some power.

653
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:06,767
Speaker 0: Yep, that's pretty much like the defining American animations, right?

654
00:43:06,787 --> 00:43:10,055
Speaker 0: So Anime wise right.

655
00:43:10,096 --> 00:43:16,244
Speaker 0: you look and You know the 2000s we had like this big anime boom in the u.s.

656
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:17,950
Speaker 0: Right and all that kind of action.

657
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:27,564
Speaker 1: You know that that happened right when Oh crunchyroll went for like actually went legit at before the decade and sort of Exploded onto the scene like that was this decade.

658
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:32,530
Speaker 1: if we had to say anything about anime It was that anime truly got mainstream in the u.s.

659
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,113
Speaker 1: Like it.

660
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:36,690
Speaker 1: a lot of people watch anime who don't even think about it being anime.

661
00:43:37,212 --> 00:43:42,066
Speaker 0: I think that was true before also, but now it's just you know more true.

662
00:43:42,247 --> 00:43:43,009
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

663
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,021
Speaker 1: Yeah, it will the ecosystem stabilized in a big way.

664
00:43:47,402 --> 00:43:53,871
Speaker 1: and we're seeing like just now at the end of the decade There's a radical shift in the industry yet again Hmm,

665
00:43:54,192 --> 00:44:03,734
Speaker 0: but I think what I'm trying to say is that there were like a set of studios both Japan, you know I guess companies right meaty companies in that industry both Japan side and u.s.

666
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:19,010
Speaker 0: Side right and some of them still exist from you know way back right, but it's sort of the organization of those companies Sort of shifted around that time and then you know, there hasn't been too big of a shift since then, right?

667
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:25,712
Speaker 0: So like for example Sad times right Satoshi khan passed away in 2010.

668
00:44:25,712 --> 00:44:28,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that sort of put a close on that biz.

669
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:38,734
Speaker 1: But then we saw Masaki Yuasa rose over the course of this decade Yuasa just bad in a thousand and producing way more anime than any human has a right to Write.

670
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:41,407
Speaker 0: pretty much, you know 2010s was the decade of us.

671
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:47,554
Speaker 0: It was also the decade of like studio trigger coming out of you know Nowhere right.

672
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:50,707
Speaker 1: anime was saved again and again and again and again.

673
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,940
Speaker 0: Yep, it was the decade of hosted a hosted.

674
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,987
Speaker 0: it existed, but summer wars came out in 2010, right?

675
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:01,304
Speaker 0: So hosted a put out, you know a movie every I don't know.

676
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,027
Speaker 0: What's his schedule?

677
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:02,670
Speaker 0: two three years?

678
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:03,835
Speaker 0: He's got another one coming soon.

679
00:45:03,856 --> 00:45:04,901
Speaker 0: that we should have been news.

680
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,126
Speaker 0: They just announced what it was.

681
00:45:06,428 --> 00:45:19,350
Speaker 1: Yep Meanwhile, you know, I realized something but I actually want to mention briefly around that the whole seeding ground like the ground That was made that made space before the show that actually did this first was venture brothers.

682
00:45:20,872 --> 00:45:24,607
Speaker 1: But that shit started in 2004 and they produced them so slowly.

683
00:45:26,855 --> 00:45:35,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not your brothers I don't think it's for children now, but it did the it did like a lot of the things that Adventure Time did and Steven and shows like it did.

684
00:45:36,831 --> 00:45:54,190
Speaker 1: Venture brothers kind of did those sorts of like storytelling tropes and storytelling techniques of a serial First in this era, but it was kind of obscure aimed at a different audience and was put out so slowly That no one realized what they were doing until well into this decade.

685
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:58,581
Speaker 0: But also you look at say Studio Ghibli, right?

686
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:00,527
Speaker 0: It's like before 2010s, right?

687
00:46:00,567 --> 00:46:01,510
Speaker 0: They were solid.

688
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,802
Speaker 0: They were releasing their movies, right?

689
00:46:03,822 --> 00:46:04,747
Speaker 0: They had that run, right?

690
00:46:05,991 --> 00:46:10,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then it was you know, Princess Mononoke, right was I guess around 2000 ish, right?

691
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,731
Speaker 0: Princess Mononoke, I think was because I remember it being in a theater in Israel in the year 2000.

692
00:46:17,731 --> 00:46:21,427
Speaker 0: And then you know, they had their you know spirited away was also in the 2000s, right?

693
00:46:22,674 --> 00:46:32,420
Speaker 0: One they've had right and then Right and then sort of even they got into the 2010s.

694
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:48,312
Speaker 0: that's sort of when it's like Miyazaki retires He unretires Goro puts out a movie something else, right and they sort of like, you know destabilized a bit that regularity that just powerful march of Ghibli movies sort of you know, Definitely

695
00:46:48,393 --> 00:46:54,230
Speaker 1: a sense of a decline of Ghibli as a driving force and a rise of all these other studios and creators.

696
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:59,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, even the you know, the the brooms one that was like a spin-off of Jim like that.

697
00:46:59,506 --> 00:47:01,955
Speaker 0: Yeah former Ghibli people They didn't make a good movie.

698
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:14,120
Speaker 1: No, and we haven't even talked about Eric in the witch, which I am 100% down with 3d CG anime like do not get me wrong here that Lupin movie, which we're gonna watch soon We're gonna watch it real soon.

699
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,167
Speaker 1: Yeah this week definitely watching it this week But you're rigging the witch kind of looks like last decade Pixar animation.

700
00:47:21,187 --> 00:47:24,048
Speaker 1: Like it does not look good Who knows who knows?

701
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:30,184
Speaker 0: So, yeah, and then you know that sort of pattern right that has been established.

702
00:47:30,585 --> 00:47:32,612
Speaker 0: right of you know The the.

703
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:41,619
Speaker 0: you know that after that shift has just sort of maintained right those studios making those anime movies They just kept putting movies out on a schedule.

704
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,100
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:47:42,281 --> 00:47:42,963
Speaker 0: Oh, what's his name?

706
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:43,324
Speaker 0: Of course?

00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:44,709
Speaker 0: How could I forget cloud guy?

00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:47,400
Speaker 0: Makoto Shinkai Makoto Shinkai.

709
00:47:47,701 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 0: This has been also the decade of Makoto Shinkai Obviously right on that same schedule right of you know Putting out movies, but I think it wasn't actually until you know When exactly did your name come out because that was like the first big successful one, right?

710
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,305
Speaker 1: I mean that was I was on a flight and I watched it because it happened to be on a Delta.

711
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:13,525
Speaker 0: your name is actually from 2016. it's like Shinkai we knew about like even we were in college.

712
00:48:13,565 --> 00:48:14,890
Speaker 0: We knew who Shinkai was.

713
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,630
Speaker 1: I still think it's second best movie is a place promise?

714
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:23,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably But you know, they got the five minute centimeters per second, whatever.

715
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:33,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know even though we knew who Shinkai was in the early 2000s mid 2000s Didn't really bust out until this decade and become a big deal, right?

716
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,348
Speaker 0: You know on that same level as you know, your Yuwasas and your everyone else, right?

717
00:48:37,388 --> 00:48:37,529
Speaker 0: So

718
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:59,550
Speaker 1: but yeah A broader point around this decade is that it really feels like we are living in this golden age of animation right now like a red like a mega Renaissance of just animated shows across a variety of Studios a variety of styles like there is more good animation to watch now than there might have ever been.

719
00:49:00,773 --> 00:49:09,630
Speaker 0: Well, I think you know you have people who grew up Really, you know watching a lot of animation caring a lot about Animation, right?

720
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:15,470
Speaker 0: You know like cuz think when we were you know kids what was available on TV for us at that time.

721
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:27,946
Speaker 0: You know people who came, you know before us had like Hanna-Barbera garbage, you know garbage, right, but You know, they didn't necessarily, you know Looney Tunes were in the theaters, right?

722
00:49:27,966 --> 00:49:30,166
Speaker 0: They weren't on TV necessarily.

723
00:49:31,316 --> 00:49:38,330
Speaker 1: But I was a kid who like Rejected American animation like at a very young age and got hyper obsessed with anime for a long time.

724
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:42,630
Speaker 0: So we had Looney Tunes so we were able to see you know, we had Disney movies, right?

725
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,623
Speaker 0: We had you know weird little mermaids Lion Kings all those right.

726
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:52,573
Speaker 0: and we had you know The we up to those Dexter's labs and we also had like B tasks and all that every right We.

727
00:49:52,673 --> 00:49:55,189
Speaker 0: that was like when we grew up people who grew up after us.

728
00:49:55,953 --> 00:49:59,309
Speaker 0: They were starting to just get like Pokemon is on TV.

729
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:01,375
Speaker 0: Right, you know they're.

730
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,062
Speaker 0: you know, it's like they were just direct to the anime.

731
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,810
Speaker 0: not anime is this rare special different thing.

732
00:50:07,932 --> 00:50:12,658
Speaker 0: But also the Looney Tunes weren't there anymore Necessarily right, you know.

733
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:15,109
Speaker 0: the B test wasn't there and such.

734
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:19,326
Speaker 0: And now if you're a kid, are you even watching cartoons on TV?

735
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:20,430
Speaker 0: You just watching YouTube, right?

736
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:21,165
Speaker 0: You know.

737
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:31,890
Speaker 0: so the people that are our age are adults who are working and They're working around the world and they have powerful computers of which it's now easier to make animation better animation.

738
00:50:32,051 --> 00:50:35,222
Speaker 0: Not that it's easy ever but it's you know They can make it.

739
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:38,055
Speaker 0: So that's why we're seeing.

740
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:44,063
Speaker 0: what we're seeing right now is people our age who grew up seeing the things that we saw are now in charge of.

741
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:45,373
Speaker 1: you know the case in point.

742
00:50:45,533 --> 00:51:01,722
Speaker 1: an example that stands out very strongly for me is that Netflix Castlevania because that is Clearly like that is a labor of love of the kinds of people who when they were young saw Vampire Hunter D and said all I want is something that's like that More more like that, please.

743
00:51:02,365 --> 00:51:02,948
Speaker 1: and here we are.

744
00:51:03,731 --> 00:51:06,945
Speaker 0: So I think that is another thing that happened sort of later in the decade is the.

745
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:09,391
Speaker 1: the second half of the decade was Netflix.

746
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:15,005
Speaker 0: it's Netflix specifically I think but this sort of because look Netflix has got right now.

747
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:20,443
Speaker 1: Castlevania Hilda Kipo was the on Netflix, which was fantastic friends.

748
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:23,252
Speaker 1: It's Disney show I think but Dragon Prince.

749
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dragon Prince which got picked up for what?

750
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,933
Speaker 0: four or five more seasons like they're gonna do a lot of seasons for Dragon Prince.

751
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:31,847
Speaker 1: Yeah Disney like the reboot of DuckTales there were.

752
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:34,561
Speaker 0: there were more Disney's thing I think.

753
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,916
Speaker 0: gravity falls I think was the start of the Disney.

754
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:38,281
Speaker 1: Gravity Falls was there toad?

755
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:43,037
Speaker 1: if into this like new era of TV gravity falls was a fantastic show.

756
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:46,727
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Um, what was the other thing?

757
00:51:46,868 --> 00:51:51,324
Speaker 0: Oh, of course, so I think pretty sure Didn't our favorite?

758
00:51:51,404 --> 00:51:54,594
Speaker 0: didn't Secret of Kells come out in oh nine or oh, I was gonna talk about that last.

759
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:55,979
Speaker 1: so, uh into the.

760
00:51:56,844 --> 00:52:05,238
Speaker 1: The Tom Moore trilogy began I think late 2009 early 2010 was Secret of Kells because remember they had budget trouble.

761
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:10,140
Speaker 0: like we're lucky They're even able to make cows for a lot of only were able to make wolf walkers cuz Apple gave him money.

762
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, they went to get money wherever they could get money.

763
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:17,706
Speaker 1: So look over the course of the decade they made those three like Movies for all time.

764
00:52:17,766 --> 00:52:22,342
Speaker 1: that trilogy I think will will be looked at forever as an important Milestone.

765
00:52:22,744 --> 00:52:26,336
Speaker 0: and just theatrical animation those movies like I think about so many my 80s animation, right?

766
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,780
Speaker 0: You know, you're thinking Thundercats He-Man Transformers Voltron.

767
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,212
Speaker 0: Now, you know original My Little Pony Care Bears gummy bears, right.

768
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:34,820
Speaker 0: you think about 90s, you know.

769
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:36,145
Speaker 0: You're starting to think about.

770
00:52:36,165 --> 00:52:38,654
Speaker 0: you know, those, you know, the Dexter's labs and the.

771
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,200
Speaker 0: you know, those sorts of things, right?

772
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:43,285
Speaker 0: The Ren and Stimpy's You know the Duggs, right?

773
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:46,032
Speaker 0: That's the 90s thought right in the 2000s.

774
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:49,160
Speaker 0: I guess it's like what the Spongebob's right of the world.

775
00:52:50,264 --> 00:53:00,900
Speaker 0: But I can only you know in my life I can only think about in the 2000s catching up on All of the anime the great anime of the past that had suddenly become accessible, right?

776
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,967
Speaker 0: You know the even partly.

777
00:53:02,987 --> 00:53:08,151
Speaker 1: that's that's our more of our like personal experience Even though those things were older right.

778
00:53:08,252 --> 00:53:12,810
Speaker 0: and also when I look at you know, the US Animation of the 2000s right?

779
00:53:13,111 --> 00:53:16,101
Speaker 0: It feels like, you know, 2000 to 2010.

780
00:53:16,101 --> 00:53:29,470
Speaker 0: It feels like at that time that run of Disney movies, you know, the Aladdin Lion King run had sort of yeah Yeah, you know Pixar I guess started late high school So late 90s, so I guess there was.

781
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,937
Speaker 0: there was a lot of Pixar action in the 2000s.

782
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,416
Speaker 1: Definitely, you know your cars and your well, I'm thinking I'll stop my head of.

783
00:53:35,436 --> 00:53:38,892
Speaker 1: like animated movies I saw in the last decade that stood out like Tangled was good.

784
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:40,500
Speaker 1: Arrietty was okay.

785
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:45,280
Speaker 1: We talked about that while he's 2008 how to train your dragon a cat in Paris, right?

786
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,693
Speaker 0: So 2000s was like the the Pixar run right?

787
00:53:49,295 --> 00:54:07,701
Speaker 0: Not that that run is ended But I think it's you know, they sort of had the sole control of that right like Dreamworks is there but it wasn't You know with their Shrek's I guess also, right but Pixar was really like the premier American animated movies of the 2000 to 2010 right and now to 10 to 220.

788
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:11,070
Speaker 0: We have not just like this, you know few things to focus on.

789
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:14,480
Speaker 0: It's like all those things we said there's such a variety.

790
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:20,445
Speaker 1: That's what stands out the most decade, you know, like we get a show like Bojack Horseman Which I know that is not.

791
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:28,620
Speaker 1: like you're not interested in a show that is adjacent to Californication but that show was important and very good to get in birdie.

792
00:54:29,441 --> 00:54:31,168
Speaker 0: That show I should got canceled right?

793
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:32,574
Speaker 1: Well, it got re-picked up.

794
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:38,220
Speaker 1: stay tuned, but to get birdie I don't think anyone's made a show like that that had a mass audience before.

795
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:57,605
Speaker 1: Like I say how much animation I'm just watching on a daily basis like right now like the it just kept accelerating The decade just accelerated and accelerated and accelerated to the point that I have to like cue up which show I'll watch next and they're All great,

796
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:03,156
Speaker 0: and this doesn't include Like independently animated things on YouTube, right

797
00:55:03,337 --> 00:55:03,840
Speaker 1: exactly.

798
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:11,469
Speaker 1: Channels we link to like worth it kids big top burger like low tiered Independent like publish on YouTube.

799
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:13,857
Speaker 1: animation is having its own golden age right now.

800
00:55:14,339 --> 00:55:23,040
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean YouTube wasn't launched until 2005 so YouTube did exist in the previous decade, but it wasn't a thing until this decade.

801
00:55:23,207 --> 00:55:23,418
Speaker 1: Yeah.

802
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:39,680
Speaker 0: So what YouTube has done for animation has largely been this decade almost entirely Right and not just YouTube but you know and and comics also what Twitter has done for comics is Twitter came out in 2007 But it wasn't really a thing we talked about in the technology episode.

803
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what Twitter and all these other social media platforms have done for comics, right?

804
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:47,353
Speaker 0: We talked about in the first part of this show in the news, right?

805
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:48,116
Speaker 0: You know the.

806
00:55:48,438 --> 00:55:53,140
Speaker 0: you know, you're Right, you're Captain Underpants and you're Raina Tegelmeier right being like the biggest.

807
00:55:53,401 --> 00:55:55,969
Speaker 0: You know what the third biggest comic is in the US.

808
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:59,120
Speaker 0: is that dude drawn the Nathan Pyle guy with his little alien comic.

809
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,160
Speaker 0: You know the stupid aliens that they won't say the noun they'll just describe the thing.

810
00:56:04,401 --> 00:56:04,902
Speaker 1: Oh, no, like.

811
00:56:04,963 --> 00:56:05,726
Speaker 0: instead like.

812
00:56:05,786 --> 00:56:12,900
Speaker 0: instead of saying comic they'll say like space ice or something, you know Let me put let me put all the irregular things inside of regular objects.

813
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,968
Speaker 0: Exactly that guy right who makes those comics.

814
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,296
Speaker 0: He's like the third biggest comic seller.

815
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:19,300
Speaker 0: And how did he get that way?

816
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:21,285
Speaker 0: Hosting a comic on Twitter.

817
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:22,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

818
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:24,195
Speaker 0: That's 2010s.

819
00:56:24,556 --> 00:56:25,620
Speaker 0: That's this decade.

820
00:56:26,821 --> 00:56:29,189
Speaker 1: Though in my personal interaction with comics and animation.

821
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:35,612
Speaker 1: What I find is that I've been watching a lot more Animation this decade for a lot of reasons.

822
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:37,760
Speaker 0: I have been reading a lot of your comics.

823
00:56:39,042 --> 00:56:45,308
Speaker 0: I think you're react well also fewer comments and your reaction to all the animation is oh my god Let me watch all this great anime.

824
00:56:45,348 --> 00:56:46,837
Speaker 1: I'm just watching it like something new comes out.

825
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:47,340
Speaker 1: That's so good.

826
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,468
Speaker 1: I just have to watch it for for me.

827
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:50,352
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

828
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:51,316
Speaker 0: There's way too many things.

829
00:56:51,336 --> 00:56:52,420
Speaker 0: I don't have time for all that shit.

830
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,776
Speaker 0: Let's only watch the extremely good ones and sort of cue up other things.

831
00:56:56,797 --> 00:57:01,640
Speaker 0: when I got some time Mmm, because if I tried to watch them all that's all I would do I would write I would not have time for anything else.

832
00:57:01,761 --> 00:57:03,179
Speaker 1: I mean, we're like we're in the right now.

833
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:09,520
Speaker 1: We're in the middle of trying to finish Hilda before another show comes out right cuz season 2 of Hilda just dropped.

834
00:57:10,446 --> 00:57:14,906
Speaker 0: so comics wise right at least personally comics wise cuz I have.

835
00:57:15,046 --> 00:57:15,568
Speaker 0: I've ordered.

836
00:57:15,588 --> 00:57:28,994
Speaker 0: I have I guess I don't know if it's good or not, but I've every month since like 2006 I've ordered comics online for this one website right where I get a big discount and I have to pre-order them and I can just see my full order.

837
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:59,351
Speaker 0: history forever there and Basically what I can see is that in the 2010s the early 2010 I was still buying a lot of comics right and what was happening was I spent myself right the 2000s buying up sort of like a library of all of the like You know already known Great American graphic novels right like full runs of like vertigo stuff right like all this stuff I had never read not just American, but also Mike.

838
00:57:59,471 --> 00:58:02,748
Speaker 0: Oh, let me buy all the Akira's Let me buy all the.

839
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:08,010
Speaker 0: you know whatever it is all this stuff I had never read that already exists right I was able to.

840
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:13,004
Speaker 0: I've spent a lot to acquire like and read all of it Right that's like the whole light.

841
00:58:13,025 --> 00:58:19,751
Speaker 0: You know all this stuff going back to forever in the past right as comics Aren't that old as right?

842
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:28,299
Speaker 0: I mean I guess if you just count illustrations They're super old, but you know in terms of comic books they started in the early 19s that you know 1900s right there didn't go back that far.

843
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:37,746
Speaker 0: and then in the towards the 2010s what was happening is I was sort of Getting all the the stuff.

844
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:42,118
Speaker 0: that was sort of like the industry catching up to reprinting old stuff like.

845
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:46,473
Speaker 0: I see a lot of like Orders like blackjack like they were still trying to get all the Tezuka into English.

846
00:58:46,513 --> 00:58:52,131
Speaker 0: Yeah like that right And you know like there were but there were still.

847
00:58:52,151 --> 00:59:11,197
Speaker 0: there were like these hot new things Right that we're still coming out then right Whereas now like what happened is basically a lot of those things ended or caught up right to Write the ends, so it's like yotsubo's buying a yotsubo every month, and then that was it.

848
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:14,932
Speaker 0: and now I get a yotsubo Whenever there's a yotsubo, which is every year or few.

849
00:59:15,113 --> 00:59:16,480
Speaker 0: right they don't come out that often.

850
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:20,790
Speaker 0: So there aren't too many things.

851
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:30,019
Speaker 0: I'm following actively that are coming out Regularly and actively or if I am following they come out with a trade once in a while.

852
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:36,600
Speaker 1: Honestly the only things I'm following actively regularly as they come out are there are two comics that I'm reading.

853
00:59:36,922 --> 00:59:38,409
Speaker 1: I guess three nothing special.

854
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:40,780
Speaker 1: I'm still just reading that like actively as it comes out.

855
00:59:42,145 --> 00:59:45,299
Speaker 1: order of the stick And I'll go back.

856
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:46,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll go off.

857
00:59:46,868 --> 00:59:47,432
Speaker 0: I am right.

858
00:59:47,473 --> 00:59:55,140
Speaker 0: so it's like I Definitely at some point in the 2010s messed up my personal webcomic like reading system.

859
00:59:55,783 --> 00:59:59,900
Speaker 1: Well, that's something it's I found it difficult to really engage with a like.

860
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:01,612
Speaker 1: I have a really easy pipeline of.

861
01:00:01,692 --> 01:00:04,650
Speaker 1: I'm gonna watch some cartoons And I'd like to watch them on all my devices like.

862
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,600
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter what device I use everything just works.

863
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:09,829
Speaker 1: But depending on the comic I run or read it's.

864
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,715
Speaker 1: there's multiple places to go.

865
01:00:11,815 --> 01:00:12,818
Speaker 1: There's different apps.

866
01:00:12,878 --> 01:00:15,631
Speaker 1: some comics Just don't lend themselves to digital formats.

867
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:16,234
Speaker 1: like.

868
01:00:16,254 --> 01:00:17,440
Speaker 1: there's a lot of cereal.

869
01:00:18,002 --> 01:00:26,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cereal webcomics the order of the stick types that I do really like But I haven't read order to stick in so long cuz I forgot where I left off.

870
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:28,185
Speaker 0: It's been so many.

871
01:00:28,206 --> 01:00:29,292
Speaker 1: I think it's getting near the end.

872
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:30,479
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

873
01:00:31,721 --> 01:00:34,938
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's like I have to you know like go get it.

874
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:39,119
Speaker 0: somehow I have the books the book at the paper books are probably the easiest way to read it now, right?

875
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:46,859
Speaker 0: So I feel like for those it's like I'm just gonna wait to your paper book now It's too much for me to go try to read it on the internet, right?

876
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,520
Speaker 0: And the comics I'm reading on the web are the like the one-shot.

877
01:00:51,881 --> 01:00:54,028
Speaker 0: You know funny joke comics because they're on Twitter.

878
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:57,139
Speaker 0: if you tweet out your funny comic right and then I can see it.

879
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:04,239
Speaker 0: I can't do the thing I used to do every morning where I'd like open up one tab for every webcomic and see if there was a new strip.

880
01:01:04,279 --> 01:01:09,772
Speaker 1: that And in Megatokio updated even though it's Thursday and they definitely didn't.

881
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:11,620
Speaker 0: I haven't done that in a decade.

882
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:15,859
Speaker 0: I can't even remember all the comics that were in to go check on.

883
01:01:16,161 --> 01:01:23,465
Speaker 1: so another thing with us because we've gone on for a while already that in our personal engagement because this is this hasn't been a Radical change though.

884
01:01:23,485 --> 01:01:24,308
Speaker 1: It is more accessible.

885
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:24,508
Speaker 1: Now.

886
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:27,560
Speaker 1: Anime movies are much more like this decade.

887
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:32,859
Speaker 1: They've been in the theaters in America in a way that they were not in the previous decade.

888
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:38,781
Speaker 0: You know It was a special event in the 2000s if an anime movie was gonna be in 2010.

889
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:40,640
Speaker 1: It's like I'm looking at old Gignets episodes.

890
01:01:41,202 --> 01:01:45,256
Speaker 1: We went to a physical theater to watch like almost every anime movie that came out.

891
01:01:45,277 --> 01:01:46,240
Speaker 1: That wasn't a sequel.

892
01:01:47,064 --> 01:01:49,738
Speaker 0: We also live in New York, but no like they're screening everywhere.

893
01:01:49,859 --> 01:01:54,434
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like if there wasn't a pandemic wolf walkers was ready to screen across the country.

894
01:01:54,515 --> 01:02:03,149
Speaker 0: Yeah in all kinds of theaters Yeah, so it's like yeah You know some of them have limited Runs like one or two nights here and there

895
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:10,899
Speaker 1: but we'll go and we see the same people at those screenings Like there's people in New York who I recognize just because we end up at the same theater to watch the same anime movie.

896
01:02:11,864 --> 01:02:15,802
Speaker 0: but yeah, the movie theater has really opened up to You know.

897
01:02:15,902 --> 01:02:21,840
Speaker 0: not, you know, just Disney animation, but all you know and DreamWorks and whoever but everything, right?

898
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,322
Speaker 0: It's gonna be there even if it's just for a few nights or maybe more than a few nights Who knows.

899
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:29,358
Speaker 1: so if I had to guess I think what's gonna happen over the next decade is.

900
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:37,980
Speaker 1: Animation is going to finally break out of the weird American obsession with the idea that it's primarily for kids or it's violent porn.

901
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:42,120
Speaker 1: It's already broken out of that in a lot in a big way.

902
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:49,140
Speaker 1: But I think that cultural idea that is weirdly pernicious in America is going to die its final death in the next decade.

903
01:02:49,581 --> 01:02:55,319
Speaker 1: Animation is just another form of visual storytelling and people won't think that much about it.

904
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,974
Speaker 0: But the old people dying will help with that, right?

905
01:02:58,015 --> 01:02:58,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.

906
01:02:59,544 --> 01:02:59,946
Speaker 0: I think.

907
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:04,629
Speaker 1: maybe then we'll get more movies like Rango which Did come out this past decade.

908
01:03:04,669 --> 01:03:06,738
Speaker 1: that movie is not as old as you might remember as being.

909
01:03:06,818 --> 01:03:07,059
Speaker 1: hmm.

910
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:18,619
Speaker 0: So I don't know what will happen right because I don't know too much of like, you know, the industry Developments right behind the scenes information upon which you would need to base that kind of prediction.

911
01:03:19,782 --> 01:03:27,899
Speaker 0: but I can say what I'd like to happen right is I would like to see a Cartoon saloon esque explosion from other countries, right?

912
01:03:28,241 --> 01:03:30,005
Speaker 0: We got us.

913
01:03:30,085 --> 01:03:34,114
Speaker 1: Japan Ireland, right France has always been up there.

914
01:03:34,596 --> 01:03:36,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, France has always been there, right?

915
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,468
Speaker 1: It's like let's see the German animation explosion.

916
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:40,832
Speaker 0: Give me the nice either.

917
01:03:40,853 --> 01:03:43,200
Speaker 1: Romanian animation explosion, right?

918
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,790
Speaker 0: India India hit us with your animation here.

919
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:46,613
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

920
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,239
Speaker 1: Imagine a decade where?

921
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:55,139
Speaker 1: Bollywood like like the Bollywood equivalent of anime arises like you can't tell me.

922
01:03:55,180 --> 01:04:11,920
Speaker 0: there Plenty of filmmakers in India, there are people who can draw in India make, you know See your money make a movie a 90-minute full-length animated feature film and you know Aim for like Oscar with it when you're making it right do the best you fucking can right you can do it.

923
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:12,643
Speaker 0: I believe in you.

924
01:04:12,663 --> 01:04:13,427
Speaker 0: I want to see it.

925
01:04:13,507 --> 01:04:16,200
Speaker 0: I got my money and I shut up and take it honey for you.

926
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:19,603
Speaker 0: You know Brazil.

927
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:20,488
Speaker 0: Brazil could do it too.

928
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:24,494
Speaker 0: Probably I think Brazil has done some G kids I think did put out a movie from Brazil.

929
01:04:24,534 --> 01:04:25,259
Speaker 0: I didn't see it though.

930
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:30,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there I mean there are a lot of great movies animated from all these countries.

931
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:35,820
Speaker 1: The difference is they don't get mass releases like in America.

932
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:40,840
Speaker 1: They're not widespread like they're not known except to people like us who would go to like a film festival to see them.

933
01:04:41,301 --> 01:04:46,420
Speaker 0: Well, they're also not the kind the kind of movie that gets from you know, one country to another like that.

934
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,440
Speaker 0: You know, at least to here is something that has like sort of like indie movie theater appeal.

935
01:04:50,681 --> 01:04:56,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's mate you have to make that you can make it with the mass appeal, right?

936
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:59,167
Speaker 0: Even though it's a foreign film right?

937
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:02,739
Speaker 0: Look what Parasite did right, you know, it's like you can do it, right?

938
01:05:04,502 --> 01:05:08,516
Speaker 0: You know Akira did it but that was yeah the greatest achievement of animation ever.

939
01:05:09,098 --> 01:05:09,480
Speaker 0: good luck.

940
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:16,184
Speaker 1: But I think honestly of all the shows that were pushed some of this like push the American audience to be more open to All this.

941
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:18,040
Speaker 1: honestly, I think it's Bojack.

942
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:23,270
Speaker 1: I think that opened some people's eyes in a way that Shows should have been able to do but weren't able to.

943
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:25,820
Speaker 0: for some reason you don't even need to hit the American audience.

944
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,868
Speaker 0: Just try to hit audience outside of your country.

945
01:05:28,908 --> 01:05:30,633
Speaker 0: Whatever your country is, right?

946
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,140
Speaker 0: Just you know, screw stupid Americans, right?

947
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,800
Speaker 0: It's like if you're you know, don't try to target any one other place.

948
01:05:38,262 --> 01:05:42,357
Speaker 0: Just try to make something that anyone in the world will enjoy, right?

949
01:05:44,642 --> 01:06:04,335
Speaker 0: The other thing I hope to see but I don't know if we will see is and I guess this applies to the video game industry too, but we haven't done 2010s in gaming yet is some sort of fixing of the Animation labor market where basically if you work especially in Japan and anime or I guess other places.

950
01:06:04,355 --> 01:06:06,220
Speaker 0: you're being paid nothing working long hours.

951
01:06:06,382 --> 01:06:07,819
Speaker 0: It's horrible, right?

952
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:11,518
Speaker 1: I do think the animation industry is going to.

953
01:06:11,538 --> 01:06:17,340
Speaker 1: I think both the animation industry and the video game industry globally are about to hit a brick wall of.

954
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:22,200
Speaker 1: It is literally impossible to make these things at this scale with our current at global economic system.

955
01:06:22,683 --> 01:06:31,837
Speaker 0: I would love to see a labor side reckoning and reorganization that way and then come out on the other side and that would be the 2020s of.

956
01:06:33,262 --> 01:06:37,680
Speaker 0: You know the same way that there was a sort of a you know twist up in the 20 late to that.

957
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:40,110
Speaker 1: I would like to see that in both animation and games.

958
01:06:40,712 --> 01:06:42,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, and every industry.

959
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,288
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean obviously right destroy capital.

960
01:06:44,308 --> 01:06:46,700
Speaker 0: those are those are the artistic in capitalism Belinda est.

961
01:06:47,122 --> 01:06:48,350
Speaker 0: Yeah that we're focused on.

962
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:49,900
Speaker 0: that have the this problem, right?

963
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:57,418
Speaker 1: so so the last thing on a personal note cuz you know, we Got our start doing anime like panels and lectures at anime cons.

964
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:01,119
Speaker 0: like years They were they were the easiest to get into because they were small-time.

965
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:09,355
Speaker 1: 2002 if the 2000s was the era of us centering our convention lives and our panel lives.

966
01:07:09,676 --> 01:07:14,229
Speaker 1: and like a lot of stuff around Otakon and a line going to a lot of anime cons.

967
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,056
Speaker 1: the 2010s is interesting.

968
01:07:16,557 --> 01:07:20,393
Speaker 1: in 2009 That was the last Otakon before they kicked us out of this off the staff and there was drama.

969
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:29,134
Speaker 1: and then we switched to anime Boston and we went to ban on my boss and every year all the way up to 2016 It's a lot longer than I thought we went to that many anime.

970
01:07:29,174 --> 01:07:32,644
Speaker 0: Yeah the last I liked anime Boston.

971
01:07:32,684 --> 01:07:33,686
Speaker 0: I had a good time there.

972
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:37,678
Speaker 0: I would go to it still if it was not a slight hassle.

973
01:07:37,698 --> 01:07:42,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, and You know, like it's really good con.

974
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:43,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a really good time.

975
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:44,625
Speaker 1: It's partly that.

976
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:55,180
Speaker 1: one thing we did is when we first started geek nights We leaned heavily into anime and like we weren't like we got adjacent to a lot of real work in the anime industry in America.

977
01:07:56,682 --> 01:08:04,640
Speaker 1: We did not like pursue that and we actually doubled down hard over the last decade Into video games instead and that's kind of the main focus of geek nights like video games.

978
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:14,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think what happened was is that we had a stockpile of anime that we had seen and Comics that we had read already.

979
01:08:14,468 --> 01:08:24,365
Speaker 0: right that we could then do shows on But we were not reading and consuming new ones at a rate at which There were.

980
01:08:24,486 --> 01:08:26,979
Speaker 0: you know the rate at which you do geek nights episodes, right?

981
01:08:27,442 --> 01:08:43,171
Speaker 0: I'm not watching if I do a show every other week 26 anime series a year yeah, or 26 and new animated, you know, if you count movies and TV series and comic series Right or just comics in general.

982
01:08:44,317 --> 01:08:49,313
Speaker 0: I am NOT Reading or watching 26 new ones a year even if never

983
01:08:49,353 --> 01:08:57,993
Speaker 1: mind All the research and reading like part of the reason we were able to do so many things back then like the old decades as we did geek nights four nights a week and we spent

984
01:08:58,033 --> 01:08:58,939
Speaker 0: a lot of time on

985
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:05,456
Speaker 1: Like staying abreast of the global anime industry to be able to speak to it fluently.

986
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:16,979
Speaker 1: if we're gonna give a talk like research knowing things Can't keep that even do it that much other people did it way more than us Yeah, and gladly a lot of the people who were doing podcasts around the stuff in parallel with us.

987
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:22,796
Speaker 1: They doubled down on anime and moved into the anime industry like Mike tool big part of the American anime industry now.

988
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:30,023
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, it's like, you know back then I had like 50 anime series I had already seen.

989
01:09:30,064 --> 01:09:33,054
Speaker 0: so I can do 50 podcasts right out of nothing now.

990
01:09:33,134 --> 01:09:37,649
Speaker 0: I haven't seen 50 more Even if I had watched all of the.

991
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:40,640
Speaker 0: you know, everything on crunchyroll made full use of my crunchyroll subscription.

992
01:09:41,341 --> 01:09:41,643
Speaker 0: It's like.

993
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:44,380
Speaker 0: I don't still don't know if there would be enough for all these geek

994
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:46,046
Speaker 1: But also a lot

995
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:48,115
Speaker 0: of those I'm not gonna watch no matter what right,

996
01:09:48,336 --> 01:10:04,391
Speaker 1: but we also we Exhausted all of the low-hanging fruit of things We have like a crude knowledge about like the kinds of lectures we could give at anime cons are not that Informative to anyone who reads nowadays because people have caught up.

997
01:10:05,052 --> 01:10:07,620
Speaker 1: but video gaming we have a we continue to push forward.

998
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:11,617
Speaker 1: We're not really pushing anywhere but gaming right now because we had lives or never.

999
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:12,983
Speaker 1: almost 40.

1000
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:24,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think part of what it is also is that you know, if you if and in any area Right, there's sort of like big things that come out right no matter what the area of art or media is.

1001
01:10:25,423 --> 01:10:27,380
Speaker 0: You know if you're in sports, this is Super Bowl, right?

1002
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:32,420
Speaker 0: Even if you're like a hockey reporter Super Bowl is gonna enter into your article that week somehow, right?

1003
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:32,801
Speaker 0: What?

1004
01:10:32,841 --> 01:10:39,237
Speaker 0: what did the hockey players are watching the Super Bowl something like yeah You know, who are they betting on stuff like that?

1005
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:45,220
Speaker 0: But for us it's like, you know when it comes to anime there are certain anime series.

1006
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:46,767
Speaker 0: They're like the big anime series.

1007
01:10:46,787 --> 01:10:49,839
Speaker 0: what like there's some Demon Slayer thing is like the big thing now like that.

1008
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:53,145
Speaker 1: Well Attack on Titan is getting its final season Okay, but it's like.

1009
01:10:53,487 --> 01:11:00,787
Speaker 0: I guess we watched Attack on Titan when it was new But it's like used to be that we would watch all the big series that came out Even if they weren't our thing.

1010
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:02,275
Speaker 0: we watch full metal alchemist.

1011
01:11:02,455 --> 01:11:08,060
Speaker 1: we watch, you know We would watch shows to completion just to be able to speak to them and under and like learn about them.

1012
01:11:08,281 --> 01:11:10,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, I watched some Naruto, right?

1014
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:12,460
Speaker 1: you know, this is a broader trend and geek nights as a whole.

1015
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:17,625
Speaker 1: We used to do reviews of things we didn't like Like we give bad reviews of things.

1016
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:23,846
Speaker 1: We basically only review things we like nowadays because I'm not spending time on you know I'm not watching.

1017
01:11:23,866 --> 01:11:27,025
Speaker 0: I know not saying these things are bad I'm saying I haven't seen them right.

1018
01:11:27,085 --> 01:11:31,022
Speaker 0: but I know there are things that I know exist are big and I haven't seen them and Probably won't like.

1019
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:36,880
Speaker 0: you're my hero academia's right your your Demon Slayer's your Boruto's, right?

01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:41,540
Speaker 0: All these these like huge anime's that I know are huge anime's that people are talking about a whole bunch.

1021
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:50,041
Speaker 0: I'm probably never gonna watch a single episode of them ever right because they know what they are and I don't have time for that But I did.

1022
01:11:50,202 --> 01:11:55,068
Speaker 0: I have read all of one punch man, so that's that's definitely a 2010s explosion.

Speaker 0: bring on the one punch man.

1024
01:11:58,751 --> 01:12:05,860

1025
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,995

1026
01:12:10,055 --> 01:12:16,860
Speaker 1: I don't think we're gonna ever go to anime Conventions again, like we're not gonna be giving lectures and might be able to go to never go to one again.

1027
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:22,262
