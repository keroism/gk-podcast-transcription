5
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,536
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,303 --> 00:00:27,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're still stuck inside obviously.

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,345
Speaker 0: So a lot of the things like.

8
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,580
Speaker 0: we can't just talk about how we're biking cuz we're not like biking to work every day.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,125
Speaker 1: I could talk about how I'm biking.

10
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:36,374
Speaker 1: I just not going anywhere in one place without moving.

11
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,280
Speaker 0: Oh, you gotta get a new trainer.

12
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,512
Speaker 1: No, there's one in the in the the guy.

13
00:00:41,532 --> 00:00:42,637
Speaker 1: I'm in the building reopened.

14
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:45,667
Speaker 0: Oh I think we might have already talked about this.

15
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:49,718
Speaker 1: we did but something weird happened when I was biking without moving yesterday.

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:01:00,493
Speaker 1: Oh So, you know how sometimes right, you know, like the muscle in your leg will be like doink and it's like You know a cramp or a charlie horse or who the hell knows that's moving on.

17
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:01,135
Speaker 1: it hurts.

18
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,360
Speaker 1: It starts moving on its own.

19
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,284
Speaker 0: I know that feeling.

20
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,540
Speaker 1: you got to stretch it get it back into where it belongs, right?

21
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,098
Speaker 1: You know, who knows what the hell right?

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,310
Speaker 1: You know, usually when that happens, it's like well, I got a. I got to wait a while Can't really do anything if it's a charlie horse.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,919
Speaker 0: I got sort of the specific technique to undo it.

24
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:22,160
Speaker 1: Sometimes you look and you can even see like your leg going like blah blah blah or something.

25
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:26,800
Speaker 1: Anyway, that hasn't happened in a long as time, but it happened yesterday.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,851
Speaker 1: I am biking in one place and suddenly my left calf goes like doink, right?

27
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:32,937
Speaker 1: So I stopped paddling.

28
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:33,820
Speaker 0: It's like you do.

29
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:43,760
Speaker 1: My leg is attached to the thing right with the shoes, so I don't want to or I mess it up and Then somehow I managed to undo it very quickly.

30
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,047
Speaker 0: No, maybe you've learned the technique.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,231
Speaker 1: I don't know it.

32
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:48,597
Speaker 1: just undid very quickly, right?

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,791
Speaker 1: So I'm like hmm and a cautious sleeve pedal again, right?

34
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:54,534
Speaker 1: Like.

35
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:55,075
Speaker 1: is it gonna re?

36
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:56,440
Speaker 1: is it gonna re doink?

37
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,203
Speaker 1: I don't know.

38
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,670
Speaker 0: I know the fear of the re doing.

39
00:01:59,153 --> 00:01:59,233
Speaker 1: Yeah.

40
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:00,540
Speaker 1: I'm like, I don't you know.

41
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:04,783
Speaker 1: And It did not re doink.

42
00:02:05,866 --> 00:02:08,935
Speaker 1: and in fact, it felt like like the leg had leveled up.

43
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:12,642
Speaker 1: I was like what the fuck I was like Like.

44
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,788
Speaker 1: it felt better than pretty that it did pre doing.

45
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,200
Speaker 1: so I'm like a very brief doink that went away.

46
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,230
Speaker 1: So he's got more powerful now suddenly leveled up this leg.

47
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:23,972
Speaker 0: It's like burning.

48
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:27,040
Speaker 0: will you fail it leg enough and your leg just gets stronger?

49
00:02:27,803 --> 00:02:28,024
Speaker 1: I've got.

50
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:33,246
Speaker 1: I don't know what I think I just want to know what the medical explanation for that Cuz.

51
00:02:33,267 --> 00:02:34,158
Speaker 1: that's really strange.

52
00:02:34,963 --> 00:02:39,286
Speaker 0: Yep, so my only cuz I'm running a lot because of this Quarantine like.

53
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:41,319
Speaker 0: that's a really good just thing I can do outside.

54
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,940
Speaker 0: I can run where I don't really encounter people.

55
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:53,643
Speaker 0: But I've been trying to replace my running shoes every two or three hundred miles because that's what my doctor said to do to prevent problems because I'd had some problems because I run so Much and the doctor

56
00:02:53,683 --> 00:03:02,371
Speaker 1: rather the rim is found to do advanced technique rather than break his shit on purpose to excuse Consumerist material ways to buy new shit.

57
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,320
Speaker 1: with his vest hordes of money.

58
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,614
Speaker 1: He has now found a doctor to prescribe him to purchase new.

59
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:14,149
Speaker 0: I went to a doctor new physical therapist a while ago Like you're ago two years ago at this point.

60
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,960
Speaker 0: He's found a doctor who I got some.

61
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:23,820
Speaker 1: Give you permission to spend more money and indulge your consumerist materialist way.

62
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,447
Speaker 0: the doctor was literally I Solve you of your guilt.

63
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:27,331
Speaker 0: how much do you run?

64
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:31,779
Speaker 0: and I was like eh and then they were like How long you've been running in the shoes you own right now?

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,185
Speaker 0: How long have you owned them?

66
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,149
Speaker 0: you even know.

67
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,647
Speaker 0: and I was like, I don't know like three years and she was like I will bet you that is the problem.

68
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,494
Speaker 0: buy new shoes and I bet I'll never see you again.

69
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:43,025
Speaker 0: and the PT was like Yeah, buy new shoes.

70
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:44,431
Speaker 0: That is probably your problem.

71
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,580
Speaker 1: They're in there in the pocket of big shoes.

72
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:50,820
Speaker 0: So I did buy new shoes and it was like night and day and like I could even see my times.

73
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,207
Speaker 0: I see they have put you in the.

74
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,700
Speaker 1: I see they have taken you into their pocket of big shoe.

75
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:58,109
Speaker 0: It was more that for the longest time.

76
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,980
Speaker 0: My goal was I will wear shoes until they literally fall apart.

77
00:04:02,521 --> 00:04:03,344
Speaker 1: I have a shoe.

78
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:08,800
Speaker 1: I'll wear it until it is so dirty or broken in some way that it is not no longer wearable.

79
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:10,895
Speaker 0: So I plan to replace him like they said 200 miles.

80
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:15,205
Speaker 0: I was pushing it to like 300 400 like fine Whatever like.

81
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,777
Speaker 0: but I was only counting runs.

82
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:27,500
Speaker 0: I did with Strava and because I messed up my synchronization when I looked at the stats I wasn't counting like treadmill runs all the other stuff I do that I track else in other ways.

83
00:04:28,202 --> 00:04:31,413
Speaker 0: So I thought I had some shoes that I'd run like 300 ish 400 ish miles in.

84
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:36,912
Speaker 0: no I'd run over 800 miles in those shoes.

85
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,959
Speaker 1: Well, did you get any problems?

86
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:46,940
Speaker 0: Yep I was actually having some Sciatic problems on one side and also my feet were starting to give me some plantar fasciitis adjacent problems again.

87
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:49,079
Speaker 0: So I got new shoes did some runs.

88
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,793
Speaker 0: My times were way better with the new shoes.

89
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,080
Speaker 0: They feel completely different.

90
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:59,584
Speaker 0: I actually put him side by side and I tried to measure the inside the shoes I had been wearing.

91
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:02,835
Speaker 0: the padding inside was half a centimeter thinner.

92
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:04,199
Speaker 0: It had been compressed that much.

93
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,139
Speaker 1: Well, it's got to be the shoes.

94
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:07,626
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see.

95
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:12,184
Speaker 0: it seems like all my problems have gone away once again Not only about new shoes.

96
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:15,597
Speaker 1: all this means apparently you don't know the meaning of it's got to be the shoes.

97
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:22,740
Speaker 0: Yeah In this case, it seems like it literally has to be the shoes but Google Google for it's got to be.

98
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:31,187
Speaker 0: So it is anime day and one thing we want to talk about really briefly because it Ends on the 30th.

99
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,253
Speaker 0: Today is the 24th.

100
00:05:32,294 --> 00:05:33,159
Speaker 0: There's still time.

101
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,300
Speaker 0: Annecy the the animation festival went online this year.

102
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,527
Speaker 0: I think we talked to me mentioned this a few times right?

103
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:48,000
Speaker 1: if you don't know Annecy is basically, you know film festival wise Right, you know we're talking like, you know con like film festival, right?

104
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,927
Speaker 1: Yeah for animation is pretty much the world's number one animation Specific film festival, right?

105
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,975
Speaker 1: There are other ones for example in New York.

106
00:05:57,015 --> 00:06:00,607
Speaker 1: We always go to the New York International children's film festival.

107
00:06:00,767 --> 00:06:03,095
Speaker 1: that is a children's film festival.

108
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,760
Speaker 1: It's not an animation film festival.

109
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,238
Speaker 1: It just happens to include cement a lot of animation because it's a children's film festival, right?

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:16,220
Speaker 1: Annecy is basically the number one premier world Animation film festival, right?

111
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,756
Speaker 1: So if you submit your animation there and get it in and win that's a big fucking deal you get.

112
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,750
Speaker 1: so when you put out Your DVD you can put some little some little.

113
00:06:23,971 --> 00:06:25,015
Speaker 1: uh, what are they called?

114
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:25,879
Speaker 1: You know?

115
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:29,733
Speaker 1: The little the the ferns with some words in between.

116
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:31,320
Speaker 0: oh just get an award.

117
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:42,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, yeah, we buy a DVD and there's like all those little fern thingies Looks like the Caesars crown or whatever You know with some gold text in there that says winner Annecy 20, right?

118
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Speaker 1: So normally to go to Annecy which by the way is named after like most conventions in Europe like, you know Say Essen which takes place in Essen Annecy takes place in Annecy France.

119
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:56,760
Speaker 1: So if you want to go to Annecy and see the animations in Annecy, you'd have to go to Annecy.

120
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,580
Speaker 0: Yep, I don't plan to go to the city of Otacon anytime in the near future?

121
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I'm saying is Annecy is not.

122
00:07:03,472 --> 00:07:04,235
Speaker 1: so, you know, it's like.

123
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,931
Speaker 1: I'd probably like to go there But I don't see that on my horizon, right?

124
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:14,898
Speaker 1: Well currently definitely not Yeah, so I didn't see it in my past either not even once that haven't been to France or Europe.

125
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:20,349
Speaker 1: So Yeah So I've never been able to see the works of.

126
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:25,590
Speaker 1: Anna said there were shown at Annecy with any amount of ease unless they Were shown somewhere else like you

127
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,320
Speaker 0: get like a lot of times like goblin stuff Like you'll find YouTube channels where they post it like you could poke around but you definitely wouldn't get this full program by any stretch

128
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:33,843
Speaker 1: Right.

129
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:44,788
Speaker 1: So thanks to the physical Annecy being canceled they put it online and for 15 euro you can go to the Annecy online website and See all the films that would have.

130
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:49,786
Speaker 1: you would have been able to see if you went to Annecy only From your house, which is great.

131
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:50,971
Speaker 0: There's some good stuff in there.

132
00:07:51,192 --> 00:07:53,059
Speaker 1: The website's a little bit mad, but it works.

133
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:54,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got subtitles.

134
00:07:54,425 --> 00:07:59,659
Speaker 0: I think it was like a limited access Netflix that has a whole bunch of stuff You're not gonna be able to see anywhere else.

135
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:15,138
Speaker 1: The only problem is that there were some things that they were going to show at Annecy notably the Lupin the third CG movie that's coming and Because it's online they said well, you know, you're online the whole world can watch this 15 euro.

136
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:18,570
Speaker 1: We can't really put the whole movie right.

137
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,991
Speaker 1: if it was at Annecy physically in a theater They would have shown the whole movie.

138
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:27,197
Speaker 0: but because it's online They're like, oh that is showing that the segment is often even at the physical film festivals.

139
00:08:27,217 --> 00:08:28,578
Speaker 0: That's the thing That's it.

140
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,860
Speaker 1: But in this case they did yeah, they were gonna show the whole thing.

141
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:39,294
Speaker 1: but instead Because it's online for only 15 euro Just showed some of the feature films most of the feature films.

142
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,407
Speaker 1: they're not showing the whole movie They're only showing 15 minute.

143
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,800
Speaker 1: Like you're getting the intro part of the movie, right?

144
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,964
Speaker 0: The thing I can say about that Lupin film though is that I can't review it as a Lupin movie because you have to see The whole thing to know.

145
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:54,180
Speaker 0: I've only seen the beginning but the animation looks a-plus like it looks great.

146
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,153
Speaker 1: It looks like it looks like a Lupin movie.

147
00:08:56,173 --> 00:08:57,120
Speaker 1: It's that's I want to watch it.

148
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:16,504
Speaker 0: Yep, and I get the impression if I had to guess based on the little bit I've seen it is a like Completely generic Lupin Reminiscent of like the era of Lupin that Scott and I have talked about a lot like those movies that were okay Not great not terrible not the like later 2000s Lupin's.

149
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:20,777
Speaker 1: it appears to be a well based on the 15-minute segment.

150
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:28,940
Speaker 1: We saw a extremely well-crafted But completely by the book Lupin movie, which is who doesn't want that?

151
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, so maybe like around the level of a Fuma conspiracy in terms of like quality as a Lupin I don't know.

152
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:36,044
Speaker 1: Fuma conspiracy.

153
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,569
Speaker 1: It's something special going on.

154
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,613
Speaker 0: Fuma conspiracy had.

155
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:44,480
Speaker 0: there's there's generic Lupin There's generic Lupin with one twist and then there's bad Lupin.

156
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,271
Speaker 1: Anyway, I've watched all of the official.

157
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:54,007
Speaker 1: oh, there's also some work-in-progress Things.

158
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,980
Speaker 0: oh my god, the wolf walkers one.

159
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,763
Speaker 0: You can see.

160
00:09:56,783 --> 00:10:03,952
Speaker 1: there's a long segment about wolf walkers and a long segment about Inoue Which is Yuasa's next movie coming next year.

161
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:04,815
Speaker 0: I didn't fit it watch the.

162
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,060
Speaker 0: you know, you know one.

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I will say is the wolf walkers one.

164
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,454
Speaker 0: I was already at maximum.

165
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:10,519
Speaker 0: Hype for wolf walkers.

166
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:22,100
Speaker 0: But somehow after watching that especially when the animators talked about how they drew the town versus how they drew the forest I'm at a hundred and ten percent now, right?

167
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,251
Speaker 0: I am more hyped for a movie that I'm already maximum hype for.

168
00:10:25,652 --> 00:10:26,294
Speaker 1: they're showing you.

169
00:10:26,355 --> 00:10:27,860
Speaker 1: It's basically those are works in progress.

170
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,359
Speaker 1: They're basically somewhat sort of mini documentary behind-the-scenes interview things where they're showing you what they're working on and how they made it.

171
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:41,947
Speaker 1: And then there's all the different short animations that are in the competition And they're split into different segments.

172
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:45,600
Speaker 1: There's children's ones graduation ones, which I presume are student films.

173
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:49,540
Speaker 1: There are these perspectives ones which I don't know what the deal is with those.

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,550
Speaker 1: Maybe they're ones that have like something to say and watch those.

175
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,560
Speaker 0: what I'd recommend is don't try to unless you're like an animator.

176
00:10:55,881 --> 00:11:01,382
Speaker 0: I wouldn't recommend going to the like buying this thing going in and just trying to watch literally everything in the order It's presented.

177
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:02,005
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

178
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:02,828
Speaker 1: I watched literally.

179
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:04,414
Speaker 1: I watched literally everything in the order.

180
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:13,630
Speaker 1: It's presented in the official Right, which is the like, you know the ones that are trying, you know I guess they're just shorts submitted for the official competition.

181
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,179
Speaker 1: There are official selections of the whatever.

182
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:19,440
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't know what determines what goes into my category.

183
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,100
Speaker 1: But that was the biggest category of short animated films and I watched every single one.

184
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:26,500
Speaker 0: But you've got until the 30th Tuesday next week.

185
00:11:26,621 --> 00:11:35,579
Speaker 0: So even though this has been going on for a while already 15 euros for basically almost a week's worth of access to this thing if you buy it today still worth it.

186
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,960
Speaker 1: Think of it like a temporary Netflix with special stuff in it that will go away on the 30th with like, you know, so it's like.

187
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:43,548
Speaker 1: It's like.

188
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:43,993
Speaker 1: why not?

189
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:47,093
Speaker 1: Yeah So this stuff isn't available anywhere else.

190
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:56,553
Speaker 0: So in some other news This movie wasn't on a lot of people's radar for some reason, but it's just out on Netflix like as of last week I want to say June 18th.

191
00:11:56,614 --> 00:11:57,219
Speaker 0: It was released.

192
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,073
Speaker 0: It's Junichi Sato's a whisker away.

193
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:02,460
Speaker 0: the trailer looks good.

194
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:12,601
Speaker 0: It's basically about a girl who well vaguely It's a trailer and the movie obviously has a lot of allegory and metaphor a girl who likes a boy and turns into a cat To be with him.

195
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:18,070
Speaker 1: I think I heard that story, but I didn't hear the title or that it was a Netflix thing.

196
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:21,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, the literal translation of the title is something like wanting to cry.

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,839
Speaker 0: I pretend to be a cat but okay What are we always saying when it comes to it?

198
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:26,765
Speaker 1: You want did you watch it?

199
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:27,229
Speaker 0: Not yet?

200
00:12:28,051 --> 00:12:39,150
Speaker 0: Okay, but what I will say is that it's on Netflix like right now We always say if there's an anime movie that is not a sequel to an existing IP You should pretty much just watch it if you have access to it.

201
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,100
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna say you should probably just watch this.

202
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:45,370
Speaker 0: We're going to watch it at some point soon and do a review on it I'm sure.

203
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:49,185
Speaker 0: But I didn't realize like I forgot Junichi Sato.

204
00:12:49,205 --> 00:12:59,000
Speaker 0: Uh So none of you will care except like one of you maybe that I guess he directed slayers premium Which is the last of the slayers.

205
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:07,839
Speaker 0: like quote unquote movies Okay, but more importantly he's the mahout sky tie guy Okay, magic users Club.

206
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:13,526
Speaker 0: So based on the trailer I think this movie is gonna be pretty good and I've seen pretty good reviews of it already.

207
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:15,644
Speaker 1: Oh Sounds good.

208
00:13:15,785 --> 00:13:16,008
Speaker 0: Yeah

209
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:30,970
Speaker 1: Alright, so since I've been trapped at home This giant wall of comics behind me right with most of which I've read in my life But some of which I have not had the time to read I've been able to get to spend time reading it because I'm not doing anything.

210
00:13:32,073 --> 00:13:40,925
Speaker 1: So I read all Twelve well twelve omnibus volumes of lone wolf and cub.

211
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:47,396
Speaker 1: each one of those is like You know three to five Smaller volumes worth right?

212
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:52,490
Speaker 1: Who knows how many but basically I read all of lone wolf and cub from those dark horse editions.

213
00:13:52,972 --> 00:14:02,715
Speaker 1: Oh, I have not read all of lone wolf and cub by even up right and seeing how that's rims probably unlikely to do So anytime in the near future Just getting geeked by it.

214
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:04,341
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously it's legendary.

215
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,490
Speaker 1: Do you really need someone to tell you that you should read it?

216
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,576
Speaker 1: No, that's why I read it.

217
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,650
Speaker 0: I guess I could bike over there with a backpack.

218
00:14:11,052 --> 00:14:11,596
Speaker 1: Good luck.

219
00:14:11,657 --> 00:14:13,430
Speaker 1: It'll take you a while this long.

220
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,317
Speaker 1: So, what's the deal with lone wolf and cub?

221
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:20,127
Speaker 1: obviously it's a samurai story, right?

222
00:14:21,932 --> 00:14:27,275
Speaker 1: you know nerds have seen the Mandalorian and It's a lot better than that.

223
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a samurai in themes And he is the shogun's executioner, right?

224
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:46,062
Speaker 1: But then the basically another group right in the another clan Wants, you know someone from their clan to be in that position.

225
00:14:46,563 --> 00:14:48,470
Speaker 1: So they do him dirty, right?

226
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,502
Speaker 1: And he is a master of you know, the sword Lee arts.

227
00:14:52,743 --> 00:15:05,830
Speaker 1: So no one can really mess with him and His wife dies and he just had this kid and he's you know, the kid basically is Not old enough to talk real, right?

228
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:17,309
Speaker 1: He's like, you know, basically zero but the kid decides to Go with the dead on their their journey through me fumado, which is the Buddhist hell.

229
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:35,050
Speaker 1: rather than Be killed by his father mercifully He takes the kid with him on the journey throughout Japan and basically most of the chapters are Episodic, you know situations they get caught in right on their journey around Japan.

230
00:15:36,652 --> 00:15:45,426
Speaker 1: But all of these little you know episodes encountering different people and their troubles and whatnot Right are tied together by the larger plot of.

231
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:52,430
Speaker 1: you know Lone wolf in club versus right that clan that did them dirty at the beginning, right?

232
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:59,850
Speaker 1: And you know people who are who act in honorable samurai ways and those who don't right?

233
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:02,521
Speaker 1: and such and such.

234
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:07,429
Speaker 1: so it's Unlike other works of.

235
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:11,897
Speaker 1: You know What's his name Oh Kazuo?

236
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:12,279
Speaker 1: Okay.

237
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,542
Speaker 0: I was about to say Kazuo.

238
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:14,004
Speaker 0: Okay.

239
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:15,067
Speaker 0: Is that what you're fumbling for?

240
00:16:15,368 --> 00:16:18,417
Speaker 1: Yeah that guy unlike other Kazuko IK works.

241
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:30,310
Speaker 1: it does not get as crazy and The sex and violence like in a crying Freeman sort of way, but there's plenty of sex and there is no shortage.

242
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:34,856
Speaker 1: It's just not as ridiculous At all times right?

243
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:42,169
Speaker 1: It is only ridiculous seemingly like when it's appropriate for it to be so When when it you know the situation demands, right?

244
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:56,389
Speaker 1: But yeah if you're wondering why you know all those other people Who are so inspired by lone wolf and cub right to to make samurai things and and?

245
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,757
Speaker 1: Appropriative works in the West right.

246
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,906
Speaker 1: you can find out pretty easily just by reading all of this.

247
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,270
Speaker 1: it is well worth your time.

248
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:08,549
Speaker 0: I was looking to see if we've ever actually reviewed it because I've read like the first volume.

249
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:22,846
Speaker 1: Beyond that you know it does come to an end although towards the end It sort of devolves a little bit and like for briefly for a few chapters It goes sort of like away from lone wolf and cub to like these other sort of like.

250
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:34,166
Speaker 1: it feels like time-killing Episodes showing you some other people mm-hmm, but then it actually comes together At the end and there's a big dramatic ending.

251
00:17:34,206 --> 00:17:38,570
Speaker 1: it was well Timed and nope at no point does it feel like it's dragging on.

252
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:40,474
Speaker 0: That's a good sign.

253
00:17:40,936 --> 00:17:47,865
Speaker 1: You know towards the middle there is sort of like a dramatic confrontation And that dramatic confrontation does not finish things right.

254
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:53,470
Speaker 1: so then they have to sort of Do it go all through a whole nother rigamarole before you can get to the final battle.

255
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,102
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like fists of the North Star does the same thing right?

256
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:57,047
Speaker 1: you see it a lot where it's like.

257
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:03,430
Speaker 1: you know It's like it fights row in fists of the North Star like somewhere towards the middle of the story.

258
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:14,927
Speaker 1: Right and they fight a whole bunch But not enough to finish things right and then they have to continue later And then it goes through a whole nother series of stuff, and then the final battle right.

259
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:15,949
Speaker 1: so it's the same thing here.

260
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:23,382
Speaker 1: And lone wolf income right the these fight the end boss You got you can't finish things you come back and fight the end boss again.

261
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:28,260
Speaker 0: Yep, so apparently in July of last year What we were talking about a star is on my.

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,448
Speaker 0: but in the middle of that we apparently Mentioned lone wolf and cub and repeatedly told people they need to read it.

263
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:39,026
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you it's like you know in terms of samurai stuff.

264
00:18:39,086 --> 00:18:42,145
Speaker 1: It's pretty much like You know it.

265
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,699
Speaker 1: this Right it's like the best samurai comic.

266
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:48,570
Speaker 1: There is you know if you like samurai movies?

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,750
Speaker 0: but anyway things Of the day, so I don't know if any of you have ever heard of garum, but garum is our masala powder g-a-r-u-m.

268
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:15,681
Speaker 0: it is a Basically a common table condiment from the era of ancient Rome like it was one of the most pot like it was the ketchup of Rome.

269
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,456
Speaker 1: basically I guess yeah, I guess they didn't have Heinz 57 varieties in Rome.

270
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I mean think of this.

271
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:22,319
Speaker 0: did they have tomatoes?

272
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:27,419
Speaker 0: Some of you might be surprised by the answer if you didn't learn anything about history, but I digress.

273
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:32,927
Speaker 0: so garum is Not common anymore.

274
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,759
Speaker 0: those things that are very similar to it are common common.

275
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:40,174
Speaker 0: It's basically like a fish sauce like a fermented fish sauce.

276
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:41,559
Speaker 0: There's a lot of fermented sauce on it.

277
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:47,394
Speaker 0: Yeah But garum is a particular method of making fish sauce that was used in Rome.

278
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:53,088
Speaker 0: that makes a particularly salty watery form of this and You can buy.

279
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:57,880
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of people who sell garum But supposedly it's not quite the same as what people would have eaten in Rome.

280
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:01,920
Speaker 1: So this is try cuz you don't want to eat something that's the same of what they eat in Rome.

281
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, just what you just want the the good essence of it right what they probably had in Rome is probably like you.

282
00:20:07,722 --> 00:20:20,824
Speaker 0: Yep, well, it's like old IPAs like yeah You can drink in an IPA beer that is authentic to what beer tasted like made in that way and transported in that way in That era would not recommend it Unless you're a historian.

283
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:28,559
Speaker 0: So in this case this dude who seems to know a lot about like food history And like his whole channel seems to be about this.

284
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,760
Speaker 0: Basically, just like explains the whole deal with garum make some and then tries it.

285
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,752
Speaker 0: He sips a little bit and tries to cook with it.

286
00:20:37,959 --> 00:20:40,810
Speaker 0: Uh I don't know if I want to try garum per se.

287
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:45,427
Speaker 0: I get the impression that it tastes like Drinking like.

288
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,581
Speaker 0: it tastes like roe like just fish roe Any.

289
00:20:48,681 --> 00:21:00,920
Speaker 1: I got the impression from the video that it's because I saw the video also that it tastes like fishy salt water like The way the ocean smells when you're driving your car to the beach and it's a really kind of low tide kind of stank.

290
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:10,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, right you get that strong Ocean smell that you get right not from like the beautiful oceans where it's clear water But from like, you know, the New Jersey Ocean, right?

291
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:13,579
Speaker 1: Yep, and I imagine it smells like drinking that like a face full of it.

292
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:23,732
Speaker 0: Yep, but if anything else this video is worth watching because you actually get a lot of history about like how Condiments were used in ancient Rome and it's actually pretty fascinating.

293
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:25,700
Speaker 1: I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right?

294
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,964
Speaker 1: Salt makes things taste good.

295
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:32,000
Speaker 1: So I don't imagine they had like, you know, diamond crystal table salt in Rome, right?

296
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,220
Speaker 1: So splashing some salty fishy water on your food probably made it taste really.

297
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:40,912
Speaker 0: Places that evolved that developed salt mining had salt a lot earlier.

298
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:54,676
Speaker 0: other places like salt was still very common, but the salt mining or Salination old salt collection was I don't know Extremely labor-intensive and kind of just involved collecting seawater and letting it dry out.

299
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:58,419
Speaker 0: Yep So what do you got?

300
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,463
Speaker 1: Oh Thing of the day.

301
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, so way back in the day.

302
00:22:01,771 --> 00:22:02,534
Speaker 1: Let me click on this.

303
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:07,701
Speaker 1: I get the exact year here 1986 I think Right in 1986.

304
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,484
Speaker 1: There was an article in New type magazine.

305
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,169
Speaker 0: Oh your grand prophecy of anime.

306
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:15,413
Speaker 0: 86, right?

307
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:17,540
Speaker 1: Yes, and they asked a bunch of different.

308
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:19,904
Speaker 1: Consider it right.

309
00:22:20,185 --> 00:22:28,114
Speaker 1: they asked 21 anime industry leaders including Miyazaki Isao Takahata Mamoru.

310
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:36,760
Speaker 1: Oh, she Right all these like big-time anime people right from the day and they asked him their feelings on.

311
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:43,320
Speaker 1: You know the anime industry like what was going on in 1986 and they published it in new type magazine.

312
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,894
Speaker 1: They put the person's picture with a bunch of text next to it.

313
00:22:45,914 --> 00:22:48,860
Speaker 1: Just you know, hey How do you feel about the anime industry these days?

314
00:22:49,160 --> 00:23:04,644
Speaker 1: everyone was really honest and open and let loose their gripes or positive feelings and Seven years ago the old type new type person At least if this article was posted Recent when was?

315
00:23:04,664 --> 00:23:06,290
Speaker 1: that was the date when they posted this?

316
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,197
Speaker 1: regardless some years ago, right?

317
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,227
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It's only posted a week ago.

318
00:23:10,851 --> 00:23:12,340
Speaker 0: Well, some of these are pretty brutal.

319
00:23:13,003 --> 00:23:17,040
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the person who runs if you don't know Takahata seems pissed in particular.

320
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an.

321
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:24,780
Speaker 1: there's a. there's a tumblr called old type new type where this person publishes a scans from old new type magazines.

322
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:46,573
Speaker 1: But they because this one is so interesting they paid someone to translate the whole article some years ago and the translation is here underneath the images of the article and you can see exactly how the top people in the anime industry felt about the anime industry in 86 and You can now apply your knowledge of things that have happened in the past 24 34 years 34 years.

323
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:52,646
Speaker 0: Just talk on.

324
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:58,700
Speaker 0: I think now it is the thing a lot of people working in anime forgotten is the excitement They felt watching adventure movies when they were kids.

325
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:03,347
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm He goes this I'm gonna read this whole thing.

Speaker 0: we're forgetting something That about it.

345
00:25:14,964 --> 00:25:15,846
Speaker 1: There's not much going on.

346
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:16,426
Speaker 1: Yeah.

347
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:19,290
Speaker 0: So one thing that's particularly not going on.

348
00:25:19,512 --> 00:25:20,969
Speaker 0: I don't know how long we'll actually talk about this.

349
00:25:21,993 --> 00:25:25,290
Speaker 0: You know, we used to go to a lot of anime cons like we got no other topic.

350
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:25,956
Speaker 1: That's why we're doing.

351
00:25:25,997 --> 00:25:34,340
Speaker 0: I was looking at old gig nights Like there is an era where we would do like three Separate Wednesday shows over the course of three weeks.

352
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,905
Speaker 0: because remember we used to go four nights a week.

353
00:25:36,346 --> 00:25:51,050
Speaker 0: that were literally called Otakon preview part 1 Otakon preview part 2 Otakon preview part 3. then we go to Otakon and then we had Otakon the review and then we had Otakon the review part 2.

354
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,221
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it wasn't three previews.

355
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,970
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was like one preview.

356
00:25:55,352 --> 00:25:56,960
Speaker 0: I'll find the exact one.

357
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:57,523
Speaker 0: I looked at.

358
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 1: you're exaggerating a little bit.

359
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,373
Speaker 1: I think it's like.

360
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:03,453
Speaker 1: I think it's like Otakon preview and then like Otakon part 1 Otakon part 2.

361
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:04,502
Speaker 0: Let's see it will.

362
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,249
Speaker 0: so we did.

363
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:08,684
Speaker 0: Otakon 2006 was the one we did the most.

364
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:18,456
Speaker 0: we did Otakon preview Otakon 2006 part 1 Otakon 2006 part 2 and live at Otakon 2006 where we recorded something.

365
00:26:18,757 --> 00:26:22,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there weren't three previews that you just exaggerated right anyway.

366
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:24,315
Speaker 1: But yeah, we used to do.

367
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:29,070
Speaker 1: we used to break up, you know episodes on conventions and do a whole bunch of stuff, right?

368
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,249
Speaker 0: We did two different previews for a PAX once but they were on two different things.

369
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:47,870
Speaker 0: That was back in 2009 I think anyway We used to go to a lot of anime cons and we kept going to anime cons until a while ago when anime Boston was Kind of the last one we did and then we dropped out of that for reasons We've talked about don't really go to a lot of anime cons anymore.

370
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:54,090
Speaker 0: But anime cons were still trucking along like Otakon despite moving losing it make on stellar trucking along.

371
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:58,042
Speaker 0: Yeah, like anime Boston despite all its problems is still one of the best run anime cons.

372
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,969
Speaker 0: It's huge anime NYC.

373
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:02,981
Speaker 0: every year We want to go but it usually overlaps with something else.

374
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:06,117
Speaker 0: We're already committed to and we just don't go This year.

375
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:13,758
Speaker 0: it won't happen, obviously but Basically yawning on Sleepy sleepy time sleepy, baby.

376
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,569
Speaker 1: I guess I'd need a nap after this.

377
00:27:24,695 --> 00:27:30,369
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Video game cons and generic cons like kinetic ons doing an online thing.

378
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:36,670
Speaker 0: Bunch of gaming cons to do an online things packs is doing an official like big-money packs online.

379
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:41,349
Speaker 0: But you're not seeing as many Online anime cons.

380
00:27:42,214 --> 00:27:43,469
Speaker 1: And why do that are happening?

381
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,310
Speaker 0: Not that big and I'm not gonna name names in any of these cons, but a few that have happened have not gone.

382
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,535
Speaker 0: Well, right.

383
00:27:50,575 --> 00:27:51,238
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

384
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:52,944
Speaker 1: So what does an anime con have right?

385
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,874
Speaker 1: It has a a Dealers room.

386
00:27:55,095 --> 00:28:02,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, so for a dealers room to go online All those stores you see at a dealers room are typically have online stores 24 365 days a year.

387
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:11,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, yep, like going to an anime con is mostly for them to offload merch that isn't moving otherwise to an impulse buying audience.

388
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:18,330
Speaker 1: Alright, so it's like if you just want to shop for anime shit, you could do that online even pre pandemic, you know.

389
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,817
Speaker 1: So there's.

390
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:28,996
Speaker 1: no you can't really replicate the dealers room online other than What make a web page that lists what who would have been the dealers and so you can click through and go to their stores In case you didn't know.

391
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:31,109
Speaker 1: it's like it's not something you buy a ticket for.

392
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:35,822
Speaker 0: But also a lot of the people are buying stuff at anime con dealers room.

393
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:42,006
Speaker 0: in particular they're they're buying swords, which Okay, I feel like I saw it online bro.

394
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:55,790
Speaker 0: Exactly I feel like that is a like the the epitome of an impulse buy and I feel like a lot of those Sword purchases happen because the parents is not there at that exact moment, but the kid was given money to buy shit at the con.

395
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:02,650
Speaker 0: But anyway, everything else at the dealers room Usually you can buy online cheaper anyway.

396
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:11,450
Speaker 0: like sometimes usually It's very rare that there are exclusive things that an anime con dealers room that you could not have purchased online.

397
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 0: You might just not have thought to purchase it online unless you were in the context of an anime con walk by a booth.

398
00:29:17,871 --> 00:29:18,254
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

399
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:22,985
Speaker 1: It fits to the North Star book and I wouldn't think to buy a sword But suddenly there's a sword store in front of me.

400
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:29,572
Speaker 0: Yep I mean it takes me effort even in it when I would go to anime cons to not buy things that I see That.

401
00:29:29,613 --> 00:29:33,125
Speaker 1: so the biggest room at the anime con can't really isn't really point.

402
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,690
Speaker 1: There's no point in having it online, right?

403
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,417
Speaker 1: Okay, so the second biggest room is the artist alley.

404
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:39,650
Speaker 1: So the artist alley you also can buy all that stuff online.

405
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,450
Speaker 1: Well, all those artists have web pages.

406
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,575
Speaker 0: This is where it gets tricky.

407
00:29:42,996 --> 00:29:44,603
Speaker 0: artist bodies drive moves to.

408
00:29:44,643 --> 00:29:51,930
Speaker 0: their sales are impulse buys Especially of things that are not available online often because of copyright issues, right?

409
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:52,876
Speaker 1: So you're you're.

410
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:55,050
Speaker 1: you could go to any of those people in artist alley.

411
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,210
Speaker 1: They all have their own website so they sell stuff, right?

412
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,478
Speaker 1: You can buy their merch whenever you want.

413
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,541
Speaker 1: They're happy to sell it to you.

414
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,210
Speaker 1: In fact, you know, they all have online shops, right?

415
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:06,397
Speaker 1: So what do you go artist alley for?

416
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:09,169
Speaker 1: like rim said all their fan arts and things.

417
00:30:09,531 --> 00:30:16,883
Speaker 1: They're probably not selling them online because they can't because the online store will say hey You can't sell your drawing of Mickey Mouse.

418
00:30:16,943 --> 00:30:18,572
Speaker 1: That's Disney.

419
00:30:18,632 --> 00:30:29,047
Speaker 0: a lot of fan art and an artist alleys just gets under the line just because no one cares enough to go deal with In person at the event and even in the event that happens sometimes online.

420
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:29,790
Speaker 0: you're just screwed.

421
00:30:30,512 --> 00:30:38,747
Speaker 1: so the the advantage of the artist alley is there are things for sale there that you can't buy online and Putting your anime con online doesn't fix that.

422
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:48,669
Speaker 0: Yep And I think the other advantage is literally just the impulse buys again Which if there's if something is just available as a store online You're not gonna get nearly as much of that.

423
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,073
Speaker 0: Oh That's a cool thing.

424
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:56,928
Speaker 0: immediately purchase it when I saw it because if you didn't go seek it out and find it online Previously you're not gonna suddenly do it now.

425
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:16,941
Speaker 0: I saw a lot of cons tried to do a thing where they did like a limited time virtual artist alley online where like Artists put up all their stuff and they all agree that it'll be exclusive to this online event Like this stuff lonely bees for sale for this time to try to get a lot of eyes on them all at the same time To drive that impulse by.

426
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:27,288
Speaker 0: I don't have any data But I don't think a huge amount of sales happen because of that except for the very first Handful of anime cons that did something like that.

427
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,420
Speaker 1: I don't think that sustains right because without the physicals.

428
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:37,404
Speaker 1: because what a convention does to make money right or to make at least customers if it's not a for-profit convention right is?

429
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:42,870
Speaker 1: it handles the Logistics of the the space the time.

430
00:31:43,532 --> 00:31:44,295
Speaker 1: You know the.

431
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:48,850
Speaker 1: you know the the water and the panel rooms the technology right the facilities.

432
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,237
Speaker 1: That is the work that a convention does.

433
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:53,243
Speaker 1: all the content at the convention is just.

434
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:56,859
Speaker 1: you know content at the convention that they've brought Together right.

435
00:31:57,121 --> 00:32:01,559
Speaker 1: so when you're online You're not doing any of this facilities work right.

436
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,263
Speaker 1: that work is no longer necessary.

437
00:32:03,303 --> 00:32:04,286
Speaker 1: There's just internet work.

438
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:05,609
Speaker 1: Which is a lot less work.

439
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:11,350
Speaker 1: So all the convention has to offer is its brand and marketing power.

440
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:22,814
Speaker 1: But the thing is conventions don't have internet brand and marketing power especially not anime ones because like you know They're the online followings of conventions are like Super small.

441
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:29,375
Speaker 1: you show up at a convention and these most of the people there never went to the conventions website You know didn't even know.

442
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:34,370
Speaker 1: they like they do follow the convention on Twitter deck like more than a decade of experience.

443
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,120
Speaker 1: They're not in the conventions forum right there nothing.

444
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:44,067
Speaker 1: all they did is figure out okay the conventions happening They bought a ticket, and they never interact with the convention in any way whatsoever online at all.

445
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:53,190
Speaker 1: right They just buy a ticket and show up, and that's all the old the extent of the interaction They have with the convention as an organization.

446
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:56,459
Speaker 0: Yeah But the showing up is the part that they're paying for.

447
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:11,650
Speaker 0: because what an anime counter really does at least in America Like its primary purpose is all these people are into anime and interact with each other online Want to for a weekend be unsupervised and physically in the same place to get up to shenanigans.

448
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:15,542
Speaker 0: That is the primary draw of anime cons and has been the next big.

449
00:33:15,562 --> 00:33:25,770
Speaker 1: the next biggest thing the anime cons have are like main events which are like cosplay contests yeah, or You know anime chess kind of thing.

450
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,420
Speaker 1: All that's main event stuff.

451
00:33:28,581 --> 00:33:34,221
Speaker 0: right those things like one Those are already streamed online and almost no one watches them.

452
00:33:34,421 --> 00:33:42,313
Speaker 0: the audience at the con is almost always bigger than the streaming audience Because those events are not usually Good enough.

453
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:49,870
Speaker 0: or even if the content is good enough the quality of the filming and production values is not good enough to convey that Feeling to the people who are watching online.

454
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:55,350
Speaker 0: So it's an inferior experience to the point that people don't bother and people want to participate in it.

455
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,487
Speaker 0: They want to yell and scream they want to get called up.

456
00:33:57,587 --> 00:34:01,849
Speaker 1: also You can't participate in it in your if you're cosplaying at your house.

457
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:05,750
Speaker 1: Yep, you need it's cosplay as people coming together for those things, right?

458
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:09,985
Speaker 1: It's like if people can cosplay at their house alone, but they could do that.

459
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:10,628
Speaker 1: Anyway.

460
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,704
Speaker 0: Yep I've seen cons tried to do the same thing.

461
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:16,184
Speaker 0: like they're Sally They try to put together like a hashtag or a costume contest.

462
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:21,565
Speaker 1: like everyone submit a video everyone's like sir doesn't work because what the cosplay thing conventions is.

463
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:29,469
Speaker 1: the Cosplayers get lots of attention from people that they can see and you're not just standing there in front of a camera They do it that on twitch every day.

464
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:34,364
Speaker 0: Yeah most cosplayers or pros don't actually like they're not really there to be in the contest.

465
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,536
Speaker 0: so much as they're there to show off their Cut their costume.

466
00:34:36,556 --> 00:34:38,150
Speaker 0: you're getting out with people in there.

467
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,469
Speaker 1: Can you're getting several photographers who are showing up with their own volition to come around and photograph several cosplay people?

468
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,690
Speaker 1: It's like well if you're a photographer, it's like well the photography has already been done.

469
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,527
Speaker 1: You're already looking what a camera sees right because it's online.

470
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,824
Speaker 1: Yep You're looking at the camera of that the web the cosplayer has.

471
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,186
Speaker 1: right.

472
00:34:56,206 --> 00:35:09,930
Speaker 0: you're not going to the house yeah, so the whole photography aspect is just completely out and I feel like the cosplay community seems to be doing online costume contests kind Of on its own now without necessarily needing to be tied to any particular convention.

473
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:15,324
Speaker 1: Right the convention only provides facilities right if there's no facilities involved.

474
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:18,032
Speaker 1: They don't need anime Boston or Otacon All right.

475
00:35:18,172 --> 00:35:21,042
Speaker 0: What about the panels like the gaming cons the generic cons?

476
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:23,170
Speaker 0: That's the thing these cons are doing online.

477
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,615
Speaker 0: They live stream their panels.

478
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:26,763
Speaker 0: people can watch them online ask questions.

479
00:35:27,346 --> 00:35:28,490
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be real with you.

480
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,275
Speaker 0: This is like.

481
00:35:29,315 --> 00:35:30,321
Speaker 0: this is a problem.

482
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,750
Speaker 0: That is specific to anime cons.

483
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,652
Speaker 0: 90% of anime con panels could never be put online Right.

484
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:54,278
Speaker 1: most anime con panels right at least the ones that people actually like going to and are well attended Right are usually involved showing clips from anime and talking interchangeably right and Displaying copyrighted materials on screen.

485
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,956
Speaker 0: my most popular panel at anime cons ever anime openers around the world It's I talk for two minutes.

486
00:35:59,197 --> 00:36:01,226
Speaker 0: I show a clip that's gonna get a copyright strike.

487
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:02,110
Speaker 0: I talk for two minutes.

488
00:36:02,331 --> 00:36:04,764
Speaker 0: I show a clip that's gonna get a copyright strike right.

489
00:36:04,885 --> 00:36:09,398
Speaker 1: so you could Stream such a panel and get away with it right.

490
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,743
Speaker 1: so for example.

491
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:17,070
Speaker 1: I see a lot of DJs on Twitch are Streaming DJ sets, and then they don't put they make sure there's no VOD.

492
00:36:17,391 --> 00:36:28,606
Speaker 1: Yep, is it's gonna get taken down anyway, so you could put up a panel live stream it With all sorts of copyrighted shit get away with it and be kind of fine But it's still not the best.

493
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:42,549
Speaker 0: well There's a bunch of problems there when you lose that archive to a lot of panels that are not subject to copyright and don't have these problems from cons are already streamed and again Not a huge audience for that usually because of low production values.

494
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,274
Speaker 0: A Bigger problem.

495
00:36:45,314 --> 00:36:54,830
Speaker 0: I think is that almost all anime panels that are not clip shows Go to questions from the audience right away And I have never seen a low-budget convention pull that off.

496
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,975
Speaker 0: You don't want to take questions.

497
00:36:56,176 --> 00:36:59,250
Speaker 1: questions from the audience are bad enough questions from the internet audience.

498
00:37:00,272 --> 00:37:02,806
Speaker 1: You need some sort of thing there right?

499
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:06,870
Speaker 1: either You're not gonna get any questions, or you're gonna get too many bad questions.

500
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,455
Speaker 1: It's not easy to do yep.

501
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:12,630
Speaker 0: even worse most of those panels are a bunch of panelists who don't even know each other that way.

502
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:20,609
Speaker 0: Well, so if you want to put that panel online You've got four people living in four different states having to stream themselves simultaneously somewhere.

503
00:37:21,432 --> 00:37:23,197
Speaker 1: Put together four voice actors.

504
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:33,729
Speaker 1: you somehow got them all to stream together to it in like a. you know a zoom Right you got you know five voice actors in a zoom, and then you want to take questions from the audience like man.

505
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:42,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's gonna be not the greatest straight But here's the really real someone gonna pay money for that like if a pack enough that you can pay the voice actors.

506
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:56,130
Speaker 0: if a pax has a Panel online let's say the people who tend to present at those kinds of conventions Have the technology or the professional resources to do it in a professional way.

507
00:37:57,014 --> 00:37:58,823
Speaker 0: I don't think the vast majority.

508
00:37:58,863 --> 00:37:59,446
Speaker 1: sometimes.

509
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:03,370
Speaker 0: sometimes I've got some anecdotes that I cannot share in public.

510
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:09,590
Speaker 0: But let's just say an extremely large multinational company was incapable of streaming to YouTube.

511
00:38:10,352 --> 00:38:16,389
Speaker 0: Like could not do it despite having the hardware the software and having hired people to do it for them.

512
00:38:19,451 --> 00:38:32,550
Speaker 0: Anyway, but ah when I go to anime cons The panelists tend to struggle with things like making their laptop display their slides In a way that does not happen nearly as often at most other cons.

513
00:38:33,232 --> 00:38:41,959
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I am not confident those people could stream their panel to an RTMP destination To then be put in an anime convention circuit.

514
00:38:42,501 --> 00:38:45,630
Speaker 1: They could record their panel and the convention could then stream it.

515
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:47,313
Speaker 0: They could.

516
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,922
Speaker 1: then then you're losing your question-answer aspect.

517
00:38:50,123 --> 00:38:52,050
Speaker 1: It means the panel is going to be very short.

518
00:38:52,503 --> 00:38:53,533
Speaker 0: Yep Cuz that's the problem.

519
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:57,770
Speaker 0: anime cons in particular the audience interaction is such a big part of those panels.

520
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:04,616
Speaker 1: Very few of the panels at an anime convention will fill up the entire time slot with Presentation.

521
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:14,730
Speaker 0: very few even good ones won't fill it up yep and the good ones that will are the ones that'll get hit by copyright strikes and Have problems and be very difficult to move into an online format.

522
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:30,730
Speaker 0: And also there's this problem of even those panels when they're shown in the limited audience inside of a convention center where there's no like real cameras around a Lot of things they might say or copyright issues get glossed over because it wasn't broadcast anywhere.

523
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:46,747
Speaker 0: It's one thing if some DJ is like doing a stream and then deletes the VOD But if a convention brand officially streams someone's panel that has a bunch of copyright problems, even if the VOD disappears That could still open them up to some liability that I don't think they're ready for.

524
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:53,630
Speaker 0: They also know they also often there's an ASCAP license that applies to in venue entertainment.

525
00:39:53,972 --> 00:39:57,130
Speaker 0: That does not apply to streaming that shit online.

526
00:39:59,948 --> 00:40:01,495
Speaker 0: Oh You yawned it again.

527
00:40:01,535 --> 00:40:02,437
Speaker 0: We lost Scott to us.

528
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:03,621
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was sneezing that time.

529
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:04,383
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a sneeze.

530
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:06,410
Speaker 1: Ooh, I know right.

531
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:11,885
Speaker 1: So yeah, another thing you go to anime con for right is is gaming there.

532
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:13,129
Speaker 1: There's always like a little gaming room.

533
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:14,994
Speaker 1: Yeah That it's like.

534
00:40:15,295 --> 00:40:16,598
Speaker 1: it's like okay, whatever.

535
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:24,770
Speaker 0: gaming cons are like desperately trying to figure out how to make Social gaming happen and gaming cons are uniquely equipped to do that.

536
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:38,569
Speaker 0: I don't think you can get a critical mass appeal like who would want to Go to the online anime con to play board games with the ten other people who are usually in that room playing board games When they could just play a board game online without the convention.

537
00:40:39,811 --> 00:40:43,224
Speaker 1: Now maybe maybe an anime con, you know, they have concerts a make-ons.

538
00:40:43,244 --> 00:40:44,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll put their concert online, right?

539
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,734
Speaker 1: But it's like wait a minute.

540
00:40:46,256 --> 00:40:50,878
Speaker 1: So your anime con would have paid for This musician to come.

541
00:40:50,898 --> 00:40:52,786
Speaker 1: and again, you're providing facilities, right?

542
00:40:52,806 --> 00:40:53,650
Speaker 1: You set up a stage.

543
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:59,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's lights and all the instruments you pay for audio Singing and sure.

544
00:40:59,312 --> 00:40:59,432
Speaker 0: in.

545
00:40:59,472 --> 00:41:02,557
Speaker 1: so now audience this musician that you're hiring.

546
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:04,119
Speaker 1: They just say a band.

547
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:07,388
Speaker 1: they're at home There's no stage.

548
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:09,856
Speaker 1: Okay, you got no facilities.

549
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,060
Speaker 1: So what are they gonna do?

550
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:11,401
Speaker 1: They're gonna.

551
00:41:11,421 --> 00:41:17,502
Speaker 1: they're gonna just play in there in their living room And stream it and someone's gonna pay money for that.

552
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:23,707
Speaker 1: when you could go on YouTube and See, they're just concert videos on YouTube that are legal.

553
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:25,293
Speaker 1: actually Yeah, they're gonna be.

554
00:41:25,373 --> 00:41:31,450
Speaker 1: probably you could just watch like, you know, Regan, you know perfume live at Tokyo Dome.

555
00:41:31,632 --> 00:41:33,450
Speaker 1: So why would I watch if I'm a weave?

556
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,392
Speaker 1: Why would I watch?

557
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:39,970
Speaker 0: and even whatever the enemy God especially anime cons if it's Japanese acts that are performing?

558
00:41:40,412 --> 00:41:45,450
Speaker 0: You know how most anime cons when it's that kind of act they have very strict no camera policies.

559
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:47,014
Speaker 0: There's a reason for that.

560
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,679
Speaker 0: There is no way in hell.

561
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,790
Speaker 0: Most of those bands would let the convention stream that concert.

562
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:54,417
Speaker 1: No, especially not Japanese one.

563
00:41:54,518 --> 00:41:54,598
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:55,543
Speaker 1: All right.

565
00:41:55,563 --> 00:41:59,461
Speaker 1: So the final thing you do at a con All right is you hang out in the hallway with other people, right?

566
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,469
Speaker 1: Okay, so the so the con makes a chat room.

567
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:11,650
Speaker 1: Right, and here's the problem with the chat room and I think this is illustrate, you know Just the problem of real life versus, you know internet group socialization with strangers, right?

568
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,200
Speaker 1: Is you know, let's say me and Ray Moran and anime con.

569
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,190
Speaker 1: we're standing in the hallway chatting and we meet up.

570
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,033
Speaker 1: We meet a listener.

571
00:42:17,073 --> 00:42:21,370
Speaker 1: We're chatting with the listener and all the wildest people around us also chatting, right?

572
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:27,167
Speaker 1: But our human brains don't necessarily hear what the other people are saying right because they're around us.

573
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:27,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

574
00:42:28,372 --> 00:42:30,325
Speaker 1: And let's say banana maraca comes down the hallway.

575
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:36,079
Speaker 0: my boy I saw Right before this whole COVID thing.

576
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,882
Speaker 0: He was last time.

577
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:39,390
Speaker 1: I saw him at was it paxies a couple years ago?

578
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,185
Speaker 0: He comes by and says hi every year cuz I'm always working the front of maine theater.

579
00:42:43,009 --> 00:42:43,130
Speaker 1: Okay?

580
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,657
Speaker 1: I didn't see him at paxies this year.

581
00:42:44,677 --> 00:42:45,240
Speaker 0: Oh, he was there.

582
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,025
Speaker 0: He was there.

583
00:42:46,045 --> 00:42:46,970
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sure he was.

584
00:42:47,853 --> 00:42:49,230
Speaker 1: See what banana comes down the hallway.

585
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:59,990
Speaker 1: so now I'm in this unique anime con experience of chatting with rim and the listener in a little conversation and Banana maraca is adding to the atmosphere of this conversation.

586
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:09,144
Speaker 0: Yeah You know creating a great nerd moment there or they and then like a second later Some cosplayer who is now naked and about to be kicked out is running down the hall screaming.

587
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:10,970
Speaker 0: that also adds to the ambiance.

588
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:12,275
Speaker 1: Sure, it does.

589
00:43:12,696 --> 00:43:16,410
Speaker 1: But now let's take that same scenario and let's put it into it to a text chat room.

590
00:43:16,891 --> 00:43:18,816
Speaker 1: Right in this text chat room.

591
00:43:19,177 --> 00:43:21,041
Speaker 1: I'm trying to talk to rim and the listener.

592
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:25,693
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, there's this maraca sound that just won't go away Alright.

593
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:37,100
Speaker 1: and in the in the text chat these big banana emojis keep popping up and I'm trying to have to keep scrolling up to read what the listener just said because it's getting pushed up The screen by all these bananas and maracas.

594
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,370
Speaker 0: think about any twitch stream that's even remotely popular.

595
00:43:39,591 --> 00:43:42,340
Speaker 0: You can't read anything anyone has typed at any points.

596
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:49,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like that same behavior Right, that is like an antisocial behavior in real life.

597
00:43:50,072 --> 00:43:53,630
Speaker 1: Right could actually be acceptable under the right circumstances, right?

598
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,330
Speaker 1: You know banana maraca guy he doesn't like get in your face with the maracas, right?

599
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:03,050
Speaker 1: He doesn't like, you know, I've never seen him like, you know, you know hit anyone with a maraca.

600
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:09,110
Speaker 1: He's always a chill dude and all these guys never seen him like amplify the volume of his maracas ears, right?

601
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,730
Speaker 1: He just walks down the hallway shaking his maraca.

602
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:17,910
Speaker 1: Right, you know but in a chat room shaking a maraca is the equivalent.

603
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,103
Speaker 1: It is like there's no way to not be in someone's face.

604
00:44:21,143 --> 00:44:22,268
Speaker 1: You either shake it or you don't.

605
00:44:22,629 --> 00:44:22,790
Speaker 1: right?

606
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:32,712
Speaker 1: it's you either post text and move the screen upwards or you don't or Everyone like no way to have like a little maraca on the side of the screen going like shaky shaky shake or what might end Up happening.

607
00:44:32,732 --> 00:44:33,917
Speaker 0: You have a big social space.

608
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,115
Speaker 0: That's too big, but people they've either break it down You shard it off into like.

609
00:44:38,437 --> 00:44:39,240
Speaker 0: here's the area.

610
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,650
Speaker 0: if you want to talk about this aspect of anime.

611
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:49,602
Speaker 0: That's like you make like 20 channels to try to spread the load out to reduce that Volume and to get people at least vaguely talking about the same thing.

612
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:59,112
Speaker 0: the more you shard it off the more you lose The whole point of people at anime cons of interacting with a variety of people and maybe having their conversation altered by that Context.

613
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:04,150
Speaker 0: and if you get too specific, how is that different from all the discords that are already out there today?

614
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:13,170
Speaker 0: Like how is it different the anime Boston discord versus the anime discord if there's no actual physical anime Boston to react to?

615
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,629
Speaker 1: So too long didn't listen, right?

616
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,350
Speaker 1: All the things that convention provides are literally just physical presence.

617
00:45:21,812 --> 00:45:31,695
Speaker 1: so trying to take a convention online is basically like okay, so Nothing, well Everything you provide.

618
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:32,397
Speaker 0: I put it this way.

619
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:36,187
Speaker 0: There is a struggle for all cons to do something online.

620
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,010
Speaker 0: That is meaningful.

621
00:45:37,352 --> 00:45:47,550
Speaker 0: however, anime cons have Far fewer options that are feasible compared to other kinds of cons though other kinds of cons do have a lot of problems like packs.

622
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:53,652
Speaker 0: Online is gonna be really hard to pull off But it is a thousand times easier to pull off than an anime online Right.

623
00:45:53,733 --> 00:46:03,366
Speaker 1: All you can really do I think as a convention online is a. if your brand is strong enough You can provide marketing push for people with weaker brands because that's one thing a convention does.

624
00:46:03,447 --> 00:46:14,500
Speaker 1: they say it's like, you know packs you go to packs and when you're at packs you see something that is not that you didn't know about right because they're They're paying to be at packs and ride on the bigger brand.

625
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:15,122
Speaker 1: right.

626
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:21,910
Speaker 1: you're getting promoted by something big just like if you know an Actual popular podcast that people listen to mentioned geek nights, right?

627
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,390
Speaker 1: It would be the same kind of big brand says something about little brand, right?

628
00:46:27,091 --> 00:46:32,149
Speaker 1: So if your convention actually has a brand you could you sell your marketing power to others, right?

629
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:38,430
Speaker 1: But other than that, it's like alright, you know You don't have a community.

630
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:40,698
Speaker 1: What do you?

631
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:41,524
Speaker 1: what do you sell it?

632
00:46:41,806 --> 00:46:44,770
Speaker 0: Yep, and Also some of these other cons.

633
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,580
Speaker 0: they have a lot of avenues that don't apply to anime cons.

634
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,948
Speaker 0: like an anime con is not gonna be successful.

635
00:46:50,008 --> 00:47:00,260
Speaker 0: trying to run a Big like video game tournament as part of the anime con online because all the anime all the gaming cons They're literally like running video game tournaments online.

636
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,570
Speaker 1: Like that's the main also the video game people just play in the same tournaments.

637
00:47:03,691 --> 00:47:04,695
Speaker 1: They always did right.

638
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:05,016
Speaker 1: It's like.

639
00:47:05,378 --> 00:47:06,684
Speaker 1: it's like those people who are.

640
00:47:06,704 --> 00:47:11,285
Speaker 1: it's like, okay you go to An account a con that has a Street Fighter tournament, right?

641
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:17,270
Speaker 1: All right It's like well the people were in that tournament or a Street Fighter people who happen to live nearby and they went for a tournament.

642
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:20,832
Speaker 1: But those people were playing Street Fighter tournaments all the time Everywhere.

643
00:47:21,434 --> 00:47:29,722
Speaker 1: So if your con isn't providing that physical meetup space for them to have a physical Street Fighter tournament Then that day that you're that weekend that your convention would have been.

644
00:47:30,023 --> 00:47:33,918
Speaker 1: they're just gonna play in whatever Street Fighter They would have played on any other weekend.

645
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:34,401
Speaker 0: Yep.

646
00:47:34,983 --> 00:47:37,748
Speaker 0: The other thing that's happening This is sort of a meta to end it.

647
00:47:38,352 --> 00:47:43,217
Speaker 0: Most of the online cons that are big and backed by real money and are pretty serious They're.

648
00:47:43,419 --> 00:47:58,206
Speaker 0: they're gonna be free like there's no badge to buy because the goal is to keep the brand of the convention alive and to sort of like Keep everyone together until the convention can start up again, but anime cons in particular are mostly nonprofits.

649
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:05,950
Speaker 0: I Don't think they can afford to pay for the things necessary to run an online con without charging money.

650
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:16,650
Speaker 0: But I don't think there are many people on earth willing to pay for an online Convention of any kind unless they're very narrowly target experiences like NSE.

651
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:22,950
Speaker 1: Yeah to pay that's basically all you can do is you can get exclusive content from somewhere, right?

652
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,034
Speaker 1: it has to be content.

653
00:48:24,074 --> 00:48:35,088
Speaker 1: you can actually get yeah and get the rights to to do legally and Then charge money for that exclusive content and have it be content that people actually want and that's not easy to do.

654
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:44,950
Speaker 0: Yep So I think you're gonna see a lot of online gaming cons over the next year You're gonna see a moderate number of online like generic nerd conventions.

655
00:48:45,493 --> 00:48:54,645
Speaker 0: Don't think you're see gonna see a lot of successful online Anime conventions specifically if anisee couldn't get a full Lupin movie to be screened.

656
00:48:54,886 --> 00:48:56,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, what chance do you have?

657
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:00,550
Speaker 1: It's like Otacon can get full anime movies to be screened at Otacon.

658
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,257
Speaker 1: Can they get it to be done online?

659
00:49:02,277 --> 00:49:05,670
Speaker 1: it like pay Otacon ten bucks and you'll get to see a Lupin movie, right?

660
00:49:06,191 --> 00:49:06,995
Speaker 1: No, they can't do it.

661
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:08,845
Speaker 1: There's no way they can get them to convince them to do that.

662
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:09,790
Speaker 1: Fantasy can't yeah.

663
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,553
Speaker 1: So there you go.

664
