1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,140
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, September 24th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,481
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:13,949
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,856
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:19,509
Speaker 1: Continuing our trend, we're talking about werewolves.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,407
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,310
Speaker 1: Considering we just interviewed Epi about the wolf spell RPG, we also just reviewed wolf walkers.

8
00:00:29,051 --> 00:00:31,118
Speaker 1: We've talked a lot about wolves recently.

9
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:33,124
Speaker 1: I mean Beastars and BNA.

10
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:34,790
Speaker 1: both have a hot wolf as a main character.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,502
Speaker 1: It's a weird time.

12
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:37,570
Speaker 1: I feel like we should talk about wolves.

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, well it's also almost October, the Geek Nights birthday of Halloween.

14
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:47,865
Speaker 0: So I see no reason not to start doing some monster episodes.

15
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:49,650
Speaker 0: Let's get that werewolf action.

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:55,270
Speaker 1: Especially because in the old days, we would talk a lot about and follow Monster Madness.

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,010
Speaker 1: But I'm kind of sick of the individual who did Monster Madness.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,070
Speaker 1: And even if he's doing more Monster Madness, I kind of just don't watch his stuff anymore.

19
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:05,444
Speaker 0: No, that was too long ago.

20
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:06,450
Speaker 0: That was another life.

21
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,388
Speaker 1: That was definitely another life.

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:09,345
Speaker 1: Yes.

23
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,690
Speaker 1: I think the moment where that life ended was when we went to the screening of his movie.

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,250
Speaker 1: Not that the movie was bad, the movie was great.

25
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,329
Speaker 0: We're talking about the EDM.

26
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,486
Speaker 0: You think the movie was great?

27
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:17,689
Speaker 0: Okay.

28
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,430
Speaker 1: For what it was, it was pretty great.

29
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,469
Speaker 1: Like, I enjoyed the movie.

30
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:22,594
Speaker 0: It was alright.

31
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:24,146
Speaker 0: I don't think it was great.

32
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:26,013
Speaker 1: You know what?

33
00:01:26,214 --> 00:01:29,269
Speaker 1: I'm glad we went and saw it in a theater in the matter that we did.

34
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:36,109
Speaker 1: However, I do not ever want to interact with the people who are in that audience with us ever again in my life.

35
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:37,506
Speaker 0: No, I do not.

36
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:44,397
Speaker 1: To quote a Rick and Marty line when he's being booed by a crowd, "I relish your boos.

37
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:45,404
Speaker 1: I know what makes you

38
00:01:45,444 --> 00:01:45,686
Speaker 1: cheer.".

39
00:01:47,753 --> 00:01:49,166
Speaker 1: So yeah, I got some news.

40
00:01:50,031 --> 00:01:53,769
Speaker 1: We try to avoid talking about this stuff on tech days, but check this out.

41
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,990
Speaker 1: Facebook, if you weren't aware, is currently in a lot of trouble with the European Union.

42
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:07,490
Speaker 1: Mostly around privacy issues and data security issues and data transfers over national borders and all that kind of stuff.

43
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:23,330
Speaker 0: What really the core of the issue is that Facebook collects data on Facebook users, European people, people living in the EU, and then that data is moved from the EU over to Facebook servers in the United States.

44
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:34,450
Speaker 0: So there is now a database in the United States, US computers, that have an enormous amount of data about European Union citizens that is outside the jurisdiction of the European Union.

45
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:48,710
Speaker 0: So the EU is like, "Hey, if we pass laws or regulations regarding the handling of data about EU citizens, that server over there is going to escape our laws and that's not cool.

46
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:53,668
Speaker 0: You're exporting this data and we can prevent you from exporting it because we're a

47
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:54,050
Speaker 0: government."

48
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:56,185
Speaker 0: A legitimate government.

49
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,850
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of stuff going on in this space.

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,490
Speaker 1: Like Facebook has, if you aren't aware, a history of misusing, abusing, not securing data.

51
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:05,756
Speaker 1: It's a big problem.

52
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:08,530
Speaker 1: That's a big part of how the 2016 election went the way it went.

53
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:27,389
Speaker 1: So Facebook is in trouble with Europe and there's a bunch of lawsuits going on, but the story, which was from the 22nd, two days ago, was that Facebook warned Europe, basically they threatened them, it's almost extortion, "If Europe doesn't back down on these rules, Facebook will just stop working in

54
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:27,630
Speaker 1: Europe.".

55
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:29,609
Speaker 0: Alright, go for it.

56
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, bring it.

57
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,849
Speaker 1: That is exactly, if I was the European regulator, my first response would be,

58
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:33,990
Speaker 1: "Wow.".

59
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,443
Speaker 0: It was that easy to get rid of Facebook in Europe?

60
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,630
Speaker 0: Wow, that's fantastic.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,170
Speaker 1: Make them comply with minimal privacy regulations and they're gone?

62
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:51,341
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wish, oh man, if you had told me it was that easy to get rid of Facebook for a whole multi-country zone, I'd be like, "Yes, that's

63
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:51,503
Speaker 0: great.".

64
00:03:52,952 --> 00:04:04,730
Speaker 1: So the story that just broke yesterday, so one day later, was that Facebook at least denies that it will pull out of Europe over this issue.

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:18,630
Speaker 1: But if you read into the article, that's partly because Facebook, I don't know if their bluff got called or what, but they're still trying to sue and avoid these regulations coming at them, and they're arguing that Ireland is treating them unfairly.

66
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:30,788
Speaker 1: This is one of those situations that doesn't mean much yet, but depending on how this progresses, there are really three possible outcomes, two of which are really good for us.

67
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:43,610
Speaker 1: Either Facebook pulls out of Europe and is no longer a problem in Europe, which will basically really impact Facebook's ability to continue to make money and exist in the US in the long term, probably.

68
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:54,749
Speaker 1: Two, the compliment to that, Facebook actually gets kicked out of the European Union, or gets fined such that they pull out of the European Union to avoid paying those fines, that could go down.

69
00:04:55,591 --> 00:05:04,069
Speaker 1: Or three, the other way it could go, Facebook complies with Europe's data transfer and privacy rules, which means Facebook is much less of a threat to the world.

70
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:06,674
Speaker 0: So,

71
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:20,490
Speaker 1: the only bad outcome would be if the European Union caves and lets Facebook continue to do the things that it does, and doesn't actually force this issue to come to a head, I get the impression the EU is more than willing to drag this out and drag Facebook down.

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:48,130
Speaker 0: There's also an interesting confluence here, where I believe this to be true, the last time I read about it, which was admittedly a while ago, so this could be wrong, but people use Ireland, big companies use Ireland to avoid taxes, but also, I believe that in the EU, they decided to task Ireland with enforcing the GDPR and other tech things.

73
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:51,710
Speaker 0: It's like the EU is a whole bunch of countries, so they're like, "Okay, we made these regulations.

74
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:53,478
Speaker 0: Ireland, it's your job to enforce them.

75
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,543
Speaker 0: We're going to give this one for

76
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:54,744
Speaker 0: you.".

77
00:05:56,793 --> 00:06:00,430
Speaker 0: So, the same country that's enforcing the regulations is also this tax haven.

78
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:04,349
Speaker 0: There's a conflict of interest there, but that goes both ways, too.

79
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:20,150
Speaker 0: It's like Ireland wants companies to funnel their money through them, but they also have the power to pull some, if it's a tech company especially, they got some power over them, so there's stuff going on there.

80
00:06:20,992 --> 00:06:23,889
Speaker 0: If you are interested in that angle, Google it.

81
00:06:24,091 --> 00:06:26,370
Speaker 0: Instead of listening to things I said that were probably wrong.

82
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:34,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can link to these two articles at least, and you can follow this one thread that hopefully will have some consequences for Facebook, and we'll see how things go.

83
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,729
Speaker 1: In a more pressing, I guess, do you have any news?

84
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,910
Speaker 0: Is there any news going on these days?

85
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,690
Speaker 1: I mean, other than the coup attempt, other than the Supreme Court no longer being a legitimate body, all that stuff.

86
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

87
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,970
Speaker 0: It hasn't been a legitimate body for a while.

88
00:06:53,332 --> 00:06:56,188
Speaker 1: I think it finally tipped fully over the abyss now.

89
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,290
Speaker 1: Considering they already picked a date for voting on confirming the nominee, despite the nominee not actually yet being even named.

90
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:04,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see about that.

91
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,449
Speaker 1: Well, there's no way to stop it.

92
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:07,627
Speaker 0: There is.

93
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,242
Speaker 1: Well, there's no procedural way to stop it.

94
00:07:11,283 --> 00:07:12,608
Speaker 1: There's no legal way to stop it.

95
00:07:13,292 --> 00:07:13,550
Speaker 0: Maybe.

96
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:15,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

97
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:20,430
Speaker 0: All the news is, like you said, too big to discuss.

98
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,550
Speaker 1: For two white guy podcasters to talk about it.

99
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:24,690
Speaker 0: In a Thursday section, right?

100
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:27,650
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't know, what small thing has happened?

101
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,942
Speaker 0: It's like there's new game consoles.

102
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:29,690
Speaker 0: Who cares, right?

103
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:38,410
Speaker 0: There's a PlayStation whatever, and an Xbox whatever, and there's a new Nvidia card, which is basically the same as a new PC console.

104
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:44,310
Speaker 0: And Nintendo's going to have a new Switch next year, even though that's not officially announced yet, right?

105
00:07:45,752 --> 00:07:51,090
Speaker 0: I guess the story there that's common to all those things is, you know, people trying to buy a thing, right?

106
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:54,550
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I gave up trying to buy the thing I want to buy.

107
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,548
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people trying to buy the thing don't need it.

108
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,229
Speaker 0: A lot of people trying to buy it are trying to scalp it.

109
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,790
Speaker 1: What's fascinating though is that the one that they all bought, the 380 that everyone's buying.

110
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,970
Speaker 0: I said thing because it applies to the PlayStations also, or the Xboxes, right?

111
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:11,277
Speaker 1: Yep.

112
00:08:12,731 --> 00:08:21,410
Speaker 0: But really, why don't any of these companies just institute a queuing system where you put it in order, they'll take as many orders as they can get.

113
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,890
Speaker 0: Imagine Newegg has a million people who want something.

114
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,210
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll take a million orders, and then they start getting stock in, right?

115
00:08:29,771 --> 00:08:33,690
Speaker 0: And they say, okay, well, every time we get a shipment, it's about 200 of them or something, right?

116
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:42,470
Speaker 0: And then when they think a shipment's coming, they email the next 200, 300 people, they're saying, hey, if you don't cancel, we're going to charge your card, right?

117
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,509
Speaker 0: As soon as we get one for you.

118
00:08:44,971 --> 00:08:47,570
Speaker 1: On one hand, there's no good reason for them not to do this.

119
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,649
Speaker 1: It's like an obvious feature.

120
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,568
Speaker 0: And you would get more orders on your site instead of people going to--.

121
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,790
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of sites that are sites you would never buy something from, right?

122
00:08:58,257 --> 00:09:00,070
Speaker 0: If you could just buy everything from Newegg, you would.

123
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:08,230
Speaker 0: But people end up buying from some shady eBay place or some other place because-- I have never bought something on purpose from eBay directly because I've never trusted it.

124
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:12,130
Speaker 0: People are going in like Best Buys and waiting in line and paying too much.

125
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,810
Speaker 0: And it's like people would rather just go to Newegg.

126
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:20,930
Speaker 0: If Newegg had this queuing system, they would take orders and fill them that other places are getting.

127
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,790
Speaker 0: Those other places would be severely damaged.

128
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,030
Speaker 1: So I think I can explain why no one implements this feature.

129
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,990
Speaker 1: They won't make any more money because they'll sell the same number of the thing.

130
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:31,750
Speaker 0: No, you won't.

131
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:46,090
Speaker 0: There will be people who would, you know, to avoid the effort of having to F5, right, would just place their order on Newegg and just wait rather than F5 and have to trust some shady site where they end up buying it from.

132
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,890
Speaker 1: Those same people will just come back to Newegg like a year later and buy the thing.

133
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:51,723
Speaker 0: Maybe, maybe not.

134
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:52,149
Speaker 1: I don't know.

135
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:54,429
Speaker 1: Also, they don't have that many to sell.

136
00:09:56,291 --> 00:10:01,570
Speaker 1: Basically, I'm confident that building out all that infrastructure, like making a queuing system, just wouldn't be worth the effort.

137
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:07,170
Speaker 1: There wouldn't be any actual return for them because there wouldn't actually really be more of that thing.

138
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:12,430
Speaker 1: And also, the people who would actually queue, because remember, most people wouldn't even engage with a system like that.

139
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,289
Speaker 1: The people like me who would queue, as soon as I see one for sale anywhere, I'm getting out of that queue.

140
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:24,270
Speaker 0: But you have to be right, but you have to actually succeed at buying it elsewhere.

141
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,011
Speaker 1: Yeah.

142
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:30,010
Speaker 1: But also, if I can't get it, there's a certain time range beyond which I don't even want it anymore.

143
00:10:31,991 --> 00:10:37,690
Speaker 1: Like at 3080, I want it because it would be a long-term investment for my pipelines.

144
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:45,070
Speaker 1: If it takes a year for there to be in stock enough for me to get one, a year from now, other video cards are already on the horizon.

145
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:47,303
Speaker 0: Oh, you're getting that queue.

146
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:51,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that queue doesn't exist because, again, it's the same problem.

147
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:56,566
Speaker 0: You could say, "Hey, if you're still in the 3080 queue and a 4080 comes out, you're at the start of the 4080

148
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:56,706
Speaker 0: queue.".

149
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,753
Speaker 1: You know what you could do?

150
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:03,108
Speaker 1: You could make a website that the whole service is, "We will queue four things for

151
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:03,248
Speaker 1: you.".

152
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:05,810
Speaker 0: I mean, I think people did that.

153
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,653
Speaker 1: There are a ton of those.

154
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:12,010
Speaker 1: I'm actually in some discords that run bots that queue you to try to buy things.

155
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,992
Speaker 1: And you know what happened?

156
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:18,007
Speaker 1: When the 3080s went on sale, there were a bunch of posts in there right away that said, "Here are all the

157
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:18,268
Speaker 1: queues.".

158
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:23,389
Speaker 1: And then they never would post an update unless someone actually got one.

159
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,749
Speaker 1: And there was never a post since then because no one got one.

160
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:32,910
Speaker 0: I think it's, you know, Nvidia considers, you know, their line, at least, is like, "Hey...".

161
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,730
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, the PlayStation, Xbox, they have no line, right?

162
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,380
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that's a consumer product.

163
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,030
Speaker 0: They should make enough for the demand, right?

164
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:40,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're gonna.

165
00:11:41,355 --> 00:11:42,203
Speaker 0: They just suck.

166
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,010
Speaker 0: They will eventually.

167
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:49,990
Speaker 0: Nvidia, their line is like, "Hey, we didn't really expect normal people to need this ridiculous thing, right?

168
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:52,004
Speaker 0: It's only for... It's so powerful.

169
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,890
Speaker 0: Gamers don't need this.

170
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,989
Speaker 0: We didn't think we would need to make that many before we went on sale because...".

171
00:11:57,271 --> 00:12:00,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, they thought they could, like, make more later and, like, people will be operating over time.

172
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,488
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're like, "How many people in the world actually need this

173
00:12:02,548 --> 00:12:02,729
Speaker 0: thing?".

174
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,170
Speaker 0: And they think a small number because... So that's when they start selling.

175
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:11,670
Speaker 0: If they thought that all gamers would need a 3080, they would have made more before they went on sale with them.

176
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:15,549
Speaker 1: And the coins, like, people aren't mining coins with this shit like they used to.

177
00:12:15,951 --> 00:12:17,810
Speaker 1: I think I know why there's all this extra man.

178
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:19,860
Speaker 1: One is the AI stuff in it.

179
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:21,590
Speaker 1: Like, you could do AI stuff with these chips.

180
00:12:21,932 --> 00:12:24,250
Speaker 1: Kind of like in the early days when KUDAs started appearing.

181
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:27,970
Speaker 1: And you could, like, write code that would run on that KUDA system, all those cores.

182
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,325
Speaker 0: I think it's also just been the right amount of time since, you know, the previous cards.

183
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,570
Speaker 0: And people are stuck at home playing games more.

184
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:35,792
Speaker 0: True.

185
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,890
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm running a 1080, which I've had for a while.

186
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,510
Speaker 0: The timing of the release is coming up.

187
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,050
Speaker 0: You know, September is a great time to release a new expensive product.

188
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,410
Speaker 0: You know, because it's back to school time and then it becomes holiday time.

189
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,310
Speaker 0: That's why iPods and iPhones are always September, October, right?

190
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,010
Speaker 1: The two things that seem to be driving that demand for this particular video card seems to be the thing you said.

191
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,969
Speaker 1: But the two other things are, one, a lot more people have 4K monitors now.

192
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,149
Speaker 1: That's true.

193
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:07,370
Speaker 1: And the video cards they have, a lot of video cards can't actually drive anything at 4K at a reasonable frame rate.

194
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,077
Speaker 0: I mean, I have a 1070.

195
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:08,866
Speaker 0: It can do 4K.

196
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:09,150
Speaker 0: Sure.

197
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1070 is a already, like, relatively expensive card.

198
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,530
Speaker 1: Because remember, that was expensive when it came out and it didn't ever get cheaper.

199
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,921
Speaker 0: Old cards are not- It's not any cheaper than it used to be.

200
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,250
Speaker 1: It costs about the same as what a 3080 would cost new, except for the scalpers.

201
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,690
Speaker 0: But isn't the 3080, like, significantly faster?

202
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, because old video cards don't get cheaper.

203
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,410
Speaker 1: They just disappear.

204
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:32,623
Speaker 0: But the new one is the same price as the-.

205
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of reasons for that.

206
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,830
Speaker 1: But the other thing that's going on is actually VR.

207
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,477
Speaker 1: Because the 3080 is necessary to drive high-end headsets fully.

208
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,930
Speaker 1: No video card up to this point that consumers would have could fully realize the high-end headsets.

209
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,750
Speaker 1: So, very high resolution and very high frame rate.

210
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:58,670
Speaker 1: So, people who have a Valve Index actually, like, really want this card.

211
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,950
Speaker 1: I suspect that is a big chunk of the extra people trying to buy it as soon as possible.

212
00:14:03,211 --> 00:14:07,008
Speaker 1: Because VR is another thing that had a little uptick because people are stuck at home all the time.

213
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:08,709
Speaker 0: That's true.

214
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,930
Speaker 1: Like, there's more people in VRChat now than I, like, ever saw ever before COVID.

215
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,310
Speaker 1: And VRChat didn't get better.

216
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,369
Speaker 1: Like, there's not much new in there.

217
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,889
Speaker 1: In fact, parts of it got worse to accommodate all these new people coming in.

218
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,590
Speaker 1: Like, now I go to any public space, there's a million people, it's crowded.

219
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,330
Speaker 1: I gotta, like, go hide and make private spaces to get away from these mobs.

220
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,150
Speaker 1: But anyway, in some topical news to the fact that the world's on fire and there's crises.

221
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:45,270
Speaker 0: This news is- there's a trend, but the trend in this- I just had an image of us, like, sitting at a desk podcasting in, like, an open field with, like, zombies walking around.

222
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,309
Speaker 1: And we're like, "So yeah, the zombie apocalypse is

223
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:47,450
Speaker 1: coming.".

224
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:59,710
Speaker 1: And there's a military helicopter flying by and we're just sitting at a desk podcasting, like, in the middle of the- We're just like, "Guys, like, at the end of the show, like, make sure you go take out some zombies, like, to help us out.

225
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,765
Speaker 1: We really gotta deal with these

226
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:01,029
Speaker 1: zombies.".

227
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:07,070
Speaker 0: But anyway- So, I was biking to work today and man, you know, usually, you know how you shoot a zombie or two on the way to work.

228
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:10,190
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, I always tried to, but I was outta- I ran outta ammo.

229
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:12,559
Speaker 0: I got, like, this perf- I got this perfect headshot.

230
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,630
Speaker 0: The zombie was riding a fixie, so I really wanted to take that one out.

231
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:19,763
Speaker 1: Now, I just imagined that scene of, "Oh, you shot zombies.

232
00:15:19,783 --> 00:15:20,326
Speaker 1: Splanders.

233
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:20,909
Speaker 1: He was a

234
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:21,170
Speaker 1: zombie?".

235
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:29,767
Speaker 1: So, this is one of those stories that is so laughable and yet, at the same time, 100% real and happens a lot.

236
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,770
Speaker 1: The moral of this news is very simple.

237
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:33,650
Speaker 1: Cops lie.

238
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,450
Speaker 1: Like, cops just lie.

239
00:15:35,611 --> 00:15:38,390
Speaker 1: Police officers, especially in the United States, will just lie.

240
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,218
Speaker 1: They lie in court.

241
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,129
Speaker 1: They lie to you.

242
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,688
Speaker 1: If a cop ever says, like, "Hey, you got any

243
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:42,910
Speaker 1: weed?"

244
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,279
Speaker 1: Just like, "Just give it to me.

245
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,084
Speaker 1: I'll throw it away.

246
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:45,648
Speaker 1: No harm, no

247
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:45,850
Speaker 1: foul.".

248
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:48,190
Speaker 1: No, they're gonna arrest you as soon as you pull that weed out.

249
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:49,961
Speaker 0: What are you gonna tell me next?

250
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,010
Speaker 0: I don't- I can't believe that.

251
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:52,589
Speaker 0: You gonna tell me next, what, bricks are red?

252
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,390
Speaker 1: There are non-red bricks.

253
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,010
Speaker 1: So, this story is about a police officer.

254
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,690
Speaker 1: It's topical because the police officer, the story was, early on, ambushed and shot.

255
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,090
Speaker 1: You can guess the context of being ambushed.

256
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:11,610
Speaker 1: He's a cop in Louisiana.

257
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,750
Speaker 1: You can imagine everything that happened there and why this is a problem.

258
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,290
Speaker 1: Black Lives Matter, fuck the police.

259
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:28,310
Speaker 1: Anyway, a further investigation, and apparently not even a very long investigation, determined that this officer was not, in fact, shot by an ambush.

260
00:16:28,693 --> 00:16:30,086
Speaker 1: He was shot by a cop.

261
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,530
Speaker 1: In fact, he was shot by himself.

262
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:44,450
Speaker 1: He shot himself, and he covered it up by saying he was ambushed, and this was very easily determined to be a lie.

263
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:47,510
Speaker 1: He has now been released on Bond.

264
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was in custody, and you can read this story.

265
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:59,070
Speaker 1: The moral is, like, seriously, a cop will make up a story about being ambushed, rather than admit that they shot themselves by accident.

266
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:07,028
Speaker 1: The fact that they made up the ambush and lied, and the fact that they shot themselves, are both reasons why there should not be police like this.

267
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:09,328
Speaker 0: Yep.

268
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,950
Speaker 0: There's a reason why- Was that your thing of the day?

269
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,242
Speaker 1: No, it was just news.

270
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:14,890
Speaker 1: That was topical.

271
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,432
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

272
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,728
Speaker 0: I thought we were done with news.

273
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,743
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's time for Things of the Day.

274
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,260
Speaker 1: So, check this out.

275
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,349
Speaker 1: I'm not into sneaker culture.

276
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,889
Speaker 1: Like, I could not give a shit, but I like striking shoes.

277
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,990
Speaker 1: Also, you can tell I've lived in New York long enough that I said sneaker, instead of tennis shoe, like almost all English-speaking people in America say.

278
00:17:37,171 --> 00:17:38,690
Speaker 0: I've never not said sneaker.

279
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you've lived in the weird East Coast.

280
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:44,988
Speaker 0: Most Americans say tennis shoe to refer to- So, what did you think when the movie Sneakers came out?

281
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,161
Speaker 0: So, sneakers- You thought it was just about people sneaking?

282
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:49,350
Speaker 0: You didn't understand that it was a pun?

283
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:56,110
Speaker 1: In most of the country, people know that sneaker is a synonym for tennis shoes, but no one uses the word sneaker in most of the country.

284
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,889
Speaker 0: It's the only word I used.

285
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:08,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, most people in America will say tennis shoes to refer to any sports shoe, and in fact, I have literally been in conversations where someone said, "Oh, I need some tennis tennis

286
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:09,208
Speaker 1: shoes.".

287
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,389
Speaker 1: They'll even say tennis shoe like it's one word.

288
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:21,949
Speaker 1: But I found some really cool striking sneakers that I like enough to where I actually just bought them like right now, right before the show, before I talked about them.

289
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:23,349
Speaker 0: Are you gonna wear them?

290
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, someday when I get outside again.

291
00:18:27,351 --> 00:18:35,069
Speaker 1: They are sneakers that have the aesthetic styling of a T120 VHS tape box.

292
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:39,870
Speaker 0: Are they actually comfortable or the right size?

293
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,182
Speaker 1: Well, they're the right size.

294
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:41,870
Speaker 1: I got the right one.

295
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:47,674
Speaker 1: But this is the kind of shoe that I would basically wear like when I'm going out of conventions or something or like me.

296
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:50,930
Speaker 1: I don't know where I'll wear it, but I don't have any shoes that look like anything.

297
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:56,750
Speaker 1: All the shoes I have are just running shoes or like the grayest, most generic-looking tennis shoes.

298
00:18:59,812 --> 00:19:05,310
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean like, you know, something like that is something I would look at and say that's cool, but would not actually wear.

299
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,850
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, remember, I've got that t-shirt that is just a Betamax like logo.

300
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:13,169
Speaker 0: Well, the t-shirt I think with that style is different than a shoe.

301
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:19,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this shoe, I'm kind of doubling down on my like 80s high-fi aesthetic.

302
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,310
Speaker 1: I actually got a bunch of shirts and stuff.

303
00:19:23,032 --> 00:19:26,950
Speaker 0: There is plenty of clothing you can get with that aesthetic.

304
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:36,770
Speaker 1: Yup, and I am collecting more and more of it because someday I can go outside and wear clothes instead of just wearing a shirt and whatever and sitting in front of a camera all the time.

305
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,110
Speaker 0: A shirt and something.

306
00:19:38,572 --> 00:19:39,636
Speaker 1: There's something down there.

307
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:42,950
Speaker 1: My bare ass is not touching my chair, usually.

308
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,629
Speaker 0: You laid a towel on the chair.

309
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:51,310
Speaker 1: I have, in fact, attended business meetings where I'm wearing a dress shirt on the top and there is just a towel at the bottom.

310
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,110
Speaker 1: The only pro move, the pro move is being so confident that you will not stand up by accident.

311
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,028
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

312
00:20:02,611 --> 00:20:08,727
Speaker 0: So in other cop news, so here's a situation, I think, where was this, Ohio or something?

313
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:09,870
Speaker 0: I don't even know, it doesn't matter.

314
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:15,690
Speaker 0: There was some court and this gentleman was appearing in court to get sentenced.

315
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,768
Speaker 0: It's like, "Hey, you got a court appointment, come in, we're gonna, you know, tell you your

316
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:19,070
Speaker 0: sentence.".

317
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, but already guilty, like it's only bad news.

318
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the dude was pretty much, I think his crime was he had some meth.

319
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,130
Speaker 0: He's a meth dude, right?

320
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:27,608
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah.

321
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:28,809
Speaker 1: It's like, okay.

322
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, the person who needs help, not jail, but anyway.

323
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,560
Speaker 0: I think he got sentenced to six months, right?

324
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:38,330
Speaker 0: I guess prison/jail of some kind.

325
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,390
Speaker 1: Well, if you're thinking it is what I'm thinking, then he's gonna get a lot more than six months now.

326
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:51,610
Speaker 0: Maybe, but in this video, because of course, even a small courthouse in a, you know, place like that has cameras everywhere, right?

327
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,142
Speaker 0: You know, it has security, police, right?

328
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:56,707
Speaker 0: Deputies, bailiffs, et cetera.

329
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:03,850
Speaker 0: When they're bringing this gentleman through the courtroom after sentencing, the gentleman runs.

330
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:13,990
Speaker 0: And usually, you would expect this kind of video to end with like hilariousness as someone who foolishly runs fails to foolishly run.

331
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,108
Speaker 1: That's usually the case.

332
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:27,990
Speaker 0: Instead, this video is funny because the man successfully runs and the three Barney Fife's that let him get away, one of them does this.

333
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:36,730
Speaker 0: You'll see in the video, they dive, there's like a downward staircase and the dude, the running dude goes around the railing and down the stairs really fast.

334
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:43,930
Speaker 0: The cop behind him tries to like jump over the railing to like stop him, right?

335
00:21:44,172 --> 00:21:46,790
Speaker 1: But he like dives head first like Superman.

336
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,628
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like, uh...

337
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,650
Speaker 1: He just slams straight into the wall, is clearly immediately unconscious and just slides down the stairs behind the guy.

338
00:21:56,251 --> 00:21:57,650
Speaker 0: I don't think he's un- he's not doing well.

339
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,601
Speaker 1: He looked un- he hit, he literally dived head first at speed directly into a wall.

340
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,730
Speaker 1: You see his head hit the wall and he just falls and slides down, not moving.

341
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,430
Speaker 0: The point is, there's so much to tell in this ama- the video is the thing of the day.

342
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,544
Speaker 1: The video is pretty- like you can hear the yak and sacks.

343
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,795
Speaker 1: Amazing video, yes.

344
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:20,850
Speaker 0: So that's the wise thing of the day, but there's so many stories to tell here, right?

345
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,410
Speaker 0: Is six months in prison/jail really what a meth guy needs?

346
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,830
Speaker 1: No, they need to be in a hospital or like a treatment place.

347
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,198
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, you need something, right?

348
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:31,010
Speaker 0: This is not- this whole situation is bad, right?

349
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,813
Speaker 0: Why- what- like?

350
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:38,650
Speaker 0: the bailiff is basically like, you know, you can see like the deputies can kind of run except for the stupid Superman one.

351
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,789
Speaker 1: Oh, the bailiff can't really walk.

352
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:47,850
Speaker 0: The bailiff can't really walk and it's like, is that dude, you know, regardless of any other qualities, is that person qualified for that job?

353
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,506
Speaker 0: It's a physical job where you have to chase people, right?

354
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:52,613
Speaker 0: Right?

355
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:59,190
Speaker 1: So it's like- I've been in courtrooms where shenanigans happen and a bailiff had to put somebody on the floor.

356
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:00,912
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

357
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:06,182
Speaker 0: You know, cops are, you know, all bad, right?

358
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:10,150
Speaker 0: And these ones are not only bad people, they're bad at their job.

359
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:10,583
Speaker 0: Yeah!

360
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:14,341
Speaker 1: Like, you watch the video and it's like, you know what, guy?

361
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:15,066
Speaker 1: Go, go for it.

362
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:28,518
Speaker 0: It's like, even if we're not gonna, you know, you haven't, you know, infringed upon anyone's rights or been racist to anyone or done anything like that, you cops are clearly all not qualified for your jobs.

363
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:32,567
Speaker 0: You let just some dude, a meth dude just run and they got away from you.

364
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:33,750
Speaker 0: You suck at this.

365
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,489
Speaker 0: Well, like, you know, we- If I fucked up that much at my job, I would be let go.

366
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:50,330
Speaker 1: You and I remember talking about this on Geek Nights back in like 2006 at length where we were like, most cops are so incompetent that we should have gun cops that are very special and most cops should not be gun cops.

367
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,489
Speaker 1: We should not let them have guns.

368
00:23:52,573 --> 00:23:53,997
Speaker 0: These cops did not use their guns.

369
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,969
Speaker 0: They just tried to run and grab the guy, but they just failed and sucked at it.

370
00:23:59,552 --> 00:24:01,210
Speaker 1: In relatively hilarious fashion.

371
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:06,190
Speaker 0: Yes, this is like, you couldn't film something better than this in like a Jackie Chan movie.

372
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,883
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, still at home, we were live at the Penny Arcade Expo.

373
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:13,986
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get the video on YouTube.

374
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:15,550
Speaker 1: We were live at the Crunchyroll Expo.

375
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,670
Speaker 1: I don't know if I have the rights to put that video on YouTube, but I'll figure out where you'll be able to watch it at some point.

376
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,830
Speaker 0: You don't need to, 'cause we've done that panel before.

377
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:30,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did a little more like, it was a better, like, timed, focused version of it, but it's not materially too much different from what we did at Henry Boston.

378
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,090
Speaker 0: We can always record it again if they're gonna be meh about it, right?

379
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,316
Speaker 0: Yep, yep.

380
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,559
Speaker 1: But, uh, we, uh, have a panel coming up at, uh, Meg West.

381
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,770
Speaker 1: That is a short and super fast version of a panel we've done before.

382
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:46,849
Speaker 1: And we're gonna be doing more online content, more videos, more stuff as time goes on.

383
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,006
Speaker 1: I spent all this time making that stupid pipeline to record these panels.

384
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:50,589
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use it.

385
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:51,846
Speaker 0: That's right.

386
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:56,749
Speaker 0: Otherwise, hopefully- The book is still the tale of Genji.

387
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,270
Speaker 0: Perhaps.

388
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,450
Speaker 0: We'll read it sometime in the future.

389
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,501
Speaker 1: Maybe when it starts getting cold.

390
00:25:01,823 --> 00:25:02,970
Speaker 1: I could see that being the time.

391
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:04,005
Speaker 0: Maybe.

392
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,610
Speaker 0: Maybe.

393
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,313
Speaker 0: Is there anything else?

394
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:09,419
Speaker 0: I don't know.

395
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:14,930
Speaker 0: I'm riding the bike to nowhere, and one listener came to watch me ride a bike to nowhere.

396
00:25:15,171 --> 00:25:16,355
Speaker 0: Which, it's really boring.

397
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:20,130
Speaker 0: I don't know why you would, but you can talk to me while I ride a bike to nowhere, which is nice.

398
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:20,925
Speaker 0: Nice for me.

399
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:22,937
Speaker 0: Someone to talk to?

400
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:24,589
Speaker 0: 'cause no one else is here right now, so.

401
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,371
Speaker 1: Yep.

402
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:27,700
Speaker 1: But just keep following us in all the places.

403
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,050
Speaker 1: 'cause we're doing stuff and we're gonna keep trying to do more stuff.

404
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,790
Speaker 1: Now that we've got, we're past all of our, like, convention panel deadlines.

405
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,867
Speaker 1: So now we got some time to back up into some other projects we're working on.

406
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:38,655
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

407
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:40,029
Speaker 1: Let's get right into it.

408
00:25:40,594 --> 00:25:41,663
Speaker 1: It's coming up on October.

409
00:25:41,703 --> 00:25:42,489
Speaker 1: It's not October yet.

410
00:25:43,032 --> 00:25:47,310
Speaker 1: And a class of monster that we could discuss at length is the humble werewolf.

411
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:55,730
Speaker 0: So yeah, werewolves, I feel like, you know, you think about the classic Hollywood monsters of Halloween, right?

412
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:57,990
Speaker 0: You know, the vampire, the Frankenstein monster.

413
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,470
Speaker 1: You got the Dracula, the Frankenstein, the werewolf, the mummy.

414
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:03,230
Speaker 0: The mummy, right?

415
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:07,650
Speaker 0: And I feel like werewolf is always sort of like the weakest one.

416
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:08,373
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

417
00:26:08,393 --> 00:26:13,090
Speaker 1: I definitely noticed throughout my life in pop culture, not just movies, but pop culture in general.

418
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,541
Speaker 1: Like, what are people talking about?

419
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,489
Speaker 1: What do people dress up as?

420
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,369
Speaker 1: Among those four monster types, I guess witch, like, is up there too.

421
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,790
Speaker 1: There's, like, this ebb and flow of which ones are in season.

422
00:26:23,471 --> 00:26:25,490
Speaker 1: Like, vampires will be really big for a while.

423
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:28,465
Speaker 1: But then people, like, really get into mummies for some reason.

424
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,410
Speaker 1: Mummies are big for a while.

425
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,450
Speaker 0: No, zombie, I guess, also counts.

426
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, zombies had, zombies were real big, like, in the early to mid-2000s.

427
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,448
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

428
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:38,549
Speaker 1: Like, when I was a kid, it was, like, Frankenstein's.

429
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:43,150
Speaker 1: Like, multiple kids dressed up as Frankenstein's monster, like, every year at Halloween.

430
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,130
Speaker 1: Like, that was just a thing.

431
00:26:45,411 --> 00:26:48,090
Speaker 0: I just feel like werewolf always getting the short end of the stick, right?

432
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:55,390
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's, like, if you ever see any, think of any, like, media property where there's, you know, all of them combined, sort of, together.

433
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:55,825
Speaker 0: Yep.

434
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,028
Speaker 0: The werewolf is always sort of like the first guy, right?

435
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,690
Speaker 0: The lowest in the totem pole, the weak, the weak henchman, right?

436
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:04,889
Speaker 0: Yep, well, 'cause they usually just- The Dracula is usually the boss.

437
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:12,710
Speaker 1: 'Cause they're wearing, 'cause, let's be honest, in almost all media that's ever been made, especially live action, the werewolf costumes look like shit.

438
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:16,570
Speaker 0: That is a factor, I believe, yes.

439
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:21,588
Speaker 1: Like, they look like a person wearing a really shitty dog costume, like, 90% of the time.

440
00:27:23,295 --> 00:27:24,089
Speaker 0: That's true, that's true.

441
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:30,130
Speaker 0: I think also, though, is that if you think about a lot of media portrayals of werewolf, right?

442
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:36,270
Speaker 0: Werewolf is rarely just this direct villain, like, werewolf coming to get ya, right?

443
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:43,270
Speaker 0: It's more that the illness of lycanthropy is the villain, right?

444
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:51,270
Speaker 0: And the actual person who is a werewolf is, like, more troubled and sort of a Kafka-esque metamorphosis similar to the fly.

445
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,009
Speaker 1: It's like a very low- It's not a bad- It's like on the low tier of body horror.

446
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,070
Speaker 0: Right, Incredible Hulk kind of situation, right?

447
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,630
Speaker 0: Where it's like, you're not some villain who just wants to go around hurting people, right?

448
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,409
Speaker 0: Like a Dracula who just wants to, you know, be evil, or, you know.

449
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,310
Speaker 0: Frankenstein's monster is also misunderstood, but, you know, a werewolf is not an evil.

450
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,710
Speaker 0: It's just like, oh, I've got a problem, I keep turning into a wolf.

451
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:21,290
Speaker 1: Well, well, it depends, because in Dungeons & Dragons, canonically, both werewolves and wolfwares are always chaotic evil.

452
00:28:22,411 --> 00:28:24,649
Speaker 0: Okay, bad job, D&D, you messed it up.

453
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,849
Speaker 1: So I'm curious, 'cause we were talking about this before the show.

454
00:28:28,612 --> 00:28:33,230
Speaker 1: Were you aware that in almost all D&D, there is a difference between a werewolf and a wolfware?

455
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,038
Speaker 0: I've never heard of a wolfware.

456
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:45,110
Speaker 0: In fact, if I Google for wolfware, it's like- You're gonna find the second- You're gonna find, like, clothing and apparel for a college whose team is the wolves.

457
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,388
Speaker 1: Type it all in one word.

458
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:48,589
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, let me try it.

459
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,770
Speaker 1: And you're gonna find the Forgotten Realms wiki that talks about wolfwares.

460
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,750
Speaker 0: Wolfware, NC State University.

461
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,848
Speaker 0: What the fuck, when I typed- Oh, you're spelling were all wrong, Scott.

462
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:01,356
Speaker 0: Oh.

463
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,996
Speaker 1: That's what's going on here.

464
00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:05,230
Speaker 1: Type wolfware and spell it correctly.

465
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:16,370
Speaker 0: I didn't type- you would think that, oh, I did software, but there's also wolfware, W-E-A-R, and now I'm gonna find clothing and apparel, I bet.

466
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:17,032
Speaker 1: Yep.

467
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:19,447
Speaker 1: No, were is spelled W-E-R-E, it means man.

468
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,390
Speaker 0: Wolfware, Forgotten Realms.

469
00:29:22,755 --> 00:29:23,027
Speaker 1: Yep.

470
00:29:24,654 --> 00:29:33,450
Speaker 1: It looks like a sad wolf, dude, from- Yeah, so the deal with first ed, second ed, D&D was that werewolf and wolfware are both two different things, but they're both evil.

471
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,850
Speaker 1: Werewolves are humans who, because of lycanthropy, transform into wolves.

472
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:43,670
Speaker 1: Wolfwares are wolves who, because of reasons, turn into humanoid wolves.

473
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,010
Speaker 0: So they don't have the mind of a human.

474
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,330
Speaker 1: They have a mind of a wolf, but they can kind of turn into a man.

475
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,530
Speaker 0: So if there was a wolfware and a werewolf standing next to each other, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

476
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:57,170
Speaker 0: But one of them would transform back into a human, and the other would transform back into a wolf.

477
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:57,730
Speaker 0: Yes.

478
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,269
Speaker 0: And you wouldn't know which was which while you were just looking at it.

479
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:01,730
Speaker 0: Yep.

480
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:08,150
Speaker 0: So that's your D&D- so I bet there's plenty of people who played a D&D plot where it's like, our party member turned into a werewolf.

481
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,530
Speaker 0: Oh no, now we don't know which one is the werewolf and which is the wolfware.

482
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,888
Speaker 0: We don't want to kill our party member by accident, oh no.

483
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,804
Speaker 1: Where- I just can't believe you spelled a werewolf.

484
00:30:21,005 --> 00:30:21,709
Speaker 1: That's really funny to me.

485
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:22,988
Speaker 0: I don't know.

486
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:24,960
Speaker 1: What do I know?

487
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,389
Speaker 1: a wolfware from a werewolf?

488
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:27,870
Speaker 0: Software.

489
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:40,170
Speaker 1: But werewolves also, like, werewolf movies, the ones that were about werewolves, like you said, they always sort of had the exact same plot until relatively recently.

490
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,350
Speaker 1: At least all the ones I remember.

491
00:30:42,936 --> 00:30:44,810
Speaker 1: But like, vampire movies were all over the place.

492
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:53,050
Speaker 1: There were like, this one's the good vampire, or there were, it's literally just Dracula, or Blackulas, or all the different ways they go with vampires.

493
00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:02,028
Speaker 1: But werewolves are always just kind of, yep, it's almost always a dude turns into a werewolf and they have to kill, like, the werewolf that bit them to turn them back into a human.

494
00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:02,930
Speaker 1: Happy ending.

495
00:31:03,591 --> 00:31:08,870
Speaker 0: I think what it is, is, you know, there are comedic Frankenstein, right, you know, that's obvious.

496
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:09,690
Speaker 1: I mean the monsters.

497
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:10,839
Speaker 0: Right.

498
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,810
Speaker 0: There's plenty of comedic vampire.

499
00:31:14,323 --> 00:31:14,406
Speaker 1: Yep.

500
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,270
Speaker 0: But when you, you don't think, when you think of vampire, you don't think of, like, comedic vampire.

501
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,290
Speaker 1: Leslie Nielsen is a vampire.

502
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:24,550
Speaker 0: Right, you don't think of that first, right?

503
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,630
Speaker 0: When you think of Frankenstein, you don't think of young Frankenstein first.

504
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,790
Speaker 0: You think of that second, right?

505
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:36,830
Speaker 0: But when you think of werewolf, at least for me, I think of Teen Wolf, American Werewolf in London, like, those come first, right?

506
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:42,023
Speaker 0: I don't think of scary, anything with a scary werewolf that's coming to get you.

507
00:31:42,063 --> 00:31:44,670
Speaker 0: that's evil and dark first, right?

508
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:58,150
Speaker 0: So I think that contributes to the reputation of, you know, werewolf not being, you know, the sort of, you know, head honcho of scary monsters.

509
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, which I think part of it too, like, it comes back to movies.

510
00:32:01,512 --> 00:32:07,450
Speaker 1: The movies, the costumes for the werewolves usually were not, like, you couldn't really emote or act too much in them.

511
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,290
Speaker 1: Like Dracula can just dress fancy and actually act.

512
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:13,490
Speaker 1: Frankenstein's monster can stand there and act, like, pretty directly.

513
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,270
Speaker 1: Mummy is a simple costume.

514
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:26,550
Speaker 1: Like, it probably doesn't get in your way that much, but a werewolf costume is always all this, like, weird, ugly prosthesis and big mouth stuff that probably can't move that well for talking and looks weird when they talk.

515
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:28,110
Speaker 0: Especially in older movies.

516
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,250
Speaker 0: Newer movies, not a problem.

517
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:29,568
Speaker 0: Yeah.

518
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,730
Speaker 0: But you can do your acting when you're not in wolf form.

519
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,550
Speaker 0: It's just once you become a wolf that you have the problem of not being able to act, right?

520
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,950
Speaker 0: So you, it's the human character that you're sort of identifying with when you're in the story, right?

521
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,070
Speaker 0: Because, you know, and then once it becomes a wolf, it's just like, it doesn't even talk, really.

522
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:52,430
Speaker 1: I remember as a kid, I always wanted, like, a movie that was, like, about cool werewolves, but there really, like, weren't any.

523
00:32:52,911 --> 00:32:53,348
Speaker 1: At least not any.

524
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,370
Speaker 0: You would definitely have to go, you would have to go down the furry road where when you werewolfed, you could still talk, right?

525
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,997
Speaker 0: And I don't think that happens too often.

526
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,210
Speaker 0: Usually the werewolf is just, like, more of a beast, right?

527
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,709
Speaker 0: That just bites and attacks.

528
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:13,929
Speaker 1: So I did pull up this list, this Rotten Tomatoes thing of the 25 werewolf movies to watch, and I'm curious to see if we've actually seen all these, like...

529
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,590
Speaker 0: We probably haven't seen that many.

530
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,030
Speaker 0: I mean, Frankenstein meets the Wolfman, I've seen.

531
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,630
Speaker 0: Because, honestly, werewolf movies aren't really that great.

532
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,970
Speaker 0: I mean, if you look at these Rotten Tomatoes, most of them are...

533
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:28,542
Speaker 1: The Curse of the Werewolf is all the way up at 50 in 1961.

534
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,610
Speaker 1: Oh, shit, I think I have seen this movie.

535
00:33:31,991 --> 00:33:33,010
Speaker 1: I've seen Curse of the Werewolf.

536
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:37,590
Speaker 0: There are some of these that I've seen and don't remember a single thing about, right?

537
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:40,889
Speaker 0: So, like, yeah, I've seen Werewolf of London, what do I know about it?

538
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:43,130
Speaker 0: I can't remember, I have to watch it again, right?

539
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:44,690
Speaker 1: You know, people always say that one.

540
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,029
Speaker 0: I've seen Teen Wolf, I barely remember anything from it.

541
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,270
Speaker 0: I remember Teen Wolf pretty well.

542
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,089
Speaker 0: We saw Underworld in the movie theater, I remember nothing other than it was dark and gothy, right?

543
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:55,469
Speaker 0: I didn't remember that it had werewolves, I thought it was vampire-y.

544
00:33:57,012 --> 00:33:57,656
Speaker 1: Did I see that?

545
00:33:57,736 --> 00:34:00,470
Speaker 1: I still am not, I don't remember if I saw Underworld or not.

546
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:06,190
Speaker 0: I think we did in the theater, or maybe we saw... I don't remember what we saw.

547
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,248
Speaker 1: I don't know if we've seen it, based on this...

548
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:11,690
Speaker 0: We might have seen Dracula 2000 and thought it was Underworld.

549
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,230
Speaker 1: That is plausible.

550
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,130
Speaker 0: Or Dracula 20-something, it was Dracula something.

551
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,830
Speaker 1: Well, it's not Transylvania 6 5000.

552
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:28,629
Speaker 0: I think it was Dracula... I think we either saw Dracula 2000 or Underworld in the theater, and I remember nothing about either one of those.

553
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,507
Speaker 1: But I guess, Werewolf of London is like, everyone always points to it like, "Oh yeah, that's a classic werewolf

554
00:34:35,547 --> 00:34:35,688
Speaker 1: movie.".

555
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,750
Speaker 1: But I'll be honest, that movie's not that good.

556
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:46,049
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not bad, but it's obviously not good enough to be memorable, because all I remember about it is that I saw it.

557
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,790
Speaker 1: American Werewolf in London, because Werewolves of London is the song.

558
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:53,610
Speaker 1: But, did you ever see the sequel, American Werewolf in Paris?

559
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:59,011
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's also the movie that's on this list, which is just Werewolf of London, from 1935.

560
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,229
Speaker 1: I've never actually seen that one.

561
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:01,425
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

562
00:35:03,391 --> 00:35:04,849
Speaker 1: Wolfen... I think I've seen Wolfen.

563
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,469
Speaker 0: I've heard of Wolfen.

564
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:08,629
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of those.

565
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:18,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think also, it seems like as far as, you know, as like cultural phenomenon go, right?

566
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,710
Speaker 0: It's like, there are people who are like into zombies, right?

567
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,030
Speaker 0: Zombies are like a thing, right?

568
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,830
Speaker 0: You go to the store, you can find plenty of zombie things, right?

569
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,090
Speaker 0: There's several zombie properties, right?

570
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,550
Speaker 0: You know, you got your Knights of the Living Deads, and anything of the deads, right?

571
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:36,489
Speaker 0: And you've got your... what's the other one?

572
00:35:38,655 --> 00:35:39,226
Speaker 1: What, World War Z?

573
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:41,537
Speaker 0: No, that's one.

574
00:35:42,462 --> 00:35:43,990
Speaker 0: The one that was a comic and then became a TV show.

575
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,490
Speaker 1: Walking Dead?

576
00:35:45,193 --> 00:35:45,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, that one.

577
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,413
Speaker 1: What's going on?

578
00:35:46,434 --> 00:35:47,949
Speaker 1: You don't remember your zombie properties?

579
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:49,033
Speaker 0: Vampires!

580
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:52,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, vampires, you got plenty of vampire properties going on, right?

581
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, and vampires have had multiple reimaginings in recent history.

582
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,750
Speaker 0: You got your Anne Rises, you got your Vampire Hunter Ds, you got your Castlevanias, you got everything.

583
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:05,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember at the beginning of Vampire Hunter D, the girl is like, "Oh, so you're a vampire hunter.

584
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:06,925
Speaker 1: My father was a werewolf

585
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:07,246
Speaker 1: hunter.".

586
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:15,310
Speaker 1: And as a kid, much like Dammit Dwayne with the horses in your tenna, I remember as a kid, I was like, "Tell me about the werewolf hunters.

587
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:16,597
Speaker 1: Is there werewolf hunter D?

588
00:36:16,637 --> 00:36:18,086
Speaker 1: Is there a movie I can watch that covers

589
00:36:18,106 --> 00:36:18,207
Speaker 1: that?".

590
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,149
Speaker 1: Because I was in fourth grade, what the fuck did I know?

591
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:22,469
Speaker 0: That's right.

592
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:28,070
Speaker 0: But when you think about werewolves, there aren't big werewolf properties that have continued.

593
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:31,250
Speaker 0: Not like a TV show, I can't think of any comic book, right?

594
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:34,510
Speaker 0: The werewolf is like a side character in another horror thing.

595
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,430
Speaker 0: I think there was a werewolf in what, that Twilight thing had a werewolf, right?

596
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:37,722
Speaker 1: Yup.

597
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,319
Speaker 0: But it was like, yeah, wasn't that like?

598
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,070
Speaker 0: one was werewolf, one was vampire?

599
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:46,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the werewolves were weird and different.

600
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,270
Speaker 1: Which could be fine, I like reimagining monsters like that.

601
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, that's fine.

602
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,765
Speaker 1: But if you look at this list...

603
00:36:52,110 --> 00:37:04,209
Speaker 0: But I'm saying it wasn't a werewolf continuing property thing, where there became werewolf fans who were interested in werewolf content all over the place.

604
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:06,330
Speaker 1: I think most of those people either became...

605
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,490
Speaker 0: Those were zombie fans, they just want everything zombie.

606
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,028
Speaker 1: I think most people who are werewolf fans just became furries.

607
00:37:13,492 --> 00:37:13,924
Speaker 0: Uh, could be.

608
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:19,550
Speaker 1: Because I look at this movie list, the number one is the Wolfman, and number two is American Wolf in London.

609
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:26,450
Speaker 1: The Wolfman is like the archetypical, that is not a wolf, that is just a man wearing a dog costume.

610
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,590
Speaker 1: And it's got 90%, I remember the movie not being that great even as a kid.

611
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,790
Speaker 1: I guess the acting was good, but the movie was just not that great.

612
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:42,030
Speaker 1: And particularly, the werewolf transformation scenes were always extra shitty in these movies.

613
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:51,930
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes they were combination shitty, but also impressive at the same time, depending on the year it came out and the techniques that were used.

614
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a 40s movie gets a lot of a pass for like they were doing what they could.

615
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:56,911
Speaker 1: Right.

616
00:37:56,952 --> 00:38:02,389
Speaker 0: It's like simultaneously not good enough, but also like, "Oh, that's actually like the highlight of the film right

617
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:02,609
Speaker 0: there.".

618
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,050
Speaker 1: It's tricky though, because it's highlight of the film from its era, but also not good enough.

619
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:10,744
Speaker 1: But in the modern era, it just looks awful.

620
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,129
Speaker 1: Like it doesn't hold up.

621
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:29,430
Speaker 0: So the general, you know, the generic story of werewolf, right, is that somehow... This is the thing, is like despite werewolves being like this sort of, you know, second tier, second class monster, right, everyone knows how werewolves work.

622
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like you ask any random person like, "What's the deal with

623
00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:32,328
Speaker 1: Spider-Man?"

624
00:38:32,368 --> 00:38:32,670
Speaker 1: They know.

625
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,740
Speaker 1: Ask any random person, "How do you fight a

626
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,162
Speaker 1: werewolf?".

627
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:36,227
Speaker 1: They'll be like, "Yeah, Silver

628
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:36,609
Speaker 1: Bullet.".

629
00:38:36,971 --> 00:38:43,710
Speaker 0: And I think that comes from the fact that even though there isn't like something focused all about werewolves, right?

630
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:52,830
Speaker 0: If you look at any other intellectual property, story, thing, any syndicated property, any ongoing thing, right?

631
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,898
Speaker 0: You're gonna find a werewolf episode, right?

632
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:59,407
Speaker 0: You'll find like, you know, I don't know if this is true or not.

633
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:00,350
Speaker 0: I'm just guessing, right?

634
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,510
Speaker 0: It's like I'm thinking of things that have a lot of episodes.

635
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,810
Speaker 1: Like Adventure Time has multiple werewolf episodes.

636
00:39:05,532 --> 00:39:08,943
Speaker 0: Right, I'm sure that DuckTales probably has a werewolf episode.

637
00:39:09,365 --> 00:39:14,630
Speaker 0: I'm sure that, what else has a lot... I'm sure there's some Looney Tune werewolf episodes somewhere.

638
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,010
Speaker 1: Is there a werewolf in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure?

639
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,910
Speaker 0: Maybe, I don't know, but it's like just think of anything that has a lot of episodes and there's probably a werewolf episode in there somewhere.

640
00:39:24,891 --> 00:39:26,297
Speaker 1: Werewolf, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

641
00:39:26,357 --> 00:39:29,170
Speaker 1: There is a werewolf episode in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

642
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,365
Speaker 0: There's probably Spider-Man fights a werewolf probably, you know, here or there, right?

643
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:35,648
Speaker 0: You know, it's like... Werewolf arc!

644
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:37,630
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

645
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:45,490
Speaker 0: But yeah, that is why everyone knows about werewolf because it's like no matter what you're into, werewolf showed up at some point.

646
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:51,010
Speaker 0: Right, you know, and you know, it's like, yeah, if there's a full moon, the werewolves turn into a wolf uncontrollably.

647
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:54,449
Speaker 0: As soon as the sun comes back, as soon as the moon goes away, they turn back.

648
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,964
Speaker 0: If you get bitten by the werewolf, guess what?

649
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:57,790
Speaker 0: You're a werewolf now.

650
00:39:58,431 --> 00:40:04,510
Speaker 0: And if you need to kill him with a silver bullet, otherwise you can just sort of, even if you chop him up, like I guess they heal like Wolverine or something.

651
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:07,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that varies from like story to story.

652
00:40:07,545 --> 00:40:08,228
Speaker 1: Like in some cases...

653
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,364
Speaker 0: Obviously, even vampire rules vary as well.

654
00:40:10,384 --> 00:40:11,190
Speaker 1: Those are the basics, right?

655
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, like sometimes the werewolf is just a monster.

656
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:16,430
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's fully like cognizant of its situation.

657
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,970
Speaker 1: Though the latter is pretty rare and mostly more recent.

658
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:20,523
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep.

659
00:40:21,771 --> 00:40:26,440
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, and it's like, uh, werewolf... I don't know.

660
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:28,444
Speaker 0: What else is there to say about a werewolf?

661
00:40:31,491 --> 00:40:38,070
Speaker 1: Media in general always annoyed me because the rules were like nothing ever changed between all the media.

662
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,576
Speaker 1: And there was never an interesting story.

663
00:40:40,616 --> 00:40:40,998
Speaker 1: It was never.

664
00:40:41,058 --> 00:40:44,008
Speaker 1: like someone becomes a werewolf and it fucking kicks ass.

665
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:44,570
Speaker 1: Let's go.

666
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:46,550
Speaker 1: But there are vampire movies.

667
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:47,055
Speaker 0: That's true.

668
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:47,709
Speaker 0: That's a good angle.

669
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,830
Speaker 1: That's literally what bothered me as a kid is that vampires, there could be awesome vampires.

670
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,556
Speaker 1: But werewolves were never awesome.

671
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:57,410
Speaker 1: They were just a disease that had to be cured by the end of the movie.

672
00:41:00,051 --> 00:41:05,510
Speaker 1: I remember the movie, the werewolf media that I remember the most clearly, weirdly enough, is Stephen King's Silver Bullet.

673
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,180
Speaker 1: Pretty sure it's Gojo.

674
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:08,129
Speaker 1: You never did it, sir?

675
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:09,628
Speaker 0: No, I never heard of it.

676
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:10,353
Speaker 1: Really?

677
00:41:10,373 --> 00:41:12,109
Speaker 1: I want to say it came out in the 80s.

678
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,710
Speaker 0: You know how many things Stephen King has made?

679
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:20,409
Speaker 1: I've read Stephen King's fantasy novels that are not even published under his own name, so...

680
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,830
Speaker 0: They're not Dark Tower or whatever?

681
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:28,189
Speaker 1: Well, so they may be in the Dark Tower universe, if you ask him.

682
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:29,464
Speaker 0: Okay.

683
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,021
Speaker 1: But there's lore about that, I guess.

684
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:33,066
Speaker 1: I don't like the Dark Towers.

685
00:41:33,147 --> 00:41:33,730
Speaker 1: I didn't really care.

686
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:36,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never read a Dark Tower, so I don't know.

687
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I've read some of his fantasy books that might be in the Dark Tower universe, but were published under a different name.

688
00:41:42,112 --> 00:41:44,850
Speaker 1: And I did not know they were Stephen King at the time.

689
00:41:48,871 --> 00:42:03,550
Speaker 1: So, in 1539, Martin Luther, like the Martin Luther, used the word "Beerwolf" to describe a hypothetical ruler worse than a tyrant who must be resisted.

690
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,265
Speaker 1: And there's a whole article here on "Beerwolves," which I'm trying to figure out.

691
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:18,210
Speaker 1: this etymology, because I don't actually know... My knowledge of the origin... I know the origin of werewolf stories, like Vlad Tepes, that kind of thing.

692
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:27,130
Speaker 1: But the origin of werewolves, I mostly just know vaguely Scandinavian stories about people getting bit by wolves going crazy, probably just rabies.

693
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:28,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, but...

694
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,522
Speaker 1: But I don't know any deeper than that.

695
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:31,349
Speaker 1: Like, I've never really...

696
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:32,090
Speaker 0: I don't know anything.

697
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,889
Speaker 1: Looked into the history of werewolf stuff.

698
00:42:36,732 --> 00:42:37,850
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about it either.

699
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:41,408
Speaker 0: Why am I qualified to do this podcast about a thing I know nothing about?

700
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,229
Speaker 0: I'm just talking about what I do know.

701
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,290
Speaker 1: So where would you rank a werewolf then, compared to other monsters we might talk about?

702
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:50,479
Speaker 0: How are we ranking a werewolf, right?

703
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:52,850
Speaker 0: Are we ranking it in terms of how strong it is?

704
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,180
Speaker 1: Let's go by power level first.

705
00:42:54,382 --> 00:42:55,390
Speaker 1: How powerful is a werewolf?

706
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:55,646
Speaker 0: Power level?

707
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:00,290
Speaker 1: Like, on average, how powerful is a werewolf compared to Frankenstein's monster?

708
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,949
Speaker 0: Well, if we're going with the fact that a werewolf, when it's not in wolf form, it's a person, so that's garbage, right?

709
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:07,796
Speaker 0: It's not even monster level.

710
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:11,370
Speaker 0: So when it's in monster form, it doesn't have human brain, it has wolf brain.

711
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:14,585
Speaker 0: Which is still dangerous, because a wolf is dangerous.

712
00:43:14,606 --> 00:43:16,909
Speaker 0: You meet one in the woods... We're going with classic werewolf here.

713
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:17,991
Speaker 0: Right.

714
00:43:18,332 --> 00:43:24,390
Speaker 0: But, you know, that's obviously immediately losing to any monster that has human thought, like a vampire, right?

715
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,210
Speaker 0: It's like, no chance.

716
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:31,250
Speaker 0: Obviously, a real human with a gun beats a wolf, so a vampire could have a gun and just shoot the wolf.

717
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:34,309
Speaker 1: Gotta have a silver bullet, though.

718
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:45,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, a Frankenstein monster has slight human cognition, not as much as a vampire, but it's ridiculously strong.

719
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:53,390
Speaker 0: It could definitely beat a wolf in a fight, so I don't see a reason why it couldn't beat a werewolf in a fight, except it might not have a silver bullet available.

720
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:54,589
Speaker 0: That might be a disadvantage.

721
00:43:56,271 --> 00:44:06,550
Speaker 0: So it's like, I think that fact that if we're going with the "you have to use a silver bullet to beat in a fight," then it can't lose to anything that isn't intelligent enough to use a silver bullet.

722
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:11,446
Speaker 1: Yup, it's a lot like in D&D, where you got a regular sword, and maybe you also have a silver sword.

723
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:12,690
Speaker 1: you carry around just in case.

724
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,643
Speaker 0: So even if there was a monster that was ten times stronger than the werewolf, right?

725
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,630
Speaker 0: Let's say a Sharknado or some shit.

726
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,902
Speaker 0: Sharknado doesn't know anything about silver bullets.

727
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:27,169
Speaker 1: A sharknado cannot come after you of its own volition, like a werewolf can.

728
00:44:28,531 --> 00:44:31,710
Speaker 1: The shark in the Sharknado is not controlling the nado.

729
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:37,769
Speaker 0: There's some sort of Junji Ito-esque, you know, great white shark with legs that walks around on land, right?

730
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,105
Speaker 0: And it would just eviscerate the werewolf in terms of strength, right?

731
00:44:42,205 --> 00:44:43,370
Speaker 0: It's just so dangerous.

732
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:49,450
Speaker 0: But the werewolf wouldn't be dead, and the shark can't use a gun, so the werewolf is gonna win eventually.

733
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think about most media.

734
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:56,350
Speaker 1: I think about that's popular and known about werewolves, it's usually they beat the werewolf by tricking the werewolf.

735
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:58,715
Speaker 1: Because the werewolf is easily tricked.

736
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,385
Speaker 1: They lure it somewhere, and then they get it with the silver bullet.

737
00:45:01,405 --> 00:45:02,850
Speaker 1: Like, they gotta plant it in advance.

738
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,922
Speaker 0: Can't you just walk up to it and shoot it?

739
00:45:04,942 --> 00:45:05,690
Speaker 0: Why do you gotta lure it?

740
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:06,653
Speaker 1: I mean, where is it?

741
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:07,877
Speaker 1: Is it coming after you right now?

742
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:11,110
Speaker 1: Like, silver bullet, it's going around killing random people in the town.

743
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,870
Speaker 1: And this kid is trying to hunt it down.

744
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,618
Speaker 0: I see, I see.

745
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:15,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

746
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:15,950
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

747
00:45:16,292 --> 00:45:18,224
Speaker 1: We should watch Silver Bullet as a movie night.

748
00:45:18,325 --> 00:45:18,949
Speaker 1: Do a show on it.

749
00:45:21,032 --> 00:45:22,257
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good movie.

750
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:24,267
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's not, it's about the kid.

751
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,849
Speaker 0: It's more of a- It says 45% here on your Rotten Tomatoes list.

752
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:32,470
Speaker 1: Uh, Wikipedia says, an authoritative source, this film is considered a cult classic.

753
00:45:33,672 --> 00:45:33,955
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

754
00:45:34,016 --> 00:45:38,367
Speaker 1: That's not always a positive- Also, it's got both young Corey Haim and a young Gary Busey.

755
00:45:40,232 --> 00:45:40,493
Speaker 0: Okay.

756
00:45:41,622 --> 00:45:42,105
Speaker 0: One of the Coreys?

757
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:49,323
Speaker 1: But, uh, the movie mostly focuses on, like, it's more of a kids on bikes movie.

758
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:51,470
Speaker 1: Like, that genre than it is a werewolf movie.

759
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:55,530
Speaker 1: It just happens to involve a werewolf is the villain the kids on bikes are going after.

760
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,409
Speaker 1: It's basically just like a long-form episode of Scooby-Doo.

761
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's, when I think of werewolves, Scooby-Doo is honestly the first thing I think of.

762
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:06,190
Speaker 0: Someone pretending to be a werewolf is a Scooby-Doo villain.

763
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:12,070
Speaker 1: Yep, I might, if I think, if I hear werewolf, the first thing I think is, like, D&D werewolf.

764
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:15,269
Speaker 1: And then number two is Scooby-Doo werewolf, then everything else is after that.

765
00:46:16,171 --> 00:46:16,351
Speaker 0: Yep.

766
00:46:17,295 --> 00:46:20,648
Speaker 0: And yeah, after that is, you know, comedy movie werewolf, right?

767
00:46:20,668 --> 00:46:21,030
Speaker 0: Teen Wolf.

768
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:24,450
Speaker 1: But the Scooby-Doo werewolves were always, like, extra worthless.

769
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,850
Speaker 1: 'Cause they were, like, they were always, like, sadder than the regular old villains.

770
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,309
Speaker 1: 'Cause it is, of course, just like the old white guy in the end when they take the werewolf mask off.

771
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:36,190
Speaker 1: But, like, the werewolves in Scooby-Doo were never at any point threatening.

772
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,868
Speaker 1: Like, the pirate ghosts in Garfield were scarier than the werewolves in Scooby-Doo.

773
00:46:42,472 --> 00:46:45,370
Speaker 0: I mean, I think werewolves in general aren't that threatening.

774
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,450
Speaker 1: Well, look, they can only come out in the, like, under the light of the full moon.

775
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:52,990
Speaker 1: So they can't really, like, they can't get you most of the time.

776
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:56,790
Speaker 0: They don't have any, like, magical sort of power to them, right?

777
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:59,830
Speaker 1: Other than their Wolverine power to turn into a werewolf and not, uh...

778
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:02,609
Speaker 0: It's, like, you could just sort of, like, lock your house and they can't get in.

779
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:05,304
Speaker 0: Just not, not even for the Dracula reasons.

780
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:05,968
Speaker 0: It's, like...

781
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:08,009
Speaker 1: They could just smash the door down.

782
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:10,210
Speaker 0: Sure, okay, but it's, like...

783
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:11,490
Speaker 1: They often do in movies.

784
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,610
Speaker 0: They're not creeping around the corner, like, you know, over in Alien, right?

785
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:18,210
Speaker 0: Alien is, like, way more dangerous than a werewolf.

786
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,130
Speaker 1: I mean, Alien is more dangerous than anything we're talking about right here.

787
00:47:21,531 --> 00:47:21,631
Speaker 1: Ah!

788
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:24,310
Speaker 1: But what if a werewolf bit the alien?

789
00:47:25,775 --> 00:47:26,450
Speaker 0: Oh, shit!

790
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,770
Speaker 0: 'Cause now you got an alien.

791
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,490
Speaker 0: It's gonna get its teeth through the exoskeleton.

792
00:47:30,154 --> 00:47:31,590
Speaker 1: I don't know how deep you got a bite.

793
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,090
Speaker 1: That's never consistent.

794
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:37,970
Speaker 0: The Predator is way more dangerous than the werewolf.

795
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:39,350
Speaker 0: It's not even close.

796
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:41,270
Speaker 0: 'Cause the Predator can use a silver bullet.

797
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, Predator can hunt an alien.

798
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:43,405
Speaker 0: Predator probably...

799
00:47:44,131 --> 00:47:46,350
Speaker 1: Predator is literally, like, "Well, I'm gonna go hunt a werewolf.

800
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,730
Speaker 1: Let me get my specialized werewolf hunting spaceship.

801
00:47:50,331 --> 00:47:51,266
Speaker 1: Because that is my entire

802
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:51,510
Speaker 1: culture.".

803
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:56,769
Speaker 0: I think that's really... That is the thing, is that all of the... Even Frankenstein's monster, right, doesn't have any magical powers, right?

804
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:04,430
Speaker 0: But is still sort of supernatural in the fact that it is, like, not... It's, like, made of human body parts, like, resurrected.

805
00:48:05,274 --> 00:48:05,448
Speaker 0: You know?

806
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:22,610
Speaker 0: But, yeah, even though the fact that the werewolf transforms is supernatural and it can't be killed without the bullet or whatever, the lack of supernatural power is no form of mist or... It's literally not that much more dangerous to you than an actual wolf.

807
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:24,848
Speaker 0: Just slightly larger and scarier, right?

808
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:29,928
Speaker 1: I guess the main difference would be that one thing in a lot of werewolf media...

809
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,970
Speaker 0: And wolves, regular wolves, have a pack.

810
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,010
Speaker 0: A pack of regular wolves is way scarier than one werewolf.

811
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what about movies where there's a pack of werewolves?

812
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:38,724
Speaker 0: That's scary.

813
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:45,909
Speaker 0: I think that's what you have to do if you're gonna do the scary werewolf movie, is you have to have a whole pack of them.

814
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:50,550
Speaker 1: That is the plot of American Werewolf in Paris, the sequel to American Werewolf in London.

815
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:51,669
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

816
00:48:52,552 --> 00:49:02,730
Speaker 1: But the plot is also that the people who are werewolves make a drug that they can use to turn themselves into werewolves whenever they want, and it's really, really stupid.

817
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,730
Speaker 1: They also set up a romance between the main dude and the girl.

818
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:10,826
Speaker 1: The girl's the werewolf, and he's trying to cure her of the werewolf, like the lycanthropy.

819
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,670
Speaker 1: But, spoilers, this movie fucking sucks.

820
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:30,749
Speaker 1: They set up this romance, and then they have the scene where, like, she transformed into a werewolf, and it is just super gross, and, like, just not... The romance feels weird the whole movie after that scene, because of how gross the transformation is.

821
00:49:32,973 --> 00:49:33,917
Speaker 1: The movie is so dumb.

822
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,890
Speaker 1: Like, do not watch that movie under any circumstances.

823
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:42,970
Speaker 0: But I'm saying, just imagine a bunch of werewolves that move like a regular pack of wolves, right?

824
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:49,190
Speaker 0: And they have a villainous intent, a unified villainous intent, right?

825
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:52,829
Speaker 0: You know, I think that could be, that could work.

826
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:56,630
Speaker 1: Where I think werewolves work the best is actually in role-playing games.

827
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:11,570
Speaker 1: Like, that is where, like, if you're a game master, it doesn't even matter what the system is, werewolf is a similar type of plot to, like, body snatcher, in terms of, like, how you're gonna mess with your players, but werewolf just opens all these possibilities.

828
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:24,430
Speaker 1: Like, you may decide a character's a werewolf, and, like, stuff's happening at night, and the party's, like, trying to figure out who the murderer is, but one of the players is actually the murderer, 'cause it's a werewolf thing.

829
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:29,170
Speaker 1: I think I've literally played in that game two or three times in my life, playing D&D.

830
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:35,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that definitely works, because, you know, like I said, the werewolf is not a straight villain, and it's, most of the time, it's a normal person.

831
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:47,887
Speaker 0: So you're playing, you know, a character in some game, it's like, okay, we can, like, you can just tack werewolf on to whatever else you're doing, and it's not actually that disruptive to your, you know, your game.

832
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:53,861
Speaker 0: If you suddenly tack vampire on, or, you know, something else, that's, like, a huge deal, right?

833
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:54,768
Speaker 0: Can't go out in the sun.

834
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:57,708
Speaker 0: But vampire, basically.

835
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:58,714
Speaker 0: I'm a werewolf?

836
00:50:58,795 --> 00:50:59,602
Speaker 0: Okay, that's like a modifier.

837
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,010
Speaker 0: It's almost like equipping an item, like, it's pretty low tier.

838
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,110
Speaker 1: Also, there's a role-playing game, so you can roll with it.

839
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,309
Speaker 1: Like, maybe the whole party's like, let's just be werewolves now.

840
00:51:09,931 --> 00:51:10,680
Speaker 1: This is way better.

841
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,490
Speaker 1: I'm way stronger.

842
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,676
Speaker 0: We talked about that on Tuesday.

843
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:15,430
Speaker 0: Only that was regular wolf.

844
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:17,924
Speaker 1: I guess what it does is, it's, like, werewolf.

845
00:51:17,944 --> 00:51:23,750
Speaker 1: stories in games tend to be more around the mystery of who is the werewolf.

846
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:28,610
Speaker 1: Where vampire movies aren't usually, who's Dracula?

847
00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:32,030
Speaker 1: Like, Dracula's right there, how do we get him, is usually the plot.

848
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:33,979
Speaker 1: Or, how do we protect the person?

849
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,130
Speaker 1: he bit once before he comes back and finishes the job.

850
00:51:37,772 --> 00:51:45,090
Speaker 1: But they tend to know who the vampire is in a lot of vampire stories, because nobody knows who the werewolf is, and that's the plot of most werewolf stories.

851
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:48,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll just be night.

852
00:51:49,103 --> 00:51:53,170
Speaker 0: Someone's getting bit, and it's like, well, it could be anyone that wasn't with me, right?

853
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:55,848
Speaker 0: And I think that's why we think about the game.

854
00:51:55,888 --> 00:51:58,130
Speaker 0: Mafia, is also sometimes called werewolf, right?

855
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:01,390
Speaker 0: Because it's like, who is the one doing these murders, right?

856
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:03,890
Speaker 0: And it's like, mystery, who, we don't know.

857
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:05,869
Speaker 0: And even the person doing it might not know.

858
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,109
Speaker 1: That is the magic for a game.

859
00:52:08,431 --> 00:52:16,830
Speaker 1: When the culprit is a player who does not know they're the culprit, that, in almost any system, will lead to really, really fun moments.

860
00:52:20,072 --> 00:52:24,350
Speaker 0: But yeah, I guess that's all, I don't think anything else to say about werewolf, and I'm getting hungry.

861
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:29,969
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's people out there who know way, way, way, way more about werewolf than we do, so you should talk to them.

862
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, or wolfwares, if you want to talk about wolfwares.

863
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,490
Speaker 0: We're just trying to make an entertaining podcast, and you know, keep up our streak routine here.

864
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:41,350
Speaker 1: We stayed awake, 'cause like, vampires, I think we both have a lot more to say.

865
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:44,810
Speaker 1: I think I could talk about vampires a lot longer than I talk about werewolves.

866
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,989
Speaker 0: Partly due to the lack-- I've actually read Dracula, the book.

867
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:57,810
Speaker 1: I think partly, it's like you said, it's due to the relative lack of good and compelling werewolf stories that aren't the archetypical werewolf story.

868
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,890
Speaker 0: Like, we need a lot, we need more-- The werewolf is always an episode of something else.

869
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,849
Speaker 0: There's never the ongoing werewolf thing.

870
00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:05,949
Speaker 0: It's very rare.

871
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:11,950
Speaker 1: We need the deconstructed werewolf story, just like we got deconstructed magical girl, deconstructed vampire.

872
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,410
Speaker 1: We need really good deconstructed werewolf that isn't just their furries.

873
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:20,230
Speaker 0: I feel like there's definitely been plenty of attempts, but none of them have obviously hit it big.

874
00:53:22,212 --> 00:53:22,301
Speaker 0: So.

875
00:53:22,752 --> 00:53:23,930
Speaker 1: So, last thing before you go, one thing.

876
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,310
Speaker 1: So, the game Werewolf in Mafia, I did play that Among Us game.

877
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,950
Speaker 1: It's set in space, nothing to do with werewolves, but it's the same game.

878
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:30,798
Speaker 1: Yeah.

879
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:34,550
Speaker 1: It solves a fundamental problem of Werewolf in Mafia.

880
00:53:35,192 --> 00:53:41,410
Speaker 1: The Mafia, in this case the imposter, has to get away with their shit for real, live, and do stuff.

881
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

882
00:53:41,834 --> 00:53:43,050
Speaker 0: I've seen the game.

883
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,417
Speaker 1: I've played it with our friends.

884
00:53:44,498 --> 00:53:46,006
Speaker 1: It's actually really good.

885
00:53:46,027 --> 00:53:46,489
Speaker 1: You should play it.

886
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:47,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

887
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:57,230
Speaker 0: I've seen-- I was basically, you know, just following my Steam policy of, even though it's five bucks, my policy is don't buy the Steam game unless you're about to play it right this second.

888
00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:57,889
Speaker 0: That's a good move.

889
00:53:58,594 --> 00:54:00,730
Speaker 1: I bought it because I played it right that moment.

890
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, as soon as I'm about to play it right this moment, someone's like, "Hey, let's play it right

891
00:54:05,107 --> 00:54:05,309
Speaker 0: now.".

892
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,506
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Okay, five bucks, let's

893
00:54:06,526 --> 00:54:06,709
Speaker 0: play.".

894
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,769
Speaker 0: But I just haven't because that moment has not come yet.

895
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:11,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw what kind of game it was.

896
00:54:12,053 --> 00:54:12,216
Speaker 1: Yeah.

897
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:19,790
Speaker 0: Oh, and so last, we got a-- I saw a funny clip on Twitter where a dude walks in a room, sees another dude, and sees some legs.

898
00:54:21,172 --> 00:54:25,750
Speaker 0: With no torso on them and a bone sticking out with some blood spurting.

899
00:54:26,151 --> 00:54:31,645
Speaker 0: And then they leave the room, and then immediately the game stops, and it's like, "Who is the whatever

900
00:54:31,706 --> 00:54:32,210
Speaker 0: imposter?".

901
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:36,489
Speaker 0: And it's like the person who was in the same room with the legs.

902
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:42,330
Speaker 1: So the deal is you can't communicate during the game until-- But that person knew who it was.

903
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:42,690
Speaker 0: Exactly.

904
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,650
Speaker 1: Until a meeting is called.

905
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:53,350
Speaker 1: The only way to call a meeting is to find a dead body and do a thing to report it, or run all the way back to the cafeteria in the middle of the map and hit a button.

906
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:59,770
Speaker 1: So if you witness a murder, the murderer might chase you down before you get to that button.

907
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:00,905
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

908
00:55:01,092 --> 00:55:01,764
Speaker 0: That's very "They Were

909
00:55:01,805 --> 00:55:02,029
Speaker 0: Eleven.".

910
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:03,041
Speaker 1: It is very "They Were

911
00:55:03,081 --> 00:55:03,324
Speaker 1: Eleven.".

912
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:03,956
Speaker 1: Yeah.

913
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:05,070
Speaker 1: So that lets you eat.

914
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:06,298
Speaker 1: We have a question from the stream.

915
00:55:06,922 --> 00:55:07,970
Speaker 1: I think we can answer pretty quickly.

916
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:10,510
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the werewolf story in Skyrim?

917
00:55:12,872 --> 00:55:14,150
Speaker 0: I played Skyrim.

918
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:18,350
Speaker 0: I beat that game, and I do not remember any werewolf action.

919
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:18,613
Speaker 0: Ah.

920
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:27,810
Speaker 0: So that tells you how much-- Or it tells you the way I play Skyrim, because I've also played Oblivion and beat-- Those are the only two old scrolls.

921
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:30,130
Speaker 0: It was Oblivion and Skyrim, and I beat both.

922
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:33,026
Speaker 0: And I remember... not much.

923
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:34,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

924
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,310
Speaker 1: I was trying to think back to Skyrim.

925
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:37,281
Speaker 1: I was like, "Where were the

926
00:55:37,423 --> 00:55:37,809
Speaker 1: werewolves?".

927
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:39,648
Speaker 1: I didn't beat Skyrim.

928
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:40,588
Speaker 1: I gave up.

929
00:55:40,972 --> 00:55:42,610
Speaker 1: I got like ten hours in, and I just kind of--.

930
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,650
Speaker 0: I remember the start where I had to punch a dragon.

931
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:47,806
Speaker 0: I remember climbing up a mountain where there was like a yeti.

932
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:52,790
Speaker 0: And I remember yelling to knock bad guys down and then stab them with my sword.

933
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:55,390
Speaker 1: Did you get all three fus ro da, or are you just like fussing?

934
00:55:55,876 --> 00:55:56,130
Speaker 0: No, yeah.

935
00:55:56,557 --> 00:55:57,150
Speaker 0: I got the whole thing.

936
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:57,829
Speaker 0: I beat the whole game.

937
00:55:58,652 --> 00:56:03,470
Speaker 0: And then I remember at the end of the game, you went up this big mountain where there was a really big dragon, and then you beat him.

938
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:04,184
Speaker 0: And then there was--.

939
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:09,010
Speaker 0: Oh, you also went to this hall of like-- You went to Viking heaven, basically.

940
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:11,610
Speaker 0: A Norse-ish heaven place.

941
00:56:12,491 --> 00:56:14,690
Speaker 0: And you saw all the great champions there.

942
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:17,410
Speaker 0: And then after that, you beat the boss, or before.

943
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:19,509
Speaker 0: That's basically all I remember from Skyrim.

944
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,549
Speaker 1: Ah, you know what else we really need here?

945
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:26,870
Speaker 1: We need more non-wolf werethings to make these stories interesting, too.

946
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:28,229
Speaker 1: Give me some werebears.

947
00:56:29,472 --> 00:56:29,596
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

948
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:39,250
Speaker 0: I also remember from Skyrim, there was some sort of ancient, sort of a token-esque dwarven hold under the ground that had been abandoned.

949
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,150
Speaker 0: It was like a big factory kind of place.

950
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,709
Speaker 0: And I remember going down there and cleaning it out, and that's where all the good loots were.

951
00:56:46,471 --> 00:56:47,010
Speaker 0: All right, thank you.

952
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I remember from Skyrim.

953
00:56:48,451 --> 00:56:49,250
Speaker 0: I don't remember any werewolves.

954
00:56:49,891 --> 00:56:52,548
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're in there, but I remember them not.

955
00:56:58,772 --> 00:57:00,930
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

961
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:26,910
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

962
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,070
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

963
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:37,150
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Green, you're just like a dude guy.

964
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:40,290
Speaker 1: Graham Finch, you hold the key to my heart.

965
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,649
Speaker 1: There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out.

966
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:55,890
Speaker 1: Clinton Walton, Jay Bantz, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Nicholas Brandow, Chris Midkiff, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Finn, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their name.

967
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,509
Speaker 1: And Shervin Von Horl, because it short-sorted the list in a weird way.

968
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:04,350
Speaker 1: I'll never, at any point, edit whatever we do at the end of this show here.

969
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,370
Speaker 1: This stinger is always recorded in one take, no matter what happens.

970
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:09,170
Speaker 1: And I'll let you in on a secret.

971
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:16,450
Speaker 1: I usually don't know what the actual stinger is going to be until long after I've recorded this audio.

972
00:58:17,091 --> 00:58:20,990
Speaker 1: So now, I leave you with something you've definitely forgotten.

973
00:58:57,444 --> 00:58:58,820
Speaker 1: [singing in Japanese].
