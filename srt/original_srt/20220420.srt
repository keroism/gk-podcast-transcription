1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,446
Speaker 0: It's April 20th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,446 --> 00:00:09,647
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:12,996
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,923
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:21,600
Speaker 0: Tonight we're reviewing Goodbye, Eri, a one-shot manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

6
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:24,838
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,281 --> 00:00:28,486
Speaker 0: It's finally warm enough again.

8
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,831
Speaker 0: I woke up this morning.

9
00:00:29,872 --> 00:00:32,000
Speaker 0: It was too cold to bike to work, so I checked the subway.

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,260
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it was really cold for some reason in the morning.

11
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:36,897
Speaker 0: It was sunny, and I was like, "Huh, I

12
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:37,239
Speaker 0: wonder.".

13
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,240
Speaker 0: And then I touched the window, and it was freezing, and of course I didn't bike to work.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,320
Speaker 0: But now it was more than 20 degrees warmer when I left work, so I biked home.

15
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:54,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, the weather site has a bar for the temperature, and today's bar is a very wide bar, right?

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,116
Speaker 1: So the low was low, and according to this, it says the low today was 43, and the high today was 60 Fahrenheit.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,991
Speaker 1: Which is still not warm enough, but it's okay.

18
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:08,034
Speaker 1: It's much better than 43, that's for sure.

19
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,393
Speaker 0: Weather's been weird because a few weeks ago, Hunter Mountain, which is way north of here, and that's where I ski pretty often, was still open because they still had snow.

20
00:01:19,453 --> 00:01:20,619
Speaker 0: You could still go ski there.

21
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:24,740
Speaker 0: And the night before, it was like 20 degrees Fahrenheit.

22
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,656
Speaker 0: And then the next day, it was like a Saturday skiing was open.

23
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:29,600
Speaker 0: We didn't go obviously.

24
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:33,331
Speaker 0: It was 68 degrees Fahrenheit during the day.

25
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 0: You could have gone skiing in shorts and a t-shirt.

26
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you look at, you know, it seems like this weekend is gonna be the start of at least kinda not freezing fucking cold.

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,820
Speaker 0: Oh, this weekend I think is the weekend we're getting the bikes out and starting biking again.

28
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, this weekend is like the border where we cross over into, "Okay, at least it's not freezing.

29
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:56,539
Speaker 1: You can actually go outside now without some coats and

30
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:56,840
Speaker 1: shit.".

31
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,614
Speaker 1: You know, it's not warm warm yet, but it's like, "Okay,

32
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:01,095
Speaker 1: finally."

33
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:01,497
Speaker 1: Right?

34
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:02,320
Speaker 1: Not winter anymore.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,758
Speaker 0: I can go outside and just not react as opposed to now when I walk outside and go,

36
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:06,979
Speaker 0: "Eh."

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,120
Speaker 0: There'll be no more "Eh" until September, October, something like that.

38
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:12,900
Speaker 0: Finally.

39
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,400
Speaker 1: November.

40
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,419
Speaker 0: This felt like a particularly long winter for a lot of reasons.

41
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:20,812
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's real annoying that it's like, "Come on, it's the end of April

42
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:21,093
Speaker 1: already.".

43
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:29,596
Speaker 1: If we only get May, June, July, August, it's like, "Give me the six months of the

44
00:02:29,637 --> 00:02:29,977
Speaker 1: warm.".

45
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,000
Speaker 1: Not just four or five months.

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,033
Speaker 0: But also, it's extra bad because of COVID in that we're not eating indoors.

47
00:02:35,053 --> 00:02:37,220
Speaker 0: We're not going to restaurants, so we're extra isolated.

48
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,260
Speaker 0: But when it's warm out, there's outdoor dining, which is oddly freeing to be able to go do that.

49
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:50,579
Speaker 0: And we got a taste of it when it was warm a couple weeks ago, and then it was taken away, and it's finally back, sort of.

50
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:52,978
Speaker 0: Next week it'll be back, mostly.

51
00:02:55,401 --> 00:03:02,300
Speaker 0: So, the other thing I noticed, due to pure circumstance, we have not done a Wednesday Geek Nights in a while.

52
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,320
Speaker 0: We had a bunch of disruptions to Geek Nights, the whole unplanned hiatus, but funnily enough, Wednesdays took the brunt of it.

53
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,920
Speaker 0: I think we had a lot of hockey games that just happened to fall on Wednesdays.

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,120
Speaker 0: Things kept happening on Wednesdays, so there's a lot of old news.

55
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,700
Speaker 0: We're going to have a bunch of news before we talk about this anime.

56
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:21,951
Speaker 0: Or this manga.

57
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:23,420
Speaker 0: I'm going to talk about an anime as a Geek Byte.

58
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,820
Speaker 0: But I want to start with the news that brought back some memories, not pleasant ones.

59
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:49,520
Speaker 0: If you are about our age, and you went to anime cons in the mid-2000s-ish, like the mid-2000s was the time to seem to peak, there was a phenomenon where kids would buy from this one vendor at pretty much every anime con in America, these gigantic yaoi paddles.

60
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,128
Speaker 1: It was more like a miniature oar for a boat.

61
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 1: It's like when you go to a baseball game and you can buy the little souvenir baseball bat, and it's a small baseball bat.

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,640
Speaker 1: You can't actually play baseball with it.

63
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,919
Speaker 0: But you can whack someone with it.

64
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:04,404
Speaker 1: Sure, it's made of wood.

65
00:04:05,227 --> 00:04:09,500
Speaker 1: But this was like an oar, like you would row a boat with it.

66
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,452
Speaker 1: Only much smaller, like a miniature.

67
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,200
Speaker 1: But it was solid wood, right?

68
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,813
Speaker 1: And on it was written the word yaoi.

69
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,880
Speaker 0: And then it had a softcore side and a hardcore side.

70
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,794
Speaker 0: And I remember, I don't remember what year it was or even what con it was.

71
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,280
Speaker 0: I think it was Otakon.

72
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:29,585
Speaker 1: Otakon was the first time I saw them.

73
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:34,139
Speaker 1: I think it was Otakon, the second Otakon I went to, which might have been '03?

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,399
Speaker 0: The problem is it might have been Anime Central where I saw them first.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,820
Speaker 1: Okay, Otakon was definitely the first place I saw one.

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,920
Speaker 1: I even remember in the room where the booth was, wasn't the company Hendone?

77
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:48,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we'll get to that.

78
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:49,600
Speaker 0: I got another link.

79
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,298
Speaker 0: So I remember I saw them in the dealer's room and I was like, "Huh, that is slightly

80
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:54,579
Speaker 0: funny.".

81
00:04:55,562 --> 00:05:02,760
Speaker 0: And then bit by bit, people kept buying them and sure, that would be fine, but they became a problem.

82
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:11,460
Speaker 0: Because the people who were buying them were also being extremely disruptive with them in ways that are way beyond what you were even imagining.

83
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:24,760
Speaker 1: I think what it was is that the person selling them was always a very loud, wacky-waving, inflatable-arm-flailing human in the dealer's room.

84
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,180
Speaker 0: This was the kind of person, if I ran an Anime Con, I would have banned that company from my dealer's room back then.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:43,083
Speaker 1: Agreed, but it's also the kind of person where if I was an Anime Con dealer, I would hire to be my... ...tension-grabbing individual.

86
00:05:43,484 --> 00:05:49,697
Speaker 1: And for people like me, when I see that person there, even all those years ago, the person I was then...

87
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,140
Speaker 0: The AT field comes out immediately when someone like us sees this person.

88
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,648
Speaker 1: The person I was then was still repulsed.

89
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:59,958
Speaker 1: And when I saw that person, I was like, "Dope, stay away from

90
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:00,239
Speaker 1: that.".

91
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:14,400
Speaker 1: But the kind of person who would be attracted to that loud, ostentatious sales pitch is the kind of person who's gonna make trouble at your con.

92
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:23,000
Speaker 1: So even though, regardless of whether the paddles were being physically used for trouble, which they were on occasion...

93
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,500
Speaker 0: The people who were causing trouble were all carrying them.

94
00:06:27,101 --> 00:06:38,560
Speaker 1: Right, the people who were loud, obnoxious types of people were carrying these paddles because they were attracted to that person and were the kind of person who would buy that paddle.

95
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,356
Speaker 0: There was also another trend happening.

96
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:49,320
Speaker 1: People making trouble unrelated to paddles were equipped with paddles, and people who were making trouble with paddles were also equipped with paddles.

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,340
Speaker 1: So basically, almost everyone who had a paddle, it was strongly correlated with trouble.

98
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:04,620
Speaker 0: But this was also a time in American anime conventions specifically where trouble was on the rise and the cons were growing massively.

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,080
Speaker 0: In the late 90s and early 2000s, when we would go to anime cons, the average attendee...

100
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,457
Speaker 1: I think it was more mid-2000s.

101
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,759
Speaker 0: No, I'm saying this is before that trend.

102
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:21,000
Speaker 0: If when I went to anime cons in the late 90s or very early 2000s, the average attendee was about my age.

103
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,650
Speaker 0: I was between 17 and 20, and most of the people there were around that age or older.

104
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:38,160
Speaker 0: But by the mid-2000s, I'm now older, I'm in my 20s, but yet the average attendee at these cons was like 14, maybe even younger.

105
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:53,440
Speaker 1: Right, the con scene changed from being more like an old sci-fi con style type of deal with the viewing rooms and all that, into a more cosplay in the hallway, make a ruckus play Marco Polo.

106
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,780
Speaker 1: You know, panels and screening rooms aren't popular.

107
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,760
Speaker 0: Go listen to Geek Nights from like 2005, and we talk about this a lot.

108
00:08:01,643 --> 00:08:04,220
Speaker 0: So long not to make the whole show about the fucking yaoi paddle.

109
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,440
Speaker 0: So they were basically banned.

110
00:08:08,161 --> 00:08:15,800
Speaker 0: There was a moment a few years after they came out where one anime con... I think it was actually Anime Next that banned them first, but I don't remember.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,780
Speaker 0: But I'm pretty sure it was Anime Next, but one con banned them and banned that dealer.

112
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,800
Speaker 0: And then basically over the course of a few weeks, every anime con banned these fucking things.

113
00:08:27,061 --> 00:08:27,522
Speaker 0: Yeah,

114
00:08:27,602 --> 00:08:49,579
Speaker 1: I think there was a combination of banning the dealer, banning the specific object, banning various uses of the object, but also I think a lot of people just amended their general cosplay weapons policies such that that object, the yaoi paddle, and anything similar was just encompassed and they didn't need to make sort of specific carve-outs to attack that one thing.

115
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:54,693
Speaker 0: The news from February, because the company had been like, "This is all gone.

116
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:56,238
Speaker 0: These things disappeared from the

117
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:56,539
Speaker 0: world.".

118
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:58,331
Speaker 1: It was a flash in the pan.

119
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,559
Speaker 1: It lasted maybe a year or two.

120
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,199
Speaker 1: But it was big.

121
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:14,020
Speaker 0: At the end of February this year, a company did a Kickstarter to bring the yaoi paddle back, and people were really excited about this, and it was getting a ton of pledges right away.

122
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:25,140
Speaker 0: So, Shot and Chaser, my second news from early March, so about a week later, I'm just going to read the headline.

123
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:32,500
Speaker 0: It's from the Mary Sue, and we won't dwell on the topic because this article will go into more detail than I even remembered.

124
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,521
Speaker 0: I'm just kidding.

125
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:39,398
Speaker 0: The headline is, and I quote, "What is a yaoi paddle, and why was its Kickstarter taken

126
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:39,799
Speaker 0: down?".

127
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:42,816
Speaker 0: So, the entire...

128
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,060
Speaker 1: Because the inventor of the yaoi paddle, I imagine, sued them.

129
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:52,279
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the company that original wacky wavy inflatable arm-flailing dude, that whole company... He's still around.

130
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's around, but the company was like, "Uh, we still own the rights to those paddles, guys.

131
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,598
Speaker 0: Your Kickstarter is just illegal and we're going to sue

132
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:00,739
Speaker 0: you.".

133
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I could find some old super popular thing that was a big hit and start a Kickstarter, right?

134
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,352
Speaker 1: I could be like, "Hey guys, I got a Kickstarter for... I'm bringing back Furbies, guys.

135
00:10:13,372 --> 00:10:13,953
Speaker 1: Furbies.

136
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:14,915
Speaker 1: Remember those?

137
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:15,837
Speaker 1: Those were a big hit.

138
00:10:15,877 --> 00:10:16,579
Speaker 1: I'm bringing them back.

139
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 1: Kickstarter.".

140
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,570
Speaker 1: I'd be like, "Uh, you don't own

141
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:19,578
Speaker 1: Furbies.".

142
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:24,800
Speaker 0: So, this entire saga came and went during our Unplanned Geek Nights hiatus.

143
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,560
Speaker 0: So, the news is, you can go learn about this weird flash in the pan and how some weirdos tried to bring it back.

144
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:36,640
Speaker 0: In some other news, that's a pretty big deal and we're going to link directly to their statement.

145
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,551
Speaker 0: AnimeNext, which has always been a pretty solid AnimeCon.

146
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:41,655
Speaker 0: We used to go off and on.

147
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:42,800
Speaker 0: I've done panels at it before.

148
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:53,820
Speaker 0: They cancelled 2022 for very good reasons and it's actually kind of notable that an AnimeCon was able and willing to do this.

149
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,860
Speaker 0: There's a lot going on here to the point that we won't be able to cover everything related to this topic, but it's a big deal.

150
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:07,720
Speaker 1: There's so much going on, but AnimeNext is a con that has had its ups and downs, lefts and rights, good times, bad times.

151
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,619
Speaker 1: I went to it, I think, once ever.

152
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:12,687
Speaker 0: I went a bunch of times.

153
00:11:12,747 --> 00:11:13,390
Speaker 0: I did panels.

154
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:15,160
Speaker 0: I've added a couple years in a row.

155
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,085
Speaker 1: It was split into multiple buildings.

156
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:20,254
Speaker 1: It was near Giant Stadium in this Meadowlands-ish place.

157
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,357
Speaker 1: I think it's moved since then.

158
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,220
Speaker 1: It's not there anymore.

159
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:24,213
Speaker 0: Well, you remember, we talked about it a bunch.

160
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,000
Speaker 0: Remember where it moved to?

161
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:27,000
Speaker 1: No, I forget.

162
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,500
Speaker 0: Atlantic City.

163
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:28,622
Speaker 1: Oh.

164
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:31,159
Speaker 0: It was the beach AnimeCon.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,005
Speaker 1: Right.

166
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,859
Speaker 1: I never went to it, but I remember other people going to it.

167
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,520
Speaker 0: In fact, when it moved to Atlantic City, we got kind of excited because our thinking was we could start going again to do Anime panels there.

168
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,940
Speaker 0: And then just, instead of like Anime Boston, where then we're bored and just wandering around Boston, we just go to the beach when we're not doing panels.

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,480
Speaker 0: We were really into it, but for a bunch of reasons.

170
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:57,500
Speaker 0: Every year we wanted to go to AnimeNext after they moved to Atlantic City.

171
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,260
Speaker 0: There was always some other competing event or some reason we couldn't go and it just never worked out.

172
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,100
Speaker 0: But yeah, they cancelled.

173
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,840
Speaker 0: And they cancelled mostly because, if I had to really summarize it, the venue in Atlantic City tried to fuck them over.

174
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:28,920
Speaker 0: And they, unlike a lot of AnimeCons, had enough money, had enough moral character, and had enough just pure human fortitude to turn around to the venue that was trying to fuck them over and just tell them to fuck off.

175
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,405
Speaker 0: So they cancelled.

176
00:12:32,446 --> 00:12:36,420
Speaker 0: basically the venue, and you can read all the details, like this thing's really long what I'm going to link to.

177
00:12:37,021 --> 00:12:50,119
Speaker 0: The venue basically tried to, one, raise the prices, and two, basically said, "Yeah, we won't require our staff to wear masks or vaccinations or anything because we're an evil company that doesn't care about

178
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:50,439
Speaker 0: COVID.".

179
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,278
Speaker 0: And AnimeNext was like, "But we require those

180
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:54,640
Speaker 0: things.".

181
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:56,305
Speaker 0: And the venue said, "Well, fuck

182
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:56,566
Speaker 0: you.".

183
00:12:56,646 --> 00:12:59,375
Speaker 0: And AnimeNext said, "Well, we're not holding AnimeNext anymore.

184
00:12:59,455 --> 00:12:59,816
Speaker 0: It's done.

185
00:13:00,438 --> 00:13:00,578
Speaker 0: You're

186
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:00,839
Speaker 0: fucked.".

187
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:02,910
Speaker 0: But the way they went about.

188
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,619
Speaker 0: it is fascinating and you should...

189
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,600
Speaker 1: It wasn't the usual, like, you get in trouble because you didn't uphold your contract deal?

190
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,285
Speaker 0: Yep, they are holding the venue to the letter of their contract.

191
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:18,433
Speaker 0: They are technically running in AnimeNext, but it is not open to the public.

192
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:23,560
Speaker 0: It's a tiny little event for their own staff, and it's basically a way to get out of this contract.

193
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 1: Okay, but don't they still have to pay the venue?

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,926
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but they're paying the minimum they can pay.

195
00:13:30,207 --> 00:13:31,469
Speaker 0: There's no clawbacks.

196
00:13:32,431 --> 00:13:37,580
Speaker 0: They basically will be solvent and they're going to figure out what to do on AnimeNext 2023.

197
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:44,780
Speaker 0: I'm going to read two sentences from AnimeNext's statement because it really, really says it best.

198
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:54,259
Speaker 1: You know, because normally you'd think, "Oh, well, if they hold a smaller event, the venue saves money not having to do anything, you know, because it's such a small event, and gets paid as if the event was

199
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:54,700
Speaker 1: large.".

200
00:13:55,406 --> 00:13:56,820
Speaker 1: But it sounds like that's not what's happening here?

201
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,742
Speaker 0: That is not what's happening.

202
00:13:57,802 --> 00:14:06,920
Speaker 0: Basically, they can run a tiny closed-profile event, which means tons of things they would normally pay the convention center for aren't part of it anymore.

203
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,773
Speaker 1: Oh, so the contract didn't have, like, this large base price for all the square footage.

204
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:14,140
Speaker 1: It was, like, pay-what-you-use kind of deal?

205
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:15,442
Speaker 0: Sort of.

206
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:25,160
Speaker 0: I'm trying to stick to what is on this page because I have learned more from various people who have been emailing me about this, and I don't want to share anything that's not public.

207
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,540
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you can't share that, right?

208
00:14:27,401 --> 00:14:38,755
Speaker 0: But I'll read the statement, "Convention leadership, this is from AnimeNext, doesn't feel it is safe, in good faith, or financially responsible to hold AnimeNext 2022.

209
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,859
Speaker 0: Thus, our decision to call off all public-facing

210
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:42,460
Speaker 0: attractions.".

211
00:14:43,232 --> 00:14:43,640
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

212
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,670
Speaker 0: "Due to contractual obligations, we are still required to hold an 'event' within the convention center.

213
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:56,799
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we'd trigger multiple cancellation clauses, which would have a significant negative impact on our ability to have future

214
00:14:56,859 --> 00:14:57,119
Speaker 0: events.".

215
00:14:58,062 --> 00:15:00,190
Speaker 0: That is legalese for "Fuck you!

216
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,576
Speaker 0: Don't let the door hit you on the way

217
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:01,817
Speaker 0: out!".

218
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:07,673
Speaker 1: I wonder if they'll do something that, like, makes a mess in the... I mean, that only hurts the staff.

219
00:15:07,693 --> 00:15:08,380
Speaker 1: It doesn't hurt the content, right?

220
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:15,020
Speaker 0: They said they're basically going to hold a bunch of internal, staff-only workshops, team-building exercises, training.

221
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,720
Speaker 0: Imagine if at Kineticon, we had a weekend where we got all our staff together and just did, like, a dry run and training.

222
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,620
Speaker 1: Well, didn't Otacon do exactly that?

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,582
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

224
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:31,580
Speaker 0: In fact, me attending the Otacon training event was the last interaction we had with Otacon before they kicked us off the staff.

225
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, PAX used to have the bag stuffing was sort of their event, but then they stopped doing that.

226
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,228
Speaker 0: So, uh, good on ya, Anime Next!

227
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:42,320
Speaker 0: Like, I absolutely support what you did.

228
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:52,800
Speaker 0: It sucks that this convention venue was so shitty, is the best way to put it, especially about COVID, considering that, you know, I'm about to go to PAX East for a day.

229
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,760
Speaker 0: PAX East requires vaccinations, masks, and all sorts of nonsense.

230
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,205
Speaker 0: Well, no, good nonsense.

231
00:15:58,245 --> 00:16:00,759
Speaker 0: I say nonsense, but, like, they should be requiring these things.

232
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:33,640
Speaker 0: Uh, in some other, uh, very, very brief news, Anime Expo, many of you follow the Anime Expo Twitter account, and if you do, you may or may not have gotten @spammed with potentially thousands of notifications, because Anime Expo, an anime con I would never attend, for all the reasons we've talked about over the last 16 years of Geek Nights, uh, they let, they gave their Twitter account to NFT scammers by authorizing shady apps to use their official Twitter account.

233
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:50,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, whenever you go to, like, something that's like, hey, here's, you go to a website, and it's like, we'll tell you your most popular tweets, authorize us to connect to your Twitter account, and you say yes, well great, now they have, you just gave them permission to tweet on your account, and they start tweeting, right?

234
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,960
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's not, you know, I hate it when people say hacked, or, you know, this isn't even a phishing attack level of hacking, right?

235
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:10,099
Speaker 1: This was, Anime Expo, let some random app, whoever controls the Anime Expo Twitter account, let some random application access their Twitter account, and it started spamming lots and lots of messages to lots and lots of people.

236
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,420
Speaker 1: They did

237
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:27,160
Speaker 0: the equivalent of, if I walked out into the street, walked up to a random person, handed them my ATM card, and said, by the way, here's the pin, uh, go start telling me what my bank account is, like the balance is on a weekly basis, and I walked away and completely trusted that nothing bad would happen as a result of this.

238
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway.

239
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,900
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, don't, don't follow Anime Expo on Twitter, because I don't trust them.

240
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:33,440
Speaker 0: It's just funny.

241
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:34,839
Speaker 1: It's just funny.

242
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:45,098
Speaker 1: And some better news, uh, I haven't actually read more than, like, half a volume of this, but, uh, We have, I think we have all the volumes, but I've only read a few of them.

243
00:17:45,920 --> 00:18:03,300
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, Delicious in Dungeon, or Dungeon Meshi, right, is a pretty good manga, with the, you know, it's one of those fun RPG-ish premises where a bunch of characters have a, they're on an actual serious fantasy adventure, at least at the start, to rescue someone's sister.

244
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,300
Speaker 0: Like a D&D, Lotus War kind of thing is going on, basically.

245
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:31,100
Speaker 1: Right, right, well, they were, they were adventurers, they went into a dungeon, someone's sister got trapped by the bad guy, or something like that, and then they escaped, but she's still in there, and they're like, well, we have to go back in the dungeon, but they're poor, and poorly equipped, and, but they're in a hurry, right, so they go in there, they go back into the dungeon to try, on a rescue mission, and, you know, they don't have, like, good supplies or anything, right?

246
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:45,740
Speaker 1: But they meet a dude who knows how to live in the dungeon, and cook dungeon things, so it's sort of, like, fake cooking show, almost, where, ah, we killed these mushroom monsters, let me show you how to cook 'em, right?

247
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:57,440
Speaker 1: And it's all about, you know, so that becomes the focus there, while this, within the greater plot, and it's, you know, it's a very popular and high-quality manga, if you're not, it's really funny.

248
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:07,760
Speaker 1: So, to no surprise to no one, it is gonna get adapted into an anime that was announced a while ago, but we just haven't done a show in so long that we haven't mentioned it.

249
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,040
Speaker 0: Yup, March 14th was when that was announced.

250
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:12,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, like a month ago.

251
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:13,272
Speaker 0: Yup.

252
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:27,000
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm kinda excited for that, that might get me to sign up for, I'm currently subscribed to absolutely no streaming services, other than Amazon Prime Video, because I still have Amazon Prime, so that might get me to turn one back on.

253
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,624
Speaker 0: Well, that means you can't watch the show.

254
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:35,400
Speaker 0: I'm about to Geek Bite, so I watched The Orbital Children, which is an anime, I think it's-- Oh, I could've watched that, I had Netflix.

255
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:47,520
Speaker 0: It's short, it's not that long, it's on Netflix, it's a one-season short anime, it's by the guy who did Dennocoil, which is a fantastic show, and-- Oh, that's also on Netflix.

256
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:47,840
Speaker 1: This is a

257
00:19:48,361 --> 00:20:08,480
Speaker 0: serious, hard sci-fi set in the near future, it's about AIs, and corporate libertarian dystopia, and the future of NASA, and it is, I think it is the best anime I have seen in, that is not a movie, like the best anime TV show, possibly in years, it was so good.

258
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:21,489
Speaker 0: My soul geek bite is, I'm not even going to tell you anything more about it, I'll say two things, one, just watch it, there's absolutely no reason not to watch this show, and two, if you have read the E.N.M.

259
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,533
Speaker 0: Banks Culture Books, or if you're a fan of Star Trek, but more the E.N.M.

260
00:20:25,553 --> 00:20:34,040
Speaker 0: Banks Culture Books, it is extremely plausible to say that this is the, like, prequel to the Culture Books.

261
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,783
Speaker 0: Like, how did humans get to that point?

262
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:38,525
Speaker 0: Like, what happened to humans?

263
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:50,800
Speaker 0: This show covers a lot of really interesting topics, pretty deeply, and with a lot of nuance, and you will be shocked and surprised at some of the twists that it takes along the way.

264
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,259
Speaker 0: I cannot praise the show enough.

265
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,100
Speaker 1: I think the next anime I'm going to watch, that I want to watch, is this one that a lot of people are hyping up, called YA BOI KANG ME.

266
00:21:01,221 --> 00:21:04,999
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I just saw the trailer to that a couple days ago.

267
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:20,140
Speaker 1: But apparently, the only legal, the only United States legal streaming source is HIDIVE, which I've never had an account for, so, I think I might either A, get a free trial to HIDIVE, and try to watch it all really quick.

268
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,519
Speaker 0: Because we gotta review the YA BOI KANG ME.

269
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:33,300
Speaker 1: I don't know if all the episodes are out, so it's like if I get a free trial, it's like I might watch all the episodes, and then the free trial might end before the show finishes, so I gotta see if all the episodes are out.

270
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,148
Speaker 0: Well, I leave it to you to coordinate.

271
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:37,280
Speaker 0: Tell me when I have to get an account.

272
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, or I'll just go ARRRRRRRRR.

273
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:43,369
Speaker 1: Or maybe there's other things.

274
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,200
Speaker 1: on HIDIVE I want to watch, and I'll pay for an account for a little while, who knows.

275
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:56,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, just go, I'll link to it, just watch what appears to be the opener to this show, and you don't need to know anything else about it.

276
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,740
Speaker 0: You will know from that opener if you care about this show or not.

277
00:22:02,543 --> 00:22:04,119
Speaker 0: That's all I'm going to say about that.

278
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:13,460
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, I got a really little thing.

279
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,460
Speaker 0: So this is a tweet with four images in it, but it also links to an AP article.

280
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,098
Speaker 0: So a famous surrealist, photographer, and photo montage person, Jerry Welsman, has died.

281
00:22:25,138 --> 00:22:26,482
Speaker 0: He was 87.

282
00:22:26,482 --> 00:22:32,720
Speaker 0: Basically, he was making, among other things, photoshops before Photoshop existed.

283
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,200
Speaker 0: Just in dark rooms, using what are by modern standards, ancient techniques.

284
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:48,480
Speaker 0: And his work is honestly breathtaking, and it is amazing what you could do with that kind of technology that a lot of people don't really understand.

285
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:52,933
Speaker 0: Just look at these images, look up this guy's work.

286
00:22:53,034 --> 00:22:54,700
Speaker 0: This is some pretty fascinating stuff.

287
00:22:57,082 --> 00:23:07,580
Speaker 1: Alright, so in the 90s, if you went to the movie theater, you were always going to be hearing stuff about THX, Dolby Digital.

288
00:23:08,901 --> 00:23:14,980
Speaker 1: Before the 90s, really, when I was really young, movie theaters were just like stereo sound.

289
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,540
Speaker 1: They had big sound systems, but they weren't special in any way.

290
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,560
Speaker 0: Not even as a kid, there was a cheap theater we went to, we knew it was mono, there was one big speaker you could see.

291
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:34,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the idea that movie theaters were going to do this surround sound thing was a new thing in my lifetime at a point that I remember it.

292
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:41,539
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I remember going to movies where it was advertised like, "This movie is in fucking surround sound at select theaters

293
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:41,940
Speaker 0: only.".

294
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,620
Speaker 0: And in those theaters, it was like one room had it.

295
00:23:46,262 --> 00:24:00,720
Speaker 1: But now, at the point in my life where I understood technology and cared about technology and thought about technology, to where I understood how that worked, was already a point at which movie theaters just had hard drives.

296
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:10,120
Speaker 1: It's like if you go to a movie theater today, the movie shows up at the movie theater on some hard drives or whatever, and they stick them in, and they just press play.

297
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:15,120
Speaker 1: It's no different than what you do at home, only much, much fancier, right?

298
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,749
Speaker 1: It's not compressed and whatnot, right?

299
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:19,958
Speaker 1: They got a fancy projector, et cetera, et cetera.

300
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,175
Speaker 1: But I never really thought about how the hell did Dolby Digital work in 1993, 4, something like that, right?

301
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Speaker 1: It's like they had Dolby Digital surround sound then, how did they deliver that to the movie theater?

302
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,419
Speaker 1: And if you had asked me that question before I knew the answer, right, which was my favorite day of the year.

303
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,120
Speaker 0: I weirdly did know the answer, but not that long ago, and for weird reasons I learned this.

304
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:59,119
Speaker 1: If you had asked me prior to me seeing this thing of the day, which I saw not that too long ago, I would have said, "Well, I guess they must have sent some sort of DAT tapes, like in one for each channel, and they must have pressed

305
00:24:59,139 --> 00:24:59,239
Speaker 1: play.".

306
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,580
Speaker 1: Or they pressed play on them all at the same time, and they synchronized them somehow, right?

307
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:11,020
Speaker 0: See, that's a load-bearing somehow, because doing that is literally almost impossible.

308
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:16,500
Speaker 1: It is indeed impossible, but I couldn't, you know, what other way could I think of doing, right?

309
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,800
Speaker 1: I mean, they're quadraphonic vinyl records, I guess, however those work, right?

310
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,620
Speaker 1: Or you have multiple tracks on like a really wide magnetic tape, I guess, they could have done that.

311
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,540
Speaker 0: But of course, that even opens the question of how is the audio even encoded before it was digital on film?

312
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,839
Speaker 0: Which is also answered by your thing of the day.

313
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:46,500
Speaker 1: Well, there were a lot of movies, well, back in, there were movie theaters where you would just have a separate, you know, you had the film, and then you had the audio on a separate, you know, recording, and you would play them both at the same time, right?

314
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,420
Speaker 0: That actually was rare or nonexistent, and usually that was solely music.

315
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:56,980
Speaker 1: Right, and those silent films, you had a person just fucking play in music while the movie was playing.

316
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Speaker 1: But anyway, so apparently the way it works, which is obvious once you see it, is in the space on the side of the film, that's not, you know, that's not showing up, you know, on the screen in front of you.

317
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,219
Speaker 0: Like literally where the little teeth are.

318
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,280
Speaker 1: Right, they're called the sprockets, right?

319
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:19,100
Speaker 1: So basically in between the sprockets and also next to the sprockets is more space that's unused, right?

320
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,659
Speaker 1: You don't see that, that's not showing up on the screen.

321
00:26:22,201 --> 00:26:45,079
Speaker 1: So they just encode digital audio data and time synchronization data in what looks like QR codes in that space, and then there's a, while the projector is playing the film, there's an optical device that's shining through those, you know, little, you know, basically two-dimensional barcodes on the side of the film.

322
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:47,099
Speaker 0: So 24 QR codes per second.

323
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:59,940
Speaker 1: Right, they're sending that digital data to basic, a special computer that decodes it, and then that decoding device connects to the amplifiers, which then connect to the sound system.

324
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,900
Speaker 0: Alright, 96 QR codes per second, each of which includes a bunch of digital data.

325
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,662
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

326
00:27:06,702 --> 00:27:18,208
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day is, you know, basically it's like they went out and they got the cheapest old film they could get, which is basically like trailers, right?

327
00:27:18,228 --> 00:27:25,545
Speaker 1: And you know, it's like a full explanation here of like exactly how many bits are in there, kind of how it's encoded.

328
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:28,454
Speaker 1: If you go on YouTube, you actually saw a video.

329
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:33,437
Speaker 1: someone had one of the decoding machines, they got real cheap because who the hell needs one of those anymore, right?

330
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,088
Speaker 1: And showed you how it worked and everything.

331
00:27:36,169 --> 00:27:43,139
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's really obvious when you see it, but it's also a genius and it's not something a lot of people have seen.

332
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:49,099
Speaker 1: Because it's sort of a technology that existed at that moment and now is gone, right?

333
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:56,870
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is Nine Fox Gambit.

334
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:58,332
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

335
00:27:59,134 --> 00:28:01,582
Speaker 1: So yeah, the listener really wanted us to read this book.

336
00:28:01,983 --> 00:28:09,089
Speaker 1: I read it already, now Rym's gonna read it, then a bunch of other listeners gonna read it, and then we're gonna talk about it in a few months from now.

337
00:28:09,852 --> 00:28:13,562
Speaker 1: It's a sci-fi space book with a rocket ship on a space station.

338
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:23,010
Speaker 1: on the cover of the book, and there's space battles, but of course there's also a lot of allegories involving pretty much everything.

339
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:36,050
Speaker 1: Democracy, time, calendars, solipsism, immortality, morality, just so much is going on there.

340
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,509
Speaker 0: All the good sci-fi stuff.

341
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:44,850
Speaker 1: All the good things you have in a serious sci-fi book that wins and is or nominated for many awards.

342
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:51,030
Speaker 1: And there's also more books in this series, so I haven't read any of them.

343
00:28:51,350 --> 00:29:05,845
Speaker 1: But knowing Rym, if we look historically, every time I've chosen a book club book that is in a series, Rym immediately reads the entire series, and even though I'm the one who chose it, I get maybe part way through, or I just stop immediately.

344
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,513
Speaker 1: I don't know how this happens.

345
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:11,410
Speaker 0: I consciously chose to read a couple more books of The Wheel of Time.

346
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,030
Speaker 0: You even read a couple more books.

347
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,080
Speaker 1: I picked Wheel of Time.

348
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,170
Speaker 1: Didn't I pick Wheel of Time?

349
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,170
Speaker 0: You did, and you even read a couple more books.

350
00:29:18,751 --> 00:29:21,124
Speaker 1: I read three or four Wheel of Times.

351
00:29:21,164 --> 00:29:22,170
Speaker 1: You read every Wheel of Time.

352
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,330
Speaker 0: So I consciously chose to read the next three or four, but then I woke up from a fugue state and I read them all.

353
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:30,529
Speaker 1: Somehow.

354
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,523
Speaker 0: I don't regret it.

355
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,179
Speaker 1: You read every culture book.

356
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,390
Speaker 1: I read like two and a half.

357
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,389
Speaker 0: You should read more culture books.

358
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:38,330
Speaker 1: Maybe.

359
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:41,630
Speaker 0: So, use of weapons in the chair.

360
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:48,890
Speaker 0: There's a thing going on in the Ukraine war that Ukraine is basically wielding the chair as a weapon right now.

361
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,802
Speaker 0: There's a really interesting information war that is happening right now in real life.

362
00:29:54,082 --> 00:29:57,090
Speaker 0: that is directly analogous to what happens in use of weapons.

363
00:29:57,692 --> 00:30:03,210
Speaker 1: In other Metamoment news, I have made significant progress on the new Geek Nights website.

364
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,069
Speaker 0: And I replaced the blue one that is up on the screen right now.

365
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,745
Speaker 1: Yes, and so I'm not shit talking here.

366
00:30:11,825 --> 00:30:12,970
Speaker 1: I'm not going to set a deadline.

367
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:18,830
Speaker 1: But what I will say is that the chunk of work that I have just completed is the largest individual chunk.

368
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:25,510
Speaker 1: All the remaining chunks added together are probably still greater than the amount of work that I've done.

369
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:27,269
Speaker 1: So I guess I'm not halfway there yet.

370
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:33,470
Speaker 1: But all of those remaining chunks are individually smaller than the chunk I just completed.

371
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:41,850
Speaker 1: Therefore, I should be able to, you know, do each one in like, you know, some set of hours each and move things right along.

372
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:49,370
Speaker 1: The next thing I'm doing is, you know, the most requested, most important functionality of actually being able to search.

373
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,029
Speaker 1: So I hope you're excited for that.

374
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,490
Speaker 1: A good search for the podcast is, you know, there's only so many episodes to search through.

375
00:30:57,610 --> 00:31:00,590
Speaker 1: It's not like a Google-level difficult search problem.

376
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,798
Speaker 0: And also, none of you have that.

377
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,310
Speaker 0: Like, I have access to the current backend.

378
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,750
Speaker 0: I can search for Geek Nights episodes way better than you can.

379
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,370
Speaker 1: We're going to do a better search than that.

380
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,992
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, we are.

381
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,101
Speaker 0: But that's working out okay for now.

382
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:12,270
Speaker 0: But the listener has even less.

383
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, the listener doesn't have that.

384
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:24,630
Speaker 0: What's funny, if I Google, if I just Google for, like, things like Geek Nights and, like, not Sitefrontrecruit.com, but like Geek Nights and topics we've done, usually what I find is the old Geek Nights forum.

385
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's out there.

386
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,739
Speaker 0: So, uh, no.

387
00:31:28,961 --> 00:31:30,110
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we'll get right into it.

388
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:41,970
Speaker 0: So if you're not familiar with Tatsuki Fujimoto, you're probably familiar with Chainsaw Man, which is a, if you've heard of it, it's a pretty popular manga coming up to its conclusion.

389
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,479
Speaker 1: We did an episode on it already.

390
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:45,490
Speaker 1: It's also going to get an anime adaptation.

391
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:47,533
Speaker 1: It's also done.

392
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,158
Speaker 1: I've read every volume of it.

393
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:53,270
Speaker 1: The final English volume of Chainsaw Man is coming out in two months.

394
00:31:53,791 --> 00:32:00,190
Speaker 1: If you want to order it, you order it right now because, you know, from either, you know, from your comic book store or wherever.

395
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,163
Speaker 1: It's available for pre-order immediately.

396
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:04,390
Speaker 1: It'll be here in a couple months.

397
00:32:04,753 --> 00:32:06,490
Speaker 1: And that would be the last English volume.

398
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:10,049
Speaker 1: If you can read Japanese, you can read all of Chainsaw Man right now.

399
00:32:10,331 --> 00:32:13,650
Speaker 1: Or, if you get piracy, I'm sure you can read it all right now as well.

400
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:20,625
Speaker 0: So, the mangaka released a one-shot single manga.

401
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:21,727
Speaker 0: It's like 200 pages.

402
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:22,990
Speaker 0: It's one story.

403
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,156
Speaker 1: It's 200 pages, but they go by fast.

404
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,807
Speaker 1: I read it, like, right before work one day.

405
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:29,870
Speaker 1: It didn't take long.

406
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:32,500
Speaker 0: Oh, I think the link was posted.

407
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,263
Speaker 0: I don't know if you posted it.

408
00:32:33,283 --> 00:32:34,890
Speaker 0: Someone posted it in the forum, I think.

409
00:32:35,392 --> 00:32:36,798
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Ooh, what's

410
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:37,080
Speaker 0: this?".

411
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:39,370
Speaker 0: And I just clicked through it, and then I was done.

412
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,646
Speaker 0: And I was laughing out loud, and then I went to our Discord to be like,

413
00:32:42,948 --> 00:32:43,190
Speaker 0: "Hey!".

414
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,250
Speaker 0: And everyone was reading it, and it was already a thing.

415
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:47,975
Speaker 0: So, goodbye, Eri.

416
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:51,909
Speaker 0: We're not going to spoil anything, but what I'll say is this.

417
00:32:53,231 --> 00:32:57,669
Speaker 0: There are some content warnings about it, where maybe some people may not want to read it.

418
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:05,190
Speaker 0: But if you are capable of reading it, I absolutely recommend you just go read it without knowing anything about it.

419
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,695
Speaker 0: It covers a lot of ground.

420
00:33:08,317 --> 00:33:10,222
Speaker 0: It is a fascinating story.

421
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:13,210
Speaker 0: It surprised me several times.

422
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,814
Speaker 0: It's sad.

423
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:17,290
Speaker 0: It's also extremely hilarious.

424
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,313
Speaker 0: But content warning.

425
00:33:19,774 --> 00:33:21,460
Speaker 0: It involves suicide.

426
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:24,650
Speaker 0: It involves the death of loved ones, the death of parents.

427
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,299
Speaker 0: It involves serious illness.

428
00:33:27,284 --> 00:33:28,410
Speaker 0: It involves bullying.

429
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,470
Speaker 0: This is not light subject matter, despite the fact that it is literally hilarious.

430
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:37,257
Speaker 0: So, goodbye, Eri.

431
00:33:37,277 --> 00:33:41,670
Speaker 0: If I had to describe it, it kind of just starts out in the middle of the story.

432
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:56,230
Speaker 0: And the framing is interesting because almost all the panels are laid out like it is someone holding a cell phone and capturing what's happening around them, because that is literally what this manga is.

433
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:05,650
Speaker 0: It is the story of a kid capturing events around him through his cell phone, almost living his life through capturing the events in the cell phone.

434
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:15,710
Speaker 0: And occasionally, you get large spreads, like large showings of what has happened around this kid, not through the cell phone.

435
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:18,870
Speaker 0: Like big single page or multi-page spreads.

436
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:32,610
Speaker 0: And what it's about is a kid whose mom and dad have asked him to video everything that happens in their mom's life because the mom is dying of a terminal illness.

437
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:37,370
Speaker 0: And she wants there to be a record of her life and a record of her interactions with her kid.

438
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:39,989
Speaker 0: And that's basically what this thing is about.

439
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:57,070
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I think, you know, you read this thing and it's like, there's just some sort of, you know, in one sense, it's a little bit cliche in the sort of, right, you know, it's a manga, but it's, you know, a movie within a movie within a movie deal, right?

440
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:07,290
Speaker 0: You see this happen a lot whether, you know, there's the itself, there's the story being told within the cell phone in the manga.

441
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:13,490
Speaker 0: But then there's the movie that is actually made by the kid via the cell phone in the manga.

442
00:35:14,492 --> 00:35:18,570
Speaker 1: Right, you know, you've got whether it's like fucking, you know, singing in the rain, right?

443
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:19,258
Speaker 1: Or it's...

444
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:28,910
Speaker 0: But then there's also the girl he meets who is watching movies with him in the manga where he is making movies about that.

445
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:30,910
Speaker 0: There's layers here.

446
00:35:31,571 --> 00:35:39,730
Speaker 1: And then, of course, you know, there's Paprika and then there's Inception, which, you know, he wasn't allowed to make live action Paprika, so he made Inception instead, right?

447
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,010
Speaker 1: You know, all that stuff.

448
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,270
Speaker 0: Even Millennium Actress with the blurring of fantasy and reality or film and reality.

449
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,351
Speaker 1: Yeah.

450
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:48,036
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's a lot like that.

451
00:35:48,116 --> 00:35:52,250
Speaker 1: where, you know, this sort of like, are you watching the recording now?

452
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:59,790
Speaker 1: Or is there a recording of him making a recording of something else and you're watching that, right?

453
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:02,510
Speaker 1: You know, watching even though it's a manga, right?

454
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,690
Speaker 0: It's ambiguous at many points.

455
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:10,230
Speaker 0: Many things will happen and you will think to yourself, did that happen in his movie?

456
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,037
Speaker 0: Did it happen in the real world?

457
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,670
Speaker 0: or did it happen in other frame of reference?

458
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:15,568
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,249
Speaker 0: And it's not resolved.

460
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:23,308
Speaker 1: There are certain frames that are obviously, you know, in a film on some layer, right?

461
00:36:28,092 --> 00:36:33,970
Speaker 1: Where, you know, there's something happens in that frame that is clearly supernatural or unrealistic.

462
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:41,690
Speaker 1: And so you have to assume that that's not something that happened in the real world, even though the entire work is a work of fiction, right?

463
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:43,489
Speaker 1: None of it's in the real, real world.

464
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:52,110
Speaker 1: But, you know, if there is a base real world on which all of, you know, in the fiction, right, on which those things are resting.

465
00:36:52,630 --> 00:37:01,129
Speaker 1: But there are some things that are clearly not happening in it and some that are or some that are presented as if they are and that are immediately revealed not to be.

466
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,710
Speaker 1: It's like someone will be doing something and you'll think it's a real scene.

467
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:12,230
Speaker 1: And then immediately the next page, it's like the cell phone is in the shot and the person is like, did I do a good acting job?

468
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:12,709
Speaker 0: Yeah.

469
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:13,068
Speaker 0: Right.

470
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:21,250
Speaker 0: And also some of the frames will be like blurry or at the wrong angle or off center, but then other things will be extremely like well framed and in focus.

471
00:37:22,071 --> 00:37:42,730
Speaker 1: Well, and sometimes like that person who just said, you know, they did a good acting job, but also you get the idea that they were what they were acting was not just something that was, you know, I guess in the fiction written for them, but was, you know, a reenactment of something real that happened that just wasn't captured on film when it happened originally.

472
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:52,030
Speaker 1: And so they're reenacting their own lives for the recording because, you know, the person wrote the movie based on their own life.

473
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,510
Speaker 1: So they want to, you know, but they didn't capture their own life on film at the time.

474
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:59,070
Speaker 1: So they want to have the people in their life acted out again.

475
00:37:59,739 --> 00:37:59,930
Speaker 1: Right.

476
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,150
Speaker 1: To get on film to make the movie out of.

477
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:06,670
Speaker 0: But even better, you get the impression that some of the scenes like that.

478
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:16,270
Speaker 0: Imagine if you're watching a movie that had acted scenes, reenacted scenes and actual for real footage all mixed together and the movie did not tell you which is which.

479
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,170
Speaker 1: And the movie was actually, you know, live, like happening live.

480
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:30,290
Speaker 1: But just some of the time they cut away from the live camera and they aim the live camera at a screen that was showing some other movie.

481
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:35,150
Speaker 0: So I'm going to spoil one thing that happens on page like live, like Broadway theater live.

482
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,858
Speaker 0: Page 18 is where this goes from.

483
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:39,183
Speaker 0: I am intrigued to.

484
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:41,249
Speaker 0: I'm reading this to the end right now.

485
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,130
Speaker 0: Exactly.

486
00:38:42,893 --> 00:38:44,530
Speaker 0: So it's a minor, minor spoiler.

487
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,610
Speaker 0: But just read this thing.

488
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,014
Speaker 0: So, you know, it starts out.

489
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:52,410
Speaker 0: this kid is asked by his mom and dad to record his mom's life and you get a really interesting story about it.

490
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:53,330
Speaker 0: It's poignant.

491
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,210
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

492
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:54,748
Speaker 0: It's sad.

493
00:38:55,191 --> 00:39:00,530
Speaker 0: There's one moment where it shows the parents asleep and the dialogue is just like dad's asleep, mom's too.

494
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:01,889
Speaker 0: And then it's quiet for a while.

495
00:39:02,491 --> 00:39:09,087
Speaker 0: And then the kid recording just says, I'm keeping watch in case she dies in her sleep and things like that are happening.

496
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,350
Speaker 0: or dad's crying in secret.

497
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,989
Speaker 0: Mom's about to poo and mom's like, you're not filming this.

498
00:39:13,671 --> 00:39:18,190
Speaker 0: But eventually, like the mom dies, of course, like there's a hospital situation.

499
00:39:18,971 --> 00:39:20,856
Speaker 0: And on page 18, like you're reading this.

500
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:25,930
Speaker 0: and then on page 18, he runs out of the hospital screaming and crying.

501
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:27,470
Speaker 1: Well, you missed an important part.

502
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:31,290
Speaker 1: The mom really wanted him to film the mom dying.

503
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:32,370
Speaker 0: True Klingon.

504
00:39:32,691 --> 00:39:36,250
Speaker 1: She was like, she's like, she's like, I really need you to fill the moment I die.

505
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:38,388
Speaker 1: And the kid couldn't do it.

506
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:38,870
Speaker 1: Right.

507
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,984
Speaker 0: He runs away from the hospital.

508
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,830
Speaker 1: Instead of filming his mom dying, he runs away from the hospital.

509
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:48,729
Speaker 1: And at that moment, it's like, wait, who's filming this?

510
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:49,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

511
00:39:49,731 --> 00:39:55,670
Speaker 0: So on page 18, you know, page 17, he is running away from the hospital.

512
00:39:56,771 --> 00:40:01,730
Speaker 0: Well, page 16, he, you see a blurry cell phone footage of his feet as he's running away from the hospital.

513
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:03,050
Speaker 0: Clearly is holding the phone.

514
00:40:03,992 --> 00:40:09,210
Speaker 0: Page 17, you see a shot of him from the front that's perfectly framed and in focus.

515
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:11,850
Speaker 0: And he's running towards you away from the hospital.

516
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,109
Speaker 0: Page 18, the hospital explodes behind him.

517
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:20,509
Speaker 1: And it's like, what did he, did he blow up the hospital?

518
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,810
Speaker 0: And that is the tip of the iceberg of where this thing's going.

519
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:29,510
Speaker 1: It's it, it goes, it goes wild because the ending is amazing.

520
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:36,130
Speaker 0: I will not even tell you what page 20 shows, but it zooms out even further to something.

521
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:43,329
Speaker 0: And this there, this manga covers a lot of topics and a lot of ground from that point on.

522
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:54,790
Speaker 0: And I feel in retrospect, when we got to the very end, I did not even remotely expect what I was going to see at the end of this manga.

523
00:40:55,393 --> 00:40:58,970
Speaker 0: And when I read the last page, I was laughing so hard, I almost choked.

524
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,817
Speaker 0: I was just dumbstruck.

525
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:03,549
Speaker 0: I was so caught up in what was going on.

526
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:07,530
Speaker 0: I was absolutely dumbstruck by the last page of this manga.

527
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:08,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

528
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:16,390
Speaker 1: So, I mean, you know, Chainsaw Man was not Fujimoto's first manga, but it was, you know, I guess their biggest, right?

529
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,130
Speaker 1: It's the one getting an anime adaptation.

530
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,454
Speaker 1: They have some other manga.

531
00:41:19,494 --> 00:41:24,328
Speaker 1: There was one called Fire Punch and one called another, another one shot, one called Look Back.

532
00:41:24,388 --> 00:41:24,910
Speaker 1: that they did.

533
00:41:25,571 --> 00:41:26,533
Speaker 1: And then there was this one.

534
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:33,570
Speaker 1: And I think, you know, this one, I guess we're talking about it because it's available in English for free and you can read it quickly.

535
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:34,273
Speaker 1: So we did.

536
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:34,875
Speaker 1: Right.

537
00:41:35,478 --> 00:41:38,430
Speaker 1: But I'm really curious to read those other two that aren't Chainsaw Man.

538
00:41:39,812 --> 00:41:43,350
Speaker 1: And I think, you know, this person isn't even 30 years old yet, Tatsuki Fujimoto.

539
00:41:44,011 --> 00:41:56,430
Speaker 1: But clearly they're in this, you know, realm of, you know, you know, I don't know if you can consider them a new manga artist since they've been at it for at least some amount of time, but definitely they have become hot.

540
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:57,773
Speaker 1: Right.

541
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:58,675
Speaker 1: They're a big deal.

542
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:04,190
Speaker 1: Everything I've seen that they've made is on another level of, you know, amazingness.

543
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:11,650
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's at like the, you know, S tier of amazingness, but it's better than all the other new mangas I'm seeing around.

544
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:18,406
Speaker 0: Well, like Chainsaw Man intrigued me just from the beginning and just goes to the crazy town.

545
00:42:18,506 --> 00:42:19,790
Speaker 0: I hoped and expected it to go.

546
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:23,363
Speaker 0: But this one, this one shot, you know what it reminds me of a little bit?

547
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:25,070
Speaker 0: Of Urasawa's manga.

548
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:36,650
Speaker 0: It's got some Urasawa type elements to it, but it's not, it's hard to really dig into that without spoiling both Monster and this one off.

549
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:47,030
Speaker 1: But, you know, I think the difference is, is that, you know, this has, uh, I guess Urasawa still tells a direct, straightforward story.

550
00:42:48,011 --> 00:42:51,110
Speaker 1: Urasawa does not blur the fiction in reality.

551
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:56,478
Speaker 0: Urasawa has an absolutely reliable external, created a solid universe.

552
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:59,343
Speaker 1: There are weird things happening in that universe, right?

553
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:03,030
Speaker 1: People, you know, unrealistic things, mysterious things.

554
00:43:03,851 --> 00:43:12,310
Speaker 0: But the camera you're looking at that universe through, the pages on the, the panels on his pages are just an absolute look at the reality of that world.

555
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:17,101
Speaker 1: Yes, and they're always, you know, from this narrator perspective, right?

556
00:43:17,142 --> 00:43:19,970
Speaker 1: Not from any character's perspective or anything like that.

557
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:29,530
Speaker 0: I'm saying more in terms of some of the ways the characters talk and a lot of the way the panel composition and framing is of certain scenes, the way certain scenes linger.

558
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:32,336
Speaker 0: There are definitely some Urasawa elements.

559
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:36,424
Speaker 0: Also, the character designs remind me of some of Urasawa's character designs a little bit.

560
00:43:36,444 --> 00:43:38,930
Speaker 0: A little more angular, a little more pointy.

561
00:43:40,071 --> 00:43:47,890
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, I guess there's not really that much to say because it's just a one-shot, 200-page manga that doesn't take long at all to read.

562
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,228
Speaker 0: And you should absolutely read it.

563
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:59,086
Speaker 1: But yeah, for zero dollars in English digitally, absolutely everyone who can hear my voice right now should be reading this.

564
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:01,049
Speaker 1: There's really no reason not to.

565
00:44:02,192 --> 00:44:02,486
Speaker 1: The end.

566
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:20,790
Speaker 1: And also, whatever Tatsuki Fujimoto makes, right, is a key, you know, when you're buying comics or you're looking for comics to read, remember that name, look for it, and see what they're up to because it's probably, you know, they're on the right track of making the high-quality stuff.

567
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,806
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

568
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:33,840
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

569
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:39,240

00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,167
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

571
00:44:42,307 --> 00:44:46,900
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

574
00:44:54,975 --> 00:44:57,860
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

575
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:25,500
Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this particular episode of Geek Nights are... And several people whose names I will not say at their specific request.

576
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,125
Speaker 0: So yeah, gonna be at PAX just on Thursday.

577
00:45:29,245 --> 00:45:30,588
Speaker 0: Walk the floor, do one panel.

578
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,974
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we'll resume normal shows next week.

579
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:37,420
Speaker 0: Might skip a show on Tuesday because I think we have another hockey game.

580
00:45:37,840 --> 00:46:08,380
Speaker 0: And for now, I simply leave you with... So, you want a realistic, down-to-earth show that's completely off the wall and swarming with magic robots?

581
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:10,911
Speaker 1: That's right!

582
00:46:11,072 --> 00:46:12,780
Speaker 1: You should win things by watching!

583
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:17,285
Speaker 1: You kids don't know what you want!

584
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:19,872
Speaker 0: That's why you're still kids, 'cause you're stupid!

585
00:46:20,734 --> 00:46:23,280
Speaker 1: Just tell me what's wrong with the freaking show!
