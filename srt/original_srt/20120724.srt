00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,084
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday July 24th 2012.

2
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,007
Speaker 1: I'm rim and my name is Inigo month.

3
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:20,373
Speaker 1: So my fun, so you're making a difference to the princess bride.

4
00:00:20,694 --> 00:00:24,453
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like saying the cake is a lie Randomly at a convention.

5
00:00:24,473 --> 00:00:26,657
Speaker 0: Yep It sure is.

6
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:28,691
Speaker 1: And you thought of this just now?

7
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:29,959
Speaker 0: no, I thought of it days ago.

8
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:33,236
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,849
Speaker 1: Anyway tonight we're talking about talking Oka.

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,420
Speaker 0: I don't think you said this is geek night that precocious panda.

11
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:48,464
Speaker 1: So actually we learned about this game for the main bit at nerd NYC, you know the board game night We always go to.

12
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:51,340
Speaker 0: yeah, Ryan the guy who sort of runs the show there.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,705
Speaker 0: He usually shows up at the same sort of set of default games that you go to if no one else brought anything or if you've Played everything else.

14
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:04,700
Speaker 0: I've played all of those games With him, yeah, he brings, you know loco and Siro and settlers and whatever.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,500
Speaker 1: Well, it's like if he was our friend chase, he'd be there with spotted right banana grams, but this time he got a new game.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,130
Speaker 0: I was like, oh my god, he got a new game.

17
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:13,533
Speaker 0: He brought.

18
00:01:13,593 --> 00:01:14,539
Speaker 0: it was called Taka Noko.

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,349
Speaker 0: We're gonna we're like, so what's this game?

20
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,077
Speaker 0: We're advancing we save it for the main bit.

21
00:01:18,138 --> 00:01:18,640
Speaker 0: Jesus Christ.

22
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:21,780
Speaker 1: So, uh, but after that we had to play another game and Emily was there.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,130
Speaker 1: So and we had a some cool internet person.

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,014
Speaker 1: We had a bunch of people.

25
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,360
Speaker 1: we played Carcassonne.

26
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:30,749
Speaker 1: So as I'm teaching everyone Scott and Emily are like don't listen to anything.

27
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,797
Speaker 1: rim says he always wins this game like 90% of the time.

28
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,731
Speaker 1: seriously, don't listen to him.

29
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:40,151
Speaker 1: and Jeremiah who's playing with us is there and he's like 90 whatever percent.

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:40,753
Speaker 1: me pause.

31
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:42,477
Speaker 1: He's like how many games have you played?

32
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:43,460
Speaker 1: He's super dubious.

33
00:01:44,742 --> 00:01:47,233
Speaker 1: He was really like, uh, this is bullshit.

34
00:01:47,253 --> 00:01:48,760
Speaker 1: You're just yeah, I totally won.

35
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:58,860
Speaker 0: Yeah Despite Scott and Emily telling everyone else to watch out for my bullshit Because it only works if everyone knows right they they have to know you or else they won't believe.

36
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:02,252
Speaker 0: Imagine if you go to play a game with two strangers, right?

37
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:04,500
Speaker 0: You're at PAX and two strangers are gaming with them, right?

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of them says watch out for my friend.

39
00:02:07,468 --> 00:02:08,110
Speaker 0: I'm serious.

40
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,615
Speaker 0: He always wins.

41
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:11,300
Speaker 0: We have to team up on him.

42
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:12,478
Speaker 0: I'm not shitting you.

43
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,170
Speaker 0: What do you do against these two strangers?

44
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,074
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about.

45
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:17,720
Speaker 1: ah, but what if it is three?

46
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,422
Speaker 0: How do you know?

47
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,770
Speaker 0: it's not a team grift?

48
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,420
Speaker 0: That would be your first guess wouldn't it?

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,700
Speaker 1: But if it is three strangers and two of them are saying watch out for that, you know, it's not it's a four-player game.

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,110
Speaker 0: How do you know?

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,500
Speaker 0: it's not a team?

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,179
Speaker 1: Actually Scott, I would have lost except that you of all fucking people ended up king making with me.

53
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,320
Speaker 1: You were like rim Apple and I was like Apple and we started playing and the two of us pulled away.

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:48,080
Speaker 0: No, cuz I was trying to Apple you in the city and orange you in the farm But I and I fire fuck up the farm every time cuz I don't know how to do the farm.

55
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:53,980
Speaker 1: You know, well, you know my real strategy is to win because carcass own it was base carcass own like without any expansion.

56
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:54,885
Speaker 0: Oh, it's nothing.

57
00:02:55,206 --> 00:03:05,386
Speaker 1: while I have that game memorized statistically it is Pretty random among skilled players like winning or losing if you're playing well Like if I'd lost that game there was no decision.

58
00:03:05,426 --> 00:03:06,931
Speaker 1: I could have made differently to alter that.

59
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:14,831
Speaker 1: But anyway, so to enhance my likelihood of winning I Do the same thing every time and I'm gonna reveal the secret.

60
00:03:14,851 --> 00:03:23,720
Speaker 1: right now when there are novice players I teach everyone how to play and I give accurate honest very good advice to everyone at the table.

61
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,711
Speaker 1: Yeah for the first two-thirds of the game.

62
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't lie in the last two-thirds.

63
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:44,454
Speaker 1: I just start bitching how I'm losing because I gave everyone else good advice Which is usually true at that point because I give everyone else good advice and simultaneously I'm setting up farms and things that don't score right away.

64
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,327
Speaker 1: So I look like I'm way behind And I'm.

65
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,920
Speaker 1: everyone else knows that I'm giving good advice.

66
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,583
Speaker 1: They listen to me.

67
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:53,540
Speaker 1: then I kind of stop giving advice toward the end and just bitch about how I'm losing it.

68
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,149
Speaker 1: ah, ah, I can't win this game and somehow that always works even though you guys know I do it.

69
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,156
Speaker 1: use the first warning sign with rim.

70
00:04:01,176 --> 00:04:01,678
Speaker 1: if you see.

71
00:04:01,718 --> 00:04:08,080
Speaker 1: if I ever Say well, I can't win that is code for I am definitely winning and you know what the scariest part is.

72
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,376
Speaker 0: Even though you say this you you tell everyone exactly what you're doing.

73
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,782
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter It's like.

74
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:17,137
Speaker 0: this is the thing that our government and most governments of the world have learned.

75
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:18,642
Speaker 0: they used to Right.

76
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:23,120
Speaker 0: the governments around the world used to be evil, but would hide their evilness.

77
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,517
Speaker 0: They'd like oh we can't let anyone know about this corrupt evil wrongdoing scandal nowadays.

78
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,467
Speaker 0: They're just like Scandal.

79
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:39,816
Speaker 0: yes, we did that scandal mm-hmm and what and We're gonna do it again, and you're not gonna do anything about it next time either.

80
00:04:40,258 --> 00:04:41,985
Speaker 0: That's rim Yep, but you know what.

81
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,314
Speaker 0: the same thing that call governments of where it's like.

82
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you can have freedom of speech.

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,153
Speaker 0: We don't need to censor you get.

84
00:04:47,194 --> 00:04:49,869
Speaker 0: tell everyone about It's not gonna matter.

85
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:53,549
Speaker 1: I've been on a roll lately though I want everyone told everyone all the evil things you did.

86
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,400
Speaker 0: guys the government is doing all these bad things.

87
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, we know.

88
00:04:57,108 --> 00:04:57,635
Speaker 1: remember that.

89
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:58,020
Speaker 1: what was it?

90
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,405
Speaker 1: You said it a hundred times.

91
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,389
Speaker 1: was it mall of horror?

92
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,292
Speaker 1: the vote who vote?

93
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,175
Speaker 0: who wins game?

94
00:05:02,216 --> 00:05:03,360
Speaker 0: vote who wins zombie mall.

95
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:07,860
Speaker 1: I remember the one time I played that Scott is yelling across the room at us every turn.

96
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:15,434
Speaker 1: Don't vote for rim in the vote who wins game and guess who won The game is literally vote until someone wins yeah every time.

97
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:21,120
Speaker 0: I was simply I'd be like let us vote Not rim every time guys seriously.

98
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:29,948
Speaker 0: And then once rim is eliminated and has no more zombie survivors then play normally, but no they eliminate you instead stupidly The only game they're smart about.

99
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:36,135
Speaker 0: and you know if we played it again if they listen to this podcast And then immediately played that game They would still be stupid.

100
00:05:36,559 --> 00:05:40,382
Speaker 1: now It's interesting because the one game that doesn't work for any of us is Mafia.

101
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:43,075
Speaker 1: those fuckers murder you me and Scott Johnson without even.

102
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:44,220
Speaker 0: yeah, why is it in Mafia?

103
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:44,761
Speaker 0: It's a vote.

104
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:45,986
Speaker 0: also vote who wins game?

105
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,412
Speaker 0: do they vote against?

106
00:05:47,853 --> 00:05:50,303
Speaker 0: but in the other vote who wins game They vote for.

107
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:56,758
Speaker 1: what I find funny is every time they like Lynch you me or scojo in a game like that We're never the Mafia ever.

108
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,050
Speaker 0: Anyway anyway, let's talk about actual stuff.

109
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,858
Speaker 1: so steam summer sale.

110
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:03,943
Speaker 0: steam sale Let's talk about.

111
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:04,786
Speaker 0: so I bought.

112
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,658
Speaker 0: basically I made two purchases really right.

113
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:08,602
Speaker 0: well three I bought.

114
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:14,452
Speaker 0: I pre-ordered torchlight 2 and they gave me a free copy of torchlight 1. shit I forgot about torchlight 2, but I already had it.

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,720
Speaker 0: so it doesn't matter.

116
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,112
Speaker 0: I can't play it yet, but the game should be out September.

117
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:25,319
Speaker 0: October is basically Diablo 3. yeah, it's a clicking game, but you know without real money without any bullshit.

118
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,968
Speaker 0: in fact I talked to them at PAX and they the things.

119
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,755
Speaker 0: I didn't have to ask them questions.

120
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:32,706
Speaker 0: really when I spoke to them This is last packs prime.

121
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:39,375
Speaker 0: They their pitch was look at all the bullshit We don't have and I was like I will give you $20 for your game.

122
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,340
Speaker 0: That is nothing but clicking.

123
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:54,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I bought fallout, New Vegas because they had the ultimate with all DLCs for a very low price, and I bought Oblivion which is the previous elder scroll before Skyrim because it was also all DLCs very low price.

124
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:55,945
Speaker 0: So I started.

125
00:06:56,066 --> 00:06:58,560
Speaker 0: I bought New Vegas first because that deal was earlier in the week.

126
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 0: I started playing it, and I was expecting it to be more Fallout 3. well Even though it's the same engine as Fallout 3 is not as good as Fallout 3 I thought it was gonna be more of the same which is Game that is fundamentally broken, but has interesting enough stuff in this world that it is worth spending some hours to explore it.

127
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:23,179
Speaker 0: It was actually Much more boring than that.

128
00:07:24,003 --> 00:07:26,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could have told you that I didn't know that.

129
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,478
Speaker 0: I mean you know I figured just be more.

130
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:27,960
Speaker 0: follow three.

131
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:29,455
Speaker 0: But the thing with New Vegas is that?

132
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:32,976
Speaker 0: You know without did you get to Vegas?

133
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:33,459
Speaker 0: no?

134
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:37,882
Speaker 0: not yet anyway is that it's just?

135
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:52,748
Speaker 0: you know that the structure of the quests and the layout of the world is not so great and the things that you find are You know it fall out of three and a lot of things you would find to be sort of this procedural boring stuff like oh This is exact same place as that other place.

136
00:07:52,829 --> 00:07:55,176
Speaker 0: It's just the lockers are in a different orientation.

137
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,380
Speaker 0: this has less of that.

138
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:05,410
Speaker 0: But the things you find aren't really even though they're less procedurally generated They're more boring, and there's not really that sort of.

139
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:14,915
Speaker 0: you know it sort of has that funky fallout style in places But it's mixed with the Wild West style But it it's not as cool and kitschy is like - on.

140
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,564
Speaker 0: the kitchen is also The main kitchy.

141
00:08:17,604 --> 00:08:20,452
Speaker 1: populux is the only reason to play fallout right.

142
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:31,289
Speaker 0: and you know the main plot of Fallout 3 was Significantly you know had that whole you're in the vault and you play that whole beginning part And it sort of had that weird secretive space.

143
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:35,904
Speaker 0: you would go out of the vault and you enter this weird world right in New Vegas, it's.

144
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:40,160
Speaker 0: it's so typical western with no weirdness whatsoever It's.

145
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,629
Speaker 0: you were a guy delivering a message.

146
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:46,334
Speaker 0: some guys stole the message from you Which was a poker chip that had must have had something in it.

147
00:08:46,857 --> 00:08:48,906
Speaker 1: as usual It didn't get far enough to find out.

148
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:58,273
Speaker 0: and then you wake up in a town where a doctor heals you up and ask you a bunch of questions to determine your stats and Then you're welcome the Wild West town.

149
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:01,250
Speaker 0: there's some bandits And it's just like you know.

150
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:10,138
Speaker 0: nothing is just exciting at all And I don't know how much more I might play just to go see what the Vegas looks like and see if you can play all the casino games.

151
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:13,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, not exciting.

152
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:17,739
Speaker 0: The oblivion however right I feel kind of dumb.

153
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,491
Speaker 0: I had thought that these old scrolls games.

154
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:32,224
Speaker 0: You know not having you know played too many of them I was under the impression that they were basically the same as those other D&D type games like Baldur's Gate and such only 3d FPS.

155
00:09:32,244 --> 00:09:39,978
Speaker 0: I Did not know until just now feeling pretty dumb that oblivion is pretty much the fallout 3 engine.

156
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:44,652
Speaker 0: in fact It's more accurate to say fallout 3 is the oblivion engine upgraded.

157
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:50,074
Speaker 1: so the same damn game only fantasy So semi procedural fetch quests.

158
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,665
Speaker 0: yes, however You know all these games.

159
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:57,960
Speaker 0: You know have the same since they're on the same engine and have mostly the same rules.

160
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,829
Speaker 0: They all have the same problems.

161
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,100
Speaker 1: game wise combat is walk backwards attacking.

162
00:10:02,466 --> 00:10:05,349
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much You know stuff like that at least.

163
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,620
Speaker 0: actually in in oblivion a lot of times There's these imps that shoot fireballs at you pretty slowly, so it's the same as doom where you're dodging imp fireballs.

164
00:10:13,146 --> 00:10:21,175
Speaker 0: They're really slow anyway And it doesn't have that sort of pause to shoot guys in the head that fallout 3 has which is actually kind of nice because I hate that.

165
00:10:22,683 --> 00:10:42,399
Speaker 0: But I got to say the oblivion The game that they made on the engine right you know in terms of the non game parts as in you know These story parts and art parts and all the music not so much, but all the other parts lore and all those things is Really great.

166
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:53,860
Speaker 0: So I can see why those people who really don't give a shit about Games as far as we can you know care about them, but you know care about lures and arts and graphics and stories.

167
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:57,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why they're in love with these.

168
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:04,658
Speaker 0: You know old girls because usually when I go to like a fantasy thing all right, and it's not a world.

169
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:14,105
Speaker 0: I already know It's hard for to make me you have to do a really good job to make me give a shit Right it's like you know Prince of nothing.

170
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:16,274
Speaker 0: It's like a new fantasy world.

171
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:17,560
Speaker 0: Why should I care?

172
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,788
Speaker 0: Oh, I care cuz it's really good Locke Lamora.

173
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:25,680
Speaker 0: I kind of care cuz it's pretty good ish right, but forgotten realms.

174
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:26,288
Speaker 0: I really don't.

175
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:33,060
Speaker 0: I really don't care I don't even is is freaking all Elder Scrolls even in like Forgotten Realms or something or just its own world?

176
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:36,266
Speaker 0: No, I don't even know What.

177
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:37,089
Speaker 1: where do you?

178
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,293
Speaker 1: where would you show them?

179
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:39,940
Speaker 0: This is how I don't even know.

180
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,071
Speaker 0: What world is it is it?

181
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,079
Speaker 0: is it its own world?

182
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:47,668
Speaker 1: It's not a Dungeons & Dragons world.

183
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:53,140
Speaker 0: it's not Dungeons & Dragons at all no, but it's really old yeah, so it's just its own place.

184
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:56,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right anyway.

185
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:00,487
Speaker 0: So anyway yeah, but they just you know.

186
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:11,438
Speaker 0: the the job of world making in it is You know like I don't really care about the Elder Scrolls world, but I kind of care A little bit.

187
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:33,138
Speaker 0: I think the things that make me care less are the fact that you like you make your own character And it has that horrible much giving the player too much control over what your character looks like thing Which is really annoying because you can never make something you're really Happy with but you don't have not willing to put in the time and effort to twiddle all of the hundred knobs to make The guy look the way you want him to look.

188
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:43,780
Speaker 1: Oh my god Here's a forum argument of people trying to decide which is a better fantasy setting forgotten realms or the Elder Scrolls universe.

189
00:12:44,382 --> 00:12:49,180
Speaker 1: Okay, except the majority of the posts are people saying what the fuck is forgotten realms.

190
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:57,038
Speaker 0: Okay, interesting very interesting but anyway Yeah, I wish that they would just like.

191
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:01,909
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah Why is everyone so afraid of making a game like this?

192
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,000
Speaker 1: that just doesn't have the bullshit FPS e combat e game part.

193
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,724
Speaker 0: That's exactly.

194
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:09,600
Speaker 1: just make it a. choose your own adventure and explore game.

195
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:17,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the rules and the numbers and the stats and the you know, all right, it's like I'm you know There was this awesome quest.

196
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:22,783
Speaker 0: I went on right where there was a crazy hermit and I talked to the crazy hermit and he ranted And raved.

197
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:27,540
Speaker 0: but then it gave me a quest and it was sort of annoying that it gives you like the text instructions.

198
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:37,440
Speaker 0: But it's sort of impossible if they don't You know the Mega Man Mega Man, but anyway, even though they gave text instructions I'm like, I'm gonna go see if what this hermit has to say is true.

199
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:50,889
Speaker 0: So I go and I look for the nine Alters out in the world that he gave me a map to and I'm visiting the altars Right and at one of the altars I meet another guy who's also visiting the altars right and he talks about how.

200
00:13:50,909 --> 00:14:04,139
Speaker 0: yeah, he's looking for him too and he has a You know, he has a squire who's actually a character and not just a guy who's standing there with you know stock, you know talking and everyone is voice acted and everyone has you know, pretty complex dialogue.

201
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:10,760
Speaker 0: and After I get all these altars I go, you know to this other place and there's these ghosts and I have to fight them.

202
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:13,569
Speaker 0: And then then they're like here's another quest.

203
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:22,322
Speaker 0: you have to go and get the pieces of the Crusaders armor to you know Bring to revive our you know, our basically equivalent of Knights Templar Organization.

204
00:14:22,804 --> 00:14:25,940
Speaker 0: so I go and I get all the Crusaders armor and I meet that same guy.

205
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:32,880
Speaker 0: He's looking for him too, but he died along the way and his squire is there and he's like, hey man, what's up?

206
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:37,755
Speaker 0: he's like the other guy died and I'm like, whoa, this is crazy that they made this work.

207
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:44,536
Speaker 0: and then when I get back and I finally read, you know birthed this organization that squire joins the organization.

208
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:45,740
Speaker 0: He's like, hey, can I join?

209
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,180
Speaker 0: I'm like, yes arise sir Knight and he's all excited.

210
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:52,960
Speaker 0: He's like, yes, and I'm like man, whoever wrote this is really good writing.

211
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,283
Speaker 0: It's like.

212
00:14:53,303 --> 00:14:55,019
Speaker 0: I actually feel like a hero.

213
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:59,960
Speaker 0: I went on an epic quest and it's just like the beginning of the game, right and that part is great.

214
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:06,500
Speaker 0: But I didn't need to play this FPS of hitting with swords and worrying about how encumbered I am.

215
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,310
Speaker 0: Your armor dude, the leveling up is.

216
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,280
Speaker 0: so yeah guys quest for glory.

217
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:16,192
Speaker 1: Use that mechanic in infinity number of years ago.

218
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:17,356
Speaker 1: We can move past it.

219
00:15:17,396 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 0: the leveling up is so dumb.

220
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:20,720
Speaker 0: So you use a skill to increase it, right?

221
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,192
Speaker 0: So you swing your sword and your sword goes up in quest for glory one.

222
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:30,140
Speaker 1: I remember feeling outside Throwing knives at a tree for like an hour one day.

223
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:34,573
Speaker 0: Yeah And the way it works is to get an actual level an actual full level.

224
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:39,560
Speaker 0: you have to ink you have to get ten points In skills, but they can only be your major skills.

225
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,865
Speaker 0: So I'm a mage.

226
00:15:41,306 --> 00:15:44,900
Speaker 0: so my major skills are all the different magical schools and alchemy.

227
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:52,405
Speaker 0: So I really only ever use the destructive magic spells and I never used any conjuration burning wheel or illusion anything But shards.

228
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:52,989
Speaker 1: exactly.

229
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,420
Speaker 0: the illusions are so useless.

230
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,211
Speaker 0: I mean I'm sure someone's gonna tell me they're useful but who gives a shit?

231
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:57,473
Speaker 0: I can.

232
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,948
Speaker 0: I can beat the game with just the fireball Projectile thing that does 15 damage.

233
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:04,020
Speaker 0: So what do I give a shit about casting shield or whatever?

234
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:06,289
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

235
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:11,280
Speaker 0: So I Also the game, you know that it is cool that I can be the armor mage.

236
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,440
Speaker 0: I'm wearing this full heavy armor like full plate with a helmet.

237
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,539
Speaker 0: You can't even see my face and I'm a mage.

238
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:25,077
Speaker 0: So I'm just like casting fireballs and like my hand is holding the most magical enchanted sword And I just put my fist forward while holding the sword and a fireball comes out of it.

239
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:25,640
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

240
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,547
Speaker 0: But it's it's so annoying.

241
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,976
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm only using one school of magic.

242
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,120
Speaker 0: So I never got any levels.

243
00:16:31,682 --> 00:16:35,020
Speaker 0: So the game scales the difficulty based on your actual levels.

244
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:40,100
Speaker 0: So I've leveled up all these other skills really high like heavy armor, which is not a mage skill.

245
00:16:40,584 --> 00:16:43,486
Speaker 0: So bad guys can't really hurt me But they're cuz.

246
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,899
Speaker 0: they're so low level bad guys cuz I'm only level three.

247
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:51,300
Speaker 0: But then I had learned that you could only access certain things when you got certain number of real levels.

248
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,059
Speaker 0: So I went to the mages guild and I cast summon skeleton like 50 times.

249
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,940
Speaker 0: I just basically used a rubber band and a rock to hold the button down on my keyboard.

250
00:16:59,442 --> 00:17:01,411
Speaker 1: Did you actually use a rubber band and a rock?

251
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:02,054
Speaker 0: Yes, I did.

252
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:07,853
Speaker 0: I used a rubber band like a little pebble Oh And to hold down the cast button and I set summon skeleton to be the spell.

253
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:11,888
Speaker 0: and a guy just stood there summoning Skeletons until his mana ran out.

254
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:15,782
Speaker 0: but the mana recharges really fast because I put max Skeletons.

255
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:17,694
Speaker 0: do they just stand there cuz any order.

256
00:17:17,714 --> 00:17:18,380
Speaker 0: there were no bad guys.

257
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,887
Speaker 1: I picture in the far future of this.

258
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:22,219
Speaker 0: every time you summon a skeleton another one disappears.

259
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,060
Speaker 0: I only have one skeleton at a time.

260
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:30,080
Speaker 1: I was gonna say I picture some adventurer comes into a house someday and finds a mage dead and a thousand skeleton.

261
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,851
Speaker 0: Oh, so that so that leveled up my conjuration a whole bunch of times and as soon as you get ten points in any Combination of your major skills you get a real level.

262
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:40,980
Speaker 0: So I got like four or five real levels Holding down this button.

263
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:50,686
Speaker 0: So I didn't get any levels going on this epic quest to reform this ancient order of Knights designers take note Story alone.

264
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:53,240
Speaker 1: if you have a good story, you remember we did that money.

265
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:58,348
Speaker 1: It's not a game, but it could still be where we were like you can And a monetization model.

266
00:17:58,388 --> 00:18:00,074
Speaker 1: you can't make them both in vacuums.

267
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:05,320
Speaker 1: games like this seem to do that But it's with game mechanics and I really want to get else.

268
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaker 0: I really want to get a copy of the engine that they use to make these fallout 3 oblivion the Skyrim games and Make a game such that all you do is walk really fast because the walking is way too slow.

269
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,599
Speaker 0: At least they have fast travel and they give you a horse pretty early on whatever.

270
00:18:23,243 --> 00:18:24,533
Speaker 0: But you don't have.

271
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:27,793
Speaker 0: there's no Fighting and the stat there's no stats.

272
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:34,993
Speaker 0: just remove all the stat parts So they don't even matter and it just be quest items Right and all the different actions you do are just all equal.

273
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,880
Speaker 0: or maybe just start completely maxed out.

274
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:38,085
Speaker 0: But I had nothing.

275
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,480
Speaker 0: none of the stats ever really matter in the game.

276
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,052
Speaker 0: It's just you're.

277
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:44,469
Speaker 0: you know The world and the story and has different places.

278
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,579
Speaker 1: it can because we've we've shown from you know, Mass Effect Dragon Age.

279
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,330
Speaker 1: people Actually do want what amount to really really complex.

280
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:59,510
Speaker 1: choose your own adventures and I see no reason for that to tag Person shooting RPG number thing.

281
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:01,980
Speaker 1: No, some people like the first person, you know, they like that.

282
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,093
Speaker 1: But the thing is these implementations suck balls.

283
00:19:05,415 --> 00:19:07,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's not the greatest I mean, it's basically.

284
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,499
Speaker 0: it's tolerable enough that it's worth it.

285
00:19:10,781 --> 00:19:12,170
Speaker 0: You know, it's like if it was.

286
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,420
Speaker 0: if they didn't have that bullshit in there I would probably do every quest in the game.

287
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,429
Speaker 0: I would explore every nook and cranny right.

288
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:24,900
Speaker 0: but because I know like I'll walk by a Fort and it'll be like you have discovered the fort of the ancient blah blah blah.

289
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:26,851
Speaker 0: And it's like a part of me says who?

290
00:19:27,153 --> 00:19:28,219
Speaker 0: what's in the fort of the agent?

291
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:32,554
Speaker 0: It's probably full of all kinds of goodies and mystic not nuts.

292
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,140
Speaker 0: I want to see what's in there.

293
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:46,040
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll learn about some horrible ghost or tragedy that befell to something and it'll you know Knowing the writers who wrote the other part really well This part might be good too and I can even bring my knights with me in there to do a lot of fight.

294
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:46,988
Speaker 0: It'll be cool, right?

295
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:57,037
Speaker 0: But then I'm like, wait a minute I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna have to sit through a bunch of FPS bullshit Dodging fireballs and whacking guys with swords and saving a lot and loading if I get killed and all that.

296
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:05,868
Speaker 0: and it's just like Yeah, I'm not going in there paying attention only to main quest ignoring side quests completely not worth my time So whatever.

297
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so move on.

298
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,403
Speaker 1: I bought a bunch of games But I can't.

299
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:14,159
Speaker 1: I looked at my list and I realized I do not know which ones I bought now versus before.

300
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:20,100
Speaker 1: you can look At your email from yeah, but the point was I cannot tell from my steam list alone.

301
00:20:20,501 --> 00:20:22,647
Speaker 1: That is how little regard I put into what I bought.

302
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I know I know for a fact.

303
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:27,220
Speaker 1: I acquired VVVVVV for legit.

304
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:32,096
Speaker 1: I probably bought a bundle or two to round out my list of bundle games.

305
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:39,180
Speaker 1: I've never installed But of the games I played a little bit of I played some sim city for well you bought that.

306
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:39,962
Speaker 0: Which was it?

307
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:42,551
Speaker 1: some piddly amount is a few dollars.

308
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,916
Speaker 0: How does it compare to sim city 2000?

309
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:47,504
Speaker 1: So I'm not sure yet.

310
00:20:47,544 --> 00:20:48,888
Speaker 1: I played it for a while.

311
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:52,900
Speaker 0: It has like extra stuff right like garbage collection and 3d ness, right?

312
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:55,286
Speaker 0: More 3d ness.

313
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:56,230
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

314
00:20:56,552 --> 00:21:07,876
Speaker 1: playing it for a little bit It felt slightly dumbed down and it had this sort of weird Alternate game where you can zoom in to an individual person and check out their life.

315
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:09,040
Speaker 0: Oh like the Sims.

316
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:17,154
Speaker 1: yeah, and I don't know if it's actually a good or fun simulation game because I Stopped playing it after like 45 minutes.

317
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:19,292
Speaker 0: You know, it's not hard for us.

318
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,581
Speaker 0: Just play sim city 2000.

319
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:22,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, they kind of automated a lot of stuff like.

320
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,840
Speaker 0: and you know what sim city 2000 if you put it on cheetah mode in our computer.

321
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,867
Speaker 1: So it's the year 99 99.

322
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:29,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

323
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,498
Speaker 0: It's like you do cheetah mode for a second.

324
00:21:31,518 --> 00:21:37,528
Speaker 0: You're like, oops You know, you know how to get around it.

325
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:47,865
Speaker 1: keep the newspaper on that way the newspaper will stop you at the end of the month, yeah But it like here's one did one big difference because you can tell the last sim city I played was I think some city Three.

326
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:48,771
Speaker 0: I didn't play some city.

327
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,079
Speaker 1: I played it a little bit and I didn't like it.

328
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:50,800
Speaker 0: I never played it.

329
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:58,928
Speaker 1: But anyway you if you zone like industrial or residential or whatever the little side streets inside of there are Automatic and just kind of appear and scale.

330
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:10,231
Speaker 1: Oh, so you only have to make the real roads so only to make highways and One really big nice day if you build a school or a fire department It shows the radius of effect on the map as you're placing.

331
00:22:10,834 --> 00:22:12,580
Speaker 0: Oh, so a lot of UI improvements.

332
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of you're like.

333
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,873
Speaker 1: the UI still is.

334
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:24,220
Speaker 1: It reminds me of sieve - in that it's really low res and really really I thought it was 3d and cool.

335
00:22:25,006 --> 00:22:26,236
Speaker 1: No, it's a pretty old game.

336
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:33,333
Speaker 0: actually See what would be cool is someone made a hack for sim city 2000 that added some of those nice tees like when you made a road.

337
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,019
Speaker 0: it would show how far the road reach.

338
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,473
Speaker 1: you know I could never play some city 2000 again.

339
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:38,922
Speaker 0: Why not?

340
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,960
Speaker 0: because some city to fill a screen with our colleagues and that's it the game.

341
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:45,599
Speaker 0: That's because your goal was to max out and sort of win.

342
00:22:46,022 --> 00:22:46,988
Speaker 0: What you have to do is you get.

343
00:22:47,028 --> 00:22:48,940
Speaker 0: your goal has to be to make a beautiful city.

344
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,580
Speaker 1: There wasn't enough granularity of simulation for that to be as I'm saying mods.

345
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:57,070
Speaker 0: Someone can mod it and add all sorts of more stuff minecraft.

346
00:22:57,832 --> 00:22:59,738
Speaker 0: I guess yeah minecraft is that game right?

347
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,822
Speaker 0: make a beautiful city We'll see.

348
00:23:00,842 --> 00:23:06,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, some say for Scott came out in 2003.

349
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:09,853
Speaker 0: What is the remind you how goddamn what is the current sim city then?

350
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:13,020
Speaker 1: fuck if I know is there a newer one Or is that any series?

351
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,625
Speaker 1: This is what you know remember.

352
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,147
Speaker 1: when you know.

353
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:33,642
Speaker 1: remember like five years ago when we would Complain about old people talking about games there was a sim city on the iPhone, but it was basically Updated graphics a new game called sim city is Coming soon as in in 2013.

354
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:37,020
Speaker 0: Sim city there's but it's gonna be 50 bucks when it comes out.

355
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,052
Speaker 0: I'll wait for that in a steam sale for three dollars.

356
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:42,644
Speaker 1: There is Sim City Societies, which is not.

357
00:23:42,685 --> 00:23:47,580
Speaker 0: that sounds like a spin-off and not the real deal, which is not what we would consider Sim City.

358
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,131
Speaker 1: It's about social energies and societal values at a Facebook game.

359
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:55,170
Speaker 1: No, there's that Sim City Facebook game, which if you play that I'm sorry, you're kind of stupid.

360
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:56,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a terrible.

361
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,800
Speaker 0: Well, there's also city Ville and a hundred other Ville's which are the same bullshit.

362
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,441
Speaker 0: There's also a civilization Facebook game Which is also.

363
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:07,639
Speaker 1: the problem with sim city 2000 is that it was a solved game if you went for these stated goals, right?

364
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,580
Speaker 1: Sim City 4 is the same thing except because I haven't played Sim City games in forever.

365
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:15,280
Speaker 1: I don't know the actual optimal solution.

366
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:21,240
Speaker 1: So I think it'll scratch more of the itch of what like civilization for but not civilization 5 was able to do.

367
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:28,859
Speaker 0: I think I would like to see a Sim City where not only is it just like you know commercial zone But it's like you have to build the specific things.

368
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,533
Speaker 1: Oh that but that's not how city planning works.

369
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,984
Speaker 1: that breaks from the metaphor Yeah, but it wouldn't.

370
00:24:34,004 --> 00:24:35,510
Speaker 0: I don't want to play city planning.

371
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,272
Speaker 0: I want to play.

372
00:24:36,353 --> 00:24:38,340
Speaker 0: city planning is the only thing I want to play.

373
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,909
Speaker 0: I want to play design the entire city.

374
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,940
Speaker 0: Yes, even as a we need a dry cleaner here.

375
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:45,244
Speaker 0: I we need a garbage.

376
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,333
Speaker 1: you're saying that you'd rather play bullshit fantasy.

377
00:24:48,373 --> 00:24:50,900
Speaker 1: Here's my Taco Bell instead of I'm Robert Moses.

378
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,751
Speaker 0: Well, because the thing well, I mean the two different games, right?

379
00:24:53,812 --> 00:24:55,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, Robert Moses is the only game.

380
00:24:56,743 --> 00:24:58,229
Speaker 0: It'd be more like Legos.

381
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,484
Speaker 0: only one building is one Lego so Minecraft Sort of.

382
00:25:02,504 --> 00:25:03,894
Speaker 0: but it's like it's already a building.

383
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:08,720
Speaker 0: So it's more about Arranging all these, you know thousands of different building pieces.

384
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,074
Speaker 1: But at that level the game basically becomes a macro version of sim tower.

385
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,100
Speaker 0: I like some just a shit game.

386
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,984
Speaker 0: I like the tower.

387
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,691
Speaker 1: I think we see where the divide is.

388
00:25:17,731 --> 00:25:18,896
Speaker 0: You don't like some tower.

389
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:19,760
Speaker 1: I hated some time.

390
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,228
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's the tower.

391
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:23,400
Speaker 0: It was Japanese Sim tower.

392
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:28,220
Speaker 0: It was a Japanese game called the tower and it was brought over and renamed and branded with the Sim tower.

393
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,160
Speaker 0: It's like when they put Carcassonne on games that are not Carcassonne.

394
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:34,752
Speaker 1: So I also bought Dragon Age, but we'll talk about that.

395
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:35,555
Speaker 0: I bought that too.

396
00:25:35,776 --> 00:25:36,559
Speaker 0: It won't run first.

397
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:43,028
Speaker 0: This is the first time that I can say Oh Well, then Scott is the first Does not work.

398
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:44,514
Speaker 0: My computer has always worked.

399
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:45,880
Speaker 0: This is the first time it has ever not worked.

400
00:25:46,021 --> 00:25:47,909
Speaker 1: What kind of process if you have core to do?

401
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:49,194
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

402
00:25:49,234 --> 00:25:50,560
Speaker 0: No, that's not the reason it won't run.

403
00:25:50,941 --> 00:25:52,948
Speaker 1: Ram do you have like four gigs or something?

404
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,111
Speaker 1: What kind of video card?

405
00:25:54,151 --> 00:25:55,074
Speaker 0: It's a GTX 460.

406
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:55,395
Speaker 0: Wow the.

407
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,768
Speaker 0: It's not because it's not powerful enough.

408
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,600
Speaker 0: My computer is way more powerful enough to play this game.

409
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,732
Speaker 0: It's just like there's some glitch in the game.

410
00:26:04,753 --> 00:26:06,000
Speaker 0: That's all over the steam forums.

411
00:26:06,121 --> 00:26:07,820
Speaker 0: It's like yeah when I press play nothing happens.

412
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,623
Speaker 0: It just disappears.

413
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:10,047
Speaker 0: and I have this problem.

414
00:26:10,108 --> 00:26:15,148
Speaker 0: and it's the first time that I ever have the problem as opposed to everyone else having The problem in my shadow around.

415
00:26:15,188 --> 00:26:15,852
Speaker 1: just fine for me.

416
00:26:15,872 --> 00:26:17,160
Speaker 1: So I don't know what you did wrong.

417
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,989
Speaker 0: It's finally fuck something.

418
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,926
Speaker 1: this is the first time ever clearly Ruined your computer sucks you.

419
00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:28,700
Speaker 0: clearly there is something I'm doing wrong because it does work for a lot of other people But not me and not some other people on the scene.

420
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:38,168
Speaker 1: but anyway, whenever Scott man's up and fixes his computer then we'll talk about we're gonna play Dragon Age and I also bought amnesia the dark descent and you know what?

421
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:47,133
Speaker 1: It's pretty fun actually, but it does the To a degree that I almost wanted to stop playing.

422
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:47,555
Speaker 1: Hmm.

423
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:48,478
Speaker 0: Can you turn it off?

424
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,500
Speaker 1: No Like you see a cool device with all these funnels and you look at it you're like, huh?

425
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,026
Speaker 1: I wonder if that does something.

426
00:26:56,267 --> 00:27:05,300
Speaker 1: but if you look at it a few seconds later text appears That's like you don't have the four reagents to use this like, oh, I guess I gotta go find four reagents.

427
00:27:05,622 --> 00:27:07,219
Speaker 0: Oh my god, this gave me a great idea.

428
00:27:07,782 --> 00:27:08,666
Speaker 0: We should take the game.

429
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:09,027
Speaker 0: that is the.

430
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:12,020
Speaker 0: what game is the opposite of Mega Man Mega Man Ultima?

431
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:15,734
Speaker 1: No, are you kidding Ultima Quest of the Avatar?

432
00:27:15,754 --> 00:27:19,245
Speaker 0: Yes, it is literal opposite One of the opposites.

433
00:27:19,265 --> 00:27:22,497
Speaker 1: but the game I don't know Ultima Exodus is even more obtuse.

434
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:23,300
Speaker 0: that is true.

435
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,467
Speaker 0: But the game I was thinking of was missed.

436
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:29,800
Speaker 0: We should make a missed remix that has Mega Man Mega Man Mega Man.

437
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,924
Speaker 1: That would be hilarious.

438
00:27:30,964 --> 00:27:31,907
Speaker 0: It would be hilarious, right?

439
00:27:31,927 --> 00:27:36,963
Speaker 0: You go up to like, you know the sundial and it's like you do not have the Thingy to.

440
00:27:37,104 --> 00:27:39,794
Speaker 0: you know, you need to set this to three o'clock at the whatever.

441
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:41,380
Speaker 1: what did you ever beat missed?

442
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,753
Speaker 1: No, how many hours did you spend playing it?

443
00:27:43,955 --> 00:27:44,680
Speaker 0: I didn't even own it.

444
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,479
Speaker 0: I played at a friend's house for like an hour.

445
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,662
Speaker 1: I did.

446
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:58,688
Speaker 0: All I did was walk around to all the places you could walk around to and click on all the things I solved randomly randomly to see what would happen and I never bothered to actually try to figure it out.

447
00:27:58,788 --> 00:28:04,719
Speaker 0: my friend who owned the game had figured out quite a bit and was Actually using the journal in the back of the book to write down.

448
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:13,870
Speaker 0: I think he may have beaten it legitimately or and or Got a fact, I don't know.

449
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:14,878
Speaker 0: But yeah.

450
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:26,700
Speaker 1: But anyway enough talking about games that we don't know anything about because you know, we haven't paid attention to Sim City in ten years.

451
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:33,799
Speaker 1: It's time for things of the day and my thing of the day is something very simple is not much to it.

452
00:28:34,141 --> 00:28:34,804
Speaker 1: You should watch it.

453
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:37,919
Speaker 1: not Space Marines, but space marine.

454
00:28:38,961 --> 00:28:39,302
Speaker 0: Is that it?

455
00:28:39,503 --> 00:28:39,864
Speaker 0: That's it.

456
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:40,385
Speaker 0: Okay.

457
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:41,228
Speaker 1: Space Marine.

458
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:43,395
Speaker 1: IR Space Marine.

459
00:28:43,475 --> 00:28:46,408
Speaker 0: So there's this blog called Splitsider.com.

460
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:55,671
Speaker 0: I thought for a second you were gonna say Space Marine No, and Penny Arcade Report linked to them because they did this story Keeping score with Nick arcade.

461
00:28:55,691 --> 00:29:01,267
Speaker 0: It is an in-depth Exploration of all that went into Nick arcade.

462
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:04,094
Speaker 0: It's really long and also fascinating.

463
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:11,364
Speaker 0: if you know what Nick arcade is Scott you probably do listening guys Omegathon finale.

464
00:29:12,047 --> 00:29:12,871
Speaker 0: I've said that before.

465
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,840
Speaker 1: I know if it were actually a Nick arcade.

466
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,460
Speaker 1: I know that would be really anticlimactic actually watching it, but I think that would be the point.

467
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,048
Speaker 0: But yeah You got to read this article.

468
00:29:23,088 --> 00:29:24,113
Speaker 0: if you know what Nick arcade is.

469
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:30,240
Speaker 0: and if you don't know what Nick arcade is Go find on the internet somewhere an episode of Nick arcade and then read this article.

470
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:32,153
Speaker 0: You only really need to watch one or two episodes.

471
00:29:32,213 --> 00:29:33,220
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Nick arcade.

472
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,660
Speaker 1: Those kids were almost as dumb and the kids of as the kids on legend of the hidden temple.

473
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,627
Speaker 0: In the article is actually a video.

474
00:29:40,808 --> 00:29:42,312
Speaker 0: they embedded a YouTube video.

475
00:29:42,353 --> 00:29:45,765
Speaker 0: That is dumbest Nick arcade player I have seen.

476
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:48,777
Speaker 1: is that the girl who just doesn't go and get the thing and win exactly.

477
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:51,366
Speaker 1: Yep He's even like just go get the thing.

478
00:29:51,688 --> 00:29:53,775
Speaker 0: You've got you're starting to run out of time.

479
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,139
Speaker 1: Just go get it.

480
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,087
Speaker 1: It's right there just up out of time.

481
00:29:58,248 --> 00:30:00,033
Speaker 1: I guess you get poor kid.

482
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,620
Speaker 1: But anyway, those are things of the day.

483
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:08,220
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, we're going to be at pecs prime and pecs dev.

484
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,897

Speaker 1: Hey, a lot of people came to the triple threat.

487
00:30:18,981 --> 00:30:20,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it wasn't full.

488
00:30:20,348 --> 00:30:21,233
Speaker 1: It was a big room.

489
00:30:21,253 --> 00:30:22,540
Speaker 1: It was mostly full.

490
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,606
Speaker 1: There weren't that many seats empty in the back.

491
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,474
Speaker 1: But anyway, Friday 3 30 p.m.

Speaker 1: We are doing when the game plays the player and we are doing on the ethics of mind control three 20-minute lectures.

495
00:30:41,037 --> 00:30:48,614

00:30:49,095 --> 00:30:51,303
Speaker 1: It's myself Scott Lou Crane.

497
00:30:51,484 --> 00:30:55,396
Speaker 1: you might know him from burning wheel and mouse garden such Jared Sorenson.

498
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,680
Speaker 1: You might know him from lacuna.

499
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:58,133
Speaker 1: I figured I'd name the game.

500
00:30:58,174 --> 00:30:58,820
Speaker 1: No one knows.

501
00:30:59,382 --> 00:31:00,505
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually castle.

502
00:31:00,605 --> 00:31:02,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, the action castle guy.

503
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,675
Speaker 1: I'm making quotes now.

504
00:31:03,735 --> 00:31:05,059
Speaker 1: I'm making torches.

505
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:12,179
Speaker 1: Yeah Avery Alex a product manager for popcap games and Alex Avery, uh, so on LinkedIn, it's Alex.

506
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:15,086
Speaker 1: Avery Everything that he's ever written.

507
00:31:15,126 --> 00:31:17,535
Speaker 1: He signs that Avery Alex with a comma.

508
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:23,400
Speaker 1: No, just Avery Alex All righty, so I guess that's and that's when I asked for his headshot to put on the pecs dev side.

509
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:32,700
Speaker 1: he specifically sent it as Avery Alex, so I put that up and He was you might recall Possibly to attend magfest last year as part of the gaming intellectuals.

510
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:36,020
Speaker 1: But he had to not attend due to some unrelated things.

511
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:41,560
Speaker 1: So we're gonna get to debate him on the things we didn't get to debate him on at magfest at pecs dev.

512
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,045
Speaker 0: Well, it's not the same topic.

513
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,716
Speaker 1: No, but everything we ever talked about gets to this topic in the end.

514
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:49,939
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly I think it's gonna be a pretty good discussion.

515
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:54,560
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't matter what the actual, you know title of the the panel is.

516
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:01,507
Speaker 0: It's like what will be discussed game theory solipsism, you know Psychology, yeah all the same things.

517
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:16,340
Speaker 1: perhaps a Pareto frontier or three Some Colonel Blotto, but that is the Monte Carlo extent of the meta moment because There's no other conventions other than packs.

518
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:20,834
Speaker 0: The book club book extra doing a book club book this Thursday guarantee.

519
00:32:20,895 --> 00:32:21,918
Speaker 0: This isn't like before.

520
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,508
Speaker 0: we said Guaranteed.

521
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:24,859
Speaker 0: this is for real guaranteed.

522
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:25,945
Speaker 0: QT 1984 Thursday.

523
00:32:28,562 --> 00:32:29,546
Speaker 0: The next book club book.

524
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:33,200
Speaker 0: I just started reading is the man who was Thursday.

525
00:32:33,361 --> 00:32:37,200
Speaker 1: You may remember it as being referenced more than once in deus ex.

526
00:32:37,882 --> 00:32:39,709
Speaker 1: Okay, that was how I found.

527
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,360
Speaker 0: I bought it actually bought the penguin books edition.

528
00:32:42,641 --> 00:32:45,033
Speaker 1: I bought a dollar 95 Kindle edition.

529
00:32:45,134 --> 00:32:46,320
Speaker 0: the reason I bought this edition?

530
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,339
Speaker 0: I think it's actually public domain possibly right?

531
00:32:48,964 --> 00:32:54,399
Speaker 0: But the reason I bought the penguin edition is Because a penguin classic always does a bunch of extra shit in it.

532
00:32:55,042 --> 00:33:00,219
Speaker 1: You also might have thought back to when I bought the little prince and got that bootleg janky ass shit also.

533
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:06,220
Speaker 0: But the other reason is that the cover is so awesome on the penguin books edition.

534
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,820
Speaker 0: I wanted to know some small fraction of the money will go to whoever made that cover and they deserve it.

535
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:13,568
Speaker 0: Oh, and also it smells really good.

536
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:15,759
Speaker 0: They use really good paper on those.

537
00:33:16,523 --> 00:33:19,700
Speaker 0: I think I was reading a lot of Kindle books lately and it's like you don't get any smell.

538
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:21,367
Speaker 1: You know, we need to invent a device.

539
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:24,340
Speaker 0: you stick on your candle and it spits up book smell.

540
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,668
Speaker 0: It has to smell and it comes with different book smells.

541
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:33,682
Speaker 0: It has used book new book and magic card magic card Nintendo cartridge.

542
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:40,080
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, dude, we should make a video game and sell it and inject in the box Nintendo card.

543
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,020
Speaker 1: No, we should make a perfume that smells like Nintendo cartridge and sell that at conventions and make all the money.

544
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,267
Speaker 0: How do we we gotta have?

545
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:52,004
Speaker 0: I know this perfume companies that can make stuff smell like anything just like they can make anything Taste like anything.

546
00:33:52,507 --> 00:33:54,356
Speaker 0: How do we hire those people and how much do they cost?

547
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:54,959
Speaker 1: I don't know.

548
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:57,471
Speaker 1: We should add that to the hopper perhaps.

549
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put it in right now.

550
00:33:59,942 --> 00:34:03,092
Speaker 1: Also magfest, you know forums in January.

551
00:34:03,112 --> 00:34:05,240
Speaker 1: We got a forum or we got videos.

552
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:06,343
Speaker 1: You got twins.

553
00:34:06,805 --> 00:34:08,109
Speaker 0: check out our things on the internet.

554
00:34:08,188 --> 00:34:11,478
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people possibly just subscribe on iTunes and listen to us.

555
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:16,120
Speaker 0: If you're not listening now that I'm not talking to you obviously because it's not possible.

556
00:34:16,606 --> 00:34:26,768
Speaker 0: But if you are listening to us You should go to our things on the internet that we have like our website and our whatnots because that is how it rolls Like our newsletter, which is pretty cool

557
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,188
Speaker 1: or a rockin forum, which right now there are 7004 comments in the my little pony thread.

558
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,877
Speaker 0: That's really gonna make people want to join.

559
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:41,978
Speaker 1: there are 5671 in the Republicans thread and that thread is currently the fastest rising.

560
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:44,860
Speaker 1: now We'll never talk about the forum like that again on the show.

561
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:54,213
Speaker 1: But if you subscribe to the geek nights newsletter that Scott has been putting together We do talk about the forum and all that meta crap that you people seem to love that.

562
00:34:54,234 --> 00:34:55,357
Speaker 1: We always avoid on the show.

563
00:34:55,377 --> 00:35:00,614
Speaker 0: Oh another thing about the newsletter is that you know a lot of other podcasts.

564
00:35:00,634 --> 00:35:08,964
Speaker 0: they do stuff for like you email in and they'll Emails on the podcast and because we weren't ever really good about responding to them or making that a Permanent segment.

565
00:35:09,406 --> 00:35:12,358
Speaker 0: We never really got a lot of emails asking us things or such.

566
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:15,091
Speaker 0: Right because people only really want to do it.

567
00:35:15,473 --> 00:35:20,220
Speaker 0: as somebody who writes into things You know that you only do it because you want to hear your thing on the show.

568
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,392
Speaker 1: Well, we did get eight paragraphs and a YouTube video on the.

569
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:24,837
Speaker 1: oh, yeah from someone.

570
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:29,080
Speaker 0: we did but anyway So but in the newsletter.

571
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:34,425
Speaker 0: We are going to answer one thing in the newsletter from now on so You can send it.

572
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:40,293
Speaker 0: if you subscribe to the newsletter then you can send in questions and whatnot And then we'll answer them in the newsletter starting with the next one.

573
00:35:40,313 --> 00:35:41,016
Speaker 0: There you go.

574
00:35:41,277 --> 00:35:41,599
Speaker 1: All right.

575
00:35:42,582 --> 00:35:52,252
Speaker 1: So we were at Nern NYC and our good friend as we started to tell whipped out this game And it had a really cute panda on the cover a precocious panda.

576
00:35:52,653 --> 00:36:08,590
Speaker 1: It is called Taki Noko and I Or straight off the bat I'm gonna say that this is an equivalent game in terms of the way you can use it as a person who owns games and needs to present games for other people, you know to play as Zula Redo.

577
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:19,880
Speaker 1: Well, it's not just because it has animal no, but yes similar level of complexity Similar level of how difficult it is to teach how quick it is to play how easy it is to socialize while playing.

578
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,640
Speaker 0: Also, you know this while the theme is animals and that but that's not has anything to do with their similarity.

579
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:32,761
Speaker 0: But what is similar in the theme is the theme is accessible and friendly right which does matter if you got a new player Right.

580
00:36:32,781 --> 00:36:32,942
Speaker 1: Yes.

581
00:36:33,002 --> 00:36:35,634
Speaker 0: I mean looking bust out something like, you know, st.

582
00:36:35,674 --> 00:36:36,317
Speaker 0: Petersburg.

583
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:39,270
Speaker 0: It's like, okay It's got this theme with old European dudes all over it.

584
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,640
Speaker 0: That's not enticing to someone who's never played.

585
00:36:41,726 --> 00:36:43,969
Speaker 1: Yeah I was gonna say go to go to some of our friends to be like.

586
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:49,399
Speaker 1: you want to play a game that simulates the Plantation crop trade in Puerto Rico, right?

587
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,923
Speaker 1: or Panda game.

588
00:36:51,103 --> 00:36:53,692
Speaker 0: you take the exact same game and you put zombies on it.

589
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,220
Speaker 0: suddenly people want to play because they're shallow and don't wow.

590
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,424
Speaker 1: You could just reskin.

591
00:36:57,464 --> 00:36:58,888
Speaker 1: Takanoko is a zombie game.

592
00:36:59,129 --> 00:36:59,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

593
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,263
Speaker 0: pretty trivially you could reskin any game as any game trivially Some what game?

594
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:07,232
Speaker 0: what game can't I reskin can't reskin?

595
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:15,619
Speaker 1: All right, try to reskin Puerto Rico, all right as Tic-tac-toe.

596
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,500
Speaker 0: okay, so There's not enough things in tic-tac-toe.

597
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,103
Speaker 0: Tic-tac-toe is not really.

598
00:37:23,143 --> 00:37:25,993
Speaker 0: if I chose the stupid example, that's not it.

599
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:29,346
Speaker 0: That's that's tic-tac-toe isn't really a theme It's more of a game right?

600
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:30,574
Speaker 0: You need to pick a theme.

601
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,526
Speaker 0: it like tic-tac-toe Theme it like tic-tac-toe.

602
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:45,187
Speaker 0: Okay, so there would just be I'd need more than X's and O's though I'd have to like, you know make like X's with an O around them and you know Like Puerto Rico.

603
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:52,313
Speaker 1: the theme of the game is Pretty deeply tied to the metaphor of the mechanics like the.

604
00:37:52,955 --> 00:37:54,760
Speaker 1: it is a metaphor for the mechanics in a sense.

605
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,759
Speaker 0: Well, and yeah in some games that's more or less tied right and when it is really closely tied It's pretty awesome.

606
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,543
Speaker 0: Right when they're pulling like when a Dominion card the thing it does make sense considering what it is That's always on.

607
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:12,060
Speaker 1: but when it doesn't make sense, it literally just confuses players and causes you to cock up rules.

608
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:19,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, when it's like militia make the other guy discard two cards, it's like oh I get it The militia attacks the other guy's hand.

609
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:20,896
Speaker 0: it makes sense, right?

610
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:25,151
Speaker 0: But when it's like Chapel trash, you know zero to four cards.

611
00:38:25,332 --> 00:38:27,680
Speaker 0: It's like what is chapel have to do?

612
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,039
Speaker 1: I'm confessing my sins and getting rid of them lightning my load, I guess but that's stretching it.

613
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:36,005
Speaker 0: you see It's more of a stretch.

614
00:38:36,046 --> 00:38:38,780
Speaker 1: why would the militia attack my hand instead of my town?

615
00:38:39,541 --> 00:38:42,394
Speaker 0: You don't have a town but you see how it's more of a stretch.

616
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:42,896
Speaker 1: yeah, I do.

617
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:43,660
Speaker 1: I have all these problems.

618
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,050
Speaker 0: Yes, he's the perfect one.

619
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,420
Speaker 0: That's not a step in a state.

620
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,343
Speaker 1: Why didn't they attack that?

621
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:50,051
Speaker 0: the moat, you know defends against attacks.

622
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:51,415
Speaker 0: perfect metaphor, right?

623
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:51,976
Speaker 0: It's a moat.

624
00:38:52,036 --> 00:38:53,240
Speaker 0: It's a defensive structure.

625
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,530
Speaker 0: It defends against anything cuz it's a moat perfect.

626
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,900
Speaker 1: But how about how does it defend against the witches they fly?

627
00:38:59,003 --> 00:38:59,549
Speaker 0: It just does.

628
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,486
Speaker 0: they don't like getting wet But they fly.

629
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:03,872
Speaker 0: they don't like getting wet.

630
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:05,439
Speaker 0: But if you have a moat you can splash them.

631
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,591
Speaker 1: So it should be moat and splasher.

632
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,440
Speaker 0: no, you're the splasher.

633
00:39:11,462 --> 00:39:13,068
Speaker 1: But then how am I gonna manage my estate?

634
00:39:13,128 --> 00:39:15,036
Speaker 1: I have a shit ton inside the castle.

635
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:16,080
Speaker 0: It's protected by the moat.

636
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,311
Speaker 1: Do you know how many estates I have?

637
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:17,432
Speaker 1: three?

638
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,329
Speaker 1: So Takei Noko is a pretty simple game.

639
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:25,480
Speaker 1: The story of the game is actually pretty cute, too.

640
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,660
Speaker 1: You've got this precocious panda Takei Noko and you might think wait a minute.

641
00:39:31,101 --> 00:39:33,789
Speaker 1: These guys confuse China and Japan.

642
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,720
Speaker 1: cuz pandas are from China and Takei Noko is the Japanese name.

643
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:43,989
Speaker 1: That is what everyone who came up to the table to see what we were playing said when we told them what the game was Called.

644
00:39:44,154 --> 00:39:52,999
Speaker 1: yep but no the story is the Emperor of China in a show of good faith gives the Emperor of Japan as a gift a precocious panda.

645
00:39:53,603 --> 00:39:54,748
Speaker 0: But it was a trap gift.

646
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:01,695
Speaker 1: the Emperor of Japan doesn't know what to do So he gives it to the poor gardener and the gardener doesn't know what to do.

647
00:40:02,016 --> 00:40:02,537
Speaker 1: and the guard.

648
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:06,604
Speaker 1: there's a little miniature of a panda and There's a miniature of the gardener.

649
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:07,890
Speaker 1: The gardener has this look on her face.

650
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,059
Speaker 1: Like what the fuck am I gonna do with this panda?

651
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,368
Speaker 0: I Don't know what the fuck I would do with a panda.

652
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,278
Speaker 1: play with it and feed it bamboo.

653
00:40:15,318 --> 00:40:18,200
Speaker 0: apparently Where would I get enough bamboo for the panda?

654
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:20,838
Speaker 1: Apparently grows pretty easily.

655
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:25,160
Speaker 0: Where am I gonna grow it in your luscious Japanese garden?

656
00:40:25,683 --> 00:40:28,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know how much frickin bamboo you need to feed anyway.

657
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:33,520
Speaker 1: The metaphor of this game actually does not link too closely to the reality of the game mechanics.

658
00:40:33,962 --> 00:40:53,846
Speaker 1: The game is a pretty abstract game of sort of pattern matching territory control with card objectives kind of like Take it to ride But you don't really control territories so much as try to construct a territory that will match While other people are trying to match on similar things.

659
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:58,940
Speaker 1: you can have momentary control by putting things on territories that augment them.

660
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,871
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's a shared space right?

661
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:02,735
Speaker 0: So in ticket to ride.

662
00:41:02,755 --> 00:41:04,040
Speaker 0: It's like these are your trains.

663
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:09,097
Speaker 0: These are someone else's trains and you're trying to get your trains to meet your goals.

664
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:14,680
Speaker 0: in this game There's a shared space and everyone can modify that space in different ways.

665
00:41:15,202 --> 00:41:19,620
Speaker 0: And you're trying to get these shared space to match your goals and everyone has goals.

666
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,180
Speaker 0: So you might inadvertently help it match someone else's goal.

667
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:23,010
Speaker 0: You might.

668
00:41:23,294 --> 00:41:41,560
Speaker 0: you know someone else might do something that makes it not match your goal anymore and make it more difficult for you to make the space match your Goal, so you modify the shared space and you get cards and you need the space to Go in line with what your cards say and then you can play the cards to get points.

669
00:41:41,961 --> 00:41:42,643
Speaker 1: So I should back up.

670
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:47,800
Speaker 1: you can't really control the territory so much as you can control access to the territory at a given time.

671
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:51,048
Speaker 1: There's actually for such a simple game to learn.

672
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:54,740
Speaker 1: there's a surprising number of mechanics when I think about trying to mention them all here.

673
00:41:55,341 --> 00:41:56,123
Speaker 1: Basically, the pen.

674
00:41:56,143 --> 00:42:00,013
Speaker 1: there's three ways to get victory points and you get them from these cards.

675
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:05,751
Speaker 1: one deck of cards has a series of configurations of colored tiles that can.

676
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,040
Speaker 1: that can basically constitute the board.

677
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:10,334
Speaker 1: There's pink ones and yellow ones and green ones.

678
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:11,320
Speaker 1: I think it's only three colors.

679
00:42:12,325 --> 00:42:13,015
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so, too.

680
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:23,089
Speaker 1: so if If there's like two pinks in a row or three in a row or three in a circle and That's on the board at any time on your turn.

681
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:24,253
Speaker 1: You can reveal that.

682
00:42:24,313 --> 00:42:24,594
Speaker 1: Yes.

683
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:26,260
Speaker 1: I have that pattern.

684
00:42:26,401 --> 00:42:29,100
Speaker 1: I get that many victory points, however many are on the card, right?

685
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,540
Speaker 0: But it's really easy to set these up because just the tiles isn't to be on the board.

686
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:38,700
Speaker 0: So you just choose the action for place tiles on the board and you really only need like a few tiles.

687
00:42:39,162 --> 00:42:44,560
Speaker 0: So you can if you choose that action enough, it's easy to score on these cards very, you know quickly.

688
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:47,369
Speaker 0: But these cards aren't worth very many points.

689
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:50,120
Speaker 0: They're worth like two three four points based on their difficulty.

690
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:56,840
Speaker 0: But if you get enough of them quickly enough You could end the game because playing a number of cards is the game ending condition.

691
00:42:57,101 --> 00:43:02,028
Speaker 0: So if you can get seven of these before other people have a chance to score big point cards You can win.

692
00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:02,693
Speaker 0: so it is.

693
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:03,500
Speaker 0: it is a good strategy.

694
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,211
Speaker 1: So here so he the way to win the game is there.

695
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:14,562
Speaker 1: when a player has revealed Seven matching victory point cards that they have actually done they reveal them They've got them out.

696
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:16,107
Speaker 1: The game will end.

697
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:19,860
Speaker 1: every other player gets one final turn.

698
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:29,600
Speaker 1: You can only reveal cards on your turn But if you have more than seven revealed That's okay.

699
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:33,729
Speaker 1: So say Scott Reveals the seventh one and immediately ends the game.

700
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:47,260
Speaker 1: the game is I get a two-point bonus for being the guy who to first reveal And then we all get to take our turns say I already had six revealed and I have five more cards in My hand which is the hand limit that actually have matched.

701
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,420
Speaker 1: But I had not revealed yet because I didn't want to end the game on my turn.

702
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,831
Speaker 1: I can reveal all of them.

703
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:52,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have a hamlin.

704
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,164
Speaker 1: I now have 11.

705
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,749
Speaker 0: the hand limit is five.

706
00:43:55,870 --> 00:44:03,860
Speaker 0: so you can have five cards in your hand have six on the table And then if you can somehow manage you get all five of those to do be scored at once.

707
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:05,238
Speaker 0: You just play them all at once.

708
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:10,320
Speaker 1: So my I won this game like handily but in the way I did it was pretty simple.

709
00:44:10,701 --> 00:44:15,640
Speaker 1: I looked at the board and figured out how to get as many of these cards as possible.

710
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:17,340
Speaker 1: I didn't care how many points they were worth.

711
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:22,380
Speaker 1: I just wanted to match match match and I did that and then I held them all in my hand.

712
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,068
Speaker 1: I only revealed like one or two at a time.

713
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:30,780
Speaker 1: So I was on par with everyone else, but then one turn Every card in my hand was also matched and I could just end the game.

714
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,718
Speaker 1: So I just dropped all my cards and no one was even close to me.

715
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:38,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I tried to get more of those cards, but there's also this die factor, right?

716
00:44:39,462 --> 00:44:48,609
Speaker 0: So at the beginning of your turn you roll a die sort of like settlers And that die determines the weather and the weather pretty strongly influences your turn.

717
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:50,280
Speaker 0: if you roll they think the rain.

718
00:44:51,706 --> 00:44:53,734
Speaker 0: If you're all the wind you can do the same action.

719
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:55,060
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit.

720
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,328
Speaker 1: So basically on your turn is simple.

721
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:03,107
Speaker 1: you take you roll the die and get a bonus action and then you take any two actions.

722
00:45:03,127 --> 00:45:16,189
Speaker 1: you have a list of actions like Plant place some tiles on the board or draw a card any one you like or move the panda or move the farmer and then the die determines what your third special action is and they range from.

723
00:45:16,752 --> 00:45:18,579
Speaker 1: Your two actions can be the same action.

724
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:27,390
Speaker 1: or get a third action or those are Right or get one of these modifiers to tiles that I don't care about exactly.

725
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:35,004
Speaker 0: if you roll the one that gives you three actions and the one that lets you double up on actions or the rent the one That lets you choose and then you can choose or the rain.

726
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:35,970
Speaker 1: The rain was really good.

727
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:44,610
Speaker 0: The rain is okay, but a lot of these other ones kind of suck depending, you know I'm sure somebody says oh no if you roll though, here's what you do, right?

728
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:48,810
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like I'm already going in a particular direction.

729
00:45:49,092 --> 00:45:50,847
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know what my future rolls are gonna be.

730
00:45:51,471 --> 00:45:58,136
Speaker 0: So if one person rolls, let's say theoretically the get three actions thing They're probably gonna win.

731
00:45:58,176 --> 00:46:02,149
Speaker 1: if someone keeps no because you can't take the same action twice and there's a big return.

732
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,742
Speaker 0: You also have to roll the one.

733
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:13,070
Speaker 0: the thing is if you get three actions You can always use that third action to draw a card and still get two actions Unless your hand is full of things that you can't lay down.

734
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:20,838
Speaker 0: But if you're using two, the other two actions to fulfill the cards, you can lay them down Ah, but you're also helping everyone else out and actually But you don't know if you're helping anyone else out.

735
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:21,944
Speaker 0: You could be hurting other people.

736
00:46:22,186 --> 00:46:22,950
Speaker 0: You don't know.

737
00:46:23,134 --> 00:46:23,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

738
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:30,330
Speaker 1: The way I won is I only did things that other players couldn't fuck with and that I could not help other players with.

739
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:34,641
Speaker 1: I got one because you know, there's three decks of the cards with these quests.

740
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:37,330
Speaker 1: One of them is basically configuration of the board.

741
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:45,849
Speaker 1: One of them is configuration of growth of bamboo on a particular tile Which is much more difficult to pull off.

742
00:46:46,536 --> 00:46:51,730
Speaker 1: And then one of them is Some combination of bamboo that Takinoko has eaten.

743
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:54,099
Speaker 1: No one else was going for that.

744
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:56,170
Speaker 1: So I just went for that like a hundred percent.

745
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:57,636
Speaker 0: I went for that a hundred percent.

746
00:46:57,696 --> 00:46:57,997
Speaker 0: Awesome.

747
00:46:58,017 --> 00:47:01,290
Speaker 1: So how come I had five cards with those points on them?

748
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,273
Speaker 1: And you had what one?

749
00:47:02,313 --> 00:47:05,104
Speaker 0: because you I kept rolling the thing.

750
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:12,630
Speaker 0: that gives me the stupid modifier tokens And you often rolled the wind thingy that let you choose the take card action twice.

751
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:14,850
Speaker 0: I only rolled wind once in the game.

752
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:20,370
Speaker 0: I was not able to draw enough of those cards even though I wanted to see if you have those modifiers.

753
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:24,650
Speaker 1: You really should be going for the high point one cards instead of the panda cards.

754
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:31,570
Speaker 0: I also went for the high point cards But the thing is you can't play the modifiers unless it's on an empty tile completely empty.

755
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:34,465
Speaker 0: So I had these modifiers I couldn't use for anything.

756
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,430
Speaker 0: We're completely useless.

757
00:47:35,932 --> 00:47:39,323
Speaker 0: So basically other people are getting bonuses on their turn by the luck of the die.

758
00:47:39,343 --> 00:47:41,490
Speaker 1: The game is a little random in that regard.

759
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:44,130
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's not perfect.

760
00:47:44,413 --> 00:47:53,058
Speaker 0: It's slightly less random than settlers But it's similar in its randomness to settlers in that you're playing a game where you make a bunch of decisions But every turn you roll a die.

761
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,302
Speaker 0: that determines something.

762
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:56,190
Speaker 0: it determines a third action, right?

763
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,596
Speaker 1: But the mechanics are.

764
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:04,546
Speaker 1: there's a lot of like interesting things going on to make the game Not nearly as simple to play optimally as say zularetto.

765
00:48:04,566 --> 00:48:05,369
Speaker 1: for one.

766
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:12,210
Speaker 1: There's the game of the odds of what different cards of people drawn or will they draw and will I give someone else victory points?

767
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,528
Speaker 1: And is someone else close to ending the game and all that stuff?

768
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:22,565
Speaker 1: There's also this mechanic of if you move the panda He'll then eat bamboo from wherever he ends up.

769
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:36,098
Speaker 1: if you move the farmer Then all the tiles of the same color as where he is that are adjacent to him The bamboo grows up and there's these cool pieces of stacking bamboo like on the board like these big stacks But both of them pieces

770
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:37,465
Speaker 0: in this game are really awesome in

771
00:48:37,485 --> 00:48:45,755
Speaker 1: a straight line Which doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal but because of the way the board grows It actually is a huge deal.

772
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:56,250
Speaker 1: because in order to go for a particular strategy like I wanted one particular spot to grow bamboo And it was incredibly obvious.

773
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:59,018
Speaker 1: This is what I wanted to happen because it was so difficult.

774
00:48:59,038 --> 00:49:06,968
Speaker 1: I had to take multiple actions to set it up to grow over there Meaning everyone knew I really wanted it to grow and just totally dick me on it.

775
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I sort of tried to pay attention to that.

776
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:17,627
Speaker 0: It was the first time but it's like I knew that someone wanted to put something somewhere and I was like Move the farmer to that spot.

777
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:18,514
Speaker 0: that way He can't.

778
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:24,830
Speaker 0: it can't move it in a straight line to the spot He wants to move it to and it won't be what he wants because he made it obvious to what he wants.

779
00:49:24,931 --> 00:49:26,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's what happened.

780
00:49:26,428 --> 00:49:38,429
Speaker 0: does Killing the other guy making him lose an action or lose points Taking him out of the game Whereas whenever I was my turn the panda and the farmer always happened to be in just the right spot for me?

781
00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:45,110
Speaker 0: Uh to move them where I wanted to move them But I couldn't get enough cards to draw so I only could score, you know, so many points.

782
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:53,048
Speaker 1: I don't know if it mattered but basically that spot I was going for was the only card I ever held that I didn't play And I knew I wasn't going to get it.

783
00:49:53,451 --> 00:50:01,575
Speaker 1: So whenever I had an extra action that I could not do anything useful with what I did is go for making that grow To convince everyone.

784
00:50:01,655 --> 00:50:07,393
Speaker 1: at least I was hoping to think I really needed that and waste their action stopping me from achieving Whatever it was.

785
00:50:07,413 --> 00:50:07,836
Speaker 1: they thought I was.

786
00:50:07,916 --> 00:50:10,630
Speaker 0: yeah, that's another thing is I never did an action to screw anyone.

787
00:50:10,711 --> 00:50:21,431
Speaker 0: That was not also an action to benefit me But you could by bluffing, you know, and depending on how many cards you've played already, you know to convince people that like you're ahead Or whatever.

788
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:27,270
Speaker 0: convince people to spend actions trying to hurt you and maybe they will hurt you or hurt your bluff or who knows what?

789
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:32,195
Speaker 0: Thus actually helping you by by hurting them But because they waste their actions now.

790
00:50:32,275 --> 00:50:48,045
Speaker 1: that part is interesting because this game mechanically would be Incredibly simple like baby's first ticket to ride, but there's just enough mechanics interleaved with each other to actually give a surprising amount of strategic depth.

791
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:57,348
Speaker 1: despite the randomness and four skilled players playing this game It'll actually turn into a twilight struggle anticipation and card counting.

792
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:03,517
Speaker 1: game Like it really will become a game of bluffing and second guessing right because it's like rim I know in his hand.

793
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,570
Speaker 0: He has the hex cards, right?

794
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,093
Speaker 1: Yes, three.

795
00:51:06,173 --> 00:51:08,310
Speaker 0: I have three of them and I can see on the board.

796
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:10,150
Speaker 0: I know what the possible hex cards are.

797
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:14,230
Speaker 0: It's usually three and a cook or three in a row and or four and a blob.

798
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:19,230
Speaker 0: So where I will make sure I will not draw any hex cards his hand has a limit on it.

799
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,829
Speaker 0: He can't play them unless he scores them.

800
00:51:21,355 --> 00:51:22,729
Speaker 0: I'm going to choose the hex action.

801
00:51:23,172 --> 00:51:32,170
Speaker 0: I'm going to put hexes down that I need of the right color to eat the panda or whatever But i'm going to put them in spots that make it impossible for any of those hex cards to score.

802
00:51:32,871 --> 00:51:34,985
Speaker 0: Now what's rim gonna do with his handful of cards?

803
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:35,730
Speaker 0: He can't score.

804
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:37,170
Speaker 0: He's pretty much done.

805
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:44,149
Speaker 1: But maybe I was bluffing on that because I have three hex cards in my hand that are worthless And I have two high scoring ones that you're ignoring now

806
00:51:44,991 --> 00:51:50,690
Speaker 0: Maybe but I have four high scoring ones and now I think I can score on four of mine and you'll only score.

807
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:51,335
Speaker 0: Well, maybe

808
00:51:51,416 --> 00:51:53,149
Speaker 1: but I just got really lucky in one anyway

809
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:54,775
Speaker 0: It's possible

810
00:51:55,238 --> 00:52:07,120
Speaker 1: now, I guess my point is just that the game Is more complex than you might think on the first play in that it'll have plenty of staying power even for skilled players, but It is not the main event.

811
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:08,390
Speaker 1: It's like zularetto.

812
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:13,828
Speaker 1: It's fun to play but I would play it as the warm-up before I played puerto rico or tigris new freddy's.

813
00:52:13,889 --> 00:52:14,270
Speaker 1: It's not.

814
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:17,670
Speaker 1: The brain feel is not that strong.

815
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:22,210
Speaker 0: It does not engage the brain, but I think but what's great about it, right?

816
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,888
Speaker 0: Is that it has a lot more brain feel than you know.

817
00:52:26,531 --> 00:52:31,326
Speaker 0: Your typical warm-up game like spotted but it only takes like 30 minutes.

818
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:32,390
Speaker 0: This game is fast.

819
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:34,176
Speaker 1: This game is faster than zularetto.

820
00:52:34,296 --> 00:52:52,680
Speaker 0: It's yeah, it's way faster than zularetto or settlers and just as you know Has just as much going on but it's over like that which is totally awesome in terms of you know overall brain power It's not the highest on the charts, but in terms of brain Power to time it takes to play an entire game.

821
00:52:52,901 --> 00:52:57,214
Speaker 0: The ratio may be the highest i've ever played ever Can you?

822
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:57,455
Speaker 1: that's?

823
00:52:57,878 --> 00:52:58,704
Speaker 1: that's a tough one.

824
00:52:58,744 --> 00:52:59,570
Speaker 1: I have to think on that.

825
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,713
Speaker 0: We could do a whole show on what game has more brain feel per minute Right.

826
00:53:04,953 --> 00:53:07,923
Speaker 0: It's like yeah sure eclipse is awesome, but it takes forever, right?

827
00:53:08,004 --> 00:53:09,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's plenty of other war games.

828
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:11,014
Speaker 0: They also take forever.

829
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:15,954
Speaker 0: what game has you know, and this is not as it doesn't have as much as puerto rico But it has a line.

830
00:53:15,974 --> 00:53:24,690
Speaker 1: it has as much as settlers battle line has a pretty intense Brain feel and is over pretty quickly, but I don't think it's quite on the ratio of this game.

831
00:53:25,051 --> 00:53:25,916
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so either.

832
00:53:26,096 --> 00:53:26,820
Speaker 1: i'll have to think on that.

833
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:34,430
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a show there something about What what we mean by brain feel because that's a term that me and scott have been using lately talking about games.

834
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:36,256
Speaker 0: You've been using it for the last five minutes.

835
00:53:36,517 --> 00:53:40,730
Speaker 1: No, i've been using it for a few weeks now and i've been hearing it off and on.

836
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,289
Speaker 1: No one else uses that term talking about bar games.

837
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:47,749
Speaker 1: I feel like we might need to clarify what we mean by that.

838
00:53:48,831 --> 00:53:53,150
Speaker 1: Pretty sure someone else has maybe but I think I think we could do a show on something like that.

839
00:53:53,170 --> 00:54:12,079
Speaker 1: But anyway, takinoko is Equivalent to ticket to ride or zularetto in terms of hey, here's a pretty easy to teach game that we can play while we socialize As opposed to the silent game of puerto rico, but it's not a completely worthless game that you know.

840
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:20,250
Speaker 1: that has no intellectual component whatsoever and Simultaneously is not a light game like spot it which while spotted is very light mechanically.

841
00:54:21,011 --> 00:54:22,514
Speaker 1: It wears the brain out.

842
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:28,269
Speaker 1: for one because of the type of test it is and two you can't actually socialize while playing spot it.

843
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:43,490
Speaker 0: This game is also short so you can socialize And then bail quickly as opposed to be, you know Even if it's a socializable game, you won't be evicted from the party because the game's over quickly and you're back partying exactly.

844
00:54:43,994 --> 00:54:45,728
Speaker 1: So i'm probably gonna buy it.

845
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:46,908
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you?

846
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:49,864
Speaker 1: Well, if you bought it I would not.

847
00:54:50,005 --> 00:54:50,709
Speaker 1: why would you not?

848
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:52,294
Speaker 0: Because I don't want to.

849
00:54:52,395 --> 00:54:53,360
Speaker 1: well then I won't buy it.

850
00:54:53,782 --> 00:54:54,667
Speaker 1: So now we can't play it.

851
00:54:54,888 --> 00:55:04,190
Speaker 1: Okay We'll say This has been geek nights with rim and scott special.
