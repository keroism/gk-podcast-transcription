1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,581
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 29th 2020.

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,549
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:19,469
Speaker 1: tonight We are reviewing be stars the anime season 1 from Netflix.

4
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:28,255
Speaker 1: Let's do this so one of the glories of Being stuck at home.

5
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:35,689
Speaker 1: Well, we don't actually have much more free time because like we're all still at least working like our lot Like we still have to do a lot of the things we had to do before.

6
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:38,640
Speaker 1: it's just that we can't really leave the house.

7
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:47,518
Speaker 1: So I'm playing a lot of play by mail or asynchronous games where I can take turns Whenever I happen to be free over the course of the day.

8
00:00:48,942 --> 00:00:51,097
Speaker 1: That seems to be how I'm gonna spend a lot of my time during all this.

9
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,203
Speaker 1: So we're playing.

10
00:00:54,243 --> 00:01:02,898
Speaker 1: now, you know, we've talked about a gig nights about those train games like 18 something like one eight something something The something anyone on Wednesday care about this.

11
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:07,060
Speaker 1: We're playing these games online, but we found a basically among that.

12
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,280
Speaker 0: It's about you know, some of the nerdiest board game you can possibly find.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,482
Speaker 1: Yeah They're like.

14
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:22,079
Speaker 1: these are the kinds of games where you'll see like the people who look weirder than everyone else at your local like events Sitting in the corner by themselves playing what looks like the same game for more than four hours.

15
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you go to that corner of the game store where all the games look like only old dudes would play them.

16
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, yep.

17
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the picture of a train on the cover the art looks way bad.

18
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,900
Speaker 0: The graphic design is way bad.

19
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:38,800
Speaker 1: Yep, so we're playing one of those games online in addition now to like all the Civ games and everything else.

20
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:49,918
Speaker 1: So my advice to you out there is if you are looking for games to play Now is the time to try out play by mail or at least asynchronous games like their time has come.

21
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:51,107
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,585
Speaker 1: Not like we have any other opening bits.

23
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:59,486
Speaker 1: It's not like like oh what I was biking to work today and somehow like I didn't go anywhere No in my house.

24
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:01,980
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure I can't even shower.

25
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:05,158
Speaker 1: I did shy still shower every day.

26
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:07,792
Speaker 1: No, I don't but I don't wash my hair.

27
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,395
Speaker 0: I didn't even change.

28
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:09,240
Speaker 0: I don't even change my climb.

29
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,979
Speaker 0: I've been wearing these clothes probably for three days.

30
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,791
Speaker 1: Oh, well, see I think because I have to video chat so much for work at least from like waist up I'm always wearing like a nice collared shirt.

31
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:21,926
Speaker 0: pretty sure This shirt was worn during the last geekness.

32
00:02:22,347 --> 00:02:23,951
Speaker 1: Oh, and I I could go to.

33
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:25,375
Speaker 1: I could go verify that I suppose.

34
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:26,860
Speaker 0: I suppose you could.

35
00:02:27,942 --> 00:02:29,132
Speaker 1: So there is some news going on.

36
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:29,959
Speaker 1: I guess you can go first.

37
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:34,360
Speaker 1: It's a Japan related at least if not specifically anime related, right?

38
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,977
Speaker 0: So if you're a you know a weeb you probably buy stuff that you have shipped from Japan, right?

39
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:46,940
Speaker 0: It's a thing that happens Yep, especially if you use various websites that send Japanese stuff, right?

40
00:02:48,741 --> 00:03:13,819
Speaker 0: So if you do this, you're probably aware the Japan post the Japan Japanese post office has Two major, you know Shipping methods that are used for people in the US buying nerdy goods, right and those are EMS and SAL right, so SAL is basically economy air service and EMS is like Express Mail service, right?

41
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,999
Speaker 0: So both of these are basically suspended for the time being since like the beginning of the month.

42
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:30,020
Speaker 1: so If you want any nerdy goods from Japan Or if you tried to mail anything to Japan like it's just not gonna happen.

43
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,471
Speaker 0: Well, you don't you wouldn't use these to mail to Japan.

44
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:32,954
Speaker 0: This is front.

45
00:03:32,974 --> 00:03:33,958
Speaker 0: This is things from Japan.

46
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 0: now.

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,851
Speaker 0: Okay, I see right you something you're sending something with the Japanese post office.

48
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,135
Speaker 0: the US post office hasn't?

49
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:45,297
Speaker 1: because I saw I saw other Articles I didn't read about a bunch of countries refusing any inbound mail as well.

50
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,340
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know if what the USPS has suspended right like is they suspended priority mail like I don't know, right?

51
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:55,560
Speaker 0: But it's like they've suspended their priority mail equivalent.

52
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,920
Speaker 0: So you can't mail things to the you to certain countries at least right?

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,317
Speaker 0: So you can't if you're in Japan, you can't EMS or SAL something to the US and some other places that They're not sending to right now.

54
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:30,080
Speaker 0: So, you know obviously in the short term it makes it a little harder to get nerdy goods Right, and it means that various nerdy companies that sell Japanese goods to weebs around the world Have to like hold on to goods longer take pre-orders that they're gonna deliver on later You know have less sales period charge more for shipping find some other way to ship, right?

55
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:35,239
Speaker 0: You know, maybe some other carrier like FedEx will send it or who for a fortune or whatever they charge.

56
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:55,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the interesting is at the same time There's a lot of American vendors who have inventories of stuff already that go do that Run the convention circuit trying to sell that stuff because if you buy this stuff online It tends to be cheaper like it almost never is cheaper to buy stuff in person from vendors at like anime conventions

57
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:58,112
Speaker 0: The only the conventions unless

58
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,176
Speaker 1: you're buying weird old stuff,

59
00:04:59,859 --> 00:05:00,000
Speaker 0: right?

60
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,487
Speaker 0: It would be that they bring a bunch of.

61
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:03,135
Speaker 0: they bring their clearance bin with them.

62
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:04,080
Speaker 0: That's not on their website.

63
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, but dig into that.

64
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:18,800
Speaker 1: if we if weaves are desperate in the US and there's no conventions where they would normally go and buy Like this the impulse buys that they just pick up from those bargain bins and at the conventions and nothing can get mailed.

65
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:26,327
Speaker 1: I feel like the domestic vendors might be able to finally clear out a lot of their inventory Depending on what that inventory is.

66
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:39,720
Speaker 0: if you got a bunch of old like Ron mo on half plush exactly domestic the domestic nerdy good vendors That normally would be at conventions now have all this stuff that they already have and I'll go to their websites.

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,666
Speaker 0: They're probably happy to sell it to you and they probably need to sell it because they want to stay in business Without all these cons happening.

68
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:49,820
Speaker 0: So seek them out and buy their stuff probably for cheap.

69
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:57,080
Speaker 0: But yeah, I think it's gonna be interesting because it's not like anime production has been impacted.

70
00:05:57,181 --> 00:05:57,969
Speaker 0: Yes, it actually has.

71
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:59,060
Speaker 1: that was gonna be my news.

72
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:00,460
Speaker 1: I won't go into all of them.

73
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,980
Speaker 1: But there is a long list of anime series where episodes are delayed or things are slowing down because of coronavirus.

74
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,546
Speaker 0: Okay, well shows production slowing down.

75
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:18,474
Speaker 0: that's good and bad to hear yeah, but regardless the point is You know new new merch comes out.

76
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,540
Speaker 0: the merch won't come here.

77
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,320
Speaker 0: They'll be like this backlog and I wonder if certain series for example the one we're talking about tonight be stars.

78
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:35,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, if there's some Japanese be stars merch, but because of the timing of this will some series just naturally have less merch that gets exported?

79
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:41,395
Speaker 0: because You know by the time they're exporting again, they'll be new series and they'll export that merch.

80
00:06:42,137 --> 00:06:44,900
Speaker 0: and so for you know Say a be stars which came out right now.

81
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:52,120
Speaker 1: that Is definitely like bootleg fan-made nonsense in the u.s.

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:07:10,460
Speaker 0: I don't think there's that many merch for that series in particular but I'm just saying that like the timing of when different shows come out in relation to the difficulty of exporting goods could cause the Quantity of goods for different series right and you know based on the timing of their popularity.

83
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,469
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's something more or less.

84
00:07:12,549 --> 00:07:12,850
Speaker 1: We haven't.

85
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,638
Speaker 1: we don't talk about anime cons on the show much anymore We don't really go to any but when we used to and we talked about this a lot more.

86
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:28,100
Speaker 1: one thing You should know about the industry Is that the demand from American fans for merch from particular shows is such a flash in the pan?

87
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,340
Speaker 0: Like it depends on the show, right?

88
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:34,416
Speaker 1: Like whatever the nice hotness is people really want it like attack on Titan.

89
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:39,740
Speaker 1: people would like Murder each other to get some merch from that show and then it just like suddenly evaporated.

90
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's how it was.

91
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:51,920
Speaker 0: We went to anime Boston every year and every year There would be a different hot show and you go into the artist alley and whatever show had the most Artwork fan art that was selling hot.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,559
Speaker 0: It's like you knew that was the hot show and it would be a different show every single year.

93
00:07:56,162 --> 00:07:58,610
Speaker 0: Some shows be perennial to some extent right?

94
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:07,740
Speaker 0: It's like I can't remember the last artist alley at any kind of convention I've been to that didn't have a Doctor Who fan art Final Fantasy fan art or right or something like that.

95
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:17,100
Speaker 0: But other things sort of you know wax and wane and spike, you know, especially Something like a high Q for example, right?

96
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,180
Speaker 0: It's like this, you know.

97
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,860
Speaker 0: It's like it was a time and a year where like that was the biggest deal and every everyone was selling high Q stuff.

98
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:25,370
Speaker 0: It's like his high Q died.

99
00:08:25,612 --> 00:08:26,860
Speaker 0: No, it's still got fans.

100
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,617
Speaker 0: It's still a thing.

101
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:40,018
Speaker 0: but if you go to an artist alley now It's like the fan art you're gonna see is like maybe one or two here and there from the people and they made that stuff When it was a flash in the pan, they're just still selling off those prints or whatever it is.

102
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:51,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in some other news or related to all of the crisis and everything in Japan I'm not gonna link to all the articles about specific delays and anime because you can just go look that up.

103
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:57,739
Speaker 1: But Buried in that on anime news network was a really short article that is a little more worrying around this.

104
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:04,864
Speaker 1: It basically is a statement from the Olympic Committee president That white.

105
00:09:04,965 --> 00:09:11,168
Speaker 1: yes, you know the Japan Olympics were delayed from 2020 to 2021 But they've now quietly issued like that.

106
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,179
Speaker 1: quietly, but they issued the state Kira Kira averted by one.

107
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:27,040
Speaker 1: But they issued the statement basically saying that if the dates they've selected for 2021 Are not able to be used the toward the Japan Japan Olympics will just be canceled, right?

108
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,489
Speaker 1: There will be no further reschedulings right?

109
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,637
Speaker 0: If you can't do it next year, you can't do it.

110
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:39,677
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Teaches you to not mess with the Olympics In some other news.

111
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:40,944
Speaker 1: We've taught.

112
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:43,519
Speaker 1: we've talked about this a lot a long time ago on the show as well.

113
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:54,080
Speaker 1: Diamond distributors is a problem for a lot of reasons But they're kind of the sole or primary distributor for almost every comic book store in America.

114
00:09:54,905 --> 00:10:02,053
Speaker 0: Right if you own a nerdy store in America You know all of your goods that you're selling in your nerdy store.

115
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,400
Speaker 0: You're probably just buying them from diamond distributors.

116
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:08,116
Speaker 0: They have a big catalog right you you can get the catalog if you want.

117
00:10:08,156 --> 00:10:09,040
Speaker 0: It's cheap, right?

118
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,670
Speaker 0: It's a big enormous thing like computer shopper used to be.

119
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,280
Speaker 0: yeah, and you order comic books mostly from it.

120
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,666
Speaker 0: But you also can order swag and even games and all kinds of stuff from that catalog statues Magazines all kinds of shit.

121
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:25,740
Speaker 0: you fill up your comic book store, and then you sell that stuff off.

122
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:32,738
Speaker 0: And we talked I guess if a week or two ago about how You know they're stopping some operation.

123
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:39,868
Speaker 1: right yeah Because they were affected by all the quarantine rules and because they're kind of a monopoly That really screwed over a lot of stores.

124
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,914
Speaker 1: granted a lot of those stores can't operate anyway.

125
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:54,326
Speaker 0: now right but also You know there's the company DCB service where I've been ordering comic books from since And they have a lot that.

126
00:10:54,366 --> 00:11:05,640
Speaker 0: what that company does is they have a large warehouse in Indiana Where they basically because the way diamond works is you know the more you order the more of a discount you get right up to?

127
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,032
Speaker 0: a certain tier right.

128
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:19,526
Speaker 0: so Basically if you're just a little little comic book store with a you know in a small town you only order so much product from the catalog that you then sell to your customers, so You don't get a big discount.

129
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:20,589
Speaker 0: so your margins are small.

130
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:21,311
Speaker 0: right.

131
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:30,819
Speaker 0: if you open up say a giant warehouse in Indiana And you let people online you let them buy stuff right from you Which you're buying from diamond?

132
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,740
Speaker 0: But then also you make them pre-order two months in advance because the catalog comes out two months in advance of the stuff shipping.

133
00:11:38,923 --> 00:11:45,660
Speaker 0: So now not only are you getting wider margins because you're getting the biggest discount tier from diamonds right?

134
00:11:45,760 --> 00:12:10,080
Speaker 0: They're giving you the same copy of Batman for less money than they sell it to a different store for right because you bought a Thousand copies yeah But also you're increasing your margins because you're not buying a copy of Batman and having it sit on a shelf right you're buying Exactly the right numbers of copies of Batman because everything's a pre-order whereas in a comic book store They let you do pre-orders, and they really want you to because then again they more accurately predict how many to buy.

135
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,591
Speaker 1: That's why so many comic shops have that thing of tell us what you want And we'll have a little older where we give it to you every month.

136
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,340
Speaker 0: exactly please get a pull list.

137
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,651
Speaker 0: We really want you to write pre-order so we can make more money.

138
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:23,140
Speaker 0: right and you will get you the exact comics you want.

139
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,806
Speaker 0: But some people those are a lot of.

140
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,091
Speaker 0: there's a lot of drama around those.

141
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:31,165
Speaker 0: at comic stores people get pull lists and then Not come in and pick them up Just disappear they're not.

142
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:41,422
Speaker 0: the other thing is that people with a pull list at a comic book store even if you're a good customer And you come and pick it up on time right and you're constantly paying them you're paying after the books arrive Right.

143
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:49,105
Speaker 0: with DCB service you're paying when you order right so they have the money to buy the books before They order them from diamond.

144
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:59,638
Speaker 0: yep now diamond is the exclusive distributor for DC Marvel Dark Horse and image And basically almost all US comic books and a whole bunch of other stuff.

145
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:05,180
Speaker 1: yeah, yep So the news is they have officially announced a date where they will restart operations.

146
00:13:05,782 --> 00:13:09,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how they're not gonna fully restart operations like it was nothing happened.

147
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,878
Speaker 1: They claim they're gonna start shipping to shops again on May 20th.

148
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:21,528
Speaker 0: Okay, but also is interesting service that I just talked about started some of their own Minor distribution operations off to the side.

149
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:25,019
Speaker 0: I think to help DC get comics out when diamond wasn't doing it.

150
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,749
Speaker 0: yeah So there's something going on there, but it doesn't know.

151
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,480
Speaker 0: they said it doesn't affect DCB service customers.

152
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:36,080
Speaker 0: It's just sort of a side thing that they happen to be doing because they have the capability and capacity to do so.

153
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:42,420
Speaker 1: Yeah now most comic publishers stop releasing books anyway.

154
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, almost every title is like delayed for a while.

155
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:49,166
Speaker 0: right it's like well if I can't sell it I'm not gonna keep drawing them.

156
00:13:49,608 --> 00:13:59,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we don't know where this is all gonna Go, we don't know how well like diamonds starting back up will go if it'll even matter because the entire supply chain is disrupted like Them.

157
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:05,000
Speaker 1: coming back online in May might not actually have any impact on the actual industry.

158
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:10,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm curious if how many comic book stores are still open right that want their orders.

159
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,072
Speaker 0: They just went out of business.

160
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,019
Speaker 0: how many?

161
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,068
Speaker 0: Comic book you know have been created.

162
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:18,899
Speaker 0: That's like okay, so we're ready to distribute comic books again.

163
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,935
Speaker 0: All right well We haven't made any.

164
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you'll have to wait for us to make some more.

165
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:33,743
Speaker 1: and with all the delays will there be more smaller publishers Who don't fall into the evil alliance with diamond and use these other channels that have this brief window to come on to the scene While everything's disrupted?

166
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:34,546
Speaker 0: yeah pretty much.

167
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:40,503
Speaker 0: the only other channels are digital and in the u.s.. At least our digital Bookstore channels.

168
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,452
Speaker 0: and the bookstore channel is different because people don't.

169
00:14:43,653 --> 00:14:44,897
Speaker 0: it is inside stuff right.

170
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:45,860
Speaker 0: it's not that inside.

171
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,768
Speaker 0: But if you make a book and sell it to like through a distributor to Barnes & Noble That's returnable.

172
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,488
Speaker 0: so Barnes & Noble gets it on their shelf And they never sell your stupid comic book.

173
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,531
Speaker 1: not all books like.

174
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:03,051
Speaker 1: there's weird different relationships like go read about what happened with TSR and bookstores back in the day.

175
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,426
Speaker 0: like they that shit sits on the shelf And then it goes in the clearance bin and no one buys it.

176
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,977
Speaker 0: they can return it right and get their money back.

177
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:14,939
Speaker 1: now return Usually means just prove to us that you destroyed it.

178
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:17,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they don't actually send the book back a lot.

179
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,780
Speaker 0: They'll tear the cover off and throw it away.

180
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,440
Speaker 1: That's why you go to like dodgy anime cons and dodgy comic cons.

181
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:30,909
Speaker 1: They'll often be that one vendor in the back like that's just like a card table and under the card table They've got boxes and boxes of books without covers.

182
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,716
Speaker 1: They're illegally selling those.

183
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:33,580
Speaker 0: yep.

184
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,324
Speaker 0: Regardless, that's right.

185
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:38,592
Speaker 0: That's why books are a different deal than comic books.

186
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,740
Speaker 0: comic books is a direct market from diamond.

187
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,724
Speaker 0: It's not returnable.

188
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:45,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is a change it used to be until diamond came along.

189
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:48,780
Speaker 0: You can read all about that history in great detail online.

190
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:56,600
Speaker 0: But yeah that whole thing has been messed up by coronavirus in a significant way which shows you the weakness of monopolies.

191
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:58,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's really that gets really.

192
00:15:58,993 --> 00:15:59,979
Speaker 0: the story here is right.

193
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,778
Speaker 0: look What happens when you only have one company and something happens to it?

194
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need a diversity of supply chains.

195
00:16:05,369 --> 00:16:09,203
Speaker 1: vertical and horizontal monopolies are a bad deal Mm-hmm.

196
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:11,832
Speaker 1: so I got a really really brief geek bite cuz.

197
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:14,420
Speaker 1: as you know we've watched the first season of DuckTales the new one.

198
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:14,996
Speaker 1: It was really good.

199
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,530
Speaker 1: I'm actually watching the second season now like there's more seasons.

200
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,975
Speaker 0: Are there uh three?

201
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:22,740
Speaker 0: how many episodes per season?

202
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,286
Speaker 1: There's 52 episodes total.

203
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,372
Speaker 0: That's a lot.

204
00:16:25,432 --> 00:16:25,613
Speaker 0: Okay.

205
00:16:26,176 --> 00:16:26,920
Speaker 1: That just keeps going.

206
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,536
Speaker 1: Now season three is that I don't know.

207
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,060
Speaker 0: see watching it.

208
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,461
Speaker 0: That's good.

209
00:16:30,642 --> 00:16:35,620
Speaker 1: season three is not out yet, but season two is the same length of season one, and I'm watching it now.

210
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:38,066
Speaker 1: It's like 90% as good as season one.

211
00:16:38,448 --> 00:16:40,814
Speaker 1: It's a little less punchy though like.

212
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:45,247
Speaker 1: it's still good, but it's less Comedically dense than season one was.

213
00:16:45,648 --> 00:16:52,175
Speaker 1: it's like the difference between Simpsons season five and Simpsons season seven I'd say sure so good like.

214
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:59,280
Speaker 1: I'm still enjoying it But it's a little less punchy and some of the beats are a little more predictable, but otherwise it's still just great.

215
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,083
Speaker 1: I just watched the episode where the three capieros show up, and that really hit me right in the nostalgia Mmm.

216
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:11,025
Speaker 0: So in other news right we always talk about One second.

217
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:19,220
Speaker 0: we always talk about how You got to go to the movie theater whenever there's an anime in the movie theater.

218
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,098
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, just 100% if it's even if it's kind of meh.

219
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:25,398
Speaker 1: I've seen some meh movies in the theater cuz why not?

220
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,385
Speaker 0: Right exactly because it.

221
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:30,619
Speaker 0: you know it's like we're lucky to live in an era where we can do that sort of thing.

222
00:17:31,826 --> 00:17:36,077
Speaker 0: However The you can't go to the theater right now.

223
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:43,080
Speaker 0: so What's happening is a lot of those anime movies especially the ones that were in theaters recently?

224
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:45,226
Speaker 0: Are available for streaming.

225
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,060
Speaker 0: so for example promare just became available for streaming?

226
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,809
Speaker 1: Yep, if you did not see promare in the theater it is.

227
00:17:51,829 --> 00:17:52,752
Speaker 1: it is another.

228
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,077
Speaker 1: it is in the genre that I like to call Anime that saved anime.

229
00:17:57,308 --> 00:17:57,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

230
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:07,320
Speaker 0: and also You know some of those Anime that This is what happens that I look stuff.

231
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,580
Speaker 0: That's why I can't be on the computer while I'm podcasting set a separate place eyes open.

232
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:14,573
Speaker 1: This is why Scott keeps his eyes closed when we do the show.

233
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 0: That's a good reason.

234
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I start looking at something It's like it's like a.

235
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:22,900
Speaker 1: he's like a dune navigator where he can't look through his normal eyes.

236
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,917
Speaker 1: He has to look through his prescient eyes to be able to talk exactly exactly.

237
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:39,300
Speaker 0: Some of those anime like promare that are now available for streaming are sadly You know that the big movie theater ones are not available in these sort of free Netflix fashion.

238
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:41,929
Speaker 0: They're available in the pay a few dollars.

239
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,237
Speaker 0: watch it on Amazon Prime YouTube.

240
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever mood Which is fine?

241
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:52,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've watched a lot of movies like Jojo rabbit recently like a lot of movies I want to like.

242
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:55,505
Speaker 0: look you were gonna go to the theater and pay $14 to watch it.

243
00:18:55,525 --> 00:19:00,240
Speaker 0: so at home, you're not gonna pay two or four right to watch it in HD or something.

244
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:00,910
Speaker 0: It's like it's fine.

245
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:07,300
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz you have to buying digital movies cuz they charge a lot more if you want to have that to watch anytime you want.

246
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,118
Speaker 0: But well, it's like it's compared to paying, you know, what $20 a month for Netflix.

247
00:19:11,158 --> 00:19:12,966
Speaker 0: It's like, okay Well, that's the cost of five movies.

248
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:15,860
Speaker 0: if I could watch way more than five and I'm there suit, right?

249
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could watch a whole season of something right.

250
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:19,780
Speaker 1: but plus it's like four dollars.

251
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:28,666
Speaker 1: Like that's less than I paid even if you don't take inflation into account to break the breakfast sandwich anyway, but in So yeah, just be aware of that.

252
00:19:28,886 --> 00:19:33,303
Speaker 0: right promare is currently I think in that mode where you have to pay to watch it Individually.

253
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:35,010
Speaker 1: go pay to watch if you haven't seen it.

254
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,299
Speaker 1: It's about climate change and it's also about ice.

255
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:40,580
Speaker 1: Right literally now literally and figuratively.

256
00:19:41,342 --> 00:19:56,140
Speaker 0: Now what about the ant the animated films that were in production that we were going to go see in the theater that we're gonna come Out soon, but we couldn't Even if you're like us, even if you're like us and you were you know Go into the theater to see things, you know for their one night only screenings.

257
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:57,944
Speaker 0: What do you do now?

258
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:02,080
Speaker 0: What are those, you know films doing now that there is no screening to have?

259
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,531
Speaker 0: Alright, so one the most awaited one I think is not even anime.

260
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:11,507
Speaker 1: It's a wolf walkers from cartoon saloon Yeah, the third of the sort of trill.

261
00:20:11,547 --> 00:20:15,240
Speaker 1: it not really trilogy, but the third of the movies they've been making in this vein.

262
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:27,313
Speaker 0: There was secret of Kells there was song at a see right, you know, and now there there was some other ones They made that were not You know, those are like the Tom Moore directed one.

263
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ones that are like famous, right?

264
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:31,180
Speaker 0: There's also ones they did like breadwinner and such.

265
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:44,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway wolf walkers is the new hot one that everyone's waiting so hard for From the end of the Irish animation studio and it turns out that they've been working from home Awesomely and that shits coming out on time.

266
00:20:46,123 --> 00:20:56,878
Speaker 0: but what's interesting to note is that Currently it there hasn't been any official announcement about the official G kids distribution of this film.

267
00:20:58,863 --> 00:21:03,160
Speaker 0: G kids distributed, you know, basically all the big anime movies, right?

268
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,767
Speaker 0: And also basically all the cool.

269
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:09,399
Speaker 0: if G kids distributes an animated movie in the US you want to go see it, right?

270
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:19,639
Speaker 0: All the Uassa's all the you know Miyazaki's all that stuff is through G kids that just movie distributor And as well as the cartoon saloon stuff.

271
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:24,200
Speaker 0: But wolf walkers hasn't been officially announced as being distributed through G kids.

272
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:33,910
Speaker 0: But what has been officially announced to chagrin is that it will be on the like Apple plus Paid streamy thing.

273
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:42,288
Speaker 0: Oh the one I won't use Right, which I think would require you to have some sort of Apple device To be able to watch it.

274
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not that's not great.

275
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:51,075
Speaker 0: So unless G kids makes an announcement soon, which who knows with the lack of theaters.

276
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:52,860
Speaker 0: It's like why do you need G kids, right?

277
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:02,200
Speaker 0: And with the Apple Plus already in place Apple may it's possible But it hasn't been confirmed that Apple might have locked in that wolf walkers with a pile of money.

278
00:22:04,515 --> 00:22:07,380
Speaker 0: You Know and that's that you know, it's definitely an Apple thing, right?

279
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,420
Speaker 0: It's such like a prestige kind of project that would be right up their alley.

280
00:22:12,862 --> 00:22:16,704
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I hope you have an Apple device, yeah Because I hate to.

281
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:19,374
Speaker 1: I don't want to pirate a Tom Moore movie like.

282
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:25,137
Speaker 1: no, maybe I'll pirate it But I'll just like cut him a check for like 20 bucks something like that.

283
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:28,229
Speaker 0: Who knows what's gonna be but we'll see.

284
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,113
Speaker 0: it could just be.

285
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,600
Speaker 0: you know that they haven't said anything yet.

286
00:22:30,942 --> 00:22:31,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not.

287
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:32,839
Speaker 0: it's not a confirmed thing.

288
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:37,495
Speaker 0: It's just because the Apple thing was confirmed and the G kids hasn't yet.

289
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:40,030
Speaker 0: Everyone's like, oh no I hope I get to watch this movie.

290
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,260
Speaker 0: I've been waiting it for so long.

291
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,498
Speaker 0: I don't want to not be able to watch it.

292
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,577
Speaker 0: I don't want to have this said.

293
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:57,400
Speaker 0: also I don't want to have to be tweeted about doing something with wolves like right and I'll also I don't want to have to buy an Apple device and or subscribe to this Apple TV plus garbage that I don't want for anything else just to watch one movie.

294
00:22:57,621 --> 00:23:00,598
Speaker 0: Yep, maybe I can free trial and watch it and I don't know.

295
00:23:00,618 --> 00:23:00,900
Speaker 0: We'll see.

296
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:08,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of the things if I ever have real political power would be to bust up exclusivity agreements in all industries.

297
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:27,403
Speaker 1: yep, but anyway things of the day looks like your thing of the day is from Yesterday, so I think it's only fair that my thing of the day is from 2007.

298
00:23:27,403 --> 00:23:28,927
Speaker 0: Okay Sure.

299
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:36,780
Speaker 1: so Unrelatedly, I was streaming myself playing DDR mostly as a challenge to see if I could synchronize that shed.

300
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:39,089
Speaker 1: That is harder than it looks but I did it.

301
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:41,840
Speaker 1: and then of course the videos immediately got copyright flag.

302
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:44,789
Speaker 1: No trouble just you know dance dance revolution music.

303
00:23:45,431 --> 00:23:51,920
Speaker 1: All of that is not licensed to me to use and There's like 20 or 30 claims on each one of these videos, which is fine.

304
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:56,494
Speaker 1: But while I was looking at the claims just to click yes fine whatever.

305
00:23:56,875 --> 00:23:57,818
Speaker 1: so my video would stay up.

306
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:20,335
Speaker 1: I I noticed that the people who own the rights to all of Captain Jack's music Were claiming them because I played a bunch of Captain Jack songs Which reminded me that Captain Jack existed and I went on YouTube and sure enough I found His most important work the music video he made to dream a dream.

307
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:26,740
Speaker 1: if you have never seen The official music video to Captain Jack's dream a dream It's something.

308
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:28,383
Speaker 0: It's great.

309
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:35,960
Speaker 1: It's something alright, so this video was uploaded on April 3rd 2007 and you might say oh, but it's so low quality.

310
00:24:36,902 --> 00:24:38,492
Speaker 1: Now that's the quality of the video.

311
00:24:38,512 --> 00:24:39,136
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get it.

312
00:24:39,156 --> 00:24:39,679
Speaker 0: That's the this.

313
00:24:39,699 --> 00:24:40,685
Speaker 0: well I mean, it's not it's.

314
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:42,295
Speaker 0: it's not the best video quality.

315
00:24:42,335 --> 00:24:42,838
Speaker 0: They had an o7.

316
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,691
Speaker 0: It's the best digital video quality.

317
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:45,194
Speaker 0: they had an o7.

318
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,100
Speaker 1: yeah pretty much.

319
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,080
Speaker 1: This was clearly someone like taped this off of TV, and then uploaded it to YouTube.

320
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,327
Speaker 0: Yep You're lucky to see any of it.

321
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:56,020
Speaker 1: Yep, so what do you got so?

322
00:24:57,241 --> 00:25:11,655
Speaker 0: You know long ago right one of our favorite comic creators right created a series called Mouse Guard And then Mouse Guard the Black Axe and there really much hasn't been new Mouse Guard since then.

323
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,702
Speaker 0: really it's sort of been like it Right?

324
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:14,387
Speaker 1: yeah, there was.

325
00:25:14,407 --> 00:25:15,354
Speaker 1: there's the board game.

326
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:24,667
Speaker 0: There's the role-playing game There's all that like ancillary stuff right and while David Peterson is still out there doing all sorts of other stuff especially lately I know sadly.

327
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:25,371
Speaker 0: I think he had.

328
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:32,296
Speaker 0: I think the story I heard was that he was like taking care of his his ill mother and sadly she passed.

329
00:25:32,356 --> 00:25:38,434
Speaker 0: I don't know when exactly But I guess if you want to put a silver lining on something like that.

330
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:39,779
Speaker 0: He now has a lot more time.

331
00:25:40,824 --> 00:25:46,575
Speaker 0: so He has been doing a lot lately especially during you know everyone being trapped inside.

332
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:48,483
Speaker 0: if you're an artist you can do a lot trapped Inside.

333
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,800
Speaker 0: yeah, he works right from his house anyway.

334
00:25:52,201 --> 00:25:53,706
Speaker 0: So he has been really killing it.

335
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:57,279
Speaker 0: He's been doing lots of twitch streaming and YouTube video uploading.

336
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,964
Speaker 1: Oh shit This is 40 minutes long.

337
00:25:59,025 --> 00:25:59,848
Speaker 1: This is legit.

338
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:01,714
Speaker 0: What do you think I'm doing?

339
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:03,320
Speaker 0: my things of the day aren't trash like yours.

340
00:26:05,544 --> 00:26:07,319
Speaker 1: You're saying that Captain Jack is trash.

341
00:26:07,886 --> 00:26:09,100
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that Jack is trash.

342
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,160
Speaker 0: I'm saying that's a kind of a mad thing of the day like you know a 13 year old music video.

343
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:19,914
Speaker 0: So you know he's done lots of stuff like he's doing the equivalent of sometimes.

344
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:31,299
Speaker 0: He'll do the equivalent of like panels on his twitch stream right and sometimes he'll do like the equivalent of like a. You know a vendor table at a convention like he's selling stuff on his twitch stream, right?

345
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:34,129
Speaker 0: I saw him like one time.

346
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,994
Speaker 0: This is a while ago.

347
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:45,415
Speaker 0: actually he was drawing Something and he's like yeah, we're gonna put this on like a tote bag and sell it at the comic-con when there were still cons Right yeah, and he was drawing the whole thing right there talking all about it.

348
00:26:45,455 --> 00:26:46,640
Speaker 0: Why he's deciding it this way?

349
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,846
Speaker 0: He said yeah We had to do it this way not that way.

350
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,741
Speaker 0: cuz this look better on the bag and you know the the way the printing Works.

351
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:53,965
Speaker 0: he's going all in right.

352
00:26:54,005 --> 00:26:55,689
Speaker 0: It's like a super behind the scenes.

353
00:26:56,271 --> 00:27:01,104
Speaker 0: You know life of life and work of amazing Comic artist.

354
00:27:01,124 --> 00:27:03,109
Speaker 0: so here on YouTube just yesterday.

355
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:12,299
Speaker 0: He uploaded as rim said a 40-minute video That is a creator commentary on mouse guard the blackaxe number one.

356
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:17,997
Speaker 0: so like you don't see this kind of thing too often you see it in movies were like.

357
00:27:18,017 --> 00:27:25,020
Speaker 0: you'll get a Commentary track where you know someone's talking while the movies playing right and you watch the whole movie, right?

358
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:41,861
Speaker 0: But this is like a dude going through his entire book like 40 minutes long for a not very large book right going into great detail about like what went into every page You know writing art for like everything Like what.

359
00:27:41,901 --> 00:27:42,843
Speaker 0: I've never seen this before.

360
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:46,429
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's been done before right, but what comic book have you seen this for?

361
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:46,469
Speaker 0: I?

362
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,145
Speaker 0: Haven't?

363
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,139
Speaker 1: I'm definitely going to watch this entire video.

364
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:56,900
Speaker 0: So yeah read all mouse guards and then come back and watch this and you got time to read all mouse guards.

365
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:57,890
Speaker 0: It won't take you that long.

366
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,840
Speaker 0: There's not that many of them?

367
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,804
Speaker 1: Yeah, I give it link back to.

368
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,237
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we've reviewed multiple segments of mouse guard over the years.

369
00:28:03,318 --> 00:28:03,880
Speaker 1: cuz it's good.

370
00:28:04,303 --> 00:28:04,968
Speaker 0: It's really good up.

371
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:06,399
Speaker 0: So there you go.

372
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:10,932
Speaker 1: We are hanging out at home trying to make stuff.

373
00:28:11,173 --> 00:28:12,519
Speaker 1: I hope this live streams working out.

374
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:22,980
Speaker 0: We're still tweaking the pipeline to be able to do geek nights remotely without interruptions And I know a lot less people are probably watching listening to geek nights because podcasting is way down.

375
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:27,400
Speaker 1: Yep, because no one's listening cuz they're at work doing work.

376
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,550
Speaker 1: That does not require the word part of their brain to interact.

377
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,580
Speaker 1: or they're commuting in a car or they're committing in a subway.

378
00:28:34,561 --> 00:28:40,443
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but if you're watching the live stream or you're hanging out with us like we're gonna keep we're gonna keep cranking out more content Bit by bit.

379
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:41,146
Speaker 1: just stay tuned.

380
00:28:41,568 --> 00:28:43,840
Speaker 1: I got some more RTMP stuff set up.

381
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,813
Speaker 1: I also got the teleprompter like fully set up and working with the new camera.

382
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:51,222
Speaker 1: So stop sparkle eight and stay tuned Mm-hmm.

383
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:52,867
Speaker 1: I don't know what it looks like Angie.

384
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,877
Speaker 0: Let's say geek night's downloads are on the decline for sure.

385
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:58,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay Whatever you log it in check.

386
00:28:59,421 --> 00:29:00,123
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

387
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:00,946
Speaker 1: Yeah makes sense.

388
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,617
Speaker 1: I mean I have not listened to a podcast in four weeks.

389
00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:05,400
Speaker 1: Not one.

390
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:09,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I have not listened to podcasts really at all either even podcast I like.

391
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:10,959
Speaker 1: I'm not listening to the matter of time.

392
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:18,849
Speaker 0: And the other thing is a lot of the podcast that I do listen to which are and Surprisingly, they're still finding a way to keep going.

393
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:21,277
Speaker 0: Like they found more things to say our sports podcasts.

394
00:29:21,739 --> 00:29:24,090
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I was like they found stuff to say.

395
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:24,291
Speaker 0: they're.

396
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:26,240
Speaker 0: they're all coming up with ideas and being creative.

397
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,400
Speaker 1: It's like some of the players I'm playing their own like video game versions of themselves and like doing stuff to twitch.

398
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,900
Speaker 0: So I'm just I'm talking about like sports journalists, right?

399
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:43,752
Speaker 0: It's like they're still coming up with ways to do content on the past on the future on all kinds of you know side stories Different angles things they would never waste time on before and it could be interesting.

400
00:29:44,234 --> 00:29:46,440
Speaker 0: but it's like there's no sports happening.

401
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,384
Speaker 0: Why am I right?

402
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:50,780
Speaker 0: It's like I have just those podcasts just piling up and I'm not listening to any of them.

403
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,753
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though someone's working hard and being creative to come up with them.

404
00:29:55,355 --> 00:29:58,503
Speaker 0: It's like well, I'm just not Not feeling it.

405
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:03,100
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's partly why we're not gonna double down and like make more episodes of geek nice.

406
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:10,000
Speaker 1: We're gonna keep making geek nice at the same pace, but we're gonna work on other projects where if we're stuck at home Anyway, we have space to do them.

407
00:30:10,261 --> 00:30:18,480
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk about the details of those projects yet because We are very much trying to not shit talk about things until we actually deliver at least one iteration of that thing.

408
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:30,677
Speaker 0: but I've also heard about the psychological phenomenon where for for some reason if you say you're gonna do something out loud you your Brain feels like you've done it and therefore you are less likely to actually do it.

409
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:31,560
Speaker 0: stupid rain.

410
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:32,404
Speaker 1: Why you do this to me?

411
00:30:32,424 --> 00:30:39,015
Speaker 0: It's like I. it conflicts with my intellectual Principle of wanting to be open with people and talk about.

412
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 0: you know Like what's going on and not keep secrets, right?

413
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,400
Speaker 0: Cuz I always come complain about companies like not saying what they're doing.

414
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,953
Speaker 0: It's like why not you just get people hype if you tell us what?

415
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:52,740
Speaker 1: if I right now and be like, hey I'm working hard to make an episode of geek guys presents utensil this weekend.

416
00:30:53,162 --> 00:30:59,185
Speaker 1: I actually am working on that but I don't know if I'll get to it this weekend cuz other stuff might come up and I even now feel pretty good.

417
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:03,740
Speaker 1: Like yeah, I just did something on that utensil that's been on hiatus forever, but I didn't do anything.

418
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,320
Speaker 1: I just said words and I see people in the chat are already excited about the fact that I mentioned the antenna thing.

419
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,385
Speaker 1: So there we go.

420
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:10,491
Speaker 0: There you go.

421
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:14,148
Speaker 0: I That's that many people in the chat were excited.

422
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:14,912
Speaker 0: one person person.

423
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:15,112
Speaker 0: Yeah.

424
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:24,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that is This day sealed the YouTube comments like at least twice a week Because my youtube channel gets like 20 ish thousand views a month.

425
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:30,666
Speaker 1: But at least once or twice a week some random video that is not anything to do the tenant We'll get a comment on it.

426
00:31:30,908 --> 00:31:33,000
Speaker 1: That is just like hey, what are you gonna start up the antenna show again?

427
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,140
Speaker 1: I'm really looking forward to the next episode.

428
00:31:35,421 --> 00:31:38,554
Speaker 1: Like people they're like that comment exists on almost all our videos.

429
00:31:38,574 --> 00:31:43,979
Speaker 1: It's Moderately annoying but I see why and I can look at the stats and even see where they're coming from.

430
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:48,900
Speaker 0: So I mean that's what happens to literally every creator who does more than one.

431
00:31:49,046 --> 00:31:51,308
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah How many people do we know who made a webcomic?

432
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:54,440
Speaker 1: are now rich and famous like they've made a million other things?

433
00:31:54,761 --> 00:32:01,540
Speaker 1: But to this day 20 years later randos come into their mentions asking about their first webcomic that they stopped doing a decade ago.

434
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:02,502
Speaker 0: Right.

435
00:32:02,562 --> 00:32:05,576
Speaker 0: Imagine if you're like the undertale guy and you do something else every.

436
00:32:05,596 --> 00:32:08,084
Speaker 0: all the comments are gonna be like I'm a gun under town to candidate right?

437
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:14,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know you you if you make a hit movie if what he dies I hope in the far future.

438
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:18,140
Speaker 1: There'll be a tombstone that just says the undertale people, right?

439
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,500
Speaker 0: If you're if you're if you're Patrick Stewart and you go you you were acting in a play some Shakespearean shit.

440
00:32:23,681 --> 00:32:24,123
Speaker 0: And you do.

441
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:25,129
Speaker 0: go to the press conference.

442
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:26,315
Speaker 0: Everyone asked about Star Trek, right?

443
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:32,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's the same shit that every famous person who does multiple different any creative person is famous.

444
00:32:32,938 --> 00:32:33,560
Speaker 1: Well, there's two guys.

445
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,769
Speaker 1: There's the people always aware of the thing.

446
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:37,497
Speaker 1: They know you about like people see Michael Jordan.

447
00:32:37,517 --> 00:32:38,200
Speaker 1: They ask about the Bulls.

448
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,298
Speaker 1: They don't ask about like any other aspect of his career.

449
00:32:40,681 --> 00:32:43,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one asked him about being the owner of you know, the Hornets or whatever.

450
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:43,881
Speaker 1: You know.

451
00:32:43,901 --> 00:32:45,187
Speaker 1: who does those questions?

452
00:32:45,408 --> 00:32:47,920
Speaker 1: people like you me and Daryl Surratt, right?

453
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:52,130
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, we're working on stuff.

454
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:54,460
Speaker 1: I am gonna try to work on the antenna thing like stay tuned.

455
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:58,288
Speaker 0: I'm Basically the you 10 a channel, right?

456
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:01,179
Speaker 0: So if you put anything else on there people like hey, where's you 10 a head?

457
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,541
Speaker 1: Yep, there that the you 10 a community is going strong, but it is definitely not growing Mm-hmm.

458
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,748
Speaker 1: So let's just get right into it.

459
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,440
Speaker 1: You can find all their stuff on the internet, but we're taught we watch some anime.

460
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:14,180
Speaker 1: Uh, we're be stars.

461
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,800
Speaker 1: Way back when the manga was first coming out in Japan and wasn't even officially released anywhere like in the u.s.

462
00:33:21,462 --> 00:33:30,046
Speaker 1: There were people in our forum who were posting screenshots of it like cat screen caps of it from the digital bootleg fans Up or fan translations.

463
00:33:30,066 --> 00:33:33,219
Speaker 1: They were reading because it was that good and they were like that obsessed with it.

464
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:47,880
Speaker 0: Yeah This is definitely a title manga anime wise that I heard about and saw about coming way in advance like it was like it was hot and on fire when It was a manga right people were all over it and then Netflix grabbed it, right?

465
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,687
Speaker 0: So they call it a Netflix original but like.

466
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:50,590
Speaker 0: is it really original?

467
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:57,333
Speaker 0: you didn't write it like, you know for the Dracula thing It's like, you know, Netflix paid for it to be created from nothing, right?

468
00:33:57,413 --> 00:33:59,400
Speaker 0: I guess they didn't create Castlevania itself.

469
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:01,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's original Castlevania story.

470
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:02,609
Speaker 0: It's not an adaptation.

471
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:09,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it is this superficially Castlevania 3 but Right, like this is not an adaptation.

472
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:13,174
Speaker 0: This is Literally, I mean this is an adaptation.

473
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:14,620
Speaker 1: It's literally not to say where are you going?

474
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:16,067
Speaker 0: Manga the mom.

475
00:34:16,107 --> 00:34:16,328
Speaker 0: I don't.

476
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:18,960
Speaker 0: yeah, the manga is turned into an anime straight.

477
00:34:19,321 --> 00:34:20,726
Speaker 0: I don't know what changes their work?

478
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:24,219
Speaker 0: as I haven't read the manga, but I can't imagine that they were major changes.

479
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:26,699
Speaker 0: It definitely feels like manga, right?

480
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:44,746
Speaker 1: But basically there was a long slow burn where like everywhere I look in our forum on Twitter There was this handful of people that was slowly growing that were obsessed with this manga that wasn't out in the US yet And there's so much media out these days that even if I see something like that I tend to just wait for an official release.

481
00:34:45,329 --> 00:34:46,433
Speaker 0: Well, also I just kept seeing.

482
00:34:46,572 --> 00:34:48,340
Speaker 0: really I just kept seeing the imagery, right?

483
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,116
Speaker 0: I kept seeing the imagery of this, you know wolf dude and this bunny girl.

484
00:34:53,255 --> 00:35:05,651
Speaker 0: All right, and they all Those are the three people I see and I could tell that okay, whatever this is from is clearly Dark, right furry and sexual in some way.

485
00:35:05,711 --> 00:35:06,353
Speaker 0: Whatever it is.

486
00:35:06,373 --> 00:35:15,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would describe describe the vibe I got as Psychosexual thriller with anthropomorphic characters, right and maybe it has some sort of horror element that I didn't know, right?

487
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:25,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's just the vibe I got from all this artwork and images I saw around You know and it was a Netflix I guess original right and that Netflix paid an

488
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,981
Speaker 1: OAN instead of an OAV I

489
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:33,291
Speaker 0: guess you know Netflix said, okay well we'll license that manga and we will pay for a production of an anime based on that manga.

490
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:40,041
Speaker 0: and the first season 12 episodes is out and I watched a few and then because they had nothing else to do I watched all 12.

491
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:40,263
Speaker 0: Yep,

492
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:51,399
Speaker 1: we won't spoil anything at first but we'll spoil a few things toward the end of the episode because I want to talk about a few scenes that I thought were Particularly good, but we'll avoid spoiling stuff because I want to review it because not everyone's seen it yet first,

493
00:35:51,419 --> 00:35:51,600
Speaker 0: right?

494
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,203
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

495
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:58,695
Speaker 0: it wasn't one of those things Where it was so good, like I was gripped and had to watch every episode right.

496
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,060
Speaker 0: if I was me it was that.

497
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:03,720
Speaker 1: Okay, I was like I could not wait to watch the next episode.

498
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:09,399
Speaker 0: If I wasn't stuck at home, I don't know if I would have watched every episode have been a little borderline, right?

499
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,792
Speaker 0: But it was definitely good enough for me to not stop watching it.

500
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,820
Speaker 0: It's not like I went it's not like I went.

501
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,893
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm gonna watch something else.

502
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:17,319
Speaker 0: This is me.

503
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:18,686
Speaker 1: I guess the way I'd pitch it like.

504
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:20,233
Speaker 1: what the deal with it is that one.

505
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:23,065
Speaker 1: it's very high production value Like the animation is phenomenal.

506
00:36:23,125 --> 00:36:24,811
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's 3d, but it looks great.

507
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:25,634
Speaker 0: Right?

508
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:31,200
Speaker 0: So animation wise it's obvious They're using you know, fully CG animated characters, right?

509
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,469
Speaker 0: But you know, there's some anime or animations that are.

510
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:36,153
Speaker 0: you know Toy Story like.

511
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,978
Speaker 0: yeah, this is 3d and you know, it's 3d.

512
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like or the new ghost.

513
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:41,629
Speaker 1: That's what we're doing.

514
00:36:41,669 --> 00:36:43,495
Speaker 1: We will not be reviewing on gig nights.

515
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:43,976
Speaker 1: Probably.

516
00:36:43,996 --> 00:36:45,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably not.

517
00:36:46,342 --> 00:36:46,864
Speaker 0: But Israel.

518
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:49,819
Speaker 0: it goes in the shells relevant to this to be stars in a small way.

519
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,436
Speaker 0: The it's also not one of those ones.

520
00:36:53,476 --> 00:37:07,325
Speaker 0: We're okay It's a 2d anime, but we're using the computer to help us out right like, you know every 2d anime these days pretty much every single 2d animate 2d anime these days is Animated on a computer digitally.

521
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:08,027
Speaker 0: It's just.

522
00:37:08,047 --> 00:37:10,614
Speaker 0: they're using 2d animation techniques and not 3d ones.

523
00:37:10,694 --> 00:37:16,779
Speaker 0: or maybe they are using some 3d ones Like maybe like a. so Ken has you know, you can see this some 3d going on, right?

524
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:31,502
Speaker 0: But what you get here in be stars is clearly 3d, right Like Toy Story, it's fucking 3d CG animated anime series, but I don't know, you know the shading or whatever They're doing.

525
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:36,879
Speaker 0: Okay, let the movement do it rarely it it rarely looks like it, right?

526
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,829
Speaker 1: Well, even though it's more than it's.

527
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:45,980
Speaker 1: the characters are like Hyper-expressive and a very subtle movements and very like everything's very subtle and well done.

528
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:47,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you.

529
00:37:48,346 --> 00:38:04,299
Speaker 0: it's like usually when you're watching one of those 3d animated series or if you see a still image from one It's like, you know, it's right you get still a lot of stills from be stars like random ones And some of them you'd be able to tell and a lot of them you wouldn't.

530
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:24,210
Speaker 0: yeah, and usually usually the times I can tell the most are when like people are walking and their feet are in the scene and Sometimes like the way the clothing will move Right and those sorts of things will sort of give it away or distract your eye a little bit, you know I saw some like pixelation types of things going around.

531
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:26,999
Speaker 0: you're like, you know the bottom of someone's pants and those sort of.

532
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:27,966
Speaker 0: you know Action scenes.

533
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,257
Speaker 0: you can sort of tell a little bit.

534
00:38:31,261 --> 00:38:36,120
Speaker 0: But you know for the most part it's like, you know, it's it's a it's mostly a talking heads kind of show.

535
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:37,684
Speaker 1: Yeah like what's it really about?

536
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:40,094
Speaker 1: like if you follow the show it almost goes through a progression of like.

537
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:47,238
Speaker 1: it's about a lot of different things and It evokes a lot of like memories of other shows but in very like.

538
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:47,800
Speaker 1: well, we'll get into it.

539
00:38:47,800 --> 00:39:00,820
Speaker 1: So first it's kind of just a school drama literally about a bunch of kids in the drama club in a private school like it's ostensibly about that and that's where the story starts and That's where a lot of just the action happens.

540
00:39:01,201 --> 00:39:06,070
Speaker 1: Like there's just a bunch of people and they're in this drama club and one of their classmates got murdered and there's a story around that.

541
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:07,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

542
00:39:07,963 --> 00:39:13,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way that story is told and the way it's framed because it's kind of an isolated private school.

543
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,315
Speaker 1: There's definitely a you're where you're in the school or you're outside of the school and these are very different worlds.

544
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,080
Speaker 0: very antenna situation.

545
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,669
Speaker 1: It's utenna both in the way It's portrayed like their parents aren't really present.

546
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:26,693
Speaker 1: The kids are on their own.

547
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:32,439
Speaker 1: The student council is capitalized as capitalized C matters capital M.

548
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:34,868
Speaker 0: There wasn't really a student council.

549
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:38,360
Speaker 0: Well, there's almost like the drama club is the student to student council?

550
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,805
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the drama club is basically the student council because Lewis is in charge of it and is Terrifyingly powerful dear.

551
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:48,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that all bleeds into real-world politics a little bit.

552
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,593
Speaker 1: It gets a little complicated but the weight some scenes are shot to like.

553
00:39:51,955 --> 00:39:53,040
Speaker 1: it'll do that do ten a thing.

554
00:39:53,645 --> 00:39:55,640
Speaker 1: Background characters just have blank faces.

555
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,643
Speaker 1: It'll like.

556
00:39:56,923 --> 00:39:58,046
Speaker 1: it'll really do.

557
00:39:58,107 --> 00:40:06,551
Speaker 1: the kinds of artistry that utenna does to make points to focus your attention To like drive the allegory of what's happening in a scene.

558
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,015
Speaker 1: It doesn't even has.

559
00:40:08,096 --> 00:40:12,230
Speaker 0: it even has a crazy Random tangent right about eggs.

560
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:15,040
Speaker 1: It does in fact have the nanami tangent with that.

561
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:20,179
Speaker 0: As soon as that happened I was like, that's the egg.

562
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:21,197
Speaker 0: There it is.

563
00:40:21,722 --> 00:40:32,040
Speaker 1: But it also does the thing that utenna does that princess tutu Does where there is a play that they are performing in the first part of the show and they perform it twice.

564
00:40:32,782 --> 00:40:38,800
Speaker 1: But what is happening in the play is definite allegory to what is happening in the show.

565
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:44,740
Speaker 1: No, yeah, and what happens in the play affects the real world directly.

566
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:49,152
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, it's a lot of these antenna aspects going on.

567
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,480
Speaker 1: but then fast forward a little further watch more of the show.

568
00:40:52,328 --> 00:40:57,344
Speaker 1: It's also about this psychosexual tension between Predators and prey.

569
00:40:57,404 --> 00:41:04,104
Speaker 1: it's almost like a world where vampires live alongside regular humans and people get murdered kind of all the time in Society.

570
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:05,713
Speaker 1: just kind of agrees.

571
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,927
Speaker 1: That's Just happening.

572
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:08,894
Speaker 1: It doesn't really work.

573
00:41:08,914 --> 00:41:09,679
Speaker 0: Well, it's what it is.

574
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,589
Speaker 0: It's it's like utenna and to where you know You know the surface thing going on.

575
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:17,660
Speaker 0: and then it's like actually there's all kinds of dark shit going on.

576
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:21,960
Speaker 0: People keep it hush-hush or it's hidden from you and it's sort of like a terrible secretive space.

577
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,562
Speaker 0: but it's not.

578
00:41:22,642 --> 00:41:29,599
Speaker 1: but it gets into like all these ideas of like oppressor versus oppressed and predatory classes versus like predated upon classes.

579
00:41:30,664 --> 00:41:32,016
Speaker 0: Well, you think it's a class thing.

580
00:41:32,137 --> 00:41:34,846
Speaker 1: I think The thing is it does not map.

581
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:35,829
Speaker 1: This is the most important thing.

582
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:39,944
Speaker 1: It does not map one-to-one to real-world Oppressions.

583
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,900
Speaker 1: it is a complex map of its own devising.

584
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:47,980
Speaker 0: Well, I think what more than a class thing, right because everything's a class there.

585
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:52,939
Speaker 0: I think what it's really about is, you know, you have a society, right?

586
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:59,340
Speaker 0: And in human society that we live in right people have are still animals, right?

587
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,228
Speaker 0: A human being is an animal right and we still have.

588
00:42:02,248 --> 00:42:06,380
Speaker 0: this is like, you know, super old Freudian nonsense, right?

589
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:11,920
Speaker 0: You know, you still have these animal instincts that you have because you're a human being who is an animal.

590
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:22,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and oftentimes those animal instincts those you know urges your lizard brain has right are Contrary to the rules and and practices of society.

591
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:32,740
Speaker 1: Yeah Your conscious brain wants to follow but at the same time some of those things May or may not be innate or natural and some of those things may just be created by society and perception.

592
00:42:33,543 --> 00:42:52,631
Speaker 0: Sure, but the point is is that by making a show in which everyone is Literally a furry animal of some kind humanoid, you know Anthropomorphic animal right and they're all mixed up together right all these different animals are forced to live together peacefully Right and they have to press

593
00:42:52,691 --> 00:42:53,153
Speaker 1: making they have

594
00:42:53,193 --> 00:42:54,840
Speaker 0: to repress their instincts.

595
00:42:55,482 --> 00:43:00,880
Speaker 0: Right as animals to eat each other or do whatever their animal thing is, right?

596
00:43:01,802 --> 00:43:03,447
Speaker 0: To live peacefully together.

597
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:11,840
Speaker 0: because normally right there, you know kramarti the rabbit in the lion's den That's some fucking rabbit that doesn't get eaten in the lion.

598
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:17,880
Speaker 0: But I guess at the same time that but look at that from the lion's perspective That's some fucking lion that doesn't eat a rabbit.

599
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:22,094
Speaker 1: But that structure lets it explore these really interesting issues.

600
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:28,846
Speaker 1: because in the world of these stars Some of these instincts are real physical manifestations Like you can't.

601
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:33,106
Speaker 1: the predator drive is like legit real It's like you can't.

602
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:36,559
Speaker 1: the show will not argue that there is a like social construct around that.

603
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:39,319
Speaker 0: But I mean, it's real for a real wolf too in the woods.

604
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:44,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm hungry wolf's gonna eat you but in the show is this so you've got a human s character.

605
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:45,570
Speaker 1: who has you know?

606
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:46,703
Speaker 1: Who is sentient?

607
00:43:47,105 --> 00:43:49,980
Speaker 1: who has these real drives but simultaneously?

608
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:58,420
Speaker 1: some of the things that are going on with what these characters feel is either performative or Clearly is driven by society.

609
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:11,883
Speaker 1: So it starts mixing up gender roles predator prey roles and just societal roles together and because they don't map one-to-one with the real World it ends up letting you explore things that we don't have real world analogies for Right.

610
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:25,651
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's it's just by combined, you know, the just bringing the animal, you know Metaphor on top of humanity right just makes it way more complicated But also way more sort of obvious invisible, right.

611
00:44:25,931 --> 00:44:29,040
Speaker 0: and it especially applies when you look at like the messaging around.

612
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:32,220
Speaker 0: You know vegetarian veganism, right?

613
00:44:32,861 --> 00:44:36,100
Speaker 0: You know the society makes it so no one's allowed to eat any meats.

614
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:41,436
Speaker 0: Right because meat is someone else even though there were insects that were not sentient.

615
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:42,840
Speaker 0: I just want to point that out.

616
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:43,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll just let that be.

617
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:45,419
Speaker 1: no bugs That's a Pokemon question.

618
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,556
Speaker 0: There's mammals and there's birds and that and all of it all other animals are not.

619
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:51,760
Speaker 0: Oh, is there a lizard person?

620
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:52,642
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

621
00:44:52,662 --> 00:44:57,136
Speaker 0: I don't remember if there's a lizard person, but there's definitely mammals and birds.

622
00:44:57,156 --> 00:45:02,839
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's anything else regardless But there's no monkeys.

623
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:05,949
Speaker 1: Maybe there is me where I'm saying, I don't know.

624
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,389
Speaker 1: but like those look at the main regardless To see where I'm getting at this with is not having a one-to-one mapping.

625
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:20,560
Speaker 1: So we've got the main character is this shy Quiet wolf guy who's just full of teen angst like he's just an angsty teenager and that's his main thing.

626
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:29,598
Speaker 0: He has a real predator drive Where he's a big giant powerful scary wolf and he loses control of himself and almost eats a classmate.

627
00:45:29,758 --> 00:45:30,562
Speaker 1: like that happened Right.

628
00:45:30,582 --> 00:45:30,906
Speaker 1: He's really.

629
00:45:31,047 --> 00:45:32,220
Speaker 0: he's trying not to write.

630
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:32,842
Speaker 0: It's like he doesn't.

631
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:38,220
Speaker 0: you know his conscious brain doesn't want to but his animal instinct is I'm a big scary wolf gonna blow your house.

632
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:52,260
Speaker 1: But simultaneously it gets more complicated because there's another wolf in the show who is a female wolf who expresses and feels that Instinct very differently and acts very differently even though she may be feeling very similar thing.

633
00:45:52,340 --> 00:46:00,524
Speaker 1: Like the two characters despite both being wolves have very different problems to solve approach them very different ways and perceive themselves in the world Around them differently.

634
00:46:00,805 --> 00:46:13,650
Speaker 1: So already it's not as simple as a wolves feel this pressure But but also a lot of the other predators have this machismo and this bravado and they fight with each other in ways that this Angsty wolf does not want to.

635
00:46:13,731 --> 00:46:15,360
Speaker 1: he's not interested in all this nonsense.

636
00:46:15,821 --> 00:46:22,022
Speaker 1: He almost doesn't want to be the what he doesn't want to fill the role that society says predators should fill Right.

637
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:22,925
Speaker 0: Well his body does.

638
00:46:22,945 --> 00:46:23,708
Speaker 0: his body does.

639
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,711
Speaker 1: his mind is conscious.

640
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,115
Speaker 0: his conscious brain does not.

641
00:46:26,136 --> 00:46:28,720
Speaker 0: his conscious brain wants to be like a Nice guy hanging out in society.

642
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,365
Speaker 0: Everyone gets along peacefully and his body sometimes doesn't let him because it's a big scary wolf body and it almost gets into.

643
00:46:34,405 --> 00:46:36,274
Speaker 1: it's not the feminine mystique, but it's a similar.

644
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:46,609
Speaker 1: that idea of Some of the things he feels are intrinsic and real to his physical form and some of the things he feels are societal roles that he rejects and are not intrinsic to him.

645
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:53,920
Speaker 1: and the show does a really good job of exploring the interplay between These two ideas while everything develops, right?

646
00:46:54,021 --> 00:46:56,220
Speaker 0: And it's not a it's you know.

647
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,331
Speaker 0: I don't know if the dysphoria really applies because it's not like.

648
00:46:59,632 --> 00:47:02,040
Speaker 0: he doesn't want to be a wolf or he feels like he's not.

649
00:47:02,462 --> 00:47:07,039
Speaker 1: But he doesn't want to be like the jock wolf who's fighting with everyone for fun like that other right?

650
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:07,782
Speaker 0: exactly He's not.

651
00:47:07,822 --> 00:47:09,230
Speaker 0: he's not like I'm not a wolf.

652
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:10,618
Speaker 0: I'm actually something else.

653
00:47:10,798 --> 00:47:12,924
Speaker 1: He's like Not all wolves have to be.

654
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:17,718
Speaker 0: he just doesn't like some of the baggage that comes along with being what he is.

655
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:21,129
Speaker 1: Yep, right And then you've got the deer guy.

656
00:47:21,149 --> 00:47:32,539
Speaker 1: if you see photos of this guy Lewis who's another one of the main characters he is a prey animal who is both jealous of and Fearful of the power that predators have like the raw physical power.

657
00:47:33,683 --> 00:47:39,968
Speaker 1: and there is there is a an extreme psychosexual tension between him and Legos.

658
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:41,766
Speaker 0: everybody Every single.

659
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:43,960
Speaker 1: what between everybody and everybody?

660
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:53,224
Speaker 1: Sure, if I had to describe the show in one sentence these animals in school have psychosexual tension with every other animal in the school Right.

661
00:47:53,565 --> 00:47:57,020
Speaker 0: Oh what I was saying about the the vegetarian vegan thing, right?

662
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:08,780
Speaker 0: It's like, you know in the real world, you know, it's a it's a difficult topic to discuss with people Right because it's like, you know, clearly there's that element of you know, you know, there's some natural aspect.

663
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:16,015
Speaker 0: It's like yeah lions just eat other animals It's just what they do right and we don't apply a moral thing to that right.

664
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:22,754
Speaker 0: but humans we know better Right, and it's like yeah raising all these cows right destroys the environment, right?

665
00:48:22,795 --> 00:48:24,640
Speaker 0: It's we're treating some of the animals badly.

666
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,760
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of other things going on, but also we're smarter than the cow.

667
00:48:29,001 --> 00:48:29,543
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

668
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:32,817
Speaker 0: So here by turning on its head a little bit.

669
00:48:32,878 --> 00:48:36,115
Speaker 0: It's like, okay Well animals are actual, you know, it's not like in the.

670
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:41,380
Speaker 0: in the real world We debate like how you know, is it okay to eat the cow because it's not so smart, right?

671
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,563
Speaker 0: Would you eat another person?

672
00:48:42,844 --> 00:48:44,329
Speaker 0: No, right here.

673
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:44,650
Speaker 0: It's like.

674
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,580
Speaker 0: well the cow is as smart as you and you're a lion.

675
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,145
Speaker 0: It was also smart, right?

676
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:51,271
Speaker 0: You're a lion person and a cow person.

677
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:54,340
Speaker 0: Is it okay for that lion person to eat a cow person?

678
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,403
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

679
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:57,490
Speaker 1: or and you want to see how dark the show gets.

680
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,599
Speaker 1: a question that might be asked even in the show is is it?

681
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:04,514
Speaker 1: Allowable for a cow person to sell themselves to be eaten.

682
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:05,839
Speaker 1: Is that okay?

683
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,570
Speaker 0: Right and you basically get all it's like well now it's.

684
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:12,320
Speaker 0: now it's tough right you still have that same thing where it's like.

685
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's only natural for the lion to eat the eat the wildebeest or whatever it is the light, right?

686
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:22,535
Speaker 0: But when they're both have human intelligence, it's like oh, it's not okay.

687
00:49:22,635 --> 00:49:24,300
Speaker 0: Okay, it's not okay you decided.

688
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,813
Speaker 0: But now the lion is rip.

689
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:27,859
Speaker 0: What's he gonna eat?

690
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:34,100
Speaker 0: Okay, and now the Lions all all messed up inside right the strong animals, right?

691
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,860
Speaker 0: I think the carnivorous animals, you know, they're repressing their these instincts, right?

692
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,778
Speaker 0: and they have difficult lives even though they're powerful in society.

693
00:49:42,798 --> 00:49:55,307
Speaker 0: and The prey animals right they're sort of like, okay, right we can you know They're always afraid right of these carnivorous animals Even if they don't actually get eaten, although sometimes they do.

694
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:56,611
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

695
00:49:56,651 --> 00:50:06,280
Speaker 0: So they're sort of repressed in society, you know, societally Even though there are natural instincts on the inside of them They don't have to repress those in any way.

696
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,263
Speaker 0: And then it matters.

697
00:50:07,403 --> 00:50:11,877
Speaker 1: but there's on top of all of that because the third main character the rabbit girl.

698
00:50:12,178 --> 00:50:13,642
Speaker 1: She's a small She's a dwarf rabbit.

699
00:50:13,682 --> 00:50:17,209
Speaker 1: She's like the weakest of the weak physically, but yeah, she's not.

700
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:25,626
Speaker 0: It's like smaller than all the other rabbits.

701
00:50:25,747 --> 00:50:29,377
Speaker 1: and you see all these dynamics of like the larger rabbits bully her.

702
00:50:29,698 --> 00:50:34,065
Speaker 1: she is Definitely shamed for being sexually promiscuous Right.

703
00:50:34,085 --> 00:50:35,954
Speaker 0: She's all alone in the gardening club.

704
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:37,280
Speaker 0: She's the only member of the gardening.

705
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:46,226
Speaker 1: Her own reality as a prey animal and her complicated relationships with the nature of predators around her But also with other prey animals around her.

706
00:50:46,548 --> 00:50:52,828
Speaker 1: she does not live up to the societal expectations of her Her animal nature or her gender.

707
00:50:53,530 --> 00:51:05,530
Speaker 0: right but like everyone else she still has problems You know with the conflict between what her body will do on its own because it's a rabbit body and that's it does what it Does versus what her brain wants to do, right?

708
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll see her behave drastically differently, right?

709
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:19,592
Speaker 0: It's like when she has, you know Conscious control over the things she says and does like she's all badass and whatever and she stands up to a certain unnamed Character in episode near the end.

710
00:51:19,652 --> 00:51:20,657
Speaker 0: something right?

711
00:51:20,698 --> 00:51:28,460
Speaker 0: Yeah Exactly, but then sometimes like her body will just do something like run away, which is you know, like a rabbit and hi

712
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:29,885
Speaker 1: And

713
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:31,960
Speaker 0: cower, which is she characteristic

714
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,840
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, like her foot keeps moving uncontrollably

715
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:39,479
Speaker 0: Yep, because her body is scared because it's a big bad wolf right in front of her.

716
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:44,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, her leg keeps trying to run away even though she has no desire to run away.

717
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:47,140
Speaker 0: She's just chillin and eating nice lunch with somebody.

718
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:53,236
Speaker 1: So all of that alone can make a pretty compelling like thrillers set in a high school like.

719
00:51:53,497 --> 00:51:54,199
Speaker 1: that's enough, right?

720
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:00,700
Speaker 0: And there's so many different things, you know, you can you can say with that setup, you know about human society.

721
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make you can make a call like a hundred episode series just with that.

722
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:18,174
Speaker 1: But that kind of just sets the stage for what the show seems to really be about because even in this first season of the anime by episode 9 The school politics are intersecting with the real-world politics.

723
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:37,164
Speaker 1: the The Pat like the deers path Lewis's path through being the head of this drama club and getting out of the school is like a political Path where he is working with the mayor who is a lion who is like legit connected to the Mafia and that matters Directly in the show pretty early on Mm-hmm.

724
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:41,492
Speaker 1: Well, and then that starts getting into this intro It's the Yagas, it's not the Mafia.

725
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:43,000
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, it's the Yagas the cry.

726
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,740
Speaker 1: It's well the Shishi gumi in particular one criminal organization.

727
00:52:47,415 --> 00:52:58,180
Speaker 1: Yeah But all of that starts happening and the show starts to get a little broader in scope that it's not just gonna be about These angsty teenagers dealing with this society.

728
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:07,019
Speaker 1: It's starting to show this class separations of the school is almost Literally a fantasy world compared to the real world outside it.

729
00:53:07,842 --> 00:53:09,628
Speaker 1: Right much like a new final right.

730
00:53:09,849 --> 00:53:13,220
Speaker 0: and the final thing is the title of the show which is be stars, right?

731
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,753
Speaker 1: It's a how many times does an anime say the name of the anime in the show?

732
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:18,540
Speaker 1: and it is not terrible, right?

733
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:27,507
Speaker 0: So during the show several times it comes up that some animals are you know, some people whatever they want to call them are Become somehow.

734
00:53:27,949 --> 00:53:30,500
Speaker 0: become the be star or be stars, right?

735
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,792
Speaker 0: You don't know how many there are one at a time.

736
00:53:33,154 --> 00:53:33,797
Speaker 0: Who's the current?

737
00:53:33,817 --> 00:53:34,320
Speaker 0: be star?

738
00:53:34,721 --> 00:53:37,167
Speaker 1: Not revealed a lot about it.

739
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:38,731
Speaker 1: it evokes for me.

740
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:41,980
Speaker 1: even in utana the lights have the ring go into the castle.

741
00:53:42,061 --> 00:53:42,785
Speaker 1: Well, what does that mean?

742
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:44,920
Speaker 0: I don't know but everybody what does it mean to be the Rose?

743
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:45,302
Speaker 0: I want to.

744
00:53:45,342 --> 00:53:46,651
Speaker 0: I want to win the Rose bride.

745
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:46,974
Speaker 0: It's like.

746
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:47,860
Speaker 0: that's the same idea.

747
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,960
Speaker 0: It's like this some of the people want to become the be star or be stars.

748
00:53:53,321 --> 00:53:55,788
Speaker 0: There's some unknown process by which you become it.

749
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,439
Speaker 0: There is some unknown thing you gain by being it.

750
00:53:59,901 --> 00:54:02,650
Speaker 0: Don't know who is it and it appears that what you don't know.

751
00:54:02,730 --> 00:54:08,540
Speaker 1: when real power like that's a very important point kind of like In utana, the characters are seeking real power.

752
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:14,480
Speaker 1: Not the power always in this fancy world but power over the real world to right some wrong or fight some injustice.

753
00:54:15,123 --> 00:54:19,582
Speaker 0: All we know is that you can become the be star somehow You.

754
00:54:19,863 --> 00:54:28,566
Speaker 0: the path to becoming it involves being popular and or powerful or well liked and making Horrible deals with bad people.

755
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:35,270
Speaker 1: because that's what adults do outside of the fantasy world of the school right doing underhanded things Possibly to get ahead.

756
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:36,839
Speaker 0: It's it's not entirely clear.

757
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:49,238
Speaker 0: But what is clear is that like yeah, you can see that you know the main event of the show Which isn't addressed in season one at all, you know other than showing you that it's sort of on the horizon is you know?

758
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:54,780
Speaker 0: The battle to see who will become the be star and all that entails.

759
00:54:55,942 --> 00:55:08,519
Speaker 0: But I think it's somewhat transparent right that there are some characters who were clearly set up and are actively a Like frontrunners for becoming be star and be actively trying well

760
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:15,260
Speaker 1: Remember the all that is their goal are in a clearly extremely expensive like private special school

761
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:39,140
Speaker 0: Right, but I mean it's a cliche that you know in a lot of stories to have something like this where you see some characters Who are trying to become the be star or a be star and are also a just feel like they're close to it like yeah They're probably in the lead or whatever it is But you just know that the unexpected character who isn't even trying who's like the main character will be the one right?

762
00:55:39,321 --> 00:55:40,010
Speaker 0: It's the same as like.

763
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:47,220
Speaker 0: oh, yeah The the kid in the class who is obviously the main character of the show, but isn't as strong fast or smart.

764
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:50,090
Speaker 0: They're the magical person right you know.

765
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:51,114
Speaker 0: that's how it's gonna be.

766
00:55:51,174 --> 00:55:57,586
Speaker 0: that's the cliche of cliches And I would be very surprised if the show did not Adhere to that cliche.

767
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:04,748
Speaker 0: if it made if one of the frontrunners was the one to become the be star Or be whatever I would be quite surprised.

768
00:56:04,868 --> 00:56:08,500
Speaker 1: or will it focus more on what I foresee this was very happening.

769
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,678
Speaker 1: more is it focusing on how much of your principle do you sacrifice to get that real power and become the be star?

770
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:16,436
Speaker 1: and Was it worth it?

771
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,700
Speaker 0: Right and you know some of the characters say ask some interesting questions that are never answered.

772
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:22,644
Speaker 0: Like he's like.

773
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:24,672
Speaker 0: why do we have be stars in this world?

774
00:56:24,753 --> 00:56:25,275
Speaker 0: Why right?

775
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:25,656
Speaker 0: It's like.

776
00:56:25,897 --> 00:56:26,480
Speaker 0: it's like what?

777
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:26,921
Speaker 0: It's like.

778
00:56:26,941 --> 00:56:28,046
Speaker 0: I don't even know what the be star is.

779
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:29,110
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean anything to me.

780
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:37,400
Speaker 1: or when you know the the primary Arc of the end of the first season where a character gets kidnapped and the Yakuza get involved and there's trouble.

781
00:56:37,863 --> 00:56:46,486
Speaker 1: There's a scene between one character and the mayor Where the mayor sort of reveals some dark shit about the world like open yep And like.

782
00:56:46,546 --> 00:56:48,300
Speaker 1: this is the price of being of power.

783
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:51,935
Speaker 1: Do you not want this power like are you gonna mayor's a mayor?

784
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:53,020
Speaker 0: the mayor is not a be star.

785
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:56,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the mayor has power, but the mayor is not that power.

786
00:56:56,694 --> 00:57:01,825
Speaker 0: that power is special And if there are be stars out there It's like where the hell are they?

787
00:57:01,845 --> 00:57:03,290
Speaker 0: how can they're not doing anything about it?

788
00:57:03,992 --> 00:57:06,360
Speaker 0: and also how real if they even have that power.

789
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:14,027
Speaker 1: it's very clear that a big theme in the show is - is also going to be as it goes on how real is the peaceful facade of this society?

790
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:30,026
Speaker 1: because it's increasingly clear especially after you get to episode 9 that the Coexistence of predator and prey in this universe is not at all peaceful and is not fucking working, and there's also lots of Instances of segregation around.

791
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:37,147
Speaker 1: yes, and the segregation is along racial lines gender lines class lines And other lines to be determined.

792
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:38,371
Speaker 0: It's it's not sacred.

793
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:40,900
Speaker 0: It's not like extreme apartheid right?

794
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:43,390
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you're living next to each other right?

795
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:50,953
Speaker 0: we see wealthy and powerful Animals of all species right a lot of species stick together.

796
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:57,949
Speaker 0: there does seem to be some amount of Prejudice against interspecies relationships.

797
00:57:58,049 --> 00:58:01,118
Speaker 0: yup there seems to be you know these sorts of things.

798
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:03,002
Speaker 0: so It's like.

799
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:03,745
Speaker 0: it's there right.

800
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:04,748
Speaker 0: It's like.

801
00:58:04,788 --> 00:58:08,220
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, this school is special because it has carnivores and herbivores together.

802
00:58:08,361 --> 00:58:11,475
Speaker 0: Oh, so other schools don't other schools like a carnivore only school.

803
00:58:11,737 --> 00:58:14,048
Speaker 1: It's one of those things The advice I give you.

804
00:58:14,068 --> 00:58:19,219
Speaker 1: I don't think we're gonna do like a nutenna style like Tear-down of the show because I just don't have the energy right now.

805
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:20,419
Speaker 1: I got other things to finish.

806
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:33,495
Speaker 1: But this show will definitely when you as you watch it think about what questions get raised by the show But don't get answered by the show and think a lot about what doesn't get talked about.

807
00:58:34,338 --> 00:58:36,558
Speaker 0: I think that's yeah It's definitely a show.

808
00:58:37,162 --> 00:58:49,220
Speaker 0: I think that's actually maybe a flaw in the show is at least so far season one is that it's really great And asking questions and showing sort of a both sides II kind of thing right, but not having an opinion.

809
00:58:49,982 --> 00:58:53,632
Speaker 0: Well, I think it doesn't really come out and say what like what it believes.

810
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:59,299
Speaker 0: It's just like oh look at this that makes you Think huh well, I think it's too soon You think about that cuz right now.

811
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:08,079
Speaker 1: It's all the all those questions are really just being raised in the course of following these angsty Teenagers trying to navigate this possibly fucked up world.

812
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:15,371
Speaker 1: So the primary focus of the show is so far as what we've seen is really on How do these three characters navigate this world?

813
00:59:15,673 --> 00:59:17,100
Speaker 1: can they even change this world?

814
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,226
Speaker 0: So season two on Netflix is definitely coming.

815
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:22,092
Speaker 0: I don't know how many Netflix seasons.

816
00:59:22,132 --> 00:59:29,880
Speaker 0: They'll make but I wonder it was crazy popular Sure, but would it be better to wait for season two or would it be better to?

817
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:35,524
Speaker 0: Abandoned Netflix and read the manga because you know the manga is way ahead of Netflix So far.

818
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:43,954
Speaker 1: planning to just watch the show because the thing one thing that struck me about the show from a reviewing standpoint is that Almost every episode just when I thought okay.

819
00:59:43,995 --> 00:59:51,248
Speaker 1: I see where this is going something would escalate way faster than I expected or Something would happen that I did not expect at all.

820
00:59:51,328 --> 00:59:53,195
Speaker 1: the show would swerve into a direction that I would.

821
00:59:53,496 --> 01:00:05,776
Speaker 1: I did not anticipate the Sanctuary esque thing that happens in episode 9 Like at all and those more and there's a lot of shocking moments that have a lot of impacts.

822
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:07,782
Speaker 1: like the anime portrays them really Well.

823
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:08,685
Speaker 1: things like.

824
01:00:08,725 --> 01:00:14,409
Speaker 1: characters will say something that even as the viewer you almost double-take for a second like wait What did they just say?

825
01:00:15,094 --> 01:00:15,699
Speaker 1: what just happened?

826
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:20,420
Speaker 1: So I want to experience that with the rest of the show and not read the manga.

827
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:28,398
Speaker 0: So the thing that I think will keep me watching the show which I alluded to earlier briefly is the ghost the shell connection.

828
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:33,414
Speaker 0: Is that the best character in the show the panda?

829
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:35,040
Speaker 1: Oh you love that panda?

830
01:00:35,361 --> 01:00:35,562
Speaker 1: I do.

831
01:00:35,703 --> 01:00:36,627
Speaker 1: I enjoy the panda.

832
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:39,962
Speaker 1: I saw him to be what he was Before he.

833
01:00:39,982 --> 01:00:41,227
Speaker 1: they revealed what he was like.

834
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:42,512
Speaker 1: I could see where that character was going.

835
01:00:42,913 --> 01:00:43,596
Speaker 0: the panda.

836
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:47,452
Speaker 0: that clearly is Just Bato from ghost.

837
01:00:47,492 --> 01:00:51,028
Speaker 0: in the shell yep is Obviously voice acted right down to like.

838
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:52,552
Speaker 1: do I need to go help that kid?

839
01:00:52,573 --> 01:01:01,854
Speaker 0: his voice acted by a cute the voice of In a particular moment with his band the same character.

840
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:03,380
Speaker 0: It's the same voice actor.

841
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:05,467
Speaker 0: It is the best character in the show.

842
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:09,180
Speaker 0: all the other characters in the show have sort of you know good points and bad.

843
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:13,135
Speaker 0: Well my favorite character like or not like them Lewis's the interact.

844
01:01:13,175 --> 01:01:14,600
Speaker 0: Oh, that's that's just rim the character.

845
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:17,146
Speaker 1: He's toga like.

846
01:01:17,186 --> 01:01:20,198
Speaker 0: he's the toga character in toga less evil toga.

847
01:01:20,299 --> 01:01:23,719
Speaker 0: well logo who might be good it might be bad and it's questionable.

848
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:23,759
Speaker 0: I

849
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:35,981
Speaker 1: Don't know if he will if Lewis will end up being a better person than toga or a worse person than toga Because the show leaves ambiguous at the end of season one What

850
01:01:36,061 --> 01:01:36,824
Speaker 0: decisions

851
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:42,000
Speaker 1: the deer may have made relative to other things that were happening at the time?

852
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,548
Speaker 1: I'm being circumspect because you got to go watch the show.

853
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:45,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that is.

854
01:01:45,893 --> 01:01:51,352
Speaker 0: I think that definitely is one of the better Like you know not favorite character like panda.

855
01:01:51,975 --> 01:01:55,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Like better written characters, right?

856
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,629
Speaker 0: It's because you don't see too often right.

857
01:01:58,689 --> 01:02:01,699
Speaker 0: someone like that is usually gonna be like a toga where it's like.

858
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:07,504
Speaker 0: okay they're the secretly evil student council leader or the Stern sort of.

859
01:02:07,805 --> 01:02:09,791
Speaker 0: maybe looks like they're bad, but they're actually good.

860
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:12,940
Speaker 1: This is genuinely conflicted and complicated.

861
01:02:13,961 --> 01:02:15,065
Speaker 1: Second guesses himself.

862
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:16,270
Speaker 1: does the change?

863
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:24,311
Speaker 0: I think my that that conflicted complicatedness Rarely is combined with that personality.

864
01:02:24,371 --> 01:02:34,000
Speaker 0: right that personality and that position is Usually in anime stories, especially aligned with the particular kind of character in utenna.

865
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:38,059
Speaker 1: Toga is at no point conflicted with himself until the very end of the show.

866
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:40,892
Speaker 0: Oh, what about that whole part of the mill where he says they're doing nothing?

867
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,530
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, where he just lost himself But he's not conflicted.

868
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,258
Speaker 1: He's just lost.

869
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:47,665
Speaker 1: Maybe he doesn't have to make a decision He's just done the thing.

870
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:49,391
Speaker 1: any way coming turns out becoming the Beast.

871
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:49,692
Speaker 0: are that?

872
01:02:49,712 --> 01:02:50,415
Speaker 0: what's gonna happen?

873
01:02:50,455 --> 01:02:53,788
Speaker 0: is Lu is just gonna be lost For season two and come back in season three.

874
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:56,259
Speaker 1: Uh, did you see the the preview toga style?

875
01:02:57,362 --> 01:02:58,506
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a preview at the.

876
01:02:58,546 --> 01:03:03,203
Speaker 1: if you keep these edits at the end of season of the end of the last episode There's a stinger.

877
01:03:03,223 --> 01:03:16,488
Speaker 1: that is basically the opening scene of season two and a character who has clearly taken a lot of painkillers Shows up and you just see a POV shot of Legosi turning around saying oh, hey Welcome back.

878
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:17,819
Speaker 1: Basically, like where were you?

879
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:22,967
Speaker 1: Then it ends with see you in season two.

880
01:03:22,987 --> 01:03:25,956
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I did see that but it wasn't.

881
01:03:26,176 --> 01:03:29,267
Speaker 1: it does not show you who that character Is I'm just assuming who that character is.

882
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:30,472
Speaker 1: I may be wrong.

883
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:32,460
Speaker 0: Okay, but like I did watch that.

884
01:03:32,661 --> 01:03:39,980
Speaker 1: but the cool thing is all of the main characters and All of the side characters like even that chicken.

885
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:47,140
Speaker 1: They're way more complex and have way more depth than most shows would ever give characters with that little screen time.

886
01:03:47,803 --> 01:03:48,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, they definitely.

887
01:03:48,567 --> 01:03:51,140
Speaker 0: if a character shows up on screen even briefly.

888
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,229
Speaker 0: There's like a and has a face and a name.

889
01:03:54,249 --> 01:03:58,240
Speaker 0: then they they bothered to come up with something about them.

890
01:03:58,882 --> 01:04:01,188
Speaker 0: That is somewhat interesting.

891
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:02,071
Speaker 0: No character.

892
01:04:02,151 --> 01:04:03,776
Speaker 0: There's something to chew on.

893
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:05,300
Speaker 1: right like the little girl shows up.

894
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,768
Speaker 1: Oh, she's flirting with Legosi.

895
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:07,733
Speaker 1: I see what's happening.

896
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:13,720
Speaker 1: the next scene Her and Lewis have a moment and you might think that moment is gonna be the moment you're expecting.

897
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:20,695
Speaker 1: it might be in fact the exact opposite of what you were expecting and you learn a lot about that wolf character and things are Not what they look like.

898
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:25,608
Speaker 0: But this point is if someone appears like this They there's something to chew on for any character.

899
01:04:25,689 --> 01:04:28,500
Speaker 0: if there isn't then they don't bother to draw them and put them on there.

900
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:34,740
Speaker 1: Yep, if you see those characters at all, they're literally just like faceless utenna background people walking by.

901
01:04:35,483 --> 01:04:38,033
Speaker 0: Yep, all right, so I need food.

902
01:04:38,294 --> 01:04:38,535
Speaker 1: Okay.

903
01:04:38,635 --> 01:04:39,760
Speaker 1: I love the hell out of this show.

904

01:04:42,187 --> 01:04:43,612
Speaker 1: This show is dark.

907
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:52,366
Speaker 1: There are you have to deal with themes of Not for kids cannibalism rape sexual violence Violence violence death.

908
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:53,650
Speaker 1: characters die.

909
01:04:53,951 --> 01:04:55,235
Speaker 1: There is blood and gore.

910
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:56,740
Speaker 1: It is a rough show.

911
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,868
Speaker 0: You've got to be ready much every every warning you need.

912
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,636
Speaker 1: This is a tense psychosexual thriller.

913

Speaker 1: I Mean, well if anyone tries to watch it Netflix will warn them.
