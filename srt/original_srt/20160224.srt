1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,086
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 24th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:12,633
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and I'm Scott, and this is Geek Nights.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,250
Speaker 0: Tonight, Planetes, the manga.

4
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:20,480
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:34,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, sorry we missed the Monday show, but I work on Wall Street, and it's one of those weird industries where they'll spend millions and millions of dollars to shave microseconds off of some internal nonsense in some code.

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,240
Speaker 1: Well won't that result in more than millions being made from those microseconds being saved?

7
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:39,072
Speaker 0: -Theoretically.

8
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:39,559
Speaker 1: -In the long run?

9
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:40,823
Speaker 1: Maybe.

10
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,133
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of of dubious value.

11
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:44,560
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not a Monday show.

12
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,120
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm also dubious, but they believe that is what I'm saying.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:01:00,560
Speaker 0: But they push the envelopes of technology in these realms, and yet it's all old men who really won't use things like cell phones or video conferences or Skype.

14
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:08,200
Speaker 0: So I literally flew to Orange County to have one hour and a half meeting, and then I flew home.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,780
Speaker 1: Why didn't you just call them on the phone or video conference?

16
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:14,820
Speaker 0: That's what I would have done, being a young man, but it's an old man's game.

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:26,540
Speaker 0: And I was flown first class both ways to have one one and a half hour meeting with three people who I could have easily just had a gchat with to cover what we talked about.

18
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,000
Speaker 1: Was one of those people like insistent that you physically be there and all grumpy?

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,980
Speaker 0: The industry was insistent that I'd be there.

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,056
Speaker 1: But I mean, if you had just asked the three people, "Hey, would you have been upset if I had video conferences instead of come

21
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:38,277
Speaker 1: here?"

22
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:39,180
Speaker 1: What would they have said?

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,352
Speaker 0: I don't know, really, because I didn't even arrange any of this.

24
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,100
Speaker 0: This was all arranged for me while I was at breakfast.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,399
Speaker 1: But you didn't ask them when you got there?

26
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,360
Speaker 0: No, because I didn't really care that much.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,230
Speaker 0: What kind of people were they?

28
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,000
Speaker 1: Were they old people?

29
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:51,260
Speaker 0: Older than me, but not that much older.

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,600
Speaker 1: Right, I mean, so did they seem grumpy?

31
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:56,920
Speaker 0: They were not grumpy when we were meeting.

32
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:57,524
Speaker 1: Right.

33
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:00,000
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm sure they're reasonable if you would just talk to them.

34
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:00,504
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

35
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,675
Speaker 0: But also it's partly that...

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,420
Speaker 1: Did you make as much more money, enough money off of them to pay for the plane tickets?

37
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,662
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

38
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:15,180
Speaker 0: I guess what's weird is my company seems to treat me like if they just put me face to face in front of people, then they start making more money no matter what.

39
00:02:16,162 --> 00:02:18,873
Speaker 0: So they increasingly fly me around to do shit like that.

40
00:02:18,893 --> 00:02:20,419
Speaker 0: And I guess it's working for them.

41
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,365
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

42
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:22,880
Speaker 1: The people live in California, right?

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:23,928
Speaker 0: Oh, no, Scott.

44
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,839
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

45
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:28,840
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it be better to convince them by flying them to New York?

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,651
Speaker 0: They don't want to come to New York.

47
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:31,340
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

48
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:34,139
Speaker 1: Well, wait, wait, wait, who doesn't want to come to New York?

49
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,920
Speaker 0: Scott, have you ever visited Orange County like southeast of LA, like along the coast?

50
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,640
Speaker 1: Isn't it just mansions and private beaches?

51
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:48,740
Speaker 0: So the deal is there's a bunch of big companies there that have offices.

52
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,640
Speaker 0: The idea being that if you work for them, you live right next to the offices in like Orange County.

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,040
Speaker 1: I didn't think there was anywhere to put an office there because it was just mansion, mansion, mansion, road, mansion, road, mansion, road.

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,029
Speaker 0: There are so many office parks everywhere there.

55
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,700
Speaker 0: In fact, office space there is cheaper than in New York if you want a good building.

56
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,238
Speaker 0: So, yeah, a lot of people will put companies there because everyone wants to live in a place where it's always 76 degrees.

57
00:03:16,124 --> 00:03:20,180
Speaker 1: I just don't want to live in a place that's always 76 degrees and everything's roads.

58
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:24,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is no Venn diagram that covers that.

59
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,500
Speaker 1: And all the people near me are Orange County people.

60
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,651
Speaker 0: They're all pretty chill, I imagine.

61
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 0: I mean, they just surf all day, I guess.

62
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,957
Speaker 1: They're not New York people.

63
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:34,339
Speaker 0: New York people are generally kind of aggro.

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,340
Speaker 1: If I fall down on the side of the road and hurt myself, they're all just going to walk by, maybe spit on me or some shit.

65
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,740
Speaker 0: New York, they'll stop to help you, but only if you don't look like a hobo.

66
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,039
Speaker 0: If you look like a hobo, they will just walk by.

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,879
Speaker 0: They won't spit on you, but they will pretend they did not see you.

68
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:49,797
Speaker 1: As it should be.

69
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:57,060
Speaker 0: I watched some motherfucker today, an ambulance, full of lights and sirens, was blazing down the road trying to get through a crosswalk.

70
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,040
Speaker 0: This motherfucker looking right at it still walked out in front of it and blocked it because he had the right of way.

71
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,975
Speaker 1: Why didn't the ambulance hit him?

72
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:05,760
Speaker 0: Because that might have been inconvenient, I guess.

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,760
Speaker 1: They could have just hit him, put him in the bag and kept going and then picked up the other person.

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,019
Speaker 0: Crazy ambulance.

75
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,118
Speaker 1: Sounds like a video game to me.

76
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:16,519
Speaker 0: So anyway, you got any animation or comic news?

77
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,680
Speaker 0: It being Wednesday geek nights, the hardest geek nights to do because we don't watch anime every day anymore.

78
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,660
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really hard to find any anime comic news going on right now.

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,440
Speaker 1: It's the quiet times as the slow build up.

80
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,900
Speaker 1: You know, the beginning of the year is always the quietest, right?

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,940
Speaker 1: This stuff, you know, the only thing that comes up early in the year for comics or animation or anything is like you get a lot of festivals, right?

82
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:46,980
Speaker 1: Because the Children's Film Festival is coming, but that's all stuff that's like done already.

83
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,120
Speaker 0: Well, we've already talked about how we're going on Friday to see the premiere.

84
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:51,622
Speaker 1: Right.

85
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,300
Speaker 1: So, I mean, that's a Wednesday episode for two weeks from now.

86
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,140
Speaker 1: No problem.

87
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,160
Speaker 1: But, you know, people are saving stuff for like Comic-Con in the summer and free comic book day.

88
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,179
Speaker 1: You don't get too much, right?

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I got a bunch of minor news, but it's the kind of news where I have nothing to say about it other than, yeah, do you read the same websites?

90
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:06,820
Speaker 0: I do?

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, we both know the same headline.

92
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:08,761
Speaker 0: Right.

93
00:05:08,781 --> 00:05:10,510
Speaker 1: So I got two really minor news.

94
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,580
Speaker 1: is pretty much this exists and this exists, right?

95
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,520
Speaker 1: So the first thing that exists, here's a book coming out in Japanese that did not exist before.

96
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:22,620
Speaker 1: And the book is How to Draw Like Ryuichi Ikigami.

97
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:31,620
Speaker 0: Oh, man, it's just going to be a whole tutorial on how to make someone who's looking down, but then somehow looking up at you and smoldering.

98
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:32,119
Speaker 1: Right.

99
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,746
Speaker 1: It's nothing but that.

100
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:35,479
Speaker 0: It's just guys looking down, but then looking up.

101
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:45,520
Speaker 1: The other thing that exists is one of, you know, favorite artists of gig nights, Lamar Abrams, who also works on Steven Universe.

102
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,318
Speaker 1: And he made remake, which is the Astro Boy parody thing.

103
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:48,540
Speaker 1: Remember?

104
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,266
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

105
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:50,320
Speaker 0: Asshole Astro Boy.

106
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:50,841
Speaker 1: Right.

107
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:55,360
Speaker 1: So Lamar Abrams has a new comic, which is a Dragon Quest inspired comic.

108
00:05:55,501 --> 00:06:00,540
Speaker 1: I imagine it's like the remake is to Astro Boy as Endless World is to Dragon Quest.

109
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:06,540
Speaker 1: And you can get it for three dollars on his Gumroad, which is, I guess, a website where you can sell your little indie comic.

110
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,066
Speaker 1: So three dollars.

111
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,960
Speaker 1: I mean, that's like that's less than a bacon, egg and cheese.

112
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:15,440
Speaker 1: And you'll probably be if you know anything about Dragon Quest, you will probably be laughing big time.

113
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,200
Speaker 1: So his Tumblr is Neo N-E-O dash Rama R-A-M-A dot Tumblr.

114
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:31,500
Speaker 1: So you can or I'm sure you can find it on Gumroad if you just search for, I guess, Endless World or Lamar Abrams.

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:32,862
Speaker 1: So there you go.

116
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:35,650
Speaker 1: Two things that exist that you can buy in the near future.

117
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:38,780
Speaker 1: that are things you probably wouldn't know about.

118
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,136
Speaker 1: Just reading the normal news is.

119
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:45,480
Speaker 0: So there's another thing that you have three hours as of when we're doing the shows.

120
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,496
Speaker 0: You might already miss it.

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,899
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

122
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:52,120
Speaker 0: But so this is a Kickstarter with a bunch of really top notch artists.

123
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:52,824
Speaker 0: And this is the.

124
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,560
Speaker 0: this is not the first Smut Peddler Kickstarter.

125
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen Smut Peddlers before and I've neglected to buy them only because I figured I'll be able to get a copy of that somewhere else and read it.

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Speaker 0: Now, it's one of those things where I'm not necessarily a huge fan of pornography, but I am a fan of erotica, or at least the idea that I'd like there to be more erotica in public culture and less traditional shitty pornography.

127
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,267
Speaker 1: See, I'm more.

128
00:07:16,448 --> 00:07:18,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess some sort of the same idea.

129
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,380
Speaker 1: I actually like erotica pornography, but I only like certain kinds.

130
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,059
Speaker 1: And those are the rarest kinds.

131
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:31,200
Speaker 1: I really strongly dislike the very common kind that, you know, is Robbie Dee.

132
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,961
Speaker 1: Yes.

133
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:39,844
Speaker 1: The kind where it's like, you know, someone with giant fake boobs and people just going, Right.

134
00:07:39,884 --> 00:07:40,185
Speaker 0: All right.

135
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:41,308
Speaker 0: You know, that sounds great.

136
00:07:41,609 --> 00:07:45,020
Speaker 1: I like stuff like, you know, you read something like.

137
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,710
Speaker 1: Oh, what was the thing Alan Moore did?

138
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:49,937
Speaker 1: Lost Girls or whatever.

139
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:50,259
Speaker 1: Right.

140
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,299
Speaker 1: You get your, you know, Ogloff, I guess isn't really porn, even though it is highly mature rated.

141
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,065
Speaker 1: You can't fap to that.

142
00:07:58,165 --> 00:08:01,760
Speaker 0: So Ogloff occasionally has erotic elements like the whole story with the Snow Queen.

143
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,944
Speaker 0: That was that was hot.

144
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,069
Speaker 0: Not going to pretend it wasn't.

145
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:06,740
Speaker 1: I've never been turned on by Ogloff.

146
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:08,328
Speaker 0: Not by the Snow Queen story.

147
00:08:08,348 --> 00:08:09,614
Speaker 0: No, not really.

148
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:10,337
Speaker 0: Not even.

149
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:10,860
Speaker 0: No.

150
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,269
Speaker 0: Well, now's your chance to be turned on by Ogloff.

151
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,278
Speaker 1: In fact, the Snow Queen story is rather chilling.

152
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,185
Speaker 1: It had opposite effect.

153
00:08:19,245 --> 00:08:20,188
Speaker 1: It was like, oh, shit, son.

154
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:22,777
Speaker 1: Oh, hell no.

155
00:08:22,797 --> 00:08:23,500
Speaker 1: Get that away from me.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,131
Speaker 0: So the Smut Peddler double header has two projects.

157
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:29,620
Speaker 0: You can back one or you basically get one or both within it.

158
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:33,715
Speaker 0: One of them is a monster boys anthology with an all star.

159
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:35,039
Speaker 0: who's who of artists.

160
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:45,380
Speaker 0: But the reason I'm bringing this to your attention, the reason I went from that's cool to I'm backing it, is that the entity that does Ogloff has a short comic in it.

161
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:48,895
Speaker 1: And you won't be able to read it anywhere else unless you buy this.

162
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:49,599
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

163
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,905
Speaker 1: And you got to read anything.

164
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:59,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, because this stuff, as best I can tell, it's a vampire who gets involved with a girl who is a fan of vampires.

165
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:02,246
Speaker 0: And there's one.

166
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:04,920
Speaker 0: there's one page of it that is previewed on the Kickstarter.

167
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,423
Speaker 0: It looks pretty great.

168
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:14,040
Speaker 0: So, yeah, you probably missed it by the time you listen to Geek Nights, but I'm sure you can get this from non Kickstarter sources.

169
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:19,140
Speaker 0: And while, you know, we go to a lot of conventions, we don't really do news about every convention these days.

170
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,384
Speaker 0: Like at Magfest.

171
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:23,780
Speaker 1: I mean, most conventions, at least anime comic conventions.

172
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,505
Speaker 1: News doesn't happen.

173
00:09:25,586 --> 00:09:29,564
Speaker 1: And even if news does happen, it's just comic book company announces something.

174
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:31,940
Speaker 1: Usually these days it's Hollywood company announces something.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,086
Speaker 1: And we don't give any shits.

176
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:34,413
Speaker 1: Look at all the fuck up.

177
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:35,257
Speaker 1: Fucks, Baron.

178
00:09:35,317 --> 00:09:35,800
Speaker 1: Baron Field.

179
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,780
Speaker 0: Well, also, we we only actually go to one anime convention every year now at most.

180
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,109
Speaker 0: It's either one or zero.

181
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,540
Speaker 0: And Anime Boston is it.

182
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:51,080
Speaker 0: So we avoid Katsucon, partly because after the staff turned on everything many years ago, when they moved into the gala, it used to be a hot.

183
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,540
Speaker 1: You can go back and listen to Geek Nights is about Katsucon and learn the story of how it was a hot con.

184
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:57,780
Speaker 1: And then the staff turned over and then we didn't go anymore.

185
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,062
Speaker 0: Yep.

186
00:09:58,283 --> 00:10:00,860
Speaker 0: And it's a bad con now, like the panel policy.

187
00:10:01,121 --> 00:10:09,260
Speaker 0: They basically have this whole nonsense where if you want to be a panelist, you have to pay for a panelist badge that cost like 40 bucks for the privilege of doing a panel.

188
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,560
Speaker 0: So if you've already got some other badge, you also have to pay for the forty dollar panelist badge or you can't run a panel.

189
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,560
Speaker 0: And they basically don't really reimburse a lot of the talent that they have.

190
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:22,489
Speaker 0: It's a it's a mess of a convention.

191
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:24,520
Speaker 0: So we obviously don't go.

192
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:27,740
Speaker 0: But something was making the rounds on the Internet.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,140
Speaker 0: A bunch of photos of how fans at Katsucon anime kid attendees trash the hotel.

194
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:50,760
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, anytime you put, you know, young high school teenagers, early 20s people into a hotel with limited or no supervision from adults or any kind of authority other than, you know, police who aren't paying attention because no one's committing any like serious crimes.

195
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:53,373
Speaker 1: That kind of shit happens.

196
00:10:53,998 --> 00:10:54,159
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,940
Speaker 1: But when I was that age, I often went to hotels with, you know, and other things of that nature.

198
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,565
Speaker 1: And shit went down.

199
00:11:01,947 --> 00:11:09,300
Speaker 0: Now, it's interesting from a bunch of angles, because for one, like there's all these articles about, oh, my God, Katsucon damage, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

200
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Speaker 0: But it's the same four photos in every one of those damage reports.

201
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:16,850
Speaker 0: There's just four.

202
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:18,180
Speaker 0: Now, it's pretty great.

203
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:22,178
Speaker 0: It basically shows a hotel room that was flooded with what looks like a foot or two of water.

204
00:11:23,741 --> 00:11:23,962
Speaker 0: Right.

205
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,280
Speaker 0: And someone wrote Katsucon all over the inside of one bathroom style.

206
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,099
Speaker 0: And I guess someone punched a hole in a wall.

207
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:35,479
Speaker 0: It's not clear whether or not the punched hole might have been a door, was in the same room that had the flood or if it was an unrelated room.

208
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:51,260
Speaker 0: But it's interesting to me that the like fan media sort of flipped out about this Katsucon thing, because you find pictures of that kind of damage from most anime cons if you look at all in the forums or on Twitter.

209
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,979
Speaker 0: Like this didn't even look particularly bad compared to other anime cons that I've seen damage at.

210
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,359
Speaker 0: So it's really interesting that the nerd media sort of really picked up on it.

211
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,500
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I have heard rumors that are little more than complete nonsense.

212
00:12:06,661 --> 00:12:24,878
Speaker 0: Like they've made it around through some reasonably reliable sources that the gay lord, the place that Katsucon is hosted might actually be talking to them to either not let them return or raising the prices of their room blocks because of a trend of damage that's increasing

213
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:25,400
Speaker 1: over the years.

214
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:35,360
Speaker 1: Well, I think, you know, you're sort of self-fulfilling your privacy by discussing and promoting this, the fact that this happened and saying, guys, you know, it's like you're making a bigger deal out of it than it is.

215
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,378
Speaker 1: And the hotel sees that.

216
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,381
Speaker 0: Oh, true.

217
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:38,767
Speaker 0: But at the same time...

218
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,380
Speaker 1: The cover up is what you should be doing.

219
00:12:44,425 --> 00:12:47,079
Speaker 0: So we'll get to that, why the cover up doesn't work.

220
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:48,597
Speaker 1: You can cover it up.

221
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:59,060
Speaker 0: But what's real interesting also is that I was doing some informal surveys by going to a bunch of anime con websites and checking out what the con rate is for local hotels.

222
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,980
Speaker 0: Anime con hotel rooms are often way more expensive than gaming con hotel rooms in similar areas.

223
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:15,240
Speaker 0: And I wonder if the expected damage from kids at anime cons is actually higher.

224
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:26,560
Speaker 0: I mean, this is all conjecture, but I'm pretty sure anime cons have way more people crammed into hotel rooms than your average packs or magfest, partly because it's mostly younger kids.

225
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,180
Speaker 1: Hotels aren't stupid, right?

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,659
Speaker 1: And you think even if you go to a hotel, anyone you interact with there might not know what the hell is going on.

227
00:13:34,582 --> 00:13:45,500
Speaker 1: You can be sure the people who negotiate the events at the hotel, who negotiated with the convention, and the managers of the hotel as a whole, they're the person who's setting the prices on these things.

228
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,420
Speaker 1: They know what they're doing.

229
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:52,334
Speaker 1: They're not dum-dums, even if the concierge is like, "Oh, why is everyone dressed up?

230
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,197
Speaker 1: What the hell is going

231
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:53,478
Speaker 1: on?".

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,260
Speaker 1: There's only two people that have to know what the hell is going on, and they know.

233
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,959
Speaker 1: There's enough anime cons, there's enough hotels, the con has been coming to the hotel for enough years.

234
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:04,224
Speaker 1: I saw

235
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:19,120
Speaker 0: a story that linked to a forum thread in an unnamed large anime convention, where someone was basically talking about how it's bullshit that the hotels make sure everyone has a room key before they let them up into the guest floors, and they're really strict about four people in the room.

236
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,139
Speaker 1: They're allowed to do that.

237
00:14:20,761 --> 00:14:26,180
Speaker 0: No, no, no, what I'm getting at is that hotels don't give a fuck except during the anime con.

238
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,460
Speaker 0: Go to that same hotel the next weekend, the room will be cheaper, and they don't care if you have ten people in the room.

239
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,120
Speaker 1: I could just walk into, like, there's all kinds of hotels right near my work, Manhattan hotels, right?

240
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,520
Speaker 1: I could walk into the Sheraton near my office, and just go up to an elevator, push the button, get in, and go to any floor I want, pretty much.

241
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:48,580
Speaker 1: And no one's going to stop me or look at me or question me whether I got a room key, whether I got luggage, whether I got anything.

242
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,440
Speaker 0: So I realized reading through this thread...

243
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,660
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be able to get into any doors on that floor because I don't have a room key unless I broke in.

244
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,060
Speaker 0: But I realized reading through this, well, a lot of hotels in New York, you can't use the elevator without swiping a floor key.

245
00:14:58,301 --> 00:15:00,819
Speaker 1: Usually the hour of the day they turn that on and off.

246
00:15:01,703 --> 00:15:03,880
Speaker 0: Or if it's near a place where tourists are wandering in.

247
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:10,060
Speaker 1: Right, but especially if they have a floor, for example, that has ballrooms, you can usually just go right to that floor on an escalator or something.

248
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:18,560
Speaker 0: But what I'm getting at is that a lot of anime con attendees sort of assume that hotels are always like that because they only go to anime cons.

249
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,955
Speaker 0: Guys, the hotels only do that because you're there.

250
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:22,920
Speaker 0: You specifically.

251
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:27,460
Speaker 0: Those rules are basically only in place because they know what you're up to.

252
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,080
Speaker 0: They know you're trying to sneak eight more people into your room.

253
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:34,320
Speaker 0: They know you're going to clog the stupid sink with your cosplay nonsense and cause a flood.

254
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,359
Speaker 0: They're keeping an eye on you for a reason.

255
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:43,300
Speaker 0: So if you think you can cover it up, my actual news, this really made the rounds a while ago.

256
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:54,040
Speaker 0: But it's made the rounds again, thanks to the Kajikan story, is basically a takedown of what happened to a moderately sized furry convention, Rain Furrest.

257
00:15:55,061 --> 00:15:56,329
Speaker 1: That's a great name, by the way.

258
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,235
Speaker 1: Rain Furrest.

259
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:57,960
Speaker 1: Good job.

260
00:15:58,201 --> 00:16:03,200
Speaker 0: Sort of did try to cover up the fact that over the years, like this is someone who worked on the staff.

261
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:14,380
Speaker 1: This is like the person who's like on the board of the chairman or, you know, someone who is a big, important person who worked on the convention wrote this amazing, eloquent write up of exactly what went down step by step.

262
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:19,680
Speaker 1: And I'm believing everything they say based entirely on the quality of their write up.

263
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:25,880
Speaker 1: And anyone who can write a write up that quality must be intelligent and therefore is probably not the wrongdoer.

264
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:32,860
Speaker 0: But the gist of it is that the cons have data about how much damage happens, because that's something you get from your liaison.

265
00:16:33,681 --> 00:16:42,780
Speaker 0: And what happened at Rain Furrest was the amount of property damage that happened at the hotel had grown like statistically significantly year over year.

266
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:49,080
Speaker 0: And rather than do anything about it, they basically never said anything publicly and pretended it wasn't happening.

267
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:53,580
Speaker 0: And eventually they basically got blackballed from any hotel on the West Coast.

268
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,058
Speaker 0: So this could happen to you.

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,040
Speaker 0: It's also kind of the final point about all this is I want to remind you of a thread that was in the Otacon forums many, many, many years ago.

270
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,260
Speaker 0: It's long gone because they've like read on the forums and everything.

271
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:16,240
Speaker 0: But it was a bunch of people at Otacon complaining and freaking out and wanting to call the police because they rented hotel rooms.

272
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:19,519
Speaker 0: But then the hotel ripped them off and charged them a bunch of extra money.

273
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,980
Speaker 0: And I bet you not, the result of the investigation was taxes, guys, you have to pay taxes on hotel rooms.

274
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,558
Speaker 0: You clearly didn't know that.

275
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,141
Speaker 0: Nope.

276
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:32,880
Speaker 1: I mean, didn't even look at the invoice and see that it said the extra money was taxes.

277
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,340
Speaker 0: Ah, thus that is the average Otacon attendee dealing with hotels.

278
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,780
Speaker 0: So Otacon attendees are worried that the rates of the hotel rooms and hotel blocks are going to go up at their conventions because of this kind of damage.

279
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,469
Speaker 0: And luckily for you, that's not really the case.

280
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,500
Speaker 0: The rates are going up because there aren't other hotels.

281
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,045
Speaker 0: You guys don't make the money.

282
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,093
Speaker 0: None of you have corporate expense accounts.

283
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,780
Speaker 0: None of you are getting room service.

284
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:07,540
Speaker 0: So if the average attendee of your convention is under the age of like 25, the hotel has no incentive to give you any discount.

285
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,659
Speaker 0: You're lucky if they give you a room block because they don't have to.

286
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,585
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

287
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,076
Speaker 0: Go to another convention center?

288
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:13,680
Speaker 0: Good luck.

289
00:18:13,923 --> 00:18:14,109
Speaker 1: Where?

290
00:18:14,129 --> 00:18:14,480
Speaker 1: Which one?

291
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the Gaylord.

292
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:19,217
Speaker 0: Name another convention center that big anywhere on the East Coast.

293
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,140
Speaker 0: The BCEC.

294
00:18:20,781 --> 00:18:22,719
Speaker 1: And then the place Otacon is moving to.

295
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, there aren't that many.

296
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:25,606
Speaker 0: Look at PAX.

297
00:18:26,127 --> 00:18:30,317
Speaker 0: They already use every hotel, like every hotel.

298
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:31,680
Speaker 0: There aren't more hotels.

299
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:37,920
Speaker 0: So if every hotel is going to sell out no matter what, why would a hotel give you 200 bucks off a night?

300
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,463
Speaker 0: Why don't they?

301
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:39,755
Speaker 1: The demand exceeds the supply.

302
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:40,300
Speaker 1: End of story.

303
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,628
Speaker 0: And that will never be fixed.

304
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:46,380
Speaker 0: There is no incentive to build more hotels because you're gaming.

305
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,040
Speaker 1: Until we invent the teleporter and make the hotel obsolete.

306
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:49,540
Speaker 0: Yep.

307
00:18:49,942 --> 00:18:51,808
Speaker 0: But then conventions might also be obsolete.

308
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:55,140
Speaker 0: Conventions are, hey guys, let's all show up in this one place at this one time tomorrow.

309
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,684
Speaker 1: Yes.

310
00:18:55,744 --> 00:18:57,119
Speaker 1: This awesome empty hotel.

311
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,124
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:59,419
Speaker 0: Hyperion is going to be like that.

313
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,759
Speaker 1: Paintball time.

314
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:14,780
Speaker 0: So I would just suggest, because all these issues, like I even searched around, I could not find equivalent damage concerns or damage reports or photos or anything from Magfest.

315
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,320
Speaker 0: And Magfest was in the same hotel as Katsucon the weekend after it.

316
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,192
Speaker 0: And I suspect, I do not know anything inside, but I suspect for real.

317
00:19:24,553 --> 00:19:26,940
Speaker 0: there is way less damage to the Gaylord after Magfest.

318
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,759
Speaker 0: Despite the fact that there's a bunch of drunk 30 year olds wandering around, super drunk.

319
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:31,598
Speaker 1: Eh, who knows.

320
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll find out.

321
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,459
Speaker 1: We didn't go anywhere where there would have been damage to see it.

322
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:45,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I also poked around and couldn't find any similar Twitter tweets of "hey, check this shit out" like happened at Katsucon.

323
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,003
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

324
00:19:53,023 --> 00:19:53,990
Speaker 0: You got a thing of the day?

325
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,230
Speaker 1: You know that phenomenon where you hear a new word or a new concept and then you start hearing it everywhere?

326
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:01,359
Speaker 1: What's the name of that?

327
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,329
Speaker 1: It keeps happening a lot.

328
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:05,490
Speaker 0: Like you see a bear shit in the woods once and then there's bears everywhere?

329
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:06,549
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

330
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:12,610
Speaker 1: So on my Spotify discover weekly playlist, I heard this song and I was like, wow, this song.

331
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,429
Speaker 1: Wow, wow, wow.

332
00:20:14,652 --> 00:20:15,610
Speaker 1: That's like a new thing.

333
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:16,141
Speaker 1: Whoa.

334
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:25,090
Speaker 1: So I went to search for it and in searching for it, I discovered that it is from a musical, musical micro genre known as vaporwave.

335
00:20:25,271 --> 00:20:27,870
Speaker 1: And then since I saw the vaporwave, is that like spookwave?

336
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:31,290
Speaker 1: So since I heard this word, I've heard it like a hundred times.

337
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:37,250
Speaker 1: We were even playing a board game and one of the characters had like funny hair on one of the cards.

338
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,549
Speaker 1: Oh, it was one of the treasures in the digging game.

339
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:42,969
Speaker 1: And Anthony kept referring to that treasure as vaporwave.

340
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:47,590
Speaker 1: And it's like this thing that I just discovered on my own.

341
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:50,350
Speaker 1: And I think even Chase mentioned it to me like on the bus.

342
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,890
Speaker 1: He was like following like a vaporwave Facebook.

343
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,070
Speaker 0: One could say that there is a vaporwave wave?

344
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,029
Speaker 1: I don't know.

345
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,630
Speaker 1: But since I saw that, heard this one song and saw this Wikipedia page, I've been hearing it everywhere.

346
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,990
Speaker 1: So according to Wikipedia, vaporwave is a musical micro genre that emerged in the early 2010s among Internet communities.

347
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:14,950
Speaker 1: It is characterized by a nostalgic fascination with retro cultural aesthetic.

348
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:22,230
Speaker 1: Video games technology and advertising often involves the fusion of modern popular music with lounge, smooth jazz and elevator music.

349
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,590
Speaker 1: And sampling is very prevalent, et cetera, et cetera.

350
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:30,110
Speaker 0: I'm I'm I'm already dubious that it is that distinct of a genre from what you describe.

351
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,353
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not that.

352
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:35,510
Speaker 1: I mean, there are certain like Daft Punk tracks that it sounds like.

353
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:43,530
Speaker 1: And it's like every vaporwave track that I hear is pretty different from the others and sounds really similar to a track I heard in another genre somewhere else.

354
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:47,190
Speaker 1: But they sort of also all have something in common.

355
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:54,810
Speaker 1: So it's almost like it's not its own genre, but like, you know, this sort of space that like another song can fit into.

356
00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:02,350
Speaker 1: And like, just because you made a playlist of songs in different places that have a thing in common, does that make a new genre or not?

357
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:02,952
Speaker 1: I don't know.

358
00:22:02,972 --> 00:22:07,610
Speaker 1: But all I know is that this is the music that you would listen to in like cyberpunk land.

359
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,089
Speaker 1: And so I like this music.

360
00:22:11,071 --> 00:22:21,748
Speaker 1: So the song in particular that I heard on Spotify was from an album known entitled Cham by a group named Macross 82-99.

361
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:24,750
Speaker 0: Already up my alley.

362
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,079
Speaker 1: And the art on the album is like incredible.

363
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:29,690
Speaker 1: And they have a band camp here.

364
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,759
Speaker 1: They also have a sound cloud and Spotify, of course.

365
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,040
Speaker 1: Right.

366
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:34,525
Speaker 1: And YouTube.

367
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:35,990
Speaker 1: You can hear this music anywhere.

368
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:38,940
Speaker 1: And the hot song.

369
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,430
Speaker 1: What was the name of the hot song that I heard?

370
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:41,755
Speaker 0: Oh, you wanted me to.

371
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:43,425
Speaker 0: It was.

372
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:44,029
Speaker 0: I miss you.

373
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:44,591
Speaker 0: Yeah.

374
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:45,637
Speaker 0: On the on the Cham.

375
00:22:45,677 --> 00:22:46,220
Speaker 0: Featuring someone else.

376
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,584
Speaker 1: So that was the song that Spotify put in my Discover playlist.

377
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,669
Speaker 1: that made me go like, whoa.

378
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,829
Speaker 1: And that also happens to be the best song I've heard from them so far.

379
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,270
Speaker 1: So it shows you the power of Spotify Discover playlist.

380
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:01,404
Speaker 0: So I was going to do a really good Utena AMV.

381
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:02,550
Speaker 0: that I found is my thing of the day.

382
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:05,230
Speaker 0: But Scott and Emily both think my things today are bullshit.

383
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,973
Speaker 1: They are your things.

384
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:06,555
Speaker 1: They're not good.

385
00:23:06,755 --> 00:23:10,890
Speaker 0: So I decided that I really have to double down on my things of the day.

386
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:12,295
Speaker 0: And I'm bringing out.

387
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:15,530
Speaker 0: So, you know, there's those novelty Twitter accounts, like just a bear.

388
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:16,833
Speaker 0: And they're like pretty good.

389
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,037
Speaker 0: Like, I'm a bear.

390
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:22,510
Speaker 0: They sort of role play or like the Andrew Jackson account, a toy Twitter account.

391
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:23,435
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm there.

392
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,289
Speaker 0: I run the Kweblo forties account, but not that many people follow it.

393
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:38,030
Speaker 0: But of all of those, this is a novelty Twitter account that is both really up my particular alley and also actually legit funny in its own way.

394
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,175
Speaker 0: Retweet your skeleton.

395
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:41,841
Speaker 0: Hit us with your skeletons.

396
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:42,765
Speaker 0: No flesh.

397
00:23:42,946 --> 00:23:43,970
Speaker 0: Only skeletons, please.

398
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:50,450
Speaker 0: And I'd seen this retweeted occasionally, but I followed it when I saw this particular tweet.

399
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:55,049
Speaker 0: And I laughed out loud in the office so hard that people came over to see what the hell I was looking at.

400
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,412
Speaker 1: It's just a skeleton on the floor.

401
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,815
Speaker 0: It's get a look up close.

402
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:05,470
Speaker 0: It's a skeleton at a grocery store laying like it fell from a great height, surrounded by a sea of broken beer bottles.

403
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:12,009
Speaker 0: OK, so I highly recommend that you follow this Twitter account because I get endless amusement from it.

404
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:13,857
Speaker 1: OK, you continue.

405
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:16,830
Speaker 1: Skeletons, you're continuing your trend of not that great things.

406
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,651
Speaker 0: I mean, look at this.

407
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:23,450
Speaker 0: Here is a skeleton riding a little hamster, like someone put a little hamster down and has a skeleton on it.

408
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:24,718
Speaker 0: Ride it like a jockey.

409
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,330
Speaker 0: It's a good skeletons.

410
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,396
Speaker 0: In the moment, we were just at Magfest.

411
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:36,390
Speaker 0: We were on like seven goddamn panels and video of some of them will appear as we feel like getting it together.

412
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,216
Speaker 0: Geek Nights presents you 10.

413
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:40,269
Speaker 0: Episode 14 was uploaded a while ago.

414
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,470
Speaker 0: Any of you who complained to me that it was taken down due to copyright?

415
00:24:45,011 --> 00:24:47,600
Speaker 0: It is as of dateline six twenty three p.m.

416
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,162
Speaker 0: today.

417
00:24:48,643 --> 00:24:49,145
Speaker 0: Back up.

418
00:24:49,506 --> 00:24:50,570
Speaker 0: And I think I fought off.

419
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,634
Speaker 1: We already record 15.

420
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, we recorded the video of 15.

421
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 0: I have to edit 15.

422
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,950
Speaker 0: Editing takes a while for these things, for obvious reasons.

423
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,079
Speaker 1: Let's make 16.

424
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:01,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will.

425
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,108
Speaker 1: I got to know what happens.

426
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,549
Speaker 0: However, however.

427
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,069
Speaker 1: Because I don't know what happens next.

428
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,396
Speaker 0: I do have my shuttle pro V2 knob.

429
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:15,790
Speaker 0: And let me tell you, it cut about 40 percent of the editing time off based on my previous experience editing these videos together.

430
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,315
Speaker 0: Our next convention is coming up.

431
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:18,897
Speaker 0: Stay tuned for.

432
00:25:18,937 --> 00:25:20,020
Speaker 0: Maybe Anime Boston.

433
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:21,826
Speaker 0: Definitely PAX East.

434
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,250
Speaker 0: We're at least doing Atari game design.

435
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,635
Speaker 0: PAX Prime.

436
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:26,149
Speaker 0: I'm assuming we'll be doing a bunch of stuff.

437
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,796
Speaker 0: Kinetic Con.

438
00:25:29,198 --> 00:25:29,860
Speaker 0: Zenkai Con.

439
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,929
Speaker 0: We got a bunch of panels, et cetera.

440
00:25:33,895 --> 00:25:34,410
Speaker 1: It's con season.

441
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:35,592
Speaker 0: It is.

442
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:37,922
Speaker 0: But at least we're past the deepest con season.

443
00:25:37,942 --> 00:25:39,067
Speaker 0: We've got kind of a lull.

444
00:25:39,087 --> 00:25:39,890
Speaker 0: I don't think we have anything.

445
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,874
Speaker 1: PAX East.

446
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:42,383
Speaker 1: Maybe Anime Boston.

447
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:42,685
Speaker 1: Zenkai.

448
00:25:42,725 --> 00:25:43,490
Speaker 1: It's three cons.

449
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not that.

450
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,422
Speaker 1: Also, the Moga Festival is the same weekend as Zenkai Con.

451
00:25:47,442 --> 00:25:48,949
Speaker 1: I just found this out like 10 minutes ago.

452
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:49,470
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:50,690
Speaker 1: So, there you go.

454
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:50,891
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

455
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:53,490
Speaker 0: And if you don't listen to the end of the show after the credits, you probably should.

456
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:54,210
Speaker 0: No, you shouldn't.

457
00:25:54,913 --> 00:25:55,208
Speaker 1: Don't.

458
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,450
Speaker 0: For many months now, there's been stuff after the credits.

459
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,088
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

460
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,550
Speaker 0: So, Planetes, there was the anime that you watched most of, right?

461
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:04,751
Speaker 1: Right.

462
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,096
Speaker 1: So, this is something that came out.

463
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:09,650
Speaker 1: It doesn't feel that old, but this came out when we were in our college days.

464
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:10,450
Speaker 0: Yeah.

465
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:10,955
Speaker 1: Early 2000s.

466
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,570
Speaker 1: Like Emily had- I remember it being on the shelf in that media play.

467
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,150
Speaker 0: Emily had some DVDs that I don't remember if she got them for Scott Johnson or if we gave them to Scott Johnson, but he was involved in some fashion.

468
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,173
Speaker 1: It was an anime and a manga.

469
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:27,170
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the manga came first, but the anime came first to the US at least and then the manga.

470
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:36,490
Speaker 1: But recently, the manga has been reprinted in an omnibus format of much larger volumes and not a bunch of small Tokyo pop crap volumes.

471
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:40,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, like large enough volume to where a whole art gets told in volume one.

472
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,031
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:51,410
Speaker 1: So, if this is on your interest in reading, now is the time to acquire these large and less expensive volumes to get more manga for your dollar.

474
00:26:51,570 --> 00:27:01,490
Speaker 1: Now, these DVDs that we had were so fucking bootleg that I remember- I watched digital fan subs when I watched not all of the anime, but most of it.

475
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,670
Speaker 1: How far did you get in the anime?

476
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:03,497
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

477
00:27:03,537 --> 00:27:04,266
Speaker 1: It was in the early 2000s.

478
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,962
Speaker 1: It's only a one-season show.

479
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:06,910
Speaker 0: It's like 26 episodes.

480
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:07,479
Speaker 1: Maybe half at most.

481
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,190
Speaker 1: At most half.

482
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:17,030
Speaker 0: I saw two episodes and then the bootleg DVDs we had degenerated into Cyrillic nonsense and were fake as far as I could tell.

483
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,570
Speaker 0: Like, these weren't subtitles anymore.

484
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:26,730
Speaker 1: So, I bought the first of these volumes and it was the only comic I had that I could grab quickly and convince rim to read easily.

485
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,030
Speaker 0: Makoto Yukimura is the author of this manga.

486
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:30,952
Speaker 1: So, I did so.

487
00:27:30,992 --> 00:27:32,196
Speaker 1: So, what is Planetes?

488
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:36,390
Speaker 1: Planetes is a hard science fiction manga in space.

489
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:41,150
Speaker 1: So, it's about astronauts, but these astronauts, it's in the future.

490
00:27:42,011 --> 00:27:49,930
Speaker 1: But it's hard science fiction in that there's nothing fantastic or unrealistic, but it's still in the future.

491
00:27:50,511 --> 00:27:52,017
Speaker 1: So, it's not like it's 100% hard.

492
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:53,824
Speaker 1: It's just like 90% hard, right?

493
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:09,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would put it- take a little bit of the Pat LeBourne character dynamic, but pull it way back and then take space brothers- And space brothers is less fantastical.

494
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,044
Speaker 0: I'm saying in terms of the characters within this hard sci-fi universe.

495
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:14,650
Speaker 0: The way they interact with each other.

496
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:19,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pat LeBourne crew in his space brothers world with a little bit less realistic.

497
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:23,810
Speaker 0: That's basically how I would describe this manga.

498
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:24,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of.

499
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:27,010
Speaker 0: It's about the less glamorous parts of space.

500
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:32,010
Speaker 1: So, their job is in space, when everyone's traveling in space, there's a bunch of space debris.

501
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,270
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a problem we have now, space junk, right?

502
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:40,850
Speaker 1: There's a whole group of, you know, there's a whole like division that monitors space trash, right?

503
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:48,710
Speaker 1: And because if you're in space, like a screw that got loose from a satellite or something could be orbiting the earth really, really quickly.

504
00:28:48,870 --> 00:29:01,490
Speaker 1: And it's just a little screw, but if it hits your spaceship going really, really fast and your spaceship is just sitting still, this thing that there was no way you could see or avoid, you just destroy you by poking a hole in your spaceship.

505
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:08,910
Speaker 1: So, you know, in the future, when there's a bunch of people going to space, you need to have people who will go and clean up space junk.

506
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,050
Speaker 1: And that's what these people do, these characters.

507
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:21,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's sort of, I mean, it has this sort of overall, not really moral, but theme that space is awesome and it's the frontier of humanity.

508
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:22,750
Speaker 0: But at the same time.

509
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,509
Speaker 1: It's really dangerous.

510
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,450
Speaker 0: Space sucks and humans really aren't designed to deal with space.

511
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:34,710
Speaker 1: But also, I think the best message of Planetes is that, you know, if you're standing on the surface of the earth.

512
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,710
Speaker 0: You're still in space?

513
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,489
Speaker 1: You're in space.

514
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, everywhere is in space.

515
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,230
Speaker 0: Wait, wait to spoil the end of this first volume.

516
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,730
Speaker 1: Every place, no matter where you are, you're in outer space.

517
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,369
Speaker 0: God or the cat or whatever told us that in the end.

518
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:53,430
Speaker 1: So, this manga is, oh, it's not the greatest, right?

519
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:54,164
Speaker 1: It's like, it's OK.

520
00:29:54,591 --> 00:29:58,430
Speaker 0: I mean, so I didn't really have all the names of the characters straight.

521
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,306
Speaker 1: I don't know them at all.

522
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,268
Speaker 1: I forgot them all.

523
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,849
Speaker 0: Fi is the smoker, I think.

524
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:02,481
Speaker 1: OK.

525
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,650
Speaker 0: But she's not, like, she's one of the best characters and she's basically not in it after the very beginning.

526
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:07,609
Speaker 1: I think you're getting it.

527
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:13,570
Speaker 1: So, the thing is, I think the thing that hurts this compared to, say, a Space Brothers is in the Space Brothers.

528
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:19,870
Speaker 1: You're clearly focusing on the brother who's not as good at space as the brother who's already getting ready to go to space, right?

529
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:20,890
Speaker 1: He's the main character.

530
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:23,790
Speaker 1: In Planetes, there isn't really a main character.

531
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,510
Speaker 1: You have this crew and everyone's getting equal focus relatively.

532
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,810
Speaker 1: Even in Pat LeBourre, where all the characters kind of get focus, right?

533
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:34,248
Speaker 1: The main girl gets more focus than the other ones.

534
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:41,809
Speaker 0: The guy who kind of wants to die but won't admit it is basically the focus of the majority of this volume as a whole.

535
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,670
Speaker 0: In the beginning, it's a lot more...

536
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,530
Speaker 1: You mean the one who wants to go on the special mission with the dad?

537
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one who goes to Jupiter.

538
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,530
Speaker 0: Like, getting around the second half, it's mostly him.

539
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:50,590
Speaker 1: He does get a little bit more focus than the others.

540
00:30:50,791 --> 00:30:52,904
Speaker 0: Dude, if you count just the second half, it's like 80% focus on him.

541
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:54,927
Speaker 1: Yeah, the second half.

542
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,919
Speaker 1: But in the first half, there's the guy whose wife died, right?

543
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:04,510
Speaker 0: There's the girl who smokes and is loud, and that's basically her entire character.

544
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,649
Speaker 1: And then you get the new person who comes in.

545
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,309
Speaker 1: Clearly, they're going to get some time.

546
00:31:09,112 --> 00:31:10,950
Speaker 1: There isn't really this main focus.

547
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:20,070
Speaker 1: And while the characters are kind of cool, none of them really are cool enough to make you care about them a whole bunch.

548
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:27,890
Speaker 0: They come from the fact that it's presented as a series of vignettes that are linked, so it's not a straight linear narrative like this happened, then this happened, then this happened.

549
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:32,767
Speaker 0: It always kind of starts in media res in the middle of like, "Well, how did it come to

550
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:33,048
Speaker 0: this?".

551
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:37,450
Speaker 0: And then every story sort of peters out.

552
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:47,090
Speaker 0: They start in the middle of some drama, it sort of reaches a climax, but then it keeps going a little longer, and then just kind of peters out, and then the next story starts.

553
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:54,030
Speaker 1: And then as the plot progresses, not all the characters are still working on the junk collecting ship, right?

554
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,049
Speaker 1: Like the guys training to go on this mission.

555
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:59,530
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, somehow they're always together with each other.

556
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,230
Speaker 1: They always meet in space constantly.

557
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,310
Speaker 1: Are they always at the same space station, or are they always at the same moon base, or wherever the hell they are?

558
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:15,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, the setting is actually, at least if you read this volume, softer than you'd think for something that's otherwise pretty hard sci-fi, or at least trying to be hard sci-fi.

559
00:32:15,813 --> 00:32:17,510
Speaker 0: Because the setting's sort of fast and loose.

560
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:29,510
Speaker 0: There's those terrorists, and we have sufficient technology to have this space-faring humanity, and yet there aren't cameras to catch this dude just with a fucking briefcase bomb and a trench coat.

561
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,290
Speaker 1: Right, especially going into space.

562
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:38,690
Speaker 0: And there's gunfights everywhere with these terrorists, and yet somehow today we have technology that can pinpoint when a gun went off.

563
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:54,910
Speaker 1: And then meanwhile, while the space technology is very far advanced, and even the kid's little brother who's building rockets that are way more advanced than what kids can build today, all the other technology on Earth is just normal and not advanced in any way.

564
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate to say it, but...

565
00:32:57,051 --> 00:32:59,630
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like they have internet on Earth even, really.

566
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,990
Speaker 0: It deals a little bit with the hard sci-fi aspects of the technology, but it's actually pretty superficial.

567
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:28,978
Speaker 0: The art is very consistent in the technology side, and it sort of brings up all these ideas about radiation and everything, but then it treats them really simplistically, and doesn't say anything interesting about the technological advancement, and the focus is entirely on the human condition, and the sort of human exceptionalism, "We're built for space.

568
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,265
Speaker 0: We'll evolve to deal with space.

569
00:33:31,305 --> 00:33:32,067
Speaker 0: We'll be fine in

570
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:32,549
Speaker 0: space.".

571
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:39,089
Speaker 0: And it kind of skips over the fact that no, humans who stay in space for a long time are fucked up, and we can't get around that.

572
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:46,828
Speaker 1: I mean, Hajime No Ippo does a similar thing with boxing, where they sort of offhandedly comment like, "Man, you'll get fucked up in the head if you get punched in the head too

573
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:47,010
Speaker 1: much.".

574
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,765
Speaker 1: And like, "Oh no, is he punched drunk?

575
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:49,946
Speaker 1: Oh

576
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,207
Speaker 1: no.".

577
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:53,021
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh no, did his retina get

578
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:53,603
Speaker 1: dislodged?".

579
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,910
Speaker 1: It could be, but no one ever does.

580
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:56,390
Speaker 1: It never happens.

581
00:33:57,211 --> 00:34:02,530
Speaker 1: They just sort of mention it until you know it exists without it ever actually being a problem.

582
00:34:02,812 --> 00:34:08,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, like one guy, one side character dies of radiation poisoning, because you away a cancer from all the radiation in space.

583
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:12,110
Speaker 1: And the guy's wife dies of space junk, smashing the spaceship.

584
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:21,750
Speaker 0: But I guess the hard sci-fi elements of this are really simplistic to the point that it's actually just a human drama with a superficial space thing on top of it.

585
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,429
Speaker 1: Right, they don't explain any of the science-y bits in any way.

586
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:47,549
Speaker 0: Now the human drama is interesting, but the moral pretty much seems to be that the people who are pushing the frontiers are kind of the people who have sort of made this arbitrary distinction between space and Earth and are really just trying to get away from something in their lives and kind of want to die and have a pretty... Like, they want to go to Jupiter because they have a death wish.

587
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:51,830
Speaker 1: The thing is, the dad is the weirdest guy, right?

588
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:54,768
Speaker 1: Because he's almost like the crazy bunta character, right?

589
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,029
Speaker 1: From Initial D, if you don't know who that is.

590
00:34:57,311 --> 00:35:01,570
Speaker 1: Or if you're Naruto, the guy who does the sexy nojitsu.

591
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,550
Speaker 0: Oh, it should... I forget his name.

592
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,719
Speaker 1: The cool guy, right?

593
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,990
Speaker 1: He's that character, right?

594
00:35:07,714 --> 00:35:10,070
Speaker 1: He's the Hughes from Fullmetal Alchemist, right?

595
00:35:10,611 --> 00:35:12,189
Speaker 1: That's who the guy's dad is.

596
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,210
Speaker 1: And he's like the most badass astronaut.

597
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,790
Speaker 1: And he didn't want to go on the mission, but now he's leading the mission.

598
00:35:18,472 --> 00:35:20,930
Speaker 1: And it's like, I don't think he has a death wish.

599
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:21,757
Speaker 1: He doesn't.

600
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:27,238
Speaker 1: But it's like he still agreed to go on the mission even though he can totally... He knows everything.

601
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,290
Speaker 1: He knows everything, right?

602
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,521
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, the other main guy, his crisis of faith is that, "I'm going to die alone in space.

603
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:34,485
Speaker 0: We're astronauts.

604
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:35,068
Speaker 0: Fuck it, let's

605
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:35,349
Speaker 0: go.".

606
00:35:35,993 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 0: And simultaneously, "Oh no, but now I like this girl.

607
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,189
Speaker 0: If I have feelings for her, it will compromise my badass, cool and alone aloof.

608
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,005
Speaker 0: I'm going to die alone in space".

609
00:35:45,066 --> 00:35:45,410
Speaker 0: aesthetic.

610
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, but dad's perfectly okay to leave mom and his sons on Earth.

611
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:50,168
Speaker 1: He doesn't give a shit.

612
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:59,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the human drama moral is actually kind of ambiguous or at least kind of all over the place because it doesn't have this strong moral of, "See this guy?

613
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,359
Speaker 0: That's wrong.

614
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:00,904
Speaker 0: See this guy?

615
00:36:00,944 --> 00:36:01,125
Speaker 0: That's

616
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:01,448
Speaker 0: right.".

617
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,629
Speaker 1: It's more like a distinction between them.

618
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:13,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, it shows the person with their dilemma and the two options and the two moralities and they choose one, but even though they choose one of them, they're not totally sold on it.

619
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:19,990
Speaker 1: So it's still ambiguous if what they chose is right or wrong, if they did the right thing or not.

620
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,719
Speaker 1: It's just like, "Well, they chose this one.

621
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:23,690
Speaker 1: We know what both the options were.

622
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:25,703
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens in another

623
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:26,166
Speaker 1: volume.".

624
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,555
Speaker 0: So, I mean, yeah, I don't know.

625
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:31,909
Speaker 0: I can't super recommend this actually because it's kind of boring.

626
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:33,688
Speaker 1: It's weird though, right?

627
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:43,170
Speaker 1: Because it's one of those things where if someone brings it up amongst anime and manga peoples, you'll only hear really positive things about it.

628
00:36:43,472 --> 00:36:45,289
Speaker 1: I've never heard anyone say anything bad about this.

629
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:48,127
Speaker 1: I've only heard people say, "Oh, man, it's so

630
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:48,489
Speaker 1: good."

631
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:53,088
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, man, I've been really meaning to read that, watch that because it's so

632
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:53,350
Speaker 1: good.".

633
00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:01,742
Speaker 0: Now, I could say if I had picked up this manga in the '90s, if something like this just came out.

634
00:37:01,782 --> 00:37:10,290
Speaker 0: in the '90s or before I had much wider access to anime and especially to manga, this would have been so different from all the other manga I could read.

635
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:17,590
Speaker 1: It's still different from a lot of mangas, but there are some newer ones like aforementioned Space Brothers that go into similar territory, perhaps better.

636
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:32,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess there was a time when the average American anime fan would not run into a more slow-paced anime because even if that was available fan-subbed, that is not what was being trafficked around in the fan-subs.

637
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:34,130
Speaker 0: No one would give it to you or recommend it to you.

638
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,570
Speaker 0: They were the sort of inside business like, "Oh, hey, check out this show.

639
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,140
Speaker 0: It's just about some people living their lives.

640
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:40,288
Speaker 0: Whoa.".

641
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:47,190
Speaker 1: Now, I know we've sort of described it with a negative tone, but I don't want people to think that we're giving this an F.

642
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:47,675
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

643
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:48,323
Speaker 0: I'm giving this a B.

644
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,962
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is B. This is B territory.

645
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:52,270
Speaker 1: It's just not A territory.

646
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,149
Speaker 0: Like, it's good.

647
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,008
Speaker 1: It's like if you gave me volume two, I'd be like, "Aight, I'd read

648
00:37:56,028 --> 00:37:56,068
Speaker 1: it.".

649
00:37:56,431 --> 00:38:00,030
Speaker 1: But I don't think I'm going to pay money for volume two, right?

650
00:38:01,331 --> 00:38:02,576
Speaker 1: It's that kind of zone.

651
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:05,590
Speaker 1: Maybe if it was on sale, I'd be like, "Ooh, it's on sale.

652
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:06,216
Speaker 1: It's five bucks.

653
00:38:06,378 --> 00:38:07,066
Speaker 1: Aight, we're getting

654
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:07,309
Speaker 1: that.".

655
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,430
Speaker 0: It's a manga that after I read it once, I would sell it or give it away.

656
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,597
Speaker 0: I wouldn't keep it.

657
00:38:11,638 --> 00:38:13,230
Speaker 0: It's not going to sit on the shelf next to Sanctuary.

658
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty big and takes up a lot of shelf space for being an omnibus-type volume.

659
00:38:17,651 --> 00:38:19,690
Speaker 0: I think there's only four volumes total.

660
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,290
Speaker 1: Four big ones total?

661
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,362
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be four big ones.

662
00:38:23,382 --> 00:38:24,530
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually that long.

663
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,643
Speaker 1: Who's published this big one?

664
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:26,170
Speaker 1: Is it Dark Horse?

665
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:27,310
Speaker 0: Now you're not going to go do--.

666
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,990
Speaker 1: Just look at the side of the book, dumbass.

667
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,212
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

668
00:38:29,252 --> 00:38:30,226
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the Wikipedia.

669
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,168
Speaker 1: It is Dark Horse.

670
00:38:31,451 --> 00:38:32,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's done.

671
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,249
Speaker 0: It's only four volumes.

672
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,570
Speaker 1: Is it four Japanese volumes?

673
00:38:35,751 --> 00:38:36,449
Speaker 0: Four of these things.

674
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,387
Speaker 1: Four of the big ones?

675
00:38:37,552 --> 00:38:37,638
Speaker 1: Yeah.

676
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:38,353
Speaker 1: Okay.

677
00:38:38,877 --> 00:38:40,530
Speaker 1: So Dark Horse is publishing the big ones.

678
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,459
Speaker 1: There's only going to be three more.

679
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:42,570
Speaker 1: That's not too bad, actually.

680
00:38:43,213 --> 00:38:47,530
Speaker 1: I wonder if it actually has an ending, like they try to go on the mission and die or something?

681
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,510
Speaker 0: If this ends with the Jupiter mission, they all die, but they advance the frontier?

682
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,309
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's something else I got a question of, right?

683
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,850
Speaker 1: It's a Jupiter mission, which I assume they've been to Mars already?

684
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're already real fast and loose with time in this thing.

685
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,413
Speaker 1: Yeah.

686
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:06,390
Speaker 1: So if you go to Jupiter, that's not a good place to go.

687
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,590
Speaker 1: I mean, it's basically just a gas giant of doom.

688
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:14,550
Speaker 0: Well, they make this point about mining it for resources and using it as a staging point for further exploration.

689
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:19,310
Speaker 1: Are you just going to chill out in orbit around Jupiter and drop mining equipment onto it?

690
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,193
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

691
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:24,770
Speaker 0: This has all the trappings of hard sci-fi, but yet it glosses over all the stuff I'm interested in.

692
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,270
Speaker 1: Like, how the fuck are you going to go down there and do anything?

693
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,230
Speaker 1: I mean, if you even go near it, you'll probably just get crushed and stormed and red eyeballs stormed and who knows what.

694
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,650
Speaker 0: Well, thus my problem.

695
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,717
Speaker 0: Gas destroyed.

696
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:36,230
Speaker 1: It's not a place you can go near.

697
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,510
Speaker 0: You could tell this exact same story.

698
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,610
Speaker 1: I mean, if your spaceship gets too close to it, you'll just get sucked in and destroyed.

699
00:39:41,992 --> 00:39:43,044
Speaker 1: It's not a... I mean...

700
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:51,989
Speaker 0: Actually, Scott, I mean, you're making the sort of amateur... It's the same people on Slashdot who are like, "That couldn't work because I have a high school understanding of science and read the

701
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:52,250
Speaker 0: article.".

702
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,230
Speaker 1: I'm saying it could work, but they didn't cover any of this material, right?

703
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:02,330
Speaker 0: Well, what I'm saying is that this might as well be set in Portugal during the 1400s and be about wooden ships.

704
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:02,810
Speaker 1: Sure.

705
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,670
Speaker 0: And it could be the exact same story.

706
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:05,890
Speaker 1: That's absolutely right.

707
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:08,270
Speaker 1: But what are they cleaning up in the ocean?

708
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,294
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

709
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:09,658
Speaker 0: I don't know.

710
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,690
Speaker 0: They have some other job.

711
00:40:11,011 --> 00:40:12,502
Speaker 1: It would have to be more 20th century.

712
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:13,389
Speaker 1: cleaning up sea mines.

713
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:15,310
Speaker 1: Left over from war.

715
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,090
Speaker 0: But I guess it just doesn't... The technology and the space part of it is...

716
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,089
Speaker 1: Catching giant squids because they destroy all the ships.

717
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:27,650
Speaker 0: It's just weird for me to be able to say that a space-focused, space debris manga is actually really light on the space parts.

718
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

719
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,170
Speaker 1: It takes place almost entirely in space.

720
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:31,750
Speaker 1: But you know what?

721
00:40:32,192 --> 00:40:36,309
Speaker 1: It says a lot that I actually like the moments where they're in Japan a lot more.

722
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:39,070
Speaker 1: Hanging with the family and the kid building the rockets.

723
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:45,090
Speaker 1: Because when they're on Earth, that's when they're... It's almost like a breath of fresh air.

724
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:50,110
Speaker 0: Almost literally because the characters are all kind of going crazy being in space.

725
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:51,008
Speaker 0: Because space sucks.

726
00:40:51,350 --> 00:41:00,530
Speaker 1: And it does a really good job of showing you the contrast between the crampedness of space and you're still in outer space, but you're on Earth.

727
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:00,870
Speaker 0: Yeah.

728
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:01,970
Speaker 0: But here's an example.

729
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:07,563
Speaker 0: So it makes a deal about, in the beginning, you meet this adult-looking woman and then you find out, "Oh, she's 12.

730
00:41:07,563 --> 00:41:10,229
Speaker 0: She's just super tall because she was born in

731
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:10,590
Speaker 0: space.".

732
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:11,790
Speaker 0: She was born on the moon.

733
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,910
Speaker 1: And she can't go to Earth because she gets crushed.

734
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:15,850
Speaker 0: And it's sort of making this...

735
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,190
Speaker 1: I guess she definitely can't go to Jupiter.

736
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:23,050
Speaker 0: This implicit point that this is the next frontier for humans and that that is how humans will be.

737
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:24,130
Speaker 0: We're evolving for space.

738
00:41:24,551 --> 00:41:26,978
Speaker 0: The reality is, no, we're not.

739
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:30,928
Speaker 0: If you're born on the moon, it's not just you can't go to Earth.

740
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:31,570
Speaker 0: You're fucked.

741
00:41:32,192 --> 00:41:33,209
Speaker 0: It's not going to work out for you.

742
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,610
Speaker 1: Now, if you want to talk about anime and manga with a similar message, the number one of all time is Gundam.

743
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:49,630
Speaker 1: And even though Gundam is not even close to hard sci-fi, it is the softest, most fantastical, most ridiculous giant robot thing, it does that same message so much better.

744
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,229
Speaker 0: Well, because Gundam pushes it further.

745
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:54,409
Speaker 1: If you're having some tall girl who was born in space, you have new type.

746
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,295
Speaker 0: They're not human.

747
00:41:56,335 --> 00:41:57,642
Speaker 0: They're not even close to human.

748
00:41:57,702 --> 00:41:59,190
Speaker 0: They're so different from humans.

749
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:13,170
Speaker 1: And then, in Gundam, for whatever else you want to say about any Gundam series, whichever one you pick, I've never seen one that does a bad job of contrasting the parts where they're in space and when they're on a planet or in a space station.

750
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,070
Speaker 0: Even Gundam Seed does that really well, and that's kind of the pulpy Gundam.

751
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:17,391
Speaker 0: There's

752
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:33,170
Speaker 1: always some kind of scene where they're burning in the atmosphere going down, and they land, and then there's some other kind of scene where they take off in a rocket to go back into space, and when they're in space, the Gundams, and everyone moves and does things totally differently in space than when they're on the Earth.

753
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,308
Speaker 1: Manga does an amazing job of this even, too.

754
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,450
Speaker 1: Planetes isn't even learning from the Gundam, which came many, many years before itself.

755
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:43,691
Speaker 1: Things

756
00:42:43,731 --> 00:43:08,010
Speaker 0: like Gundam, by being more fantastical in some elements, they can sort of make the contrast of the human drama or the transhuman drama much more readily apparent and do much more interesting things, but something like Planetes is too close to reality, so it doesn't have enough contrast to work with, and simultaneously, despite being so close to reality, it actually ignores a lot of the implicit things that come up if you're that close to reality.

757
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:14,310
Speaker 1: I feel like the point of hard sci-fi is to teach some amount of real science to the audience, and they don't do any of that.

758
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:21,650
Speaker 0: Don't bring up the bone density thing, and then literally hand-wave it and never talk about it again in a manga that's set in the near future.

759
00:43:23,993 --> 00:43:26,210
Speaker 0: You can't lampshade it that superficially.

760
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:38,850
Speaker 1: So I think if you really need a manga to read, and you've read all the best ones, and maybe you read a lot of manga, you should definitely get this, but if you're just going to read one manga this month, not this one.

761
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:44,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, I almost want to read a Gundam manga, and then Pat Labore, and then...

762
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:48,036
Speaker 1: Just watch Pat Labore.

763
00:43:48,056 --> 00:43:53,650
Speaker 1: Pat Labore, I don't even know if there is a manga, I think there might be, but that's the thing where you want to watch the anime.

764
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,746
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

765
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:06,780
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

768
00:44:15,267 --> 00:44:19,860
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

771
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:59,200
Speaker 0: The Patrons, who are giving us at least $5, but possibly more in order of the amount of money they give us per month, are for this episode.

772
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:12,700
Speaker 0: Nicholas Brandau, Rebecca Dunn, John R. Knobs II, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, Jess, Sam Cordery, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenroes, you expected the next name to be yours, but it was me, Dio!

773

774
00:45:36,741 --> 00:45:45,880
Speaker 0: I'm going to open up submissions for the February Q&A tomorrow morning, because I want you to get all your questions in quick, and I'm going to announce the theme then.

775
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,360
Speaker 0: We may also, if we don't get enough questions, do something special on that episode.

776
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,262
Speaker 0: Stay tuned to ask your questions.

777
00:45:55,643 --> 00:46:06,400
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I know we missed a couple of shows here and there because I keep flying around London working everything, but after next week, when I'm in London, we pretty much have nothing that's going to disrupt Geek Nights for a while.

778
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:16,480
Speaker 0: Now, I know I always have weird stuff at the end, but I found something that I acquired quite some time ago as part of a package of similar things.

779
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:21,687
Speaker 0: This is from the days before even Napster, so I basically acquired this archive.

780
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:29,800
Speaker 0: that was someone's entire music collection, and inside of it, there was something that I didn't really notice until many years later.

781
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:34,804
Speaker 0: And once I realized what its deal was, it's kind of special.

782
00:46:35,545 --> 00:46:52,060
Speaker 0: I defy any of you to know what this is before I reveal in the forum, so if you recognize the thing that I'm going to play about now, let me know in the forum, because mad props, and also, how the hell did you encounter this thing?

783
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:39,570
Speaker 0: [MUSIC ENDS].
