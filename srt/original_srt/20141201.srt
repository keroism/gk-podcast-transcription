1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,647
Speaker 1: It's Monday, December 1st, 2014.

2
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:09,848
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,119
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,880
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:17,999
Speaker 1: Buying computers for other people.

6
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:21,219
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,219
Speaker 0: So in New York, we know it's a lot better idea to have a company manage your rent and building than have a person.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:33,636
Speaker 1: Yes.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,540
Speaker 0: Like some landlord.

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,280
Speaker 1: I really like the fact that my landlord is a faceless and uncaring entity.

11
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,518
Speaker 0: So my company was pretty good.

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,838
Speaker 0: But sometime earlier this year, what happened was they would send me an envelope every month to send my rent in.

13
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:52,520
Speaker 0: And one month I didn't get the envelope, so I couldn't send my rent.

14
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,440
Speaker 0: I had to figure out how to send it some other way.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,340
Speaker 1: I love how despite being the greatest city in the world, you basically can't pay your rent except with checks.

16
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I called them and I was like, "Hey, can we work on some kind of auto

17
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:02,600
Speaker 0: pay?".

18
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:08,776
Speaker 0: But it resulted in I paid a rent late because I couldn't send it on time because they fucked up.

19
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:13,060
Speaker 0: But they refused to waive the late fee, so I basically lost 70 bucks because they fucked up.

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,258
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Well, fuck, it's not worth

21
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:15,459
Speaker 0: it.".

22
00:01:15,985 --> 00:01:16,187
Speaker 1: Wow, 70?

23
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:17,920
Speaker 1: My late fee is $15.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,939
Speaker 0: Right, so yeah, fuck those guys.

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,140
Speaker 0: But anyway, after that, I was paying on time.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,220
Speaker 0: Everything went back to normal.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,979
Speaker 0: But fuck them, I want my 70 bucks back.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,720
Speaker 1: Still in small claims court.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,371
Speaker 0: Well, I switched and I went to my bank and I said, "Hey, bank, can you just mail them a check every

30
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:30,596
Speaker 0: month?".

31
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: I tried that once.

32
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,537
Speaker 1: You know what?

33
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:35,559
Speaker 1: That's why our landlord in Beacon was so pissed off at us all the time.

34
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:37,239
Speaker 1: Because it never fucking worked.

35
00:01:37,522 --> 00:01:39,558
Speaker 0: This actually worked when I did it.

36
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:41,120
Speaker 0: But there was a problem.

37
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:45,420
Speaker 0: You see, in August, the payment went out in late August for the September rent.

38
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:45,838
Speaker 1: Yep.

39
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:47,340
Speaker 0: And it went out as normal.

40
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:49,080
Speaker 0: And up until then, it had been working fine.

41
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:50,020
Speaker 0: And it did work fine.

42
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,460
Speaker 0: I can see in my thing that the check made it and cleared.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,318
Speaker 1: So they cashed it?

44
00:01:53,525 --> 00:01:53,759
Speaker 1: Yes.

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,360
Speaker 1: Now they say they didn't cash it, right?

46
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,080
Speaker 0: Two days after that, that check was sent by my bank.

47
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:03,260
Speaker 0: I got a letter under the door that was like, "Management company's changing.

48
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,792
Speaker 0: Send rents to this new

49
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:05,176
Speaker 0: place.".

50
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:11,779
Speaker 0: The new place apparently did not hear word of that rent, even though it was cashed.

51
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:22,499
Speaker 0: But the new place is actually, even though they fucked up the laundry room, you can just go to their website and pay online and go to their website and complain and go to their website and whatever you need to do.

52
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:26,139
Speaker 0: Even though it's sort of an old, cruddy, bad restaurant website, it works.

53
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,760
Speaker 1: Wow, that's actually more than I have in my laundry building here.

54
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,578
Speaker 0: I actually used that website to be like, "Hey, my fire alarm needs some

55
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:34,799
Speaker 0: help.".

56
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,399
Speaker 0: They came and fixed it right a fucking way.

57
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:36,800
Speaker 0: Wow.

58
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:37,519
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

59
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:37,830
Speaker 0: Nice.

60
00:02:38,522 --> 00:02:39,899
Speaker 1: Wait, how'd they fuck up your laundry room?

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,629
Speaker 0: They switched the machines out to a different company to manage the machines.

62
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:48,559
Speaker 0: that charges more money and makes you use a really annoying smart card system instead of quarters.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,080
Speaker 1: I would kill for a smart card system no matter how annoying.

64
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,780
Speaker 0: But now it's 75 cents more per washing machine.

65
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,318
Speaker 1: What do you pay?

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,780
Speaker 1: For me, it's $3.25 for the gigantic fucking... I can literally put every towel I own in there.

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,161
Speaker 0: I was paying $1.25, now I'm paying $2.

68
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,149
Speaker 1: Oh, it's $1.25 for our tank?

69
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:09,936
Speaker 0: It's now cheaper for me to just go to the laundry lady and have her do everything for me.

70
00:03:10,864 --> 00:03:11,471
Speaker 0: Except for laundry.

71
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,099
Speaker 0: I don't want to give them.

72
00:03:12,921 --> 00:03:19,479
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the machine is... The payment, the smart card is just annoying the way it works.

73
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,500
Speaker 0: It's even worse than RIT flex money or whatever.

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,698
Speaker 0: Anyway.

75
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:24,620
Speaker 1: I remember RIT flex money.

76
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the company is mostly good, as usual, as expected from a company.

77
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,139
Speaker 0: But they seem to have fucked up.

78
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:38,438
Speaker 0: Even though every single month I have made one rent payment every single month, this month they're like, "You owe twice as

79
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:38,680
Speaker 0: much.".

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,054
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "What the fuck are you talking

81
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:40,377
Speaker 0: about?".

82
00:03:40,701 --> 00:03:45,740
Speaker 0: If I pay twice as much, I expect to not pay again until late January for February's rent.

83
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,553
Speaker 0: And they're like, "Here's a record of all the payments you have sent

84
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:48,717
Speaker 0: us.".

85
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:52,820
Speaker 0: And I have sent them, the new company so far, three payments.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,020
Speaker 0: I sent them a payment in September for October.

87
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,079
Speaker 0: A payment in October for November.

88
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:02,040
Speaker 0: And... No, I said... September, October, November.

89
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,080
Speaker 1: November for December?

90
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:05,359
Speaker 0: Yes.

91
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,920
Speaker 0: I sent a payment in November for December.

92
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,657
Speaker 0: Fascinating.

93
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,798
Speaker 0: I'm trying to send the payment in November for December, you see, right?

94
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:16,985
Speaker 0: Yup.

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:25,700
Speaker 0: But they have accounted it such to where that payment that I sent in August to the old company, right, they do not have record of that.

96
00:04:26,383 --> 00:04:29,540
Speaker 0: And they thought that that was an August payment.

97
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:34,370
Speaker 0: So the payment that I sent them in September for October, they considered to be...

98
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,220
Speaker 1: So my only question to you is, has this resulted in a phone conversation with a human yet?

99
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,800
Speaker 0: No, I'm just emailing them instead.

100
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,139
Speaker 0: You can choose on their website how you want to talk.

101
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,560
Speaker 1: Alright, emailing's better.

102
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,559
Speaker 0: So I chose email, so I have documentation.

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,447
Speaker 0: But it's just like, I just sent the email that was like, "Uh, here...".

104
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:56,498
Speaker 0: I think yesterday I sent the email that was like, "Uh, why is my rent

105
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:56,640
Speaker 0: double?".

106
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:01,290
Speaker 0: And then just now I sent the letter that was like, "I think you fucked up.

107
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:02,600
Speaker 0: Why is everything...".

108
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:09,899
Speaker 1: It's funny that you have this problem, because just now our rent for December came, the little slip.

109
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,300
Speaker 1: So I'm like, alright, I guess it's my turn, so I'll pay it, because I'm the one I kind of semi-alternate on who pays it, just whatever.

110
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:27,060
Speaker 1: And I open it up, and I owed like over $6,000, because they didn't... They said that I owed this next month, December, and I'm late on October.

111
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:27,936
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

112
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,420
Speaker 1: November, November.

113
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,979
Speaker 1: God, we're bad with months.

114
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,877
Speaker 1: I think we're getting old.

115
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:37,400
Speaker 1: So Emily's like, "I paid it, and sure enough, we have a photo of the check.

116
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,468
Speaker 1: Like, we mailed it.

117
00:05:38,609 --> 00:05:39,719
Speaker 1: They didn't cash

118
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:39,780
Speaker 1: it.".

119
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:49,480
Speaker 1: So the trouble is, the last time that happened to me, like years ago, I remember like calling these people multiple times and being like, "You didn't get the check.

120
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:50,580
Speaker 1: You didn't get the check.

121
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,300
Speaker 1: Do not cash the check.

122
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,056
Speaker 1: If you get it, I'm going to send you another

123
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:54,358
Speaker 1: one.".

124
00:05:54,863 --> 00:05:56,640
Speaker 1: And of course, I mailed them another check.

125
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,116
Speaker 1: They then immediately, like within hours, cashed the check.

126
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,402
Speaker 0: Right.

127
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:04,680
Speaker 0: There's a person whose job it is, basically just open checks and stamp them and put them in.

128
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,558
Speaker 0: They don't think about them or care or have any like little list of like, "If you see this check, don't use

129
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:09,639
Speaker 0: it.".

130
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:14,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is, one, it cost me a lot of money to cancel a check, and two, I learned something.

131
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,978
Speaker 1: Cancelled checks are only cancelled for up to at most a year.

132
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,260
Speaker 1: So they're not actually cancelled forever.

133
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Speaker 0: So if someone gives me a check, and they cancel it on me.

134
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,300
Speaker 1: Eventually, the cancel expires unless they paid or renew it with most banks.

135
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:29,980
Speaker 0: So you write me a check.

136
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:30,800
Speaker 0: I go to the bank.

137
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,960
Speaker 0: The bank's like, "We ain't doing this.

138
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,205
Speaker 0: It got

139
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:32,639
Speaker 0: cancelled.".

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
Speaker 0: They give me the check back.

141
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,537
Speaker 1: Wait a few years.

142
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:35,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, they give the check back usually.

143
00:06:36,102 --> 00:06:38,879
Speaker 0: And then I wait a few years, then go use it again.

144
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:39,327
Speaker 0: Yeah.

145
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:40,420
Speaker 0: And then it'll work.

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,078
Speaker 1: That is what my bank told me when I asked them about this.

147
00:06:44,726 --> 00:06:45,259
Speaker 0: All right.

148
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,419
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Yeah, I'm not going to cancel the check.

149
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:51,638
Speaker 1: I'll just sue my landlord and small claims court if it comes to it.

150
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:52,334
Speaker 1: That will be

151
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 1: easier.".

152
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,579
Speaker 0: So I wonder what's going to happen here.

153
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,360
Speaker 0: I want to try to resolve it with this company as much as possible and not have to resort to other measures.

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:06:59,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

155
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:01,460
Speaker 1: The thing is, I've been itching.

156
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,019
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go to small claims court.

157
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:09,680
Speaker 1: But every time I've threatened someone with that, the situation has resolved amicably among adults.

158
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:22,080
Speaker 1: So I guess I need to get into a conflict with someone where I not only have documentation that I'm correct and that they owe me verifiable damages, but where that person is not an adult.

159
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:24,819
Speaker 1: But also not a minor by age.

160
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,460
Speaker 1: They need to be above 18, yet not actually act like an adult.

161
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:32,099
Speaker 1: And somehow have gotten into a situation where they owe me money.

162
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,459
Speaker 1: I don't think that is likely to ever happen to me in my life.

163
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:38,500
Speaker 1: So I got a bunch of news here.

164
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:39,060
Speaker 1: It's Monday.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,500
Speaker 1: We're finally back from Thanksgiving.

166
00:07:40,781 --> 00:07:44,120
Speaker 1: I had way too much food and still reeling from the consequences.

167
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,360
Speaker 0: I still have extra food.

168
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:46,358
Speaker 1: I have extra farts.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,090
Speaker 0: Okay.

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,118
Speaker 0: I have lots of farts too.

171
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a surplus of farts if anyone would like to borrow some.

172
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,760
Speaker 1: We also had multiple Thanksgivings.

173
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,940
Speaker 0: You should play the South Park game.

174
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,856
Speaker 0: A lot of farting going on.

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,980
Speaker 1: So there's a story here about, you know, it's politics, but Scott and I, and you at least should be, are mad about gerrymandering.

176
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:07,960
Speaker 1: Or gerrymandering if you know how that guy's name was pronounced.

177
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, how's your animated gif going over there?

178
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is Eldridge Gary.

179
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:22,720
Speaker 1: So anyway, we're mad about it and a bunch of scientists, a bunch of mathematicians, decided to try to apply technological solutions to this.

180
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,520
Speaker 1: They started studying gerrymandering and studying.

181
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,440
Speaker 0: We should study to see if the gerrymandering they do is even optimal.

182
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,558
Speaker 0: Like if you wanted to be evil, could you be even more evil than they are now?

183
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 1: So they basically proved that gerrymandering as it is done now does not just wash out and evenly corrupt.

184
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,720
Speaker 1: It's actually really biased toward Republicans.

185
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,380
Speaker 1: And two, it kind of shows.

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,199
Speaker 0: So why don't Democrats undo it?

187
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:53,739
Speaker 1: They can't because Republicans control the state legislatures that make these decisions.

188
00:08:54,782 --> 00:09:08,560
Speaker 1: So basically the Republicans got control right before the Census in 2010 and as a result they'll basically have control until the demographics are so skewed Democrat that even maximum gerrymandering can't get them in office anymore.

189
00:09:09,822 --> 00:09:13,860
Speaker 1: I'm going to quote something from this, but basically they tried different simulations and models.

190
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:23,300
Speaker 1: Like they do a thing where run every possible combination of district lines and figure out the most crazy things you could do based on the actual votes.

191
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,417
Speaker 1: Like that kind of stuff.

192
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:27,740
Speaker 1: "The results were startling.

193
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:39,960
Speaker 1: After rerunning the election a hundred times with a randomly drawn nonpartisan map each time, the average simulated election result was seven or eight House seats for the Democrats and five or six for the Republicans.

194
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:45,220
Speaker 1: The maximum number of Republican seats that emerged from any of the simulations was eight.

195
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:53,840
Speaker 1: The actual outcome of that election was four Democrats and nine Republicans, which is statistically impossible.

196
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,794
Speaker 1: It's not likely to

197
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:56,116
Speaker 1: occur.".

198
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,840
Speaker 0: So they're really, really good at gerrymandering.

199
00:09:59,241 --> 00:09:59,680
Speaker 1: Exactly.

200
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,179
Speaker 0: That's surprising.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,979
Speaker 0: I thought they would find that they weren't good at gerrymandering and could have done an even more corrupt job.

202
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,560
Speaker 1: No, they're amazing at gerrymandering.

203
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,836
Speaker 0: Who is doing this gerrymandering?

204
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,179
Speaker 0: It's like the representative is sitting there drawing maps.

205
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:12,502
Speaker 0: Well,

206
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:32,140
Speaker 1: actually it turns out they do just drag and draw it manually because it's really easy to figure it out because basically people who tend to vote Democrat or third parties that aren't Libertarians, like Green Party, they live in tightly packed urban districts and everybody else is spread out among thinly packed conservative districts.

207
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:35,700
Speaker 1: So it's actually really easy to gerrymander.

208
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:41,820
Speaker 1: But it has to be active because if it's random, it doesn't occur, even in extensive simulation.

209
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:57,240
Speaker 1: The reason I bring this up is one, it's easy to be mad about political things, but if you want to be really mad about politics, we need verifiable, scientific, objective, quantifiable politics.

210
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,140
Speaker 0: Well, at least if it's a democracy.

211
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:02,099
Speaker 0: Only a democracy has math.

212
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,540
Speaker 1: It's kind of like what Lawrence Lessig's trying to do with that secretary.

213
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,719
Speaker 0: Other types of government do not have math.

214
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,740
Speaker 0: A king doesn't use the numbers.

215
00:11:10,042 --> 00:11:12,640
Speaker 0: The only number a king needs is one.

216
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:13,689
Speaker 0: I'm the king.

217
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:14,659
Speaker 0: Deal with it.

218
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,439
Speaker 1: Well, the Soviets had to count how many boots they said they made.

219
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,620
Speaker 0: That's economics, not politics.

220
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,400
Speaker 1: The politics, they would say how many boots they made, thus pushing the politics forward.

221
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,240
Speaker 0: Sure, but democracy is not capitalism.

222
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,840
Speaker 1: But look at Lawrence Lessig's thing.

223
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:40,099
Speaker 1: The Super PAC failed to achieve a lot of the results it wanted in the election, but they gathered empirical data and are going to attempt to use that data to come up with models of how to effectively intervene.

224
00:11:40,601 --> 00:11:40,822
Speaker 0: Move.

225
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:45,119
Speaker 0: Everyone move, and they can't move the district faster than we can move our butts.

226
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,240
Speaker 1: Should we move to a red state district in the middle of nowhere and vote Democrat?

227
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,279
Speaker 0: Are a thousand other nerds moving with us?

228
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:53,186
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,559
Speaker 1: Is there internet out there?

230
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,940
Speaker 0: Will we be able to bring enough nerds to set up internet out there?

231
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:01,700
Speaker 1: I think the chicken egg problem is pretty decidedly on.

232
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,300
Speaker 1: Nerds won't go where there's not internet.

233
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,940
Speaker 0: Google, build an office there or some shit.

234
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:25,280
Speaker 1: So, the moral of this, everyone should read this, because regardless of your political affiliation, though if you're conservative, you're wrong, but regardless of your political affiliation, this is empirical evidence of straight-up objective corruption that is trivially fixed by the minimal application of technology.

235
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:26,926
Speaker 0: Soccer?

236
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:27,580
Speaker 0: Same thing?

237
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, same thing.

238
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:42,460
Speaker 0: I actually saw a soccer game this weekend, or at least a part of one, and the ref actually had a little wristwatch thing that told him when the ball went in the goal, and he used it, and he got a call right that he probably would have gotten wrong otherwise.

239
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,125
Speaker 1: Scandal.

240
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,120
Speaker 1: It's ruined football.

241
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:44,955
Speaker 0: I know.

242
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,454
Speaker 1: So, in other news, you know we talk a lot, you and me, about how as much as the U.S.

243
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:55,800
Speaker 1: is bad about things, it's the least bad country in the world at regulating the internet.

244
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,939
Speaker 0: It's not the least bad, but in terms of regulating internet, you can do a lot worse.

245
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,479
Speaker 1: ICANN, ARPA level.

246
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,620
Speaker 1: Regulating, like, interchanges.

247
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,499
Speaker 0: Most of the countries on Earth, not all, but most, are worse than us in terms of internet censoring and such.

248
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Speaker 1: So the EU has once again proven why we can't let Europe have any control specifically.

249
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:18,699
Speaker 1: With their anti-free speech.

250
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,220
Speaker 0: Well, we already knew about their right to be forgotten, which is not a right.

251
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,112
Speaker 0: Which they're making worse.

252
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,140
Speaker 1: They're still fighting that.

253
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,600
Speaker 1: When I have another news I'm not talking about.

254
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,700
Speaker 0: Google should just give them the finger and be like, "Fuck you.

255
00:13:29,221 --> 00:13:31,820
Speaker 0: If you ask for the right to be forgotten, we'll increase your search rank.

256
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:32,325
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

257
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,980
Speaker 0: We don't have to do what you say.

258
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,100
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to enforce it and make us enforce it in Europe only?

259
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:38,207
Speaker 0: No Google for Europe.

260
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,216
Speaker 0: Google's blocked in Europe.

261
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:39,559
Speaker 0: Good luck.

262
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:40,426
Speaker 1: Go fuck

263
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:40,816
Speaker 1: yourselves.".

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,478
Speaker 1: The European Parliament, the EU, That's what they should do.

265
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,678
Speaker 1: has voted in favor of forcing Google to be broken up.

266
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:51,441
Speaker 1: As a solution to complaints that it favors-- To what?

267
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,520
Speaker 0: A search company and a bunch of crappy worthless companies?

268
00:13:54,681 --> 00:13:56,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read the resolution.

269
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,520
Speaker 1: They don't fucking know what they're talking about.

270
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:05,917
Speaker 0: But it's not like Microsoft where you can be like, "Okay, we'll break apart the Xbox division, and we'll break apart the Office division and the Windows

271
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:06,379
Speaker 0: division.".

272
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:08,088
Speaker 0: It's Google.

273
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,300
Speaker 0: All that makes fucking money for Google is search.

274
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
Speaker 0: All the other things at Google are minuscule tiny garbage companies.

275
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,927
Speaker 1: If you were going to break it up, I guess you could do-- Oh, no.

276
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:21,360
Speaker 0: You could break Android off of Google, but Android doesn't really make any fucking money.

277
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:22,727
Speaker 1: You could break YouTube out.

278
00:14:22,748 --> 00:14:26,080
Speaker 1: You could break Google search apps, all that stuff out separately.

279
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,080
Speaker 0: YouTube can be a standalone company.

280
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,037
Speaker 1: Those are three things.

281
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,779
Speaker 1: And then advertising as a fourth thing.

282
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,940
Speaker 0: But advertising and search are the same thing.

283
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,019
Speaker 1: No, because if you say that, then YouTube and advertising are also the same thing.

284
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,322
Speaker 0: They are.

285
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,580
Speaker 0: The advertising is actually the only thing that makes money.

286
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, but look at how they broke up the Ma Bell back in the day.

287
00:14:45,062 --> 00:14:45,760
Speaker 0: By geography.

288
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,700
Speaker 1: Not just by geography, but also by business units.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:57,699
Speaker 1: So you'd basically have all these broken up pieces of companies doing business with each other just as separate companies instead of as divisions of the same company.

290
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,819
Speaker 0: Oh, so the Google search company will just have an AdSense account like you and me.

291
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,359
Speaker 0: Basically.

292
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

293
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:02,857
Speaker 1: It's stupid.

294
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 1: Luckily, even they realize that they have no power to enforce a breakup yet, but they're very happy with the vote.

295
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,179
Speaker 0: And basically, the EU, the European Parliament-- Google, just stop serving anything to Europe.

296
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Speaker 1: Individual European countries in general have been repeatedly going after Google as a monopoly.

297
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,155
Speaker 0: Because it's a U.S.

298
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:24,460
Speaker 0: company.

299
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,809
Speaker 0: If it was a European company, they'd be like,

300
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:26,414
Speaker 0: "Weeee!".

301
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:28,487
Speaker 0: They just don't like that.

302
00:15:28,507 --> 00:15:28,990
Speaker 0: some U.S.

303
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,680
Speaker 0: company has such power over Europe.

304
00:15:31,443 --> 00:15:33,020
Speaker 0: They're all European and proud.

305
00:15:34,423 --> 00:15:36,661
Speaker 1: Back in the old days of Slashdot-- In the

306
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:37,066
Speaker 1: U.S.,

307
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:38,139
Speaker 1: the same shit happened too.

308
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,952
Speaker 0: Like, "Don't buy them Japanese

309
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:40,657
Speaker 0: cars.".

310
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:45,580
Speaker 1: In the old days, remember when Microsoft-- Nerds would be like, "Oh, Microsoft is a horrible monopoly.

311
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,271
Speaker 1: They should be broken

312
00:15:46,373 --> 00:15:46,413
Speaker 1: up.".

313
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:48,040
Speaker 1: Europe tried to break it up.

314
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,338
Speaker 0: They were for like two minutes.

315
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

316
00:15:51,161 --> 00:16:00,460
Speaker 1: So, the only results of that were that web browsers, which were an integral part of operating systems in the modern era, had to be temporarily separated.

317
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,620
Speaker 1: And it was kind of just a stupid disaster that didn't actually achieve anything.

318
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, tech companies are often monopolies, right?

319
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,453
Speaker 0: Google does have a search monopoly now.

320
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:11,260
Speaker 0: There's no question.

321
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,060
Speaker 1: What Bing exists.

322
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:12,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, OK.

323
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,460
Speaker 0: Apple sort of has some kind of monopoly-ish, or at least a duopoly.

324
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,000
Speaker 1: It has a much larger market share and is growing faster at the expense of Apple.

325
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,868
Speaker 0: That sucks.

326
00:16:22,929 --> 00:16:23,860
Speaker 0: It's some kind of duopoly.

327
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,104
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's plenty of-- What-opoly?

328
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:28,820
Speaker 1: They're the minority in every market.

329
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,320
Speaker 0: Right, but those kinds of things-- Except, I guess, pads.

330
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:44,319
Speaker 0: A company that has superior technology, right, can dominate an entire industry quite easily, as Windows has in the past, as Intel basically is, sort of, right?

331
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:47,160
Speaker 0: And then they can wield power because of this.

332
00:16:47,342 --> 00:16:48,540
Speaker 0: Amazon can do this, right?

333
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:56,980
Speaker 0: However, a technology company is easily thwarted by superior technology, which comes along from smaller companies.

334
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,520
Speaker 0: That's the thing about technology.

335
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:03,640
Speaker 0: A tiny company like Google, coming out of nowhere, was able to beat all these other search engines.

336
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:07,138
Speaker 0: You could come out of nowhere and beat Facebook, right?

337
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,079
Speaker 0: Facebook came out of nowhere and beat Myspace, which was unthinkable.

338
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,680
Speaker 1: AOL is dead.

339
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,719
Speaker 1: In Europe, at least.

340
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,858
Speaker 1: Like, in the US, a scary number of people use Bing and use other search engines and stuff.

341
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:35,620
Speaker 0: Sure, you don't need to use antitrust to bust up technology companies, at least software companies specifically, because that's cheap to make, unless they're in power for an incredibly long period of time and no one has any chance of unseating them and they're wielding their power in unfair ways.

342
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing.

343
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,870
Speaker 0: You need to use your antitrust to bust up, say, Verizon.

344
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:54,860
Speaker 1: So, Google has over 90% of the search market in Europe, which is their main concern, and a lot of local people in Europe specifically complain about Google's search results as being unfair or unfairly favoring...

345
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,080
Speaker 0: Someone's always going to complain.

346
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,040
Speaker 0: Whoever's not first will always complain.

347
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:10,319
Speaker 1: I think search engine results should have basically the equivalent of common carrier protections, in that if you have an algorithm and the algorithm shows whatever search results, that's totally fine.

348
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:14,700
Speaker 0: The real core of the problem is that the algorithm is secret, right?

349
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,520
Speaker 0: And if it wasn't secret, people could game it, but while it is secret, you can't prove that it isn't rigged.

350
00:18:21,921 --> 00:18:23,780
Speaker 1: But who says you can't rig it?

351
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,498
Speaker 1: Who says it should be illegal to rig it?

352
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,720
Speaker 1: There's a first principle there.

353
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,860
Speaker 1: What does rigging entail?

354
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,440
Speaker 0: Because then it becomes... The phone book is an alphabetical order, right?

355
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,659
Speaker 0: So is the yellow pages.

356
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,760
Speaker 0: The yellow pages, you increase how much space you get by paying more money.

357
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:41,920
Speaker 1: It would not be illegal to put a phone book in order by who paid the most.

358
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:43,319
Speaker 0: No, it wouldn't be.

359
00:18:43,642 --> 00:18:45,279
Speaker 0: The yellow pages is exactly that.

360
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,420
Speaker 0: But it is a transparent system.

361
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,920
Speaker 0: You can't say you gave that guy preferential treatment and made his shit bigger for less money.

362
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,880
Speaker 1: It's not illegal to give someone preferential treatment for less money.

363
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,060
Speaker 0: It is if you're a common carrier.

364
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,560
Speaker 0: You're supposed to treat everyone equally.

365
00:18:59,382 --> 00:19:11,940
Speaker 0: So if the search engine results are supposed to be treating everyone equally using the same algorithm, but you're just secretly arbitrarily making your own links way higher rank, that's not really fair.

366
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,859
Speaker 0: Especially if it's your other businesses.

367
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 0: The thing about a monopoly that's illegal is using your monopoly power to help other shit out.

368
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,640
Speaker 0: That's why Microsoft got in trouble.

369
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,658
Speaker 0: They used their Windows monopoly to boost IE.

370
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,020
Speaker 1: It's not just helping.

371
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:25,320
Speaker 1: It's a little more narrow than that.

372
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,740
Speaker 1: They have to provide a specifically unfair competitive advantage.

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,800
Speaker 0: Right, so if Google ranks all YouTube results way high and down ranks other video sites results like Vimeo, that's an unfair advantage to YouTube.

374
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 0: if the Vimeo video is actually better for the same search query.

375
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,956
Speaker 0: You can't prove that they're not because the algorithm is a secret.

376
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,640
Speaker 1: Well except Scott, search for videos on Google video search and search for videos on YouTube.

377
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,960
Speaker 1: There's a reason why no one uses Google's video search because the results are not nearly as good as the YouTube results.

378
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,259
Speaker 0: No, yeah, but I'm saying if you do a search period just in regular Google, sometimes videos are results.

379
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,396
Speaker 1: Right?

380
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,713
Speaker 0: So what if there's a Vimeo video?

381
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:08,560
Speaker 0: that's a better result and it's getting down ranked?

382
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,495
Speaker 0: You wouldn't even know.

383
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 0: So even if Google is not doing that, they're not proving they're not doing that.

384
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,878
Speaker 1: I don't think there's a moral problem there because I just don't care.

385
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:22,960
Speaker 0: But people didn't care about Microsoft busting up IE.

386
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,020
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a moral problem.

387
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,680
Speaker 1: Actually a lot of people cared a lot about that very weirdly.

388
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,699
Speaker 0: There's a legal problem there.

389
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,199
Speaker 1: And actually I thought that busting the IE thing up was actually the worst possible way to go about that.

390
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:37,700
Speaker 1: I think that was a mistake.

391
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,760
Speaker 0: I think it was a mistake because the web browser was a free product.

392
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,839
Speaker 0: It wasn't even a business.

393
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,620
Speaker 0: But the video is a business.

394
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:58,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, I feel like with technology like search results, really the only way anyone should ever evaluate search results is by whether or not it achieves their personal goal.

395
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,739
Speaker 1: And frankly, if someone doesn't care that the search results are skewed, I don't care either.

396
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:08,534
Speaker 0: But even if you don't care that they are, it could even be on the level of racket.

397
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:15,180
Speaker 0: To where Google's basically like, "You want to go to search results all day?

398
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,393
Speaker 0: Better pay protection

399
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:16,677
Speaker 0: fees.".

400
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,879
Speaker 1: Except they don't have any business that lets you do that.

401
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,200
Speaker 0: They don't, but for all you know, they could be doing that.

402
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:29,440
Speaker 0: They could have partners, not like a web business that's on their site, but they could give preferential treatment to their partners and you wouldn't even know.

403
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:39,640
Speaker 1: That activity, one, even if it were illegal, which arguably it probably actually isn't, could probably even still be caught through normal means without actually going after the search engine itself.

404
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,212
Speaker 0: Sure, but we don't know.

405
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,720
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

406
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:52,780
Speaker 0: Because the algorithm is completely secret to anyone in the public, you basically, if you have a low rank, you assume because you're a conspiracy theory-minded nut that it's a racket.

407
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,075
Speaker 0: And if you have a good result, you're like, "Oh,

408
00:21:55,196 --> 00:21:55,398
Speaker 0: okay.".

409
00:21:55,641 --> 00:22:05,200
Speaker 1: But again, because it's technology, because it's relatively easy to compete with technology if you have superior technology, and it's primarily just software, there are plenty of other search engines.

410
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,919
Speaker 0: That all suck?

411
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,600
Speaker 1: And, I mean, Bing pretty much gives you equivalent results.

413
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
Speaker 1: It's not really better or worse for what most people search for.

414
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,597
Speaker 0: I mean, for normal searches, like, "Oh, I forgot the name of that

415
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:18,000
Speaker 0: website.".

416
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:19,266
Speaker 0: Or, "What's the URL?

417
00:22:19,286 --> 00:22:21,638
Speaker 0: I remember everything about this page, but I forget the

418
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 0: URL.".

419
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,040
Speaker 0: It's fine.

420
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,940
Speaker 0: But if you actually need to research something, good luck.

421
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:38,800
Speaker 1: But I feel like, technology-wise, I'm 100% okay with 100% black box searches, even if there's only one dominant provider, simply because, one, SEO people don't deserve jobs.

422
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,333
Speaker 1: Sure.

423
00:22:39,982 --> 00:22:41,380
Speaker 0: And, two, they're mostly dead anyway.

424
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:50,240
Speaker 1: If the results are actually unusable or are causing an actual problem, it would be trivial to then start competing with Google.

425
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:58,080
Speaker 1: The only reason you wouldn't be able to compete with Google right now is because your "on paper better" search engine isn't actually better.

426
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,940
Speaker 0: That's the other major problem, right?

427
00:23:00,702 --> 00:23:09,920
Speaker 0: I was just saying how someone with a tiny company, in software at least, can easily just make a better technology and compete with big boys, just like Facebook competed with Myspace.

428
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,040
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of super nerds use that.

429
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,520
Speaker 1: There's that DuckDuckGo search that all the super nerds and varchanners use.

430
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:25,675
Speaker 0: But the software of Google search is so ridiculously advanced that it would be -- it's the same reason.

431
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,960
Speaker 0: no one compete with Photoshop, right?

432
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,640
Speaker 0: It's just so hard to make any kind of competitor for that.

433
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:34,180
Speaker 0: The effort required, you could never catch up to that.

434
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:48,400
Speaker 1: Ah, but what I'm arguing is that if they were providing results based on some shady cabal that had the effect of making the search results less useful, then someone, by simply making search results that were actually useful, would beat them.

435
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:53,600
Speaker 1: And if they're not making them less useful, then there's no way -- But it's still a shady cabal?

436
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:55,999
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't matter.

437
00:23:57,421 --> 00:24:03,520
Speaker 0: Well, maybe they're still the most useful of all the search engines, but could be more useful.

438
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,640
Speaker 0: But they're not as useful as they could be, even though they're still the most useful because of a shady cabal.

439
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,900
Speaker 1: But if they could be more useful, then there would be space for a competitor.

440
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:20,120
Speaker 0: Ah, but that would be so difficult for the competitor to get into that space because Google is already so good.

441
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:33,619
Speaker 0: Like, if Photoshop just sat still and left room for improvement, and we started to catch up, and then they just moved a little bit ahead and always stayed one step ahead of us, and we couldn't catch them just because they're so big and so awesome.

442
00:24:35,662 --> 00:24:39,820
Speaker 0: As opposed to what they're actually doing, which is update Photoshop constantly and stay way ahead of everybody.

443
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:53,419
Speaker 1: Europe's answer to this perceived problem, which mostly rests around a lot of very specific and, in my opinion, really stupid complaints about the search results, are they want to break Google up because that's their solution to it.

444
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,360
Speaker 0: Yes, I would like to break up a lot of European companies, too.

445
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:56,881
Speaker 0: The U.S.

446
00:24:56,922 --> 00:25:02,020
Speaker 0: would love to break up Honda, Toyota, BMW, Volkswagen.

447
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,360
Speaker 0: Oh, wouldn't that be so great?

448
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,900
Speaker 0: Probably these American car companies.

449
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,100
Speaker 0: Just bust up all these European and Japanese car companies.

450
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:13,640
Speaker 0: One company per car, the Camry company, the Corolla company.

451
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,980
Speaker 0: You can't share engineers with each other.

452
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:17,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be great.

453
00:25:19,262 --> 00:25:21,660
Speaker 0: Every country wants to bust up all this country's shit.

454
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,220
Speaker 1: Blackberry released a new smartphone.

455
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,740
Speaker 0: Wait, Blackberry's still around?

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have Passport smartphones now.

457
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,018
Speaker 0: Okay.

458
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,440
Speaker 1: They call them the Passport.

459
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,360
Speaker 0: What does it look like?

460
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,899
Speaker 1: I'm pulling up a picture of it right now.

461
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,738
Speaker 1: I'm trying to pull up a picture of it right now.

462
00:25:35,364 --> 00:25:37,240
Speaker 1: Still trying to pull up, wow, the Blackberry side.

463
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,098
Speaker 1: Here we go.

464
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,340
Speaker 0: It's a square Blackberry.

465
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,580
Speaker 1: They're really fat and they have a square screen.

466
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,500
Speaker 0: Well, they're not fat thick, they're fat wide.

467
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,179
Speaker 1: Fat wide.

468
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,079
Speaker 0: But they're not tall.

469
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:46,637
Speaker 0: No.

470
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,060
Speaker 0: Even though they just said they sacrifice.

471
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,960
Speaker 0: Oh, no, look at that picture.

472
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,499
Speaker 1: That's still taller than my phone.

473
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,959
Speaker 1: That's really tall.

474
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:52,879
Speaker 0: It's not that tall.

475
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:56,919
Speaker 1: It's basically a tablet with a low resolution screen and an awful looking physical keyboard.

476
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,099
Speaker 0: So it looks like you can hold it in your hand.

477
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,039
Speaker 1: That's not the news.

478
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,039
Speaker 0: It's a one handed feeling.

479
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,580
Speaker 1: Blackberry is, this is literally, as far as I can say, their last gasp.

480
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,180
Speaker 1: They will give you cash if you trade your iPhone in for a Passport instead.

481
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,000
Speaker 0: What kind of iPhone?

482
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,902
Speaker 1: A 4S, they'll give you $90.

483
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:20,120
Speaker 0: No, I could just get that on your Mac.

484
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,103
Speaker 1: An iPhone 6, they will give you $400.

485
00:26:24,103 --> 00:26:26,320
Speaker 0: I spent more than $400 for my iPhone 6.

486
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically, they'll give you less than market value in credit toward their Passport smartphone.

487
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,040
Speaker 0: What are they going to do with my iPhone?

488
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,640
Speaker 0: Sell it on the internet, on Craigslist?

489
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,280
Speaker 1: That's what I'm wondering.

490
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:40,320
Speaker 1: If they give you money.

491
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,900
Speaker 0: Are they going to pay my cancellation fee at Verizon?

492
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:44,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't look like it.

493
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,620
Speaker 0: You're not helping.

494
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:51,380
Speaker 0: Also, why would you pay me to, you should, to downgrade, you need to make up for the difference.

495
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,300
Speaker 0: You need to give me money equal to the value between the quality of the iPhone and the quality of the body.

496
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:03,660
Speaker 0: You need to give me like the thousand dollars to make up for the quality difference between the two phones.

497
00:27:04,781 --> 00:27:11,080
Speaker 1: So basically, they're going to buy iPhones for under market value from people to get them to use their Blackberry Passport.

498
00:27:11,902 --> 00:27:16,200
Speaker 1: And then I guess resell those iPhones in the secondary market.

499
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,080
Speaker 0: Instead, you should just give people Blackberries for free, make them run Android or some shit.

500
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,820
Speaker 0: But you have the ability to make hardware, good hardware.

501
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,039
Speaker 0: You know, you have that ability.

502
00:27:27,166 --> 00:27:28,160
Speaker 1: I don't think they do anymore.

503
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,700
Speaker 0: Make the best Android phone that exists because it's not hard to make.

504
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,870
Speaker 0: Try making a small one.

505
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:38,940
Speaker 0: Put it out there and your brand still means something.

506
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,020
Speaker 0: If you made a high quality, small stock.

507
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,760
Speaker 1: I don't think their brand means anything, Scott, among people under the age of 48.

508
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:51,460
Speaker 0: If they made a high quality, small stock Android phone, which any of these phone companies could do, but none of them do, they could make a comeback.

509
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:56,840
Speaker 0: Instead of trying to be Blackberry, just don't be who you are anymore because who you are is bad.

510
00:27:57,121 --> 00:27:58,640
Speaker 1: They're definitely not capable of that.

511
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,618
Speaker 0: They're capable of it.

512
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,539
Speaker 0: If I was the CEO of Blackberry, I could make it happen.

513
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, the features include extra loud speakerphone, 350% louder than the Samsung Galaxy S5.

514
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,799
Speaker 0: That's a feature they've always had.

515
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,700
Speaker 1: The features of Blackberry basically scream, literally, I am old.

516
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:18,458
Speaker 0: I am designed by an old man.

517
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,899
Speaker 1: And I am for old.

518
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:26,600
Speaker 0: But that tells me the person who made that phone is so old, their hardware skills must be incredible.

519
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,267
Speaker 1: Maybe.

520
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,930
Speaker 0: They can make a really tiny, awesome phone.

521
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:32,160
Speaker 0: if only I was telling them what to make.

522
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,579
Speaker 1: So let's get this straight.

523
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:43,080
Speaker 1: Blackberry is basically saying, if you translate this advertising thing, our phones are so shitty, we have to pay people to use them.

524
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:43,698
Speaker 1: Yes.

525
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:50,300
Speaker 1: Or give us your iPhone so we can then resell it for a profit on the secondary market.

526
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,380
Speaker 0: Or, man, we're stuck with a warehouse full of shitty Blackberries.

527
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,079
Speaker 0: Maybe we can trick people to trade them for much better iPhones.

528
00:28:59,301 --> 00:29:00,620
Speaker 1: Oh, my God, it gets even better.

529
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,020
Speaker 1: You don't actually get a credit.

530
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:08,799
Speaker 1: You pay the full price of the phone and you get a Visa prepaid card with the credit on it.

531
00:29:10,404 --> 00:29:10,467
Speaker 1: Wow.

532
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:11,434
Speaker 1: Okay.

533
00:29:11,802 --> 00:29:14,680
Speaker 1: I'm amazed that -- if this company should really just take all the --.

534
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,479
Speaker 0: Has anyone done this?

535
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,298
Speaker 0: You know who's done this?

536
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,060
Speaker 0: Someone who stole an iPhone.

537
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:18,799
Speaker 0: Yup.

538
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,018
Speaker 0: That's who's doing this.

539
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,618
Speaker 0: Basically GameStop.

540
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,213
Speaker 1: Wow, the passport costs 600 bucks.

541
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,880
Speaker 0: Listen, tiny phones are expensive.

542
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,880
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who makes them.

543
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,579
Speaker 1: It's not that tiny.

544
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,379
Speaker 0: There's hardware in there that costs a lot.

545
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,260
Speaker 1: The Sony Z3C is only 640.

546
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:34,345
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,402
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe 540.

548
00:29:36,402 --> 00:29:43,359
Speaker 0: Listen, regardless of how well-designed your phone is or what software is on it, the pieces inside are expensive regardless of how you arrange them.

549
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:43,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

550
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:51,140
Speaker 1: What's the iPhone 6 if you buy it completely contractless and unsubsidized as well, like 750?

551
00:29:51,140 --> 00:30:01,189
Speaker 0: Just add up the price of all those parts separately, then add on the cost of the factory that puts them together and the labor and the testing and, you know, any phone that's modern is going to be 600, 700 bucks.

552
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,690
Speaker 1: So, things of the day.

553
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,789
Speaker 1: I got two tiny little things.

554
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,610
Speaker 1: So, Russian darts.

555
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:15,609
Speaker 1: This is just Russian darts.

556
00:30:16,755 --> 00:30:17,669
Speaker 1: Just watch this video.

557
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:21,190
Speaker 1: It escalates to the appropriate humorous point and then stops.

558
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:32,590
Speaker 1: So, my other thing, Scott and I talked about this a long time ago, but the video's from 2005 before we started doing Geek Nights publicly.

559
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,430
Speaker 1: So, it doesn't appear that we've ever actually used this as a thing of the day.

560
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,790
Speaker 0: It's way older than 2005.

561
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:41,711
Speaker 1: From Tom's Hardware, February of 2005.

562
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:43,170
Speaker 0: It feels older, but that's fine.

563
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,490
Speaker 1: Uploaded in 2006.

564
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,890
Speaker 1: This was uploaded to YouTube.

565
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,569
Speaker 0: I remember downloading this video, downloading, in video file format before YouTube, like, it was a thing.

566
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,950
Speaker 1: This was uploaded by some guy.

567
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:59,489
Speaker 0: This exact video, I have the files for it.

568
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:13,830
Speaker 1: So, the video, nowadays computers are a lot more sophisticated, but this was a time where if you took the heat sink off of a CPU, the magic smoke would come out in many cases, especially with AMD chips, before you finished taking the heat sink off.

569
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,930
Speaker 0: Well, this was like the era where we did the most computer building in late college, right?

570
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:20,810
Speaker 0: With Pentium 3s, Pentium 4s, AMD Athlons.

571
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, right up pretty much from the K7 800 up through the Thunderbird era.

572
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:26,961
Speaker 0: Right.

573
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:36,628
Speaker 0: So, basically, the deal was is that if you took the heat sink off an Intel chip, the Intel chip would go, "Oh my God, I'm hot," and it would just stop at doing anything because it was too hot.

574
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:41,830
Speaker 0: The AMD chip was dumb as a brick and would go, "Keep doing stuff," and then set on fire without the heat sink.

575
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,130
Speaker 1: Now, keep doing stuff, it had a couple of milliseconds of keep doing stuff.

576
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,789
Speaker 0: Listen, it doesn't take that long.

577
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:50,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Intel Pentium 3 1000.

578
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,530
Speaker 0: The Pentium 4 was even more advanced.

579
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:59,070
Speaker 0: It would stop processing, and if you put the heat sink back on, as soon as the temperature went down, it would start doing stuff again.

580
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:09,410
Speaker 1: It's just amazing to watch that all the Intel chips, the game just crashes, and then the chips are pretty much okay, and all the AMD chips, you take it off, and smoke just starts billowing out of the chips immediately.

581
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:25,090
Speaker 0: Now, this is something that most people would never even encounter because they don't take their heat sink off their CPU ever, so it doesn't seem like a worthwhile feature to pay for, but it's little things like this that are the reason why I stick with Intel over AMD through this day.

582
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:29,950
Speaker 0: The reasons like this are the reasons why I stick with Nvidia over ATI to this day.

583
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,869
Speaker 0: Even if those other companies make up for it, and this is only one example, I'll give you another example, right?

584
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,930
Speaker 0: So, this is a very tiny thing that most people will never notice.

585
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:45,010
Speaker 0: We had built an HTPC, the first one we built, and I had an ATI GPU in there.

586
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,890
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, because it had that S-video port on the back.

587
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,150
Speaker 0: I had an ATI GPU in there, ATI video card, and we plugged in an S-video cable, and when you turned the computer on, you couldn't see anything on the screen.

588
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,149
Speaker 0: It wasn't until the OS loaded and the driver loaded that it showed anything on the TV.

589
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:03,949
Speaker 0: It would only output to the VGA port when you turned the computer on.

590
00:33:04,411 --> 00:33:13,870
Speaker 0: But, with the Nvidia video card, it doesn't matter if it was the VGA, S-video, or whatever other video port on there, you could see the BIOS posting on all those video outs.

591
00:33:14,271 --> 00:33:23,690
Speaker 0: A very small feature, almost no one would notice that, but it makes a big difference if you're trying to set up an HTPC, and I'm sure maybe these things have been fixed in more modern hardware.

592
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a lot of these things are anecdotal.

593
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,446
Speaker 1: It just so happened that...

594
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,130
Speaker 0: Right, that one particular card we had, right, that we happen to have, that cheapo one, right?

595
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:32,048
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

596
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,010
Speaker 0: It might not even be the GPU's fault.

597
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,990
Speaker 0: It might be the card maker's fault in that case.

598
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,109
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it shows something else too.

599
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,950
Speaker 1: People seem to... Nowadays, it's really easy to build a computer.

600
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:41,408
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

601
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:48,749
Speaker 1: But, back in the day, if you put the wrong RAM chip in a computer, you might literally ruin the CPU and the RAM chip.

602
00:33:49,551 --> 00:34:06,023
Speaker 1: Like, you could mess up installing a computer in non-obvious ways, and when I used to build computers, like the first time you post it, you turn it on, there was the crippling fear that it wouldn't post, because if that happened, nowadays, usually that just means, yeah, you've got to plug something in.

603
00:34:07,293 --> 00:34:08,830
Speaker 1: Or, power supply is not powerful enough.

604
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,489
Speaker 1: In the old days, it was even odds that that meant you broke something.

605
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:13,529
Speaker 0: You're fucked.

606
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,790
Speaker 1: You ruined something, and there's no way to tell what.

607
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:16,306
Speaker 0: Yep.

608
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,899
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's little things like that.

609
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:26,170
Speaker 0: that just, you know, I've seen throughout history, the reasons for certain brand loyalties, and they have never steered me wrong so far.

610
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:32,190
Speaker 0: When I had AMD's for a long period of time, I have a bunch of AMD CPUs.

611
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:34,070
Speaker 0: Why do I have so many AMD CPUs?

612
00:34:34,411 --> 00:34:35,869
Speaker 0: Oh, that's why.

613
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:42,089
Speaker 0: That's why I don't have as many Intel CPUs, because they didn't fuck up and never had to be replaced.

614
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:42,641
Speaker 1: Yep.

615
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,509
Speaker 0: Why do I have a bunch of AMD power supplies?

616
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:46,788
Speaker 0: Oh, that's why.

617
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:53,609
Speaker 1: Well, part of that, too, is that the curve of power, like the Pentium 4 was way expensive for how fast it was.

618
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,982
Speaker 1: Yep.

619
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,750
Speaker 1: So the K7s came in, they're like, yeah, we're way faster and way cheaper.

620
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,309
Speaker 0: You're faster like the way a hot rod is faster.

621
00:35:01,657 --> 00:35:01,850
Speaker 0: Yep.

622
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,110
Speaker 0: Leaving fire all over the ground.

623
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,829
Speaker 1: And you know what?

624
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,910
Speaker 1: It wasn't until, like, past the Core 2 Duo that I was like, yep, Intel.

625
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,530
Speaker 0: The Core 2 Duo is when Intel retook the throne.

626
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:13,385
Speaker 1: Yep.

627
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:14,843
Speaker 1: And remained in it.

628
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,409
Speaker 1: And now, like the Core, like the i5, i7, I can't imagine buying a non-Intel CPU.

629
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:23,510
Speaker 0: So I would like to see someone make one that I could believe in, but no one has.

630
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,770
Speaker 1: Should we break them up with their monopoly?

631
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:29,030
Speaker 0: They are, but they're not using their monopoly power to any evil effect.

632
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,528
Speaker 0: How do you know?

633
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:32,410
Speaker 0: What are they doing with their CPU monopoly?

634
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:35,790
Speaker 1: Maybe they're using it as monopolized engineering resources that no one can ever-.

635
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,409
Speaker 0: An example of something Intel could do is be like, you know what?

636
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:44,530
Speaker 0: We're gonna make our Intel CPUs such that the only OS that will run on our computers is Intel OS.

637
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:45,568
Speaker 0: Fuck everyone else.

638
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,730
Speaker 0: Fuck you, Microsoft.

639
00:35:47,031 --> 00:35:47,589
Speaker 0: Fuck you, Linux.

640
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,889
Speaker 0: Fuck you, OS X. Everyone has to use Intel OS now or use some other CPU.

641
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,208
Speaker 0: And you think everyone's gonna use some other CPU?

642
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:57,647
Speaker 0: 'Cause there isn't one.

643
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,789
Speaker 1: Remember the alpha chips?

644
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,189
Speaker 0: DEC alpha?

645
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,749
Speaker 0: Those are not for normal people.

646
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a time- That's way earlier than- You used to be able to run Windows on that shit.

647
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,709
Speaker 0: That was a ridiculously long time ago.

648
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

649
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,208
Speaker 0: It's not even relevant.

650
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:16,530
Speaker 1: So in- Oh, you gotta think of the day.

651
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:17,206
Speaker 0: I do.

652
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,790
Speaker 0: So there's a thing I learned about called mispronounced incoming Schleren optics.

653
00:36:23,811 --> 00:36:33,509
Speaker 0: So I'd still, even after reading Wikipedia and a whole bunch of different documents and watching YouTube videos, I only marginally understand how this works.

654
00:36:34,511 --> 00:36:53,527
Speaker 0: Basically, with the combination of a point light source that's really bright, a razor blade, the kind you shave with, a big awesome mirror, and some other reflecting type things, you can look into the mirror and actually see basically the density of air.

655
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,640
Speaker 0: So if you look at a lot of the example videos, someone will be lighting a candle or blowing a fan.

656
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:10,570
Speaker 0: Something that heats up the air or maybe an ice cube or something that makes air have different refractive indexes.

657
00:37:11,152 --> 00:37:13,268
Speaker 0: And then you look into the mirror and it's like, "Whoa, you can

658
00:37:13,308 --> 00:37:13,429
Speaker 0: see.".

659
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,328
Speaker 0: And as soon as you see what this looks like, you're like, "Oh, I've seen that before

660
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:16,590
Speaker 0: somewhere.".

661
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:18,109
Speaker 0: That sort of effect.

662
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,070
Speaker 0: Well, it's called Schleren optics.

663
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:25,530
Speaker 0: And if you read, maybe you can figure out how it works better than I can.

664
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,330
Speaker 0: The razor blade is the really confusing part.

665
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,132
Speaker 1: Yeah.

666
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:34,950
Speaker 1: It's like when I was in high school physics and we were learning about polarization and quantum stuff.

667
00:37:35,591 --> 00:37:38,570
Speaker 1: And the teacher did the experiment with the strange attractors.

668
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,930
Speaker 1: He puts a polarizer, then he puts another one, and now there's no light going through it.

669
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:45,970
Speaker 1: Then he puts a third polarizer between the two and light came through again.

670
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,640
Speaker 1: And I was like, "What the

671
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,189
Speaker 1: fuck?".

672
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:49,969
Speaker 1: And then it took him the entire class to actually explain it.

673
00:37:50,771 --> 00:37:51,272
Speaker 0: Right.

674
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:56,950
Speaker 0: So here's some videos of this Schleren optics that you can watch for awesomeness.

675
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:04,790
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Book Club book is Watership Down, the classic tale of rabbit adventure, rabbit cultists, and rabbit fascists.

676
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,170
Speaker 0: How about the next Book Club book, which is Fire Car Up?

677
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott, I'm done with Watership Down.

678
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:13,130
Speaker 0: I read it.

679
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,139
Speaker 0: Isn't it like a kid's book?

680
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,130
Speaker 0: I'm sure it won't take me long.

681
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,693
Speaker 1: It's 413 pages.

682
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,783
Speaker 0: That is much longer than I expected.

683
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:19,529
Speaker 0: What's the font size?

684
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,725
Speaker 1: The first edition, so normal book from the '70s, was 413 '70s book pages.

685
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:29,810
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I have it on Kindle, so I'm gonna get readin', I guess.

686
00:38:30,591 --> 00:38:31,536
Speaker 1: I really liked it.

687
00:38:32,118 --> 00:38:34,369
Speaker 1: Also, I need you to give me a link so I can actually post it.

688
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,730
Speaker 0: Uh, why do you need me to give you a link?

689
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,545
Speaker 1: So we get money if you click on it and buy it.

690
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:40,110
Speaker 1: I need the referral link.

691
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:40,670
Speaker 0: Our secrets!

692
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:41,737
Speaker 1: Yeah.

693
00:38:42,993 --> 00:38:44,730
Speaker 1: So guys, if you want to support Geek Nights, buy the book.

694
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:54,990
Speaker 0: If you buy a Book Club book and you click the link that is on our site when you bought that book, it is an Amazon affiliate link, and we get a ridiculously small amount of money if you do that.

695
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:58,470
Speaker 1: If you buy other things in that same session, we also get some money.

696
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,870
Speaker 0: It's also a ridiculously small amount of money.

697
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:07,310
Speaker 1: But if you're gonna buy a couple of HDTVs and a new computer, might as well buy Watership Down along the way.

698
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:14,370
Speaker 0: But also make sure to go to smile.amazon.com so that money will go to the charity of your choice, which cannot be us.

699
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:14,985
Speaker 0: Yes.

700
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,169
Speaker 0: I wonder if it's possible to get an affiliate fee and the Smile charity at the same time.

701
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:23,190
Speaker 0: Or is it just the affiliate fees that go to the Smile charity?

702
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:24,161
Speaker 1: I'm not 100% sure.

703
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:25,270
Speaker 0: Yeah.

704
00:39:25,451 --> 00:39:26,769
Speaker 0: I was never quite clear on how that works.

705
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:31,330
Speaker 0: My Smile charity keeps changing between Creative Commons and Child's Play, and I can't keep it under control.

706
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,745
Speaker 0: It keeps wanting to switch around, and I'm like, "What are you

707
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:34,088
Speaker 0: doing?".

708
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:34,770
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,892
Speaker 1: Actually, I was looking into.

710
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:39,942
Speaker 1: Child's Play has launched a thing where we can set up an account.

711
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:43,030
Speaker 1: that is an event runner account, not just a donator account.

712
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,970
Speaker 1: And basically, you don't even really need a lot of permission.

713
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:53,849
Speaker 1: We can do any arbitrary event, and there's just a widget we put, and the widget, it just credits us like, "Yeah, these guys caused that donation to

714
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:54,090
Speaker 1: happen.".

715
00:39:54,171 --> 00:39:55,830
Speaker 1: But otherwise, we don't even touch the money.

716
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,990
Speaker 1: It just goes straight to Child's Play.

717
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:08,470
Speaker 1: So if you can think of a cool thing that you would donate money for me and Scott to do, we will consider doing some sort of live stream where if you keep putting money in, we'll keep doing that thing.

718
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:10,289
Speaker 1: Maybe a DDR-a-thon?

719
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:10,901
Speaker 1: I don't know.

720
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:15,290
Speaker 0: I do not think we would survive a very long DDR-a-thon.

721
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,950
Speaker 1: Well, you know how Desert Bus works, right?

722
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,149
Speaker 0: Keeps switching off?

723
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:18,498
Speaker 0: No.

724
00:40:19,194 --> 00:40:19,870
Speaker 1: People switch off.

725
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,010
Speaker 0: Oh, we increase the price of doing another song?

726
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,050
Speaker 0: We should also multiply by the number of feet in the song.

727
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:26,714
Speaker 0: Ooh.

728
00:40:27,331 --> 00:40:28,703
Speaker 0: Oh, you want us to do Dropout?

729
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,230
Speaker 0: All right, well, it's going to be like a bajillion dollars.

730
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:32,867
Speaker 1: You're going to give $1,000 to Child's Play?

731
00:40:32,907 --> 00:40:33,150
Speaker 1: Okay.

732
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:36,122
Speaker 1: Rym will do Dropout, and then, "Oh, look, Rym passed out because he's an old man.

733
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,065
Speaker 1: He can't DDR

734
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:37,507
Speaker 1: anymore.".

735
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:39,277
Speaker 0: Max 300?

736
00:40:39,277 --> 00:40:41,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll be the rest of the money we're trying to raise.

737
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:49,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, old man Rym, I think I am physically incapable of passing max 300 on Maniac at this point.

738
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,630
Speaker 0: I am definitely.

739
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:52,217
Speaker 1: I did it once.

740
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:54,969
Speaker 1: There was a time when I could barely do it.

741
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:59,270
Speaker 1: I don't think I can move my feet fast enough to do it.

742
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,129
Speaker 1: I think I literally cannot dance DDR like that anymore.

743
00:41:03,553 --> 00:41:07,113
Speaker 1: It's a sad day to be this old at 32.

744
00:41:07,113 --> 00:41:07,627
Speaker 0: Don't get old.

745
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:08,750
Speaker 1: Don't get old.

746
00:41:08,872 --> 00:41:09,306
Speaker 0: Too old.

747
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:18,790
Speaker 1: So, I needed a new computer for work, and the CTO was like, "You can't waste the time building a computer.

748
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:20,123
Speaker 1: Just buy a Dell or

749
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:20,527
Speaker 1: something.".

750
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:30,150
Speaker 0: Right, so what I did for work usually when I needed a new computer is I either got a Lenovo ThinkPad, which now is no longer the greatest option, or I got the Dell Optiplex.

751
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:53,769
Speaker 0: The Dell Optiplex, which I had in my previous job, is just a normal old desktop-y, tower-ish computer that comes in four different sizes, but the one thing about it is that when you open up the side, which is actually surprisingly easy to open for a Dell computer, the things arranged inside are very, very nicely arranged, and it was actually quite easy to put in a video card and other modifications I needed to make when I had one.

752
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:58,264
Speaker 0: So, that was six, seven years ago.

753
00:41:58,304 --> 00:41:59,810
Speaker 0: I don't know what's changed since then.

754
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:09,450
Speaker 1: Plus, also, as we talked about on a previous Monday episode of Geek Nights, none of those pre-built computers give you the kinds of options that you actually need, like multiple hard drives.

755
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:21,670
Speaker 0: Well, sure, but because it was so easy to open, I just bought the stock one that had the right CPU and the right amount of RAM, and then the video card I just bought on Newegg, that kind of stuff.

756
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:26,049
Speaker 1: So, I bought the Newegg iBuyPower desktop Intel configurator PC.

757
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,450
Speaker 0: Oh, so one of those configurators, but what the hell is iBuyPower?

758
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,928
Speaker 1: So, I actually tried to figure that out, and I can't.

759
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:37,418
Speaker 1: So, I think it's a separate company.

760
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:40,790
Speaker 1: Maybe it's the company that bought Newegg or bought part of Newegg.

761
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:41,530
Speaker 0: No one bought Newegg.

762
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:44,370
Speaker 1: You don't know a lot about Newegg's internal stuff, do you?

763
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,791
Speaker 1: I know,

764
00:42:44,811 --> 00:43:06,230
Speaker 0: but I went to the iBuyPower website, and that seems to be a website where you configure a computer, and it's actually a really powerful configurator that lets you configure a lot of details of the computer, except they put it together for you instead of you having to build it, and they give you a lot of good options that Dell and other people don't give you for desktop computers, even laptops also.

765
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:16,490
Speaker 0: But then if you go to Newegg, there's an item that you can buy on Newegg, which is the iBuyPower configurator built into Newegg, and you order through Newegg, and it's very strange.

766
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:28,910
Speaker 1: So, there's a lot of weird relationships between Newegg and a lot of other companies, and I really can't figure out what Newegg's full deal is.

767
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:30,850
Speaker 0: iBuyPower is definitely smaller than Newegg.

768
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,379
Speaker 1: Quote, "On September 28, 2009, Newegg filed for an

769
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:32,540
Speaker 1: IPO.".

770
00:43:34,816 --> 00:43:35,029
Speaker 0: Yep.

771
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,647
Speaker 1: "The filing stated Newegg had been profitable, blah, blah, blah, blah,

772
00:43:37,687 --> 00:43:38,030
Speaker 1: blah.".

773
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,741
Speaker 0: Where's the IPO?

774
00:43:38,762 --> 00:43:39,169
Speaker 0: I want in.

775
00:43:39,571 --> 00:43:42,607
Speaker 1: "In 2011, the company withdrew its registration for filing an

776
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:43,009
Speaker 1: IPO.".

777
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:44,164
Speaker 0: No, bring it back.

778
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:44,529
Speaker 0: I want it.

779
00:43:44,952 --> 00:43:46,049
Speaker 1: I don't know if I would invest in them.

780
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:46,790
Speaker 0: I would buy Newegg.

781
00:43:47,451 --> 00:43:56,080
Speaker 1: So, anyway, Newegg is the place that, you know, we always talk about, like, any show like this, Geek Nights, anything, will always say, "Oh, gonna get a computer?

782
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,344
Speaker 1: Go to Newegg, buy all the

783
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:57,525
Speaker 1: parts.".

784
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:12,210
Speaker 1: However, a lot of times, a friend of ours, a listener, a mother, a grandmother, a coworker who is not in your inner circle of friends will say, "Hey, Rem, you know a lot about computers.

785
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,501
Speaker 1: What computers should I

786
00:44:13,541 --> 00:44:13,804
Speaker 1: buy?".

787
00:44:14,492 --> 00:44:15,989
Speaker 1: That's the voice of someone who isn't me.

788
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:24,450
Speaker 0: Well, nowadays, my advice is, if you are not doing media production, gaming, or coding, why do you need a computer?

789
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:42,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, philosophically, you should still get a real computer such that you will have the ability to do those three things if you so desire, or, you know, your horizons will not be limited by having, you know, a less powerful device, you know, and maybe having that more powerful device will open new worlds to you.

790
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:49,990
Speaker 0: Like, when I bought a fancier camera, I thought I might have been throwing my money away, but actually, because I got the fancy one, I started caring about cameras more.

791
00:44:50,372 --> 00:44:57,982
Speaker 0: Maybe if I make this person get a fancy desktop, they will care about computers more, and it'll be good for them, but honestly, just get a fucking iPad.

792
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,568
Speaker 0: You don't need a real computer anymore.

793
00:44:59,648 --> 00:44:59,950
Speaker 0: The end.

794
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:07,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the main reason for me is that if someone asks you, "What computer should I

795
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:07,850
Speaker 1: get?"

796
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:16,330
Speaker 1: and they follow your advice, they're going to call you when anything goes wrong with that computer for the rest of your collective lives.

797
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:29,670
Speaker 1: So, as a result, I'm very hesitant to recommend basically any technology to anyone that I know who isn't, like, a listener of Geek Nights and I'm just talking at you and you can't respond to me and don't know my phone number.

798
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:38,769
Speaker 0: These days, I tell people to get an iPad, and if they need a real computer for some reason, but they don't need, like, a real, real computer, get the Surface Pro.

799
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:47,670
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a real-for-reals laptop that's totally modern and supported, and it's actually probably one of the best Windows laptops you can get.

800
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,588
Speaker 1: Though, depending on the person, I might suggest that they get an old ThinkPad Lenovo X230.

801
00:45:53,810 --> 00:46:02,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't need, like, the newest CPU and, like, it's not going to matter, why not get an older but still brand new ThinkPad?

802
00:46:03,352 --> 00:46:06,890
Speaker 0: You know, I have a 220 for myself and a 230 at work, and they're both just fine.

803
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,410
Speaker 1: Yep, I got a 230 for myself and a coworker has a 240, and I looked at it, and it's not better.

804
00:46:11,775 --> 00:46:11,950
Speaker 0: Nope.

805
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:14,710
Speaker 1: And, in fact, it's worse in a few material ways.

806
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,230
Speaker 1: So, I think the first thing you got to do is, like, you know, you said just tell them about an iPad.

807
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,830
Speaker 1: You have to get them to answer a simple question.

808
00:46:22,331 --> 00:46:24,289
Speaker 1: What are you going to use this computer for?

809
00:46:25,893 --> 00:46:28,110
Speaker 1: And, like, you know, your parents want to ask for a new computer.

810
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:29,796
Speaker 0: I'm like, what do you do with it?

811
00:46:29,816 --> 00:46:31,405
Speaker 0: You just, you know, visit websites.

812
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:32,390
Speaker 0: The iPad does that.

813
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:32,710
Speaker 0: Yep.

814
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:39,809
Speaker 1: And then, depending on their answers, unless they trigger a thing that requires a computer, just tell them to buy the iPad.

815
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:45,070
Speaker 0: All right, so the one thing they said that was valid somewhat is there's some websites they go to.

816
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:50,210
Speaker 0: You might need to fill out a form or do something on some website, and the iPad browser doesn't cut it.

817
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,770
Speaker 0: You're going to need a desktop browser just to do a thing that requires a desktop browser.

818
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:55,629
Speaker 1: Yep, that is true.

819
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,179
Speaker 0: So, you know what you can get for that?

820
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:58,370
Speaker 0: A Chromebook.

821
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:58,977
Speaker 1: Nah.

822
00:46:59,710 --> 00:46:59,871
Speaker 0: Right?

823
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:03,670
Speaker 0: It runs real Chrome, and it can do things on real, legit websites you need to do.

824
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:04,010
Speaker 0: Yep.

825
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:04,350
Speaker 0: Like that.

826
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,530
Speaker 1: But, like, if someone says, oh, I type a lot of stuff, like, I type a lot of emails.

827
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,390
Speaker 0: You can get a keyboard and connect it to your iPad.

828
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:15,530
Speaker 1: In fact, when we were at the beach, Emily was typing a big chunk of her novel on a Bluetooth keyboard synced to her iPhone.

829
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:16,289
Speaker 0: There you go.

830
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,646
Speaker 1: That totally worked in Google Docs.

831
00:47:17,707 --> 00:47:17,909
Speaker 1: Just go.

832
00:47:18,791 --> 00:47:19,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

833
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:32,750
Speaker 1: I think part of the problem is that a lot of these people, meaning most people, they don't really understand the idea of modular interchangeable, like, if they hear Bluetooth, everything that supports Bluetooth supports Bluetooth.

834
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:35,429
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I told my parents, like, a whole bunch of times.

835
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:37,820
Speaker 0: My mom was like, I want a bigger screen.

836
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,549
Speaker 0: I'm like, just connect your iPad to the TV.

837
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,386
Speaker 0: How can I do that with an Apple TV or this $50 cable?

838
00:47:42,386 --> 00:47:46,230
Speaker 0: $50 is a lot less money than an entire computer.

839
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:53,530
Speaker 0: And she didn't really understand what I was talking about until I connected my iPad to the TV and she saw it, and she was like, oh.

840
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:56,570
Speaker 0: It's like they don't understand the words that are coming out of your mouth.

841
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,308
Speaker 0: They have to see it to understand it.

842
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,750
Speaker 1: So the questions are, do you need it to be portable?

843
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,749
Speaker 1: Do you want to play games?

844
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,009
Speaker 0: Modern games.

845
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,510
Speaker 0: The newest, newest games.

846
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,890
Speaker 1: Do you create anything?

847
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:12,550
Speaker 0: Video, audio, code.

848
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,148
Speaker 1: Significant amounts of text.

849
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,650
Speaker 0: Photos, editing, as opposed to just immediately uploading direct from your phone to Facebook.

850
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:19,038
Speaker 1: Yep.

851
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:33,809
Speaker 1: So if I decide that someone needs an actual desktop computer, for whatever arbitrary criteria, I'm pretty much just going to point them at this iBuyPower desktop configurator, because the thing I got in my office is fine for what it is.

852
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,025
Speaker 1: It was put together inside.

853
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,410
Speaker 1: It was really sparse, because it's a big case, mid-tower.

854
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,869
Speaker 1: Tiny little ITX motherboard in there.

855
00:48:43,174 --> 00:48:44,670
Speaker 1: And everything was wired correctly.

856
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:48,270
Speaker 1: And it was wired reasonably well, because actually today I was typing.

857
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:51,450
Speaker 0: Some guy who does nothing but wire computers all day was doing that.

858
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:51,900
Speaker 0: Yeah.

859
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,865
Speaker 0: It's like when I wire a computer, I've been doing it for years, but I've only done it 10, 20 times total.

860
00:48:57,091 --> 00:48:58,609
Speaker 0: I do a pretty good job.

861
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:04,250
Speaker 0: But if I had to do that and nothing but that all day, my wiring would be a work of fucking art.

862
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,266
Speaker 0: You'd be like, "Where are the

863
00:49:06,286 --> 00:49:06,650
Speaker 0: wires?".

864
00:49:06,771 --> 00:49:07,780
Speaker 0: I'd be like, "Where are they

865
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:08,305
Speaker 0: indeed?".

866
00:49:09,453 --> 00:49:13,048
Speaker 1: My one job I had back when I was the guy... You had one job.

867
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:21,907
Speaker 1: When I went and fixed fucked up situations back when I worked at the hospital, one time they sent me to a data center, and they're like, "There's a rack, and we don't know what the deal with it

868
00:49:22,028 --> 00:49:22,108
Speaker 1: is.".

869
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,465
Speaker 1: And I was like, "That's really

870
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:23,830
Speaker 1: vague.".

871
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,025
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Just go deal with

872
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:25,126
Speaker 1: it.".

873
00:49:25,771 --> 00:49:31,350
Speaker 1: So I go, and I was surprised I didn't find a dead body inside of that rat's nest of cables.

874
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,118
Speaker 0: Why is it always a rat's nest?

875
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:34,589
Speaker 0: Why can't it be something else's nest?

876
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:37,849
Speaker 0: There's got to be something worse than rat's nest.

877
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,597
Speaker 1: Hobo nest.

878
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:40,710
Speaker 1: New York City hobo nest.

879
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,310
Speaker 0: Why can't it be like jellyfish legs?

880
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:47,350
Speaker 1: I thought you were going to say jellyfish nest.

881
00:49:48,331 --> 00:49:49,530
Speaker 0: Oh, a whole bunch of jellyfishes?

882
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:50,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might be worse.

883
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:51,314
Speaker 1: Snakes.

884
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,310
Speaker 1: It was just a sea of snakes.

885
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:53,509
Speaker 1: It was a mating ball.

886
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,529
Speaker 0: Why did it have to be snakes?

887
00:49:54,732 --> 00:49:55,849
Speaker 1: It was a snake mating ball.

888
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:56,502
Speaker 0: There you go.

889
00:49:57,330 --> 00:50:11,590
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it was 18 1U servers in the same rack with some network equipment and everything, and let me tell you, I spent an entire work day rewiring that thing.

890
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:12,550
Speaker 0: Were the lights blinking?

891
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,209
Speaker 1: I just turned everything off, because fuck 'em.

892
00:50:16,317 --> 00:50:17,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

893
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:23,319
Speaker 1: I remember, that job, it wasn't like, "Go figure this out and deal with it, and you got to be

894
00:50:23,339 --> 00:50:23,605
Speaker 1: careful.".

895
00:50:24,152 --> 00:50:26,025
Speaker 1: The job was, "Fix it, we don't care

896
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:26,328
Speaker 1: how.".

897
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:28,250
Speaker 1: I was like the bad cop.

898
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:30,007
Speaker 1: They'd send me in to take care of business.

899
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:30,949
Speaker 1: It was a hospital.

900
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,170
Speaker 0: You might have killed somebody.

901
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure those servers were being used by nobody for nothing.

902
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:39,789
Speaker 0: Why just turn them off and rip all the wires out?

903
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:41,550
Speaker 0: Well, throw the wires in the trash and leave.

904
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:48,149
Speaker 1: So I actually didn't turn them back on, because I was waiting to see if a ticket arose anywhere in the hospital asking about them.

905
00:50:49,233 --> 00:50:50,809
Speaker 1: But then I quit, so I never found out.

906
00:50:52,673 --> 00:51:06,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, for anyone who needs to know, the way to rewire a big mess like that, when you have things that are just connected to each other, and not to other random places, is you basically find one port on one machine, right next to it with a Sharpie, like one.

907
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:12,708
Speaker 0: Find the other end of that wire on the other port, right next to that one, one, and then take the wire out.

908
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:22,750
Speaker 0: And then do that until you've written numbers next to every single port, and then get all new cables and make them nice, going from one to one, two to two, three to three, et cetera.

909
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:29,868
Speaker 1: I actually preferred the functional result, where instead I would simply look at each port and figure out, what does this port need to do?

910
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:32,410
Speaker 1: And I wouldn't redo it on a one-to-one basis.

911
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:34,610
Speaker 1: I'd redo it on a logically equivalent basis.

912
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,509
Speaker 0: How do you know what the port needs to do?

913
00:51:37,372 --> 00:51:40,523
Speaker 0: I mean, if it's just like a switch and it doesn't matter, you know any of these can go to any of those.

914
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:41,849
Speaker 0: Most of them are Ethernet.

915
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,710
Speaker 1: All I do is just figure out if they had to be on special VLANs or anything stupid like that.

916
00:51:45,931 --> 00:51:49,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, but sometimes it's like, oh, you know, this one has to go there.

917
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:59,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, one of them were these like 40-foot null-modem cables plugged into these like jank-ass serial ports, and they went under into the raised floor and disappeared.

918
00:51:59,713 --> 00:52:02,010
Speaker 1: And if I tugged on them, they were completely taut.

919
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:04,309
Speaker 1: And I couldn't unplug that.

920
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,530
Speaker 0: Someone at some point in time set that up.

921
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:09,030
Speaker 1: I suspect the rat got moved.

922
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:13,369
Speaker 0: Well, I wish I was there on that day to see what was going on.

923
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:20,090
Speaker 1: The best part is that project, the one with the serial cables, failed, and like that whole project was a disaster and collapsed.

924
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,470
Speaker 1: So I never figured out where the other end of that serial cable went.

925
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:25,426
Speaker 1: Just cut it.

926
00:52:26,418 --> 00:52:26,789
Speaker 1: We did.

927
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:31,621
Speaker 1: We cut the heads off as deep as we could get to them and left it with a little flag on the end.

928
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:36,890
Speaker 1: that said, basically, it was a code that meant this cable is not used for anything.

929
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,030
Speaker 1: If you ever find the other end of it, you can throw the whole thing away.

930
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:46,490
Speaker 0: No, you can just go to every machine in the whole data center, cut all of them, and then when you pull all the ends, none of them should be taut.

931
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:52,049
Speaker 0: You should all come out with half cables on every end, and then you can put them all in one bin.

932
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:56,590
Speaker 1: So anyway, seriously, I knocked this thing over today at work.

933
00:52:57,010 --> 00:53:00,710
Speaker 1: The whole computer, facing forward, so the motherboard was on the top.

934
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,569
Speaker 1: So it just fell.

935
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:02,358
Speaker 0: You kicked it?

936
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,090
Speaker 0: It was on the floor?

937
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:06,390
Speaker 1: I just leaned back and kicked it the wrong way, and it just fell over.

938
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,363
Speaker 1: And it was totally fine.

939
00:53:09,424 --> 00:53:10,209
Speaker 1: Nothing came loose.

940
00:53:10,997 --> 00:53:12,250
Speaker 1: So it was correctly put together.

941
00:53:12,871 --> 00:53:21,310
Speaker 1: And my advice to anyone who needs to buy a computer is just go here, choose options that match your maximum budget, and click add to cart.

942
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,216
Speaker 1: It'll be fine.

943
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,989
Speaker 1: There's not that many options.

944
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:31,490
Speaker 0: And the thing is, there's a lot of people who are still into the nerdery of overclocking.

945
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,550
Speaker 1: If you're into that nerdery, build a computer from scratch.

946
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:41,169
Speaker 0: Obviously, but there are some nerderies that I think just need to die, and that is one of them.

947
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,590
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about overclocking my laptop.

948
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:43,086
Speaker 1: Why?

949
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:54,930
Speaker 1: Because the Elgato encoding, if the CPU is less than 3.02 gigahertz, it cannot encode in real time 1080p 30.

950
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:59,461
Speaker 0: You have the extremely rare, somewhat legit use case, but your laptop might explode.

951
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,690
Speaker 0: Why not just buy another laptop?

952
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,208
Speaker 0: You have money.

953
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,990
Speaker 1: Because at this point it's cheaper.

954
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,369
Speaker 1: I could just buy another computer and make that the streaming box.

955
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,350
Speaker 0: Because you can afford to just buy another computer, why not overclock this one?

956
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,168
Speaker 0: If it explodes, you'll just buy a new one.

957
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:15,230
Speaker 1: The thing is, I need to overclock it.

958
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:17,190
Speaker 0: And if it doesn't, you just saved yourself a bunch of money.

959
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,150
Speaker 1: I need to overclock it so little.

960
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,020
Speaker 1: Because it runs at 2.96 gigahertz.

961
00:54:22,312 --> 00:54:22,396
Speaker 1: Wow.

962
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:25,289
Speaker 1: And the thing is, I tested.

963
00:54:25,771 --> 00:54:29,350
Speaker 1: I ran profilers, and I watched, and I'd encode different video.

964
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:34,470
Speaker 1: It was amazing, because 1080p 30 was going fine on a static, simple to encode image.

965
00:54:34,812 --> 00:54:37,167
Speaker 1: But then I took the camera and went, "Woo, woo,

966
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:37,449
Speaker 1: woo!".

967
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:38,702
Speaker 1: And the CPU went,

968
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:39,106
Speaker 1: "Max!".

969
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:41,610
Speaker 1: It was amazing.

970
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:58,510
Speaker 0: But yeah, most people who aren't encoding live streaming video with a laptop, even if you're playing games, the newest, newest possible games, the most ridiculous hardware they sell doesn't do anything.

971
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,011
Speaker 0: I have a 680.

972
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:04,010
Speaker 0: I'm still maxing out literally every game that Steam has to offer.

973
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:12,930
Speaker 1: Well, no, it goes to show that the fact that it's almost 2015 proves something that we said back in 2005.

974
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:18,530
Speaker 1: That if you're a nerd about computers, you can overclock to extend this further.

975
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:30,842
Speaker 1: But if you invest in a high-quality, well-researched computer, and you buy top-of-the-line or second top-of-the-line, plateau-line components, and you overspend, I spent like

976
00:55:30,842 --> 00:55:32,230
Speaker 1: $3,400. 680

977
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,390
Speaker 1: was $500.

978
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:36,143
Speaker 1: I spent well over $3,000 on the computer.

979
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,549
Speaker 0: I do have 32 gigs of RAM.

980
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:45,551
Speaker 1: But seriously, in 2009, the computer I'm using now, I bought for a bit over $3,000.

981
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:55,870
Speaker 1: It is 100% sufficient to do Geek Guides, edit HD video and 4K video live, and do everything that I do with a computer, including playing super-modern games today.

982
00:55:56,291 --> 00:56:02,169
Speaker 1: And I've spent a total of $500 upgrading it in the entire life of it so far.

983
00:56:02,169 --> 00:56:06,004
Speaker 1: $600, I bought a new SSD yesterday.

984
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:22,109
Speaker 0: Since I made this computer, which is pretty much around the time the 680 came out, so years ago, it has not needed any modification or upgrading whatsoever, and it is still effectively perfect as fast as any computer anyone could possibly need.

985
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:23,337
Speaker 1: I found a use case.

986
00:56:23,539 --> 00:56:24,790
Speaker 1: I kind of need more RAM.

987
00:56:25,435 --> 00:56:27,210
Speaker 0: I have 32 gigs, so how many do you have?

988
00:56:27,392 --> 00:56:28,392
Speaker 1: So I have 12.

989
00:56:28,392 --> 00:56:28,989
Speaker 0: Now you need more.

990
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:36,890
Speaker 0: At work, I had four, and basically, I needed more, so I went up to eight, and now I'm only using like five at a time.

991
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,390
Speaker 1: This computer has six DIMM slots.

992
00:56:41,217 --> 00:56:41,708
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

993
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,150
Speaker 1: That's because I bought an awesome motherboard.

994
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:43,810
Speaker 0: Do you have six times two?

995
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:45,660
Speaker 1: No, I don't, actually.

996
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,629
Speaker 1: I do have room to put more in.

997
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:55,870
Speaker 1: But the use case I ran into where I needed more than 12 was I was using an effect in Premiere, and I couldn't play it back live.

998
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:59,129
Speaker 1: It was one of those effects that even with the CUDA rendering, you just can't.

999
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,190
Speaker 1: Because it was an effect that basically, I figured out what it was doing.

1000
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:15,070
Speaker 1: It analyzes all the frames, so it takes every frame into memory to do a calculation on the full set of the frames, and that's how it figures out what to do to all the frames.

1001
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:22,290
Speaker 1: So you need enough RAM to hold the entire set of frames that you've selected for the effect in memory.

1002
00:57:23,074 --> 00:57:24,229
Speaker 1: To render it at all.

1003
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:36,329
Speaker 1: Now, with Adobe Media Encoder, you can render it, and it'll deal with it, but if you want to do a preview render, or you want Premiere to render it itself, my RAM just went up and up and up and up and up and up and up and up.

1004
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:41,224
Speaker 0: Well, for the preview, you can tell it, "Well, when I preview, only preview every other frame.

1005
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:42,249
Speaker 0: Don't preview all the

1006
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:42,470
Speaker 0: frames.".

1007
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:43,276
Speaker 1: Not with this effect.

1008
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:44,950
Speaker 1: This effect, you didn't have that option.

1009
00:57:45,635 --> 00:57:46,590
Speaker 1: It wasn't the display.

1010
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,330
Speaker 0: You can also preview at half size.

1011
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:49,209
Speaker 1: That wouldn't have helped.

1012
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,290
Speaker 0: So that each frame takes up half as much space.

1013
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:54,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't affect the rendering of a preview.

1014
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:58,010
Speaker 1: As opposed to the live playback preview.

1015
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:02,390
Speaker 1: Anyway, I ran into a case where maybe 24 gigs of RAM would be useful.

1016
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:07,027
Speaker 0: Yeah, for anything for a normal person, even today, where RAM is so cheap, you think, "Why

1017
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:07,110
Speaker 0: not?".

1018
00:58:07,191 --> 00:58:08,866
Speaker 0: The reason I have 32, it was so cheap.

1019
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:09,290
Speaker 0: Why not?

1020
00:58:10,011 --> 00:58:11,330
Speaker 1: I feel like 8 is a good default.

1021
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have 8, you're not going to run into any problems whatsoever with any normal thing.

1022
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,790
Speaker 0: At work, I have a virtual machine always open.

1023
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:28,370
Speaker 0: I got two browsers, which use the most memory of anything, always open, and a whole bunch of other shit, like Outlook and stuff, and I'm using 5, at most, when I've got everything open.

1024
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:30,810
Speaker 1: So here, this iBuyPower thing, here are your options for RAM.

1025
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:31,657
Speaker 1: Every option.

1026
00:58:31,657 --> 00:58:33,070
Speaker 1: 4 gigs of RAM.

1027
00:58:33,373 --> 00:58:33,748
Speaker 0: Not enough.

1028
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,330
Speaker 1: That's just included by default.

1029
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:36,961
Speaker 1: Add $40 to get 8 gigs of RAM.

1030
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:38,309
Speaker 0: Done.

1031
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,050
Speaker 0: Add $116 to have- So it's insignificantly more money.

1032
00:58:42,331 --> 00:58:43,399
Speaker 1: Add $116 to have 16 gigabytes of RAM.

1033
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:46,650
Speaker 0: That's more than you're going to need ever.

1034
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:52,290
Speaker 1: Add $136 to have 16 gigabytes of G.Skill Ripjaws X-Series RAM.

1035
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:54,670
Speaker 0: So no difference between the previous one whatsoever.

1036
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:55,756
Speaker 1: Let me look at the details.

1037
00:58:55,938 --> 00:58:57,813
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a slight difference in- There is.

1038
00:58:57,914 --> 00:58:58,801
Speaker 0: RAM is RAM.

1039
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:00,010
Speaker 0: Don't fall for that nonsense.

1040
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:00,415
Speaker 0: Guess what?

1041
00:59:00,435 --> 00:59:02,190
Speaker 1: They're both PC 1280.

1042
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,263
Speaker 0: Yes, do not fall for the fancy RAM.

1043
00:59:04,464 --> 00:59:05,290
Speaker 0: All RAM is RAM.

1044
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:09,992
Speaker 1: You know, I realize for all these years, me and most PC people say PC 1280.

1045
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:14,944
Speaker 1: It's actually 12,800.

1046
00:59:14,944 --> 00:59:15,330
Speaker 0: Uh, whatever.

1047
00:59:15,592 --> 00:59:16,437
Speaker 1: That's the rating.

1048
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,590
Speaker 1: God, remember when CAS latency mattered?

1049
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:19,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

1050
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,509
Speaker 1: Remember knowing what CAS latency was?

1051
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,130
Speaker 1: Going for that CAS 2 RAM?

1052
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:23,850
Speaker 0: No, I forgot what CAS latency was.

1053
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:25,667
Speaker 1: Instead of the CAS 3, it was the refresh ratio.

1054
00:59:26,431 --> 00:59:26,686
Speaker 0: Whatever.

1055
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:27,438
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1056
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:31,110
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I'll recommend this to anyone who wants a computer.

1057
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,790
Speaker 1: Anyone who doesn't need a computer, I'll recommend an iPad.

1058
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:38,469
Speaker 1: And if they want a laptop, either buy the cheapest possible laptop or a Surface Pro.

1059
00:59:39,112 --> 00:59:41,290
Speaker 0: I recommend not buying the cheapest possible, right?

1060
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,390
Speaker 0: The cheapest possible gets the job done.

1061
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:44,477
Speaker 0: It's sort of miraculous.

1062
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:45,664
Speaker 0: Like, whoa, $200.

1063
00:59:45,664 --> 00:59:46,368
Speaker 0: I got this computer.

1064
00:59:46,388 --> 00:59:46,670
Speaker 0: It works.

1065
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,562
Speaker 0: It does all these things.

1066
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:48,030
Speaker 0: Hooray.

1067
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:55,569
Speaker 0: The only problem with those, and I know a lot of people who buy them because they just can't afford to buy the good one, and they need a computer now, is that they break.

1068
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:59,650
Speaker 0: So as soon as you buy -- and it's not like the sunglasses strategy, right?

1069
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:05,330
Speaker 0: I'll buy $20 sunglasses, and if they break, I'll just buy more $20 sunglasses, and it'll be fine.

1070
01:00:05,671 --> 01:00:09,650
Speaker 0: And it'll be the same as if I just bought $200 sunglasses once with less risk.

1071
01:00:10,593 --> 01:00:15,410
Speaker 0: If you lose or break your sunglasses, you can go without sunglasses until buying new ones.

1072
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:16,969
Speaker 0: It's not really a big fucking deal.

1073
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:22,430
Speaker 0: If your computer breaks, you need a fucking new computer immediately, like that moment.

1074
01:00:22,892 --> 01:00:29,147
Speaker 0: So if you buy a $200 computer, okay, that was all you could afford, great, but it's going to break, right?

1075
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:36,050
Speaker 0: You get quality by spending -- not more money won't necessarily get you more quality, but the good stuff is more expensive.

1076
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:43,549
Speaker 1: In my experience, the Asus craptops and the Asus just preconfigured laptops, like desktops and things, they're way better than they used to be.

1077
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,530
Speaker 0: They're better than they used to be, but they're still not good.

1078
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:48,690
Speaker 1: I don't get the impression they break anymore, they're just way underpowered.

1079
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:52,150
Speaker 0: Not just underpowered, but it's like they will not get the job done.

1080
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:56,190
Speaker 0: They will not last you the five plus years that my computers that I own have lasted.

1081
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,510
Speaker 1: Those things don't buy you anything over an iPad.

1082
01:01:00,132 --> 01:01:00,929
Speaker 0: That's also true.

1083
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:02,450
Speaker 1: That's the real answer.

1084
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:05,910
Speaker 0: You're not really saving anything by getting those, right?

1085
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:11,724
Speaker 0: Basically, when those break, you need to go out and buy another thing immediately, and again, you'll only be able to afford another $200 dude.

1086
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:23,766
Speaker 0: You're better off saving the monies, suffering with whatever you happen to have now, whatever it is, just suffer with it until you can afford at least the $500 or $800 dealie.

1087
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:32,710
Speaker 0: And once you get that, you're actually going to save money no matter how poor you are, because that thing will last you a fucking long ass time.

1088
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:37,450
Speaker 0: If a computer doesn't last you five plus years, you did it wrong.

1089
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,010
Speaker 0: I've never had a quality computer last less than five years.

1090
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:42,769
Speaker 0: Usually more than five years they last.

1091
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here's a good example.

1092
01:01:44,430 --> 01:01:49,407
Speaker 1: My computer now, even if I include upgrades, I spent a little over

1093
01:01:49,407 --> 01:01:52,558
Speaker 1: $4,000. $4,000,

1094
01:01:52,558 --> 01:01:52,679
Speaker 1: right?

1095
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:54,170
Speaker 1: That seems like a lot of money for a computer.

1096
01:01:55,413 --> 01:02:13,410
Speaker 1: If I use it for the rest of next year, if I keep using it and it lasts until Christmas next year, Christmas 2015, and then I replace it, I'll have paid under $600 a year to have had a supercomputer for that entire time.

1097
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:17,751
Speaker 0: I mean, my computer was less than $2,000.

1098
01:02:17,751 --> 01:02:21,450
Speaker 0: I expect it to last at least six years, if not eight.

1099
01:02:21,911 --> 01:02:26,263
Speaker 0: If we go with the conservative estimate of six, $2,000 divided by six years, right?

1100
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,529
Speaker 0: That's saving a lot of monies there.

1101
01:02:33,732 --> 01:02:42,844
Speaker 1: In fact, the Windows Experience Index on my computer is still... Oh, my RAM and processor hold it down now.

1102
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:44,593
Speaker 1: 7.3.

1103
01:02:44,593 --> 01:02:45,347
Speaker 0: I don't even know what mine is.

1104
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, 7.3.

1105
01:02:48,152 --> 01:02:56,340
Speaker 1: That's not too bad, actually, for a computer that built in 2009.

1106
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,420
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1107
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:03,540
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
