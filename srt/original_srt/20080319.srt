Speaker 1: no my work has decided that The tech department in the media department Which is pretty much the cool half of the people at work Gonna do some bowling action.

13
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:56,557
Speaker 1: and bowling is not the greatest thing in the world, but you know bowling with work little Co-worker rivalry.

14
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:58,645
Speaker 1: try to support the the tech peeps.

15
00:00:58,967 --> 00:00:59,629
Speaker 1: It'll be pretty cool.

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

17
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:02,643
Speaker 0: I remember the last time when bowling with the front row crew.

18
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,230
Speaker 0: that was a long time ago.

19
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:07,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you know I think if like I joined a bowling league I'd get bored.

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,990
Speaker 1: But you know bowling once in a while sure whatever throw heavy rock at some sticks.

21
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:18,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, honestly the main reason I didn't bowl for a long time was that bowling alleys are by and large Disgusting.

22
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:18,935
Speaker 1: that is that is.

23
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:25,156
Speaker 1: a major problem is if they there are in existence bowling alleys that are not disgusting But they are few and far between.

24
00:01:25,217 --> 00:01:29,855
Speaker 1: most of them are sleazy holes for sort of scary Shlubby unpleasant people.

25
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:35,290
Speaker 0: one thing that really helped at RIT in particular is when New York State finally banned smoking pretty much inside.

26
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:36,988
Speaker 1: That helps so much.

27
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,723
Speaker 1: Before that bowling alleys are like the smokiest of.

28
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:42,510
Speaker 1: you might as well just call the smoking huts.

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,433
Speaker 1: I mean there.

30
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:52,441
Speaker 1: if you go to a bowling alley that isn't super new most likely like you know the machines that you know Take you know make the bowling balls roll.

31
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,748
Speaker 1: You know back come back to you.

32
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:55,733
Speaker 1: and These you know.

33
00:01:55,793 --> 00:02:01,010
Speaker 1: the seats that are sort of built into the bowling alley are just like they have ashtrays all built in all of them.

34
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:10,287
Speaker 0: I just remember that it was always tricky to find good DDR and every now and then like I remember the extreme machine the first one in art at RIT was in a bowling alley.

35
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:14,901
Speaker 0: yes, and We we went there once and the smoke was so bad.

36
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,590
Speaker 0: We I about passed out trying to dance on that stupid thing.

37
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz bowling alleys are one of the few places every bowling alley has like a few arcade machines.

38
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,950
Speaker 1: It's one of the few places still left where you can play some arcade games in the US.

39
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:30,164
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course God that place it had like the worst food ever.

40
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,110
Speaker 1: you don't eat food in the bowling alley you crazy.

41
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:35,896
Speaker 0: No, I never actually ate it, but the fact that it was there Well, I mean I guess you get.

42
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:38,090
Speaker 1: if you really wanted to you can get like a soda or something.

43
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:39,637
Speaker 0: Well, there was a pretty nice bowling alley.

44
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:45,750
Speaker 0: know where I grew up and we whenever there's a half-day of school There were oftentimes we'd all kind of meet at the bowling alley, but we wouldn't actually Bowl.

45
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,310
Speaker 0: We play arcade games like kick us out.

46
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,110
Speaker 1: Remember when I was when I was way little.

47
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:59,570
Speaker 1: There was a period of time where my mom would Bowl and then they had like a daycare at the bowling alley and they had He-man castle and I seemed her this is I was must have been stupidly young like one or two at the time.

48
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,802
Speaker 1: Well must have been at least two because it was in Connecticut.

49
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,353
Speaker 1: So two or three I'm.

50
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:12,205
Speaker 1: I was stupidly young and I don't remember very clearly But I seem to remember that perhaps I was responsible for breaking the he-man castle.

51
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:14,943
Speaker 0: Oh, wow You're that fucker.

52
00:03:15,145 --> 00:03:18,357
Speaker 0: and maybe Actually, I took a bowling class at RIT.

53
00:03:18,518 --> 00:03:19,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

54
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,790
Speaker 1: I take the same class only not with you with random people.

55
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:23,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, those right around the time.

56
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,547
Speaker 0: My car was broken down and then while it was broken down.

57
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:26,330
Speaker 0: We drove to Chicago.

58
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:27,415
Speaker 1: No, this is this.

59
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:28,762
Speaker 1: I took it in like my final year.

60
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:29,526
Speaker 1: I held it out.

61
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,465
Speaker 0: That class actually taught me that I really really really don't like bowling.

62
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,498
Speaker 1: It taught me Throw the ball straight.

63
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll get about a 150 every time.

64
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,609
Speaker 0: What it actually taught me was if you just bowl twice a week You'll you're just gonna constantly get better until you're as good as anyone else out there.

65
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:49,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the pros will be a little bit better.

66
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:57,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the level beyond that is the people who actually can tell how like depending how much oil is on the stupid thing Or correct for the different.

67
00:03:57,443 --> 00:04:01,361
Speaker 1: they got the ball that's the exact right way and they got the gloves and the shoes and the.

68
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:09,652
Speaker 0: but my average went from 70 up to about 160 and then after I stopped going to that class it went right back down to 70.

69
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,950
Speaker 1: I think mine is pretty much right where it is.

70
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:22,750
Speaker 1: I don't think it's gonna move a whole lot in my life because I never get a bowl enough to get it up and I'm Gonna you know lose this or it would take a long time of not playing for me to lose the throw the ball straight.

71
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,650
Speaker 0: Well, you know you seem to have a lot more innate bowling talent than I ever do.

72
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:34,537
Speaker 1: perhaps I do but maybe that's from how many times and I was a kid and whatever that like how many I I'm guessing about half the birthday parties.

73
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:35,942
Speaker 1: I went to as a kid were bowling out.

74
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:36,243
Speaker 1: Wow.

75
00:04:36,564 --> 00:04:38,370
Speaker 0: I went to major magics almost every time.

76
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:51,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to bowling alleys about half the time and it was usually duck pin bowling But whatever, of course I have recently discovered through friends who live northern of us about the candlestick bowling that I thought was you know No longer so existent.

77
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:58,990
Speaker 1: but the candlestick bowling still exists in the Massachusetts and other places and I want to do it real bad next time we head up that way.

78
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:09,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, man candlestick bowling is the hot but in the news this was mentioned briefly But now it's getting closer and closer to actually happening and I kind of want to talk about this a little bit.

79
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,259
Speaker 0: Slayers as you know is one of the like Classic classic anime.

80
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,827
Speaker 0: it's like hilarious comedy.

81
00:05:15,847 --> 00:05:16,651
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen it You should.

82
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:20,424
Speaker 1: it is pretty much the fantasy comedy anime plus.

83
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,190
Speaker 1: Can you think of another fantasy comedy anime?

84
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,162
Speaker 0: I mean you might watch it nowadays and go.

85
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,130
Speaker 0: that's kind of cliched.

86
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:28,065
Speaker 0: But this is one of those shows that started a lot of those cliches.

87
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:28,990
Speaker 1: is the cliche?

88
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:30,970
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have been cliche if slayers didn't exist.

89
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,308
Speaker 1: I mean if I made if slayers didn't exist and I made a comedy fantasy.

90
00:05:34,328 --> 00:05:41,210
Speaker 0: now The Gallery that one of the has a sweat bubble, you know, the like the sweat bubble like oh, I'm nervous.

91
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,221
Speaker 1: This is Emma's have been your favorite joke in the whole show.

92
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,690
Speaker 1: It was well that in koala My favorite joke in the whole show was go get through real quick.

93
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,259
Speaker 0: She grabs a sweat beat and beats him with it.

94
00:05:53,299 --> 00:05:56,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, and also the fish man, you know, the fish man keep coming back.

95
00:05:56,571 --> 00:06:06,445
Speaker 0: I know the fish man is the best But slayers is most excellent as in slightly I don't like the OEVs as much but slayers slayers next slayers.

96
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:07,810
Speaker 0: Try one after the other.

97
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,270
Speaker 1: We've done shows on slayers before at least once or twice.

98
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:16,846
Speaker 0: However, there was big news that try gun was getting a movie and also slayers was getting another season.

99
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:23,767
Speaker 0: and unlike most times When a show that was good suddenly they say hey, there's another one like hey, we're making another tenchi.

100
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:24,188
Speaker 0: Moo.

101
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:26,916
Speaker 0: Yo You're all want to see another tenchi.

102
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:27,117
Speaker 0: Moo.

103
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:31,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't you never mind the fact that we got a different director who actually sucks?

104
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,898
Speaker 1: Well, who's the director of the slayers anime?

105
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,630
Speaker 0: the slayers anime is being done right on every account.

106
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:40,410
Speaker 0: They've got apparently most of the original cast.

107
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:47,150
Speaker 0: They've got the original like everything is set for this to be perfect and they have now announced the title of this new slayers.

108
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:49,096
Speaker 0: It was slayers slayers.

109
00:06:49,156 --> 00:06:55,333
Speaker 0: next slayers try and I'm sure it's gonna be renamed because it's currently slayers Revolution.

110
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:59,310
Speaker 0: All right, so I think we can look forward to seeing slayers we in a couple of years.

111
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,656
Speaker 1: Why I just let it go.

112
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:04,719
Speaker 0: I couldn't let it go.

113
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,210
Speaker 1: Hey, so slayers next try revolution.

114
00:07:09,133 --> 00:07:12,000
Speaker 1: I guess sort of almost goes together to mean something.

115
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:13,585
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can.

116
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,757
Speaker 1: you can if you try real hard Of course.

117
00:07:16,777 --> 00:07:21,337
Speaker 0: then there's all the OAV titles like gorgeous Excellence and then there's the movie which is just layer.

118
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:22,400

Speaker 1: the movie the motion picture motion picture.

121
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,029
Speaker 0: Sorry me pros Island, right?

122
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:40,658
Speaker 0: Ah but this is probably not true, but according to the anime news network a statement was made tonic tongue-in-cheek that Zellows is actually the main character and not Lena.

123
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,865
Speaker 0: and while that is probably not true.

124
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:50,630
Speaker 0: That would be so awesome Zellows is the best character ever in anything except I don't think ever actually saw him that much.

125
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:53,179
Speaker 0: Zellows doesn't in what you saw.

126
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,748
Speaker 1: He's not in the first season at all.

149
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:00,850
Speaker 0: I'm sure some of you were going.

150
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:08,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if I see if I could recognize crayon Shinshan, I could pick him out of a lineup at the police station.

151
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:15,619
Speaker 1: But and I knew that it was infamous for being dirty and I knew it was a comedy But I'd never read it and I'd never watched the anime.

152
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,706
Speaker 1: So I said, you know what?

153
00:09:17,786 --> 00:09:21,747
Speaker 1: I owe it as an anime fan I owe it to myself to at least get volume 1 of the manga.

154
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:23,576
Speaker 1: now Now see what the deal is.

155
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:26,510
Speaker 1: just to know even if it's not good, even if I don't like it.

156
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,870
Speaker 1: It's such a big sort of famous kind of anime.

157
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:33,281
Speaker 1: You gotta why I gotta watch or read or something to know.

158
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:37,470
Speaker 0: a lot of people because this happens a lot in anime Especially just because there's so much out there now.

159
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,413
Speaker 0: But you see a lot of people.

160
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:43,630
Speaker 0: people see Harlock and Mital and Totoro all over the place.

161
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:46,661
Speaker 1: People even cut as much anymore, but but you see him like.

162
00:09:46,682 --> 00:09:47,806
Speaker 0: you see it and you go.

163
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:48,850
Speaker 0: Oh, it's that character.

164
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,178
Speaker 0: How many people have seen any of that?

165
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,385
Speaker 1: not enough now at least not in this country?

166
00:09:53,566 --> 00:10:05,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, not nearly enough Of course, I do point out again I found it funny that when Emily's friend from Japan was visiting he Noted that our anime collection is the collection of old fogies and we watch old weird stuff.

167
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:08,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, he should have gone to go see what Gerald is watching.

168
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,789
Speaker 0: well You should show me thing of the day, but we'll get to that.

169
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:13,894
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, okay.

170
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:18,109
Speaker 1: So crayon Shinshan for people who don't know this is basically what the deal is.

171
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:28,058
Speaker 1: There's this mom and she's sort of like a really normal kind of person like she acts the way Moms with kids do you know?

172
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:31,830
Speaker 1: and and it's it's pretty realistic like even for being Jap.

173
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,576
Speaker 1: Maybe it's the translation cuz.

174
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:37,930
Speaker 1: I definitely can tell that the people who translated this did a great deal of adaptation.

175
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:46,861
Speaker 1: But you know, even though it's Japanese it really feels like she's you know US mom with an annoying kid.

176
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:53,985
Speaker 1: and the thing is this kid Crayon Shinshan, I guess Shinshan crayon, I guess is just sort of like, you know the name of the manga.

177
00:10:54,005 --> 00:11:01,929
Speaker 1: the kids name is Shinshan is Like the worst behaved kid in the entire universe.

178
00:11:03,432 --> 00:11:04,923
Speaker 0: Welcome to that show.

179
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:13,973
Speaker 1: slash manga Like you imagine like try to imagine how bad a kid could be right like stealing killing Right.

180
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:14,575
Speaker 1: Okay.

181
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:16,421
Speaker 1: He's not doing stuff on that level.

182
00:11:16,562 --> 00:11:25,510
Speaker 1: It's not bad in the like baby Hitler It's bad in the bad in the problem John and he makes mom's life as miserable as possible.

183
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,685
Speaker 0: I think I can sum up what it's like to be around someone like that.

184
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:30,395
Speaker 0: cuz people like that exist You know, they do.

185
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:37,158
Speaker 0: I can sum it up in one sound Right and it's like.

186
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,466
Speaker 1: so let me give you an example.

187
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,516
Speaker 1: all this book is is a bunch of little short stories like.

188
00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:49,197
Speaker 1: they're like each one is like two or three pages of manga that tell a short little vignette of.

189
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:56,540
Speaker 1: you know Shinshan and his mom sometimes his dad and sometimes it's really cute dog that sort of gets in on at the action.

190
00:11:57,861 --> 00:11:58,324
Speaker 1: Here's the one.

191
00:11:58,706 --> 00:12:00,960
Speaker 1: he goes to the store as a tricycle, right?

192
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,369
Speaker 1: so he's like buy me buy me buy me buy me buy me buy me right.

193
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,174
Speaker 1: and Well, and the mom's like hell.

194
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,019
Speaker 1: no, right?

195
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:14,499
Speaker 1: Like you do so Shinshan picks up his mom's skirt looks under it and it's like polka dots.

196
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:22,391
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad right there Alright, so the mom is just like embarrassed in the store, right?

197
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,880
Speaker 1: So inch, but she's still not buying the tricycle.

198
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:37,120
Speaker 1: So Shinshan goes starts walking towards this other Complete stranger hot lady in the store and it says I wonder what color her panties are Mom's like, is that a threat?

199
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:41,369
Speaker 0: That those are the kind of scenes.

200
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,580
Speaker 0: I'll admit I love that kind of humor.

201
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the bluff calling mom that sort of thing on

202
00:12:47,410 --> 00:13:01,739
Speaker 1: the next panel says the tricycle was delivered the next day And he goes on from there and there's a couple pages of him you know making trouble with the tricycle like crashing it into things and being stupid and really pissing mom off.

203
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:15,680
Speaker 1: and Yeah, um, you know it some of it was funny Some of it was just sort of blatantly dirty Some of it wasn't just sort of frustrating, you know, it was sort of it made you feel good.

204
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:23,520
Speaker 0: Well, I know you seem to have a problem where whenever you're watching a movie any movie any reading a comic anything and a character Does something you think is stupid you just go?

205
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,746
Speaker 0: And it bothers you.

206
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:31,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not so much stupid going on here It's mostly just Shinshan makes life frustrating.

207
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:38,040
Speaker 1: you laugh, but you feel frustrated with the mom, but then the mom Overreacts and she's kind of crazy.

208
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,670
Speaker 0: Frustrated you were when we tried to watch bringing up baby.

209
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:41,991
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:43,576
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was pretty fresh.

211
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:52,553
Speaker 1: Yeah this comic I actually think I don't know if I buy more because it seems like it's just the same Joke twisted slightly different over and over again.

212
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:53,960
Speaker 1: So like why should I get more?

213
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:04,220
Speaker 1: It's just you know, it's just more of the same but it's worth it to buy the one volume totally worth it Especially since this thing costs eight dollars and I paid way less than eight dollars.

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,016
Speaker 1: I paid probably like five dollars, but yeah, it's totally worth it.

215
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:13,111
Speaker 1: and I actually think Contrary to you know, what I guess might be the target audience.

216
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:20,400
Speaker 1: I think this comic would really appeal to moms Because they would totally identify with the mom in the cabin.

217
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:22,703
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to get.

218
00:14:23,024 --> 00:14:24,328
Speaker 1: see if my mom will read this.

219
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:28,120
Speaker 1: see if she'll she'll probably have much nostalgia for raising me and my siblings.

220
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:32,120
Speaker 0: So I guess the moral is by crayon Shinshan for your mom.

221
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:36,655
Speaker 1: Yeah by just you know one volume I wouldn't buy more than one volume unless you really like it.

222
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:38,807
Speaker 1: but by one volume Why the hell not?

223
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:40,240
Speaker 0: are you really like your mom?

224
00:14:47,270 --> 00:15:05,830
Speaker 0: Anyway things of the day now, we've reviewed utana a while ago, but we reviewed it in one of those You know, we talked a lot about why the show is good But we didn't really go into a lot of detail because it's a show that totally Totally can be spoiled a thousand times over and also so complicated that would take us like four shows to actually talk about it.

225
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:09,090
Speaker 0: So, uh, this is related to that only tangentially.

226
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:11,910
Speaker 0: But as I have to point out that you didn't listen to that review listen to it.

227
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,750
Speaker 0: If you haven't seen shoujo kakame utana, and you're an anime fan again, what the hell's wrong with you?

228
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,501
Speaker 0: That's like one of the greatest anime ever made.

229
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:30,667
Speaker 0: No anyway the one thing about utana is that a lot of people watch it and they finish it and All man and like every anime fan you want more but you know, there's no more.

230
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:31,650
Speaker 1: so they go to the movie.

231
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,796
Speaker 1: You're going to the movie.

232
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,182
Speaker 0: I'm not going to the movie now.

233
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:39,622
Speaker 0: everyone wanted more cowboy bebop But they knew that they shouldn't and couldn't get more.

234
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:40,947
Speaker 1: and then they made a movie.

235
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:41,510
Speaker 0: the movie came out.

236
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,849
Speaker 0: Anyway, I was like, oh man, but the movie came out with the knowledge that you really won't get any more now.

237
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,561
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the movie was sort of not.

238
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:51,590
Speaker 1: it was good, but it wasn't as good as the series.

239
00:15:51,811 --> 00:15:53,496
Speaker 0: Well, it was just a long episode.

240
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty long high production value episode.

241
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:55,983
Speaker 0: That was it.

242
00:15:56,244 --> 00:16:01,964
Speaker 0: Yep, but with utana Oh, I want more and then you might see oh, there's a movie.

243
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:07,541
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say right now don't watch that movie Just stay far away from attending the movie.

244
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:09,370
Speaker 1: It has nothing to do with the 10 of the TV show.

245
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:21,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's one thing to do with it The same characters in the same setting kinda kinda but Actually, I should link on to an aside.

246
00:16:21,551 --> 00:16:28,130
Speaker 0: But if you want to actually want to see the utana movie I'll link you at some point maybe in the forum to an anime music video from the movie.

247
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:31,380
Speaker 0: Watch that pretend that was the movie and get on with your life.

248
00:16:31,861 --> 00:16:34,570
Speaker 0: But uh, there is one other thing.

249
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:42,031
Speaker 0: utana was Manga, I forget the manga cuz the manga is so different that you would read the manga as like a precursor Like.

250
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:53,065
Speaker 0: this is the core of what became that because the manga was all Chiyo Saito II and the show was all Chiyo Saito and Ikuhara and the movie was all Ikuhara and only the middle was good.

251
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:54,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the manga is okay.

252
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:56,224
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I like Chiyo Saito a lot.

253
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:56,890
Speaker 1: I like the part.

254
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,450
Speaker 1: I like the manga volumes that do the funny stories like the multi power curry.

255
00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:05,963
Speaker 0: But a lot of people want more 10 and there's not much more utana out there.

256
00:17:06,063 --> 00:17:08,030
Speaker 1: did someone did some fan makes a mutana?

257
00:17:08,251 --> 00:17:13,730
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I'm talking about something as far as you haven't brought up yet because the drama the stage show the musical.

258
00:17:14,252 --> 00:17:17,122
Speaker 0: Um that is going to be wiped from my mind.

259
00:17:17,143 --> 00:17:19,069
Speaker 0: No, I can't unwatch that.

260
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,335
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm really dead.

261
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:22,559
Speaker 1: I don't know where you're going now.

262
00:17:22,659 --> 00:17:25,407
Speaker 0: There was a Sega Saturn game.

263
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:36,449
Speaker 0: Oh You're right there was and the Sega Saturn game from what I have been told from everyone who has ever played it is absolutely fantastic.

00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:07,957
Speaker 0: the toga gets to show his nipples and Akio gets to show his nipples like more So than anyone's ever showed nipples before.

290
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,387
Speaker 0: but no one lets I own just show his nipples.

291
00:19:10,688 --> 00:19:11,130
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm done.

292
00:19:11,472 --> 00:19:15,429
Speaker 1: I thought you're gonna say no one gets to see you tennis nipples wouldn't that?

293
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:18,489
Speaker 1: Wouldn't that be more what people want anyway?

294
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,282
Speaker 1: Anyway, so a lot of people are like, you know, what's the first anime?

295
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,812
Speaker 1: and just sort of say astro boy, you know That's.

296
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:30,736
Speaker 1: that's true in the sense that astro boy Was the first anime.

297
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:36,256
Speaker 1: that was like a TV series, you know, you know There's an episode on.

298
00:19:36,276 --> 00:19:37,965
Speaker 1: you know new episodes all the time.

299
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:38,770
Speaker 1: It continued.

300
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:42,105
Speaker 1: There was it wasn't very serial each episode.

301
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,829
Speaker 1: it was very episodic But it was the first like anime TV show that you know carried on.

302
00:19:47,712 --> 00:19:51,341
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean there was no animation in Japan before Tezuka.

303
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,670
Speaker 1: There were people in Japan making animations before Tezuka.

304
00:19:55,998 --> 00:20:12,407
Speaker 1: here is one of maybe it's not the best because I don't have a lot to compare it to but this particular incredibly old Japanese animation is Sort of a Steamboat Willie quality to it and it is.

305
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:24,394
Speaker 1: it has many things for the American anime fan to enjoy despite not having a translation Okay.

306
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:25,560
Speaker 1: So basically here's the deal.

307
00:20:25,962 --> 00:20:28,753
Speaker 1: This is a Anime black and white.

308
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:45,388
Speaker 1: it was made in the year 1934. the title of it is something something I can't read 1936. so it's a story about two years in the future and basically the story is this Cute animated characters live on an island and they're happy.

309
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,956
Speaker 1: Evil someone comes to bomb them.

310
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,139
Speaker 1: You'll see who the someone is.

311
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,168
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna spoil as evil someone evil someone.

312
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,032
Speaker 0: Oh my They.

313
00:20:56,514 --> 00:21:00,950
Speaker 1: and then they fight the evil someone and all the you know.

314
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:09,230
Speaker 1: Basically, you won't recognize it unless you know about Japanese fairy tales But all the you know folklore heroes of Japanese fairy tales.

315
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:14,370
Speaker 1: So think it would be the same as if like Humpty Dumpty and Mother Goose and the three little pigs came to save the day.

316
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:34,913
Speaker 1: it's it's sort of like that but Japanese and they come to save the day and there's a little bit of voice acting and as a Little bit of music and the sound effects are actually not so bad and the animation is pretty impressive for 1934 I guess and this is well worth watching all eight minutes of I Guarantee it.

317
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:43,181
Speaker 1: This is not only historic not only educational but it is still entertaining after About 70 80 years.

318
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:47,942
Speaker 0: I do have to say one thing though The semi main tiger guy is really creepy.

319
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:49,649
Speaker 1: The tiger is really fucking creepy.

320
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:58,039
Speaker 1: The snakes are kind of cool Especially the one part where they're like head up head down head up head there where they do a little dance And they have the machine gun lightning tongues.

321
00:21:58,059 --> 00:21:58,982
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

322
00:21:59,002 --> 00:22:00,849
Speaker 1: There's some other parts in there that are pretty good, too.

323
00:22:01,693 --> 00:22:02,758
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is good stuff.

324
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,708
Speaker 1: people you should totally check out this.

325
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:12,910
Speaker 1: actually I don't know if I ever made it a thing of the day, but there is sort of like this Museum ish like movie company.

326
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:27,370
Speaker 1: I forgot I have a link in my delicious somewhere way back where they sell like a DVD set that has like all the ancient Animes like this, I guess 1934 is ancient and like all in one DVD set, but it's a ludicrous amount of money.

327
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,327
Speaker 1: So I've never bought it, but I might buy it

328
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:43,690
Speaker 0: Right, so we're not talking about anime tonight, we'll probably talk about anime next week on Wednesday, but we have something Something we've waited mostly because we wanted to make sure that both of us had read all of it in its entirety.

329
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:46,366
Speaker 1: We actually have one more volume of it coming.

330
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:52,198
Speaker 1: Yeah yeah, but anyway the Did I do a geek back on this.

331
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:53,442
Speaker 1: a geek bite on this.

332
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,110
Speaker 0: previously you might have but now we can review this in fullness.

333
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:56,711
Speaker 1: Alright.

334
00:22:57,393 --> 00:22:59,619
Speaker 1: well we were going to review is a comic.

335
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,334
Speaker 1: it's actually a French comic called dungeon Written by.

336
00:23:05,354 --> 00:23:10,701
Speaker 1: I still don't know how to pronounce this dude's name even though I have like a whole bunch of comics written by him.

337
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,370
Speaker 1: is it like John's far?

338
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:20,589
Speaker 1: I think the last name has to be far, but the first name is either like Joan or John or so and it's not Joanne.

339
00:23:21,993 --> 00:23:23,401
Speaker 1: I think it's like John's far.

340
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:24,850
Speaker 1: I think is the correct way to pronounce it.

341
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,034
Speaker 1: I'm probably wrong, but whatever.

342
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:36,707
Speaker 1: This is the same guy who wrote like the ramp the Eisner award-winning rabbi's cat Professor's daughter Klezmer which is amazing.

343
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,070
Speaker 1: I can't think of any others, but they're all awesome.

344
00:23:41,191 --> 00:23:45,990
Speaker 0: Now the thing about this comic is that they're a whole but like it's almost it's kind of hard to figure out the order.

345
00:23:46,651 --> 00:23:51,716
Speaker 0: Luckily, there's a little guide in the front of most of them and also we're gonna tell you right now Pretty much it's.

346
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:54,205
Speaker 0: it's about a dungeon and it's set like.

347
00:23:54,466 --> 00:24:06,750
Speaker 0: there's the main comic Which is like during the zenith the height of the dungeon and then there's parade which is just more fun going on during that good Part of the dungeon and then there's the early years and then there's the Twilight and then there's the other one.

348
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,849
Speaker 0: We haven't read the side stories the monsters.

349
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:19,381
Speaker 1: Yes, basically if you like, you know, if you like things like like dungeon keeper or sort of like Trying to think of something else similar to this

350
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:21,010
Speaker 0: pretty much dungeon keeper

351
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:30,756
Speaker 1: yeah, basically anything where it's sort of like there's a happy dungeon and it's like there's a bunch of monsters and It's sort of like a comedic fantasy.

352
00:24:30,857 --> 00:24:32,321
Speaker 1: Everyone's hanging out in the dungeon.

353
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:34,327
Speaker 1: There's a lot of cool characters.

354
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,450
Speaker 1: There's lots of stuff.

355
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:46,079
Speaker 1: It's a big complicated dungeon and all sorts of little happy adventures happen in this dungeon and it's it's just a good time all around You know, you got what's his name Marvin.

356
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:48,227
Speaker 1: the dinosaur is the best you got.

357
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:48,930
Speaker 1: Herbert the duck.

358
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:51,980
Speaker 0: He's more of a dragon than a dinosaur is.

359
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,568
Speaker 1: yeah, but he loses wings and then he's sort of dinosaur.

360
00:24:54,648 --> 00:24:55,994
Speaker 0: ish Then he is.

361
00:24:56,034 --> 00:24:56,777
Speaker 0: he's still a dragon.

362
00:24:56,818 --> 00:24:57,621
Speaker 0: He's a breath weapon.

363
00:24:57,842 --> 00:24:58,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess okay.

364
00:24:58,746 --> 00:24:59,449
Speaker 1: He's a dragon.

365
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,430
Speaker 1: You got my favorite characters on go.

366
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:03,752
Speaker 0: I don't know.

367
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:07,388
Speaker 0: I think my favorite character in the end is either the dungeon keeper or the duck.

368
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:12,870
Speaker 0: Really really really like Marvin the dungeon keeper is high-quality.

369
00:25:13,272 --> 00:25:16,930
Speaker 1: Marvin's alright, but Zongo is by far the best.

370
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,400
Speaker 1: There's no competition for Zongo.

371
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:30,969
Speaker 0: This is actually about all told Theoretically, it's about this dungeon and the dungeon is like a typical fantasy dungeon But it's run like a business and it just it.

372
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:37,450
Speaker 0: It's a comic that takes itself seriously in that totally non serious way that as a result makes it really really good.

373
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:38,775
Speaker 1: yeah, it's basically.

374
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:45,549
Speaker 1: each volume is sort of like two stories almost and Each story is like it's a comedic story.

375
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:59,030
Speaker 1: But at the same time they have some sort of like lesson and moral in the story and it's it's sort of It's impressively highbrow for something that is so like slapstick and silly at most of the time.

376
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:02,487
Speaker 0: So I think we'll start with the good stuff and work our way down to the bad parts.

377
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:05,735
Speaker 1: All right, so Done I'm not exactly sure.

378
00:26:05,775 --> 00:26:06,618
Speaker 1: like the quote.

379
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:08,083
Speaker 1: correct reading order.

380
00:26:08,283 --> 00:26:10,567
Speaker 0: forget that we're going to order from good to bad All right.

381
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:19,455
Speaker 1: So dungeon zenith is the two volumes that are about the like the height of the dungeon when the dungeon is at its peak Operating efficiency.

382
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:27,433
Speaker 1: Yep, volume one duck heart and volume two the barbarian princess These this is like the best dungeon right here volumes.

383
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:36,509
Speaker 0: the one sad thing is that I read and so did Scott we read duck heart first volume one and That was far and away the best that dungeon ever had to offer.

384
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,410
Speaker 1: it is Definitely the best the dungeon has to offer.

385
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,778
Speaker 1: so if you're not but see the thing don't get us or like.

386
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:46,395
Speaker 1: it might sound like we're saying that this is a good comic and Then it sort of goes downhill.

387
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:50,931
Speaker 1: No, it's a fantastic comic that goes downhill to okay Is she kind of a?

388
00:26:51,291 --> 00:26:57,399
Speaker 0: the thing is if nothing else volume one by itself of zenith duck heart zenith zenith?

389
00:26:57,959 --> 00:27:01,062
Speaker 0: No is Absolutely Amazing.

390
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:02,268
Speaker 1: Oh, it's so great.

391
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:04,740
Speaker 0: The first half it's really in two halves.

392
00:27:05,021 --> 00:27:16,184
Speaker 0: The first half is utterly utterly just weird and offbeat and hilarious I mean when you I don't want to ruin it, but when you find out what the deal is with the elephants I laughed out loud

393
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:19,353
Speaker 1: when you find out what the deal is with the sword

394
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,138
Speaker 0: with pretty much everything.

395
00:27:21,178 --> 00:27:25,514
Speaker 0: Yeah Everyone's great, especially especially Horace.

396
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:30,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty much one of those stories We're like, there's a whole bunch of little things, right?

397
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,885
Speaker 1: but they're all really like.

398
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:38,066
Speaker 1: they're things that you really are really easy to fall in love with like the characters and the Little quirks and things even.

399
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:38,607
Speaker 1: you know.

400
00:27:38,667 --> 00:27:44,030
Speaker 1: Zongo is basically a guy who appears in maybe five panels at most and all he ever says Is Zongo.

401
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:45,240
Speaker 1: yet somehow?

402
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,899
Speaker 1: Like I like him that much, you know.

403
00:27:49,757 --> 00:28:00,499
Speaker 1: and Then the magic of it is sort of like how all these little things that you really like end up coming together to you know Create something that is greater than the whole in ways that you did not expect at all.

404
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:07,280
Speaker 0: Like it jumps around a lot and the humor is really goonie and I said offbeat but I that bears repeating it.

405
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:10,559
Speaker 0: It'll throw some curveballs at you while you're reading it.

406
00:28:10,971 --> 00:28:15,257
Speaker 1: Yeah Sometimes you might not even notice there was a joke like there'll be some sort of pun joke and you won't get it.

407
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,577
Speaker 1: and Then some character who will like point out the joke, but pretty much the second half.

408
00:28:20,738 --> 00:28:21,220
Speaker 0: It's weird.

409
00:28:21,503 --> 00:28:31,659
Speaker 0: The first half is really funny and weird And the second half is it really borders on the Philosophical and it it has such a different tone that you almost feel like you're reading a different comic.

410
00:28:32,282 --> 00:28:34,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because the setting sort of changes.

411
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:37,519
Speaker 1: they take you out of the dungeon in the second half and there's your sorta.

412
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,720
Speaker 1: You're in the dungeons there, but you're going around the world a lot looking at things and you know seeing what's outside the dungeon.

413
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:47,595
Speaker 1: So it doesn't really have the same sort of feeling as the first half.

414
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:52,800
Speaker 1: and you know It's sort of instead of following sort of like all the stuff going on in the dungeon.

415
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:10,080
Speaker 1: it really is a more narrowly focused story on a few characters on sort of a journey, but The journeys that the journey stories in dungeon are weird because it's not like beginning end It's like beginning get somewhere then sort of turn and go in a direction that you didn't expect but sort of make sense.

416
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:14,100
Speaker 1: And I guess keep turning around until eventually there's like a resting place.

417
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:17,532
Speaker 0: I mean it the second half just it's all.

418
00:29:17,652 --> 00:29:19,880
Speaker 0: it's almost like an exercise in philosophy.

419
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:20,908
Speaker 0: And it it.

420
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:21,231
Speaker 0: I don't.

421
00:29:21,413 --> 00:29:22,300
Speaker 0: that might sound strange.

422
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,160
Speaker 0: It's really hard for me to explain it without ruining a whole bunch of things.

423
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,764
Speaker 0: But when you get to the point where he's learning how to fight I won't even say who he is.

424
00:29:30,165 --> 00:29:34,177
Speaker 0: and then they fight the goblins and they go through the doors.

425
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:35,220
Speaker 1: Oh, that was a great.

426
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:35,963
Speaker 1: I love that part.

427
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:37,850
Speaker 0: That part is so weird though.

428
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,713
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

429
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's good though.

430
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,260
Speaker 1: I love that part That's greatest.

431
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:55,457
Speaker 0: But I think like that and just the whole thing with the two islands where two people are sent to two different islands For a long time to cultivate two different civilizations and then eventually the civilizations come into conflict and it's nothing more than a lesson.

432
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,460
Speaker 0: and it It goes over that so quickly and it's it's weird.

433
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,604
Speaker 1: That's one thing is it?

434
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:06,296
Speaker 1: the comic really feels like what are those paintings that that the?

435
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:07,660
Speaker 1: what's that guy who does the paintings?

436
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,766
Speaker 1: It's just like a whole lot of stuff crammed in really tight and like you can sit there for hours Just looking at all the little things.

437
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:14,590
Speaker 1: He's painted in there.

438
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:15,795
Speaker 1: You know what I'm talking about.

439
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:16,518
Speaker 1: Yeah.

440
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,980
Speaker 1: Yeah This is sort of like one of those like the dungeon.

441
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:31,770
Speaker 1: It feels like the dungeon itself is a lot of things is a huge dungeon but like each room is like a you know a dungeon room with you know traps and treasures and monsters and each one is different and interesting in its own way.

442
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:44,200
Speaker 1: and It's sort of like the whole comic is this big painting with a lot of stuff crammed in really tight But each thing that's crammed in really tight has a lot of substance to it, you know.

443
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,960
Speaker 1: So in a couple pages you get like a heaping portion of comic there, you know.

444
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,128
Speaker 1: And it really I like it a lot

445
00:30:51,570 --> 00:31:15,191
Speaker 0: and I think what the thing I like the most about the second half Is that the dialogue between because it kind of turns into one of those but not really a buddy cop comic But two buddies who were very different But they get along and a really like togas and bato and ghost in the shell in the movies like the kind of the way they talk to each other and how they they quote things at each other and they snipe at each other And they've got each other's backs with this kind of unspoken camaraderie.

446
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:15,533
Speaker 0: Yep.

447
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:19,326
Speaker 1: All right, so that dungeon Z. That's dungeon Z is one you wanna talk about.

448
00:31:19,346 --> 00:31:22,740
Speaker 0: dungeon Z is - it's more of the same and it's almost as good.

449
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much It's not it doesn't.

450
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:31,872
Speaker 0: it seems like after the philosophical bit in the very beginning It pretty much goes away from that and no comic goes back to that.

451
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:32,514
Speaker 0: None of them.

452
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:43,702
Speaker 1: No dungeon parade is More, you know All four of the comics dungeons zenith one and two and parade one and two deal with the dungeon and sort of the same set Of characters.

453
00:31:43,742 --> 00:31:45,226
Speaker 1: that are the ones that you really like.

454
00:31:45,426 --> 00:31:52,144
Speaker 1: and I guess chronologically story wise the two parade volumes are in between The zenith volume.

455
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:57,120
Speaker 1: so it's like zenith one parade one parade two zenith two is the story order.

456
00:31:57,381 --> 00:31:59,448
Speaker 1: But it doesn't really matter that much.

457
00:31:59,528 --> 00:32:01,214
Speaker 1: you can read these four volumes.

458
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:05,049
Speaker 1: as long as you read the ones before the twos It'll totally make sense and it won't matter.

459
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:14,319
Speaker 1: and You know while zenith one is by far the best of these four volumes if you like zenith one I recommend that you buy all four of these volumes.

460
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:21,120
Speaker 1: Yes Most definitely because zenith two is still very very good and parade one and two are also very very good.

461
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,449
Speaker 1: But nah, there's a little bit.

462
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:24,220
Speaker 1: it's something missing from them.

463
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,702
Speaker 1: But it's not.

464
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:26,990
Speaker 1: it's not enough missing to make it not worth buying.

465
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,094
Speaker 0: No, this might sound it's.

466
00:32:28,315 --> 00:32:36,980
Speaker 0: it's almost like zenith Was good in it like in its own right and parade was only good because I had read zenith.

467
00:32:37,524 --> 00:32:38,533
Speaker 1: I have to agree with that.

468
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:45,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz Parade on its own didn't really make me like the characters so much but it was more of one of those.

469
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:49,912
Speaker 1: I like the characters so much because of zenith one and two.

470
00:32:50,353 --> 00:32:54,247
Speaker 1: that just reading more stories about these Characters was good enough.

471
00:32:54,368 --> 00:33:04,900
Speaker 0: Even if they weren't the best stories in the universe Normal stories that like when the wizard in zenith two gets that this eyeball and it like it Lee it pops and starts leaking.

472
00:33:05,341 --> 00:33:11,220
Speaker 0: The like the four panels of him reacting to it leaking are our comedy goal super comedy.

473
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:15,586
Speaker 0: I'm reading through it right now.

474
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:18,440
Speaker 0: So I'm remembering all the things that yeah rim has all the volumes.

475
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,520
Speaker 1: That's why I might be talking about them in a rather vague manner.

476
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,155
Speaker 1: Cuz I read them a few weeks ago and I haven't looked at him since.

477
00:33:25,235 --> 00:33:34,440
Speaker 0: but this is one of those things that Upon reviewing it I really want to avoid talking about what actually happens because you really got to experience it and I feel like spoilers aren't just worthy.

478
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:41,280
Speaker 0: Now there's another volume called that I made up anymore doesn't even make sense.

479
00:33:41,701 --> 00:33:44,650
Speaker 1: No, there's another volume called dungeon the early years.

480
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,172
Speaker 0: No, alright.

481
00:33:45,192 --> 00:33:55,860
Speaker 1: Alright now dungeon the early years is about One of the characters and in the dungeon story and it takes place way before the dungeon even exists.

482
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,112
Speaker 0: Now here's the gripe I have with everything after what we've already talked about.

483
00:33:59,514 --> 00:34:01,100
Speaker 0: They have nothing to do with dungeon.

484
00:34:01,802 --> 00:34:02,906
Speaker 1: Well thing it had.

485
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:07,099
Speaker 1: it sort of gives you a subtle hint as to how the dungeon sort of came to be.

486
00:34:07,602 --> 00:34:10,340
Speaker 1: But other than that, it really has nothing to do with dungeon.

487
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:18,299
Speaker 1: it feels like there should have been an early years volume 2 that's missing and I really didn't like it that much.

488
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:19,748
Speaker 1: It was kind of so.

489
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:21,460
Speaker 0: so I can add some good moments.

490
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,525
Speaker 0: But it and it.

491
00:34:22,866 --> 00:34:25,860
Speaker 0: it might have been a good story on its own but it didn't live up to dungeon.

492
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:31,719
Speaker 0: And I expected like founding the dungeon or stuff with all the characters young.

493
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,000
Speaker 0: But no, it's just this completely unrelated story that happens to involve a few cameos.

494
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,987
Speaker 1: Basically, it's weird in that.

495
00:34:39,068 --> 00:34:40,674
Speaker 1: I feel like it's.

496
00:34:40,915 --> 00:34:42,320
Speaker 1: I guess I'll say that later.

497
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,708
Speaker 1: But yeah the the early years it is.

498
00:34:44,728 --> 00:34:53,362
Speaker 1: I think it's too early a year and that the thing I like so much about dungeon were all these characters that made me like and since and the setting and the.

499
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:58,973
Speaker 1: the prologue Barely scratched the the characters or the setting at all.

500
00:34:59,255 --> 00:35:00,540
Speaker 1: So I had a hard time liking it.

501
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:09,017
Speaker 1: Maybe it was because I was expecting something and maybe if I hadn't read if I read the early years first Maybe I would have felt differently about it because I wouldn't have had.

502
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:14,338
Speaker 1: you know This sort of desire for more of the good dungeon in me, you know, but I don't know.

503
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:22,868
Speaker 1: Yeah early years if you read Zenith and parade and like them you might want to like You know peak at early years before you pay for it.

504
00:35:23,048 --> 00:35:26,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only good thing about the early years at all was Alexandra.

505
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:31,571
Speaker 1: yeah, pretty much and even that it like it didn't really give you.

506
00:35:31,591 --> 00:35:38,975
Speaker 1: it's sort of like there's a mystery and Then the solution to the mystery is sort of anti-climactic and sort of okay.

507
00:35:39,517 --> 00:35:43,852
Speaker 1: It's not like oh That's what that was that they were alluding to.

508
00:35:43,993 --> 00:35:47,111
Speaker 1: It's sort of like oh Alright just okay.

509
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:48,440
Speaker 1: Alright, whatever.

510
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:48,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

511
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:56,107
Speaker 1: So like when you want to when you have a prologue to something you want to see like the crazy hidden past Secrets like oh snaps.

512
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:59,640
Speaker 1: That's what that was like you because they they hint at the secret pass.

513
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,609
Speaker 1: You expect the secret pass to be something crazy.

514
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's something mundane and boring.

515
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,100
Speaker 0: I guess the early years could have been good if it hadn't had anything to do with dungeon.

516
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:09,715
Speaker 0: I guess yeah, even then it needed more.

517
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:14,902
Speaker 1: Yeah The other volumes you've got is dungeon Like the.

518
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:16,124
Speaker 0: I like Twilight.

519
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:26,080
Speaker 0: now, I gotta make this clear again Zenith Zenith Awesome parade more the same mostly the early years.

520
00:36:26,421 --> 00:36:34,360
Speaker 0: Okay, Twilight now if the early years had nothing to do with dungeon Twilight has nothing to do with dungeon.

521
00:36:34,481 --> 00:36:35,934
Speaker 1: Well, basically here's the thing, right?

522
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:41,054
Speaker 1: I Expected dungeon Twilight to be about the downfall of the dungeon, right?

523
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,900
Speaker 1: Because it's like, okay, this is the end of the dungeon.

524
00:36:44,103 --> 00:36:56,468
Speaker 1: that would be a good expectation, but basically what happens is At the beginning of dungeon Twilight the dungeon has been down fallen for a long time and now you're talking post Apocalyptic future here.

525
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:02,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like a way future and I'm like, ah it's sort of like You read.

526
00:37:02,862 --> 00:37:14,986
Speaker 0: it's like that dragon movie or it was gonna be so awesome and they're like 40 years later.

527
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:17,116
Speaker 0: It's like oh you've skipped the only part.

528
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:17,859
Speaker 0: I wanted to see.

529
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:20,432
Speaker 1: yeah You know how a lot lots of fantasy rate of fire.

530
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,940
Speaker 0: That was the name that that movies suck.

531
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,512
Speaker 1: Don't watch lots and lots of fantasy, you know.

532
00:37:24,593 --> 00:37:27,081
Speaker 1: universes fictional fantasy of course They're fictional.

533
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:40,300
Speaker 1: their fantasy universes have sort of this common thing where there was a great war in the past or there's going to be A great war in the future something along the you know, some great event some cataclysm some something, right?

534
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:51,860
Speaker 1: But you never actually see that that's something that is like part of the history or part of you know Some omen in the future like a Ragnarok kind of thing that never you never actually see the story of that.

535
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:58,440
Speaker 1: Alright, it's like if you read I guess Lord of the Rings is the only one where they actually you know.

536
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:01,159
Speaker 1: You get to read about the big events, you know.

537
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:12,420
Speaker 0: But the thing is though you read about the big events in the Lord of the Rings But the past the great and glorious past that was so actually epic that makes the actual Lord of the Rings look like piddly nothing.

538
00:38:13,203 --> 00:38:16,255
Speaker 0: You don't want to actually read that because it's not that interesting summer aliens.

539
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,790
Speaker 1: Okay, it's okay But it's worth reading if you're.

540
00:38:18,871 --> 00:38:22,502
Speaker 0: if you're you know, oh, yeah I guess it's more than the stories like the.

541
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,405
Speaker 0: it's kind of like.

542
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:32,220
Speaker 0: you're better off reading about the story of the fall because the story of the ancient great things or The ancient super powerful things often are much more difficult to make interesting.

543
00:38:32,441 --> 00:38:36,300
Speaker 1: Yes, but this dungeon Twilight is well after the fall of the dungeon.

544
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:46,600
Speaker 1: I wanted to read about the fall of the dungeon because they sort of hint and you can piece together What happened at the fall of the dungeon and it's really awesome and I wish the comic was about what happened then.

545
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, they not.

546
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:51,860
Speaker 0: they make a big reveal where basically I saw it coming a mile away.

547
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:58,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they make the big reveal and all I could think was the same thing Scott thought which was why wasn't this about that?

548
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,080
Speaker 0: Now it was cool that they skipped a bunch of it because they make the reveal but they don't actually say what happened.

549
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,380
Speaker 0: It's just heavily implied from the dialogue between the two characters exactly what happened.

550
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:23,364
Speaker 0: But and that would have been a really cool mechanic or device, but it's used to such crap effect and they pretty much immediately say well never mind that and and that's where it gets really bad because Twilight vol 2 Okay, here's the deal.

551
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:23,645
Speaker 1: Right?

552
00:39:23,906 --> 00:39:26,896
Speaker 1: So Twilight vol 1 there was a crazy.

553
00:39:26,956 --> 00:39:28,200
Speaker 1: the dungeon fell, right?

554
00:39:28,482 --> 00:39:31,000
Speaker 1: It's obvious from the cover of the book the dungeon fell, right?

555
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:42,060
Speaker 1: So you wish you could have read about the dungeon falling because you love the dungeon, but instead you basically the last Remaining, you know pieces of the dungeon that are still in existence in the world.

556
00:39:42,601 --> 00:40:00,820
Speaker 1: they sort of give it another go and that's dungeon Twilight vol 1. and it's It's bad and it's not what you want But it's not as bad as Twilight vol 2. because at the end of Twilight vol 1 You know, it's sort of getting close to a climax like at the pace it was going.

557
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,540
Speaker 1: I figured that around the middle of Twilight vol 2 it was gonna get crazy go nuts and maybe it would have been great.

558
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:09,989
Speaker 1: But instead I'm like the first few pages.

559
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:15,125
Speaker 1: we're talking like three pages of Twilight vol 2. they're like Okay.

560
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:25,508
Speaker 1: Yeah that all that stuff that happened in Twilight vol 1 whatever It's it finished and now a completely unrelated thing We're gonna give you right now and it's so just.

561
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:28,176
Speaker 0: I hate to say this, but it's crap.

562
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:29,400
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty bad.

563
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,366
Speaker 0: I didn't even read it.

564
00:40:30,446 --> 00:40:37,477
Speaker 1: I got I read it all but I Was pretty much just going and I was sort of frustrated and grumbly until it was.

565
00:40:37,517 --> 00:40:38,220
Speaker 0: I lost interest.

566
00:40:38,301 --> 00:40:38,966
Speaker 0: So I kept like.

567
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:40,760
Speaker 1: I definitely lost interest.

568
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:42,499
Speaker 1: I said hey, I'd be like, but I read it.

569
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,130
Speaker 0: Anyway page page flip flip flip flip.

570
00:40:45,412 --> 00:40:49,231
Speaker 0: the only the only redeeming part at all Is that the dragon girl is really really cute?

571
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:53,760
Speaker 0: Yeah dragon girls cute But that's all that comic has to offer.

572
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:58,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically all the characters in that are not the characters that you've got.

573
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:02,678
Speaker 0: There seems to be a common theme here in Twilight.

574
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:06,032
Speaker 0: The only good thing was the cute dragon girl and in early years.

575
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:08,120
Speaker 0: The only good thing was the cute snake girl, right?

576
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:16,340
Speaker 1: So basically, I guess that shows that what made dungeon zenith and parade so great was not great plots.

577
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:26,179
Speaker 1: It was great characters and a great setting and watching all those things interact and getting you to really like all these things.

578
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,663
Speaker 1: and They didn't.

579
00:41:27,683 --> 00:41:28,829
Speaker 1: that's why parade worked.

580
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:33,614
Speaker 1: because even though the stories and parade weren't so great it was all these, you know characters you like.

581
00:41:33,634 --> 00:41:34,478
Speaker 1: so it totally worked.

582
00:41:34,498 --> 00:41:47,779
Speaker 1: and early years and Twilight went so far away from those characters and setting that There's nothing to like anymore because it was just the same kind of bleh plots and parade But without the stuff you liked.

583
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:55,620
Speaker 0: So yeah Buy what we told you to buy and don't buy the rest unless you're really really desperate now.

584
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,062
Speaker 1: This might.

585
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:57,609
Speaker 1: this isn't impossible to find.

586
00:41:57,669 --> 00:42:01,948
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what's in print and what's not in print But I was able to get all the volumes.

587
00:42:02,129 --> 00:42:04,680
Speaker 1: so I don't see any reason you shouldn't be able to get all the volumes.

588
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,919
Speaker 1: Um, there's one other volume dungeon monsters, which is sort of like let me read from Wikipedia here.

589
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:14,780
Speaker 1: It features secondary characters from throughout the story.

590
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:20,540
Speaker 1: Monsters stories can be set anywhere in the timeline and feature occasional appearances by the major characters.

591
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:25,220
Speaker 1: So that might be interesting because I there might be like I haven't read it.

592
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,200
Speaker 1: It's coming in the mail, you know, like a month or so.

593
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:36,160
Speaker 1: But it might have like a Zango story or you know Because that's the thing is in the main part of dungeon the side characters were all so awesome.

594
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,179
Speaker 1: They were the secondary characters in the main and Zenith were better than the main characters in any other part.

595
00:42:41,943 --> 00:42:46,188
Speaker 1: So if there are little vignette stories about them I might like that.

596
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:48,540
Speaker 1: so the verdict on monsters is still out.

597
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:52,839
Speaker 1: But as for the rest you stick to the Zenith in the parade if you like the Zenith.

598
00:42:59,181 --> 00:43:01,768
