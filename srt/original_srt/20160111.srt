1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,524
Speaker 1: It's Monday January 11th 2016.

2
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,065
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

00:00:13,587 --> 00:00:15,875
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:23,560
Speaker 1: nuclear vessels Not to get into the details because it's more of a metamoment thing, but we got a lot of conventions coming up.

5
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,973
Speaker 0: I know one convention per month for January February March April.

6
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:29,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I've got more.

7
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:32,014
Speaker 1: and south Yeah, egg fest egg fest.

8
00:00:32,277 --> 00:00:36,920
Speaker 1: then We've got a Zenkai con Pax East anime Boston, I forgot about Zenkai con.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe five conventions.

10
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,680
Speaker 1: Well, you said you might skip at a Zenkai con.

11
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,794
Speaker 0: So I technically skipped a lot of Zenkai cons.

12
00:00:42,835 --> 00:00:43,640
Speaker 0: Why not skip some more?

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,590
Speaker 1: I did tactically put in panels that I could do on my own.

14
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:50,423
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm cuz I'm and also I'm only going Saturday and Sunday I'm not going Friday.

15
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:50,845
Speaker 1: Mmm.

16
00:00:51,045 --> 00:00:57,707
Speaker 1: I'm praying to head out like Friday night like after work in the Amtrak cuz Bolt buses don't go to Lancaster.

17
00:00:57,928 --> 00:01:01,800
Speaker 1: No one goes and there is an Amtrak station actually near the convention center.

18
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,726
Speaker 0: It's just down the street.

19
00:01:02,907 --> 00:01:03,793
Speaker 0: It's a straight shot.

20
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:04,760
Speaker 1: So I could live with that.

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,519
Speaker 0: I could live with that as long as it's not too cold.

22
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:12,545
Speaker 1: So I bitch a lot on the show about how there's no phone for me And you know, I want to buy the experience.

23
00:01:12,565 --> 00:01:19,084
Speaker 1: the Sony Xperia z5 compact is probably the best cell phone hardware In the world.

24
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,873
Speaker 1: if you want to run Android, it's waterproof like everything about.

25
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,860
Speaker 0: does it run the newest Android without any bullshit?

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,044
Speaker 0: 6.0.

27
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:25,826
Speaker 0: Also, it's Sony.

28
00:01:26,288 --> 00:01:30,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's 6.0 troubling with some Sony bullshit in it, right?

29
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,947
Speaker 0: A lot you don't trust Lenovo.

30
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:37,809
Speaker 0: you're gonna trust Sony who is the first to put like, you know Evil spyware DRM on us on an audio CD.

31
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:38,331
Speaker 0: You know what?

32
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:40,800
Speaker 1: I do trust Sony more than I trust Lenovo.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,788
Speaker 1: Sony's malware is at least well constructed.

34
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,238
Speaker 0: So yeah, Sony actually has like the best cameras right now.

35
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the problem.

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,043
Speaker 1: So he has really good heart.

37
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:56,580
Speaker 1: if Sony could be split into a hardware company and a bullshit company I feel like Sony do real well.

38
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, just sell your hardware with no software on it whatsoever.

39
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:04,325
Speaker 0: people will take the Sony a7s camera and it'll just run Android instead of Whatever that garbage it runs.

40
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,496
Speaker 1: now, you don't understand how good that z5 compact is.

41
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,740
Speaker 1: is a phone like it's so good?

42
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,425
Speaker 0: Could it be?

43
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:13,130
Speaker 0: it's also tiny Better than iPhone 5.

44
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:20,114
Speaker 1: I say well the thing is I gets hard to compare Apples to androids because the OS like the experience is so different.

45
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:26,620
Speaker 1: So in terms of hardware though I think it's better than the iPhone 5 better than the iPod mini the iPod nano.

46
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:30,170
Speaker 1: That might actually be too small for a phone right now.

47
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:33,160
Speaker 1: Well, I could have a separate screen like on my wrist like a big screen.

48
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,183
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

49
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,878
Speaker 1: that I could not play nourishing my hacks on a like 40 by 40 screen.

50
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:40,500
Speaker 0: That's fine.

51
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:48,462
Speaker 1: Anyway, and there's a rumor that's pretty substantiated that there's gonna be Another.

52
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,411
Speaker 1: there's gonna be a third pillar of the iPhone land.

53
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,280
Speaker 1: There's gonna be the iPhone C class devices.

54
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,425
Speaker 0: Well, they already have that.

55
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,554
Speaker 1: they had an iPhone 5c and then they got rid of it.

56
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:58,819
Speaker 0: I think you can.

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,823
Speaker 0: Can you still get it?

58
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,892
Speaker 1: It's not they're not making them anymore.

59
00:03:01,912 --> 00:03:03,720
Speaker 1: And let me check the Apple store.

60
00:03:04,102 --> 00:03:06,120
Speaker 1: It was widely considered to be a failure.

61
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:09,480
Speaker 0: Oh, we have a lot of them at work and a lot of my co-workers bought him and loved them.

62
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:19,300
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so some of them still use them widely considered to be a failure, but Apparently they have a deep fandom among people who wanted a smaller phone.

63
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:30,641
Speaker 0: so right now the iPhones you can get that are currently in production are the six six s and Five s which is just an iPhone 5 pretty much which is slightly better I guess.

64
00:03:31,223 --> 00:03:35,438
Speaker 1: so the the iPhone 6c or it might be a 7c.

65
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:36,100
Speaker 1: We're not sure.

66
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,566
Speaker 0: This is the year of iPhone 7.

67
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:38,591
Speaker 0: So it's September.

68
00:03:38,611 --> 00:03:40,078
Speaker 0: They're gonna announce the iPhone 7.

69
00:03:40,078 --> 00:03:40,439
Speaker 0: I'll get it.

70
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,218
Speaker 1: So the rumor is unless April or May they might announce the 6c.

71
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,683
Speaker 0: That's a big deal.

72
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:52,181
Speaker 0: and it makes this rumor less credible because the iPhones have been on a September schedule for years yes,

73
00:03:52,302 --> 00:04:01,771
Speaker 1: and the rumor is that the C devices are gonna be on their own separate schedule and Partly because of lackluster iPhone sales from the previous they

74
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:11,077
Speaker 0: did decrease orders on iPhones to you know the manufacturers in China recently because basically we're at a point where everyone's just fucking got a phone and the phones are lasting longer.

75
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:16,640
Speaker 1: if you've got like an iPhone 6s a lot of people have no reason to get the 7 when it comes out, right?

76
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,560
Speaker 0: It's like well, I mean if you have iPhone 5 like you're still fucking good today And iPhone 5s iPhone 4 is even good today.

77
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:23,226
Speaker 0: So it's okay.

78
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,320
Speaker 0: people are good with phones for now Like they're not buying iPhone 6s and 6s is at the rate that they expected.

79
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:37,620
Speaker 0: So like they got workers who are just like at home not working over in China not making iPhones because Apple's like we don't need Anymore only order this many and androids the same way.

80
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,953
Speaker 1: I mean I'm using a Nexus 5 and you know what.

81
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,082
Speaker 1: there is no better Android phone Like.

82
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:50,440
Speaker 1: sure you could get a 5x But there is nothing better in the 5x as far as any user of a phone except Conrad would care about.

83
00:04:51,426 --> 00:04:59,654
Speaker 1: so The rumor is that they're gonna release this iPhone 6 ish hardware in a size.

84
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:02,797
Speaker 1: the rumor ranges from iPod touch.

85
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:04,585
Speaker 1: That's the perfect touch.

86
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:06,612
Speaker 0: We have an iPod touch at work the newest one.

87
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's incredible.

88
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, so good.

89
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,880
Speaker 0: So the size the shape the thin everything about it is a mirror is a miracle.

90
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,773
Speaker 1: There's a credible rumor that it's gonna be that size.

91
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:16,697
Speaker 1: give or take a millimeter.

92
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:17,440
Speaker 0: I'll pay for that.

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,340
Speaker 0: Okay, I'll pay more for the smaller one.

94
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,537
Speaker 1: so the biggest that it would be appears to be an iPhone 4.

95
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:26,607
Speaker 0: that's iPhone 4 was the perfect size.

96
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,335
Speaker 0: iPhone 5 had a better screen.

97
00:05:28,356 --> 00:05:32,452
Speaker 0: It was a better device But compared to the iPhone 4 it was thinner, which is good.

98
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:34,700
Speaker 0: The thinness is better, but it was it was too long.

99
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:38,860
Speaker 1: Look at that comparison, that's the phone.

100
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,155
Speaker 0: The iPhone 5 was too long.

101
00:05:41,195 --> 00:05:42,242
Speaker 0: the iPhone, you know It was like.

102
00:05:42,262 --> 00:05:45,320
Speaker 0: I want the iPhone 5 but just not as long as the iPhone 5.

103
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:50,200
Speaker 0: I'm gonna be iPhone 4 height, but with all the stuff that was in the iPhone 5 only probably faster nowadays.

104
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:51,525
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's also.

105
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:55,440
Speaker 1: it looks like they're gonna ditch the plastic cuz they made him kind of like colorful.

106
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,906
Speaker 0: I like the color of a plastic.

107
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:59,296
Speaker 1: They're gonna have the same metal as every other iPhone.

108
00:05:59,356 --> 00:06:00,260
Speaker 0: I want colors though.

109
00:06:00,601 --> 00:06:02,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they'll have the green color.

110
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:02,730
Speaker 1: green me.

111
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,196
Speaker 1: They probably won't have rose gold.

112
00:06:04,216 --> 00:06:05,320
Speaker 1: They'll probably keep that there.

113
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,908
Speaker 0: I don't wanna bullshit rose gold.

114
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:09,240
Speaker 0: I always get the boring gray one, but that's cuz there's no green.

115
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:11,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there was a there was like a metal green.

116
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,138
Speaker 1: green me up Scott the Xperia's have a green option.

117
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:15,700
Speaker 0: big deal.

118
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:18,800
Speaker 0: Hey, it doesn't help but everything behind the green is garbage.

119
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:27,943
Speaker 1: He is the only reason I didn't get a z5c now because you can get a gray market one in the US even though it's not released in the US and confirmed Android 6.

120
00:06:27,943 --> 00:06:31,940
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't get one is that because it's the international edition.

121
00:06:32,503 --> 00:06:37,779
Speaker 1: It's missing two or three LTE channels Which wouldn't matter that much?

122
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,559
Speaker 1: Except most of the new coverage that t-mobile and other people are putting out is in those bands in the u.s.

123
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,276
Speaker 0: Well, you can't be using t-mobile now that the CEO is like EFF.

124
00:06:47,296 --> 00:06:48,100
Speaker 0: Who the fuck is that?

125
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we'll see what I do with phones.

126
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,505
Speaker 1: You can read these rumors.

127
00:06:52,525 --> 00:07:07,920
Speaker 1: the iPhone 6c will probably come out ahead of the iPhone 7 to get a sales bump Because then they expect that a bunch of people will buy that who will otherwise wouldn't have upgraded during the seven cycle Because there's a bigger demand for a small phone than people realize.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,020
Speaker 0: I can't do anything until the iPhone 7 comes out in September October.

129
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,095
Speaker 1: I the rumors also that it's gonna be cheaper like a lot cheaper, but not cheap.

130
00:07:15,496 --> 00:07:25,218
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't matter Talking like 400 ish bucks That's a good deal, which is still like especially now since the subsidies and contracts are all gone now in the US.

131
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,540
Speaker 0: Goodbye I mean, but I think that's also what's hurting new iPhone sales.

132
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:29,942
Speaker 0: Is that?

133
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,935
Speaker 0: is that as people need to buy iPhones now and they're like, oh $800 fuck that.

134
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:35,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what also is hurting?

135
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:42,199
Speaker 1: that honestly the hardware on phones is good enough for 99.9% of what anyone does with them.

136
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:46,718
Speaker 1: The only limiting factor that anyone gives a shit about is either the size or the battery life.

137
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,685
Speaker 1: Yep Except for old people.

138
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,735
Speaker 0: I don't know why people have such problems with battery life.

139
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:53,400
Speaker 0: fucking charge your phone I mean, I've never had my phone die out.

140
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,240
Speaker 0: I've had to come close at conventions But I always make it to the hotel room with like 5% and then I plug it in and go to bed.

141
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,601
Speaker 0: I wake up.

142
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,153
Speaker 1: It's 100 or if I'm really like not sure I'm gonna make it.

143
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,460
Speaker 1: I do have in my bag that tiny battery.

144
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:10,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, I only have to use that at conventions where I wake up way early and get back to the room at like 2 a.m.

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,509
Speaker 0: So that's how long my phone battery lasts.

146
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,655
Speaker 0: How could you possibly run out your battery?

147
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,200
Speaker 0: What the hell are you watching movies on?

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,306
Speaker 0: Are you watching Netflix?

149
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:21,620
Speaker 0: that are like all day while you're at this?

150
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,600
Speaker 0: Apparently to watch a lot of Netflix to kill that battery.

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,940
Speaker 1: So, uh as much as I would like to stay on Android there is literally no Android phone to buy at all.

152
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,049
Speaker 1: Like they're all garbage.

153
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,480
Speaker 1: They're all giant pieces of garbage.

154
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,403
Speaker 0: I hope you didn't spend a lot of money on Android apps cuz I spent a lot of my own iPhone app So I can't leave.

155
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:38,006
Speaker 1: I spent about.

156
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:38,850
Speaker 1: I'll lose all that.

157
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:42,597
Speaker 1: I've spent about 40 bucks on Android apps so I'll probably lose about 40 bucks worth.

158
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:51,480
Speaker 1: but As much as I know I'm gonna bitch about Andrew our iPhones OS and interface for a while just because it'll be different is nothing to bitch about.

159
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm used to Android and I like Android.

160
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,775
Speaker 0: but the Android ship sailed.

161
00:08:55,815 --> 00:08:57,140
Speaker 0: there aren't any good Android phone.

162
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,540
Speaker 1: So if a small iPhone comes out, like I'll just jump ship without even looking back.

163
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,223
Speaker 1: I'll put up with.

164
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:07,759
Speaker 1: even if I hate the main complaint people have with iPhone They can't get rid of some of those icons.

165
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,092
Speaker 0: He's hide him in a folder.

166
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:09,960
Speaker 0: big fucking deal, right?

167
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,169
Speaker 0: And then the other thing people come in.

168
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:12,460
Speaker 0: I was like, how do you do this, right?

169
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,531
Speaker 0: A lot of my co-workers like how do you do this?

170
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:15,054
Speaker 0: I just want to.

171
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,200
Speaker 0: I just don't have files.

172
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:18,188
Speaker 0: It's like well dude my coworker today.

173
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,000
Speaker 1: Oh, he like he uses a. he has an Android phone.

174
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,940
Speaker 1: He's like, how do I get to the file Explorer on my phone?

175
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,367
Speaker 1: I was like plug it into your computer.

176
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:27,096
Speaker 1: and he was like no, but I want it on the phone.

177
00:09:27,116 --> 00:09:29,433
Speaker 0: and I was like Yeah, why it's like.

178
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,840
Speaker 0: you just have to accept the fact that you're gonna do the same thing.

179
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,180
Speaker 0: You can still do everything that you do by with your file Explorer finder, whatever.

180
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:38,967
Speaker 0: You just got to do it differently, right?

181
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,160
Speaker 0: For example, I got a movie and I want to watch it on my phone.

182
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,867
Speaker 0: Right, so you could use iTunes.

183
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,454
Speaker 0: people hate iTunes for no reason.

184
00:09:45,474 --> 00:09:47,925
Speaker 0: that I understand always works for me But everything works for me.

185
00:09:47,965 --> 00:09:50,355
Speaker 0: Apparently, I don't like iTunes something.

186
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:51,600
Speaker 1: I have no use for I write.

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
Speaker 0: But another thing you can do is you can get the VLC app for your iPhone or iPad.

188
00:09:56,322 --> 00:09:59,978
Speaker 0: You can then access your video files in like 20 different ways.

189
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:05,779
Speaker 1: Scott I realize that most people like even relatively young people never heard of VLC.

190
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,164
Speaker 0: Okay, you can get the Amazon.

191
00:10:07,184 --> 00:10:08,688
Speaker 1: look at all of our unnamed friends.

192
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,620
Speaker 1: maybe icons who use like ghetto virus player, right?

193
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,283
Speaker 0: And maybe it's.

194
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,840
Speaker 0: maybe it's music you want to get on to there with your drag-and-drop.

195
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:22,647
Speaker 0: well Just drag all your music into Amazon music player into the cloud and then install the Amazon music app and up Look, there's all your music.

196
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,580
Speaker 0: same with the Amazon Kindle app, which is free.

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:31,806
Speaker 0: Also, you can just drag PDFs and shit onto the internet in the cloud from your computer and then open up the app on Your phone and there they are.

198
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:34,140
Speaker 0: So you don't need any file Explorer nonsense.

199
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:36,941
Speaker 1: So anyway, I'm probably gonna jump ship if this comes out Like.

200
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,700
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna pre-order day one like immediately and never look back.

201
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,465
Speaker 0: Oh cuz you're like.

202
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:42,960
Speaker 0: that's right cuz you're not on this two-year cycle that I'm on.

203
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,960
Speaker 0: You're just like whatever there's a phone you can do because I I'm at the end of my cycle.

204
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,560
Speaker 1: I'm at the point of I would upgrade my Android phone.

205
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,300
Speaker 1: I'm on and there is literally no phone in the world that is better enough.

206
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,003
Speaker 1: They make such.

207
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:59,600
Speaker 0: I made such a good move by that iPhone 3g on day one waited in line for like a half hour.

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,640
Speaker 1: Also, yeah, yeah, so I think Scott has some Apple iPhone news - well, this is news.

209
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:21,840
Speaker 0: We've discussed this before because this is not the first time for this rumor But the rumors coming back so hard and strong this time that I feel like, you know It definitely has all the hallmarks of being even more true than the rumor you just had Yeah, which is that they're really gonna get rid of the headphone port on that iPhone and perhaps other I devices.

210
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:31,732
Speaker 0: I would be moderately annoyed because the TRS the TRS and then they're just gonna make you either a use bluetooth headphones or B which a lot of people already do.

211
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:32,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

212
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:38,680
Speaker 0: or B Plug headphones that go into the lightning cable or get an adapter that goes from lightning to headphones.

213
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:49,548
Speaker 1: So in my experience most bluetooth headphones, the sound quality is good But it's actually noticeably not as good as my like sure or etymotic TRS just regular.

214
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,155
Speaker 0: I had bluetooth headphones at work.

215
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:51,737
Speaker 0: I still have them.

216
00:11:51,757 --> 00:11:52,380
Speaker 0: They were really good.

217
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:09,331
Speaker 1: The problem is they were cheap and the little head thing snapped and they won't stay on my ears Actually, so interestingly for the 5c or the 6c not the 5c 6c 7c the rumors Specifically show that they still have TRS.

218
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:10,897
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz they're not thin.

219
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:14,520
Speaker 0: Yeah The reason they're getting rid of is because it's like it's the thickest thing in there.

220
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,590
Speaker 1: So get rid of the 5c that and the 5c that.

221
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:27,660
Speaker 0: the headphone jack and the camera are pretty much the only things keeping them From making the phone like a lot smaller, but they can't make the phone that thin if they also make it small in the other dimensions.

222
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:30,430
Speaker 1: So the 6c has to be fatter.

223
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,120
Speaker 1: so there's no benefit to getting rid of TR.

224
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,660
Speaker 0: This is why lightning is such a tiny thin connector, right?

225
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,647
Speaker 0: It's anyway, but yeah I mean the thing is lightning.

226
00:12:38,707 --> 00:12:51,980
Speaker 0: as far as I know and I could be wrong the old dock connector You're the big wide one that was on iPods Yeah But they used for like the early iPhones the 3g and whatnot That dock connector had a ton of pins on it and some of those pins had analog audio output.

227
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:58,960
Speaker 0: So you could actually get a really simple connector that would go into the dock connector and then headphones or cassette tape.

228
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,395
Speaker 0: That's in your car or you know, all kinds of stuff.

229
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:02,200
Speaker 0: and I had this right?

230
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:07,674
Speaker 0: It was really simple cuz like the you know It had in there somewhere with some of those pins are for charging.

231
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:08,940
Speaker 0: some of them were for firewires.

232
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,169
Speaker 1: I remember I had a device that I basically plug cuz.

233
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:20,979
Speaker 1: I had my iPod nano and it had a TRS in the bottom Yeah, and I plugged a device into that that Re-broadcasted my audio over local FM.

234
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:22,157
Speaker 0: So I had one of those two.

235
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:33,881
Speaker 0: But anyway, the lightning connector as far as I know is a hundred percent digital Which means if you want to get a headphone adapter that goes into the lightning hole that that has to have a digital to analog converter Right.

236
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:43,673
Speaker 0: So the thing that you're gonna shove into the bottom of your iPhone to then put your headphones into is probably gonna Cost a lot of money if I know Apple 30 bucks or 50 bucks.

237
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:46,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, which we talked about this on the episode I'm not gonna get into.

238
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:53,017
Speaker 0: like YTR They already have a connector that goes from that to HDMI and I have that connector and it's like 50 bucks.

239
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:53,418
Speaker 1: Yep.

240
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:02,100
Speaker 1: I suspect There's gonna be a lot of people complaining about this on the internet and freaking out but the reality is no one's gonna actually care.

241
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:04,268
Speaker 1: No who had who uses iPhones?

242
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,180
Speaker 1: No, no one's gonna not buy the next iPhone because of this.

243
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:13,446
Speaker 0: And I think someone someone is You know that really obstinate person.

244
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:17,760
Speaker 1: I don't know if that person yeah that person has never actually owned an iPhone.

245
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,617
Speaker 1: That person is running GNU Linux in their basement on their desktop there.

246
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:23,300
Speaker 1: No, they got Amiga.

247
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:26,249
Speaker 0: Mmm, I did the what the only it's not.

248
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,800
Speaker 0: it's fine if we get rid of this old connector, right?

249
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,026
Speaker 0: It's not the you know, we can.

250
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:30,407
Speaker 0: we have.

251
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:31,412
Speaker 0: Bluetooth is fine.

252
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,200
Speaker 0: It's also an open standard, right?

253
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,260
Speaker 0: Lightning is sort of open ish, right?

254
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,926
Speaker 0: even though no one else uses it but Apple.

255
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:45,508
Speaker 0: but the problem is if you go to the store and Suddenly this, you know, you could buy any headphone in the store right now It would really suck if you went to the store.

256
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,082
Speaker 0: It's like no you got to buy the right Headphone.

257
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,750
Speaker 0: you can't just buy any headphone.

258
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,100
Speaker 0: You got to buy the right one and you bought the wrong ones.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:59,200
Speaker 0: They don't work, you know, we need to make sure that every device in the whole earth You know from this point forward uses the same thing, right?

260
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,100
Speaker 1: You don't have it because everything's gonna be you the USB right?

261
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:09,608
Speaker 0: It's now we've done this plenty of times right USB then newer USB except, you know There's gonna be piece from.

262
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:13,365
Speaker 0: you know, there's gonna be people who have our Side to HDMI.

263
00:15:13,385 --> 00:15:15,652
Speaker 0: We didn't have a problem.

264
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:18,420
Speaker 1: A lot of people had problems along the way and we just let them perish.

265
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:24,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not really the biggest deal As the other thing is we can't once we pick something right?

266
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,779
Speaker 0: We can't be changing it as frequently as we change USB.

267
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:37,616
Speaker 0: We got to be changing it like once in a blue moon because you don't want to be buying headphones and then suddenly I buy Lightning headphones and then five years from now apples like yeah, no more lightning.

268
00:15:37,656 --> 00:15:38,419
Speaker 0: It's like fuck you.

269
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:47,871
Speaker 1: Well, I remember I had you know, my old iPod was like you can get iPods used to use firewire Mm-hmm, and then I had a firewire port and I would use it.

270
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,608
Speaker 1: and then I got a new iPod and it just didn't work With firewire anymore.

271
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:53,419
Speaker 0: Yeah that USB only yeah.

272
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,624
Speaker 1: So I have an anecdote that's relevant to that in terms of people Misunderstanding those things.

273
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,920
Speaker 1: after we ran our freshman year in college at RIT.

274
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:11,160
Speaker 1: So this is like 2001. we all went back home and I was back at home You know in Michigan hanging out and a lot of my high school friends were around.

275
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:20,898
Speaker 1: I went to a party and they wanted to watch a movie and then they say how rim You should help us set up the home stereo theater, whatever.

276
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:21,480
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

277
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,539
Speaker 0: They actually asked the person who knows best because a lot of times I go somewhere and it's like I see the TV.

278
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:28,285
Speaker 0: It's clearly not in HD Even though it's in the HDTV.

279
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:34,348
Speaker 0: I see that they're not using HDMI and it has nothing to do with me But they're like no one wants to hear my advice.

280
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,994
Speaker 1: You're going to computer school.

281
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:37,560
Speaker 1: So you know how to do this.

282
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:38,645
Speaker 0: You do know how to do it.

283
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:45,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I go back behind their TV and what I see is RCA cables plugged into component.

284
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:51,704
Speaker 1: All right on the DVD player and plugged into the RCA inputs on The TV.

285
00:16:51,805 --> 00:16:59,906
Speaker 1: so that wasn't working clearly but there was also and as video cable plugged into the DVD player and That was plugged into the TV.

286
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:03,820
Speaker 1: and their complaint was that the HD whatever has always worked fine.

287
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:07,280
Speaker 1: But the sound never works unless video is video only.

288
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,069
Speaker 0: So as video is video only.

289
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,599
Speaker 1: so the fact that you could plug the same cable into an RC.

290
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,799
Speaker 1: You know RCA connectors were used for both component and the old RCA analog stuff.

291
00:17:18,423 --> 00:17:20,798
Speaker 1: People just plug cables randomly into all that.

292
00:17:21,502 --> 00:17:24,919
Speaker 0: That's a mistake of the design of component cables actually was that they were the same.

293
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:30,680
Speaker 1: You know big stick in the middle ring around the edge cables, yeah, I feel like I should have made them a slightly different size.

294
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,189
Speaker 0: You know modern cable design.

295
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:36,360
Speaker 0: they make sure that you know cables can only go in the right way.

296
00:17:36,782 --> 00:17:38,413
Speaker 0: You know, you can't possibly put them into something.

297
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,380
Speaker 0: That's not where they belong.

298
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't.

299
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:47,132
Speaker 1: if they're directional they make them a shape so that they only go in in the early days of building computers Like you plug a cable in the wrong way.

300
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:48,640
Speaker 1: Everything's fried forever.

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, now if you open up your computer, it's not possible to put something in the wrong spot.

302
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,080
Speaker 0: It just won't fit.

303
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,760
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean you'd be like a hard drive into the wrong half of a parallel cable.

304
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,882
Speaker 0: It just wouldn't work and you wouldn't know why like I used to get IDE ribbon cables that didn't have that little notch in The middle.

305
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,845
Speaker 0: Oh, and you'd have to know looking at the red stripe on the ribbon Which direction it went in.

306
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:11,020
Speaker 1: on the mother the red stripe we had to be closest to the power on the drive.

307
00:18:11,221 --> 00:18:14,780
Speaker 0: I would look at the motherboard instruction manual to see the numbers on the pin out.

308
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,186
Speaker 0: So I would put it towards the zero.

309
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,774
Speaker 1: and but the worst one.

310
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,180
Speaker 0: now you have an SATA cable.

311
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:25,446
Speaker 0: You can't fuck it up unless you can't even if you can fuck you fuck up an SATA cable putting it the wrong place Or the wrong whatever.

312
00:18:25,868 --> 00:18:27,035
Speaker 0: you can't even build a Lego set.

313
00:18:27,055 --> 00:18:27,819
Speaker 0: You're so dumb, right?

314
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,109
Speaker 0: Like a baby Lego like Duplo.

315
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:31,697
Speaker 1: So I got one last little news here.

316
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,340
Speaker 1: This is kind of fun.

317
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,113
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read the anecdote from slash jock cuz.

318
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:34,799
Speaker 1: it's just kind of funny.

319
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:42,459
Speaker 1: An anonymous reader writes Nvidia GPUs don't clear out memory that was previously allocated and neither does Chrome.

320
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:57,060
Speaker 1: When a user recently fired up Diablo 3 several hours after closing an incognito mode window that contained pornography The game launched with snapshots of that last private browsing session appearing on the screen.

321
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:00,574
Speaker 1: So what I'm gonna actually link to instead of the slash dot.

322
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:01,780
Speaker 1: I like how they're very open.

323
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,720
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, I was looking at porn and then I saw my porn in Diablo when I launched it.

324
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,945
Speaker 0: Well, this is really interesting.

325
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:11,160
Speaker 0: So what happens is when your computer is drawing to the screen, right?

326
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,940
Speaker 0: There's a space in them in the video memory called the frame buffer and what it's doing is drawing literally your screen.

327
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,200
Speaker 0: So let's say your screen is 800 by 600, which is a really old computer.

328
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,036
Speaker 0: You've got basically like an array and each pixel on the screen is 32-bit color or 24-bit color.

329
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:32,255
Speaker 0: So you have 24 bits times 800 times 600 that many bits in a space.

330
00:19:32,836 --> 00:19:34,480
Speaker 0: and the computer has to draw the screen.

331
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,449
Speaker 0: so what it does is it arranges those bits.

332
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,424
Speaker 0: it says aha the top left pixel is Pure green.

333
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:47,426
Speaker 0: so in those, you know, 24 bits it puts zero zero FF zero zero All right, and there's your bits.

334
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,594
Speaker 0: and then it says what's the next pixel?

335
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,400
Speaker 0: and it does this ridiculously fast.

336
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:56,828
Speaker 0: It does this so fast that it can draw all the pixels on the screen at 75 frames a second.

337
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,080
Speaker 0: usually you're 60 or whatever your frame rate is, right?

338
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,348
Speaker 0: Yeah So is a space in the memory where it fills up.

339
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,300
Speaker 0: it writes down in memory what color every pixel is and then the video.

340
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:17,200
Speaker 0: You know hardware Sends turns that space and memory into a signal that it sends to your monitor and the monitor takes that and draws the pixels On the screen and it keeps doing this over and over again.

341
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:34,057
Speaker 0: Usually you'll do like double buffering or triple where you'll have like multiple buffers and it'll be drawing multiple screens at once Or it'll be just draw a screen and while that one's being displayed It starts drawing the next screen and then once it finishes drawing that screen and it starts being displayed It starts using the previous memory space and over and over.

342
00:20:34,077 --> 00:20:36,440
Speaker 1: Yeah Now it's a good security practice.

343
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:45,922
Speaker 1: Applications or operating systems should theoretically wipe out or make an accessible memory that has been released by Theoretically.

344
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:58,700
Speaker 0: if you could access someone's frame buffers or if the computer is storing up old frames and not using the same as X space in Memory, you could see what the person did on that computer going into the past regardless of what they were doing.

345
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,940
Speaker 0: If you can access the video cards memory, you can access basically screenshots.

346
00:21:03,482 --> 00:21:07,232
Speaker 1: So this guy so however far horn guy he was like, huh?

347
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:10,040
Speaker 1: I wonder if I can just get shit out of the frame buffer.

348
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:11,325
Speaker 1: This is a big security hole.

349
00:21:11,345 --> 00:21:13,495
Speaker 1: Let me play around in the intro.

350
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,600
Speaker 1: I'm quoting him, right?

351
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,880
Speaker 0: So here's the thing is that the chrome and most modern browsers does not clear memory for you.

352
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:26,260
Speaker 0: They're using the GPU to render right your browser, you know image, right?

353
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,740
Speaker 0: So and your computer is generally using the GPU to render everything these days even 2d stuff.

354
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:36,080
Speaker 0: So now the GPU is storing up all these things right with you know in its in its video ran.

355
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,535
Speaker 1: So this guy wrote an application and you just across users just on the PC period.

356
00:21:40,595 --> 00:21:41,599
Speaker 1: no security at all.

357
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,040
Speaker 1: That would scan GPU memory because you can just read it all apparently.

358
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:50,379
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, I mean you can write a program and see that just tell sends commands to the GPU and it'll do so.

359
00:21:50,580 --> 00:22:01,626
Speaker 1: We wrote a program that just look for non zero pixels Get grabbed everything it could get and then did some algorithms to rearrange because it would get like Corners and parts of images.

360
00:22:01,646 --> 00:22:03,934
Speaker 1: and he recreated all these reddit pages.

361
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:12,660
Speaker 1: He'd been reading previously pixel perfect and Yeah, you can just totally spy on people many hours after they looked at their porn just by scanning.

362
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,888
Speaker 0: The real question is there's a bug in Diablo.

363
00:22:14,968 --> 00:22:18,120
Speaker 0: Why did Diablo upon and he's surrender some Diablo like crash.

364
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,036
Speaker 1: He said it was just like Diablo freakishly crashed, you know video game.

365
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:21,720
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

366
00:22:21,821 --> 00:22:22,427
Speaker 0: So it wasn't.

367
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:23,700
Speaker 0: it wasn't like a bug in Diablo.

368
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:28,560
Speaker 1: He started Diablo cuz that'd be weird if it's normally was porn and then it crashed.

369
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:31,860
Speaker 0: Normally when a video game loads, you know, it says loading for a long time.

370
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:44,469
Speaker 0: Usually what it's doing is copying all of its textures from this the hard drive into the video memory And then when it starts rendering that allows the video card to quickly apply those textures To all the surfaces and whatever it is.

371
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,211
Speaker 0: It needs to render.

372
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,299
Speaker 1: So if you can replace crash, right?

373
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,980
Speaker 1: So if is he goes to join me calm, right?

374
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:58,100
Speaker 0: So if a picture, you know If his porn site was in that Space and memory it would get applied to something like as if it was a texture and be rendered.

375
00:22:58,301 --> 00:22:59,126
Speaker 1: Oh my god, he didn't.

376
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,320
Speaker 1: he censored out the image, but he didn't censor out.

377
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:06,314
Speaker 1: So he was looking at redhead teen Mary McCray fingered in the hallway.

378
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,617
Speaker 1: All right, awesome.

379
00:23:07,698 --> 00:23:08,239
Speaker 0: That sounds hot.

380
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:24,019
Speaker 1: So, yeah I guess if you look at things whatever they might be in your incognito windows and you share that computer with people or Anyone has malware cuz you know malware has probably been doing this for years.

381
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:29,059
Speaker 0: It probably hasn't but I think it might start now cuz someone who writes malware will see this.

382
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:34,426
Speaker 1: Yeah at the same time if I was gonna write malware and I was trying to steal passwords Oh, they're not gonna steal password.

383
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:35,731
Speaker 0: some screenshots cuz you can't see him.

384
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:39,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you could probably steal credit card numbers Mm-hmm.

385
00:23:39,411 --> 00:23:41,200
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway.

386
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,887
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

387
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:49,849
Speaker 1: this blog.

388
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:56,733
Speaker 1: I follow it because it's just about like war and peacekeeping and just sort of an interesting Look at that world from a hobbyist perspective.

389
00:23:56,894 --> 00:23:58,180
Speaker 0: Haha obvious of war.

390
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

391
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:01,917
Speaker 1: It's like if you're if you know about war and war nerds and stuff.

392
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:05,089
Speaker 1: It's just a cool blog But basically and it's got irrelevant.

393
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:06,695
Speaker 0: What we're not a good kind of nerd to be.

394
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:12,340
Speaker 1: we did an episode in 2007 Scott that we just called weapons needed ideas.

395
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,223
Speaker 0: We still need ideas.

396
00:24:13,223 --> 00:24:18,618
Speaker 1: 2007 running out of ideas sentiment and this is an article about a gentleman who?

397
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,746
Speaker 1: Basically worked for the.

398
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:24,546
Speaker 1: he had a. he had a gun shop in Manhattan But it didn't sell.

399
00:24:24,626 --> 00:24:24,888
Speaker 1: good.

400
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:25,932
Speaker 0: You could still have a gun shop.

401
00:24:25,953 --> 00:24:27,460
Speaker 1: I know it didn't sell guns.

402
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,052
Speaker 1: It sold custom holsters for concealed guns to hide them.

403
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,904
Speaker 0: I guess that's like all the bong shops We have.

404
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:34,570
Speaker 0: you can't sell.

405
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,679
Speaker 0: we be you can sell bones.

406
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:44,372
Speaker 1: But actually that was a front for the CIA and the FBI and in the back of the office He just fucking made crazy one-off custom guns for spies.

407
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:48,590
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could tell by going to a shop like that I mean the stuff the place that sells bongs.

408
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:49,715
Speaker 0: you can get weed there.

409
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:51,845
Speaker 0: Yeah Everybody knows.

410
00:24:51,985 --> 00:24:54,274
Speaker 0: I actually don't know the place that sells gun holsters.

411
00:24:54,595 --> 00:24:55,700
Speaker 0: You can get guns there.

412
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:59,700
Speaker 1: I don't know if I could get weed at the place downstairs because you see you know that bodega by us.

413
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,616
Speaker 1: They the whole front of the building is nothing but bongs.

414
00:25:03,777 --> 00:25:04,540
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can get weed.

415
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:12,937
Speaker 1: I don't know if I walk in there like hey, you can at least get weirdo tobacco to put in a hooker Yeah, but I don't know if I went to them and I was like, hey, can I buy weed from you?

416
00:25:13,057 --> 00:25:14,985
Speaker 1: if they'd be like Yes, how many weeds would?

417
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:19,159
Speaker 0: well you they might discriminate against you being a white dude thinking you're a cop, right?

418
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,507
Speaker 0: I might be the only reason they say no.

419
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm also kind of a nerd hipster, dude.

420
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,533
Speaker 1: So maybe that I mean no cop looks like me.

421
00:25:26,553 --> 00:25:27,097
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

422
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:31,550
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah They talk about because a lot of this got declassified.

423
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:41,080
Speaker 1: now the kinds of crazy weapons this dude made Because all this stuff was very recently declassified and a lot of what he did apparently is still classified.

424
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,120
Speaker 1: But I think my favorite one and they made a lot of these is a 12 shot clipboard.

425
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:57,049
Speaker 1: so Specifically for someone who's negotiating with a terrorist hostage taker to sit down with them to go over their demands and then Kill everyone in the room.

426
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:59,639
Speaker 1: I Guess except the hostages.

427
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,205
Speaker 1: Okay, I learned about.

428
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:03,730
Speaker 1: so check this out.

429
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,880
Speaker 1: This is a sight, you know guns have different kinds of sights apparently spies.

430
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:09,740
Speaker 1: We're like we generally don't shoot people far away.

431
00:26:10,181 --> 00:26:16,260
Speaker 1: We need pistols that are good for like killing people in the room with us like pretty close range.

432
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:27,560
Speaker 1: So they have this custom kind of sight that's designed for like quick hip shots Like whip a gun out and shoot someone like gangsters doing old movies and the whole gun is covered in teflon.

433
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:31,034
Speaker 1: So you can draw it quickly and without a drop.

434
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:37,637
Speaker 0: drop it quickly Yeah, well snag on anything just fall on the ground because you can't hold on to it might as well cover it in Greece.

435
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:41,033
Speaker 1: woman Have you got any race?

436
00:26:41,356 --> 00:26:47,667
Speaker 0: Yes Okay, so I kick-started something a while ago Because it was nine dollars.

437
00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:48,973
Speaker 0: It was one of those tiny computers.

438
00:26:49,014 --> 00:26:49,074
Speaker 0: Now.

439
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,320
Speaker 0: We got plenty of tiny computers.

440
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,308
Speaker 0: You got the Arduinos of the world.

441
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,552
Speaker 0: There's a Microsoft one.

442
00:26:53,572 --> 00:26:55,580
Speaker 0: This is Texas Instruments one, right?

443
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,300
Speaker 0: There's the Raspberry Pi which is mad popular these days.

444
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:02,260
Speaker 1: It's the kind of things that ideally reason I don't kick-start all these things that I never have a good reason to use them.

445
00:27:02,361 --> 00:27:03,470
Speaker 0: I don't have a good reason to use it either.

446
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:04,560
Speaker 0: but this one is nine bucks.

447
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,808
Speaker 0: So I'm like whatever who gives a shit right nine bucks.

448
00:27:06,828 --> 00:27:07,752
Speaker 0: I get a tiny computer.

449
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,980
Speaker 0: I don't care, you know, it might be useful.

450
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:10,829
Speaker 0: It's really tiny.

451
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,860
Speaker 0: It's only nine dollars.

452
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,060
Speaker 0: I won't miss the nine dollars if this computer sits in my you know with my Arduinos and whatnot.

453
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:17,727
Speaker 0: No biggie what.

454
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,591
Speaker 0: and I forgot about it.

455
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:19,575
Speaker 0: cuz well, you know, I kick.

456
00:27:19,595 --> 00:27:23,178
Speaker 0: sometimes you kick-start something You just don't forget remember it and then one day it shows up.

457
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:31,567
Speaker 0: so I opened it and this is the chip computer C dot H dot I dot P and I checked it out cuz I had it now for nine bucks.

458
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,375
Speaker 0: And then I realized what the hell it was.

459
00:27:35,177 --> 00:27:37,159
Speaker 0: and oh my god Let me tell you a story.

460
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,964
Speaker 0: So I used to work in college at this place and I was programming for you know This board.

461
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:51,274
Speaker 0: it was a single board computer with an Intel x scale CPU And it had like 16 megabytes of storage or something like.

462
00:27:51,615 --> 00:27:52,960
Speaker 0: it was really really weak.

463
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:54,527
Speaker 0: It was kind of big cuz.

464
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,180
Speaker 0: he had a lot of serial ports and input outputs and things like that.

465
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,560
Speaker 0: But it was really really weak and tiny and didn't have much storage at all.

466
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:05,177
Speaker 0: And I had to program for this thing and one of them cost like 500 bucks.

467
00:28:06,881 --> 00:28:08,406
Speaker 0: This thing cost nine dollars.

468
00:28:08,466 --> 00:28:09,228
Speaker 0: It's really tiny.

469
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:12,960
Speaker 0: the bottom of it has a plastic thing so you can just rest it on your desk.

470
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:15,579
Speaker 0: No problem, it gets power from micro USB.

471
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:19,120
Speaker 0: It has one actual USB port for plugging in a mouse keyboard whatevs.

472
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,454
Speaker 0: It has a TRS connector, but is?

473
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:31,280
Speaker 0: the TR is audio But then the second R is video so you can plug it into the RCA on a TV or whatever to see what you know.

474
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:37,339
Speaker 0: the display It has a whole bunch of pins on the top just like an Arduino does for you know.

475
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,368
Speaker 0: Controlling electronic devices or an LED readout or analog inputs and all that kind of stuff.

476
00:28:42,449 --> 00:28:43,010
Speaker 0: power you know.

477
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:49,620
Speaker 0: But the specs on this thing for nine dollars for this ridiculously tiny computer.

478
00:28:50,182 --> 00:28:56,200
Speaker 0: The CPU is a 1 gigahertz CPU which is guess that can get stuff done as long as it's not games.

479
00:28:56,602 --> 00:29:08,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean my CPU is only 2.6 ish 512 megabytes of RAM a Four gigabyte SSD just like built into this little book.

480
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,826
Speaker 0: yeah, and it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

481
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:11,709
Speaker 0: the Wi-Fi is GN.

482
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,036
Speaker 0: The Bluetooth is 4.0.

483
00:29:14,036 --> 00:29:18,169
Speaker 0: You can use it and it runs Debbie, and it's already runs Debbie and as soon as you get it.

484
00:29:19,272 --> 00:29:20,094
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

485
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:24,106
Speaker 0: You can do it like more than the Raspberry Pi like Raspberry Pi is junk.

486
00:29:24,166 --> 00:29:25,570
Speaker 0: now basically because this exists.

487
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,570
Speaker 1: You know what I would use those for if I had my druthers.

488
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,918
Speaker 1: You could get let's see a gig of RAM $18 so $20 per gigabyte of RAM.

489
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:37,316
Speaker 0: Right this thing is ridiculous.

490
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:42,050
Speaker 0: I mean you could basically take a monitor and strap this to the back and boom you're done.

491
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:45,614
Speaker 1: Yeah I would say you know conventions like Kinetic on or whatever.

492
00:29:45,814 --> 00:29:50,472
Speaker 1: if we could get a bunch of TVs to stick like by panel ops just stick one of those things on The TV.

493
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:50,653
Speaker 1: do.

494
00:29:50,673 --> 00:29:54,930
Speaker 0: this thing can run pretty much any emulator NES SNES, right?

495
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:55,592
Speaker 0: It can.

496
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:57,498
Speaker 0: you can run like all sorts of Linux.

497
00:29:57,518 --> 00:29:58,741
Speaker 0: you can run Chrome on here.

498
00:29:59,002 --> 00:30:00,868
Speaker 0: you could run audacity on here.

499
00:30:00,928 --> 00:30:01,449
Speaker 0: you could run.

500
00:30:02,773 --> 00:30:12,390
Speaker 0: You know the GIMP emails VLC Pretty much anything that runs on Linux will run on this thing and run a surprising number of games in that actually.

501
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:16,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you want it to be super portable you need to find a battery for it.

502
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,321
Speaker 0: You know how much power does it draw.

503
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:19,810
Speaker 1: I mean I could probably power for a while.

504
00:30:20,272 --> 00:30:27,076
Speaker 0: I mean if you get a giant battery that has micro USB output which every battery does Got that like 26,000.

505
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:30,106
Speaker 0: Whatever milliamp hour battery like you're freaking good to go.

506
00:30:30,126 --> 00:30:31,229
Speaker 0: like this thing is redonk.

507
00:30:31,851 --> 00:30:36,990
Speaker 0: If you have any sort of project that needs any sort of you know CPU off to the side.

508
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:46,536
Speaker 0: I think Arduino and also Raspberry Pi pretty much have to eat it because the chip is here In the meta moment.

509
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,050
Speaker 1: the book club book was a long time ago the wheel of time.

510
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:55,318
Speaker 1: I bring this up because I'm moving on to book 8 and what I can say is that my Favorite thing about the wheel of time.

511
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:57,830
Speaker 1: or you know the ale like those guys yeah at them.

512
00:30:59,212 --> 00:31:02,710
Speaker 1: So there's a bunch of ale wannabe weeaboos that come up later.

513
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:08,026
Speaker 1: So there are people who aren't ale people in like tier and all these places like whoa like the young nobles.

514
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:10,134
Speaker 1: those ale are Super cool.

515
00:31:10,214 --> 00:31:11,179
Speaker 0: They just want to be like that.

516
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:17,603
Speaker 1: They start acting like them wearing each other guys Shan or we start wearing ideal clothes Yeah, and half the ale like ideal food.

517
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:27,807
Speaker 1: half of the ale are like wow We these we gotta keep spread the word of how to act like civilized human beings Because they're finally getting it and the other half are like what the fuck are these kids doing?

518
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:28,509
Speaker 1: can we just kill them?

519
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,678
Speaker 0: Seriously guys dat cultural appropriation.

520
00:31:31,738 --> 00:31:35,270
Speaker 1: I just go kill them, but there's a scene where one dude remarks like Iran.

521
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:45,355
Speaker 1: Can I just go murder all those kids because they're really not offensive just personally annoying to me That appropriation.

522
00:31:45,456 --> 00:31:46,682
Speaker 1: we are going to be at Pac South.

523
00:31:46,802 --> 00:31:48,350
Speaker 1: our schedule is slightly updated.

524
00:31:49,113 --> 00:31:59,610
Speaker 1: As a favor we let them move Atari game design to the earlier slot because someone Needed that panel slot because they have to video a packs like penny arcade panel, and we don't really give a crap.

525
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they email me.

526
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:05,590
Speaker 1: They're like yeah, you guys have done like every like a billion packs panels.

527
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,454
Speaker 1: You okay with this?

528
00:32:06,654 --> 00:32:06,815
Speaker 0: like?

529
00:32:06,855 --> 00:32:07,337
Speaker 0: I don't care.

530
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, like maybe if they'd put it at like 8 a.m.

531
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,837
Speaker 1: On Friday, I'd be like no, but I don't care.

532
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:13,840
Speaker 0: do whatever you want.

533
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,165
Speaker 1: Atari game design.

534
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:19,320
Speaker 1: Saturday at 1130 a.m Scared yet a discussion of horror and games.

535
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:26,750
Speaker 1: Saturday at 5 30 p.m Sunday January 31st at 1 p.m Designing game rules.

536
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:30,650
Speaker 0: Also packs is now having a night runner tournament Pac South.

537
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,150
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Sunday morning at 11 so I can play a little bit and then go to a panel.

538
00:32:35,391 --> 00:32:39,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then I get a fly immediately to Boston from San Antonio.

539
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,437
Speaker 1: That has no direct flights anywhere.

540
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:44,330
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell no one wants to fly directly to Santa.

541
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:48,385
Speaker 1: No one wants to fly directly to New York from San Antonio like no one except us.

542
00:32:48,605 --> 00:32:49,870
Speaker 0: That's right is really interesting.

543
00:32:50,131 --> 00:33:02,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I expected to not get a direct flight to Boston from somewhere like San Antonio But can't even get one from New York Really, you should be able to get a flight from New York to anywhere on planet earth that has an airport directly, right?

544
00:33:03,451 --> 00:33:13,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there might be those flights that are like once a week, you know If you want to go to a certain country, there's not a flight every day Scott when I flew to Turkey, there's multiple flights every day to Istanbul.

545
00:33:14,051 --> 00:33:19,201
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying like if you want to fly to say Luxembourg direct is there really a flight every day.

546
00:33:19,221 --> 00:33:20,245
Speaker 1: I think there's at least one every day.

547
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,530
Speaker 0: There might be one a day, right?

548
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:31,377
Speaker 1: It's not like you could go at the time you want, you know Let me put it this way New York spoils you so bad on flights and you want if you wanna die from London To somewhere else even London.

549
00:33:31,457 --> 00:33:35,850
Speaker 1: It's like oh, there's only like one flight to Paris left today.

550
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,903
Speaker 0: You want to go to Buenos Aires, is there really a flight every day?

551
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:45,589
Speaker 0: maybe one a day at most maybe one every other You know, yeah, it's like how many people are going to Argentina from?

552
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,046
Speaker 0: right, New York every day.

553
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:51,281
Speaker 1: But uh PAX East coming up.

554
00:33:51,341 --> 00:33:52,565
Speaker 1: we put our panels in for that.

555
00:33:52,706 --> 00:33:53,710
Speaker 1: So stay tuned.

556
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:55,569
Speaker 1: What else we got?

557
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:57,755
Speaker 1: We put in our panels.

558
00:33:57,875 --> 00:34:00,483
Speaker 0: magfest is coming before any of those magfest.

559
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:03,130
Speaker 1: We got like seven fucking panels.

560
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,094
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome.

561
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:11,829
Speaker 1: But also magfest is four days long Oh my god, and it's too early to even book our travel for that, but we'll be there.

562
00:34:13,393 --> 00:34:29,050
Speaker 1: Also the patreon edging toward that first stretch goal surprisingly, so if we get not that many more patrons if Even a quarter of the people listening to these words right now gave us just one dollar Just one dollar you don't even have to commit to giving it to us forever.

563
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:32,178
Speaker 0: Everyone listening probably did give you $1.

564
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:36,750
Speaker 0: the people who you think are listening just downloaded without listening is no automatic podcast download.

565
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,385
Speaker 1: We only have like 50 something patrons, but they're giving us like 250 bucks a month.

566
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,501
Speaker 0: What the hell is wrong with you people stop giving her money.

567
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:46,790
Speaker 1: all of you just gave us a dollar not pay.

568
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:47,917
Speaker 0: It'd be better for you.

569
00:34:47,937 --> 00:34:49,164
Speaker 0: No, do not.

570
00:34:49,406 --> 00:34:50,813
Speaker 0: zero dollars You should give.

571
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,630
Speaker 1: but guys you can hack patreon you almost dead.

572
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:59,006
Speaker 0: Vast majority of people listening to this have less money than me or rim for now.

573
00:34:59,086 --> 00:35:03,199
Speaker 0: Do not give us money Unless you have more money than both of us.

574
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:05,910
Speaker 0: in which case give us money until we are even with you.

575
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:07,539
Speaker 1: Well guys, there is a stretch goal.

576
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:12,690
Speaker 1: if you can muster up 24 grand a month We will we're not lying quit our jobs and do this full-time.

577
00:35:12,951 --> 00:35:15,178
Speaker 0: Well, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

578
00:35:15,398 --> 00:35:16,421
Speaker 0: new employer person.

579
00:35:16,442 --> 00:35:18,869
Speaker 1: I'll also eat my hat and probably pass out.

580
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:28,808
Speaker 0: Do not also if you are going to throw money away on The Powerball lottery give it to us instead.

581
00:35:28,908 --> 00:35:33,145
Speaker 0: Yes Do not think that you're taking money and you're setting it on fire.

582
00:35:33,486 --> 00:35:35,333
Speaker 0: if you give it to rim You're not setting on a fire.

583
00:35:35,353 --> 00:35:38,625
Speaker 0: You're only putting in the toilet, which is less bad than setting it on fire.

584
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:44,430
Speaker 1: But also, uh We you could give a dollar and then we'd hit the stretch goal.

585
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:46,429
Speaker 1: So we'd have to release all the episodes.

586
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:53,628
Speaker 1: You could just take the not give any more dollars just cancel it after the first month because the stretch goal is just the peak The high-water mark.

587
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:58,550
Speaker 0: So if you guys what if it hits the goal for like one second and then goes under then well at least for one month.

588
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,859
Speaker 1: If it hits it for one month, then I'm obligated.

589
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:01,963
Speaker 1: I got a re-release.

590
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:02,987
Speaker 0: the money has to come in.

591
00:36:03,068 --> 00:36:04,653
Speaker 0: Yeah once Once.

592
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:11,209
Speaker 0: so someone just changes their there, you know They're giving it's like a thousand and then immediately five minutes later brings it down to zero.

593
00:36:11,229 --> 00:36:12,378
Speaker 1: now I'm not gonna do it back.

594
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:13,749
Speaker 0: So you actually have to get the cash.

595
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if we get the cash even once then we which means me give your money to a real charity instead.

596
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:21,553
Speaker 0: some suggestions We'll see.

597
00:36:21,573 --> 00:36:22,779
Speaker 1: syringas patreon.

598
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:23,703
Speaker 1: You should give the money to.

599
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,050
Speaker 0: yeah, he needs money's more than we do.

600
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,194
Speaker 1: He makes more swell.

601
00:36:26,696 --> 00:36:27,338
Speaker 1: We've made more.

602
00:36:27,398 --> 00:36:29,085
Speaker 0: He's also more talented than we are.

603
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:30,530
Speaker 1: We've made more hours of content.

604
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:36,970
Speaker 0: He's one minute of quality of content one minute of neil Cesar Ega content is worth more than all the geek nights ever times a thousand.

605
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,281
Speaker 1: So he's not getting that much more money than us on patreon.

606
00:36:39,321 --> 00:36:40,105
Speaker 1: He really deserves it.

607
00:36:40,346 --> 00:36:41,230
Speaker 0: Oh, I should give him some money.

608
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:41,928
Speaker 0: I'm giving him money.

609
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:47,962
Speaker 0: The Here are the suggested charities official charities of geek nights already.

610
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,747
Speaker 0: comic book legal defense fund.

611
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:55,450
Speaker 0: Yeah Or said EFF, except I don't agree with them on privacy, but everything else is fine.

612
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:58,620
Speaker 0: The Creative Commons is a good one.

613
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,045
Speaker 0: All right, the ACLU is good.

614
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,289
Speaker 0: ACLU is okay.

615
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:04,762
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, they're good because at least they're pretty ideologically consistent.

616
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:06,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, doctors that borders always good.

617
00:37:06,709 --> 00:37:09,182
Speaker 1: Yeah You know what Planned Parenthood.

618
00:37:09,363 --> 00:37:10,328
Speaker 1: they could actually use the money.

619
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,499
Speaker 0: right now They just take donations straight up.

620
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,630
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure you can donate directly to Planned Parenthood.

621
00:37:14,731 --> 00:37:15,876
Speaker 0: Oh, I did not know that.

622
00:37:15,937 --> 00:37:19,136
Speaker 0: I thought it was not a. if you never thought of it as a charity That would be like.

623
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:23,561
Speaker 0: well, it shouldn't be a charity Sure, but I didn't realize that it was like you could do that.

624
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:24,445
Speaker 1: It needs money.

625
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:25,027
Speaker 0: Sure.

626
00:37:25,047 --> 00:37:25,369
Speaker 1: Why not?

627
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,713
Speaker 0: What are the other nerdy ones though?

628
00:37:27,834 --> 00:37:28,676
Speaker 0: archive org?

629
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Wikimedia Foundation.

630
00:37:31,102 --> 00:37:37,767
Speaker 1: Yeah trying to think of nerdy ones, you know, uh There's a few other patrons of people we know you could give money to.

631
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:38,330
Speaker 1: they make art.

632
00:37:38,712 --> 00:37:43,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure there might be one I'm missing or whatever cuz I didn't think of this until just now I'll crash course.

633
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:45,365
Speaker 1: you give money to any patreon give it to crash course.

634
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:46,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need that.

635
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,819
Speaker 1: They are the some of the that's some of the that one.

636
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,785
Speaker 1: They're the reason can a patreon exists?

637
00:37:51,588 --> 00:38:00,670
Speaker 1: and two That's probably one of the more noble causes because they actually just create educational stuff for free forever Independent of if you give them money kind of like gig nights.

638
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:04,429
Speaker 1: We'll keep doing gig nights even if you give no money to the patreon ever.

639
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,760
Speaker 1: So, yeah, Oh child's play child's play there you go.

640
00:38:09,021 --> 00:38:13,255
Speaker 1: or uh, you know games done quick because they just turn the lights That's the see.

641
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:14,721
Speaker 0: I'm not sure about the games done quick.

642
00:38:14,741 --> 00:38:16,670
Speaker 1: They turn that money right around in a cancer chair.

643
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:21,310
Speaker 0: Well, they give it to the prevent cancer Foundation, which I'm not sure is about cancer prevention.

644
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:25,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like awareness and those charities are usually is awareness.

645
00:38:25,427 --> 00:38:28,982
Speaker 0: It's not research I mean, I don't know but it's about preventing cancer.

646
00:38:29,002 --> 00:38:30,670
Speaker 0: They might do research to prevent cancer.

647
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:35,884
Speaker 1: It's always tough for those cancer charities because we're gonna talk about a dour topic.

648
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:38,330
Speaker 0: my summer games done quick does.

649
00:38:39,291 --> 00:38:40,595
Speaker 1: There was a big meta study.

650
00:38:40,656 --> 00:38:42,883
Speaker 1: I didn't read the fullness of it yet, but it's it's.

651
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:43,946
Speaker 1: it's one of those.

652
00:38:44,026 --> 00:38:46,765
Speaker 0: like that sucks They take all the studies and combine them.

653
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:59,902
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah The study basically said that the death rate like n years out from cancer has not decreased at all In 30-ish years despite prevention despite screening.

654
00:39:00,223 --> 00:39:06,730
Speaker 1: and it basically said that screening for cancer and Detecting it early has no outcome on the actual death rate across the population.

655
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:07,693
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm

656
00:39:07,893 --> 00:39:27,018
Speaker 1: that basically people who had like the few people who could be saved because they have the rare cancer That's actually that treatable and they catch it that early is mitigated by the people who get pre-screened and they aggressively treated cancer That either would have been deadly anyway, or wouldn't have been deadly But the treatment ended up being worse.

657
00:39:27,138 --> 00:39:29,044
Speaker 0: how often is treatment end up being worse?

658
00:39:29,084 --> 00:39:31,050
Speaker 0: you think that the oncologist editor should be able to?

659
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:35,670
Speaker 1: Well, what it comes down to is a lot of cancers aren't actually treatable in any meaningful way, right?

660
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,578
Speaker 0: So you just tell the person this isn't treatable.

661
00:39:37,658 --> 00:39:45,169
Speaker 1: deal with it, but the study's main point was that Vastly increased cancer screening has had zero impact on cancer deaths.

662
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:55,190
Speaker 1: hmm, and then the rest of it which I haven't finished reading talks a lot about the ramifications of that and Follow-up studies to determine, you know, why the answer is currently still zero.

663
00:39:56,713 --> 00:40:01,430
Speaker 0: What if you have the rare preventable one and you don't get screening because it doesn't affect the statistics?

664
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,650
Speaker 1: Apparently apparently all these people getting colonoscopies earlier has not significantly impacted the death rate of colon cancer.

665
00:40:07,951 --> 00:40:13,996
Speaker 1: Well, because if you get it, you're gonna die, you know, yeah, but what they're saying is that pre-screening It has not reduced the death rate.

666
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:16,386
Speaker 0: Well, cuz it's not one of those rare preventable ones.

667
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:20,017
Speaker 1: Yeah Theoretically can magically lips that would.

668
00:40:20,058 --> 00:40:23,070
Speaker 1: then you know, I mean, I'm gonna get my colonoscopy is when I'm 40.

669
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,350
Speaker 0: So does that mean cleaning, you know getting your polyp scraped out doesn't help you live longer.

670
00:40:28,034 --> 00:40:35,795
Speaker 0: All the questions you're asking I have not finished reading it yet Are you saying my just death rate cuz it could be like, okay, you still gonna do everyone the death rates a hundred percent Right.

671
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,710
Speaker 0: I gotta live ten years longer and then I died.

672
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:40,638
Speaker 1: I read there's another article to talk about.

673
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:49,527
Speaker 1: statistically the death rates not a hundred percent because so many people are alive today That there's a place like a ninety nine point nine nine eight percent chance that you'll actually die.

674
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:50,470
Speaker 1: based on the evidence.

675
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,479
Speaker 1: We have two dates.

676
00:40:51,842 --> 00:40:52,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

677
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:53,610
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway.

678
00:40:55,171 --> 00:41:00,813
Speaker 1: So to get onto a much the one of the few things we could talk about that's worse than cancer Nuclear weapon.

679
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,790
Speaker 1: This is rims favorite topic for some reason just lately because it's been in the news a lot.

680
00:41:04,851 --> 00:41:06,647
Speaker 1: So what's been bothering me?

681
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,117
Speaker 0: Chomsky rim over here rim Chomsky.

682
00:41:10,177 --> 00:41:11,742
Speaker 1: No, I'm sure he's one of my favorite people.

683
00:41:11,782 --> 00:41:14,550
Speaker 1: Okay, so they're gonna nuke us all.

684
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:26,730
Speaker 1: Basically, I know a lot about nukes partly because I had some high school teachers who like when we like when we learned about World War two I had a high school teacher like that, you know, like the sophomore year like well kids modern history coming

685
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:27,813
Speaker 0: He

686
00:41:27,914 --> 00:41:30,150
Speaker 1: we spent like a month talking about nuclear weapons.

687
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,566
Speaker 1: The dude just knew a lot about him and was real mad about him.

688
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:36,235
Speaker 1: and fun fact He actually was a big gnome Chomsky fan.

689
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,983
Speaker 1: Okay, and also a Lenin fan.

690
00:41:39,124 --> 00:41:40,347
Speaker 1: So your mileage may vary.

691
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:51,189
Speaker 1: Okay, and so recently North Korea, you know Detonated a nuclear test which is problematic for a lot of reasons I mean when I don't want to talk about politics at all.

692
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:57,448
Speaker 1: But the headline that CNN ran was North Korea detonates hydrogen bomb.

693
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:05,585
Speaker 1: unlikely Definitely didn't happen and I realized already that most of the people I talked to.

694
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:07,590
Speaker 0: if they did I'm gonna buy a lottery ticket.

695
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:19,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Very few nations in history have ever developed or detonated a quote hydrogen bomb Which is misnomer calling it a hydrogen bomb and it's nothing to do with hydrogen.

696
00:42:19,292 --> 00:42:21,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it's kind of like a bomb H of all that nonsense.

697
00:42:21,991 --> 00:42:22,675
Speaker 0: I mean people.

698
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:25,070
Speaker 0: they don't really teach you this in school, right?

699
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:31,581
Speaker 0: They teach you about like Japan and dropping, you know, the little boy the fat man What at right and you know, you think atomic bomb.

700
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:33,770
Speaker 0: and then you know about ICBMs.

701
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,690
Speaker 0: It's like a big rocket.

702
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:43,224
Speaker 0: They can go to the other side of the world and but people don't realize that the warhead they put on the ICBM is Not like the atomic bomb.

703
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:43,787
Speaker 1: It was in Japan.

704
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,390
Speaker 1: It's a completely different thing and in fact people talk about India and Pakistan being nuclear states.

705
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:52,739
Speaker 1: They have a gun type wet.

706
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:53,260
Speaker 0: They have.

707
00:42:53,441 --> 00:42:55,506
Speaker 0: they have the things that we dropped on Japan.

708
00:42:55,546 --> 00:43:03,810
Speaker 1: They have the thing that we dropped on Hiroshima at best right modified slightly to be a little more powerful.

709
00:43:04,092 --> 00:43:06,448
Speaker 0: We still have some of those because they're still useful.

710
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:06,670
Speaker 0: like.

711
00:43:07,674 --> 00:43:08,565
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

712
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:11,870
Speaker 0: no No, I thought that we use them in the tactical nukes and you want to blow up like a Navy.

713
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,430
Speaker 1: We don't you know, the gun type bombs are not used by anyone anymore.

714
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:15,950
Speaker 1: Okay

715
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:16,231
Speaker 0: at least

716
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:21,934
Speaker 1: as far as we can I mean as far as I can tell they might be used by that kind of Atomic artillery that

717
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:22,596
Speaker 0: even

718
00:43:22,636 --> 00:43:31,390
Speaker 1: we decided it was a bad idea because the Davy Crockett The human who launched it couldn't be outside of its blast radius and that was like a hundredth of a kiloton.

719
00:43:31,832 --> 00:43:34,829
Speaker 0: No, I thought we had them and like we'd like, you know the bombers and just drop them.

720
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,056
Speaker 1: I know bombers don't use gun type weapons.

721
00:43:37,578 --> 00:43:39,965
Speaker 1: Okay bombers don't use atomic bombs.

722
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:41,630
Speaker 1: They use thermonuclear weapons.

723
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:46,230
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that almost every weapon we don't have any more atomic bombs left atomic bombs.

724
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:51,270
Speaker 1: Oh, so this is where I want to explain things and then I'll let Scott ask questions.

725
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,855
Speaker 0: I'm the rims too nerdy about this.

726
00:43:52,996 --> 00:43:54,280
Speaker 0: He just wants to nuke everybody.

727
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,713
Speaker 1: what happened with North Korea was not a Thermonuclear device.

728
00:43:58,773 --> 00:44:05,290
Speaker 1: when people say h-bomb what they mean is a thermonuclear weapon, which is not what the Manhattan Project invented.

729
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:10,643
Speaker 1: Nope, specifically, they mean a two-stage Thermonuclear weapon or a teller ulam device.

730
00:44:11,125 --> 00:44:12,110
Speaker 0: So when was that invented?

731
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,925
Speaker 0: If not, if if the Manhattan Project 50s like who did that?

732
00:44:16,126 --> 00:44:19,782
Speaker 1: us the u.s Made pretty much all the progress in nuclear weapons.

733
00:44:19,903 --> 00:44:22,559
Speaker 0: Okay, but I mean who specifically Tell her an?

734
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,043
Speaker 1: ulam.

735
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,657
Speaker 0: Okay How can no one knows about them?

736
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:26,641
Speaker 0: they're not famous like.

737
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:28,930
Speaker 1: they're famous if you know about physics, right?

738
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,417
Speaker 0: But they're not famous like, you know Oppenheimer and fine Because people don't know things about nukes.

739
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:34,321
Speaker 1: you can see you get the fur.

740
00:44:34,341 --> 00:44:41,729
Speaker 1: the easiest way to know that someone doesn't know anything about nukes Is if they even say hydrogen bomb or h-bomb because those terms were invented by the press.

741
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:46,970
Speaker 1: But so what North Korea detonated was not a thermonuclear modern device.

742
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:52,969
Speaker 1: What it was is a variant of the weapon that we dropped on Nagasaki in World War two.

743
00:44:53,853 --> 00:45:01,610
Speaker 1: So those weapons the first nuclear weapons that were ever developed were criticality weapons Meaning you've got some like uranium right and you get a lot of uranium.

744
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:19,339
Speaker 1: Yep, if you get too much uranium too close to itself like in too small a space or plutonium either way Yeah, then they're giving off enough radiation enough neutrons and shit to start a self-sustaining Catastrophic react like what's in a nuclear power plant?

745
00:45:20,142 --> 00:45:21,748
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, so those are also critical.

746
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,581
Speaker 1: They're critical They're self-sustaining.

747
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:24,550
Speaker 1: They just keep going, right?

748
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:33,610
Speaker 0: So one radiation bat, you know shoots out of one molecule and hits another one and makes that one go crazy like You've got some uranium 235 and it's just popping neutrons out.

749
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:38,710
Speaker 1: Some of those neutrons hit more uranium and they do some stuff and they're like radiations coming out all over the place.

750
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:42,764
Speaker 1: This is baby's first like simple description 10th grade chemistry class.

751
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:49,464
Speaker 1: if you get a bunch of it together It'll start reacting which causes more reactions to happen.

752
00:45:49,564 --> 00:45:51,250
Speaker 0: exponential increasing reaction.

753
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:57,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you do that either by getting too much together or by surrounding it with something that's gonna reflect radiation.

754
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:58,884
Speaker 1: It's making back at itself.

755
00:45:59,227 --> 00:45:59,388
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

756
00:45:59,711 --> 00:46:03,467
Speaker 1: So there was a term for this in the old days of making nuclear weapons.

757
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:12,490
Speaker 1: during the Manhattan Project They called it tickling the dragon's tail because while they had Physics, you know people with pieces of paper said this is the amount.

758
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,824
Speaker 1: Someone had to test that shit and you know how dangerous that was.

759
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:17,130
Speaker 0: they tested it from real far away.

760
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:18,789
Speaker 1: No, a lot of fucking people died.

761
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:33,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's if you want to read a really depressing Wikipedia article read the article called the demon core because we had a core of Nuclear material that we called the demon core because it killed a lot of people in experimentation.

762
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:35,434
Speaker 0: One don't work there.

763
00:46:35,855 --> 00:46:49,077
Speaker 1: one dude had just two halves of this thing apart and he was holding him apart with a screwdriver And he was just fucking with it and he I guess sneezed and knocked their screwdriver out and it closed and flashed And he was dead.

764
00:46:49,398 --> 00:46:51,909
Speaker 1: he died of radiation poisoning days later like he was done.

765
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:55,984
Speaker 0: So if you get radiation poisoning like that, don't wait days.

766
00:46:56,004 --> 00:46:57,670
Speaker 0: It'll just be really bad and suffering.

767
00:46:58,433 --> 00:47:04,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, actually it'll be really bad and then it'll be really good and you'll feel great For like another couple days.

768
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:06,830
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you'll feel like no, how does that work?

769
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:08,073
Speaker 1: I don't want to.

770
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:09,860
Speaker 1: so that's just real depressing.

771
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,908
Speaker 1: But basically it fucks your body up.

772
00:47:12,652 --> 00:47:15,970
Speaker 1: So you feel bad, but then your body starts shutting down.

773
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:23,758
Speaker 1: So your immune response and all the things that are making you actually feel bad They turn off they turn off.

774
00:47:23,778 --> 00:47:25,908
Speaker 1: So you feel great and then you die.

775
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:30,750
Speaker 1: Well, you feel bad again and then you die, but we're not talking about we're just talking about nuclear bombs.

776
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,950
Speaker 1: I want to keep this real constraint.

777
00:47:33,031 --> 00:47:43,989
Speaker 1: so the early like the first weapons we made were literally you just have a ring of uranium and I'm not like a rod of uranium and you would shoot the ring at the rod like a gun.

778
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:47,542
Speaker 1: They'd overlap and that would be too much critical mass.

779
00:47:47,803 --> 00:47:49,870
Speaker 1: So they would have a catastrophic reaction and explode.

780
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:59,610
Speaker 1: but The reactions happen so fast like on the order of nanoseconds That the reaction would start when only a little bit of it was overlapping.

781
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:02,178
Speaker 1: So you'd only get a pretty minimal yield.

782
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:08,958
Speaker 1: you get the reaction going but then the explosion of the reaction Would break the materially apart and the reaction would stop.

783
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:13,110
Speaker 1: and most of that uranium just was dust and plasma and shit.

784
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:18,870
Speaker 0: You need some way to like hold the explosion in until it's even crazier and then let it go and you want yep.

785
00:48:19,232 --> 00:48:25,935
Speaker 1: so we made those kinds of bombs if you're evil and We dropped it on her own Hiroshima we.

786
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:30,374
Speaker 1: this design is so simple that we didn't even test it Like we.

787
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:31,381
Speaker 1: just we just dropped it.

788
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:32,388
Speaker 0: We just assumed it would work.

789
00:48:33,594 --> 00:48:34,278
Speaker 0: I mean, it doesn't.

790
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,590
Speaker 0: it doesn't explode when it hits something.

791
00:48:37,072 --> 00:48:39,262
Speaker 1: So what loads when the gun goes off in the bomb?

792
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:39,824
Speaker 0: So how does?

793
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:41,110
Speaker 0: is it like a timer or something?

794
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:42,318
Speaker 1: I actually don't know.

795
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:43,284
Speaker 1: I don't know the details.

796
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:44,150
Speaker 0: There's a remote control.

797
00:48:44,972 --> 00:48:50,970
Speaker 0: I actually do not know much about the like because I can you know You watch Looney Tunes and they're always like hitting bombs with hammers.

798
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:57,290
Speaker 1: So it doesn't work like that our through more thermonuclear devices like the ones that are actually crazy dangerous.

799
00:48:57,933 --> 00:49:04,323
Speaker 1: A lot of them would have gone off if we drop them like for real Mm-hmm, like we are wet they work by get.

800
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:05,730
Speaker 0: if I hit one with a hammer it would go on.

801
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:08,926
Speaker 1: Oh, they were just fucking like poorly designed and not safe.

802
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:12,590
Speaker 1: Oh great We designed the weapons first and the safety came way later.

803
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:15,330
Speaker 1: Do you know how we made the first two bombs that we actually dropped safe?

804
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:18,778
Speaker 1: the nuclear payload was just separate like in a box.

805
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:23,934
Speaker 1: the plane took off and then a dude in the plane crawled down there and Activated it.

806
00:49:24,476 --> 00:49:25,199
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

807
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:27,187
Speaker 1: So if they dropped it, it might have just gone off.

808
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,030
Speaker 1: It was some crazy crap.

809
00:49:28,573 --> 00:49:38,070
Speaker 1: in fact, the gun bombs were so reliable that Those are the weapons that most countries developed that weren't in the current nuclear powers.

810
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:42,709
Speaker 1: So like South Africa with their nuclear weapons, they had a bunch of bombs like that.

811
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:47,149
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Israel has bombs and a lot of their bombs are also like that at the time.

812
00:49:48,032 --> 00:49:52,708
Speaker 1: so the implosion bombs that we dropped in Nagasaki were much more advanced.

813
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,366
Speaker 1: and So like the engineering challenge is night and day.

814
00:49:56,386 --> 00:50:06,582
Speaker 1: instead You have a ring of high explosives tons and tons of high explosives and then they're shaped and there's Lensing like regular explosives like TNT.

815
00:50:06,743 --> 00:50:11,441
Speaker 1: Yes, just like TNT stuff like that I think it was actually like the sort of primer cord like RDX before.

816
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:14,230
Speaker 1: no, it was more like RDX.

817
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:16,583
Speaker 1: I think again, I'm not too.

818
00:50:16,624 --> 00:50:23,630
Speaker 1: conventional bombs Yes conventional bombs tons of that shit, but you'd array it with like fast and slow propellants in different shapes.

819
00:50:23,991 --> 00:50:24,873
Speaker 1: So you have this lens.

820
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:40,129
Speaker 1: so the explosion would happen with such precision that the core which was just a hollow sphere of like plutonium would be crushed Instantaneously from all directions at once and that would cause the reaction and it was significantly more powerful.

821
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:47,088
Speaker 1: Mmm, what North Korea just did is one of two possible things because the yield was too low.

822
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:55,301
Speaker 1: real thermonuclear devices have kind of a minimum yield like So high that there's no way.

823
00:50:55,402 --> 00:50:57,630
Speaker 1: what they did was actually a thermonuclear device.

824
00:50:58,051 --> 00:51:13,470
Speaker 1: So either they did something called boosted fission where you have a regular old Hiroshima style bomb but in that empty core you fill it with something like lithium and Basically, it'll compress in and do the normal atomic bomb thing.

825
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:16,799
Speaker 1: But that middle part will fuse from the pressure.

826
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,487
Speaker 1: that fusion reaction will make a ton of neutrons.

827
00:51:19,748 --> 00:51:22,697
Speaker 1: that then just do Crazy more fission.

828
00:51:23,158 --> 00:51:26,930
Speaker 0: So it's still mostly a little bit the lithiums who are in the middle of the explosion.

829
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:28,930
Speaker 0: They fuse together and make who knows what?

830
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:36,598
Speaker 1: fusion fission Like boom all at once and the yield of that Could be like ten to a hundred times more.

831
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:39,970
Speaker 1: like you could make a bomb like that and get up to almost a megaton.

832
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:41,389
Speaker 1: If you really tried.

833
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:42,693
Speaker 0: That's just.

834
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:44,301
Speaker 0: that's really yeah.

835
00:51:44,342 --> 00:51:45,950
Speaker 0: So a megaton that sounds great.

836
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:47,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, so to give you a one.

837
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:50,369
Speaker 1: so to give you a reference because I tweeted about this a while ago.

838
00:51:51,851 --> 00:52:01,369
Speaker 1: The weapons that the United States used in World War two were ten to twenty kiloton meaning 10,000 tons of TNT equivalent explosion.

839
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:13,549
Speaker 1: the biggest nuclear weapons ever designed were on the order of 50 to 100 megatons a hundred million tons of TNT.

840
00:52:13,569 --> 00:52:21,531
Speaker 1: a Fusion boosted bomb could be ten to a hundred times more than the weapons that were the weapons that were actually used in the real World.

841
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:25,610
Speaker 1: so that is the best case for North Korea of what they developed.

842
00:52:25,871 --> 00:52:35,628
Speaker 1: They figured out how to make the the output of their regular crappy old-school atomic bombs be where they even get any radioactive stuff from.

843
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:37,938
Speaker 1: That's an interesting question.

844
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:38,963
Speaker 0: I mean is it is it?

845
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:40,370
Speaker 0: can they mine it in North Korea?

846
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,575
Speaker 1: That I actually don't know.

847
00:52:42,595 --> 00:52:44,020
Speaker 0: can they refine it in North Korea?

848
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,469
Speaker 1: Apparently they did or someone gave it to them.

849
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:49,215
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

850
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:51,702
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of a secretive state.

851
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:54,030
Speaker 1: China sort of just tells everyone to stay away.

852
00:52:54,312 --> 00:52:55,261
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like that's.

853
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,149
Speaker 0: it's hard to get.

854
00:52:57,096 --> 00:53:03,990
Speaker 1: In fact, one of the reasons that the u.s Had so many atomic weapons after World War two is that we had uranium in our country.

855
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:10,050
Speaker 1: We could just dig it up and Russia for a long time had no known source of uranium.

856
00:53:10,351 --> 00:53:11,115
Speaker 1: They found Russia.

857
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:11,738
Speaker 0: They found some.

858
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:12,743
Speaker 1: they found some later.

859
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:16,550
Speaker 1: There's a lot of Russia to find it Yeah, but early on they didn't have it sure.

860
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:18,496
Speaker 1: So and the difference.

861
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:23,110
Speaker 1: so the other thing that North Korea could have done is doing that civilization, right?

862
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,004
Speaker 0: It's like I got horses you don't.

863
00:53:25,527 --> 00:53:27,255
Speaker 0: so the other Horses.

864
00:53:27,315 --> 00:53:33,871
Speaker 1: because one thing that they might have done it might have been a boosted fission weapon Which was what the u.s Made.

865
00:53:33,971 --> 00:53:39,790
Speaker 1: we made a huge stockpile of those things in the Cold War ready to just lob with conventional bombers.

866
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:44,184
Speaker 1: the other thing they might have done is they might have made a sloica style device.

867
00:53:44,485 --> 00:53:47,590
Speaker 1: sloica is like a. it's a pastry cake in Russia.

868
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:53,850
Speaker 1: It's like a layer cake and a sloica device is layers and layers of like that fission fission fission fission fission.

869
00:53:54,091 --> 00:54:00,510
Speaker 1: So it's more like an advanced version of a boosted fission weapon and those things are a dead end.

870
00:54:00,611 --> 00:54:02,170
Speaker 1: We learned from physics later.

871
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:06,867
Speaker 1: Like that theory Peters out at about a megaton and isn't really viable as a weapon.

872
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:10,443
Speaker 0: like they're okay But a megaton bomb isn't viable as a weapon.

873
00:54:10,463 --> 00:54:11,770
Speaker 0: if I drop that on you, you'll be fine.

874
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:16,850
Speaker 1: Well, it's a megaton, but it's also kind of big and unwieldy and there's problems with that sort of design.

875
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,564
Speaker 0: I'll put in my giant plane and drop it on you.

876
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:19,290
Speaker 0: what you do about it.

877
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:22,309
Speaker 1: So North Korea has either one of those two things.

878
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:26,763
Speaker 1: The ramifications however are not what a lot of people are like.

879
00:54:26,884 --> 00:54:28,870
Speaker 1: Oh now they can make real nuclear weapons.

880
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,458
Speaker 1: Not really the ramifications are still bad though.

881
00:54:31,478 --> 00:54:38,550
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong if they made a boosted fission weapon the former type That doesn't mean they're gonna be making like more powerful weapons.

882
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:45,697
Speaker 1: That means they can take their existing style weapons and put them on missiles Which they their enemy.

883
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:48,105
Speaker 0: their enemy is not far away, that's the real.

884
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:49,570
Speaker 0: see if their enemy was us.

885
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:51,323
Speaker 0: We don't really have much to worry about.

886
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:53,073
Speaker 0: no matter what they have Yeah There's.

887
00:54:53,093 --> 00:54:59,870
Speaker 0: no matter how much atomic technology they have they don't have Something that can fly halfway around the world and land in New York.

888
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:07,210
Speaker 1: Best weapon they have the best missile at least could theoretically hit the west coast at its extreme range, right and accurately.

889
00:55:07,592 --> 00:55:12,796
Speaker 0: No, it would probably land in like the forest or on some hippies, dude Accurately the.

890
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:19,021
Speaker 1: there's a. there's a term called the CEP 50 Circular error probable which is the percentage.

891
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:20,665
Speaker 1: basically it's the radius.

892
00:55:21,448 --> 00:55:26,150
Speaker 1: if you launch a nuke Where there is a 50/50 shot it'll land within that radius.

893
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:27,594
Speaker 1: Think about that.

894
00:55:27,694 --> 00:55:30,020
Speaker 1: So some CEPs were in the miles.

895
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:34,010
Speaker 1: So here's a circle of like five miles in diameter.

896
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,553
Speaker 1: There's a 50/50.

897
00:55:34,553 --> 00:55:35,197
Speaker 1: There's a 50% chance.

898
00:55:35,298 --> 00:55:39,620
Speaker 1: It'll land Somewhere in that area.

899
00:55:39,701 --> 00:55:41,830
Speaker 0: So from here to work is about five miles.

900
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,460
Speaker 0: So 50/50 it'll land between here and work or somewhere else.

901
00:55:45,941 --> 00:55:51,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, so somewhere else bomb the wrong place, Vermont That's part of the horror of nuclear weapons.

902
00:55:51,770 --> 00:56:00,030
Speaker 1: The the things that we had after World War two were not only terrifying in their power But they were inaccurate as shit, right?

903
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,984
Speaker 0: So now we just send them into space and they land in exactly the right spot.

904
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:15,440
Speaker 1: So North Korea might have Developed boosted fission weapons meaning they could take nuclear weapons that they can already make today and Deliver them somewhere nearby like Japan or South Korea.

905
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:17,547
Speaker 1: That's not anything to sneeze at.

906
00:56:18,048 --> 00:56:25,469
Speaker 1: the other thing They could have done is developed a sloica style device meaning they could make a megaton weapon, but probably couldn't deliver it anywhere.

907
00:56:26,452 --> 00:56:31,546
Speaker 1: Neither one of these while they have sociopolitical ramifications is a modern nuclear weapon.

908
00:56:32,207 --> 00:56:36,424
Speaker 0: the engineering Challenge and by modern you mean how old yeah, so the 50s.

909
00:56:36,444 --> 00:56:43,430
Speaker 0: Yeah Okay, so there has development since then are probably a non-existent or be secret.

910
00:56:43,931 --> 00:56:46,961
Speaker 1: Oh the teller ulam design is secret.

911
00:56:47,001 --> 00:56:59,300
Speaker 1: like you can go look up Scott you and I together Anyone who knows even basic physics and engineering could make a gun type uranium nuclear weapon if they had if we had uranium Which we don't if you had the materials.

912
00:56:59,622 --> 00:57:03,269
Speaker 0: the engineering challenge You can't get it at the chemistry lab because they don't have enough.

913
00:57:04,092 --> 00:57:08,930
Speaker 1: The implosion type weapons the engineering challenge is a like an order of magnitude more.

914
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:12,129
Speaker 1: It's very difficult to make that lensing and they're huge.

915
00:57:13,073 --> 00:57:19,816
Speaker 1: The fission boosted weapons or the fusion boosted fission weapons boosted fission Sloica all those things.

916
00:57:20,459 --> 00:57:37,680
Speaker 1: the engineering challenge is substantial but I cannot express to you the gulf in Engineering challenge between even the most advanced like a weapon that could ever be conceived and a modern thermonuclear device The fact that only five countries in the world.

917
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,322
Speaker 1: arguably four have ever developed that technology And some of them were just gifted.

918
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:43,410
Speaker 0: they didn't figure it out on their own.

919
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:48,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the Soviets were kind of on the right track, but there was a lot of espionage going on.

920
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:51,620
Speaker 1: We shared a lot of secrets with Britain France.

921
00:57:51,661 --> 00:57:54,350
Speaker 1: There was a lot of sharing going on and apparently a lot of espionage.

922
00:57:55,211 --> 00:57:58,344
Speaker 1: This stuff is not easy to develop like people talk about India and Pakistan.

923
00:57:58,384 --> 00:57:58,565
Speaker 1: Nope.

924
00:57:58,967 --> 00:57:59,830
Speaker 1: They don't have those weapons.

925
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:01,381
Speaker 1: They do not have thermonuclear weapons.

926
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:02,590
Speaker 0: I think about calculus, right?

927
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:14,066
Speaker 0: There's always some story about someone who lives in the sticks somewhere who never took math class who figures out calculus on their own And has just different terms for everything and different symbols or who knows what but it is calculus.

928
00:58:14,106 --> 00:58:28,566
Speaker 0: They figured out independently Pretty much only once in the history of the entire world Despite half a century of trying plus Only one people's ever were able to figure out as far as we know how to make this thing.

929
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:39,244
Speaker 1: Maybe two and it took a huge percentage of the GDP of the most powerful and economically viable country in the world decades to design that.

930
00:58:39,566 --> 00:58:50,988
Speaker 1: it also required Constant testing by blowing up nukes Mm-hmm, so because we have the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and because no one's allowed to test new.

931
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:56,629
Speaker 0: and if you Even if you wanted to test nukes and you didn't care about the treaty everyone else will know immediately.

932
00:58:56,649 --> 00:58:59,358
Speaker 0: Yes I mean the whole unless you just keep failing.

933
00:58:59,558 --> 00:59:03,330
Speaker 1: the world knew within which case keep going that North Korea tried this bullshit.

934
00:59:03,691 --> 00:59:14,813
Speaker 0: And we knew within hours that either they develop you can't do it secret Even if you did at the core of the earth or in space everyone can see or find you with their Richter scale Seismograph, whatever.

935
00:59:14,833 --> 00:59:20,090
Speaker 1: It is such a secret that actually no one knows for real how to make them Like.

936
00:59:20,131 --> 00:59:21,215
Speaker 1: we know the theory you can look up.

937
00:59:21,255 --> 00:59:33,319
Speaker 1: you'll see these diagrams like everyone see the diagrams of what a modern nuke looks like But the actual engineering even if I had a whole pile of plutonium in the closet and I was totally Radiation-proof like Superman or something.

938
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:35,630
Speaker 0: I still couldn't do it, right?

939
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,130
Speaker 0: I couldn't get it to blow up that way because it's that hard to figure out how to make that happen.

940
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:49,504
Speaker 1: And that is a good thing because the true horror of thermonuclear weapons and I can't do trial and error because everyone will see me Trying is that their yield is literally unlimited.

941
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:53,941
Speaker 1: There is nothing Limiting the power of a nuclear weapon.

942
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:55,989
Speaker 0: You can make one that just blows up the solar system like boop.

943
00:59:56,212 --> 01:00:06,182
Speaker 1: Yeah Modern nuclear weapons where there's a term dial a yield or a variable yield where you just pick what yield you want from the weapon And it has an upper limit because it does have a lower limit.

944
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:08,070
Speaker 0: Can I be like I'd just be like one ton?

945
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,300
Speaker 1: So that's where things get kind of complicated.

946
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:12,610
Speaker 1: So this is where I want to ask you questions Scott.

947
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,097
Speaker 1: Have you ever heard of a neutron bomb?

948
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:16,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, what do you think a neutron bomb is?

949
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:17,231
Speaker 0: I don't.

950
01:00:17,291 --> 01:00:21,533
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that this is complete bullshit because it's just sort of that, you know I don't follow you.

951
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:24,563
Speaker 0: It's one of those stories that people tell that's complete bullshit.

952
01:00:24,603 --> 01:00:26,630
Speaker 0: Like hey, there's a secret in more.

953
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:29,855
Speaker 0: You know Mario you can go to this right up and down 65,535 times right exactly.

954
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:36,210
Speaker 0: So the story the kids tell about the neutron bomb in school, right?

955
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:42,190
Speaker 0: Cuz like I'm not as morbid as rim where I actually want to research such horrible things other than make them no longer exist.

956
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:52,050
Speaker 0: the story kids tell about the neutron bomb is that it goes off and Shit doesn't blow up like all the buildings in the in everywhere will just be perfectly intact.

957
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:56,844
Speaker 0: It doesn't blow up everything but it shoots neutrons everywhere really fast and it kills everybody.

958
01:00:56,864 --> 01:00:59,070
Speaker 0: and but it doesn't destroy anything.

959
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:00,938
Speaker 1: So they're not actually a special bomb.

960
01:01:01,078 --> 01:01:03,750
Speaker 0: all it is sort of like cosmic rays hitting your computer, right?

961
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:06,749
Speaker 0: You don't see them hitting your computer, but they still flip a bit.

962
01:01:07,111 --> 01:01:11,350
Speaker 0: You know the neutrons would come and like destroy your body because your body is and kill yourself.

963
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:13,221
Speaker 0: So but it wouldn't kill.

964
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,590
Speaker 0: a building is just concrete.

965
01:01:14,831 --> 01:01:20,210
Speaker 1: So actually the effective radius of the neutrons is about the same as the explosion radius.

966
01:01:20,692 --> 01:01:23,967
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only reason neutron bombs existed was to take out tanks.

967
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:28,384
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Because if you blow them up, it'll kill all the unprotected people because the explosion.

968
01:01:28,705 --> 01:01:29,930
Speaker 1: but the people in the tanks would be fine.

969
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:39,903
Speaker 1: The neutrons make the tanks so radioactive that the tanks then kill everyone inside the tanks immediately From the from the nuclear radiation, but it's true that it doesn't blow everything up.

970
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,830
Speaker 1: No, it blows everything up within its radius.

971
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:44,949
Speaker 1: It's just the radius isn't that big but it's not a special bomb.

972
01:01:45,331 --> 01:01:49,145
Speaker 1: Neutron bombs are just thermonuclear weapons with the yield dialed all the way down.

973
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:55,229
Speaker 1: Uh-huh So actually dialing the yield down makes them more horrifying in a different way.

974
01:01:55,993 --> 01:02:00,313
Speaker 0: So you couldn't dial the yield down say to make really efficient say Useful.

975
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:05,910
Speaker 0: in modern-day construction bombs like I want to make a big tunnel under the river to put a train through.

976
01:02:06,211 --> 01:02:10,990
Speaker 0: Let me use this in a practical and non evil mechanism by turning the yield down.

977
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:11,829
Speaker 0: So it just makes a ton.

978
01:02:12,011 --> 01:02:17,496
Speaker 1: Oh, you have to have the high after the yield pretty high up but with a thermonuclear device There's a sweet spot where.

979
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:27,650
Speaker 1: so you have the nuclear weapon that goes off and has its yield of like a megaton or ten Megatons or whatever, but like Tsar Bomba is an example because that's the most horrific thing humans ever made.

980
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:28,874
Speaker 1: That was a fifth.

981
01:02:28,894 --> 01:02:30,700
Speaker 1: Well, that was a hundred megaton weapon.

982
01:02:31,121 --> 01:02:33,570
Speaker 1: The Soviets detonated it at half power.

983
01:02:33,913 --> 01:02:36,957
Speaker 1: They dialed the yield of 50% Mm-hmm, and the.

984
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:51,436
Speaker 1: the results of that test were catastrophic, but The difference between the 50 and the hundred megaton version is that the 50 megaton version you have a nuclear device and it's wrapped in Inert material like lead.

985
01:02:51,456 --> 01:02:52,701
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

986
01:02:52,721 --> 01:02:54,810
Speaker 0: So a lot doesn't let radiation get out.

987
01:02:55,010 --> 01:02:56,555
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's more that it.

988
01:02:56,575 --> 01:02:57,538
Speaker 1: that's just to hold it together.

989
01:02:57,558 --> 01:02:57,979
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

990
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:08,390
Speaker 1: So a lot of the actual explosion is fusion Which means that the energy yield is primarily from that and not that much fallout is generated.

991
01:03:08,993 --> 01:03:11,485
Speaker 0: Well, that's good at least better than you know, I mean you still.

992
01:03:11,927 --> 01:03:12,510
Speaker 0: it's still horrible.

993
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:23,410
Speaker 1: so if you were doing peaceful nuclear weapons like excavation or whatever theoretically to use that kind of weapon because the Actual fallout is relatively low like reasonably acceptable for some use cases.

994
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:42,882
Speaker 1: However to make an efficient weapon if you replace that lead with say uranium Then the 50 megatons goes off and that causes all that uranium to do fission and you double your yield with a minimal increase in weight and The radiation is uranium really heavy though.

995
01:03:42,962 --> 01:03:43,867
Speaker 0: I guess lead is heavy.

996
01:03:43,947 --> 01:03:47,883
Speaker 1: Uranium is open From from that kind of weapon is horrific.

997
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:49,489
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's all horrific.

998
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:55,510
Speaker 0: Yeah Even more horrific than regular horrific on the scale of nuclear weapons.

999
01:03:55,972 --> 01:04:00,510
Speaker 1: But I guess my only last question for you Scott is how do you think a thermonuclear device works?

1000
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:01,716
Speaker 1: No one seen diagrams.

1001
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:02,561
Speaker 0: Nobody knows.

1002
01:04:02,581 --> 01:04:03,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one knows.

1003
01:04:03,930 --> 01:04:06,670
Speaker 0: There's some isn't there like some mysterious code name like fog bank?

1004
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:11,490
Speaker 1: No, thanks is something probably an aerogel of some kind that's used to hold everything together an arrow.

1005
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:15,386
Speaker 0: You know about aerogels, yeah, but why an aerogel is gonna hold in that?

1006
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:16,712
Speaker 1: no So the area.

1007
01:04:16,932 --> 01:04:20,184
Speaker 1: so the best theory we've got and this is why it's such a challenge.

1008
01:04:20,224 --> 01:04:21,147
Speaker 1: This is the best we know.

1009
01:04:21,267 --> 01:04:25,261
Speaker 1: basically a Boosted fission bomb goes off first.

1010
01:04:25,522 --> 01:04:27,110
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but that's just a little baby bomb.

1011
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:31,770
Speaker 1: It's not the explosion or anything else that causes the fusion reaction.

1012
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:35,069
Speaker 1: that bomb generates x-rays.

1013
01:04:35,854 --> 01:04:37,402
Speaker 1: So many x-rays.

1014
01:04:37,744 --> 01:04:44,610
Speaker 1: the x-rays are Channeled via basically a big lens and a containment system into the second stage of the weapon.

1015
01:04:44,873 --> 01:04:47,353
Speaker 1: You can have any number of stages They're just fusion all the way down.

1016
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:58,990
Speaker 1: the x-rays themselves are so much that they compress the secondary Mm-hmm, so light photons are compressing the secondary.

1017
01:04:59,010 --> 01:05:01,405
Speaker 0: So the dialing is adjusting the how much x-rays.

1018
01:05:01,767 --> 01:05:03,416
Speaker 1: maybe It's not it's.

1019
01:05:03,677 --> 01:05:05,567
Speaker 1: that's where we don't know a lot about that's.

1020
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:06,230
Speaker 0: that's the trick.

1021
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:08,910
Speaker 0: Is that you know, it's not just something that you set off, right?

1022
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:09,535
Speaker 0: There's a way.

1023
01:05:09,596 --> 01:05:11,009
Speaker 0: we know that there's a way to dial it.

1024
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:14,905
Speaker 0: So there's something that you can adjust how much at some point.

1025
01:05:14,986 --> 01:05:15,769
Speaker 1: so think of it this way.

1026
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,750
Speaker 1: What do you think the engineering challenge is of all the timing?

1027
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:27,210
Speaker 1: Necessary to have a burst of x-rays such that they physically compress something to the point that it fuses, right?

1028
01:05:27,210 --> 01:05:29,770
Speaker 0: Because you can make a bunch of x-rays, but you don't make them all at once.

1029
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,458
Speaker 0: They don't get to the destination all at once.

1030
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,170
Speaker 1: it ain't gonna happen and it's not a physics problem.

1031
01:05:34,271 --> 01:05:37,249
Speaker 1: A lot of people can come up with a lot of ideas as to how that would work.

1032
01:05:37,792 --> 01:05:40,950
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean you could think you mean like you could just make a Sun right?

1033
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,057
Speaker 0: It's like we know how the Sun works.

1034
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:43,930
Speaker 0: We know the chemistry of how the Sun works.

1035
01:05:43,930 --> 01:05:47,350
Speaker 0: It's like well get us, you know, I can write down on paper.

1036
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:51,489
Speaker 0: Well, it's helium fuses together and then it makes you know, you get enough of it and you're good.

1037
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:56,350
Speaker 0: But how do you actually make that happen in a space?

1038
01:05:56,892 --> 01:05:59,504
Speaker 0: You have I give you tanks of helium as much as you want.

1039
01:05:59,685 --> 01:06:00,830
Speaker 0: You have your own space lab.

1040
01:06:01,112 --> 01:06:02,021
Speaker 0: It's in outer space.

1041
01:06:02,223 --> 01:06:09,030
Speaker 0: you can have any Elements for the periodic table that you want in any quantity and you won't die and you can have any machine you want.

1042
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:10,999
Speaker 0: How are you gonna make a star?

1043
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:12,727
Speaker 0: you get to make a nebula first, right?

1044
01:06:12,747 --> 01:06:14,781
Speaker 0: It takes too long It's not gonna work.

1045
01:06:14,962 --> 01:06:28,424
Speaker 1: the engineering channel the the engineering to make a thermonuclear device from what North Korea did a few days ago would be like Your your warrior in Civ 5 Trying to make the spaceships.

1046
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:34,085
Speaker 0: at the end of the game It'd be like, you know, if at home you just started making i7s in your closet.

1047
01:06:34,205 --> 01:06:35,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you can't do.

1048
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:43,634
Speaker 1: actually It'd be easier to make It would be easier for a country like North Korea to make a chip as fast as the i7 that it would be for them To engineer.

1049
01:06:43,714 --> 01:06:46,807
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying you in your closet making an i7.

1050
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:53,441
Speaker 0: It's like yeah You couldn't you know, even if I gave you the plans for it It's like and I gave you silicon you couldn't.

1051
01:06:53,923 --> 01:06:55,530
Speaker 0: you couldn't print on that silicon.

1052
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:56,254
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

1053
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:59,329
Speaker 0: get a laser and start drawing on it and you're not clean room?

1054
01:07:00,371 --> 01:07:01,836
Speaker 0: So I got nothing to end this.

1055
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:11,937
Speaker 1: on a kind of a positive note two atomic weapons were used in human history And we're not gonna debate about by luck And many near misses.

1056
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,667
Speaker 0: we have thankfully not used any since.

1057
01:07:14,888 --> 01:07:17,575
Speaker 1: but yeah Except for testing.

1058
01:07:18,116 --> 01:07:18,938
Speaker 0: For on people.

1059
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:27,900
Speaker 1: The power of those weapons pales so powerfully small Before the power of actual thermonuclear devices.

1060
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:31,370
Speaker 0: and the fact that and people don't really realize that that's you know.

1061
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,030
Speaker 0: They just think atomic bomb and they think of Japan and that's all they think about.

1062
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,905
Speaker 0: they don't realize that this much more horrific bomb has been made and is the only thing that we have and

1063
01:07:38,925 --> 01:07:55,219
Speaker 1: the fact that in the So many generations of humans decades and decades and decades and decades, I mean from the 50s until We have no human has ever used one of these weapons Says I hope it says a lot about us.

1064
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:56,465
Speaker 0: Well used them on people.

1065
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:58,990
Speaker 1: Uh, well, yeah Well, we used them on people by accident.

1066
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:09,750
Speaker 1: We used them on trees and rocks a lot and water because the US military after World War two Basically treated those weapons just like a natural extension of bomber technology.

1067
01:08:10,231 --> 01:08:17,270
Speaker 1: It wasn't until Castle Bravo when they developed an eight megaton weapon that was accidentally 15 megatons.

1068
01:08:17,792 --> 01:08:24,608
Speaker 1: That was when the general started saying whoa Maybe we go too far You and play gods?

1069
01:08:25,951 --> 01:08:31,749
Speaker 1: yeah, like that was when they started treating them like something fundamentally unique.

1070
01:08:31,769 --> 01:08:44,332
Speaker 1: and It's also a testament that humans have never been able to develop these again And that somehow despite the fact that Russia the US China If playing gods was easy we wouldn't be here.

1071
01:08:44,474 --> 01:08:46,582
Speaker 1: five countries in the world have developed this technology.

1072
01:08:47,023 --> 01:08:53,166
Speaker 1: two of them hate each other and most of the rest of us at least in terms of geopolitics at different stages through history.

1073
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:56,176
Speaker 1: and yet No one's ever shared the secret.

1074
01:08:56,599 --> 01:09:13,200
Speaker 1: No one else has ever figured out the secret and no one's ever used This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:35,734
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows.

1081
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,180
Speaker 0: It's actually recorded at night.

1082

01:10:33,781 --> 01:10:38,860
Speaker 1: We finished shooting of episodes 14 and 15 of geek nights presents utenna on Sunday.

1087
01:10:39,322 --> 01:10:50,720
Speaker 1: So I'm actually in the middle of editing now and I'm gonna try to get at least one of those fully together with the new process and everything Before I go away for a long ski trip at the beginning of February.

1088
01:10:51,322 --> 01:10:57,400
Speaker 1: So I'll keep this one short because we just also recorded the December Q&A which will be out this week.

1089
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:20,280
Speaker 1: There's a little bit of trouble and I lost Scott's audio for the first half of it but I had the backup running but the backup was not calibrated great because I rarely have to go to the backup and I Realized that our process has post hoc post record Compression so I don't have compression in line on the pre-record like I did with the old rig.

1090
01:11:20,724 --> 01:11:27,316
Speaker 1: So as a result Scott's voice clips a bit But that gets cleared up about halfway through because I only lost the first half of Scott's audio.

1091
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:28,539
Speaker 1: So it's all in there.

1092
01:11:29,444 --> 01:11:38,946
Speaker 1: All patrons will get the geek nights December 2015 Q&A Very soon and I will now open up the question submission for geek nights 2016 patreon Q&A.

1093
01:11:39,568 --> 01:12:04,039
Speaker 1: and now I leave you with something really really A nine-tailed fox suddenly appeared if you believe it My ninja clan ninja clan.

1094
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:06,245
Speaker 0: here we stand Naruto.

1095
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:08,050
Speaker 1: I'm on my way Naruto.

1096
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:11,421
Speaker 1: I'll be okay getting ready to fight on set.

1097
01:12:11,702 --> 01:12:13,428
Speaker 0: Come on best friends by my side.

1098
01:12:13,468 --> 01:12:14,090
Speaker 1: That's okay.

1099
01:12:14,533 --> 01:12:21,595
Speaker 0: He's really cool Sakura the beautiful Oh.
