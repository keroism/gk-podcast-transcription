1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,449
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday July 3rd.

2
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,472
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:18,599
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights Tonight we talk about power grid.

4
00:00:24,363 --> 00:00:25,377
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,423 --> 00:00:35,564
Speaker 0: so yesterday I was debating whether to upgrade my computer or buy a new one and I decided to upgrade.

6
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:42,759
Speaker 0: so I ordered some RAM and a hard drive and from new egg and I paid for the normal four dollar UPS shipping four dollars.

7
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:46,731
Speaker 0: Hard drive showed up today ordered it yesterday today today.

8
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:47,915
Speaker 0: It was there when I got home.

9
00:00:48,777 --> 00:00:49,620
Speaker 0: the RAM will be here.

10
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:53,360
Speaker 0: I don't know if it'll be here tomorrow cuz I don't know if UPS works on Independence Day.

11
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,179
Speaker 0: They may or may not but if not, it'll be here Thursday.

12
00:00:57,667 --> 00:01:05,700
Speaker 1: damn That's all I got to say, you know I've never in my life paid for expedited shipping because everything always comes real quick.

13
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,672
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just because we live in the Northeast.

14
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:08,175
Speaker 1: I don't know.

15
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:12,840
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, it also depends on who's shipping it and where they're shipping it from.

16
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:15,833
Speaker 0: I mean because the hard drive was from New Jersey.

17
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:17,480
Speaker 0: I found that that's why I got here so fast.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,007
Speaker 0: The RAM is from California.

19
00:01:19,047 --> 00:01:20,655
Speaker 0: So it's gonna take a day or two more.

20
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:21,640
Speaker 1: actually, you know what?

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,706
Speaker 1: I had the same deal.

22
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:27,720
Speaker 1: my case and power supply Came from New Jersey and we're here the next day when I were in my computer.

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,849
Speaker 1: The rest of it took four days because it came from California.

24
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,080
Speaker 0: Yep, and also like DHL sends my comic books They take like four days from I think Indiana.

25
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:45,220
Speaker 0: Meanwhile You know FedEx from California or UPS from California is faster than DHL from Indiana.

26
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:51,460
Speaker 1: At any rate expect us to be playing some PC games now that we both have generally functioning computers.

27
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:52,504
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe.

28
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,608
Speaker 1: well, I will be.

29
00:01:53,669 --> 00:01:56,540
Speaker 1: I'm playing half-life 2 and I gotta tell you it's awesome.

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,757
Speaker 1: It is meeting and or exceeding all expectations thus far and I've played it for an hour and five minutes.

31
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,430
Speaker 0: Haha I got to play it again me.

32
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,960
Speaker 0: I maybe what I'll do is I'll play episode.

33
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,560
Speaker 0: I'll play episode zero, you know one and two all in a big row might be a good idea.

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,079
Speaker 0: Maybe I could time it so that I finish episode one like the day episode two comes out or something like that.

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,799
Speaker 1: now I'm holding out because real soon I'm getting either the 20 inch to the 22 inch widescreen and I really want to play the game in the widescreen.

36
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,359
Speaker 0: Awesome Yeah, that's probably good idea.

37
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:33,749
Speaker 0: So I ran from work to the train today because you know tomorrow's Independence Day in the United States The day of the Declaration of Independence signing.

38
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:36,838
Speaker 0: supposedly, I guess we don't know 100% but it probably is.

39
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:38,267
Speaker 0: that's the date They wrote on it, right?

40
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:45,254
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway Continue calendar could be off, you know, it's an old 1700s calendar.

41
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,218
Speaker 0: You can't trust those things.

42
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:48,024
Speaker 0: Like we don't know.

43
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:49,792
Speaker 0: the year zero was the actual day.

44
00:02:49,872 --> 00:02:50,656
Speaker 0: Jesus was born.

45
00:02:50,676 --> 00:02:53,289
Speaker 0: if there was such a person Well, we've got an idea.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,119
Speaker 0: We got an idea but not a perfect idea.

47
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that means I don't to work tomorrow.

48
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:04,180
Speaker 0: So getting home sooner makes a big difference because it adds to my one-day middle-of-the-week vacation All right.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,060
Speaker 0: So I tried to get on the 509 instead of the 528 which usually gets me home about 20 minutes earlier.

50
00:03:10,563 --> 00:03:12,254
Speaker 1: I do notice you came home about the same time.

51
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:12,817
Speaker 1: You always do.

52
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:15,908
Speaker 0: Yep Well, I'm sitting on the train and it's going.

53
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:16,409
Speaker 0: I made the 509.

54
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:17,813
Speaker 0: I had to run.

55
00:03:17,853 --> 00:03:28,905
Speaker 0: I got on it like 507 and Somewhere like right before the Riverdale station some lady in the car is like screaming and I'm like what the hell, uh-huh and everyone's like what the hell.

56
00:03:29,347 --> 00:03:37,738
Speaker 1: cuz I just want to point out that I ride a different train on the same line and There were a bunch of cops on my train and add a bunch of the stations as I was going up.

57
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:39,064
Speaker 1: No, not related.

58
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:39,827
Speaker 0: No, okay.

59
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:45,367
Speaker 0: I just wondered so, you know, she was screaming something and I guess it must have been her daughter.

60
00:03:45,427 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 0: She looked like a grandma and her daughter was like, oh, what's the problem?

61
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:51,229
Speaker 0: And then I guess they had.

62
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:53,179
Speaker 0: the daughter also had small children.

63
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:58,957
Speaker 0: Apparently this lady was having I don't know a heart attack a stroke a diabetic shock or something.

64
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:05,839
Speaker 0: All right, and You know the late the the daughter tried to go for the emergency break.

65
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,231
Speaker 0: wine No, and I had to.

66
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:11,979
Speaker 0: I was like no I see because I was sitting at the end and I was like, no, I didn't let her do it.

67
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:13,625
Speaker 1: Good for you You saved.

68
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:15,019
Speaker 1: you probably saved a life.

69
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:20,699
Speaker 1: Hitting that break is probably the worst thing you could ever do an emergency for anyone on a train ever.

70
00:04:22,101 --> 00:04:24,590
Speaker 0: There's a thing I in the train it says emergency break.

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,376
Speaker 1: they're all over there between the cars.

72
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,540
Speaker 1: They're usually a glass thing.

73
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,551
Speaker 1: They're hidden under seats.

74
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:29,299
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them.

75
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,079
Speaker 0: There's like red handles that you can pull to activate the emergency break.

76
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,690
Speaker 0: Never under almost any circumstance.

77
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,437
Speaker 0: Should you ever pull that thing ever?

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,264
Speaker 0: Even if it's the worst emergency ever like nuclear bomb don't pull it Don't not pull it.

79
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:44,625
Speaker 1: now.

80
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,351
Speaker 1: part of the reason is that these break.

81
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,897
Speaker 1: that is the last chance break.

82
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,744
Speaker 1: That is the Emergency break.

83
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:52,094
Speaker 1: it's not like in your car where it's also the parking brake.

84
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:56,347
Speaker 1: if you pull that all Shit breaks loose and all bets are off.

85
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:01,040
Speaker 1: also that train stopping and not going anywhere for a long time.

86
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,720
Speaker 0: Yes The way the emergency brake first of all The.

87
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:11,983
Speaker 0: there's one that basically the reason they have those brakes at all is let's say your train car gets loose and is just rolling Down the track.

88
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:13,427
Speaker 0: you have a way to stop.

89
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:17,760
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the only reasonable circumstance in which you would ever pull that thing.

90
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:24,160
Speaker 1: I mean granted that there are different mechanisms and all sorts of yes Yes, it's actually kind of interesting how those brakes work, but we're not gonna get into that.

91
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,295
Speaker 0: But if you pull that thing the brake activates and cannot be deactivated.

92
00:05:29,335 --> 00:05:34,399
Speaker 0: without powerful machinery You will be sitting in that train car for a long time.

93
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:41,580
Speaker 0: Also, even if it was a normal break now, you're stuck in the middle of nowhere as opposed to at a train station.

94
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:50,950
Speaker 1: Yeah See I it always bothers me how so many people just lose their head whenever something bad happens and instead of Doing the logical thing, which is all right alert the conductor.

95
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,962
Speaker 1: There'll be paramedics waiting at the next train station Guaranteed.

96
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,570
Speaker 0: actually we got to Yonkers before the paramedics got there.

97
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,011
Speaker 0: Really?

98
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,621
Speaker 1: Yeah after I actually, you know Riverdale's like right there so I know.

99
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:07,087
Speaker 0: but basically I called 911 after I stopped the lady from pulling the thing and Everyone else was going.

100
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:08,760
Speaker 0: is there a doctor on the train?

101
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:13,335
Speaker 0: I'm just talking to the 911 operator and he's like, all right.

102
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,480
Speaker 0: So what station are you at?

103
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,588
Speaker 0: I'm like, uh, and then I see Riverdale go by and like Riverdale And then he's like, what's the next stop?

104
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,980
Speaker 0: I'm like, I have no idea not a clue.

105
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,227
Speaker 0: Yeah And he's like could I talk to the conductor?

106
00:06:25,287 --> 00:06:27,154
Speaker 0: and the conductor wasn't even there yet at that point.

107
00:06:27,676 --> 00:06:30,313
Speaker 0: and then the conductor was like Yeah, I'll talk to my dispatcher first.

108
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:31,260
Speaker 0: I'm like, all right, whatever.

109
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:37,559
Speaker 0: Wow, and then the 911 guy eventually didn't want to talk to me anymore and we waited at Yonkers for like 20 minutes.

110
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:43,106
Speaker 0: thus I could have gotten on the 528 train had been fine.

111
00:06:43,166 --> 00:06:47,320
Speaker 1: But no, you know, you probably could have caught any number of trains from Yonkers.

112
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,840
Speaker 1: Did they make you stay on the train or could you know we're all staying on the train and could you have gotten off?

113
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,471
Speaker 0: There was no train past us while we were sitting there.

114
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,098
Speaker 1: Oh must have just been bad timing.

115
00:06:56,118 --> 00:06:57,928
Speaker 0: Yeah So that was that.

116
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,679
Speaker 1: oh, well you saved a life.

117
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:02,371
Speaker 1: No, think about it.

118
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:08,918
Speaker 1: if she had pulled that brake, you know You know hard it would have been for any sort of EMT to get to that train.

119
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:15,420
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah If she pulled the brake, you know the lady next the lady sitting across to me also didn't let her pull the brake.

120
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,925
Speaker 1: So I just I mean one.

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:23,655
Speaker 1: there are signs everywhere saying don't ever pull this brake ever not for you Not for you ever.

122
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,340
Speaker 1: but on the other end.

123
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,920
Speaker 1: It seems like whenever people panic they look around if there's anything red or looks like it's an emergency thing.

124
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,666
Speaker 1: They'll hit any emergency button they see.

125
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:38,650
Speaker 1: but they never think to do the logical thing of stop assess the situation Call 911 if appropriate.

126
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I did.

127
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:44,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess we're pretty cool-headed when they took the lady off the train.

128
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,560
Speaker 0: She was not dead.

129
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,871
Speaker 0: She was kind of unconscious ish, but not dead.

130
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,075
Speaker 0: So wow.

131
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,660
Speaker 1: Well that beats the hell out of my leader bit.

132
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:52,853
Speaker 1: So I'll just keep quiet.

133
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:53,398
Speaker 0: That's right.

134
00:07:54,982 --> 00:08:01,960
Speaker 1: So speaking of racism racism Those black trains?

135
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,451
Speaker 0: No, it's those red handles those red, Connecticut trains.

136
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:06,973
Speaker 0: Yeah.

137
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,140
Speaker 0: Those are always the nastiest trains, too Because they use the overhead electricity.

138
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:24,450
Speaker 0: Well, no, I mean not to mention the fact yeah If you stop that train in Riverdale, not only can the EMTs not get their little EMT ambulance out there You can't turn off the third rail Plus, I mean think about it.

139
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,880
Speaker 0: I'll die trying to get to the train.

140
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:27,700
Speaker 1: It's not like it was gonna be stopped at a station.

141
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:28,620
Speaker 1: It was gonna be stopped.

142
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:28,961
Speaker 1: I mean the.

143
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,067
Speaker 1: the train tracks down in New York.

144
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:32,773
Speaker 1: there on the heart the Hudson line.

145
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:38,347
Speaker 1: on one side is the Hudson River Usually like five feet away from the train.

146
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:41,176
Speaker 1: Yeah, and on the other side is usually a cliff.

147
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:42,600
Speaker 1: there's no access.

148
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:43,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, do not.

149
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:55,105
Speaker 0: well, this is before Yonkers But even so yes, if you pull it and the train is stuck between a cliff and the river They're gonna need helicopters and boats and you're gonna be waiting All right.

150
00:08:55,488 --> 00:09:01,435
Speaker 1: So anyway speaking of racism I'm sure you're all familiar with John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory.

151
00:09:01,596 --> 00:09:02,800
Speaker 1: if you're not I've linked to it.

152
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,081
Speaker 1: I think

153
00:09:03,122 --> 00:09:06,600
Speaker 0: it's become at this point John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad law

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:26,099
Speaker 1: Possibly because I have yeah, I mean Suffice to say this theory states that if you take a normal person and you add to this normal person anonymity and an audience of any size They will inevitably over time become a total fuckwad.

155
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:38,357
Speaker 1: yeah, now the the term for both this process and For the resulting Items that happen of interest is shit cock shit cocking shit cockery.

156
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:48,331
Speaker 1: Yep We actually ran a counter-strike server a long time ago that we named shit cockless Stan because we kicked anyone who shit cocked But that resulted in quite an empty server.

157
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,300
Speaker 1: Yes, it did because you know what?

158
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,891
Speaker 1: I gotta say shit cocking and counter-strike is much like cheating at Euchre.

159
00:09:54,534 --> 00:09:55,858
Speaker 1: The games not the same with you.

160
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:56,360
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

161
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:56,928
Speaker 0: That's right, right.

162
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,706
Speaker 1: So we're used to this.

163
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:08,997
Speaker 1: we've been playing counter-strike and not a day goes by in my life where I'm not called a gay Homosexual lizard by some sort of 12 to 12 and a half year old kid.

164
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:09,860
Speaker 0: at least they're honest.

165
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,367
Speaker 1: Now it seems like people use.

166
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:15,073
Speaker 1: I'm just getting right over that.

167
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,500
Speaker 1: I'm just not even gonna dignify that with a response.

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,931
Speaker 1: So this is endemic on the internet.

169
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:22,635
Speaker 1: this happens.

170
00:10:22,675 --> 00:10:23,499
Speaker 1: you have to deal with it.

171
00:10:23,801 --> 00:10:30,483
Speaker 1: The Internet is the wild wild west and there are very few places where you can escape from this Anywhere.

172
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:35,059
Speaker 1: you can in any way manipulate anything that any other person will ever see.

173
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:41,640
Speaker 1: Hoards of people Scott and I included will do everything within their power to make it resemble a penis.

174
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that is also true.

175
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:47,891
Speaker 1: going to my I mean going to Mario Kart and play Mario Kart Everyone can make the little custom icon.

176
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:48,998
Speaker 1: Mine is crazy.

177
00:10:49,038 --> 00:10:52,230
Speaker 1: Bunta I can't mind you.

178
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:59,360
Speaker 1: the sheer number of Phalluses that I encountered playing that game some black ones some white ones.

179
00:10:59,682 --> 00:11:00,548
Speaker 1: One of them was oozing.

180
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,059
Speaker 1: one of them was pointed right at me.

181
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:09,265
Speaker 0: I mean if there's any game that actually lets you make an avatar penises abound Of any kind.

182
00:11:09,325 --> 00:11:12,420
Speaker 0: not just people can put decals on the pokeballs that they can draw.

183
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,420
Speaker 0: Can you actually draw them or do you need to collect them?

184
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:15,619
Speaker 1: I think you have to collect them.

185
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:20,620
Speaker 0: But if they let you draw the decals for your pokeballs people would have these pokey penis balls.

186
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:23,087
Speaker 1: Ah, I mean, that's just the way the internet is.

187
00:11:23,107 --> 00:11:31,297
Speaker 1: if you want an example of this go to YouTube and look at any Comments any Oh Akaki board you will see penises.

188
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:34,577
Speaker 1: Oh god Any shared space on the internet?

189
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,550
Speaker 1: Second life is as a lot of you know that thing where it's like.

190
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,520
Speaker 0: it simulates a refrigerator with the alphabet magnets on it.

191
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,088
Speaker 1: I spent a lot.

192
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,220
Speaker 0: everyone kind of shares the same refrigerator.

193
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:54,500
Speaker 1: I remember one time I was there when these things first started getting popular at RIT And I was trying to construct a penis by taking all the letters and drawing them in the shape of a penis.

194
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:59,360
Speaker 1: Someone else was trying to write the word fuck as many times as he could and he kept stealing my letters.

195
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:05,885
Speaker 0: Yeah I like the people who just grab as many letters they couldn't put them in the corner and a giant stack making it really hard to do anything,

196
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:14,600
Speaker 1: but that's the way the internet works and You gotta have a little bit of a thick skin if you want to be on the internet And you want to be in any sort of shared space

197
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:15,301
Speaker 0: You

198
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:26,408
Speaker 1: have to deal with the fact that you're going to be playing games with people who were named things like Snape kills Dumbledore or Penis or my favorite was on Mario Kart.

199
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,853
Speaker 1: There's a man whose name.

200
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:35,560
Speaker 1: Well, I guess a man was fuck fuck Nice, and his graphic was the word fuck written in white with a black background.

201
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,066
Speaker 1: No, and that was it.

202
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,657
Speaker 0: Yeah counter-strike sprays all porn.

203
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,704
Speaker 1: Oh Sometimes furry porn.

204
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually just straight-up porn.

205
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:45,375
Speaker 1: Yep, sometimes gun porn.

206
00:12:46,097 --> 00:12:53,340
Speaker 1: Well, uh Apparently many of the people using Xbox Live are not quite familiar with this law of the Internet.

207
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,524
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

208
00:12:54,564 --> 00:12:57,974
Speaker 1: See someone on Forza 2 you can customize your car.

209
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:01,646
Speaker 1: So they made the 1954 300 SL white power mobile.

210
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:13,045
Speaker 0: I Gotta say it's pretty terrific while the guys if the guys that you know white power are not cool, but white power mobile Awesome.

211
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:16,220
Speaker 1: I highly doubt the person who did this is actually racist.

212
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:17,965
Speaker 1: I mean it can it.

213
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:20,752
Speaker 1: first of all it has the SS lightning bolts on the back.

214
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,400
Speaker 1: It says real Hitler white power.

215
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,806
Speaker 1: It's got the Iron Cross.

216
00:13:25,007 --> 00:13:36,685
Speaker 1: It's black like all those Nazi cars back in the day Yep, but the hood as a red Nazi flag on it complete with swastika And the guy's name is dreamer 61.

217
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:39,291
Speaker 0: So that's a pretty cool thing there.

218
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:41,717
Speaker 0: cuz as much as Nazis are the worst.

219
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:46,353
Speaker 0: I Mean Indiana Jones wouldn't be cool if it didn't have Nazis in it.

220
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,240
Speaker 0: I mean you got to look at it that way.

221
00:13:48,502 --> 00:13:55,514
Speaker 1: I hate Illinois Nazis as much as the rest of you But I do not condone Jake and Elwood's actions in regards to those Illinois Nazis.

222
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,286
Speaker 1: I do but I Enjoy their actions exactly.

223
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:03,560
Speaker 1: I do not feel sympathy for the people those actions were directed toward.

224
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,290
Speaker 1: However, I don't condone them because freedom of speech.

225
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:10,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is they're blocking the road Yeah, but they had a permit.

226
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:13,026
Speaker 0: you'd have a permit to block the road They did in the movie.

227
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:15,320
Speaker 1: Remember the cop was like they got a permit.

228
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,286
Speaker 0: I thought that was a permit to protest not to block the road They were allowed to brought.

229
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,620
Speaker 1: but the point was the cop wasn't getting rid of them.

230
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,952
Speaker 1: So they obviously had some sort of the cops acting.

231
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:24,978
Speaker 0: cop was probably one of them.

232
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:28,914
Speaker 1: No, cuz he didn't like the Nazis now he didn't.

233
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:32,457
Speaker 1: oh, all right If you guys don't know what we're talking about right now get off my podcast.

234
00:14:32,517 --> 00:14:32,940
Speaker 0: That's right.

235
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:37,575
Speaker 1: Anyway, I find this hilarious and I got to say what.

236
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:41,113
Speaker 1: the reason I find it interesting Is that there's a shitstorm on the internet?

237
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:42,260
Speaker 0: How dare?

238
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,945
Speaker 1: Microsoft let this stand.

239
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:46,214
Speaker 1: how dare they let this be here.

240
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:47,860
Speaker 1: They should do something about it.

241
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,030
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't want your free speech.

242
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,393
Speaker 0: fine.

243
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,582
Speaker 1: Shut up Now.

244
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:58,500
Speaker 1: the best part is all the people who are so mad about this cite the terms of service Which state that you can't have hate literature on Xbox Live.

245
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,069
Speaker 0: It's not hate literature or anything like that.

246
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:06,128
Speaker 1: if you read the terms of service this kind of thing is pretty Specifically, but I don't think it's hateful.

247
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:11,880
Speaker 1: I think it's humorous now regardless that the actual things They've got here are pretty much disallowed by the terms of service.

248
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,342
Speaker 0: All right.

249
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:16,497
Speaker 1: However, I want to point out to a lot of people out there why your argument is faulty.

250
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,419
Speaker 1: sure It might be in violation of the terms of service.

251
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:38,509
Speaker 1: just because Microsoft says you're not allowed to do X on their service does not mean they're Obligated to prevent you from doing X if they don't want to because they did not tell you or have an agreement with you saying that they would get rid of these things or that they have to or that you Will not see these things.

252
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:47,344
Speaker 1: All they said is that they don't want you to do these things and if you do they have the right to kick you off Or deny you service, but they do not have the responsibility to kick you off.

253
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:48,047
Speaker 0: That's right.

254
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,490
Speaker 1: So Apparently to Microsoft is trying to do something about this.

255
00:15:52,972 --> 00:15:57,273
Speaker 1: I think the problem is now that this sort of thing is Recognizable on the internet.

256
00:15:57,835 --> 00:16:00,422
Speaker 1: the Hitler penis white power fuckwad shit.

257
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,447
Speaker 1: cockers are growing in number.

258
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,698
Speaker 1: Hooray That's all I have to say about that.

259
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,287
Speaker 0: All right, I probably would have used this news tomorrow But I have more important news for tomorrow.

260
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:18,510
Speaker 0: So Apparently there's a comic book store in I think Utah Salt Lake City maybe called night flight comics.

261
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:22,163
Speaker 0: Utah is not a place near the Salt Lake City main library something.

262
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:31,140
Speaker 0: All right, and someone went to this comic book store over the weekend and They were looking at some Simpsons bust-ups.

263
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,764
Speaker 0: And basically what it is is a little miss.

264
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:40,330
Speaker 0: It's a little cardboard box and Inside is a you know, a plastic bust of a Simpsons character.

265
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,610
Speaker 0: I know there's sort of those collectibles where you you know, you don't know which ones in there.

266
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:50,330
Speaker 0: So you buy one you might get Bart you buy another one You might get home or you might get another Bart, you know, how many boxes of anime ones?

267
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:56,936
Speaker 0: I've got all over the place and then you might you know, if you're lucky you'll get like the the golden moe or something I don't know with two knives.

268
00:16:56,957 --> 00:17:03,396
Speaker 0: Yeah the chase figures anyway, so someone was looking at these and They saw the lid was taped shut.

269
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:07,569
Speaker 0: and the fact that it was taped shut leads me to believe that it had been previously opened.

270
00:17:07,952 --> 00:17:08,935
Speaker 1: But that's beside the point.

271
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:09,156
Speaker 1: Yes.

272
00:17:09,598 --> 00:17:12,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, the person saw the box was taped shut.

273
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:16,673
Speaker 0: They actually the person said because this is all just you know What the people said.

274
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:22,390
Speaker 0: he said she said yes that it appeared that the box had already previously been opened.

275
00:17:22,771 --> 00:17:25,704
Speaker 0: So they figured there was no problem opening it and looking inside.

276
00:17:26,127 --> 00:17:27,794
Speaker 1: I will point out I'm not.

277
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,303
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that I disagree with this person.

278
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:31,106
Speaker 1: All I'm saying.

279
00:17:31,187 --> 00:17:32,090
Speaker 0: Oh, I haven't even got to the new.

280
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:32,874
Speaker 1: No, I know.

281
00:17:33,014 --> 00:17:43,810
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that that specific statement reeks of Someone trying to justify their actions and/or get out of having possibly done something wrong.

282
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:46,728
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's a seven dollar toy, right.

283
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:55,680
Speaker 0: and someone opened the lid and the store proprietor Said, you know, basically hey, you got to pay for that.

284
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:56,242
Speaker 0: and they were.

285
00:17:56,402 --> 00:18:00,479
Speaker 0: and the people said, uh, no we don't cuz they don't.

286
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:08,167
Speaker 0: and The star proprietor then told someone else to stand in front of the door and not let them leave.

287
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:13,405
Speaker 1: Whoa That's the point I call 9-1-1 and Sam being illegally detained.

288
00:18:13,465 --> 00:18:13,686
Speaker 0: Yep.

289
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:14,629
Speaker 0: So wait, wait, wait.

290
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,106
Speaker 0: So the store owner called 9-1-1 to tell what was going on.

291
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,230
Speaker 1: This is a genius here.

292
00:18:20,832 --> 00:18:25,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, like hey, these people are shoplifting opening up merchandise and refusing to pay for it.

293
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:28,999
Speaker 1: I'm gonna translate Here's what the 9-1-1 operator heard from.

294
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:30,143
Speaker 1: this guy translated.

295
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:30,765
Speaker 1: It was a girl.

296
00:18:30,805 --> 00:18:32,290
Speaker 1: I think this is a store owner.

297
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:34,909
Speaker 1: Yep, here's what was the what actually was said?

298
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:40,326
Speaker 1: Hi, I'd like to report that I am currently in the process of kidnapping and detaining two people.

299
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:45,764
Speaker 1: Yes in my store Yeah, please come and force me to let them go possibly press charges against me.

300
00:18:45,944 --> 00:18:59,748
Speaker 0: So 50 minutes later the cop showed up and said, uh-huh, well You have to let these people go and we're gonna look into it and possibly charge you with illegally detaining them.

301
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:06,209
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah See I like it when a cop knows the law in most places in the United States first off.

302
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:10,769
Speaker 1: Anyone who says they ever break it you bought it policy or anything like that is foolish.

303
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:10,870
Speaker 0: it.

304
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,544
Speaker 1: There's nothing they can do about it unless they can prove that you did it willfully.

305
00:19:15,564 --> 00:19:17,350
Speaker 0: and if you did it willfully, that's vandalism.

306
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,001
Speaker 0: So it's completely different.

307
00:19:19,061 --> 00:19:34,793
Speaker 0: if you go into a store Let's say I go into the Ferrari dealer right the Ferrari dealer and I accidentally Like fall over and I don't know scratch chain reaction of events happens and it blows up the car Like boat.

308
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:35,776
Speaker 0: the car is ruined.

309
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,863
Speaker 0: That's like a $300,000 car.

310
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:42,741
Speaker 0: You know how much I'm liable to pay Zero if I didn't do it on purpose.

311
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:47,967
Speaker 0: and if they want money I gotta have to sue me and win which is not gonna be easy.

312
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:52,723
Speaker 1: Yep So yeah, I remember this almost happened to us at Connecticut last year.

313
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:54,570
Speaker 1: this not that it was any fault of Connecticut.

314
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,023
Speaker 1: Remember when we're getting ready to leave right?

315
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:06,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when we'd come in in the morning There was a lady with the uniform on and she was selling the parking tickets to everyone and she said all day five dollars.

316
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:07,712
Speaker 1: so we bought one.

317
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:10,057
Speaker 1: everyone bought one going in and we're trying to leave.

318
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:14,521
Speaker 1: the con at the end of the night and Every person in front of us takes forever.

319
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,108
Speaker 1: It looks like they're arguing with the attendant.

320
00:20:16,229 --> 00:20:17,612
Speaker 0: We don't know I remember now.

321
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,054
Speaker 1: so we finally get up.

322
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,658
Speaker 1: we hand the ticket and he's like twelve dollars.

323
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,328
Speaker 1: So we're like It said all day for five dollars.

324
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:32,806
Speaker 1: and he said yeah until 8 p.m And we said, um She said all day.

325
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:34,292
Speaker 1: She didn't say 8 p.m.

326
00:20:34,754 --> 00:20:38,426
Speaker 1: We're not paying and We sat there waiting for his response.

327
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:44,807
Speaker 1: now had he chose to not just sigh and let us go We probably would have been calling the police right away.

328
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,575
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz you can't keep me there.

329
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:49,300
Speaker 0: That's illegally detaining me.

330
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,008
Speaker 0: I will pay the five dollars.

331
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:51,993
Speaker 0: I agreed to pay.

332
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,199
Speaker 0: Yep, and that's it.

333
00:20:53,921 --> 00:21:04,415
Speaker 1: So if a store owner ever gives you grief like that or ever decides to bar your way out unless they are a peace officer You can just leave and if they lay a hand on you you can sue.

334
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:10,120
Speaker 0: not only that But if you're say leaving Best Buy right and they say hey, can we see your receipt?

335
00:21:10,621 --> 00:21:11,968
Speaker 0: You don't have to say anything.

336
00:21:11,988 --> 00:21:12,691
Speaker 0: You can just leave.

337
00:21:12,953 --> 00:21:13,978
Speaker 0: they can't keep you there.

338
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:16,047
Speaker 1: granted They could ban you from the store if they want.

339
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:18,196
Speaker 0: they could ban you from the store if they wanted to.

340
00:21:18,597 --> 00:21:26,066
Speaker 0: they could You know call the police I guess but they might get in trouble for you know Calling the police for no reason.

341
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:33,240
Speaker 1: if they have if they have a peace officer or a police officer And they have reasonable suspicion that you did steal something they could arrest you or stop you.

342
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,920
Speaker 0: But yes, I mean they could always try to citizens arrest you or something like that.

343
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,840
Speaker 0: But if they got it wrong man, are they in trouble?

344
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:47,048
Speaker 1: I guess the moral is don't ever detain another human being Unless you are an officer of the law.

345
00:21:47,248 --> 00:21:51,100
Speaker 0: or unless you are like if you see someone beating someone up you can detain them.

346
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,619
Speaker 0: Yeah.

347
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,000
Speaker 0: Or do you see like if you see someone like hit someone with their car and try to run away?

348
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,464
Speaker 0: You can detain them too.

349
00:21:58,564 --> 00:21:59,989
Speaker 0: Probably you'll be fine.

350
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:00,953
Speaker 0: I imagine.

351
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:05,853
Speaker 1: but if someone opened your Simpsons bust You can't lock them in your store and demand payment.

352
00:22:06,114 --> 00:22:07,360
Speaker 0: That's just the tough shit rule.

353
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,493
Speaker 0: So also if you own a store don't put anything expensive in a precarious position.

354
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,480
Speaker 1: Yes, because then it's your fault if it breaks.

355
00:22:13,721 --> 00:22:14,623
Speaker 0: Yes, oh.

356
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:21,267
Speaker 0: and one last thing if you go out of a store just like the receipt if the security system goes off You can just keep walking.

357
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:23,780
Speaker 0: Also, however, I give you two pieces of advice.

358
00:22:24,404 --> 00:22:31,480
Speaker 0: Number one if you're shopping for clothing You probably want to turn around because you're not gonna be able to get those tags off at home without getting ink all over your clothes.

359
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:41,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, and number two You might want to look in your bag before you just keep walking because what if someone like slips something in there and you are Shoplifting and you don't know it?

360
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:41,620
Speaker 1: or what?

361
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,400
Speaker 1: If you just forgot and you have something in your pocket or an extra bag or something under the card or whatever?

362
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:59,116
Speaker 0: but if you're sure that you're not shoplifting and you're sure that you know all the security devices have been removed from your products so that you can take them home and not worry about It and the security thing goes off when you walk through don't even hesitate.

363
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,000
Speaker 0: Just keep walking.

364
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:01,666
Speaker 0: See, I'm usually no one.

365
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:03,150
Speaker 0: don't just keep walking.

366
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:07,599
Speaker 1: See if they ask for my receipt and it's not a good inconvenience I'll just stop and show it to him cuz I don't care.

367
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:17,780
Speaker 1: But Generally, it's been the case where I'll be trying to leave a Best Buy or something and there'll be a line at the receipt checker Guy, because there's only one guy and a bunch of people trying to leave and there's no way I'm waiting.

368
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,349
Speaker 1: I'm only gonna stop if it's convenient.

369
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:21,199
Speaker 0: It's basically never convenient for me.

370
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,305
Speaker 1: I'm never in that much of a hurry.

371
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:27,260
Speaker 1: the two seconds as I wave the receipt at him and then he nods me by.

372
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,840
Speaker 0: Maybe I could have a policy of throw the receipt at the guy and keep walking.

373
00:23:31,082 --> 00:23:33,779
Speaker 1: Yeah fashion into a paper airplane be like, here you go.

374
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:39,039
Speaker 1: Yep What would be really funny is if you'd written on the receipt I stole a TV, haha.

375
00:23:42,382 --> 00:23:46,939
Speaker 0: And then if I didn't what would happen if they called the police, ah I'm not a lawyer.

376
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:54,121
Speaker 0: Yeah That'd be kind of a weird situation like you sort of lying that you committed a crime but not to a police officer not under Oath.

377
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,997
Speaker 1: I know part of an investigation and it's not illegal in and of itself to lie.

378
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:01,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know I mean like what if I tell you hey rim, I killed somebody?

379
00:24:02,434 --> 00:24:03,780
Speaker 1: I think you're within your rights to do that.

380
00:24:04,021 --> 00:24:08,440
Speaker 0: However, I think by the same token, but then if you call the police and I didn't kill someone can I get in trouble?

381
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,077
Speaker 1: See I think by the same token the worst that would happen is the police would have the right to investigate you.

382
00:24:14,097 --> 00:24:19,806
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, that would because yeah It does create a probable cause.

383
00:24:19,846 --> 00:24:25,684
Speaker 1: see I think the punishment for that while it is not a punishment of law like alright You broke the law by lying.

384
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:30,000
Speaker 1: whatever the punishment is you've now got the attention of the police.

385
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,239
Speaker 1: They're probably slightly displeased with you.

386
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:45,660
Speaker 1: Okay, all right the hunger oh good guy is never-ending with the wolf.

387
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:54,089
Speaker 1: All right, this is unequivocally the worst Music video ever made.

388
00:24:54,751 --> 00:24:57,660
Speaker 0: I remember that willow whatever that's got nothing on this.

389
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,635
Speaker 0: This is worse than that.

390
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:05,890
Speaker 1: So all I'm gonna say and I really think you need to watch this and I'll warn you The song might get stuck in your head.

391
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,194
Speaker 1: I'm having some so bad though I don't know how it happens, but it is it's stuck in my head.

392
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:12,560
Speaker 1: I keep thinking about it.

393
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,770
Speaker 1: I have to force it out with other things.

394
00:25:15,393 --> 00:25:16,879
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's so bad.

395
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:23,105
Speaker 1: Basically, this is the kind of thing that would have been awesome to me when I was 12.

396
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:25,002
Speaker 0: I would never be awesome to me I don't know.

397
00:25:25,062 --> 00:25:32,692
Speaker 1: maybe not this specifically but the kind of aesthetic of the dark and brooding whatever blah blah blah But maybe for a goth kid more importantly emo kid.

398
00:25:33,174 --> 00:25:44,140
Speaker 1: This is very much Reminiscent of pretty much everything that I saw like every Personality traits that I saw in many of the larpers that we knew back at our IT.

399
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:45,721
Speaker 0: That's what it is Like.

400
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:56,979
Speaker 1: I think the moment that really crystallized that for me Was when he falls into the middle of a white wolf larp Basically and all the vampires sitting at their tables in their cloaks walk toward him menacingly.

401
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was sort of out there basically the poorly rendered Anubis.

402
00:26:03,922 --> 00:26:11,251
Speaker 1: When Anubis slaps him and then they go on a vacation to our bad CG Egypt Yeah on the bad CG boat on the bad CG Nile.

403
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:12,595
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

404
00:26:12,635 --> 00:26:19,760
Speaker 0: This is I. You know, some things are so bad that they're good because you know, they're so bad that you laugh at how bad it is.

405
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:21,124
Speaker 0: This is just so bad.

406
00:26:21,144 --> 00:26:25,637
Speaker 0: But yet at the same time this is worse than like great digital target.

407
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,662
Speaker 1: It's almost Mesmerizing.

408
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,389
Speaker 1: you have trouble looking away.

409
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:29,449
Speaker 1: No.

410
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:32,300
Speaker 0: No, I don't have any trouble looking away now.

411
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:43,448
Speaker 1: What's really funny is that if you look at this, I'm reasonably certain that one the guy who did it the main guy somehow Feels that this is indicative of the feelings.

412
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:51,860
Speaker 1: He feels inside - I'd wager there's a girl He likes who's with some other guy who isn't crazy and he feels like they should be together.

413
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:56,400
Speaker 1: And this is kind of a cry for help to her to show her how he really feels.

414
00:26:57,102 --> 00:27:02,479
Speaker 1: I also think that he basically wrote a fanfiction about himself and then Mary sued himself into it.

415
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:04,140
Speaker 0: All those things are true.

416
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,000
Speaker 0: Also, I'm pretty sure the guy who made this thinks that this is actually really good when it's the worst thing ever.

417
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:15,360
Speaker 0: So I wonder what sort of movies and TV shows and books does he like now?

418
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,660
Speaker 0: I know who's buying all those really crappy books at the pin the sci-fi.

419
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,790
Speaker 1: He probably plays white wolf but with his own variant.

420
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,740
Speaker 1: because he dislikes the cam and their political bullshit.

421
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,329
Speaker 1: He probably larbs to the exclusion of all else.

422
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,694
Speaker 1: I'll bet he wears a lot of black.

423
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 1: I'll bet he's a neo-pagan.

424
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:34,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll bet he didn't graduate from college.

425
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:37,436
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's that's it.

426
00:27:37,596 --> 00:27:38,720
Speaker 0: I would not bet against you.

427
00:27:39,223 --> 00:27:43,439
Speaker 1: I recommend watching this once and never ever watching it again.

428
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:53,658
Speaker 0: If you need to show it to someone else just send them the link don't watch it with them or at least turn it on And then walk out of the room because watching it more than once is probably going to damage you somehow.

429
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:55,492
Speaker 1: god That's kind of like the goat see Bob.

430
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,954
Speaker 1: go to a website That'll show a goat see after a couple minutes and then just leave the room.

431
00:27:59,316 --> 00:28:00,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

432
00:28:00,582 --> 00:28:01,548
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got for me?

433
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:03,679
Speaker 0: So it's video game action here.

434
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:11,900
Speaker 0: Basically, it's a video on YouTube and I'd say this video is an ingenious work of art.

435
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:20,049
Speaker 1: I'll agree in that if it was exactly what I expected which was somewhat unexpected I know that sounds strange, but that's how I feel.

436
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:24,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this this video is called Goombas lifetime.

437
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:28,920
Speaker 0: it shows you the life of a Goomba and there's not much else to say about it.

438
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,072
Speaker 0: It's art.

439
00:28:30,193 --> 00:28:30,740
Speaker 1: What can we say?

440
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,580
Speaker 0: That's it, right?

441
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:41,199
Speaker 1: So we bought a bunch of board games a while ago that we keep talking about how we're going to talk about and this past Weekend, we did something we haven't done in a long time.

442
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,511
Speaker 1: Instead of having no one over or the entire front row crew over.

443
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,864
Speaker 1: we had one person over and we played board games pretty much All weekend.

444
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:52,420
Speaker 0: Ah, we haven't had one of those in a long time.

445
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,576
Speaker 1: It was pretty awesome particularly the fact that we played tigers and Euphrates which is still far away two times My favorite game ever.

446
00:28:59,818 --> 00:29:05,180
Speaker 1: Yeah However, I do want to get this gripe out into the world since now I have an audience for it.

447
00:29:05,942 --> 00:29:09,374
Speaker 1: I won the first game pretty handily but no biggie the second game.

448
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:16,618
Speaker 1: while I might not have won it I definitely would have not have lost so much had Scott not given the game to Alex.

449
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:19,627
Speaker 0: Yeah I really that was sort of accidental there.

450
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:28,420
Speaker 1: Scott built a gigantic point generating machine and then basically said Alex I entrust this to you and then he proceeded to bumble around the board for the next 20 minutes.

451
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Speaker 0: I had a plan in which I would gay I would remain retain control of that point generating machine.

452
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:37,920
Speaker 0: I also had a backup plan Scott and both of those plans failed miserably.

453
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,119
Speaker 1: I uh, I don't think you thought your clever plan quite all the way through.

454
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:51,700
Speaker 0: No, not all the way through only as much of the way through as I usually think it which yes It's sufficient most of the time but it's not as sometimes it just goes downhill.

455
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,458
Speaker 1: What can you do about it course Pete who has a good history of winning the game?

456
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:03,566
Speaker 1: Ended up losing and I note that this was one of the few times he deviated from his classic strategy of fill one corner of The board with squares.

457
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:04,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is all.

458
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,720
Speaker 0: that's pretty much the default strategy.

459
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,880
Speaker 0: You know in order to win you have to beat that and in order to lose you got to do worse than that.

460
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,379
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like the guaranteed average.

461
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:21,303
Speaker 0: You know Strategy and then if you can pull off a couple great moves on top of that like some big external conflicts Maybe a monument.

462
00:30:21,725 --> 00:30:24,916
Speaker 0: You're got a good chance of winning the game with that one man.

463
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:25,699
Speaker 1: That's a good game.

464
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,087
Speaker 1: Oh, I want to talk about it again sometime.

465
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:31,037
Speaker 1: But if you guys buy Tiger's and Euphrates, right?

466
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:32,506
Speaker 1: It's Great.

467
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,900
Speaker 1: But anyway, we're not talking about that tonight.

468
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you go to board game geek calm, the number one game is Puerto Rico.

469
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,730
Speaker 0: All right, the number two game is Tiger's and Euphrates.

470
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:41,191
Speaker 0: All right.

471
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,999
Speaker 0: The number four game is Kayla's.

472
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,681
Speaker 1: now These are.

473
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:54,020
Speaker 0: I would say that these are my number one two and four games the number three game a game that We haven't played ever until I bought it just a week or two ago.

474
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,683
Speaker 0: Think about that.

475
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:56,571
Speaker 0: the number one two and four games.

476
00:30:56,611 --> 00:30:58,699
Speaker 0: we bought him and we played him a whole lot.

477
00:30:59,222 --> 00:31:00,628
Speaker 0: Number three game didn't play.

478
00:31:00,648 --> 00:31:01,733
Speaker 0: I played it two or three.

479
00:31:01,813 --> 00:31:02,979
Speaker 0: We played it three times now, right?

480
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:05,288
Speaker 1: Yep I've won two of those three.

481
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:12,580
Speaker 0: just gonna get number three game I've played three times in my life and I just bought it recently is called power grade.

482
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:16,071
Speaker 1: We had heard about power grid often for many people.

483
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:16,512
Speaker 1: Yep.

484
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:20,211
Speaker 1: We'd always seen it wanted it thought about it Just never ended up getting it.

485
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,400
Speaker 0: and I to this day I've seen it at all kinds of conventions and it's just one of those.

486
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,599
Speaker 0: You know, we can only get so many games at once and it was just we never chose to get it.

487
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:29,322
Speaker 1: I don't know.

488
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:30,588
Speaker 1: Why not course?

489
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:32,194
Speaker 0: now we've basically wasn't.

490
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:33,178
Speaker 0: there wasn't a reason.

491
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:33,660
Speaker 0: why not?

492
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,718
Speaker 0: It was just there never was a reason to get it.

493
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:44,387
Speaker 1: But now I mean we're looking at the top 10 on board game geek and we realized that we love and own or have at least Played pretty much all of them.

494
00:31:44,768 --> 00:31:45,571
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need to get.

495
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:47,678
Speaker 1: we own Florence almost all of them.

496
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:51,850
Speaker 0: Yep So power grid the first thing about power grid.

497
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 0: is that the art on the box and the pieces and the cards?

498
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,489
Speaker 0: I like it a lot.

499
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,599
Speaker 0: It's really cool.

500
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,762
Speaker 1: There's a I don't know what it is Like.

501
00:31:59,802 --> 00:32:03,820
Speaker 1: the theme is very unified kind of like targets and your freighters where the theme is not important.

502
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:09,520
Speaker 1: The theme has nothing to do with the game proper other than you know, adding flavor and making it make sense more.

503
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,112
Speaker 1: But it really feels good.

504
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:13,425
Speaker 0: I Like the way the cards look.

505
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:15,152
Speaker 0: I like the way the power plants are drawn.

506
00:32:15,232 --> 00:32:17,200
Speaker 0: I like the like all the wooden cubes.

507
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,384
Speaker 0: I like the box.

508
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,648
Speaker 0: It's just awesome.

509
00:32:19,749 --> 00:32:21,635
Speaker 1: I like the fact that two of the power plants.

510
00:32:21,655 --> 00:32:23,060
Speaker 1: There's two wind power plants, right?

511
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,547
Speaker 1: They both produce the same amount of power.

512
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:29,260
Speaker 1: one of them just costs somewhat significantly more money.

513
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:37,767
Speaker 1: it's just and the only difference in the art between the two is that the more expensive one has one more tiny little wind turbine in The background.

514
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:38,658
Speaker 1: that doesn't do anything.

515
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:44,158
Speaker 0: So the next thing you notice about this game is the rule book.

516
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:50,135
Speaker 0: now I read the rule book before playing the game cuz usually when I get a new board game I just read the rules and I look at all the pieces.

517
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:53,719
Speaker 0: and you know I may read the rules two or three times before we actually play.

518
00:32:53,739 --> 00:33:01,613
Speaker 0: and The rules at least the English rules in the Rio Grande version of power grid Which I assume is the version you're gonna get if you buy it like we tell you to.

519
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:05,423
Speaker 0: they're written Really poorly.

520
00:33:05,744 --> 00:33:10,940
Speaker 1: They're not the worst rules I've ever read, but they're really really bad and it acts technically.

521
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:13,020
Speaker 1: A lot of the game is actually kind of ambiguous.

522
00:33:13,483 --> 00:33:16,340
Speaker 1: The only reason we know what to do is because we just you make assumptions.

523
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:23,300
Speaker 0: Yes, and there's a lot of things the game doesn't explicitly say but you're safe and reasonable assumption.

524
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:30,000
Speaker 0: It is correct 99% of the time, but I can't have a rule book that leaves me assuming the rules.

525
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,522
Speaker 0: That's just.

526
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:31,446
Speaker 0: that doesn't work for me.

527
00:33:31,486 --> 00:33:33,616
Speaker 0: We need to have every rule written down now.

528
00:33:33,656 --> 00:33:48,796
Speaker 0: granted, you know You can take this argument to the extreme and say well Do you need the rules to say take your thumb and forefinger and clasp the wooden cube with enough force so that the Friction will prevent it from falling out of your hands when you elevate your?

529
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:49,599
Speaker 0: you don't need that.

530
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:58,760
Speaker 0: But you do need to have enough rules so that someone who knows the English language and knows you know What has a big enough vocabulary?

531
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,733
Speaker 0: Will not have any questions at least read the rules at least.

532
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:07,304
Speaker 1: it's not like to call which was okay but they had fluff.

533
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:13,665
Speaker 1: they had extra information in the rules that had no bearing on the game and Wasn't even historical or interesting.

534
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,168
Speaker 1: like you can move guys around.

535
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:19,120
Speaker 1: So in the rules, it says the guys move via secret tunnels.

536
00:34:20,262 --> 00:34:20,503
Speaker 1: Great.

537
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:21,328
Speaker 1: I needed to know that.

538
00:34:21,388 --> 00:34:27,036
Speaker 0: a teleport secret tunnel Secret tunnel, there are no actual secret tunnels in Tikal.

539
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:30,656
Speaker 1: They just teleport Yeah, but they tell you the secret tunnels for no good.

540
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:37,360
Speaker 0: Never mind Yes, so once you get past that the next problem in power grid see good art bad rules.

541
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:49,540
Speaker 0: The other thing is that once you do understand all the rules, even if you understand them perfectly Some of the rules are kind of arbitrary Like there's just a table on the back of the instruction book that says you have this number of players.

542
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,989
Speaker 0: Is this the circumstance in the current game?

543
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,000
Speaker 0: Well, this is how many new resources come into play and there's a table.

544
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:56,266
Speaker 0: I don't like tables.

545
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:57,351
Speaker 0: tables are no good.

546
00:34:57,833 --> 00:34:58,416
Speaker 0: It's basic.

547
00:34:58,537 --> 00:35:02,523
Speaker 0: Yeah There's other arbitrary rules too like you know.

548
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:10,979
Speaker 0: if this happens and this happens then remove a card from the game and put it here and put a card there and It's sort of annoying a little bit.

549
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:23,267
Speaker 1: Your best bet is to play this game at a con or somewhere where someone else at least one person knows the rules inside and out and has already played so they can teach you how to play and then play the first game with You and then you'll be you'll be set.

550
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:25,640
Speaker 0: you'll be set because people who know how to play the game know how to play.

551
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:30,600
Speaker 0: Now once you get beyond those two things though power grid is awesome.

552
00:35:31,102 --> 00:35:38,680
Speaker 0: I don't know how they pulled it off where all these arbitrary rules actually work really well But all these arbitrary confusing rules work really well.

553
00:35:39,181 --> 00:35:44,580
Speaker 1: I think what I really like about the game is that it has the wooden cube game feel because there's different kinds of board games.

554
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,880
Speaker 1: So there's the tile lane games the exploration games, whatever but the cube games the wooden cube games.

555
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:59,441
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of wooden cubes and you manipulate them around the board Always have this kind of really hardcore feel to them and I always liked him a lot like el grande is a good example of That.

556
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:18,600
Speaker 1: yep, and while this isn't really a wooden cube game I feel the same feeling playing it that I feel playing a wooden cube game like it gives me that feeling of Beating my brain against a difficult and somewhat unsolvable math problem where I know that I can't figure out the perfect optimal move And I have to make a decision and a compromise.

557
00:36:18,841 --> 00:36:20,827
Speaker 0: What power grid does I think is?

558
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,960
Speaker 0: there are many different tight, you know general genres of German board game.

559
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,224
Speaker 0: You know is the bidding game.

560
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:29,112
Speaker 0: There's the territory at you know game.

561
00:36:29,132 --> 00:36:31,679
Speaker 0: There's the tile laying game and stuff like that.

562
00:36:32,663 --> 00:36:44,560
Speaker 0: power grid is a bidding game a Economics management game and a Territory graph sort of manipulation game all in one.

563
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,440
Speaker 0: It's like three separate games all at once that all intertwine.

564
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,446
Speaker 1: yep, I mean basically really cool.

565
00:36:50,907 --> 00:36:59,800
Speaker 1: you want to generate power for houses that you put on the board and you build houses on the Board and you can make connections through the nodes and different connections cost different amounts of money.

566
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:12,480
Speaker 1: so you have to deal with all that and You power these with power plants that you bid on and each power plant Requires a different kind of fuel and a different amount of a different kind of fuel and powers different amounts of houses.

567
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:22,960
Speaker 0: More expensive power plants can are either more efficient meaning they make more electricity for less resources or They make more electricity for more resources.

568
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,787
Speaker 0: It kind of goes in a cycle like first there'll be a power plant that makes like two Electricity for three coal.

569
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:31,500
Speaker 0: then there'll be one that makes two electricity for two coal.

570
00:37:31,902 --> 00:37:40,714
Speaker 0: then there'll be one that makes three electricity for three coal and you know, Then there'll be three electricity for two coal and four electricity for three coal and so on and so on and so on.

571
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:43,264
Speaker 1: and so now the market dynamics are really interesting.

572
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:48,762
Speaker 1: I mean say I buy coal gets more and more out there.

573
00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:51,863
Speaker 1: there's more coal coming out throughout the game until the end when it starts to dry up.

574
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:54,353
Speaker 1: so by the mid game there's a ton of coal coming out.

575
00:37:55,076 --> 00:38:01,966
Speaker 1: but if three different players all have a bunch of coal power plants suddenly coal starts becoming really expensive and really rare.

576
00:38:01,986 --> 00:38:08,986
Speaker 0: yeah cuz the same number of three people buying them.

577
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:19,409
Speaker 0: if you don't get to buy them first and other people buy them first then you're gonna have to buy really expensive coal or not buy coal and it's pretty cool.

578
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:31,533
Speaker 1: so a lot of the game is trying to stay ahead of the curve figuring out what other people have and what other people want and trying to always put yourself in the market where you can buy what you need to run your power plants for the least money.

579
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,122
Speaker 0: yeah basically the way the game goes.

580
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:42,605
Speaker 0: in summary cuz I'm not gonna go through all the crazy rules God is that on your turn someone we auction off power plants and at most you can buy one power plant per turn.

581
00:38:42,827 --> 00:38:43,048
Speaker 0: right?

582
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:46,326
Speaker 0: so everyone buys a power plant and you there's a really good one out there.

583
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:49,907
Speaker 0: everyone's gonna fight over it and if there's a crappy one no one will buy it.

584
00:38:50,068 --> 00:39:09,380
Speaker 1: and God I love the bidding just because the way we play like they'll be a power plant that comes out in the minimum bids 40 and Scott and I go back and forth and it'll be like 40 41 42 100 101 300 300 and -.

585
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,611
Speaker 1: yeah for some reason I really enjoy that.

586
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:17,179
Speaker 0: yeah it's a pretty fun bidding and you're trying to get better power plants you know and that's pretty much it.

587
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:35,810
Speaker 0: having better power plants is super important but at the same time you don't want to spend too much because right after you buy power plants you have to buy resources to power those power plants and basically everyone takes one turn and the worst whoever's in last place goes first and they get to buy as many resources they can as they can.

588
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,067
Speaker 0: hold they they don't have to buy that many but they can.

589
00:39:39,107 --> 00:39:44,538
Speaker 0: they could buy as many or as little as they want up to the amount they can hold in their storage areas which are your power plants.

590
00:39:44,558 --> 00:39:47,795
Speaker 0: and then the next person buys and the next person buys.

591
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:52,698
Speaker 0: next person buys until everyone had a turn buying resources and basically each turn.

592
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:59,323
Speaker 0: at the end of the turn more resources come out and then after we buy power plants everyone buys all the resources.

593
00:40:00,046 --> 00:40:01,311
Speaker 0: and that's it now.

594
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:08,767
Speaker 0: when more resources come out they get cheaper because there's more out there and when people buy them they get more expensive because there's less out there.

595
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:10,458
Speaker 0: yep supply and demand going.

596
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:13,913
Speaker 1: there's four kinds of resources coal oil trash and uranium.

597
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:23,139
Speaker 1: yep and like uranium starts out really expensive and gets cheaper as time goes on and trash gets cheaper as time goes on and oil gets slightly cheaper and coal gets more expensive.

598
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,867
Speaker 1: and there's all these sorts of dynamics.

599
00:40:25,068 --> 00:40:36,798
Speaker 0: yep it depends a whole lot but they're also power plants like mostly wind solar and fusion at the end that give you electricity without using any resources and they're pretty good.

600
00:40:36,858 --> 00:40:49,586
Speaker 0: they're really good but at the same time they also cost a lot more than power plants that use resources and they're also not capable of producing as much electricity total like the fusion.

601
00:40:49,626 --> 00:40:51,754
Speaker 0: I think what makes five or six right?

602
00:40:51,895 --> 00:40:55,307
Speaker 0: yeah and there's a trash one that makes seven which is a big deal.

603
00:40:56,591 --> 00:41:02,863
Speaker 0: after everyone buys resources you put houses on the map and I'm gonna go through all the details of putting houses on the map.

604
00:41:02,904 --> 00:41:05,717
Speaker 0: but basically it costs money to put houses on the map.

605
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:06,561
Speaker 0: you cannot.

606
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:13,957
Speaker 0: you're trying to get as many houses on the map as you can because let's say I have three power plants that make a total of ten electricity.

607
00:41:14,459 --> 00:41:20,307
Speaker 0: if I only have nine houses that means I can only power nine houses even though it would normally be able to power ten.

608
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:25,232
Speaker 1: yes a power plant that powers three powers three no matter what if you power even if you only have one house.

609
00:41:25,453 --> 00:41:25,654
Speaker 1: yep.

610
00:41:26,176 --> 00:41:34,274
Speaker 0: so if you want to get you know the maximum you know bang for your buck you want to have the same number of houses as you can power.

611
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:34,876
Speaker 0: that way.

612
00:41:34,896 --> 00:41:36,242
Speaker 0: you didn't buy extra houses.

613
00:41:36,282 --> 00:41:37,287
Speaker 0: you can't power.

614
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,082
Speaker 1: granted I'll note that I've won two of the three times we played.

615
00:41:40,384 --> 00:41:41,813
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I didn't do that at all.

616
00:41:41,853 --> 00:41:42,638
Speaker 0: I'm just saying getting.

617
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,930
Speaker 0: that's the way to get the most bang for your buck not the way to win.

618
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:52,613
Speaker 0: yeah and you don't want to have more power plants than you have houses because then you're making all this electricity you're not using anyway.

619
00:41:52,653 --> 00:42:05,615
Speaker 1: suffice to say the game is a race to the finish of who builds you like once someone builds a certain number of houses then the game is going to end and then at that point whoever powers the most houses wins not whoever has the most house.

620
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:06,821
Speaker 1: yeah for example the gate.

621
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,611
Speaker 1: I don't think we need to go into the details of that.

622
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:09,556
Speaker 1: no no no at all.

623
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,829
Speaker 0: but I'm saying there was an awesome game.

624
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,096
Speaker 0: we played the second game.

625
00:42:13,116 --> 00:42:21,423
Speaker 0: we played where we thought the game was gonna end in two turns and I realized wait a minute Alex didn't.

626
00:42:21,584 --> 00:42:26,050
Speaker 1: Alex did one thing so he wasn't gonna power all his stuff this turn to save up money to bust out next turn.

627
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,603
Speaker 0: he purposefully thought the game was gonna end in two turns.

628
00:42:28,644 --> 00:42:31,054
Speaker 0: he purposefully did not buy resources.

629
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:34,127
Speaker 0: that way he could buy a whole bunch on the last turn and win.

630
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:35,834
Speaker 0: rim ended the game.

631
00:42:36,295 --> 00:42:38,083
Speaker 0: that turn instead of the next turn.

632
00:42:38,585 --> 00:42:45,456
Speaker 0: Alex is unable to power because he didn't buy resources and he's super lost even though he was I guess technically ahead of me.

633
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:52,222
Speaker 1: I had fewer houses than anyone but I could power more of them at that one instant where I ended the game.

634
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:52,866
Speaker 1: it was awesome.

635
00:42:53,127 --> 00:42:54,132
Speaker 0: yeah that's a good move.

636
00:42:54,675 --> 00:42:55,439
Speaker 1: I want interest.

637
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:58,742
Speaker 1: one thing I really like about the game is that like Scott said the last player goes first.

638
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:01,772
Speaker 1: this game is the opposite of age of steam.

639
00:43:02,274 --> 00:43:10,700
Speaker 1: the catch-up mechanics are very well crafted and you can't lose the game based on a bad decision early on.

640
00:43:11,061 --> 00:43:18,337
Speaker 1: you can't have a bad time of it but you're always going to be progressing and if you screw up and no one else screws up you're still gonna lose.

641
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:25,388
Speaker 1: but in general every round you reset the turn order and whoever's doing the worst gets a little bit of a boost every round.

642
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:27,656
Speaker 0: yep and this is pretty.

643
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:44,715
Speaker 0: it's actually really well balanced even though it's kind of arbitrary and you know the rules are kind of a. but I guess the fact that it's arbitrary it was coldly calculated to be exactly perfect where if you just decide to suck on purpose and stay last you're not gonna get enough of a boost to help you beat everyone.

644
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,023
Speaker 0: that's not gonna have I don't know.

645
00:43:46,063 --> 00:43:49,740
Speaker 1: I think you will because I often would keep myself in last place for a long time.

646
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,628
Speaker 0: but it's you can win.

647
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:53,677
Speaker 0: you're not precluded from winning.

648
00:43:53,717 --> 00:43:57,900
Speaker 0: it's not like oh I'm in last I can't catch up but you're not guaranteed to win by staying in last.

649
00:43:58,482 --> 00:43:58,964
Speaker 1: it's not this.

650
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:01,434
Speaker 0: aha by sucking I can win.

651
00:44:01,454 --> 00:44:06,160
Speaker 1: I think my point was more that kind of like a choir where you want to shoot for second place to actually win the game.

652
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:08,571
Speaker 1: yep in this game it's already.

653
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:15,398
Speaker 1: it's even like when you play initial D with the rubber band effect on you can advance players use the rubber band.

654
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:20,880
Speaker 1: they use the catch-up mechanism on purpose in order to get an advantage over other players.

655
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:34,310
Speaker 0: yes for example if I have the best power plants on the board right they're super efficient and I have a lot of money it might be and often is opportunistic to not build any houses in a turn.

656
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:41,661
Speaker 0: everyone else will build houses maybe and thus I will go last even though I'm probably in the most powerful position in the game.

657
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:56,453
Speaker 0: thus next turn I combine that boost of going first and buying resources first along with my super efficient power plants and my current fistful of dollars and I take a double jump ahead and now way ahead.

658
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:59,184
Speaker 0: beat that you can use it pretty smartly.

659
00:44:59,627 --> 00:45:00,170
Speaker 1: I mean it's just.

660
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,296
Speaker 1: it's a fantastic game.

661
00:45:01,497 --> 00:45:04,831
Speaker 1: I think we're eventually gonna get sick of it but not anytime soon.

662
00:45:05,434 --> 00:45:14,332
Speaker 0: yeah I mean this game definitely does feel like a game that could be figured out to a point where you just be like yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's so.

663
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:16,177
Speaker 0: there's so much to it.

664
00:45:16,277 --> 00:45:24,785
Speaker 0: I mean I'd probably first have to figure out you know the houses optimization which I think I'm getting close to that and then you got to figure out the resource buying optimization.

665
00:45:24,826 --> 00:45:25,388
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

666
00:45:25,991 --> 00:45:31,011
Speaker 0: it's not any harder to solve than any other game but I have to solve three or four games.

667
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:36,035
Speaker 1: well also because a lot of people make alternate maps for it and they all work fine.

668
00:45:36,075 --> 00:45:38,006
Speaker 1: the game just deals with it because it's a market.

669
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:38,468
Speaker 1: yeah.

670
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:47,454
Speaker 1: so whatever you modify the game to do by changing power plants or adding power plants or changing maps the game's still gonna work because the market evens everything out.

671
00:45:47,836 --> 00:45:51,824
Speaker 1: so the moment we solve the game all we have to do is add a bunch of power plants and change the rules a little bit.

672
00:45:51,844 --> 00:45:53,857
Speaker 0: I do really think I do think that's very cool.

673
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:58,360
Speaker 0: is that the the designer of this game Friedman fries who's a cool German guy with green hair.

674
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,006
Speaker 0: he's like all punk awesomeness.

675
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:08,136
Speaker 0: he he said that he designed the original map based on realistic Germany or at least what he thought.

676
00:46:08,176 --> 00:46:12,521
Speaker 1: you know general German geography and so didn't he say that he didn't take game balance into account at all.

677
00:46:12,922 --> 00:46:17,459
Speaker 0: pretty much and the map works just fine and the map pretty much will.

678
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:25,834
Speaker 0: you could just make any random map for this game and it'll most likely just work because everyone is playing on the exact same map.

679
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:27,561
Speaker 0: it's a perfectly even playing field.

680
00:46:28,063 --> 00:46:35,190
Speaker 0: so if the map could just be like you know completely random and the game would probably work just fine.

681
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,122
Speaker 1: now this game is no Tigers and Euphrates it's not the best.

682
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:38,925
Speaker 0: no it's late.

683
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:46,456
Speaker 1: however if you like a hard-hitting hardcore German board gaming experience this game is right up your alley.

684
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:55,050
Speaker 0: if you like power plants electricity and cool graphics and playing with little wooden coals and oil barrels and uraniums is also a good game.

685
00:46:55,993 --> 00:46:58,263
Speaker 1: and on that note I kind of want to fry some rice.

686
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,671
Speaker 1: so I think we're done you're done.

687
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:00,053
Speaker 0: those are.

688
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,394
Speaker 1: that was pretty quick not really we've gone on long enough I think all right.

689
00:47:03,596 --> 00:47:06,482
Speaker 1: plus we've been kind of filling up the lips in with a lot of long episodes lately.

690
00:47:06,743 --> 00:47:15,720
