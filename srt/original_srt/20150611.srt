4
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:27,618
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,086

00:00:34,106 --> 00:00:36,059
Speaker 1: your medical problems is also as disgusting.

7
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, the saddest part about the blisters is they like they were better.

8
00:00:38,899 --> 00:00:42,300
Speaker 1: now You're talking you're gonna talk about him, but now you are actually talking about.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,936
Speaker 1: So when I was a kid, you're not actually gonna talk about them.

10
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:45,599
Speaker 1: pass by it.

11
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:47,820
Speaker 0: So when you were a kid, I won't talk about the blisters anymore.

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:56,623
Speaker 0: But when you were a kid and you like cut yourself or something your mom just had like bactein or peroxide Boring.

13
00:00:56,663 --> 00:00:57,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what about?

14
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,820
Speaker 0: for you don't use Neosporin for the clean and disinfect phase of an injury?

15
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:09,053
Speaker 1: I usually just pet a band-aid squirted Neosporin on it and put it right on there didn't even like wash the wound Maybe with some water not some like bactein or something.

16
00:01:09,776 --> 00:01:10,820
Speaker 0: No, okay.

17
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:23,620
Speaker 0: anyway Way back when I cut the tip of my finger off and had to get a reattached I had you know that sad old story where the hospital sucked and wouldn't treat me and after four hours There's an episode of geek nights with that story.

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,007
Speaker 1: So we don't need to tell that any other.

19
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:29,814
Speaker 0: so the next day when I went into a clinic and I was like Yeah, I cut my fucking finger off in the hospital wouldn't help me.

20
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:33,148
Speaker 0: and the guy was like, okay Well, I'll attach it you like fixed it.

21
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,860
Speaker 0: But first he's like that shit's probably infected as fuck.

22
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:41,614
Speaker 0: So he took my hand and he told me put my finger like just totally in.

23
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,360
Speaker 1: this is this is gonna hurt like a mother.

24
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,786
Speaker 1: Fuck big bowl of iodine.

25
00:01:44,926 --> 00:01:46,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he was like just keep it in there.

26
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,340
Speaker 0: I'll be back in like ten minutes.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,412
Speaker 0: So when I injured myself in the way, I won't discuss any further.

28
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:58,690
Speaker 0: I went to clean out my wounds and Because I don't have a mom who lives with me.

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,719
Speaker 0: I literally didn't own anything.

30
00:02:02,185 --> 00:02:04,560
Speaker 1: Well, but he was there to kiss your boo-boo exactly.

31
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:10,320
Speaker 0: So I ordered on Amazon a giant jug of betadine for like five bucks.

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,632
Speaker 1: You just buy it at the drugstore around the corner.

33
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:14,280
Speaker 0: There's no drugstore around the corner.

34
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:22,205
Speaker 0: Oh, I live somewhere with the drugstore on the and even then actually the Duane Reade by my office does not carry Betadine or anything good.

35
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,655
Speaker 0: they carry just iodine which isn't really the greatest thing to use.

36
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,827
Speaker 0: they carry peroxide which is Indicated you shouldn't use it.

37
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:29,369
Speaker 0: That's not.

38
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:32,100
Speaker 0: the internet says you should not use peroxide on wounds.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,593
Speaker 0: That is that is garbage advice from whoever told you to use it.

40
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:39,085
Speaker 0: We figured out like 15 or 20 years ago.

41
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,510
Speaker 0: the peroxide does more harm than good.

42
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:41,553
Speaker 1: Okay.

43
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:45,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, like for real Don't use peroxide.

44
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:45,804
Speaker 0: Okay.

45
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:47,268
Speaker 0: Why did you think you could use peroxide?

46
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,010
Speaker 0: Who told you that?

47
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:48,953
Speaker 1: the whole internet?

48
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,878
Speaker 0: Well, they're wrong.

49
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:51,299

58
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:26,817
Speaker 0: relaunched gig nights on iTunes after we Were delisted for a little while because of like our feed had some issues we had to fix once it got back up, uh I noticed that there's a bunch of reviews of geek nights from like 2005 Mm-hmm, and we had like five stars and most of the reviews.

59
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:27,480
Speaker 0: There's a lot of them.

60
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,219
Speaker 0: We're like, yeah, this is a great show.

61
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:34,455
Speaker 0: A lot of those people are still listeners or at least are still like hanging out in the forum even though they don't listen anymore, but the fuck.

62
00:03:34,737 --> 00:03:46,635
Speaker 0: but there was a whole bunch of negative reviews that all came in around the same time and They all were from different usernames, but they all complained about the same three things in a different order.

63
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:47,437
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:58,999
Speaker 0: and Then I started googling around for like reviews of geek nights and there was an era of a few months where a ton of people Who may or may not have all been the same person?

65
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:05,078
Speaker 0: We're giving geek nights negative reviews and writing these really long rants about how shitty we are.

66
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:06,946
Speaker 0: Anywhere they could do this.

67
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:08,272
Speaker 1: We finally got a hater.

68
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:09,055
Speaker 0: All right.

69
00:04:09,256 --> 00:04:16,822
Speaker 0: I think it's one hater I couldn't tell but it was weird because what they complained about was these guys act like they know about everything But they don't.

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,748
Speaker 1: we don't we didn't?

77
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:40,767
Speaker 0: I wish They wouldn't use such like vile language.

Speaker 0: Okay, but they all complained in such a way.

82
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:09,180
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure one motherfucker got mad at us for something back in 2006 and spent like a month Writing these reviews all over the internet trying desperately to drown out our five stars down to know six.

83
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,368

00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:06,979
Speaker 0: it's your mom My mom would hang out in the lounge.

107
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:10,870
Speaker 1: So there's a big fiasco going down on reddit.

108
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:14,300
Speaker 1: so much a fiasco that even my co-workers was talking about it on slack today.

109
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,620
Speaker 0: It's amazing in the random channel because normal people who aren't internet at all will never know this happens.

110
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:26,759
Speaker 0: No or care smart people would see it as oh wow reddit did a smart thing.

111
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:31,898
Speaker 0: Good job Mm-hmm, but yet this became the biggest internet shitstorm because of that guy, right?

112
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:32,300
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

113
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,099
Speaker 1: So here's the explain is what's going down?

114
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:42,685
Speaker 1: so reddit is a website that is where you post links or just write text and then Upvote and downvote things.

115
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:46,297
Speaker 1: but things sort of get automatically lower scores as time goes on.

116
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,220
Speaker 1: so newer thing.

117
00:06:47,723 --> 00:06:51,286
Speaker 1: So in order for something to be highly ranked and you know Very prominent on the site.

118
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,220
Speaker 1: It has to be new and hot with lots of votes.

119
00:06:55,161 --> 00:07:03,712
Speaker 1: Also reddit does the interesting thing of this subreddits so you can actually go to reddit and if you make an account or go to The home page without being logged in and or fresh new account.

120
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,560
Speaker 1: You only see certain things.

121
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:12,580
Speaker 1: There is actually way more stuff That's completely hidden from you and you might not even know about and I didn't even know about until using reddit for a while.

122
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:16,291
Speaker 0: I mean that's the only good part of reddit like the Rangers subreddit, right?

123
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:26,881
Speaker 1: Is every single post is actually under a subreddit which is basically a forum that somebody a human being that's not a reddit employee created and Curates.

124
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:27,864
Speaker 1: so you can go.

125
00:07:28,145 --> 00:07:31,055
Speaker 1: you can go to reddit and be like make new subreddit.

126
00:07:31,436 --> 00:07:32,340
Speaker 1: geek nights haters.

127
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,173
Speaker 1: Geek nights exist because I made it but geek nights haters doesn't.

128
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:35,936
Speaker 1: so you can make that.

129
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:36,680
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it doesn't.

130
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,666
Speaker 1: You could make.

131
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:38,780
Speaker 0: I don't know how to get nice right it.

132
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,778
Speaker 0: I should go post some stuff in it.

133
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:40,161
Speaker 0: You

134
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:56,818
Speaker 1: can go make a geek nights haters subreddit and then you know People could subscribe to it in which case any posts in it would show up on their home reddit home pages when they're logged in Whatnot right, so there's subreddits for every fucking thing no matter how specific your interest is, right?

135
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,108
Speaker 1: There's one for bicycling that I subscribe to.

136
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,297
Speaker 1: there's one specific to New York City bicycling.

137
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:04,200
Speaker 1: It's NYC bike.

138
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:06,849
Speaker 1: It's only things about New York City bicycling.

139
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,718
Speaker 1: Usually cops are giving out tickets at this intersection.

140
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,315
Speaker 1: today construction on this bridge Which how do I get to this place like really useful stuff?

141
00:08:16,536 --> 00:08:17,560
Speaker 1: Yeah anyway.

142
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:25,532
Speaker 1: So the reddit, you know has been very very Permissive in what kinds of content it allows.

143
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,547
Speaker 0: I mean like they let the red pill exists Which is literally just like.

144
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:33,059
Speaker 0: how do we remove women from society, right?

145
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,119
Speaker 1: It used to be that, you know, the only rule was like no child porn or whatever, right?

146
00:08:39,142 --> 00:08:42,813
Speaker 1: But there's subreddits out there where there's like horrible horrible stuff.

147
00:08:42,854 --> 00:08:44,640
Speaker 1: Was it space something space dicks?

148
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:52,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know off like rotten.com times a million is out there somewhere right is porn?

00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker 1: anything you could imagine is there but also perfectly normal stuff like NYC bike, right?

151
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,707
Speaker 1: it's just about biking in New York City.

152
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:10,857
Speaker 1: if you subscribe to only subreddits such as New York City bike or your favorite sports team or Your favorite band or your favorite video game, right?

153
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:16,356
Speaker 1: Then you're only gonna see stuff about that and you're not gonna see the general reddit community.

154
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,506
Speaker 1: and that is the right way to Use reddit right.

155
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:39,700
Speaker 1: but in the general reddit community There's mad dramas because the new CEO of reddit and there's some new policies, which is they're going to crack down not on Content that is offensive but against any communities that are Actually harassing and attacking people.

156
00:09:40,342 --> 00:09:55,000
Speaker 1: Right, so they found a few subreddits and a few users that were literally harassing You know and you know doing direct, you know threats and attacks against people and they destroyed those subreddits.

157
00:09:56,302 --> 00:10:01,320
Speaker 1: And they you know hell-banned which is you know, you don't you beer bad, but you don't know it.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,468
Speaker 0: so there's a side to some really bad users.

159
00:10:03,508 --> 00:10:18,956
Speaker 0: someone made a Wikipedia article on hell band and then The reddit butthurt brigade went and edited the article to try to make it seem like there are legal Implications that doing that kind of shadow ban is actually illegal in a violation of some federal law.

160
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,248
Speaker 1: It's reddit's website Yeah, the website.

161
00:10:22,469 --> 00:10:24,820
Speaker 1: they can do whatever the fuck they want on their own way.

162
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:27,471
Speaker 0: I went actually for the first time in years.

163
00:10:27,512 --> 00:10:29,420
Speaker 0: I edited Wikipedia and I just deleted all that shit.

164
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,892
Speaker 0: I made a comment like these shit posters are shitting all over Wikipedia.

165
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:35,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it looks like it's still good.

166
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:41,160
Speaker 1: So anyway, anyway, so this created a shitstorm amongst the shitheads.

167
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:56,532
Speaker 1: If the people who are you know upset and they're like, it's as though a million shitheads With a joke you tweet it you then can't say the joke out loud.

168
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:57,335
Speaker 0: I don't think.

169
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,160
Speaker 0: later subscribe to me on Twitter.

Speaker 1: Not a joke is bad from Trigon.

172

Speaker 1: I mean if I go and make a tweet that's like chickens cross the road How to get the other side and then later on I go here him My chicken cross the road.

173
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:13,815
Speaker 0: It's like that'd be a good idea.

174
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:14,760
Speaker 0: I call you on Twitter.

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,500
Speaker 1: You should follow me and unfollow him because he's just tweeting stupid jokes that he already said and also he tweeted the joke.

177
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:29,240
Speaker 1: It's a really long conversations with people that don't belong on Twitter.

178
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,880
Speaker 1: That's gonna fill your tweet feed up like ding ding ding ding.

179
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,627
Speaker 1: Well behaved Twitter's.

180
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:41,240
Speaker 0: you will only see that if you subscribe to both me and the person I'm arguing with which is usually Gerald.

181
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,165
Speaker 0: We don't argue though lately.

182
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,252
Speaker 0: It's all just like hey, I'm right.

183
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:46,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are right.

184
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,560
Speaker 1: tweets too much anyway a lot.

185
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:48,626
Speaker 0: I've only tweeted 30,000 times.

186
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:49,512
Speaker 0: That's too many times.

187
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:54,031
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, I got like a lot of followers.

188
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:55,940
Speaker 1: big shitstorm going on in the reddit.

189
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,530
Speaker 1: These people clearly have not read the XKCD comic that tells you.

190
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:07,340
Speaker 1: but freedom of speech is only mean something if the government is Gonna arrest you for saying something right reddit can do whatever the fuck they want on their website.

191
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,568
Speaker 1: You can't do a goddamn thing about it because it's not your website.

192
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:23,924
Speaker 0: What's hilarious, but also sad is that The the shitheads are such a quantity of people that their mass exodus from reddit actually took down like at least two Reddit clone sites.

193
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:25,008
Speaker 0: with the traffic there.

194
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:26,552
Speaker 0: are that many of these people.

195
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:27,575
Speaker 1: Yep, probably.

196
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,039
Speaker 0: I don't know what like.

197
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:44,921
Speaker 0: I Don't know what the projected future of shit header II is at this point because as much as I've always liked to believe that These people are a vocal minority the sheer number and quantity of them They're

198
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:54,140
Speaker 1: a minority, but they are still a high quantity and also the quantity of them on the internet Proportional is much higher than their proportional number in general society.

199
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,053
Speaker 0: So you say that but I have two pieces of information that might.

200
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,739
Speaker 0: I don't know if they counted or not one.

201
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:05,878
Speaker 0: The more local the news website is the worse that becomes.

202
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:06,400
Speaker 1: that's true.

203
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:17,480
Speaker 0: You look at like the newspaper who are shitty have small worlds and small world outlooks But it is every small world filled with enough of these people to where they're actually a big percentage of society.

204
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:19,727
Speaker 1: Well, no because in that small world.

205
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:25,686
Speaker 1: there are people with large world outlooks right their personal world is large Even though they like like.

206
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,620
Speaker 1: for example, I live in a particular area of Astoria, right?

207
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,974
Speaker 1: My apartment building could be seen as a small world But I have my my life my world the world of me is large.

208
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:38,018
Speaker 1: It is internet large.

209
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:38,660
Speaker 1: It is pecs.

210
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:39,734
Speaker 1: You know, it's it's big.

211
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:49,589
Speaker 1: But let's say there was an old lady living in my apartment building and she is living in this same small World that I am also in a part of.

212
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,060
Speaker 1: but her world outlook is small.

213
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,520
Speaker 1: The apartment building is like the thing she is focusing on in her mind, you know her.

214
00:13:56,782 --> 00:13:58,860
Speaker 1: She's only seeing a very small part of the world.

215
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,695
Speaker 1: She doesn't have a global thought or a global mind and that is why Such a person who doesn't exist did my apartment buildings and I really have old people in it.

216
00:14:06,735 --> 00:14:13,280
Speaker 1: But yeah, right It's got a person would be a shitty person right a kind of person, you know.

217
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,486
Speaker 1: So there's some small town.

218
00:14:14,506 --> 00:14:17,100
Speaker 1: are all the people living in that small town shitty?

219
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:20,460
Speaker 1: No There's a lot of people living in the small town or just fine people.

220
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:26,140
Speaker 1: But someone who is in that small town and cares about that small town to where that's the thing that they're focusing on.

221
00:14:26,521 --> 00:14:27,685
Speaker 1: That's the thing that they think about.

222
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:32,500
Speaker 1: that occupies their mind is a small minded person who is a shithead.

223
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:36,379
Speaker 1: So here's my problem and that's the person who's gonna go to the small town.

224
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:54,140
Speaker 0: If you live in a small town in a small world Then if you go to any small media you encounter this stuff all the time, but if you live a global life This stuff is everywhere and you encounter it across all those places.

225
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 0: Regardless no matter what level you live at the percentage of those people seems to be constant.

226
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:02,371
Speaker 0: So my the.

227
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:07,255
Speaker 0: the other example of this is Another big internet thing that was happening a couple days ago.

228
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:08,360
Speaker 0: that sort of culminated.

229
00:15:09,062 --> 00:15:12,495
Speaker 0: There's a. there's a town of Lancaster in Pennsylvania Resenka Canas.

230
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:16,487
Speaker 0: Nope a different Lancaster So not the Amish Lancaster side.

231
00:15:16,547 --> 00:15:27,760
Speaker 0: note you can tell when a website especially a news site is a small world When it doesn't say what state something's in or assumes that you know the name of a town.

232
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:29,600
Speaker 0: So I'm looking at the website.

233
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:30,705
Speaker 0: There's no way to know.

234
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:31,650
Speaker 0: this is from New York.

235
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,953
Speaker 0: unless you happen to notice the tiny Buffalo calm in the upper left there could be another Buffalo.

236
00:15:36,993 --> 00:15:43,312
Speaker 1: But yeah, if it's Buffalo calm Buffalo Buffalo, you know how many buffaloes are in that sentence?

237
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:43,914
Speaker 0: I think nine.

238
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:44,977
Speaker 0: not sure though.

239
00:15:45,418 --> 00:15:46,020
Speaker 0: I think it's nine.

240
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:49,200
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll look it up and you don't know where to pause and where to inflect either.

241
00:15:49,545 --> 00:15:50,560
Speaker 0: You could just do it randomly.

242
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,400
Speaker 0: Inflection has no bearing on meaning in English except for maybe turning something into a question.

243
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,905
Speaker 1: There's commas in that sentence though.

244
00:15:56,065 --> 00:16:00,440
Speaker 0: commas can be omitted in almost all cases except the Oxford comma which must never be omitted.

245
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:05,580
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this town Lancaster had a problem.

246
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,632
Speaker 0: They have like a middle school team called the Redskins.

247
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:12,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should change that and there's actually a lot of rise.

248
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,244
Speaker 1: It wasn't changed already.

249
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,669
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so there's a lot of.

250
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:20,568
Speaker 1: I also want to point out how come you know These Redskins teams are getting all this pressure.

251
00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:23,136
Speaker 1: Shouldn't the Cleveland Indians be the number one fucking target.

252
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,205
Speaker 0: Yes, the Cleveland Indians I mean, they're not.

253
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,280
Speaker 1: they're a target, but they should be number fucking one.

254
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:32,680
Speaker 0: You know what it is redskins as a name is more offensive than their logo than in the Cleveland Indians.

255
00:16:33,162 --> 00:16:37,880
Speaker 0: Indians at least at least you could argue is in the vernacular as a generic.

256
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the Cleveland Indians mascot fuck.

257
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:48,743
Speaker 0: no Well, I mean no one cares about Chicago Blackhawks, right people do but not as much and I figured out why I was looking into That a lot actually.

258
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:50,789
Speaker 0: All right, so it seems like one.

259
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,040
Speaker 0: it's at least it's named after a World War two regiment.

260
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:58,451
Speaker 0: Oh, so there's at least a historical reason.

261
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:03,992
Speaker 1: now that regiment was named after the tribe Blackhawk I don't think is an insult itself, right?

262
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:10,613
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a little appropriative like you can't deny Yeah, but it's it unlike the Redskins which is just like.

263
00:17:10,773 --> 00:17:12,859
Speaker 0: why don't I have the like Utah black faces?

264
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,324
Speaker 1: I mean, so is Yankees.

265
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:19,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time it's okay because that's punching up not punching down.

266
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:25,445
Speaker 1: It would be a while but if it was Yankees and the team was in the south the Atlanta Yankees That would be a problem.

267
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:27,319
Speaker 0: They can punch up all they want.

268
00:17:28,584 --> 00:17:40,345
Speaker 0: Okay so anyway, but With the Blackhawks - at least their logo is just like - Tom Hogg's it's not just an offensive the dude's head But he's you know, he's sort of normal.

269
00:17:40,486 --> 00:17:41,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, though.

270
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:41,690
Speaker 0: They did have.

271
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,187
Speaker 0: well, they had a mascot called Thomas Hawk But he's gone now.

272
00:17:46,428 --> 00:17:48,460
Speaker 0: They have minimized his involvement.

273
00:17:49,630 --> 00:18:00,040
Speaker 0: So While their name is still problematic They're at least like they've addressed it to a degree to where it's not like the Redskins who can go fuck themselves, right?

274
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,718
Speaker 0: so this team?

275
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:05,839
Speaker 0: There are a lot of Native Americans who live in that part of New York.

276
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:13,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, no tons and all the other schools in the area Don't want to play games with this team because of their offensive name.

277
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:15,269
Speaker 1: Good job other schools and the kids.

278
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:21,619
Speaker 0: I applaud you and a lot of the kids in the school Didn't want to have an offensive Nate team name so they wouldn't join the team.

279
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,393
Speaker 1: Good job middle school kids for being so educated despite living in a small town.

280
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:35,860
Speaker 0: So an awesome girl Renae like came up with a new logo and a new mascot the Lancaster legends and it's just awesome night guy with a giant ass sword.

281
00:18:36,343 --> 00:18:38,719
Speaker 1: I approve of Knights with giant ass swords.

282
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,104
Speaker 0: So there is.

283
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:42,571
Speaker 0: Karissa Godziak made this logo.

284
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,774
Speaker 0: the school loved it.

285
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:44,596
Speaker 0: The kids loved it.

286
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:45,960
Speaker 1: She drew it with her art skills.

287
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,325
Speaker 0: I think so even better.

288
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,774
Speaker 1: So also Knights with big ass swords.

289
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:57,840
Speaker 1: the adults The parents in town her parents or other parents are all the parents had parents.

290
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:02,040
Speaker 0: They had the town meeting where they voted to like change this name like this.

291
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,288
Speaker 1: Why do they need a town meeting?

292
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:04,013
Speaker 1: just fucking do.

293
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:04,940
Speaker 0: it might have been a school board.

294
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,502
Speaker 0: I don't know.

295
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,431
Speaker 1: kid the principal of the school just like done.

296
00:19:07,632 --> 00:19:08,154
Speaker 0: Probably not.

297
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:08,576
Speaker 0: I don't know.

298
00:19:08,656 --> 00:19:09,420
Speaker 0: It's small-town crap.

299
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,022
Speaker 1: How would I?

300
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:10,443
Speaker 1: I don't know.

301
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,310
Speaker 1: anything is cool, but I have to decide.

302
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,080
Speaker 0: we'd hope we tried to get involved in Beacon politics.

303
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:19,497
Speaker 1: Just couldn't figure out how go to town council during the day when old people are there.

304
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:29,495
Speaker 0: Yeah so, uh Basically, they had this public meeting and they voted I think it was the school board or whatever to change the name and She gave a little speech about like why it's important to change how.

305
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,962
Speaker 0: her logo was great Nice speech.

306
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:36,580
Speaker 0: the other parents brought out the Heil Hitler's and it descended to chaos.

307
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,406
Speaker 1: Yes, what the fuck.

308
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:44,160
Speaker 1: of course in a small town like that there's someone with a small mind.

309
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:50,340
Speaker 1: There's someone with a small enough mind to go to the school board meeting of Lancaster, New York.

310
00:19:50,824 --> 00:19:51,733
Speaker 0: They turn their bet.

311
00:19:51,753 --> 00:20:00,179
Speaker 1: they stood there And they're an adult and they took time out of their day to go to the school board meeting of Lancaster New York, that is a small person.

312
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:09,069
Speaker 0: So a bunch of the parents her stood up or just like adults who live in the town Yeah Don't live in town already involved in the school stood up.

313
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,373
Speaker 1: care about what the man got.

314
00:20:10,453 --> 00:20:14,905
Speaker 0: little girl is giving her speech and turned Their back on her like those cops.

315
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:20,640
Speaker 1: They care about the mascot of a middle school in this tiny-ass town.

316
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,880
Speaker 1: That's important enough to them to take time out of their day to go to a meeting and make a statement.

317
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:28,551
Speaker 1: That is a sad individual.

318
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:29,940
Speaker 0: So read this article.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,530
Speaker 1: I mean even let's say in New York right the middle school near me Right had an awesome night as their mascot.

320
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:41,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wanted to change it to a clown Which is not as cool as a night and I was upset.

321
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:46,114
Speaker 1: Why first of all, wait, wait, why am I upset about what?

322
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,180
Speaker 1: but I don't even know.

323
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:48,798
Speaker 1: mascot of the middle school.

324
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:51,028
Speaker 0: Think like a head.

325
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:53,095
Speaker 0: you have to have to first.

326
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:54,319
Speaker 1: I have to know about this.

327
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,978
Speaker 1: So you're gonna put yourself I don't even know the mat the names man I don't even know where the local middle school is.

328
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,197
Speaker 0: So Scott imagine you lived in the same town your whole life and you went to this middle school.

329
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:09,096
Speaker 0: and now you're 40 You have fond memories of playing for this middle school team with this name.

330
00:21:09,116 --> 00:21:12,780
Speaker 1: So nothing has happened in my life That's overshadowed those memories since middle school.

331
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:18,315
Speaker 1: I don't even remember my middle school mascot with your dad in Napoleon Madison middle school.

332
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:19,358
Speaker 1: Was it Panthers?

333
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:20,240
Speaker 1: Maybe my?

334
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:22,452
Speaker 1: It was a cat of some kind.

335
00:21:22,473 --> 00:21:28,136
Speaker 0: mine was the middle school north And I want to say the high school was the Eagles under the number something.

336
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,732
Speaker 0: in elementary school It was the Falcons and elementary school.

337
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,195
Speaker 1: It wasn't any.

338
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:35,175
Speaker 0: in high school It was also the Falcons which I always thought was kind of a weird coincidence.

339
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:36,320
Speaker 1: in high school is Eagles.

340
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:37,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were the Falcons.

341
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:38,872
Speaker 0: Okay, the fighting Falcons.

342
00:21:38,913 --> 00:21:39,958
Speaker 0: I think maybe just the Falcons.

343
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:40,219
Speaker 0: I don't know.

344
00:21:41,712 --> 00:21:42,673
Speaker 0: Our football team sucked.

345
00:21:42,714 --> 00:21:44,437
Speaker 0: The logo was really only for the marching band.

346
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:45,880
Speaker 1: Anyway, some kind of mean cat.

347
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:58,690
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah the reddit shithead level Happened in the exact same manner in this little town when they changed the logo of a middle school sports team.

348
00:21:59,281 --> 00:22:01,890
Speaker 1: Well, someone cares about that subreddit that much.

349
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:11,527
Speaker 1: That Lancaster subreddits are like society that middle school mascot that much They care about this podcast.

350
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:12,309
Speaker 1: that much so.

351
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:18,560
Speaker 0: in a more positive news the review on iTunes Pizza Hut Which when I was a young kid, I enjoyed for some reason.

352
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:25,503
Speaker 1: I enjoyed Pizza Hut because number one they had one of those machines in the lobby where you could had like six Sega Genesis Games in it.

353
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:29,600
Speaker 0: Well ours had the afterburner that cost a dollar and moved, right?

354
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,720
Speaker 1: You could pay a quarter and pick one of the games and also an operation wolf.

355
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:36,513
Speaker 1: I usually picked Altered Beast rise from yoga.

356
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:38,460
Speaker 0: I just played Operation wolf with four quarters.

357
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:40,209
Speaker 1: Also, you sat down and get pizza.

358
00:22:40,229 --> 00:22:42,180
Speaker 1: you get the garlic breads and whatnot, right?

359
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the food came quick.

360
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:48,934
Speaker 1: also like it was a good place to eat out when you're a little kid And you can't sit still in a nice restaurant.

361
00:22:48,975 --> 00:22:49,600
Speaker 0: Also, we're spoiled.

362
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,980
Speaker 0: We live in New York now and also like pizza became better when we were young like in the 80s in Connecticut.

363
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,480
Speaker 1: I mean what pizza was I gonna get besides Mario the Baker?

364
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:58,901
Speaker 1: There was.

365
00:22:58,941 --> 00:23:01,551
Speaker 1: there's one pizza place in that town and there still is and that's it.

366
00:23:01,732 --> 00:23:02,434
Speaker 1: in the 80s.

367
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:14,089
Speaker 0: if you wanted pizza Unless you were lucky and lived next to like a for real Italian restaurant that would actually serve pizza for real Pizza Hut was probably the best you were gonna get.

368
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,679
Speaker 0: I mean from it was downhill from there was Domino's.

369
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:24,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, little Caesars a Pizza Hut, you know, you get a cool toy Howie's good good little menu to use your crayons on.

370
00:23:24,094 --> 00:23:29,899
Speaker 0: yep, you know, so The fern for the first time in decades, there's good new Pizza Hut did something smart.

371
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:39,520
Speaker 0: They now unveiled a pizza That is a stuffed crust and the crust is stuffed with hot dogs, right?

372
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,220
Speaker 1: So there's a big ring of hot dog around the edge of the pizza covered in bread.

373
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:44,709
Speaker 1: Yes, so it's basically.

374
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:50,317
Speaker 1: you can just peel that off and it's just hot dog Yes, and then in between inside the ring is pizza.

375
00:23:50,518 --> 00:23:56,178
Speaker 1: Yes So first of all this genius because all those people who are dumbasses don't eat the crust.

376
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,689
Speaker 1: now You're gonna eat that crust.

377
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,230
Speaker 1: but the problem is Now I can only eat like one slice.

378
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:01,974
Speaker 1: cuz I eat the slice.

379
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:02,598
Speaker 1: I eat the hot dog.

380
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:03,000
Speaker 1: That's enough.

381
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,464
Speaker 0: So Scott think back to an earlier.

382
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:10,122
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I'd eat like two slices, but Scott remember when you were 14 Mm-hmm.

383
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:12,692
Speaker 1: I could probably eat three slices and three hot dogs.

384
00:24:12,713 --> 00:24:16,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I when I was 14 I don't ever told the damage on again.

385
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:26,995
Speaker 0: And this see this is why is critically for real like I am NOT joking was kicked out of a Pizza Hut For taking advantage of their all-you-can-eat buffet lunch, right?

386
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:31,260
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah Like that that story is self descriptive.

387
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,452
Speaker 0: The thing is usually they asked me to leave.

388
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:45,380
Speaker 1: usually these crazy food Combination things that restaurants are coming up with are just disgusting like, you know The the double down where it's the replacement bread with fried chicken and you put this right even on the higher end like the artisanal stuff.

389
00:24:45,682 --> 00:24:47,976
Speaker 0: The ramen burger pretty nasty.

390
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:53,447
Speaker 1: Yeah The ramen burger I tried it not great But this it's like.

391
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:54,611
Speaker 1: well what it's.

392
00:24:54,832 --> 00:24:57,040
Speaker 1: there's nothing wrong with this because here's the problem.

393
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,095
Speaker 1: It's a little out there, but it's not disgusting in any way.

394
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:00,960
Speaker 1: It's like oh, what is it?

395
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,950
Speaker 1: It's a hot dog wrapped in bread next to a pizza.

396
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,447
Speaker 0: the people who make those kinds of like crazy food You put.

397
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:08,680
Speaker 1: you put sausage on pizza.

398
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:15,363
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a hot dog is not too far like the double down is you're taking some pretty shitty food and just making it worse For you.

399
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:22,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, like just taking it down into the gutter like you're doing something stupid Like I'm gonna take a bacon and a rabbit and turkey.

400
00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:23,340
Speaker 0: I'm gonna wrap that in more bacon.

401
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,733
Speaker 1: Dunkin Donuts do they had the two waffles of the breakfast?

402
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that shit.

403
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:31,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on the upper end you've got the artisanal thing like the ramen burger.

404
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:39,268
Speaker 0: They're like, we're gonna take a good food and try to make like a hipster artisanal experience out of it And usually it's just not well put together.

405
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,840
Speaker 0: But this is a lateral move.

406
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:45,759
Speaker 0: They're taking two foods that are at an equivalent level and combining them.

407
00:25:46,363 --> 00:25:48,960
Speaker 1: The thing is just the fact of putting the hot dog in the crust.

408
00:25:49,061 --> 00:25:50,293
Speaker 1: It's like that's what you do with the hot dog.

409
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:50,899
Speaker 1: You put it in a bun.

410
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,859
Speaker 0: It's just a crusty bun, which I've known kids who just eat a sliced up hot dog, and that's it.

411
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:59,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean and this is a hot dog in a bun I mean, this is just great.

412
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:02,440
Speaker 1: Chris the problem might actually go to a pizza and order one of these the pizza.

413
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,245
Speaker 0: They show you I'm desperate in a summer.

414
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:06,591
Speaker 1: Here's the problem desperate in a summer.

415
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:09,640
Speaker 0: the pizza they showed here is a meat lovers pizza.

416
00:26:11,124 --> 00:26:13,816
Speaker 0: Go full power full power.

417
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:19,380
Speaker 1: If I'm in a non New York, and I can't get a good pizza and there's a Pizza Hut I might order that.

418
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,493
Speaker 0: Well after that time we fucked up and tried to go to that Godfather's.

419
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,938
Speaker 1: Oh god in the gas station It was a pizza place in a gas station.

420
00:26:26,321 --> 00:26:31,039
Speaker 0: We should have just we wouldn't smart to have just thrown the pizza away directly upon receiving it.

421
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:35,253
Speaker 1: Drive up see that it was in the gas station and then drive away.

422
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, just charge back the credit card without giving money.

423
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:46,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they of the day.

424
00:26:47,722 --> 00:26:49,292
Speaker 0: So this is just like a YouTube show.

425
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:50,499
Speaker 0: I'm linking to one episode of it.

426
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:55,599
Speaker 0: If you've ever done tech support for anyone ever ever.

427
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,241
Speaker 0: You might not be able to finish this video because it might be a little too real too real It's.

428
00:27:03,704 --> 00:27:15,565
Speaker 0: I mean basically it's just this video about a guys at work And you see his computer and you hear his voice and he's on the phone, but it's like sped up so you get a lot of words in really quick and He's playing like Wolfenstein.

429
00:27:15,966 --> 00:27:21,140
Speaker 0: and then like he gets a phone call and then it cuts to his desktop and you see this desktop

430
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:22,628
Speaker 1: Covered in icon color

431
00:27:22,668 --> 00:27:39,514
Speaker 0: and he's like talking on the phone and meanwhile He's like drawing squares on the desktop and he's got like two AOL icons like kind of overlapping and he moves one of them over the other one to make it disappear and he's just talking and It gets to a point that we tries to add a row to his Excel spreadsheet and he can't.

432
00:27:40,016 --> 00:27:43,154
Speaker 0: so he calls tech support Because he's out of rows.

433
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:48,180
Speaker 0: and The beautiful part about all this is that the whole time in this discussion?

434
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:58,540
Speaker 0: He is clearly in PowerPoint with a table in a like in a slide and This video is so well just trolling the tech support first.

435
00:27:58,582 --> 00:27:59,402
Speaker 0: No It is.

436
00:27:59,783 --> 00:28:05,699
Speaker 0: this is the story of someone who is that stupid and you hear him interacting with the rest of the world around him.

437
00:28:07,264 --> 00:28:13,980
Speaker 0: It's actually really funny But it's also a little too real and I guess the reason I'm tonight is there.

438
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,875
Speaker 0: Yeah, these pop-ups keep coming up because it's and it just keeps escalating.

439
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:19,180
Speaker 0: He's also playing minesweeper.

440
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:20,691
Speaker 1: Does he know how to play minesweeper?

441
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:21,760
Speaker 0: He's playing a map with?

442
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,810
Speaker 0: 667 mines on it the absolute maximum.

443
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,718
Speaker 1: Is he doing a good job so far?

444
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:40,966
Speaker 0: but It's this is pretty funny because there's so many Little subtle things like he's on the tech support call in this, you know, what do you thinks is excel and The guys like hit like ctrl?

445
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,813
Speaker 0: I are all tired or whatever like.

446
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:43,495
Speaker 0: does that work?

447
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:44,660
Speaker 0: and he does that.

448
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:49,700
Speaker 0: But he just overwrites one of his cells like fucks up the data in what little spreadsheet he has and doesn't notice.

449
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:51,046
Speaker 0: And it's just.

450
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,818
Speaker 0: it's real hard to watch this.

451
00:28:54,101 --> 00:29:01,500
Speaker 1: All right, so, you know a lot of people are not exactly conscious about how much energy things take right?

452
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,580
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, we can think about things in terms of one context, right?

453
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,780
Speaker 1: Like how much electricity does my computer use on my electric bill?

454
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,960
Speaker 1: Some people know that you know, but you know, how much gas does my car use per mile?

455
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:24,680
Speaker 0: Well, like people like how many complain like Oh hundred watt light bulbs I'm just mad to these complex fluorescence are coming in like well, why can't I use my hundred watt light bulbs, right?

456
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:35,179
Speaker 1: But for example, you know If you drive your car say until the gas tank is empty how much energy you know How many times how many days of computer that energy is?

457
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,750
Speaker 1: Right, you don't know that right?

458
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,260
Speaker 1: people don't calculate that sort of thing.

459
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,529
Speaker 1: So to illustrate this and make you be more energy saving conscious Someone made this incredible video.

460
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,060
Speaker 1: where they took I don't know.

461
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:56,385
Speaker 1: He's like he's an Olympic track cyclist or something, but his leg is bigger around than my head and your head Yes, even Scott Johnson's head.

462
00:29:56,585 --> 00:30:01,740
Speaker 0: Scott our four legs combined would have a closely run affair fighting him in an anime.

463
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:09,524
Speaker 1: Our four legs our four bodies combined would have a closely run affair fighting one of his legs just one of the legs.

464
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:26,127
Speaker 1: so is a ginormous dude and he bikes on a stationary bike to power a toaster to toast a piece of toast and Then they tell you basically you can see how you know much energy it takes to toast a piece of toast.

465
00:30:26,668 --> 00:30:31,139
Speaker 1: and then they tell You relatively speaking how many of this guy it takes to power.

466
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:34,727
Speaker 1: various other things based on how well he powered the toaster.

467
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:37,570
Speaker 1: and Now you are more energy conscious.

468
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,473
Speaker 1: Congratulations.

469
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,722
Speaker 1: I got saw this dude with giant legs.

470
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:42,629
Speaker 0: I got tired watching this.

471
00:30:43,231 --> 00:30:44,214
Speaker 0: I felt short of breath.

472
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:54,718
Speaker 0: and then when they show his heart rate his heart rate is at the at like the average non athletic humans maximum, yep Maybe even above their maximum.

473
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,989
Speaker 1: and I guess I could have been like him if I would have spent my whole life on that And I had better genes for that sort of thing.

474
00:31:02,351 --> 00:31:03,133
Speaker 1: Maybe I didn't?

475
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,178
Speaker 1: you know being big and badass doesn't?

476
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:08,126
Speaker 0: you only really started biking for serious like recently.

477
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:09,430
Speaker 1: I biked when I was young.

478
00:31:09,891 --> 00:31:11,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not not properly.

479
00:31:11,717 --> 00:31:16,030
Speaker 1: No, I was not my fan, you know being a muscular does not run in my family.

480
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:21,135
Speaker 0: So in the moment the book club book is the wheel of time It goes around around.

481
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:25,770
Speaker 1: the first one first book is called the eye of the world.

482
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,285
Speaker 0: I bought it in a digital form and I'm a good way.

483
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,069
Speaker 1: It takes up less space.

484
00:31:30,109 --> 00:31:33,402
Speaker 0: that way I'm going to start reading it on my trip to London next week.

485
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:37,516
Speaker 1: I have read quite a bit of it But I have nowhere near even 25% done.

486
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:45,350
Speaker 0: I like I don't want to lie like hopefully when I start reading it I'm trying not to be down on it, but it is a fantasy novel.

487
00:31:45,651 --> 00:31:51,310
Speaker 0: I just don't want to read it now because I would rather read one of those old fuck out hidden elements books.

488
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,146
Speaker 1: This is probably better than those.

489
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:55,092
Speaker 0: well We'll see.

490
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:56,135
Speaker 1: we will say.

491
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,402
Speaker 0: that's the point of those fuck out hidden items.

492
00:31:58,462 --> 00:32:05,741
Speaker 0: Books are pretty bad like especially the Shit, or the cleric quintet, which is one of the.

493
00:32:05,941 --> 00:32:06,423
Speaker 1: is that way?

494
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:08,530
Speaker 1: is that five clerics who go around together?

495
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:12,710
Speaker 0: No, it is five books about one cleric named Catterley.

496
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,462
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not five different clerics and then it's not a quintet is it?

497
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:20,958
Speaker 0: and it's about this kind of Bullshit II minor God.

498
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,143
Speaker 0: and it's really.

499
00:32:22,243 --> 00:32:25,194
Speaker 1: it's not even about paler or anything Paler.

500
00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:26,263
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the other.

501
00:32:26,283 --> 00:32:33,901
Speaker 1: that's the paler bringing your bringing your non-canon like It's in third edition D&D players hand.

502
00:32:33,942 --> 00:32:35,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's like some grey house on sand.

503
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,287
Speaker 1: I was always a cleric of paler the most good and generic God you could pick.

504
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:39,548
Speaker 0: Yeah.

505
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:45,146
Speaker 0: No, no I always play I always worship like I don't know spider whatever that they had at PAX.

507
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't worship her.

508
00:32:48,256 --> 00:32:49,281
Speaker 1: Can you be a cleric of her?

509
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:53,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're a drow I don't know if she'd accept a non drow Worshipping here.

510
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:58,026
Speaker 0: if you're not a drow, I don't know what she'd do when I don't know any other Forgotten Realms.

511
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:01,760
Speaker 1: things that weren't statues No or books that rim read.

Speaker 0: you you tested me.

528
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:51,584
Speaker 0: I remembered a surprising number of names from the Elaine Cunningham elfy books Like way more than I should have way more than I remembered from a book.

529
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:56,501
Speaker 1: I just read with the rabbits in it About some water ship or something.

530
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:57,770

Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 0: Remember it now.

535
00:34:05,242 --> 00:34:05,423
Speaker 0: Yes.

536
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:06,367
Speaker 0: What's the name of the bird?

537
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:09,054
Speaker 0: Okay I'm just.

538
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:10,445
Speaker 0: I'm not enthused about this book.

539
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,472
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna.

540
00:34:11,492 --> 00:34:13,464
Speaker 0: I'm trying to not let that color my perception of the book.

541
00:34:13,505 --> 00:34:18,085
Speaker 0: However, anyway Maybe I'll just buy the heron sword and then I'll feel better about reading the baron swords.

542
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:19,029
Speaker 1: pretty awesome so far.

543
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like swords when I was a kid.

544
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,010
Speaker 1: I'm welcome to canaria.

545
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:30,949
Speaker 0: I almost read the wheel of time like ten times because when I was in high school You could get from museum replicas the heron sword and it just looked amazing.

546
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:34,382
Speaker 1: So I'm not as good as the heron spear, which by the way spoilers is probably a laser cannon.

547
00:34:34,422 --> 00:34:38,938
Speaker 0: It's probably yeah, probably anyway, uh Come to Connecticut.

548
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,730
Speaker 0: It's in a month in Hartford, Connecticut.

549
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:44,281
Speaker 0: The panel schedules basically done and I'm not gonna lie.

550
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,969
Speaker 0: It is the best goddamn panel schedule we've ever had.

551
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,706
Speaker 0: There is some good stuff in there.

552
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,060
Speaker 1: Kineticon is an everything geek con.

555
00:34:55,871 --> 00:34:58,907
Speaker 1: You can do that at Kineticon, but you should also do something else.

556
00:34:58,947 --> 00:34:59,550
Speaker 1: Don't be that guy.

557
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,317

00:36:17,906 --> 00:36:18,848
Speaker 1: All right.

590
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:31,348
Speaker 1: Yeah So come to Kineticon if you can drive to it or take some other mass transit like a bus if you're close enough Go if you're kind of far maybe not worth it cuz it's not the biggest craziest con, but maybe it is.

591
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:31,730
Speaker 1: I don't know.

592
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:34,562
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid I just had luggage like.

593
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:35,990
Speaker 0: that was just a thing my parents bought for me.

594
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,894
Speaker 0: I didn't think about it.

595
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:42,921
Speaker 1: Uh, I think I had a Suitcase the kind with a handle that you zippered open the side.

596
00:36:42,941 --> 00:36:45,250
Speaker 1: It's basically a large, you know briefcase class.

597
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:48,369
Speaker 0: I didn't kind of thing travel on my own as a kid really.

598
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:52,929
Speaker 0: so My mom would like come into the room be like, here's your suitcase fill it.

599
00:36:53,391 --> 00:37:08,171
Speaker 1: yeah, whenever I went places on my own it was either gonna be summer camp or Some kind of trip and I would just duffle bag just a really big at the duffle bag that was large enough for the length of the trip and Stuff it.

600
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,660
Speaker 0: So when I got older and I needed luggage of my own.

601
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:14,006
Speaker 0: I bought the cheapest possible garbage.

602
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,459
Speaker 0: I bought the cheapest bag money could buy.

603
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,047
Speaker 1: I kept using the duffle bag for a very very long time.

604
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:31,230
Speaker 1: I had you know, the Extra-large giganto duffle bag which I still have and the medium duffle bag which got lost somewhere and I just kept using those.

605
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:37,090
Speaker 1: They had shoulder straps, but you know it I just used those for a long-ass time.

606
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:43,245
Speaker 1: It wasn't until like maybe a few years ago that I started to be like Oh, these are actually kind of inconvenient for going to conventions all the time.

607
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:44,170
Speaker 0: So again, so that's it.

608
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:52,457
Speaker 0: So as I was a kid, I remember that adults would talk about luggage a lot And they'd complain about and compare luggage.

609
00:37:52,798 --> 00:37:59,500
Speaker 1: and then I learned that luggage hold their whole stores that just sell luggage only and yeah Expensive luggage and it's like what is going.

610
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,404
Speaker 1: why is this happening?

611
00:38:00,424 --> 00:38:01,750
Speaker 1: Why luggage is what's wrong?

612
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,330
Speaker 1: We're just you know, just get one double bag.

613
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:11,944
Speaker 0: You're good and luggage is really expensive like a pretty good roller bag can go for like four or five hundred bucks And you're seeing people traveling with like huge amounts of shit.

614
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,230
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck is wrong with.

615
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,979
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the people I see at the airport.

616
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,366
Speaker 0: We're not talking about packing though.

617
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:17,050
Speaker 0: We're not talking about travel.

618
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:18,595
Speaker 0: It's talking about the luggage itself, right?

619
00:38:18,635 --> 00:38:25,076
Speaker 0: So I didn't care and I use garbage luggage like I bought like in 2008 even like that.

620
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:34,270
Speaker 0: recently I bought literally just a roller bag Bag at one of those places that sells luggage like in the bad parts of town in New York.

621
00:38:34,511 --> 00:38:37,149
Speaker 1: I mean for the longest time I was pretty much just like box.

622
00:38:37,471 --> 00:38:40,182
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna use a roller bag because only sissies use roller.

623
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:41,910
Speaker 0: Oh you come around on that, haven't you?

624
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,565
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I use it when it's.

625
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:48,444
Speaker 0: you know You Scott Scott gave me shit for like five years.

626
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:50,330
Speaker 0: but rim why do you have a roller bag?

627
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,213
Speaker 0: That's for babies.

628
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:52,055
Speaker 0: My duffel bags.

629
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:52,898
Speaker 0: Just fine.

630
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:54,845
Speaker 0: Only sissies use roller bags.

631
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's true.

632
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,278
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

633
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,328
Speaker 1: My arm is mad weak.

634
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:07,757
Speaker 1: So I was taking more stuff to conventions, you know and I have my arm was starting to struggle But where before it did not.

635
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:08,522
Speaker 0: that's what did it.

636
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:12,842
Speaker 0: because my arm is mad weak we also got away with it for a long time having crappy luggage.

637
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:24,566
Speaker 0: because if you only ever drive places and You own a car and you know, it's also a major fact it's pretty easy to have terrible luggage because you just kind of throw all the stuff that doesn't fit in your trunk.

638
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:26,816
Speaker 0: and I Remember, right?

639
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,264
Speaker 1: I used to take my duffel bag.

640
00:39:28,325 --> 00:39:29,109
Speaker 1: That was really heavy.

641
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:33,930
Speaker 1: Just carry downstairs put in a car drive it and carry it into a hotel and that was it.

642
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:41,373
Speaker 0: So I brought board games In the trunk and then like I remember we get to a con and then we make like four trips from the car to the Hotel room.

643
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:48,340
Speaker 1: but now it's like oh I have to go to Australia and I have to get this to the airport on public transportation And I don't want to pay for a taxi.

644
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,349
Speaker 1: This is not gonna be good.

645
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:53,130
Speaker 1: I need something that carries more easily.

646
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:57,576
Speaker 1: But also when you just have a big duffel bag It's hard to organize your stuff in it.

647
00:39:57,737 --> 00:39:59,242
Speaker 1: Everything just sort of mushes around.

648
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,670
Speaker 1: you can't like keep clothes folded nicely.

649
00:40:01,811 --> 00:40:04,650
Speaker 1: You can't separate, you know your shoes from your clothes.

650
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:05,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't.

651
00:40:05,493 --> 00:40:15,931
Speaker 0: you know if you need to bring an extra shoe with you and then whoo betide you have a multi hop journey Right where you stay in a hotel for like a week and then go somewhere else and you put any sort of specialized equipment in there.

652
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:20,668
Speaker 1: now you take a lot of electronics with you when you travel camera stuff chargers and you just.

653
00:40:20,729 --> 00:40:34,694
Speaker 1: you know you don't want to just toss that stuff in all willy-nilly like having a specific like camera bag or a Compartment to put charges in or way to separate toiletries from other things in case they explode even though you do put them in a plastic bags.

654
00:40:34,734 --> 00:40:35,217
Speaker 1: that right.

655
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:41,823
Speaker 0: so I decided at least to spend Whatever money it would take to have the best possible luggage.

656
00:40:41,883 --> 00:40:43,790
Speaker 0: that would just make my life easier forever.

657
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:45,601
Speaker 1: also, you got to remember there's those.

658
00:40:45,621 --> 00:40:49,197
Speaker 1: I don't have them but the Luggage that can take a beating.

659
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:49,459
Speaker 1: right.

660
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,529
Speaker 1: if the Samsonite stuff that's hard shell.

661
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:58,403
Speaker 1: So in case when it's rolling around in that airport carousel, however hard shell luggage a Lot of money.

662
00:40:58,423 --> 00:41:04,930
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm also not into it because the one advantage of not having the hard shell is you can cram more stuff in.

663
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,098
Speaker 0: I don't cram anymore though.

664
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,650
Speaker 0: I bring so little I'm trying to bring.

665
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:14,710
Speaker 1: I'm constantly bringing less and less everywhere I go, but but having luggage that's at least a little flexible is kind of good.

666
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,783
Speaker 0: So Emily and I like many many years ago.

667
00:41:16,803 --> 00:41:17,810
Speaker 0: I'm two packs.

668
00:41:18,494 --> 00:41:22,033
Speaker 0: We just thought we'd be clever because like I was gonna go to work or whatever Like we had this.

669
00:41:22,053 --> 00:41:23,821
Speaker 0: like we're gonna meet at the airport last year.

670
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:23,882
Speaker 1: No.

671
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:25,007
Speaker 0: No, this was beautiful.

672
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,507
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not last year.

673
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:28,476
Speaker 1: So it was last year.

674
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:29,019
Speaker 1: you had trouble.

675
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:30,548
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't last year.

676
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:30,970
Speaker 0: We had trouble.

677
00:41:31,152 --> 00:41:32,950
Speaker 0: Anyway, I've been using that silver bag for a while.

678
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:38,350
Speaker 0: Okay So we put all our stuff in one big bag to check and then I just carried like a backpack.

679
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:39,897
Speaker 0: So we combined our luggage.

680
00:41:40,218 --> 00:41:40,680
Speaker 0: that was fine.

681
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:49,890
Speaker 0: on the way to packs on the way home We realized that the bag was now too heavy and we would have to pay like 80 extra dollars to check it.

682
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,828
Speaker 1: Cuz you bought stuff and put it in there.

683
00:41:52,352 --> 00:41:55,727
Speaker 0: So what we decided was why don't we just buy a new bag?

684
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:56,510
Speaker 0: we need a new luggage.

685
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:58,809
Speaker 0: Anyway, we'll buy a new luggage here in Seattle.

686
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:05,232
Speaker 0: we go to a luggage store poking around and I look at like this pretty nice luggage and It says like.

687
00:42:05,252 --> 00:42:06,596
Speaker 0: it says like Oh sale 40% off.

688
00:42:06,677 --> 00:42:10,930
Speaker 0: I'm like, okay great and it's hard shell and it looks really nice.

689
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,606
Speaker 0: It's the perfect size and I just kind of say fuck it.

690
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:14,250
Speaker 0: I'll just get this one.

691
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,163
Speaker 0: I carry up to the front and then as I'm carrying it up.

692
00:42:17,364 --> 00:42:21,021
Speaker 0: I actually see the price tag I expected like a couple hundred bucks.

693
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:23,150
Speaker 1: Maybe yeah hundreds was $3,000.

694
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,336
Speaker 1: what is it made of?

695
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:24,557
Speaker 1: gold?

696
00:42:24,618 --> 00:42:33,550
Speaker 1: No Carbon fibers designer bullshit, apparently Oh like a fancy designer name on it.

697
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,750
Speaker 0: So then I start looking around and yeah, even the ugly bad luggage is like many hundreds of dollars.

698
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,894
Speaker 1: well, that's a separate issue.

699
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:52,437
Speaker 1: entirely right is that there's this industry of designer fashion bags that just Greatly inflate the price of a bag because there's a trademark on the bag because certain people in our society Highly value that trademark.

700
00:42:52,718 --> 00:42:58,939
Speaker 0: regardless of the actual quality or design of the bag of this bag They're gonna check into an air load and immediately have destroyed.

701
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:08,650
Speaker 1: a normal person who buys bags and is looking for utility Cannot buy any of those even if they happen to actually be a good design in any point in time.

702
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:13,914
Speaker 1: So that's why I just buy like Timbuktu and you know That sort of brand

703
00:43:14,195 --> 00:43:23,722
Speaker 0: and all my research Timbuktu like this they're not paying us or anything just as like good advice Literally never buy luggage from anyone but them unless

704
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:25,710
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's other good brands of luggage, right?

705
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:26,910
Speaker 0: I did a lot of research.

706
00:43:27,091 --> 00:43:35,161
Speaker 0: I could not find good luggage that didn't cost as easily three or four times as much and That more expensive luggage was often not as well designed.

707
00:43:35,221 --> 00:43:37,830
Speaker 1: but Timbuktu and other similar companies, right?

708
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:44,969
Speaker 1: They are, you know out there making things that are designed to be practical not jacking up the price based on trademarks or designs.

709
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:46,977
Speaker 1: and You know, I started off.

710
00:43:47,038 --> 00:43:49,030
Speaker 1: they were only messenger bags at the beginning right?

711
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, we both have the same custom messenger bag.

712
00:43:51,518 --> 00:43:55,130
Speaker 1: I've made a custom messenger bag from them expecting it to last a long time.

713
00:43:55,353 --> 00:43:58,796
Speaker 1: I've been using that since Probably over a decade now.

714
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,322
Speaker 1: It's like a long long ass time.

715
00:44:00,342 --> 00:44:02,490
Speaker 1: still have the same bag still nothing wrong with it.

716
00:44:03,197 --> 00:44:04,430
Speaker 1: Every day has no problem.

717
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:13,570
Speaker 1: So, you know seeing that my primary bag that I used every day and had no problems with and it was amazing I'm like, well, I trusted you for this most important bag that I have.

718
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,005
Speaker 1: I will trust you for these second most important bag and third most important bag and so on.

719
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:20,374
Speaker 1: now and I have not been Steered wrong.

720
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:24,190
Speaker 0: I travel a lot for highly variable amounts of time.

721
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:35,681
Speaker 0: So I kind of broke down that basically what I needed was a messenger bag Which is usually my like, you know personal item because my laptop and DS and everything's in there I mean, I use mine every single day including traveling.

722
00:44:35,701 --> 00:44:36,002
Speaker 1: and

723
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:52,797
Speaker 0: then I needed either a backpack that I could check or carry on or Just a full-on luggage like a big one But not a giant one not the one that you see like those stupid people at the airport like not the one that's like Yeah, like three feet wide or whatever.

724
00:44:52,817 --> 00:44:55,686
Speaker 0: I'm talking like the biggest roller bag.

725
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:57,090
Speaker 0: That is reasonable.

726
00:44:58,423 --> 00:45:00,095
Speaker 0: and Between those three bags.

727
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:03,225
Speaker 0: I'm like a hundred percent set for any travel.

728
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:04,570
Speaker 0: I will ever do in my life forever.

729
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:07,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I still have some older bags Like I have my.

730
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:09,930
Speaker 0: got rid of my older bags because they're worthless.

731
00:45:10,435 --> 00:45:12,130
Speaker 1: I mean mine have like my initials on them.

732
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:15,745
Speaker 1: But I have like the giant duffel bag still and I have my backpack.

733
00:45:15,765 --> 00:45:18,175
Speaker 1: from when I used a backpack I remember that giant blue bag.

734
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:20,403
Speaker 0: I literally just threw it away like in college.

735
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:21,627
Speaker 1: I used that backpack, right?

736
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:32,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, but You know I only really use the three tip muck two bags the wheelie one the not wheelie one for shorter trips and My everyday messenger bag.

737
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:41,030
Speaker 0: if I flew a lot more I would consider getting one more smaller wheelie bag Because then I could do the backpack cuz I got that really good like aviator backpack.

738
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:46,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, put that under the seat in front of you But the small wheelie bag in the overhead bin and then check the big wheelie bag.

739
00:45:46,545 --> 00:46:01,390
Speaker 0: Yep, or actually Going to the airport where the backpack carry the roller bag and then if I have to check one of them It's just for the ease of transport to the airport because you can only have one wheelie one backpack if you have more.

740
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:03,330
Speaker 1: If you have two wheelies you're in deep shit.

741
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can attach my messenger bag to the backpack because the backpack is really cleverly designed.

742
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually also have a Tim muck 2 camera bag That is just like.

743
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:17,457
Speaker 1: it's sort of like a messenger bag, but it's only meant to hold a camera Compartments to put lenses.

744
00:46:17,477 --> 00:46:22,240
Speaker 0: Well, I also have a Timbuktu Bicycling backpack that can care.

745
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,070
Speaker 0: It's basically I could carry enough stuff to go.

746
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:25,597
Speaker 1: Let's not make a Timbuktu ad here.

747
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:25,778
Speaker 1: Now.

748
00:46:25,898 --> 00:46:27,928
Speaker 1: There are a lot of companies that sell all this shit, too.

749
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,830
Speaker 1: Timbuktu probably isn't even the best at camera bags.

750
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:35,110
Speaker 1: I saw some like I forget the name of the company but like dub something.

751
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,074
Speaker 0: No, but this can't this.

752
00:46:36,315 --> 00:46:37,399
Speaker 0: this you think like.

753
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:40,250
Speaker 0: what's so special about a biking backpack?

754
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:41,614
Speaker 0: So one.

755
00:46:41,836 --> 00:46:43,770
Speaker 0: it rides way higher than a normal backpack.

756
00:46:44,071 --> 00:46:46,519
Speaker 0: So when you're biking hunched over it's like perfect.

757
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:48,425
Speaker 0: It's not like sagging bag.

758
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:49,930
Speaker 0: It's not in like the bottom of your back.

759
00:46:50,332 --> 00:46:54,970
Speaker 0: It's got like crazy vents on it and it's just like shaped to fit my back when I'm hunched biking.

760
00:46:56,811 --> 00:46:57,173
Speaker 0: So I could.

761
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:58,781
Speaker 0: I could if I go if I do that thing right.

762
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:06,357
Speaker 0: if I consider my trip easy time From biking from Sydney to Melbourne.

763
00:47:06,879 --> 00:47:08,846
Speaker 0: I will use that backpack to carry my shit with me.

764
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,750
Speaker 0: Okay?

765
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:12,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

766
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:14,324
Speaker 1: What else is there to say about luggage?

767
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,341
Speaker 0: Uh Don't buy giant luggage.

768
00:47:17,422 --> 00:47:18,450
Speaker 0: It's literally worthless.

769
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:25,524
Speaker 0: If you think you need a giant luggage like one of those giant giant giant ones You're probably wrong and you're packing away too much.

770
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:28,035
Speaker 1: even if you have a big family Just make freaking.

771
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:31,510
Speaker 1: everyone carry their own shit and everyone has the normal size bags.

772
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:36,363
Speaker 0: Also airlines have really cracked down like the maximum weight of bags I don't know or smaller.

773
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:44,310
Speaker 1: everyone in you You mean if you have a ton of luggage that you need because you have a big family Every single person has their own wheelie bag and their own backpack even little kiddies.

774
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:48,069
Speaker 0: And if you're bringing more than that because you're moving somewhere for like six months ship it.

775
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:49,779
Speaker 1: That's also a good idea.

776
00:47:49,799 --> 00:47:51,730
Speaker 0: Like don't try to bring it on the plane with you.

777
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,070
Speaker 1: Just actually be cheaper than putting it on the plane, right?

778
00:47:54,751 --> 00:47:55,815
Speaker 0: You know that used to be the case.

779
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:56,778
Speaker 1: Depending on how heavy it is.

780
00:47:56,939 --> 00:47:59,026
Speaker 0: It is basically not true anymore.

781
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:03,310
Speaker 0: I Shipped some stuff instead of bring it with me on a business trip.

782
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:07,104
Speaker 0: The shipping cost more than just another plane ticket for a human.

783
00:48:07,245 --> 00:48:08,550
Speaker 1: It depends on the weight, right?

784
00:48:08,871 --> 00:48:12,710
Speaker 1: So if something's really freaking heavy then bring it on the plane is better.

785
00:48:12,831 --> 00:48:17,179
Speaker 1: But if you something is not that heavy Check it the airlines now.

786
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,370
Speaker 0: I have an upper limit of no you can't check this.

787
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:24,329
Speaker 0: Sorry, I'm not talking about that heavy, but oh that look that that level is lower than you think.

788
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:28,096
Speaker 1: hmm Figure your own shit out people.

789
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:34,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but and also a good answer for a lot of things is Don't bring it with you buy something on the other side.

790
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,053
Speaker 0: That is also true.

791
00:48:36,093 --> 00:48:41,710
Speaker 1: travel like if you're flying to China and you know, it's like yeah a toothbrush doesn't weigh anything, right?

792
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,610
Speaker 1: But let's say you need boots cuz you're gonna go hiking in some mountains, right?

793
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,137
Speaker 1: Those boots are real freakin heavy.

794
00:48:49,278 --> 00:48:51,467
Speaker 1: You might be better off just buying boots over there.

795
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:52,230
Speaker 0: I would bring my boots.

796
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:53,276
Speaker 0: My boots are worn in.

797
00:48:53,296 --> 00:48:54,623
Speaker 0: they're fitted to me perfectly.

798
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:59,870
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's $300 boots as an example of a heavy thing you might bring right?

799
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:07,253
Speaker 0: Well, I tried to do that and it didn't work out so well in Australia when I decided I'll just buy a tripod in Australia A bicycle.

800
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,543
Speaker 1: you can just go rent one on the other side.

801
00:49:09,683 --> 00:49:11,330
Speaker 0: I would not bring my bicycle on a plane ever.

802
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:11,872
Speaker 1: Maybe you're.

803
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:15,145
Speaker 1: maybe you're a videographer and you need video cameras that are like huge.

804
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:17,338
Speaker 1: just rent those on the other side Don't bring them with.

805
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:18,629
Speaker 0: but I guess here's the advice.

806
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:33,590
Speaker 0: In my experience in Scott's experience as smart dudes If you need luggage by the best backpack the best messenger bag and the best reasonably sized really bag That that exists just by the absolutely perfect thing.

807
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:42,120
Speaker 1: And even if you don't have a lot of monies because I know most people don't I mean I bought my first Timbuktu bag And it was like a couple hundred bucks and I did not have a lot of monies then and it's worth it.

808
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:46,904
Speaker 1: it's I saved up and got it because then you'd never had to buy one again.

809
00:49:46,924 --> 00:49:50,517
Speaker 1: just suffer with shitty bags until you just Use like grocery bags.

810
00:49:50,537 --> 00:49:55,514
Speaker 1: just suffer until you have enough money and get the good bag and then that bag will last you forever.

811
00:49:55,534 --> 00:50:05,108
Speaker 1: if you buy a shitty bag for like 50 bucks and Then it falls apart you buy another one for 50 by the time you get to your fourth bag It's like well, you could just bought the fancy one to begin with.

812
00:50:05,228 --> 00:50:15,888
Speaker 0: Yep I've thrown away easily four or five wheelie bags in my life that cost way more Combined than the one like hundred and eighty dollar amazing travel backpack that I have now.

813
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:22,199
Speaker 1: Yep So it's a thing that if you you know travel a lot It's worth investing in.

814
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,190
Speaker 0: the other thing is if you go to if you get good bags They're measured to actually fit in like carry-on on different airlines.

815
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, the websites all the companies will tell you like this is carry-on legal at least right now until the rules change?

816
00:50:34,696 --> 00:50:40,120
Speaker 0: What can mess you up though is that international flights often have different rules and Classes have different rules like business class.

817
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:42,390
Speaker 0: You can bring whatever you want pretty much.

818
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,635
Speaker 1: You're paying ten times as much.

819
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:45,021
Speaker 1: you bring it ten times as much stuff.

820
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:45,402
Speaker 0: Yep.

821
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:50,780
Speaker 0: Oh the other important thing I Recently, finally, I've been sub despite this advice.

822
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,426
Speaker 0: I wasn't taking my own advice.

823
00:50:52,546 --> 00:50:53,530
Speaker 0: for most of my life.

824
00:50:54,033 --> 00:50:56,509
Speaker 0: I had a. I had the shittiest garment bag in the world.

825
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:01,029
Speaker 0: I just bought a swag garment bag.

826
00:51:01,711 --> 00:51:02,680
Speaker 1: Garment bags are important.

827
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,830
Speaker 1: if you have to bring fancy clothes.

828
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,936
Speaker 0: It was like 40 bucks Which seems like a lot.

829
00:51:05,956 --> 00:51:08,330
Speaker 1: you just take like a fancy suit and cram it in your luggage.

830
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:10,401
Speaker 1: Even if you fold it nicely, it's not gonna come out.

831
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:11,085
Speaker 1: Well on the other end.

832
00:51:11,105 --> 00:51:12,050
Speaker 1: You'll have to go to the dry-clean.

833
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, no Scott I'll show you this garden.

834
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:17,825
Speaker 1: if you need to get off the plane and go to a business meet you need your suit to be Ready to go.

835
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:21,850
Speaker 1: You don't want to wear it on the plane and get it all stinky, especially applies long.

836
00:51:22,232 --> 00:51:24,725
Speaker 1: The garment bag is anything like a necessary thing.

837
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:29,769
Speaker 0: going to a wedding Bringing the nice suit for like the nerd prom or whatever at the convention.

838
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:31,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, garment bag.

Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I just bought a for real garment bag.

843
00:51:39,913 --> 00:51:43,090
Speaker 0: I'm a moron for having used my crappy garment bag for like the last decade.

844
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,429
Speaker 0: I really feel dumb for not having done this sooner.

845
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:52,398
Speaker 1: One most important feature of the garment bag is when the bottom of it can like, you know Connect to the top to fold it out.

846
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:53,744
Speaker 1: That is the most important feature.

00:51:53,784 --> 00:51:55,693
Speaker 0: Wait till you see this garment bag I got.

848
00:51:55,834 --> 00:51:58,430
