1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,178
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 26th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:10,599
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:14,890
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,235
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:20,030
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about Splitgate, its portal, and an FPS.

6
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:22,309
Speaker 1: Deathmatch-y game.

7
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:25,227
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:44,830
Speaker 1: So, uh, right around the beginning of quarantine, when we had to record Geek Nights remotely, like fully remotely, as opposed to doing it in person, I didn't have like all the kind of equipment I needed, so I kind of just made do, but I eventually bought that backdrop and I got better lighting and I could sort of set everything up to do this pretty permanently.

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:55,710
Speaker 1: One of the things I bought way back then was the shittiest possible LED USB powered ring light, like the $8 one that was just on Amazon.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,175
Speaker 0: That's what I got right here.

11
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,030
Speaker 0: that's making my face look like, you know, the white sun.

12
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,368
Speaker 1: That's what I got pointing at me right here.

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,030
Speaker 1: I used to use it over the webcam, but over time I moved it to the side because I rearranged the lighting.

14
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:12,010
Speaker 0: Mine has a thing for the webcam to go in the middle of it, so it's actually ring lighting properly.

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,950
Speaker 1: Mine has that too, but I sit far enough away from my webcam and I'm lit from different angles anyway to where it's kind of moot.

16
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,110
Speaker 1: So I moved it to the side to be like the spotlight.

17
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,289
Speaker 0: It's also, you know, the sun, the earth is tilting backwards to the incorrect position, so it's getting dark now.

18
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,389
Speaker 0: Whereas normally it would not be dark right now.

19
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,240
Speaker 1: Oh, if it weren't for the rainstorm and everything, I often have to worry about.

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,070
Speaker 1: the sun comes directly in about three quarters of the way through geek nights.

21
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,590
Speaker 0: Because of the time of year, also with my south facing window, it's like late in the day if it's not cloudy.

22
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:47,590
Speaker 0: This is the time of year where the sun just comes right in the window.

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:55,190
Speaker 0: It's like, ah, why don't you, if you're going to shoot me in the face with your bright lights, the part of you that I hate, at least make it warm, the part of you that I enjoy.

24
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,183
Speaker 0: Nope, cold and sun in your face.

25
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,169
Speaker 0: That's the worst convo.

26
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:08,590
Speaker 1: So today, that ring light, the switch mechanism that controls all of its options just broke and it stuck permanently on.

27
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,029
Speaker 0: Can't you just unplug it and plug it in?

28
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:17,107
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I can unplug it and plug it in, but because I was using that little control box, I actually have the USB.

29
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,289
Speaker 1: It's not plugged into my computer because I'm just powering it.

30
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:29,550
Speaker 1: It's actually run all the way down behind my desk and plugged into my power strip because my power strip, which is mounted to my desk, has a line of USB power slots.

31
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:39,770
Speaker 0: Actually, so the outlets in this apartment, like a handful of them have USB in the outlet and I tested it and they totally work.

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:48,110
Speaker 0: And there's two of them happen to be behind my desk and the ring light is one of the only things to use those because I don't trust them that much.

33
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:55,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I bought power strips that I can actually screw them to the bottom of my desk so I can keep all the cables out of the way.

34
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,745
Speaker 0: I got the cage thingy.

35
00:02:57,712 --> 00:02:59,509
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get a cage too, I think.

36
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:05,829
Speaker 1: Anyway, so right now, all day, this ring light's been permanently on unless I climb back there and unplug it.

37
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,379
Speaker 1: So I just ordered a new, much better solution.

38
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,949
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna throw this thing away because it's falling apart in other ways too.

39
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,909
Speaker 1: The clamp is starting to not clamp that well.

40
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:17,469
Speaker 1: The clamps.

41
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, these clamps that I've been using to clamp this ring light for two years.

42
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:21,930
Speaker 0: That clamp?

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:29,449
Speaker 1: So in some news that I was about to say only RIM cares about, but apparently other people care.

44
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:40,710
Speaker 1: Advanced Wars, the coming remake, which remember is counting US releases because there's a bunch of Advanced Wars in Japan that honestly we do not need here in the US.

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,030
Speaker 1: They are categorically inferior to the Advanced Wars.

46
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,149
Speaker 0: I've tried to play a lot of those Famicom Wars, Game Boy Wars.

47
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,129
Speaker 1: They're just not as good.

48
00:03:50,812 --> 00:03:57,710
Speaker 0: Using my emulation and such, and pretty much anything older than Advanced Wars 1, it's like you really don't need to play it.

49
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,590
Speaker 1: They're just not as good.

50
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,990
Speaker 1: Imagine a game that's just less fun and less polished.

51
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,566
Speaker 0: It's a turn-based game, but you don't need to play it.

52
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,549
Speaker 1: If you want to play what those old ones are like, play, oh god, what was it called, Desert Commander or something on the NES?

53
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,221
Speaker 0: It's basically the same series, I think.

54
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:22,410
Speaker 1: So anyway, this is Advanced Wars 1 and 2, which were the first two Advanced Wars that we got in the US for real.

55
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,090
Speaker 1: And they were both fantastic games that are very different from each other, but neither one replaces the other.

56
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,070
Speaker 1: They are both good on their own, and they're both worth playing independently of each other.

57
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,510
Speaker 1: They were getting this remake, they're being remastered and remade just to work on the Switch.

58
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,376
Speaker 1: That whole project is delayed.

59
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:41,601
Speaker 1: They're launching in Q2 2022 now.

60
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:50,130
Speaker 1: It's probably good, because I actually plan to stream these games heavily.

61
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,130
Speaker 1: I even set up the pipeline and the video capture to do it from the Switch.

62
00:04:55,331 --> 00:05:00,450
Speaker 1: But I don't really have time for that shit right now, so it's kind of good that I got some delay before I start streaming these games.

63
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:10,759
Speaker 0: So apparently Desert Commander in Japan, known as Desert Fox Tanks Colon Tank Strategy, does look a lot like Famicom Wars.

64
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:17,770
Speaker 0: However, it is not in the same series as Famicom Wars and not made by the same company or anything.

65
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:29,967
Speaker 1: What's fascinating is they're almost identical games, but what I would say is that that game feels very similar to the first two Game Boy Advance Wars.

66
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,990
Speaker 1: that never made it to the US, just in how they play and the kinds of strategies you employ.

67
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:36,909
Speaker 1: All of them had super broken APCs.

68
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,810
Speaker 1: But yeah, this game's just delayed significantly, and like I said, I'm pretty fine with that.

69
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,129
Speaker 0: Oh, so there was a Super Famicom Wars for the SNES that might be worth playing.

70
00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:49,510
Speaker 0: That one.

71
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:51,780
Speaker 1: Ooh, I've never tried that one.

72
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,970
Speaker 1: I tried the Game Boy ones and a couple other ones.

73
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,719
Speaker 1: I've never played one that was SNES.

74
00:05:56,463 --> 00:05:57,790
Speaker 1: Now I'm a little curious.

75
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:01,590
Speaker 1: So anyway, some other slightly bigger news.

76
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:09,170
Speaker 1: As you know, Activision Blizzard is a troubled company filled with a significant number of dangerous people.

77
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,701
Speaker 1: We've talked about this.

78
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:11,529
Speaker 1: You can read about it.

79
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,550
Speaker 1: Activision Blizzard is not unique in this regard.

80
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:28,170
Speaker 1: Very similar stories have happened about Ubisoft, and pretty much every AAA studio has stories like this, though Blizzard and Ubisoft seem to have the most egregious of them that we know of, that I'm remembering recently.

81
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:31,310
Speaker 1: The bar's low, is what I'm saying, for AAA studios.

82
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:48,430
Speaker 1: So in that backdrop, despite the fact that Blizzard stock is way up because Call of Duty is selling fine and none of this stuff seems to have impacted game sales at all, they are canceling BlizzCon completely.

83
00:06:49,141 --> 00:07:00,230
Speaker 1: They issued a statement saying that there's no future date planned, they're not rescheduling it, it's just cancelled, and they're going to reinvent what BlizzCon is before it returns.

84
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,190
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's not a surprise, because what was BlizzCon, right?

85
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,650
Speaker 0: BlizzCon was just a very few things, right?

86
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,730
Speaker 0: It was an esports event, right?

87
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:22,890
Speaker 0: And a lot of their esports action has taken a hit, and even when their drama was barely starting, a lot of the people that were getting laid off there were esports people.

88
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:28,989
Speaker 1: Or people were just quitting who were the ones who were instrumental in the success of their esports up to that point.

89
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:38,548
Speaker 0: So other than Overwatch League, it really feels like that esports as a whole over there has sort of been neglected.

90
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:47,170
Speaker 0: It's not like they're not doing it anymore, but they used to be all in on it, and they've been less so as time has gone on.

91
00:07:47,432 --> 00:08:10,028
Speaker 1: I have anecdotal, now full disclosure, this is an anecdotal of one person and my very limited feed, but what I can say is that in my media feeds over the last year or so, how often Hearthstone was talked about went from this baseline level of there'd be some chatter on a nearly daily basis to "I never see anyone talking about Hearthstone

92
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:10,210
Speaker 1: anymore.".

93
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:14,609
Speaker 0: That's because I was playing it, and then I stopped playing it, and that's why the amount you heard about it went down.

94
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,070
Speaker 1: But you were not the only person I followed who would talk about Hearthstone, to be clear.

95
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,890
Speaker 1: But I do think that is a factor.

96
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,290
Speaker 0: That's probably the most significant factor.

97
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:32,890
Speaker 0: So the other thing BlizzCon is for is for basically announcing your shit with your panels, right?

98
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,211
Speaker 0: But A, the only thing they got coming is Diablo 4.

99
00:08:39,211 --> 00:08:54,369
Speaker 0: B, they just relaunched a bunch of stuff, because Activision Blizzard is one big umbrella, Losing so many people, a lot of their stuff is getting delayed, not coming, so they don't have as much to announce.

100
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:03,708
Speaker 0: And a lot of the people who are probably involved in the running of BlizzCon, it's losing people disrupted, probably, the event itself.

101
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:11,625
Speaker 0: So it's like, why spend all the money to have this thing, plus pandemic's not over, even if it's online only.

102
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:16,270
Speaker 0: There's no purpose to this event.

103
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,910
Speaker 0: Let's not spend our money on nothing and come back if we're going to have a convention.

104
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,750
Speaker 0: Not every company has their own convention.

105
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:29,205
Speaker 0: There's no UbisoftCon.

106
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:29,930
Speaker 0: that I'm aware of.

107
00:09:30,131 --> 00:09:36,710
Speaker 1: A lot of companies have a game-specific event, usually because of esports, or because it's a very, very well-known property.

108
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,969
Speaker 0: I guess QuakeCon, does that still exist?

109
00:09:38,391 --> 00:09:39,154
Speaker 1: I assume so.

110
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:42,610
Speaker 1: I mean, I only go to PAXes and MagFests, so what do I know?

111
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,270
Speaker 0: I don't know anything.

112
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:55,890
Speaker 1: Or they'll either use existing generic gaming conferences, they'll have a game-specific thing usually around an esport, but the franchise company-type event?

113
00:09:57,412 --> 00:10:05,090
Speaker 1: I feel like the Nintendo Direct is how you do that in the modern world, or the Tim Apple Roadshow is how you do that in the modern world.

114
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:18,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, Blizzard, to my knowledge, I've never seen them do that, so they could just have an Activision Blizzard Direct equivalent where they come out with a fancy keynote-type video every once in a while to announce their new shit on a regular basis.

115
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,470
Speaker 0: And that marketing strategy seems to work, actually.

116
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:25,133
Speaker 0: And you know what?

117
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:35,969
Speaker 0: I actually kind of like that marketing strategy, even though I hate ads, because it's not an ad that comes and interrupts you.

118
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,470
Speaker 0: It's not an ad that's on something.

119
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,110
Speaker 1: Well, it's an ad that I seek out.

120
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,469
Speaker 1: I go to Tim Apple and I say, "Tim, tell me about your

121
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,670
Speaker 1: shit.".

122
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:45,030
Speaker 0: Right, exactly.

123
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:54,829
Speaker 0: It's an ad, but there's in no way intrudes into your life in any way unless you purposefully go to watch it.

124
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,620
Speaker 0: They don't try to shove it at you in any way.

125
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,405
Speaker 0: And as an ad, it's not like a car ad.

126
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:09,609
Speaker 0: that's trying to use psychology and repetition and all the advertising marketing techniques to get in your head.

127
00:11:10,371 --> 00:11:11,241
Speaker 0: All of those, right?

128
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:20,588
Speaker 0: The Apple ones, with their magical, life-changing "get an Apple Watch so you don't die" stuff, they do a little bit of that.

129
00:11:21,553 --> 00:11:25,470
Speaker 1: At least I'm there like, "Yes, I do want to know what's up with Apple.

130
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,236
Speaker 1: Sell it to

131
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:26,378
Speaker 1: me.".

132
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:30,809
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's mostly just, "Here are our new products.

133
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:32,487
Speaker 0: Here's what they do.

134
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,770
Speaker 0: You didn't even have to watch this.

135
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,490
Speaker 0: You could have just read an article summary afterwards.

136
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,208
Speaker 0: The end.

137
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:44,130
Speaker 0: And we're going to do this again when we have more products to announce.

138
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,087
Speaker 0: And if you don't care about our products, you wouldn't be even watching this right now in the first

139
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:48,369
Speaker 0: place.".

140
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:54,160
Speaker 0: So it's like, if you're a company, and even if I had my way, "Ban all ads on Earth,".

141
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,949
Speaker 0: companies still need to announce their products somehow.

142
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:02,679
Speaker 0: If you make something, you need to tell everyone, "Hey, I made this thing.

143
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:02,963
Speaker 0: It's for

144
00:12:03,044 --> 00:12:03,288
Speaker 0: sale.".

145
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,159
Speaker 1: But you know what this is?

146
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,050
Speaker 1: This is one hand.

147
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,370
Speaker 1: Old-style advertising that was in the early days before people did it.

148
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:13,510
Speaker 1: the way they do it today, it was often just, "Here's a product.

149
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,290
Speaker 1: It almost reads like a press release.

150
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,601
Speaker 1: Here are all of its features.

151
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:17,470
Speaker 1: Here's its price.

152
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,780
Speaker 1: Here's how to find out

153
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:18,921
Speaker 1: more.".

154
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:24,309
Speaker 0: A Nintendo Direct is literally just like, "Here are the games coming out soon.

155
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,421
Speaker 0: Let us show you them.

156
00:12:25,441 --> 00:12:25,947
Speaker 0: This one.

157
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,237
Speaker 0: Also this one.

158
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:27,746
Speaker 0: Check out this

159
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:27,929
Speaker 0: one.".

160
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:46,590
Speaker 1: But I think another thing that happens here, especially with an event like BlizzCon, gaming events like this tend to, once they get going, it's hard to start a new one, but once you've got one going, momentum almost can carry it forward with surprisingly little surprise or additional costs.

161
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:58,170
Speaker 1: The incremental cost of making another PAX or another BlizzCon is so little compared to the cost of making the first one that it's easy to just keep going.

162
00:12:59,255 --> 00:13:12,845
Speaker 0: Once you have attendance, getting the attendance is hard, but once you have attendance, let's say you get an event and a thousand people show up, you have close to a thousand people who, if you have that event again next year, will show up.

163
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:15,990
Speaker 1: It can't just be the attendance.

164
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:23,426
Speaker 1: You also have the production pipeline, the system and bureaucracy that causes the event to actually occur.

165
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:29,103
Speaker 1: Because some events have attendance and not logistics, and that is how you get a DashCon.

166
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:35,730
Speaker 0: We talk about that all the time with anything that you want to do in the world.

167
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:40,310
Speaker 0: You can do a thing by hand and handcraft a thing, but then that's it.

168
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,008
Speaker 0: You did it once.

169
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,389
Speaker 0: Alternatively, you can create a machine that makes the thing.

170
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,349
Speaker 0: If you build a machine that runs a convention, that convention is just going to keep happening.

171
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:55,669
Speaker 0: If you, on your own, make a convention happen with your will, you might do it.

172
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,650
Speaker 0: You can't repeat that without hurting yourself.

173
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:05,990
Speaker 1: In fact, we low-key would hurt ourselves dealing with the lack of logistics at certain conventions in the past.

174
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:14,770
Speaker 0: If you want to make a movie, you could grab a camera and your friends sweat blood and tears and make a movie.

175
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:16,284
Speaker 0: A lot of people have done it.

176
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:24,549
Speaker 0: But if you make a movie studio, and you get it off the ground, which is the hard part, it'll just keep making movies.

177
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:28,890
Speaker 0: As long as it makes a successful movie, it'll make another one.

178
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,310
Speaker 0: It'll just keep getting contracts to make more movies.

179
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,589
Speaker 1: It's that very powerful idea that the most valuable thing you can make is the machine that makes the machine, not the machine itself.

180
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,890
Speaker 1: But the other thing that happens is once that ball's rolling, it has that momentum.

181
00:14:44,733 --> 00:14:50,450
Speaker 1: If you want to change something significant about your event, the risks are nearly infinite.

182
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,607
Speaker 1: Imagine if PAX wanted to radically change some aspect of PAX.

183
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,270
Speaker 1: How will the attendees react?

184
00:14:57,453 --> 00:14:58,629
Speaker 1: How will the logistics go?

185
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,929
Speaker 1: Who do we need to involve?

186
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,909
Speaker 1: We have less than a year to make this change because the last PAX just happened.

187
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:13,989
Speaker 0: But anyway, Blizzard had a machine that made Blizzcons and they intentionally turned it off, at least temporarily, and we'll see what comes of that.

188
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,004
Speaker 1: But it's the perfect time to do that.

189
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:21,370
Speaker 1: if you're a company and a convention can't survive multiple separate disasters simultaneously.

190
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,036
Speaker 1: There's so many things that make Blizzcon a bad idea.

191
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,763
Speaker 1: It's literally the perfect time to just pause long enough to take that machine and try to rework it.

192
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:31,770
Speaker 1: So we'll see what comes of it.

193
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,390
Speaker 1: We'll also see what comes of the ongoing litigation around Activision Blizzard.

194
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:42,110
Speaker 1: And I cannot stress enough, don't pretend that this is the only bad guy company out there, all these AAA game studios.

195
00:15:42,211 --> 00:15:44,486
Speaker 0: Every single one of them is the same, right?

196
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,082
Speaker 0: Is it a company that makes AAA games?

197
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:48,617
Speaker 0: Yes.

198
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,530
Speaker 0: Then I assume it is guilty of all the same crimes as Activision Blizzard.

199
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:52,995
Speaker 1: Yep.

200
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,935
Speaker 1: So got a little, little news here.

201
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:59,076
Speaker 1: I don't know why this was news, but it popped up in my feed from two different sources.

202
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:00,854
Speaker 1: So I thought this was funny.

203
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:12,790
Speaker 1: Multiple sources have confirmed that you can't use, quote, "rumble packs" or other accessories, unquote, with the new Switch-compatible N64 wireless controller.

204
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:20,070
Speaker 0: That makes no sense, because the N64 wireless controller that you... So just so people are aware of what this is, right?

205
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:26,554
Speaker 0: So if you get a Switch, you get Joy-Cons, or you can buy a Switch Pro controller, or you can buy a third-party controller, right?

206
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:28,090
Speaker 0: Those are pretty much your options.

207
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:36,959
Speaker 0: But if you pay for Nintendo Switch online service, right, you get those NES, SNES, and now if you pay even more, N64 games.

208
00:16:37,604 --> 00:16:42,499
Speaker 0: So they will sell you, if you have the service already, they will sell you an NES controller.

209
00:16:42,662 --> 00:16:43,108
Speaker 0: I have one.

210
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:57,342
Speaker 0: And it's literally just a wireless NES controller, just like the ones from back in the day, but it works with your Switch with Bluetooth immediately and perfectly, and you can pretty much use it for the NES game thing, right?

211
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:58,414
Speaker 0: It's not too useful.

212
00:16:58,474 --> 00:17:00,880
Speaker 0: You could try to play a Switch game with it, but it doesn't have enough buttons.

213
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:04,148
Speaker 0: And they also sell a Super Nintendo one that does the same thing.

214
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:07,118
Speaker 0: And now they sell an N64 one that does the same thing.

215
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,738
Speaker 0: It's an N64 controller, except it's wireless and works with your Switch.

216
00:17:11,122 --> 00:17:11,869
Speaker 0: It's sold separately.

217
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:12,955
Speaker 0: There you go.

218
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:19,498
Speaker 0: Why would you want to use a rumble pack with it when it has rumble built in?

219
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,136
Speaker 0: It's a modern controller.

220
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,450
Speaker 0: It has its own fucking rumble.

221
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,829
Speaker 0: It doesn't need a rumble pack.

222
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:33,037
Speaker 1: And if you didn't think that was obvious, why would Nintendo in the year 2021 manufacture a new controller that didn't just use a standard rumble pack built into it?

223
00:17:33,765 --> 00:17:43,500
Speaker 0: And why would they bother to go through the hassle of making it compatible with rumble packs from the late 90s when almost no one fucking has one of those things?

224
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,410
Speaker 0: Never mind.

225
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:47,729
Speaker 1: What the fuck else do you think you're gonna plug into that thing?

226
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:59,198
Speaker 0: And if it didn't have rumble in it, and it required people to get a rumble pack, and they weren't manufacturing new rumble packs, who the fuck would go- there'd be a run on old rumble packs, who the fuck would go and buy- get those.

227
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:07,502
Speaker 1: But like what, are you gonna plug- are you gonna plug that like weird memory card into it, thinking you can transfer a save game from the Switch port, and like a real N64?

228
00:18:07,563 --> 00:18:13,421
Speaker 1: Like, what would- what does anyone involved in these stories think was going to happen?

229
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:16,086
Speaker 0: Someone just asked a really foolish question.

230
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:25,039
Speaker 0: It's like you know, if you really want to use an N64 controller to play the games on the Switch, the N64 games, go ahead and buy this thing, 'cause that's what it does.

231
00:18:25,261 --> 00:18:25,444
Speaker 0: Yeah.

232
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,885
Speaker 0: Um, just don't ask nonsense questions.

233
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:28,612
Speaker 1: I love how.

234
00:18:28,652 --> 00:18:31,641
Speaker 1: the first comment on this article is, "I was hoping to have double

235
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:32,044
Speaker 1: rumble.".

236
00:18:32,994 --> 00:18:33,685
Speaker 0: Double rumble?

237
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:33,950
Speaker 0: Okay.

238
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:39,261
Speaker 0: I could- I could go with that, but if you want double rumble, just get the- the rez, you know, the famous rez thing.

239
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:39,849
Speaker 1: Yep.

240
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:49,049
Speaker 1: And uh, one last little news, uh, so, the new Switch, the OLED Switch came out, and so far, it seems like outside of Japan, it's not actually selling that well.

241
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,589
Speaker 1: Probably because everyone who wanted a Switch already has a Switch that works fine, is my guess.

242
00:18:55,953 --> 00:19:09,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, and even so, a lot of people who might buy a Switch, right, will go to the store, look at the Switches, and if you're not like a nerd, what do you care, fucking OLED for extra- it's extra money, right?

243
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:13,408
Speaker 0: And you can't fucking tell the difference unless you're a huge nerd who knows what OLED is.

244
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:18,780
Speaker 0: Um, so if you're giving it to a kid, why- why the fuck would you pay for the OLED ones?

245
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,123
Speaker 0: You know, it still doesn't make- the old one is still there.

246
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:32,536
Speaker 0: So, you know, it's- it- for the OLED, you want to eat into sales of the old one, you need, A, people who broke a Switch, like if my Switch broke, I'd probably buy the OLED one, right?

247
00:19:32,961 --> 00:19:35,022
Speaker 0: But, most people, who knows?

248
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:42,194
Speaker 0: Or, extreme nerds who care a lot, and use their Switch a lot, and are way into it, will like, upgrade to that new one.

249
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:47,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, but like, Nintendo's stock was down a little, and a lot of people were saying, "Oh, this is a miss from Nintendo,".

250
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,989
Speaker 1: or like, "Hey, turns out people didn't care about the OLED,".

251
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,890
Speaker 1: and everyone's forgetting.

252
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:58,134
Speaker 1: They did not- like, Nintendo very clearly did not make this as, like, an upgrade to an existing, perfectly good Switch.

253
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:04,359
Speaker 0: Right, it's not- it's not a fumble like with the new 3DS, where like, yeah, there were hardly any games, right?

254
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:14,075
Speaker 1: This is just more like, alright, we're gonna use a better, more modern production pipeline to make an incrementally better product, instead of maintaining the pipeline that made the old one.

255
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,270
Speaker 1: They're probably either saving money, or have better margins, there's a lot of reasons why they manufacture this.

256
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:26,636
Speaker 0: Hardware has chipped, you know, new chips are out, you know, the world has changed, these parts are cheaper, right?

257
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:44,515
Speaker 0: It's, you know, let's make this, you know, let's change our stuff at the factory, and we're gonna have to produce Switches differently, for reasons at factories, so now we're producing this Switch instead, hey, let's take advantage of that and market it as an upgraded thing because, yeah, we're using a different screen in there, you know.

258
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,377
Speaker 0: It's not like.

259
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:51,105
Speaker 0: they went out and they said, "Ah, this is our strategy to make more money, we're gonna make this OLED Switch,

260
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:51,509
Speaker 0: yeah!".

261
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:54,017
Speaker 0: That wasn't the start of the, right?

262
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:54,485
Speaker 0: That was the-.

263
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:02,189
Speaker 1: If anything, I think it speaks to Nintendo's strength, that they are committing to a long lifespan for the extremely popular Nintendo Switch.

264
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:12,489
Speaker 1: So, anyone who says this is bad news for Nintendo or for Nintendo gamers, is probably the same kind of person who thought that this was gonna be a 4K Switch.

265
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,829
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

266
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:32,463
Speaker 1: So, this is a video of a match between Peru and Alemanias of Germany, and this is the Balloon World Cup.

267
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:45,680
Speaker 1: If you've never played the game Balloon, it is one of the rare games, it's a sport, and it's a game and a sport, that has, it's one of the rare instances of having absolutely perfect rules where I would change nothing.

268
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,867
Speaker 0: It is a game where you have two people and everyone just knows the rules as soon as they're born.

269
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:52,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, every kid plays this.

270
00:21:52,664 --> 00:21:54,949
Speaker 0: You don't even need to be told the rules, you just know them.

271
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:59,940
Speaker 1: In fact, if you watch this video, I defy you to make it more than five.

272
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:08,769
Speaker 1: let's see, exactly, 'cause including every possible edge case, you will not make it more than three seconds into this video without knowing literally every rule to this game.

273
00:22:09,334 --> 00:22:16,352
Speaker 1: The game is, there's a balloon, not filled with helium, just filled with regular old air, and you hit it.

274
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:22,607
Speaker 1: If it touches the ground, before your opponent hits it, you win, or you get a point.

275
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:25,900
Speaker 1: And, you just try to keep this balloon in the air as long as possible.

276
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:33,840
Speaker 0: This game is- And you alternate taking turns, hitting the balloon, and I don't know what happens if it pops, according to the rules.

277
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:35,199
Speaker 1: I do also not know what happens if it pops.

278
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,950
Speaker 0: I could look it up, though.

279
00:22:37,707 --> 00:22:41,560
Speaker 1: The rule we used as kids was whoever touched it last loses if it pops.

280
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:42,913
Speaker 0: Could be.

281
00:22:44,005 --> 00:22:44,980
Speaker 0: Okay, acceptable rule.

282
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:50,438
Speaker 1: The other rule that might not be super obvious is you can't interfere with the other person.

283
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:53,519
Speaker 0: It's not a contact sport.

284
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,433
Speaker 1: But you can hit this thing anywhere.

285
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:58,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

286
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:02,046
Speaker 1: So, I would love to see this just straight up be the omega-thon finale.

287
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,166
Speaker 0: I guess you also can't, like, grab the balloon, right?

288
00:23:04,187 --> 00:23:05,499
Speaker 0: You have to strike it.

289
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,085
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, volleyball has rules like that.

290
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:17,499
Speaker 1: A lot of sports have rules where you can't carry, even tennis, you can't carry the ball in your racket, even though- Basketball pretends to have rules like that.

291
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,086
Speaker 0: I will admit- Soccer does, too.

292
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:26,993
Speaker 1: I'm gonna admit right now, I have cheated a little bit at ping pong in the past.

293
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,694
Speaker 1: I was real good at doing a carry so fast that no one could see.

294
00:23:30,714 --> 00:23:31,299
Speaker 1: that's what I did.

295
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,208
Speaker 1: I think if you went to real ping pong, you would be- Oh, yeah, they would catch me, but at a bar or something, no one would ever see that.

296
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, drunken people, though.

297
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:42,758
Speaker 0: Would that even help you, though, at ping pong?

298
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:55,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, because what I can do, especially if it works against someone who's moving slow, is I can basically swing the racket around to catch the ball, push it forward, but while it's still in contact, rotate, and then push it down.

299
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,844
Speaker 1: I basically do a straight, almost a straight down slam.

300
00:24:00,127 --> 00:24:02,259
Speaker 1: that doesn't look like it's gonna be a slam until the last second.

301
00:24:03,862 --> 00:24:05,280
Speaker 1: It's of dubious legality.

302
00:24:07,503 --> 00:24:08,499
Speaker 1: So, what do you got?

303
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:10,489
Speaker 0: What do I have?

304
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,591
Speaker 0: So, we may have used this YouTube channel before as a thing of the day.

305
00:24:14,631 --> 00:24:18,732
Speaker 0: They have lots of experts in various things and ask them questions, right?

306
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:21,014
Speaker 0: Or have Twitter come and ask them questions.

307
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:24,518
Speaker 0: I think there was a CIA guy on there sometime or something, right?

308
00:24:26,101 --> 00:24:43,217
Speaker 0: However, a video appeared, thanks to YouTube recommendations, from this wired tech support channel, and this time, the expert person was a poison expert, and it's like, "Whoa, I'm actually gonna find out for real about

309
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:43,540
Speaker 0: poison.".

310
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:47,239
Speaker 0: And, yeah, you find out for real about poison.

311
00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:52,310
Speaker 0: Some of the information is sort of obvious and basic stuff that you know.

312
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:56,840
Speaker 0: isn't that fascinating, but some of the information is very fascinating.

313
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:05,076
Speaker 0: And there were also many myths debunked or bunked, I guess would be the opposite term.

314
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:22,400
Speaker 0: you know, I guess watching this video, you could I guess, you know, if you're very unlucky, this information in this video could help you or someone nearby you survive poisoning.

315
00:25:23,805 --> 00:25:25,200
Speaker 0: Or fall to poisoning.

316
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,669
Speaker 0: Please don't poison anybody for real, but only joke about poisoning people like I do.

317
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,539
Speaker 0: You'll never actually poison anybody.

318
00:25:32,924 --> 00:25:37,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, stay away when a weird girl tries to give you shaved ice as well.

319
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:44,252
Speaker 0: One spoiler, I guess, is this person did answer one question exactly the same way.

320
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,284
Speaker 0: I would have answered it.

321
00:25:45,325 --> 00:25:50,271
Speaker 0: They were asked, effectively, the question was, "How do I tell the poison mushroom from the real

322
00:25:50,312 --> 00:25:50,675
Speaker 0: mushroom?".

323
00:25:51,361 --> 00:25:54,980
Speaker 0: And my brain started saying, "If it's at the grocery

324
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:55,868
Speaker 0: store.".

325
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:02,914
Speaker 0: And then the woman said in the video, "If it's at the grocery store, it's a safe mushroom to eat.

326
00:26:03,035 --> 00:26:04,353
Speaker 0: Otherwise, don't eat

327
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:04,498
Speaker 0: it.".

328
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,084
Speaker 0: Did I say this

329
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:21,939
Speaker 1: on Geek Nights or just say it to you, but when we were hiking, me and Emily were hiking a few weeks ago, we passed a couple arguing in Russian, and the dude was holding up a big mushroom that he'd clearly picked, and it looked like he was arguing that they could eat it, and the woman was arguing with him that that is a terrible idea and trying to get him to throw it away.

330
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:23,960
Speaker 0: Do not eat the mushroom.

331
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,637
Speaker 0: Is that mushroom from the grocery store?

332
00:26:26,758 --> 00:26:26,939
Speaker 0: No?

333
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,750
Speaker 0: Should you eat the mushroom?

334
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:32,138
Speaker 0: Those questions have the same answer at all times.

335
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:39,122
Speaker 1: There is no, I mean, I'm glad there are people who exist who we trust to do this.

336
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:46,920
Speaker 1: for grocery stores, because I, there is no amount of research, study, and training I would do where I would personally eat a mushroom I picked under any circumstances.

337
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 0: Well, the mushrooms, also, the mushrooms at the grocery store are not harvested from the forest, right?

338
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:52,475
Speaker 0: Some of them are.

339
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,929
Speaker 0: At least, not where you live.

340
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:54,840
Speaker 0: Not where we're here, right?

341
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,994
Speaker 0: They're from a mushroom growing place that's growing them.

342
00:26:58,055 --> 00:26:58,340
Speaker 1: No!

343
00:26:58,821 --> 00:27:01,830
Speaker 1: A lot more mushrooms than you expect.

344
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,195
Speaker 1: Not like creminis or anything, but like, I get a lot of mushrooms from Fresh Direct and from the grocery store that are foraged.

345
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,596
Speaker 0: Mmm, how do you know?

346
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,674
Speaker 1: They're specifically foraged.

347
00:27:12,715 --> 00:27:15,140
Speaker 1: A lot of mushrooms can't be grown in mushroom groweries.

348
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,340
Speaker 1: I don't know what the term is for that kind of place.

349
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,440
Speaker 0: That doesn't seem possible.

350
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,760
Speaker 0: I could figure out a way.

351
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:31,080
Speaker 1: There was just a SciShow episode on this like, a few months ago, talking about all the unfarmables that, basically, there are a bunch of foods, many of them are mushrooms.

352
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:36,418
Speaker 1: You could be infinitely rich if you could figure out how to grow these as opposed to foraging them.

353
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,572
Speaker 0: Just take one that already exists and shit all its spores all over some dirt.

354
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:43,340
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, guess what?

355
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,653
Speaker 1: Turns out that doesn't work.

356
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:50,497
Speaker 1: Some of these only grow in a particular kind of tree that's beyond a certain age that only grows in certain soil and weird crap like that.

357
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,839
Speaker 0: So get that tree in that soil and buy that land.

358
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:55,883
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

359
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,259
Speaker 1: If it were that easy, a lot of these things would be a lot cheaper, but they're not.

360
00:28:01,562 --> 00:28:01,946
Speaker 0: Anyway.

361
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:11,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, I do not trust mushrooms foraged by anyone other than an expert via a large commercial pipeline with lots of liability involved.

362
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:13,032
Speaker 0: Yeah.

363
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:13,805
Speaker 0: Poison is cool.

364
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,038
Speaker 0: Let's move on.

365
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:21,300
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, in the meta moment, the Geek Knives Book Club book, which I have paused to read the first volume of a manga.

366
00:28:22,806 --> 00:28:23,298
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

367
00:28:23,681 --> 00:28:28,458
Speaker 1: But, uh, the tale of Genji, as Genji just continues to sleepwalk and/or fuck his way through life.

368
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:30,755
Speaker 1: It's the first novel.

369
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,719
Speaker 0: You're gonna say that same thing every time there.

370
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,620
Speaker 1: I mean, unless we talk about specific instances of it, which we should say for the book club book episode.

371
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:48,211
Speaker 0: Uh, I think what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to basically, you know, as I'm reading, I'm trying to take a note just like, you know, there's what, 50-something chapters.

372
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:52,310
Speaker 0: I'm basically trying to write, like, one sentence for each chapter.

373
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:54,638
Speaker 1: That's a real good idea for a book like this.

374
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:56,414
Speaker 1: Like, that's where the ghost killed a girl.

375
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:58,474
Speaker 1: That's where he had sex with the wrong woman.

376
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,620
Speaker 1: That's the other time he had sex with the wrong woman.

377
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,232
Speaker 0: That's where so-and-so died.

378
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:03,778
Speaker 0: That's where a bunch of people died.

379
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:09,848
Speaker 1: But, uh, yeah, otherwise, our last panel is still just on YouTube.

380
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:10,739
Speaker 1: It's our game design.

381
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:15,871
Speaker 1: It'll always be on YouTube, but I guess you should watch it because we spend a lot of time making it.

382
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:21,179
Speaker 1: Stay tuned for, I guess, Q2 2022 when I'll start streaming Advance Wars.

383
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:25,280
Speaker 1: And, uh, yeah, we found someone to help us build our website.

384
00:29:25,642 --> 00:29:32,920
Speaker 1: So, if you were thinking about applying to that job, you can hold off for the time being unless things go horribly wrong in the near future.

385
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:36,351
Speaker 0: I guess that's not impossible, but it doesn't seem likely.

386
00:29:36,412 --> 00:29:38,173
Speaker 0: We're gonna make some progress here.

387
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:42,269
Speaker 0: I actually, if you go to, you can proof that I've worked on this, right?

388
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:47,848
Speaker 0: You can go to beta.frontrowcrew.com, and you'll see the words beta.frontrowcrew.com there.

389
00:29:49,564 --> 00:30:03,217
Speaker 0: Uh, which I know isn't exciting, but there is actually a complex, yeah, there is actually a complex back end of technology with databases and such and whatnot behind that single tiny HTML file.

390
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:05,397
Speaker 0: So, progress has been made.

391
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,245
Speaker 1: Wait, I'm gonna break the law in red states.

392
00:30:08,286 --> 00:30:09,235
Speaker 1: I'm gonna view page source.

393
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:09,740
Speaker 1: Oh, look at that.

394
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,488
Speaker 1: Some HTML.

395
00:30:11,137 --> 00:30:11,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

396
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:17,419
Speaker 0: And if you go to newsletter.frontrowcrew.com, there is a live, new newsletter platform.

397
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,620
Speaker 0: Uh, I switched us over from tiny letter, and I'll finish writing a newsletter at some point.

398
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,248
Speaker 0: Who knows?

399
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:24,979
Speaker 0: This year?

400
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,240
Speaker 1: Scott writes good newsletters.

401
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:28,143
Speaker 0: A year?

402
00:30:28,183 --> 00:30:28,447
Speaker 0: Yeah.

403
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,064
Speaker 0: Never?

404
00:30:30,084 --> 00:30:33,679
Speaker 0: But I just move it over to a new platform and then never use it?

405
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,460
Speaker 1: Hey, but every now and then one comes out.

406
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,166
Speaker 1: They're always good.

407
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:37,620
Speaker 0: But it's live.

408
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,284
Speaker 0: There's a thing.

409
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:38,831
Speaker 0: I did that.

410
00:30:39,053 --> 00:30:39,580
Speaker 0: I did something.

411
00:30:39,902 --> 00:30:40,044
Speaker 0: Yeah.

412
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:40,916
Speaker 0: That wasn't shit talk.

413
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,579
Speaker 0: I successfully moved it to a new platform, so.

414
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,558
Speaker 1: So, let's get right into it.

415
00:30:46,700 --> 00:31:02,443
Speaker 1: Splitgate is basically a free to play multiplayer first person shooter deathmatch++, because it has a lot of modes, crossed with Portal the game, where you can throw two portals anywhere in the world with constraints and just move between them.

416
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:03,251
Speaker 0: Yeah.

417
00:31:03,312 --> 00:31:07,300
Speaker 0: So, in Portal the game came out in a long time ago already.

418
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:08,627
Speaker 0: Yeah.

419
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:15,093
Speaker 0: When that game came out, everyone, the obvious thought was well, obviously.

420
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:15,840
Speaker 0: 2007.

421
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,140
Speaker 1: Geek Knights had been running for less than two years.

422
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:20,907
Speaker 0: So, the same year that we came out basically.

423
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:30,140
Speaker 0: So, when that came out, the obvious thought was, oh, obviously, you're going to make a multiplayer FPS, where everyone also has a portal gun and a gun gun.

424
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:31,168
Speaker 0: That's all I wanted.

425
00:31:31,875 --> 00:31:33,997
Speaker 0: That's such a brain dead thing, right?

426
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:40,826
Speaker 0: Because Portal and Portal 2 were obviously just puzzle platform FPSs with no gun, no shooting and killing really.

427
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:52,200
Speaker 0: And they even teased heavily that Half-Life 3 or Half-Life 2 episode 2, 3, whatever it was going to be, 3, I get the episode.

428
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:52,935
Speaker 0: that never came out.

429
00:31:54,303 --> 00:32:04,059
Speaker 0: It was heavily implied that that would be a single player FPS, where you had a portal gun, presumably also the gravity gun, and gun guns.

430
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,546
Speaker 0: But, of course, that never came to be.

431
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:10,893
Speaker 0: And probably will never come to be.

432
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:16,766
Speaker 0: So, this obvious idea for an amazing multiplayer game was just out there for free.

433
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,948
Speaker 0: Anyone could do it at any time.

434
00:32:18,969 --> 00:32:22,608
Speaker 0: I believe there may have been prior attempts to do it.

435
00:32:23,337 --> 00:32:31,535
Speaker 0: But, until now, with the release of Splitgate, no one has, this is like the biggest, most for real attempt there has been.

436
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:36,825
Speaker 0: It is a multiplayer FPS, where you have the portal gun, and you have gun guns.

437
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,503
Speaker 0: And you shoot the other team.

438
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:46,586
Speaker 1: Now, part of this might have been that the technology that drove Portal did not scale well to multiple players.

439
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:47,555
Speaker 1: It was designed...

440
00:32:47,575 --> 00:32:48,464
Speaker 0: It could have been done.

441
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,616
Speaker 0: There had to be a way.

442
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:52,711
Speaker 1: I think it would have been a significant rewrite to make that happen.

443
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:53,296
Speaker 0: Regardless...

444
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:10,000
Speaker 1: The other thing is, Portal, the portals themselves were, while the technology that made that happen were cool, the real magic of Portal was the insane amount of detail that went into the puzzles and the environments to make the portals fun and interesting.

445
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:18,819
Speaker 1: And, I just imagine the game design challenge of making it that polished for the multiplayer experience, especially a deathmatching multiplayer experience.

446
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:23,961
Speaker 0: You never need to make it... I think that's the flawed thinking, right?

447
00:33:23,981 --> 00:33:27,074
Speaker 0: Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good enough, right?

448
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:34,267
Speaker 0: It's like, you could have just taken fucking Quake Deathmatch, not changed a damn thing, other than, oh yeah, there's a portal gun now in addition to the other guns.

449
00:33:34,368 --> 00:33:36,993
Speaker 1: And then just watch how people play it and see what happens and iterate from there.

450
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, just fucking go for it, right?

451
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,099
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

452
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,525
Speaker 1: I mean, how did Quake Deathmatch evolve?

453
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:46,457
Speaker 1: They just made it, they threw it out there, and then they iterated on it as people fucked with it and enjoyed it.

454
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:49,080
Speaker 0: So, Splitgate, what's the deal with Splitgate?

455
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:58,719
Speaker 0: So, in Splitgate, the portal gun, the most important part, the way it works is you have two different buttons for the two different portals, right?

456
00:33:59,422 --> 00:34:00,392
Speaker 0: Just like regular Portal.

457
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:02,331
Speaker 0: There are only some surfaces.

458
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:04,553
Speaker 0: you can put them on, just like regular Portal.

459
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:09,444
Speaker 0: You can see through the portal to the other side only if it's your portal.

460
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:17,120
Speaker 0: You can't see through other people's portals, but you can walk through them assuming they're linked up and not just a half portal with no other end to them.

461
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,503
Speaker 1: Yep, like you can throw one of your portals somewhere and then just not throw the other one until you're ready.

462
00:34:21,523 --> 00:34:24,391
Speaker 0: Or someone could erase one end.

463
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,179
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that.

464
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:27,543
Speaker 0: You can walk through the portal.

465
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:30,068
Speaker 0: You can shoot through the portal.

466
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:32,149
Speaker 0: Even if it's not yours, you can shoot through it.

467
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,956
Speaker 0: You might not be able to see what the hell you're shooting on the other side.

468
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:38,230
Speaker 0: You might be wasting ammo, but you can shoot through it.

469
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:58,652
Speaker 0: So, for example, you can put one of your portals way high up in the level and put another one in a tiny room where you're hiding and now you can snipe at the whole level from a tiny room and if someone wants to shoot you, they can come find you or they can just shoot in this portal that's prominently above the whole level and that they can see bullets coming out of and killing their friend.

470
00:34:58,672 --> 00:35:00,653
Speaker 1: And that you're probably standing right in front of.

471
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:01,846
Speaker 1: Your head's just right there.

472
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:04,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they shoot at the portal, they're gonna hit you.

473
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:07,200
Speaker 0: So, it's not that great.

474
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:11,927
Speaker 0: It works, but it's not some unbeatable camping strat, right?

475
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:15,180
Speaker 0: And then, as I mentioned, you can get rid of portals.

476
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Speaker 0: There's a grenade you have and the grenade doesn't hurt anybody, sadly.

477
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:24,433
Speaker 0: But if you throw a grenade at a portal, whether it's yours or someone else's, it erases it.

478
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:27,020
Speaker 1: And you can really wing these things.

479
00:35:27,302 --> 00:35:28,980
Speaker 1: You can wing that grenade all across the mat.

480
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda.

481
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,079
Speaker 0: A little bit.

482
00:35:31,665 --> 00:35:35,260
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's like if someone's running away from you and there's a portal, they're running towards the portal.

483
00:35:35,361 --> 00:35:38,660
Speaker 0: just throw the grenade, they'll just bump into the wall and then you shoot them, right?

484
00:35:39,322 --> 00:35:40,279
Speaker 0: That kind of thing happens.

485
00:35:41,923 --> 00:35:44,633
Speaker 1: So, this game is pretty fun.

486
00:35:44,714 --> 00:35:45,584
Speaker 1: Like, we've been playing it.

487
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,038
Speaker 1: Not a ton, but we've been playing it.

488
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:53,039
Speaker 1: And, like Scott said, it's not perfect, but it does what we thought it would do.

489
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,979
Speaker 1: It is an FPS where you're just doing multiplayer competitive with a million different modes with portals.

490
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,210
Speaker 0: But, you have a little jetpack.

491
00:36:02,392 --> 00:36:05,200
Speaker 0: It's not like the tribes jetpack, but it's a little like a double jump.

492
00:36:05,821 --> 00:36:07,358
Speaker 0: It's like double jump plus, right?

493
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,200
Speaker 1: But that's not in every mode either.

494
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:15,159
Speaker 1: The interesting thing about this game is that it has a million, million, million modes.

495
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,896
Speaker 0: Way more modes.

496
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,604
Speaker 0: I think rather than try to figure out which mode was the best mode, they're just like, let's put in all the modes.

497
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:26,533
Speaker 0: Let people vote and decide which mode they want to play.

498
00:36:26,574 --> 00:36:27,808
Speaker 0: Well, you know the story behind this game?

499
00:36:27,828 --> 00:36:30,010
Speaker 1: Because I think it's one oh four seven games.

500
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:31,908
Speaker 1: It's a pretty small shop.

501
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,480
Speaker 1: They made the original game with no funding.

502
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:36,680
Speaker 1: Just by themselves.

503
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,006
Speaker 1: And then they put a demo out.

504
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:42,453
Speaker 1: People liked it.

505
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:47,825
Speaker 1: They announced actually over the summer that it was going to be indefinitely in a beta state.

506
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:51,060
Speaker 1: And they're basically tweaking it constantly as far as we can see, even now.

507
00:36:51,601 --> 00:36:54,058
Speaker 1: There's a significant update that just happened.

508
00:36:55,961 --> 00:36:58,927
Speaker 0: Definitely feels like it's sort of in that Rocket League category.

509
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,452
Speaker 0: It's obviously not as popular and big as Rocket League.

510
00:37:01,492 --> 00:37:05,492
Speaker 0: And I don't think it's as fresh and amazing as Rocket League.

511
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:15,428
Speaker 0: So I don't know if it deserves that amount of popularity, but it's that multiplayer competitive game that has some uniqueness and isn't AAA amazingness.

512
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,478
Speaker 0: But if you load it up and start playing it, it's like, wow, this is a really polished kind of game here.

513
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,679
Speaker 0: It's really got something going on.

514
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,345
Speaker 1: I guess it's almost got too much going on.

515
00:37:26,365 --> 00:37:28,487
Speaker 1: that isn't the game itself.

516
00:37:28,588 --> 00:37:35,020
Speaker 1: So this game is a modern game, meaning it has a ton of cosmetic crap.

517
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:41,134
Speaker 1: It has all these different ways to level up your character and your stats and all this nonsense.

518
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:43,879
Speaker 1: It has quick play and competitive and a million modes.

519
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:54,931
Speaker 1: But whereas AAA first person shooters tend to refine those down to a limited number of ladders and a limited number of modes, this is still just a proliferation of a million, million things.

520
00:37:55,517 --> 00:37:57,399
Speaker 1: And two, it is free to play.

521
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,666
Speaker 1: Completely free.

522
00:37:58,687 --> 00:37:59,596
Speaker 1: You can just play it.

523
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:04,559
Speaker 1: And as far as I can see, there's nothing you have to pay for that matters.

524
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:06,792
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are not.

525
00:38:07,095 --> 00:38:08,679
Speaker 0: It's not pay to win, so that's good.

526
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:10,732
Speaker 0: If it was, I wouldn't play it.

527
00:38:10,853 --> 00:38:11,216
Speaker 1: Not at all.

528
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:12,710
Speaker 1: Wouldn't have even considered touching it.

529
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,419
Speaker 0: But if you want to pay, there are a lot of ways you can give them money.

530
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:25,319
Speaker 0: I haven't even looked at how many different currencies and different ways you can earn points and XPs and currencies and things.

531
00:38:25,922 --> 00:38:36,065
Speaker 0: And you can spend them on getting skins for your character, for your guns, just all kinds of things that you can skin up all over the place.

532
00:38:36,085 --> 00:38:39,720
Speaker 0: So much cosmetic microtransactions.

533
00:38:40,749 --> 00:38:43,159
Speaker 0: You're just like Team Fortress 2 with the hats, right?

534
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,980
Speaker 1: It got to the point to where I consciously decided I won't even click on that stuff because clicking around it was almost too confusing.

535
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,598
Speaker 1: There's just so much in there.

536
00:38:53,905 --> 00:39:03,562
Speaker 0: Half of the main menu screen, almost all the buttons on there have something to do with rewards or XP or skins or gun skins.

537
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:06,900
Speaker 1: Oh my god, every time we finish a match, it's like, you got three achievements.

538
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,029
Speaker 1: Here's three different beaters that all filled up.

539
00:39:10,332 --> 00:39:11,606
Speaker 0: Here's four different sets of stats.

540
00:39:11,646 --> 00:39:12,979
Speaker 0: Next, next, next, next, play again.

541
00:39:13,344 --> 00:39:14,399
Speaker 0: I'm ignoring all that biz.

542
00:39:15,042 --> 00:39:16,979
Speaker 0: I kept myself in the default skin.

543
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:23,040
Speaker 0: I did try to figure out enough just to collect XP rewards.

544
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:36,251
Speaker 0: because this is the annoying thing about this, is that this XP, obviously, which is like your ranking, how good you are, you're used for matchmaking, and like most games, that's separate from XP.

545
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,879
Speaker 0: you just always get for playing.

546
00:39:39,024 --> 00:39:46,500
Speaker 0: And the XP you always get for playing, it doesn't unlock anything that helps you win, but it does unlock more game modes.

547
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,326
Speaker 0: You can't just load this up for the first time and immediately play a competitive match in certain modes, right?

548
00:39:53,548 --> 00:39:59,387
Speaker 0: You have to play enough and you just get the free XP just by playing, you know, spending money.

549
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:01,669
Speaker 0: I don't know if you can even buy XP.

550
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:02,740
Speaker 0: Maybe you can, probably.

551
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,184
Speaker 0: I don't know.

552
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:07,912
Speaker 0: But there are certain modes you won't be able to play until you've played enough.

553
00:40:07,932 --> 00:40:09,608
Speaker 0: And then you can play all the modes.

554
00:40:09,628 --> 00:40:12,035
Speaker 1: Game designers, I beg you, stop doing that.

555
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,811
Speaker 1: Just stop it.

556
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:15,409
Speaker 1: I cannot deal with it.

557
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:16,700
Speaker 1: Not a fan of that.

558
00:40:17,121 --> 00:40:21,306
Speaker 1: Even Smash was annoying that I had to do something to get all the basic characters.

559
00:40:21,326 --> 00:40:23,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, unlocking all the characters is like, I don't need that.

560
00:40:23,448 --> 00:40:38,132
Speaker 1: You can have your other unlocking like all the other like weird modes where people are going to collect a million me's and hats and things, like sure, whatever, but don't gate core game behind arbitrary leveling and especially not pay to win type stuff.

561
00:40:38,737 --> 00:40:44,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I recently got to level 10 and I think that that basically unlocked almost all the things for me.

562
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,112
Speaker 0: I can now like choose all the game modes and stuff, which I couldn't do before.

563
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:48,456
Speaker 0: Yep.

564
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:50,457
Speaker 0: So I think level 10 is where you get everything.

565
00:40:50,498 --> 00:40:58,920
Speaker 0: So and there's another, there is a gotcha thing where like you can get crates or like gift boxes or something and open those up and the skins and shit in there.

566
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:00,479
Speaker 0: They take so long to open.

567
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:02,860
Speaker 0: I haven't even tried to open them.

568
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:09,364
Speaker 1: You have to like do this portal thing for each one that take, it takes minimum like 15 or 20 seconds to open each one.

569
00:41:10,274 --> 00:41:12,720
Speaker 0: Oh, but yeah, I basically just did what you were doing with Overwatch.

570
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:13,889
Speaker 0: I haven't opened any of them.

571
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,413
Speaker 0: I get them and I don't open them.

572
00:41:16,922 --> 00:41:36,534
Speaker 0: You know, but I mean, I think that that's a common thing that games with loot boxes or crates do because they're trying to emulate the feeling, you know, you get from opening like a pack of baseball cards and like being amazed and, you know, even if you're getting ones you already have, right, it's still this up and down emotional casino-like rollercoaster.

573
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:42,616
Speaker 0: And while I'd say, so that's why you don't want to make it an instant process, a computer could just instantly do it, right?

574
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:48,413
Speaker 0: You want to have an animation and a presentation of like you're opening the thing, what's inside?

575
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:50,499
Speaker 0: First up, this skin.

576
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,665
Speaker 0: Case in point.

577
00:41:51,807 --> 00:41:53,440
Speaker 0: This skin you already have.

578
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,714
Speaker 1: When I did the charity stream.

579
00:41:54,774 --> 00:41:57,524
Speaker 0: A moldy old piece of bubblegum that you're not going to eat.

580
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:09,752
Speaker 1: When I did that charity stream because you all donated a ton of money to the Democrats and I agreed to open every one of those fucking loot boxes I had in Overwatch live on stream, it took hours and at one point I just left a book propped on my space bar and walked

581
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:10,039
Speaker 0: away.

582
00:42:11,744 --> 00:42:27,505
Speaker 1: But on one hand it feels like gaming is so saturated with this stuff that it would lose all of its power to the point that if I even see a loot box in any game I almost like, I have this opposite reaction of I don't want to engage with it because I just feel annoyed that it even exists.

583
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:29,525
Speaker 1: I'm so used to it being everywhere.

584
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:30,435
Speaker 1: But on the

585
00:42:30,496 --> 00:42:49,139
Speaker 0: other hand if all of gaming, tabletop, video game everything, was only the kind of games that we like competitive skill games there were just the number of people, the size of the gaming industry as a whole would be like this tiny fraction of what it is now.

586
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:58,517
Speaker 1: We can have lots of fun games in this broad ecosystem that are not that, but they shouldn't have to all have the same fucking addictive gotcha mechanic in them.

587
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,271
Speaker 0: Right, so let's, now that we got that out of the way, let's talk about the actual game, the split game.

588
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:07,200
Speaker 1: There's too many modes to talk about all of them, but we can talk a lot about.

589
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,333
Speaker 0: I don't even know all the modes because unlock them all.

590
00:43:10,353 --> 00:43:10,938
Speaker 0: So first things.

591
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:19,159
Speaker 1: first there's a small number of weapons and there doesn't appear to be significant like spread, like it's like it's a lot like older FPS's.

592
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,128
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel like there's spread, it feels very halo-y in terms of the way the weapons work.

593
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:27,399
Speaker 1: You can just click on heads from across the map and it pretty much just works.

594
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:36,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, for example, we can't determine whether a sniper rifle is more accurate when you zoom in or zooming in just lets you zoom in.

595
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,637
Speaker 1: I find I was getting more kills and also I was more effective with the sniper rifle if I never zoomed in.

596
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:49,080
Speaker 0: Because you save the time, sometimes you save the time not having to zoom, but sometimes the guy's really far away.

597
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,000
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, the sniper rifle basically kills in one shot.

598
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,803
Speaker 0: There is, my favorite weapon is the plasma rifle, which is a lot like the one from Doom.

599
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,369
Speaker 1: I like that, the assault rifle, the AR.

600
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,226
Speaker 0: It's okay, it's pretty good.

601
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,498
Speaker 0: There's an SMG that I barely ever get to use.

602
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:11,439
Speaker 0: There's a nice like three round burst kind of, you know, rifle that you can get.

603
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:22,819
Speaker 1: Yep, but the fun part about these weapons is they're very old style FPS and it's sort of just like hit scan, like click and it happens, but you have very limited ammo in most modes.

604
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,760
Speaker 1: So you're not just spraying all the time.

605
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,799
Speaker 0: Some of the modes you basically can keep getting more weapons.

606
00:44:29,925 --> 00:44:33,200
Speaker 0: And if you die, you get ammo again and weapons again, so it's not a big deal.

607
00:44:33,261 --> 00:44:39,925
Speaker 0: But if you're not dying a lot, if you're living a long time, then ammo can become a concern because you've fired it all.

608
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:47,440
Speaker 1: But the way damage works, and again, we're generalizing a lot because every mode has a lot of like very specific changes.

609
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:52,800
Speaker 1: Some of them are radically different from other modes, but generally, if you get shot, you don't die.

610
00:44:53,242 --> 00:45:01,911
Speaker 1: It's like the modern FPS construct of a cooldown, where you get hit, you get hit, you take damage, and if you take enough damage in a short enough span of time, you die.

611
00:45:02,214 --> 00:45:03,264
Speaker 1: So if you're under fire...

612
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:04,740
Speaker 0: It doesn't take a lot, right?

613
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,940
Speaker 0: A headshot from a sniper rifle will kill you.

614
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,574
Speaker 0: The assault rifle, okay, digga digga digga digga, you're dead, right?

615
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:17,040
Speaker 1: But if you like tag someone a couple times from a distance with like the SMG, they might make it to cover before you tag them the last time.

616
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,118
Speaker 1: that actually finishes them off.

617
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:20,200
Speaker 0: And then they'll get their health back, eventually.

618
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:24,096
Speaker 0: There's some sort of like automatic, just there's no health packs or anything.

619
00:45:24,116 --> 00:45:26,315
Speaker 0: There's no healing, medkits, bandages.

620
00:45:26,618 --> 00:45:36,840
Speaker 0: It's like if you're not in a fight, if you run away successfully, you know, you go through a portal, use your jetpack, you just get away, your health will just sort of come back, and then you'll be good as new.

621
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:57,159
Speaker 1: I like this a lot for this game in particular, because if you have a game like Overwatch, like a team-based FPS that's more goal-oriented and more focused, the concept of health that runs out and needs to be refilled is a way to control the ebb and flow of like the game, and like offensive/defensive zones, that kind of thing.

622
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:04,859
Speaker 1: Old school FPSs would have the health as a, this is a finite resource you have to manage, the more damage you take, the more likely it is to die.

623
00:46:05,561 --> 00:46:10,898
Speaker 1: This, the way Splitgate does this specifically, gives you this very specific feeling.

624
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:20,759
Speaker 1: You know in a movie, or you play certain FPSs where suddenly you come under fire from a sniper, and there's that moment where you're trying to figure out where the sniper's coming from, like where are they?

625
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:23,848
Speaker 1: That feeling happens constantly in this game.

626
00:46:23,929 --> 00:46:26,111
Speaker 1: You're doing your thing, and you get tagged.

627
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,807
Speaker 1: You've got like two seconds, maybe less, to figure out where that shot came from, or you're dead.

628
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:44,318
Speaker 1: So, the game is a lot of run and gun, cover your friend while they run to cover, put a portal somewhere to cover yourself from behind, figure out where the sniper is, figure out how to corner them.

629
00:46:44,983 --> 00:46:49,506
Speaker 1: It's a feeling that I rarely get in competitive FPSs.

630
00:46:49,587 --> 00:46:57,120
Speaker 1: Like, PUBG, you can get that feeling sometimes, but this game is just that feeling distilled of taking fire, where's the sniper?

631
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:58,129
Speaker 0: Yep.

632
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,179
Speaker 0: So let's talk about just a few of the modes, right?

633
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:10,269
Speaker 0: So there's a shoddy sniper mode, where just everyone has shoddy and sniper from the start, and then you, so you have a close range weapon and a long range weapon.

634
00:47:10,511 --> 00:47:13,945
Speaker 0: You have two teams, just get to 50 kills, I think, to win.

635
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:14,674
Speaker 1: Something like that.

636
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:15,079
Speaker 0: For your team.

637
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:16,250
Speaker 0: I like the team game.

638
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,604
Speaker 0: It's almost all of them are team games.

639
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:26,854
Speaker 0: There's the ball one, where there's a ball, and if you grab the ball, and as long as your team is holding the ball, your team is getting points.

640
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:29,060
Speaker 1: We had an A+ strategy for that one.

641
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:36,777
Speaker 1: We get the ball, we don't run into this tiny room on the one map we were playing, and we just hide in there with shotguns running in circles until the match ran out.

642
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:37,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

643
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:39,646
Speaker 0: They know where you are because there's like a little beacon on you.

644
00:47:39,666 --> 00:47:42,616
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like a blender of shotguns if they actually try to come in.

645
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, and you can portal away if you have to, right?

646
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:45,929
Speaker 0: Yep.

647
00:47:46,698 --> 00:47:55,220
Speaker 0: So there's that one, and when you're holding the ball, you can only do a melee attack with the ball, but it's a one-hit kill, so you can get a lot of kills with the ball.

648
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,574
Speaker 0: I got five ball kills on one map.

649
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,151
Speaker 0: What other modes were there?

650
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:04,139
Speaker 0: There's like regular just mode, just, you know, death matchy kind of mode.

651
00:48:05,446 --> 00:48:09,860
Speaker 0: There was a king of the hill type mode where your team is a zone.

652
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:20,180
Speaker 0: You stand in the zone, and as long as only members of your team are in the zone and enemies are not standing in it, you're gaining accumulating points, and then the zone moves occasionally.

653
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:22,299
Speaker 0: It's like a king of the hill thing.

654
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:31,475
Speaker 0: There's just all kinds of variants on team-based modes that aren't necessarily like, you know, the catch of the flag style, right?

655
00:48:33,006 --> 00:48:38,264
Speaker 1: So in terms of the feel of actually playing, the game is pretty slow in a good way.

656
00:48:38,325 --> 00:48:39,720
Speaker 1: Like, you don't move that fast.

657
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,526
Speaker 1: You can run.

658
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:45,010
Speaker 0: It's not as fast as Quake, but it's a little faster than Counter-Strike, I'd say.

659
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:59,438
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it's definitely faster than Counter-Strike, and the portals are interesting because in our experience so far, there's like a good chunk of the player base barely uses the portals and just seems to play like an FPS.

660
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,258
Speaker 0: It depends on a lot of things.

661
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:12,669
Speaker 1: The map, the mode, your team, your own skill, how used to these portals you are, because they can be as disorienting as you expect them to be.

662
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:12,790
Speaker 1: Right.

663
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:21,821
Speaker 0: Sometimes the portal can help you and not hurt you or hurt you and not help you, and sometimes the map is just like, "Yeah, I want to use portals, but there aren't any of

664
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:21,942
Speaker 0: them.".

665
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:34,979
Speaker 0: You can only use them on certain surfaces, so it's like if there don't happen to be portal surfaces in the spot that's going to help you, it's like you have a jetpack and it's like, just go, right?

666
00:49:36,343 --> 00:49:37,640
Speaker 0: Why mess around with these portals?

667
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:46,168
Speaker 1: We definitely see, like, barely use the portals and you kind of just, you just see where they are, portal behind them somewhere, and just shoot them, and that just works every time.

668
00:49:46,168 --> 00:49:47,905
Speaker 1: 100% of the time, it just works.

669
00:49:48,612 --> 00:49:51,096
Speaker 0: So times the portals do work, right?

670
00:49:51,136 --> 00:49:54,948
Speaker 0: Like, I already discussed the portal camping scenario, right?

671
00:49:55,192 --> 00:50:03,860
Speaker 0: Long range movements, like sometimes on the big open maps, you can see a portal surface on the other side of the map, and you can just cross the entire map in a split second.

672
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:05,119
Speaker 0: That's very useful.

673
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,275
Speaker 0: You know, portal in, like, the ceiling, right?

674
00:50:09,356 --> 00:50:12,892
Speaker 0: You can, like, put one up there, and then, like, put one in the side, right?

675
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:19,960
Speaker 0: And then come down from the top, stuff like that, to reach high up areas, because, you know, you can fall out the top one, you still have the jetpack, right?

676
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,043
Speaker 0: So you can, you know, reach some places with those.

677
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:25,114
Speaker 0: So you're chasing someone, right?

678
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:30,446
Speaker 0: So you could, for example, you can see through your own portals, but the enemy can't see through them.

679
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:33,416
Speaker 0: So you leave a portal somewhere, right?

680
00:50:33,557 --> 00:50:37,720
Speaker 0: And then shoot one while you're running, run into the portal, and turn around.

681
00:50:38,242 --> 00:50:46,405
Speaker 0: Now you can see the enemy, if he's gonna come through that portal, you see him coming at you, and he can't, he's looking at a black wall, he doesn't know what's on the other side.

682
00:50:46,951 --> 00:50:54,388
Speaker 0: So you, it's sort of like a, you know, if you're just in a normal FPS, running from someone, they would just slowly murder you from behind until you died.

683
00:50:54,812 --> 00:51:00,309
Speaker 0: Here, you can use the portal as like a little break to be like, oh, and turn around and shoot him, right?

684
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:02,539
Speaker 0: Which you couldn't do in Quake, really.

685
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:13,399
Speaker 1: And watches the videos, I've seen people do really clever stuff when they're good at this game, like, throw a portal down when someone's right behind them while they're running, and the person falls into the portal.

686
00:51:14,381 --> 00:51:18,632
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you put your other portal, say, above a pit of death, Yeah.

687
00:51:18,755 --> 00:51:18,960
Speaker 0: Right?

688
00:51:19,525 --> 00:51:24,838
Speaker 0: If they happen to walk across the portal's surface floor, and you make them fall into it, oopsie.

689
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:31,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I guess the end result of all this portal stuff is that there's like, there are three, like, very clear clades of players.

690
00:51:32,212 --> 00:51:36,380
Speaker 1: There's the console players, who just are terrible, like, pretty much categorically.

691
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:44,619
Speaker 1: The people who are pretty good at, like, playing FPSs competently, and using portals a little bit, like, they use the portals, but not, like, That's us.

692
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:49,928
Speaker 1: We're relying primarily on our FPS skills, and we're sort of using the portals as best we can.

693
00:51:50,493 --> 00:51:52,960
Speaker 1: And then there's the people where the portal is their primary weapon.

694
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:56,397
Speaker 1: That is how they fight, and they're invincible gods to people like us.

695
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:05,482
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's also people where they're just very good at FPSs, and they'll just, you know, this game is headshot central, so they're just clicking on heads.

696
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,199
Speaker 0: You basically never really see them.

697
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,099
Speaker 0: You just die if they see you, right?

698
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:10,938
Speaker 0: The end, so.

699
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:11,642
Speaker 1: Yep.

700
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:12,636
Speaker 0: So, uh,

701
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:29,420
Speaker 1: there's such a wide gulf of skill, and a wide gulf of how people play, yet, to this game's credit, the three, like, the three of us playing a bunch, just going into random quick play, like, not really thinking about it that much, we're matched with people that are around our level.

702
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:37,504
Speaker 1: It's not like Star Wars, where we're always matched against people who are infinitely better than us, or That's because there's no one else at our level playing Star Wars.

703
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:40,839
Speaker 1: I think we are literally the worst players in Star Wars Squadrons.

704
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:43,000
Speaker 0: Anyone worse than us is not playing.

705
00:52:43,283 --> 00:52:46,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've given up, or they've never heard of an X-Wing.

706
00:52:50,631 --> 00:53:02,938
Speaker 1: So, but, the fact that just clicking quick play, and jumping into a game, is pretty fun, is a very high praise for a game like this, because it's very easy for an FPS.

707
00:53:04,021 --> 00:53:11,585
Speaker 0: It costs nothing, zero dollars, it's a somewhat unique experience, if you've been playing all the other normal style FPSs, it's a little bit different.

708
00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:17,625
Speaker 1: To get good at the portals, though, you would have to play this game a lot, and memorize maps, like, for real.

709
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:26,880
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I've memorized some of the maps a bit, but not to the extent where, like, you know, I have this sort of, like, portal forethought, or, you know, whatever.

710
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:35,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mostly throw in portals, either in a panic, or very thoughtfully, like, I see there's someone up there, I'm gonna put a portal behind them.

711
00:53:36,365 --> 00:53:52,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes like that, you know, and sometimes what I'll do is, if I spawn in this portal surfaces, I'll just put one portal there, and then, when I'm out in the map, I'll just, if there's a situation, I'll throw out the second portal, and basically go back to the spawn instantly, right?

712
00:53:53,465 --> 00:53:56,814
Speaker 0: Just to have that place to go to, regardless of where it is.

713
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:19,468
Speaker 1: I've noticed you and me both are very non-dynamic with the portals, like, I'll put one in a place that's good, like a sniping spot, or I'll put one way up, like, behind myself somewhere, so I, like, so, and then I put the second one in front of me on a wall near where I'm sniping, so I'm sniping from somewhere on the map, but I can look through the portal and see everything around me behind myself to see if anyone's sneaking up on me,

714
00:54:19,771 --> 00:54:20,074
Speaker 0: and it's,

715
00:54:20,398 --> 00:54:21,104
Speaker 1: yeah, moderately

716
00:54:21,144 --> 00:54:21,387
Speaker 0: effective.

717
00:54:21,427 --> 00:54:30,516
Speaker 0: I tend to use, yeah, I tend to use the portals, you know, 'cause any FPS that's multiplayer, right, is sort of walk around, walk around, walk around, engage, engage, engage, right?

718
00:54:30,557 --> 00:54:48,312
Speaker 0: There's the walk around part, and the engage part, and I tend to be using the portals a lot during the walk around part, but once I'm in the engage part, I pretty much only am using portals that are, like, there already, I'm not, like, reaching for the portal gun while I'm engaging with the enemy, I'm reaching for the gun gun.

719
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:55,000
Speaker 1: If I pull, if I throw a portal while I'm engaging with the enemy, it's probably because I'm losing this fight, and I'm trying to get away desperately.

720
00:54:56,043 --> 00:55:05,080
Speaker 0: Right, or, you know, I, somehow, you know, the rare instance where I think of it in advance, I go to engage with portal intent already prepared, right?

721
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,809
Speaker 0: I can't, I don't have the instinct to in the middle of a battle, be like, "Portal, portal,

722
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:10,032
Speaker 0: go!"

723
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:10,154
Speaker 0: Right?

724
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:14,516
Speaker 1: Though, in our last game, I started doing something that this game facilitates.

725
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:53,199
Speaker 1: that's real fun, that I haven't done since, like, old, old multiplayer, like, Quake mod FPSs, like, that had grappling guns and stuff, where I started using portals, chaotically, just to move around unpredictably and quickly, like, I'm running, I just throw a portal to the side, I run further, I throw a portal somewhere else, I jump in it, or I don't, I'm just throwing portals and jumping through them a lot to lose people, or to obfuscate where I am, or just to kind of randomize where I am, but I'm not thinking about where it'll leave me, I'm just thinking about creating chaos and reacting to what I see on the screen as a result of that chaos.

726
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:10,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, it becomes very, you know, if you start portaling in the middle of combat, it gets very disorienting, and yes, that can be used against you, you get disoriented and you die, but you can also use it to your advantage, disorient the enemy, either you don't die, or maybe you get really lucky and you kill them.

727
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,934
Speaker 1: Yep, like, I got real lucky once, I threw a portal.

728
00:56:12,975 --> 00:56:21,119
Speaker 0: To do that, but to do that with some sort of intent, where, like, you planned it that way, is next level, I will never reach that level.

729
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:33,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got killed by someone where, literally, they, like, threw a portal and jumped off a ledge, and I go over the ledge to look down, and they fell through the portal, popped up out of a different portal into the air, and shot me from above.

730
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,778
Speaker 1: I am incapable of that kind of forethought in this game so far.

731
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,002
Speaker 0: No.

732
00:56:40,548 --> 00:57:04,779
Speaker 0: So, yeah, if you are looking for an FPS that's different, and, you know, you don't want to pay to win, and you don't want to pay anything, I mean, if this game costs money just to play, like, it was a $50 game, even if it didn't have any microtransactions, it was just a $50 game, I don't think I would say to pay $50, but for $0, and, yeah, there's microtransaction bullshit, but it's all skins.

733
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,689
Speaker 0: It's all skins, there's no pay to win.

734
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:16,326
Speaker 0: Try it out, see if you like it, if you like it, keep playing it, if you don't, delete it, but I think it's worth installing.

735
00:57:16,507 --> 00:57:18,892
Speaker 1: Well, you know what it feels like, like, actually playing it?

736
00:57:19,316 --> 00:58:02,509
Speaker 1: A lot like the early days of natural selection, in that the game was changing, not in terms of, like, the engagement and the style, but early NS was really rough around the edges, and they kept making changes to that game, like, just constant evolution and changes, and this game feels like it's in that state where it'll keep getting updates, they'll keep refining it, and the people who are playing it will, like, how they engage with the game is gonna drive how it evolves, so it's got a small enough player base to where you'll be able to sort of follow this game and grow, so if you like it, I bet by this time next year, it'll still be around, it might not be a runaway hit, but if it survives and it's still around, I'll bet it'll evolve significantly and just be way better.

737
00:58:03,399 --> 00:58:05,820
Speaker 0: Well, now I just want to play natural selection again, so...

738
00:58:05,861 --> 00:58:10,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I was trying to avoid that thought, but that thought came in as soon as I said those words.

739
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,300
Speaker 0: Well, I'm installing it right now, we'll see if anyone's still playing it.

740
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:15,400
Speaker 1: NS2, I assume, you don't want to go all the way back?

741
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,132
Speaker 0: I don't know, I don't think anyone's playing that.

742
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:18,377
Speaker 1: Yeah.

743
00:58:19,323 --> 00:58:25,953
Speaker 1: I mean, I do, I miss, but with a lowercase m, the old days were matches for like an hour long and I would just build a wall of OCs.

744
00:58:28,224 --> 00:58:34,258
Speaker 0: If I could go back and play that game as it was right now, I would enjoy playing that game right now.

745
00:58:34,822 --> 00:58:39,569
Speaker 1: Building a wall of OCs and just hiding behind them, jumping around was fun, but also stupid.

746
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:44,055
Speaker 0: I'm in the mood to play NS1 right now if it was a full batch of players and whatnot.

747
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,145
Speaker 1: God dammit, I am too.

748
00:58:45,266 --> 00:58:46,519
Speaker 1: I feel like we're only gonna be able to.

749
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:51,406
Speaker 1: I feel like playing Quake 1 is the closest to that nostalgic experience we can get right now.

750
00:58:51,427 --> 00:59:02,560
Speaker 0: But also, even if I were to play you know, NS2 right now, and there were players, they're probably just all gonna come and fade and chop my head off instantly and I'm gonna be useless.

751
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, we gotta play with our people so we can all be bad together.

752
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:06,760
Speaker 0: We don't have enough people.

753
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:07,424
Speaker 1: I know.

754
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:08,031
Speaker 1: We don't have enough people.

755
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,860
Speaker 1: The eternal conundrum.

756
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:12,071
Speaker 1: If you want to play Splitgate with us, just hang out in the Discord.

757
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:15,107
Speaker 1: I'll totally play it with you because I enjoy it.

758
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,832
Speaker 1: I feel like I'll play it once or twice a week.

759
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,957
Speaker 0: You know, I'm not like, this isn't a game that I'm actively playing.

760
00:59:22,381 --> 00:59:24,055
Speaker 0: I'm not sitting down and being like, "Oh, time to play

761
00:59:24,096 --> 00:59:24,499
Speaker 0: Splitgate.".

762
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,633
Speaker 0: But it's a game where some friends are like, "Hey, let's play

763
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:27,916
Speaker 0: Splitgate."

764
00:59:27,956 --> 00:59:29,289
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Okay, I'll play

765
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:29,390
Speaker 0: it.".

766
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,228
Speaker 1: Like Overwatch, I play every day.

767
00:59:31,288 --> 00:59:32,520
Speaker 1: I sit down like, "It's Overwatch

768
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:32,884
Speaker 1: time.".

769
00:59:32,945 --> 00:59:37,007
Speaker 1: I'm not doing that with Splitgate, but me and the Scots will play this when we feel it.

770
00:59:37,653 --> 00:59:41,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think I would ever play Splitgate on my own on purpose.

771
00:59:42,603 --> 00:59:42,887
Speaker 1: Nah.

772
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:50,691
Speaker 1: But I would like to play not just with people I know on the same team, but against a team that is also people I know.

773
00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:54,840
Speaker 1: Because that is the purest, most fun in all FPSs, in my opinion.

774
00:59:56,281 --> 01:00:04,911
Speaker 1: I just think back to those lands with Quake 1 at a Magfest where everyone is in the land, so all the opponents are in the same physical room as you.

775
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:05,779
Speaker 1: That's good biz.

776
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,291
Speaker 1: But yeah, Splitgate.

777
01:00:07,392 --> 01:00:07,779
Speaker 1: Super fun.

778
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:08,688
Speaker 1: It's worth playing.

779
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,254
Speaker 1: It'll cost you nothing but your time to try this thing out.

780
01:00:11,598 --> 01:00:13,053
Speaker 1: It even runs on consoles, guys.

781
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:14,790
Speaker 1: Like, you can just play it.

782
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:16,460
Speaker 0: The end.

783
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,090

794
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:22,869
Speaker 1: And now, tonight, I leave you simply with... Okay, we're gonna open it up with a little improv.

795
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:24,770
Speaker 0: Somebody shout out a location.

796
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:25,756
Speaker 1: This castle.

797
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,097
Speaker 0: Okay, how about an occupation?

798
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,430
Speaker 1: Usurper of the throne.

799
01:01:30,031 --> 01:01:32,217
Speaker 1: I think I heard usurper of the throne.

800
01:01:32,237 --> 01:01:34,031
Speaker 1: Now finally I need an object.

801
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:34,572
Speaker 0: Here.

802
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:47,154
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

803
01:01:47,255 --> 01:01:48,650
Speaker 1: I didn't use that much poison.
