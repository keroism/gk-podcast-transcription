1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,189
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, June 1st, 2023.

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:10,390
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:13,920
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,886
Speaker 1: And this is the Geek Nights Book Club.

5
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:20,420
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about Sam and Rushdie's The Satanic Versus.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,558
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna do this show a couple weeks ago, but of course I got sick, so here we are.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,354
Speaker 0: I was actually, I'm still like 5% sick maybe.

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,040
Speaker 0: It was only like a two day sickness.

10
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,400
Speaker 0: I am only.

11
00:00:37,683 --> 00:00:39,219
Speaker 0: I took it yesterday off work and that was it.

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took a whole week off work for that cold.

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,828
Speaker 1: Well, that sinus infection.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,380
Speaker 1: It was not a cold, it was bacterial.

15
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,160
Speaker 1: But that sucked.

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,900
Speaker 1: So luckily, I took some notes so I'd remember to talk about the specific things.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,280
Speaker 1: I really got stuck in my craw reading this book.

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 1: But I want to be very clear that one thing we're not going to do in this episode is get into much of the sociopolitical situation around this book.

19
00:01:06,763 --> 00:01:08,018
Speaker 1: One, because we're not experts in it.

20
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Speaker 1: Two, because that would be longer than the book club episode.

21
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:18,800
Speaker 1: And three, because at least for me, in my opinion, I really want to engage with the novel as a novel with one exception.

22
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:31,200
Speaker 1: Maybe two, but the exception that really stood out to me is I always assumed and knew that this book, because of the portrayal of Muhammad and the ladies and the situation.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,800
Speaker 0: Muhammad's not in this book, just a guy named Mahoud.

24
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:37,040
Speaker 1: Apparently in many translations, it's even more ambiguous.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,079
Speaker 1: He's just referred to as "the messenger" and that's it.

26
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:43,560
Speaker 0: That seems less ambiguous, but okay.

27
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:54,840
Speaker 1: But I guess I always sort of knew from learning history that that was the driver of this specific fatwa.

28
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,689
Speaker 1: But what no one told me, and I never knew until I got to a certain part later in the book, when a certain Imam appears,

29
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:04,532
Speaker 0: and that

30
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:20,540
Speaker 1: is definitely just a parody of Khomeini, and I'm pretty sure Khomeini was specifically personally mad about that, and that was probably the impetus for him more so than this over other books that transgressed to a similar degree at the time.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:27,120
Speaker 1: I feel like that was a bigger part of that situation than what I learned in high school led me to believe.

32
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,385
Speaker 0: Well, it could be.

33
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:39,856
Speaker 0: The way I saw it is that if I was a religious fundamentalist, the part that really believed, the part of this book that would make me the most mad, at least I'm guessing.

34
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I can think of a few parts.

35
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:52,318
Speaker 0: Right, but the part that I think might make such a person the most angry was the part where it was like, at first, Mahoud was getting messages from the angel Gabriel.

36
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:58,919
Speaker 0: But then, he was just sort of, you know, anytime he wanted something, right?

37
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,657
Speaker 0: Saying, you know, be like, do what I say, why should we do what you say?

38
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:05,500
Speaker 0: Close my eyes.

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,120
Speaker 0: Gabriel just told me to, now do it, right?

40
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,494
Speaker 0: It's like there's that whole part where it's like just obviously portraying the prophet as just a liar who's making shit up to get his way.

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,540
Speaker 1: With, of course, we'll get into the allegory of, was it the other way around?

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:30,400
Speaker 1: And it was the modern person using this internal metaphor of their idea of Muhammad to process their own traumas and interactions.

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:46,859
Speaker 1: But anyway, the other part that I could see was the specific nature of the fact that it was Indian Muslims portrayed primarily in the book, in the primary story, because that is where the original riots occurred and the fatwa came after that.

44
00:03:49,003 --> 00:04:04,420
Speaker 1: And it made, like, the cross-cultural part of that actually led to significant amounts of that anger early, because it intersected with an already persecuted in a different way from other Islamic communities situation, so there was a lot more going on there.

45
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:11,548
Speaker 1: And until I read this book, I didn't actually know that it was about Indian Muslims, as opposed, like, I didn't know that.

46
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,740
Speaker 1: I just knew very broad strokes about the story.

47
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:17,159
Speaker 0: I knew nothing about the content of the actual novel till I read it.

48
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,027
Speaker 0: I knew.

49
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,676
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew.

50
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,999
Speaker 0: I was like, when I was reading the first chapter, I was like, what the fuck is going on?

51
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:29,879
Speaker 0: And then eventually you realize what's going on, like, oh, it's a hijacking, like about, you know, pages in.

52
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:40,100
Speaker 1: And that is definitely, talk about, of all the, you know, there's some books you read where there's, like, a slow build up and then you're like, okay, I see where this book is going.

53
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:45,849
Speaker 1: But some books just come in and hit you over the head with a hammer of like, what the fuck's going on?

54
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:46,797
Speaker 1: Bam, bam, bam, bam.

55
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:51,560
Speaker 1: And then you get through a chapter or two and then you're like, oh, okay, I see what's going on.

56
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,303
Speaker 1: I see where we are.

57
00:04:52,323 --> 00:04:56,900
Speaker 0: And I kind of like, it sort of starts like you're on a plane with these two dudes.

58
00:04:57,561 --> 00:05:06,055
Speaker 0: And it's like, you understand that these two dudes knew each other from somewhere and are on the plane and together and it's sort of murky, right?

59
00:05:07,861 --> 00:05:13,540
Speaker 0: And then it's like, usually you expect like a novel wants to grab people on the first page, right?

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,519
Speaker 0: That's what they always tell you to do.

61
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,519
Speaker 1: And it did grab me, but not in the normal way.

62
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,241
Speaker 0: Right.

63
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:25,620
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, it's not until several pages in where it's like the clouds begin to clear and it's like, it's a hijacking and they're going to die immediately.

64
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:39,360
Speaker 1: And also the way that opening scene was written just really struck me as that's where, that's where I recognize too, because I'd never read any of Simon Rushdie's works other than a couple of essays and short articles and interviews.

65
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:41,868
Speaker 0: If I have, I don't remember this.

66
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 0: So as far as I know, this is the only thing I've written.

67
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,340
Speaker 1: So I guess I didn't expect just not knowing the sheer amount of poetry and like the way the writing was.

68
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:56,480
Speaker 1: So it almost felt like, wait, there's some guys on a plane and then poetry exploded the plane.

69
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,200
Speaker 1: Like it felt like poems came in and things exploded.

70
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:04,980
Speaker 1: And I, it took me a while to figure out that wasn't an allegory or a metaphor, at least in that context.

71
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,020
Speaker 0: Or was it?

72
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,760
Speaker 1: Well, I would say reading it at first, like, wait, is this an allegory?

73
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,920
Speaker 1: Followed by, no, this is literally happening.

74
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,000
Speaker 1: Followed by, wait, this, this is an allegory by multiple steps.

75
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,595
Speaker 1: Followed like in the first chapter to the first chapter with, oh, so now they just fell to the ground and they're in London.

76
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:26,079
Speaker 1: Okay.

77
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:26,702
Speaker 0: Right.

78
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:38,824
Speaker 0: So I don't know if there's like some actual, like if I would talk to like a literature professor and they would actually be able to define what the difference is between like fantasy and magical realism or any of those sorts of,

79
00:06:38,904 --> 00:06:43,578
Speaker 1: Wikipedia says this is in the genre of magical realism straight up

80
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:44,120
Speaker 0: for whatever.

81
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,220
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it takes place in the eighties, at least the main plot takes place in the eighties.

82
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:56,938
Speaker 0: But there are also dream sequences which take place in the past world.

83
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,300
Speaker 1: One feels like it's in the seventies, like the one with the Amman, I'd say.

84
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,990
Speaker 1: One feels like it takes place in a vague period.

85
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:06,480
Speaker 1: One is definitely like the founding of Islam.

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,641
Speaker 0: Yeah.

87
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:12,239
Speaker 0: And a few of them take place, like in the different places on earth at the same time.

88
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:20,340
Speaker 1: Well, the one with the Boyarder, the one with the, the South American Nazi and that whole situation, like that era.

89
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:24,199
Speaker 0: The pilgrimage takes place at the same time as the, yeah.

90
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:34,976
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, you can in a lot of books with that have dream sequences and things like that, you might be questioning like what's real, what's not real, or at least nothing's real.

91
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:35,920
Speaker 0: It's all a work of fiction.

92
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,940
Speaker 0: But like, you know, but it's like within the world of the fiction, what's real and what's not real.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,440
Speaker 0: And the thing is, it's like the whole thing could be not real if they died in the plane crash, which they could have.

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,841
Speaker 0: Right.

95
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,131
Speaker 0: It's like it could all be so great.

96
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:51,837
Speaker 1: And this is a credit to Sam and Rushdie.

97
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,700
Speaker 1: Gabriel considers that that is a possibility at multiple points in this book.

98
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,006
Speaker 1: Like he thinks to himself, like, did I die?

99
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:01,528
Speaker 1: Is it?

100
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,720
Speaker 1: I think Saladin actually does, too, when he's turning into a goat in that scene.

101
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,832
Speaker 1: I remember there's a moment where he's like, this is too absurd.

102
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:10,780
Speaker 1: I must have just died in that plane crash.

103
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:12,570
Speaker 1: And this is just like, maybe I'm in the hospital.

104
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:13,516
Speaker 1: That's got to be it.

105
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:14,260
Speaker 1: I'm in the hospital.

106
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:15,023
Speaker 0: Yep.

107
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,453
Speaker 0: So these two dudes die in a plane crash.

108
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:18,337
Speaker 0: Who were these two dudes?

109
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:19,080
Speaker 0: He got Chamsha.

110
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,744
Speaker 0: Chamsha Saladin.

111
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,876
Speaker 0: He's a guy who is a voice actor.

112
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:24,337
Speaker 0: Right.

113
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:25,120
Speaker 0: And he's from India.

114
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,962
Speaker 1: We'll get back to that.

115
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:30,860
Speaker 1: The fact that he's a voice actor is like super, super important to what this book is about.

116
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,807
Speaker 0: He's a super talented voice actor from India.

117
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:42,452
Speaker 0: But he's one of those people who, you know, is an immigrant who is, I guess, you know, I guess in modern day, you would consider him like a London weeb.

118
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,395
Speaker 0: Is there a word for that?

119
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:43,977
Speaker 0: Right.

120
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,363
Speaker 0: It's like, I think of.

121
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:49,492
Speaker 0: like, you know, the white dudes who go to Japan.

122
00:08:49,793 --> 00:08:50,133
Speaker 0: Right.

123
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:52,560
Speaker 0: And are like, you know, all in on Japan.

124
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,705
Speaker 0: Japan is the best.

125
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:56,820
Speaker 1: And they shun their original place they came from.

126
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,020
Speaker 1: If this book were set today, he would be wearing a t-shirt with like a picture of Queen Victoria on it, unironically.

127
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:04,143
Speaker 0: Yeah.

128
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:06,800
Speaker 0: Or like what's the, you know, keep calm, whatever.

129
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:13,400
Speaker 1: This is the kind of person who would like follow gossip of the royal family and like driving Austin Powers car.

130
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

131
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:15,964
Speaker 0: It's like he's that right.

132
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:24,900
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, even though he's from India, it's like he changed his name to be less, you know, ethnic, I guess whatever word you want to use.

133
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:34,158
Speaker 1: But also in a way more ethnic in that he almost makes it like more the stereotype of what people would expect, which fit with it.

134
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,260
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on there.

135
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:37,162
Speaker 0: Right.

136
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:39,007
Speaker 0: And then so you got give real.

137
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:42,496
Speaker 0: now give real is sort of like, you know, he's.

138
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:43,458
Speaker 0: he's also an actor.

139
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,020
Speaker 0: Right.

140
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,591
Speaker 0: But he's an actor in India, a movie actor.

141
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:48,855
Speaker 0: He appears on screen.

142
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,396
Speaker 0: Right.

143
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:50,500
Speaker 1: Not just a movie actor.

144
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:58,896
Speaker 1: He is like the biggest actor at the time, like he is in Indian cinema, the most important and famous person.

145
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:00,860
Speaker 1: And to the fact that even globally, he's well known.

146
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,567
Speaker 0: But he's always in movies.

147
00:10:03,587 --> 00:10:08,020
Speaker 0: He's always portraying like gods and heroes and legendary figures.

148
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:08,881
Speaker 0: Right.

149
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:15,832
Speaker 0: And, you know, he is not even though he's, you know, is a worldly person.

150
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:16,413
Speaker 0: Right.

151
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:20,519
Speaker 0: He is the opposite in that he has not thrown away his Indian ness.

152
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,160
Speaker 0: Right.

153
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,047
Speaker 0: But he's very not conservative.

154
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:30,499
Speaker 0: Like he's getting with all the ladies and being all, you know, Hollywood style.

155
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:30,960
Speaker 0: Right.

156
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:43,600
Speaker 0: So you got these two guys and they're on a plane, which is hijacked and basically one of them metaphorically, allegorically and literally becomes an angel.

157
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:51,460
Speaker 1: And one of them becomes a demon, though there's a little bit of a an indication that they flipped at some point like that.

158
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,101
Speaker 0: Right.

159
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:55,085
Speaker 0: So that's the thing is like you look at both of them and it's like.

160
00:10:55,365 --> 00:11:06,760
Speaker 0: it's not clearly like, you know, if you just look at these characters, there isn't a clear like, you know, good guy, bad guy deal the way there might be in like, you know, an anime where it's like, ah, yes.

161
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,505
Speaker 0: You know, the Gundam pilot is good and char is bad.

162
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:10,846
Speaker 0: Right.

163
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,168
Speaker 0: It's like, I mean, it's not like.

164
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:20,060
Speaker 1: in a lot of ways they're both kind of bad with a big asterisk there in that they both do a lot of shitty things.

165
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:23,832
Speaker 1: But the angel actually does more shitty things.

166
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 1: I would say like his crimes are arguably greater.

167
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,822
Speaker 0: It's it's tough to say.

168
00:11:28,903 --> 00:11:29,123
Speaker 0: Right.

169
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:38,760
Speaker 0: But, yeah, they have each have, you know, positive and also, you know, they have aspects that you can look at as laudable and aspects that you can look at is not so laudable.

170
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,081
Speaker 0: Right.

171
00:11:39,522 --> 00:11:45,296
Speaker 0: And, you know, the first thing that tips you off to who's good, who's bad is after they crash and they might be dead.

172
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:46,158
Speaker 0: But that doesn't matter.

173
00:11:46,619 --> 00:11:46,820
Speaker 0: Right.

174
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:48,826
Speaker 0: They're they're alive somehow.

175
00:11:49,227 --> 00:11:50,852
Speaker 0: Only them to no one else on the plane.

176
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:53,200
Speaker 0: You don't hear anything about anyone else who is on that plane.

177
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:54,542
Speaker 1: Yeah.

178
00:11:55,324 --> 00:12:01,740
Speaker 0: And there they get rescued on some island or on a beach or something by some old lady on a beach in the English coast somewhere.

179
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,443
Speaker 1: And that is the whole thing.

180
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:05,730
Speaker 0: But a very depopulated place.

181
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,311
Speaker 0: Right.

182
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:08,898
Speaker 0: But basically the cops come.

183
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:09,660
Speaker 0: Right.

184
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:16,620
Speaker 0: And the cops, when they arrive, arrest Chamcha for like being an illegal immigrant.

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,482
Speaker 1: And they totally ignore Gabriel.

186
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:20,787
Speaker 1: There's no difference between them except.

187
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:27,320
Speaker 1: And this is where the allegory and like the way this is portrayed gets murky and interesting and interwoven.

188
00:12:27,741 --> 00:12:35,100
Speaker 1: Because on one hand, Gabriel's glowing in the book and has like almost a halo and Saladin is starting to grow horns.

189
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:39,069
Speaker 1: So that's that is happening from the magical literally happening.

190
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:41,876
Speaker 1: But and his breath became sulfurous.

191
00:12:41,976 --> 00:12:43,199
Speaker 1: that like that is the thing as well.

192
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,409
Speaker 1: But simultaneously, if you treat that as pure allegory, you've got.

193
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:58,040
Speaker 1: Gabriel happens to go into the wardrobe of this woman's house and put on like an English smoking jacket.

194
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,728
Speaker 1: And Chamcha is too sick and doesn't get up right away.

195
00:13:01,768 --> 00:13:07,060
Speaker 1: So when the cops come, they see two strangers who are clearly not white people.

196
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,599
Speaker 1: And the only difference between them is one of them looks like he should be there to their biased eyes and one of them doesn't.

197
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,909
Speaker 1: So they arrest the one who's not wearing an English smoking jacket.

198
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:20,540
Speaker 0: And Gabriel does nothing to speak up and save.

199
00:13:22,023 --> 00:13:22,745
Speaker 0: He just stands there.

200
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,709
Speaker 0: He just lets the police take him.

201
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:29,800
Speaker 0: And then as a result, Chamcha suffers greatly and now hates Gabriel a lot.

202
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,958
Speaker 1: Tries to kill him several times.

203
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,127
Speaker 0: He's like, fuck that guy.

204
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:36,390
Speaker 0: He just let me get arrested.

205
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,780
Speaker 0: And I had to suffer with the cops being pieces of shit and everything.

206
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:52,360
Speaker 1: And it's very clear, like if anyone's missing the super obvious lit crit like analysis conversation here that a reading of this scene and this this reading is throughout the entire book.

207
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,845
Speaker 1: But this seems such a good example of it.

208
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,033
Speaker 1: It is very clearly because think about it.

209
00:13:56,334 --> 00:13:57,900
Speaker 1: The voice actor gets arrested.

210
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:05,940
Speaker 1: The movie star doesn't, which also leads to who passes more in the dominant culture of the place they've immigrated to.

211
00:14:06,441 --> 00:14:08,405
Speaker 1: And thus they're treated very differently.

212
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:15,860
Speaker 0: And Chamcha is more of a person, you know, he's a person like, you know, of London in every way.

213
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

214
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,408
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, he loves, you know, he loves London food.

215
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:20,350
Speaker 0: Like his spirit.

216
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:24,280
Speaker 1: He is more a Londoner than a lot of English people by birth.

217
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:32,619
Speaker 1: Yet he looks more foreign to the white people, which ties back to the fact that there's a reason he was only ever allowed to be a voice actor.

218
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:44,060
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Gabriel passes effectively more appearance wise, yet he is much less of that spiritually and personally.

219
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,525
Speaker 1: Like he's, well, he's got a whole other thing going on.

220
00:14:46,565 --> 00:14:47,507
Speaker 1: It's not like they're opposites.

221
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,271
Speaker 1: Gabriel's a little more insane as a character than Chamcha.

222
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,007
Speaker 0: He gets more insane and less insane at different times.

223
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,657
Speaker 0: But he's, you know, he's definitely lost it.

224
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:01,900
Speaker 0: He's lost the plot.

225
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,187
Speaker 1: But the way they're written is also just fantastic.

226
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 1: Like their dialogue and like Chamcha, it's interesting how Chamcha is almost the more level headed one most of the time.

227
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:20,118
Speaker 1: Like in the police car and a lot of scenes when weird stuff's happening, he is almost always like, wait, is this really happening or am I going crazy?

228
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:20,800
Speaker 1: What's going on?

229
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,388
Speaker 1: Gabriel definitely just rolls with it more before he has that revelation.

230
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,911
Speaker 1: And that happens repeatedly.

231
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:31,200
Speaker 1: Like he's less connected to humanity as a character than Chamcha is.

232
00:15:32,242 --> 00:15:37,774
Speaker 0: Alright, so these two main characters and their plot is like driving the rest of the story.

233
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:40,180
Speaker 0: It's like the thread that's holding everything else together.

234
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:50,300
Speaker 0: But there's basically several other smaller novels that are all linked in some way to them, a little bit at least.

235
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:57,029
Speaker 0: And it's this huge book, I guess not huge, but it's larger than most.

236
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,773
Speaker 0: It's not like a war and peace deal.

237
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:00,414
Speaker 0: We finished it.

238
00:16:00,515 --> 00:16:03,960
Speaker 0: It was easier to read than Tale of Genji.

239
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,733
Speaker 1: Honestly, I blew through it just because it was compelling.

240
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,060
Speaker 1: Like it was a good read.

241
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:10,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, by several orders of magnitude.

242
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:16,650
Speaker 0: But it's not one of those books where he's got one thing to say.

243
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:25,480
Speaker 0: He's got several things to say and he just managed to orchestrate and get all these pieces to fit together into one cohesive puzzle.

244
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,946
Speaker 1: And it worked because sometimes you're reading a book.

245
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 1: The Princeton Nothing books did this to me a few times, but it's pretty common in books where a novel has a bunch of different threads that may or may not be super interconnected.

246
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,129
Speaker 1: And you get really invested in one and then it jumps to another one.

247
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,031
Speaker 1: you don't care about that much.

248
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:43,653
Speaker 1: You're like, "Ah,

249
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,114
Speaker 1: shit.".

250
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,300
Speaker 1: You're like almost slogging through it to get back to the good part.

251
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:51,519
Speaker 1: But this one, every time it jumped to a different perspective, it pulled me right along with it.

252
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:55,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think there was any of them that I cared more or less about.

253
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,537
Speaker 0: There wasn't like, "Oh, this is the good one and the other ones I don't care

254
00:16:58,597 --> 00:16:58,778
Speaker 0: about.".

255
00:16:58,818 --> 00:16:59,139
Speaker 0: That part.

256
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,159
Speaker 1: The Jahilius story, like the first dreams, that was the one that I found the most compelling partly because I'm interested in...

257
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,211
Speaker 0: Well, that's the part about the literal title of the book, the Satanic Verses, right?

258
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:12,319
Speaker 0: So for that reason, that was the most, you know...

259
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:23,160
Speaker 1: Well, also because that one, another way to look at those dreams, because there's like four of them... Four or five, depending on how you count, because some of them are short or not necessarily... Anyway.

260
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:35,640
Speaker 1: I'd say that they're all echoes of each other because it's almost the same type of story in the dreams happening over and over again, but in a different era with a different context.

261
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:44,060
Speaker 1: But it's the same human lens of the players in the story, like rationalizing the decisions they're making.

262
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:44,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

263
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:57,240
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you have these separate stories that are somehow tied together either because Gabriel's dreaming them or because they're actually taking place in the same world and there's some minor linkage or, you know, whatever reason.

264
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:03,129
Speaker 0: But they all have characters that line up with each other, right?

265
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,073
Speaker 0: The biggest one is the three or four Aishas.

266
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:10,520
Speaker 0: It feels like almost every one of the different stories has an Aisha in it, right?

267
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:23,640
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, the same way that like you might read, you know, a normal novel and it's like, ah, this person in the novel is representing Jesus, even though... Right?

268
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:39,840
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, it's allegory in that sense, whereas in here, rather than... They do have the external, you know, references like, ah, my hound is Mohammed, but they also have internal ones where it's like, we'll make a character and we'll make another character, right?

269
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,725
Speaker 1: Well, like Hind, the Sultan's wife from Jahalia.

270
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,889
Speaker 1: And then you've got Hind in London.

271
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:51,477
Speaker 1: And those two characters are not the same, but there's a bunch of echoes between the two of them.

272
00:18:51,517 --> 00:18:53,880
Speaker 1: Like they're tied narratively, but not directly.

273
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,101
Speaker 0: Yeah.

274
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:59,588
Speaker 0: And it's not always so blatant with the same name characters, right?

275
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,393
Speaker 0: Because you've got the angel Gabriel, right?

276
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:06,100
Speaker 0: You've got Gabriel with a similar name, right?

277
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:12,230
Speaker 0: But Gabriel is, you know, having these wild dreams and it's sort of like he's receiving.

278
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,620
Speaker 0: that, you know, by dreaming, he is receiving, you know, I guess, prophecy in these dreams.

279
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,540
Speaker 1: And that's what he's talking about.

280
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:25,334
Speaker 0: The same way that, yeah, because the only thing, you know, I didn't, I still don't know much about the Quran, right?

281
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,600
Speaker 0: But I tried to do at least some research, right?

282
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:40,338
Speaker 0: And the main key thing to know, you know, I think possibly the only thing you really need to know about the Quran to understand this book is that, you know, I'm a Jew, so I know about the Old Testament, right?

283
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:41,640
Speaker 0: The five books of Moses.

284
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,443
Speaker 0: Why are they called the five books of Moses?

285
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:50,413
Speaker 0: Because supposedly, obviously not truly, but supposedly Moses walking through the fucking desert, right?

286
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:55,540
Speaker 0: After he freed the people from Egypt and God was like, yo, Moses, write this shit down, right?

287
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:58,404
Speaker 0: And so Moses wrote five books down, right?

288
00:19:58,805 --> 00:20:00,888
Speaker 0: And so the Quran is supposedly.

289
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:07,157
Speaker 0: there was a dude named Mohammed and the angel Gabriel was like, yo, Mohammed, write this down, right?

290
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:08,960
Speaker 0: And that what he wrote down was the Quran.

291
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:16,616
Speaker 0: So in the book, you have my hound receiving prophecy from Gabriel and not writing it down.

292
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:18,400
Speaker 0: Someone else wrote it down for him because he couldn't write.

293
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,947
Speaker 0: And you've got Gabriel receiving dreams, right, from who knows where, right?

294
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:34,840
Speaker 0: And you've got, was it one of the Aishas, right, is receiving, you know, prophecy that tells her to go walk into the water.

295
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

296
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:41,480
Speaker 1: It is very clear that nobody actually made it through that water.

297
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously.

298
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:59,654
Speaker 1: But when those dreams are happening, and this is where, because not to compare this to all the nerdy stuff we often talk about, but like one of the things we always praised utenna as an anime for was that it weren't like if you take the allegory at any level or

299
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:00,695
Speaker 0: decide

300
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:05,460
Speaker 1: which parts to follow, they're still very self-consistent and still tell the same story a different way.

301
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:18,740
Speaker 1: And that happens here, too, because one reading of those dreams in prophecy is literally the Mohammed or my hound received prophecy from the angel Gabriel as manifested in the future.

302
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:24,260
Speaker 1: And you could have a time thing like the future affects the past or the past affects the future because it could be the other way around.

303
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:46,439
Speaker 1: Modern Gabriel is receiving these dreams from the past in some magical way, but in those sequences repeatedly Gabriel keeps like almost noting that he has no power over it and whoever he's receiving the dream from kind of takes control and speaks the words they want to hear into him and they come back out of him.

304
00:21:47,901 --> 00:22:00,320
Speaker 1: Which could imply more that it's two different people in two different eras who are speaking to a non-existent internal angel to rationalize the decisions they were going to make anyway.

305
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:09,420
Speaker 1: Because there's multiple points where someone says, oh, and like right back to the beginning, the satanic verses, oh, well, God, the angel told me this, but Satan told me that.

306
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,529
Speaker 1: And even in that scene, I think Gabriel says something to the reader.

307
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,780
Speaker 1: I just remember this line because I made a note about it, something to the effect of, but it was me both times.

308
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,641
Speaker 0: Right.

309
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:20,703
Speaker 0: Well, OK, so we got to get to that.

310
00:22:20,763 --> 00:22:20,944
Speaker 0: Right.

311
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:27,600
Speaker 0: So first of all, this book has some unnamed narrator who is a character.

312
00:22:28,962 --> 00:22:30,125
Speaker 1: I would argue on one level.

313
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:38,700
Speaker 1: that unnamed narrator I thought was the base internal monologue of all humans that people interpret as divine.

314
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:48,780
Speaker 1: But I also wondered if that was if it's more magical, the actual Angel Gabriel who has been inserting himself or itself into these characters along the way.

315
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:50,464
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

316
00:22:50,484 --> 00:22:57,600
Speaker 0: That's what makes it, you know, the kind of book that I like is that, you know, I've been ranting about this constantly over the past year or few.

317
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,081
Speaker 0: Right.

318
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,325
Speaker 0: Is that there are some works of fiction across all mediums.

319
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:02,026
Speaker 0: Right.

320
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:11,480
Speaker 0: And especially today, the popular ones, the serials on television, especially where they're all about the only question they ask of the audience is what happens next?

321
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,922
Speaker 0: And then they answer it.

322
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:13,422
Speaker 0: Right.

323
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:16,306
Speaker 0: And then there's no questioning.

324
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:16,927
Speaker 0: Right.

325
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:27,360
Speaker 0: So I think, you know, a good example would be like those who's the guy who makes the movies, like the who's the guy who said the Inception, the Inception movie guy and the.

326
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,644
Speaker 0: Oh, did you also do Interstellar?

327
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,165
Speaker 0: Same guy.

328
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:31,368
Speaker 1: Nolan and all them.

329
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:31,829
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think.

330
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:32,170
Speaker 1: Yeah.

331
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,471
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:35,297
Speaker 0: So his he creates this wild thing.

333
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:35,939
Speaker 0: Right.

334
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,903
Speaker 1: There's no allegory there.

335
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:38,704
Speaker 1: Right.

336
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:41,911
Speaker 0: And then he at the end of the movie, he basically explains it.

337
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:42,331
Speaker 0: Right.

338
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:42,913
Speaker 0: He's like.

339
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:46,480
Speaker 0: he's like, you know, it's like, sure, at the end of Inception, spoilers.

340
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:46,680
Speaker 0: Right.

341
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,325
Speaker 0: It's like they cut away before the top stops spinning.

342
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:50,107
Speaker 0: If it does.

343
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:56,860
Speaker 1: I would argue and I'm going to say something mean a lot of people mistake not answering that question for being deep.

344
00:23:57,741 --> 00:23:58,022
Speaker 0: Right.

345
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,245
Speaker 0: But that's not to me.

346
00:24:00,426 --> 00:24:02,389
Speaker 0: That's not challenging to the audience.

347
00:24:02,569 --> 00:24:02,810
Speaker 0: Right.

348
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:09,260
Speaker 0: It's like because you're not asking any other questions, not asking questions about life or meaning or right.

349
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:16,994
Speaker 0: It's like you don't walk out of there, you know, seeing those movies like, you know, like thinking like questioning existence.

350
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:17,815
Speaker 0: Right.

351
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:18,296
Speaker 0: Right.

352
00:24:18,677 --> 00:24:20,240
Speaker 0: But you look at, you know, easy.

353
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,744
Speaker 0: You know, we did it 2001 already as a book club.

354
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:23,024
Speaker 0: Right.

355
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,847
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the end of 2001?

356
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:32,820
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you could like you could try to explain a little bit like, OK, so the aliens took him and kept him somewhere or something.

357
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,182
Speaker 1: But something.

358
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:34,502
Speaker 0: Right.

359
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,185
Speaker 0: But it's like, what does it mean?

360
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:37,508
Speaker 0: It's like it's challenge.

361
00:24:37,548 --> 00:24:40,212
Speaker 0: It's not ask you what happened or what happens next.

362
00:24:40,292 --> 00:24:40,433
Speaker 0: Right.

363
00:24:40,473 --> 00:24:41,354
Speaker 0: It's challenging.

364
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:42,076
Speaker 0: Right.

365
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,600
Speaker 0: You're you're philosophically right.

366
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,192
Speaker 0: You know what you believe about the short life that you are going to live on this earth.

367
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:49,613
Speaker 0: Right.

368
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,877
Speaker 0: And you have to answer it for yourself.

369
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:52,120
Speaker 0: They don't tell you what the answer is.

370
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:01,780
Speaker 1: And even to get back to Inception example, say you try to scratch the surface and dig deeper and ask questions, even if the movie or the work didn't necessarily compel you to.

371
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:11,520
Speaker 1: If you go deep on, say, Inception, you'll exhaust all your possibilities and lay out a fairly simple map of ideas and stories.

372
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:37,100
Speaker 1: But even now, like thinking about this book and reading it, if you keep trying to line up allegories and like explain things, you can basically go infinitely deep because every angle asks more questions and ties back to other things you read and radically, diametrically opposed literary interpretations of parts of this book make perfect, consistent sense next to each other in the same story.

373
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:37,921
Speaker 0: Right.

374
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:39,905
Speaker 0: That is one thing right now.

375
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:41,889
Speaker 0: It's one thing to be so abstract.

376
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,511
Speaker 0: Right.

377
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:47,140
Speaker 0: That it's like you put up like a Mondrian where it's like, I guess, Mondrian is still pretty good.

378
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:48,202
Speaker 0: I like him a lot.

379
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:53,112
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, you put like a dot on you on a painting and it's like up to people to interpret the dot.

380
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,373
Speaker 0: Right.

381
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:56,419
Speaker 0: It's like you barely you know, it's like it's so wide open.

382
00:25:56,439 --> 00:25:56,539
Speaker 0: Right.

383
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,379
Speaker 0: What did you really craft?

384
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:07,292
Speaker 1: First, I do remember we were at the MoMA once and we were, you and me, this was years ago, and there was a big white wall and there was a little plaque at the bottom.

385
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:12,840
Speaker 1: We walk over to it and the plaque said this wall was shot with a pellet on this date at this time.

386
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:17,720
Speaker 1: We stood there for a while looking at the wall, debating whether or not it was really shot and trying to find the bullet hole.

387
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:18,701
Speaker 0: Sure.

388
00:26:20,002 --> 00:26:24,127
Speaker 0: But, you know, think about like a Picasso, right, where it's still abstract.

389
00:26:24,507 --> 00:26:24,848
Speaker 0: Right.

390
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:27,291
Speaker 0: But there is still so much there.

391
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:28,352
Speaker 0: Right.

392
00:26:28,612 --> 00:26:29,113
Speaker 0: It's not like.

393
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:33,778
Speaker 0: they're just, you know, lazily making some open ended thing and being like, haha, it's challenging you.

394
00:26:34,078 --> 00:26:34,359
Speaker 0: Right.

395
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:35,400
Speaker 0: It's like, no, it really is.

396
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,761
Speaker 1: Well, it grounds you.

397
00:26:36,821 --> 00:26:56,940
Speaker 1: The challenge and the literary discussion and the introspection are grounded in very specific literary notes, specific facts, specific framing to point you in a direction of inquiry instead of just having an open, like, you know, a completely open inquiry piece of art is almost not materially deeper than a zero inquiry art.

398
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,499
Speaker 1: The magic is art that guides you into deep inquiry with the fewest pieces necessary to do so.

399
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:07,886
Speaker 0: And so we have this mysterious, you know, narrator.

400
00:27:08,347 --> 00:27:08,587
Speaker 0: Right.

401
00:27:08,888 --> 00:27:10,250
Speaker 0: Who they do.

402
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:16,980
Speaker 0: You would almost any book, any book written today would at the end of the book reveal with no doubt who that narrator is.

403
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,163
Speaker 1: And then Kaiser, so they walked away.

404
00:27:19,663 --> 00:27:21,085
Speaker 0: I was 90 percent.

405
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:23,929
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I was expecting right.

406
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:31,600
Speaker 0: Half expecting, I guess, because like, you know, was that at the end of the book, that narrator was going to come in and close it off.

407
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:31,880
Speaker 0: Right.

408
00:27:32,321 --> 00:27:36,167
Speaker 0: And that narrator basically stops coming in like two thirds of the way through.

409
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:36,287
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:27:36,527 --> 00:27:36,688
Speaker 0: Right.

411
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:37,970
Speaker 0: I mean, they're still narrating.

412
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,591
Speaker 0: Right.

413
00:27:38,831 --> 00:27:44,340
Speaker 0: But earlier in the book, there are times where the narrator breaks the fourth wall.

414
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,002
Speaker 1: Oh, he's talking to you directly.

415
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:46,643
Speaker 1: And he's right.

416
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,846
Speaker 0: He basically talks about themselves.

417
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,390
Speaker 1: Where do you see what's about to fucking happen?

418
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,432
Speaker 1: Like he's right.

419
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:53,413
Speaker 0: And that's the character.

420
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:57,700
Speaker 0: The narrator is the character who says it was me both times.

421
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,301
Speaker 0: Yeah.

422
00:27:58,321 --> 00:27:58,581
Speaker 0: Right.

423
00:27:58,922 --> 00:28:00,424
Speaker 0: And there's another important scene.

424
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:07,536
Speaker 0: The only time where the the narrator actually appears like in and meets was he meets Gabriel.

425
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:07,697
Speaker 0: Right.

426
00:28:07,717 --> 00:28:08,398
Speaker 0: He's like on a better.

427
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,680
Speaker 0: So I forget the details.

428
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:15,135
Speaker 0: But Gabriel walks in a room and he's there and it might have been challenged to the walks in the room.

429
00:28:15,356 --> 00:28:16,980
Speaker 0: One of the two characters walks into a room.

430
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:25,388
Speaker 1: I want to point out that it is not that we're just forgetful because I know like, Scott, you have a reputation for forgetting the names of characters and I'm not great about it either.

431
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:26,369
Speaker 1: Like, to be fair.

432
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:37,340
Speaker 1: But in this case, the duality and the sort of flipping of roles is so integral to this book that it is very easy to forget which character did what because the book is doing that on purpose.

433
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,160
Speaker 0: Right.

434
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,063
Speaker 0: But anyway, one of the main characters, I should look up which one.

435
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:41,524
Speaker 0: It's important.

436
00:28:41,544 --> 00:28:43,646
Speaker 0: Like one of the most important scenes, even though it's so short.

437
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:44,206
Speaker 0: Right.

438
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:49,352
Speaker 0: It's like such like this ridiculously significant, important scene in the book is like as like a page or two.

439
00:28:49,472 --> 00:28:49,792
Speaker 0: Maybe.

440
00:28:49,952 --> 00:28:50,172
Speaker 0: Right.

441
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:52,114
Speaker 0: They go in the room and the dude is there.

442
00:28:52,335 --> 00:28:53,195
Speaker 0: who's the narrator.

443
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:53,776
Speaker 0: Clearly.

444
00:28:53,796 --> 00:28:54,377
Speaker 0: Right.

445
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:57,219
Speaker 0: You could just tell somehow with even though it didn't say so.

446
00:28:57,239 --> 00:28:57,740
Speaker 0: Right.

447
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,145
Speaker 0: And he's like the narrator is trying to like, you know, tell whoever it is, you know, something.

448
00:29:05,406 --> 00:29:05,706
Speaker 0: Right.

449
00:29:06,006 --> 00:29:07,027
Speaker 0: It's like influence them.

450
00:29:07,528 --> 00:29:08,849
Speaker 0: And he's being challenged.

451
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:12,171
Speaker 0: He's basically being asked, like, are you are you God or are you Satan?

452
00:29:12,412 --> 00:29:12,712
Speaker 0: Right.

453
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,373
Speaker 0: It's like the character knows.

454
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:16,135
Speaker 0: He's like, which one are you?

455
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:19,317
Speaker 0: And he's just sort of like laughs at him.

456
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:19,578
Speaker 0: Right.

457
00:29:19,618 --> 00:29:22,260
Speaker 0: It's like, well, you don't know which one I am, bro.

458
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,401
Speaker 1: So right.

459
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:33,267
Speaker 0: And my interpretation, my friend is another part where the narrator comes back and talks to the reader and is like, well, that did do didn't know which one I was.

460
00:29:33,868 --> 00:29:38,411
Speaker 0: If I was if I was one of them at all to be, you know, either one, I could have been something, you know, that's right.

461
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:50,620
Speaker 1: It's like, and knowing that this book is partly widely interpreted to be an interrogation of salmon, Russia's own life and struggles with living between cultures.

462
00:29:51,261 --> 00:30:00,051
Speaker 1: I'd say that two strong interpretations are that, well, three, if you want to go a fully mystical route, interpretation number one, it is God, but God isn't good or evil.

463
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:02,253
Speaker 1: And it's a coin flipping in the wind.

464
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,796
Speaker 1: Like both of them are God and Satan at the same time.

465
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:06,658
Speaker 0: Actual Angel Gabriel works, too.

466
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:07,259
Speaker 0: Right.

467
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,380
Speaker 0: Satan works.

468
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,948
Speaker 1: I think a compelling one is that that is a stand in for the concept of human consciousness.

469
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:17,269
Speaker 1: All humans.

470
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:19,031
Speaker 1: But I want to really elaborate on it.

471
00:30:19,632 --> 00:30:20,933
Speaker 1: All humans have this sort of.

472
00:30:22,034 --> 00:30:27,440
Speaker 1: what our consciousness is, is something that we can only interrogate through ourselves.

473
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,524
Speaker 1: And I think this work explores that very well, because it is very much.

474
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:45,560
Speaker 1: there's a common thread of characters asking themselves questions and making decisions or often doing something with no introspection, like when some murders happen and there's a bunch of scenes along the way.

475
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:53,047
Speaker 1: Or even in the beginning, when Gabriel just doesn't do anything, which I'm just getting arrested, he doesn't think about not doing anything.

476
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,490
Speaker 1: The act almost happens like it was predetermined.

477
00:30:56,971 --> 00:31:07,080
Speaker 1: And then he starts talking to himself or becoming the angel or something, almost just to rationalize and explain why he did what he did.

478
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:11,467
Speaker 1: Which is a lot that meant pretty well to how human consciousness works.

479
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,653
Speaker 1: And it would fit the idea that my hound was.

480
00:31:14,753 --> 00:31:15,775
Speaker 1: it was my hound all along.

481
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:18,520
Speaker 1: Every character is themself all along.

482
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,059
Speaker 0: And we know we know for a fact that baseball players swing the bat before they can see.

483
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:24,300
Speaker 0: Right.

484
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:38,980
Speaker 1: And thus, that character is the innate consciousness that is inside of all humans, because we're all interrogating and interpreting the world through the same flawed shared lens.

485
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:47,933
Speaker 1: But a third interpretation, and I was poking around, the third one that I got a hundred for is that that is Sam and Rushdie himself.

486
00:31:48,654 --> 00:31:49,094
Speaker 0: Could be.

487
00:31:49,515 --> 00:31:50,016
Speaker 0: That's a good one.

488
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:52,940
Speaker 1: Who is God, if in terms of writing the book.

489
00:31:54,501 --> 00:32:00,417
Speaker 1: And based on what I've read about Sam and Rushdie, that really does feel like the kind of thing he would have done, but would never admit to.

490
00:32:00,738 --> 00:32:01,340
Speaker 0: So maybe.

491
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,102
Speaker 0: All right.

492
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:05,169
Speaker 0: So we got to talk about the title of the books, the satanic verses.

493
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:05,430
Speaker 0: Right.

494
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,234
Speaker 0: So it's like, what the hell are the satanic verses?

495
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:09,700
Speaker 0: I didn't know this until I read the book and I looked it up.

496
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,848
Speaker 1: And it's almost every religion that has a book has a concept of these apocryphal.

497
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:15,870
Speaker 0: Sure.

498
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,310
Speaker 0: Right.

499
00:32:16,611 --> 00:32:17,633
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

500
00:32:18,574 --> 00:32:19,736
Speaker 0: Forget the book for a second.

501
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:20,177
Speaker 0: Right.

502
00:32:20,377 --> 00:32:21,459
Speaker 0: In Earth.

503
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,040
Speaker 0: Right.

504
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:23,480
Speaker 0: Supposedly.

505
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,141
Speaker 0: Right.

506
00:32:24,882 --> 00:32:31,511
Speaker 0: Mohammed went to Mecca, the place geographically with his with his clan of tribe of peoples.

507
00:32:31,872 --> 00:32:32,112
Speaker 0: Right.

508
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:33,774
Speaker 0: The earliest Islamic peoples.

509
00:32:34,395 --> 00:32:36,558
Speaker 0: And in Mecca, there were these other tribes there, too.

510
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,580
Speaker 0: They were already there.

511
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,320
Speaker 0: Right.

512
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:42,145
Speaker 0: And those other tribes had other gods.

513
00:32:42,185 --> 00:32:43,006
Speaker 0: They were worshipping.

514
00:32:43,206 --> 00:32:43,406
Speaker 0: Right.

515
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:44,027
Speaker 0: What were their names?

516
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:44,287
Speaker 0: There were.

517
00:32:44,327 --> 00:32:47,130
Speaker 0: there were a lot of like, you know, female gods or goddesses.

518
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:48,191
Speaker 0: Right.

519
00:32:48,932 --> 00:32:55,219
Speaker 0: And basically, like they at first they were kind of chill with Mohammed's people coming to live there.

520
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:55,940
Speaker 0: Right.

521
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,544
Speaker 0: Until Mohammed was like, no, no, no, no, no.

522
00:32:59,564 --> 00:33:01,147
Speaker 0: We got to do some monotheism here.

523
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,389
Speaker 0: Get these other gods out of here.

524
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:02,929
Speaker 0: Right.

525
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,933
Speaker 0: And then they're like, get out of here, bro.

526
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:05,353
Speaker 0: Right.

527
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:07,957
Speaker 0: We were cool with the polytheism.

528
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,159
Speaker 0: Everyone doing their own thing.

529
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:09,740
Speaker 0: Right.

530
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,969
Speaker 0: But we're not cool with you trying to, you know, eliminate our existing traditions in this area.

531
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,410
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,275
Speaker 0: And to make, you know, our people.

533
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:19,635
Speaker 0: Right.

534
00:33:19,675 --> 00:33:20,717
Speaker 0: Become your way.

535
00:33:20,797 --> 00:33:20,957
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:22,280
Speaker 0: Go go live over there instead.

537
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:22,420
Speaker 0: Right.

538
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:34,252
Speaker 1: And then you've got the pragmatic rulers of this place being like, look, say these these other gods are also cool and we're cool with you and everything will be fine.

539
00:33:34,573 --> 00:33:35,914
Speaker 1: And he's like, you know what?

540
00:33:36,355 --> 00:33:38,077
Speaker 1: Yeah, this will work out.

541
00:33:38,137 --> 00:33:41,060
Speaker 1: And then immediately he's like, oh, no, no, that's not going to work.

542
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:42,001
Speaker 0: Yeah.

543
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:42,762
Speaker 0: It changes his mind.

544
00:33:42,822 --> 00:33:42,962
Speaker 0: Right.

545
00:33:43,002 --> 00:33:46,626
Speaker 0: So basically and then in the book.

546
00:33:47,107 --> 00:33:47,247
Speaker 0: Right.

547
00:33:47,267 --> 00:33:51,191
Speaker 0: You have these dreams that Gabriel is having of Jhilia.

548
00:33:51,632 --> 00:33:53,954
Speaker 0: And it's basically that story retold.

549
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:54,615
Speaker 0: Right.

550
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:57,438
Speaker 0: It's you know, with my hound instead of Mohammed.

551
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,119
Speaker 0: Right.

552
00:33:58,499 --> 00:33:59,040
Speaker 0: And whatnot.

553
00:33:59,861 --> 00:34:06,465
Speaker 0: And basically, you know, what happens is, you know, Islam begins to take over everywhere except Jhilia slash Mecca.

554
00:34:06,906 --> 00:34:07,166
Speaker 0: Right.

555
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,667
Speaker 0: Until it's like surrounding.

556
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:10,467
Speaker 0: And then Mohammed comes back.

557
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:11,389
Speaker 0: Right.

558
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:26,860
Speaker 1: And defeats the gods that are or sentences do to go defeat the gods that are and there's a whole undercurrent there of the nature of how movements that are oppressed tend to spread partly because of that oppression.

559
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:34,308
Speaker 1: And that comes up both in the beginning and toward the end with all the riots and the trumpet and the fire and all that other stuff like that.

560
00:34:34,688 --> 00:34:35,630
Speaker 1: That is a thread.

561
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:45,080
Speaker 1: And it definitely seems to follow sort of the history of like how religions have spread in the real world.

562
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,683
Speaker 0: But so anyway, the thing I want to focus on, though, are these satanic verses.

563
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:58,870
Speaker 0: is that, you know, Mohammed receives right instructions from, you know, or my hound receives instructions from the angel Gabriel or himself or whatever.

564
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,390
Speaker 1: Right.

565
00:34:59,430 --> 00:34:59,950
Speaker 0: And so he's like.

566
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,971
Speaker 0: he's like, what should I do?

567
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:05,314
Speaker 0: And at first, you know, the narrator right is the one delivering the messages.

568
00:35:05,615 --> 00:35:05,835
Speaker 0: Right.

569
00:35:06,115 --> 00:35:12,800
Speaker 0: So even if the narrator isn't the angel Gabriel, they are still acting the part and delivering the messages to my hound.

570
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:19,345
Speaker 0: And at first tells him, you know, except, right, the other lady gods.

571
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:19,846
Speaker 0: Right.

572
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,428
Speaker 0: And then and then comes back the second time.

573
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:25,951
Speaker 0: It was him both times and says, no, no, no monotheism.

574
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,992
Speaker 0: There's only one God get.

575
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:28,713
Speaker 0: Allah is the is the only one.

576
00:35:28,733 --> 00:35:29,474
Speaker 0: Get them out of here.

577
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:29,874
Speaker 0: Right.

578
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:34,818
Speaker 0: And so and, you know, my hound goes at the second.

579
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,180
Speaker 0: He just the hound decides on his own.

580
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,660
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,844
Speaker 0: The second verse is the must have been actually the real Gabriel.

582
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:44,546
Speaker 0: And the first one was Satan.

583
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:45,066
Speaker 0: Right.

584
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:48,209
Speaker 0: Was was lying to him and telling him to accept those pagan gods.

585
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,391
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

586
00:35:50,411 --> 00:36:00,579
Speaker 0: I think the key of one of like, you know, maybe the second most central focus of the book is that those pagan gods happen to all be goddesses.

587
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,220
Speaker 0: Right.

588
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,741
Speaker 0: That were all the three of them.

589
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:04,142
Speaker 0: I think there were three goddesses.

590
00:36:04,223 --> 00:36:07,866
Speaker 1: The hound makes a really good point early in the book.

591
00:36:08,346 --> 00:36:12,330
Speaker 1: And that theme comes up later because sexism is addressed in these books as well.

592
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,351
Speaker 1: Pretty directly how.

593
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:16,833
Speaker 1: Oh, so we have a bunch of female goddesses.

594
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,556
Speaker 1: Goddesses have power, but women don't.

595
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:24,600
Speaker 1: And now you want to have a god who takes away even that last power that women have from our society.

596
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:25,681
Speaker 0: Yep.

597
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:26,241
Speaker 0: Yep.

598
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:26,461
Speaker 0: Yep.

599
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,142
Speaker 0: Exactly.

600
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:27,622
Speaker 0: Right.

601
00:36:27,862 --> 00:36:32,106
Speaker 0: And so the satanic verses were the the pro women versus.

602
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:33,166
Speaker 0: Right.

603
00:36:33,727 --> 00:36:35,268
Speaker 0: And then you can see.

604
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:36,189
Speaker 0: Right.

605
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:41,112
Speaker 0: The way it's a commentary, obviously, on the way Islam treats women, which is just obvious.

606
00:36:41,753 --> 00:36:42,413
Speaker 0: to get into that.

607
00:36:42,594 --> 00:36:43,734
Speaker 0: Right.

608
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:44,835
Speaker 1: As much as well.

609
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:45,696
Speaker 0: Yeah.

610
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:49,539
Speaker 0: But then look at the other characters who are in line.

611
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:50,239
Speaker 0: Right.

612
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:50,960
Speaker 0: With my hound.

613
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,381
Speaker 0: Gabriel, most of all.

614
00:36:53,681 --> 00:36:53,921
Speaker 0: Right.

615
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:56,643
Speaker 0: And the way he treats women in his life.

616
00:36:56,703 --> 00:37:03,228
Speaker 0: The story starts with, like, a married woman that he cheated with and then left behind jumping off a building and killing her.

617
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:04,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens right away.

618
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:05,870
Speaker 0: Right.

619
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:10,133
Speaker 0: You know, he's got the girl who comes.

620
00:37:11,154 --> 00:37:17,598
Speaker 1: One thing we haven't mentioned, if you haven't read the book and you're just listening to this, the book is laugh out loud funny sometimes.

621
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:19,700
Speaker 1: And this is very much intentional.

622
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,241
Speaker 1: And a lot of people speak to its humor.

623
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:25,944
Speaker 1: But she she likes splats and there's a whole thing about the splat.

624
00:37:27,325 --> 00:37:27,505
Speaker 0: Yep.

625
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:35,451
Speaker 0: And then when she comes back, like on a flying carpet, like, yeah, as a ghost messing with an echo.

626
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,572
Speaker 1: But also, yeah, there's there's that whole.

627
00:37:37,592 --> 00:37:39,374
Speaker 1: I don't remember much because that happens pretty early.

628
00:37:39,394 --> 00:37:40,554
Speaker 1: So I don't remember much about it.

629
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,715
Speaker 0: She comes back a few times.

630
00:37:41,815 --> 00:37:44,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're short, really short scenes.

631
00:37:44,997 --> 00:37:45,158
Speaker 0: Right.

632
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:48,480
Speaker 0: And then when he's in London, there's the the mountaineer alley.

633
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,020
Speaker 0: Right.

634
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:50,921
Speaker 0: Hallelujah.

635
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:51,501
Speaker 1: The name.

636
00:37:51,521 --> 00:37:53,523
Speaker 1: we haven't talked about all the names yet.

637
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:55,004
Speaker 1: Beyond the few we mentioned.

638
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:58,686
Speaker 0: Hallelujah Cone, the mountaineer who can climb who climbed Everest.

639
00:37:58,886 --> 00:37:59,567
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything.

640
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:00,327
Speaker 0: Right.

641
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:03,570
Speaker 0: You know, it's like he's mistreating her real bad, too.

642
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:04,530
Speaker 0: Right.

643
00:38:06,231 --> 00:38:08,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:38:08,313 --> 00:38:08,713
Speaker 0: And then.

645
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:09,474
Speaker 0: Right.

646
00:38:09,514 --> 00:38:10,654
Speaker 0: You got the.

647
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:13,857
Speaker 0: there's actually one of the Aisha's.

648
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:14,597
Speaker 0: Right.

649
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:18,200
Speaker 0: The one who is, you know, the butterfly one.

650
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:18,820
Speaker 0: Right.

651
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,082
Speaker 0: Like, ah, she is a woman.

652
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:21,722
Speaker 0: Right.

653
00:38:21,843 --> 00:38:25,345
Speaker 0: Receiving these prophecies or whatever, supposedly.

654
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:26,106
Speaker 0: Right.

655
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:30,189
Speaker 0: And you get you have all this, you know, it's all lining up in that way.

656
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:35,694
Speaker 0: And then the biggest one is there's the Aisha who is the prostitute.

657
00:38:36,034 --> 00:38:36,274
Speaker 0: Right.

658
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,475
Speaker 0: The 15 year old one.

659
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:38,336
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:42,940
Speaker 0: Which is basically my hounds wife is right.

661
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,622
Speaker 0: My hounds, I guess, favorite wife is Aisha.

662
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:46,002
Speaker 0: Right.

663
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:47,183
Speaker 0: And you don't really hear from her.

664
00:38:47,203 --> 00:38:50,425
Speaker 0: You just sort of know that my hounds has a wife who's the favorite one.

665
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:51,866
Speaker 0: And her name is Aisha.

666
00:38:52,527 --> 00:38:59,011
Speaker 0: And then there's the whole part where the the prostitutes are like the last holdouts in the area.

667
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:04,095
Speaker 1: And she names herself basically the same name as my hounds beautiful wife.

668
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:07,057
Speaker 1: And you can read into what why that might have happened.

669
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:08,178
Speaker 1: And you see that a lot.

670
00:39:08,198 --> 00:39:09,679
Speaker 1: There's a lot of not the.

671
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,280
Speaker 0: the blog is a ball.

672
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,501
Speaker 0: But he's like the.

673
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:16,484
Speaker 0: I guess he's the the Chamcha equivalent.

674
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:17,144
Speaker 1: Yeah.

675
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,626
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, the the the truth.

676
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:24,789
Speaker 0: Yeller speaker guy who's he's basically hiding out right in the.

677
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:25,109
Speaker 1: Yeah.

678
00:39:25,169 --> 00:39:27,651
Speaker 0: And that's where we get all the to be a eunuch.

679
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:28,131
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:31,013
Speaker 0: And he's hiding out in the in the prostitute area.

681
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:35,036
Speaker 1: But all a lot of the names are very like.

682
00:39:35,557 --> 00:39:40,660
Speaker 1: the names themselves mean something and are pointed, not just tying characters together by having the same names.

683
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:50,847
Speaker 1: But like the fact that basically the street rapper who the the sultan basically hires to dis Islam is named the ball.

684
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,328
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

685
00:39:52,388 --> 00:39:52,948
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

686
00:39:54,029 --> 00:39:54,930
Speaker 1: And I think, oh, yeah, right.

687
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,972
Speaker 1: And in the end of the book, when he's got the flame trumpet, he names that as real.

688
00:40:00,453 --> 00:40:01,834
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

689
00:40:01,854 --> 00:40:02,235
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:02,535
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,816
Speaker 1: I was probably the trumpet part stood out like, wait a minute.

692
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:06,157
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

693
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:10,140
Speaker 1: As soon as he was like, I see flame come out of the trumpet, I was like, that's going to be Chekhov.

694
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,241
Speaker 0: I forgot about the trumpets.

695
00:40:11,282 --> 00:40:11,983
Speaker 0: That's good.

696
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,545
Speaker 1: That's going to be a real play.

697
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:14,907
Speaker 1: That's basically a flamethrower.

698
00:40:14,967 --> 00:40:23,198
Speaker 1: That's a. that's also a metaphor for speaking words that cause Molotov to get thrown means you might as well have just thrown the Molotov.

699
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,220
Speaker 0: Yep.

700
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:26,563
Speaker 0: All right.

701
00:40:26,584 --> 00:40:29,860
Speaker 0: So what are the parts of this book you talk about?

702
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,107
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess the magic lamp.

703
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:32,449
Speaker 0: Right.

704
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:34,960
Speaker 0: So at the very beginning, Chekhov's magic lamp.

705
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,421
Speaker 0: Yep.

706
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:40,480
Speaker 1: And when his dad is like, there's the whole because that is that is Chomsha's dad.

707
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:40,760
Speaker 0: Right.

708
00:40:40,781 --> 00:40:44,900
Speaker 0: So Gabriel's family, you hear about early in the book, but then basically they're gone.

709
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:45,123
Speaker 0: Right.

710
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,500
Speaker 0: It's just sort of giving you his background.

711
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:46,801
Speaker 1: Yeah.

712
00:40:47,022 --> 00:40:50,700
Speaker 0: Whereas Chomsha's dad is like a significant character.

713
00:40:51,101 --> 00:40:51,382
Speaker 0: Right.

714
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:56,400
Speaker 0: Where, you know, he has like this weird relationship with the with the walnut tree.

715
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:57,145
Speaker 0: Right.

716
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:58,580
Speaker 0: And everything was in his dad.

717
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:18,898
Speaker 1: There's definitely because if we if we look at this through the lens of more an immigrant story and people who are transitioning between two cultures or caught between two cultures like that, which is the one of the primary and most important allegories of this work, to be clear, it is definitely his dad is a mixed bag.

718
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,660
Speaker 1: because on one hand, his dad is outright abusive in some ways.

719
00:41:22,241 --> 00:41:29,378
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, his dad is not wrong that the choices he's making to fetishize London are not going to end.

720
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 1: well for him.

721
00:41:32,061 --> 00:41:39,500
Speaker 1: But that magic lamp, the whole as soon as you learn that dad won't let him touch the magic lamp until he's older.

722
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,679
Speaker 1: And and I was like, that lamp's coming back.

723
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,863
Speaker 1: That's Chekhov's lamp.

724
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:48,700
Speaker 1: And then it comes back as, well, because of the decisions you made, I'm never going to let you have this lamp.

725
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:54,280
Speaker 1: And then it literally is Chekhov's lamp, because that's literally the gun that Gabriel uses to kill himself.

726
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was just.

727
00:41:58,447 --> 00:42:04,720
Speaker 1: I did not expect the lamp to come back in that specific manner, because that opens up.

728
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:17,780
Speaker 1: You could do a whole podcast just talking about the metaphor of the lamp, because think about from Chomps's perspective as a naive kid in India who has dreams of going to London and leaving his what he is.

729
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:25,760
Speaker 1: Wrongly, and like he considers his home native culture to be bad in some way for a lot of reasons that we could interrogate.

730
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,900
Speaker 1: And he wants to leave it behind.

731
00:42:28,323 --> 00:42:29,700
Speaker 1: And the magic lamp is always free.

732
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,920
Speaker 0: It's a lot like those people who aren't white, who, you know, I'm not saying that Chomps is like white supremacist bad levels.

733
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:35,601
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37,320
Speaker 1: But he definitely elevates.

735
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,720
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people who are not white who become white supremacists.

736
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:42,284
Speaker 0: Right.

737
00:42:42,365 --> 00:42:44,119
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, they end up believing.

738
00:42:44,482 --> 00:42:47,679
Speaker 0: And, you know, there's a lot of misogynist women out there.

739
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:48,266
Speaker 0: Right.

740
00:42:48,731 --> 00:42:49,359
Speaker 0: You know, yeah.

741
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:53,620
Speaker 0: And there's a woman who's saying I belong in the kitchen as a baby factory.

742
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:54,776
Speaker 0: Like there are people like that.

743
00:42:54,857 --> 00:42:55,060
Speaker 0: Right.

744
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:03,760
Speaker 0: And that's sort of, you know, Chomps is not at that level because but he is sort of like, you know, London is out there colonized.

745
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,120
Speaker 0: You know, UK is out there colonizing India.

746
00:43:06,481 --> 00:43:06,803
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:09,540
Speaker 0: And he's Indian and he's like, go London.

748
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, colonize.

749
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:11,372
Speaker 1: He's like my.

750
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:12,520
Speaker 1: where I live sucks.

751
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:14,160
Speaker 1: And they were right to colonize us.

752
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:14,963
Speaker 1: And then he gets there.

753
00:43:15,003 --> 00:43:18,639
Speaker 1: And of course, he's not accepted the way that he wants to be.

754
00:43:19,142 --> 00:43:21,899
Speaker 1: I mean, we see how the police treat him and it only goes downhill from there.

755
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:29,158
Speaker 1: But then he goes back to Bombay and he doesn't fit in there anymore either, even if he wants to.

756
00:43:31,344 --> 00:43:35,040
Speaker 1: And I think that is a very common and important story.

757
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,020
Speaker 1: And that's a lot of what this book is about.

758
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 1: Even if you strip away all the magic and everything else that's going on, it's ultimately about that.

759
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:56,020
Speaker 1: It's about the the insidious and pernicious nature of white supremacy and colonialism and how it almost converts people from colonized cultures to its cause.

760
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:10,860
Speaker 1: But we'll never actually reward them in the same way that the magic lamp represented all of his dreams of what it would be like if you got to London and became a Londoner and like join what he perceived as the modern enlightened world.

761
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:14,140
Speaker 1: And in the end, the lamp is just an avenue for suicide.

762
00:44:16,342 --> 00:44:19,959
Speaker 1: But it's very notable that it is not him who even uses the lamp in the end.

763
00:44:21,142 --> 00:44:21,303
Speaker 0: No.

764
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:24,399
Speaker 0: All right.

765
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,160
Speaker 0: I mean, we could go on for a very long time, probably for days and days.

766
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:34,919
Speaker 0: Is there anything else that's so significant, though, that we really want to mention it?

767
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,805
Speaker 1: You know, I did like like.

768
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:40,620
Speaker 1: it stuck with me one of the early short segments, the Argentinian story.

769
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:47,839
Speaker 1: Because it was told a little bit differently from the others, because it was, you know, the the woman, what, Diamond?

770
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,919
Speaker 1: Was that their name, like Rosa Diamond?

771
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,660
Speaker 0: I barely remember it, this part.

772
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:52,690
Speaker 0: I do remember it.

773
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:53,439
Speaker 0: That exists.

774
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,161
Speaker 0: Right.

775
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:57,060
Speaker 1: And I wasn't super clear as I was reading it on what happened.

776
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,226
Speaker 0: He was it was basically.

777
00:44:58,246 --> 00:45:00,600
Speaker 0: I think it was, you know, your meta knowledge.

778
00:45:00,741 --> 00:45:00,882
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:03,020
Speaker 0: He was commenting on the, you know, the war.

780
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:03,961
Speaker 1: Well, the war.

781
00:45:04,222 --> 00:45:18,960
Speaker 1: The fact that a bunch of Nazis did move to Argentina because like but also how like you have even colonizers who move to the place and almost do the reverse, like they appropriate and adopt the culture.

782
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:42,679
Speaker 1: Like you've got the English people coming to Argentina and basically cosplaying as Argentinians and cosplaying their warped perception of Argentinian machismo and masculine honor and how when the murder happens and the nonsense goes down, all the Argentinians are like, listen, you fucking English people, if you just leave now, we won't like bring you to our courts and prosecute you.

783
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:43,601
Speaker 1: Like it was.

784
00:45:44,022 --> 00:45:54,800
Speaker 1: there's a really important other side of the story of colonialism that sort of really inspects the idea that it never works out in either direction.

785
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,680
Speaker 1: The appropriation and the infiltration is just as dangerous and toxic as the expropriation and exfiltration.

786
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:05,299
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean, I said war.

787
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,719
Speaker 0: I was talking about the Falken Islands war.

788
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:09,458
Speaker 1: Oh, he's basically a weeb about...

789
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:14,140
Speaker 0: Which keep in mind, the Falken Islands was not long before this book was published.

790
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,407
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

791
00:46:15,488 --> 00:46:17,139
Speaker 0: It was really close time frame wise.

792
00:46:18,762 --> 00:46:22,320
Speaker 1: And there's a whole extra historical context about that war they won't have time to get into.

793
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:30,039
Speaker 0: But it sort of felt like, though, like he's got this whole book to work with and it's like that wasn't anywhere close to the main point of the book.

794
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:30,601
Speaker 0: Right.

795
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:39,279
Speaker 0: But he just sort of had space to like, you know, and was managed to fit in, you know, comments on other things that were just going on.

796
00:46:39,521 --> 00:46:40,245
Speaker 0: Well, it's like, oh, yeah.

797
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,700
Speaker 1: And he, you know, he brought he was brought with him from England, his new ideas from Germany.

798
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,359
Speaker 1: And then you get a very abstract description of what is obviously a Nazi flag, followed by the.

799
00:46:53,623 --> 00:46:56,113
Speaker 1: the wife has her affair on the island.

800
00:46:56,474 --> 00:46:58,000
Speaker 1: that is all white for some reason.

801
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,064
Speaker 1: And there's no color there.

802
00:46:59,124 --> 00:47:05,480
Speaker 1: And everything's just white except for the red of the blood from the murder and the red from the Nazi flag.

803
00:47:06,142 --> 00:47:12,560
Speaker 1: And that is almost Sam and Rashi just hitting you over the head like, yeah, that's where all of this leads ultimately.

804
00:47:15,662 --> 00:47:19,040
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this like since we probably shouldn't go on forever.

805
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,200
Speaker 0: Oh, we should talk about the pilgrimage deal.

806
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:21,982
Speaker 0: That's the.

807
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:24,730
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, because that that's a whole other thing around.

808
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:31,460
Speaker 1: the people make their own myths and it doesn't matter the truth of an event like that.

809
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:32,738
Speaker 1: Like, let's say that literally happened.

810
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:42,359
Speaker 1: Faithful people would very likely say, and all the pilgrims made it to the other side and survived, even though that is obviously not what happened.

811
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:46,280
Speaker 0: Or they did, but it was in the afterlife.

812
00:47:48,182 --> 00:47:51,720
Speaker 1: Which, you know, actually, that makes me think that gets back to the whole concept of the magic lamp.

813
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,399
Speaker 1: What's your reward for doing what white colonial culture wants you to do?

814
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,520
Speaker 1: Well, you're going to die because your reward is in an afterlife and the afterlife doesn't exist.

815
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:04,244
Speaker 0: But, yeah, so there's this.

816
00:48:04,826 --> 00:48:08,340
Speaker 0: one of the Aishas, right, is like this is poor town in India.

817
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:08,756
Speaker 0: Yeah.

818
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,120
Speaker 0: And it's because or is it India?

819
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,220
Speaker 0: It's no, I couldn't.

820
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,900
Speaker 1: I was not clear on that.

821
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:18,379
Speaker 1: All I was and I wasn't even clear on when it was set right away.

822
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,240
Speaker 0: All I couldn't figure out the geography, but clearly they had to cross the water to get to Mecca.

823
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:34,780
Speaker 1: But she basically performed almost like an accidental miracle, like she detected the breast cancer, like she had an almost like a sort of miracle and people were kind of on board with her.

824
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:39,960
Speaker 1: And then through plausible things that happen, people start to follow her.

825
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,300
Speaker 1: Obviously, I'm skipping over the detail because I don't remember that part of the book super well.

826
00:48:43,741 --> 00:48:48,680
Speaker 0: I focused on other parts, but it's weird because like it's one it's like a thread they go back to.

827
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,340
Speaker 0: But there's like a large gap where they don't go back to it.

828
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's there.

829
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,940
Speaker 0: They it goes away from it for a long time.

830
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,459
Speaker 0: And then towards the end of the book goes back to it until it wraps up.

831
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,702
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so it's not like a lot of books were like, I guess, sort of evenly like, you know, Prince of Nothing.

832
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:05,626
Speaker 0: Good example of like.

833
00:49:05,647 --> 00:49:11,700
Speaker 0: you got three different things going on and they go one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

834
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:18,342
Speaker 0: This book is just like one, five, one, one, one, two, three, four, seven, one, two, five, three.

835
00:49:18,382 --> 00:49:18,522
Speaker 0: Right.

836
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:29,041
Speaker 0: Just there's no like set pattern of like going back and forth between the different, you know, and now it's a dream and now it's Chamcha again and now it's, you know, whatever.

837
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:36,508
Speaker 1: But it's definitely that feels like because the Imam story, like the one making it a Khomeini, they both.

838
00:49:36,628 --> 00:49:41,279
Speaker 1: definitely it's almost like an escalation because people follow Mahound and things happen.

839
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:49,123
Speaker 1: People follow Aisha to their just straight up deaths and people follow the Imam to his ulterior motives.

840
00:49:49,584 --> 00:49:58,100
Speaker 1: And there's definitely a very clear critique of blind faith in extremism leads to death and misery and ruin.

841
00:49:58,682 --> 00:50:05,140
Speaker 1: And that is very prominently and explicitly portrayed over and over and over again.

842
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:10,380
Speaker 1: Even Chamcha blindly following his idealized internal vision of England leads to ruin.

843
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:22,120
Speaker 0: But I think the thing that I focused on in the pilgrimage part, right, where this cast of characters that was following pilgrimage, right, and what each one sort of represented.

844
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,441
Speaker 0: Right.

845
00:50:22,461 --> 00:50:26,840
Speaker 0: So it was the guy driving the car who was trying to convince them to stop.

846
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:28,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, not go.

847
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:29,122
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:50:29,383 --> 00:50:34,124
Speaker 0: You had like the people who still believed, but they couldn't manage to walk that far.

849
00:50:34,206 --> 00:50:34,999
Speaker 0: They got in the car.

850
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:35,663
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:50:35,723 --> 00:50:36,024
Speaker 0: Right.

852
00:50:36,326 --> 00:50:39,481
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, it's sort of like people are getting in and out of the car.

853
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,083
Speaker 0: Right.

854
00:50:40,464 --> 00:50:54,219
Speaker 1: And what you and you always and over time you see like it distills down to the people who are either too blind to what's happening or are too extreme or they're just in too deep and they can't admit to themselves that maybe they should back out.

855
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,221
Speaker 0: Right.

856
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:57,880
Speaker 0: And then the car breaks, but it keeps walking anyway.

857
00:50:58,304 --> 00:50:59,840
Speaker 0: But obviously doesn't walk into the water.

858
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:00,465
Speaker 0: Right.

859
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:02,139
Speaker 0: It's like they get to the final end.

860
00:51:02,683 --> 00:51:04,919
Speaker 0: It's like who walks into the water and who doesn't.

861
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:05,402
Speaker 0: Right.

862
00:51:05,422 --> 00:51:06,699
Speaker 0: Who doesn't even go to begin with?

863
00:51:07,021 --> 00:51:17,417
Speaker 1: Well, because very rarely, like look at look at the other plots, the person who's leading people to their deaths is rarely the one who suffers the direct consequences that their followers suffer.

864
00:51:20,026 --> 00:51:21,340
Speaker 0: I mean, she really had nothing to lose.

865
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:21,741
Speaker 0: Right.

866
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:25,880
Speaker 0: She was just a really poor person making dolls and selling them to this dude.

867
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:26,161
Speaker 0: Right.

868
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,079
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, yeah.

869
00:51:28,761 --> 00:51:37,539
Speaker 1: One other thing I think we're talking about, it's seen from the beginning, but it's one of the last notes I had that I wanted to come back to that we didn't discuss the fact there's this hole in that police scene.

870
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:50,881
Speaker 1: I remember that the car, the police, when they first show up, are all identical and faceless, like he can't differentiate them like they're they are just the concept of police.

871
00:51:51,363 --> 00:51:58,800
Speaker 1: But then there's a moment when suddenly a bunch of them all have specific faces and like suddenly he sees them all individually.

872
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:06,543
Speaker 1: And remember when he sees them all, fucking none of them are like English going back to old times.

873
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:19,040
Speaker 1: We got Irish people and like all these different people who had immigrated and assimilated in previous eras who have now taken on the roles that the colonial oppressors gave them, basically being the police.

874
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,501
Speaker 1: And that's that that faceless and then suddenly non faceless nature comes back time and time again.

875
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:42,320
Speaker 1: And that scene was just so directly like the allegory was hitting you in the face to make sure you don't miss it, because when they escape the hospital, all the animal people he's I remember the one animal person who helps them escape is like, that's the power of these English.

876
00:52:42,682 --> 00:52:45,720
Speaker 1: They describe you and you become what they described.

877
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:57,840
Speaker 1: But when he calls the cops out, there's this great moment where suddenly like the cops kind of stop beating him up and they start to almost fight with each other a little bit.

878
00:52:58,161 --> 00:53:03,279
Speaker 1: And then they realize what they're doing and they like turn around and unify and then resume beating the shit out of him.

879
00:53:04,121 --> 00:53:04,643
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

880
00:53:05,907 --> 00:53:12,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, the whole the I guess we didn't comment too much about the act, like literally turning into some kind of devil beast.

881
00:53:12,641 --> 00:53:12,881
Speaker 0: Right.

882
00:53:13,202 --> 00:53:24,180
Speaker 0: And literally having some magical glowing halo, like somehow, you know, if they didn't die in the plane crash, it's like nobody's like all the people who aren't there.

883
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:27,200
Speaker 1: The cops are just like, oh, what are you some kind of go person now?

884
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,879
Speaker 1: Like they don't they don't even in any way react to that.

885
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:31,383
Speaker 0: Right.

886
00:53:31,443 --> 00:53:44,879
Speaker 0: It's like it's not, you know, even though it's supposed to be taking place in Earth, in London, UK, 1980s, whatever, it's like if there was a goat person in the 80s, people would have been like, holy shit, this wasn't some P.T.

887
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:45,788
Speaker 0: Barnum stuff.

888
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:46,740
Speaker 0: This is the real deal.

889
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:47,204
Speaker 1: Right.

890
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:47,427
Speaker 1: Of course.

891
00:53:47,448 --> 00:53:48,119
Speaker 1: Clearly it is.

892
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,439
Speaker 1: The allegory is around the people.

893
00:53:51,001 --> 00:53:58,180
Speaker 1: That is their like projected perception of him as a nonwhite, what they presume to be illegal immigrant.

894
00:53:59,840 --> 00:53:59,961
Speaker 0: Yeah.

895
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:02,040
Speaker 0: You know, but like it goes away.

896
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,390
Speaker 0: It's like you would think that like that would like.

897
00:54:04,531 --> 00:54:08,640
Speaker 0: if that happens in most books, that's a thing that like, you know, is like, well, it goes away.

898
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,459
Speaker 1: And what was the place called the hot wax club?

899
00:54:11,783 --> 00:54:11,965
Speaker 1: Yeah.

900
00:54:12,006 --> 00:54:12,148
Speaker 1: Yeah.

901
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,059
Speaker 1: Hot wax, the nightclub.

902
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:19,518
Speaker 1: I have I have a page open where I have the list of names of characters and there's the names of places at the bottom.

903
00:54:21,121 --> 00:54:27,406
Speaker 0: And then, you know, Gabriel's Halo, I think also goes away around like at the same time ish.

904
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:29,340
Speaker 1: Well, because eventually the veneer comes back.

905
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,585
Speaker 0: Does it come back like one time?

906
00:54:30,706 --> 00:54:46,496
Speaker 1: because the veneer of the divine falls away and what's left is humans dealing with the decisions they have made because no one's answering your questions but you and no one's holding you accountable to those questions and the answers and the decisions you make with the people around you.

907
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,656
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, it's normally right.

908
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,620
Speaker 0: It's it's not like some, you know, lazy allegory.

909
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,340
Speaker 0: We're like, aha, the bad guy turns into the devil and the good guy turns into the halo.

910
00:54:58,441 --> 00:55:00,260
Speaker 0: And it's not the exact opposite either.

911
00:55:00,641 --> 00:55:00,903
Speaker 0: Right.

912
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:04,059
Speaker 0: Where it's like, aha, the bad guy gets the halo, right?

913
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:05,800
Speaker 1: Well, because they flip.

914
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:20,660
Speaker 1: It's almost like a coin flipping through the air and who's, quote, good or bad or satanic or godly is almost like oscillating because they're both pulled in opposite directions by the culture they're assimilating into for different reasons.

915
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:21,941
Speaker 1: Hmm.

916
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:31,782
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this book is absolutely 100 percent worth reading if you listen to all this and somehow like didn't read the book and just listen to the book club for some reason.

917
00:55:31,822 --> 00:55:34,640
Speaker 1: Like, I wish I'd read this book sooner.

918
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:36,179
Speaker 1: I really enjoyed it.

919
00:55:37,202 --> 00:55:37,425
Speaker 0: Yeah.

920
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:38,439
Speaker 1: Maybe a lot to think about.

921
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,417
Speaker 1: I'm still thinking about it.

922
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,340
Speaker 0: I mean, if you know, when you hear about alleged to say this all the time.

923
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:44,742
Speaker 0: Right.

924
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:50,180
Speaker 0: But it's like when this is why I try not to, you know, spend too much time watching, reading.

925
00:55:50,441 --> 00:55:51,325
Speaker 1: Yeah.

926
00:55:51,345 --> 00:55:55,511
Speaker 1: We say with Evangelion, the anime, you might like it, you might hate it, you might hate anime.

927
00:55:55,532 --> 00:55:56,060
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

928
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:01,403
Speaker 1: The fact that in the year two thousand and twenty three, people are still talking about it a lot.

929
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:05,399
Speaker 1: That means that it's worth figuring out what the deal is.

930
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:09,080
Speaker 0: If there was something that's legendary and famous that you've heard of.

931
00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:10,820
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, that's a famous book.

932
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:13,040
Speaker 0: It's like is a reason the book got famous.

933
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:13,421
Speaker 0: Yeah.

934
00:56:13,802 --> 00:56:18,260
Speaker 1: You might not like it, but you should at least know something about it.

935
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,145
Speaker 0: It's like, would I rather?

936
00:56:19,246 --> 00:56:22,308
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, would I rather watch Citizen Kane or Star Wars and rather watch?

937
00:56:22,348 --> 00:56:23,760
Speaker 0: I could watch Star Wars a hundred times.

938
00:56:24,141 --> 00:56:27,480
Speaker 0: But Citizen Kane is famous for reasons.

939
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:27,782
Speaker 0: Right.

940
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:29,760
Speaker 0: It doesn't get famous just by random.

941
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,880
Speaker 0: It's not like some random movie got picked to be famous.

942
00:56:32,001 --> 00:56:33,620
Speaker 0: It's not like some random book.

943
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,583
Speaker 0: Right.

944
00:56:34,904 --> 00:56:39,480
Speaker 0: The book or the movie earned that legendary famousness somehow.

945
00:56:39,781 --> 00:56:40,082
Speaker 1: Yeah.

946
00:56:40,142 --> 00:56:40,423
Speaker 0: Right.

947
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:44,680
Speaker 0: And if you go and check it out, you will realize why.

948
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,001
Speaker 0: It's like.

949
00:56:45,061 --> 00:56:46,426
Speaker 0: I know it's like.

950
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:54,020
Speaker 0: I can't even say it's like, yeah, I get is like an S-tier book, but I can't say that it exceeded expectations because it was such a famous book.

951
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,320
Speaker 0: I expected it to be as I went in expecting.

952
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:57,922
Speaker 1: All right.

953
00:56:57,942 --> 00:57:00,500
Speaker 1: He's one of the most famous authors of the modern.

954
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,480
Speaker 0: It was merely like an eight year book.

955
00:57:02,561 --> 00:57:04,700
Speaker 0: I would be like, oh, I heard I thought this book was legendary.

956
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:05,447
Speaker 0: What's going on?

957
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:06,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just kind of good.

958
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:12,354
Speaker 1: I'm glad we picked this one instead of the other option, even though I do want to read it and I will read it at some point.

959
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:12,940
Speaker 1: for Coast Pendulum.

960
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:14,220
Speaker 0: It was decided randomly.

961
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:14,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

962
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:16,660
Speaker 1: But for Coast Pendulum, Umberto Eco.

963
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:16,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

964
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:24,642
Speaker 1: But one thing I know about Eco's writing is it is not quite as perfectly crafted as Rushdeez.

965
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:30,558
Speaker 0: I mean, I've heard of the other book and I've heard of Umberto Eco, but I've never similar.

966
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,800
Speaker 0: I don't know what the contents of those books are.

967
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,140
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about the person or anything.

968
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,323
Speaker 1: So have you.

969
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:42,380
Speaker 0: But I would have similar high expectations from something that I've heard of and is clearly famous.

970
00:57:42,481 --> 00:57:43,090
Speaker 1: Have you ever read?

971
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:43,819
Speaker 1: It's not that long.

972
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:52,021
Speaker 1: Umberto Eco, there's a he wrote an essay in the 90s titled Ur-Fascism and it is you should read it.

973
00:57:52,081 --> 00:58:03,260
Speaker 1: It is it's pretty short and it is one of the most poignant, concise and well written descriptions of what fascism ultimately is that has ever been put to paper.

974
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:07,520
Speaker 1: Like it is a very important essay that I think more people should read.

975
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:17,620
Speaker 1: But Umberto Eco's writing is not as, I don't know, florid and pleasant as Rushdeez, like Rushdeez is just such a good writer.

976
00:58:18,281 --> 00:58:26,248
Speaker 1: It the words felt they had a good brain feel as I read them in a way that important classic books for all time tend to have that

977
00:58:26,991 --> 00:58:35,042
Speaker 0: it was definitely a situation where it's like, you know, like what how what like what life do you have to live to be able to learn to write like that?

978
00:58:35,182 --> 00:58:41,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, OK, like what would I have to practice to write to arrange words in that order?

979
00:58:41,841 --> 00:58:54,040
Speaker 1: Because I keep saying poetry in florid because if you haven't read this book yet, it the prose is I'd say 30 percent poetry, 70 percent novel, just the way it reads.

980
00:58:55,442 --> 00:58:55,663
Speaker 0: All right.

981
00:58:55,884 --> 00:58:58,440
Speaker 0: So I guess I had to pick some other books to read.

982
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,251
Speaker 1: You don't have to pick it today, but if you're ready, I don't know if they're going to be as good as this one.

983
00:59:02,312 --> 00:59:02,454
Speaker 0: No.

984
00:59:02,495 --> 00:59:02,839
Speaker 0: So wait.

985
00:59:03,021 --> 00:59:06,079
Speaker 1: I mean, we picked one of the most famous books of the modern era, so.

986
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

987
00:59:07,324 --> 00:59:07,707
Speaker 0: So all right.

988
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:08,617
Speaker 0: So today is June 1st.

989
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,995
Speaker 0: We start in the Pride Month.

990
00:59:10,036 --> 00:59:10,239
Speaker 0: Yeah.

991
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:16,640
Speaker 0: So I went and I looked around for some, you know, LGBTQ plus fiction.

992
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,784
Speaker 0: And so I found out.

993
00:59:19,385 --> 00:59:37,979
Speaker 0: I found out that there is a famous gay author named Stephen Rowley, right, who is married to a author, Byron Lane, and they both released new books on May 30th, like a couple of days ago.

994
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,680
Speaker 1: Oh, that's great, because Focos, Pendulum and Satanic Verses came out in the same year.

995
00:59:42,761 --> 00:59:44,119
Speaker 1: That's why I picked them both as options.

996
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:45,537
Speaker 0: But hold on.

997
00:59:45,981 --> 00:59:50,201
Speaker 0: Here's the problem, right, is I went and I checked out what the deal with these books are.

998
00:59:50,582 --> 00:59:51,645
Speaker 0: Right.

999
00:59:51,665 --> 00:59:56,600
Speaker 0: And Stephen Rowley's book, The Celebrants, sounds like it has some potential.

1000
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,739
Speaker 0: Like I felt like I kind of would want to read that book.

1001
00:59:59,360 --> 00:59:59,853
Speaker 0: All right.

1002
00:59:59,874 --> 01:00:00,120
Speaker 0: All right.

1003
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,600
Speaker 0: Let me read a description of it here.

1004
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:03,222
Speaker 0: Let me see.

1005
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:06,280
Speaker 0: There it is.

1006
01:00:07,681 --> 01:00:16,220
Speaker 0: OK, so it's been a minute or five years since Jordan Vargas last saw his college friends and twenty eight years since their graduation, when their adult lives began.

1007
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:25,800
Speaker 0: Now, Jordan, Geordie, Naomi, Craig and Marielle, like his five friends, are at the brink of a new decade, responsibilities of adulthood.

1008
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:26,961
Speaker 0: Right.

1009
01:00:27,001 --> 01:00:29,780
Speaker 0: They still haven't figured out their lives, blah, blah, blah.

1010
01:00:30,282 --> 01:00:32,080
Speaker 0: Every year they have a reunion.

1011
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,774
Speaker 0: They have a reunion in Big Sur, California, where they throw.

1012
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:39,271
Speaker 0: they throw each other living funerals.

1013
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:39,940
Speaker 0: Right.

1014
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,637
Speaker 0: Sort of like a weird friend tradition school.

1015
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:52,300
Speaker 0: But this time, right, you know, someone has a secret that's going to upend everything.

1016
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:53,503
Speaker 0: Right.

1017
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:56,180
Speaker 0: So that one that one sounds like I might want to read it.

1018
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:56,422
Speaker 0: Right.

1019
01:00:56,442 --> 01:00:56,971
Speaker 0: Possibly.

1020
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,398
Speaker 0: Right.

1021
01:00:58,102 --> 01:00:58,966
Speaker 0: All right.

1022
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:02,140
Speaker 0: The book by Byron Lane, Big Gay Wedding.

1023
01:01:03,945 --> 01:01:05,099
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I want to read it.

1024
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:14,850
Speaker 0: It's basically, you know, gay people go back to have a wedding in mom's barn in Louisiana.

1025
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:15,460
Speaker 0: Right.

1026
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:19,220
Speaker 0: And it's like, all right, I can I can see where that's going.

1027
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:19,941
Speaker 0: Right.

1028
01:01:20,464 --> 01:01:22,960
Speaker 0: It's a little on the nose, at least based on the description.

1029
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:24,870
Speaker 0: But that's OK.

1030
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,072
Speaker 0: Right.

1031
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,620
Speaker 1: Is it like a story or I don't know.

1032
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,051
Speaker 0: It's called Big Gay Wedding.

1033
01:01:31,092 --> 01:01:31,677
Speaker 0: It just came out.

1034
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,819
Speaker 0: I'm you know, if that sounds good to you, go read it.

1035
01:01:35,283 --> 01:01:35,666
Speaker 0: Right.

1036
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:37,060
Speaker 0: I'm not knocking it.

1037
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,240
Speaker 0: I'm just saying me personally.

1038
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:38,962
Speaker 0: Right.

1039
01:01:39,022 --> 01:01:42,640
Speaker 0: I don't want to put two choices out there and one of them is one I don't want.

1040
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:54,002
Speaker 0: So even though it would have been cool to pick the two books by the two gay married authors that came out on the same day as the two picks, I'm going to replace one of them.

1041
01:01:54,062 --> 01:01:54,304
Speaker 0: OK.

1042
01:01:54,344 --> 01:01:56,980
Speaker 1: You don't have to replace it today, but I know.

1043
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:02,119
Speaker 0: So I have a replacement, which is, I guess this book came out a while ago.

1044
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,323
Speaker 0: Right.

1045
01:02:03,484 --> 01:02:05,479
Speaker 0: But recently a Twitter account.

1046
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,128
Speaker 1: Oh, you're you're going to pick.

1047
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:08,560
Speaker 1: This is how you lose the time war.

1048
01:02:08,881 --> 01:02:09,504
Speaker 1: That's right.

1049
01:02:09,584 --> 01:02:12,580
Speaker 1: So I know that everybody knows about Bigelow's Dickolas Wolfwood.

1050
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:20,105
Speaker 0: So recently a Twitter account, Bigelow's Dickolas Wolfwood tweeted about this book that's been out for a while.

1051
01:02:20,185 --> 01:02:23,179
Speaker 1: I got to read the tweet because the tweet was like.

1052
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:23,581
Speaker 1: I found it.

1053
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:24,880
Speaker 1: Here's the tweet.

1054
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,011
Speaker 1: I'm reading the entire thing.

1055
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:26,899
Speaker 1: Read this.

1056
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,679
Speaker 1: Do not look at me out there anything about it.

1057
01:02:28,902 --> 01:02:29,407
Speaker 1: Just read it.

1058
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:30,095
Speaker 1: It's only like 200 pages.

1059
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:31,772
Speaker 1: You can download it on Audible.

1060
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:32,480
Speaker 1: It's only four hours.

1061
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,167
Speaker 1: Do it right now.

1062
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,220
Speaker 1: I'm extremely serious.

1063
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:35,261
Speaker 0: Right.

1064
01:02:35,342 --> 01:02:38,480
Speaker 0: So there's a book called This is How We Lose the Time War.

1065
01:02:38,781 --> 01:02:40,198
Speaker 1: This is how you lose the time war.

1066
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:41,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1067
01:02:42,084 --> 01:02:44,480
Speaker 0: And it's real short, just like Bigelow's Dickolas said.

1068
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,920
Speaker 0: And it is indeed a lesbian romance book.

1069
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,004
Speaker 0: That's not really a spoiler.

1070
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:53,820
Speaker 0: I already read the whole book because it's so short.

1071
01:02:56,101 --> 01:03:01,700
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's also, you know, an appropriate selection for a Pride Month book club.

1072
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,459
Speaker 0: So you can either choose the book I already read.

1073
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:11,980
Speaker 0: That's mega popular or this new book that also seems very popular.

1074
01:03:15,022 --> 01:03:17,860
Speaker 1: I guess you decided at the end of the last show.

1075
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:20,800
Speaker 1: So I feel like I should keep that precedent going so we don't have it all.

1076
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,404
Speaker 1: I like that.

1077
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,800
Speaker 0: I can't force you to do anything.

1078
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:24,951
Speaker 1: But I really want to read.

1079
01:03:25,011 --> 01:03:26,679
Speaker 1: This is How You Lose the Time War.

1080
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:28,448
Speaker 1: And I haven't yet.

1081
01:03:28,508 --> 01:03:29,899
Speaker 1: So I think we should do that one.

1082
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:30,844
Speaker 0: OK, good.

1083
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:31,416
Speaker 0: I already read it.

1084
01:03:31,437 --> 01:03:31,580
Speaker 0: Good.

1085
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:33,258
Speaker 0: You saved me a lot of work.

1086
01:03:33,964 --> 01:03:35,299
Speaker 1: Well, I think we should give the listener.

1087
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:36,282
Speaker 0: Sorry.

1088
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:37,660
Speaker 0: Sorry to the two husbands.

1089
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,160
Speaker 0: I want to just, you know, prop your books up again.

1090
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,260
Speaker 0: Stephen Rowley and Byron Lane.

1091
01:03:43,901 --> 01:03:45,900
Speaker 0: The books, The Celebrants and Big Gay Wedding.

1092
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,940
Speaker 1: I think The Celebrants will return to our selection.

1093
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:50,619
Speaker 0: If you're looking for some Pride Month beach reading, there you go.

1094
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,103
Speaker 1: Because I'm going to bring it for Coast Pendulum back at some point in the decisions, but not in.

1095
01:03:55,245 --> 01:03:55,729
Speaker 0: Oh, you get it.

1096
01:03:55,749 --> 01:03:56,960
Speaker 0: We're going to allow reruns.

1097
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,040
Speaker 1: I think we can in the decisions if they weren't picked.

1098
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,099
Speaker 0: But you could keep bringing a book back and keep trying it.

1099
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:09,239
Speaker 1: But I'm going to follow or I'm going to follow my own precedent in the same way that George Washington set a precedent of just not running for a third term.

1100
01:04:10,201 --> 01:04:15,284
Speaker 1: I am just going to say that I will never bring the same book twice in a row in my decision.

1101
01:04:15,304 --> 01:04:16,900
Speaker 1: There at least has to be twice in a row.

1102
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,780
Speaker 1: OK, so I might bring that back at some point about you can't you can't try.

1103
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,320
Speaker 0: You can't put it up if it gets chopped down three times.

1104
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:25,563
Speaker 0: That's it's dead.

1105
01:04:25,583 --> 01:04:26,848
Speaker 0: I might go with.

1106
01:04:27,189 --> 01:04:33,900
Speaker 1: if it gets chopped down, the time that's appropriate before you're allowed to bring it up again gets exponentially longer.

1107
01:04:34,722 --> 01:04:39,781
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's like when you're trying to test to see the websites up again, it's like every second.

1108
01:04:40,082 --> 01:04:40,424
Speaker 0: All right.

1109
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:47,339
Speaker 1: Every five seconds, like if it goes through like four book clubs from now, then I'm not going to bring it up again for years.

1110
01:04:49,262 --> 01:04:52,087
Speaker 1: And if it doesn't make it to that point, I'm just going to bring it up when we're in the retirement home.

1111
01:04:52,107 --> 01:04:53,260
Speaker 0: All right.

1112
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:58,240
Speaker 0: So the next book is This Is How You Lose the Time War, which I already got from the library, read and returned today.

1113
01:04:58,580 --> 01:04:58,801
Speaker 1: All right.

1114
01:04:58,821 --> 01:05:03,808
Speaker 1: I'm going to follow the biggles dickles wolf woods advice and I'm not going to learn anything about it.

1115
01:05:03,849 --> 01:05:04,596
Speaker 1: I'm just going to read it.

1116
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:06,904
Speaker 1: We'll give you a. we'll give you.

1117
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:07,386
Speaker 1: involves.

1118
01:05:07,948 --> 01:05:10,458
Speaker 0: it involves a war time travel.

1119
01:05:11,463 --> 01:05:12,438
Speaker 1: I imagine birds.

1120
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:17,435
Speaker 0: No, OK, because they're I mean, there's not no birds in it, but it does not.

1121
01:05:18,258 --> 01:05:19,044
Speaker 0: it's not about birds.

1122
01:05:19,065 --> 01:05:19,979
Speaker 0: It's birds on the cover.

1123
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:26,740
Speaker 1: There's one full quote from Madeline Miller and it just says this book has it all, period.

1124
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:31,780
Speaker 0: It does indeed have that is in a short amount of time.

1125
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,578
Speaker 0: There's all is in there.

1126
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,019
Speaker 1: All right, I'm game.

1127
01:05:40,001 --> 01:05:46,294
Speaker 1: We'll do that, I imagine we'll do this episode, not the next Thursday episode, but the following one, just to give it time for people to find out.

1128
01:05:46,334 --> 01:05:50,974
Speaker 1: we did the book club and read the book, but might record it early because this doesn't.

1129
01:05:51,034 --> 01:05:53,999
Speaker 1: it's 200 pages like I could read that in an afternoon.

1130
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:55,925
Speaker 0: It's a very, very.

1131
01:05:56,226 --> 01:05:56,909
Speaker 0: I was literally like.

1132
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:00,923
Speaker 0: actually I thought it was due today at the library, but it was due next week.

1133
01:06:02,088 --> 01:06:07,359
Speaker 0: But because I thought it was due today, it's like I had 25 percent of the book left yesterday.

1134
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:10,840
Speaker 0: And it I guess I finished it before dinner.

1135
01:06:12,141 --> 01:06:14,429
Speaker 0: It's just like it's super.

1136
01:06:14,529 --> 01:06:14,910
Speaker 0: you know, it's.

1137
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:18,960
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's not Binti short now, but it's a short.

1138
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:26,530
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1139
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:31,814
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1144
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:55,690
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1145
01:06:56,411 --> 01:06:59,850
Speaker 1: And the Geek Nights Patreon patrons want me to say their name on the show.

1146
01:07:00,251 --> 01:07:03,950
Speaker 1: This episode are my filters not working the way I normally do.

1147
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:05,468
Speaker 1: So let me click on this until it works.

1148

Speaker 1: Linky, G-Dragon, Lily, Tenebra, Case, Care, Makes, Music, Chris, the Dodd, Clinton, Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny, Rhymer, Rebecca, Dunn, Sam, Erickson, Shervin, Von Hurl and a ton of people who give just a dollar, presumably to get access to that backup RSS feed, which is actually not too bad.

1149
01:07:23,573 --> 01:07:25,329
Speaker 1: I use that to QA Geek Nights sometimes.

1150
01:07:25,990 --> 01:07:27,297
Speaker 1: But yeah, we're.

1151
01:07:27,317 --> 01:07:29,510
Speaker 1: we're back from illness, back to do our thing.

1152
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:37,790
Speaker 1: Wednesday episodes might be temporarily saved because our cup overflow with lately suddenly, magically on Wednesday episodes.

1153
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,410
Speaker 1: So I expect next Wednesday we're going to talk about Spider-Man.

1154
01:07:40,910 --> 01:07:44,529
Speaker 1: And for now, tonight, I leave you with.

1155
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:47,628
Speaker 1: Hi, Max Edrum here with.

1156
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:50,169
Speaker 1: This is my guest.

1157
01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:53,643
Speaker 1: I heard you were big time in.

1158
01:07:53,663 --> 01:07:54,289
Speaker 1: the old pop is.

1159
01:07:55,713 --> 01:07:57,050
Speaker 1: I'm going to take that as a no comment.

1160
01:07:57,714 --> 01:07:58,770
Speaker 1: So gritty time.

1161
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,970
Speaker 1: What I'm talking about and you're not is that more people prefer the new refreshing taste of Coke over Pepsi.

1162
01:08:04,938 --> 01:08:05,147
Speaker 1: Sweaty.

1163
01:08:06,391 --> 01:08:06,712
Speaker 1: It's true.

1164
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:11,550
Speaker 1: More people are, as we cokeologists say, catching the wave.

1165
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,596
Speaker 1: Catch it if you can.

1166
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:13,950
Speaker 1: Can catch the wave Coke.
