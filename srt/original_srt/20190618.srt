1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,586
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 18th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,586 --> 00:00:11,428
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,528 --> 00:00:12,511
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:14,054
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,280
Speaker 1: Tonight, cadence of Hyrule.

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:31,950
Speaker 1: So normally when I buy things, many stores from the time I was a kid to today will try to sell you a scam extended warranty of some kind.

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,491
Speaker 0: That's right.

9
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:36,590
Speaker 0: The only scam extended warranty that I'll buy is AppleCare scam extended warranty.

10
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:39,569
Speaker 0: All scam extended warranties can eat it.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,217
Speaker 1: Like I would go to Best Buy and I'd buy a video game and they would be like, "Do you want the extended

12
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:44,620
Speaker 1: warranty?".

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,204
Speaker 1: And I'd be like,

14
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:45,265
Speaker 1: "No.".

15
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:52,927
Speaker 0: Or even like on Amazon, I'll buy like a USB cable and a pop-up will appear like, "Hey, do you want to double the price of that USB cable for like a

16
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:53,350
Speaker 0: warranty?".

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,368
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "No, I could just buy another USB

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:55,509
Speaker 0: cable.".

19
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:55,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, what?

20
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,990
Speaker 1: Am I going to accidentally choke on the USB cable?

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,336
Speaker 0: Right, it's like anything.

22
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:03,160
Speaker 0: It's like constantly popping up when you add to cart like, "Hey, give us more

23
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:03,483
Speaker 0: money.".

24
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:03,907
Speaker 0: It's like,

25
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:04,087
Speaker 0: "No.".

26
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,229
Speaker 0: However, it kind of looks like-- Hey, you're buying planes because you want to insure them.

27
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,682
Speaker 1: You want to pay $14 to insure this one-hour flight?

28
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:11,839
Speaker 0: Right.

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,491
Speaker 1: No.

30
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:17,270
Speaker 1: But there is a situation where I will buy those things.

31
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:26,170
Speaker 1: And it is usually when I buy a very expensive piece of technology that I carry around and use heavily that I may drop or something.

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:26,911
Speaker 0: Right.

33
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:31,330
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I got the AppleCare for like my very expensive iPad that I expect to last a long time.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,649
Speaker 0: That totally worked out because at one point it broke due to Apple's fall and they just gave me a brand new one.

35
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:44,330
Speaker 0: Way back when I bought my-- There's no way I could fix my own iPad, vote for right to-- push your local representatives to get right to repair laws and such.

36
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:52,370
Speaker 1: Way back when I bought my first fancy laptop, like the Ultrabook that I spent over $3,000 on back before Ultrabooks were a thing.

37
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,736
Speaker 1: This was a long time ago.

38
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,585
Speaker 1: This was a tiny laptop.

39
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:56,710
Speaker 1: That Fujitsu thing?

40
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:57,345
Speaker 0: I had one too.

41
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:58,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are real good.

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,090
Speaker 0: Because we were copying Steve Pomeroy who had one even before us.

43
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love that laptop.

44
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:05,587
Speaker 1: I only recently threw it away because it's worthless now, but it still works.

45
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:06,430
Speaker 1: Well, it worked.

46
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,296
Speaker 0: What happened to mine?

47
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:07,620
Speaker 0: I forget.

48
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,529
Speaker 0: I gave it to some of me.

49
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,794
Speaker 1: Well, I threw it away.

50
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:14,150
Speaker 1: I put it in one of those eRecycle things after wiping that spinning disk hard drive.

51
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,330
Speaker 1: That thing had a Core 2 Duo in it, I think.

52
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,249
Speaker 0: Thank you, Derek.

53
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,971
Speaker 1: Yeah.

54
00:02:19,752 --> 00:02:27,049
Speaker 1: So I got it on that and then one time like the hinge broke because it was a little flimsy and just no questions asked, replaced it.

55
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,669
Speaker 1: The like $30 I spent on that insurance was worth it.

56
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:43,061
Speaker 1: But when I bought my big, my 4K like camera, the one I was going to use for Geek Nights for Everything that I started videoing battles with, I bought that Amazon like, "Hey, three years, replace this thing.

57
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,187
Speaker 1: No questions asked, even if you are

58
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:45,809
Speaker 1: negligent.".

59
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,349
Speaker 1: It cost me like 70 bucks for that.

60
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,072
Speaker 1: And it would cover it.

61
00:02:50,112 --> 00:03:05,130
Speaker 1: So I figure if I'm spending more than $3,000 on a camera that I'm going to carry around and use a lot, and they will, no questions asked, fix it, if I just like drop it in the river in San Antonio, I feel like that's worth it.

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,590
Speaker 1: And it did break in a way that was weird.

63
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,350
Speaker 0: In a way that Rym did on purpose.

64
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,921
Speaker 1: Why would I do it on purpose?

65
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:12,710
Speaker 1: I love that camera.

66
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:25,050
Speaker 0: I can see like a comic where like Rym's camera, his DS, his bike wheel, all this stuff is like sitting around like, you know, like wanting to murder, you know, as trying to ghost trying to haunt the prosecutor.

67
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,776
Speaker 1: You know, I just want to go back to a day.

68
00:03:27,277 --> 00:03:29,986
Speaker 1: You always accused me of breaking things, but this is a story from before.

69
00:03:30,026 --> 00:03:31,190
Speaker 1: we were really even doing Geek Nights.

70
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,899
Speaker 1: Scott had an iPod mini.

71
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,810
Speaker 0: I was demonstrating its durability.

72
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,988
Speaker 1: And Scott would always, because I had a...

73
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:41,610
Speaker 0: I already had an iPod nano at the time.

74
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,169
Speaker 1: I had a non-iPod MP3 player that broke and Scott accused me of breaking it.

75
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,290
Speaker 1: And he also accused me of buying something fragile.

76
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:52,950
Speaker 1: And he said he constantly brings up how his iPad mini is invincible.

77
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,430
Speaker 0: The iPod mini was invincible.

78
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:06,030
Speaker 1: So to demonstrate this at one point, he tosses it on the carpeted floor and taps it with his foot and the screen just goes and shatters like comically shatters.

79
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,070
Speaker 0: It was a comic event indeed.

80
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,670
Speaker 1: Like as much as I want to make fun of you for breaking it on purpose, maybe in a drawer, in your drunk drawer.

81
00:04:13,892 --> 00:04:14,250
Speaker 0: I don't know.

82
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,930
Speaker 1: But it was like the fact that I had seen Scott like drop this thing in ridiculous fashion at the time.

83
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,690
Speaker 1: So, you know, like it had survived ridiculous situations.

84
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:29,090
Speaker 1: And then it shattered when lightly tapped with a toe in a sock on carpet.

85
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:37,530
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically the camera broke in a weird way and I had this like insurance.

86
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,890
Speaker 1: So I went to their website and I was like, yo, my many thousand dollar camera broke.

87
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,349
Speaker 1: You said you would fix it.

88
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,290
Speaker 1: No questions asked.

89
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:52,550
Speaker 1: And I was 50/50 on whether or not this insurance I bought by clicking on something on Amazon would work or not.

90
00:04:53,032 --> 00:04:57,710
Speaker 1: Like I was pretty much waiting to just either go to Amazon and be like, yo, replace it.

91
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,890
Speaker 1: This insurance was fake or just sue them in small claims court and get the money back.

92
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:04,670
Speaker 1: They were super responsive.

93
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:11,310
Speaker 1: Their website is like garbage tier, but like it's got clear stock images on it.

94
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,670
Speaker 1: Like pretty sure I know the enterprise software this company bought to drive this customer service portal.

95
00:05:18,232 --> 00:05:23,990
Speaker 1: Pretty sure most people who buy this kind of insurance never actually try to make a claim with it.

96
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,630
Speaker 1: So I made the claim and took them a while, but and they weren't that responsive.

97
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,130
Speaker 1: So today I was like, you know what, I actually want this camera back.

98
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,349
Speaker 1: Like I need it for Pax.

99
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,030
Speaker 1: Pax is a few months away.

100
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:41,110
Speaker 1: So I figure I should I should escalate and figure out if I have to go to small claims court or not.

101
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:44,770
Speaker 1: And I called them on the phone today and I was like, look, you guys haven't done shit.

102
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,496
Speaker 1: Where's my camera?

103
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,110
Speaker 1: And they were super apologetic.

104
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:50,310
Speaker 1: And they instantly figured out the problem.

105
00:05:50,470 --> 00:06:07,490
Speaker 1: And the problem was their service center is incapable of fixing this because the cost, the labor cost of taking the lens assembly apart to replace the part that was broken was more than the cost of just buying the entire lens assembly brand new.

106
00:06:08,834 --> 00:06:10,349
Speaker 1: And they didn't seem to want to deal with it.

107
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,429
Speaker 1: So I was like, so what are you going to do?

108
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,290
Speaker 1: And they were like, we are going to mail you a check for what you paid for the camera.

109
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:16,589
Speaker 1: You will get it this week.

110
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:17,439
Speaker 0: All right.

111
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:18,310
Speaker 1: So sure.

112
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,010
Speaker 1: Then I go look at Amazon, the camera I bought that I paid a lot of money for.

113
00:06:24,572 --> 00:06:27,890
Speaker 1: I am getting a check for the amount of money I paid.

114
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,949
Speaker 1: I can now buy that camera and have money left up.

115
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:36,930
Speaker 1: I can buy that camera for like eight hundred dollars less than what I paid.

116
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,290
Speaker 0: You can buy a GH5, though, which I have, which doesn't have a lens.

117
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:43,469
Speaker 0: You can just put any micro four thirds lenses on it.

118
00:06:44,272 --> 00:06:46,450
Speaker 1: It is good video lenses.

119
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,950
Speaker 0: You can just get them there for how much money?

120
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,916
Speaker 0: Which one do you want?

121
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:51,530
Speaker 0: As many as a wide selection.

122
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,970
Speaker 1: I would not get one as good as on this camcorder.

123
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:57,670
Speaker 1: And then I'd also have to buy an XLR adapter, which also ain't cheap.

124
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,530
Speaker 1: So I'm going to buy the exact same camera.

125
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,930
Speaker 0: All those things together would still be less than that giant camcorder.

126
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,650
Speaker 1: That giant camcorder is like twenty six hundred on Amazon.

127
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:10,550
Speaker 0: And it'd probably be a better camera to not for video, much larger sensor.

128
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,330
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

129
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,230
Speaker 0: It's like capable of making like actual films for like the theater.

130
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not what I need.

131
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,930
Speaker 1: I need things like XLR and all the like run and gun, like ease of use capabilities.

132
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:26,510
Speaker 0: You know, if you look at people outside who are running and gunning people making films, no one's using camcorders.

133
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:27,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know who's using camcorders?

134
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,690
Speaker 1: Journalists, mostly.

135
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:41,034
Speaker 1: So basically, even better, the check I'm getting is for what I paid, but I got a five percent discount because I used an Amazon card to buy it on Amazon and I'm going to buy it again.

136
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,510
Speaker 1: I'm going to get the five percent discount again.

137
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:53,412
Speaker 1: And all I mailed back to them was the camera, meaning I'm going to get the brand new camera again with the multi hundred dollar, extremely fancy battery that lasts forever.

138
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:59,370
Speaker 1: So I'm going to have two of those batteries, two of the chargers, two of everything plus the camera and I'll have made a profit.

139
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:00,909
Speaker 1: So that worked out.

140
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,050
Speaker 0: Rim keeps breaking his stuff on purpose because it keeps being rewarded for doing so.

141
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:13,813
Speaker 1: I would rather this camera not have broken because there were multiple instances where I would have used it, but they weren't like critical instances where I needed the camera.

142
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:15,830
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's talk about a whole bunch of gaming news.

143
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,930
Speaker 1: So gaming news, a lot of gaming news, gaming news.

144
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,990
Speaker 0: Number one, auto chess has exploded.

145
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,850
Speaker 0: Here is the cars predicted go back to keep nights.

146
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,633
Speaker 1: It's on record.

147
00:08:23,673 --> 00:08:28,167
Speaker 0: We predicted that you wouldn't even know an auto chess is a thing even now if it wasn't for me.

148
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,930
Speaker 1: Auto chess isn't even that fun.

149
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,290
Speaker 1: I'm already kind of done with it anyway.

150
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,610
Speaker 0: So here's the current state of auto chess.

151
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:40,630
Speaker 0: The original mod is still around, still guess being worked on, but it's sort of like, well, who knows how long it's going to live.

152
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,890
Speaker 0: People are sort of fleeing it, even though it might still be the best game wise, even though the UI is obviously still poopy.

153
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,927
Speaker 1: I would normally say it's going to be like the pub G, but it's not like.

154
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:56,330
Speaker 1: pub G was already pretty polished by the time they were competitors.

155
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:10,130
Speaker 0: The Chinese company that made the mod like Drodo or whatever the hell their name is, they made a different auto chess, which is basically great UI, you know, all new graphics, not dota license, but basically the same characters.

156
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:11,399
Speaker 0: Right.

157
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,250
Speaker 0: It's on mobile.

158
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,730
Speaker 0: It's on your tablet.

159
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,410
Speaker 0: They're going to put it on PC, but only in the epic store.

160
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've avoided the epic store so far.

161
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,292
Speaker 0: Right.

162
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:31,535
Speaker 0: But you have to either to play this game and to either make a Dragon Nest account, which is I got a Chinese website and I looked at that website or link to Facebook.

163
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:33,170
Speaker 1: I don't have a Facebook account.

164
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:33,673
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,770
Speaker 0: So it's all right.

166
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,650
Speaker 0: So that's that game.

167
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:36,358
Speaker 0: Right.

168
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,350
Speaker 0: People are into that one.

169
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,987
Speaker 0: It's probably the most advanced auto chess right now.

170
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:41,854
Speaker 0: Yeah.

171
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:46,790
Speaker 0: Then Valve made one based on Dota called Dota Underlords.

172
00:09:47,010 --> 00:10:00,430
Speaker 0: If you want to play Dota Underlords, you can either a pay ten dollars for a dota battle pass, which I did because I figured what the hell or people who have the Dota Underlords battle pass are getting today.

173
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,430
Speaker 0: They actually got codes to share with their friends.

174
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,490
Speaker 0: I'll share that with the room, I guess.

175
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:06,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can play Dota Underlords.

176
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,290
Speaker 0: It's super beta.

177
00:10:08,153 --> 00:10:11,250
Speaker 0: It's a little bit different from the regular auto chess, which is fine.

178
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,129
Speaker 0: It's faster and has a better UI.

179
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,050
Speaker 0: It's got some issues, though, in other departments.

180
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:16,352
Speaker 0: Right.

181
00:10:16,372 --> 00:10:19,410
Speaker 0: So that's Dota Underlords is progressing rather quickly.

182
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,321
Speaker 0: It's made by Valve.

183
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:20,948
Speaker 0: It's a real deal.

184
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,670
Speaker 0: Then the low valve making a game.

185
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,852
Speaker 0: Then the Lowell company Riot has made one called Teamfight Tactics, which is part of LoL.

186
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,809
Speaker 0: It's using LoL characters, League of Legends, by the way.

187
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:42,029
Speaker 1: You know, to this day, if I look at a random character, I will know that is clearly from a MOBA, but I don't know which MOBA they're from.

188
00:10:44,651 --> 00:10:52,688
Speaker 0: It is to play this game, you need to have a League of Legends account with something called honor level three, which I've been told takes a long time to show me your honor.

189
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:53,791
Speaker 1: Right.

190
00:10:54,052 --> 00:11:01,410
Speaker 0: So if you don't have a LoL account with honor level three, you have and you want to play this game, which is somewhat significantly different.

191
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,330
Speaker 0: The people, the NDA is lifted.

192
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,490
Speaker 0: So people who can play it are like talking about YouTube.

193
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,477
Speaker 0: You can learn all about it.

194
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,110
Speaker 0: It has a hex map.

195
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:08,792
Speaker 0: It's a little it's.

196
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:10,038
Speaker 0: it's you know, it's still.

197
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,993
Speaker 0: it's got like some more real drafting mechanics.

198
00:11:13,053 --> 00:11:18,750
Speaker 0: Maybe we're like, you know, it is like a carousel of characters and everyone picks one in order, right?

199
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:25,530
Speaker 0: So like that, you know, so it actually seems like a more maybe more interesting game, potentially also still super beta alpha.

200
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:30,770
Speaker 0: But in about some number of weeks, maybe a month, that'll be open to everyone.

201
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,770
Speaker 0: The Underlords should be open to everyone also in some short period of time.

202
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,632
Speaker 1: Yeah.

203
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:41,253
Speaker 0: So those are all the major competing auto chess games that aren't just garbage you can ignore.

204
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:44,590
Speaker 1: So this is to the expansion as predicted.

205
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:53,473
Speaker 0: We're going to see which one comes out on top and then that's going to be the one everyone's going to play, which could be one of these or it could be a dark horse coming out of nowhere.

206
00:11:53,533 --> 00:12:04,869
Speaker 1: Like this is this is the you're getting to watch in real time the earliest days of a basically new genre of gaming, kind of like the Fortnite like it's basically just sort of seven one.

207
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:11,010
Speaker 1: Well, it's a new genre of gaming for people who only play video games and have not experienced actual modern.

208
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:11,700
Speaker 0: It's a real.

209
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,349
Speaker 0: it's a fad.

210
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,843
Speaker 0: It's a. basically it's a. it's a board game that could not.

211
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:20,510
Speaker 0: it's a video game that is mostly a board game because it's mostly about making decisions.

212
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,950
Speaker 1: See, also sooner it's like sooner.

213
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:26,950
Speaker 0: Well, but the automatic combat would be very difficult to implement in a board game.

214
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've tried to.

215
00:12:27,754 --> 00:12:31,317
Speaker 1: I've workshopped like five different ways to make an actual board game with this.

216
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,129
Speaker 1: It just doesn't work.

217
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:35,330
Speaker 0: It's not fun, but it makes you take your turn fast.

218
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:44,270
Speaker 0: In fact, the Underlords is even though the actual game itself takes about the equal amount of time to regular original auto chess, the timers are shorter.

219
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:49,839
Speaker 0: So you Satan, but you're still sitting there for 30, 40 minutes, but it pushes you faster.

220
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:50,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,910
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that's auto chess news, Pokemon news, right?

222
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:55,918
Speaker 0: I knew this.

223
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,250
Speaker 0: I always question this.

224
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:01,230
Speaker 0: And now my question has been answered is there's so many fucking Pokemon.

225
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:02,990
Speaker 0: They keep adding more.

226
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:03,813
Speaker 0: Right.

227
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:11,210
Speaker 0: And even though in any individual Pokemon game and generation mainstream Pokemon game, there are only so many Pokemon in that game.

228
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:18,110
Speaker 0: You can still import Pokemon from old games and trade and do all sorts of shenanigans and get every Pokemon ever.

229
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:34,326
Speaker 0: Which means every new Pokemon generation, somebody working a game freak redoes all the art, all the noises, all the animations, all the everything for every single fucking Pokemon in the Pokedex from fucking what Bulbasaur,

230
00:13:34,507 --> 00:13:34,668
Speaker 1: which

231
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,286
Speaker 0: leads to all the way up to fucking legendary bullshit in the new game, which

232
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:44,295
Speaker 1: leads to interesting weird problems similar to an RPG is where people will never use their elixirs and their special items.

233
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:47,030
Speaker 1: People will like, will you even use the new Pokemon?

234
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,350
Speaker 0: It's like someone spent all that time to animate and make that new update Tangella for the newest generation.

235
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,134
Speaker 0: And it's like someone collects a Tangella, so they have a complete Pokedex and they never use it again.

236
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:02,470
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, is I always said, man, it must take a fucking long ass time.

237
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,910
Speaker 0: It was like an army of people drawing all these Pokemons.

238
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:10,670
Speaker 0: It's like, I guess it's doable because it's on like the DS and they're not that high res or high fidelity.

239
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:14,892
Speaker 0: But now the newest Pokemon game is on the switch and it's like they're adding more Pokemon.

240
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:21,990
Speaker 0: It's like, really, is somebody going to make fully animated 3D models of all thousand whatever fucking Pokemon there are?

241
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,948
Speaker 1: The answer is no.

242
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:24,850
Speaker 0: The answer is they're done.

243
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,872
Speaker 0: They're like they knew they couldn't keep that up forever until computers can do the work.

244
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:32,190
Speaker 0: Humans, too much work for humans.

245
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,830
Speaker 1: I think this is good news, actually.

246
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:34,930
Speaker 0: I think it is also good news.

247
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,135
Speaker 1: Pokemon games start to feel a little stagnant when you keep seeing the same Pokemon, like.

248
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,570
Speaker 1: you're not that inclined to use the new ones.

249
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,985
Speaker 1: You'll collect them, but then you go to like Pikachu, right?

250
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:45,414
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

251
00:14:45,474 --> 00:14:47,870
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the point is, I hope there's no Pikachu.

252
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,883
Speaker 1: I hope you can't get Pikachu.

253
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:49,390
Speaker 0: That'd be great.

254
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,161
Speaker 0: But it would be amazing.

255
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:50,689
Speaker 0: It's not true.

256
00:14:51,071 --> 00:15:06,730
Speaker 0: In Pokemon Sword and Shield, they are not going to have the laborers at Game Freak, the artists, make 3D models of three and full animations and full noises and full everything for every fucking Pokemon that's ever existed.

257
00:15:07,192 --> 00:15:16,254
Speaker 0: They are picking a subset of the world of Pokemon, and there are going to be Pokemon that have existed in prior generations that you simply cannot get in Sword and Shield.

258
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:17,489
Speaker 0: They're not in there.

259
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:18,790
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll add them later.

260
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,410
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll just never add them.

261
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,273
Speaker 1: This is fine.

262
00:15:21,313 --> 00:15:26,669
Speaker 1: It means people who have played Pokemon their entire lives, maybe there will be a way to get Spiritomb.

263
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,130
Speaker 0: Who knows what the final Pokemon list is going to be.

264
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,390
Speaker 1: But you'll be able to re-experience what it's like to have a world of all new Pokemon, and every Pokemon you find is like, whoa, what's this thing?

265
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,428
Speaker 0: It's still going to have way more Pokemon than Generation 1, so I don't know what you're complaining about.

266
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,829
Speaker 1: People are really butter about this.

267
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:48,958
Speaker 0: There was a funny meme going around where some, you know, some stupid person was like, whoa, what does it take?

268
00:15:48,999 --> 00:15:50,029
Speaker 0: Five minutes to draw Pokemon?

269
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,714
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

270
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:53,033
Speaker 1: And people, a bunch of... Well, that's the same.

271
00:15:53,073 --> 00:15:59,768
Speaker 1: That's the same reason why people say Barclay 2 raised one hundred and twenty thousand dollars and they couldn't make a AAA game.

272
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,289
Speaker 0: Well, they also fucked up.

273
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:06,730
Speaker 1: But one hundred and twenty thousand dollars in the game industry rounds down to zero dollars.

274
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:15,690
Speaker 0: The point is, a bunch of 3D artists went and tried to 3D model Pokemon in five minutes and then posted what they were able to accomplish in five minutes.

275
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,149
Speaker 0: And there were some really awesome Pokemon, five minute 3D Pokemons.

276
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:21,460
Speaker 0: Look them up.

277
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,049
Speaker 0: They're really good.

278
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:22,812
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:23,218
Speaker 0: All right.

280
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:23,970
Speaker 0: What was the next news?

281
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:34,369
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's funny because I was looking for this news and I found an article on Kotaku from 2011 that is titled, There are far too many Pokemon to care about.

282
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:35,009
Speaker 0: I agree.

283
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:41,451
Speaker 1: And I feel like it's time to move on from the original 151.

284
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:41,712
Speaker 0: Anyway.

285
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:46,490
Speaker 1: So in some other news, this isn't really this is very good gaming news at all.

286
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,358
Speaker 1: Gaming related.

287
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:48,090
Speaker 0: It's not gaming news.

288
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:48,735
Speaker 0: I can make it.

289
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:50,190
Speaker 1: I can make it gaming related.

290
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:57,309
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the point is, there's a story going around around about the recent Supreme Court decision, which reaffirmed what we all knew.

291
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:04,906
Speaker 0: But it's good to have it reaffirmed that there is no writer free speech in sort of a private context.

292
00:17:05,008 --> 00:17:05,130
Speaker 0: Right.

293
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:18,397
Speaker 0: If I have a private club, I can say in this club, no one may say any word beginning with the letter C or if I own a company and you wear a green shirt to work, I can fire you for it.

294
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:19,109
Speaker 0: Right.

295
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,829
Speaker 1: As long as it's not in a protected class of very specific things.

296
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:23,290
Speaker 0: Exactly.

297
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:29,010
Speaker 0: The Congress, the First Amendment says Congress shall make no law if the government isn't doing the censorship.

298
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:36,094
Speaker 0: If, you know, here on the Geek Nights podcast, I can censor any, you know, guests who come on.

299
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,050
Speaker 1: It's like the Geek Nights forum.

300
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,610
Speaker 1: If you say fascist stuff, you're immediately banned.

301
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,213
Speaker 0: Exactly.

302
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,569
Speaker 0: I hope we pay for that forum.

303
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:43,850
Speaker 0: It belongs to us.

304
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:44,315
Speaker 0: We can.

305
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:45,670
Speaker 0: we are the rulers there.

306
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:47,500
Speaker 0: There is no freedom of speech there.

307
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:49,230
Speaker 0: that was reaffirmed in this decision.

308
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,093
Speaker 0: And that is correct.

309
00:17:50,515 --> 00:17:57,150
Speaker 0: However, all these articles are pointing out that this correct decision was reaffirmed and making that the headline.

310
00:17:57,531 --> 00:18:09,610
Speaker 0: And then in the very last paragraph, they're burying the truth, which is that actually this Supreme Court decision, while reaffirming a true thing, that is correct, is probably bad news in this particular case.

311
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:10,977
Speaker 0: That's not.

312
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,450
Speaker 0: the ruling is totally wrong.

313
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:25,070
Speaker 0: So here's the case was involving a public access TV network in New York and the public access TV network in New York was managed by a nonprofit, which is a private entity.

314
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:28,130
Speaker 0: But it's still a public access network.

315
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:28,671
Speaker 0: Yeah.

316
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:28,934
Speaker 0: Right.

317
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,330
Speaker 0: That is a public thing.

318
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:37,230
Speaker 1: They're basically saying if you subcontract, if the government subcontracts, the subcontractor now can totally violate the First Amendment.

319
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:37,573
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:38,970
Speaker 1: That's basically what this ruling says.

321
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:48,110
Speaker 1: And it's notable that the conservative piece of shit justices on the Supreme Court were the ones in the majority on this and the good Supreme Court justices dissented.

322
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,490
Speaker 0: Right.

323
00:18:48,551 --> 00:18:54,950
Speaker 0: The dissenting judges weren't saying the wrong thing, which would be like, no, you get freedom of speech even in a private context.

324
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,110
Speaker 0: That's not they were saying at all.

325
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,490
Speaker 0: They were correctly saying, this is a public access TV network.

326
00:19:00,793 --> 00:19:01,850
Speaker 0: That's a government thing.

327
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:05,210
Speaker 0: It just happened to be subcontracted to a private nonprofit.

328
00:19:05,672 --> 00:19:06,217
Speaker 0: That doesn't.

329
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:07,790
Speaker 0: that's still a government thing.

330
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,070
Speaker 0: You still have to have freedom of speech on the public access TV network.

331
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:19,033
Speaker 0: Now, this is getting really private TV network that is completely owned by a private entity because there's a broader issue right now where there wouldn't even been a Supreme Court.

332
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:21,369
Speaker 0: They would have just said, OK, well, they wouldn't have brought it up.

333
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:28,518
Speaker 0: Conservatives and fascists are basically arguing for and as if they're not the same thing.

334
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:29,889
Speaker 1: I repeat myself.

335
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:37,092
Speaker 1: They're generally arguing that free speech must be protected on private social media networks.

336
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:44,010
Speaker 1: But they're doing this because conservative talking points tend to get people banned because they're racist.

337
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,470
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's everyone there's no point of even discussing.

338
00:19:47,611 --> 00:19:48,515
Speaker 0: It's just so obvious.

339
00:19:48,636 --> 00:19:51,490
Speaker 0: Everyone knows that there are people of principle.

340
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:51,971
Speaker 1: Yeah.

341
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:59,290
Speaker 0: And then there are people who just bring up whatever principle, you know, helps their side win in whatever the argument is.

342
00:19:59,471 --> 00:20:01,890
Speaker 0: They'll be like, you know, playing a hockey game.

343
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:02,192
Speaker 0: Yeah.

344
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:04,190
Speaker 0: And they'll say, oh, the tripping rule says this.

345
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,712
Speaker 0: You go in the box and then they'll trip someone and then say, no, no, no, that's not tripping.

346
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:13,929
Speaker 0: Even if it's identical, just they're just always arguing for the other team to go in the box and then not to.

347
00:20:14,232 --> 00:20:15,569
Speaker 0: There's no principle involved.

348
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:17,390
Speaker 0: So you just they're not in good faith.

349
00:20:17,471 --> 00:20:18,689
Speaker 0: You just ignore whatever they say.

350
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,212
Speaker 1: Well, like case in point, and they got last week's episode on breaking up tech companies.

351
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:26,734
Speaker 1: People like us want to break up big tech companies because they are a danger to society.

352
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:40,572
Speaker 1: But at the same time, conservatives also want to break up big tech companies because they fear the power of big tech companies who tend to side with not necessarily leftist, but at least more liberal or progressive policies because that's what they're employed.

353
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:45,470
Speaker 1: So it gets into a weird situation where two people want the same thing for opposite reasons.

354
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,682
Speaker 0: My point here is my beef is with every single news article I've seen about this story getting it wrong.

355
00:20:50,702 --> 00:20:50,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

356
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,771
Speaker 0: Right.

357
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:56,910
Speaker 0: And I want everyone to now hear the correct way the story should be read.

358
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,569
Speaker 1: It's notable that Scott, who never wants to talk about politics anyway, isn't about politics, is about the Supreme Court.

359
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,270
Speaker 1: The Supreme Court is pure politics.

360
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,990
Speaker 0: We talk about Supreme Court decisions on that all the time.

361
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:07,773
Speaker 1: The Supreme Court.

362
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,120
Speaker 0: That is the thing we talk about.

363
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,030
Speaker 0: government wise.

364
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,410
Speaker 1: Go back to 2006, and it's Scott being really mad about Rumsfeld.

365
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,830
Speaker 0: All we talk about is, you know, I think we were just talking about how he's a nut job who has a conspiracy nut style power points.

366
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,430
Speaker 1: Oh, you brought him up a lot.

367
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:31,369
Speaker 1: So if you are a subscriber to the night's page around, you can actually listen to all of the beta episodes of geek nights with commentary.

368
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,070
Speaker 1: And the point is Supreme Court talks about politics a lot.

369
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,470
Speaker 0: Geek nights will always talk about Supreme Court decisions.

370
00:21:39,871 --> 00:21:40,152
Speaker 1: Yeah.

371
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:45,818
Speaker 1: But I'm just pointing out that the Supreme Court is one hundred percent a partisan political entity.

372
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:46,970
Speaker 1: It is not special anymore.

373
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,570
Speaker 1: And currently it's compromised.

374
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:53,812
Speaker 1: I think the most recent two appointees of the Supreme Court should be removed from office.

375
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:57,630
Speaker 1: And I think the Democrats should stack the court in 2020.

376
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,235
Speaker 0: Go to move them.

377
00:21:59,464 --> 00:22:00,190
Speaker 1: I don't have that power.

378
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:00,675
Speaker 0: You do.

379
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:01,384
Speaker 0: I do not.

380
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,396
Speaker 1: You do.

381
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:03,570
Speaker 1: How do I have that power?

382
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,252
Speaker 0: You do.

383
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:08,250
Speaker 1: Do I think by voting in New York?

384
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:08,731
Speaker 1: No.

385
00:22:09,092 --> 00:22:15,550
Speaker 0: In a district that goes like there is only two ways to remove a Supreme Court justice from office.

386
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,008
Speaker 1: Don't go down that path.

387
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,142
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you have that power.

388
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:27,990
Speaker 1: The correct way to remove Supreme Court justices from office is to mitigate their power by doing what FDR threatened to do.

389
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:28,874
Speaker 1: And I want to bring back.

390
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:31,630
Speaker 1: Let's just put like 20 more people on the Supreme Court.

391
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:35,028
Speaker 1: Once the Democrats have control of Congress again, they can't stop us.

392
00:22:36,650 --> 00:23:00,990
Speaker 1: But anyway, keep an eye on this sort of thing, because generally the people who are freaking out the most about free speech, especially in the context of video games, are people who want to say the N-word and the F-word and the R-word in video game platforms and don't want their, quote unquote, free speech rights to be impinged upon by private entities who don't want them to say the N-word in video game platforms.

393
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,249
Speaker 1: In one last piece of news, that is really good news.

394
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,630
Speaker 1: Bloodstained ritual of the night.

395
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,715
Speaker 1: I kickstarted this thing.

396
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,090
Speaker 1: It feels like an infinite time.

397
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:11,469
Speaker 0: I kickstarted this as well.

398
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:21,790
Speaker 0: If you're not familiar, Iga, the creator of the real Castlevania Symphony of the Night, the, you know, Iga-venya master, decided to make his own game.

399
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,130
Speaker 0: He left the house that, you know, Simon Belmont built.

400
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:30,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, he went on his own with a Kickstarter a few years back.

401
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:30,884
Speaker 0: I kickstarted it.

402
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:37,190
Speaker 1: And not technically Castlevania, it's Byman Selmont fighting Alucard.

403
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:38,111
Speaker 0: Right.

404
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:44,269
Speaker 0: They released a game called Ritual of the Moon something something that was like an NES style tiny game.

405
00:23:45,251 --> 00:23:47,970
Speaker 0: But I got that because I was on the Kickstarter.

406
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:52,430
Speaker 0: But now, finally, after long last, the actual Bloodstained ritual of the night.

407
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,290
Speaker 1: I got an email with a code on Steam today.

408
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,030
Speaker 0: I did not because I chose the Switch version.

409
00:23:58,212 --> 00:24:00,390
Speaker 1: I regret not choosing the Switch version.

410
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,910
Speaker 0: The Switch version is coming out next week.

411
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,494
Speaker 0: I'll trade you.

412
00:24:02,514 --> 00:24:04,270
Speaker 0: I'll give you my Switch code if you give me your Steam code.

413
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I didn't know about the 30 FPS thing.

414
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:07,649
Speaker 1: And now that I know that, I kind of don't want to switch.

415
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,369
Speaker 0: Apparently, people are saying that the Switch version is 30 FPS locked in.

416
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,870
Speaker 0: So maybe I'll pay money for the Steam version when I get home.

417
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:23,950
Speaker 1: I bought Wargroove on Steam to stream it and on the Switch because I prefer playing games like that on the Switch.

418
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,330
Speaker 1: You know, maybe I re-bought Slay the Spire on the Switch.

419
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,828
Speaker 0: I'm just going to wait a week and get the Switch version I already played for and just deal with it.

420
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,669
Speaker 1: Here's the reality, Scott.

421
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,290
Speaker 0: I have enough games to play for the next week.

422
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:34,867
Speaker 0: I don't need to buy.

423
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:39,510
Speaker 1: 30 FPS does not matter to people like you and me for a game like this.

424
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,550
Speaker 1: It matters to one class of people, speedrunners.

425
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,090
Speaker 1: That's right.

426
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,369
Speaker 1: That is something we are not and never will be.

427
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the game is out now, except on Switch.

428
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,730
Speaker 1: Pretty hype about it.

429
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,630
Speaker 0: It'll be out on Switch next week.

430
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,630
Speaker 1: I've been waiting for this for a while.

431
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:54,369
Speaker 1: It's good to see.

432
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:02,550
Speaker 0: It's supposedly, on paper, a game much like Castlevania, the Symphony of the Night, only much larger with a lot of extra things.

433
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,050
Speaker 0: They're giving you a ton of free DLCs, you can customize your character.

434
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,790
Speaker 1: I mean, Wikipedia even says genre Metroidvania.

435
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,669
Speaker 0: This game is supposedly lit.

436
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,269
Speaker 0: People are playing it right now.

437
00:25:14,371 --> 00:25:15,369
Speaker 0: I can go watch on Twitch.

438
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:17,948
Speaker 0: I'll see if we're going to find out how good it is.

439
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:25,830
Speaker 1: Yep, because like I say, off and on gig nights, there are a few things that I want unique experiences that I want to walk away from those experiences.

440
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:29,970
Speaker 1: But then there are some things where I just want that same thing forever.

441
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:30,850
Speaker 0: I didn't get enough.

442
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:31,729
Speaker 1: Like a good cookie?

443
00:25:32,171 --> 00:25:32,830
Speaker 0: I'll just keep eating.

444
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,550
Speaker 1: If there's a good sugar cookie, I'll just keep eating sugar cookies.

445
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:35,810
Speaker 0: Right.

446
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,349
Speaker 0: There's a limit.

447
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,550
Speaker 0: There's a limit at point at which I'm sick of cookie.

448
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:40,510
Speaker 0: But it's like one delicious cookie.

449
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:43,650
Speaker 0: It's like you got to make that same delicious cookie you made last time.

450
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:43,986
Speaker 0: I got it.

451
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,909
Speaker 0: I got to have some more of that pie, tree trunks.

452
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:46,437
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,849
Speaker 1: It's like I finish all the Metroidvanias that were good and my brain just said, yo, you need some more of that.

454
00:25:53,172 --> 00:25:56,550
Speaker 1: I watched all the ghosts in the shell standalone complexes there are in my brain.

455
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,390
Speaker 1: Just said, yo, you need some more of that.

456
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,630
Speaker 0: It's like you don't need to make 10 of them at some point.

457
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,887
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, just make one more.

458
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:03,067
Speaker 0: Just one more.

459
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:03,890
Speaker 0: So here we go.

460
00:26:04,472 --> 00:26:06,690
Speaker 0: We got our one more Igavania.

461
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,430
Speaker 0: If if this does well, we'll see if it's actually any good.

463
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,070
Speaker 0: It could be garbage.

464
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,069
Speaker 1: If it's actually really good.

465
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:14,586
Speaker 1: Who knows?

466
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,930
Speaker 1: This bodes well for the future of me getting even more good Metroidvanias.

467
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:19,769
Speaker 0: Yeah.

468
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:29,840
Speaker 1: But now it's time for things of the day.

469
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,776
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

470
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:37,018
Speaker 0: So you could imagine if you were in the Navy, perhaps the Royal Navy or the U.S.

471
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,199
Speaker 0: Navy, you know, one thing that you have to train for in the Navy is what if you're on a fucking boat that's sinking?

472
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,259
Speaker 0: Damage control.

473
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:59,419
Speaker 1: It's weird because I know a lot about like naval aviation and naval damage control in the context of World War Two, but only from like this high level of like the differences in like how Japan approached it versus the United States.

474
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,320
Speaker 0: The point is, is that that is the thing you have to be prepared and trained in.

475
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,020
Speaker 0: If you are going to be in a Navy as a sailor, right.

476
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:10,020
Speaker 0: What to do if the boat is sinking, there's holes in the boat, waters coming in.

477
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,479
Speaker 0: What do you do about it?

478
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,400
Speaker 0: That is like one of your jobs is to deal with that situation.

479
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,680
Speaker 0: But on a high level, you obviously are going to need training for that situation.

480
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,700
Speaker 0: It's not something you can wait to learn.

481
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:28,980
Speaker 0: And I mean, even if you learn it on paper, you can't wait to, you know, actual get real world experience doing it in when it actually happens and your boat got torpedoed.

482
00:27:29,201 --> 00:27:32,720
Speaker 0: You also can't go out in a real fucking boat torpedo it.

483
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:37,720
Speaker 0: And then because that would be dangerous and stupid and a waste of a boat and a torpedo.

484
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,923
Speaker 1: Yep.

485
00:27:39,204 --> 00:27:46,580
Speaker 1: Also, it's the kind of thing where you need muscle memory, like you have to react to this very quickly or the ship will sink and everyone dies.

486
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,018
Speaker 0: You have to get really good at it.

487
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:59,020
Speaker 0: So apparently they have these simulators, which is basically a complete reconstruction of exactly what the fuck it's like in a Navy ship.

488
00:27:59,561 --> 00:27:59,903
Speaker 0: Right.

489
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:04,400
Speaker 0: And they friggin break holes in it and blast water into it.

490
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:08,960
Speaker 0: And they can raise the water level, lower the water level, adjust the temperature.

491
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:28,340
Speaker 0: They can rock the boat, do all sorts of ridiculous shit to, you know, blow smoke in there, do everything to completely simulate what it's like to be on a boat that just got fucked the fuck up and give you the tools and whatever so that you can try to repair it and not drown and not die and keep the boat float.

492
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:38,500
Speaker 0: And this is exactly one of those series of video showing complete amateurs doing exactly that, going inside the thing and trying not to drown.

493
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,140
Speaker 1: I love how they put it on like baby mode.

494
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,900
Speaker 0: They put it on easy mode and it takes them like 20 minutes.

495
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:49,904
Speaker 0: And then they show they briefly show some people on promo doing it in like almost no time at all.

496
00:28:50,426 --> 00:28:56,600
Speaker 1: But I guess what I was getting at is that like you read a CS Forrester book like Horatio Hornblower and you read all this like naval stuff.

497
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,979
Speaker 1: You're like, oh, yeah, this makes sense.

498
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:04,359
Speaker 1: But then when you think about it, you can't actually describe what people actually specifically did at any point in that book.

499
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:10,619
Speaker 1: So when you think about how do they stop a ship from sinking when a hole got blown in the side, the fuck do they actually do?

500
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:16,177
Speaker 0: Apparently, you take wedges of wood and hammer them into the hole and they fill the hole up enough to stop the water.

501
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:19,039
Speaker 0: And I guess you come back later and put in a real fix.

502
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,660
Speaker 0: It's very low, probably involves welding, I imagine.

503
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:26,927
Speaker 1: But the fact that it's very low tech, because that is still the most effective way to do this kind of thing.

504
00:29:26,948 --> 00:29:27,759
Speaker 0: You're in a fucking hurry.

505
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,824
Speaker 0: There's a hole in your right.

506
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:35,401
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you got to imagine if you shove a bunch of wood and you hammer it into a hole, it's going to fill it and it's going to block the water.

507
00:29:35,662 --> 00:29:45,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you just got to block it enough so the ship doesn't sink so you can finish the battle and then go deal with it later, drain out the water, not die, keep the boat afloat.

508
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,020
Speaker 1: This like this would be an amazing thing to do.

509
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,900
Speaker 1: Like I would love to go into the simulator.

510
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,040
Speaker 0: Well, go start a water park and make one of these as an attraction at the water park.

511
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:54,524
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

512
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,300
Speaker 0: I mean, this is cheap.

513
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:57,439
Speaker 0: You can buy one of these, right?

514
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,364
Speaker 0: You can afford it.

515
00:30:00,927 --> 00:30:04,979
Speaker 1: I mean, Tom Scott got his friends to go and do it, but I'm sure we don't have as much clout as him.

516
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,100
Speaker 1: He's got one million subscribers.

517
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:09,740
Speaker 0: Tom Scott person is apparently some British.

518
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,440
Speaker 1: I like a lot of his videos.

519
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,559
Speaker 0: OK, I never heard of him before.

520
00:30:14,002 --> 00:30:23,560
Speaker 1: And if you if you want to get a good last name, if you watch a lot of videos that are like, hey, here's how this thing works, you'll start to see Tom Scott videos popping up a lot in a general sense.

521
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,760
Speaker 0: He doesn't seem to be a YouTube shouty man, at least not from this video.

522
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,542
Speaker 1: It's pretty chill.

523
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:32,960
Speaker 1: So this is just a really cute comic that a Twitter person did a long time ago back in 2012.

524
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,344
Speaker 1: It's short.

525
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,699
Speaker 1: It's like two tweets worth of.

526
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:41,322
Speaker 1: It's basically a really short indie zine and it's just about Sonic and Tails getting rings.

527
00:30:41,724 --> 00:30:42,387
Speaker 1: And it's just like.

528
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:46,378
Speaker 1: it's the kind of thing that an old movie like I might have seen this at a mocha.

529
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,443
Speaker 1: You might have.

530
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:48,166
Speaker 1: It's just.

531
00:30:48,508 --> 00:30:53,920
Speaker 1: this is exactly the kind of thing that if I saw it at a mocha, I'd be really excited about and have a lot of good things to say.

532
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:54,962
Speaker 1: It's short to the point.

533
00:30:54,982 --> 00:31:05,180
Speaker 1: it captures some of these like very specific feels from playing old Sonic games in a really earnest, heartfelt and succinct way.

534
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,020
Speaker 0: I thought you hate old Sonic.

535
00:31:06,703 --> 00:31:08,560
Speaker 1: I like old Sonic games to a point.

536
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,420
Speaker 1: There are two and a half good Sonic games that were ever made.

537
00:31:12,964 --> 00:31:13,779
Speaker 1: That's what I'm going to say.

538
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:16,440
Speaker 1: And I just I really like this comic.

539
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,104
Speaker 1: It's really cute.

540
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:19,421
Speaker 1: And I think you should like it and you should follow this person on Twitter.

541
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:28,026
Speaker 1: In the moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book was the pages of pain this Thursday.

542
00:31:28,248 --> 00:31:29,439
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about this book.

543
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,958
Speaker 1: Finally, it's I hope you read it.

544
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,436
Speaker 1: We're going to assume you read it.

545
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,000
Speaker 0: There is might have been too painful.

546
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,298
Speaker 0: Maybe the people who read it are not listening because they're dead.

547
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,280
Speaker 0: There is no or in pain.

548
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:44,100
Speaker 1: I saw a handful of people liked my tweet about King of the Hill describing this book.

549
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,060
Speaker 1: So I assume those people read this book.

550
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,719
Speaker 0: Maybe they read it just because they're D&D nerds.

551
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,940
Speaker 0: Maybe because it's book club.

552
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,001
Speaker 1: I feel like most people who read this book or read it in the 90s because they were D&D nerds.

553
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:57,420
Speaker 1: Not me, but I I got a lot to say about this.

554
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:01,100
Speaker 1: And there is no world where I will explain to you the plot of this book.

555
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,000
Speaker 1: We are just going to react to it, assuming you read the same painful pages we read.

556
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,700
Speaker 0: We've all experienced the same pain.

557
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,323
Speaker 0: Yeah.

558
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,140
Speaker 0: We can now share our pain together on Thursday.

559
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,127
Speaker 1: Foot for a leg.

560
00:32:11,147 --> 00:32:12,036
Speaker 1: Here we go.

561
00:32:13,381 --> 00:32:14,799
Speaker 0: And literally hand for a foot.

562
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

563
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:16,980
Speaker 1: Hand for well, hand for a foot.

564
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,914
Speaker 1: And I'm not sure like how far up the ankle that went.

565
00:32:20,236 --> 00:32:21,120
Speaker 0: foot for a leg.

566
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:21,928
Speaker 0: That's not a thing.

567
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:23,080
Speaker 0: No, the hand for a foot.

568
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:23,984
Speaker 1: No, you remember.

569
00:32:24,024 --> 00:32:24,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was the.

570
00:32:25,129 --> 00:32:28,384
Speaker 1: I forget the quote where there was the guy that Dr.

571
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:31,077
Speaker 1: Nick fucked up real bad in The Simpsons, Mr.

572
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,499
Speaker 1: He did a rhyme and I forget the rhyme.

573
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,133
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's not on the level of seed and feed.

574
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:42,000
Speaker 1: But otherwise, we don't have any console packs.

575
00:32:42,683 --> 00:32:43,899
Speaker 1: We're just hanging out.

576
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:46,239
Speaker 1: We're going to judge some anime coming up soon.

577
00:32:46,602 --> 00:32:46,844
Speaker 0: Yep.

578
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:48,300
Speaker 1: That's all we got.

579
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,758
Speaker 1: We're just hanging out, making content.

580
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,320
Speaker 1: Well, whenever it's going to be rainy for like the next two weeks.

581
00:32:53,722 --> 00:32:56,119
Speaker 1: So we might start streaming some games because what else are we going to do?

582
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:57,247
Speaker 1: Can't go biking.

583
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,120
Speaker 0: No, we can go back in this weekend.

584
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,920
Speaker 0: It'll be Saturday and Sunday.

585
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,699
Speaker 0: It's going to be not raining.

586
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:04,640
Speaker 1: Oh, my bike will be back from the shop by then.

587
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,328
Speaker 0: Let's bike far.

588
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:06,299
Speaker 1: Maybe I will.

589
00:33:07,382 --> 00:33:09,048
Speaker 1: OK, people are saying I got to look into.

590
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:16,740
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of parkways get closed in the Bronx and north of the Bronx on particular Sundays, apparently or something.

591
00:33:17,382 --> 00:33:18,917
Speaker 0: I'll show you how to go to the good path.

592
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:29,820
Speaker 1: Well, I know one good way is the way I didn't know before is instead of going to Randall's Island and then going over the RFK into the Bronx, you go off a Randall's Island, a different way, and it goes under.

593
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,644
Speaker 1: It doesn't go over the RFK, but it goes to the Bronx in like a secret way and connects to a bike path.

594
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:38,186
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where I go all the time past the New York Post, the Bronx connector.

595
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:39,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Bronx connector.

596
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,308
Speaker 1: That's the best path.

597
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,900
Speaker 0: If we go where I want to take you.

598
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,025
Speaker 0: That's where we're going to go.

599
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:47,164
Speaker 1: I run over there actually kind of often as part of my half marathon route.

600
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,099
Speaker 0: If you should follow me on Saturday or Sunday, we'll go some.

601
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,238
Speaker 0: I'll take you to a good place.

602
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,319
Speaker 1: So games of Hyrule, the back story is there is a game on PC.

603
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,060
Speaker 0: Oh, no, there's more back story than that.

604
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,440
Speaker 0: We were at a PAX years ago and we saw this game in an indie booth or some shit.

605
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:06,959
Speaker 0: And I said, what the hell is that?

606
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,360
Speaker 1: And it was someone was on a DDR pad.

607
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,060
Speaker 0: It was on a DDR, but I was like, so that got my attention right away.

608
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,100
Speaker 1: And they were playing a rogue like rhythm game.

609
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,739
Speaker 0: And I said, holy fuck.

610
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:18,811
Speaker 0: I took the card.

611
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:19,580
Speaker 0: I took a photo.

612
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:22,199
Speaker 0: I was all over that jam.

613
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,569
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

614
00:34:23,831 --> 00:34:24,540
Speaker 0: I was all over that.

615
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:26,860
Speaker 0: And then the game finally came out.

616
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,281
Speaker 0: And when it finally came out, I was into it for like a week and then I didn't stick with it.

617
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:35,739
Speaker 0: But rim stuck with it and is maybe are you the top rhythm dancer on earth?

618
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:36,646
Speaker 0: Maybe.

619
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:38,460
Speaker 1: No, I'm real good at this game.

620
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:39,500
Speaker 0: The top necro dancer.

621
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:44,480
Speaker 1: But I'm probably in like the top several hundred because I've seen some AGD cues.

622
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,384
Speaker 1: Holy fuck.

623
00:34:46,511 --> 00:34:47,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am not like that.

624
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,239
Speaker 1: I've beaten the game.

625
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,900
Speaker 0: So there are people who have truly become necro master dancer.

626
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,380
Speaker 1: I have beaten the game all the way to the end.

627
00:34:56,042 --> 00:34:59,839
Speaker 0: I have not even done that with every character except one.

628
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,860
Speaker 1: Fuck that character character, the one that dies in one hit.

629
00:35:04,262 --> 00:35:06,080
Speaker 0: Oh, no, no, no, no.

630
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Speaker 0: I would not be able to beat the game with that character.

631
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,259
Speaker 1: Basically, imagine like the final form of this game is beat it.

632
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:15,200
Speaker 1: You can't like pick up a lot of things.

633
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:17,520
Speaker 1: If you ever miss a beat, you die instantly.

634
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,980
Speaker 1: If you ever get hit, you die instantly.

635
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:19,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, fuck that.

636
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,160
Speaker 1: I've seen speed runs of people beating the game with that character.

637
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:22,646
Speaker 0: Whoa.

638
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:31,260
Speaker 1: But the important I'll link to our review of this game from twenty fourteen, because the important yeah, the important parts of necro dancer.

639
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,659
Speaker 0: Five years ago, it actually came out.

640
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,578
Speaker 0: What packs did we fucking see it?

641
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,607
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

642
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:37,980
Speaker 1: Time is moving.

643
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,514
Speaker 0: Six, seven years ago, it affects.

644
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:40,060
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

645
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:41,799
Speaker 1: Back then, you know what panel we did?

647
00:35:42,282 --> 00:35:43,558
Speaker 1: How to win every game.

648
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,100
Speaker 1: The precursor to the much better play dirty to win panel.

649
00:35:48,281 --> 00:35:52,215
Speaker 0: So at a recent Nintendo was, you know, thing they.

650
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,639
Speaker 0: now they showed this game and we're like, holy fuck.

651
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:05,220
Speaker 0: The people who made Necro Dancer made it officially licensed Nintendo Switch exclusive game called The Legend of Zelda Cadence of Hyrule.

652
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,880
Speaker 0: It is just crypt of the necro dancer with a Zelda theme on it.

653
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,560
Speaker 1: The last time this happened were the Phillips CDI games.

654
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:17,680
Speaker 0: And well, I mean, this you know, this that came out for a different platform.

655
00:36:18,002 --> 00:36:20,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, this was made with Nintendo's supervision.

656
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:21,223
Speaker 0: Right.

657
00:36:21,244 --> 00:36:22,439
Speaker 0: Nintendo asked for this to be made.

658
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they asked for this to be made.

659
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,360
Speaker 1: But it's basically just necro dancer with a Hyrule theme.

660
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,600
Speaker 0: And it just came out for the Nintendo Switch.

661
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,758
Speaker 0: What, two days ago?

662
00:36:33,201 --> 00:36:35,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have already played it a bunch.

663
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Speaker 1: I beat one of the dungeons.

664
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:37,044
Speaker 0: Right.

665
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:38,639
Speaker 0: I really like it.

666
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,679
Speaker 0: I played it a whole bunch yesterday and today.

667
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:42,303
Speaker 1: Yup.

668
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:44,679
Speaker 0: So I went and the day it came out, I played a little bit.

669
00:36:44,941 --> 00:36:48,120
Speaker 0: So if you have never actually might have been late last week, it came out.

670
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,519
Speaker 1: So if you have never played Crypt of the Necro Dancer, then all I will say is that this game is probably good and you will like it.

671
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:04,739
Speaker 1: But if you've never played Crypt of the Necro Dancer, this game will be hard as balls for you until you get used to it.

672
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:05,325
Speaker 0: Right.

673
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:06,339
Speaker 0: So here's how the game holds.

674
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:06,922
Speaker 1: No punch.

675
00:37:06,963 --> 00:37:07,184
Speaker 1: Right.

676
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:15,160
Speaker 0: Is that you walk around and if there are no bad guys on the screen at the present time, you can just walk around and do whatever the hell you want.

677
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:16,284
Speaker 0: Yup.

678
00:37:16,304 --> 00:37:22,180
Speaker 0: However, it's basically sort of like a Zelda game, except every time you move, you hop exactly one space because it's a grid.

679
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,580
Speaker 1: Yup.

680
00:37:23,144 --> 00:37:29,360
Speaker 0: But as soon as there is at least one enemy on screen, there's a rhythm thing appears at the bottom and the music cranks up.

681
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,260
Speaker 1: So you play like up, left, sword, up, up, bomb, sword, fight.

682
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:33,721
Speaker 0: Right.

683
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:37,460
Speaker 0: Once that appears, it's not like DDR where there's like some sequence or anything.

684
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:41,840
Speaker 0: It's a steady rhythm and you must press buttons, right?

685
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,987
Speaker 0: You can stop pressing.

686
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:46,468
Speaker 0: You can just like let go and the world will just be like, well, we're going to keep going.

687
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:48,160
Speaker 0: The world will just move on the beat.

688
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,420
Speaker 0: So on the beat, the enemies move, they move.

689
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:50,742
Speaker 0: Right.

690
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:52,900
Speaker 0: And then on the beat, things happen.

691
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,800
Speaker 0: And if there's a projectile, it moves one space on the beat.

692
00:37:56,201 --> 00:38:03,780
Speaker 0: But you're expected to, if you put inputs in the game, to put exactly one input in at a time and depress the inputs on the beats.

693
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:07,460
Speaker 0: If you press the inputs in between the beats, then it says you're off the beat.

694
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:13,900
Speaker 0: And if you stay on the beat, that helps your character greatly increases damage and it's just generally good to do that.

695
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:14,761
Speaker 0: Right.

696
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:20,480
Speaker 0: If you want to, you can play not a worst game, not a baby game, not easy mode.

697
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,440
Speaker 1: Just a different game.

698
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,267
Speaker 0: Just a different game.

699
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:23,680
Speaker 0: You can turn off the rhythm.

700
00:38:24,641 --> 00:38:28,680
Speaker 0: And in which case that will put your game into a different mode where nothing moves.

701
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,820
Speaker 1: It's like playing as Monk in NecroDancer.

702
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,084
Speaker 0: Right.

703
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:31,899
Speaker 0: Nothing moves.

704
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,660
Speaker 0: And if you press an input, then everything will move one space when you put an input in.

705
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:42,184
Speaker 0: It's actually a significantly different game because you sort of lose the ability to wait.

706
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:44,120
Speaker 0: I think maybe you can push a button to wait.

707
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:44,636
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

708
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,179
Speaker 1: You can only push a button to wait if you have an item to use that will waste a beat, like the drum.

709
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,240
Speaker 1: Like the drum is so important because you can just drum, drum, drum and stand there and wait for something to happen.

710
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,661
Speaker 0: Right.

711
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:55,983
Speaker 0: Anyway.

712
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,300
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's a different game.

713
00:38:58,641 --> 00:38:58,863
Speaker 0: Right.

714
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,140
Speaker 0: But the enemies have the same behaviors and everything.

715
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,720
Speaker 0: So it's a roguelike game.

716
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,180
Speaker 0: The map, I think, is procedurally generated.

717
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:09,539
Speaker 0: But then it just stays that way because the map we were just playing co-op just now.

718
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,200
Speaker 0: That map was different from the map in my game.

719
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,878
Speaker 0: That was not the same map.

720
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,080
Speaker 1: But it seems like it's procedurally generated for each play through.

721
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:17,680
Speaker 1: Yes.

722
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:23,000
Speaker 1: So you can basically play a Zelda game with a kind of a random seed.

723
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,095
Speaker 1: But it's all magic.

724
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:32,340
Speaker 0: If you got a whole overworld and the over when you say new game, you start a new save file, it creates a whole overworld within certain constraints.

725
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:32,881
Speaker 0: Right.

726
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:36,719
Speaker 0: You know, certain things have to exist and you play it.

727
00:39:37,182 --> 00:39:39,400
Speaker 0: And then if you start a new game, you get a new map.

728
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,878
Speaker 0: So you can beat the game and replay it and get a new ish experience each time.

729
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:56,659
Speaker 1: So in terms of the details, how you play, because if you've never played Necrodancer, it takes a little bit of getting used to because you can't just fight a monster by stabbing it a bunch like you would in, say, Zelda three.

730
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,001
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,740
Speaker 0: You don't even have an attack button to attack.

732
00:39:58,882 --> 00:40:00,239
Speaker 0: You just move into a monster.

733
00:40:00,381 --> 00:40:00,602
Speaker 1: Yep.

734
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,660
Speaker 1: And different swords and weapons will attack in different patterns.

735
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:15,580
Speaker 0: In fact, if you move in a direction and it is such that your weapon can hit an enemy in that direction based on what weapon you have equipped, instead of moving, you will simply turn and attack instead of moving.

736
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:24,021
Speaker 1: But what playing this game is really like is more like there'll be a bunch of monsters on screen and some environmental hazards and things and or a dungeon to explore or whatever.

737
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:29,658
Speaker 1: And you basically to beat a monster, you have to figure out the pattern that monster exists in.

738
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,082
Speaker 1: Right.

739
00:40:30,243 --> 00:40:32,840
Speaker 1: And then rhythmically deal with that monster.

740
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,920
Speaker 1: Like some monsters will go move, move, wait, attack.

741
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:40,360
Speaker 1: So you want to go like move, attack, attack, and then move away before it attacks.

742
00:40:40,922 --> 00:40:41,063
Speaker 1: Right.

743
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:43,039
Speaker 1: Some monsters, you got to get behind him and hit him.

744
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:43,902
Speaker 0: Right.

745
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:50,005
Speaker 0: Every monster has a visual set of animations and poses that signal what it's about to do.

746
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,840
Speaker 0: So, for example, there is a mushroom monster.

747
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,820
Speaker 1: He goes like, wait, wait, I'm going to explode, explode.

748
00:40:56,041 --> 00:40:56,183
Speaker 0: Right.

749
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,259
Speaker 0: So he doesn't move at all.

750
00:40:57,601 --> 00:41:03,571
Speaker 0: So what you have to do is you have to approach him so that you land next to the mushroom monster.

751
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:03,692
Speaker 0: Right.

752
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,180
Speaker 0: With it, you have to move such that you land one space away from it on a frame in which it is not exploding.

753
00:41:11,562 --> 00:41:14,500
Speaker 0: So that way on the next frame, you can just attack it and kill it.

754
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:26,599
Speaker 0: If you move into it at the wrong time, you move in like if it's in the car, if it's currently in the about to explode phase and you're two spaces away from it and you move towards it, you get hit.

755
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:29,580
Speaker 0: You have to move, say, down so it explodes.

756
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:32,560
Speaker 0: You don't get hit, then move towards it, then up.

757
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,440
Speaker 0: Now you're next to it and then you can hit it and it's not exploded.

758
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:45,500
Speaker 0: Now, before you think this might sound simple that there are if you only had to deal with one enemy at a time on the screen and just a big old empty screen, the game would be easy as balls.

759
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:58,760
Speaker 1: You could beat the biggest, badest boss right at the start to a degree, because the bosses and even like a lot of the monsters, there's a huge variety and they exhibit sometimes extremely complex behavior.

760
00:41:58,926 --> 00:41:59,218
Speaker 1: They do.

761
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,660
Speaker 1: The patterns may be very long, may like some monsters are very difficult to deal with even by themselves.

762
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,979
Speaker 0: Some of them, you got to use items on this.

763
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,060
Speaker 0: You know, it's like a Zelda game.

764
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,340
Speaker 0: You still have items like bomb, boomerang, all kinds of stuff.

765
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:11,600
Speaker 1: Yep.

766
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:18,296
Speaker 1: Now, one thing that's very different from Necrodancer, other than the fact that, you know, all the Zelda stuff in the overworld and everything is better.

767
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,479
Speaker 1: The music is just a road like go to a dungeon, then another dungeon and then another dungeon.

768
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:34,000
Speaker 1: This game has an overworld with Zelda puzzles like Zelda three style and dungeons and all the trappings, but projectiles in Necrodancer are basically all just hitscan.

769
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:42,380
Speaker 1: In this game, projectiles have a variety of complex behavior, which is something I am not used to or prepared for.

770
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:43,560
Speaker 0: You got to get the boomerang.

771
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,520
Speaker 0: It is like essential.

772
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:47,400
Speaker 0: It makes everything so much easier.

773
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:50,119
Speaker 1: The bow is really good, too, but it takes some getting used to.

774
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:50,999
Speaker 0: And you got to get arrows.

775
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are consumable items.

776
00:42:54,187 --> 00:42:55,300
Speaker 0: There are weapons you can get.

777
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,600
Speaker 0: The weapons are just constantly used weapons.

778
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,257
Speaker 0: But some weapons are glass weapons, which are super strong, but they eventually break and wear out.

779
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, like there are it's got all the tropes of Necrodancer.

780
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,638
Speaker 1: There'll be shops.

781
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,600
Speaker 1: You can buy items.

782
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,420
Speaker 1: Items wear out and eventually disappear.

783
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:13,640
Speaker 0: Consumable weapons like shovels, torches, things like that, which you constantly use.

784
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,180
Speaker 0: They wear out.

785
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:14,858
Speaker 0: You got to get more.

786
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,338
Speaker 1: But then you get permanent things like the down stab or the hook shot.

787
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:18,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

788
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,019
Speaker 0: There are bombs which are consumable as you use them.

789
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:22,800
Speaker 0: Right.

790
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,999
Speaker 0: There's such a wide variety of just stuff, just like, I don't know, a fucking Zelda game or a road like.

791
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:28,409
Speaker 1: Yep.

792
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,880
Speaker 1: Now, the thing that really stands out because the game's like good.

793
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,380
Speaker 1: It is very hard.

794
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,100
Speaker 1: Like, do not go into this thinking it'll be easy.

795
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,920
Speaker 1: If you do not like very difficult games, you will get sick of this after an hour.

796
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,755
Speaker 0: Another thing is that this game, you know, you just can sort of go.

797
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:46,740
Speaker 0: every it's like there's.

798
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:50,280
Speaker 0: it's not really that it's hard as it is hard, but it's like Zelda one.

799
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,120
Speaker 1: You can go to really dangerous places right away if you're dumb.

800
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:54,220
Speaker 0: Super hard.

801
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,914
Speaker 0: It's just a learning curve on.

802
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:56,560
Speaker 0: it is busted.

803
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,776
Speaker 0: There's a tutorial that is literally like less than a minute long.

804
00:44:00,997 --> 00:44:05,780
Speaker 0: that has you fight like the most basic bad guys one on one, and then they throw you in the fire.

805
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,857
Speaker 0: Go, go, go.

806
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:07,664
Speaker 0: You're on next thing.

807
00:44:07,684 --> 00:44:08,912
Speaker 0: you know, you're on a screen with like.

808
00:44:09,214 --> 00:44:12,780
Speaker 0: they're simple bad guys, but there's like eight of them and they're all mixed up together.

809
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,480
Speaker 0: So even though you could deal with any one of them individually, no problem.

810
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,500
Speaker 0: There are eight coming at you all together.

811
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,660
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of other crazy shit on the screen.

812
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,280
Speaker 0: Each screen is like a big mess of stuff you got to deal with.

813
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:29,439
Speaker 1: It feel it gives me a lot of the feels I had when I first played Zelda one as a kid, because I wasn't good at video games yet.

814
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:33,240
Speaker 1: So like I'd go to a screen when suddenly I see all these mob limbs.

815
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,380
Speaker 1: I've never seen a mob limb before.

816
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,260
Speaker 1: I was my nocturox.

817
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:35,900
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, shit.

818
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:37,059
Speaker 1: And they feel real dangerous.

819
00:44:37,862 --> 00:44:40,079
Speaker 1: This game gives me that feel all over again.

820
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,960
Speaker 0: So the other thing is that, you know, you start out on these screens where everything's grass themed.

821
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:44,620
Speaker 0: Right.

822
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:50,058
Speaker 0: And it's like I started walking around in like these rock themed areas on my game and I was dying like crazy.

823
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,220
Speaker 1: That's a dangerous place.

824
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:54,260
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, it's like you can just go wherever the hell you want in this.

825
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,240
Speaker 0: There's no limitation.

826
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,860
Speaker 0: I suggest if you are not the best at this stick to the try.

827
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,820
Speaker 1: You can stick to the grass and take care of some dungeons.

828
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,899
Speaker 0: The map can shows you what's up.

829
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:07,640
Speaker 0: You can easily not go to screens that aren't grass.

830
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,539
Speaker 0: Go to all the grass screens you can.

831
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:15,160
Speaker 0: And then maybe once you're getting good at the game and you're done with the grass screens, go to the desert screen.

832
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,260
Speaker 1: And just like Zelda three, if you're stuck, go to the fortune teller and they'll basically tell you where the next puzzle is.

833
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Speaker 0: I went to the fortune teller and the fortune teller said, hey, go to the windmill.

834
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:24,999
Speaker 0: And that was great.

835
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:26,600
Speaker 0: Then I went back to the fortune teller.

836
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,240
Speaker 0: They said, hey, go to like Mount Doom.

837
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,379
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what the fuck?

838
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:32,080
Speaker 1: I went to Mount Doom and I got into that dungeon.

839
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,739
Speaker 0: That was good times.

840
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,380
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, Death Mountain, Death Mountain, not Mount Doom.

841
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,640
Speaker 0: They throw the ring into Ganon's mouth.

842
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:39,109
Speaker 1: Yup.

843
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:50,040
Speaker 1: But the thing that really stands out about this game to me is that it feels very much like a NecroDancer game and like a Zelda game.

844
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,426
Speaker 1: Like, and they do this both by the gameplay itself, but also just the theming is spot on.

845
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,580
Speaker 1: The music is fantastic.

846
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:07,940
Speaker 0: It's somehow they've managed to combine the aesthetic of Link to the Past and also the soon to be remade, Link's Awakening.

847
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:08,460
Speaker 1: Yup.

848
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,180
Speaker 0: Coupled with the music, which is all right, which were made one after the other anyway.

849
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:20,340
Speaker 1: But the music is like remixes of classic Zelda music with the great music from the NecroDancer game.

850
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,759
Speaker 0: And they merge really well, like, you know, the same as like the shopkeeper from NecroDancer who sings.

851
00:46:27,921 --> 00:46:35,111
Speaker 0: But also you go to like the Gerudo or the Bomchu bowling, but then there's Octorocks and there's all kinds of like, you know, like.

852
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:37,738
Speaker 0: they're such a perfect merger of the two in every way.

853
00:46:37,901 --> 00:46:40,080
Speaker 1: I would never have expected them to merge so well.

854
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:44,517
Speaker 1: The soundtrack is worth having and listening to by itself, even if you never played this game.

855
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,440
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, NecroDancer soundtrack as well.

856
00:46:46,581 --> 00:46:47,220
Speaker 0: It's a rhythm game.

857
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,059
Speaker 0: Music is core.

858
00:46:48,741 --> 00:46:48,891
Speaker 0: Right.

859
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:50,780
Speaker 1: Don't make a rhythm game with bad music.

860
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,860
Speaker 0: So if you have a Nintendo Switch, I rate this as must have.

861
00:46:55,503 --> 00:46:55,840
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

862
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,280
Speaker 1: This is a Switch game.

863
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,073
Speaker 1: Buy it, play it.

864
00:46:58,862 --> 00:47:00,400
Speaker 0: Is it a reason to buy an Nintendo Switch?

865
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:01,318
Speaker 0: No.

866
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:06,279
Speaker 0: But if you have a Nintendo Switch, perhaps because you bought Breath of the Wild, you should also be having this.

867
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:06,691
Speaker 0: Yup.

868
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:21,660
Speaker 1: Now, if you have played NecroDancer, it'll be way easier because at least in the early part of the game, you will see a lot of monsters and they will map to a monster that exists in NecroDancer that you already know how to deal with.

869
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:27,560
Speaker 0: I think if you have played NecroDancer and enjoyed it, you got to get this because it's more and more NecroDancer.

870
00:47:28,501 --> 00:47:38,480
Speaker 0: But if this is your first exposure and you're all into this, I don't necessarily think you have to go back to play NecroDancer unless you're super into it.

871
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:42,120
Speaker 0: If you're super into it, you can know, ah, there's more for me out there.

872
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:42,640
Speaker 0: You know what it's like?

873
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,240
Speaker 0: But if this is your first show, just stay with this.

874
00:47:45,521 --> 00:47:47,100
Speaker 0: You don't have to go back and play the original.

875
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:47,680
Speaker 0: Not necessary.

876
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,820
Speaker 1: Like if you've never played an Advance Wars, just get Wargroove on the Switch.

877
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need to go back and play old Advance Wars on the GBA.

878
00:47:54,380 --> 00:48:01,059
Speaker 1: Unless you play Wargroove and then you turn into someone like me and then you just go deeper and deeper and deeper.

879
00:48:01,506 --> 00:48:01,939
Speaker 1: Same deal.

880
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:07,720
Speaker 0: This has so much replay value, especially with the procedurally generated map.

881
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,858
Speaker 0: You can just start over and you can also, we cannot mention, we can't fail to mention the most important thing.

882
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:20,480
Speaker 0: This has, we played it before the show, a very excellent co-op mode.

883
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,300
Speaker 1: It's real fun.

884
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,280
Speaker 0: Now, when you first start playing, I brought my Switch because I thought we were going to need two Switches.

885
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,350
Speaker 0: No, to play the co-op mode, it's 2P1S.

886
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:30,580
Speaker 0: Two players, one Switch.

887
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,940
Speaker 0: You're going to want to do that on a television, not huddle around a tiny Switch.

888
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,290
Speaker 1: Now, when you first start playing, the flaws are.

889
00:48:37,752 --> 00:48:41,360
Speaker 1: it's very easy to walk off the screen and disorient the other person.

890
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,940
Speaker 0: Either player walks onto a new screen, goes into a room, falls down, goes down the stairs.

891
00:48:47,241 --> 00:48:50,280
Speaker 0: The other player is immediately dragged into that other screen.

892
00:48:50,447 --> 00:48:50,679
Speaker 0: Yep.

893
00:48:51,008 --> 00:48:51,160
Speaker 0: Right.

894
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,039
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who did it.

895
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,660
Speaker 0: So that can be good because it's like, well, I'm hanging on the left side of the screen.

896
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:56,360
Speaker 0: We want to go right.

897
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,940
Speaker 0: You go right.

898
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,220
Speaker 0: Great.

899
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,580
Speaker 0: We're now both, we both move.

900
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,860
Speaker 0: That's convenient, but it can also be disorienting and annoying.

901
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:07,160
Speaker 0: If you are not the player who moved off the screen, removed off the screen off by accident once that was annoying.

902
00:49:07,266 --> 00:49:07,478
Speaker 0: Yep.

903
00:49:07,703 --> 00:49:07,917
Speaker 0: Right.

904
00:49:09,742 --> 00:49:11,860
Speaker 0: But that's the really pretty much the only problem.

905
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,079
Speaker 1: It'll take you about 10 minutes to get used to it.

906
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:15,859
Speaker 1: And then it's way fun.

907
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,719
Speaker 1: It's way good.

908
00:49:17,061 --> 00:49:20,280
Speaker 0: Like I think it doesn't, I don't think it makes the game any more difficult.

909
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,720
Speaker 0: They don't add more enemies or anything.

910
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:24,080
Speaker 0: It's literally just you have an extra person.

911
00:49:24,382 --> 00:49:26,600
Speaker 0: You can clear the screen twice as fast.

912
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:26,870
Speaker 1: Yep.

913
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:27,878
Speaker 0: Everything's great.

914
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,680
Speaker 1: You can be clever, like get on opposite sides of a monster that has a lot of health and hit him at the same time.

915
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,800
Speaker 0: Some things are shared.

916
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,820
Speaker 0: I think like the diamonds, but something, most things aren't shared.

917
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:37,560
Speaker 0: I get a weapon.

918
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,498
Speaker 0: Rim doesn't have the weapon.

919
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:38,935
Speaker 1: Yep.

920
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,560
Speaker 1: But, but the intrinsic weapons, like if I get down stab, you also have down stab.

921
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,720
Speaker 0: So it's exactly, I got the power glove.

922
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:45,939
Speaker 0: We all had the power glove now.

923
00:49:46,492 --> 00:49:46,640
Speaker 0: Right.

924
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:47,640
Speaker 0: But I had a torch rim.

925
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,900
Speaker 0: Didn't have one rim had a shovel.

926
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:49,756
Speaker 0: I didn't have a shovel.

927
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:54,059
Speaker 0: Also, what else is great about the co-op?

928
00:49:54,485 --> 00:49:55,019
Speaker 0: It's just great.

929
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,339
Speaker 1: Like it's like this game.

930
00:49:56,685 --> 00:49:57,600
Speaker 1: I cannot stress enough.

931
00:49:58,703 --> 00:50:00,820
Speaker 1: It's a must have of the swish library.

932
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,799
Speaker 1: And if you've never played Neckerdancer, it is unique.

933
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,620
Speaker 1: You have never played a game like this before.

934
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,739
Speaker 0: This is literally the only game in the world like this.

935
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,111
Speaker 1: Yeah.

936
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,119
Speaker 1: So buy it.

937
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:12,517
Speaker 1: Go play it right now.

938
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,056
Speaker 0: That's right.

939
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,680
