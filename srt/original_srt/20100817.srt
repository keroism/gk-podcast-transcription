1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,588
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 17th.

2
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:12,391
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,060
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,040
Speaker 1: expansion packs.

5
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,732
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, so I got.

6
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:27,674
Speaker 0: you know what I got.

7
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:28,356
Speaker 1: What'd you get?

8
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,080
Speaker 0: I got the the adventure burner.

9
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,229
Speaker 1: ah You can realize I stupidly have not actually ordered it.

10
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:38,670
Speaker 0: Well, you should order too because this book is basically saving saving the world here.

11
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:48,110
Speaker 1: It's basically from what I can gather just from comments people have made the almighty Bible of role-playing Well, I don't know about that well of burning wheel style role-playing.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,712
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

13
00:00:48,832 --> 00:01:00,807
Speaker 0: I think it's actually what Luke said is that is incredibly burning wheel specific like like you know The thing is is like we were obviously not doing everything optimally, I don't think we ever have you know.

14
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:08,697
Speaker 0: and It's weird because like I knew on paper like what we were doing wrong and what we were supposed to do But I didn't I couldn't do it.

15
00:01:08,998 --> 00:01:09,841
Speaker 1: isn't that the worst thing?

16
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,886
Speaker 1: when you like jam a game and like you know what you did Well, and you know what parts of the game didn't go, but you still can't.

17
00:01:15,027 --> 00:01:16,769
Speaker 0: it's like you know But you still can't do it.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,050
Speaker 1: You know you know cuz you know like this is the part where all right rim is looking at his cell phone.

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,922
Speaker 0: No, it's like all rooms got his laptop out rims pooping.

20
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,270
Speaker 0: It's like if you're playing Starcraft.

21
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:33,556
Speaker 0: It's like I might know what I need to do better, but I know if I if I fail to do it at least I know why I failed.

22
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:34,661
Speaker 0: I'm just not fast enough.

23
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:36,390
Speaker 0: I don't have the physical dexterity right.

24
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,316
Speaker 0: I know the reason I couldn't do something that I knew to do But the burning will not so much.

25
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:46,470
Speaker 1: it's like some of the things are easy like don't argue with players about the obstacle.

26
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:50,601
Speaker 0: Yeah, I read there's a nice chapter on obstacles that saving the world.

27
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:54,475
Speaker 1: also my conventional wisdom was always its ops 3.

28
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:55,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's exactly what this is.

29
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:02,630
Speaker 0: But actually that most helpful chapter my favorite is the short chapter about wises, right?

30
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,037
Speaker 0: But I want to.

31
00:02:04,077 --> 00:02:06,650
Speaker 0: I want to read at least part of the chapter on wises.

32
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:12,158
Speaker 0: I know Luke Luke gets mad when people put his stuff on the internet But I can read some bits of the chapter.

33
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:17,374
Speaker 1: I point out that fair use is quite liberal in regard to excerpts Especially for journalists.

34
00:02:17,575 --> 00:02:18,217
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get.

35
00:02:18,237 --> 00:02:26,219
Speaker 0: I'm not giving you like a couple paragraphs otherwise would be here all night, right, but basically It says here, okay, I'm gonna.

36
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:34,670
Speaker 0: I'm gonna paraphrase some of the parts here, okay Long ago a black dragon descended upon a great dwarven Hall slew the defenders and took it as his own.

37
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,453
Speaker 0: What our fortress.

38
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:38,966
Speaker 0: one of the players took the role of the last scion of that dwarven house.

39
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,775
Speaker 0: his long-term goal was to slay The dragon and reclaim his homeland.

40
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:44,283
Speaker 0: the rest of the players created characters that wanted to help him.

41
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:46,550
Speaker 0: right the blah blah blah blah blah.

42
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:52,347
Speaker 0: And basically someone asked the GM do I know any stories about the origin of dragons?

43
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:53,170
Speaker 0: question mark?

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 0: So is this a situation for wises?

45
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,830
Speaker 0: right and basically?

46
00:02:59,192 --> 00:03:03,533
Speaker 0: You know it goes on and talks about well, okay look You know I.

47
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,362
Speaker 1: suddenly I think I wonder if this is going where.

48
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:10,581
Speaker 1: I think it should be going in that situation As it as a player.

49
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:11,950
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say do I know any stories?

50
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,590
Speaker 1: I would say I know a story and the role would be whether or not that story is legit.

51
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:18,934
Speaker 1: I'd do something like that.

52
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:21,383
Speaker 1: I would never ask do I?

53
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:25,383
Speaker 1: I would ask I would say I X and then roll the dice.

54
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:28,317
Speaker 0: well it says here Do I know any stories about the origin of dragons?

55
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:35,829
Speaker 0: before answering my question the first thing Anthony the GM had to think about was Whether he knew the answer or not when he was preparing the campaign.

56
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:36,030
Speaker 0: did he?

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,879
Speaker 0: Determine where dragons came from or does he have no way?

58
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:41,789
Speaker 0: he doesn't know and we're gonna find out where dragons came from.

59
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:42,715
Speaker 0: Right.

60
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,960
Speaker 0: so you could say yes Or force the guy to roll a dragon wise test.

61
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,290
Speaker 0: and it goes on to talk about when you should say yes.

62
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:50,755
Speaker 1: I imagine this.

63
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,323
Speaker 1: do I know any stories about the origins of dragons?

64
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:56,661
Speaker 0: game master says yep well if he says yes He has to give you the information.

65
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,629
Speaker 1: doesn't you say yes?

66
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,239
Speaker 0: No, it says yes, you do you know you?

67
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,806
Speaker 0: maybe you should read the adventure burner cuz.

68
00:04:01,846 --> 00:04:02,730
Speaker 0: clearly you're wrong.

69
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:10,622
Speaker 0: It says here He has to decide whether to simply say yes And give the information or call for a dragon wise test.

70
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:12,908
Speaker 0: right and it says when and when.

71
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,319
Speaker 0: you shouldn't You know give a dragon wise test.

72
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:15,600
Speaker 0: They don't.

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,450
Speaker 0: maybe the person will get false information.

74
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,269
Speaker 0: Maybe they get the right information.

75
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,572
Speaker 0: You know You know.

76
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:25,563
Speaker 0: make sure that the information doesn't contradict any previous information.

77
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:28,410
Speaker 0: like someone might say sure dragons come from the Isle of Dread.

78
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:34,870
Speaker 0: Well actually you've already been to the Isle of Dread and there weren't any evidence of dragons there, so we can't go with that right.

79
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:38,594
Speaker 0: but then You know.

80
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:46,230
Speaker 0: later on it says remember when you guys are searching for the lost city of Panax And you fought your way to the Chronicle of Ages and the Hall of the All Fathers to do some research.

81
00:04:46,692 --> 00:04:50,250
Speaker 0: You recall there was a section dedicated to dragons that you didn't have time to investigate.

82
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:57,410
Speaker 0: I would have to wait for another opportunity to test dragon wise and it would be a bit more time before we learn the awful truth.

83
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:06,113
Speaker 0: Dragons are born when a dwarf advances his greed to exponent 10.

84
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:07,218
Speaker 0: You know the the.

85
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:10,070
Speaker 0: it is full of much awesomeness of that variety.

86
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:11,874
Speaker 0: So there you go.

87
00:05:11,914 --> 00:05:22,856
Speaker 0: adventure burner even if you're not playing well even if you're not playing burning wheel You'll probably get something out of it, but if you are playing burning wheel and you are you know player or GM It is pretty much.

88
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,584
Speaker 0: I don't know how you could really play.

89
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:29,866
Speaker 0: You know play properly without it You know unless you you know have much much practice in grokking.

90
00:05:30,348 --> 00:05:32,858
Speaker 1: so Scott How come you didn't make any shows this?

91
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:33,803
Speaker 1: where live past week?

92
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,170
Speaker 0: How come you didn't make any shows?

93
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,415
Speaker 0: I was you're the shit talker.

94
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:37,922
Speaker 1: I was on vacation, but you were.

95
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:38,505
Speaker 1: you were here.

96
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:39,530
Speaker 1: There's nothing stopping you.

97
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:46,778
Speaker 0: I was busy not shit talking whereas you were laying on the beach Laying on the beach or to-do list.

98
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,490
Speaker 1: I was also drinking heavily and playing games.

99
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:54,123
Speaker 0: Yes Not doing any of the things that you have should have had done years ago.

100
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:55,949
Speaker 1: well except for the packs late show stuff.

101
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,374
Speaker 1: now that We can actually talk about that.

102
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,020
Speaker 0: Yes, but you're still.

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,542
Speaker 0: you have.

104
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:03,797
Speaker 0: you have a mighty list of shit talking whereas I where is my shit talking list?

105
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,222
Speaker 0: Can you name a single thing?

106
00:06:05,262 --> 00:06:06,025
Speaker 0: I am shit talking.

107
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:09,059
Speaker 1: you never Made that e-commerce site.

108
00:06:09,321 --> 00:06:09,984
Speaker 0: that was you was it?

109
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:14,789
Speaker 0: yes In fact I did more than I should have on the e-commerce site.

110
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:19,708
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter I'm working on that, but uh-huh I know you're not.

111
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:19,930
Speaker 0: yeah.

112
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,117
Speaker 1: Well, I'm working on a solution to that.

113
00:06:22,137 --> 00:06:25,548
Speaker 1: that does not involve me making an e-commerce site great.

114
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,708
Speaker 0: Good job You're not doing shit.

115
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:35,930
Speaker 1: But now 90% of what I was working on for this whole period where we were saying yeah We can't talk about it was the packs late show and for the meta moment.

116
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:40,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's in the schedule now, so I can at least mention it, but no over the whole week It's funny.

117
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:50,386
Speaker 1: every year at the shore Scott will be like hey, let's play a game and everyone's like Then we go to the beach or we lay there watch like some terrible old anime.

118
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:51,610
Speaker 1: We still did that this year.

119
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,451
Speaker 1: We watched Babylon 5.

120
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:55,254
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty good.

121
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm actually really enjoying it.

122
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,225
Speaker 1: I want to know what happens to the membari.

123
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:03,576
Speaker 0: I've actually watched That some episodes back in the day.

124
00:07:03,596 --> 00:07:04,378
Speaker 0: because what episodes?

125
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:05,160
Speaker 1: because two things.

126
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:14,408
Speaker 1: one Babylon 5 not only has bad CGI CGI Compared to shows of today it has bad CGI compared to shows of back then.

127
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,315
Speaker 0: well I don't know which episodes.

128
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:21,029
Speaker 0: they were random episodes that were airing it like the middle of the day on Sunday when I was in high school.

129
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,503
Speaker 0: Bored you know just home doing nothing and it was terrible.

130
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:26,346
Speaker 1: I don't know.

131
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:26,968
Speaker 1: It was a good show.

00:07:27,008 --> 00:07:28,113
Speaker 1: what episodes Do you remember?

133
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:29,921
Speaker 0: how am I supposed to remember in high school?

134
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,870
Speaker 1: really you don't remember anything from high school?

135
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,450
Speaker 0: I don't remember what TV show I watched on a random Sunday.

136
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:44,257
Speaker 1: I wish I had watched more of it when I was in high school but no I'd stay up late and watch TNG and then deep space 9 would come on and be like Yeah, I kind of fall asleep during it.

137
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,354
Speaker 1: Babylon 5 was way later on a different channel, so Yeah, all the show sec.

138
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:51,080
Speaker 1: No those shows are all awesome.

139
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,822
Speaker 1: No terrible.

140
00:07:52,103 --> 00:07:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing to do with Tuesday.

141
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,870
Speaker 1: Regardless all that aside at the shore for some reason now that Scott wasn't around it was like the gaming time.

142
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,394
Speaker 1: We played like every board game.

143
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:04,658
Speaker 1: We had multiple times.

144
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,068
Speaker 1: We even whipped out a weird indie RPG that Scott's never even heard of.

145
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:11,238
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, yeah, they're like aha Scott's not here.

146
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,784
Speaker 0: Let's play some games the whole time.

147
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:13,567
Speaker 1: We're like man.

148
00:08:13,948 --> 00:08:14,831
Speaker 1: only Scott We're here.

149
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,317
Speaker 1: He loved this jerks.

150
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,525
Speaker 1: You could have just come yeah.

00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:19,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to pay me.

152
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,416
Speaker 1: Just take vacation time.

153
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:22,761
Speaker 0: give me some vacation time.

154
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,930
Speaker 0: you spend it all on what hung in this man.

155
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,675
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

156
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:26,480
Speaker 1: He's spending it on.

157
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,196
Speaker 0: I'm spending on good stuff plus I don't have that much to spend.

158
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:40,989
Speaker 1: but regardless what I do want to talk about you know We played a bunch of games the Battlestar Galactica game, which is basically Shadows over Camelot plus mafia, and that's it Universe, it's okay.

159
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:44,882
Speaker 1: The real trouble with it is that it's shadows over camelot.

160
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:51,710
Speaker 1: now the fun part of the game is Figuring out who the Cylon is but smart players can make that decision.

161
00:08:51,951 --> 00:08:54,363
Speaker 1: Completely pointless really.

162
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:54,966
Speaker 0: yeah.

163
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:59,283
Speaker 1: smart players Just play randomly, and it doesn't matter if you're the Cylon.

164
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,970
Speaker 1: just dick everyone all the time.

165
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:02,535
Speaker 1: They cannot figure it out.

166
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,110
Speaker 1: the game is set up to where they cannot actually figure it out without using their powers.

167
00:09:07,451 --> 00:09:14,135
Speaker 0: Really because like in shadows over camelot right you can you know you can help with the quest or you can sort of not Help with the quest.

168
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:20,162
Speaker 0: so you're saying that in Battlestar Galactica game It's like people will be forced to not help even when they want to know.

169
00:09:20,222 --> 00:09:21,587
Speaker 1: it's more like you.

170
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:31,203
Speaker 1: you can dick Secretly so people don't know you dicked and you can kind of statistically figure it out But they introduce enough randomness into the stuff you're doing.

171
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:34,909
Speaker 0: so you can basically dick people secretly So no one can tell who's doing good.

172
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,305
Speaker 0: Then your dicking is concealed by luck.

173
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:40,370
Speaker 1: basically yes.

174
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,838
Speaker 0: So there's no way to tell who's the side.

175
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:48,748
Speaker 1: the real trouble in the end is just that if it suffers the same problem fundamentally the shadows over Camelot suffers.

176
00:09:48,768 --> 00:09:50,796
Speaker 1: it Relies on two things.

177
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:54,110
Speaker 1: one it relies on the fact that you have a hand of cards that are secret.

178
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,890
Speaker 1: So you can play cards and those affect the outcome.

179
00:09:58,412 --> 00:10:04,550
Speaker 1: But at the same time the game does not let you actually say what the numbers are on the cards in your hand.

180
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,316
Speaker 0: Oh, they have stupid rules about what you can.

181
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:11,764
Speaker 1: I can't say I can help a little I can help a lot But you can't say things like I got 18.

182
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:12,127
Speaker 1: Let's roll.

183
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,537
Speaker 1: So I don't know that it's.

184
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,263
Speaker 0: that's a fundamental brokenness.

185
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:23,037
Speaker 0: if you I mean you can have really Specific rules about what can and cannot be said.

186
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,965
Speaker 0: for example you can say this game must be played silently.

187
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:26,546
Speaker 0: That's okay.

188
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:32,190
Speaker 0: You can say Players may only say numbers they may not say any words.

189
00:10:32,351 --> 00:10:39,910
Speaker 0: That's okay, but to have such these you know flimsy kind of rules like that It's like sorry guys better than shadows over Camelot.

190
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:43,496
Speaker 1: They were more precise But there was still a fatal flaw in that it.

191
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:52,290
Speaker 1: it did not preclude me from making a code ahead of time and using said Like a lot means I have five blue.

192
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, I will say a lot.

193
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:58,340
Speaker 0: the number of times I say the word a lot is the number that I have on my card.

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,049
Speaker 0: yeah a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot.

195
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:05,870
Speaker 1: So that was kind of disappointing, but we played cosmic encounters.

196
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:11,066
Speaker 1: It's really fun, but it's basically a vote who wins game because you can have mutual victory.

197
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:13,659
Speaker 1: so the one game I played I was getting the shit.

198
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:15,892
Speaker 0: we play a lot of games with the mutual victory though But they're not.

199
00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:16,636
Speaker 0: vote who wins.

200
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,310
Speaker 0: you know Illuminati has mutual victories and vote who wins yeah?

201
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:19,937
Speaker 1: Well, that's cuz the game.

202
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:22,736
Speaker 0: Dixie has it And that's not vote who wins this game.

203
00:11:22,756 --> 00:11:25,084
Speaker 1: basically you go around and you keep kind of hell.

204
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:31,643
Speaker 1: you you invite people to help you And then the attacker invites and the defender invites, and you can invite specific people.

205
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:32,185
Speaker 1: I can be like.

206
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:39,548
Speaker 1: I invite Nury and Pete's to help me attack and then you know Wyatt who's being attacked and be like.

207
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:44,510
Speaker 1: well I invite Nury and Scott Johnson, and you know what everybody can to help me defend.

208
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:51,956
Speaker 1: And I was getting a shit kicked out of me But I had like just enough stuff and Bruce was pretty much winning.

209
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:57,961
Speaker 1: and then everyone else starts coming up and like anyone could have won like it was getting real close And on my turn I was in the right position.

210
00:11:57,981 --> 00:11:58,403
Speaker 1: I go to Bruce.

211
00:11:58,463 --> 00:11:59,830
Speaker 1: I'm like mutual victory.

212
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,993
Speaker 1: He's like mutual victory.

213
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:01,836
Speaker 1: we shook hands.

214
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:02,217
Speaker 1: We did it.

215
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:02,578
Speaker 1: we won.

216
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,320
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

217
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:06,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a hundred percent win rate in that game.

218
00:12:06,631 --> 00:12:07,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, you played it once.

219
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:11,815
Speaker 0: yeah, maybe Any other good games.

220
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:16,758
Speaker 1: I always play some cosmic encounters, which is yeah Some race for the galaxy.

221
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaker 1: we played that at anime Boston yep, and having played it two more times everyone was right.

222
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,419
Speaker 1: without the expansions the game is Definitely eminently solvable.

223
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,610
Speaker 0: you need more cards in there to mix it up.

224
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:34,010
Speaker 0: Otherwise you're just gonna figure out all the cards know exactly which ones to use when and the whole thing is done.

225
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:40,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, turns were pretty deterministic, and it comes down to the fiddliness, but the expansions?

226
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:44,330
Speaker 1: I don't know if they make the game great, or if they just delay the figuring out further.

227
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:48,408
Speaker 1: It's no Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico is a far better game.

228
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:52,824
Speaker 1: however I enjoy race for the galaxy, but most importantly the game we played.

229
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:58,670
Speaker 1: I doubt many of you have heard of it 1001 nights a game of enticing stories.

230
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,114
Speaker 0: This is one of those lysing.

231
00:13:00,174 --> 00:13:03,383
Speaker 1: is it indie indie indie role-playing?

232
00:13:03,444 --> 00:13:04,567
Speaker 0: how indie could it be?

233
00:13:04,587 --> 00:13:05,349
Speaker 1: have you ever heard of it?

234
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,318
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't heard most indie game.

235
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:12,497
Speaker 1: It's put out by night sky games Meg away Baker and The game.

236
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:13,384
Speaker 1: so it's.

237
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:18,485
Speaker 1: it's basically Inception the role-playing game, but not in the literal sense, but in the figurative sense.

238
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:19,750
Speaker 1: it is the yo dawg.

239
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:27,721
Speaker 1: I heard you like role-playing so put some role-playing in your role-playing so you can role play while you're role-playing The game you play and this might sounds like it'd be really confusing.

240
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:34,504
Speaker 1: you play a bunch of courtiers courtiers in The Sultan's court in some Saudi Arabian setting.

241
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:40,990
Speaker 1: you know Arabian night style All right And you all make your characters and name them and as cool mechanics for making characters.

242
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:58,099
Speaker 1: And then you roleplay a scene with all these courtiers hanging out and doing their thing and at some point someone in the group will suggest a story a Sign rolls to all the other characters and now you roleplay those characters Role-playing that story.

243
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,248
Speaker 0: how many times do you how many stories do you do?

244
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:10,163
Speaker 1: You keep going around until some metacondition occurs until someone gets beheaded like say in the course of your story Their character gets beheaded or their characters character gets beheaded.

245
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:13,095
Speaker 1: the real character the meta character the media How does the hat is that have?

246
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:14,963
Speaker 1: so I don't want to get it all.

247
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:22,830
Speaker 0: if you're just sitting or if you if you have these Characters who were just sitting around telling stories Role-playing how does anything happen outside of that?

248
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,413
Speaker 0: Story in a story.

249
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:25,779
Speaker 0: It's a Sultan's courts.

250
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:27,466
Speaker 0: So when did things happen?

251
00:14:27,486 --> 00:14:27,928
Speaker 0: in the Sultan's?

252
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:34,270
Speaker 1: all the time Like I said, I don't want to get into the mechanics But say like say you finish your story everything gets resolved, right?

253
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,439
Speaker 0: The story hates it.

254
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,492
Speaker 1: No, the story gets resolved It's all done.

255
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:41,346
Speaker 1: Then you go through all these mechanics to figure out.

256
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:46,339
Speaker 1: was the Sultan insulted by something you did in the course of the roleplay?

257
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:49,395
Speaker 1: or Did you get closer to your ambition?

258
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:54,950
Speaker 1: and then you roleplay the aftermath of the story as the meta characters until another story happens?

259
00:14:55,515 --> 00:15:03,670
Speaker 1: And you kind of take turns Describing and then playing out the scenes outside of the role-playing and then playing out the role-playing itself.

260
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:07,206
Speaker 0: So it's basically that that Monty Python skit.

261
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:16,848
Speaker 0: Oh, that one was his Like a golden your Your majesty is like.

262
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,689
Speaker 1: So, here's the weird thing.

263
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,580
Speaker 1: Look, what is one of the biggest problems our group has?

264
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,322
Speaker 1: role-playing?

265
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:29,290
Speaker 1: people don't remember each other's in character names.

266
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:36,670
Speaker 1: Very few people can maintain first-person dialogue as their character in character.

267
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:39,350
Speaker 1: I think the biggest problem more than a paragraph or so.

268
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:46,170
Speaker 0: But I think the fundamental problem there is simply that people can't sit and pay attention And focus and not get up and do anything else.

269
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:55,821
Speaker 0: They are they are constantly getting up and doing other things and not sitting down an only role-playing and not doing not looking at their Phones not going to get food not go.

270
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:56,745
Speaker 1: That's simple anytime.

271
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:57,187
Speaker 1: They're doing that.

272
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:57,568
Speaker 1: they're bored.

273
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:01,697
Speaker 1: If they're doing that the games already failed I'm just saying but this game.

274
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,650
Speaker 1: but even that aside part of the reason they're not engaged Look, no one remembers each other's characters names.

275
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:12,267
Speaker 1: Can you name any of the characters from the Oasis game other than Goma the Oasis game?

276
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,299
Speaker 1: Yeah What was my character's name?

277
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:16,827
Speaker 0: I don't remember really.

278
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:17,550
Speaker 0: I got to think for him.

279
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,799
Speaker 1: Can you name any character from?

280
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,550
Speaker 0: I could if you let me think for like a little bit or take a while.

281
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,602
Speaker 1: Can you name any characters from the the ferret game?

282
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:28,434
Speaker 0: We were playing the ferret All that.

283
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:29,298
Speaker 1: any of them?

284
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:32,050
Speaker 0: any ferret game any ferret game?

285
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,310
Speaker 1: Can you name any character from any role-playing game that we have played as a group in the last decade?

286
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,043
Speaker 0: That wasn't my character.

287
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,312
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, I know.

288
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,060
Speaker 0: I know the characters names and like door in the dwarf fortress game.

289
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,482
Speaker 0: Really?

290
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:46,805
Speaker 0: Yeah name.

291
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,310
Speaker 1: What's my character's name?

292
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,973
Speaker 0: I forget but I know that she Illustrated.

293
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,785
Speaker 0: she's character is kygar and I think so.

294
00:16:55,825 --> 00:16:58,140
Speaker 0: my point illustrated Someone else's.

295
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,409
Speaker 0: someone else is like earn.

296
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:04,823
Speaker 1: People don't know their characters names in person and they don't roleplay in person.

297
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:17,113
Speaker 1: people very have a lot of difficulty kind of actually having a conversation that makes sense in the course of the game as their character without defaulting to proper noun Anything.

298
00:17:17,734 --> 00:17:18,479
Speaker 1: that guy's name.

299
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,507
Speaker 1: my character tries to convince the guy to do this.

300
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:24,742
Speaker 1: roll the dice A thousand and one nights forces the opposite.

301
00:17:24,884 --> 00:17:26,230
Speaker 0: I thought it was called something else.

302
00:17:26,391 --> 00:17:29,731
Speaker 1: It's called a thousand and one nights a game of enticing stories Uh-huh.

303
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:40,751
Speaker 1: So not only did everyone remember every other character's name and speak to them Continuously in character for pretty much the entirety of the game and I have a recording of this to prove it Mm-hmm.

304
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:47,759
Speaker 1: No one even had trouble remembering the fucking secondary characters every time around and they go What what was it about the game that did that?

305
00:17:48,161 --> 00:17:49,950
Speaker 1: So one the game is heavy on atmosphere.

306
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,677
Speaker 1: The book tells you you'd better be lounging.

307
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:57,790
Speaker 1: You'd better have like wine and grapes and things really get into character.

308
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:02,830
Speaker 1: Change the setting have physical tokens put a bowl in the middle for the token?

309
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,600
Speaker 0: Well dread says the same thing if you read.

310
00:18:04,681 --> 00:18:09,048
Speaker 0: if you actually follow the instructions of dread You're supposed to make the room all dark and spooky.

311
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,842
Speaker 1: Yes I cannot express to you how well that works.

312
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:17,348
Speaker 1: the physical space of gaming Matters far more than we'd even suspected when we mandated that you must have a table.

313
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:30,158
Speaker 1: Yeah I know I knew that I knew it mattered when we mandated the table but mandating the lounging and we kind of we all Lounged and played and it worked beautifully because it was it fit the setting Also the way you make your character.

314
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:31,884
Speaker 1: you describe your character.

315
00:18:31,924 --> 00:18:35,014
Speaker 1: you make six sentences Describing your character.

316
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:41,211
Speaker 1: each one must reference one of these senses and then the last one is what they look like Uh-huh.

317
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,307
Speaker 1: So site my character, you know, nothing escapes my character's gaze.

318
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:54,670
Speaker 1: or my character is blind or my character is ugly just anything involving sight and scent and taste and touch and hearing.

319
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:05,995
Speaker 1: and Then you have to go around and after everyone knows everyone's characters Everyone has one ambition and then everyone has one thing about every other character that they envy Mm-hmm.

320
00:19:06,196 --> 00:19:06,960
Speaker 1: Not so you have to.

321
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,930
Speaker 0: so if you have five players you have five envy.

322
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,425
Speaker 1: Yes, not hate but envy which means that before envy.

323
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,300
Speaker 1: so you'll be sniping You'll be insulting each other.

324
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,890
Speaker 1: a game like that in a Sultan's court.

325
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,788
Speaker 1: You think courtiers aren't gonna be insulting each other?

326
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,047
Speaker 1: But because you can't really insult each other directly.

327
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:22,470
Speaker 1: It's a court.

328
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,156
Speaker 1: You can't be like.

329
00:19:23,518 --> 00:19:24,930
Speaker 1: you're a big and fat and stupid.

330
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:32,688
Speaker 1: But what if in the course of telling a story you ask the big fat stupid guy to roleplay the big fat stupid guy.

331
00:19:32,708 --> 00:19:39,130
Speaker 1: Oh You get to ask Yes, the person starting the story says alright, we're going to play.

332
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:41,286
Speaker 1: You know this I'm going to tell the story of.

333
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:43,241
Speaker 1: you know It's I forget the Arabic name.

334
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:45,073
Speaker 0: you can be the but Smith But it's been.

335
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:46,056
Speaker 0: I will be the Sultan.

336
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:52,719
Speaker 1: the Don Juan story about the famous lover and let's see I need and this was Pete's character Mustafa bin Mustafa.

337
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,702
Speaker 0: That's a good name.

338
00:19:54,204 --> 00:19:59,680
Speaker 1: He was the fat powerful Eunuch of the court in charge of the harem.

339
00:20:00,182 --> 00:20:01,326
Speaker 1: his envy of my character.

340
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:05,721
Speaker 1: I was the pretty boy You had a clean position was that I can lay with a woman.

341
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:08,430
Speaker 1: my envy of him is that he is physically powerful

342
00:20:09,012 --> 00:20:09,213
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

343
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:25,849
Speaker 1: so he wants to tell the Don Juan story because the envious of me He cast himself as Don Juan, of course and as a slight he casts me my character as the eunuch To try to and his and he's trying obviously to like make me understand what it's like.

344
00:20:26,492 --> 00:20:29,080
Speaker 1: So of course because the you know, the role-playing is so important.

345
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:38,956
Speaker 1: I immediately stuffed pillows under my shirt Physically and then when I when I come on to the scene in the scenario Her did her.

346
00:20:39,297 --> 00:20:41,544
Speaker 0: I am the eunuch big and stupid.

347
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,169
Speaker 1: Look at how much I smell.

348
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,923
Speaker 1: One is so much smarter and cleverer than me.

349
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:47,767
Speaker 1: Of course.

350
00:20:47,807 --> 00:20:52,401
Speaker 1: He will get away and That is the way the game flows.

351
00:20:53,064 --> 00:20:54,110
Speaker 1: It is so awesome.

352
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:55,284
Speaker 1: Once we played we have to review.

353
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:55,608
Speaker 0: know why.

354
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:57,147
Speaker 0: well You know why the game is good for us?

355
00:20:57,551 --> 00:21:01,445
Speaker 0: Because the game where you insult the other people and we are experts at that.

356
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:02,590
Speaker 0: Oh my are we?

357
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:07,930
Speaker 0: That is our expertise is insulting each other viciously.

358
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:11,100
Speaker 0: So any game about insulting is our game.

359
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,229
Speaker 1: So, uh any games that you played?

360
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,841
Speaker 0: I played I went to board game night and I played some games.

361
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,170
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Borges Emily one.

362
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,286
Speaker 1: There's some manga things you wanted you to go to but you were like at board games.

363
00:21:20,306 --> 00:21:21,772
Speaker 0: Yeah Let's see.

364
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:24,320
Speaker 0: I played the Castlevania game on the Xbox.

365
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:24,942
Speaker 1: I bought it.

366
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:26,487
Speaker 1: I have not even played it once.

367
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,454
Speaker 0: It's alright It's not the problem.

368
00:21:28,475 --> 00:21:29,599
Speaker 0: The only problem I have with it.

369
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,789
Speaker 0: Is that like you're doing these individual levels?

370
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:33,432
Speaker 0: and It's got?

371
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:34,715
Speaker 0: I wish it was just more.

372
00:21:35,197 --> 00:21:37,724
Speaker 0: one gigantic cat, you know, how come?

373
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:38,546
Speaker 0: no one does it?

374
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:41,112
Speaker 0: I just make the game Gigantic.

375
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:45,555
Speaker 0: they hadn't think that they spent enough time making these like I guess six or seven I don't know how many.

376
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,289
Speaker 0: there are maps cuz I didn't finish the game.

377
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,822
Speaker 0: You could have just put them all together and made one gigantic one, dude.

378
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:52,283
Speaker 0: Come on.

379
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:59,730
Speaker 0: Just go crazy big make something That's like Symphony of the night size, you know, maybe even twice as big as that, you know go large.

380
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:05,890
Speaker 0: That's like the example of what if four swords let anyone go anyway, I mean if there's six players simultaneously, that means we can explore it.

381
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:09,940
Speaker 0: That means we can explore this shit in one sixth the time.

382
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,210
Speaker 0: So you got to make it 6x size of the Symphony of the night.

383
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,052
Speaker 0: That's what I'm looking for.

384
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,782
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, uh, well it I've been playing some FPS.

385
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:18,825
Speaker 0: is you know what FPS I'm playing?

386
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:23,898
Speaker 1: NS doom doom Doom one doom - all kinds of doom.

387
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:25,743
Speaker 1: final doom all doom final doom.

388
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:26,505
Speaker 1: wasn't that fun?

389
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:29,495
Speaker 1: to be honest playing all doom Play some doom deathmatch.

390
00:22:30,037 --> 00:22:33,049
Speaker 0: I got this new doom engine the doomsday engine and then I went.

391
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:38,968
Speaker 0: I went into my steam folder and I got the wad files and I wrote a blog post telling you how to make it happen.

392
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,840
Speaker 0: because Remember when he went to that that thing?

393
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,682
Speaker 0: and there was the CEO and the and the 30. yeah, the the bald guy the Kotaku guy.

394
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,746
Speaker 0: Apparently he never played.

395
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:50,850
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name?

396
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:51,774
Speaker 0: Totillo.

397
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:53,369
Speaker 0: he never played doom.

398
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:56,766
Speaker 0: And he wrote a blog post about his first attempt to play doom.

399
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:00,442
Speaker 0: like very, you know Which is very recently like, you know, what's after the y+30.

400
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,568
Speaker 1: so having not like interacted with this I don't know where this story goes.

401
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:09,397
Speaker 1: Doom, I think if you just sit down to play it is Emanently 100% accessible.

402
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:25,445
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is is that he had a great time playing it actually but he played it like the flash version and then he tried to play like an Xbox crappy because He couldn't get it to work on the computer Technologically speaking because the steam dos box thing just didn't work out of the box.

403
00:23:25,465 --> 00:23:33,770
Speaker 0: the steam dos box thing works Barely, so I had I wrote a blog post how to make the doomsday thing work, which is far superior and far more accessible.

404
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:37,842
Speaker 0: Let's see what else I play Forbidden Island.

405
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:38,606
Speaker 0: I played once.

406
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:42,037
Speaker 0: it's basically It's the same genre as pandemic, right?

407
00:23:42,077 --> 00:23:43,161
Speaker 0: It's a verse the game game.

408
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,910
Speaker 1: I think though that always a mixed bag.

409
00:23:46,111 --> 00:23:58,950
Speaker 0: I think the problem with this one is that we I'm not sure, you know we should have made it a harder difficulty because we just won and It was like a turn or two before we actually won but we were guaranteed to win already.

410
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:08,270
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh we've already won But the guy next to me was like I want to play it out and I'm like, dude It doesn't matter you can make any move as long as you don't as long as you're not stupid.

411
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,516
Speaker 0: There is no way we can lose.

412
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:11,547
Speaker 0: and he was like no we might lose.

413
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:15,963
Speaker 0: and I'm like look Tell me what combination of cards can show up and where we would lose.

414
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:16,605
Speaker 0: there isn't he's like.

415
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:19,918
Speaker 0: I can't tell you which specific one I'm like, have you not been paying attention?

416
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,695
Speaker 0: even if the worst possible cards are all in a row There's no way we can lose.

417
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:25,561
Speaker 0: we have two helicopter cards.

418
00:24:25,621 --> 00:24:26,263
Speaker 0: We can't lose.

419
00:24:26,344 --> 00:24:28,130
Speaker 1: go back to the Horatio hornblower books, right?

420
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,410
Speaker 1: There's one where he's playing and this is in the show - you saw this part where he's playing whist.

421
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,854
Speaker 1: And then the guy's like you're cheating and he's like no I'm just good.

422
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:44,697
Speaker 1: and then later like he's like well this hands over and the other three guys throw their cards in And the guys like no we should keep playing It's not over.

423
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:49,430
Speaker 1: and then the smart people are all like well No, because you couldn't have more than blah blah blah blah blah.

424
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,150
Speaker 1: I don't think a lot of people are at that level on most German board games.

425
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:56,900
Speaker 0: This isn't even a German game really but yeah, it's a beat the game game.

426
00:24:57,001 --> 00:25:03,730
Speaker 0: I wouldn't recommend it really, you know, it's sorta It's not you know, I mean if you're gonna play that game just play pandemic.

427
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:08,085
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's if you want to play those games as the best of them You know what I'm bringing to the next board.

428
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:11,823
Speaker 1: game night I got the Tigris and Euphrates expansion that none of us fucking knew about.

429
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,450
Speaker 1: All right, I can't believe it.

430
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:14,333
Speaker 0: How good is it?

431
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:15,418
Speaker 1: We haven't played it.

432
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:18,189
Speaker 1: I don't know but it did what we said it should do.

433
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:24,790
Speaker 1: They have the normal board and on the back an alternate board with a big open area and a river kind of around the edge.

434
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:26,294
Speaker 1: There's a spot.

435
00:25:26,555 --> 00:25:28,521
Speaker 1: there were two spots for the blue monument.

436
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:35,138
Speaker 1: Whoa, and one of those spots is six squares And there's also another expansion.

437
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:43,550
Speaker 1: you can you kind of mix and match I think the ziggurat If you make a three across and three across to kind of like a plus.

438
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:46,883
Speaker 0: So you so when you place the ninth tile, you can flip it over.

439
00:25:46,943 --> 00:25:48,590
Speaker 1: So a plus so five tiles.

440
00:25:48,892 --> 00:25:50,950
Speaker 1: Okay, then you turn it into the ziggurat.

441
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:58,110
Speaker 1: It is a black only monument and the black leader there gets one cube of their choice every round.

442
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:03,279
Speaker 1: Yeah There's also one building for you.

443
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:04,704
Speaker 0: Can you can the five tiles?

444
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,610
Speaker 0: Does it have to be like one color?

445
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,138
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what doesn't matter which one.

446
00:26:08,178 --> 00:26:08,319
Speaker 0: Nope.

447
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,324
Speaker 0: Okay, but it's a black.

448
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:10,350
Speaker 1: only there's another thing.

449
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,207
Speaker 1: there are four buildings one of each color and you place them once.

450
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:21,470
Speaker 1: you make a Horizontal or vertical line of tiles of that color that are at least three long.

451
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:26,070
Speaker 1: You can choose upon placing the third one to place that building on the tile.

452
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,649
Speaker 0: All right.

453
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:33,369
Speaker 1: Now any further tiles placed in that kingdom give that colored leader double points.

454
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:36,145
Speaker 0: Right, so the colored leader?

455
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:36,770
Speaker 0: who's in the king?

456
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:36,850
Speaker 0: So

457
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,331
Speaker 1: if I place the green special building in a kingdom and I have the green leader and then later I place a green tile You get

458
00:26:42,371 --> 00:26:43,013
Speaker 0: two green

459
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:44,097
Speaker 1: now, but

460
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:45,803
Speaker 0: if someone takes that from you, so

461
00:26:45,843 --> 00:26:49,707
Speaker 1: the way you take that from someone is not normal It's longest road.

462
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:59,630
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, if I build a line of four green somewhere else in the boards fucking You can just internal conflict him in the kingdom that has or I can build a line of four green.

463
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:05,329
Speaker 1: You could but you could end the tiles don't go away they stay in the kingdom for strength.

464
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,960
Speaker 0: Oh, you know someone external conflicts or what?

465
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,073
Speaker 1: if I catastrophe that shit you can get asked me around it Yeah and break it.

466
00:27:11,455 --> 00:27:12,983
Speaker 1: All right, but someone else still has to take it.

467
00:27:13,405 --> 00:27:15,443
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm It's interesting.

468
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,853
Speaker 0: That's interesting Yeah, we'll see.

469
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,619
Speaker 1: well because the reason they added it is.

470
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,690
Speaker 1: the other alternate board has this huge open land area.

471
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:26,330
Speaker 1: So there's a. there's much more kind of pattern recognition action going on in that area.

472
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:32,290
Speaker 1: That board also has kind of an inside outside Mechanic of the river in terms of pressures to take and more treasures.

473
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:35,070
Speaker 0: We gotta hurry this up because we're burning the whole front of the show.

474
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,447
Speaker 0: But I played one more game called space alert space alert space alert.

475
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:38,970
Speaker 0: was this weird?

476
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,890
Speaker 0: It was a real-time board game, right?

477
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,950
Speaker 0: And basically the way it's supposed to work is you get these audio recordings that tell tell you what happens But we didn't have the audio recording.

478
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:53,430
Speaker 0: So one guy sat there with a with a clock a timer and he read off the card at the precise times.

479
00:27:53,571 --> 00:28:00,070
Speaker 0: What you know, but if you have the audio recording You don't need a person to run the game because it'll just say the things that needs to say at the right time.

480
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,850
Speaker 1: That's a really interesting idea.

481
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:10,750
Speaker 0: So for example, you'll play around and the round will be X minutes and then it'll resolve And when the time is up you resolve and figure out if you want or not, right?

482
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:11,594
Speaker 0: and it's a beat.

483
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:21,650
Speaker 0: the game game and the way it works is you're on a spaceship and Aliens are coming and they're gonna shoot you right and you need to basically you all program your character, right?

484
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:33,268
Speaker 0: And you probe you have cards and you put the cards down on this little thing to sort of Command your guy to do so to be like go to the left side of the board Go to the bottom half of the board you have up down left right, right?

485
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,403
Speaker 0: Use push the a button move right.

486
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:39,275
Speaker 0: push the B button move Right.

487
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:47,890
Speaker 0: So some of the buttons shoot lasers and some of the buttons, you know Break open a canister with more energy and some of the buttons transfer energy from one area the ship to the other.

488
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:51,970
Speaker 0: Some of the buttons charge up a shield, you know, all the buttons do different things.

489
00:28:52,351 --> 00:29:03,410
Speaker 0: So you have you know some number of players and the different ships attacking you have different special abilities too Like we got screwed because I tried to attack this one ship, but I attacked it too early.

490
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,210
Speaker 0: So it was too far away and the shot didn't reach and so you got it.

491
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,290
Speaker 0: Basically, you have this short time limit.

492
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:15,390
Speaker 0: You're basically racing against the clock all the all these all of you together and you're trying to each program your own character.

493
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:20,538
Speaker 0: You know together Such that and you can't program them.

494
00:29:20,578 --> 00:29:21,300
Speaker 0: face up either.

495
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,123
Speaker 0: you're programming them.

496
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:23,267
Speaker 0: face down, huh?

497
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:24,090
Speaker 1: I just had an idea.

498
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:24,431
Speaker 1: What did you?

499
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:29,229
Speaker 1: take that and combine it with the multiple transforming combining sentai robot kind of show?

500
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,175
Speaker 1: Five pilots in the robot.

501
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,481
Speaker 1: You've got to coordinate to win.

502
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:34,747
Speaker 0: That's not the same kind.

503
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:35,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, it could work.

504
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:36,841
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, it was.

505
00:29:36,962 --> 00:29:37,970
Speaker 0: it was a little bit hectic.

506
00:29:38,071 --> 00:29:42,799
Speaker 0: The problem was I think not you know It only really works if everyone gets it.

507
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,120
Speaker 0: like.

508
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:48,219
Speaker 0: we barely won on the easiest possible scenario And we played the second most easy scenario.

509
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,665
Speaker 1: and was it obvious who didn't get it.

510
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:58,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Mean I see I thought I got it but even though but because I was I got it.

511
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,122
Speaker 0: But the thing was I couldn't keep track of all the stuff.

512
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:03,070
Speaker 0: it was because it was so much going on.

513
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:04,010
Speaker 0: I didn't recognize.

514
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:07,117
Speaker 0: You know I couldn't keep in my head all that.

515
00:30:07,137 --> 00:30:12,895
Speaker 0: there were three different aliens attacking us and each one had a different special ability and You know, there were.

516
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:28,039
Speaker 0: you know, we had to get the energy and fire the guns and do enough damage and you know You really need every enough people to all get it simultaneously to be able to parse all the information To program all of your characters to actually win.

517
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:40,910
Speaker 0: and you know while you're playing it'll be like new alien appears, you know You know, it'll be like, okay, you can trade cards with each other for the next 30 seconds And you know, you can't trade cards anymore.

518
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:50,098
Speaker 1: I never considered the idea of using an audio recording or some sort of audio like triggered Mechanism to make a game.

519
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:53,070
Speaker 1: that is actually like physicality and timeliness matters.

520
00:30:53,211 --> 00:30:58,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go to their website and listen to some of the mp3 Not that they're gonna help you without the game.

521
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:00,646
Speaker 1: But yeah, but it's a brilliant idea.

522
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:01,790
Speaker 1: I think more people should try that.

523
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:03,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a beat the game game.

524
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:12,246
Speaker 1: So I guess right on to things of the day.

525
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,135
Speaker 1: You got a thing of the day Great thing of the day.

526
00:31:14,235 --> 00:31:15,481
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

527
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,209
Speaker 0: Did I use this on the show before we'll find out?

528
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,046
Speaker 0: Apparently there's this guy named Jake Adelstein, right?

529
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:20,610
Speaker 0: I don't know if you know.

530
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did this last week.

531
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:23,922
Speaker 0: Did I wasn't my thing of the day.

532
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:25,147
Speaker 1: Did we do any shows last week?

533
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:26,030
Speaker 1: Huh?

534
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,093
Speaker 1: No, we didn't.

535
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:27,755
Speaker 1: I'm messing with you.

536
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:28,097
Speaker 0: Go on.

537
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:35,626
Speaker 0: Okay, and he's I think I might have talked about him on the show before He's his Jew who went to Japan and he how he we like how he was a yacht.

538
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:36,490
Speaker 0: He was a crime reporter.

539
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, you talked about.

540
00:31:37,335 --> 00:31:38,563
Speaker 0: he got all in with the yacht.

541
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:39,690
Speaker 1: is the guy on The Daily Show, right?

542
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:41,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he did the expose.

543
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:43,713
Speaker 1: and the guy they come to America to get livers Exactly.

544
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

545
00:31:44,478 --> 00:31:46,610
Speaker 0: So this is this is this guy who's all in with the Yakuza?

546
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:52,830
Speaker 0: So he actually what he did was he went to some of his Yakuza friends because somebody told him to right?

547
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,174
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I know what you're doing.

548
00:31:54,194 --> 00:31:54,656
Speaker 1: This is good.

549
00:31:54,757 --> 00:31:57,690
Speaker 0: And he got the game the PlayStation or is it's a PlayStation game, right?

550
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:04,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, Yakuza 3 the Yakuza simulator when we played at packs and he got some Yakuza to play Yakuza 3.

551
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:06,370
Speaker 0: This is sort of like when football players may play Madden, right?

552
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:14,382
Speaker 0: So and he wanted that or when they get race car drivers to play like Forza Gran Turismo and ask him how it is I'm glad he's not worried that they're gonna kill him anymore.

553
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:17,490
Speaker 0: These are his you know, these are friendly Yakuza Yakuza that he was friends with right?

554
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:32,215
Speaker 0: I'm sure they're still Yakuza who would probably want to kill him or maybe I don't know but you know These were Yakuza that he was on good terms with even though There's a funny part in this in this piece where it's like one of the Yakuza says Gaijin and one of the other ones like Don't say Gaijin.

555
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:33,120
Speaker 0: Jake's a Gaijin.

556
00:32:33,401 --> 00:32:33,702
Speaker 0: He's like.

557
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:34,888
Speaker 0: you just say gai kouguji.

558
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:36,570
Speaker 0: He's like.

559
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:40,047
Speaker 0: But you know they talk about.

560
00:32:40,107 --> 00:32:44,770
Speaker 0: you know Some of the things in the game that they like and some of the things in the game that they don't like, you know.

561
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,818
Speaker 0: And stuff, you know and how they like how.

562
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:53,035
Speaker 0: you know Sake powers you up and he's like, oh they should have crystal meth It should be a power up.

563
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:58,636
Speaker 0: and oh they were excited that the game had Sake and all the different, you know Cuz we saw that right all the different Sake's.

564
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:05,739
Speaker 1: We did the Sake part and the pool part and I like Sake and I like pool Billiards pool not pool pool.

565
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

566
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:11,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, it was a. It's a really interesting article about Yakuza playing Yakuza.

567
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:15,910
Speaker 1: random aside listeners Do you guys actually know that billiards and pool are different games and do you know the difference?

568
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:24,038
Speaker 0: And there's also multiple different billiards and multiple different pools I think the only people and there's also the kind with the bumpers I think the only people.

569
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,869
Speaker 1: we had a bumper pool table and also snooker.

570
00:33:26,251 --> 00:33:31,850
Speaker 1: We actually had a bumper pool table for games and you could lift it out and put in a billiards table instead.

571
00:33:32,812 --> 00:33:33,495
Speaker 0: But I don't know.

572
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,829
Speaker 0: actually I don't really know how any of the games work.

573
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:44,303
Speaker 0: I think I know there's one where you have to get all the balls it but you have to give him an order and there's one we have to get all the balls in but it doesn't really order doesn't matter as much.

574
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:45,929
Speaker 1: nine ball is one of the.

575
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:52,744
Speaker 1: get Him in in the right order, but regardless I think Donald Duck in math magic land is the primary reason I know about billiards.

576
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:55,413
Speaker 0: and then there's you know snooker Which I don't even fucking know.

577
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,236
Speaker 1: Snooker is awesome.

578
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,239
Speaker 1: It's the 10-foot table.

579
00:33:57,581 --> 00:33:57,862
Speaker 0: Yeah.

580
00:33:58,383 --> 00:34:01,910
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so really quick This is a list someone compiled.

581
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:09,697
Speaker 1: he's a prison guard in Wisconsin medium security because I'm sure the list is actually probably very different and He just.

582
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:11,090
Speaker 1: he's a board gamer board game geek.

583
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,516
Speaker 1: So he observed and tried to make a list of.

584
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:21,884
Speaker 1: here are the games that I see played most often by people in Prison, I mean they let you play board games in prison medium security.

585
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:23,449
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's a way.

586
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:25,902
Speaker 0: So what crime do I commit to go to medium security prison?

587
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:26,525
Speaker 0: Ah shit.

588
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:27,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's the problem.

589
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:28,172
Speaker 1: They don't play.

590
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,438
Speaker 1: risk that often you know why.

591
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,389
Speaker 1: it takes forever to check out and check in all the individual dice.

592
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:35,050
Speaker 0: They have to check out and check in every dice.

593
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:37,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you don't want the dice to get in the wrong hands.

594
00:34:37,931 --> 00:34:39,089
Speaker 1: They might turn into a tiny shave.

595
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:47,069
Speaker 0: But can't you just check out the whole box and then they just check when you return it that every single pain in the every Single item in the box is in the comments on every game.

596
00:34:47,692 --> 00:34:49,136
Speaker 1: This is well worth perusing.

597
00:34:49,196 --> 00:34:53,510
Speaker 0: number one dominoes make sense, but don't you to check out each and every individual domino?

598
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,909
Speaker 1: I think I could make a shiv out of a domino pretty easily.

599
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could just friggin snap make triangles in here.

600
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,236
Speaker 1: The one that I found funny is Jenga.

601
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:01,501
Speaker 0: you could make a wicked splinter.

602
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,952
Speaker 1: you hold out a little bit and there's like escape from Cold.

603
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:05,340
Speaker 1: it's duh, really?

604
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:06,025

605
00:35:06,085 --> 00:35:08,012
Speaker 0: It's in some Prison.

Speaker 1: It's called prison bitch.

608
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:18,186
Speaker 1: It is in the category of fighting horror and mature adult.

609
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:24,159
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Yeah, all right, so Man, I'm gonna move right on to the meta moment.

Speaker 1: we're working on a story For that.

621
00:35:52,271 --> 00:35:57,670

676
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:17,149
Speaker 1: after testing it at Kinetic on I was reminded of some egregiously unrealized games.

687
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:55,185

Speaker 0: You know what?

691
00:38:58,073 --> 00:39:02,581
Speaker 0: I've been doing is when I'm on the subway or sitting around somewhere I would play games on my iPhone.

692
00:39:02,903 --> 00:39:03,749
Speaker 1: I read a book.

693
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:07,790

694
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:11,143
Speaker 0: So I'm sitting there and I'm like, what should I play on my iPhone?

699
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:31,670
Speaker 0: So when I'm on the subway, I'm just like, you know flipping through a book real quick.

Speaker 0: And I've actually.

701
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:41,290
Speaker 0: this is actually the first time I've been able to read like two books Simultaneously like an actual book and a book, you know, I usually I can't read two books at once.

702
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:44,657
Speaker 0: I know you love that simultaneously.

703
00:39:44,738 --> 00:39:45,762
Speaker 0: So it keeps coming up.

706
00:39:59,732 --> 00:40:02,324
Speaker 1: But I'm most of the way through the golden compass, which I'd never read.

00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,990
Speaker 1: Well, maybe he's shy and he's like, well, I don't have anything just really add to this conversation.

741
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,702
Speaker 1: We're like, why not?

742
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:49,150
Speaker 1: Don't you agree?

743
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,901
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't really read books and we all I don't.

744
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:52,885
Speaker 1: I don't read like.

745
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:54,070
Speaker 1: what do you mean you don't read books?

746
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:56,683
Speaker 1: He's like, I just I don't read for like anything.

747
00:41:56,723 --> 00:42:02,210
Speaker 1: He's like no, not really For like can you read is like I can read but you don't.

748
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:06,722
Speaker 1: No, I don't read and yeah, we didn't have anything to say.

749
00:42:07,023 --> 00:42:08,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, so don't be that guy.

750
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,262
Speaker 0: Okay expansions of games.

751
00:42:12,383 --> 00:42:13,630
Speaker 1: I got the teeny expansion.

752
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:19,190
Speaker 0: I'm so excited about this even though it's really because I don't know how it's you know, I mean it could be good.

753
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,355
Speaker 1: But here's why I'm excited.

754
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,961
Speaker 1: Tigers New Freighties is a game.

755
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:24,150
Speaker 1: It's my favorite board game in the world.

756
00:42:24,611 --> 00:42:34,884
Speaker 1: Nothing is better than it right now in my eyes for my own personal rim amusement Mm-hmm, but the game is very played out as a crew.

757
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:37,150
Speaker 1: We have mostly solved that game.

758
00:42:37,451 --> 00:42:39,296
Speaker 1: Very small number of strategies.

759
00:42:39,617 --> 00:42:41,141
Speaker 1: It probably comes down to luck.

760
00:42:41,161 --> 00:42:43,227
Speaker 1: We haven't proven it yet because we're now.

761
00:42:43,247 --> 00:42:44,090
Speaker 1: we play that game a lot.

762
00:42:45,032 --> 00:42:45,976
Speaker 1: We always speculated.

763
00:42:46,057 --> 00:42:48,750
Speaker 1: Well, if we just change the aim a little bit, it'll be a whole new game.

764
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:54,629
Speaker 1: We don't know what the dynamic would be if we like move this river a little bit or you know Took out like 10 red tiles and then went.

765
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,870
Speaker 1: So we never bothered doing that because game balance is difficult.

766
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:05,389
Speaker 1: So all the expansion here for Tigers New Freighties is is a balanced a known balanced a tested.

767
00:43:06,091 --> 00:43:07,375
Speaker 0: You would hope so, right?

768
00:43:07,395 --> 00:43:11,810
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of times expansions come out and they're not actually balanced tested.

769
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,695
Speaker 0: It's like they just took some house.

770
00:43:13,835 --> 00:43:16,182
Speaker 0: Sometimes they're fixes for a broken game, right?

771
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:19,250
Speaker 0: Sometimes they're broken like the river.

772
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:24,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know sometimes there's something that's just thrown together to make more money Dominion.

773
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:25,770
Speaker 1: They're just printing money.

774
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:33,577
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's something like carcass own cities where it's not accident expansion But a whole new game that has nothing to do with carcass And they just slap the carcass own label out.

775
00:43:33,617 --> 00:43:37,050
Speaker 1: Remember there was even a salary to you and Euphrates card game.

776
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,136
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll just take the same.

777
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:41,163
Speaker 0: Well, that's not really an expansion, right?

778
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was still called Tigers New Freighties.

779
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was at least you know, but the thing is like the settlers card game the Tigris and Euphrates card game.

780
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,035
Speaker 0: There's you know, Colorado.

781
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:52,650
Speaker 0: Those are at least mechanically similar to their board game counterparts.

782
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:58,010
Speaker 0: They're just you know They make the same a similar game with just cards to make it more portable.

783
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:03,050
Speaker 1: I think the bottom of the expansion barrel is and we were standing we were at a cat a pension.

784
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:04,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was uber con.

785
00:44:04,936 --> 00:44:05,879
Speaker 0: I know it's Connecticut.

786
00:44:05,959 --> 00:44:06,641
Speaker 0: Was it Connecticut?

787
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:09,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're standing there and we see carcass own expansion.

788
00:44:09,611 --> 00:44:10,048
Speaker 1: It's like huh?

789
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,113
Speaker 1: What if there are any new ones?

790
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:20,201
Speaker 1: and I pick up the catapult and I turn it over and sure enough is a physical Catapult and you lob your meeples at the board.

791
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:22,447
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly the mechanics of this.

792
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:23,470
Speaker 0: What do you physically do it?

793
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:33,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm holding it and I look at Scott and he looks at me and I'm like Seriously, that is I mean the shark was jumped way before that but that was like you jump the strike again.

794
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:45,747
Speaker 0: It's like okay We jump the shark and now we're gonna jump a beluga whale and the guy running the stall looks to us and says Yeah But it's like dude you put this in your inventory and he's like you didn't have to order this shit.

795
00:44:46,008 --> 00:44:46,530
Speaker 1: it sells.

796
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:47,478
Speaker 1: I mean look at pecs.

797
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,950
Speaker 0: who has bought the dead pecs?

798
00:44:49,111 --> 00:44:52,910
Speaker 1: We're like, why do they have a thousand copies of ticket to ride and no copies of Puerto Rico?

799
00:44:53,332 --> 00:44:55,521
Speaker 1: They sold all those tickets to ride.

800
00:44:55,562 --> 00:44:57,450
Speaker 0: Hey, they really sold all the tickets to ride.

801
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,665
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know about all of them out of a lot of memory or that.

802
00:45:00,705 --> 00:45:01,730
Speaker 1: I guess they buried him.

803
00:45:02,072 --> 00:45:04,408
Speaker 0: They should have had a stack of dominions equally high.

804
00:45:04,751 --> 00:45:10,904
Speaker 1: But the thing is if they're gonna sell dominions and tickets to rides No matter what they're gonna sell them all and they can only bring us that number.

805
00:45:11,466 --> 00:45:12,270
Speaker 1: bring the shit of your game.

806
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:14,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't sell your good game.

807
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,826
Speaker 1: If you don't have to the good game will sell.

808
00:45:16,846 --> 00:45:17,690
Speaker 0: you can sell both.

809
00:45:18,691 --> 00:45:21,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they kind of had him stacked up filling the whole booth.

810
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:22,610
Speaker 0: I don't know where they got so many.

811
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,781
Speaker 0: I don't know what the deal is with that.

812
00:45:23,942 --> 00:45:24,285
Speaker 0: Whatever.

813
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:31,317
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, I mean, you know expansions are kind of weird because like sometimes, you know There's no like.

814
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:35,876
Speaker 0: usually when there's something you can have a set rule Like I don't do any expansions or expansions are good.

815
00:45:35,957 --> 00:45:41,031
Speaker 0: But really there is no set rule, you know, sometimes it's just more of the same Right.

816
00:45:41,091 --> 00:45:41,733
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

817
00:45:41,814 --> 00:45:45,947
Speaker 0: I played this game and now I need another map like battle tech or

818
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:47,677
Speaker 1: like the final doom Yeah,

819
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:56,858
Speaker 0: but sometimes You know, it's like, okay, you're trying to make more money and you just made some crap, you know And you put the same name on it or to make some more money

820
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:02,214
Speaker 1: or the full extreme of that is now the micro expansions Aka the gun horse.

821
00:46:03,016 --> 00:46:03,758
Speaker 0: What's the gun horse?

822
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,770
Speaker 1: the penny arcade comic when Grand Theft Auto?

823
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:18,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, the DLCs where it's like pay money and your character can look different or Gun bound right and pay money and your character actually is better.

824
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:24,210
Speaker 0: I mean, what is the difference like between an expansion to a game and say a booster pack of magic cards, right?

825
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,410
Speaker 0: I mean if you consider the starter pack to be the game a booster is an expansion, right?

826
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe the expansion is not the booster cards, but the booster sets.

827
00:46:34,593 --> 00:46:38,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, so some magic the gathering like I like how you hmm like that was somehow wise.

828
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:45,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like, you know edition X of magic is a game or ice age is a game but fallen empires.

829
00:46:45,512 --> 00:46:48,289
Speaker 1: I said magic died long before ice age came out.

830
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:51,139
Speaker 0: I'm just saying right now who would be?

831
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:55,353
Speaker 0: that would be the game and the expansion would be fallen empires or Whatever else.

832
00:46:55,474 --> 00:46:56,578
Speaker 0: dark would be an expansion.

833
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:57,803
Speaker 0: Yep, but unlimited would be.

834
00:46:57,823 --> 00:46:58,466
Speaker 1: which came first?

835
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:01,463
Speaker 1: the darker fallen empires Dark, which came first?

836
00:47:01,503 --> 00:47:05,021
Speaker 1: the dark Arabian Nights Arabian Nights which came first?

837
00:47:05,042 --> 00:47:06,170
Speaker 1: Arabian Nights or antiquities.

838
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:11,123
Speaker 0: Uh Antiquities came after I think the dog.

839
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,910
Speaker 1: So you remember the order of the expansion?

840
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,491
Speaker 0: How do you know?

841
00:47:13,511 --> 00:47:15,759
Speaker 1: I'm right because I know uh-huh.

842
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,007
Speaker 1: Yeah Arabian Nights was the first expansion to magic.

843
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:23,437
Speaker 0: All right anyway, anyway What's my character's name?

844
00:47:23,457 --> 00:47:27,533
Speaker 1: in the dwarf game you're the game master for Boring.

845
00:47:27,654 --> 00:47:28,638
Speaker 0: you're in something like that.

846
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,427
Speaker 0: You're in Gormor Gormor.

847
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:33,683
Speaker 1: That's it Very bronze murder II kind of name.

848
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:36,073
Speaker 1: Yeah You're right though, there's.

849
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:48,566
Speaker 1: no I can't make any blanket statements about expansions because they range from the catapult To the gun horse to Like Dominion.

850
00:47:48,607 --> 00:47:53,689
Speaker 1: in here I'm trying to come up with the name of a good one because Dominion injury really just like the Dominion expansions.

851
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:55,554
Speaker 0: Dominion Seaside was actually really good.

852
00:47:55,634 --> 00:48:01,370
Speaker 1: They took a game that we the best that we had immediately solved and made it unsolvable a little bit longer.

853
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:04,550
Speaker 0: I think seaside is the one that really made the game better.

854
00:48:04,671 --> 00:48:06,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think after alchemy and all that.

855
00:48:06,703 --> 00:48:07,689
Speaker 1: I don't think there's much more.

856
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:11,910
Speaker 0: Well, I might get this prosperity one because it's basically epic level and then that's it.

857
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:13,135
Speaker 1: That's gotta be it because they get that.

858
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,149
Speaker 1: this is my real beef with expansions right now.

859
00:48:16,611 --> 00:48:24,840
Speaker 1: And I think it's weird because I think the board game industry in particular is following this path Which is kind of separate from the DLC problem We're seeing in.

860
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:30,298
Speaker 1: you know The fact that people will make a game that is clearly Unfinished and will clearly sell DLC.

861
00:48:30,338 --> 00:48:37,045
Speaker 1: that would have just been part of the game had the game come out five years earlier Mmm, but board games are going this different tag.

862
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:43,709
Speaker 1: I Feel like any board game that is popular will have expansions no matter what?

863
00:48:45,371 --> 00:48:48,549
Speaker 1: Modern board games like Dominion came out as soon as it succeeded.

864
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,803
Speaker 1: Expansions every fucking five minutes like up.

865
00:48:51,844 --> 00:48:52,467
Speaker 1: Here's another one up.

866
00:48:52,507 --> 00:48:53,010
Speaker 1: Here's another one.

867
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:54,636
Speaker 1: They just keep making them there.

868
00:48:54,957 --> 00:48:58,590
Speaker 1: There doesn't seem to be a lot of thought to balance in these expansions.

869
00:48:59,132 --> 00:49:08,580
Speaker 0: Well, I mean and even when there is Thought to balance it's this clearly the motivation is more money as opposed to actually making the game better.

870
00:49:08,742 --> 00:49:10,400
Speaker 0: It's like some games need an expansion.

871
00:49:10,922 --> 00:49:14,856
Speaker 0: Sometimes an expansion is nice, but some you know, like formula day, right?

872
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:15,800
Speaker 0: You're playing formula day.

873
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:18,193
Speaker 0: Why not get some more maps in there, right?

874
00:49:18,213 --> 00:49:19,380
Speaker 0: It doesn't hurt, you know.

875
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:22,571
Speaker 0: And if you played a lot of formula day, you probably want some more maps.

876
00:49:22,892 --> 00:49:24,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a totally good expansion.

877
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:28,960
Speaker 0: power grid Same way when I get some more maps and more power plants make total sense, right?

878
00:49:29,442 --> 00:49:31,272
Speaker 0: But Dominion it's like you add some cards.

879
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:32,760
Speaker 0: Okay, you add some more cards.

880
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:35,056
Speaker 0: All right, you add some more cards to do something different.

881
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:40,350
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, we're gonna add just you know The same exact cards again only even bigger

882
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:49,400
Speaker 1: because you can go down this road where if you expand too much You've basically made an entirely separate game that has this dumb dependency on owning some other game

883
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:49,902
Speaker 0: Yeah,

884
00:49:50,082 --> 00:49:54,518
Speaker 1: which culminates in the box that includes the game and all the expansions for like 60 bucks

885
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:57,360
Speaker 0: You know, but that's that's how they roll.

886
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:00,894
Speaker 0: I think the other trouble is that video games do the same thing by the game of the year edition.

887
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,159
Speaker 0: that includes all the DLCs.

888
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,448
Speaker 0: That's my Borderlands.

889
00:50:03,468 --> 00:50:04,537
Speaker 0: Like I came with a bunch of DLCs

890
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:23,339
Speaker 1: I think there's a big push when making a board game expansion at least to add a lot of unnecessary physical bits Because a lot of the good expansions in the old days you'd buy it for like 20 bucks and you get home and there's like One little deck of cards and like one token.

891
00:50:23,781 --> 00:50:25,548
Speaker 0: Well, I mean look the carcass own expansion.

892
00:50:25,608 --> 00:50:27,294
Speaker 0: Some of them are like just a tiny little box.

893
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:28,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're like two bucks.

894
00:50:29,188 --> 00:50:29,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

895
00:50:30,382 --> 00:50:38,112
Speaker 1: But like remember all the El Grande expansions back in the day the one that added a medic ooh, Maddie America or the Inquisition or the.

896
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:39,820
Speaker 0: yeah the there was like a doge.

897
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:44,840
Speaker 1: I remember I played the Inquisition before then because everyone knew the rules the rules that were very simple.

898
00:50:45,261 --> 00:50:47,108
Speaker 1: You just made an extra card stuck it in there.

899
00:50:47,368 --> 00:50:49,817
Speaker 1: people would use like raisins or pennies to be the Inquisitors.

900
00:50:50,238 --> 00:50:57,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Sometimes an expansion is just really a rules modification and it's like why should I pay money for a rules modification?

901
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:00,046
Speaker 1: But that's the thing you pay to get.

902
00:51:00,126 --> 00:51:04,180
Speaker 1: the physical accoutrement of the rules modification like the teeny expansion.

903
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,692
Speaker 1: The alternate board is there these four buildings.

904
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,056
Speaker 1: I have these little buildings I can use.

905
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:10,822
Speaker 1: I don't have to make them Mm-hmm.

906
00:51:11,224 --> 00:51:16,929
Speaker 0: I mean like, you know Agricola get some sheep get some actual animals instead of cubes, you know Get some more cards.

907
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,080
Speaker 1: Is that really an expansion?

908
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:24,866
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there's a mod but they do have that there is an expansion for Agricola the farmers of the whatever I feel like we need it.

909
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:26,555
Speaker 1: I feel like we've already tapped out Agricola.

910
00:51:26,575 --> 00:51:27,459
Speaker 0: So really you think so?

911
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,256
Speaker 1: I think with the base I could play a lot of Agricola that I could do.

912
00:51:31,336 --> 00:51:33,001
Speaker 1: but I think we've The.

913
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:36,693
Speaker 1: everyone plays the solitaire perfectly and are mostly.

914
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:42,991
Speaker 0: I believe the thing is is that there's still Even though I know the solitaire perfectly like sometimes I play.

915
00:51:43,031 --> 00:51:45,980
Speaker 0: it's like I'm trying to get on the schedule to get the babies.

916
00:51:46,581 --> 00:51:47,868
Speaker 0: Sometimes it just doesn't happen.

917
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:50,000
Speaker 1: So obviously it's not every time it doesn't happen.

918
00:51:50,521 --> 00:52:00,007
Speaker 1: I argue it is because other players have stepped up the game and they're playing left right or I'm where you need to be Possibly and I and that's the whole game.

919
00:52:00,188 --> 00:52:07,649
Speaker 1: The real game of Agricola is really just I'm where you need to be or I left righted you And everything else is.

920
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:11,048
Speaker 0: sometimes the cards can get you ahead Yeah, but then you just you're playing solitaire.

921
00:52:11,068 --> 00:52:12,494
Speaker 1: if you have the cards that'll get you ahead.

922
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:14,020
Speaker 1: you play the cards to get yourself.

923
00:52:14,762 --> 00:52:18,671
Speaker 0: Mmm, I mean You know, sometimes you gotta you gotta be.

924
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:21,650
Speaker 0: sometimes depending on the cards you get Maybe there'll be a creative way to get ahead.

925
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:22,717
Speaker 0: You didn't think of or?

926
00:52:22,737 --> 00:52:24,348
Speaker 1: yeah It's weird because it's.

927
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:34,993
Speaker 1: I feel like the game is solved But because it takes a lot of mental effort to figure out the solution to the new solitaire I get every time we play I never get bored with Agricola.

928
00:52:35,475 --> 00:52:36,520
Speaker 1: I can still play it forever.

929
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:41,620
Speaker 1: I can still play Puerto Rico a million times even though I don't know the plantations change.

930
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,880
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm actually making that many decisions when I play Puerto Rico most of the time anymore.

931
00:52:46,283 --> 00:52:52,980
Speaker 0: The other thing is that a lot of board game Expansions these days are actually just like they'll be promotional things like a board game geek.

932
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,112
Speaker 0: I've gotten like four different Dominion cards for free.

933
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:58,080
Speaker 0: Well for the price of shipping, right?

934
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,014
Speaker 0: They're just giving them out promotionally and it's like that's.

935
00:53:01,175 --> 00:53:02,019
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty cool.

936
00:53:02,542 --> 00:53:03,646
Speaker 0: You know, imagine if it's just like.

937
00:53:03,686 --> 00:53:08,429
Speaker 0: hey look, here's some more metal pieces from Monopoly So you don't have to be the dog or the boat.

938
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,180
Speaker 1: Well Nintendo does that with Pokemon?

939
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,686
Speaker 1: Hey, you want a new Pokemon.

940
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:12,510
Speaker 1: come to Toys R Us.

941
00:53:12,971 --> 00:53:13,413
Speaker 0: That's true.

942
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:14,337
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

943
00:53:14,638 --> 00:53:14,960
Speaker 0: Same thing.

944
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:17,068
Speaker 1: Ah, why isn't there a Pokemon board game?

945
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:18,814
Speaker 0: I think there is is there.

946
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:22,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I know this Pokemon Opoly, but I'm pretty sure there's other Pokemon.

947
00:53:22,028 --> 00:53:22,610
Speaker 0: I have to look.

948
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:23,735
Speaker 1: I know this Pokemon card game.

949
00:53:23,997 --> 00:53:26,304
Speaker 0: There's the Pokemon Clicks game.

950
00:53:26,385 --> 00:53:28,860
Speaker 0: right that actually has the really good figures.

951
00:53:29,662 --> 00:53:32,400
Speaker 0: I don't know if you know, the game is any good, but the figures are really nice.

952
00:53:32,661 --> 00:53:36,053
Speaker 0: I don't know if that ever took off or kept going or died out or what.

953
00:53:36,154 --> 00:53:37,900
Speaker 1: but can you think of any expansions?

954
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:46,170
Speaker 1: Because I remember it when I was trying to come up with examples of like from the catapult - I Couldn't name an expansion that was like mind-blowing to me.

955
00:53:46,491 --> 00:53:49,400
Speaker 0: No, I don't think there is an expansion that's mind-blowingly awesome.

956
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:57,685
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I think the best expansions are the ones that just give you more goodness, right like El Grande was a good example.

957
00:53:57,725 --> 00:54:08,980
Speaker 1: the expansions to El Grande because the game is still one of the most popular Board games ever like the fact that it's still in the top 10 of board game geek Despite the fact that no one fucking knows what it is and hardly anyone we ever meet has played it.

958
00:54:09,441 --> 00:54:13,795
Speaker 1: It's still like an enduring game, but we played it enough to where the basic game.

959
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:15,079
Speaker 1: We know what to do.

960
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,620
Speaker 1: We know what's going on.

961
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,914
Speaker 0: I think that the the expansions that are that are really good are the more of the same ones.

962
00:54:20,974 --> 00:54:22,700
Speaker 0: more like it's a video game.

963
00:54:23,181 --> 00:54:23,703
Speaker 0: You beat it.

964
00:54:24,325 --> 00:54:26,070
Speaker 0: Here's another level right?

965
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,013
Speaker 0: Like how can you kill?

966
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,400
Speaker 0: like half-life 2 episode, right?

967
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,725
Speaker 0: Is that written expansion?

968
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:31,970
Speaker 1: turn in taxes?

969
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,235
Speaker 1: Here's another board.

970
00:54:33,275 --> 00:54:34,360
Speaker 1: So you have a new board to solve.

971
00:54:34,721 --> 00:54:35,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it's like.

972
00:54:36,045 --> 00:54:37,209
Speaker 0: it's just you like this.

973
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:43,740
Speaker 0: Here's more of it with no changes or not many changes You know like fallout 3 if you like it that Vegas thing.

974
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,544
Speaker 0: It's like here you get to.

975
00:54:44,564 --> 00:54:48,517
Speaker 0: you have a whole new city to go explore, you know, if you like that action There you go.

976
00:54:49,543 --> 00:54:56,647
Speaker 1: The reason for this is again that if you if you change in mod too much, you're not making an expansion You're making a mod final.

977
00:54:56,687 --> 00:55:07,044
Speaker 1: doom was a sequel or an expansion to doom But like Bethesda was a mod of doom and s is kind of an expansion of half-life But really it's a mod.

978
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:10,820
Speaker 1: You're using the pieces of one game to play a totally different game.

979
00:55:11,124 --> 00:55:18,684
Speaker 1: I think that's you know It's like if I use a teeny board and I make up like all these new rules and this totally different game That's a mod.

980
00:55:18,725 --> 00:55:21,917
Speaker 1: That's not an expansion of T and E even if I package it and sell it.

981
00:55:22,479 --> 00:55:22,841
Speaker 0: Yeah It's.

982
00:55:23,022 --> 00:55:24,950
Speaker 0: it's really a tough distinction to think about.

983
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,653
Speaker 0: What's a mod?

984
00:55:25,733 --> 00:55:26,617
Speaker 0: What's an expansion?

985
00:55:26,677 --> 00:55:27,340
Speaker 0: What's a sequel?

986
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:35,420
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of blurry lines here Like, you know is half-life 2 episode 1 a mod or an expansion or a sequel, right?

987
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:43,323
Speaker 0: Expansion because it's I think the line is counter-strike a mod a sequel or an expansion mod or You know what?

988
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,229
Speaker 1: So far these are easy, right?

989
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:48,679
Speaker 0: I mean, so what makes it a mod as opposed to a completely separate game?

990
00:55:49,822 --> 00:55:52,639
Speaker 1: Because it would because all the underlying bits were from another existing game.

991
00:55:53,302 --> 00:55:56,273
Speaker 0: So because it's using the same technology as half-life.

992
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:57,738
Speaker 0: counter-strike is a is a?

993
00:55:57,838 --> 00:55:58,240
Speaker 0: is a mod?

994
00:55:58,461 --> 00:55:58,903
Speaker 1: I think so.

995
00:55:59,125 --> 00:56:01,679
Speaker 0: So how about Jedi Knight 2 which uses the quake 3 tech?

996
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,612
Speaker 1: So I was about to say technology one layer above the engine.

997
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:05,355
Speaker 0: Uh-huh

998
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,054
Speaker 1: because it uses the assets of the game to not just the engine

999
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:12,675
Speaker 0: some of them but Counter-strike source doesn't really has complete

1000
00:56:12,695 --> 00:56:17,571
Speaker 1: counter-strike source I would argue is a sequel to counter-strike itself a mod of half-life,

1001
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:22,744
Speaker 0: but is counter-strike source a mod of half-life 2 Using the source engine.

1002
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:23,206
Speaker 0: Yes.

1003
00:56:23,426 --> 00:56:24,570
Speaker 0: How about left 4 dead?

1004
00:56:25,011 --> 00:56:27,600
Speaker 0: Is that a mod of half-life 2 which is using the source engine?

1005
00:56:28,362 --> 00:56:30,730
Speaker 0: Nope, but left 4 dead 2 is a sequel to left 4 dead 1.

1006
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,797
Speaker 0: Yep, but is it a mod or an expansion?

1007
00:56:32,817 --> 00:56:38,338
Speaker 0: Yep How can you know, there's a lot of confusion going on there.

1008
00:56:40,321 --> 00:56:48,459
Speaker 1: But this at least explains not to get off on a tangent that I was about to go off on Why I couldn't come up with an example of a mind-blowing expansion?

1009
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:55,238
Speaker 1: because anything that was ever mind-blowing always kind of fit into a separate category as like this is a totally different game.

1010
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,271
Speaker 1: or This is a crazy house rule.

1011
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:58,600
Speaker 1: It never was an expansion.

1012
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:03,920
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I think that nothing that's an expansion or at least is considered an expansion or even a mod.

1013
00:57:04,262 --> 00:57:06,637
Speaker 0: I guess mods can be mind-blowing but nothing.

1014
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:14,380
Speaker 0: that's Merely an expansion to be mind-blowing because not a significant portion of it will be original enough to blow your mind.

1015
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,011
Speaker 0: It's all it's you know, like if portal had an expansion of new levels.

1016
00:57:18,974 --> 00:57:20,780
Speaker 0: It's like portal was the mind-blowing thing.

1017
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,967
Speaker 0: What can you add to portal that will blow my mind?

1018
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:25,295
Speaker 0: portal blows the mind to portals?

1019
00:57:25,496 --> 00:57:28,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, okay great Thanks, daddy to PP.

1020
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:35,946
Speaker 0: You know in order to blow someone's mind It needs to be something that's new and fresh.

1021
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:41,428
Speaker 0: if it's something that they've seen before or that they're very familiar with you cannot blow The mind.

1022
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:42,160
Speaker 0: it's impossible.

1023
00:57:42,702 --> 00:57:50,211
Speaker 0: So nothing if any of it is if it is so dissimilar from the thing it is Expanding such as to blow the mind.

1024
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:51,960
Speaker 0: It would not be an expansion.

1025
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,619
Speaker 0: It would be a new game or a mod or something completely new.

1026
00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:00,520
Speaker 0: All right Like if I found some way to use a monopoly board and dice and pieces to make this amazing game.

1027
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:05,520
Speaker 0: It would be so dissimilar from monopoly that could you really call it a monopoly expansion?

1028
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,000
Speaker 0: No, it would be a mod or a new game entirely.

1029
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:15,580
Speaker 0: So, you know an expansion is pretty much just like you like something you but you didn't get enough of it or me?

1030
00:58:15,842 --> 00:58:16,347
Speaker 1: Well, there's three.

1031
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,560
Speaker 1: I think there's multiple categories.

1032
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:21,480
Speaker 1: An expansion is good if it gives you more of the same of something you already liked.

1033
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:28,556
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm if it fixes a problem with something that I think it's on see when they do that I mean it is an expansion.

1034
00:58:28,576 --> 00:58:35,540
Speaker 0: but Hot fix I think is bullshit that if they sell that as an expansion the game is broken and you're fixing it with your expansion.

1035
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:37,860
Speaker 0: No, no, no, the fix should be free if your game is fucking broken.

1036
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:43,557
Speaker 1: However, I've noticed a lot of games that like a not race for the galaxies, but cosmic encounters included this.

1037
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:53,395
Speaker 1: there's one Card that was controversial so it was removed in the re-release of the game But they included it with a note saying here's the old busted card.

1038
00:58:53,435 --> 00:58:56,273
Speaker 1: if you really want to play with it Yeah, well, why not know what the car does?

1039
00:58:56,353 --> 00:58:57,180
Speaker 0: it's one card.

1040
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,942
Speaker 1: It's the filch fair.

1041
00:58:58,002 --> 00:58:59,587
Speaker 1: won't flare while it's in your hand.

1042
00:59:00,109 --> 00:59:03,219
Speaker 1: You can just fucking cheat until someone calls you on it.

1043
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:05,780
Speaker 1: You can just like grab extra car.

1044
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:11,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, that definitely sounds like the kind of thing that would normally be in an expansion and not in the normal set.

1045
00:59:11,459 --> 00:59:18,868
Speaker 1: Yep That's pretty cool that it was in the normal set and not an expand or they can fix something that isn't necessarily a bug But kind of a like.

1046
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:28,479
Speaker 1: this game was good But there's a balance thing that if you fix this one thing would have been great Mmm, then I think it's okay to be an expansion because the game still was fun.

1047
00:59:28,881 --> 00:59:33,937
Speaker 1: But you wanted a little better and someone had a cuss a concise way of saying for five bucks.

1048
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:44,357
Speaker 0: Here's better Yeah, but here's an example right that the roll through the ages which is pretty good But basically it wasn't really that good, but they made a better score sheet.

1049
00:59:44,417 --> 00:59:45,863
Speaker 0: that's free online But it's like fuck.

1050
00:59:45,903 --> 00:59:48,839
Speaker 0: I just bought this pad of score sheets, but it's free.

1051
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:49,762
Speaker 0: It is free.

1052
00:59:49,782 --> 00:59:54,737
Speaker 0: if they charge you five bucks to download the PDF that we bullshit would be but they don't which is cool.

1053
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:58,990
Speaker 1: Yeah They probably wanted to ship the game faster or something.

1054
00:59:59,030 --> 01:00:12,220
Speaker 0: I don't know, you know, and sometimes you know People are taking things that would have been a mod or expansion and you know Or but or would have been part of the game and splitting it off on purpose and sometimes they're not and it's like you got.

1055
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,836
Speaker 0: I guess call them as they lie.

1056
01:00:13,856 --> 01:00:21,980
Speaker 1: Yep I mean if something is a Carcassonne catapult you should Point out that it is a Carcassonne catapult and don't actually play it, you know?

1057
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,141
Speaker 0: Like.

1058
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:25,880
Speaker 0: take for example, like it like a Street Fighter 4 right this tournament mode.

1059
01:00:26,001 --> 01:00:27,758
Speaker 0: It was a downloadable content But it was free.

1060
01:00:28,402 --> 01:00:31,372
Speaker 0: Right because that is something that should have been included in the game.

1061
01:00:31,814 --> 01:00:34,488
Speaker 0: if they try to charge money for tournament mode Fuck that shit.

1062
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:39,412
Speaker 0: Fuck them up the ass Right, but they didn't but say Madden they would totally.

1063
01:00:39,432 --> 01:00:41,700
Speaker 0: if it was Madden they would have charged you for tournament mode.

1064
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,283
Speaker 0: You know, they would.

1065
01:00:42,363 --> 01:00:43,348
Speaker 0: yeah, they would have those jerks.

1066
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:44,835
Speaker 0: All right, you know how they roll.

1067
01:00:44,855 --> 01:00:49,290
Speaker 0: so You know, it's some things should be included something shouldn't.

1068
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:51,477
Speaker 0: and you know, everyone's just trying to make monies.

1069
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:52,260
Speaker 0: So fuck them.

1070
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:55,166
Speaker 1: So but there is like I said, there's three.

1071
01:00:55,186 --> 01:00:57,634
Speaker 1: there's one final point where an expansion is very good.

1072
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,059
Speaker 1: All right inside your mom.

1073
01:01:06,261 --> 01:01:08,508

Speaker 0: There's a vuvuzela and the Goes into.

1086
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:17,949

1087
01:02:18,611 --> 01:02:19,996

Speaker 1: So I got it.

1089
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,484
Speaker 1: I'll make a MIDI vuvuzela.

1090
01:02:22,966 --> 01:02:24,090
Speaker 1: I only need to support one note.

1091
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:27,549
Speaker 0: Why don't we just have like the megaphone on top of the microphone?

1092
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,080
Speaker 0: So you're talking into a megaphone that goes into the microphone.
