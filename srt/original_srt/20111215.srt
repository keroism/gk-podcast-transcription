1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,378
Speaker 0: It's Thursday December 15th 2011.

2
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:12,900
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,550
Speaker 0: there's no Scott because he's a bum and this is geek night.

4
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:20,089
Speaker 0: Tonight I talked a little bit about how I do the show.

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,256
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:28,771
Speaker 0: Funny it almost sounded like Scott was here with me.

7
00:00:28,792 --> 00:00:32,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're kind of lazy as the holidays You're lucky there's any show up at all.

8
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,878
Speaker 0: We were just gonna bail but we decided I don't know.

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,020
Speaker 0: It's been a while long long time ago.

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,340
Speaker 0: We used to talk a lot more about what it is We do from the technical side like how we make podcasts how we do like it's now videos and the servers and everything.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,360
Speaker 0: But Scott was lazy and I was actually feeling like doing something.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,575
Speaker 0: So I decided to do the show by myself a little quickie here.

13
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:50,320
Speaker 0: geek night special.

14
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:53,220
Speaker 0: So the way we record geek nights has come a long way.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,012
Speaker 0: We've gone through like four different mixers and all these different microphones.

16
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,099
Speaker 0: It started way back before any of you listened.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,820
Speaker 0: In fact We never put these episodes publicly on the internet anywhere that you would find them.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
Speaker 0: They're out there still but I believe the Google juice is actually at zero.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,268
Speaker 0: I believe there is in fact no way to find the links to these mp3s, but Logitech stick mic was literally across the room.

20
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:18,480
Speaker 0: That was my idea of a compressor at the time.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,024
Speaker 0: I would just have the stick microphone the omni microphone sitting across the room plugged into my sound blaster 16.

22
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:35,077
Speaker 0: I mean technically it was a sound blaster live But there wasn't any substantial difference between that and the 16 at least as far as what I was doing And we were just kind of talk and see how it went.

23
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:38,269
Speaker 0: It was awful But now we're a little more sophisticated.

24
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:48,877
Speaker 0: I pretty much have maxed out the equipment I'm ever willing to spend on geek nights the podcast or radio show Partly because there's no reason to improve the technology.

25
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:49,680
Speaker 0: I think it sounds fine.

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,595
Speaker 0: I don't think any of you will complain about the audio though if you want to now is the time.

27
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:55,965
Speaker 0: I will preface this However with one final warning.

28
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,992
Speaker 0: This is not a typical episode of geek nights.

29
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,900
Speaker 0: There's usually another guy here.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:11,717
Speaker 0: So if you've randomly from the bowels of the internet or my little pony or whatever happened to stumble upon the show and it happened to be this episode that you decided to pick up and Listen to us talking on the internet the rest of the show is not really like this.

31
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:14,199
Speaker 0: It's actually quite different.

32
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:24,249
Speaker 0: So the microphones we used to use for the longest time the Shure SM57s which are actually Technically instrument microphones as most people use them.

33
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,031
Speaker 0: it so happens that the President of the United States uses them and has used them for Basically forever.

34
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:30,020
Speaker 0: they're an ancient microphone.

35
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:40,238
Speaker 0: The SM57 and the SM58 are pretty much functionally identical except at the 58 with a little ball on the front has some Wind suppression and a little bit of pop suppression built into it.

36
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:50,200
Speaker 0: The 57 was chosen by the president not because it was better acoustically But because it looked better on camera and the windscreen that you could buy for it was actually very sleek looking.

37
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:51,940
Speaker 0: We do have one of those windscreens.

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,717
Speaker 0: You might see it in some of our very old videos that actually probably aren't on the internet anywhere.

39
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:59,326
Speaker 0: You'd find them But we've upgraded a little bit.

40
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:00,150
Speaker 0: I still use those.

41
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,074
Speaker 0: however the 57s are invincible.

42
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:05,040
Speaker 0: I'll probably have them long after I'm dead.

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:18,120
Speaker 0: I'll stick them in my coffin, but whenever we have guests on the show like Emily or Jared or Luke Crane or something We we give them Those with or without pop filters depending on who the person is and depending on how much microphone discipline and plosiveness they have.

44
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,559
Speaker 0: I however am very fancy.

45
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,840
Speaker 0: now I'm speaking into a Shure Beta 87A which is one it requires phantom power.

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,820
Speaker 0: It's a condenser mic and two unlike the 57s which are cardioids.

47
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:32,566
Speaker 0: It's a hyper cardioid.

48
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,131
Speaker 0: you can look up what that means.

49
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:39,640
Speaker 0: so basically it's ultra directional though There are a couple of drawbacks that don't really matter for our purposes.

50
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:44,379
Speaker 0: It mostly helps me drown out the echoes of me in Scott's microphone and vice versa.

51
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:53,270
Speaker 0: Scott however does not have the Beta 87A because he is a Cheapskate and he refused to pay for half of another 87A.

52
00:03:53,832 --> 00:03:54,273
Speaker 0: so instead.

53
00:03:54,313 --> 00:04:01,012
Speaker 0: I got him the Beta 58A which is kind of like the Reimagining of the SM 58. it's also a condenser.

54
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:01,715
Speaker 0: It's got the ball.

55
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:02,940
Speaker 0: It's a great microphone.

56
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:06,173
Speaker 0: The only difference is that it's not a hyper cardioid like the one I use.

57
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:08,000
Speaker 0: so this presents a problem.

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,111
Speaker 0: Sometimes you might notice that when we do video like Radio Free Equestria.

59
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:12,777
Speaker 0: We still use the old SM 57s.

60
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:22,005
Speaker 0: That's because if I'm recording Actual stereo or anything where I'm gonna keep the mix in any sort of stereo configuration It's a billion times easier.

61
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:25,940
Speaker 0: if both microphones are exactly the same and have the same profile the same gain everything.

62
00:04:26,522 --> 00:04:31,517
Speaker 0: I also can't really do the XY stereo technique if the microphones are different for obvious reasons at least.

63
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:32,260
Speaker 0: I hope they're obvious.

64
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:42,689
Speaker 0: So the microphones are on booms, and they're connected to my mixer which currently is a pretty old xenix Xenix makes kind of shitty equipment.

65
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,355
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna pretend otherwise.

66
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,880
Speaker 0: the preamps in this thing are not great.

67
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:50,022
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of problems all over but for a show like this It's fine.

68
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:56,060
Speaker 0: the difference between this and a so-called real pre-amplified system or a real mixer are negligible.

69
00:04:56,161 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 0: you would never hear it especially the quality of mp3 we put out and It has six actual Pre-amplified microphone inputs and coupled with the fire studio and all the other inputs there I could mic up about 12 people and I could record at least nine of them Simultaneously, you know all multitrack and such, but the mixer I set up very particularly a long time ago.

70
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:51,200
Speaker 0: it took about a month of tweaking every day with the show and shouting into microphones and getting gain profiles and figuring out the optimal configuration and I've marked it up with all the Settings and what every channel is and what they're for and you know the buttons to hit for the sub mixes if I'm gonna use Skype or anything and I have not actually touched any of those settings In at least two years short of the occasional time when we have someone on the show in the studio And I need to change the gain on whatever port I've plugged their particular microphone into.

71
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:59,740
Speaker 0: But suffice it to say if you want to do radio or audio or podcasting of any kind It's worth the trivial extra amount of money to get a real mixer.

72
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:06,600
Speaker 0: Once you have multiple buses to use you will and inserts you will never understand how you did anything without those things.

73
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:15,838
Speaker 0: For example, we can just Skype someone in Trivially because I can send the audio from me and Scott directly to the fire studio where I record.

74
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:17,468
Speaker 0: so, you know You get pristine audio.

75
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:21,540
Speaker 0: I simultaneously Send it to the bus that's connected to the other sound card.

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,363
Speaker 0: That's going to Skype.

77
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:27,000
Speaker 0: the audio coming back from Skype goes into the mixer and goes into my main recording rig.

78
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:28,453
Speaker 0: But there's no like.

79
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:29,160
Speaker 0: there's no overlap.

80
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:40,113
Speaker 0: So I have a Skype channel a rim channel a Scott channel and I can still have channels for every other individual person here And I could actually have multiple skype's or other sources all plugged in simultaneously.

81
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:41,536
Speaker 0: now very important.

82
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:47,611
Speaker 0: I have a pretty old Samson s comm stereo compressor just a two channel compressor.

83
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,035
Speaker 0: I don't have it in linked mode.

84
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,346
Speaker 0: So it's basically two Bono compressors.

85
00:06:52,828 --> 00:06:58,569
Speaker 0: It also actually has an expander gate on it, which I use as an expander Without getting into the details.

86
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,860
Speaker 0: It reduces the crosstalk between me and Scott while around the show.

87
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,215
Speaker 0: It kind of acts as a very subtle noise gate and that's actually very important Especially with the high amount of compression that I apply to geek nights.

88
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:24,360
Speaker 0: later now I'd experimented a bunch when I got a new Firewire recording thing with taking the s comm out and recording directly because you know with the high bit rates I record at I actually have a lot of headroom even if there's no pre record compression.

89
00:07:25,082 --> 00:07:44,600
Speaker 0: But all the experimentation done while I got a slightly richer sound if I bypass the somewhat old and somewhat cheap compressor The benefits of having compression applied pre record in terms of just the leeway I have with the signal after the fact There was no legitimate reason to in any way consider trying to do all that in post.

90
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,068
Speaker 0: So the compressor has been said.

91
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:52,460
Speaker 0: I haven't touched any dial on that thing Pretty much since I bought the new microphones and I'm just gonna leave it there.

92
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:57,300
Speaker 0: For those of you don't know what I mean by an insert basically the audio that I'm speaking.

93
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:58,819
Speaker 0: I'm talking to a microphone right now.

94
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:10,840
Speaker 0: So cable goes around the room goes into the one of the microphone channels goes to a pre amplifier Which has I can set the gain on the preamp which is independent of the gain on the fader Which is kind of like the volume control for the channel.

95
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,600
Speaker 0: The insert is between the fader and the preamp.

96
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,069
Speaker 0: So the signal is amplified up to line level with the preamp and then it goes out to the compressor Which is actually above me.

97
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:27,699
Speaker 0: I'm looking at it right now So I can see all the different, you know How much compression is being applied at any given second and how long how loud the signal is there?

98
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,407
Speaker 0: Compared to the signal on say the mixer or in the recording or all these other places I have all these points.

99
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,359
Speaker 0: where I can see the signal is that traverses my system.

100
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,866
Speaker 0: So it goes through the compressor which I've set.

101
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:41,120
Speaker 0: me and Scott have two different sets of settings that I wrote down in a notebook.

102
00:08:41,363 --> 00:09:04,980
Speaker 0: I don't know where that notebook is but I also have pencil markings on the compressor in case anyone ever fucks with it and then it goes back to And from there I can move the volume and That's actually very important because that means that the compressors settings are always the same relative to the loudness of the bass audio Independent of where I move the volume slider.

103
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:11,638
Speaker 0: So if I need to make myself quieter or I'm recording, you know We have someone other than Scott on the show and I have to change the volume of that person.

104
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:14,872
Speaker 0: Absolutely I don't have to also change the compression settings.

105
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,460
Speaker 0: The compression is the same no matter what.

106
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:21,120
Speaker 0: I'm just changing the volume of the kind of total signal at the end of that one channel.

107
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,231
Speaker 0: So all this happens the compression everything.

108
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,120
Speaker 0: it comes out of my mixer and it goes to two places.

109
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:27,885
Speaker 0: It could go to more places.

110
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:30,252
Speaker 0: I have two other things connected to this.

111
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,877
Speaker 0: I'll get to in a second one.

112
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:37,189
Speaker 0: I have a Relatively new firewire device that I use for recording.

113
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,498
Speaker 0: It's actually a fire studio mobile from Presonus.

114
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,140
Speaker 0: It's not great.

115
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:42,928
Speaker 0: The it has a lot of problems.

116
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:51,023
Speaker 0: I won't get into because you probably don't care but I Would not recommend using it for any ultra important or professional Recording.

117
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:55,460
Speaker 0: it actually introduces a surprising amount of noise and has some preamps and some microphone inputs.

118
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,910
Speaker 0: I don't use them because they're kind of flat sounding.

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:08,827
Speaker 0: I actually like the preamps on the Zenix better and Most importantly the headphone jack is actually completely janky and the right channel is absolutely Louder than the left channel.

120
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:13,793
Speaker 0: I didn't notice that until it was too late to exchange the thing And I have a feeling that it's a systemic flaw.

121
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:14,899
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna worry about it though.

122
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,618
Speaker 0: So anyway, I you know, it can record all these channels.

123
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:29,960
Speaker 0: So Each channel of someone talking some microphone input or some other input Maybe I'm you know Adding sounds to the show or I'm bootlegging some audio out of Spotify or something through a sound card through the mixer back into the computer.

124
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:34,653
Speaker 0: But however, I do it each channel comes into audition as its own channel.

125
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,220
Speaker 0: The fire studio can do eight channels just into it.

126
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:37,827
Speaker 0: They're all synced.

127
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,430
Speaker 0: Everything's nice Which means I have a lot of flexibility.

128
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:48,167
Speaker 0: editing and if you're gonna ever Edit audio with more than one person talking you want to get to the point to where everyone's on their own channel as soon As possible.

129
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:49,118
Speaker 0: you'll never look back.

130
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:50,786
Speaker 0: But that's the main mix.

131
00:10:50,806 --> 00:11:01,847
Speaker 0: that's what I'm recording and my headphones plug into that just so I can hear exactly What I'm recording while I'm recording though I actually don't wear headphones that often anymore when we record because you know Like I said, we don't change the settings much.

132
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:05,520
Speaker 0: It's not like me or Scott is gonna sound different on any particular day.

133
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,864
Speaker 0: It's not like I have to master anything again But I also.

134
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 0: the audio is piped to a Marantz that we've got the PMD 660 which I don't think they manufacture anymore.

135
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:21,380
Speaker 0: I highly recommend this device over all other solid-state portable recorders every piece of remote audio you've ever heard.

136
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,145
Speaker 0: We do us do you know?

137
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:28,540
Speaker 0: anytime we're interviewing people at conventions or there's video and there's audio associated with that video.

138
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:33,100
Speaker 0: We always record it on the Marantz, but I didn't want to buy a Marantz just for that.

139
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,580
Speaker 0: It was pretty pricey, especially back before I was a Wall Street, dude.

140
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:45,583
Speaker 0: So the Marantz is always on battery power and always plugged into the mixer and it's always Recording every second of audio that happens in the studio whenever anything's plugged in.

141
00:11:45,603 --> 00:11:47,410
Speaker 0: if I turn anything on is it record on the Marantz.

142
00:11:47,811 --> 00:12:01,560
Speaker 0: it can record some ungodly number of days of audio if I need it to and That way if there's ever a power outage or something happens Maybe you know, I accidentally derp it and delete the file on audition or I get the computer crashes.

143
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:12,184
Speaker 0: I've always got another copy of the audio we've lost maybe I don't know four episodes of geek nights ever due to mistakes and the most recent one was sadly because while I Had the Marantz.

144
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:17,619
Speaker 0: it was packed in a suitcase for a convention and I was too lazy to go get it out and plug it back into the rig.

145
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,680
Speaker 0: and That happened to be the day that audition crashed and fucked me.

146
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:30,180
Speaker 0: So on various buses or auxiliary one on the aux sends and then I have another one on a sub bus I have two kind of crappy old Behringer.

147
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,950
Speaker 0: You control USB sound cards and I use those for Skype or you know Connecting you to another computer.

148
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:43,860
Speaker 0: or if I have to like for example If I'm doing a streaming video or streaming audio of the show I use that other sound card to do the stream independent of whatever I'm recording.

149
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:57,539
Speaker 0: Now all these devices get the same final mix so they get the exact same thing that's going into The computer for recording with the exception that if there's more than two channels It all gets kind of mixed together into one or two channels, depending on how I've set it up.

150
00:12:58,566 --> 00:13:05,180
Speaker 0: so everything goes into audition and You know, I would have balked and some of you might balk at paying for Adobe Audition when there's two.

151
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:17,851
Speaker 0: you know free tools like resound or audacity, but frankly I for the for most of my life been messing around with audio and I've always used either cool edit or cool edit pro or Cakewalk or some relatively good piece of software.

152
00:13:18,514 --> 00:13:24,156
Speaker 0: and I have to say that resound Has all of the fiddly tools that I require to do audio mastering.

153
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:25,140
Speaker 0: it has good compressors.

154
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:26,660
Speaker 0: You can do really complex stuff.

155
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,400
Speaker 0: You have to really know what you're doing and you have to have a neckbeard to be able to get the fucking thing to work.

156
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:41,511
Speaker 0: But it's really the only open source editing software that is worth a shit if you actually want to edit and master Anything even reasonably professional sounding.

157
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:43,240
Speaker 0: now you might say oh audacity.

158
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:44,084
Speaker 0: I use it and you know what.

159
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:46,175
Speaker 0: audacity is fine for recording in a pinch.

160
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,080
Speaker 0: I'll use audacity.

161
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:54,060
Speaker 0: It's installed on all my laptops and things and for the longest time I'd actually record an audacity because it wasn't going to crash on me like resound would.

162
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,436
Speaker 0: But then I'd export everything into resound and do the mastering there way back in the day.

163
00:13:58,496 --> 00:13:59,560
Speaker 0: and we recorded this on Linux.

164
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:04,511
Speaker 0: but Audacity's compressors and tools and mastering stuff.

165
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,680
Speaker 0: It's like baby's first audio software.

166
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:10,735
Speaker 0: It's in my opinion utterly unusable for any reasonable editing.

167
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:15,720
Speaker 0: even of just two guys talking I could not make a compressor set up to do what I wanted to do.

168
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,511
Speaker 0: It just didn't work and while resound could do it was a pain in the ass.

169
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:34,259
Speaker 0: So while audition costs a lot of money It's absolutely worth it though I don't think it'll ever be worth it to upgrade beyond 3.0 because 3.0 has everything you'll ever need Unless you want to do surround sound for a movie, but that's not what I'm doing here.

170
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:47,854
Speaker 0: So I have a template project in audition that has all of our stock sounds, you know, me and Scott saying let's do this The little interstitial music between the different bits a couple of commonly used effects and stingers and things that I throw in every now and then.

171
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:54,020
Speaker 0: and Most importantly it has the presets for you know, the audio that we actually you know, the mastering.

172
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:59,258
Speaker 0: It's not like I sit here and set up a compressor every time we record geek nights on each channel.

173
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,769
Speaker 0: for me and Scott I have a noise gate in addition to the noise gate.

174
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,080
Speaker 0: I got on the compressor and some mastering.

175
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,800
Speaker 0: You know, I raise the highs lower the lows tweak a little thing here or there.

176
00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:10,451
Speaker 0: I remove the most annoying like sliver.

177
00:15:10,532 --> 00:15:12,460
Speaker 0: I have a notch filter for me and a notch filter for Scott.

178
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:16,019
Speaker 0: I found the most annoying frequency in both of our voices and minimize them a little bit.

179
00:15:16,863 --> 00:15:24,300
Speaker 0: I spent at least two months kind of perfecting these and I'm kind of getting to the point where I want to change them around a little bit again.

180
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:31,280
Speaker 0: but I actually don't say any reason to right now, but Imagine, you know Scott had to deal with this when we live together in Beacon.

181
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:48,386
Speaker 0: He just hears me in the other room saying testing one, two, three testing one, two, three testing one, two three, four, five and then I just listen to this in a loop while in real time applying different compression effects and different mastering effects until I got Each channel just so.

182
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:53,688
Speaker 0: and then I take audio from people we'd interviewed in the past and I try to make a generic One.

183
00:15:53,810 --> 00:16:12,720
Speaker 0: for you know Whenever we get someone on the show to at least give me a baseline to get started on though I will admit whenever we have someone other than me or Scott on the show I actually end up having to master their audio channel extremely heavily to make it sound like both of us Partly because they don't swallow the microphone like we do and also partly because their voice is usually really annoying sounding.

184
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,980
Speaker 0: But actually I don't do that much in terms of mastering.

185
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:25,460
Speaker 0: I mean the mastering itself like the frequency up or down and all these little bits I do and a little bit of expansion a Little bit of compression is very fiddly and it's just you got to figure it out.

186
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:33,965
Speaker 0: There's no advice I can give you on that other than do what sounds good And if you don't know what to do look at what someone else did copy it and then figure out what you don't like about It and tweak it from there.

187
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,699
Speaker 0: and then at the end of the whole thing the main mix I just put a compressor at the top.

188
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:42,740
Speaker 0: I try to maximize Myself and maximize Scott and maximize anyone on the show as much as possible.

189
00:16:43,423 --> 00:16:47,720
Speaker 0: And then I have a pretty harsh compressor at the very end in case we both talk at the same time.

190
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: It actually doesn't happen often enough for it to matter.

191
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:58,725
Speaker 0: but if you listen closely whenever me and Scott are both yelling at the same time is a really harsh compressor that comes in and Occasionally will clip.

192
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:03,420
Speaker 0: I decided to let the risk of occasional clipping be there just to maximize the audio.

193
00:17:04,262 --> 00:17:14,680
Speaker 0: So to actually record we just sit down, you know We do the show and I get this audio at the end and you might be wondering but rim You didn't say much about editing and that's because we don't edit geek nights.

194
00:17:15,222 --> 00:17:21,200
Speaker 0: We haven't edited geek nights to any substantial degree for at least three years and partly that just came out of practice.

195
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:33,100
Speaker 0: but we sit down, you know, we argue for a while about what the show is gonna be on and then we record, you know, the It's date year whatever I'm rim Scott says I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

196
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:43,425
Speaker 0: We talk about whatever it is We're talking about and then we stop and then we you know Look at our news make sure we got all our stuff together and then we record the whole first half of the show in just one Take at best.

197
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:48,740
Speaker 0: I'll cut off maybe like maybe we stop talking about what we're talking about and we go on a little longer.

198
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,095
Speaker 0: I might cut us off a little early when I'm you know quote editing at the end But otherwise, I'd never don't even listen to what we did.

199
00:17:55,135 --> 00:18:01,867
Speaker 0: We just put it up And then we record the second half of the show so pretty much the meta moment through the entire rest of the show.

200
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,082
Speaker 0: things the day everything all in one go and That's it.

201
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,453
Speaker 0: Then, you know when we're very when we're all done.

202
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:11,499
Speaker 0: I just dragged the Interstitial audio in and all the places it needs to be in.

203
00:18:12,284 --> 00:18:18,400
Speaker 0: I actually used to in the old days have a Saw a little bit of a script that would in resound do that automatically.

204
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:44,660
Speaker 0: It would take all those waves that we recorded and it would put all the pieces in the right places based on Percentage of audio that remained in the wave Versus how much time I needed at the beginning of the fade-in and the fade-out and it would basically construct an entire episode of geek nights Automatically in fact, it was even a batch to where we could record a whole bunch of individual bits And I could just hit go and then at the end out would come like three complete geek nights episodes ready to rock.

205
00:18:45,183 --> 00:18:50,799
Speaker 0: But I dragged these waves around and then I just you know Export the thing to a wave and that takes about five to fifteen minutes.

206
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:52,429
Speaker 0: Depends if I add some filters.

207
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,059
Speaker 0: if we have a guest on there's more audio.

208
00:18:54,685 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 0: If it's a really long episode, it might take longer.

209
00:18:56,661 --> 00:19:01,340
Speaker 0: I usually play counter-stark or something until it's done and then I upload it and we're done.

210
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,891
Speaker 0: We never listen to the episode again.

211
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:03,980
Speaker 0: We never think about it again.

212
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,633
Speaker 0: I put it on the website put the news thing of the day all that stuff.

213
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:07,678
Speaker 0: and that's it.

214
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:16,538
Speaker 0: I dump a copy of the mp3 and a copy of the wave onto my NAS just for posterity and All told the process is actually pretty simple at this point.

215
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:20,279
Speaker 0: So I'd considered talking about how we do video too.

216
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,700
Speaker 0: But there's not that much to say and we're actually changing our process constantly as I learn more about making video.

217
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:32,506
Speaker 0: So I'll give you the very quick version and then we'll call it a night because the whole reason we didn't do a real show Is that we both wanted to bail.

218
00:19:32,526 --> 00:19:41,614
Speaker 0: it wasn't just got but I have a Panasonic HTC HS 700 Which I would argue is one of the best Prosumer level HD cameras on the market.

219
00:19:41,634 --> 00:19:42,539
Speaker 0: It's got a hard drive in it.

220
00:19:42,921 --> 00:19:45,675
Speaker 0: It'll record some ungodly amount of video and audio.

221
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:47,820
Speaker 0: it records 5.1.

222
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,760
Speaker 0: Okay audio but I always like I said use the Marantz to get the actual audio and then I sync it up after the fact.

223
00:19:53,543 --> 00:20:03,557
Speaker 0: The biggest thing is it records in 1080p 60 frames per second Which means the video looks utterly fantastic, especially if I light everything right now.

224
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,480
Speaker 0: I do have two more cameras.

225
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:06,253
Speaker 0: I have an old flip camera that records 720p.

226
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:08,545
Speaker 0: It's not great.

227
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:09,930
Speaker 0: It has a lot of problems.

228
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,479
Speaker 0: the files that puts out actually are not standard mp4.

229
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,049
Speaker 0: so I got a basically transcode them to fix some timing artifacts.

230
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:24,953
Speaker 0: and If we really need a third camera angle, I have a Microsoft life cam that actually serves that purpose pretty well.

231
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:32,120
Speaker 0: and Between those three things I pretty much just stick around throw video together slap some audio on it and throw it up.

232
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:50,713
Speaker 0: I actually don't do Anything particularly special when it comes to video like when you see us doing a convention stuff camera on a tripod Just kind of pointed at us There's usually I don't even have multiple camera angles I just fake it by you know zooming in and out in Post into the one camera angle just to kind of make the video a little dynamic.

233
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:56,844
Speaker 0: for more structured things like radio free equestria I just have a couple of best score Really cheap.

234
00:20:56,905 --> 00:21:04,400
Speaker 0: They were like a hundred bucks each LED light panels that give off a really harsh really cold blue light.

235
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:08,540
Speaker 0: So I use those and then I have a big like halogen torsion living room lamp.

236
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,420
Speaker 0: That's bright enough to actually be my fill light and it happens to have a reading light on it.

237
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,183
Speaker 0: That's also halogen and that reading light happens to be pointable like a spot and the spot happens to have a really good white balance And provide great color.

238
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:26,564
Speaker 0: so between those and a little reflector for kind of a rim light on the back get it rim light That's it.

239
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:30,160
Speaker 0: We kind of just throw it together and do it that we put very little thought into it.

240
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:39,060
Speaker 0: I have a couple of like audio panels just out of frame behind us to cut down on the echo because everything's hardwood in our apartment and There's not much to say in terms of video.

241
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,220
Speaker 0: I just drag clips around and from here hit export and put it up with very little thought and very little consideration.

242
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:49,159
Speaker 0: Almost no mastering and I haven't actually tried to do any compositing yet.

243
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:52,692
Speaker 0: And on that note, I think I'm done.

244
00:21:53,154 --> 00:21:54,180
Speaker 0: I kind of want to go to bed.

245
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,069
Speaker 0: I can't believe you actually listen to this whole thing.

246
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,299
Speaker 0: And if you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

247
00:21:58,601 --> 00:21:59,143
Speaker 0: It's very rare.

248
00:21:59,183 --> 00:22:01,634
Speaker 0: We talk about you know, how we do this stuff on the back end anymore.

249
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:06,955
Speaker 0: I Will not help you with audio mastering because really you just have to learn it on your own.

250
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:37,697
Speaker 0: if you really want to learn it Quickly try to make a bunch of mixtapes try to take a bunch of songs and crossfade them all together and make it all sound great and try to do it as fast as possible and then start listening to those songs and listen to the mixtape over and Over and over again and try to figure out like, you know sit there listening to songs and looking at an equalizer and pick each channel one by one and Maximize it and try to figure out what stuff is in that channel and then minimize it and try to figure out what stuff was in the channel you didn't realize was in there before.

251
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:59,860
Speaker 0: and Eventually, you'll learn that every kind of like every part of a graphic equalizer is a magic device that will make parts of your audio Appear or disappear and it's usually very specific things like there's certain particular ranges that sound really annoying and almost any person speaking or There's a particular part that makes audio sound really like loud and overbearing.

252
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:05,040
Speaker 0: There's a part you can raise a little bit that makes audio especially voice sound really crisp and really clear.

253
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:12,993
Speaker 0: Almost too crisp and too clear and if you use that too much You'll find that the audio actually becomes hard to listen to.

254
00:23:13,074 --> 00:23:16,289
Speaker 0: people get tired listening to it Even though they couldn't really tell you why.

255
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,100
Speaker 0: so there's no way to teach it.

256
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,434
Speaker 0: Just fiddle with it or wait until we have AI that does it and hopefully next week.

257
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:24,000
