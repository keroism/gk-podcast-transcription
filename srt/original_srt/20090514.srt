1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,024
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 14th.

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:11,685
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:12,246
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:13,730
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,360
Speaker 1: Tonight, the book club of the amazing adventures of Cavalier and Clay.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:32,537
Speaker 0: I was hankering for a big lunch today.

8
00:00:32,557 --> 00:00:33,461
Speaker 0: I was feeling it.

9
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,650
Speaker 0: So I went out and I went over to Chipotle.

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,632
Speaker 1: Chipotle?

11
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:37,455
Speaker 1: That's a good shirt.

12
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:37,997
Speaker 1: You know what?

13
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:41,310
Speaker 1: Right next to my work, there is a big ass Chipotle.

14
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:41,955
Speaker 0: You know what?

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,650
Speaker 1: It is the biggest Chipotle I've ever seen.

16
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,333
Speaker 0: You know what?

17
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:46,408
Speaker 0: I normally, I would go to eat at the Chipotle on 42nd Street.

18
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:49,357
Speaker 0: In that Chipotle, there's a long line.

19
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:54,410
Speaker 0: If you get there after 1130 and before like 2, you have to wait for like a half hour to get to Chipotle.

20
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,270
Speaker 1: That's Chipotle typical.

21
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:02,969
Speaker 0: So they have a sign up now saying, "You know, we built another Chipotle that's bigger right around the corner and there's maps and

22
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,470
Speaker 0: everything.".

23
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,729
Speaker 1: How around the corner is it?

24
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,755
Speaker 0: It's like right there.

25
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,629
Speaker 0: It's like a block and a half away.

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:07,955
Speaker 1: Oh wow.

27
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:08,469
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:08,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

29
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:10,665
Speaker 0: So I walked over there just as crowded.

30
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:11,169
Speaker 0: God damn it.

31
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:17,210
Speaker 1: The one near me is really big and it's only super crowded during a certain, you know, similar time interval.

32
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:17,874
Speaker 1: But you know what?

33
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:20,290
Speaker 1: You want to know the Chipotle secret?

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,630
Speaker 0: That's the secret.

35
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,250
Speaker 1: You can just fax slash digitally send in your orders and then go get them.

36
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,030
Speaker 0: All the ones I've been to, if you walk in and you're going to pay with credit, because apparently no one pays with credit but me.

37
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,630
Speaker 0: They have a guy with like a thing around his neck that can take credit card orders.

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,610
Speaker 1: They do that at the Apple store when it's crowded also.

39
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,209
Speaker 1: They'll have, they'll just get the people who usually walk around and say, "How may I help

40
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:42,329
Speaker 1: you?".

41
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:46,387
Speaker 1: And they give them handheld credit card thingies and they'll be like, "Paying with credit?

42
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:46,969
Speaker 1: Just come over to

43
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:47,090
Speaker 1: me.".

44
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,050
Speaker 1: And they scan and then slide your card and they type in the numbers and that's it.

45
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:57,090
Speaker 0: I remember I was standing at this Chipotle and there were like 100, not really 100, there were like 30 people in line.

46
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,724
Speaker 1: That's a pretty big, I usually have seen like 20.

47
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:00,830
Speaker 1: I've never seen like 30.

48
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,020
Speaker 0: And the guy comes out and he's like, "Who's paying with credit?

49
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,085
Speaker 0: I'll take your order right now.

50
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:04,387
Speaker 0: You'll be

51
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:04,648
Speaker 0: done.".

52
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,708
Speaker 0: No one stepped up.

53
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,117
Speaker 0: Wow.

54
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:11,884
Speaker 0: So I was at the end of the line, so I was like, "All right, here's the credit card for my $8

55
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:12,065
Speaker 0: burrito.".

56
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,569
Speaker 1: Did they, if you're at the end of the line though, how did you get your order up there?

57
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,546
Speaker 1: Because you got to go through the little line to talk to the people and say, "I want a fajita burrito with...".

58
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,456
Speaker 0: Because no one else did it.

59
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:26,103
Speaker 0: The guy swiped me and he stood there for a minute.

60
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:27,329
Speaker 0: He was like, "All

61
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:27,529
Speaker 0: right.".

62
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,429
Speaker 0: And then he put the thing down, went back, made my burrito and handed it to me.

63
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:31,952
Speaker 0: Ah.

64
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,730
Speaker 0: It was, it was badass.

65
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,440
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about, I was actually thinking I would go there tomorrow.

66
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:39,210
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to digitally send in my order.

67
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,049
Speaker 1: I'm going to attempt that method.

68
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:48,070
Speaker 0: See, normally I avoid the Chipotle during, because you know, eating a thousand calories for lunch on like a Tuesday is not good for rim.

69
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,190
Speaker 0: Because rim's asleep by 3.30.

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,910
Speaker 1: The thing is I'm not eating any breakfast tomorrow, so it's going to be pretty awesome.

71
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,174
Speaker 0: I was just hungry all day.

72
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:59,570
Speaker 0: Like I had a decent dinner and then in the morning I got like one of those hot and crusty bagels.

73
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,536
Speaker 1: What I ate today was so strange, right?

74
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:06,530
Speaker 1: So I get to work and we're going to BK to talk to some people over there, right?

75
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:11,563
Speaker 1: So, you know, we get on the subway, F train, we get off, right?

76
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,369
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Man, I fucking got to eat

77
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:13,810
Speaker 1: something.".

78
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:16,550
Speaker 1: So I just buy a glazed donut from a cart, right?

79
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:18,142
Speaker 0: Ah, the cart glazed donut.

80
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:18,949
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure...

81
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,249
Speaker 1: It was a pretty good cart glazed donut.

82
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,430
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the cart glazed donuts are identical to pretty almost every donut in the city, except for Dunkin' Donuts.

83
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:26,152
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

84
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,055
Speaker 1: So anyway, it was alright.

85
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:27,537
Speaker 1: I ate it.

86
00:03:27,978 --> 00:03:32,130
Speaker 1: The lady in front of me was really bitching that the orange juice was like $2.

87
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,740
Speaker 1: She was like, "Oh, God damn.

88
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,866
Speaker 1: You lucky I'm

89
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:35,268
Speaker 1: thirsty.".

90
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,177
Speaker 0: You know what, lady?

91
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,410
Speaker 0: Don't go near Grand Central.

92
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,252
Speaker 1: I know, right?

93
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:41,002
Speaker 1: So it was actually a tiny shitty orange juice.

94
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,390
Speaker 1: Grand Central, you get the nice carton one that's actually better.

95
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,114
Speaker 0: No, forget that.

96
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:45,021
Speaker 0: You want the good orange juice.

97
00:03:45,042 --> 00:03:46,070
Speaker 0: You want to know the secret in Grand Central.

98
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,770
Speaker 1: Go to the grocery store and buy a half gallon?

99
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,254
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no.

100
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,847
Speaker 0: If you want a good orange juice for the train, go to like that Zaro's.

101
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:53,550
Speaker 0: Don't get any food.

102
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,610
Speaker 0: They have like the worst food in the world, but they have that unpaturized, like super awesome fresh orange juice.

103
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,929
Speaker 0: It's like four bucks, but it's awesome.

104
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,932
Speaker 1: Oh, screw that.

105
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,816
Speaker 1: I want to get more orange juice in my money.

106
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:09,669
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know, so then we go and we walk in and there's a plate of croissants in the conference room.

107
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,277
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Ah,

108
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:12,719
Speaker 1: shit.".

109
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,985
Speaker 1: And he's like, "How you bought that

110
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:14,427
Speaker 1: donut?".

111
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,817
Speaker 1: And then, right?

112
00:04:17,119 --> 00:04:18,704
Speaker 1: Then they bring in a bowl of grapes.

113
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:19,790
Speaker 1: Both kinds.

114
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:23,014
Speaker 1: And then, right?

115
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:24,699
Speaker 1: They bring it later, right?

116
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,970
Speaker 1: After we've been there a while, they bring us like these turkey slash ham sandwiches.

117
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,419
Speaker 1: You know, you could pick either or.

118
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:31,809
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh, got

119
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:31,970
Speaker 1: him.".

120
00:04:33,071 --> 00:04:39,430
Speaker 1: They were really trying to butter us up over there for reasons that I will not get into.

121
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,030
Speaker 0: You know, the cool thing is, though, go to some corporate training sometime, like those week long fly somewhere on a business trip things.

122
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:47,669
Speaker 0: They will give you breakfast and lunch like that every day.

123
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:52,067
Speaker 1: Then they tried to offer us a car ride back and we're like, "No, we'll take the subway.

124
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:52,389
Speaker 1: Thanks.".

125
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:04,190
Speaker 0: Well, speaking of the car ride, what I was going with this is they did one of those like emergency response drills on 42nd Street near the Chipotle while I was trying to go there.

126
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,610
Speaker 1: Were all the cops eating at the Chipotle?

127
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:07,535
Speaker 0: No, they were all standing around going,

128
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:07,595
Speaker 0: "Ah.".

129
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,889
Speaker 0: The reason they were going, "Ah," is it looks like they were all- They were all at the Dunkin' Donuts slash KFC.

130
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,970
Speaker 0: That's like the worst Dunkin' Donuts in the world.

131
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,150
Speaker 0: Not that Dunkin' Donuts is good anyway.

132
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,017
Speaker 0: I've decided I'm done with Dunkin' Donuts.

133
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:24,166
Speaker 0: I'm done with shitty donuts and shitty bagels.

134
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:25,150
Speaker 0: I can't do it anymore.

135
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,769
Speaker 1: I think it's now- Dunkin' Donuts bagel is the worst bagel.

136
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,029
Speaker 0: It's not the worst bagel.

137
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,309
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the worst bagel you can, you know.

138
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:39,550
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously someone could technically make a poop bagel with poop in it, but- I'll say this, Panera doesn't really have much better bagels.

139
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,209
Speaker 1: No, they're very kind of meh.

140
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what was with that thread in the forum where people were like, "Man, Panera's

141
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:46,110
Speaker 0: awesome.".

142
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:48,770
Speaker 1: That's because they don't know what's good.

143
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:49,836
Speaker 1: Remember, right?

144
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,570
Speaker 1: We think Panera's poop, right?

145
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,950
Speaker 1: But remember like, I don't know, when we were at Citicon, right?

146
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,107
Speaker 1: Panera's a million times better than anything within like a 20-mile radius, right?

147
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:07,570
Speaker 1: And so most people live in these, you know, places that don't have good food is an incredible luxury.

148
00:06:07,872 --> 00:06:12,890
Speaker 0: I mean- Well, Scott, way to put down everyone in the world except New York City and I guess Seattle.

149
00:06:13,534 --> 00:06:14,841
Speaker 1: No, there's plenty of places.

150
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,129
Speaker 1: Paris.

151
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,389
Speaker 0: Maybe Chicago.

152
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, not London.

153
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:24,685
Speaker 1: Berlin has good food.

154
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,969
Speaker 0: We got this fancy international clock because our company's going live overseas now.

155
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,070
Speaker 0: So we got one of those giant like red clocks that has all the different time zones on it.

156
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,889
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't get a bunch of separate clocks?

157
00:06:39,312 --> 00:06:40,960
Speaker 0: You realize we bought this thing.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,423
Speaker 0: We got it.

159
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,890
Speaker 0: It arrived yesterday.

160
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:48,650
Speaker 0: Every 20 minutes, someone comes in and they're like, "Oh, hey, what time is it in Helsinki?

161
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,077
Speaker 0: Hey, how much did this thing cost?

162
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:53,909
Speaker 0: Couldn't you have just bought five regular

163
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:54,090
Speaker 0: clocks?".

164
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,331
Speaker 1: Yes.

165
00:06:56,134 --> 00:07:01,201
Speaker 1: All you need is like, you get a US, you get a GMT, you get a Cali- No, no, no, Scott.

166
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:01,690
Speaker 0: Here's the reason.

167
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:03,836
Speaker 0: Here's why we got this thing.

168
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:06,029
Speaker 0: One, it looks really snazzy in the new NOC.

169
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,434
Speaker 0: It looks professional.

170
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:12,970
Speaker 0: Two, it automatically, with a network cable, synchronizes to NTP.

171
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:15,690
Speaker 1: You could get the ones that do it by radio.

172
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,148
Speaker 0: Well, it also has Wi-Fi, but- Okay.

173
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even those radio ones usually are kind of shitty.

174
00:07:22,436 --> 00:07:22,710
Speaker 0: Really?

175
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,115
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't give you that good a time.

176
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:27,389
Speaker 0: You're much better off just going over the internet to NIST with NTP.

177
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:29,669
Speaker 0: I'm the fucking NTP guy.

178
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:31,169
Speaker 1: I've noticed.

179
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, NTP is my thing.

180
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,710
Speaker 1: You should start an NTP consultancy.

181
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,329
Speaker 0: I should just take over for the guy who wrote it when he dies.

182
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,090
Speaker 1: He's a crazy Unix scientist.

183
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what I would do?

184
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:44,330
Speaker 0: Never change it, because I don't think it's been changed in my lifetime.

185
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,981
Speaker 1: What are you going to do when we get 128-bit computers?

186
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:49,890
Speaker 1: You're going to have to do something.

187
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,532
Speaker 0: No, I won't.

188
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:51,335
Speaker 0: Won't do anything.

189
00:07:51,476 --> 00:07:52,680
Speaker 0: I'll just say, "Well, this is it.

190
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:53,403
Speaker 0: This is what you

191
00:07:53,423 --> 00:07:53,604
Speaker 0: get.".

192
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,070
Speaker 0: That's what he's been doing.

193
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:59,810
Speaker 1: No, it's the stuff that's happening, but it's all the sort of stuff you don't notice.

194
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,230
Speaker 0: No, not much is happening.

195
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,145
Speaker 1: Okay, anyway.

196
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,270
Speaker 1: His documentation- Let's get on with this episode before we drag on this crap too much longer.

197
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:06,853
Speaker 0: All right.

198
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,390
Speaker 0: Suffice it to say, I was trying to walk to Chipotle.

199
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,210
Speaker 1: Oh, you're still doing okay.

200
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,990
Speaker 0: There was an ambulance also trying to get to Chipotle, which is where this thing was going.

201
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,190
Speaker 0: To get someone out who died in line waiting for- I think it was just part of the exercise.

202
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,667
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

203
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,570
Speaker 0: So it has its siren going, and the guy is sitting there like, "Ugh," and traffic's just not moving.

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,397
Speaker 0: Traffic was so not moving that I went to Chipotle, got my burrito, ate my burrito, left the Chipotle, walked back.

205
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,308
Speaker 0: It hadn't even gotten to Fifth Avenue yet.

206
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:36,289
Speaker 1: From Madison?

207
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:36,802
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:38,697
Speaker 1: It's like 1,000 feet?

209
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:41,549
Speaker 0: I hope no one was dying in there.

210
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:43,063
Speaker 1: Was he going, "Wee,

211
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:43,205
Speaker 1: wee?"?

212
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:44,530
Speaker 0: Yes, the whole time.

213
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:45,406
Speaker 0: Whoa.

214
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:47,077
Speaker 0: And there was this car in front of it.

215
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,118
Speaker 0: The guy in the car was this kind of fat guy, kind of balding, and he was sitting there just with his lips out.

216
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,350
Speaker 0: He looked the most exasperated I've ever seen a person look.

217
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:56,198
Speaker 1: He couldn't go.

218
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:57,209
Speaker 1: There was someone in front of him.

219
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,955
Speaker 0: But the ambulance was behind him honking the horn, "Wee,

220
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:00,216
Speaker 0: wee.".

221
00:09:02,182 --> 00:09:02,646
Speaker 0: He's just like,

222
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,039
Speaker 0: "Ugh.".

223
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,209
Speaker 1: Get some earplugs, man.

224
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,419
Speaker 1: This is nothing you could do.

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,640
Speaker 0: So anyway.

226
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,788
Speaker 1: All right, so news-ish.

227
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:10,714
Speaker 1: I got a tiny news.

228
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:11,660
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about it too much.

229
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:12,339
Speaker 0: Tiny news.

230
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,045
Speaker 1: There was some Google outage today.

231
00:09:15,065 --> 00:09:20,520
Speaker 1: There was some Google outage a few times before, but this one was sort of big.

232
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,398
Speaker 0: I didn't know about this one until I saw it on the news later.

233
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,945
Speaker 1: It was network-related?

234
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't have any problems with Google at all.

235
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:36,720
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell, it was one of those big peering things where, to put this into layman's terms, because this isn't a Monday night show, imagine if you're a Greek peasant, right?

236
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,420
Speaker 0: And Zeus and Thor are having a pissing contest, and they knock over some villages in the process.

237
00:09:45,523 --> 00:09:46,420
Speaker 0: That is what happened.

238
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:46,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

239
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:54,666
Speaker 1: No, so I just thought, you know, it was sort of funny because I was at this other people's office, and I tried to go to Google.com.

240
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:57,918
Speaker 1: I was on their Wi-Fi, and it didn't really go, right?

241
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,222
Speaker 1: So I'm like, huh?

242
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:03,740
Speaker 1: And then I go, and I'm just reading Google news, which worked, right?

243
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:06,879
Speaker 1: And on Google news, there was a story about Google having an outage, right?

244
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:08,559
Speaker 1: I thought that was funny.

245
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,940
Speaker 1: And then, so I tried to do another Google search, and it worked.

246
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:19,040
Speaker 1: But the reason it was slow is because they were using stupid fucking open DNS and open DNS.

247
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:19,989
Speaker 1: Why?

248
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:20,213
Speaker 1: No!

249
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Speaker 1: Open DNS freaking, like, runs Google, like, through itself.

250
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Speaker 1: It does this weird fucking thing, like, in the top left corner, it'll say open DNS instead of saying Google.

251
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:32,740
Speaker 1: And it's like it redirects you from open DNS to Google.

252
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:35,140
Speaker 1: I don't know what the fuck it's doing, but it pissed me off.

253
00:10:35,922 --> 00:10:37,234
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just got to say that's...

254
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:38,423
Speaker 0: What?

255
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:42,260
Speaker 0: It amazes me how many otherwise smart people will use open DNS.

256
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,311
Speaker 1: They're just fucking...

257
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:44,704
Speaker 0: Don't use it.

258
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:46,111
Speaker 0: If you don't know what it is, don't use it.

259
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:47,840
Speaker 0: If you know what it is, you already know not to use it.

260
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,564
Speaker 1: Exactly.

261
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:50,940
Speaker 1: I think the thing is people know enough to be dangerous.

262
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:51,838
Speaker 1: They don't really know.

263
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,594
Speaker 0: Well, they hear, "Yeah, it's the open

264
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:53,938
Speaker 0: source.".

265
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,818
Speaker 0: Because, I don't know, it's just...

266
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,880
Speaker 1: You can, a DNS server, it's bind, it's free.

267
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,473
Speaker 1: You just turn it on, and that's it.

268
00:11:00,857 --> 00:11:01,120
Speaker 1: You're good.

269
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,180
Speaker 1: And your ISP gives you a DNS server, you can use that.

270
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,539
Speaker 0: But yeah, luckily, that's one thing I really miss about RIT is that basically when the gobs...

271
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,540
Speaker 1: We had a hundred open DNS servers.

272
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,400
Speaker 1: I mean, no, not open DNS, regular old DNS servers.

273
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:17,967
Speaker 0: Well, we had the... Oh, 129.2121.1 is gone.

274
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,200
Speaker 0: It stopped responding.

275
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,320
Speaker 1: You thought it was going to stay there forever?

276
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, that thing, I've used that forever, and the fact that it's gone is a sad day for me.

277
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,580
Speaker 0: That was like my backup...

278
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,320
Speaker 1: Just go find, ask some RIT student what their DNS server is.

279
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,902
Speaker 1: But we were also...

280
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:38,620
Speaker 0: No, that wasn't RIT's DNS server, that was IT's DNS server.

281
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,878
Speaker 1: I'm done saying, go ask an RIT student what their DNS server is and you can use it.

282
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:43,587
Speaker 1: Eh.

283
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:44,419
Speaker 1: Yeah.

284
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:45,519
Speaker 0: That's all you got?

285
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:46,259
Speaker 1: Yeah.

286
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:46,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, Google.

287
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:47,800
Speaker 0: That happens.

288
00:11:49,081 --> 00:12:01,813
Speaker 0: So Cheerios, I assume everyone... We're not breaking news here on Geek Nights here, but I happen to find... There's a weird side story where I saw this article this morning at like 4.45 on Fark.

289
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,640
Speaker 1: I didn't know Cheerios are yummy.

290
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:05,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are.

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:06,720
Speaker 1: A honey of an oat.

292
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,646
Speaker 0: But at 4.45

293
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:09,007
Speaker 0: a.m.,

294
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:11,617
Speaker 0: I see on Fark this Cheerios thing, and I'm like, "Was it?

295
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:12,480
Speaker 1: Huh?".

296
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:13,770
Speaker 0: And I read it, and I'm like, "What?

297
00:12:14,194 --> 00:12:14,477
Speaker 0: Whoa.

298
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,413
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I got to talk about this

299
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:16,716
Speaker 0: later.".

300
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:27,139
Speaker 0: And then throughout the day, like I saw more and more news picking up on it, I got home and I went into My Delicious and I went to this Fark story to bring it up to be my news, and it was no longer on Fark.

301
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:31,500
Speaker 0: They moved it to Total Fark, which I don't pay for because I'm not crazy.

302
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Speaker 1: Why would they move it from regular Fark to Total Fark?

303
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,279
Speaker 1: Isn't it supposed to be the opposite direction, like Total Fark is everything and then only good stuff goes to regular Fark?

304
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,860
Speaker 0: It happens every now and then, but I have no idea why.

305
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:48,740
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because it's a hot story and they want, it's like, "Yeah, this story's so hot.

306
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:52,417
Speaker 1: We only want people to talk about it if they're awesome and pay for Total

307
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:52,678
Speaker 1: Fark.".

308
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:55,160
Speaker 1: It's like only the awesome people can get in on this one.

309
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,579
Speaker 0: Thing is, I'd probably, if I were at RIT now- Thing is, how would you find it on Total Fark?

310
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,040
Speaker 0: You pretty much go by what people are commenting on.

311
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:03,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, right?

312
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:13,620
Speaker 0: But Cheerios either going to have to be regulated as a drug or have to stop lying about the health benefits or prove that they're not lying about the health benefits.

313
00:13:15,582 --> 00:13:19,460
Speaker 0: I really don't know what to think about this because it came out of nowhere.

314
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,340
Speaker 0: This just was like a bolt out of the blue.

315
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:27,359
Speaker 1: Well, it came out of nowhere as far as we're concerned, but maybe the people who deal with this sort of thing, maybe they saw it coming.

316
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, if anyone has any insight, we'd really like to hear from you.

317
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,320
Speaker 0: We'll get you on the show because I see a very small number of possibilities.

318
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:39,538
Speaker 0: One, it just randomly, it came out and that's just it.

319
00:13:40,242 --> 00:13:40,939
Speaker 0: This just happened.

320
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,099
Speaker 0: Maybe it was in the works for a while.

321
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:50,060
Speaker 0: Two, more likely, the FDA is like this might be the tip of the iceberg as I'm going after people pulling this bullshit.

322
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:50,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's the thing.

323
00:13:51,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Speaker 1: It's like I'm sort of torn on this because on the one hand, right, Cheerios does a lot of things sort of make foods, regular old foods, are making increasingly crazy claims on their foods, right?

324
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:15,415
Speaker 1: You go buy some grape juice and it has these American Heart Association seals on it and they don't say it outright, but they heavily imply that somehow if you drink grape juice, you're not going to have a heart attack and die, which is...

325
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,959
Speaker 0: What about grape drink?

326
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,560
Speaker 1: Right.

327
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:20,720
Speaker 1: It's like Cheerios really does the same sort of thing.

328
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,058
Speaker 1: They're like, "Oh man, cholesterol, heart, yeah,

329
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:24,440
Speaker 1: awesome.".

330
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,120
Speaker 0: Cheerios went a little bit further though.

331
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:27,640
Speaker 0: But here's the thing.

332
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:37,020
Speaker 1: But the point is, it's like, okay, I agree that the claims and the Cheerios are probably exaggerated if not false and that they should not be allowed to have the false advertising.

333
00:14:37,122 --> 00:14:38,120
Speaker 1: That is very good, right?

334
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:48,160
Speaker 1: But there are much more egregious false advertisers out there that you should go after before you go after the Cheerios.

335
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
Speaker 0: Homeopathy, Airborne, that Orinna Chalcum stuff.

336
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,400
Speaker 1: That's like if you had like... That's like if you walk down the street, right, and there's a mass murderer.

337
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,040
Speaker 1: He's just like hosing everyone down with a flame thrower and he's blowing up buildings, right?

338
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:00,540
Speaker 0: I see you played Postal as well.

339
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,966
Speaker 1: And there's another guy who just stabbed, he's just the hobo and the hobo stabbed one dude.

340
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,339
Speaker 1: And you get all over that hobo.

341
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,671
Speaker 1: You're like, "Hobo, you're going to

342
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:09,156
Speaker 1: jail.".

343
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:11,439
Speaker 1: And meanwhile, the mass murderer is right there.

344
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:13,060
Speaker 1: You don't care about him.

345
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,890
Speaker 0: See, in this case, I picture the cop as he's hauling the hobo away, like topping his hat to the mass murderer, just like,

346
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,152
Speaker 0: "Hey.".

347
00:15:20,725 --> 00:15:21,700
Speaker 1: See, that's the situation.

348
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:23,920
Speaker 1: So it's like, "Yes, you caught that stabbing hobo.

349
00:15:24,301 --> 00:15:25,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, he deserved to go to

350
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:25,539
Speaker 1: jail.".

351
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,800
Speaker 0: But they don't go after... "But there's a mass murderer.

352
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,216
Speaker 0: What the fuck is wrong with

353
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:29,338
Speaker 0: you?".

354
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:32,500
Speaker 0: So they're going after Cheerios, but not like Zykan.

355
00:15:32,802 --> 00:15:33,118
Speaker 1: Exactly.

356
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:34,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

357
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,000
Speaker 1: Well, they did go after Air... They went after Airborne a little bit.

358
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,340
Speaker 0: But Airborne's still being sold with the same bullshit claim.

359
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's another thing, right?

360
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,399
Speaker 1: I heard that they were threatening to, if the Cheerios didn't fix themselves, to stop Cheerios from going out.

361
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:48,904
Speaker 1: Now.

362
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,500
Speaker 1: But they never threatened to remove Airborne from the market.

363
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,239
Speaker 1: They just threatened to fine them a whole bunch.

364
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,300
Speaker 0: So thus, what I'm curious is, what's the impetus for this?

365
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,460
Speaker 0: Because the ad campaign that they're complaining about has been going on for a year and a half.

366
00:16:04,626 --> 00:16:05,480
Speaker 1: It took them so long.

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,635
Speaker 0: It was the claim that Cheerios can reduce cholesterol by 4% in six weeks.

368
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,438
Speaker 0: You know what I would do?

369
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,776
Speaker 0: And quote, "The FDA was responding to a complaint by the National Consumers

370
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,038
Speaker 0: League.".

371
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,918
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

372
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:20,599
Speaker 1: Huh, maybe we should just join the National Consumers League and just constantly... Maybe, you know what?

373
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:21,600
Speaker 0: Here's an idea.

374
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,920
Speaker 0: The same thing that the people who come... You know, those old people.

375
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,680
Speaker 0: The Parents Television Council.

376
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:27,277
Speaker 1: Right.

377
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:36,000
Speaker 1: The FCC, all the bullshit the FCC does is because all these cranky old people keep writing letters to the FCC telling them to get the swearing off television.

378
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:45,080
Speaker 1: Let's everyone write letters to the FDA and FTC just like the Parents Television Council does to complain about the fake medicines.

379
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,960
Speaker 1: Let's just keep doing it for every single fake medicine and every single false advertising on a food out there.

380
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,520
Speaker 1: Let's just keep doing it and we'll end up like the Parents Television Council.

381
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:03,279
Speaker 1: A very small portion of the population of the country having a very large amount of power.

382
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:04,778
Speaker 0: But what I'm really...

383
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,760
Speaker 1: I'm actually serious.

384
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:06,869
Speaker 1: I'm going to start doing it.

385
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 1: We'll... Tomorrow.

386
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,200
Speaker 0: Well, we'll sort out the details, make a foreign post or something.

387
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:19,776
Speaker 1: Well, we have to start an NGO and we have to give it a name and we have to make a little website.

388
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,218
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to actually start an NGO?

389
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

390
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:22,838
Speaker 1: How hard could it be?

391
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:23,640
Speaker 0: All right.

392
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,740
Speaker 0: Let's... We could do that or we could just actually incorporate geek nights.

393
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:28,378
Speaker 1: Well, no.

394
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:35,520
Speaker 1: We could start a little NGO and all it will do is send letters to the FTC and FDA telling them about false advertising in food and medicine.

395
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,820
Speaker 0: But anyway, what I'm wondering is what was the real impetus for this?

396
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:49,000
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe it's the tip of the iceberg, go after like the highest profile thing, get a lot of public support and then just go after everything else after that because everything else is low-hanging.

397
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,657
Speaker 0: I mean, if you can get Cheerios for saying that it's good for your heart, you can get Zicam.

398
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:55,439
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

399
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,620
Speaker 1: Which doesn't do anything except destroy your sense of smell.

400
00:17:59,864 --> 00:18:00,318
Speaker 0: Give or take.

401
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,460
Speaker 1: And of course, you know, they have ones that are not nasal sprays, right?

402
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:05,959
Speaker 1: Those don't destroy your sense of smell.

403
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:08,080
Speaker 1: They're just useless sucking candies.

404
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,038
Speaker 0: What about head on?

405
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,431
Speaker 1: That's just... That's just a step of wax.

406
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:16,700
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess head on is okay because if you put a wick in it, it's a nice candle.

407
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,880
Speaker 0: Well, head on was brilliant.

408
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:21,140
Speaker 0: They didn't make any claim other than apply directly to the forehead.

409
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:22,100
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,100
Speaker 1: But there's an obvious implication of medicinal effect.

411
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:40,920
Speaker 1: And I think that we need some sort of, you know, laws that give the, you know, FDA, FTC and judges discretion to make these subjective judgment calls that are obvious.

412
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,749
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

413
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,664
Speaker 1: So I saw this video on YouTube from RIT.

414
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,381
Speaker 0: R-I-T.

415
00:18:56,694 --> 00:19:00,450
Speaker 1: Apparently they have some sort of Imagine RIT thing.

416
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,270
Speaker 1: I guess it's similar to the Brick City.

417
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:03,290
Speaker 1: I don't know what the deal is.

418
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,809
Speaker 0: Imagine RIT was there when we were there, I think.

419
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,199
Speaker 1: Was it?

420
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,530
Speaker 1: I think it's more newer.

421
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,170
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

422
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,970
Speaker 0: Imagine RIT sounds really familiar.

423
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,722
Speaker 0: Maybe I just get...

424
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,150
Speaker 1: You get mail about it.

425
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

426
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,470
Speaker 1: I think it's the Brick City Festival, Springfest type of... It's one of those shticks, right?

427
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,890
Speaker 0: Man, Springfest was only good the first year that we went to it.

428
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,630
Speaker 0: Then they ruined it.

429
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:21,130
Speaker 1: I know, right?

430
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,350
Speaker 0: Remember we had that all-night party?

431
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:22,746
Speaker 1: I know.

432
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:23,430
Speaker 1: Isn't that crazy?

433
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:30,267
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically for Imagine RIT, some RIT kids made some Domino thing.

434
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,590
Speaker 1: You know, cool Domino knock-you-downy thing.

435
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,886
Speaker 1: And there's a YouTube video of it.

436
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:37,329
Speaker 1: And there's actually a second YouTube video.

437
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,629
Speaker 1: It's sort of the making of the first YouTube video.

438
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,230
Speaker 1: And so they got Dominoes going around the RIT flag.

439
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:46,130
Speaker 1: And they got one part.

440
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,589
Speaker 1: It hits a button on a coffee machine.

441
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,690
Speaker 1: And out comes a printed paper with some RIT logo on it.

442
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,449
Speaker 1: And that knocks over some other Dominoes.

443
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:54,870
Speaker 1: It's good stuff.

444
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,707
Speaker 0: Too bad they didn't knock over the Sentinel at the end.

445
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:05,170
Speaker 0: The thing is, the Sentinel, for RIT people out there, I don't think they hate it anymore.

446
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,690
Speaker 0: I think only the people who were at RIT when they built it hated it.

447
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,510
Speaker 1: Because, you know, college kids hate anything.

448
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:19,790
Speaker 1: Anyone who came to RIT now, anyone who's still there, unless they're someone who's been there a long time, to them, the Sentinel has just always been there.

449
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,110
Speaker 1: It's as natural as the Tiger with the golden ball.

450
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,090
Speaker 0: I think it's just like the Eiffel Tower.

451
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,889
Speaker 0: People hate anything that's new.

452
00:20:27,252 --> 00:20:29,289
Speaker 0: And then once those people are gone, no one else cares.

453
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, how many times there was a big sign in a city.

454
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,910
Speaker 1: And everyone wanted to get rid of the sign.

455
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:36,529
Speaker 1: It was ugly.

456
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 1: But then it stays there for so long.

457
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:40,030
Speaker 1: Now they want to get rid of the sign.

458
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:41,829
Speaker 1: Oh, it's old.

459
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:43,190
Speaker 1: It's a part of the city.

460
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,989
Speaker 1: Don't get rid of it.

461
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,450
Speaker 0: Oh, my goodness.

462
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,130
Speaker 0: Like that Citgo sign or Raleigh Woodland.

463
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,490
Speaker 1: All that sort of shit, right?

464
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,970
Speaker 1: So, you know, the Sentinel, it is ugly, there is no doubt.

465
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,050
Speaker 1: It is big and monstrous and sort of out of place.

466
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,710
Speaker 1: I guess the color matches.

467
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:02,470
Speaker 0: The thing is, I think the Sentinel actually fits RIT's character very well.

468
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:03,748
Speaker 0: And I think it's kind of cool.

469
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:10,390
Speaker 0: The thing is, I would have preferred an enormous Tiger on the scale of the Colossus of Rhodes.

470
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:16,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, imagine if they just made the same Tiger statue only that big and on two legs.

471
00:21:16,472 --> 00:21:19,170
Speaker 0: The testicles would be too much for one man to paint in a night.

472
00:21:19,931 --> 00:21:27,330
Speaker 1: Because you drive down La Memorial Drive straight down and you see these two gigantic golden Tiger nuts.

473
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:29,389
Speaker 1: As big as your car.

474
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,629
Speaker 0: You know what's sad?

475
00:21:31,351 --> 00:21:34,710
Speaker 0: I almost said Sardia instead of Rhodes.

476
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,130
Speaker 0: Like it almost came out.

477
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,409
Speaker 1: That's where Colossus are from.

478
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,650
Speaker 1: There were Colossus in both places.

479
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:51,870
Speaker 0: So, anyway, not one with nine strength and nine fortitude or whatever those stats were called.

480
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,430
Speaker 0: Fuck magic.

481
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,789
Speaker 1: Attack and defense, I don't give a shit.

482
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:56,270
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I had some other thing of the day.

483
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,188
Speaker 0: I'm not going to use it because we'll talk about it for too long.

484
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:00,750
Speaker 0: So, this is pretty good though.

485
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:02,528
Speaker 0: I saw the recent Star Trek movie.

486
00:22:03,476 --> 00:22:04,147
Speaker 0: I thought it was badass.

487
00:22:05,436 --> 00:22:06,109
Speaker 0: I'm very much a fan.

488
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,090
Speaker 0: I look forward to the sequel.

489
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:09,970
Speaker 0: And I have seen Star Wars.

490
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:12,930
Speaker 0: I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, the original.

491
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,530
Speaker 1: I always compare the two, but really they have nothing to do with each other.

492
00:22:16,012 --> 00:22:17,629
Speaker 0: It's funny because that's what this video is.

493
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:18,930
Speaker 0: And you haven't seen it yet.

494
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,830
Speaker 0: I'll show it to you after the show.

495
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:25,070
Speaker 0: But as Scott has now seen, the movies are more similar than you might think.

496
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,349
Speaker 1: Well, at least the new ones.

497
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:30,230
Speaker 1: I mean, the old ones really don't have anything to do with Star Wars at all.

498
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:31,050
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

499
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,270
Speaker 0: Well, they're in space.

500
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,478
Speaker 1: I mean, this is not have anything to do with my like or dislike of Star Wars or Star Trek.

501
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,039
Speaker 1: But you know, I mean, if you're going to make sort of a shallow comparison of the two, right?

502
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:51,769
Speaker 1: It's X-wing, TIE fighter dog fighting versus a bunch of people standing in a room and pretending the room is shaking.

503
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:57,170
Speaker 0: But at the same time, Star Trek technology would probably kick the shit out of Star Wars technology.

504
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:57,686
Speaker 1: Well, remember it.

505
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,929
Speaker 1: Well, depends when.

506
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,470
Speaker 1: I mean, we're talking about the old republic.

507
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,610
Speaker 1: Star Trek's got nothing.

508
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:02,790
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:10,990
Speaker 1: But if you're talking about, you know, original trilogy, it's like, you know, freaking, it's the equivalent of outer space versus the North Star.

510
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,430
Speaker 1: So, you know, oh, man, we should make Hokutono outer space.

511
00:23:18,996 --> 00:23:19,949
Speaker 0: That might be too much.

512
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,669
Speaker 0: What is this?

513
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,010
Speaker 0: Do they launch Kenshiro at ships?

514
00:23:23,531 --> 00:23:23,849
Speaker 1: No, no.

515
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,449
Speaker 1: The ship goes.

516
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,310
Speaker 1: And then the other ship explodes.

517
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:28,868
Speaker 0: That might be too much.

518
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:37,610
Speaker 0: So to talk about legitimate art and literature, we finally, I read and finished Cavalier and Clay, the Geek Nights book club.

519
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:44,810
Speaker 1: And as a disclaimer, while, you know, I have to say, I read it a while ago, months and months ago, perhaps even over a year ago.

520
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,390
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

521
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:45,722
Speaker 1: Right.

522
00:23:46,331 --> 00:23:50,887
Speaker 1: But when I read it, it's I think it's still my favorite book, even though I've only read it once.

523
00:23:51,271 --> 00:23:54,250
Speaker 1: Like it just, you know, and I remember it being my favorite book.

524
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,650
Speaker 1: But as is the way of my brain, many of the details are forgotten.

525
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:00,348
Speaker 1: Right.

526
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:08,263
Speaker 1: But I'm sure that as soon as we begin discussing, because I remember, you know, many things, you know, it will come rushing back to me and I'll

527
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:13,124
Speaker 0: be like, oh, man, I mean, pretty much the best part of the entire novel was when, oh,

528
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:14,610
Speaker 1: wait, wait, let's see what you think.

529
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:21,030
Speaker 0: The best part is when Joe exploded the head of that guy who was pounding that farmer into the ground like a pile driver.

530
00:24:21,173 --> 00:24:21,827
Speaker 1: That's what you think.

531
00:24:22,412 --> 00:24:24,850
Speaker 1: Now, see, for me, for me, there's two different parts.

532
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,470
Speaker 0: This is a book that was about comic books and Jews and New York City.

533
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,478
Speaker 0: Like what book could be more up?

534
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,150
Speaker 0: your also also the war, also the war.

535
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:41,929
Speaker 1: And also golems, golems and escapism, you know, like Houdini types, but also every other type of escapism.

536
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:43,350
Speaker 0: You see what he did there.

537
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:43,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

538
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,250
Speaker 0: Now, before we go any further, you know, this is the geek nights book club.

539
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,349
Speaker 0: This kind of came in after all that news and stuff.

540
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:55,050
Speaker 0: If you haven't read Michael Chabon's Cavalier and Clay, the amazing adventures of the cavalry.

541
00:24:55,352 --> 00:24:56,128
Speaker 0: Don't listen to this.

542
00:24:56,491 --> 00:25:00,386
Speaker 0: Go listen to the other episode where we said, hey, this is the next book in the in the book club.

543
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:01,369
Speaker 0: And then read that book.

544
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:04,869
Speaker 1: By the way, this book won Pulitzer Prize for best book.

545
00:25:05,351 --> 00:25:06,235
Speaker 1: So you should.

546
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:13,070
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was I don't know who's for best book, but it won the Pulitzer Prize and it should have been for best book period.

547
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,390
Speaker 0: But yes, book involving comic books.

548
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,330
Speaker 1: That means it's legit like for reals.

549
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,730
Speaker 1: That is, you know, it's not like, you know, sure you read sci fi books.

550
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:25,563
Speaker 1: They have Hugo and Nebula awards, which are not.

551
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:26,830
Speaker 1: I don't want to put them down.

552
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:28,189
Speaker 1: Those are excellent awards.

553
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:31,370
Speaker 1: And only great sci fi books have won those awards.

554
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:35,130
Speaker 1: But a Pulitzer Prize is like two steps beyond that.

555
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:37,089
Speaker 1: That is like serious business.

556
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,790
Speaker 1: So anyway, I think there were two equivalent best parts of the book.

557
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:43,393
Speaker 1: Right.

558
00:25:43,734 --> 00:25:46,750
Speaker 1: Number one was the Empire State Building roof scene.

559
00:25:47,052 --> 00:25:48,729
Speaker 0: That was that was pretty well done.

560
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:55,916
Speaker 1: Like after like while reading that, like I was you know, I was working in the city like I kind of wanted to.

561
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,969
Speaker 1: I was like I thought about going in line and going up there.

562
00:25:59,271 --> 00:25:59,412
Speaker 0: Why?

563
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,670
Speaker 0: Because you're waiting to meet your Tracy Bacon.

564
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,274
Speaker 1: I don't know.

565
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,910
Speaker 1: I was just thinking about like going up there.

566
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,189
Speaker 1: But then I saw there was a long line and I was like, oh, fuck it.

567
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,449
Speaker 0: But Scott, Tracy's up there waiting for you.

568
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:09,434
Speaker 1: I know right now.

569
00:26:09,495 --> 00:26:12,894
Speaker 1: Just thinking about going up there just because I only the last time I was up there.

570
00:26:12,914 --> 00:26:14,169
Speaker 1: How old how old do you think I was?

571
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,389
Speaker 0: Scott, I've never been up there.

572
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:15,874
Speaker 1: Wow.

573
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:17,550
Speaker 1: Let's go up there.

574
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should.

575
00:26:18,196 --> 00:26:19,269
Speaker 1: Let's go up there.

576
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:20,590
Speaker 0: I'm not Tracy Bacon.

577
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:24,570
Speaker 1: No, last time I was out there, I was 10 years old with my grandma.

578
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:26,109
Speaker 1: We took the express bus from Queens.

579
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,510
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's been a while.

580
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:29,869
Speaker 1: It's been a long time.

581
00:26:30,532 --> 00:26:30,854
Speaker 0: I don't know.

582
00:26:30,914 --> 00:26:33,309
Speaker 0: I really I liked the part.

583
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:34,113
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait.

584
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:37,050
Speaker 1: Now, my other favorite part was in Antarctica.

585
00:26:37,771 --> 00:26:41,448
Speaker 1: That whole thing, the whole mostly the the, you know, the finish of it.

586
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:44,650
Speaker 0: That that was I don't know.

587
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:51,990
Speaker 0: I guess that was you expected that sort of thing to happen in terms of finally gets his revenge or kill someone or something and then realizes it.

588
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:58,251
Speaker 0: But it was the fact that they kind of glottal, not they, he but Michael Chavon does this a lot.

589
00:26:58,271 --> 00:27:03,710
Speaker 0: He'll kind of gloss over a detail and then later on tell you what actually happened.

590
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right.

591
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,870
Speaker 0: And a lot of the good scenes I think were like that, like that was in particular where they don't point out that he's dead until a little while later.

592
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,209
Speaker 0: Or I think the best example was with the the raid in the Jersey Shore.

593
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:28,330
Speaker 0: Remember that how it's describing like it starts out, you know, he went there and all this stuff, and then he just has this line like, you know, these people were here at these times as the police report would later indicate.

594
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,310
Speaker 0: And then he just goes on explaining the rest of the scene in the story.

595
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,568
Speaker 0: And you're like, wait a minute, police report.

596
00:27:33,231 --> 00:27:33,575
Speaker 0: That's it.

597
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,869
Speaker 0: What's going on here?

598
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty good.

599
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:50,655
Speaker 0: Of course, the cool thing about that, too, is notice how that would make things that were like a scene that if you just read it without knowing like that one sentence, he throws in near the beginning that you have one feeling, one vibe, like, oh, they're at the shore.

600
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:51,528
Speaker 0: Oh, he's doing this.

601
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,552
Speaker 0: But because they'll have he'll have that one line that adds this whole ominous tint to everything.

602
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,250
Speaker 0: I suddenly you're wondering, wait a minute, is someone going to die?

603
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,301
Speaker 0: What's going to happen?

604
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:01,989
Speaker 0: What's going on?

605
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:02,957
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

606
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:03,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

607
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,150
Speaker 1: It's good stuff because it's like it's a foreshadow, right?

608
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,950
Speaker 1: It's not even just a foreshadow, which is sort of like a hint.

609
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:11,870
Speaker 1: It's like it's not a hint.

610
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,909
Speaker 1: It's a guarantee like something's going to happen.

611
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,189
Speaker 1: But it could be all these possibilities.

612
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:16,851
Speaker 0: Yeah.

613
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:25,349
Speaker 1: And plus, the book starts out as opposed to a foreshadow, which is a hint, but not a guarantee that a very that usually you know exactly what's going to happen.

614
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:30,750
Speaker 0: But more often than not, it keeps the book kept hinting the whole time at all these future tragedies.

615
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:35,689
Speaker 0: And then they were never well, they were rarely as bad as you expected them to be.

616
00:28:36,973 --> 00:28:42,977
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, nothing really, really terrible happens other other than it's not a tragedy story.

617
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:44,509
Speaker 0: Well, other than World War Two.

618
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,432
Speaker 1: Yeah.

619
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:55,612
Speaker 1: I mean, like, you know, to the main type characters, you know, it's mostly, you know, an adventure story with, you know, that it's primarily actually an adventure story, I would say.

620
00:28:56,134 --> 00:29:00,933
Speaker 0: Well, I would say it was an adventure story for the first like two thirds, maybe three quarters.

621
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:04,654
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then once he gets back from the war, it's not as the era has changed.

622
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,830
Speaker 0: It's like the fifties changed everyone.

623
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:17,650
Speaker 0: And like everyone moves out to suburbia and leaves these lame fake lives and they all forget about adventure and they all just kind of like they live this mundane existence and it takes a big spark to put them back into rights again.

624
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:27,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, you know, the big thing about this book is how while it is a work of fiction, like how much of it like just matches up with real things.

625
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:27,811
Speaker 1: Right.

626
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:42,490
Speaker 1: For example, right about the start of the book is like, you know, when like Superman is setting the shelves and about the end of the book is when they're, you know, having the, you know, like the, you know, the trials for, you know, we're just kind of right.

627
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:43,273
Speaker 0: All that happened.

628
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:49,235
Speaker 1: Well, no, that is, you know, that range of years is the golden age of comic books.

629
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:59,050
Speaker 1: So it's, you know, it's like covering that exact period of time, you know, you know, and other interesting things like the whole beginning of the book where like, you know, they're there in the comic book business.

630
00:29:59,271 --> 00:29:59,532
Speaker 1: Right.

631
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:16,051
Speaker 1: Basically what that is, is he took the real world stories of all of these different, you know, comic book creators in the history of American comic books, you know, Stanley, Jack Kirby, Will Eisner, Staranko, like all these, you know, comic book people.

632
00:30:16,332 --> 00:30:16,593
Speaker 1: Right.

633
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:25,691
Speaker 1: He took all their stories, which are well documented and sort of combined them and mashed them and mashed them together, you know, into the story of just two people.

634
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:38,480
Speaker 1: So it's like, you know, there there be, you know, you're learning that like, you know, the professional histories of all these, you know, like comic book, you know, greats of the United States all at once.

635
00:30:38,942 --> 00:30:41,736
Speaker 1: And it's, you know, if you don't know it, you won't realize it.

636
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:51,932
Speaker 0: You know, at the same time, I feel like you get a sort of a history and like an amalgamated history of the eras, like each decade, each societal era.

637
00:30:51,952 --> 00:31:05,360
Speaker 0: That's a Forrest Gump kind of thing of New York City in particular, like you get like the, you know, the twenties, the thirties, the forties, the fifties, like you get each one kind of just what people felt like and what the vibe was through the characters.

638
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:06,808
Speaker 0: Now they're vibrant in one era.

639
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:13,377
Speaker 0: And then, you know, the world's beaten him down in the war and then after the war, the kind of post-war normalcy and everything.

640
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:15,239
Speaker 0: And I don't know, I really dug that.

641
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:15,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

642
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:22,200
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's stuff like remember when he goes to Grand Central to get on the train to Canada, right?

643
00:31:22,561 --> 00:31:23,612
Speaker 1: Grand Central to Canada.

644
00:31:23,672 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 1: OK, right.

645
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:26,799
Speaker 1: I wish it still went to Canada and then.

646
00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:27,422
Speaker 1: Right.

647
00:31:27,743 --> 00:31:35,996
Speaker 1: Like he gets off and he turns around, but didn't wasn't that also when like he he got into a fight with what's the German box smelling Max Schmeling?

648
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:37,224
Speaker 1: he had a bunch of that.

649
00:31:37,285 --> 00:31:38,759
Speaker 1: But that also wasn't at the same place.

650
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:46,200
Speaker 0: But I like the mythology of even like the Max Schmeling incident, because obviously Michael Chabot never lets you know if that was really Max Schmeling.

651
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:46,621
Speaker 1: I know.

652
00:31:46,661 --> 00:31:46,842
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:52,144
Speaker 1: It's like there's so much, you know, the mythological stuff mixed in with this reality stuff.

654
00:31:52,164 --> 00:31:58,700
Speaker 1: You get the golem and the Max Schmeling and the, you know, the I think the Indiana Jones style adventure, Antarctica.

655
00:31:58,981 --> 00:32:10,120
Speaker 0: I think it's all allegory that all the comic books from each era represent what people were like in that era and what people were feeling in that era.

656
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:16,080
Speaker 0: And you look at the Golden Age and compared to what was going on in the places where comics were being made during the Golden Age.

657
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:18,019
Speaker 0: And I think there's a strong reflection.

658
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:19,764
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

659
00:32:19,784 --> 00:32:21,600
Speaker 0: Well, I don't I don't I don't even say I think I know.

660
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:30,539
Speaker 0: And this is just an amazing novel that just like as an aside points that out in a really excellent way, because that's not really the focus.

661
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,683
Speaker 0: That's just like this amazing parallelism that I think is what gives the book a lot of its strength.

662
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:35,167
Speaker 0: Yeah.

663
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:36,780
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that it's written.

664
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,829
Speaker 1: And you've also you know, you've also got there are other instances of like, you know, famous people like what's his name is in there.

665
00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:43,512
Speaker 1: isn't Dali?

666
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:44,476
Speaker 1: or was it Dali?

667
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:46,144
Speaker 1: or was it Picasso is in there?

668
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:47,110
Speaker 1: Someone was.

669
00:32:47,351 --> 00:32:48,879
Speaker 0: it was either Dali or Picasso.

670
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Speaker 0: I forget which one it was almost fantastically died in a diving accident.

671
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:53,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

672
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forget which one it was.

673
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:04,220
Speaker 1: But he's got like, you know, famous people from history sort of, you know, who are of the time sort of coming in as, you know, mythical characters almost.

674
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:05,877
Speaker 1: It's pretty it's it's.

675
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:08,589
Speaker 1: All right, so what else?

676
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,900
Speaker 1: what else do you say about this?

677
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:17,900
Speaker 0: That is I mean, just before we get into more details or good scenes or anything, the writing in this book is, for lack of a better word, flawless.

678
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is just.

679
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:28,679
Speaker 0: his phrasing is so smooth and so flowing and like the structure of every paragraph is like parallel to the paragraph after it.

680
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,246
Speaker 0: And it kind of pulls you into this rhythm and he'll drag you along and drag you along and you'll get really into it.

681
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:35,380
Speaker 0: And they'll pull a gigantic change up suddenly.

682
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:47,920
Speaker 0: Or, you know, I run into this a lot with less apt writers where you'll be reading a story or watching an anime or comic book or something, and it gets to the point to where you can predict like where the story is going to go from here.

683
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:56,020
Speaker 0: Like a good example is in the beginning when they actually start making comic books for Ashkenazi and that other guy, you know, the midget radio comics, whatever.

684
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,023
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:33:57,043 --> 00:34:07,080
Speaker 0: And you see right away, like after this, there's going to be the long story of they're being exploited, but they have their creative freedom and the fighting and eventually breaking free and making comics elsewhere.

686
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,469
Speaker 0: You know, all this sort of like.

687
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:10,583
Speaker 0: you have this expectation of where the story is going to go.

688
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,219
Speaker 0: And the story does go that way.

689
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,699
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it'd be like this giant twist and it wouldn't be as good of a book.

690
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:27,759
Speaker 0: Instead, Shayvon just kind of gets to the point and the moment you know where the story is going to go next, it skips ahead to the next point after all the stuff you knew was going to happen to where you don't know what's going to happen again.

691
00:34:28,521 --> 00:34:31,618
Speaker 0: Like it skips every possible tedious moment in the story.

692
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,456
Speaker 0: And it's rare that I find a work that does that.

693
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,463
Speaker 0: Hmm.

694
00:34:39,005 --> 00:34:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I didn't really think about it that way.

695
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:51,772
Speaker 0: Well, it happens a lot of times, more like the Alaska thing, like it gets to the point where it's resolved and then it doesn't follow the story of getting back or all that other stuff.

696
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:52,120
Speaker 1: It's true.

697
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

698
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:56,860
Speaker 0: You skip large swatches of the story where the I guess the narrative would have been.

699
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,120
Speaker 1: At some point in the story, it skips like a whole ton of years, right?

700
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:00,742
Speaker 0: Yeah.

701
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:05,858
Speaker 0: But look, a lot like when it skips the most time is when they're living that boring suburban life.

702
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:06,722
Speaker 1: Exactly.

703
00:35:06,762 --> 00:35:10,320
Speaker 1: You know, he pretty much skips over when anything's not happening.

704
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,479
Speaker 1: You know, if the status quo doesn't change for a long period of time, it just, you know, glosses right over and gets to the point where there's action.

705
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,002
Speaker 1: The books.

706
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:21,168
Speaker 1: And I mean, how many years is he like in the Empire State Building just living there, working on his thing?

707
00:35:21,188 --> 00:35:25,299
Speaker 0: that, you know, they don't really skips all the license plate making and gets to the one good part.

708
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:25,804
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:35:25,966 --> 00:35:27,139
Speaker 1: And then it milks that good part.

710
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:36,658
Speaker 1: And I think, you know, earlier in the book, when there's actually adventure type stuff, you know, it's, you know, they'd have to skip fewer years than when, you know, the boring stuff happens later.

711
00:35:37,162 --> 00:35:40,800
Speaker 0: Plus just the diction and I don't know, the writing is just amazing.

712
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:51,780
Speaker 0: And it really like he uses grown up words, he instills a sense of nostalgia for things in the context of the book, not just like, you know, say I was old.

713
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:52,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

714
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:54,880
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm an old guy and I have nostalgia for Superman.

715
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:55,302
Speaker 1: Right.

716
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:59,540
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, these characters start out pretty young teenagers.

717
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:00,082
Speaker 1: Right.

718
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:01,828
Speaker 1: And then you get you.

719
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:12,359
Speaker 1: you pass so many years in the book, but then you're having nostalgia for the earlier stuff in the book itself, especially because he like he writes the remember when Max Schmeling punch you in the face.

720
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:16,800
Speaker 0: Remember when we burned our mouths on that four cheese bread, beer and pizza.

721
00:36:17,181 --> 00:36:17,422
Speaker 1: Right.

722
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:18,023
Speaker 1: Exactly.

723
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:25,900
Speaker 0: But the book, I don't know, he really writes the virility and vitality of youth very well.

724
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:40,364
Speaker 0: And that in and of itself wouldn't be amazing, except for the fact that the counterpoint of when they're older, like the characters at each age are written in such a way that you start to feel the world from the perspective of someone who is that age, who is living in that age.

725
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:54,481
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, getting to the point where they're in their 20s, 30s and there you feel like I feel the same way reading them thinking about their youth that I feel thinking about myself when I was 17 or 18.

726
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:54,662
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

727
00:36:54,943 --> 00:37:01,796
Speaker 0: And they change so realistically that it's very hard to separate these fake characters from just the way real life goes.

728
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:12,799
Speaker 0: What bothered me, though, is that as a result, when they're in their 30s and then when they're, you know, when they're getting older, I could feel the way I'm going to feel when I'm that age looking back on now.

729
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:13,783
Speaker 0: And I don't like it.

730
00:37:13,803 --> 00:37:20,581
Speaker 0: I don't like it one bit, but I feel like it's it is dead on accurate.

731
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:27,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess at least, you know, in a I don't know, you're feeling old.

732
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:28,842
Speaker 1: Not yet.

733
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:42,720
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that notice how when the adventure stops and when they start leading the mundane lives, the glimmer of hope in the end is that they sort all their shit out and the book clearly ends with them making the rest of their adventures.

734
00:37:42,921 --> 00:37:47,583
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, because it's like, right, they start off right with, well, the thing is, Joe.

735
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:48,227
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:37:48,388 --> 00:37:50,240
Speaker 1: He's always sort of been adventure.

737
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,164
Speaker 1: He's like the hero.

738
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,840
Speaker 1: And Sam is just the sidekick.

739
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:54,261
Speaker 1: Right.

740
00:37:54,542 --> 00:38:00,659
Speaker 0: But, you know, but notice how in the beginning of the book, Joe's adventures are not amazing to him.

741
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:01,423
Speaker 1: Right.

742
00:38:01,504 --> 00:38:01,866
Speaker 1: Exactly.

743
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,780
Speaker 1: They're never really amazing to him at all.

744
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:08,724
Speaker 1: You know, and, you know, at the beginning of the book, a lot of his adventures have already happened.

745
00:38:08,765 --> 00:38:12,800
Speaker 1: You know, his adventures in Prague and whatever, you know, it's sort of like, you know, he's escaped.

746
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,884
Speaker 1: And now he's in the US.

747
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:19,200
Speaker 0: You could have written a whole novel just about him in Prague and his family and the eventual escape.

748
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,337
Speaker 0: And then what happened to the golem?

749
00:38:20,741 --> 00:38:21,002
Speaker 0: Right.

750
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:25,700
Speaker 0: Like if the book had just followed that all the way to the end, it probably would have been a great book anyway.

751
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,824
Speaker 0: But instead it does this thing that's a thousand times better because it was it was just about that.

752
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:34,663
Speaker 1: It would be, you know, sort of like a short, quirky kind of sci fi story.

753
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:36,699
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be, you know, something else.

754
00:38:37,141 --> 00:38:38,929
Speaker 0: I do like how you don't ever like.

755
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:41,160
Speaker 0: you've no idea how the golem got there.

756
00:38:41,541 --> 00:38:47,059
Speaker 0: Like it just kind of comes back at the end, coincidentally parallel to when he starts making his own golems again.

757
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:47,887
Speaker 1: Yeah.

758
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:48,780
Speaker 0: The golem died.

759
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:49,246
Speaker 0: Yeah.

760
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:49,777
Speaker 0: All that stuff.

761
00:38:50,521 --> 00:38:51,344
Speaker 1: Well, that's the thing is.

762
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:55,360
Speaker 1: it's, you know, it's always, you know, really cool how.

763
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:06,720
Speaker 1: I think that a lot of the great sci fi and fantasy books out there are the ones that are, you know, like you look good as good as sci fi fantasy shelves in the store.

764
00:39:06,961 --> 00:39:07,182
Speaker 1: Right.

765
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:07,886
Speaker 1: Think about it.

766
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,440
Speaker 1: Just imagine yourself in a borders or Barnes and Noble.

767
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,741
Speaker 0: All right.

768
00:39:10,822 --> 00:39:14,820
Speaker 1: I'm seeing in front of a in front of a fantasy sci fi shelf.

769
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,764
Speaker 0: Here's what I'm seeing.

770
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:18,500
Speaker 0: I see one, the tableau of forgotten realms.

771
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:22,939
Speaker 0: OK, next to that, I see a bunch of novels with like giant dragons on them.

772
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

773
00:39:23,422 --> 00:39:26,179
Speaker 0: Then I see a bunch of novels like big barbarian sword guys.

774
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:29,680
Speaker 0: And then I see planets with spaceships around.

775
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,021
Speaker 1: All right.

776
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:34,620
Speaker 1: Now, the thing I see, at least from my perspective, right.

777
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:43,500
Speaker 1: The stuff that is like blatant high fantasy, like you open the book, page one tons of dragons and wizards and magic and swords.

778
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,242
Speaker 1: Right.

779
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:47,360
Speaker 1: Or blatant like outer space awesomeness.

780
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,560
Speaker 1: Like you open the first page spacemen and aliens and rockets and lasers and whatever.

781
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:51,902
Speaker 1: Right.

782
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:57,876
Speaker 1: That sort of stuff is typically, you know, the pulp, shallow kind of stuff.

783
00:39:57,998 --> 00:39:58,119
Speaker 1: Right.

784
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:14,303
Speaker 1: But the things that are less overt, you know, not high with their fantasy, not pulp with their sci fi, you know, where, you know, the science fiction elements are more subdued or subtle or perhaps not even, you know, questionable if they even really exist.

785
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:20,247
Speaker 1: or like the fantasy things were like, you know, this book has, you know, sort of fantastic elements.

786
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:23,160
Speaker 1: You know, is this is there really magic in this golem?

787
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,740
Speaker 1: and, you know, all these sorts of things that are sort of impossible.

788
00:40:27,301 --> 00:40:38,099
Speaker 1: But of course, what story is told in such a way that includes those elements without actually, you know, making you think he's in some magical world because it's like they happened, but they didn't really happen.

789
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,460
Speaker 0: Well, at the same time, they weren't magical in the high fantasy sense.

790
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:44,953
Speaker 0: They were magical in the improbable, but not impossible.

791
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:49,540
Speaker 0: events often feel magical or legendary or mythic after the fact.

792
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:52,400
Speaker 0: But when you're actually doing them, they feel much more mundane.

793
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:59,140
Speaker 0: I mean, the fight with Max Schmeling, quote unquote, was just, you know, I got my ass kicked, but later it becomes this mythical.

794
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,560
Speaker 0: I fought with Max Schmeling.

795
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:09,440
Speaker 0: The golem was, you know, if you look at it from a rational perspective, was just this Jewish artifact that they had to smuggle out of the country.

796
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,058
Speaker 0: But after the fact, it becomes this, you know, this was the golem of Prague.

797
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:16,360
Speaker 1: that, you know, I mean, think about Indiana Jones.

798
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:16,722
Speaker 1: Right.

799
00:41:16,843 --> 00:41:20,249
Speaker 1: Other than stuff like, you know, the stuff that happens at the end of the movies.

800
00:41:20,474 --> 00:41:20,740
Speaker 1: Right.

801
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,102
Speaker 1: Yeah.

802
00:41:21,284 --> 00:41:23,180
Speaker 1: Everything that happens before the end of the movie.

803
00:41:23,663 --> 00:41:23,906
Speaker 1: Right.

804
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,120
Speaker 1: It's all completely mundane.

805
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:25,901
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:36,371
Speaker 1: But when you look at it, it really feels like this fantasy adventure almost like there's no way except, you know, the final part, which is absolute complete fantasy.

807
00:41:36,596 --> 00:41:36,780
Speaker 1: Right.

808
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,480
Speaker 1: I've either the first or third movies, so this is sort of the same thing.

809
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:43,723
Speaker 1: Right.

810
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:45,220
Speaker 1: You've got like Houdini.

811
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:45,601
Speaker 1: Right.

812
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:48,880
Speaker 1: You know, Houdini in his day was completely mundane.

813
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:59,183
Speaker 1: But now, you know, nowadays looking back is like a fantastic character, you know, and the same thing with like, you know, what the comic book creators were doing right in their day.

814
00:41:59,465 --> 00:42:02,020
Speaker 1: They were just guys going to work, making comic books.

815
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:11,919
Speaker 1: It wasn't like, you know, but now we look at the history of those comic book creators as if it was some sort of, you know, fantastic, amazing thing when it was just some guys going to work.

816
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:22,239
Speaker 0: One thing I can say the book really did do for me, though, was it made me like I love New York City, but it made me appreciate New York City more than I thought I could.

817
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:31,460
Speaker 1: Well, because I think what it does is it portrays the the fantasy New York that we all, you know, wish for and not at the same time.

818
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:31,885
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

819
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,140
Speaker 0: It portrays the fantasy New York.

820
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,180
Speaker 1: It's like it really, really puts you in that art deco, New York, awesome buildings.

821
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,231
Speaker 1: Everything is great.

822
00:42:39,352 --> 00:42:39,940
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh.

823
00:42:40,081 --> 00:42:44,139
Speaker 0: Kind of setting, but it portrays the fantasy New York like this.

824
00:42:44,701 --> 00:42:51,140
Speaker 0: And yet I'm walking and I look up and there is the Empire State Building because it's exactly the way it was described.

825
00:42:51,200 --> 00:43:03,620
Speaker 1: Well, see, I think that's the thing is that New York, the physicality of much of the buildings and the architecture and the streets and all these sorts of things, you sort of support that fantasy world.

826
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:09,278
Speaker 1: But the totality of the people, it was never really real.

827
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:11,540
Speaker 1: But in the movies, it was it was real.

828
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,256
Speaker 1: But in the real world, it was never 100 percent.

829
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,824
Speaker 1: You know, it was always.

830
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:22,440
Speaker 0: well, it's part of the thing that mythology always comes from the past when, you know, the memories are hazy and you have nostalgia.

831
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:25,620
Speaker 0: It's I think it's a mix of memory and nostalgia.

832
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:29,421
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

833
00:43:29,461 --> 00:43:30,188
Speaker 0: Running out of steam here.

834
00:43:30,712 --> 00:43:34,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just try to remember more the stuff that went on.

835
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,870
Speaker 0: I mean, we could talk about specifics.

836
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,730
Speaker 0: I mean, I think I love the characters.

837
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:51,250
Speaker 0: I love when you get just like all these side characters and they're all just so weird or quirky or quirky in the real human way, like the mad bomber, what bombs with a trident at the bar mitzvah.

838
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

839
00:43:52,212 --> 00:44:03,164
Speaker 0: Or how about, you know, this the Sam's dad, the sideshow, see another larger than life figure who is very mundane, but yet, like in retrospect, gains this mythic quality.

840
00:44:03,347 --> 00:44:03,570
Speaker 1: Right.

841
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:08,474
Speaker 1: And also, you know, the obvious, you know, superheroness of it, you know, relating to the comic books.

842
00:44:08,835 --> 00:44:11,790
Speaker 1: You've got the the old guy who helped him escape with the golem.

843
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,510
Speaker 0: Cornblum is like my Cornblum is I don't know.

844
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,849
Speaker 0: He feels like he should be in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.

845
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,610
Speaker 1: He reminds me of that Russian guy in Ex Machina.

846
00:44:22,116 --> 00:44:23,470
Speaker 0: I like the Russian guy in Ex Machina.

847
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:24,808
Speaker 1: Sort of the same kind of guy.

848
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:30,050
Speaker 1: You know, the old guy is a little bit, but he's totally awesome and he helps you out.

849
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,789
Speaker 1: And yeah, that kind of character.

850
00:44:32,111 --> 00:44:32,372
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:32,714
Speaker 1: Yeah.

852
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,530
Speaker 1: Something I actually hear is something that made me feel kind of stupid.

853
00:44:35,811 --> 00:44:36,052
Speaker 1: Right.

854
00:44:36,534 --> 00:44:43,029
Speaker 1: Towards the end of the book, when, you know, when they compare the when they're at the the congressional hearing or whatever it is.

855
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:43,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

856
00:44:43,572 --> 00:44:54,059
Speaker 1: And they draw the comparison between, you know, he always draw, he always, you know, put every every book he worked on, he put in his he put in a sidekick and he was, you know, totally gay.

857
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:55,270
Speaker 1: And they draw that out.

858
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,017
Speaker 1: And it's like and like.

859
00:44:57,037 --> 00:45:00,229
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, wow, why did I not ever realize that?

860
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:02,970
Speaker 1: That's sort of obvious.

861
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:08,629
Speaker 1: But so when, you know, the congressman came out with that one, I was like, oh, wow, how did I not see that obvious thing there?

862
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:10,013
Speaker 0: I don't know.

863
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:12,993
Speaker 0: I guess, you know, I went into the book like I didn't even read the back cover.

864
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:14,349
Speaker 0: I just dove right into it.

865
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,233
Speaker 1: I didn't read the back cover.

866
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:15,594
Speaker 0: I was.

867
00:45:15,614 --> 00:45:22,189
Speaker 0: I was 100 percent sure he was gay from the moment he was in the steam house with his dad.

868
00:45:22,771 --> 00:45:25,570
Speaker 0: It was like, well, he's gay.

869
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:26,400
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

870
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:27,009
Speaker 0: Wow.

871
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:28,637
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, I didn't.

872
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:31,630
Speaker 1: when I first read it, like I didn't, you know, go back to the.

873
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,290
Speaker 1: you know, when I got to the end and I went I didn't think back to the steam house.

874
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:39,065
Speaker 1: But now that I know you just said it, I was like, oh, I did like.

875
00:45:39,446 --> 00:45:50,130
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a typical almost cliche thing to do when after the hearing and, you know, they take him, Joe and they take him out and get him a drink and they're like, yeah, that sucks.

876
00:45:50,592 --> 00:45:51,155
Speaker 0: And he looks at him.

877
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:54,070
Speaker 0: He's like, you guys didn't act really surprised at all.

878
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,729
Speaker 0: And they're both like, seriously?

879
00:45:58,371 --> 00:45:58,719
Speaker 0: Yeah.

880
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,109
Speaker 0: Really?

881
00:46:02,251 --> 00:46:02,371
Speaker 1: OK.

882
00:46:03,454 --> 00:46:09,251
Speaker 1: I know this book is quite epicness, but you know, because if you're listening, you've read it.

883
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:14,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one of the rare books I could definitely read again at least one more time in my life.

884
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:15,749
Speaker 1: I got to read it again because I read it.

885
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:19,990
Speaker 1: And I was like, this is better and more up my alley than any book I've ever read.

886
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:30,053
Speaker 0: But I've only read it once simply because I've been, you know, I do know, I would like to hear the perspective of someone reading it who doesn't know about comic books or Jews or New York City.

887
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:30,334
Speaker 1: Yeah.

888
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:39,192
Speaker 1: You know, that's something is like everyone I know who's read it or talked about comic books and Jews was either a Jew or a comic book reader or a New York person.

889
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:42,186
Speaker 1: Or, you know, I've never really you know, it's like.

890
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:43,819
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of people reading this book.

891
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:44,690
Speaker 1: It's very popular.

892
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:51,591
Speaker 1: But like it's all been New York, Jews, comic book people or some combination of the three.

893
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:51,993
Speaker 1: Right.

894
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:56,792
Speaker 1: I've never seen someone reading this book or, you know, met someone who's read the book.

895
00:46:57,374 --> 00:47:03,409
Speaker 1: And I've known they read the book who is no, not New York at all, not Jewish at all, not comic book at all.

896
00:47:03,871 --> 00:47:04,093
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:12,370
Speaker 1: And I would like to really I would really like to know what that kind of person would would get from the book, you know, because like there's all sorts of things that they probably wouldn't recognize.

898
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:21,989
Speaker 1: You know, they really you know, they might not have a really good, you know, concept of like what the Empire State Building like really looks like and what it's like to be there at the same time.

899
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:33,174
Speaker 0: That might make the book feel even more epic, because if you haven't seen it, the way it's described is so kind of amazing and magical in and of itself that it kind of draws you into the world.

900
00:47:33,195 --> 00:47:37,880
Speaker 0: And then if you go to New York later, you'd probably have the revelation of, wow, it's really like.

901
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,048
Speaker 1: that is definitely you know, it's.

902
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:52,230
Speaker 1: Whenever you read a book that's about things you're familiar with, right, it's sort of like when they say Grand Central, right, I know exactly what Grand Central looks like down to like many minute details.

903
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:57,610
Speaker 1: So if a book says you're in Grand Central, right, I was like, oh, I know exactly what you know, I'd say perfect.

904
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,011
Speaker 1: Right.

905
00:47:58,533 --> 00:48:11,490
Speaker 1: But someone else who doesn't, you know, might not have been there ever just thinks of some amazing train station and it gives them more room in the imagination department, you know, and there's something to be said for both there.

906
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:19,846
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's it's a different experience and and, you know, reading it depending on your previous knowledge, you know, gives you a different.

907
00:48:20,308 --> 00:48:26,949
Speaker 1: you know, you're going to take something different away from that scene in Grand Central based on your familiarity with the the setting and such.

908
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:38,933
Speaker 1: And not just the setting, there are other things, too, to be familiar with, you know, like there's the the whole bar mitzvah thing, it's like, you know, being familiar with the bar mitzvah and that culture and those type of people, you take something different away.

909
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:41,410
Speaker 1: That guy is familiar with the history of comic books.

910
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:42,455
Speaker 1: You take something different away.

911
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:50,270
Speaker 1: The thing is pretty much everything in this book, except for the sort of freaky art scene I'm very familiar with.

912
00:48:50,330 --> 00:49:04,250
Speaker 0: The thing is that art scene, like if I had to have a favorite part of the book, it's the whole part where they're kind of immersed in and around like the vitality of youth and they're in that art scene just doing crazy crap all the time.

913
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,249
Speaker 0: And Rosa Sacks is possibly the most attractive person in a novel ever.

914
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:09,374
Speaker 1: I don't know.

915
00:49:09,454 --> 00:49:09,696
Speaker 1: I see.

916
00:49:09,736 --> 00:49:11,910
Speaker 1: I didn't think she was so like attractive.

917
00:49:12,251 --> 00:49:13,302
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, like, look at me.

918
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,589
Speaker 0: Who who have I been attracted to my entire life?

919
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:17,975
Speaker 0: Arty girls.

920
00:49:18,398 --> 00:49:19,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like Arty girls, too.

921
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:21,112
Speaker 0: Right.

922
00:49:21,152 --> 00:49:22,109
Speaker 0: Sacks is an Arty girl.

923
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:22,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

924
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:23,735
Speaker 1: But, you know, I didn't.

925
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:27,857
Speaker 1: she didn't come across as, you know, like, oh, man, I want some of that.

926
00:49:27,939 --> 00:49:28,608
Speaker 1: It was just like, yep.

927
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:30,184
Speaker 1: She's, you know, the girl.

928
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:31,432
Speaker 1: All right.

929
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:33,449
Speaker 0: Oh, huh.

930
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:35,509
Speaker 0: Is it maybe Tracy's more up your alley?

931
00:49:36,614 --> 00:49:37,489
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.

932
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,152
Speaker 1: I don't know.

933
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:45,508
Speaker 0: I felt that Rosa was portrayed early on in this painfully sensual way, but there might have just been me reading into it.

934
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:46,072
Speaker 1: Yeah.

935
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:47,566
Speaker 1: Her dad's kind of kind of awesome.

936
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,286
Speaker 0: Longman, Harkoo.

937
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:49,811
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:49:51,195 --> 00:49:55,630
Speaker 0: But that I that is what I want life to be like.

939
00:49:56,092 --> 00:50:02,115
Speaker 0: And I guess that is what I'd like to live the life of a long, but that's what made the end of the book so full of like.

940
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:09,410
Speaker 0: the end of the book was just nothing but driving desperate melancholy until the very, very end when the golem arrives.

941
00:50:09,731 --> 00:50:10,012
Speaker 1: Yeah.

942
00:50:10,313 --> 00:50:20,149
Speaker 0: Like it was to the point to where I remember resolving to myself as I was reading it that I will never have my life have a chapter that is like the end of this novel.

943
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,418
Speaker 1: I don't have a chapter.

944
00:50:22,438 --> 00:50:24,229
Speaker 1: that's like any chapters of this novel.

945
00:50:25,172 --> 00:50:27,809
Speaker 1: I'll take any one I can get, even, you know, the bad ones.

946
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,776
Speaker 1: It's it's all right.

947
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:30,150
Speaker 0: I don't know.

948
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:33,150
Speaker 0: I could do without the living a boring life in suburbia part.

949
00:50:33,891 --> 00:50:34,495
Speaker 1: OK, maybe.

950
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:36,348
Speaker 1: But I mean, I'm almost doing it now.

951
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:39,328
Speaker 1: But see, even that boring life in suburbia.

952
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,972
Speaker 1: Right.

953
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:49,310
Speaker 1: It was it was a much it was a suburbia from an older time that was portrayed in sort of a very nostalgic way of, you know, going down to the drugstore and buying comic books.

954
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:50,869
Speaker 0: I didn't see this nostalgic at all.

955
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,883
Speaker 0: It would only be nostalgic to me that people who were nostalgic in the meta perspective from that for that.

956
00:50:55,903 --> 00:50:56,310
Speaker 0: Exactly.

957
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:56,610
Speaker 1: Right.

958
00:50:56,671 --> 00:51:01,253
Speaker 0: Because reading it, I was, you know, it's portrayed through the view of the characters.

959
00:51:01,596 --> 00:51:03,670
Speaker 0: So they're nostalgic for the awesome time.

960
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:04,733
Speaker 0: Yeah.

961
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:08,990
Speaker 1: But the it's that, you know, the childhood of what's the kid's name?

962
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:10,232
Speaker 1: I forget.

963
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:20,009
Speaker 1: But, you know, that the kid's life during that suburban time, you know, is is nostalgic to people who, you know, think about that, you know, it's sort of a.

964
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:24,870
Speaker 0: Well, that's because it's sort of a Christmas story for young Thomas.

965
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,135
Speaker 0: The second time is Thomas.

966
00:51:26,315 --> 00:51:29,690
Speaker 0: That's going to be the larger than life.

967
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:35,769
Speaker 0: You know, his look at his childhood, that whole era was mundane to the parents because they're living mundane lives now.

968
00:51:36,112 --> 00:51:39,210
Speaker 0: And it's the present for them and they're nostalgic for the adventures of youth.

969
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:51,135
Speaker 0: Joe jumping off of the Empire State Building with a rubber band and him like sneaking around New York and all that stuff he was doing and go into the comic books and his dad being a comic artist.

970
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:57,969
Speaker 0: Those are going to be his cavalier and clay escapist adventures and his nostalgia and his myth when he's older looking back.

971
00:51:58,231 --> 00:51:58,453
Speaker 1: Yep.

972
00:51:59,037 --> 00:52:00,790
Speaker 0: But the nostalgia wasn't there in the book.

973
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:12,247
Speaker 0: All the book did was show you that, look, his nostalgia is going to be in the future and the cycle repeats and the every generation's nostalgia and all that sort of symbolic cycling forever and ever.

974
00:52:13,251 --> 00:52:18,748
Speaker 0: The major symbolism, though, is all the people who get to keep their lives like that the whole time are long and hard coups.

975
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,195
Speaker 1: Yeah.

976
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:23,730
Speaker 1: The major symbolism in the book, though, is always escapism.

977
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:26,360
Speaker 1: You know, it's just everything is always.

978
00:52:26,641 --> 00:52:30,028
Speaker 1: he just throws that escape metaphor in wherever he can get it.

979
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:40,710
Speaker 1: You know, Houdini escapism, comic book escapism, conformity, the character that come up with is the escapist, you know, just all the way through.

980
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:49,090
Speaker 0: It's always literally physically, metaphorically and spiritually escape from a lot of things, both forward, backward and also inward.

981
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:52,670
Speaker 1: It's just constant escape over and over and over and over again.

982
00:52:53,191 --> 00:52:55,163
Speaker 1: You know, it is just that's.

983
00:52:55,546 --> 00:52:56,210
Speaker 1: that's where it's at.

984
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:01,594
Speaker 1: I mean, if you there's a there's some comic books from Dark Horse, there's, you know, the escapist.

985
00:53:01,936 --> 00:53:03,023
Speaker 1: I forget what they actually.

986
00:53:03,063 --> 00:53:04,190
Speaker 1: there's two series, right?

987
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,732
Speaker 1: There's one that is a miniseries by Brian K. Vaughan.

988
00:53:07,873 --> 00:53:10,650
Speaker 1: You know, I think it's just called The Escapists.

989
00:53:11,193 --> 00:53:13,210
Speaker 1: And that's sort of based on this novel.

990
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:14,075
Speaker 1: And it's really good.

991
00:53:14,095 --> 00:53:16,550
Speaker 1: I have the first issue of it, but I was never able to get that.

992
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:17,455
Speaker 1: I don't think they made a trade.

993
00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:20,332
Speaker 1: I think they get the hardcover, which is annoying, but I'm going to get it.

994
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:28,952
Speaker 1: And then I think there's another one that is actually like the adventures of the escapist, which is, you know, is the comic books that they were drawing.

995
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:35,749
Speaker 1: You know, the guy with the black suit and the big key on his chest going around, you know, escaping and fighting bad guys.

996
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:42,010
Speaker 1: So those are the two comic books that Dark Horse put out based on this book here.

997
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:42,714
Speaker 1: Yeah.

998
00:53:42,754 --> 00:53:43,888
Speaker 1: So you are aware of them.

999
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:45,919
Speaker 0: Actually, I think it looks like they're.

1000
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:48,541
Speaker 0: I see all this talk about a movie, but I'm just going to ignore that.

1001
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:49,009
Speaker 1: I'm right.

1002
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:51,068
Speaker 1: Basically, they were going to make a movie and they didn't.

1003
00:53:51,772 --> 00:53:52,419
Speaker 1: Don't worry about it.

1004
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,449
Speaker 0: It looks like they also made.

1005
00:53:53,991 --> 00:53:56,589
Speaker 0: Well, actually, Chavon made The Escapists comic books.

1006
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:57,034
Speaker 1: Right.

1007
00:53:57,075 --> 00:53:57,237
Speaker 1: Right.

1008
00:53:57,278 --> 00:53:57,419
Speaker 1: Right.

1009
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,190
Speaker 1: That's what I was talking about.

1010
00:53:58,210 --> 00:53:58,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1011
00:53:58,774 --> 00:53:58,975
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1012
00:53:59,016 --> 00:54:01,010
Speaker 1: Just ignore all that movie crap.

1013
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:01,454
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

1014
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:02,910
Speaker 0: We're really only talking about the book here.

1015
00:54:03,051 --> 00:54:03,295
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1016
00:54:03,722 --> 00:54:04,149
Speaker 1: Read the book.

1017
00:54:04,691 --> 00:54:06,050
Speaker 0: The book is absolutely amazing.

1018
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:06,936
Speaker 1: You've read the book.

1019
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,169
Speaker 0: You should have read the book.

1020
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,237
Speaker 0: I assume you've read the book.

1021
00:54:09,257 --> 00:54:10,425
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we just ruined the whole thing.

1022
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:12,496
Speaker 1: That's all right.

1023
00:54:12,516 --> 00:54:13,324
Speaker 1: All right.

1024
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:15,310
Speaker 0: Do we have anything else to say?

1025
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:16,303
Speaker 0: I think we should wrap it up.

1026
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:16,648
Speaker 0: OK.

1027
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:19,550
Speaker 0: But I don't think we should announce the next book club book yet.

1028
00:54:20,071 --> 00:54:20,758
Speaker 1: You have to choose.

1029
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:21,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I chose this one.

1030
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:22,799
Speaker 0: And I will choose.

1031
00:54:23,204 --> 00:54:23,650
Speaker 1: Choose now.

1032
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:25,037
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

1033
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:26,469
Speaker 1: I had to choose right now.

1034
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:27,697
Speaker 0: You make me choose on the spot.

1035
00:54:27,718 --> 00:54:29,089
Speaker 0: I'm going to pick something that no one's going to read.

1036
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:30,790
Speaker 0: I'm going to pick like The Odyssey.

1037
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:32,697
Speaker 1: That's no good.

1038
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,110
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

1039
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,110
Speaker 0: The Odyssey is one of the greatest works of literature ever.

1040
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:38,649
Speaker 1: I didn't say The Odyssey is not good.

1041
00:54:38,891 --> 00:54:42,150
Speaker 1: I said it's no good as a choice for the book club.

1042
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:42,588
Speaker 0: Why not?

1043
00:54:45,192 --> 00:54:48,590
Speaker 1: Because what are you going to say about The Odyssey and the book club?

1044
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:49,757
Speaker 0: I got stuff to say.

1045
00:54:49,939 --> 00:54:51,109
Speaker 1: I like Cyclopses.

1046
00:54:52,412 --> 00:54:53,430
Speaker 0: But nobody likes Cyclify.

1047
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:54,609
Speaker 1: I like Cyclify.

1048
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,850

1054
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:35,249
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights and Thursdays are the catch alls for various rants and tomfoolery.
