1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,388
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 8th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:10,549
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:13,798
Speaker 1: I'm Emily.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,067
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,126 --> 00:00:19,839
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are going to review Star Trek Lower Decks.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:31,919
Speaker 0: So yeah, a bunch of things kind of came together in terms of Emily and I both just really diving into Star Trek or back into Star Trek as it were.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was basically kind of a pandemic thing for us and I forget kind of how it started.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,897
Speaker 1: I mean, you were watching Netflix.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,060
Speaker 0: Netflix had all the old Star Treks and I rewatched some choice TNG episodes.

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,384
Speaker 1: You were watching Voyager.

11
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:48,210
Speaker 1: I remember because that was like we.

12
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:50,740
Speaker 1: we were cooped up inside during the pandemic.

13
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:52,604
Speaker 1: We have an exercise bike.

14
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:53,848
Speaker 1: So it's like we.

15
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:58,700
Speaker 1: we talk about our bike shows, which are typically shows we don't pay a lot of attention to.

16
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:04,640
Speaker 1: We've maybe seen before or they're like kind of low concentration type of shows.

17
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,340
Speaker 1: And we watch them while we're on the exercise bike.

18
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:16,120
Speaker 1: And I want to say you were watching through Voyager and I'd come out tapa tapa tapa to watch like choice episodes with you.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,405
Speaker 1: But I didn't like super.

20
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:18,027
Speaker 1: follow it.

21
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:21,259
Speaker 1: But it was around when you were watching DS9.

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,021
Speaker 1: You're like.

23
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:25,317
Speaker 1: you started watching DS9 and then I was like, I want to watch DS9 too.

24
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,433
Speaker 0: Because DS9 was the one that I had not seen all of it.

25
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,080
Speaker 0: now that we watched it all.

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:33,946
Speaker 0: And this isn't about DS9.

27
00:01:33,966 --> 00:01:34,751
Speaker 0: It's the animation day.

28
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,400
Speaker 0: But I had only actually seen episodes from like the last couple of seasons of DS9 before.

29
00:01:42,821 --> 00:01:44,566
Speaker 0: So I hadn't seen most of that beginning stuff.

30
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:48,498
Speaker 1: You were like, I remember that it's the Star Trek that came on after TNG.

31
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,047
Speaker 1: And I was always sleepy during it.

32
00:01:51,147 --> 00:01:51,910
Speaker 1: So I'd fall asleep.

33
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:53,979
Speaker 1: But I remember that there was a war.

34
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:56,000
Speaker 1: And it was like the war of Star Trek.

35
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 0: And there were a bunch of Cardassians, but I couldn't quite tell them all apart.

36
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,600
Speaker 0: And there was flaky people with problems.

37
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,479
Speaker 1: The flaky guy, flaky Odo.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,300
Speaker 0: But even then, Weyoun was an absolute treasure.

39
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,479
Speaker 1: Well, by treasure, you mean squish this like a bug.

40
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,558
Speaker 0: Squish that like a bug.

41
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:16,360
Speaker 0: Among all that backdrop, like Paramount happened and everything.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,340
Speaker 0: And Star Trek got its discovery reboot a while back that at least the first time I tried to watch that, I bounced off of.

43
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,120
Speaker 0: But when Lower Decks came out in 2020, so in the pandemic when we were home with a lot of free time.

44
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:36,340
Speaker 0: I feel like it wasn't just us, but a lot of people either got into Star Trek for the first time because of Lower Decks.

45
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,960
Speaker 0: Or got back into Star Trek because of Lower Decks.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,960
Speaker 0: Because it was kind of like this breath of fresh air on what I like about Star Trek.

47
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:51,900
Speaker 1: So it's kind of funny because I want to say Lower Decks really kicked off that pandemic Star Trek revisiting.

48
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,460
Speaker 1: Because we watched both the new Trek and like the whole thing with Discovery and everything.

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:03,220
Speaker 1: But we really started to more do the 90s Trek and that was because of Lower Decks.

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,860
Speaker 1: And the great thing about Lower Decks is I started to watch it when I was way less familiar with a lot of the references it made.

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,500
Speaker 1: It's very dense with inside jokes.

52
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:19,680
Speaker 1: But fortunately it's also fine to show somebody who's kind of new to Star Trek.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Speaker 1: Because you don't really need to get these references in order to like enjoy what it has to say in terms of like the plot of the episode.

54
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,240
Speaker 0: They're almost more like Easter eggs like if you know.

55
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,098
Speaker 1: If you know you know.

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,085
Speaker 1: But that's the thing it's like.

57
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:38,900
Speaker 1: so watching the first season and the second season.

58
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:42,718
Speaker 1: Before I really got caught up before I watched all of DS9.

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,640
Speaker 1: And you know I'd watched a lot of TOS and a bunch of episodes of The Next Generation.

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,818
Speaker 1: But I hadn't seen any of Voyager or DS9.

61
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,379
Speaker 1: So it's like there were a lot of things that kind of flew over my head.

62
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,220
Speaker 1: And then coming back and watching some of those episodes is really really funny.

63
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:06,200
Speaker 1: Because you get all these like just little asides that you never get before.

64
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:11,980
Speaker 1: So it is incredibly good for fanboys and girls.

65
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:18,220
Speaker 1: But it's also you don't have to be a superfan in order to get what it's doing.

66
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,779
Speaker 0: Yup and I guess unlike because I like TNG it was a good show.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,340
Speaker 0: But first couple of seasons were pretty rocky and the episodes are pretty hit or miss.

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,120
Speaker 0: But also because of the old style of TV a lot of old Star Treks are a little bit plodding.

69
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:34,907
Speaker 0: Like they're kind of slow.

70
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,294
Speaker 0: The writing is very 90s.

71
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,860
Speaker 0: Interesting plot threads or ideas kind of get dropped.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,100
Speaker 0: You know Star Trek just was a product of its time.

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,940
Speaker 0: And Lower Decks is very much a modern television show and a modern cartoon.

74
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,907
Speaker 1: I would definitely say that it.

75
00:04:51,509 --> 00:04:54,060
Speaker 1: you know this might almost be a criticism of it.

76
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,980
Speaker 1: But it definitely has that animation pacing.

77
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,300
Speaker 1: Where it has incredibly fast dialogue.

78
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,865
Speaker 1: It's very rapid fire.

79
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:07,960
Speaker 1: There's like things are jumping around pretty pretty quickly.

80
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:12,813
Speaker 1: There you know with animation often you're not going to.

81
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,280
Speaker 1: you know on the script stage.

82
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:20,360
Speaker 1: When you're editing the scripts you're not going to want to keep in extraneous material.

83
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:24,900
Speaker 1: Because it costs so much per minute per second of animation.

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,545
Speaker 1: That you're kind of like.

85
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:31,120
Speaker 1: okay how can we really condense this to be very tight.

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,520
Speaker 1: And like you know what was the thing with Conan O'Brien was writing for the Simpsons.

87
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,500
Speaker 1: Yeah they had like a metric per minute about gags per minute.

88
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,020
Speaker 1: And like how you know and because this really is a comedy.

89
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,160
Speaker 1: Although it does have the occasional poignant moment.

90
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:51,940
Speaker 1: It's definitely you know comedy animation.

91
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:59,440
Speaker 1: So it's very dense with those like hitting them with the laughs kind of moments.

92
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 1: And so it's it's kind of frenetic.

93
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:05,379
Speaker 1: I showed it to my parents and they really liked it.

94
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:08,540
Speaker 1: But like my mom said wow everybody talks really fast.

95
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,820
Speaker 0: Well compare that to like TNG where not only did it have a lot of just atmospheric shots.

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,780
Speaker 0: And like long panning shots of nothing with just like light music in the background.

97
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,679
Speaker 0: But it was partly because they were padding out for TV and ads and that long time slot that it would be in.

98
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,160
Speaker 1: Yeah definitely this does not have that kind of buffer.

99
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,200
Speaker 1: It's just a 23 minute kind of regular TV animation length.

100
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,327
Speaker 1: They even kind of lampshade the whole.

101
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:40,600
Speaker 1: you know they talk really fast and everybody is really high energy.

102
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:46,860
Speaker 1: And there's a crossover episode in the recent season where it was Strange New Worlds.

103
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:53,940
Speaker 0: That episode is one of the better episodes of Star Trek as a whole that is out there.

104
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,420
Speaker 1: And it's very funny because it's like you look at the voice actors during interviews and stuff.

105
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,419
Speaker 1: And by the way the voice acting is great.

106
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,500
Speaker 1: Tawny Newsome I think is her name the one who who is the voice for Mariner.

107
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,120
Speaker 1: But she's really really funny.

108
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:13,400
Speaker 1: But they don't really look like their characters.

109
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:17,500
Speaker 1: But they look like their characters enough to be believable.

110
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:24,260
Speaker 1: Like if you put them in the costume and they really when they're in live action.

111
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:32,100
Speaker 1: You know the two of them kind of sell that they are the live action version of their animated characters.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,012
Speaker 0: That fast paced level of.

113
00:07:35,032 --> 00:07:36,540
Speaker 0: I am a cartoon band.

114
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,880
Speaker 1: Yes so they're very like expressive and like I just remember the one where Boimler is walking down the hall.

115
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,860
Speaker 1: And he's just like really awkward and he does this really funny wobbly kind of walk.

116
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:57,180
Speaker 1: And it was just like hysterical because it was such the same kind of movement that his animated version would be doing.

117
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,360
Speaker 1: So I think that was an interesting thing to see how that kind of style of delivery.

118
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:11,280
Speaker 1: And those kind of characters and the voice actors themselves translated over into the live action Star Trek universe.

119
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,760
Speaker 0: Yeah it also comes around the same time where we've got Strange New Worlds and we've got Lower Decks.

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,140
Speaker 0: And they both are very much a little bit of a breath of fresh air into making Star Trek.

121
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,398
Speaker 0: I don't want to say like fun or more fun than it used to be.

122
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:34,480
Speaker 0: But more like the Star Trek universe has expanded to cover a lot of different styles and a lot of different types of stories.

123
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:44,380
Speaker 0: But it moved back to this very episodic closed story which was the opposite of what DS9 edged into and then Discovery just embraced wholly.

124
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,854
Speaker 1: Yeah but the nice thing is it keeps the Star Trek thing even though it's episodic.

125
00:08:50,034 --> 00:08:52,180
Speaker 1: it does have seasonal arcs.

126
00:08:52,741 --> 00:09:00,360
Speaker 1: And it does have character development which is important I think in that like it's not everything resets every episode.

127
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:09,360
Speaker 1: There are aspects of the characters where they're kind of learning from their mistakes and maturing.

128
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,677
Speaker 1: Because it's interesting because they're all like what in their 20s.

129
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,059
Speaker 1: They're definitely post college even though it feels more like especially in the early seasons.

130
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,590
Speaker 0: They're relatively fresh out of the academy.

131
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,815
Speaker 0: They're incense now.

132
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,000
Speaker 0: They've got their first assignments.

133
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,528
Speaker 0: What was the pitch to make the show.

134
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:34,719
Speaker 0: when McMahon first proposed it was, I'm quoting here, "The people who put the yellow cartridge in the food replicator so a banana can come out of the other

135
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:34,899
Speaker 0: end.".

136
00:09:35,465 --> 00:09:36,659
Speaker 0: I want a show about that.

137
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,188
Speaker 1: And that's something that I always wanted more from.

138
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:47,940
Speaker 1: like science fiction and superhero shows and like all the fantastical kind of stuff that happens.

139
00:09:48,961 --> 00:10:01,680
Speaker 1: The interesting thing is at its core like Star Trek is kind of a naval story as well as like you know exploration and daring do especially like the early shows.

140
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:09,160
Speaker 1: But there is a military aspect of it even though it's like peaceful military usually.

141
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,985
Speaker 0: Well there's always that divide of Star Trek.

142
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:16,080
Speaker 0: either has the ships are out there doing exploration but they run into dangerous situations.

143
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,945
Speaker 0: They have to be able to deal with them but separately.

144
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:23,160
Speaker 0: the universe is dangerous and occasionally like the Klingons try to kill them and the Dominion War happens.

145
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,706
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of diplomatic stuff that's happening.

146
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:31,560
Speaker 1: but really it's kind of like watching the grunts on a navy ship or something like that.

147
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:41,240
Speaker 1: But a very nice navy ship where like you know extrapolated into the future where it's not as like you know dehumanizing and stuff like that.

148
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,788
Speaker 1: So it's basically like lower deckers.

149
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:55,420
Speaker 1: They're kind of like in a college dorm situation where everybody's got bunk beds and they're all trying to figure out when their shifts are.

150
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,819
Speaker 0: And the senior officers never tell them anything about what the hell's going on.

151
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:10,140
Speaker 1: They're always like since they're their lower ranks they're always kind of left in the dark or about the higher level logistics of various conflicts and stuff like that.

152
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,043
Speaker 1: So I really like that vibe.

153
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:27,360
Speaker 1: I'm very much a fan of like you know college stories or you know also it brings in a little like I said a little bit of military story where you've got like a band of people in the same unit who are like trying to make things work.

154
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:30,509
Speaker 0: That has also been a hallmark of most Star Treks.

155
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:32,675
Speaker 0: Like think about both Next Generation and DS9.

156
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:39,420
Speaker 0: All you know the Star Trek plot is happening in the background or whatever nonsense is going on.

157
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:50,100
Speaker 0: But a lot of the screen time in both of those shows except when they're in the middle of a two-parter or like an arc is like Diana Troy's got some personal business going on.

158
00:11:50,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Speaker 0: Or like Worf and Geordi are beefing about something and it's more about the people and their relationships in the context of a science fiction future than it is about the story itself.

159
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,863
Speaker 1: Honestly Star Trek.

160
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:09,720
Speaker 1: you know the technical science part of it is often just like made up word salad.

161
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,460
Speaker 0: Something something metreon particles.

162
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,575
Speaker 0: Emily's submitting metreon particles.

163
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:15,219
Speaker 0: Watch out.

164
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,438
Speaker 1: But it's definitely like you know they've got this techno babble.

165
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,060
Speaker 1: But really when it starts Star Trek at its best is about culture clashes.

166
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:35,380
Speaker 1: It's about like diplomatic relations between various various planets and various cultures.

167
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:45,920
Speaker 1: And it's about human and humanoid relationships like you know a Vulcan and a human coming from very different viewpoints but managing to make it work.

168
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,385
Speaker 1: And those kind of you know.

169
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:54,200
Speaker 1: it takes the relationship between humans and then adds another dimension because they're not all humans.

170
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,500
Speaker 1: And I think that you know that's part of what the multiculturalism of Star Trek is when it's at its best.

171
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,502
Speaker 0: Hey we had a quote here.

172
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:11,260
Speaker 0: so Mike McMahon one of the executive producers who developed the show had said that they were inspired specifically by the next generation.

173
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:19,580
Speaker 0: And Kurtzman there's this whole interview you can read where they basically said a story in a typical Star Trek episode would take place in the background of a Lower Decks episode.

174
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,500
Speaker 0: So quote huge crazy crazy shit is going on in the background and that's super peripheral to the story you're actually focusing on.

175
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:33,580
Speaker 1: I mean often they will intersect like there will be something that you know puts the ship in danger.

176
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:42,760
Speaker 1: But then the main characters of Lower Decks have to be like oh I'm stuck in a Jefferies tube trying to figure out this engineering thing.

177
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,820
Speaker 1: It's not like oh if I fail then everything is lost.

178
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,220
Speaker 1: It's more like we all have a part to play and we all have to work together otherwise we'll be in danger.

179
00:13:53,761 --> 00:14:02,699
Speaker 1: And so it's kind of like it's not just the decisions of the captain that affect the outcomes of these perilous adventures that Star Trek ships go on.

180
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,587
Speaker 0: Now what's cool too is the show echoes.

181
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:12,000
Speaker 0: it brings a bunch of things from the old Star Trek animated series which probably isn't worth watching.

182
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:24,300
Speaker 0: But they basically because it's animated they bring in a lot of the non-human characters that were hard to do with costumes or had never been done with costumes before because it would be too annoying.

183
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:25,422
Speaker 1: Or Dr.

184
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:25,684
Speaker 1: Miglimo.

185
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:38,080
Speaker 1: So like you can get these anthropomorphic characters which would be a pretty big I mean in modern Trek they do have a lot of good prosthetics.

186
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,606
Speaker 1: They have really a lot more they can do with computer animation.

187
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:48,840
Speaker 1: but it's like okay it costs a lot to do live-action tracking of like you know an alien face.

188
00:14:49,281 --> 00:15:01,620
Speaker 1: Whereas in Lower Decks you've got like a cat person who fully emotes and like is jumping off the walls and like using the big security officer as like a climbing post and stuff like that.

189
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,677
Speaker 1: Oh man it's so funny because she's so angry horny all the time.

190
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:19,220
Speaker 1: She's like this really badass surgeon who's like very very foul-mouthed but like you know they put a lot of like cat mannerisms.

191
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,479
Speaker 0: I mean having sexy crime play with the safeties off in the holodeck.

192
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,152
Speaker 0: She's like I want to go rob a bank in the holodeck.

193
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:30,580
Speaker 1: That's my idea of a hot date.

194
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:40,280
Speaker 0: But also this is the first Star Trek I think I'd ever seen where it acted like the rest of Star Trek had happened.

195
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,020
Speaker 0: Like the thing that always bothered me about later episodes of TNG and a lot of Deep Space Nine is like crazy stuff would happen.

196
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,840
Speaker 0: And either people wouldn't acknowledge how significant those ramifications are and they'd just be forgotten in the next episode and never brought up again.

197
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:59,529
Speaker 0: Or like oh a mirror universe and no one can figure it out.

198
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,640
Speaker 0: Lower Decks is the show where like the mirror universe is literally in their training because they know it exists.

199
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,130
Speaker 1: Oh this is obviously a mirror universe simulation.

200
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,820
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna pretend to be super evil and horny.

201
00:16:12,602 --> 00:16:14,658
Speaker 1: And that's the interesting thing too.

202
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,720
Speaker 0: The mirror universe canonically is stupid, evil, and horny.

203
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:26,040
Speaker 1: It's like why like bisexuality should not be confined to this like the evil universe.

204
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,645
Speaker 0: My theory is that the mirror universe is not a universe.

205
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:30,426
Speaker 0: It is just.

206
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:40,180
Speaker 0: in any given place there is like this mirror echo of the worst possible outcomes and the horniest, angriest nonsense everywhere.

207
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,915
Speaker 0: It's like everyone's base urges but it's not a parallel dimension.

208
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:43,760
Speaker 0: that's always happening.

209
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,598
Speaker 0: Because every Star Trek that portrays it, it's always weird.

210
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,104
Speaker 0: You know it's a TV show.

211
00:16:49,124 --> 00:16:52,420
Speaker 0: so of course we know why it's this way but it's always weirdly on the nose.

212
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,364
Speaker 0: Like how come in the mirror universe?

213
00:16:54,504 --> 00:17:00,660
Speaker 0: literally every person who is on Deep Space Nine is the same as the people who are on Deep Space Nine in the non-mirror universe.

214
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,200
Speaker 0: Even though there was a... You'd think in the horny angry universe at least one of them would have gotten shot.

215
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,319
Speaker 1: Well cause there's like hundreds of years of lead up to that same evil empire.

216
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:14,300
Speaker 1: Anyway the mirror universe is inconsistent and it's foolish.

217
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,866
Speaker 0: Or it's hyper consistent.

218
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,599
Speaker 0: It's just angry and horny and stupid.

219
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:31,280
Speaker 1: I like your idea that it's like dark echoes of people like everyone will see kind of like the mirror in the snow queen where it shows humanity.

220
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,840
Speaker 1: Like it reflects back like the worst stuff of humanity and like if you look in the mirror you just see your ugliness.

221
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:41,180
Speaker 1: And that's kind of like the whole thing with the snow queen.

222
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,500
Speaker 1: It's like I like the idea that it is a dark mirror and that's all it is and it will just reflect back whatever is going on at any given point in time.

223
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:57,360
Speaker 0: Really it's just that the show like all this like in a TNG episode something crazy would happen and someone gets turned into the equivalent of a doll and that's like the whole plot.

224
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,980
Speaker 0: That just happens in the background of episodes of Lower Dice.

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,787
Speaker 1: I am not a puppet.

226
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:02,917
Speaker 1: Do not play with me.

227
00:18:04,523 --> 00:18:05,264
Speaker 1: Or like.

228
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:12,800
Speaker 1: I forget the name of his culture but the guy who always speaks in metaphors is like Shaco in the Wall.

229
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:29,080
Speaker 1: So I think when I say the show is very meta yes it's got a lot of inside jokes but a big part of it is the characters are aware of Star Trek stuff.

230
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,169
Speaker 1: You know like they're not aware that they're in a TV show.

231
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,920
Speaker 1: It's not that kind of meta where they're like breaking the fourth wall.

232
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,120
Speaker 1: But they are very vers- it's almost like they've read Memory Alpha and they're like okay I know the deal with this.

233
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,503
Speaker 1: But think about it.

234
00:18:45,523 --> 00:18:46,148
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that make sense?

235
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:49,759
Speaker 0: Like if you were in Starfleet- You read Wikipedia about what's been going on.

236
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:55,920
Speaker 0: Boimler is kind of a fanboy about the Borg in the same way that in the real world.

237
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:59,860
Speaker 0: Like I read a lot about NATO military equipment because I just find it interesting.

238
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:07,480
Speaker 1: Oh yeah I know this weird esoteric cold war history stuff and it's like that's how people are when they join Starfleet.

239
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,166
Speaker 1: And it would make a lot more sense where it's not just like.

240
00:19:10,728 --> 00:19:15,720
Speaker 1: I have never heard of this or I've heard of this only in like whispers kind of way.

241
00:19:16,301 --> 00:19:26,020
Speaker 1: It's definitely like everybody acts like not only do the plot points happen, they also bring in characters.

242
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,188
Speaker 1: And so you have a lot of chance for little like Quark.

243
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,858
Speaker 1: I think still my favorite favorite episode was the DS9 episode.

244
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,640
Speaker 0: Having Cura and Quark's real voice actors play the characters.

245
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:44,360
Speaker 0: And also you know we had just watched DS9 and a lot of deep nostalgia for that show again.

246
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:53,520
Speaker 1: But there was like the Voyager episode where they go on to Voyager and they're like preparing it for like a museum piece and stuff like that.

247
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,979
Speaker 1: And so there's a lot of times where having that knowledge will kind of help make it funny.

248
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,052
Speaker 0: But I mean in that episode a Tuvix situation happens.

249
00:20:05,072 --> 00:20:07,180
Speaker 0: If you haven't seen Voyager like don't worry about it.

250
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,100
Speaker 0: But a thing happens and there's a meme you can find if you look up Tuvix.

251
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:14,427
Speaker 0: What would Janeway do?

252
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:14,849
Speaker 0: Murder Tuvix.

253
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:18,898
Speaker 1: And Rim says this.

254
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:25,880
Speaker 0: So in this episode a Tuvix situation happens and they send the person it happened to to their room while they sort it out.

255
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,053
Speaker 0: And they're like we should figure out.

256
00:20:29,073 --> 00:20:30,400
Speaker 0: Janeway dealt with the situation.

257
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,253
Speaker 0: And I say out loud Janeway would fucking kill him.

258
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,539
Speaker 0: Not even think about it.

259
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,959
Speaker 0: And then it cuts to a character.

260
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,877
Speaker 1: The character says pretty much that verbatim.

261
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,574
Speaker 0: Janeway fucking killed him.

262
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:49,460
Speaker 0: Because it's like in this in the Federation wiki like anyone can look it up and everyone on the ship looks it up right away.

263
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,219
Speaker 1: That's the other thing I like about the script of this.

264
00:20:52,580 --> 00:21:02,500
Speaker 1: It is interesting because when it first came out like four years ago ish people were kind of ripping on it that it was a ripoff of Rick and Morty.

265
00:21:02,881 --> 00:21:04,646
Speaker 1: And that same as final space.

266
00:21:04,746 --> 00:21:09,920
Speaker 1: it's like final space and Rick and Morty and Lower Decks.

267
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:18,440
Speaker 1: They're all like oh they're part of that same kind of adult animation and they're all trying to capitalize on the popularity of Rick and Morty.

268
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:26,980
Speaker 1: But I definitely think that Lower Decks even though it might come visually from a little bit of that same.

269
00:21:27,261 --> 00:21:34,780
Speaker 0: Well and Mike McBahn is like he was the head writer for Rick and Morty when they brought him on board.

270
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,469
Speaker 0: But from the beginning he everyone is very clear.

271
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:42,340
Speaker 0: this is not Rick and Morty in a world of Star Trek.

272
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,818
Speaker 0: This is its own show about Star Trek.

273
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,025
Speaker 0: There's some interview where he's like.

274
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:50,720
Speaker 0: you know writers can write different kinds of things guys.

275
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:55,480
Speaker 1: And I think a big thing even though it has a lot.

276
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,200
Speaker 1: You know it's definitely more foul mouth than your typical Star Trek which is very interesting because they bleep it out.

277
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,051
Speaker 1: But like for example the cat doctor she's very like.

278
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:10,560
Speaker 1: you know fuck this fuck that just swearing constantly.

279
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,230
Speaker 1: But it's like bleepity.

280
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,299
Speaker 1: bleep bleep bleep bleep.

281
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,560
Speaker 1: Where's my fucking tricorder?

282
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,428
Speaker 0: Reicher would have said a lot of swear words.

283
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:22,340
Speaker 0: It wasn't 90s American television that his character was portrayed.

284
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:28,640
Speaker 1: Yes, and it it feels a lot of times like the characters they take what?

285
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:38,387
Speaker 1: the character should be saying in an average next-generation episode and they like Say it how a millennial will say.

286
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:48,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, very, you know, just be like, oh my this guy sucks Don't listen to him, you know, it was just very like.

287
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,785
Speaker 1: I don't know.

288
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,090
Speaker 1: it's.

289
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:59,530
Speaker 1: it's not as It's stylized in a different way because it's silly 90s stuff.

290
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:01,358
Speaker 0: It's not our Trek.

291
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:03,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's a different era of story.

292
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:09,690
Speaker 0: I mean every Star Trek set in a different time for a reason Yeah, and thus this one is set like later in the Star Trek timeline.

293
00:23:09,911 --> 00:23:13,930
Speaker 0: So all the other Star Trek's except parts of discovery already happened.

294
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,663
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think you know, I like new Trek.

295
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:21,798
Speaker 1: I didn't really enjoy stranger worlds I enjoyed discovery.

296
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:24,830
Speaker 0: discovery grew on me after they got past the bad Klingons.

297
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:25,551
Speaker 1: Yeah The.

298
00:23:25,611 --> 00:23:27,799
Speaker 1: the first season I just was not into.

299
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:31,933
Speaker 1: I had a lot of thoughts about Klingons and I know that's what the bad fanboys say.

300
00:23:31,974 --> 00:23:33,420
Speaker 1: so I felt really guilty being like.

301
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:53,206
Speaker 1: I hate what they did to the Klingons, but like Yeah, I like Klingons when they're kind of more like funny stabby dwarf guys you know, like they're they're singing and they're drinking their blood wine and there's stabby like.

302
00:23:53,346 --> 00:24:04,608
Speaker 1: they're very like barbar bar bar bar Whereas like I don't want to watch Klingons for court intrigue unless it's the same kind of court entry that quark got involved in.

303
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,157
Speaker 0: Then it's cool The Gauran Martok era.

304
00:24:09,237 --> 00:24:09,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

305
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:09,538
Speaker 1: Yeah.

306
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:13,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I like that kind of Klingon drama like the 90s Klingon drama.

307
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:15,828
Speaker 1: I'm like all here for but like I don't know.

308
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:33,619
Speaker 1: Anyway, one of the things that new Trek I wasn't Sold on until strange new worlds is I didn't find it as funny because TOS is really if you ever watch original Star Trek, it is often just Intentionally really funny.

309
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:40,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and TNG was only occasionally funny Like it often got a little caught up in Picard is acting.

310
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:48,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I found that's the other thing about DS9 was really funny could be incredibly cheesy.

311
00:24:48,471 --> 00:24:56,265
Speaker 1: It could be very overwrought like sometimes there were episodes that were incredibly cringe-inducing Quark just being a little shit all the time.

312
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,230
Speaker 1: I love the little gremlins.

313
00:24:57,712 --> 00:25:02,709
Speaker 1: Some of my friends just hate the little gremlins, but I I cannot deny I love the little gremlins.

314
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:10,430
Speaker 0: Curator is yelling Clark's name in the particular way She would do it which she did when she voice acted in Laura Dax playing her own character.

315
00:25:10,994 --> 00:25:13,108
Speaker 0: That is let lives rent-free in my head quark.

316
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:32,919
Speaker 1: The best part of that though is not just her yelling at him, but quark scream His little girly scream like it's not it's not a deep space 9 Ferengi including episode without a little like a feminist scream of pain or surprise Anger or whatever.

317
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:38,762
Speaker 0: quark is currently expressing um a thing that the show is doing that lower decks is doing.

318
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:41,672
Speaker 0: that I think is very cool that other Star Trek's have always Shied away from.

319
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:51,942
Speaker 0: it's actually sneaking in a lot of low-key world-building around just the Star Trek universe Yeah And exploring things that haven't been explored too much in other ones.

320
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:57,230
Speaker 0: because you got to remember even though it's a cartoon Lord X is you know not to get into the hole.

321
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:06,547
Speaker 0: It is canonical like the Cerritos is as Quote real in the Star Trek universe as the Enterprise.

322
00:26:06,748 --> 00:26:06,989
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

323
00:26:07,552 --> 00:26:14,247
Speaker 0: And it is just still nuts to me to think that this is Expanding the Star Trek universe because I think it's doing a really good job.

324
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,976
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it's not done anything.

325
00:26:17,016 --> 00:26:26,304
Speaker 1: that super is upsetting and breaks Canon in like a really hard way to write Orion's pretty compelling instead of just green tit.

326
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:43,240
Speaker 1: ladies I I really like The way they're doing the stuff with the Orion's cuz that you know That was another part of that ds9 episode was tendy Being from an Orion crime family.

327
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,387
Speaker 1: She's kind of ashamed of it and she's very much like the Person who?

328
00:26:49,010 --> 00:27:03,543
Speaker 1: emigrates and then is really trying to downplay their heritage because they're kind of embarrassed about the stereotypes that other people hold about Orion's and So she's basically like oh, yeah space pirates.

329
00:27:03,763 --> 00:27:05,690
Speaker 1: Oh wouldn't know anything about that.

330
00:27:05,971 --> 00:27:22,850
Speaker 1: But then it when it comes up It's actually really really cool because it's like she knows her stuff and as the show goes on she becomes more comfortable With her, you know kind of using those two aspects of herself.

331
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:24,878
Speaker 1: well, we'll see there's.

332
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:34,730
Speaker 1: there's been a big plot about what's going on with tendy, but I think Like I was gonna say I think one of the main things to recommend the show is its humor.

333
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:43,675
Speaker 0: Another thing is it's is its references Yeah, and it it makes light of some Star Trek tropes But it never.

334
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,430
Speaker 0: it never makes fun of them in a way that it's not cynical.

335
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:50,066
Speaker 0: It's not like a Star Trek used the same cave set over and over again.

336
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:50,870
Speaker 0: It isn't that stupid.

337
00:27:50,930 --> 00:28:03,384
Speaker 0: it's not a cinema sins type of situation, but there is an episode where they're stuck in a cave and Because Star Trek is the way it is Things happen in caves all the time like the same cave is used.

338
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:04,970
Speaker 0: in how many ds9 episodes?

339
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,610
Speaker 0: Yes, and they said one of the episodes Lord X in that same fucking cave.

340
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:24,790
Speaker 1: I think I think that's a really good way to put it though Is it you don't feel like if you're a Star Trek fan at least I don't feel like It's making fun of Star Trek fandom, but it's like poking fun at it in the way.

341
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:38,325
Speaker 1: Somebody who likes something pokes fun at you know Like somebody who likes anime but makes a joke about anime that people who really enjoy anime will definitely like mmm, they'll relate to it's.

342
00:28:38,486 --> 00:28:39,370
Speaker 1: it's more that it's.

343
00:28:40,492 --> 00:28:45,151
Speaker 1: It's something that you're like, oh so true as opposed to oh, man They're.

344
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:50,710
Speaker 1: they're saying it's cheesy and bad and that we should be ashamed of liking it kind of thing.

345
00:28:51,232 --> 00:29:06,210
Speaker 1: So I definitely think also just the way it treats its characters like it does often put them through the ringer in ways that you know be like We're going to test their their metal by you know providing conflict.

346
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:14,709
Speaker 1: but it's also you never feel like the bad stuff that happens to the characters is gratuitous.

347
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:23,476
Speaker 0: or I mean I got invested in their careers like more so than I have with other Star Treks because every other Star Trek It's all captains and senior officers.

348
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:40,842
Speaker 1: Like it's the typical movie TV type thing and this is just some ensigns Yeah, but like you see them Like I said, there was a gradual maturing like Boimler used to be a lot more afraid of things and he's been more capable of taking command in later seasons.

349
00:29:40,983 --> 00:29:49,350
Speaker 1: and bold Boimler You've got a Mariner dealing with some of her PTSD from the Dominion war.

350
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:58,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, I called that because they'd call that the show as soon as it was clear that she knew Worf and said like she'd met Worf on DS9.

351
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:02,800
Speaker 0: Yeah like the show for being an animated cartoon.

352
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,144
Speaker 0: that's kind of making fun of Star Trek.

353
00:30:04,686 --> 00:30:12,132
Speaker 0: it also it Weaves itself very very tightly into the Star Trek Cannon.

354
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:19,870
Speaker 0: like if a date is dropped or some piece of information is revealed It will line up directly to the previous scripts of other Star Treks.

355
00:30:20,292 --> 00:30:30,507
Speaker 0: So it based on what Mariner said you can know for a fact She must have been on DS9 during the Dominion war and that is the plot of season 4 is what happened to her And why is she the way she is?

356
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:48,070
Speaker 1: also, we've got you know, a Canonical pansexual character outside of the mirror universe Even though her last relationship with the with the preppy At least wrote that relationship.

357
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:54,327
Speaker 0: But it wasn't intended to continue but the fans liked it so much and it fit so they wrote it in.

358
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:56,496
Speaker 0: she had a short relationship that was.

359
00:30:56,717 --> 00:31:06,810
Speaker 1: that was good because it was kind of like The kind of thing that they did to throw the shippers a bone because they were like, oh, yeah, that would be fine.

360
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:14,188
Speaker 1: but then when they broke up a lot of my Friends who like sapphic characters they got really sad about it.

361
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:18,962
Speaker 1: It was like I was like, I warned you that they said in an interview.

362
00:31:19,063 --> 00:31:27,024
Speaker 1: It's probably not gonna be a long-term thing so it's That that was hard on some people because they really really shipped it.

363
00:31:27,104 --> 00:31:28,590
Speaker 1: but then you know.

364
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:31,942
Speaker 0: So it goes now a cool thing if you did if you like.

365
00:31:31,963 --> 00:31:40,210
Speaker 0: if you've never seen any Star Trek I feel like this show like the first episode of the show would actually be a good first Star Trek to watch.

366
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,784
Speaker 0: That are the first episode of strange new worlds.

367
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:44,135
Speaker 0: I think those are the two worlds.

368
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:51,790
Speaker 0: Probably I might recommend more because it has strange new worlds is a hell of a first episode.

369
00:31:52,191 --> 00:32:04,047
Speaker 1: Well, it's more about the idea of first contact and it brings in a lot of like I was saying the the culture clash or the idea of alien civilizations talking to each other and the meaning of that.

370
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:15,470
Speaker 0: whereas course the first episode of lower decks is literally called second contact and it introduces like hey Star Trek though prime directive like making contact.

371
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,029
Speaker 0: Well, we're the ship that shows up like the next day.

372
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,890
Speaker 1: So all the actual stuff watch strange new worlds first episode and then you can watch.

373
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:32,690
Speaker 1: And so now you know what Prime prime directive and first contact means and then you watch what happens with second contact.

374
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,948
Speaker 1: It's basically the follow-through and the cleaning up of messes

375
00:32:36,514 --> 00:32:48,309
Speaker 0: and if you want to see Where this show really came from like the core inspiration for it If you didn't know there is an episode of the next generation called lower decks That was low-key the inspiration for lower decks as a show.

376
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah It was one of those high concept episodes where it wasn't about Picard and Worf and Geordi and all those characters.

377
00:32:55,834 --> 00:33:03,324
Speaker 0: It was basically just about these ensigns Very similar to what lower decks is as a show and you see everything from their perspective.

378
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:03,765
Speaker 0: and it was.

379
00:33:04,307 --> 00:33:08,663
Speaker 0: it's widely regarded as one Of the best written and best performed episodes of TNG.

380
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:11,052
Speaker 0: It's season 7 episode 15.

381
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:23,390
Speaker 0: It's just called lower decks and the latest episode of lower decks Directly calls back to this and another TNG episode in a really really fun way that I did not expect.

382
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, it isn't a comedy episode.

383
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:34,870
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty Sad, you know in it, but it's also acknowledging that it's not just about the captains.

384
00:33:35,111 --> 00:33:47,850
Speaker 1: There are real people who are involved in all of these various dramatic Conflicts that happen over the course of Picard's tenure as captain of the Enterprise.

385
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:49,457
Speaker 0: So but a minor thing.

386
00:33:49,497 --> 00:33:52,510
Speaker 0: I like that this show does is you see there's a lot of background.

387
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:57,030
Speaker 0: I guess species culture development like the Gorn are one example.

388
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:28,592
Speaker 0: But there's others where there are antagonistic fucked-up aliens and a bunch of Star Trek's that don't get explored too much in later Star Trek's or are kind of just left as largely faceless problematic villains and like lower decks has definitely Encouraged this idea that if you fast-forward into the future Every alien race the Federation has run into no matter how much of a problem they were Start to calm down and become like slowly become relatively Like.

389
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:34,469
Speaker 0: okay with the Federation like you've got a Gorn just running his little chicken stand mister.

390
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,152
Speaker 1: What was it?

391
00:34:35,212 --> 00:34:35,793
Speaker 1: Mr.

392
00:34:36,135 --> 00:34:39,165
Speaker 1: Krabby legs not Krabby legs, but it was it wasn't.

393
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,810
Speaker 1: that was an inside joke, too.

394
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:41,837
Speaker 1: It's like mr.

395
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:43,107
Speaker 1: Krabby legger.

396
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:49,590
Speaker 1: And anyway, I don't know how you get from the strange new world Gorn to Gorn wedding.

397
00:34:50,152 --> 00:34:52,039
Speaker 1: Like how does the Gorn wedding?

398
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, how does how does that evolution come?

399
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:57,050
Speaker 1: That will be a really interesting cuz they're both.

400
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:10,311
Speaker 0: So someone read it pointed out It's it's been about a hundred and twenty years between the Gorn of TOS strange new world and and I haven't having a little little street food stand on Servant.

401
00:35:10,572 --> 00:35:16,669
Speaker 0: so I explained my mother bird wasn't eaten alive with eggs pushed into his body and instead was just nibbled a bit and somehow escape.

402
00:35:17,714 --> 00:35:19,250
Speaker 1: Well, he was a wedding crasher.

403
00:35:19,591 --> 00:35:26,550
Speaker 1: So, you know if somebody comes down in the spaceship and crashes your wedding you're you're perfectly within your rights to bite them.

404
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:29,237
Speaker 1: So it's very funny.

405
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:31,463
Speaker 1: It has a lot of cameos.

406
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:35,656
Speaker 1: Um, I keep saying it's funny But obviously it's a comedy animation.

407
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:37,984
Speaker 1: What do you think about the art of it?

408
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:39,890
Speaker 1: So that's the last like.

409
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:55,074
Speaker 0: Unlike a lot of other like, you know, if we talk about that style of like primetime American 23-minute animation it has really detailed backgrounds really good action sequences like the the.

410
00:35:55,395 --> 00:36:03,990
Speaker 0: the setting and this like the backgrounds and the sound design of the spaces is Very Star Trek, but they're using the animation.

411
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:04,933
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

412
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:09,750
Speaker 0: the characters also are a little cartoony and smeary in a really fun way.

413
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:13,427
Speaker 1: So my take on it is it's really grown on me.

414
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:19,466
Speaker 1: for starters I did not care for the character designs when I first saw it because I thought they were really generic like.

415
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:26,690
Speaker 1: it's definitely American animation looking and I tend to like, you know, either the voice acting is what brings these characters to life.

416
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:47,890
Speaker 1: But really I think you know, once you get a moving when they're just standing still It's kind of like a super generic, but they manage because they have a fairly high budget to have pretty funny Expressive Just movement and like the facial acting and stuff is pretty good.

417
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:54,589
Speaker 1: I still think that scene where in the first episode it's like the first scene of the first episode where Mariner

418
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:55,090
Speaker 0: actually

419
00:36:56,131 --> 00:37:01,889
Speaker 1: Yes, she accidentally chops boiler in the leg with a bat less and he's severely injured and has to go to the med

420
00:37:03,551 --> 00:37:07,483
Speaker 0: That scene at any frame it is hilarious funny

421
00:37:07,864 --> 00:37:08,486
Speaker 1: because it's

422
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:09,128
Speaker 0: like you

423
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:09,589
Speaker 1: see

424
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:10,733
Speaker 0: Mariner

425
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:35,550
Speaker 1: her face goes through all these evolutions and smears and It's definitely like the animators knew what they were doing in terms of even though it goes really fast she's just like moving in this really Exaggerated way and I think that's something even though sometimes, you know They'll skimp a little in certain scenes and it will be more like talking heads limited animation.

426
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,830
Speaker 1: There are scenes where they really?

427
00:37:39,755 --> 00:37:45,022
Speaker 1: Use the animation to our cartoony satisfying effect.

428
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:55,149
Speaker 1: so Yeah, I guess That's something that You can also show It is fairly violent, you know.

429
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,764
Speaker 1: It's not violent to the point where I think people would get too freaked out by it.

430
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:06,570
Speaker 1: and like most the time when there's violence It's violence like somebody gets chopped in the leg and you see you like gristle and bone and stuff.

431
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:09,950
Speaker 1: But you know, they're just gonna go immediately and get healed.

432
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:14,730
Speaker 1: So it's not like, you know, it's like you're not gonna die of what was it?

433
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,870
Speaker 1: You're not gonna die of a spear wound on a starship.

434
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:19,996
Speaker 0: And that's kind of.

435
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:22,870
Speaker 1: most of the violence falls under that, you know.

436
00:38:24,632 --> 00:38:26,949
Speaker 1: But I'm curious to see where it goes.

437
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:29,420
Speaker 1: There are sometimes there's.

438
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:36,426
Speaker 1: there are more Serious business high-intensity plots and well like starting to like Star Trek.

439
00:38:36,587 --> 00:38:37,610
Speaker 0: all there's old Star Trek.

440
00:38:37,791 --> 00:38:44,145
Speaker 0: It just stays episodic to a point in terms of the plot even though the characters keep evolving which all the old Star Treks did.

441
00:38:44,888 --> 00:38:57,930
Speaker 0: but it'll occasionally do what TNG would do at the end of a season what ds9 would do during critical moments of Previously on Star Trek lower decks a double episode and now the conclusion.

442
00:38:58,291 --> 00:39:14,881
Speaker 1: Yep, they do double episodes and like I said, they they will have running Plot points, but you could really pick up any episode and as long as you've seen Star Trek and you have a general idea of like like.

443
00:39:15,322 --> 00:39:20,076
Speaker 1: they transport, you know, they have transporters They have phasers, you know, they.

444
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:21,300
Speaker 1: they do this and do that.

445
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,018
Speaker 1: if you have those basics down you won't be confused You'll just be like, okay.

446
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:26,964
Speaker 1: This is what's happening.

447
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:33,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know so cool, um, I Really recommend the show.

448
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:45,828
Speaker 1: I'm curious to see it where it goes I think as a final thoughts like I said it being kind of like a military college dorm kind of show at least to begin with.

449
00:39:45,848 --> 00:39:51,463
Speaker 1: I Think the best thing about it is they don't try to pair everybody up.

450
00:39:51,724 --> 00:40:01,690
Speaker 0: It's basically like oh, yeah characters May not be romantically involved, but they're like, there's just a lot of friends who are not going to fuck each other in this show.

451
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:08,327
Speaker 1: Yeah and I think one of the even if they did end up like hooking up or something you'd feel like.

452
00:40:08,347 --> 00:40:13,780
Speaker 1: the Aspect of the relationship that is important to the show is friendship.

453
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:25,890
Speaker 1: It's all about like these ties where platonic friend relationships are Incredibly important life relationships and can change people and help them grow.

454
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:29,981
Speaker 0: I'd say there's one that's really affirming one very specific thing.

455
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:35,737
Speaker 0: This has sort of now canonized in Star Trek is If you look at old Star Trek's.

456
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:39,229
Speaker 0: you've got the captain's like Kirk and Picard.

457
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,350
Speaker 0: who?

458
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:47,496
Speaker 0: Break the rules and ignore the admiral's order to do a thing and that scene is very like roguish and like that's part of the Plots of Star Trek's.

459
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:48,562
Speaker 0: like those are the interesting things.

460
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:55,360
Speaker 0: the captain who broke the rule TNG Didn't really explore that much further and ds9 had its own thing going on.

461
00:40:55,421 --> 00:41:15,027
Speaker 0: Lower Decks has really brought back the idea that that happens all the time and that Unlike say the US Navy or a modern Navy where it is purely top-down It really implies the Federation does go both ways because captains in Lower Decks also violate the rules all the time.

462
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:28,729
Speaker 0: people disobey orders when they have a good reason to constantly and if it all works out It seems like the Federation sort of recalibrates around that and like that's an expected part of that kind of organization in the future.

463
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:44,189
Speaker 1: well Just the leeway to make your decisions and a lot of times captains are put in these positions where they may have to You know disobey a rule or an order or something like that.

464
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:57,526
Speaker 0: But strange new worlds though at the same time also canonize this idea by bringing in like Old characters Kirk that was the maverick Or like I used to see you're stealing a starship.

465
00:41:57,647 --> 00:41:58,049
Speaker 0: I'll help.

466
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,878
Speaker 1: yeah, it feels very like.

467
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:12,964
Speaker 1: this is part of why the Federation works is because It's not authoritarian to the point where captains can't Make informed choices.

468
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:18,450
Speaker 1: Yes And sometimes those choices are bad and they have to deal with the consequence.

469
00:42:18,631 --> 00:42:21,588
Speaker 1: I I gotta say Picard was hit or miss.

470
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:21,849
Speaker 1: for me.

471
00:42:22,211 --> 00:42:26,161
Speaker 1: There were a lot of times in Picard where who was the cranky captain?

472
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,307
Speaker 1: where he was just like fuck.

473
00:42:28,387 --> 00:42:33,940
Speaker 1: No Oh Shaw Exactly where he just calls them on their bullshit.

474
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,562
Speaker 1: He's just like.

475
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:36,408
Speaker 1: so I already called Starfleet.

476
00:42:36,448 --> 00:42:37,090
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

477
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:40,650
Speaker 0: So you're not actually an admiral right now.

478
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,707
Speaker 0: You're retired and you're trying to come on my ship and give me an order.

479
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:49,625
Speaker 0: Yeah Let me just phone home and see what the other admirals have to say about what you're just told.

480
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:59,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like I I think generally I Put lower decks on the exact same footing as every other Star Trek.

481
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:04,349
Speaker 1: I think it's fully canonical and they've said as much and I really enjoy it.

482
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:08,016
Speaker 1: I think if you're at all a fan You should definitely check it out.

483
00:43:08,136 --> 00:43:14,963
Speaker 1: And if you are just wanting to get into Star Trek I think that and maybe Strange New Worlds is a good entry.

484
00:43:14,983 --> 00:43:16,830
Speaker 0: Episode 1 of Lower Decks, Episode 1 of Strange New Worlds.

485
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:24,010
