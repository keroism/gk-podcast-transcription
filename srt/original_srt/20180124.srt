1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,231
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday January 24th 2018.

2
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:19,017
Speaker 0: I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight Mary and the witch's flower Let's do this.

3
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:26,059
Speaker 0: So I did something I've been planning on doing for a long time But I just even if I had done it I just never would have had time to use it.

4
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:32,211
Speaker 0: so I actually have some free time now that we're back from the Month of conventions and travel.

5
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,680
Speaker 0: so I actually got some VR.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,966
Speaker 0: I got an oculus in this house.

7
00:00:35,227 --> 00:00:36,573
Speaker 1: you have nothing else to spend your money on.

8
00:00:36,895 --> 00:00:38,040
Speaker 0: wasn't that expensive actually?

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,488
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's rich person.

10
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:43,259
Speaker 0: I uh it's not like I need to buy a new video card.

11
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:45,649
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, I already have a video card.

12
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:54,667
Speaker 0: in fact the cost difference between what I paid for my video card And what that video card would cost right now in light of all the people mining stupid coins Pretty much a breakeven as though.

13
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:55,612
Speaker 0: I bought the video card now.

14
00:00:55,994 --> 00:00:57,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a good time.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:57,482
Speaker 0: I don't know.

16
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,253
Speaker 0: you're weirdly down on everything.

17
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:00,380
Speaker 0: That's good in the world.

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,400
Speaker 0: So I'll assume that you'll never try it and you'll never see cocoa and cetera, but so yeah, it's pretty cool.

19
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:16,490
Speaker 0: I'll talk about it on Tuesday in depth But I must say if you get a VR thing whatever it is the only thing I got to tell you is that The game you need to play is super hot VR.

20
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,138
Speaker 0: It is definitely super hot mm-hmm.

21
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:20,826
Speaker 0: Alright, what do you already got?

22
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:21,933
Speaker 0: What's your opening vid?

23
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:22,959
Speaker 0: What's going on in your life?

24
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,500
Speaker 1: Going to work trying to not go to work, but have to go to work.

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,386
Speaker 0: It's real easy to not go to work anymore Don't go.

26
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,800
Speaker 1: I want to be able to eat and also keep my apartment.

27
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:36,840
Speaker 0: You can also not get your apartment for a some amount of time if you stop going to work.

28
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,388
Speaker 1: How about as long as I live all right?

29
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,632
Speaker 0: Well then you got to go to work.

30
00:01:40,652 --> 00:01:42,036
Speaker 1: I don't want to go work though.

31
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,174
Speaker 0: you Thought I think do you want a snack?

32
00:01:45,194 --> 00:01:45,820
Speaker 0: Do you want a nap?

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,286
Speaker 0: I don't think there's any way out of your situation short of like Full-on communism, and then I feel like you're just gonna be going to work.

34
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:52,609
Speaker 1: This is this is the problem.

35
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:52,870
Speaker 1: you see.

36
00:01:56,042 --> 00:02:01,174
Speaker 1: Now come to the same conclusion that I have Go to work despite not wanting to go to work.

37
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:04,407
Speaker 0: see I must say The fact that I have a new job.

38
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,060
Speaker 0: I actually like going to work, and it's a weird experience.

39
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,145
Speaker 1: We'll see how long that lasts.

40
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:12,037
Speaker 0: It's lasted longer than it's ever lasted at any job.

41
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:12,640
Speaker 0: I've ever had.

42
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:15,134
Speaker 0: That's saying something mm-hmm.

43
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,325
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's anime day.

44
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:25,491
Speaker 0: so once again if you found this show because we were at mag fast or packs unplugged or pack south And you ought to know what the deal was This is it.

45
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:34,608
Speaker 0: and also This is the Wednesday geek nights which means we're gonna talk about anime and since we don't really you probably We're only going to gaming conventions these days.

46
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,719
Speaker 1: Yep, so you're probably found us because of some gaming content, and you're like.

47
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:52,898
Speaker 1: Maybe you are a nerd and also like anime Which you should because that's the whole point of geek nights is that you shouldn't be a nerd who only likes one thing like Silver Rage spider-man guy, but maybe you don't like anime in which case just avoid us on Wednesday.

48
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,237
Speaker 1: or Welcome to the world of anime.

49
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:55,580
Speaker 1: It's good.

50
00:02:55,821 --> 00:03:02,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, now if you want us to appear at your anime convention hate to say it But we kind of just don't really do anime cons anymore.

51
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,220
Speaker 1: I mean we could but he had to make it worth it right?

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:14,576
Speaker 1: It's like you know I only have so many vacation days to get away from the awful work I just mentioned and for me to use it on a convention like anime convention the problem.

53
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:24,060
Speaker 0: You know it's got to take something Yep and that's something it has to be more than just paying for our travel and accommodations because Actually a lot of cons offer that to us, and we just don't have time anymore.

54
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, I need you got a cut.

55
00:03:25,264 --> 00:03:33,553
Speaker 1: you got to make it so that it's worth using the vacation days necessary to go there Yep, or make your kind of one-day con in New York.

56
00:03:33,634 --> 00:03:40,545
Speaker 1: then on a weekend Yeah, we're very likely to come as long as it's not in the same weekend as fucking Pax unplug next year.

57
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,270
Speaker 0: I'm plug pack south pecs east.

58
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,777
Speaker 1: I guess I'm going to and man why see?

59
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:45,640
Speaker 0: yeah anime NYC.

60
00:03:45,942 --> 00:03:51,355
Speaker 0: We were locked in 100% gonna go until fax unplugged announced their dates for the same weekend.

61
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,270
Speaker 0: Yep, so yeah We'll probably see you at a New York ad.

62
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,506
Speaker 0: I feel like if that New York thing They're already selling badges for next year.

63
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,977
Speaker 0: yep, but we just don't know the dates of unplugged for next year.

64
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,253
Speaker 0: nope I'll try to find that out.

65
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:11,300
Speaker 1: mm-hmm Say anyway got any anime news animation news, so this isn't really a news that affects anyone listening to this show.

66
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:12,645
Speaker 1: Right, but there's more.

67
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,991
Speaker 1: I want to say about this right.

68
00:04:14,031 --> 00:04:16,000
Speaker 1: so your petal is a show that I watch.

69
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:17,058
Speaker 1: It's not a good show.

70
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:21,587
Speaker 1: It's an okay generic sports anime Just has to be about biking.

71
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,140
Speaker 0: so I probably better than initial D as much as I like it.

72
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's definitely better than initial D and also some of the characters are cool.

73
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,477
Speaker 1: even some of them aren't.

74
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:29,320
Speaker 0: yeah.

75
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:39,986
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's only one really cool New season started and to give you an idea of the pace of this sports and may versus others Basically the story is that they're in high school and every year There's a big race.

76
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:52,797
Speaker 1: so the it took two seasons To basically build up to the start of this race and then the second season they finished the race and then quite a Quite an expanded timeline there and in season season two is basically just just the race.

77
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:58,958
Speaker 1: season three They build up to the first ray the second race because they're in the second year of high school and the race begins.

78
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:13,051
Speaker 1: and now We're watching season four which is Started basically in the middle of the first day of the second year's race on the first day and I assume That the most of the right the inter high Yes, it's the inner high.

79
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,560
Speaker 1: I assume the most inner high, right?

80
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:22,840
Speaker 1: I assume most of the rest of this season will be Finishing this second year race and that in the fort the fifth season the third year of high school will start anyway.

81
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:25,730
Speaker 1: Your pedal is having its 12.

82
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,663
Speaker 1: That's right 12. live stage play in Japan.

83
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:33,025
Speaker 0: Wow, right.

84
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:46,702
Speaker 1: so People don't think anime fans don't think about these a lot cuz like theater is a very local You know thing like you had to live near the theater and you have to go to it specific time.

85
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:47,785
Speaker 0: the theater.

86
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:56,700
Speaker 0: anime adaptations that people in anime fandom mostly know about are the utenna ones and it's mostly because It's not like there's been any more utenna.

87
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:03,180
Speaker 0: So anything more in that universe is something that the fans of that anime will latch out to no matter what it is, right?

88
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,031
Speaker 1: But it's like people don't necessarily realize you think about.

89
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:18,065
Speaker 1: too often at least people fans outside Japan Like there are actually a lot of live-action stage plays even musicals depending on the whatever of Anime adaptation.

90
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:34,460
Speaker 1: right we think about adaptations from manga to anime from TV to movies Yeah from to video games to novels to all these different mediums, you know You know crossing and christening go taking the same story and readapting it to live-action TV, right?

91
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:55,524
Speaker 1: But this the medium of theater people don't think about that adaptation very often Especially if you don't live near theater or think about theater Right, but there are tons and tons and tons of animes and nerdy things that have been adapted to stage plays Especially in Japan and no one thinks about them ever Outside Japan.

92
00:06:55,705 --> 00:07:02,580
Speaker 1: the few times I've delved into like reading about we've seen we've seen Sailor Moon ones We've seen utenna ones in the past right back.

93
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:10,848
Speaker 0: I don't want to generalize cuz I definitely have not seen enough to have an opinion but all the ones I've seen Were pretty bad.

94
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:16,188
Speaker 0: I didn't say they're good like Pretty bad, and I'm just gonna leave it at that.

95
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:32,517
Speaker 1: The point is that they exist right and I think The fact that they still exist I think there's actually probably money to be made by going and digging up Recordings of all the ones ever and starting to subtitle them and put them online.

96
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:33,400
Speaker 0: I go one step further.

97
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:38,240
Speaker 0: I think there's money to be made in the US taking other fandoms and just doing this shit.

98
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,164
Speaker 0: I mean look how many people.

99
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,073
Speaker 1: well no see the prop the thing is right.

100
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:41,716
Speaker 1: They tried this.

101
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:42,480
Speaker 1: they're not stupid.

102
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,592
Speaker 1: They tried to do spider-man on Broadway and it no worky.

103
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:48,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, they lose all the money Wasn't that?

104
00:07:48,603 --> 00:07:50,511
Speaker 0: just because they made it bad I mean.

105
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:55,778
Speaker 1: on the other hand like Disney on Broadway works really well, but those are musicals.

106
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,204
Speaker 0: to begin I guess the spider-man one.

107
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:01,540
Speaker 0: the problem was that they were like really over produced this technical aspect of it and spectacle aspect.

108
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,194
Speaker 0: But these anime ones tend to be pretty low-budget.

109
00:08:04,214 --> 00:08:06,605
Speaker 0: I Mean, but you guys crank them out.

110
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,031
Speaker 1: You're gonna crank it off Broadway.

111
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,678
Speaker 1: only people in New York can see it.

112
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,960
Speaker 0: Hey Only people in New York can see it as a viable demographic.

113
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:21,339
Speaker 1: I mean how many times you gonna put it on stage three like there's off-broadway shows about really really obscure shit And they sell for it.

114
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:30,690
Speaker 0: The previous stage play shin inter high hand heat up ran from only in Tokyo from October 19th To October 23rd.

115
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,900
Speaker 0: These things do not run long.

116
00:08:32,101 --> 00:08:36,320
Speaker 1: It's like it was worth it for these people to make this thing happen for like a week for a week.

117
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:42,876
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like really you put that much effort into it Or maybe it sucked and they didn't actually put that much ever to do it into the bare minimum.

118
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:50,770
Speaker 0: to make it happen You should have run spider-man like just for a week off-broadway with like piderman level production value.

119
00:08:53,122 --> 00:09:01,353
Speaker 1: I just I think this is untapped market of in general adapting nerdy things to the medium that things don't get adapted to.

120
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,759
Speaker 0: well the way you make money off of that is you.

121
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:09,310
Speaker 0: I mean Look at like in gaming cons Tabletop because nerds do love musicals and theater.

122
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,572
Speaker 1: Look at the few times and I can think of there was that What's it called the thing with the guy with the hammer on his chest?

123
00:09:16,853 --> 00:09:18,480
Speaker 1: nerds love that shit, right?

124
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:18,903
Speaker 0: Well, really?

125
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:21,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you never saw any of that Dr.

126
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:22,969
Speaker 0: Horrible sing-along vlog, right?

127
00:09:22,989 --> 00:09:25,680
Speaker 1: That's the one I was in the room while someone else was watching.

128
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,203
Speaker 0: What do you said?

129
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:27,529
Speaker 0: the dude with the hammer for a second?

130
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:29,680
Speaker 0: I thought you were gonna be referring to Gallagher.

131
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,271
Speaker 1: No, not that guy.

132
00:09:31,312 --> 00:09:34,345
Speaker 1: He's not he's a comedian Or possibly Gallagher.

133
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:34,647
Speaker 0: to.

134
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,660
Speaker 1: the point is that I'm saying nerds do like this shit.

135
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:41,640
Speaker 1: But that but and also think about is not being targeted enough.

136
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:46,840
Speaker 0: I mean look at like the world of just doing your D&D game on a stage.

137
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,793
Speaker 0: Yep, the penny arcade ones are literally like the best there is and they're crazy popular.

138
00:09:52,214 --> 00:09:54,560
Speaker 0: even one step down not great.

139
00:09:54,962 --> 00:10:04,280
Speaker 1: Imagine if someone did a. oh my god Someone should make a tabletop RPG, but it's musicals and this karaoke involved and that's specifically made for doing on Twitch.

140
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:06,788
Speaker 1: Yeah and then we'll get people who can actually sing to do it.

141
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:22,505
Speaker 0: basically what you're up against your primary competition if you go down this Road is whatever garbage is already at like the cosplay skit review at your anime con Mm-hmm, if you can get above that bar, you can probably make a meager living if you don't live in a big city Mm-hmm.

142
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,715
Speaker 1: Yeah people in the theater club are usually nerds.

143
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:25,680
Speaker 1: Yep, right?

144
00:10:26,102 --> 00:10:37,799
Speaker 0: So in some other news every year we go to the New York International Children's Film Festival Because the New York International Children's Film Festival has a ton of great animation and anime Yep, and we always see this.

145
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,569
Speaker 1: No one else knows what that is like.

146
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,100
Speaker 1: if I showed it to you on YouTube you'd be like what the hell is this.

147
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,690
Speaker 1: But like it's after going to the theater so many times when I see it It's like I rarely go to the theater.

148
00:10:53,991 --> 00:10:55,780
Speaker 1: most of the time I do go to the theater.

149
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,229
Speaker 1: It's to a screening that begins with that fucking thing.

150
00:10:58,269 --> 00:10:59,956
Speaker 0: It's like seeing the toy logo come up.

151
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:03,496
Speaker 1: You're like, ah, yeah most Most people don't know what that is.

152
00:11:03,577 --> 00:11:05,688
Speaker 1: But I Most of the time I go to the theater.

153
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:06,773
Speaker 1: I'm seeing the toe.

154
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:09,547
Speaker 0: So at that time look at right now there's a ton of good stuff to see.

155
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:14,827
Speaker 0: as always I think what I'm gonna go see is My Twitter, you know, we talk about it when we do it.

156
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:16,814
Speaker 1: Isn't there at Maru hosted a movie or the next year?

157

00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:20,626
Speaker 1: What's that?

159
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:35,010
Speaker 0: You've seen a bunch of images from it because Anna Twitter tweets about this kind of often Mm-hmm, but it's about a sort of Mermaid girl with the soul of a pop star and Shapeshifting like magic nonsense and it looks really cute.

160
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,592
Speaker 1: Sounds good.

161
00:11:35,852 --> 00:11:36,133
Speaker 0: Yep.

162
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:37,097
Speaker 0: So Lou over the wall.

163
00:11:37,177 --> 00:11:39,349
Speaker 0: I want to see The show in white Fang.

164
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,114
Speaker 1: What's that?

165
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:40,840
Speaker 0: What?

166
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:42,523
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

167
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:42,744
Speaker 0: What?

168
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:43,589
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

169
00:11:43,609 --> 00:11:44,132
Speaker 0: What's that?

170
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:45,177
Speaker 1: I don't know what that is.

171
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:45,519
Speaker 0: You don't know.

172
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,324
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm not gonna dignify that with a response I'm just scrolling down it.

173
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:51,911
Speaker 0: a shark big fish and begonia.

174
00:11:51,992 --> 00:11:55,832
Speaker 0: this Chinese animated movie actually looks pretty good Hilda.

175
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:58,168
Speaker 1: actually I've seen pictures of that.

176
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're showing Horace Prince of the Sun.

177
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:03,210
Speaker 1: The real Horace Prince of the Sun looks like it in subs.

178
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:04,554
Speaker 0: I assume so.

179
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:06,400
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that since a VHS at RIT.

180
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've also not seen this since a VHS at RIT.

181
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:11,880
Speaker 1: Horace Prince of the Sun is the kind of thing that only Scott likes.

182
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:16,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's slow and old and weird just like night on the Galactic Railroad.

183
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:22,769
Speaker 1: It's a little bit less slow than night on the Galactic Railroad But it's the same feels that that is notable.

184
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:29,551
Speaker 0: you're watching it alone at night in the dark quiet kind of feel for having a Scene where the cat guy very slowly walks over to.

185
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:35,936
Speaker 0: it looks like a not old Horace Prince of the Sun Let's see celebrates the golden anniversary of a mythical tale from fame.

186
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:39,109
Speaker 0: studio Ghibli founders Blah blah blah film spark in this East meets West.

187
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,194
Speaker 0: take on sword in the stone.

188
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,037
Speaker 0: Did you have it?

189
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,644
Speaker 0: I. Maybe it's just.

190
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,869
Speaker 1: I don't think it's the original.

191
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,099
Speaker 1: I can't tell that doesn't look like it down here.

192
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,188
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like it.

193
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,340
Speaker 1: That is not the horse.

194
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:49,984
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe that's it.

195
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:50,606
Speaker 1: Maybe it is.

196
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:51,289
Speaker 0: You know what it is.

197
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:57,213
Speaker 0: You've never seen it except in the like Fourth generation VHS fansub bootleg.

198
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,980
Speaker 1: that is the form that I have seen it in.

199
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,000
Speaker 0: Yes, because I got to say I've seen a few like even watching the remastered utenna.

200
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:09,960
Speaker 0: It's like night and day Compared to what I remembered especially start seeing like cell.

201
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,460
Speaker 1: Maybe someone did a good job preserving the cells for Horace Prince of Sun.

202
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:21,400
Speaker 0: But if you're a fan of animation at all the New York International Children's Film Festival is a must-go-to event every year.

203
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:26,229
Speaker 0: we're there every year and you should also be there and Buy your tickets soon because shit sells out.

204
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:36,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, the big screenings usually sell it immediately but anyway things of the day.

205
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:40,720
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if any of you know who Adam Neely is, but I've been a fan of him for a while.

206
00:13:40,941 --> 00:13:43,920
Speaker 0: I know Brad Neely is so he's got Washington.

207
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:51,476
Speaker 0: So The question asked in this video and you might have seen this kind of made the rounds in social media So you might have seen a link to it.

208
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:56,392
Speaker 0: What is the slowest music that is humanly possible?

209
00:13:56,673 --> 00:13:59,540
Speaker 1: couldn't wouldn't it just be one note like do forever?

210
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,874
Speaker 0: So arguably that would that be music or is that just a static event?

211
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,520
Speaker 1: Don't give me your semantic arguments.

212
00:14:05,941 --> 00:14:06,282
Speaker 0: It's got.

213
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:07,788
Speaker 0: we're all about the semantic argument.

214
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:08,310
Speaker 0: No, I'm not.

215
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,940
Speaker 1: I'm specifically thinking semantic arguments are pointless.

216
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:12,200
Speaker 1: I don't care.

217
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,309
Speaker 0: Song only has one notes.

218
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,112
Speaker 1: It has another note.

219
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:17,795
Speaker 1: It's just so slow.

220
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,060
Speaker 1: You're not gonna live to hear the second note.

221
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,063
Speaker 0: That's very different.

222
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:20,786
Speaker 0: There's just one.

223
00:14:20,846 --> 00:14:21,770
Speaker 1: no infinity from now.

224
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:24,118
Speaker 0: So this gets into that infinity.

225
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:34,840
Speaker 0: from now We will play the next note, you know There actually is a musical piece that's gonna be going for hundreds of years That is in progress and in 2020 the next it's gonna shift to the next note.

226
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:37,276
Speaker 1: There's also like this silence forever.

227
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:37,980
Speaker 1: Is that a music?

228
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,679
Speaker 1: When people have released musical tracks that are just quiet?

229
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:49,440
Speaker 0: Ah, so one argument you made in this video is that if there's just one note Then there's no possible frame of reference or state change for another note.

230
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,287
Speaker 0: So you can't say that it's a long song.

231
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:51,648
Speaker 0: there isn't.

232
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:53,194
Speaker 1: it's just so long that you have.

233
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:54,660
Speaker 1: it was just quiet forever.

234
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:57,411
Speaker 0: I I'm gonna say that that's just not music.

235
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:58,356
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

236
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:04,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, however What if I told you that the slowest possible human music is 33 beats per minute?

237
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,572
Speaker 1: I'll just make a song this 34 beats per minute.

238
00:15:07,612 --> 00:15:09,360
Speaker 1: I mean your brain two beats per minute.

239
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,716
Speaker 0: You say that your brain that there's sort of a human limit where kind of like.

240
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:16,443
Speaker 0: how if you look if you listen Well, I won't.

241
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:17,652
Speaker 1: you won't hear the next beat.

242
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:34,280
Speaker 0: if it's if it's at that Will not associate the two events together as music or as a rhythm or even as a pattern Unless you in your brain maintain a separate Faster rate of counting and you count the time off.

243
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:42,539
Speaker 0: But things that are just a little bit faster than 33 beats per minute Your brain will naturally beat and be able to keep track of.

244
00:15:42,599 --> 00:15:45,777
Speaker 1: well That's still a semantic argument because what if I was a goldfish?

245
00:15:45,837 --> 00:15:49,004
Speaker 1: then me Human human?

246
00:15:49,065 --> 00:15:49,807
Speaker 0: I said human.

247
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:53,359
Speaker 0: the question as human is very specifically about human.

248
00:15:54,143 --> 00:15:55,108
Speaker 1: What if I'm a dog?

249
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:57,260
Speaker 1: so maybe we should make different music for dogs?

250
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:03,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, we probably could and I feel like the dog music could be all about just a voice screaming you want to go for a walk doo doo doo doo.

251
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,233
Speaker 1: Hey, that could make money.

252
00:16:06,414 --> 00:16:11,114
Speaker 1: Yeah Get a CE at mp3 people click on on Spotify and suddenly all the dogs are happy.

253
00:16:11,174 --> 00:16:12,619
Speaker 1: people would be clicking on that shit.

254
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:14,767
Speaker 0: Actually, the better prank would have a normal.

255
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:23,840
Speaker 1: you click on these songs on Spotify if you want to make your dog sad happy Normal YouTube video and in the middle of it in the person like a side show different albums are different pets.

256
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,539
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to make your bunny hop around play this?

257
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:26,484
Speaker 0: No You make it a prank.

258
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:37,080
Speaker 0: instead in the middle of like a normal video like a SciShow The person doing it just turns the camera and says hey Hey, you want to go for a walk you want a treat and that's gonna cause problems for anyone who owns a dog.

259
00:16:37,562 --> 00:16:39,313
Speaker 0: Okay, so you got a thing of the day.

260
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 1: I do have a thing a day.

261
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,360
Speaker 1: So lately the the show that's getting the most talk in the anime land is the devil man.

262
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is funny because I still feel like some people are hype about it because they've seen a lot of buzz about it.

263
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,307
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's bad.

264
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,013
Speaker 0: I'm gonna watch it.

265
00:16:54,457 --> 00:16:56,566
Speaker 0: I have high Is good show.

266
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:57,792
Speaker 1: people are hype about it as a girl.

267
00:16:57,832 --> 00:17:01,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is but I think a lot of people Who don't know?

268
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,895
Speaker 1: What it is when you mean they're watching it?

269
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:04,520
Speaker 1: That's why they're high.

270
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:09,119
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot of people who seem to be hype about the media around but I haven't actually watched it yet anyway.

271
00:17:09,421 --> 00:17:16,319
Speaker 1: So the point is that I think the only thing is people who are seeing devil man now and seeing how good it is.

272
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:20,297
Speaker 1: They actually don't know much about going a guy or old devil man.

273
00:17:20,578 --> 00:17:32,538
Speaker 1: Yeah It's actually a point in the show where a kid using a computer goes to YouTube and plays the old devil man theme song and opener and like people in the show are like devil man, isn't that that old show?

274
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:37,790
Speaker 1: and Anyway, so, you know gonna guys resurgence here.

275
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:41,060
Speaker 1: Thanks to the Masaaki washes adaptation of devil man.

276
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,788
Speaker 1: So I found this related thing of the day.

277
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:55,398
Speaker 1: also going a guy is the video that shows you all of Mazinger Z's special attacks every single one after the other and you can see how awesome Mazinger Z is.

278
00:17:55,418 --> 00:18:00,439
Speaker 1: and Basically this, you know, the three main works of going a guy at least as you know.

279
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:11,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, right is you got Mazinger Z the robot you got you know, cutie, honey Right the sexy hero and then you combine them to make double man The sexy hero.

280
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:14,960
Speaker 1: that doesn't know if it's it's it's demon or God or whatever.

281
00:18:15,582 --> 00:18:19,277
Speaker 0: Oh actually so kind of related that first movie I talked about for the film festival.

282
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:21,710
Speaker 0: Lou over the wall That's a Masaaki Yuasa.

283
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:22,313
Speaker 1: Okay.

284
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:25,308
Speaker 0: There you go In the meta moment.

285
00:18:25,469 --> 00:18:30,954
Speaker 0: if you saws at a convention We're bit by bit posting videos of many of the things we did at those conventions.

286
00:18:30,974 --> 00:18:33,663
Speaker 1: So I I coded up That's different.

287
00:18:34,004 --> 00:18:35,708
Speaker 1: No, that's not something we did at a convention.

288
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:36,130
Speaker 0: Nope.

289
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,112
Speaker 0: It is not it's not.

290
00:18:37,192 --> 00:18:39,820
Speaker 1: but yeah, we recorded the winter.

291
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:41,282
Speaker 1: Whatever.

292
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:43,087
Speaker 0: judge anime by its cover.

293
00:18:43,127 --> 00:18:44,271
Speaker 1: judging of anime.

294
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:47,239
Speaker 1: judge Scott and rim judged all the animes and the anime chart.

295
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:47,560
Speaker 0: as you see.

296
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,409
Speaker 0: That's how we're because we're not going to anime cows.

297
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:51,760
Speaker 0: We're doing our anime con content on YouTube.

298
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,900
Speaker 1: I made I encoded the proxies and now I can start editing it like today tomorrow.

299
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:58,251
Speaker 0: You know what the best thing about having a modern computer is.

300
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,000
Speaker 0: I just don't bother with proxies anymore.

301
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:00,542
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever.

302
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:06,720
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put it all I did a multi cam with heavy color correction and multiple 4k video streams.

303
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,060
Speaker 0: I can just play it at double speed in real time.

304
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,432
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go, you know, probably that by this weekend.

305
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,118
Speaker 1: I should have it done and put together and whatnot?

306
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:14,399
Speaker 1: bad.

307
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:17,579
Speaker 0: So we have actually I have a lot of videos queued up to publish.

308
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:22,520
Speaker 0: So yeah, I just uploaded a carcass own learn and win from packs unplugged.

309
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:35,520
Speaker 0: I also upload balance in game design from packs out which is extra important because our goal is for you out there to post that balance in game design Video in every stupid forum thread where someone's complaining about how something is unbalanced.

310
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:42,440
Speaker 1: If anyone says Sutton's Opie or Sutton's unfair they want something nerve right then you should post a link to that YouTube video.

311
00:19:43,284 --> 00:19:44,359
Speaker 1: But yeah, check us out.

312
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:49,160
Speaker 1: I mean if you are already listening to eat knives You must have already checked us out and all the places on the internet.

313
00:19:49,342 --> 00:19:54,860
Speaker 0: This could be the first time they've ever checked us out But I feel like the podcast is not most people's first introduction to us.

314
00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:01,470
Speaker 1: No I think what you got to do now is you've got to find some other nerd and tell them Don't listen to you guys.

315
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:02,336
Speaker 1: It's a waste of your time.

316
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:07,657
Speaker 0: Good, but If you tell enough people to listen to geek night do not do this.

317
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:12,660
Speaker 1: there is a Very low hate you when they say why did you recommend this awful shit to me?

318
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:20,780
Speaker 0: There is a very low but non-zero chance that it would someday allow Scott to not have to work Except on this and then he would be marginally happier.

319
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,426
Speaker 1: Do not send us your money.

320
00:20:22,546 --> 00:20:26,844
Speaker 1: unless you send me enough money to pay rent in New York City in which case send me all Your money.

321
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,680
Speaker 0: they have sent us some money on the patreon.

322
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:31,329
Speaker 1: Do not send that money to rim.

323
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,533
Speaker 0: that's gonna fund our convention.

324
00:20:32,654 --> 00:20:34,480
Speaker 1: that is not a place to send your money.

325
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:43,406
Speaker 0: Otherwise the book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey, which I'm gonna start reading Probably this weekend.

326
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:44,511
Speaker 0: It's time.

327
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:45,415
Speaker 1: I'll read it soon.

328
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:46,038
Speaker 0: I'll read it.

329
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:46,360
Speaker 0: I'm here.

330
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,316
Speaker 1: I bought it on Kindle right away, but it was on sale.

331
00:20:49,336 --> 00:21:02,980
Speaker 0: That's why I did night's we very pretty much whenever there's an anime movie that makes it into the u.s We pretty much say if it's not like Pokemon 50 or like Digimon 12, like if it's a standalone anime movie.

332
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,549
Speaker 0: Might as well.

333
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,520
Speaker 1: just watch it's night.

334
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,258
Speaker 1: It's gonna be 90 minutes to probably two and a half hours at most of your time And it's probably gonna be worth it.

335
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaker 1: It was an anime good enough to get picked up put into theaters in the u.s.

336
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,924
Speaker 1: Probably worth seeing.

337
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:18,000
Speaker 1: so this is anime called Mary and the witch's flower.

338
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:27,357
Speaker 1: It's an animated movie full-length animated feature Yep, and it was made by a new studio called studio Pana which I think is a check word.

339
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:30,626
Speaker 0: They said yeah A lot about them.

340
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:34,843
Speaker 0: I already knew about them, but baby learn more based on the interview We saw after the movie.

341
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:43,138
Speaker 1: right but studio Pana what happened was Miyazaki retired for the hundredth time and people thought that was gonna be It for reals cuz he seemed a little more serious than the last time.

342
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:43,379
Speaker 1: yep.

343
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:47,360
Speaker 1: So people at his studio at Ghibli were like well, we want to make some fucking anime movies.

344
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,790
Speaker 1: What are we gonna do without this guy isn't?

345
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,120
Speaker 1: we're not making any movies here.

346
00:21:50,461 --> 00:22:01,764
Speaker 1: Let's go make our own okay, so they went and they made studio Pana and then Miyazaki came back and said goddamn it I keep smoking, but I'm not dead yet The die making an anime and he's making another anime And he came back.

347
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:04,479
Speaker 1: so but meanwhile these people already had left and made their own deal.

348
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:19,253
Speaker 1: So the first movie the studio Pana produced was Mary and the witch's flower Which is picked up by G kids which is the you know the company that distributes most of the anime movies of big name All the Ghibli's and such in the US and other places.

349
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:21,887
Speaker 0: which means if you live in New York You can just go see it in the theater.

350
00:22:21,927 --> 00:22:23,900
Speaker 1: You can see in the theater a lot of still in the theater.

351
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,262
Speaker 1: It's a limited run, but you can see it in a lot of theaters in major places in the US and other countries I'm sure.

352
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:34,473
Speaker 0: so it actually grossed quite a bit in the u.s.. Yeah people I mean relative to an anime movie 1.5 mil alright.

353
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,545
Speaker 1: So it's Mary and the witch's flower.

354
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:38,428
Speaker 1: the first thing.

355
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:47,019
Speaker 1: by these you know Ghibli runaways the people with Ghibli skills who were employees at Animators there, but they left to go work on this instead.

356
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,171
Speaker 1: So how did they do?

357
00:22:49,212 --> 00:22:49,858
Speaker 1: we went to see it?

358
00:22:50,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Speaker 1: Okay, right, so we didn't know beforehand that when we bought tickets months in advance But the seven o'clock showing was dubbed and the eight o'clock showing was subway bought the seven o'clock And then we found out it was dubbed later however.

359
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,957
Speaker 1: So we saw the dub, but we don't know anything about the sub, but I will say the dub was competent.

360
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:07,600
Speaker 0: it seemed fine.

361
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:12,074
Speaker 1: It was good that the voice acting was good job.

362
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:13,860
Speaker 1: on the voice actors they done good.

363
00:23:13,941 --> 00:23:16,934
Speaker 1: It didn't sound like an anime dub like you here on TV Yep.

364
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,970
Speaker 1: So that was good and it also.

365
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,573
Speaker 0: it does not feel like The dub took any significant liberties or anything like.

366
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:27,469
Speaker 0: I don't think if we watched it subbed We would get a have a different impression of the movie.

367
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:28,514
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.

368
00:23:28,534 --> 00:23:29,960
Speaker 1: I mean it's probably not that different.

369
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,120
Speaker 1: I don't think the movie was edited.

370
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:34,423
Speaker 1: The movie was not edited in any way But I don't know.

371
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:43,039
Speaker 0: I can't compare the dub script to the Japanese cuz I don't speak Japanese But I will say this based on the kinds of like there were the parts of the dub that didn't work.

372
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:49,220
Speaker 0: Really feel like those were structural problems with the movie and not anything with the dub taking a liberty, right?

373
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,040
Speaker 1: So this is based on a novel as many Ghibli movies are the little broomstick by Mary Stewart, right?

374
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,653
Speaker 1: Which is I guess a popular children's novel that I never read.

375
00:23:57,774 --> 00:23:58,880
Speaker 0: I had never heard of it or read it.

376
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,724
Speaker 0: It's some British thing.

377
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,880
Speaker 1: I think I kind of maybe heard of it in the distance.

378
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:05,004
Speaker 0: I don't know.

379
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,353
Speaker 1: I definitely never read a page of it.

380
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:09,000
Speaker 1: I wouldn't be able to find it in the bookstore.

381
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,480
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the story is let's go marry and for some reason her parents are busy and she has to go live.

382
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,220
Speaker 1: They're all gonna live with Graham or aunt or great-aunt great aunt and instead of living where they lived before.

383
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:28,525
Speaker 1: but she goes ahead and starts living with the great aunt while she's bored and the parents are still living somewhere else for the Time being.

384
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:34,595
Speaker 1: and she's bored at this Ghibli esque Ghibli house in the woods and you know what I hate to say.

385
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:35,660
Speaker 0: this TV doesn't work.

386
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:38,306
Speaker 0: You're gonna see why she's bored cuz I like like.

387
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:47,610
Speaker 0: the movie was good like, okay, like I enjoyed it, but they spend a long time With her being bored hanging out in Ghibli land, right?

388
00:24:47,931 --> 00:24:51,119
Speaker 1: So then she goes into the woods and oh my god adventure.

389
00:24:53,901 --> 00:25:03,183
Speaker 0: So we're not gonna really stereotypical plot we're not gonna really spoil because again It's not gonna spoil it but It's only okay.

390
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:08,739
Speaker 0: It feels like half of its problem is that it feels like a knockoff Ghibli movie.

391
00:25:09,945 --> 00:25:10,738
Speaker 1: But isn't that what it is?

392
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:22,640
Speaker 0: Yeah but the thing is when there's a studio breakup like when someone like breaks away to make a studio like this the ways it could Go are it's just a knockoff and it's bad or it's just a knockoff like doing the same kind of thing.

393
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,228
Speaker 0: But it's great like more of the same like.

394
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:27,544
Speaker 0: if it was just another great Ghibli movie That would have been fine.

395
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,680
Speaker 0: And the third way they can go is they say they go in a vastly different direction.

396
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:40,103
Speaker 0: This felt like it was cleaving very closely to how Ghibli movies go But it just wasn't that well Written.

397
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:42,030
Speaker 0: it wasn't that well put together.

398
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,154
Speaker 0: It was paced oddly.

399
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:47,838
Speaker 0: It was kind of lazy and It kind of doesn't make sense.

400
00:25:49,322 --> 00:25:53,640
Speaker 0: And the worst part about it is that if you try to read into it you can you can make an argument.

401
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:55,219
Speaker 0: I see where they were going with this.

402
00:25:55,883 --> 00:26:01,228
Speaker 1: But even that illusion was ruined for us because I think if you make a movie You can't just see where you're going.

403
00:26:01,248 --> 00:26:02,655
Speaker 1: You have to get to where you're going.

404
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,386
Speaker 1: Yeah before the movies done They didn't rooms.

405
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,080
Speaker 1: rooms is where you get right?

406
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,680
Speaker 1: So first of all, there's some characters in the movie that are like don't do much and it's like why are they even there?

407
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,056
Speaker 0: Like broom guy who's funny, but he's literally guy is a deus ex machina like three times.

408
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:19,280
Speaker 1: All he is is broom guy.

409
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,780
Speaker 1: He has never doesn't do anything else except really really get excited about broom.

410
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,052
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give you the example here this dude.

411
00:26:26,153 --> 00:26:38,299
Speaker 0: Literally the first magic thing you see like the magic creature you see is this like animal person who shows up and is like Ah, you've got a broom and you're not taking care of it.

412
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:39,959
Speaker 0: You gotta take care of your broom.

413
00:26:40,824 --> 00:26:43,980
Speaker 0: And then he proceeds to like tell Mary how to take care of her broom.

414
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:47,012
Speaker 0: And then he takes her to enroll in witch school.

415
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:48,740
Speaker 0: Don't worry about why we're at witch school now.

416
00:26:49,602 --> 00:26:56,020
Speaker 0: And then he takes her to this sign and the sign clearly shows like four numbered rules.

417
00:26:56,301 --> 00:26:57,003
Speaker 0: and then he's like.

418
00:26:57,364 --> 00:27:02,931
Speaker 0: there's four rules about this place and The first rule is if you fuck up you get trained.

419
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:04,880
Speaker 1: if you're a trespasser you get trans.

420
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:09,486
Speaker 0: Yeah If you're a trespasser you so an animal person shows her the first rule.

421
00:27:09,926 --> 00:27:12,610
Speaker 0: and the first rule is if you trespass you get transformed.

422
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:18,640
Speaker 0: Doesn't even mention the other three rules that are clearly written on this side and then runs away.

423
00:27:18,861 --> 00:27:27,047
Speaker 1: And then as soon as the like headmaster's the school appear he runs and everything else the guy ever does in the whole movie is Talk about brooms and show up.

424
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,820
Speaker 1: when this broom trouble you might be thinking all he says is why don't you take care of your broom?

425
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:33,223
Speaker 0: ah, ah You might be thinking.

426
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:38,440
Speaker 0: Oh, I assume that he was trespassing and was transformed and there's a story there now.

427
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,271
Speaker 0: No, no, there's nothing like that.

428
00:27:40,351 --> 00:27:41,800
Speaker 0: No, he shows up at that moment.

429
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:45,954
Speaker 0: He shows up later to be like, ah, you're not taking care of your broom.

430
00:27:46,395 --> 00:27:47,820
Speaker 0: Here's how to take care of your broom.

431
00:27:48,504 --> 00:27:53,939
Speaker 0: he shows up again to be the deus ex machina and That's literally it.

432
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,972
Speaker 1: yeah, and a lot there's other characters that appear and do almost nothing like.

433
00:27:58,453 --> 00:28:00,539
Speaker 1: there's the the boy character who is.

434
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,405
Speaker 1: It's like she likes him and they there's like this tiny amount of interaction in the big setup part But not much.

435
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,639
Speaker 1: and but suddenly she cares about him a whole bunch.

436
00:28:10,342 --> 00:28:14,276
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, and she's I guess it said because you can read a lot in it.

437
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,460
Speaker 1: She being married the main care.

438
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,898
Speaker 0: yeah, you could make a lot of inferences and ideas about what this movie is really about but after the movie.

439
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:28,139
Speaker 0: there was an interview with the creators at studio and They pretty much said that the movie is exactly the face value that it looked like.

440
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:38,805
Speaker 1: Yeah I think the thing is when you see a Ghibli movie Right is not only do you get this story that is approachable to children that is straightforward and such But you also get this sort of.

441
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:44,300
Speaker 1: you know, subtler, you know thing going on right where there's another message, right?

442
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:48,260
Speaker 1: Like, you know thing about the first one lava - right where it's like, oh, okay.

443
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,240
Speaker 1: So, you know rescue the girl from the bad guys.

444
00:28:51,421 --> 00:28:55,435
Speaker 0: But no really lava - is the environmental storytelling of the world itself, right?

445
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:56,800
Speaker 1: This does not have that.

446
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,288
Speaker 1: It's literally just a children's movie.

447
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:03,120
Speaker 1: Just like all the other Gennaro children's movies of your childhood that you saw.

448
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:16,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the Thumbelinas or the whatever like this movie is a series of Chekhov's guns Just laying all over the place and the main characters just kind of walk by him And then at the end you see him in the credits, but at no point do they fire?

449
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:18,962
Speaker 0: It's just.

450
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:23,600
Speaker 0: it's really long and kind of badly paced and it wasn't nothing was that long.

451
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,625
Speaker 1: It was normal movie like.

452
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:27,759
Speaker 0: I guess it felt long because it kind of didn't really know.

453
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:29,297
Speaker 1: Jedi felt long.

454
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,186
Speaker 1: It was long literally.

455
00:29:31,206 --> 00:29:35,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, but last Jedi felt longer than Lawrence of Arabia, which is the longest.

456
00:29:36,022 --> 00:29:36,283
Speaker 1: That's not.

457
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:38,590
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's literally the longest but it's among the longest.

458
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:52,261
Speaker 0: Yep, but it also sort of has this problem where Mary in particular but some other characters, too they react strongly to things that it doesn't make sense for them to react that strongly because there was no context for that kind of Reaction.

459
00:29:53,044 --> 00:29:56,775
Speaker 0: or they don't react very strongly to something that feels like it should be a bigger deal.

460
00:29:56,795 --> 00:30:08,640
Speaker 0: and that happens repeatedly and I guess every theme that you that seems to be woven into the plot Just sort of Peters out by the end and the story ends up being very simplistic.

461
00:30:09,062 --> 00:30:13,000
Speaker 1: The the animation is like pretty good animation, you know, it's a. it's a movie.

462
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,831
Speaker 1: you got a lot of money's put into it, but it's not.

463
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:21,007
Speaker 1: it's obviously not as good as Like the the top tier animations.

464
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:23,495
Speaker 1: It's not as good as shinkai animations.

465
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,320
Speaker 1: It's not as good as the host of the animation.

466
00:30:27,102 --> 00:30:27,585
Speaker 0: It's more like

467
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:32,329
Speaker 1: like even not being someone who's knowledgeable art You can just tell looking at it right like character

468
00:30:32,349 --> 00:30:45,033
Speaker 0: designs in particular the environment designs felt kind of lazy Like you've got Ghibli world and then the rest of it everything that isn't Ghibli world is Kind of a really chaotic mishmash of things that have no like.

469
00:30:45,073 --> 00:30:47,200
Speaker 0: there's no thematic way to link them together.

470
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:56,771
Speaker 1: I think that the a lot of it is just the design of the characters and other things is not really That good overall, you know, it's like you think.

471
00:30:56,791 --> 00:31:01,600
Speaker 1: look at like Princess Mononoke and there's like, you know The part where the boar is covered in the slime monster.

472
00:31:02,281 --> 00:31:05,780
Speaker 1: It's oh my god, you look at it and it's just like fascinating to look at it, right?

473
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,543
Speaker 1: It's like holy shit.

474
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:07,587
Speaker 1: Look at that fucking thing, right?

475
00:31:07,868 --> 00:31:11,140
Speaker 1: Someone came up with that and animated it and it still looks incredible today.

476
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:18,702
Speaker 1: yep, right, but in here this is like a slime ish monster at one point in this movie and You know, it's like it goes through Stage.

477
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:24,220
Speaker 1: look at looking at it doesn't really give you any kind of feeling the way that the the Mononoke board.

478
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,080
Speaker 0: Well at one point it looks like a Dragon Quest slime which really doesn't fit at all with what's going on in that scene.

479
00:31:29,281 --> 00:31:34,733
Speaker 0: No, and then it looks like a weird toddler with hair and it just the plot does.

480
00:31:34,814 --> 00:31:38,891
Speaker 0: the Motivations of the villains in this movie do not make sense.

481
00:31:39,192 --> 00:31:44,429
Speaker 0: No from any standpoint And I like a good example of this.

482
00:31:44,570 --> 00:32:00,600
Speaker 0: and again, I'm just not gonna spoil stuff, but to give you some context There's a point where basically Mary ends up at this witch's school and the head mistress and like the head chief professor come out and they're like, oh you're the new student and they just bring her in and You feel like it's setting up a situation where you see all these students.

483
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:20,060
Speaker 0: there's like this giant Harry Potter ask magical University with tons and tons of students and As you go through you sort of get this sinister vibe because as you get to the more and more advanced students It seems like there's something wrong Like the students at the high level are all wearing sort of Yiga clan masks and it almost seems like it's fake.

484
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:28,800
Speaker 0: Like maybe it's all a trick and you're trying to figure out what's going on And then all those students just kind of disappear and never met never appear again in the rest of the movie.

485
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:34,360
Speaker 0: Nope, like all the things that you find everything that I thought was interesting disappears before the end.

486
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:38,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, why did you introduce these students if they're not in the rest of the movie?

487
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,639
Speaker 0: that creepy-ass room with all the students who are invisible and like doing their weird magic and their masks and all.

488
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:44,683
Speaker 0: they're all Depersonalized.

489
00:32:44,944 --> 00:32:46,790
Speaker 0: and then she casts a spell to make herself disappear.

490
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,800
Speaker 0: and it felt like that scene felt like it was going somewhere.

491
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:51,679
Speaker 0: It goes nowhere and never comes back.

492
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,191
Speaker 0: And I just felt like that happened almost everything I was interested in.

493
00:32:55,211 --> 00:32:56,214
Speaker 1: and it's the other thing.

494
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:59,939
Speaker 1: it does something in the plot That actually bothers me and a lot of other.

495
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,266
Speaker 1: It's this thing that happens in a whole.

496
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:08,698
Speaker 1: it feels like it happens in a lot of other especially anime movies Where you go to the magical world, right?

497
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,000
Speaker 1: You go back home for the magical world and then you go right back to the magical world, right?

498
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:24,380
Speaker 0: It's sort of like this this short trip back and forth thing Right that happens and it's I think it's even worse though cuz the at the end It's like, you know, like Bilbo was by his journey.

499
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:32,630
Speaker 1: They make like getting to the magical world and back home like a plot point like it's difficult to do or something And then it just sort of happens for you know, right.

500
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,112
Speaker 1: so way too quickly without a lot of effort It's like oh no, how will I get back to the magic world?

501
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:37,776
Speaker 1: Oh, look I did it.

502
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,326
Speaker 1: Yep It's like shouldn't it have been?

503
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:44,740
Speaker 0: also Mary comes back and she's changed and that she's no longer ashamed of her red hair.

504
00:33:45,742 --> 00:33:56,308
Speaker 0: But at the same time part of the story around that is that all the witch people tell her that red hair is special and Also, she is totally fine.

505
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:58,439
Speaker 0: Which is resuming her normal life and never seeing magic again.

506
00:33:58,843 --> 00:34:04,117
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm course It kind of makes sense because the moral of the movie seems to be that brooms are really important to this one guy.

507
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:08,980
Speaker 0: magic sucks Like magic just sucks and magic schools suck and stay away from magic.

508
00:34:09,081 --> 00:34:09,829
Speaker 1: It's they can.

509
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,920
Speaker 1: they mix magic.

510
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,629
Speaker 1: Basically love magic and science technology together.

511
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:18,928
Speaker 1: because you know, right science that becomes sufficiently advanced But they don't do anything interesting with that.

512
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:22,460
Speaker 1: and then you know, well, they show you like Oh grandma's house or whatever.

513
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,068
Speaker 0: Even the TV doesn't work.

514
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:30,849
Speaker 1: There's no technology or science or magic there whatsoever Right compared to the other place.

515
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,300
Speaker 0: and that is that could be an interesting contrast.

516
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,594
Speaker 1: They're trying to draw but they don't draw it as well as you know.

517
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:42,493
Speaker 0: now she could cause it Because you could almost read the moral of this movie as yeah technology sucks.

518
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:45,621
Speaker 0: Fuck that live in this ghibli boring paradise It's.

519
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:50,583
Speaker 0: it's hard to says this movie was just a hodgepodge of stuff all thrown together And it won.

520
00:34:50,623 --> 00:34:51,286
Speaker 1: you have a real.

521
00:34:51,326 --> 00:34:58,920
Speaker 1: I wonder how the original book is right because we know that some you know We like Earthsea we know is just a bad adaptation.

522
00:34:59,903 --> 00:35:01,340
Speaker 1: Right because the book is incredible.

523
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:12,280
Speaker 0: well Earthsea had a lot of the same problems actually in that it had a bunch of Disconnected elements thrown together without a consistent story consistent theme consistent style, but it was animated beautifully.

524
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
Speaker 1: But I wonder if the the book of Mary the witch's flower was actually good.

525
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:22,020
Speaker 1: Adaptation was bad or it might be a really good adaptation of a bad book.

526
00:35:22,341 --> 00:35:27,820
Speaker 0: So we also saw the same thing with how's moving castle which kind of didn't make a lot of sense.

527
00:35:28,242 --> 00:35:30,594
Speaker 1: No, it's a nice at least house moving castle.

528
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:31,820
Speaker 1: I was like awesome character.

529
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:33,348
Speaker 0: I was not bored at any point.

530
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:35,640
Speaker 1: during hell's moving on some calcifer action.

531
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:43,778
Speaker 0: I was confused but not bored as many redeeming qualities Although the plot is often like what's going on, but like I would watch hell's moving castle again.

532
00:35:43,798 --> 00:35:44,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure Why not?

533
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:46,550
Speaker 0: I would watch Earthsea again with the sound.

534
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,800
Speaker 0: Oh with the sound off and no subtitles.

535
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,320
Speaker 0: No, but I don't know if I ever need to see Mary in the witch's flower again.

536
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,379
Speaker 1: I don't need to see it again.

537
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:54,065
Speaker 0: I think it would.

538
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:59,212
Speaker 0: it would be a good movie especially the dub though For to like watch with a younger kid if you actually got kids.

539
00:35:59,232 --> 00:36:04,014
Speaker 1: you're looking for a movie to go see my and for some Reason this movie was rated fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.

540
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:05,240
Speaker 0: Everyone seems really into it.

541
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:08,602
Speaker 0: It's weird.

542
00:36:08,622 --> 00:36:11,955
Speaker 1: I know it's like we're sort of saying like it's bad but it's like it's not.

543
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,433
Speaker 1: it's like it doesn't seem like it has Negative qualities.

544
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:17,271
Speaker 1: He's lacking Extremely positive qualities.

545
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

546
00:36:19,341 --> 00:36:21,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would rank it in terms of my.

547
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:21,914
Speaker 0: it's not like.

548
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:22,376
Speaker 0: it was like.

549
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,606
Speaker 1: if a movie's bad I can be like, oh it was boring.

550
00:36:24,686 --> 00:36:25,569
Speaker 1: It was slow.

551
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,212
Speaker 1: It was right.

552
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:26,513
Speaker 1: It's like.

553
00:36:26,875 --> 00:36:28,140
Speaker 1: what can I say bad about this?

554
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,098
Speaker 1: It was like it was me.

555
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:36,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't have good exciting bits and that's you know, it's like I can talk about the positive things.

556
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:42,908
Speaker 1: It's lacking but it's like there wasn't really any major Mistakes or badnesses done in it.

557
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:46,140
Speaker 1: It's not like there was like anime, you know, ugly animations, right?

558
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,681
Speaker 1: It's a movie.

559
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:52,797
Speaker 0: credible animations from good from like okay to good with just some basic editing like.

560
00:36:53,038 --> 00:37:03,627
Speaker 0: there are a bunch of Medial like side points and side plots that appeared and seemed solely to add ten minutes to the runtime and then disappear like Oh, she's got another berry.

561
00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:04,973
Speaker 0: Oh, she lost the berry.

562
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:06,620
Speaker 0: Oh, she got that berry back.

563
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:07,719
Speaker 0: Oh, she didn't need it.

564
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,880
Speaker 0: Anyway, like all this stuff happens that could have been cut out because it was literally immaterial to anything in the movie.

565
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,554
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't see the magic tablet.

566
00:37:15,615 --> 00:37:16,160
Speaker 1: Did you know?

567
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:25,052
Speaker 1: I did not magic tab like London or something as the anime movie about self-driving cars and It also had some problems like especially with pacing and other things.

568
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:27,660
Speaker 1: but I think magic tablet is definitely better than this movie.

569
00:37:28,546 --> 00:37:29,754
Speaker 1: It's better than the witch's flower.

570
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:44,039
Speaker 0: Yeah but I the one thing I can say is as much for saying it was a. we spent a long time breaking the movie down and I don't want to say making fun of it, but there are a lot of Things that were not intended to be funny in the movie.

571
00:37:44,521 --> 00:37:51,959
Speaker 1: But in looking at the movie having seen it are funny in retrospect You almost want to see it just so you can laugh at broom guy jokes.

572
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:01,098
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it is in a stupid Scottish accent brooms like that guy It's just all but like the villain, right?

573
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,799
Speaker 1: The is it worth 90 minutes to whatever is two hours of your life to get the broom.

574
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:17,760
Speaker 0: joke Like the vague overall plot is that the people running the school sort of have this trans humanist Evangelion like experiment they want to run to like bring their school to the next level of like human evolution.

575
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,340
Speaker 0: but What actually happens in the movie is?

576
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,585
Speaker 0: Scientists does experiment.

577
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:26,274
Speaker 0: it goes horribly wrong in the past.

578
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:32,831
Speaker 0: now in the current movie Scientists does the exact same experiment under the exact same circumstances.

579
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,976
Speaker 1: Oh, no the same thing happened.

580
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:36,319
Speaker 0: How could this be?

581
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:42,939
Speaker 0: Just things like that are funny, but not funny in the context of the movie itself.

582
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,932
Speaker 0: So I still think you should watch it.

583
00:38:47,416 --> 00:38:47,939
Speaker 0: it's not bad.

584
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:51,495
Speaker 1: I mean, it's still an anime movie that you know, you can see.

585
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:52,420
Speaker 1: there's not a lot of them.

586
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:59,640
Speaker 1: It's a written original work at least out of its adapted, but it just wasn't very well like my expectations for this.

587
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:01,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't go higher.

588
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:03,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't go in expecting a jubilee level movie.

589
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,835
Speaker 1: But you know, it's still probably worth watching.

590
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:08,684
Speaker 1: if you're an anime fan It's orchid.

591
00:39:09,185 --> 00:39:10,932
Speaker 0: it's better than Earthsea.

592
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:16,112
Speaker 1: in an absolute sense That's right, but I don't think it's always so is the poop that came?

593
00:39:16,132 --> 00:39:27,634
Speaker 0: but I don't think it is better than any other Ghibli movie any other Ghibli movie even the I Can't think of one that I would rank this better than because it has so many just structural flaws.

594
00:39:27,654 --> 00:39:28,256
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

595
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,478
