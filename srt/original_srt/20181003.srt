00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:19,797
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:23,359
Speaker 1: So I don't know if you got this email.

7
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:25,166
Speaker 0: Which one I actually?

8
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:28,820
Speaker 0: I got a couple of emails I was thinking about talking about on the show the one from city bike.

9
00:00:29,282 --> 00:00:31,293
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I got an email from G kids.

10
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:32,057
Speaker 1: Okay.

11
00:00:32,116 --> 00:00:42,231
Speaker 1: No so Like about a week ago I Got an email from city bike - okay I noticed like hey where the fuck did all the city bikes go?

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:48,196
Speaker 1: the docks are empty and then someone else posted on the internet Like hey, are there any city bikes, and I'm like no Astoria is barren.

13
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,080
Speaker 1: There's like no bikes here.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:49,302
Speaker 1: What the?

15
00:00:49,403 --> 00:00:49,907
Speaker 1: oh, that's no.

16
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,630
Speaker 0: cuz the email I got was like yo We saw that you canceled your city bike a while ago.

17
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:54,535
Speaker 0: You want to start it up again.

18
00:00:54,575 --> 00:00:57,073
Speaker 1: No no okay I get it free from work.

19
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:03,175
Speaker 1: so Then Right after we're discussing in that thread like yeah, there's no fucking city bikes anywhere.

20
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:04,519
Speaker 1: They've been gone for like two days.

21
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:06,855
Speaker 1: I get an email from city bike.

22
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:18,640
Speaker 1: all right And I think it was coincidence that people started discussing it on the internet right before the email came, but the email was like yeah There was some issue with like the handlebars or something on a lot of the bikes.

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,105
Speaker 1: So we took them out of service.

24
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:21,450
Speaker 0: Oh the thing where they'll like droop.

25
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:27,651
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is, but they it wasn't very Explicit it was very vague and what the what the problem was.

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,360
Speaker 0: it must have been at least a little bit dangerous.

27
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,184
Speaker 0: That's the only reason.

28
00:01:32,224 --> 00:01:33,589
Speaker 0: they would recall the city by.

29
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,680
Speaker 1: yes, but basically they're apologizing that there's no bikes and even now.

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:45,200
Speaker 0: I biked here on my bike just now because I knew there weren't any outside because the app actually now that I think about it If there's not a lot of city bikes that really fucks up the commute of a lot of people I work with.

31
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,319
Speaker 0: Lot of people were way late the last few days.

32
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,303
Speaker 1: It fucks up a lot.

33
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:59,386
Speaker 1: so that so on my way here on my bike because I knew there were any city bikes outside I passed by one maybe five city bike docks And I saw one city bike.

34
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:01,132
Speaker 1: all the all the docks are empty.

35
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:19,393
Speaker 1: also the last time we did a podcast on Monday yeah, and I was leaving here I go over to grab one to go home And I go over to the bridge where the dock is and it's empty and someone comes down the bridge of the city bike And jams it in there, and I'm like oh, yes I'm grabbing that and it's one of the.

36
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:22,588
Speaker 0: it was one of the e ones I have not yet tried one of those.

37
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:25,480
Speaker 1: it was one of the pedal assist ones which I also have not yet tried.

38
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,183
Speaker 1: So I was it.

39
00:02:26,303 --> 00:02:33,968
Speaker 1: I wanted to go try it and I go over there and that motherfucker pushed the red repair light And I was like you motherfucker You just rode this down the bridge.

40
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:39,649
Speaker 1: safely if the bike works do not push the button Especially at an empty dock where there's none in service.

41
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:42,720
Speaker 1: you only push the red button if the bike is unrideable.

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,203
Speaker 0: He was already gone I didn't?

43
00:02:46,223 --> 00:02:46,504
Speaker 1: you know.

44
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:54,900
Speaker 1: you only push the repair button which takes the bike out of service if The bike is literally unsafe to ride or impossible to ride.

45
00:02:55,602 --> 00:03:00,745
Speaker 1: If like the brakes were a little weak or squeaky or if the gear shifter is a little messed up But it's still.

46
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:05,391
Speaker 1: you know you can still pedal and go Even if you stuck in one gear right.

47
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:07,439
Speaker 1: if it has a flat tire you push the button.

48
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,231
Speaker 1: yeah If the brakes don't work you push the button right.

49
00:03:10,371 --> 00:03:12,360
Speaker 1: otherwise if I give that battery was dead.

50
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:14,459
Speaker 1: Don't push the buy.

51
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:16,417
Speaker 1: What's wrong with people?

52
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,780
Speaker 1: Especially when there's not bikes in service?

53
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:27,620
Speaker 0: You know I imagine the average person doesn't think about like they the the idea of considering How many bikes are at the dock they're dropping on when there's plenty of bikes?

54
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,229
Speaker 1: That's the policy for pushing the button.

55
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,922
Speaker 0: now if there's plenty of bikes if there's anything wrong with the bike I hit that button.

56
00:03:32,022 --> 00:03:32,925
Speaker 1: I don't hit it otherwise.

57
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:34,830
Speaker 0: They'll never fix the bike.

58
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:36,114
Speaker 1: I don't know.

59
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:39,623
Speaker 1: I hit it when it's actually like Beyond.

60
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,164
Speaker 0: you know if it's even a little annoying I'll hit the button.

61
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:44,295
Speaker 1: then you hit the button on every single city bike.

62
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:46,864
Speaker 1: just go down the whole dock City bike.

63
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:54,420
Speaker 0: that worked fine and in fact the brakes actually Stopped the city bike like reliably which I have not experienced before.

64
00:03:55,206 --> 00:04:01,764
Speaker 1: usually those brakes are just The brakes usually work Usually the shifter.

65
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:02,666
Speaker 1: that's an issue.

66
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:08,405
Speaker 0: thing is I don't really need city bike still because I can park my bike inside my building in A really nice bike parking.

67
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:13,246
Speaker 1: I know I use it for things like I'm gonna go ride the subway But I can go to the subway.

68
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:15,780
Speaker 0: yeah, well, that's it because I live next to the subway.

69
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,478
Speaker 1: I use it for things like oh, I can just go over to.

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,715
Speaker 1: You know like you could use it for example to go down to LIC and eat it.

71
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:25,100
Speaker 1: take casa Enrique.

72
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,912
Speaker 0: I just biked there with my regular bike.

73
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:28,982
Speaker 0: No one's stealing a bike in Queens I'm just saying.

74
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:34,739
Speaker 0: you know though actually what I would use it for is to bike to other nearby subways like the E.

75
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:36,226
Speaker 1: That's also good.

76
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:42,015
Speaker 1: You know that's the kind of thing you use it for yeah at work But I want to eat lunch somewhere slightly far away from work.

77
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:42,900
Speaker 1: It could be done.

78
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:48,476
Speaker 0: So in some other will will meta will probably not even matter will probably skip next Thursday's show.

79
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,773
Speaker 0: cuz I'm just kind of Emily And I were randomly going to London to dick around.

89
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,144
Speaker 0: one thing I can say that's funny.

90
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:44,577
Speaker 0: Is that the more I travel like as I traveled more and more and more in my life Not only do I plan travel later and worry about it less But I roll into the airport like right before my flight, but I basically plan nothing.

91
00:05:44,637 --> 00:05:46,224
Speaker 1: my plan is Go to the.

92
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:46,888

93
00:05:47,109 --> 00:05:47,793
Speaker 1: I got a hotel.

00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,289
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna lay on the beach.

96
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,620
Speaker 1: I don't need any plans.

97
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:54,238
Speaker 1: I assume there'll be food there that I can find once I'm there.

98
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,664
Speaker 1: yep I don't need my phone even to work Like.

99
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:03,859
Speaker 0: I know my way around like central London better than I know my way around Brooklyn, so I don't need what do I need?

100
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,227
Speaker 1: You know I don't need anything there.

101
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:08,275
Speaker 1: the hotel will provide a beach.

102
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,339
Speaker 1: It has a beach on it.

103
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,388
Speaker 1: It has food.

104
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:11,035
Speaker 1: it has a bed.

105
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:14,640
Speaker 1: Yeah No, my planning was basically bring a book with me.

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,364
Speaker 0: She just goes somewhere that weekend, and I just went on kayak, and I was like Paris.

107
00:06:19,404 --> 00:06:19,967
Speaker 0: and then I looked.

108
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:24,371
Speaker 0: and it is way more Expensive to fly to Paris right now than I'm used to.

109
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:27,284
Speaker 0: I don't know why like way more I fell out is cheap.

110
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:28,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, but for whatever reason.

111
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,113
Speaker 0: It's way cheap to fly to London right now, so hey Mom went to London now.

112
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:35,004
Speaker 0: Oh What's she doing?

113
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:36,068
Speaker 0: They're just hanging out hanging out?

114
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,734
Speaker 0: Yeah, is she like central London?

115
00:06:37,794 --> 00:06:37,915
Speaker 0: like?

116
00:06:37,955 --> 00:06:38,316
Speaker 0: where is she?

117
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:39,179
Speaker 0: you don't know?

118
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,703
Speaker 1: What do I know about London?

119
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:43,072
Speaker 1: This is a big band, and there's a castle.

120
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,260
Speaker 0: I know about diamonds is you know?

121
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,225
Speaker 1: Fancy taxis that are black.

122
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,051
Speaker 1: they call the subway the underground yep.

123
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,780
Speaker 0: their subway is very they talk funny.

124
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:53,228
Speaker 0: London and Paris the only cities.

125
00:06:53,268 --> 00:06:55,500
Speaker 0: I've been to where the subway is like the New York subway.

126
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:57,514
Speaker 0: Paris way more so than London.

127
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:00,575
Speaker 0: It's not 24/7 Paris's is parts of it.

128
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:03,071
Speaker 0: at least Paris is the closest to New York.

129
00:07:03,332 --> 00:07:08,338
Speaker 0: London is real close, but yeah It doesn't run at night and the central line is a bunch of weird construction.

130
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:23,558
Speaker 0: like the last time I went the station I normally use to like get from Paddington to where I'm going was just closed and because I don't live there It's not like I get their equivalent of the MTA Notifications, it's not like I'm getting the thing that says yo the station's closed on this day actually

131
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:27,835
Speaker 1: really notify You can get I guess but I can have the notify NYC app.

132
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,305
Speaker 1: That's like yo Helicopters coming.

133
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,132
Speaker 1: yeah, there's a flood.

134
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:37,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you know well I use the MTA three what we are 311 app.

135
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:40,798
Speaker 0: but 99% of what I do with it is get people's cars towed for parking in the bike lane.

136
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:41,882
Speaker 1: you get the notify NYC.

137
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:43,811
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, I think I got that too.

138
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,439
Speaker 0: I got the notification today.

139
00:07:46,422 --> 00:07:54,888
Speaker 0: The funny thing is when we get the flood warnings like everyone's phone goes off at once with this thing it like rolled across the Office for about 20 minutes like back and forth

140
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,530
Speaker 1: mm-hmm

141
00:07:56,373 --> 00:08:01,216
Speaker 0: and almost no one knew It was happening like no one knew what it was except

142
00:08:01,256 --> 00:08:02,020
Speaker 1: not read news.

143
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,020
Speaker 0: I guess not the only people who knew it was coming were the people who pay attention to politics and the young people.

144
00:08:07,782 --> 00:08:11,335
Speaker 0: All the non young people who don't pay attention to politics had no idea.

145
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:15,900
Speaker 0: and the funniest thing was Everyone coming out of like the elevator like I was leaving.

146
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaker 0: I was like everyone who came out of buildings later.

147
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:22,218
Speaker 0: It just went off like I guess their phone wasn't getting signal until they came to the ground floor.

148
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:33,559
Speaker 0: Hmm, so yeah, it's a Wednesday so in the news it looks like there's a. This is perhaps the epitome of too little too late the well I don't know what the deal is here.

149
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,910
Speaker 1: So they're gonna make a movie somehow based on dance dance revolution.

150
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,798
Speaker 1: Konami's money is behind it.

151
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:39,380
Speaker 1: who fucking?

152
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:44,594
Speaker 1: But it's the 20th anniversary of DDR so that has something to do with it.

153
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:45,216
Speaker 1: They're actually.

154
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:46,300
Speaker 1: they did some cool stuff.

155
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,720
Speaker 1: It's like the new DDR machines have a mode in them apparently that they added for the anniversary.

156
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:57,560
Speaker 1: That lets you load up the the menus and stuff and stuff, so it looks like the old mixes.

157
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,580
Speaker 0: That actually gets me really excited.

158
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:08,608
Speaker 0: So as much as I make fun and even though DDR is kind of dead I just really want to play DDR right now.

159
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:09,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

160
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,440
Speaker 1: but the point is they're making some movie.

161
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,259
Speaker 1: That seems really really dumb.

162
00:09:14,964 --> 00:09:17,760
Speaker 1: Somehow be I've seen DDR appear in movies.

163
00:09:18,063 --> 00:09:19,640
Speaker 0: Well, we saw it appear in wasabi.

164
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:26,766
Speaker 1: I've seen it appear on TV shows and comics and all sorts of other mediums, but I've never seen something that was about DDR.

165
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,819
Speaker 1: that seems really dumb.

166
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:34,777
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean the best case scenario the best possible case Like initial D.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,320
Speaker 1: The only way to make a movie about DDR that would be good would be to make a documentary about DDR champions.

168
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,946
Speaker 0: I'll bet you could make a movie.

169
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:48,149
Speaker 0: That was the aesthetic and style of initial D. But just about DDR like that could work.

170
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,979
Speaker 1: You could do it about all rhythm games, but not just DDR.

171
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:52,962
Speaker 0: It's not enough to work.

172
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:53,926
Speaker 1: It's not enough to work with.

173
00:09:53,946 --> 00:10:02,585
Speaker 0: you got Takumi the kid who just sits at the arcade The kid who's really good at DDR, but doesn't like DDR doesn't even like no one knows He only he's dead.

174
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:07,180
Speaker 0: He works at the bowling alley and he plays DDR at night when he's doing maintenance.

175
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,230
Speaker 1: There's the kid who's actually like, you know, the head boss.

176
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,738
Speaker 1: He's legendary at DDR, but you never see him.

177
00:10:12,898 --> 00:10:13,460
Speaker 1: do any move.

178
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,425
Speaker 0: Oh, that's Ken's game.

179
00:10:14,726 --> 00:10:16,655
Speaker 1: Right and then what you got?

180
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:17,660
Speaker 1: the guy who?

181
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,737
Speaker 1: Best DDR shoes.

182
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:23,197
Speaker 1: There's no other guy.

183
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:33,899
Speaker 0: The guy who does the matrix is only so many character machine and like cuts his arm the guy who's all style and and Tape the dude's arms to the bar.

184
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:35,383
Speaker 1: Come on.

185
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:39,340
Speaker 0: I feel like that you'd have to go crazy with it for it to be good.

186
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,094
Speaker 0: I feel like this is gonna be a gem in the holograms the movie situation.

187
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:49,284
Speaker 0: I Just I. DDR is kind of dead like even at the cons like at mag fast There really aren't.

188
00:10:49,324 --> 00:11:02,760
Speaker 1: it has a minor resurgence right now, but not it's not a resurgence among the people It's a resurgence and that the people who are into it Have it more than they used to because they're actually putting some machines over here in places and updating them.

189
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,299
Speaker 1: But meanwhile step you go to certain places in the US.

190
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:10,719
Speaker 1: now there are new machines that are updated and hooked up to the score system and that's how I think we talked about this before.

191
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,880
Speaker 1: how The world champion of DDR is from America like last year the year before I forget.

192
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:19,800
Speaker 0: But meanwhile step mania has kind of gotten worse like there's not more people into it, but the people were into it.

193
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,847
Speaker 1: It's like it's get.

194
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,879
Speaker 1: they're getting a little bit more support than these two.

195
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:30,042
Speaker 0: But in all the cons where they're quote-unquote DDR machines like mag fast used to have like a bunch of legit DDR machines all different Mixes.

196
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:36,087
Speaker 0: it's all these kind of shitty laggy bootleggy machines now And I'm really curious like what?

197
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:47,252
Speaker 1: like how come there are no DDR machines older than extreme did like all of them Just like did all the third fourth fifth mixes in the world just like get updated to you know They can't get updated all the way.

198
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:52,980
Speaker 0: third fourth fifth I'm not gonna get into it, but I'm saying I think there are several generations of machines.

199
00:11:53,722 --> 00:12:02,238
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying like it seems like all the machines of a certain generation were updated like are there any fourth mix plus machines in the world anywhere on earth?

200
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:12,853
Speaker 0: There was one of the machines at mag fest this past year was a was clearly a fourth mix plus machine But it had some bootleg bullshit inside of it like it was not the DDR.

201
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:15,060
Speaker 1: I'm saying is there a fourth mix plus machine?

202
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,080
Speaker 1: That's actually running fourth mix plus in its original form.

203
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,826
Speaker 0: I have to imagine it on earth anywhere.

204
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,798
Speaker 1: if there's one anywhere have all of those because there were many.

205
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:24,505
Speaker 1: there were thousands Hundreds of me.

206
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:29,159
Speaker 0: I feel like they got bought by people who then took them home and modded them And that's where they live now.

207
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:29,642
Speaker 0: I don't know.

208
00:12:30,024 --> 00:12:31,089
Speaker 0: there might be one in Japan.

209
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,360
Speaker 0: if there's one anywhere it might be still at the putt-putt.

210
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:34,262
Speaker 1: I don't know.

211
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,634
Speaker 1: that was a regular fourth mix not a plus.

212
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,478
Speaker 0: I know I know.

213
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:46,785
Speaker 0: So in some other news anime fest and New York comic-con are this weekend and thank Satan That I'm not going.

214
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:50,216
Speaker 0: I think I've skipped once the last seven years of this nonsense.

215
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:52,380
Speaker 1: I went the first year I didn't go to it.

216
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,182
Speaker 1: I walked past it to see what the deal was and there was a big mega line And it was.

217
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,974
Speaker 0: it was a shit shows a failure.

218
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:04,137
Speaker 1: the second year I went to it just one night to go in and see one person and say hi I just look around and then I left.

219
00:13:04,178 --> 00:13:07,595
Speaker 0: well We got free badges every year until we just stop picking up the free badge.

220
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:08,659
Speaker 1: went to it like.

221
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:13,120
Speaker 1: We went to it for like one day when the anime fest was there, and we had a panel.

222
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:18,380
Speaker 1: No when we went to it also the next morning to see a Makoto shinkai's movie that wasn't good yep.

223
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:19,688
Speaker 0: And then none of the.

224
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:19,989
Speaker 0: I remember.

225
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:24,860
Speaker 0: there was the I don't remember the name of the movie And then there was the interview with him and we were just gonna see the panel.

226
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,239
Speaker 0: We were in the room and literally no media were there, so I just filmed the whole thing myself.

227
00:13:30,962 --> 00:13:32,428
Speaker 0: My video is the only video of it.

228
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:36,928
Speaker 1: and then I don't remember But we all went to a bunch of.

229
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,980
Speaker 1: I haven't been to it in many many years.

230
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:46,696
Speaker 0: I went to more of them and did panels without you and I used to get me and Emily used to get Professional badges every year, but there was increasingly just no reason.

231
00:13:46,736 --> 00:13:58,236
Speaker 0: even when I did go to it I usually went to it for a day like honestly, New York comic-con is now in the class of Conventions that are the anti pattern for how to run a fun enjoyable engaging convention.

232
00:13:58,577 --> 00:14:04,420
Speaker 1: for people like us It's basically San Diego comic-con, but worse, but it's in the United States, but it's in New York.

233
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,040
Speaker 1: The other one San Diego is also in the United States.

234
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:18,473
Speaker 0: So we've talked about how they added the anime fest back to it But like five asterisks next to what I just said It's in a different location not accessible by any form of transportation.

235
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,620
Speaker 0: That's weird and far away and cause extra.

236
00:14:21,222 --> 00:14:24,010
Speaker 0: There is no way the anime fest thing is gonna succeed.

237
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,735
Speaker 0: Like I am confident.

238
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:28,144
Speaker 0: No one's gonna go to this thing I don't know.

239
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:35,907
Speaker 1: I don't know but there are actually a lot of Events happening around it that are yeah That email that I got from not only like.

240
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,880
Speaker 1: there's some like this individual specific things that I've seen people excited for.

241
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,113
Speaker 1: For example, there is a panel.

242
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:43,681
Speaker 1: There's a Someone's.

243
00:14:43,802 --> 00:14:58,305
Speaker 1: they're making an official babymetal graphic novel that will supposedly reveal the very, you know secretive lore to some extent and the person who the person who made this graphic novel has doing a panel and People are like, oh shit.

244
00:14:58,325 --> 00:14:59,328
Speaker 1: We got to send any questions.

245
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:02,560
Speaker 1: We got to do a livestream like they're organized around this one panel.

246
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:10,738
Speaker 1: There's also gonna be like some sort of a whole bunch of like anime Idol j-pop kind of concert situation going on.

247
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:21,232
Speaker 1: Yep You know, there's certain like individual events that on their own are like, whoa, that's pretty great But as a whole the event seems like not so good.

248
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:21,814
Speaker 0: Yep.

249
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was that G kids email.

250
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:34,280
Speaker 0: There's basically there's some sort of like G-kids Party at some venue like over on 38th Street the night before and I got an invite to it for some reason.

251
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:35,867
Speaker 1: Go have fun.

252
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:39,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I'm not going to Review con.

253
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:44,914
Speaker 0: Okay So yeah, but the news is not that we've talked about all this before.

254
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:47,284
Speaker 0: like there's a we don't go to this kind of con Cuz they're not.

255
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:48,049
Speaker 0: it's not for us.

256
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:48,713
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

257
00:15:49,337 --> 00:15:58,340
Speaker 0: But What we used to say is that We could take the seven train from our houses to this con and we still don't bother going.

258
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,480
Speaker 1: Well the time that we that's how long ago was we went to it.

259
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,659
Speaker 0: There was no seven trains.

260
00:16:03,523 --> 00:16:05,411
Speaker 1: The seven train did not go there.

261
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:10,056
Speaker 1: when the last time I went to the New York Comic Con I had to walk there from like 34th Street.

262
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 1: But now the seven train goes to the Javits and I don't go there anymore.

263
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,374
Speaker 1: But Yeah, the seven train this weekend is not running.

264
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:21,920
Speaker 1: it's being replaced by a shuttle bus.

265
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,611
Speaker 0: Yep, so there's no way to get to New York Comic Con except a bus.

266
00:16:25,932 --> 00:16:28,340
Speaker 1: Well, it's just like it was in the old days.

267
00:16:29,861 --> 00:16:37,026
Speaker 0: Even worse a lot of the people who come to New York Comic Con come from outside of the city for like one day Like half a day like take a

Speaker 0: But also a lot of people take the train in and Remember how I said earlier that I got kind of fucked in London that like Lancaster Gate Station was closed And I didn't get a notification because I don't live in London.

275
00:16:54,961 --> 00:17:03,492
Speaker 0: a lot of people think they're gonna go from Grand Central on the seven train to this con and they're gonna get told to go Ride a weird bus that's gonna be stuck in travel.

276
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,920
Speaker 1: They're gonna go in down into the station.

Speaker 0: So yeah, I just think that's really funny.

290
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:56,680
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

291
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:05,280
Speaker 0: so I was watching a bunch of YouTube videos and It's funny to say that someone stepped up their game when their game is already so high.

292
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:08,272
Speaker 0: But I was always a fan of Captain Disillusion, but he's like a.

293
00:18:08,393 --> 00:18:09,176
Speaker 1: you know, he's a video.

294
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,519
Speaker 1: if you don't know this guy He's like a video master.

295
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:21,077
Speaker 1: So like he's basically so meta on YouTube because he makes YouTube videos But he is a video master and his videos he makes are about videos on YouTube.

296
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:22,501
Speaker 1: Yeah, right He'll be like.

297
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:28,920
Speaker 1: basically finds videos that have you know weird stuff happening and then he sort of debunks them and he's like.

298
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,774
Speaker 1: He's like yeah, you think that this person's turning invisible how they do that.

299
00:18:32,835 --> 00:18:34,220
Speaker 1: I'll show you exactly how they did it.

300
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:34,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, you do.

301
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:35,648
Speaker 0: look so you can tell.

302
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:37,620
Speaker 0: use a tripod here and look at this and look at that.

303
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,387
Speaker 0: Here's the pixels.

304
00:18:38,427 --> 00:18:39,194
Speaker 0: There's his mask.

305
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:47,831
Speaker 0: So He has stepped up his game from its already amazing game in a big way Like I but I was just clicking through.

306
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,980
Speaker 0: like I clicked on one of his random videos.

307
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:53,870
Speaker 0: I was just clicking around in it Like like what's the deal with this one?

308
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,679
Speaker 0: because it looked like a pretty cool thing and I was curious Like how he debunks this and what the deal was cuz I've never heard of it.

309
00:19:00,302 --> 00:19:06,396
Speaker 0: But then I noticed something when I clicked on a random frame in this video that I hadn't actually watched the thing.

310
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:08,564
Speaker 1: What thing?

311
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:10,698
Speaker 0: the sentinel from RIT?

312
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,692
Speaker 0: Okay, so I was like wait wait wait wait what the what what what?

313
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:17,575
Speaker 0: so I had to back.

314
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:24,988
Speaker 1: realize for us This is so the set if you don't know at RIT the college we went to while we were there They built the thing they built.

315
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:27,800
Speaker 1: they spent a bunch of money that didn't come from student money.

316
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,608
Speaker 1: It came from some in some donation.

317
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we couldn't add.

318
00:19:30,472 --> 00:19:32,420
Speaker 0: we complained about it, but we couldn't really complain.

319
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,767
Speaker 1: I mean whoever donated the money.

320
00:19:33,807 --> 00:19:36,159
Speaker 1: Why'd you donate it for a statue instead of for a fucking?

321
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:41,520
Speaker 0: no I do like the statue Making fun of the statue as well.

322
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,054
Speaker 1: They built this giant statue that's sort of vaguely in the shape of a knight with a lance.

323
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:52,136
Speaker 1: that not really though But it's and all the pieces of it look like rusty metal weird purpose.

324
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:53,280
Speaker 1: It's somewhat abstract.

325
00:19:53,883 --> 00:19:56,940
Speaker 1: You know, it's it's an acquired taste this statue, but it was a big deal.

326
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,613
Speaker 1: well, cuz we were there and they put it in.

327
00:19:59,218 --> 00:20:03,351
Speaker 1: but Realized though that like for students now, it's just there.

328
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:03,772
Speaker 1: It's just.

329
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,920
Speaker 1: it's an accepted like thing.

330
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,997
Speaker 1: They don't realize that like they don't have that experience as a science situation.

331
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:10,560
Speaker 1: It's like for us.

332
00:20:10,821 --> 00:20:14,013
Speaker 1: It's like the quad there was like the infinite spinning infinity thing.

333
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:15,940
Speaker 1: We just accepted it that it was there.

334
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,032
Speaker 1: It wasn't like some new thing to complain about.

335
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:19,735
Speaker 0: Yep.

336
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,060
Speaker 0: So I just saw the thing.

337
00:20:21,881 --> 00:20:22,687
Speaker 1: It's enormous.

338
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,156
Speaker 1: You don't realize how big this thing is.

339
00:20:24,217 --> 00:20:25,864
Speaker 0: It's Look for scale.

340
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,369
Speaker 0: There's a person standing next to it.

341
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:29,175
Speaker 1: I think it's like four or five stories tall.

342
00:20:29,196 --> 00:20:30,219
Speaker 1: Maybe it is huge.

343
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,025
Speaker 1: It's really.

344
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,477
Speaker 1: it's as big as like an apartment building.

345
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:32,820
Speaker 1: It's tall.

346
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,190
Speaker 0: So I watched this video and the videos like.

347
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:35,893
Speaker 0: so.

348
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:41,561
Speaker 0: apparently there's a viral video I just never noticed about this Asherian stairwell that did it Like.

349
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:47,760
Speaker 0: it looked like an MCS your thing if you walked in it and apparently it was in building 7 and I was like what?

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,825
Speaker 0: I don't remember this fucking thing.

351
00:20:50,407 --> 00:20:57,299
Speaker 0: There's nothing like that in building 7 and of course it was a hoax perpetrated by RIT students at RIT.

352
00:20:58,443 --> 00:20:59,707
Speaker 1: So here you go, so dr.

353
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,991
Speaker 1: Disillusion was dismissed.

354
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:03,900
Speaker 1: he's debunking some RIT students who thought they were too clever.

355
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,980
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's good because this now intersects RIT and Captain Disillusion.

356
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,673
Speaker 0: So you're unfamiliar with either of those two things.

357
00:21:13,094 --> 00:21:14,099
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is for you.

358
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:19,600
Speaker 0: I don't understand why 2,000 people dislike this video RIT students.

359
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:28,189
Speaker 0: Because I was like building 7. there is nothing like that in building 7 because I broke into building 7 and explored the entire thing In the middle of the night multiple times.

360
00:21:28,772 --> 00:21:29,456
Speaker 1: I worked in building 7.

361
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:33,954
Speaker 0: Yeah Building 7 was the building that was open at night and you could bust into and wander around.

362
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:34,877
Speaker 0: there were art.

363
00:21:34,898 --> 00:21:35,701
Speaker 1: students had to do Art.

364
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:36,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there were.

365
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:40,856
Speaker 0: there were weird that like building 7 had the most weird areas.

366
00:21:40,876 --> 00:21:42,280
Speaker 1: It was like two combined buildings.

367
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:48,263
Speaker 0: Yep, it had like all these balconies that weren't accessible to students that you could kind of get out on to and anyway What do you got?

368
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,012
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's just a tweet.

369
00:21:50,072 --> 00:21:55,960
Speaker 1: but in the tweet is a video and The tweet has a joke in it, but the joke is you know for machine learning people.

370
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:59,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point is the video is awesome whether you understand the joke or not.

371
00:21:59,435 --> 00:22:00,620
Speaker 1: if you understand the joke, that's great.

372
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,723
Speaker 1: If not, the video is this door on I think what it looks like a barn or some sort of like a garage Something like that.

373
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,668
Speaker 0: There's a car in there.

374
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:10,919
Speaker 1: It is an awesome fucking door.

375
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:15,880
Speaker 1: If we get the house to put a DDR machine in we should have only doors like this.

376
00:22:16,081 --> 00:22:20,640
Speaker 0: So the only problem with this door and the reason I think about it is because remember the marble machine.

377
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,160
Speaker 0: Oh, the guy's making the new machine, which by the way, it's getting close to completion.

378
00:22:24,321 --> 00:22:27,115
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna get ready to buy tickets to the New York.

379
00:22:27,296 --> 00:22:28,060
Speaker 0: The guy's awesome.

380
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:37,000
Speaker 0: Okay with the winter gotten guy is like super cute and super funny Like it's very good videos to watch and I saw one of my engineers watching one of his videos while he was coding today.

381
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:40,065
Speaker 0: That's why I was thinking about him But he made a point.

382
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:52,960
Speaker 0: cuz he's making the machine he has this stuff and he starts talking about how someone on the internet pointed Out that a part of the machine he had designed Would very easily if he wasn't paying attention literally crush his entire foot flat.

383
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:55,466
Speaker 0: So I'm looking at this door.

384
00:22:55,486 --> 00:22:59,100
Speaker 0: This door is guaranteed to crush someone's finger completely.

385
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:02,354
Speaker 1: I think the main problem with the door is that it is not ADA compliant.

386
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:04,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, ADA compliant It will crush you.

387
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:06,220
Speaker 0: that will destroy your finger.

388
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:06,762
Speaker 1: I think it's.

389
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,700
Speaker 1: you can only open the door if you have like an arm and you can stand and move to the side.

390
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,889
Speaker 1: I think that's the problem with the door.

391
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:12,876
Speaker 0: There's also no ramp here.

392
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:15,272
Speaker 1: There's multiple Good part about the door.

393
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,420
Speaker 1: Is that once you open it?

394
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,793
Speaker 1: You don't have to like you never have to hold the door open.

395
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:19,658
Speaker 1: You don't need a door.

396
00:23:19,718 --> 00:23:21,827
Speaker 1: stop You don't need anything like that, right?

397
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:22,169
Speaker 1: You can.

398
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,093
Speaker 1: you open the door.

399
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:23,836
Speaker 1: It's open.

400
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:24,800
Speaker 1: That's just a portal.

401
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:26,673
Speaker 1: You can open the door a little bit and close it.

402
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,624
Speaker 0: It's closed Yeah, but it does.

403
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:29,830
Speaker 1: and it's cool.

404
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,979
Speaker 1: and it is cool like opening the door.

405
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:37,012
Speaker 1: It will provide you joy Whenever you enter or leave the space in the meta moment the yingas book.

406
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:40,904
Speaker 0: a book is apparently still Homer's Odyssey Still not updated.

407
00:23:40,924 --> 00:23:42,892
Speaker 1: That's the one thing that I plan to do today.

408
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:44,780
Speaker 1: that I didn't do because I was busy editing.

409
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:51,832
Speaker 1: Judge Anime by its cover winter 2018 which is now rendering and I'll upload it when I get home.

410
00:23:51,872 --> 00:23:53,740
Speaker 1: So yes, I'm uploading it.

411
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:04,774
Speaker 1: I will update the website of frontworkrew.com to say that the current book club book is not Homer's Odyssey But is instead R. Z. Clarke's Space Odyssey 2001.

412
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:05,978
Speaker 0: So Judge Anime by its cover.

Speaker 0: We've done this a bunch of times.

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,063
Speaker 0: The new one is just about to go out.

416
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:21,338
Speaker 0: we review every coming season of anime before it comes out based solely on the information On Anna charts and we're pretty accurate about the quality of these shows and whether or not they're worth watching.

417
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:27,120
Speaker 1: other meta We already talked about what shows we are and aren't doing in the near future because the trips to London and tropical islands.

Speaker 0: we could go to her for one day But we're not gonna do a panel at it.

438
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:45,339
Speaker 0: Not because why didn't submit anything because I realized They have a policy around like they had this really big thing in their panel thing around.

439
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,346
Speaker 0: now You can't show like do the?

440
00:25:47,386 --> 00:25:51,900
Speaker 0: do you have permission like written permission for clips and stuff like that?

441
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,124
Speaker 0: You want to include in your panel.

442
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:58,720
Speaker 0: all our good anime content involves showing stuff and I didn't want to go through that hassle.

443
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:02,976
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz the only other anime content we have is that doesn't involve.

444
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:05,967
Speaker 0: that is really good But it's really stale.

445
00:26:06,008 --> 00:26:09,280
Speaker 0: Like we haven't written a new anime panel like that because we still go to anime Boston.

446
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,813
Speaker 1: Yeah in five plus years how much the tickets cost for one day man.

447
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:13,756
Speaker 0: No idea.

448
00:26:13,837 --> 00:26:14,700
Speaker 1: I want to take a look at it.

449
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,084
Speaker 1: What is it?

450
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:16,479
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

451
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:24,100
Speaker 0: We have so many paxes to deal with plus magfest that and zenk icon at least for me that I just don't have time.

452
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,139
Speaker 0: Like I'm running out of room to deal with cons.

453
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:34,975
Speaker 1: Anime NYC which is not the thing that's happening in conjunction legit with with the New York Comic Con this weekend is a different anime con though.

454
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:39,194
Speaker 1: It's also in the Javits is November 16th through 18th.

455
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,773
Speaker 1: Order by October 15th to get your tickets mail.

456
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,300
Speaker 0: Oh, we can still order them get a mail.

457
00:26:45,663 --> 00:26:46,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, how much are they?

458
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,719
Speaker 0: Let's see who even knows?

459
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,231
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know what conventions cost anymore a mega ticket.

460
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:53,435
Speaker 1: nod some bullshit right there.

461
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:57,436
Speaker 1: All right Sunday ticket 40 bucks Mmm, maybe we'll see.

462
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,474
Speaker 0: so we watch an anime and we're gonna review it.

463
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:06,981
Speaker 0: and Before we get into that we need to point out that Akagi and Kaiji are not the same thing Right.

464
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,050
Speaker 1: So who's the creator of this?

465
00:27:08,191 --> 00:27:08,715
Speaker 1: What's the guy's name?

466
00:27:08,776 --> 00:27:10,924
Speaker 0: Oh god Wikipedia brand.

467
00:27:11,044 --> 00:27:17,944
Speaker 1: so this is a person who made these manga and this anime based on two of these mangas And or three.

468
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,690
Speaker 1: it may be three anyway three.

469
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:21,676
Speaker 1: So first they made one.

470
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:24,989
Speaker 1: I forget what it's called Because no one's ever talks about it.

471
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:28,062
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there was a spin-off of this manga they created It was.

472
00:27:28,204 --> 00:27:29,620
Speaker 1: it was a manga about mahjong.

473
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:35,957
Speaker 1: There was a spin-off called Akagi which is also about mahjong and that Akagi became an anime.

474
00:27:36,157 --> 00:27:39,526
Speaker 1: and that's when I first heard of Because I saw this Akagi mahjong anime.

475
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:50,920
Speaker 1: then there was a brand new thing unrelated to the first things Called Kaiji, which I confused with Akagi But I knew that it was related because I had the same exact art style.

476
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:52,726
Speaker 1: It was clearly by the same creator.

477
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:54,653
Speaker 1: the animes and the manga's look the same.

478
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,560
Speaker 1: I thought it was also about mahjong.

479
00:27:56,881 --> 00:27:57,343
Speaker 1: It's not.

480
00:27:57,784 --> 00:28:06,440
Speaker 0: Kaiji is about gambling in general and not just about mahjong Yep, and because I vaguely knew that like Akagi was a spin-off or something.

481
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,519
Speaker 1: and Okay, we got these things confused until just now.

482
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:15,480
Speaker 0: Yep, apparently most of the internet also confuses and conflates them for what I can tell right?

483
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:26,059
Speaker 1: Anyway, there was a spin-off of Kaiji that we judged Last season on judging a by its cover called tonagawa middle manager, whatever.

484
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:31,480
Speaker 0: Yeah There's a lot of different English titles for the chronicles of middle manager to konagawa middle management blues.

485
00:28:31,861 --> 00:28:34,354
Speaker 1: So here's the deal in Kaiji from.

486
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:42,947
Speaker 1: I've never watched Kaiji But in middle manager, they give you basically summaries of what happened in Kaiji So you can sort of figure out what the deal is.

487
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaker 1: It seems like what happened in Kaiji is an evil company, right?

488
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the boss of this evil company was the most evil head boss person and he's bored and he's bored.

489
00:28:53,861 --> 00:29:08,600
Speaker 1: so he got his employees to create this ridiculous gambling game of death and Kaiji the main character of Kaiji got involved in this horrible gambling game of death and That game existed to entertain the big evil guy in charge of the company

490
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:14,920
Speaker 0: Yep And like the second boss like the sub boss of the show was this tonagawa guy who was like a second.

491
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,318
Speaker 1: It was the second in command was this guy named tonagawa who did most of the work setting up this evil game of death.

492
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:24,548
Speaker 1: So What is tonagawa's middle manager?

493
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:34,500
Speaker 1: It's a completely separate anime that shows you how Tonagawa the middle manager second-in-command of the evil company whose boss is the head boss.

494
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,110
Speaker 1: He's basically the vice president.

495
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:38,700
Speaker 1: Tonagawa is the vice president.

496
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,980
Speaker 1: It shows you how this the main character is the second-in-command guy.

497
00:29:42,603 --> 00:29:49,375
Speaker 1: It shows you the story of how he created the game of death Which I presume is the main plot of Kaiji itself.

498
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:55,860
Speaker 0: and it's literally like He's thinking about going to golf and he's like a middle manager like doing HR paperwork or whatever.

499
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,979
Speaker 0: And then the big boss is like, yeah, I need you to make a game of death for me.

500
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:12,333
Speaker 0: So it ruins his weekend and his job like he gets a team together and it's literally just like board meetings and HR shit and like how do I put this together?

501
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,140
Speaker 1: and office jokes like Dilbert?

502
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,792
Speaker 1: Yep, but at the same time like even though he's also a bad guy.

503
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:23,870
Speaker 1: He's also terrified of his insane boss But he's also trying to keep his.

504
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,280
Speaker 1: you know, the the people below him under control.

505
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:27,909
Speaker 0: But he's also trying to be like.

506
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,840
Speaker 0: he's trying to be like good manager, right?

507
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,643
Speaker 1: He's trying.

508
00:30:30,683 --> 00:30:34,600
Speaker 1: he's like, you know, his boss is a crazy bad evil dude who everyone's scared of right?

509
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,360
Speaker 1: But he isn't like trying to learn the names of all his subordinates so that he can gain their loyalties.

510
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,460
Speaker 1: That was actually really funny and they all have names that like are too similar to each other and he's going crazy.

511
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,580
Speaker 1: But he's also trying hard to actually remember them and gain their trust.

512
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:52,334
Speaker 1: But you know, it's like they hate him.

513
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:53,020
Speaker 1: They like him.

514
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:59,320
Speaker 1: He's trying to make you know, he takes them to a barbecue to try to make them like him So that they'll come up with good ideas.

515
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:04,338
Speaker 1: He accepts all their ideas, but then when the boss comes in he has to you know, berate them all.

516
00:31:04,759 --> 00:31:07,728
Speaker 0: now It's pretty funny and I watched a bunch of it.

517
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:08,711
Speaker 0: We're not gonna finish.

518
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:10,376
Speaker 1: only watched like three episodes.

519
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:15,645
Speaker 0: I watched like seven but basically It's pretty funny.

520
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:21,093
Speaker 0: Like it's worth watching a few episodes, especially like the first couple when he's trying to learn Everyone's names is actually really funny.

521
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:21,959
Speaker 1: That's the funniest part.

522
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:31,840
Speaker 0: But as the as it goes on, I guess the problem is you don't actually have need to seen Akagi Akagi kaiji at all, right?

523
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,621
Speaker 1: It gives you these flashbacks and summaries of what happened in Kaiji in like excruciating Like.

524
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:43,560
Speaker 1: literally the beginning of the first episode is like this very long summary of what happened in Kaiji.

525
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:44,704
Speaker 1: At least I assume.

526
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:49,180
Speaker 1: I don't know if the other things happened in Kaiji that they're not summarizing cuz I didn't watch Kaiji.

527
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I feel like I don't need to watch Kaiji now because I got a cliff notes of it.

528
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it does.

529
00:31:53,423 --> 00:32:02,380
Speaker 0: it spoils stuff like it tells you what happens to him in the end, but on the other hand I don't even though it's summarized the events of Kaiji.

530
00:32:02,782 --> 00:32:05,479
Speaker 1: I don't care about Kaiji or the events of Kaiji.

531
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:16,740
Speaker 1: So so many of the jokes are referencing or basically tied to the story of Kaiji That it's like oh, here's how they came up with that particular game of death that happened in Kaiji.

532
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,180
Speaker 1: It's like I don't care about Kaiji because I maybe if I had seen Kaiji it would be funny.

533
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:21,802
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

534
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:22,605
Speaker 0: the scene when they're.

535
00:32:22,886 --> 00:32:25,014
Speaker 0: that's the other really good scene in the early episodes where they're.

536
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:32,340
Speaker 0: they're workshopping like High-level ideas for games of death and one of the guys is like what do you say something like what if we make him?

537
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,179
Speaker 0: Play poker, but they're betting their own blood and that was actually a really good idea.

538
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:45,860
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is if think if you've seen Kaiji and like Kaiji a lot of the jokes in this show will hit harder.

539
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:54,947
Speaker 1: I you don't have to have seen Kaiji to watch this show But I think you will because you care less it will be less funny And yeah, there'll be less tying you to it.

540
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:57,134
Speaker 0: now in one way the concept is really solid.

541
00:32:57,194 --> 00:33:05,000
Speaker 0: take a not really a deconstruction But take any of those anime that have an evil organization with lots and lots of faceless goons.

542
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:16,978
Speaker 0: that's like always ever present and hyper organized and and Look at it from the back and explore How would you organize like these thousands of goons to be the bad guys in the anime?

543
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,520
Speaker 1: right.

544
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,787
Speaker 1: It's like usually when you watch a typical, you know Show right.

545
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:24,560
Speaker 1: that's an action show where there's good guys and bad guys.

546
00:33:24,881 --> 00:33:40,464
Speaker 1: You see the mostly focusing on the good guys and a few scenes of the bad guys that you know What they're up to but like the thousands of just faceless dudes and sunglasses who get shot in noir Thundercats, but they show.

547
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:46,324
Speaker 1: but it was mostly what are the mutants up to and the Thundercats are just dicking around and yeah No, there's not a fight going on.

548
00:33:46,706 --> 00:33:47,830
Speaker 0: That's one thing he man did.

549
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,500
Speaker 0: Well, he meant spent equal time on Skeletor.

550
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:57,513
Speaker 1: Oh, right But imagine if the show was just like, you know Skeletar and on all what all the days when they're not fighting with he-man.

551
00:33:57,653 --> 00:34:03,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's like preparing to fight, you know Like Starscream.

552
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:06,192
Speaker 1: just you know, chillin with some energy on cubes or whatever.

553
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,440
Speaker 0: and I really like that concept and the show pulls it off.

554
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:11,867
Speaker 0: Okay But there's a fundamental problem that makes like.

555
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:29,014
Speaker 0: there's a poor aspect of the execution in that it'll make really good jokes but then it'll go way out of its way to explain the joke to make sure you've got the joke to double Reinforce what the joke is referencing and it like it.

556
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:32,966
Speaker 0: almost the jokes are funny But it spent it over.

557
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:37,518
Speaker 0: it really brings them out too much and just drags everything out too far.

558
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:45,080
Speaker 1: Right that funny joke about the the getting trying to memorize the names of all the employees It's like that goes on for like minutes.

559
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,065
Speaker 1: It's like it was funny.

560
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:48,612
Speaker 1: and now why you still?

561
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:57,279
Speaker 1: it's like someone just keeps telling the joke like hey Why the chicken cross the road to get the other side to get the other side get it And I guess the chicken cross the road to get the other side you get it.

562
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,954
Speaker 1: And on one hand why didn't cross it for like two minutes?

563
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:00,960
Speaker 1: Someone just keeps going on.

564
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,877
Speaker 1: It's like it was funny the first time but why are you still telling the joke again?

565
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:14,359
Speaker 0: No on one hand It's clearly parodying the style of Kaiji Like it'll cut to someone who's thinking like well if I do this then he'll do that.

566
00:35:14,641 --> 00:35:17,329
Speaker 1: So therefore lots of internal monologue, which is good.

567
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:17,791
Speaker 0: Yep.

568
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:20,660
Speaker 1: I like that a bit of you know, it's just the timing of it.

569
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:26,452
Speaker 1: Things are stretched out too long Right and there is zero comedic time.

570
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:28,400
Speaker 1: the timing of the comedy is just wrong.

571
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,553
Speaker 1: It's like a joke is perfectly good and it's just.

572
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:32,939
Speaker 1: there's no timing whatsoever.

573
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:40,140
Speaker 0: Yep It's like the literal opposite of Nijijou where the jokes are very simple or absurdist or often completely nonsensical.

574
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:52,134
Speaker 0: but the comedic timing of Nijijou is so perfect and This completely fails to execute at any point on the timing and cadence of a joke.

575
00:35:52,515 --> 00:36:02,971
Speaker 0: only the content of the joke is conveyed And that's the fundamental flaw of this and I feel like it's a common problem in Almost all of these parody anime that I've seen.

576
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:05,820
Speaker 1: I feel like what this like the fist of the North Star parody.

577
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:14,920
Speaker 1: It showed him way better if it was a short show like Devilman Parody, like a Damago Dobutsu Yeah, and they were forced to squish it because they're trying to fill this full episode length.

578
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,296
Speaker 1: I think that's the reason that I think it feels like they didn't have enough material to work with.

579
00:36:19,316 --> 00:36:24,119
Speaker 1: they had to stretch it out Yeah, or they could have just crammed two episodes into one and told more stuff.

580
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could have worked also but they could have or you know.

581
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:33,520
Speaker 0: what they could have done too is if they'd aimed it at The audience of people who have already seen Kaiji and our fans.

582
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,944
Speaker 1: I think they did but they.

583
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:39,940
Speaker 1: it's like they aimed it at them, but they tried to make it so that anyone could watch it.

584
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,703
Speaker 1: It's like they should have given up on the people who haven't seen Kaiji Cuz at least like.

585
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:54,040
Speaker 0: remember that like mini that Devilman Parody thing that we watched a long time ago Like all those other weird parody anime They tend to do the opposite and they don't explain shit.

586
00:36:54,314 --> 00:37:01,148
Speaker 1: Yeah There was I think it's a fist of the North Star like working in a grocery store one where they're all chibi or something and they Didn't explain nothing which was fine.

587
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,589
Speaker 1: But even then as someone who's seen all fists of the North Star I couldn't even watch it.

588
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:05,337
Speaker 1: Also, it wasn't funny.

589
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:09,957
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, that's the thing that that show the content wasn't funny and the execution wasn't good.

590
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:13,420
Speaker 0: this show The content is great and the jokes are great.

591
00:37:13,801 --> 00:37:14,563
Speaker 0: It's just the comedic.

592
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:19,880
Speaker 0: timing falls so flat that it really kills the momentum and it's hard to keep watching.

593
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,725
Speaker 1: You know, it is funny.

594
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:21,288
Speaker 1: What's that?

595
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:22,354
Speaker 1: The chibi lotus wars?

596
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:25,525
Speaker 0: Oh The lotus island.

597
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:29,214
Speaker 1: lotus island also mini Potto, but there's not a lot of mini about.

598
00:37:29,295 --> 00:37:32,022
Speaker 0: yeah mini Potto really relies on having seen Pat Laboire.

599
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:32,806
Speaker 1: that yeah, it does like.

600
00:37:32,826 --> 00:37:34,193
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen Pat Laboire, you're just like.

601
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:37,900
Speaker 1: what if you haven't seen Pat Laboire Why why would you even think about watching middleman?

602
00:37:38,741 --> 00:37:44,820
Speaker 1: When you can go watch Pat Laboire which is itself has a lot of comedy in it Even though it is not a comedy, but I guess what I would say.

603
00:37:46,061 --> 00:37:56,140
Speaker 0: I'd recommend watching one episode of this partly because then you'll see what the deal is and You'll see like kind of what the deal is with Kaiji and it'll tell you if you like either or both.

604
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:58,540
Speaker 1: I would recommend watching Kaiji.

605
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:00,605
Speaker 1: See if you see.

606
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,449
Speaker 1: if it's a thing you like.

607
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,560
Speaker 1: watch one or two episodes of it is good.

608
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,272
Speaker 1: If not, then don't watch anything ever.

609
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,259
Speaker 1: don't watch any of it ever again.

610
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:09,259
Speaker 1: But if you do like Kaiji, well, you can finish watching Kaiji.

611
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:14,300
Speaker 1: And then if you need some humor that will probably you know be not be as lost on you.

612
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:19,253
Speaker 1: You can then watch the middle manager and maybe even watch Akagi or who knows what.

613
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,580
Speaker 1: anything else created by what's the person's name?
