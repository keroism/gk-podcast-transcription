1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,590
Speaker 0: It's Monday September 10th, 2012.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,131
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:15,080
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:19,034
Speaker 0: My cell phones too big and I guess the tech news roundup.

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,419
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,931
Speaker 1: You know the part where we say Yeah, I'm rim.

7
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:24,860
Speaker 1: I'm Scott this geek night.

8
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:27,989
Speaker 1: Yeah You know we could just only record.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,678
Speaker 0: you mean like way back when we recorded that one.

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,286
Speaker 0: really good Let's do this that we've been using to this day, right?

11
00:00:33,307 --> 00:00:37,319
Speaker 1: We should only record the tonight blah blah blah part.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:47,444
Speaker 0: Yeah That's a little more of a pain in the ass and people might notice though I think most of our listeners to this day do not realize that that clip of us saying let's do this is Literally from 2005.

13
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:48,447
Speaker 0: Nope 2006.

14
00:00:48,447 --> 00:00:50,092
Speaker 1: There's no way.

15
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:52,480
Speaker 1: they could not realize that it's exactly the same.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,152
Speaker 0: They might have figured it out the few times when I did a show by myself and yet magically you were still here to say that There's no way that we could say something.

17
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:01,876
Speaker 1: so precisely.

18
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:14,559
Speaker 1: you'd have to be a moron To listen to more than one or two shows, ah, but you more than two or three memory My memory as bad as it may be at times Would not fuck something like that up.

19
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:22,715
Speaker 0: All right name any character from the man who was Thursday other than Thursday Monday Tuesday Wednesday Sunday and Friday.

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,406
Speaker 0: Gregory, okay, you got it.

21
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,014
Speaker 0: I kind of like Gregory.

22
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:28,240
Speaker 1: I finished it by the way.

23
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,450
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm like two chapters to go.

24
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,434
Speaker 0: I thought you finished it.

25
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,600
Speaker 0: No, I've got close to the end.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,173
Speaker 1: I'm glad I did not just yeah say something.

27
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:42,015
Speaker 1: I was about to say I Like Gregory you had given me the impression that you had finished it long ago.

28
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:42,598
Speaker 0: No, I'm.

29
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:46,300
Speaker 0: basically If I sit down for 45 minutes, I'm done with it.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I blasted through it when I was at Django kind of such that I could read other things.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,880
Speaker 0: It reminds me this is our book club book, by the way, we probably have a lot of new listeners.

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:54,581
Speaker 0: It's.

33
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,860
Speaker 0: it reminds me of the kind of book that in middle school would have been assigned to me to read and then write.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,271
Speaker 0: I like a one-page paper.

35
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,420
Speaker 1: You're reading the free edition.

36
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,533
Speaker 0: No, I bought the really nice like Kindle one.

37
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:05,580
Speaker 1: Oh you bought the Kindle one.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,172
Speaker 1: Okay, did it have footnotes on all sorts of things that were?

39
00:02:08,192 --> 00:02:16,702
Speaker 1: no no See mine whenever they were weird sort of References.

40
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:25,640
Speaker 1: yeah references to things that are no longer relevant to modern times But you would have gotten them if you were alive in the 1900 like what different hats and things?

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,840
Speaker 1: Well, no, like he would make you know, he'd be like, oh, you know, he made a For example, there's one part where he says oh there's something of Aesop, right?

42
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,900
Speaker 1: And then there's a whole thing in the back about how like actually the pig of Aesop was.

43
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:42,493
Speaker 1: You know, it was probably referring to this other fable by this other guy.

44
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,140
Speaker 1: Aesop never wrote any fables like that.

45
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:46,199
Speaker 1: But there's a fable by this other guy.

46
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:48,449
Speaker 1: That's exactly like what he's referring to.

47
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:53,760
Speaker 0: but he missed the point cuz the point was that he was referring to Gibberish on purpose in that scene sort of right?

48
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:59,440
Speaker 1: No, but if you read the footnote then you know what that fable with the pig that by the other guy is about.

49
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,537
Speaker 1: That is super relevant.

50
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:01,820
Speaker 1: It's like.

51
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,246
Speaker 0: That's the kind of a Hamlet.

52
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:05,828
Speaker 0: he's crazy.

53
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:08,257
Speaker 1: but situation exactly where it's like, you know, it's.

54
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:12,628
Speaker 1: it's for example You know if it was Shakespeare It would be like bite my thumb at the.

55
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,619
Speaker 1: you know with the number two next to it you go in the back and they'd be Like number two and be like, yeah a long time ago people would bite their thumbs off and throw them.

56
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,077
Speaker 1: He'll be like, you know that used to be an insult that basically meant fuck you.

57
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:26,733
Speaker 0: good, sir I feel like everyone today knows that that isn't in.

58
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:32,479
Speaker 1: so of course, but I'm saying as an exam There are things in you know, man who was Thursday where you would not know.

59
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:37,918
Speaker 1: Even a smart well-read educated person would not know unless there were a hundred years old.

60
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:38,460
Speaker 0: regardless.

61
00:03:38,643 --> 00:03:39,720
Speaker 0: We are back from PAX.

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:49,460
Speaker 0: But so we said there'd be a bunch of downtime and there's gonna be beyond this because next week I'm flying overseas for one or two weeks and all sorts of other crazy.

63
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,490
Speaker 1: So there's no shows next.

64
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:56,235
Speaker 1: for basically now It's only give me one week of shows in September which is this out the call for guest episodes.

65
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,800
Speaker 1: Did anyone answer the call?

66
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,673
Speaker 0: I have one guest episode done one guest episode And we have someone else who looks pretty cool who promised another guest episode.

67
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:18,651
Speaker 0: So I'll probably have those up to a guest episode And if I'm in India for the week after that I might just record some things and send them out or I don't know I'll figure something out.

68
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:21,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll save that for the meta for the baby.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,894
Speaker 1: September's gonna be light on shows but October the month of geek nights show.

70
00:04:25,914 --> 00:04:28,331
Speaker 0: that's when I'm going to Turkey in Germany All right.

71
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:32,789
Speaker 1: Yeah Also burning Khan, is that October?

72
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:33,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

73
00:04:34,294 --> 00:04:35,418
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought it was December.

74
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:35,940
Speaker 1: I gotta prepare.

75
00:04:36,121 --> 00:04:36,746
Speaker 0: I don't know when it.

76
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:38,800
Speaker 1: actually I only half prepared.

77
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:41,840
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it in the minute I'm gonna finish preparing my game for recess.

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,980
Speaker 0: But uh, so many of you are probably here brand new after packs.

79
00:04:46,343 --> 00:04:48,280
Speaker 0: You probably saw us do our awesome lectures.

80
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:53,580
Speaker 1: There's no way that you're listening to this show right now because there's no way you remembered us.

81
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,565
Speaker 1: A whole week after packs.

82
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:59,346
Speaker 1: we had Remember we existed.

83
00:04:59,788 --> 00:05:08,470
Speaker 1: you probably started by listening to the last show We put up and I don't even know what that only if you like that episode Which I don't think was probably the best episode in the world.

84
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,760
Speaker 1: Would you be listening to this one?

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,062
Speaker 0: It's been a while, but I'm full.

86
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:15,449
Speaker 0: I am back in court and full of fresh ideas.

87
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:16,230
Speaker 1: Sure.

88
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:23,165
Speaker 0: I But yeah, we're back.

89
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:26,559
Speaker 0: we're bad we're gonna be not back soon and then we'll be back again.

90
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:33,107
Speaker 0: But we wanted to talk about something very important because it's been pissing Scott off for a long time Not for a lot just for months or so.

91
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:35,256
Speaker 0: really it's been pissing me off for longer.

92
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:36,100
Speaker 0: In fact, I've complained.

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,719
Speaker 1: It's only been a problem for months.

94
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:43,719
Speaker 0: It's been a problem for me since I got my current phone the Samsung Nexus s.

95
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:45,129
Speaker 1: When did you get that phone?

96
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,559
Speaker 0: like a year and a half ago?

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,560
Speaker 0: Okay, and I the problem isn't that this phone is too big.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
Speaker 0: The problem is that I can't get a phone this small when this phone eventually dies.

99
00:05:54,882 --> 00:06:04,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really annoying that you know, you go to the phone store and all the smartphones now are Gigantic and it's like wasn't sort of the point of a mobile phone?

100
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,888
Speaker 1: that it's mobile and small and just adding features to it Without making it bigger is like whoa, that's crazy.

101
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:11,229
Speaker 1: Awesome.

102
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,256
Speaker 1: You added all this stuff in that tiny phone.

103
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:17,050
Speaker 1: Holy shit I've never fucking small.

104
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,377
Speaker 1: that palm pre was right?

105
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:18,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

106
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,501
Speaker 0: I have my.

107
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:23,700
Speaker 0: I pulled my palm pre out the other day right and I have it on my desk at work.

108
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:28,100
Speaker 0: I charged it up and I reset it and I'm gonna like see if I can figure out something cool to do with it.

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,792
Speaker 0: Cuz it's internet, you know, it's a computer.

110
00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,920
Speaker 0: I Forgot how much I love that form factor.

111
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:41,213
Speaker 0: The only problem with the pre other than the lack of support by anyone was the fact that the screen While the right size was too low.

112
00:06:41,273 --> 00:06:48,320
Speaker 0: res if I had a palm pre Identical except that it had the screen resolution of this Nexus s. I would pay like a thousand dollars for that.

113
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:53,857
Speaker 1: But anyway nowadays it seems like what everyone's doing at least phone manufacturers is going.

114
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:57,769
Speaker 1: Uh Shit guys, we can't really fit all this stuff.

115
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:04,440
Speaker 1: We want like a giant ass battery inside the small phone and It's kind of hard to get high resolution.

116
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,099
Speaker 0: The battery is a red herring because they make the big-ass phone with a big-ass screen that eats the battery just as fast.

117
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:18,338
Speaker 1: now Right, but it's also that you know, it's like hey we make this screen bigger it'll look more impressive and we can get the higher resolution.

118
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:26,406
Speaker 1: and you know, it's sort of like Best Buy faking the Got a cough little coughing.

119
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:30,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, not really coughing that much when I'm not talking which I wasn't doing a lot of.

120
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:35,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't see you with Luke Burrage all week More coughing.

121
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:46,091
Speaker 0: I'm not editing any of that shit out wheezing Oh Anyway Okay.

122
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:55,700
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's sort of like in Best Buy where they fake the TVs, you know And people buy some 50-inch TV for their three inch living room.

123
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I would do a website when I bought my TV.

124
00:07:58,492 --> 00:08:00,140
Speaker 0: My TV is pretty ridiculously big.

125
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:09,238
Speaker 0: It is the maximum size that actually works for the room any bigger and you could not read subtitles or See the entire screen at once.

126
00:08:10,802 --> 00:08:14,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure according to the calculator that the TV is too big for you.

127
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:14,740
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,404
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

129
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:16,731
Speaker 0: There are two separate there.

130
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:18,380
Speaker 0: There are three calculations.

131
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,100
Speaker 0: One of them is for vision impaired people.

132
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:42,039
Speaker 0: One of them was for like television watching and one of them was for quote Cinematic watching and they kind of the websites I used all broke them down among those three or at least two of those and The what they said was basically if you primarily watch movies You want you want to go one class bigger because it'll be about the same size as a movie screen if you're in a real theater.

133
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:53,980
Speaker 0: But they warned that if you're watching non HD stuff or if you're watching like TV shows They'd actually kind of sucks on that size TV because then it's a little too big.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,065
Speaker 0: It'd be like watching I don't know home improvement or the Simpsons in a theater Mm-hmm.

135
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:05,090
Speaker 0: But yeah, anyway, but beside the point I Think throughout all of human history.

136
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,920
Speaker 0: There's been this idea that bigger is better.

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,292
Speaker 0: I mean from penises to TVs to cars.

138
00:09:10,332 --> 00:09:14,926
Speaker 1: I think it's actually a unique Only for certain cultures.

139
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:15,829
Speaker 0: bigger is okay.

140
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:17,875
Speaker 0: So fine in the history of Americans.

141
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:19,380
Speaker 1: Well, I think there are other country.

142
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:29,347
Speaker 1: I don't want to say America I mean it is America, but I think there are also other places in the world and other cultures besides just America Where bigger is also better probably.

143
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,877
Speaker 1: but there are also places where smaller is better like Japan.

144
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:33,820
Speaker 1: They like small things.

145
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,769
Speaker 1: They're compact and they fit in their small places.

146
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:39,924
Speaker 0: I like small things - I also like small things But I just.

147
00:09:40,425 --> 00:09:41,469
Speaker 0: this is why it bothers me.

148
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,980
Speaker 0: My phone right now is literally the ideal form factor.

149
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:46,546
Speaker 0: I can hold it in one hand.

150
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,998
Speaker 0: I can touch every part of the screen with my thumb.

151
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:51,625
Speaker 0: That's right In fact my thumb.

152
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:52,891
Speaker 0: I have a really big hand.

153
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:56,100
Speaker 0: I could do the same thing with slightly bigger phones But I'm kind of an odd case.

154
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
Speaker 0: I have abnormally long fingers as I learned recently by measuring them and looking at a website.

155
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,248
Speaker 1: You're not as long as rock Manon off.

156
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,072
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

157
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:04,839
Speaker 0: I wish I had fingers as long as rock Manon off.

158
00:10:06,641 --> 00:10:07,606
Speaker 0: Yeah, not doing so well there.

159
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:08,451
Speaker 0: I think you're dying.

160
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,059
Speaker 1: It's only because I keep talking.

161
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:11,245
Speaker 1: I wasn't did I?

162
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:13,014
Speaker 1: I didn't cough it off before we started doing the show.

163
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:14,180
Speaker 0: No, you didn't that is true.

164
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,088
Speaker 1: Anyway, you didn't lie.

165
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:16,851
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

166
00:10:16,971 --> 00:10:17,734
Speaker 1: Why would I lie?

167
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,140
Speaker 0: because I would I ever lie?

168
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:21,692
Speaker 0: You lie often captain mclay pants.

169
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:23,320
Speaker 0: that in fact was a lie liar.

170
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:28,029
Speaker 1: Anyway You know, what's really bad about this?

171
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:28,471
Speaker 1: coughing?

172
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:32,187
Speaker 1: Yeah losing whatever I was thinking about I'm just like what was I saying?

173
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,995
Speaker 0: So the phone also is really thin.

174
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:34,920
Speaker 0: it fits in my pocket.

175
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,549
Speaker 0: It's tiny it battery lasts a long goddamn time unless I play like Oregon Trail all day, Oregon Trey Oh my god, Oregon Trail.

176
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:44,159
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that in the next Tuesday show.

177
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,324
Speaker 1: So I try to look.

178
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,980
Speaker 1: you try to find a synonym to the cell phone situation and the first thing that comes to mind.

179
00:10:49,242 --> 00:10:51,240
Speaker 1: Well CVS and SUVs, right.

180
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:57,500
Speaker 1: But the thing with TVs and SUVs is they still sell fucking small cars and small TVs if you want them.

181
00:10:57,942 --> 00:11:02,040
Speaker 1: But with smartphones, it seems like no one is selling a small smartphone anymore.

182
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:10,545
Speaker 1: You go to the store and there just isn't one and it's like, okay There might be one thing that is technically a smartphone that is smaller But it's crap.

183
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:15,140
Speaker 1: like the smartphones that aren't the best smartphone may as well not exist.

184
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:16,589
Speaker 0: I know I mean the thing is.

185
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,500
Speaker 0: the only exception to that is that to this day?

186
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,660
Speaker 0: I still assert that the Samsung Nexus S is the best non iPhone phone hardware in the world.

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Speaker 1: but it's like you go to the cell phone store for any of the carriers or whatever and you see a whole bunch of Phones and a lot of them are smartphones.

188
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:37,380
Speaker 1: But really only two or three of them actually count and the rest of them might as well be like, you know brick crap phone.

189
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:37,494
Speaker 1: Yeah.

190
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,746
Speaker 0: And now when I go to the store every one of those phones is like an inch bigger than my current phone with this Gigantic screen.

191
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,691
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck?

192
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 1: I want a phone not a fucking tablet.

193
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,773
Speaker 0: No, the worst thing is we're by we.

194
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,200
Speaker 0: I basically mean the sort of power Technorati kind of users.

195
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,520
Speaker 0: We're the kind of excluded minority now because normal people I talk to who just like have a smartphone or don't really think about it.

196
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:07,820
Speaker 0: Not only do they want bigger phones they complained that like the HTC hero was too small.

197
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:13,675
Speaker 0: These are the people who buy a tablet But yet at the same time want a bigger smartphone.

198
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:17,908
Speaker 0: I don't get it Cannot understand where this is coming from.

199
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:22,380
Speaker 1: it just maybe they you know, we know we tend to be the kind of people.

200
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,946
Speaker 0: I have to stop using that phrase.

201
00:12:24,046 --> 00:12:24,669
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

202
00:12:24,749 --> 00:12:27,479
Speaker 0: I don't understand why Republicans want stupid things like.

203
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,660
Speaker 0: no I do understand why I just think it's stupid, right?

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:49,085
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is we're the kind of people who you know, somebody who is against us could say Well, you guys are just so, you know anti Conformist that you're intentionally, you know indoctrinating yourselves against Indoctrinated -

205
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:49,607
Speaker 0: so

206
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,982
Speaker 1: if everybody else in the country is going bigger is better We're gonna go.

207
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:53,988
Speaker 1: no no smaller is better.

208
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,613
Speaker 1: Just because I've always said smaller is better I've always wanted right because you always wanted to go against the grain.

209
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,560
Speaker 1: You've never not wanted to go against the grain.

210
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:06,898
Speaker 0: No, it's because a small phone means I have less shit to carry in my pockets.

211
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:07,420
Speaker 1: That's right.

212
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,243
Speaker 0: That's all I want.

213
00:13:08,484 --> 00:13:12,540
Speaker 0: The reason I want my phone to be small is because all my phone is my entire life.

214
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,430
Speaker 0: It is just a link to the rest of the world.

215
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:16,855
Speaker 0: That is always on me.

216
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:17,678
Speaker 0: No matter what.

217
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:24,500
Speaker 1: Yep I think a lot of the people who want the big phones I've heard what a lot of what they've been saying is like people keep talking about like watching video.

218
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:25,969
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to say.

219
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,916
Speaker 0: everyone I've talked to.

220
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:27,580
Speaker 0: it's the same thing.

221
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,439
Speaker 0: They say that the primary thing they use their phone for is watching movies.

222
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:33,906
Speaker 1: I did hold on.

223
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,232
Speaker 1: I did when I was riding the train.

224
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:40,087
Speaker 1: watch full anime series is on my iPhone 3g.

225
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:43,687
Speaker 1: I Did that many times and you know what?

226
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,565
Speaker 1: Okay bigger would have bigger have been better Maybe but you know what?

227
00:13:48,946 --> 00:14:01,706
Speaker 1: that iPhone 3g with his non retina screen and watching like all of Evangelion all of Escaflowne on the Metro North train When you know when you start watching something it fills your whole field of vision Even though it doesn't fill your field of vision.

228
00:14:01,846 --> 00:14:06,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, it occupies your your you know, your optical processing units of your brain.

229
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,326
Speaker 1: So you don't see anything else.

230
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,675
Speaker 1: It was just fine.

231
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:11,176
Speaker 1: Now.

232
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:12,100
Speaker 1: I have good vision.

233
00:14:12,787 --> 00:14:15,022
Speaker 1: Maybe people now Independent.

234
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:19,600
Speaker 0: if someone makes the well you I could read the subtitles with no issue whatsoever even if vision is an issue.

235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,560
Speaker 0: You know what I did because I didn't want to watch videos in my phone.

236
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:35,397
Speaker 0: I had a tiny phone that I didn't watch videos on and I had my laptop on the train and I watch stuff on that because I watch them in the laptop - but I also currently I watch youtubes on my iPhone 4 occasionally and it's just fine.

237
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:48,300
Speaker 1: I Having it bigger might be better but it's not something I. it wouldn't outweigh the Pain of having a gigantic phone that I can't have to use two hands to hold and is big and clumsy.

238
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,029
Speaker 0: I mean my phone.

239
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:52,052
Speaker 0: I got a shoulder mount So when I run I can have it like on me because I never.

240
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:58,480
Speaker 0: I mean I carry my phone in the shower Like when I go into the bathroom, I just put it like in the cupboard and just sits there waiting for me to come back.

241
00:14:59,202 --> 00:15:00,647
Speaker 1: I thought you mean you're brought into the shower.

242
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:04,340
Speaker 0: Well, I occasionally I've read slashed out while I was soaking my lower half.

243
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:12,588
Speaker 1: Anyway, I you know, the rumor is and we'll find out I guess in a few days the iPhone 5 I don't 5 is bigger than the iPhone 4.

244
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:13,090
Speaker 0: I'm not getting it.

245
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,139
Speaker 1: Well, it's the rumor is it is bigger.

246
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:16,589
Speaker 0: I think the rumors BS.

247
00:15:17,273 --> 00:15:19,223
Speaker 0: I'll say that hold on I lost rumor you didn't.

248
00:15:19,324 --> 00:15:26,893
Speaker 1: the specific part of the rumor is not that it's big like, you know The freaking Android Samsung Galaxy gigantos eyes.

249
00:15:27,354 --> 00:15:28,760
Speaker 1: if you wanted that big just buy a tab.

250
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,980
Speaker 1: The rumor is is that it is the same width so that you can still get your thumb all the way across.

251
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:46,407
Speaker 1: But and it is only slightly taller so that 16 by 9 videos will play with no You know bars on the side.

252
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:49,877
Speaker 1: that is fine that you know, that is acceptable.

253
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:50,860
Speaker 1: I would rather not.

254
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,711
Speaker 1: But if that is my choice Obviously, I'm just gonna buy that.

255
00:15:55,792 --> 00:16:01,800
Speaker 0: but all of you listeners out there I want to know why do you want a gigantic phone if you could buy a tablet?

256
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,744
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of the people say oh, it's not too big and it's it's like they're like, oh it fits in my pocket Just fine.

257
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:09,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone my hand is really big.

258
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,957
Speaker 1: I can reach all the way across it.

259
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:11,720
Speaker 1: What's the problem?

260
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,420
Speaker 1: And it's it's like, you know the same people have an SUV and they say all these things.

261
00:16:16,783 --> 00:16:18,253
Speaker 0: I think it's just a matter of their use.

262
00:16:18,294 --> 00:16:19,140
Speaker 0: cases are very different.

263
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,506
Speaker 0: These are the people who I think travel and then they you like they don't have a good laptop Or they don't carry it with them.

264
00:16:24,747 --> 00:16:27,501
Speaker 0: probably cuz I have a gigantic laptop - yeah They could.

265
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:28,325
Speaker 1: they have gigantic.

266
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,012
Speaker 0: everything probably is gigantic.

267
00:16:30,052 --> 00:16:33,785
Speaker 0: laptops are way cheaper at least Like a small laptop.

268
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:36,376
Speaker 0: that's powerful is way more expensive than a big laptop.

269
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,003
Speaker 0: That's equally powerful That's true.

270
00:16:38,184 --> 00:16:39,870
Speaker 0: But when it comes to the phones, like I've watched.

271
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:40,412
Speaker 0: I won't.

272
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:40,814
Speaker 0: the reason.

273
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:47,560
Speaker 0: smaller things are more expensive They're better, but people I know who I see with these gigantic stupid phones.

274
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:57,711
Speaker 0: They carry them around everywhere and when they like visit someone they use it as their computer And it occupies a good deal of their mental sort of concentration.

275
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:03,124
Speaker 1: I mean, I do use my phone like a computer quite often But it doesn't.

276
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,151
Speaker 1: it's just fine that it's the size it is.

277
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:05,733
Speaker 1: Yeah.

278
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,880
Speaker 1: Well, I don't need it to be my point.

279
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:23,295
Speaker 0: my point is that these are the people who Maybe show up at a social event or like go somewhere for a weekend and spend a good deal of their time Not just like while I'm waiting for you to take your turn in mini golf But like while we're sitting around on the beach just constantly using their phone.

280
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:24,740
Speaker 1: even bring my fucking phone to the beach.

281
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,207
Speaker 1: What do we get?

282
00:17:25,268 --> 00:17:25,959
Speaker 1: sand and shit?

283
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,653
Speaker 0: I do in a plastic bag because I want to have my phone.

284
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:30,583
Speaker 1: if someone takes it out of my time I'm gonna take it.

285
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:31,628
Speaker 1: I don't take my phone.

286
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,156
Speaker 0: No one steals shit in Wildwood.

287
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,640
Speaker 1: I wouldn't know I don't bring my phone to any beach.

288
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:50,920
Speaker 0: When I went to Rockaway Beach I carried my fucking bike onto the beach And then I locked it up like the chain like through the wheels on The beach on my towel and then as I swam I look back at it every two seconds I don't bring.

289
00:17:52,385 --> 00:17:59,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah Yeah, but the thing that bothers me is you read articles talking cuz you know our it's phone season.

290
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,998
Speaker 1: Right, all the new phones are busted out holidays shopping and iPhone included and all the articles that talk about this.

291
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,080
Speaker 1: when they bring up Size they sort of take for granted that bigger is better.

292
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:10,301
Speaker 1: Like.

293
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:26,675
Speaker 1: I read like three articles and all of them were like, you know, they did the pro and con thing and they're like pro You know You know, it's faster con too small iPhone 5. if the rumors true It's gonna be too small and it's like they'll go like Samsung Galaxy X, you know 100, you know pro.

294
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:33,028
Speaker 1: It's so awesomely big guys And it's like you're just taking them granted that bigger is better.

295
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:36,340
Speaker 0: on the other side of this notice how there's there's this move toward.

296
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:41,420
Speaker 0: There's a lot of rumors of different people having Tablets that are one size smaller than the current sizes.

297
00:18:41,841 --> 00:18:44,994
Speaker 0: So there'll be a tablet that is halfway between the current tablet.

298
00:18:45,014 --> 00:18:49,391
Speaker 1: Yeah Kindle size tablet Kindle size tablet instead of iPad size tablet.

299
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:49,974
Speaker 1: This is.

300
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:51,660
Speaker 0: this is where I'm really confused.

301
00:18:52,162 --> 00:18:57,020
Speaker 0: I do not think there is a place in the market for every one of these sizes.

302
00:18:57,342 --> 00:19:04,340
Speaker 1: No, what it is is that they they're really, you know If you buy all these devices, you're gonna find that you really don't use them all.

303
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:16,599
Speaker 0: In a lot with a trend I've seen more and more people also will have a tablet With 3 or 4g and they use it effectively as a cell phone.

304
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,764
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

305
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:22,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I've seen people doing that's like anyone holding up an iPad to take a picture.

306
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,000
Speaker 1: Just I actually didn't see anyone at PAX doing that.

307
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, not.

308
00:19:25,382 --> 00:19:28,215
Speaker 1: if I did, you know, I'm kind of glad I didn't granted.

309
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:34,948
Speaker 0: at PAX one year I saw a guy holding up his MacBook Pro and taking video To drop it.

310
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:37,422
Speaker 1: but anyway, yeah It's that.

311
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:43,940
Speaker 1: I think what it is is a large component of this is not people need a device of every possible different size.

312
00:19:44,502 --> 00:19:49,577
Speaker 1: It's that company's just looking for something to sell and they're telling people what to want and that works.

313
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:50,520
Speaker 1: Of course, it works.

314
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,000
Speaker 0: Yep, it's worked for a long time.

315
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:58,570
Speaker 0: I think there's going to be a coming bust at least in the tablet market much like The sort of aces EPC style crappy.

316
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,674
Speaker 1: I think it'll take.

317
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,540
Speaker 1: you know, it'd be sort of like, you know Netbooks lasted a couple years.

318
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Speaker 1: So give it two to three years and what you're gonna see I think is that people realize You know people bought netbooks and then realize that they were worthless and didn't use them.

319
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,928
Speaker 1: So you're gonna see two three years.

320
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:21,476
Speaker 1: people are gonna realize which Combination of devices and sizes they actually use and they're gonna upgrade those devices.

321
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:27,496
Speaker 1: some guy who bought every size He's gonna have the you know, the phone the tablet the computer the laptop.

322
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:33,472
Speaker 1: He's gonna realize oh I'm not really using You know this tablet so much.

323
00:20:33,512 --> 00:20:50,377
Speaker 1: I'm not really using my laptop anymore But I am using this tablet and maybe you know He'll figure out that all he needs is small phone big tablet and desktop and he won't re-buy Laptop or some other guy will realize he only needs big phone, you know and laptop.

324
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,337
Speaker 1: and you know people Will not re-buy the thing that they don't use and the things that they do use.

325
00:20:56,377 --> 00:21:01,500
Speaker 1: they'll upgrade The things you'll see they'll stop selling the things that people.

326
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,240
Speaker 0: I will say is that I don't think that'll happen in any conscious way.

327
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:05,883
Speaker 0: No one's going.

328
00:21:05,943 --> 00:21:09,119
Speaker 0: no one who is guilty of that is going to realize what they've.

329
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:17,800
Speaker 1: no No, the basically, you know the guy who's got say iPhone and you know Kindle tablet and doesn't use his big iPad anymore, right?

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,758
Speaker 1: Because he has a laptop.

331
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:23,535
Speaker 1: that big iPad is sitting in a drawer or forgotten or maybe he gave it away to someone.

332
00:21:23,938 --> 00:21:29,499
Speaker 1: and then The devices that you have and use you think about and when a new one of those comes you think of upgrading it.

333
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:30,281
Speaker 0: now one Good thing.

334
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:39,649
Speaker 0: don't get me wrong the idea that we're converging on this world where it's they're all just computers to some degree and you just use whatever physical device is the most convenient.

335
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,335
Speaker 0: form factor is the future

336
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:41,958
Speaker 1: of course,

337
00:21:42,118 --> 00:21:44,424
Speaker 0: but It seems like which

338
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:46,088
Speaker 1: combination of four factors

339
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:59,914
Speaker 0: like everyone's rushing to very large form factors without a lot of thought and I think they forget the convenience of having a phone that Effectively takes up zero space and has a battery that lasts a long time.

340
00:22:00,094 --> 00:22:09,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the phone in the end is the minimal core communication device Even though I don't use it for the phone part ever.

341
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:18,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway things of the day.

342
00:22:18,468 --> 00:22:24,110
Speaker 0: I know this might seem late to the party But enough people I know had not seen this before that I feel like it's worth mentioning.

343
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,144
Speaker 0: So there's a song called somebody that I used to know that I'd never.

344
00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:32,689
Speaker 0: I actually had not heard the song Until long after I saw this parody of the song.

345
00:22:33,392 --> 00:22:46,111
Speaker 0: But this parody of it is that Star Wars that I used to know and it is both very well done from a sort of production value level but also very well done from a satire parody and poignant Angle.

346
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:46,873
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

347
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:47,615
Speaker 0: It's great.

348
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:52,167
Speaker 0: It's about why the new Star Wars is possibly bad and George Lucas is a bad person.

349
00:22:52,187 --> 00:22:52,889
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

350
00:22:54,270 --> 00:23:00,267
Speaker 1: Okay, so I think people have probably already seen this but it's so cuz.

351
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:01,391
Speaker 1: it's from 2010.

352
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:03,962
Speaker 1: This may have even been a thing of the day in the past.

353
00:23:04,022 --> 00:23:04,324
Speaker 0: I don't know.

354
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:05,630
Speaker 0: you didn't even try to find out.

355
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:07,609
Speaker 1: I yeah, I did a bad job.

356
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:11,435
Speaker 0: Let me just Look it up right now.

357
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:11,696
Speaker 0: Now.

358
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:13,304
Speaker 0: I gotta kill time while you're looking up.

359
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:14,470
Speaker 0: All right, I'm doing another thing of the day.

360
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,710
Speaker 0: Well you wait, so two things.

361
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:20,804
Speaker 0: I'll do this as a secondary thing of the day at PAX.

362
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:21,909
Speaker 0: This is a Monday show.

363
00:23:22,812 --> 00:23:28,550
Speaker 0: Many of you may know or you may not know that NASA showed up and did an hour-long lecture in the main events hall.

364
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:29,595
Speaker 0: It was

365
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:30,279
Speaker 1: really

366
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:49,670
Speaker 0: well done and at the end of it they did a TED style sort of inspirational speech about what space means in the future and games and what it's all gonna be and it was Amazing and I can say without any reservation that a good number of people in the audience were visibly and audibly choked up during it.

367
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:58,765
Speaker 1: Okay, so even though this is from 2010 and it was reposted all over the internet recently It's still something that was never a thing of the day even though it definitely feels like it was.

368
00:23:58,926 --> 00:23:59,869
Speaker 1: so here we go.

369
00:24:00,692 --> 00:24:24,769
Speaker 1: You probably saw this if you're an internet person, but what happened is there was this guy a long time ago in like 1909 so around the time the time of our book club book right and he was in Russia Hanging out with Nicholas the second and he had a camera because cameras existed then even though they were the poofy kind with them You know, and what he did is he was very smart.

370
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:39,210
Speaker 1: He took a green filter and he took a black and white picture with the green filter and then he took a black and white picture with the red filter and then he took a black and white picture with the Blue filter and then he or whatever the three color, right green red blue, right?

371
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,110
Speaker 1: And then he put the three pictures together and he made color photos.

372
00:24:44,472 --> 00:24:48,150
Speaker 1: This isn't someone taking a black and white photo and Photoshop coloring it.

373
00:24:48,511 --> 00:24:55,972
Speaker 1: This is actually fucking color photos from Russia in 1909 through 1912.

374
00:24:55,972 --> 00:25:00,926
Speaker 1: It's kind of freaky because you don't think that the world looked the way but it totally did.

375
00:25:00,946 --> 00:25:12,116
Speaker 1: You know, it did right and It sort of looks like you're looking at National Geographic photos of a foreign place That has old technologies But it's at.

376
00:25:12,156 --> 00:25:15,230
Speaker 1: well it is a foreign place with old technologies, but it's the past.

377
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,550
Speaker 1: It's not like this anymore.

378
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:23,111
Speaker 0: There's always something very startling about seeing a color picture of something that traditionally is viewed as being in black and white like World War One.

379
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:39,008
Speaker 1: right, but the quality of the photos is just unbelievably high like that resolution because the method was so, you know Awesome, I mean they had good, you know resolution then with you know photos because using horrible chemicals and whatnot They just had no color without this clever trick.

380
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:46,910
Speaker 1: So Yeah, you should look at these awesome photos from over a hundred years ago that are in full hundred percent color that were not photoshopped.

381
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:55,950
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment where we talk about all the kind of meta stuff Yep, we did three panels at PAX the one at PAX dev.

382
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:57,449
Speaker 0: We obviously cannot talk about.

383
00:25:58,092 --> 00:26:01,461
Speaker 0: The other one is gonna be on YouTube as soon as I edit it together.

384
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:02,905
Speaker 0: and the board game workshop.

385
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:07,110
Speaker 0: if you read the rules That is the workshop.

386
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:13,530
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's never talk about PAX in the meta moment again until PAX East.

387
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,115
Speaker 0: Oh PAX East is coming up.

388
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:18,284
Speaker 1: Let us instead say magfest coming up.

389
00:26:18,444 --> 00:26:24,044
Speaker 1: magfest is after New Year's So you've got a. you got a few months here of not so much.

390
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,770
Speaker 1: I think New York Comic Con is somewhere in there.

391
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,180
Speaker 0: I'm probably not even going to be honest.

392
00:26:28,401 --> 00:26:30,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might go for one day at most.

393
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:30,773
Speaker 0: I'm not.

394
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:32,830
Speaker 0: I don't even think I'm gonna go for one day.

395
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:35,240
Speaker 0: I was looking at what is going to be there and I'm just.

396
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,830
Speaker 0: I'm not interested in the New York Comic Con anymore.

397
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:50,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, really, but anyway the end of October 26 27 28 is our next convention burning con 2012 the triad.

398
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:51,001
Speaker 1: um for it.

399
00:26:51,061 --> 00:27:00,288
Speaker 1: if you are anywhere close to New York City and You enjoy the tabletop role-playing games This is the thing that you must do now.

400
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:11,070
Speaker 0: Remember, this is a curated event meaning that you can only run and play games that are from the authors of board game Or of tabletop games who are running the event now.

401
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,200
Speaker 1: Here's the way this event is gonna work a little different from previous burning cons.

402
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:14,762
Speaker 1: Here it goes.

403
00:27:14,923 --> 00:27:18,174
Speaker 1: Here's how it works a weekend registration $50.

404
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:21,310
Speaker 1: a one-day $30.

405
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,342
Speaker 1: But and the way it works is the same way as other burning cons.

406
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:26,250
Speaker 1: you show up you get to play in all the game.

407
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:27,777
Speaker 1: You know one session they have.

408
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:33,781
Speaker 1: they have a priority system where if you're a tabletop role player You should be able to figure out the priority system and how it works.

409
00:27:34,242 --> 00:27:41,667
Speaker 1: and you play some role-playing games run by other people And then you have to run one game yourself, you know as sort of that's the key to play.

410
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:42,630
Speaker 0: you gotta run.

411
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,895
Speaker 0: There is no exception to that.

412
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:44,377
Speaker 1: That's right.

413
00:27:44,417 --> 00:27:45,762
Speaker 1: Now you can.

414
00:27:45,842 --> 00:27:47,308
Speaker 1: they're adding a thing this year, right?

415
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,102
Speaker 1: It is the $10 beginner track.

416
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,690
Speaker 1: now that doesn't mean it's only $10.

417
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,690
Speaker 1: It means you add $10 to your badge price and you can go to the beginner track, which is for beginners.

418
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:06,070
Speaker 1: And the way this works is on the first day of the con You sit there and pretty much Luke Crane teaches you fucking burning wheel.

419
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,553
Speaker 1: You know, so you learn.

420
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:17,729
Speaker 1: that's like getting you know, Gary Gygax teaching you D&D on day one and then on day two You run a game because you have to run again.

421
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:25,130
Speaker 1: But he teaches you how to run the game in day one even if you've never played or maybe in fact I'm pretty sure if you've never role-played.

422
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:33,149
Speaker 0: Tabletop or large made a big point about how if you if you sign up for that and it is obvious you are not a beginner He will kick you the fuck out of it.

423
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:37,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right because you're trying to get away without running, you know a proper game for everyone else.

424
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,675
Speaker 1: You're trying to scam the system.

425
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:41,063
Speaker 1: So, you know anyone who's a beginner?

426
00:28:41,183 --> 00:28:42,327
Speaker 1: you've never role-played before.

427
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,190
Speaker 1: you wonder what's up.

428

429
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,630

Speaker 0: Just go for it.

432
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:53,962
Speaker 0: It's not that hard to run a game.

433
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,550
Speaker 0: People are super friendly at things like this.

434
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:58,564
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people who aren't going because they're afraid to run a game.

435
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,557
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I am running into the mountain.

436
00:29:01,637 --> 00:29:03,664
Speaker 1: my the same game you ran last time.

437
00:29:03,745 --> 00:29:07,278
Speaker 0: Yes much improved However, and converted to burning real gold.

438
00:29:07,921 --> 00:29:13,296
Speaker 1: I'm running a new game that I just came up with Scenario, I immediately kill myself.

439
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:14,521
Speaker 1: Oh you want to play in my game?

440
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:15,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

441
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:19,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, not if you give me a dick My character is a dick.

442
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:19,818
Speaker 0: Not me.

443
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:28,950
Speaker 1: Well, none of the characters are well actually Right in that, you know, usually when I play a burning wheel I make a character this dick, right?

444
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:44,539
Speaker 1: So when I made a scenario, I made one good character in three dicks And it's pretty much the three dicks dick in each other and the good in the one not dick being like anyway, I Don't know whatever other meta shit can wait.

445
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:47,030

00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:57,871
Speaker 0: We'll do it Whatever.

453
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,176
Speaker 0: The book is short.

454
00:29:59,216 --> 00:29:59,858
Speaker 0: Just read it.

455
00:29:59,918 --> 00:30:00,881
Speaker 0: It's also pretty cool.

456
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:08,908
Speaker 0: And if nothing else I'll say this even if you hate it There are some gems of quotes in here that you would behoove you to memorize and spit out it.

457
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:13,348
Speaker 1: Yeah I know I just I couldn't fucking memorize them, but I could when I came across them.

458
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:18,642
Speaker 0: I was like The Kind of quotes you got to put effort into memorizing.

459
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:20,250
Speaker 0: they're not the ones you'll just remember.

460
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,485
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, let's do something.

461
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:24,410
Speaker 0: All right.

462
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:30,570
Speaker 0: So since we've missed a ton of stuff, I think it's time and since we sort of ranted in the first half.

463
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,389
Speaker 0: How do y'all time for a tech news?

464
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,367
Speaker 1: Random you haven't done one since March so we can totally do this.

465
00:30:36,427 --> 00:30:37,010
Speaker 1: It's okay.

466
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:40,683
Speaker 0: So I want to start right off because today GoDaddy went down.

467
00:30:40,703 --> 00:30:46,998
Speaker 1: I think that's actually Really good thing that this happened because You know everyone.

468
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:49,350
Speaker 0: so what's funny is I heard it went down like I was at work, right?

469
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:54,610
Speaker 0: And we're actually migrating to Google mail, but we still have some GoDaddy stuff like running as we shut it all down.

470
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,510
Speaker 0: So the people still on GoDaddy you're like my email is not working.

471
00:30:59,032 --> 00:31:02,305
Speaker 0: So I look on Twitter and it's like duh GoDaddy's down.

472
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:07,867
Speaker 0: duh GoDaddy's being DDoS and Twitter knew way before anyone else knew.

473
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course I pretty much.

474
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:14,000
Speaker 1: if something is happening right now I always search Twitter before I search Google News or anything else.

475
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:19,023
Speaker 1: But anyway, so GoDaddy This is cool because they suck.

476
00:31:19,365 --> 00:31:20,330
Speaker 0: Yeah terrible company.

477
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:20,471
Speaker 0: I

478
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:37,249
Speaker 1: think it's one of those ones where a lot of people are on them And the reason people are customers of them is because they got into it somehow in the past like you didn't know who to register your domain with you went with GoDaddy because that's sort of like the One, you know or something and it's cheap, you know.

479
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:43,850
Speaker 1: Or people like got GoDaddy email before Google really existed or Gmail was good or you know.

480
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,397
Speaker 1: So they have a ton of customers.

481
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:56,350
Speaker 1: and they get customers because like people who aren't super internet He don't know where else to register domains like GoDaddy is domain registry sort of synonymous for a lot of people.

482
00:31:57,411 --> 00:32:04,134
Speaker 1: But I think most of the people who are sort of entrenched in there as opposed to the new clueless customers Want to leave.

483
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,299
Speaker 1: but they sort of works.

484
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,833
Speaker 1: it does work and even though they don't like GoDaddy They're just like.

485
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:10,320
Speaker 1: well, you know, they just go with the flow.

486
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,707
Speaker 1: They're not gonna put in effort.

487
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:13,235
Speaker 1: They're so lazy They don't want to.

488
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:14,845
Speaker 1: just you know, do work to get off of it.

489
00:32:14,905 --> 00:32:15,569
Speaker 1: Even they don't like it.

490
00:32:16,053 --> 00:32:17,969
Speaker 1: So this is like aha now they're down.

491
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,536
Speaker 1: Now what are you gonna do?

492
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:22,090
Speaker 1: and I think a lot of more people are gonna are gonna bail.

493
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:31,525
Speaker 0: Well, I saw something like they lost a ridiculous number of subscribers, you know, not that long ago Right, they backed SOPA and that was a small, you know impetus to leave.

494
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:33,090
Speaker 1: now your fucking website doesn't work.

495
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,885
Speaker 1: Cuz their DNS server is down and your DNS is hosted there.

496
00:32:35,905 --> 00:32:41,289
Speaker 0: No A lot of people seem to point directly at their DNS.

497
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:42,356
Speaker 1: Well, that's what it does.

498
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:48,310
Speaker 1: by default if you register a domain with them You don't think people know to change DNS servers, but keep GoDaddy is the registrar.

499
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:53,110
Speaker 0: You know how many people my support team was dealing with saying they're calling and they're like, I can't get to your website.

500
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:54,622
Speaker 0: We're like, can you get to any website?

501
00:32:54,863 --> 00:33:00,741
Speaker 1: They're like, no Yeah Yeah, but anyway, I think it's good.

502
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:02,050
Speaker 1: a lot of people leave GoDaddy.

503
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,740
Speaker 1: The thing is the news articles are of course not accurate.

504
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,622
Speaker 1: what apparently happened.

505
00:33:06,642 --> 00:33:09,350
Speaker 1: This was done by one anonymous guy.

506
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:14,391
Speaker 1: But a lot of articles are saying anonymous brings down GoDaddy But it's like.

507
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:17,702
Speaker 1: no was actually one anonymous guy at least claims that he did it.

508
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:18,224
Speaker 1: Right?

509
00:33:18,645 --> 00:33:20,130
Speaker 1: So who knows well anonymous?

510
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I guess it was me.

511
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:27,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it is one specific guy who is like anonymous Underscore something on Twitter.

512
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he may or may not be.

513
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think he's proved that he did it.

514
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,566
Speaker 1: He just has taken claim that he did also.

515
00:33:35,068 --> 00:33:35,770
Speaker 0: what is anonymous?

516
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:38,222
Speaker 0: I mean, there's the I'm Spartacus situation exactly.

517
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,730
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's yeah.

518
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:44,765
Speaker 0: I've just between tasteless advertising shady business practices and the whole SOPA thing.

519
00:33:45,326 --> 00:33:46,610
Speaker 0: I have no truck with GoDaddy.

520
00:33:46,951 --> 00:33:51,166
Speaker 1: Why would anyone still be a customer of GoDaddy if you knew how to change?

521
00:33:51,186 --> 00:33:54,586
Speaker 0: I Think that is the only reason GoDaddy has customers.

522
00:33:54,808 --> 00:33:56,997
Speaker 0: Yeah So you got something.

523
00:33:57,258 --> 00:33:58,346
Speaker 0: tech news roundup your turn.

524
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:09,984
Speaker 1: oh But I mean, I thought we sort of when I didn't open up my all right Let's talk about my internet didn't work because your routers all Google fiber Getting rolled out in Kansas City and they set up.

525
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:11,230
Speaker 1: we talked about that a while ago.

526
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,353
Speaker 0: So they had all these neighborhoods.

527
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:19,179
Speaker 0: There were two hundred and two neighborhoods that were offered the service and I don't know exactly what the process is.

528
00:34:19,279 --> 00:34:23,576
Speaker 0: But apparently now that the deadlines have come in 90% of them said hells.

529
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

530
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,041
Speaker 1: Hells.

531
00:34:25,081 --> 00:34:27,510
Speaker 1: Yeah people are you know, no one's that dumb.

532
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:42,070
Speaker 0: Now what's interesting is that a lot of the people in neighboring neighborhoods that are kind of outside of this seem to be of the opinion that AT&T and other providers in those areas are doing everything they can to keep the Google fiber out forever.

533
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:49,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because they the thing is right their choice is do you keep the Google fiber out or try to compete with it?

534
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,931
Speaker 1: And like they can't compete with it because then they're fucked I mean

535
00:34:52,951 --> 00:35:03,130
Speaker 0: look FiOS will have a hard time competing with it and FiOS is Actually kind of horribly kicked out of areas even in New York City by Comcast and other companies that don't want to compete with

536
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,270
Speaker 1: it.

537
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,792
Speaker 1: Well, here's the.

538
00:35:04,173 --> 00:35:05,357
Speaker 1: here's the real problem, right?

539
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:07,746
Speaker 1: So you you know use this sort of.

540
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:13,189
Speaker 1: you have this sort of Collusion that's going on to jack up the prices with these local monopolies and the whole thing.

541
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:21,010
Speaker 1: So your prices are way high So you're making a lot of money and you can't really go to more other places because some other guy has a local monopolies.

542
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,595
Speaker 1: You can't expand that much.

543
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:24,541
Speaker 1: So you're a cop.

544
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:25,544
Speaker 1: You're a public company though.

545
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:26,267
Speaker 1: You have to grow.

546
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:27,290
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to shrink.

547
00:35:27,371 --> 00:35:27,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

548
00:35:27,874 --> 00:35:35,250
Speaker 0: Fuck that local monopolies should be like Obviously, they have a cap on profits and everything else has been refunded to customers, right?

549
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,850
Speaker 1: But you know, they it's basically you have to keep growing because that's what public companies have.

550
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:44,790
Speaker 1: So if you suddenly have to compete in a price war, this is why they collude.

551
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:53,350
Speaker 1: If you even even if they're not actually, you know Literally getting together in secret meetings and colluding they collude by accident because they all need to grow.

552
00:35:53,691 --> 00:36:01,059
Speaker 1: So if one guy goes low to take all the customers, you know Everyone else goes low and the customers will not.

553
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,530
Speaker 1: you know, everyone knows everyone will drop down in the price war.

554
00:36:04,932 --> 00:36:07,803
Speaker 1: You know, the margins will shrink and everyone will shrink.

555
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,249
Speaker 1: There's no way to win.

556
00:36:09,814 --> 00:36:10,076
Speaker 1: You know.

557
00:36:10,137 --> 00:36:17,637
Speaker 1: the battle of the price There's also the situation of it will guarantee to make your company Shrink and not grow.

558
00:36:17,858 --> 00:36:22,616
Speaker 1: but in some neighborhoods, even if you're profitable and doing well You will be losing.

559
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:31,481
Speaker 0: but in some neighborhoods like co-ops and condo boards and things and in like certain apartment buildings One company will actually get an exclusive contract with that building.

560
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:34,228
Speaker 0: Yep to prevent anyone else from going in straight up.

561
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:39,524
Speaker 1: Yep But it's now Google comes in and it's like usually the only people who you know.

562
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:41,610
Speaker 1: an outsider who sees a collusion situation.

563
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,190
Speaker 1: He doesn't you know to get any business for him is growing as opposed to shrinking.

564
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:49,080
Speaker 1: So that's the person they're worried about.

565
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,997
Speaker 1: if you come in from the outside with a low price You're just busy gonna fuck all of them.

566
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,984
Speaker 1: and you know, we talked about how like.

567
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,890
Speaker 1: well this slow adoption here, right?

568
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,593
Speaker 1: Who's gonna really?

569
00:36:57,613 --> 00:36:58,838
Speaker 1: you know, people are lazy to go off.

570
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,827
Speaker 1: go daddy people are lazy to.

571
00:37:01,169 --> 00:37:01,390
Speaker 1: you know.

572
00:37:01,611 --> 00:37:04,310
Speaker 1: Get you know, we're gonna find out what size tablet or phone they need.

573
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,644
Speaker 1: But when people really hate something and people really hate.

574
00:37:08,885 --> 00:37:10,250
Speaker 0: everyone hates their local telco.

575
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,076
Speaker 0: They're local.

576
00:37:11,157 --> 00:37:17,967
Speaker 1: everyone hates them so bad Right that even normal people hate their Comcast and the cable visions and the.

577
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:21,465
Speaker 0: you know people People really treating nothing about.

578
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,310
Speaker 0: how is the local internet time orders?

579
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,039
Speaker 1: everyone hates Time Warner's right and people hate their mobile phone carriers so much.

580
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,746
Speaker 1: if One person came into the market with a viable product at a real price.

581
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:33,830
Speaker 1: That wasn't bullshit.

582
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:37,630
Speaker 1: Everyone would switch to them like that like boom.

583
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,135
Speaker 1: so this is what exactly what's happening.

584
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:41,081
Speaker 1: Google's coming in because it's Google.

585
00:37:41,101 --> 00:37:47,740
Speaker 1: they can't keep them out because Google's so big and Everyone even normal people's like, oh you kidding me.

586
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,968
Speaker 1: I can get away from Comcast Time Warner AT&T.

587
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:56,530
Speaker 0: Fuck Yeah, it's not just that it's that it's so cheap and it's so fast.

588
00:37:57,074 --> 00:37:58,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I mean it's ridiculous.

589
00:37:59,203 --> 00:38:07,170
Speaker 0: But yeah The the fact that there I see some you know Some of the older media people who are surprised that so many people are you know going on board with Google.

590
00:38:08,113 --> 00:38:13,122
Speaker 1: duh Yeah, if Google made a mobile phone carrier guess what happened.

591
00:38:13,664 --> 00:38:19,070
Speaker 0: So speaking of Google, uh They've recently put forth this idea.

592
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:27,009
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's live but some people claim to have been running into them where instead of having a paywall They have a survey wall.

593
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:33,982
Speaker 0: So it's you can't do this thing until you get you like on a thing in Google News and it pops up a little survey Google News, I've never seen that.

594
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:38,118
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's where people Sometimes does that with like.

595
00:38:38,158 --> 00:38:42,709
Speaker 1: the ads will have a survey in them, but you don't have to take it You just wait or skip it or whatever, you know, yep.

596
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:51,586
Speaker 0: So apparently Google demoed this new thing 18 months ago to Publishers saying this is something we'd like to offer.

597
00:38:51,687 --> 00:38:53,978
Speaker 1: I'm sure yeah I mean, I'm sure Google would love to.

598
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:56,770
Speaker 1: basically what that means is on your website.

599
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:58,581
Speaker 1: Google is never gonna put it on their website.

600
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,070
Speaker 1: It's on your website.

601
00:39:00,231 --> 00:39:02,160
Speaker 1: You're stupid and you decide that it's not.

602
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:09,737
Speaker 0: so when I say Google News right now Remember what Google does is that if they can't get to your site because you have a paywall You're just not listed.

603
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,530
Speaker 0: like those articles don't show up in Google News.

604
00:39:12,272 --> 00:39:13,457
Speaker 0: So I think what they're gonna.

605
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:19,542
Speaker 0: maybe they'll make a deal where if you use the survey wall You can still be listed on Google News.

606
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,030
Speaker 0: That's the speculation the big thing.

607
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:31,778
Speaker 1: I do notice though that on Google News a lot of times I'll click on something on my phone on Google News and there won't necessarily be a wall of any kind But they'll get one of those pages.

608
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,910
Speaker 1: that's like install the app or continue to the news.

609
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,937
Speaker 0: Oh my god, fuck that who listen.

610
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:36,940
Speaker 0: local news team.

611
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:39,248
Speaker 0: I'm never going to install your app.

612
00:39:39,308 --> 00:39:39,750
Speaker 1: No kidding.

613
00:39:41,071 --> 00:39:51,230
Speaker 1: And the worst is when someone links to a news from Facebook and it's like click on it and it's like you must Use our app to read this article and it's like no the articles on your website.

614
00:39:51,873 --> 00:39:57,908
Speaker 1: But because there's a link on Facebook and you have some things set up It's forcing me to install a Facebook app to reach your article.

615
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:58,190
Speaker 1: Guess what?

616
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,135
Speaker 1: I'm just not gonna read your article.

617
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:00,422
Speaker 0: now the trouble with these one.

618
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:01,970
Speaker 0: I find the price is kind of ridiculous.

619
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:09,154
Speaker 0: it says in the article that people companies have said straight up that you're willing to pay a rate of a hundred and fifty dollars per 1,500 responses.

620
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:09,315
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

621
00:40:11,654 --> 00:40:14,632
Speaker 0: so one I Don't like.

622
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:22,621
Speaker 0: I. if anything like that ever appears I just close it and if I can't get to the content without clicking through it I pretty much click randomly until it disappears.

623
00:40:22,801 --> 00:40:22,982
Speaker 0: Yep.

624
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:23,966
Speaker 0: I can't imagine.

625
00:40:24,006 --> 00:40:24,849
Speaker 0: I'm not the only one.

626
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:28,443
Speaker 0: No I'm dubious of this but it's no.

627
00:40:28,523 --> 00:40:34,990
Speaker 0: it's a ripoff to the people Paying for it in the same way that most internet ads are ripoffs to the people paying for them.

628
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,975
Speaker 1: Here's something I sort of realized lately.

629
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:42,870
Speaker 1: right you look around the world and you can sort of organize companies into a few categories.

630
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:44,350
Speaker 0: Well, you get it the ones you can.

631
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,830
Speaker 1: You can organize anything into any number of categories.

632
00:40:47,931 --> 00:40:49,229
Speaker 1: That's a pointless thing to say.

633
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,785
Speaker 1: But I see some companies that do a real business of some kind and make a money for a reason.

634
00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,332
Speaker 1: for example a laundromat Makes money.

635
00:40:57,533 --> 00:40:58,375
Speaker 1: they provide a service.

636
00:40:58,415 --> 00:40:59,719
Speaker 1: they clean your goddamn laundry.

637
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,642
Speaker 1: They make money.

638
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:05,070
Speaker 1: you buy soap you put coins in the machines They're selling you a thing directly.

639
00:41:05,511 --> 00:41:10,103
Speaker 1: There are other companies that they don't really make any thing.

640
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:12,590
Speaker 1: take for example the Olympics, right?

641
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,668
Speaker 1: What is the Olympics make?

642
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:15,113
Speaker 1: Nothing.

643
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:18,810
Speaker 1: they sell tickets, I guess you can argue that they manufacture entertainment.

644
00:41:18,991 --> 00:41:24,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, you know, the entertainment isn't really something, you know, it's it's sort of ephemeral.

645
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,738
Speaker 1: Most of their money right comes from ads.

646
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,750
Speaker 1: right sponsorships and advertisements is where the bulk of their money comes from.

647
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:35,907
Speaker 1: They don't make enough money from the tickets and the direct sales to pay for the whole thing.

648
00:41:35,967 --> 00:41:36,810
Speaker 1: It's way too expensive.

649
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:43,690
Speaker 1: So because of that what ends up happening to a company like the Olympics or a newspaper, right?

650
00:41:44,131 --> 00:41:46,862
Speaker 1: Is that you're still owned by yourself?

651
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:54,105
Speaker 1: you make all the decisions for yourself But you have these advertisers who give you most of your money and the advertisers.

652
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:55,730
Speaker 1: They don't give a fuck about your business.

653
00:41:56,012 --> 00:41:58,810
Speaker 1: They only give a fuck about their business, but they're not dumb.

654
00:41:59,031 --> 00:41:59,753
Speaker 1: They know.

655
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:03,748
Speaker 1: maybe you know, they're not so dumb that they think that their ads are actually working seat.

656
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,090
Speaker 0: now Here's the problem.

657
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:12,090
Speaker 0: Every study I ever read about this says that certain kinds of ads work so well that their industries depend upon them entirely.

658
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:18,990
Speaker 0: Those industries are the cars the upper-end alcohol industry and the car industry.

659
00:42:19,713 --> 00:42:20,376
Speaker 0: I read something.

660
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:30,480
Speaker 0: it was talking about how the majority of people today who buy cars Buy the first car that they test drive With doing no research and they're primarily influenced by advertisements.

661
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:31,484
Speaker 0: They saw a force-head car.

662
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:31,805
Speaker 0: Yep.

663
00:42:32,246 --> 00:42:38,670
Speaker 0: But anyway the And notice how if you watch like The Daily Show, it's nothing but alcohol and car ads, of course.

664
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,503
Speaker 1: But the point is alcohol and car companies actually make something.

665
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:44,430
Speaker 1: Daily Show doesn't really make something right?

666
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:45,413
Speaker 1: So what ends up happening?

667
00:42:45,453 --> 00:42:47,923
Speaker 1: entertainment it does but it doesn't make a thing.

668
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:49,750
Speaker 1: They don't make money directly.

669
00:42:49,811 --> 00:42:52,130
Speaker 1: They made all their money from the ads and the ad companies.

670
00:42:52,855 --> 00:43:00,710
Speaker 1: They might know their ads may or may not work But they recognize the fact that that company would not exist if not for their ads.

671
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,860
Speaker 1: So they boss that company around right.

672
00:43:04,901 --> 00:43:07,467
Speaker 1: for example visa at the Olympics was like hey Olympics.

673
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:14,930
Speaker 1: in the Olympic area No one's allowed to accept any credit card, but visa right and they know that that's not good for the Olympic people.

674
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,859
Speaker 1: It makes them look bad, but they don't give a fuck.

675
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:19,724
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, whatever.

676
00:43:19,744 --> 00:43:22,112
Speaker 1: That's we can come up with any ridiculous demand We want.

677
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,450
Speaker 1: you have to say yes, because if we pull our gigantic sponsorship, you're fucked.

678
00:43:25,651 --> 00:43:28,644
Speaker 0: So yeah, we like Kickstarter or so disruptive.

679
00:43:28,664 --> 00:43:30,010
Speaker 0: Look at the penny arcade Kickstarter, right?

680
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,289
Speaker 0: It was basically you know what?

681
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,800
Speaker 0: We're not gonna have ads anymore if you guys give us the money right now.

682
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:45,022
Speaker 1: in effect a company that depends on advertising Even if you're not even if you have a business other than advertising if advertising is a large enough part of your revenue Remember you have to keep growing.

683
00:43:45,043 --> 00:43:50,110
Speaker 1: you can't shrink You know, you have to do what advertisers tell you to do.

684
00:43:50,190 --> 00:44:00,805
Speaker 1: They sort of they're sort of like they own your company in a way and they can give you orders and you have to choose to either Hurt your business badly or obey but they had.

685
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:02,130
Speaker 1: they take on none of the risk.

686
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:10,610
Speaker 1: So they'll just order you to do ridiculous things like dance for me monkey dance Or you'll be out of business cuz I give you 25% of your revenue is my advertising dollar.

687
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:16,049
Speaker 0: I think I still think and I've read this for a while I think we're getting actually kind of close to the point will start to happen.

688
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:19,923
Speaker 0: I think there's gonna be a crash in the online advertising.

689
00:44:19,983 --> 00:44:21,930
Speaker 1: I think a big crap, but I think but it's an example.

690
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:24,269
Speaker 1: So the newspaper your newspaper, right?

691
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:32,116
Speaker 1: Newspapers are a little different than other businesses and they sort of have this ethical thing where you can't necessarily write articles Really been true exactly.

692
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:38,215
Speaker 1: but other companies that are not newspapers don't even have that Not really been true.

693
00:44:38,315 --> 00:44:38,576
Speaker 1: ethics.

694
00:44:38,596 --> 00:44:40,101
Speaker 0: They got nothing and the arcade did.

695
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:42,470
Speaker 1: that penny arcade had its own ethics.

696
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:48,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, their own ethic of you know, we'll nominally only advertise things that we directly and little not nominally.

697
00:44:48,367 --> 00:44:49,510
Speaker 1: they will only at right.

698
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:50,253
Speaker 0: Well, that's what they say.

699
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:53,546
Speaker 0: I say nominally because I can't read their brains.

700
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:54,189
Speaker 1: That's true.

701
00:44:55,631 --> 00:45:04,677
Speaker 1: But other companies that aren't penny arcade with it with a stated ethos or newspapers with a supposed to have an ethos They just can do whatever the Olympics.

702
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:05,600
Speaker 1: they can just do another fuck.

703
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,051
Speaker 1: advertisers tell them and there's nothing wrong or unethical about that Whatsoever.

704
00:45:09,071 --> 00:45:10,536
Speaker 1: they can just totally do whatever that right.

705
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:17,779
Speaker 1: So these newspapers some advertisers says yeah, you know what I'm fuckin You know would be really nice for me as an advertiser.

706
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:20,570
Speaker 1: I don't care if anyone sees your content or hates your newspaper.

707
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:21,426
Speaker 1: That doesn't matter to me.

708
00:45:22,312 --> 00:45:29,010
Speaker 1: So, why don't we just turn your site into a survey that gives me information I really need to make my products sell better.

709
00:45:30,071 --> 00:45:35,946
Speaker 1: So Scott says you brought this up and the newspapers choice is lose a large chunk of revenue.

710
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:42,630
Speaker 0: to you a question How do we pay for content that does require money to make?

711
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:44,392
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

712
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:47,277
Speaker 0: I Opposed it because we don't have an answer.

713
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:48,161
Speaker 0: No one has an answer.

714
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:51,294
Speaker 0: whoever answers that effectively Wins.

715
00:45:51,314 --> 00:45:55,269
Speaker 1: but the point is if you own the company like say a magazine, right?

716
00:45:57,019 --> 00:46:22,621
Speaker 0: I'm a bad example because and so I've gotten closer and closer to the upper ends of business and Like I know what pitches work like and you know, like equity like all that stuff I've seen the trend in a lot of mid to smaller sized companies not becoming public and Remaining privately owned so they can do whatever the fuck they want And then thus like say I ran a game studio if I made enough money To pay everyone who worked for me good money.

717
00:46:22,642 --> 00:46:24,410
Speaker 0: I would not try to grow.

718
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:31,229
Speaker 1: Okay, but let's say you have a company that already exists, right and I would not see.

719
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:32,775
Speaker 0: that's the thing I wouldn't know.

720
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:34,281
Speaker 1: and you know, you had you already.

721
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:35,607
Speaker 1: you own this company, right?

722
00:46:35,647 --> 00:46:38,017
Speaker 1: It's a private It's a privately owned company you own.

723
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:41,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, and 25% of your monies comes from an advertise.

724
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't I would not assume that revenue stream in the first place.

725
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:45,114
Speaker 0: And if I were.

726
00:46:45,134 --> 00:46:46,661
Speaker 1: but I say no, but it's already there.

727
00:46:46,782 --> 00:46:51,962
Speaker 1: and if the advertiser is a good advertiser they only want completely tasteful ads and it's totally legit.

728
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:57,676
Speaker 1: and you like them and you have a good relationship with them right and you're friends with them and You know, they're they're not bad.

729
00:46:57,917 --> 00:47:00,465
Speaker 1: and 25% of your money comes from ads they buy.

730
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:01,228
Speaker 0: Okay, that's fine.

731
00:47:01,468 --> 00:47:09,706
Speaker 1: one day They come to you and they say look We would really like it if you put this horrible pocky all go to business before I'll deal with that bullshit.

732
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:13,124
Speaker 1: and then they say Okay, and they take away 25% of revenues.

733
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:14,353
Speaker 0: So I've.

734
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:17,510
Speaker 0: I've lost more revenue than that on things before and you get it back.

735
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:17,952
Speaker 0: What if it's 50%?

736
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:18,133
Speaker 1: Well one.

737
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:22,252
Speaker 1: if it was 50% That's what.

738
00:47:22,352 --> 00:47:35,490
Speaker 0: if any one source of my company's revenue was more than like 20% Already, I would have sort of weekly or monthly meetings of how do we distribute our income such to not be beholden to anyone, right?

739
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,088
Speaker 1: And what if your options are?

740
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:44,055
Speaker 0: Well, if my options are then my business model was fucked anyway, yeah Now what it now?

741
00:47:44,096 --> 00:47:46,930
Speaker 0: here's the and that's when you try something radical.

742
00:47:47,091 --> 00:47:47,974
Speaker 1: All right, try this ready?

743
00:47:48,014 --> 00:47:49,500
Speaker 1: Here's getting radical.

744
00:47:49,521 --> 00:47:49,922
Speaker 1: You ready?

745
00:47:50,143 --> 00:47:50,806
Speaker 1: You're set your.

746
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:51,770
Speaker 1: you don't own the company.

747
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:53,698
Speaker 1: You're set your lower on the totem pole.

748
00:47:53,718 --> 00:47:55,747
Speaker 1: You're gonna be second or third down the line, right?

749
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,028
Speaker 0: Okay This is you're gonna like my answer.

750
00:47:59,413 --> 00:48:01,900
Speaker 1: Half of the revenues come from an advertiser.

751
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:07,095
Speaker 1: the advertiser makes these ridiculous demands like, you know Oh makes only except visa.

752
00:48:07,256 --> 00:48:09,142
Speaker 1: All right, is this kind of paying me my salary?

753
00:48:09,403 --> 00:48:11,490
Speaker 1: and wait, the boss is totally okay with that.

754
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,035
Speaker 1: He's just like just fucking do it.

755
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:15,202
Speaker 1: Let's only accept visa guys.

756
00:48:15,283 --> 00:48:16,467
Speaker 0: Are they paying me my salary?

757
00:48:16,587 --> 00:48:16,868
Speaker 0: Yes.

758
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:17,390
Speaker 0: I don't care.

759
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:20,356
Speaker 0: Don't give one shit.

760
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,102
Speaker 1: Don't give any shit.

761
00:48:22,263 --> 00:48:24,210
Speaker 1: Look at all the fucks he gives.

762
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:31,330
Speaker 0: I only give a fuck if either I have a vested interest in the company or I'm passionate about what the company does exactly.

763
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:38,990
Speaker 1: So we have this situation where most of these companies don't have rim as the number one They might have rim is number two or lower.

764
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:45,995
Speaker 0: But no matter because all or two quits that look at face the majority of these number one all the number twos quit.

765
00:48:46,035 --> 00:48:47,720
Speaker 1: the majority of these number ones.

766
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,640
Speaker 1: just say yes to these advertisers and they're living off advertising money and They're just like whee who gives it.

767
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:53,325
Speaker 1: we're making money.

768
00:48:53,345 --> 00:48:53,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, awesome.

769
00:48:55,111 --> 00:48:58,903
Speaker 1: And they just basically what they're operating is not the company.

770
00:48:58,923 --> 00:48:59,786
Speaker 1: They think they're operating.

771
00:48:59,806 --> 00:49:00,970
Speaker 1: They're not operating newspaper.

772
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:05,918
Speaker 1: they're operating basically a. You know just a place for.

773
00:49:05,938 --> 00:49:14,210
Speaker 1: you know ad inventory for this advertiser and Really the advertiser owns them not doesn't really own them on paper.

774
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:16,599
Speaker 0: But so it's got much like in the 1920s.

775
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,450
Speaker 0: the factory owner owns the worker, right?

776
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,110
Speaker 1: He the the advertiser de facto owns your company and that they can give you any order.

777
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,961
Speaker 1: They want to benefit their business and your choices are obey or be fucked.

778
00:49:28,202 --> 00:49:30,910
Speaker 1: obey and the advertiser who's you know?

779
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:31,993
Speaker 1: Is taking no risk.

780
00:49:32,194 --> 00:49:36,890
Speaker 1: the advertiser could start his own magazine if you wanted to like GameStop owns their own magazine, right?

781
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,921
Speaker 1: But then it's a risk because you're paying for this thing.

782
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:42,090
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know, there's no risk.

783
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,240
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god some ad inventory disappeared.

784
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,104
Speaker 1: There's other inventory.

785
00:49:45,124 --> 00:49:46,550
Speaker 1: We'll just move that money elsewhere.

786
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,020
Speaker 1: Well, it's no we don't give a shit.

787
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:49,530
Speaker 1: So someone else lost their job.

788
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,070
Speaker 1: No one at our company got hurt at all by that newspaper going out of business.

789
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:57,175
Speaker 1: So they'll tell right so they'll tell all the newspapers Yeah, you know be great.

790
00:49:57,236 --> 00:50:02,179
Speaker 1: if your newspaper was really just a thing to collect data for us That would be great.

791
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,065
Speaker 1: So two things.

792
00:50:03,206 --> 00:50:03,850
Speaker 1: It's very simple.

793
00:50:04,453 --> 00:50:11,162
Speaker 0: I have a sense of business ethics and would never ask Anyone who worked for me to do anything that I was morally opposed to know.

794
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:13,750
Speaker 1: you're asking some company that you deep some other company.

795
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,897
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit Oh and I don't play.

796
00:50:15,938 --> 00:50:27,289
Speaker 0: not you realize how many times when Anyone in any industry asked me advice about things involving like two customers that have competing interests or anything like that My answer is always a fistful of dollars.

797
00:50:29,012 --> 00:50:31,181
Speaker 0: And basically if someone gets the reference I usually know they're good.

798
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:36,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's that's an aside two rocks Throw rocks at both the customers.

799
00:50:36,518 --> 00:50:43,965
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway to move on so Kindle Amazon announced that the new Kindle fire was gonna have ads.

800
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:45,170
Speaker 0: you couldn't get rid of them.

801
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:51,170
Speaker 1: Yeah up until now you've been able to buy Kindles with or without ads and the idea was well This is the fire the tablet, right?

802
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,735
Speaker 1: But well you the regular Kindle.

803
00:50:52,755 --> 00:50:56,770
Speaker 1: at least you could buy it without ads or you could buy it with ads and it would be.

804
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:59,107
Speaker 1: But then you could pay money to make the ads go away.

805
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:03,063
Speaker 0: now I bought my Kindle without ads because I also my mind without it.

806
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:04,046
Speaker 0: seriously.

807
00:51:04,066 --> 00:51:05,838
Speaker 1: I Also don't.

808
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:08,457
Speaker 1: I've never bought a Kindle book 95 called.

809
00:51:08,497 --> 00:51:10,990
Speaker 0: they want their free PC back.

810
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:15,506
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's actually you know, there is a place for it right in that, you know.

811
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:28,269
Speaker 1: on the one hand You've got device, you know Someone wrote a thing on the internet a week or so ago a few days and it was like hey look I think was a guy writing on Google+ and he's like look Google they sell you this thing for cheap Because they want you to look at their ads.

812
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:32,266
Speaker 1: Amazon sells you this thing for cheap because they want you to buy Amazon products through it.

813
00:51:32,307 --> 00:51:33,110
Speaker 1: It's a bait-and-switch.

814
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:36,663
Speaker 1: Apple is selling you the thing and what do they want to do?

815
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:39,453
Speaker 1: They want to sell you the thing Right.

816
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:41,727
Speaker 1: That's why the Apple thing is not a bait-and-switch.

817
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:45,370
Speaker 1: instead The Apple thing is a ridiculously high margin and cost us a million extra dollars.

818
00:51:45,551 --> 00:51:56,190
Speaker 0: I just I have an ideological problem with this just in the sense that Every in all of history the moment you have hardware that has arbitrary software restrictions like this.

819
00:51:57,351 --> 00:52:00,701
Speaker 0: What did everyone smart do who got one of those free ad PCs?

820
00:52:00,862 --> 00:52:02,969
Speaker 0: No, they installed Linux on it or something.

821
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:03,370
Speaker 1: That's right.

822
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:06,370
Speaker 0: Oh, what about the people who got the piece that at the bar in the bottom?

823
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:15,349
Speaker 0: That would show you ads and you pay you like a penny a day to have those ads there and you'd have like a thousand Of those toolbars with a macro that moved your mouse around randomly.

824
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:19,379
Speaker 0: Anyway, the I did that for a while.

825
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,248
Speaker 0: I made like 10 bucks over the course of a year.

826
00:52:22,509 --> 00:52:24,376
Speaker 1: great You could've just done virtual machines.

827
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:26,484
Speaker 0: No, I had an old 486 that we weren't using.

828
00:52:26,504 --> 00:52:30,627
Speaker 0: so I installed this Virtual machines back then not like now.

829
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:38,710
Speaker 0: Yeah I just got this ad bar running as many times as I could and I had the windows macro thing that I copied from my Windows 3 1 1 and literally my mouse just went.

830
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,650
Speaker 0: I left it running for like weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.

831
00:52:44,112 --> 00:52:48,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think there is this place probably only made a few dollars.

832
00:52:49,134 --> 00:52:57,185
Speaker 1: He's sort of subsidized by bait-and-switch devices, you know Sell you a music player because I'm gonna for cheap cuz I'm gonna make money on the blades.

833
00:52:57,426 --> 00:52:58,770
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

834
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,090
Speaker 1: I'm also fine with it.

835
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:08,438
Speaker 1: I don't like it as long as I will still buy your razor that needs blades as long as It operates without blades.

836
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:09,141
Speaker 1: I bought a Kindle.

837
00:53:09,443 --> 00:53:11,050
Speaker 1: I paid for no ads, right?

838
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,385
Speaker 1: It was only slightly more expensive.

839
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:12,750
Speaker 1: and you know what?

840
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,420
Speaker 1: I've never bought a single Kindle book that has DRM.

841
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:18,794
Speaker 1: that was not free not ever not once You know.

842
00:53:18,854 --> 00:53:19,316
Speaker 1: and it's like.

843
00:53:19,617 --> 00:53:21,665
Speaker 1: it doesn't like magically turn off or anything.

844
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:22,730
Speaker 1: It doesn't not work.

845
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:29,550
Speaker 1: It's it's a device and it works as a device and I got it for cheap because someone else is subsidizing it by buying Kindle.

846
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,992
Speaker 0: That's at least an indirect Subsidization.

847
00:53:33,152 --> 00:53:34,517
Speaker 1: it's not my problem and you know it.

848
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:42,790
Speaker 1: everyone can do it and then basically Amazon will be forced to either a realize Oh this Kindle is not working out for us and they'll stop making it or B. They'll go to the Apple.

849
00:53:43,432 --> 00:53:47,985
Speaker 0: Here's why I was a little more Mad about this one in particular because one you couldn't turn it off.

850
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:48,910
Speaker 0: You couldn't turn it off.

851
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:50,720
Speaker 1: So basically don't buy that device.

852
00:53:51,022 --> 00:53:51,324
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

853
00:53:51,344 --> 00:54:04,009
Speaker 0: it wasn't a bait and switch It was just switch, but it was just here there ads on your thing Not just on the sleep screen, which isn't visible all the time But also at the lower right hand corner of your little desktop or whatever all the time.

854
00:54:04,615 --> 00:54:16,303
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought it was just in the sleep Yeah, and they announced, you know, no opt-out and all that there was an internet shitstorm and within one day They retracted it and decided that you know what?

855
00:54:16,343 --> 00:54:18,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can opt-out for $15.

856
00:54:18,752 --> 00:54:21,963
Speaker 0: What bothers me is what Bezos said about it?

857
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:23,970
Speaker 1: He said most people leave the ads.

858
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:28,897
Speaker 0: No I don't care about that because I know that Conrad said something that I do agree with.

859
00:54:29,198 --> 00:54:44,277
Speaker 0: he pointed out that what Amazon is going after with this with these devices They're subsidized is the the recently emerged demographic that literally Does not care at all about privacy or advertising and will trade Anything anything they have.

860
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:47,170
Speaker 0: that is not physical property or money for content.

861
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:51,767
Speaker 1: Well, I mean look at you know, how many people at PAX are like desperate for swag.

862
00:54:51,807 --> 00:54:52,794
Speaker 1: Oh my god free shit Exactly.

863
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:53,910
Speaker 1: Oh, there's free t-shirts.

864
00:54:54,014 --> 00:54:59,347
Speaker 1: Oh my god some ugly ass t-shirt that I'd be embarrassed to wear except while sleeping and you're like fighting to get it.

865
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:02,901
Speaker 0: That is a Perfectly valid demographic to go after though.

866
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:05,170
Speaker 0: You could argue there are ethical considerations.

867
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:10,170
Speaker 1: Those are the only people advertising works on and so that's the only people you can get smart people gonna do it.

868
00:55:11,352 --> 00:55:14,846
Speaker 0: Because this reminded me a little bit of Larry Ellison and his bullshit.

869
00:55:14,866 --> 00:55:24,521
Speaker 0: for many years ago Jeff Bezos said and I quote we want to make money when people use our devices Not when they buy our devices.

870
00:55:24,641 --> 00:55:24,862
Speaker 1: Yep.

871
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,659
Speaker 0: I The I can't say, you know slippery slippers.

872
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:32,787
Speaker 0: all these arguments that are not really that solid about why that's bad.

873
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:50,081
Speaker 0: as a professional in the technology industry a large company whose goal is to Monetize hardware beyond selling the hardware through a means that isn't just selling you more software on top of it is As close to evil as I think you can get without being even

874
00:55:50,202 --> 00:55:51,547
Speaker 1: well sort of right

875
00:55:51,607 --> 00:55:52,450
Speaker 0: from the perspective.

876
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:56,403
Speaker 0: You know evil is a relative term of my own ideology as a technologist.

877
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,410
Speaker 1: Here's the thing that people have based, right?

878
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,530
Speaker 1: So it's if you look at video games, right?

879
00:56:00,670 --> 00:56:07,650
Speaker 1: It's we started out with arcades and people loved arcades because you know that the arcade games are way better than home games.

880
00:56:07,790 --> 00:56:14,878
Speaker 1: Also the social element and social element and you would go in and if you own the arcade People would just keep paying you money.

881
00:56:14,918 --> 00:56:17,670
Speaker 1: So you bought this thing, but that thing paid out.

882
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:24,430
Speaker 1: You know, it just kept filling up with money all the time like woo It's a money machine, right and that's what you like to own and when your business is money machine.

883
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:29,689
Speaker 0: But then one guy was like wait a minute the crane game makes ten times the money compared to what I.

884
00:56:29,729 --> 00:56:32,941
Speaker 1: well What happened is there's a console at home.

885
00:56:33,001 --> 00:56:35,390
Speaker 1: people could get as good as arcade at home.

886
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:36,656
Speaker 0: I don't think that killed the arcade.

887
00:56:36,837 --> 00:56:42,542
Speaker 1: No, but I mean, you know, the point is is that That that did not make anyone a money machine.

888
00:56:42,582 --> 00:56:42,883
Speaker 1: It was.

889
00:56:42,903 --> 00:56:43,867
Speaker 1: we need no money machine?

890
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,333
Speaker 1: Yes, but it was.

891
00:56:45,373 --> 00:56:45,795
Speaker 1: they kept.

892
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:49,290
Speaker 1: they need to kept working hard for you to make more stuff.

893
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,225
Speaker 1: They wouldn't just make money off of.

894
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:51,910
Speaker 0: that's what you're getting at.

895
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,710
Speaker 1: This is why this mother play Mario as much as you wanted from home.

896
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,981
Speaker 1: But now they've sort of got the best thing they've ever wanted.

897
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:09,150
Speaker 1: these businesses in the current time period well Basically installed an arcade machine in your house and all the quarters get teleported to their house and you actually paid to put the Machine there.

898
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:20,990
Speaker 1: it's like you pay them to install a. would you pay to have someone and put a laundry machine in your basement that you had to put quarters into and the Them if the laundry machine was half price again, that's fine.

899
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,319
Speaker 0: Here's where it bothers me the.

900
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:26,030
Speaker 0: we want to make money when people use it not just when they buy it.

901
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:32,400
Speaker 0: It's very close to where you want to make money when someone resells our book game movie Whatever not just when they buy it the first time.

902
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:35,169
Speaker 0: the erosion of first sale rights Well, that's you know.

903
00:57:35,210 --> 00:57:43,867
Speaker 0: It'll know they're part and parcel because this statement and what they're doing It's the fact that I could buy a washing machine for a half price, but then the quarters go.

904
00:57:43,947 --> 00:57:44,630
Speaker 0: that's fine.

905
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:49,516
Speaker 1: The problem lies if you sell that washing machine to me the quarters still go to that.

906
00:57:49,556 --> 00:58:01,719
Speaker 0: first problem lies if I Cannot modify the machine to keep the quarters once I own hardware I think I have a unilateral right to whatever the fuck I want with it.

907
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously barring things like if I beat someone over the head with the Kindle until they die.

908
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,573
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, it wouldn't be illegal to hack your Kindle to remove.

909
00:58:09,593 --> 00:58:11,920
Speaker 0: Yes, so it once we so what?

910
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,846
Speaker 0: TPA the Likes the.

911
00:58:18,107 --> 00:58:30,912
Speaker 0: there has always been this huge push by large Industry to get it to the point where it they'd actually largely would like it to be a crime for you to circumvent Hardware restrictions and hardware you own for personal yet

912
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:33,140
Speaker 1: to keep the quarters that are in your laundry machine.

913
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:43,366
Speaker 0: So if I buy the Kindle with ads on it and I hack it to where the ads aren't there anymore Could that be a crime now?

914
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:47,338
Speaker 0: and more importantly would Amazon ever lobby to make that a crime?

915
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:57,094
Speaker 0: because There is that there is a perverse incentive to criminalize the use of your own hardware If the company has a vested interest in making money from the software running on the hardware.

916
00:58:57,616 --> 00:58:58,920
Speaker 0: That is what I'm worried about.

917
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:05,313
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I think the real thing is that you know Even if they don't want to make it a crime, it's what I said before.

918
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:09,359
Speaker 1: is the situation where okay Look people are reselling things, right?

919
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:19,860
Speaker 1: But if we make money from people using the thing Then it doesn't matter if they we don't get any money on the resale in forms of a new sale Because the quarters still go to us.

920
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,620
Speaker 1: So if you we sell you a washing machine for half price we get all the quarters teleported.

921
00:59:23,721 --> 00:59:24,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if

922
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:35,843
Speaker 1: I buy the why you sell the washing machine to me, right now Normally, they would be pissed like because they didn't get another washing machine sale, you know They could have sold two washing machines a new one to you and a new one to me and they wanted you to throw that One out.

923
00:59:36,226 --> 00:59:38,080
Speaker 1: but because you sold it to me they lost a sale.

924
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,251
Speaker 1: But now they've got two houses teleporting quarters to them.

925
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:44,100
Speaker 1: so but that's that's how they still make money.

926
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:44,682
Speaker 1: That's fine.

927
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:49,499
Speaker 0: If I can just open up the machine and have the quarters bender back out on a string

928
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:52,709
Speaker 1: As soon as they criminalize the bender

929
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:53,131
Speaker 0: string

930
00:59:53,291 --> 00:59:53,512
Speaker 1: well

931
00:59:53,653 --> 00:59:58,759
Speaker 0: in my it's like if I bought a payphone And then it was a crime for me to take the quarters out of my own payphone,

932
00:59:58,839 --> 00:59:59,000
Speaker 1: right?

933
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,304
Speaker 1: But here's the other situation.

934
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,174
Speaker 1: right right now at least, you know hardware.

935
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:10,260
Speaker 1: when people sell you hardware You do own the hardware, but for example the laundry machines in my building take quarters.

936
01:00:10,823 --> 01:00:12,773
Speaker 1: Do you think those quarters go to my landlord?

937
01:00:12,793 --> 01:00:14,000
Speaker 1: I don't think they do.

938
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,688
Speaker 1: I think they go to some service company.

939
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:17,637
Speaker 1: He's got like a contract with that's fine.

940
01:00:17,758 --> 01:00:18,180
Speaker 1: That's right.

941
01:00:18,441 --> 01:00:19,427
Speaker 1: But it's like these.

942
01:00:19,508 --> 01:00:24,533
Speaker 1: hardware that's in his building but some other guy owns and operates it.

943
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:31,897
Speaker 1: and soon what you're gonna see is You know if we sort of win the battle of owner decides it's gonna be the.

944
01:00:32,057 --> 01:00:39,680
Speaker 1: it's gonna be like, okay We don't even own your fucking Kindle it's oh it's owned and operated by us is just in your house.

945
01:00:39,742 --> 01:00:40,562
Speaker 0: Yes Now that is.

946
01:00:40,623 --> 01:00:42,670
Speaker 0: that is where again where the perverse incentive comes in.

947
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:46,123
Speaker 0: if I can just cut that tether and get it and hack It to make it work.

948
01:00:46,786 --> 01:00:47,610
Speaker 0: That should be okay.

949
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,740
Speaker 0: And if that's not okay, that's not okay.

950
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:58,760
Speaker 1: Well this Cory doctor actually had a pretty Recent speech about this talk he gave and what he talked about was how we keep fighting for basically the rights of the owner.

951
01:00:58,861 --> 01:00:59,997
Speaker 1: Right, it's sort of obvious to us.

952
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:03,986
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoever owns hardware Decides how it works right.

953
01:01:04,026 --> 01:01:04,930
Speaker 1: and he talks about how like.

954
01:01:05,171 --> 01:01:07,160
Speaker 1: well the company owns the computer at work.

955
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:09,253
Speaker 1: So they decide what goes on the computer at work.

956
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,320
Speaker 1: We'll lock that shit down, right?

957
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,545
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he talks about.

958
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:13,800
Speaker 0: so what about when someone else owns the hardware, right?

959
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:16,887
Speaker 1: He talked he basically talked about like well What if we got what we wanted?

960
01:01:17,189 --> 01:01:19,040
Speaker 1: then what so if we got what we wanted?

961
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,768
Speaker 1: He's basically says we need rights of the user.

962
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,379
Speaker 1: Even if the user doesn't own the hardware know what we need.

963
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:29,600
Speaker 1: Well, that's nobody's buddy something much simpler than he says he doesn't know how you know.

964
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:33,175
Speaker 1: The solution to that would be he just shows all the problems that would happen.

965
01:01:33,195 --> 01:01:34,380
Speaker 0: I think it's actually pretty simple.

966
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,126
Speaker 1: We got we wanted need.

967
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,170
Speaker 0: there are two examples.

968
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:37,531
Speaker 0: one.

969
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:40,180
Speaker 0: We have the nominal right of first sale.

970
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:42,555
Speaker 0: I think that needs to be expanded but you don't owe it.

971
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:57,435
Speaker 0: I can't resell Expanded such that if someone sells me a physical thing in certain circumstances Whatever regardless of any license they have if it is not a lease if it is a purchase There's got to be a way where I can find those.

972
01:01:57,495 --> 01:01:58,660
Speaker 1: I start leasing technology.

973
01:01:58,660 --> 01:01:58,961
Speaker 1: They won't.

974
01:01:59,102 --> 01:02:01,191
Speaker 1: your cell phone company will just start leasing the phones out.

975
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:03,080
Speaker 1: There's loopholes all over the place.

976
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,189
Speaker 1: So you always do to me when I come with an idea?

977
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:07,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now you're leasing your cell phone.

978
01:02:07,701 --> 01:02:08,266
Speaker 1: You can't buy it.

979
01:02:08,306 --> 01:02:09,839
Speaker 1: They don't offer to sales of cell phones.

980
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:13,750
Speaker 0: So you could expand that further by having you could.

981
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:20,694
Speaker 0: you could try to argue that those lease contracts because there's no other option Are there for one-sided which are already not?

982
01:02:20,735 --> 01:02:20,996
Speaker 0: Okay.

983
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:21,839
Speaker 1: How you gonna write this law?

984
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,895
Speaker 0: But Scott the problem is with any reform is you can't make any laws in the u.s.

985
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:27,478
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter.

986
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:29,907
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, we talked about that for a while.

987
01:02:30,609 --> 01:02:31,653
Speaker 1: Do we want to talk about anything else?

988
01:02:31,693 --> 01:02:33,660
Speaker 0: Do one more really quick two quickies.

989
01:02:34,403 --> 01:02:42,460
Speaker 0: so ie 10, of course, you know, there's that whole thing about the do not track bit, which I Feel like that sort of bit was a non-starter.

990
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,879
Speaker 1: well it's because nobody who is doing tracking wants to not track and basically this this method requires them to.

991
01:02:49,643 --> 01:03:00,720
Speaker 0: Well the method if there were the thing is Theoretically not following it if it was well known and well communicated could constitute a breach of other rules.

992
01:03:01,042 --> 01:03:03,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, they would need a law to force companies to do this.

993
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:10,098
Speaker 0: But anyway, I want to talk about the hissy fit that happened when Microsoft did what I think is the good thing and said You know what?

994
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:13,833
Speaker 0: We're gonna enable the do not track bit by default and the writing Microsoft do this.

995
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:16,307
Speaker 1: people are thinking why would Microsoft do a good Thing?

996
01:03:16,348 --> 01:03:19,590
Speaker 1: it's obvious Microsoft is the one the browser owner.

997
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,140
Speaker 1: that isn't an advertising company, right?

998
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they want, you know, they don't want Google to make money by tracking.

999
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:29,296
Speaker 1: They want that stuff off by default, you know to be better for them.

1000
01:03:29,356 --> 01:03:30,180
Speaker 1: It's it's helping them.

1001
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,674
Speaker 1: That's why they do not doing it because they're you know, not you can argue it was.

1002
01:03:34,734 --> 01:03:36,640
Speaker 0: it was a pseudo false flag operation.

1003
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,259
Speaker 0: You can argue that they didn't want it to happen.

1004
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:44,884
Speaker 0: So they did this knowing that everybody else would throw a hissy fit and the format would maybe the standard with us being validated Defecto.

1005
01:03:44,944 --> 01:03:45,326
Speaker 1: that's true.

1006
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:47,840
Speaker 1: The other thing is you say why doesn't Mozilla do this, right?

1007
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,984
Speaker 1: Cuz they Mozilla doesn't.

1008
01:03:49,024 --> 01:03:56,493
Speaker 0: so the argument why no one did it is that if it is opt-out of Tracking as opposed to opt-in the behavior is very different.

1009
01:03:56,814 --> 01:04:08,759
Speaker 0: if it is opt-out of tracking Then the majority of people won't bother to opt-out and no one goes to the options Yes, and check box, but if you set it to opt-in then nobody's gonna say yes track me, right?

1010
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:16,020
Speaker 0: So that everyone evil and everyone who's just greedy Needs it to be no opt-out.

1011
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:23,259
Speaker 1: But I'm saying is that the reason Microsoft did it is because they don't make money from advertising so this can make them look Good, you know to disable it by default.

1012
01:04:23,299 --> 01:04:28,400
Speaker 1: now Why doesn't Mozilla who is open source and awesome got their argument Mozilla's argument?

1013
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:33,350
Speaker 0: And everyone's argument was that if it's opt-out No, Mozilla doesn't care about.

1014
01:04:33,772 --> 01:04:35,620
Speaker 1: you know, Mozilla doesn't want people to be tracked.

1015
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:46,231
Speaker 1: I know the reason that they left it as opt-out of tracking instead of opt-in to tracking like Microsoft did is because number one open the open-source Mozilla type.

1016
01:04:46,251 --> 01:04:49,420
Speaker 1: people are obsessive about standards and adhering to them.

1017
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:57,466
Speaker 0: I don't do it and I was gonna say a lot of Mozilla's moneys come from Google but also the standard.

1018
01:04:57,847 --> 01:05:09,320
Speaker 0: everyone argued that if any major browser made it to where it was on by default that everyone would ignore it and They might have justification in doing so and it would make it thus useless.

1019
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,107
Speaker 0: It would be about as effective as what.

1020
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:14,560
Speaker 0: the comparison everyone makes is that it would just be the opposite of the evil bit.

1021
01:05:15,163 --> 01:05:16,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know about the evil bit.

1022
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:18,497
Speaker 0: That's like if you go read that RFC.

1023
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:20,386
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like it's really.

1024
01:05:20,427 --> 01:05:21,734
Speaker 1: the whole idea was kind of dumb.

1025
01:05:21,774 --> 01:05:29,713
Speaker 1: I mean the idea is basically Alright everyone, we're gonna leave our bikes in the street unlocked But nobody's allowed to not steal bit that we gonna put it any.

1026
01:05:29,894 --> 01:05:31,620
Speaker 1: anyone who puts a little sticker on their bike.

1027
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,508
Speaker 1: This is do not steal.

1028
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:33,820
Speaker 1: You're not allowed to steal those ones.

1029
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,394
Speaker 0: You know, what'd be interesting if we did that?

1030
01:05:35,455 --> 01:05:38,860
Speaker 0: it's like by If you stole a bike that had that sticker.

1031
01:05:39,362 --> 01:05:40,770
Speaker 0: Felony life sentence.

1032
01:05:40,911 --> 01:05:41,976
Speaker 0: right bike doesn't have a sticker.

1033
01:05:41,976 --> 01:05:43,242
Speaker 0: $10 fine Of course.

1034
01:05:43,342 --> 01:05:51,992
Speaker 1: Microsoft the company that makes their money selling new bikes and not stolen bikes is like or stealing bikes is like yeah Free do not steal stickers on all our bikes.

1035
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,700
Speaker 1: You don't have to buy the do not steal sticker.

1036
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:56,380
Speaker 0: So anyway there this issue or even apply it yourself.

1037
01:05:56,803 --> 01:06:06,939
Speaker 0: I want to talk about how the guy Who I think wrote the standard for do not track is Super pissed and through a hissy fit that Microsoft said it to be enabled by default.

1038
01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:13,274
Speaker 1: and I Looked he probably loves tracking and was just trying to sort of be nice.

1039
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:14,619
Speaker 1: but still they you know.

1040
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:18,100
Speaker 1: So he was probably thinking hey, you know tracking is totally awesome.

1041
01:06:18,181 --> 01:06:22,680
Speaker 1: I make mad money on this but you know There's obviously some people who really want to turn it off.

1042
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,880
Speaker 1: I can look like a really good guy if I let them opt out and the people who are blocking ever all the ads anyway.

1043
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:27,486
Speaker 0: So he put it.

1044
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:29,040
Speaker 0: he submitted a patch to Apache.

1045
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:38,860
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the actual text of the patch right here and the first thing in it is a comment that says Deal with user user agents that deliberately violate open standards, right?

1046
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:39,624
Speaker 0: And then he's like.

1047
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:44,079
Speaker 1: that makes it sound like maybe he's one of those standards nuts Which is you must follow the standard no matter what it is.

1048
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:53,231
Speaker 0: And then it's like if it's ie 10 bad do not track unset do not track Yeah, so basically track everyone with ie 10 whether they want.

1049
01:06:53,251 --> 01:06:56,598
Speaker 0: the comments on this patch are That's.

1050
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,026
Speaker 0: There's a funny image in the comments.

1051
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:02,334
Speaker 0: you just go look at the comments and look at the image there.

1052
01:07:02,354 --> 01:07:03,057
Speaker 0: it's pretty good.

1053
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,991
Speaker 1: whatever It's a dumb idea.

1054
01:07:05,031 --> 01:07:09,171
Speaker 1: They should just Frickin, you know have an ad block for the tracking.

1055
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:10,636
Speaker 1: that you know, that's the best method.

1056
01:07:10,676 --> 01:07:11,680
Speaker 0: is that's what I was gonna say.

1057
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:13,070
Speaker 0: It's you know get standards.

1058
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:18,112
Speaker 0: The real answer is The internet is in for well the web not the internet.

1059
01:07:18,152 --> 01:07:19,116
Speaker 0: the web is.

1060
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:23,115
Speaker 0: you seek out information It's given to you in an abstract format and you format it and display it.

1061
01:07:23,136 --> 01:07:28,383
Speaker 0: However, you like So I just don't display things I don't want to see it I don't give out information I don't want to.

1062
01:07:28,443 --> 01:07:31,420
Speaker 1: yeah, I send some bits to a web web server.

1063
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:35,320
Speaker 1: It sends me back some bits and then I can do whatever I want with those bits.

1064
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:38,126
Speaker 0: It just so happens that no no But Ted Turner says you're stealing.

1065
01:07:38,146 --> 01:07:44,440
Speaker 1: if you do that web browsers will will are Programmed to do certain things with those bits by default.

1066
01:07:44,902 --> 01:07:48,559
Speaker 1: So we just have to modify the web browsers to do the things with the bits they get.

1067
01:07:49,266 --> 01:07:50,619
Speaker 1: Be what we want them to do with them.

1068
01:07:51,021 --> 01:07:55,500
Speaker 1: The user wants to do with them and not what the person who sends you the bits wants you to do with them.

1069
01:07:56,163 --> 01:08:07,740
Speaker 1: You know if I it's like the New York Times is like sending you newspaper and forcing you You know to read it one page at a time because they it's like no no No, I you send me the pile of paper and I decide I'm only gonna read the sports section.

1070
01:08:08,582 --> 01:08:10,439
Speaker 1: You can't make me do anything else.

1071
01:08:10,641 --> 01:08:14,688
Speaker 0: So I feel like we're blowing a big load here because we you know There's not a lot of geek nights around this season.

1072
01:08:14,709 --> 01:08:16,979
Speaker 0: I got one more that I just found really fascinating.

1073
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:17,866
Speaker 0: I was tweeting about it.

1074
01:08:17,947 --> 01:08:18,470
Speaker 0: This is bad.

1075
01:08:18,491 --> 01:08:19,800
Speaker 0: away from technology into science.

1076
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:22,979
Speaker 0: So there's a study in psychological science.

1077
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:30,698
Speaker 0: It was a reason like a university study and it's pretty solid in terms of the methodology as far as I can tell Based on reading other people's commentary of it.

1078
01:08:31,343 --> 01:08:48,036
Speaker 0: basically, they were looking for correlations between Certain sorts of conspiracy theories and other kinds of ideologies to see like if there are clusters of crazy It's like, you know, I'm sure that like they could find Bigfoot people probably also believe in chupacabras, right?

1079
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:48,237
Speaker 0: Yep.

1080
01:08:48,317 --> 01:08:49,120
Speaker 0: What was the South Park?

1081
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,935
Speaker 0: They're like if you believe in Bigfoot You're either evil or stupid.

1082
01:08:53,318 --> 01:09:00,740
Speaker 0: Yeah But basically they found a really strong and interesting correlation that I think is worth noting.

1083
01:09:01,282 --> 01:09:03,247
Speaker 0: So people who what's the exact word?

1084
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:07,640
Speaker 0: people who believe in a quote free market?

1085
01:09:07,861 --> 01:09:24,800
Speaker 0: ideology, okay are very much more likely statistically to deny the relationship between HIV and AIDS to deny that there is Climate change and that humans may be causing it and to deny that smoking is correlated with lung cancer.

1086
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:29,160
Speaker 0: Okay But specifically that's the thing free market ideology.

1087
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:30,827
Speaker 1: Are these people who said that?

1088
01:09:30,846 --> 01:09:33,499
Speaker 1: did they check to see what the people's ideologies were and then?

1089
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:35,265
Speaker 1: Categorize them as free market.

1090
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:36,490
Speaker 0: No, they asked direct question.

1091
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:38,417
Speaker 1: Do you believe in a free market ideology?

1092
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:39,100
Speaker 0: direct questions?

1093
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:42,325
Speaker 0: They asked about things like what you know Is it was?

1094
01:09:42,406 --> 01:09:45,819
Speaker 0: is the story on Princess Diana's death plausible or was she assessed?

1095
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,787
Speaker 1: Specifically the free market?

1096
01:09:47,908 --> 01:09:51,100
Speaker 1: one right because you could ask someone like no they Do.

1097
01:09:51,180 --> 01:10:00,749
Speaker 1: you is do you believe in you know free market idea that that's actually different than checking to see No What the person's actual ideology course is?

1098
01:10:00,769 --> 01:10:06,735
Speaker 0: look at all the studies that show that the majority of Americans are Super for every piece of Obamacare, but against Obamacare.

1099
01:10:06,775 --> 01:10:07,800
Speaker 0: the title exactly?

1100
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:08,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, no This is.

1101
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:26,676
Speaker 0: people who say they believe in a free market ideology also say they believe in all this crazy bullshit Mm-hmm, and I found that fascinating that the statistical correlation with those things was less than for example People who don't believe in the moon landing or other craziness believing in similar crazy things.

1102
01:10:27,017 --> 01:10:35,118
Speaker 1: So conspiracy people This is not really a revelation that crazy someone who's crazy is likely to be crazy.

1103
01:10:35,966 --> 01:10:37,103
Speaker 0: No But here's the thing.

1104
01:10:37,244 --> 01:10:42,463
Speaker 0: and then people who are crazy in certain ways are pigeonholed in just those ways like the guy Who is.

1105
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:48,000
Speaker 0: you know, Princess Diana was assassinated is not also lizard people or HIV AIDS.

1106
01:10:48,402 --> 01:10:56,194
Speaker 1: But the guys also know that guy is probably mostly focusing on political Conspiracies like JFK who shot him and all that kind of stuff.

1107
01:10:56,294 --> 01:10:57,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not focusing on Bigfoot.

1108
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:58,865
Speaker 0: He doesn't believe in Bigfoot.

1109
01:10:58,885 --> 01:10:59,488
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell.

1110
01:10:59,528 --> 01:11:00,855
Speaker 1: he believes in government conspiracy.

1111
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:08,272
Speaker 0: from these abstracts one of the strongest correlations between Anti-science was with people who are free market ideologists and not anything else.

1112
01:11:08,573 --> 01:11:18,727
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm The primary driver of believing in a scientific theory is Little more than consensus among scientists.

1113
01:11:19,248 --> 01:11:19,589
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1114
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:20,994
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

1115
01:11:21,034 --> 01:11:21,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, which that's?

1116
01:11:22,037 --> 01:11:23,040
Speaker 0: yeah, that's the best I can do.

1117
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:23,523
Speaker 0: That's me.

1118
01:11:23,543 --> 01:11:24,230
Speaker 1: What do you want me to do?

1119
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:25,380
Speaker 1: research all the things myself?

1120
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I can't even read one paper and understand what it's saying.

1121
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,628
Speaker 0: Read this full paper, but I can read these abstracts.

1122
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know, I can.

1123
01:11:34,956 --> 01:11:36,080
Speaker 1: you know, I can whatever.

1124
01:11:36,502 --> 01:11:37,546
Speaker 0: I just found it really interesting.

1125
01:11:38,208 --> 01:11:39,192
Speaker 0: So yeah, geek nights.
