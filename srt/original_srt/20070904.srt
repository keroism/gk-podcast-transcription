1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,666
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday September 4th.

2
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:12,629
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,533
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight death.

4
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:36,950
Speaker 0: Let's do this Alright, so I've been trying to find a video game podcast other than Dave and Joel which doesn't really count as a video game podcast.

5
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:41,509
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess they review video games, but they don't tell me what games are coming out or anything like that.

6
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:47,032
Speaker 0: So I guess the one that I tried most recently was the one that goes along with that Magazine.

7
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:51,470
Speaker 0: we got for free the EGM whatever, but that's a terrible magazine.

8
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:56,810
Speaker 0: It was a terrible magazine in the podcast also kind of terrible and probably not gonna listen any more of it great.

9
00:00:57,372 --> 00:01:02,109
Speaker 0: But the one episode that I just happened to listen to is my trying out episode the most recent one.

10
00:01:03,073 --> 00:01:07,289
Speaker 0: they talked to this guy who made this new ps3 game called lair

11
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:07,369
Speaker 1: and

12
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:22,392
Speaker 0: Basically the reviewer who did the review I guess in the magazine Chatted with the guy who made the game and was like yeah This is why your game sucks, and the guy was like nah You're just seeing it that way cuz you're hardcore and my game is not for the hardcore Blah-blah-blah.

13
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:37,380
Speaker 0: and they argued about how I guess the game forces you to use the six axis business, but it's the control is fucked up and The game is you know nonlinear, but at the same time It's hard to actually figure out what the hell's going on.

14
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:41,259
Speaker 0: sometimes the game just fucks you and and whatever I never played the game.

15
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:42,530
Speaker 0: I'm probably never going to play the game.

16
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,498
Speaker 0: The point is I got two things.

17
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:49,750
Speaker 0: number one most of this guy's argument was that you're so hardcore.

18
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:51,216
Speaker 0: That's why the game doesn't work for you.

19
00:01:51,257 --> 00:01:56,221
Speaker 0: the game works for the non hardcore, and I'm like dude It's a ps3 only game.

20
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,387
Speaker 0: What the fuck were you thinking?

21
00:01:57,568 --> 00:01:57,709
Speaker 0: yeah?

22
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,062
Speaker 0: You made a game supposedly for the non hardcore on the ps3 only are you.

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,205
Speaker 0: what are you thinking?

24
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:05,609
Speaker 0: That's just not gonna happen.

25
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:09,590
Speaker 0: There's no one who has a ps3 who is an ultra hardcore.

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,862
Speaker 0: So if you put a game out for the ps3 that's for the non hardcore.

27
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:17,464
Speaker 0: everyone's either gonna buy and hate it or Not buy it.

28
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:19,853
Speaker 1: I'm with you there.

29
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:25,047
Speaker 0: What's number two number two is that people freaking with these review scores.

30
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:33,830
Speaker 1: I gotta say it again You know back in the day PC gamer had the only good review system ever because they gave bad ratings to a lot of games.

31
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:40,375
Speaker 0: I mean supposedly this is a bad game and the guy gave it like a four and a half or a five or something which He said is average.

32
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:45,530
Speaker 0: I'm like sounds to me like you're saying this game was bad, but yet you gave it an average.

33
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:53,881
Speaker 1: He's going on an absolute scale where a two or a three would be like Custer's revenge And maybe a one would be that one with the witch.

34
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,735
Speaker 0: all right, but the way he describes this game It's at least three not five.

35
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,160
Speaker 1: I don't know.

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,541
Speaker 1: you know

37
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:09,081
Speaker 0: and also people who make games and people I guess who care about video game magazines and people who work at video game magazines take these scores away, too Seriously, well,

38
00:03:09,162 --> 00:03:23,869
Speaker 1: I think part of it it's just that in the video game industry the video game press is almost complete bullshit and I Don't really have a lot of respect for people who pay those ratings a lot of credence because they're usually super inflated And they're really not that useful.

39
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:29,467
Speaker 0: Yeah And I guess like they it seems like there's some false belief that the ratings have something to like.

40
00:03:29,528 --> 00:03:33,410
Speaker 0: if you get a good Ratings on your game that somehow translates into like big sales.

41
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:34,457
Speaker 0: You know what people.

42
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,081
Speaker 0: that's bullshit.

43
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:43,887
Speaker 0: if Halo 1 got say I don't know Fives instead of tens it would have sold just as many if Halo 3 gets all ones from every magazine.

44
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:46,289
Speaker 0: guess what a bajillion People are still gonna buy.

45
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,376
Speaker 1: I mean among gamers.

46
00:03:48,757 --> 00:03:53,610
Speaker 1: I think the actual primary factor in selling a game is word-of-mouth, but not any other factor.

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,090
Speaker 1: I think that is the primary thing that sells games to gamers.

48
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,099
Speaker 0: Yeah but Websites are chatting up a game for good or bad.

49
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:07,470
Speaker 1: you can't forget that a lot of the people who buy games are not gamers They're mommies buying games for in which case they're not looking at a video game magazine at all.

50
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,996
Speaker 0: They go to the store and look at the shelf.

51
00:04:09,176 --> 00:04:12,650
Speaker 1: Oh, so I guess the video game press is just complete crap.

52
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:18,572
Speaker 0: Well, at least the reviewing in the scoring and such Part of its non-crab The letting.

53
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:22,306
Speaker 1: you know what games are coming out, but I can find that out from press releases and blogs.

54
00:04:22,366 --> 00:04:22,708
Speaker 1: That's all.

55
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,310
Speaker 0: that's press.

56
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:26,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, but people write articles about it and the articles don't.

57
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,770
Speaker 1: they just say more things like the games going to come out on next day.

58
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,649
Speaker 1: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

59
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can cut out those blahs.

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,429
Speaker 0: I just need game is coming out a next day.

61
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:48,270
Speaker 1: It is kind of interesting that to me the only people I trust at all when it comes to camera views are Penny arcade and to a much lesser extent Dave and Joel.

62
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:51,589
Speaker 0: I think what it what it is is you need reviews.

63
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:57,530
Speaker 0: Reviews are a lot more useful with something like like movies because there's a lot fewer of them, right?

64
00:04:58,012 --> 00:05:01,725
Speaker 0: And you know, you're gonna go to the movie theater and you gotta like sort of pick which one.

65
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:05,805
Speaker 1: even that I ignore reviews and I go on word-of-mouth if all my friends say movies terrible.

66
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:06,550
Speaker 1: I wait for Netflix.

67
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but it is slightly more useful.

68
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,152
Speaker 0: but with video games, I think it's not useful because you have like a bajillion games out there and You're only.

69
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:18,620
Speaker 0: you know, it's not like you're gonna buy a video game.

70
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:21,970
Speaker 0: which one it's like I'm gonna buy Metroid.

71
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:24,450
Speaker 0: It's like once you know about the game you buy it.

72
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,177
Speaker 0: You don't need like this reviews to tell you which ones are what you know Which ones are what.

73
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:32,201
Speaker 0: if you're in it and if you're not in it You're going to the store and looking at the covers and picking one out.

74
00:05:32,322 --> 00:05:35,033
Speaker 0: So the reviews not so useful I don't know.

75
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:48,090
Speaker 1: I could see reviews having been useful back in the day when well, maybe just like more mainstream money You know like a magazine review or a big company doing a review because back then The internet wasn't quite what it is now and that was the only way to find out about a new game.

76
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:49,421
Speaker 1: But now it's just.

77
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,435
Speaker 0: it's not necessary Especially the score.

78
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:55,209
Speaker 1: I think it'd be a lot better if reviews were just you know.

79
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,503
Speaker 1: But whoever's writing the review saying here are my thoughts on this game.

80
00:05:58,965 --> 00:05:59,467
Speaker 1: I like this.

81
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,150
Speaker 1: I didn't like this.

82
00:06:00,251 --> 00:06:01,890
Speaker 1: I think this part won't appeal to you people.

83
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,630
Speaker 1: I think this part will appeal to you kind of people and not bother with the score at the end.

84
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:21,969
Speaker 0: I mean, what if we did that in anime like yeah, I give cowboy bebop a nine point seven out of ten point one Whatever Right, yeah Mostly I just want to say the guys doofus cuz he's like yeah the games for the non hardcore on the ps3.

85
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,810
Speaker 1: Oh, I think that's the part that really needs to be brought out into the open.

86
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:30,390
Speaker 0: I think also and I think it was a funny coincidence that I listened to one episode of a bad podcast.

87
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:32,945
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't the worst podcast, but I'm not listening.

88
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:38,650
Speaker 0: We know what the worst The penny arcade happened to be about the same thing as the the episode.

89
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,064
Speaker 1: Well, it helped that they could make a pretty good joke based on the title of the game.

90
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did help.

91
00:06:44,809 --> 00:06:46,425
Speaker 1: indeed I'll admit I loathe.

92
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,031
Speaker 0: Yeah Right.

93
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:52,626
Speaker 1: So basically all I've been doing for the last week is playing natural selection as much as I can.

94
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:53,850
Speaker 0: way to go.

95
00:06:54,353 --> 00:07:00,850
Speaker 1: I just now that I got a gaming PC again I think like oh I should play all these like you're playing this game that your old PC could have played.

96
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I didn't.

97
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,619
Speaker 1: my old PC had other problems.

98
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:04,803
Speaker 1: Remember the video card was dead.

99
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:11,006
Speaker 0: I know your old busted TNT - yeah But that doesn't matter left TNC - could play now just like barely it could play half-life one.

100
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:11,408
Speaker 0: just fine.

101
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:13,416
Speaker 1: barely The thing was.

102
00:07:13,436 --> 00:07:17,796
Speaker 1: I just like I got new games now, I got Bioshock I got a play that you didn't.

103
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:18,821
Speaker 0: you didn't buy the whole game.

104
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:19,605
Speaker 1: Did you I bought it?

105
00:07:19,827 --> 00:07:20,872
Speaker 0: Oh you the whole game It was.

106
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:21,916
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play it.

107
00:07:22,036 --> 00:07:22,659
Speaker 1: I really like it.

108
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:25,230
Speaker 0: All right, the thing is I might buy it then.

109
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:29,530
Speaker 1: I haven't played it yet because I just keep playing every time.

110
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,771
Speaker 1: It's like I have this process a cue where my brain will cycle through when I sit down from the gear and I think all Right.

111
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:45,307
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play a video game on my computer and my brain goes Alright, you're gonna play tribes - when I say brain tribes - is not playable anymore.

112
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:46,490
Speaker 1: I'm sorry and it goes shit.

113
00:07:46,711 --> 00:07:47,374
Speaker 1: I gotta ask.

114
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:48,278
Speaker 1: All right, fine.

115
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:52,759
Speaker 1: You're gonna play natural selection, right and I go Yeah, and I never get to any other games.

116
00:07:53,201 --> 00:07:55,350
Speaker 0: So I forced myself to put the games in a queue.

117
00:07:55,541 --> 00:08:13,550
Speaker 0: I mean I just beat paper Mario and now I'm playing the Metroid Prime the new one on the Wii and then I'm probably when that's done I'll either do the Bioshock or the system shock - and I don't know what order and then but the thing is When the orange box comes out everything else is getting pushed aside.

118
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,279
Speaker 1: I'm taking the day off work.

119
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:17,692
Speaker 1: when Team Fortress 2 comes out I'm just.

120
00:08:17,752 --> 00:08:18,053
Speaker 0: it goes like.

121
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:19,922
Speaker 0: I also got to play half-life 2 episode 2.

122
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:21,590
Speaker 1: You know what I get enough vacation days.

123
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,536
Speaker 1: I'll take the week off.

124
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:27,720
Speaker 1: I'll just as soon as the game comes out I'll spend the next seven days becoming the god of it.

125
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,890
Speaker 0: Maybe but yeah, but you know.

126
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:39,070
Speaker 0: So I got my games all lined up in a row, you know And there's like a space for you know Hourglass and the DS games can go in an edition because I play them on the train.

127
00:08:39,371 --> 00:08:41,283
Speaker 1: See I had that and I was cool with that.

128
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:43,894
Speaker 1: But now I have a problem one.

129
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:53,973
Speaker 1: it's really more related to Monday nights, but Kind of to prove that they're worthless and also kind of because my company doesn't seem to understand that they're not Terribly useful.

130
00:08:53,993 --> 00:09:04,987
Speaker 1: I'm getting all the Cisco search like I'm just gonna get them all and I'm signed up for all the tests and everything, but I got a look over Cisco iOS on the train and I bought a portable DVD player.

131
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:09,340
Speaker 1: So I spent today watching mutiny on the bounty from 1935 instead of reading anything.

132
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:10,846
Speaker 0: All right way to go for you.

133
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:13,919
Speaker 1: I haven't even beaten Pokemon and I don't think I will for another year now.

134
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:15,659
Speaker 0: Oh, you still didn't beat that?

135
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,604
Speaker 1: No, I just stopped trying.

136
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:18,587
Speaker 1: I've been doing other stuff.

137
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:19,350
Speaker 1: I feel bad.

138
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,015
Speaker 1: I never even beat the second Phoenix, right?

139
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:21,757
Speaker 1: I just stopped.

140
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,198
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, oh well.

141
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:27,539
Speaker 0: So what's in the video game news here?

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:37,573
Speaker 1: Well, it turns out that on the 12th anniversary of one of the more revolutionary games in PC gaming We can now get that game for free in its original form.

143
00:09:37,613 --> 00:09:39,680
Speaker 1: That game is in fact command and conquer.

144
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,476
Speaker 0: Well, it's command and conquer gold, which is the slightly improved version of the original command whatever.

145
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:50,052
Speaker 1: Yeah one Walleye, I'm not good at that game and I'm not good at any RTS.

146
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,722
Speaker 1: Well, I don't really like RTS is to be honest I like.

147
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:53,948
Speaker 0: the thing is I like them.

148
00:09:54,008 --> 00:09:57,626
Speaker 0: I just suck so badly at them and also Some of them.

149
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:58,029
Speaker 0: I don't.

150
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,553
Speaker 0: it's sort of like.

151
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:00,223
Speaker 0: I like some parts But I don't like others.

152
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:06,040
Speaker 0: like I like the idea of build a bunch of stuff get a bunch of upgrades Select units send them out to do stuff.

153
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:11,853
Speaker 0: But I don't like is the fact that it boils down to more Fast clicking and knowing the order to build stuff.

154
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:13,239
Speaker 0: then it boils down to strategy.

155
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:19,245
Speaker 1: for me it's just that I was never good at the games partly because it did just boil down to the fast clicking and knowing exactly what to do.

156
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,224
Speaker 1: and I wanted to do complex.

157
00:10:21,244 --> 00:10:28,180
Speaker 1: I remember when I first played the game multiplayer with other people over my Nullmodem cable and then with my modem dialing into their phone.

158
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:35,220
Speaker 1: We'd set it up and we'd play and I'd be like, alright So I'd make a group of tanks and infantry and I'd put them in one group like to the side.

159
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:40,820
Speaker 1: Then I make another group like grenadiers and something else and I try to like set an ambush and have like a pincher attack.

160
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:46,199
Speaker 1: And while I'm setting all this up, my friend just made a bunch of tanks and clicked on my base.

161
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,745
Speaker 1: Yep, and that wasn't fun.

162
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:53,460
Speaker 1: And also why won't the infantry just kind of sidestep my harvester?

163
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,099
Speaker 1: Why do they just sit there and get crushed?

164
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,343
Speaker 1: Pissed me off so much It did.

165
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:00,833
Speaker 0: it was pretty sucky except when you did it on purpose for funniness.

166
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,268
Speaker 0: or use your harvester to squish enemy inventory.

167
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,807
Speaker 1: so Back in the day.

168
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:20,479
Speaker 1: I was playing this game with a friend of mine named Ken He and we had with two computers in my house the Pentium Pro 200 and the 486 SX - they were connected via a serial null modem cable and We had command and conquer installed on both.

169
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:32,565
Speaker 1: Now the 486 had a problem with the mouse driver where About once a week the mouse would suddenly go bad shit and just fly around the four corners of the screen and freak out And you couldn't do anything.

170
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,620
Speaker 1: and if you hit any keys on the keyboard nothing happened and just chaos.

171
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,453
Speaker 1: But it only happened like once a week once a month.

172
00:11:38,473 --> 00:11:39,298
Speaker 1: So I kind of ignored it.

173
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:46,080
Speaker 1: So we're playing and the game's going on pretty well, you know command and conquer and suddenly commanding and the conquering.

174
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:51,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ken says what the fuck the mouse stopped working I can't play the fucking game.

175
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:53,394
Speaker 1: What the fuck's wrong with your computer rim.

176
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:58,158
Speaker 1: and without missing a beat I turn to him and say well, uh, I guess it's just conquer for you.

177
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:06,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, no, I like this game even though I'm terrible at it.

178
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, the single player is actually kind of fun, which is weird for a game.

179
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:09,839
Speaker 0: That should be an RTS.

180
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,020
Speaker 1: Well, it had that thing where you could play as the good guys or the bad guy.

181
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,404
Speaker 0: Well, I came with two CDs the good guys CD in the bad guys and they were kind of really different and it was super Fun.

182
00:12:19,444 --> 00:12:20,940
Speaker 0: I like it was like two games in one.

183
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,893
Speaker 1: I was better at the good guys, but I always wanted to be the bad guys.

184
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:25,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I guys had cooler stuff.

185
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:29,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think tie fighter did that to me because tie fighter was a much better game than x-wing.

186
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:29,922
Speaker 1: Yeah,

187
00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:43,880
Speaker 0: but the other thing about this version of command and conquerors They're basically giving you the original Iso's for the windows 95 version and then they give you this patch file and then they give you this Instructions document of how to make it work in Windows XP and it's not trivial, but you can do it.

188
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:51,815
Speaker 1: Yeah and also the download is really slow and we don't think the online play will work because if you Recall you had to do the Westwood whatever to make it work.

189
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,203
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know What kind of.

190
00:12:53,223 --> 00:12:55,958
Speaker 0: there's no internet play that's for sure, but there might be LAN play.

191
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:56,279
Speaker 0: Who knows.

192
00:12:56,581 --> 00:13:02,620
Speaker 1: Well, regardless if anything I have a 50-foot and all modem cable and Scott and I both have serial ports.

193
00:13:02,841 --> 00:13:03,566
Speaker 0: We'll see about that.

194
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,620
Speaker 1: That would be kind of awesome not?

195
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,381
Speaker 0: So?

196
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:11,459
Speaker 0: in other news, there are other free games available for the PC now.

197
00:13:12,462 --> 00:13:24,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, well not really free but Ubisoft or Ubisoft or her whatever you want to pronounce Ubisoft Ubisoft Ubisoft, whatever They they are putting some of their old crappy PC games.

198
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,809
Speaker 0: Well, not so much crappy but old PC older not so old.

199
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,351
Speaker 0: They get the Rayman Raving Ravids the Far Cry the original.

200
00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,000
Speaker 1: Wait a minute didn't that game just come out on the Wii or something?

201
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,867
Speaker 1: I think so, but How are they releasing it for free?

202
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:40,032
Speaker 0: It's on the PC.

203
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:43,532
Speaker 0: Oh the PC versions a different I guess different game with the same name.

204
00:13:44,176 --> 00:13:52,663
Speaker 0: Oh, okay I just ignore that the original Far Cry which is like three or four years old and that first the first 3d Prince of Persia For the PC.

205
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:53,929
Speaker 0: They're also giving that away for free.

206
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:59,638
Speaker 0: You know, I'll admit I never played any of those games Yeah, but I played the first Prince of Persia 3d.

207
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:02,280
Speaker 0: I played like two levels of it, but none none of the others.

208
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:12,479
Speaker 0: Anyway, you can get these games for free on file planet Which is sort of not free because using file planet is like Even if you wait in the line to get the gate to download for free.

209
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:14,771
Speaker 0: It's so painful that it's like spend.

210
00:14:14,811 --> 00:14:16,760
Speaker 0: it's as painful as like spending $50.

211
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:31,960
Speaker 1: There was only one game in the history of gaming that ever got me to use file planet and that was tribes - yep but Also in addition to these games being PC games being free to download and free to play they're loaded up with ads.

212
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:39,147
Speaker 0: Aha, so, uh, yeah, it's not such a bad business decision to say Hey, we've got these old games.

213
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:41,300
Speaker 0: We're not making any money off of them, right?

214
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,277
Speaker 0: We could just let people pirate them and give them away for free to be nice

215
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:47,224
Speaker 1: or thing and sell them

216
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:53,350
Speaker 0: or we can load them up with ads for free and then continue to make money off them even though They're old and we're not making any money off them anymore.

217
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,300
Speaker 1: I'd rather they sell them for five bucks.

218
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,580
Speaker 0: I would rather sell them for five bucks and it did for the plus.

219
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:00,990
Speaker 0: These games are old and in the bargain bin.

220
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:09,512
Speaker 0: You can just get them for five or ten bucks and If these games are worth playing, you know back in the day Then I would have spent 50 bucks on him.

221
00:15:09,532 --> 00:15:12,645
Speaker 0: if they were worth playing now I would have spent five or ten bucks on him.

222
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,935
Speaker 0: The game is either worth my time or it's not.

223
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:17,840
Speaker 1: you're forgetting one important thing.

224
00:15:18,244 --> 00:15:22,759
Speaker 1: There was a time in my life When I had more free time than things with which to fill it.

225
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:28,517
Speaker 1: Yeah and I remember I would think I would like I would play a lot of games that nowadays I wouldn't even consider.

226
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:38,980
Speaker 1: but back then I wanted to play a game and I already got sick of sieve 2 and tie fighter and x-wing and quest for glory and all my SNES games and all my SNES games and I already run around outside.

227
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:43,120
Speaker 1: So I just go to the store buy whatever $5 game was there and just play it.

228
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'd rather spend $5 then wait in line at file planet and then look at ads while I'm playing.

229
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:53,460
Speaker 1: actually You know, that's the word even the ads in the game while I wouldn't play it because of that file plan.

230
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,970
Speaker 1: It's really the only thing that's bad about this file.

231
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,480
Speaker 1: planet is like the worst website in the world.

232
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:06,918
Speaker 0: Yeah it is a good business idea to continue making money off of your old games that you spent all this money making and now they're Not making any more money for you.

233
00:16:07,602 --> 00:16:11,633
Speaker 0: But I don't think it's something I would ever go and get.

234
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,118
Speaker 1: gotta do it in a more clever way.

235
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:15,900
Speaker 1: either sell the game Straight up and like a super giant package.

236
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,292
Speaker 0: That's what you got to do.

237
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,603
Speaker 0: You got to do it Like ID did.

238
00:16:18,623 --> 00:16:19,566
Speaker 0: that's the better way to go.

239
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:24,504
Speaker 0: or get so every quake ever and every doom ever and every game you've ever made For like a 60 or

240
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:29,965
Speaker 1: give them away as a bundle bonus pack that comes with I don't know two or three new games You're selling

241
00:16:30,307 --> 00:16:30,711
Speaker 0: no

242
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:31,759
Speaker 1: or anything like that

243
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:38,444
Speaker 0: Wouldn't be a bad idea if like when you came out with new game like what you could do is you could just Like every even

244
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:42,375
Speaker 1: better make it like the first five thousand people who buy this game.

245
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,200
Speaker 1: get the bonus pack like Nintendo did.

246
00:16:45,581 --> 00:16:46,584
Speaker 1: That's a really good idea.

247
00:16:46,645 --> 00:16:47,307
Speaker 1: I don't I didn't like.

248
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:50,860
Speaker 0: that's an idea if I was a video game company, right making big games.

249
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,619
Speaker 0: You only come out with a game like every few years, right?

250
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,539
Speaker 0: So I'd sell the first game 50 bucks.

251
00:16:56,043 --> 00:17:03,965
Speaker 0: Then a few years later when I finally come out with another game I will give you the first game for free with the new game and then in a cup I give you the first two games are free.

252
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:04,989
Speaker 0: You gotta watch out.

253
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,756
Speaker 1: What if Kenny gamers think fine?

254
00:17:06,796 --> 00:17:09,944
Speaker 1: I'll just play your game I'll wait and that's fine.

255
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:15,239
Speaker 0: They eventually have to buy and When new games come out they eventually have to buy.

256
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,518
Speaker 0: So, you know, they might buy every other.

257
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,287
Speaker 0: you you know Every other game to try to.

258
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:24,078
Speaker 0: you know, get get big discounts on half the games But they're gonna have to buy eventually.

259
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,060
Speaker 0: Plus I could always be like every time I come out with a new game.

260
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:35,938
Speaker 0: I could be like buy just my new game for 50 bucks buy my new game and all my old games I've developed before for 70 bucks, you know something like that.

261
00:17:42,591 --> 00:17:44,016
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

262
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:50,489
Speaker 0: I'm sure everyone knows about my thing of the day already mostly because it was so awesome I had to post it in places.

263
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:56,630
Speaker 1: Yes, in fact, I actually have already used it to make a bunch of things for geek nights that you'll be seeing shortly.

264
00:17:57,191 --> 00:18:06,819
Speaker 0: Basically it's a generator as there are many generators on the internet such as the I don't know lolcat generators and Haha guy, haha guys my favorite.

265
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,409
Speaker 1: I spent like a week just making an infinite number of those things.

266
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:15,297
Speaker 0: so some someone made a Atari game cartridge label generator.

267
00:18:15,337 --> 00:18:20,170
Speaker 0: it makes labels in the style of the labels that go on Atari game cartridges.

268
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,558
Speaker 1: Well Atari 2600 game cartridges.

269
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:22,859
Speaker 0: Yes.

270
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:23,119
Speaker 0: Yes.

271
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,730
Speaker 0: Yes, and I'm wondering why aren't there like, you know NES label-makers rest NES label-makers?

272
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,302
Speaker 1: I think part of it is that the Atari I mean Nintendo.

273
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:36,522
Speaker 1: while the shape was always the same All the actual labels were so different that there's really nothing to.

274
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:44,050
Speaker 0: I'll know but you could go with the old style You know, well there were some Atari games that had different style labels on very few but all Nintendo games.

275
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:47,705
Speaker 1: Just the graphics were totally the only thing that was the same was the shape.

276
00:18:47,725 --> 00:18:49,172
Speaker 1: but the Atari one Hell.

277
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,868
Speaker 1: and the Nintendo seal of quality which we can't legally put on.

278
00:18:51,949 --> 00:18:56,090
Speaker 0: no No, but the Atari games they always let you put the Atari trademark on there.

279
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I took you.

280
00:18:56,994 --> 00:18:59,024
Speaker 1: take it off if you're gonna do something big or real.

281
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:04,241
Speaker 1: and also Atari Not quite the same as Nintendo when it comes to lawyering.

282
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:06,449
Speaker 0: No, you know, they're owned by someone.

283
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:07,633
Speaker 0: these days It keeps changing.

284
00:19:07,673 --> 00:19:17,490
Speaker 0: but the point is if you want to make Atari cartridge labels This is pretty damn cool because there's a there's a lot of uses of them and you can make some funny ones like you know.

285
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,478
Speaker 0: What would be funny if it was an Atari cartridge?

286
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,442
Speaker 1: I don't know.

287
00:19:20,522 --> 00:19:21,245
Speaker 1: Bioshock.

288
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:24,516
Speaker 0: Yeah Sorry, it's a good one.

289
00:19:25,118 --> 00:19:29,030
Speaker 1: or maybe if we made some sort of geek nights logo that kind of looked like an Atari cartridge.

290
00:19:29,822 --> 00:19:32,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe All right, right.

291
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:41,929
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day I'm not really gonna talk about it because it's quite germane to the topic at hand But it is essentially a speedrun of the game.

292
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,454
Speaker 1: We are about to review.

293
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:51,079
Speaker 1: so and if you haven't played this game or you want to hear the music from the game a little Watch a little bit of this but don't watch too much.

294
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,954
Speaker 1: if you ever plan to play the game because you're gonna ruin it for Yourself.

295
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:58,143
Speaker 1: you're gonna ruin the delightful trial and error discovery of how to win.

296
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:31,650
Speaker 0: the game known as The game has some gates and I guess it has some shadows, but the name shadow gay.

297
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,122
Speaker 0: I guess it's just the name of the castle right?

298
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:34,030
Speaker 0: It's castle shadow gay.

299
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,743
Speaker 1: Well, as far as I know this was a port of a PC game.

300
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,409
Speaker 0: was it I'd ever heard of that?

301
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:51,229
Speaker 1: These games were originally and I say these games because for those of you who played NES games You know that there were other games a lot like shadow gate like deja vu a personal favorite the uninvited.

302
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,517
Speaker 0: Was the uninvited for the NES?

303
00:20:53,598 --> 00:20:53,859
Speaker 0: Yeah.

304
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,051
Speaker 1: All right shadow gate 64.

305
00:20:57,051 --> 00:20:58,817
Speaker 0: Yeah shadow gate 64.

306
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:02,487
Speaker 0: My brother rented that for the 64 once and that's game.

307
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:03,270
Speaker 0: It's so bad.

308
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,163
Speaker 0: It's like MD guys bad.

309
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:06,150
Speaker 1: Wait a minute your brother.

310
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think you needed to say your shadow gauge 64 that my brother rented for the 64.

311
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:15,031
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I don't think shadow get 64 came out in the Atari 2600.

312
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:17,702
Speaker 0: There were games that that were 64. that weren't?

313
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:19,370
Speaker 0: you know, I could have been for that.

314
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,614
Speaker 0: It could have been a Jaguar.

315
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:21,217
Speaker 0: It could have been.

316
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:22,562
Speaker 0: it could have been for some other system.

317
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:24,128
Speaker 1: Like what the Jaguar I'd say.

318
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,905
Speaker 1: Anyway, these games are part of something called the Mac venture series on the Mac.

319
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:32,120
Speaker 0: Oh news to me.

320
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,823
Speaker 1: and It's pretty easy to port a game like this to the NES because there's really no control.

321
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:42,450
Speaker 1: you just hover around a little skeleton finger Or gauntlet finger and click on menus.

322
00:21:42,972 --> 00:21:44,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of sucks.

323
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:52,606
Speaker 0: play these games in the NES because they're designed to be run You know with a mouse and the clicking but instead use the gamepad actually to move a finger around.

324
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:54,536
Speaker 1: this from what I'm told But I can't.

325
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:55,710
Speaker 1: I mean I didn't play it on the Mac.

326
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:59,369
Speaker 1: People said that you actually use the keyboard to move the thing around on the Mac.

327
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:00,798
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

328
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:08,574
Speaker 0: a lot of games used to be like yeah But it is kind of handy though because the it'll just when you move the hand it like around the the main part of the Screen.

329
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:17,110
Speaker 0: it moves around slowly But once you get it into the menus on the bottom and the right hand side of the screen It just snaps to all the options and it's pretty easy to scroll through.

330
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:30,283
Speaker 1: Yeah now before now, I mean before we review this game or talk about it in any depth I'm sure many of you have played it and if you have that I think you know what we're about to Bring up, but this was a game that some might have called.

331
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:37,870
Speaker 1: some words could be difficult arbitrary insane stupid painful.

332
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:41,030
Speaker 1: Right, I guess we could mime Scott.

333
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,425
Speaker 1: I'll pretend that I am shadow gate and you try to do various actions in the game on me.

334
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:46,930
Speaker 0: Are you shadow gate?

335
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,672
Speaker 1: I'm shadow gate.

336
00:22:47,692 --> 00:22:49,056
Speaker 1: Just you stand you see a door.

337
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,042
Speaker 0: I look death.

338
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,948
Speaker 0: I don't think it's quite that bad.

339
00:22:53,049 --> 00:23:20,068
Speaker 1: I think Shadow gate is a game where every door every torch every Pixel just is seething with death and not just like oh you die, but really bizarre Elaborately described deaths it ranging from oh, no You're sucked out into the vacuum of space where you explode horribly or you melt into the green slime You tried to walk across or the dragon burns you or you fall into the fire or you punch yourself in the face.

340
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:27,590
Speaker 1: into that You know, I think there I could do a whole show just describing or reading all the deaths in that game.

341
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:42,897
Speaker 0: Basically, you know when you play an adventure game like say, I don't know quest for glory grim fandango King's Quest Because like police quest in particular you just fucking died all the time There were there.

342
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,930
Speaker 0: it was possible to die in many of those games.

343
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:57,685
Speaker 0: However, there you basically most of the game was spent running around collecting items talking to people and Trying to figure out where to go to use your items to access a new area.

344
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:59,230
Speaker 0: so you could you know get further in the game.

345
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,340
Speaker 1: I'll break it down even further.

346
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,850
Speaker 1: in those games You would click like five or six times before you were presented with the situation that could possibly cause your death.

347
00:24:07,093 --> 00:24:08,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd you'd be like.

348
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,457
Speaker 0: You know trialing and erroring all over the place.

349
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:13,648
Speaker 0: and while you would have error error didn't mean game over.

350
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,530
Speaker 0: error meant Sorry, this isn't how to get further in the game.

351
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:22,308
Speaker 1: Try something else except in police quest where if you open the door and walk around the wrong side of the police car a car Just hits you and kills you.

352
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:28,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the games weren't free of death, but shadow gate has a lot more death than any of the others.

353
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:33,385
Speaker 0: I mean like just picking up a torch off the wall death opening a door death.

354
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:38,303
Speaker 0: you go into a room There's the you know, there's four doors and there's no clues.

355
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:39,930
Speaker 0: You just open one die.

356
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:43,950
Speaker 0: You know the grim reaper just shows up all sorts of randomly.

357
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:48,690
Speaker 1: It's a lot like that that scene in the silver surfer that screen of him crying on a surfboard.

358
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,071
Speaker 1: Yeah,

359
00:24:49,352 --> 00:25:06,774
Speaker 0: I mean there are some things you can do in the game where you won't progress further, but you also won't die but there aren't many of them and basically you have to figure out exactly what to do in the game to get ahead and Don't do anything else or deviate from that path whatsoever And that's the only way to win.

360
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:19,470
Speaker 1: really all these games are one-shot plays because once you have played through shadow gate once or Uninvited or any of these and you've beaten it There's no reason to ever play again because you know the exact sequence of steps necessary to beat the game.

361
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:23,363
Speaker 0: I mean you watch this speed run how the speed runs really short, isn't it?

362
00:25:23,885 --> 00:25:24,487
Speaker 1: Actually it is.

363
00:25:24,527 --> 00:25:25,450
Speaker 1: it's like 10 minutes long.

364
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, I played shadow gate once in college.

365
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:41,897
Speaker 0: I had a fact on game facts open on one screen and the the ROM open on the other screen and I scrolled through the fact and did it and it took me like 20 minutes and it was just straight through Completely boring and bleh.

366
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:47,449
Speaker 0: The only fun you're gonna get from this game is from Trialing and erring and trying to figure it out.

367
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,720
Speaker 0: But that's gonna be mad frustrating because you'll die all over the place.

368
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,402
Speaker 1: It's not that.

369
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,930
Speaker 1: well, let's fast-forward back in time.

370
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,619
Speaker 1: I guess reverse would be better or rewind.

371
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,283
Speaker 1: Back to the future?

372
00:25:56,605 --> 00:25:57,410
Speaker 1: Back to the past?

373
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:02,070
Speaker 1: Well ahead to the past if we fast-forward back to the future there anyway.

374
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:07,770
Speaker 1: So, uh, I'm like nine or however old I was when I owned this game and it was frustrating.

375
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,556
Speaker 1: But I don't know.

376
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:18,664
Speaker 1: maybe I'm alone in this but I think a lot of you who played NES games would agree that There was this certain level of frustration where you wouldn't stop playing the game.

377
00:26:18,705 --> 00:26:24,089
Speaker 1: It wasn't so frustrating that you'd say fuck it I'm just gonna beat break the game or sell it to my friend or not play it.

378
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:26,457
Speaker 1: But it wasn't so easy that you just beat it.

379
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,319
Speaker 1: it was just frustrating enough to where you'd think all right now I have to beat this game.

380
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,670
Speaker 1: I got to prove that I can beat it.

381
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if you I played deja vu a lot more than I played shadow gate, but it was a better game.

382
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,602
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was but I actually have deja vu.

383
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:40,990
Speaker 0: one and two for the Game Boy Color.

384
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:41,873
Speaker 0: But I haven't played that.

385
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,479
Speaker 1: but I never played to me either.

386
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,430
Speaker 0: but I bought it at GameStop for like five bucks random.

387
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,037
Speaker 1: I think I wanted three dollars.

388
00:26:48,138 --> 00:26:49,203
Speaker 1: I wanted it, but you bought it.

389
00:26:49,383 --> 00:26:50,368
Speaker 1: Whatever lend it to me.

390
00:26:50,388 --> 00:26:50,830
Speaker 1: I'll play him.

391
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:51,696
Speaker 0: It's Game Boy Color.

392
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,067
Speaker 0: you need a SP or something.

393
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,919
Speaker 0: anyway We got a bunch of SP when I played that game.

394
00:26:55,959 --> 00:26:57,003
Speaker 0: the way I played it is.

395
00:26:57,043 --> 00:27:17,890
Speaker 0: I would sit down and I would get Like maybe three or four screens into the game or five screens into the game and every time I played I already knew everything I had to do up to a certain point and then I would try different things and basically I just kept playing the game over and over and over and each time I Played I knew everything I had to do up to a certain point of the game.

396
00:27:18,051 --> 00:27:19,719
Speaker 0: So it was sort of like it was.

397
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:25,930
Speaker 0: it was almost as if I had the game saved But I had to replay from the beginning every time because it was a Nintendo game.

398
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,861
Speaker 1: Well, at least I mean we said, you know death.

399
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:31,150
Speaker 1: all the time when you die You don't actually have to start over.

400
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:35,726
Speaker 1: All it does is weak like one of your torches burns out or something and your torch it whatever.

401
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:36,890
Speaker 1: you lose some torch power.

402
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,627
Speaker 0: That is one thing interesting in shadow gate is that you have these torches, right?

403
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:41,310
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get to that.

404
00:27:41,475 --> 00:27:41,830
Speaker 0: Okay.

405
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:48,902
Speaker 0: So you have to keep a torch lit pretty much Always almost or else it gets dark and you can't see in bad things that.

406
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:56,150
Speaker 1: well if it's ever dark if there's ever a moment Where you were anywhere in the game and there's not a lit torch in the room or in your possession you immediately die.

407
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:00,950
Speaker 0: Yep, because the dark horrible nasties come out and get you but they're scared away by a small fire.

408
00:28:01,652 --> 00:28:07,290
Speaker 0: So you have these supply of torches and every almost every room in the game has some torches lying around that you can take.

409
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:12,270
Speaker 0: But sometimes you'll take a torch and it'll actually be a lever that opens up something.

410
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,937
Speaker 0: Sometimes you take a torch and you'll die.

411
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:18,737
Speaker 0: Sometimes you'll take a torch and it won't be a normal torch It'll be a special center.

412
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:20,043
Speaker 1: That's my favorite part in the game.

413
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,429
Speaker 1: early on right you grab torches.

414
00:28:21,893 --> 00:28:23,469
Speaker 1: So you feel like torch torch one.

415
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:25,370
Speaker 1: So it's like torches torches torch.

416
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:30,890
Speaker 1: I got eight torches and then I pick up this one torch and it just says torch on a separate line item.

417
00:28:31,432 --> 00:28:31,814
Speaker 0: Huh?

418
00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:35,530
Speaker 0: Why do I have ten torches but this one torch that look just like all the others?

419
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,094
Speaker 1: Torches and one torch.

420
00:28:37,214 --> 00:28:37,856
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like what.

421
00:28:38,177 --> 00:28:38,879
Speaker 0: why is that?

422
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:41,886
Speaker 1: Well, if you like that torch death.

423
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:53,570
Speaker 1: Oh, gee Yes, but uh if I'm gonna spoil something if you just decide to throw that torch at a wraith It kills the wraith but throwing another torch does death.

424
00:28:57,411 --> 00:29:05,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, so arbitrary thing is part of the fun is to me the game was fun in an exploration way Because especially if you didn't cheat.

425
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:20,710
Speaker 1: and it was really fun in this kind of when I when I read choose your own adventure books As a kid right nominally I was trying to win but more importantly I was trying to get as many interesting gruesome deaths as I could and I basically sought out all the interesting deaths.

426
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,550
Speaker 0: It is a lot like a very advanced choose your own adventure game.

427
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:27,269
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a part where like you run into his Sphinx and he's got some riddles for you.

428
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:31,790
Speaker 0: You know and like that's the kind of thing you'd see in a. choose your own adventure book is like maybe a riddle.

429
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:42,030
Speaker 0: Raise my right hand and then at your left at the bottom It would give you like three different potential riddle answers and say if you answer Go to page 10.

430
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,640
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if you answer riddle number two go to page.

431
00:29:44,721 --> 00:29:47,311
Speaker 0: if your answer is, you know this answer go to page 20.

432
00:29:47,311 --> 00:29:48,295
Speaker 1: Shadowgate was different though.

433
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:50,424
Speaker 1: You actually had to have an item and give it to the Sphinx.

434
00:29:50,545 --> 00:29:51,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why it was a very.

435
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,994
Speaker 0: It's a much more complex.

436
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:58,112
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure where instead of just having a few choices and you go to those pages It's.

437
00:29:58,393 --> 00:30:05,316
Speaker 0: you have a lot of choices and most of them are death and you have to and you can actually use some sort of Twisted Nintendo logic to maybe figure it out.

438
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,583
Speaker 1: See Oh God, you know, I just realized.

439
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:13,217
Speaker 1: I don't think we've ever properly explained the phrase Nintendo logic Nintendo logic, let's see.

440
00:30:13,257 --> 00:30:16,650
Speaker 0: Let's think of some real-world examples instead of some made-up example.

441
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,338
Speaker 1: Well, Nintendo logic is the.

442
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:38,984
Speaker 1: if the in video games Especially for NES gamers like a kid who's nine years old has been playing NES games There are solutions to problems that to a kid like that makes perfect sense but to any other human being are just ludicrous and Crazy Shadowgate is probably the most perfect example of that.

443
00:30:39,024 --> 00:30:48,016
Speaker 1: I mean, all right There's a lake and there's a skeleton in it holding a key and there's an island on the other end and you can't go in The water the skeleton shark whatever gets you.

444
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:58,557
Speaker 1: Well, obviously I throw this glass sphere I found into the lake thereby freezing it Obviously or I make so much sense.

445
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:06,149
Speaker 1: I'm a plumber right mushrooms make me big, duh Or Maniac Mansion was really good about that, too.

446
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:13,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anytime there's you know a puzzle or of some sort and it's solved by something that makes no sense whatsoever.

447
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:21,290
Speaker 0: That's what we call Nintendo logic Like yeah throwing the banana over the top of the house is totally the only way to open the unlock the front door.

448
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:30,099
Speaker 0: You know something crazy like that where it makes sense within the context of this wacky video game usually an adventure game But in the real world, it makes no sense.

449
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,348
Speaker 1: I think partly it was just a suspension of disbelief.

450
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:35,382
Speaker 1: as a kid I wouldn't even think that doesn't make sense.

451
00:31:35,443 --> 00:31:40,870
Speaker 0: I think yeah, I got it Like hey, I need to hear his example and uh, I need to get across this water.

452
00:31:41,352 --> 00:31:44,266
Speaker 0: I know I'll give the monkey a banana and it'll build a bridge for me.

453
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:56,889
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, right but this game is probably the core of all Nintendo logic because the game is mostly trial and error and For a lot of it if you're clever you can figure it out.

454
00:31:57,251 --> 00:32:05,590
Speaker 0: For example, there's a part where you go into a room and it says the rooms getting hot And there's a bunch of treasure in the room and you want all of it and there's a dragon staring.

455
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,554
Speaker 0: Well, you don't see it.

456
00:32:06,614 --> 00:32:08,099
Speaker 0: You don't know it's a drag.

457
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,722
Speaker 0: You see eyes.

458
00:32:08,742 --> 00:32:10,890
Speaker 1: All right, you see a very scary looking thing.

459
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,111
Speaker 1: It's

460
00:32:11,211 --> 00:32:25,861
Speaker 0: obviously a dragon because it's hot and it smells like brimstone and you see eyes looking at you through the wall And you know, there's a dragon gonna breathe fire on you and you know that there's a bunch of treasure in here that you want but you don't want to die as is gonna happen in This game and one of the treasures is shield.

461
00:32:26,222 --> 00:32:34,909
Speaker 0: if you pick up the shield first The dragon will breathe fire and then you'll have a bit of time After the shield melts to get some treasure before running away.

462
00:32:35,832 --> 00:32:39,130
Speaker 1: Or like an early part of the game you learn spells and the spells are all words.

463
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:56,430
Speaker 1: The first spell you learn is from a sign on the wall and if you look at the sign a few times you learn the spell and the spell is a poor and There's a coil or rope laying there and sure lo and behold if you cast that spell in that room that rope does something.

464
00:32:56,671 --> 00:33:01,887
Speaker 0: It's like that stupid DC superhero chick who says things magic spells backwards and they happen.

465
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:02,850
Speaker 1: Oh, what the hell's her name?

466
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:17,418
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is a stupid underwear Stupid superhero and a stupid power and a stupid set of comics, but I digress but in Shadowgate not so stupid But seriously the other than that a lot of the stuff is just fucking random Some of its common sense.

467
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,550
Speaker 1: like for the longest time I never thought of this.

468
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:27,093
Speaker 1: but there's a point where you come into a room like in a field a courtyard and There's a Cyclops and if you try to get past him He kills you.

469
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:33,570
Speaker 1: and if you try to like stab him or something with the sword You've got he kills you because he's a better Cyclops and you're just a punk.

470
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:39,517
Speaker 1: But if you use the sling and you have a rock in the sling you knock him out All right, and I have like five rocks.

471
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,022
Speaker 1: So I go past him later.

472
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,366
Speaker 1: I gotta come back through that area.

473
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:43,670
Speaker 1: He's awake shit.

474
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:44,999
Speaker 1: I use my sling again.

475
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,744
Speaker 1: I come back later.

476
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:46,610
Speaker 1: He's awake shit.

477
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,829
Speaker 1: I'm running out of rocks and there's a limited number of rocks in the game.

478
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:53,802
Speaker 1: One day I realized wait a minute after he's knocked out.

479
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:54,866
Speaker 1: What if I stab him then?

480
00:33:55,288 --> 00:34:02,029
Speaker 1: and sure enough It says you stabbed the Cyclops it dies bleeding into the ground blah blah blah and then it never bothers you again.

481
00:34:02,351 --> 00:34:06,650
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you don't figure that out, you can only go through there five times.

482
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,889
Speaker 0: You don't need to go through there five times to beat the game, by the way.

483
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you really suck at the Sphinx riddles.

484
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:12,290
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

485
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,170
Speaker 0: But yeah, the thing is the game has a plot I guess technically.

486
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:20,581
Speaker 1: Oh, I know the plot because remember I read the novelization of that game.

487
00:34:20,782 --> 00:34:21,083
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

488
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,969
Speaker 0: The plot is like you're the prince I think or something.

489
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:29,570
Speaker 1: Yeah You're going to castle castle shadow gate to stop the evil wizard who's going to summon the blah blah blah.

490
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,344
Speaker 1: It's going to destroy the world or something and the king is fucked.

491
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:34,491
Speaker 0: or something King.

492
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:49,489
Speaker 0: so you go around getting like the king's treasure and then you find the dead king and you take his ring and his staff or you and then you or like you use the king's stuff to open the final door in the game and then you go Through and is the evil wizard and then if he summons the big monster that looks like Godzilla and you have to kill it

493
00:34:49,951 --> 00:35:01,117
Speaker 1: most of the I'd say about a third of the puzzles can be solved by being smart a third of them can be solved by bizarro fucking Nintendo logic and A third of them are missed puzzles.

494
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:06,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, like God the worst one the only part of the game I actually looked up how to beat.

495
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:13,209
Speaker 1: there's a part where you find there's this room with three levers Okay and you can kind of manipulate them just randomly.

496
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:28,583
Speaker 1: if You think back to way way back in the game in the room where the Sphinx is sitting there's a stairway that goes up and Behind the Sphinx on the stairway is a bunch of lines kind of etched into it and it looks like background Whatever you wouldn't even think.

497
00:35:28,604 --> 00:35:37,015
Speaker 1: to look there It turns out that's the pattern in which you have to move all the levers in order to make the thing happen completely unrelated Completely far away.

498
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:38,681
Speaker 0: Not not in any way.

499
00:35:38,741 --> 00:35:41,230
Speaker 0: Would you make a connection between that and the levers now?

500
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,441
Speaker 1: That's why I hated mist because almost all of mist was bullshit like that.

501
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:46,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like hey, what do I do here?

502
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:56,174
Speaker 0: well, if you had bothered to look at you know, the the Way, the chlorophyll was shaped on a leaf on the other side of the board No way connected to this.

503
00:35:56,435 --> 00:36:02,069
Speaker 0: you would know that the correct pattern to place those things is, you know, CD QB RXV something.

504
00:36:02,189 --> 00:36:07,525
Speaker 1: and I mean, I honestly despite the fact that the game is bad in a lot of gameplay regards.

505
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,290
Speaker 1: It is really fun to play.

506
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:16,430
Speaker 0: Well, the thing about this game is that what it lacks in I guess good adventuring it makes up for in charm.

507
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,477
Speaker 0: I mean the music is cool.

508
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:19,620
Speaker 1: The music is awesome.

509
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,466
Speaker 1: This game has some of the better Nintendo music.

510
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:22,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, the music rocks.

511
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:26,922
Speaker 0: You walk around while all this stuff the game itself is kind of silly.

512
00:36:26,942 --> 00:36:32,670
Speaker 0: a lot of the stuff is kind of cute Like you see a nice skeleton or there's like a shark in the water.

513
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:34,696
Speaker 0: And you know this stuff is just.

514
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:42,760
Speaker 0: it's got a good like feeling to it of like sort of like a happy Cool crazy kooky dungeon full of kooky stuff.

515
00:36:43,262 --> 00:36:52,687
Speaker 1: Of course at the same time you start I mean nearly in the game anytime you see something like oh you start poking and fraud and using stuff and using stuff and The game trains you the same way.

516
00:36:52,788 --> 00:36:56,999
Speaker 1: people who don't understand puppies train puppies by hitting you in the face with the newspaper.

517
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,440
Speaker 1: all the top death death death.

518
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:04,216
Speaker 1: So once you get like there's a point where you get to like the second part.

519
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:06,627
Speaker 0: even the most benign Actions will result in death.

520
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,736
Speaker 0: Hey, why don't I try using this on that?

521
00:37:08,837 --> 00:37:09,500
Speaker 0: Okay, it does nothing.

522
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,834
Speaker 0: Why don't I try using this on that?

523
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:11,400
Speaker 0: it does nothing.

524
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:14,290
Speaker 0: I'll try using this on that death for no reason.

525
00:37:14,371 --> 00:37:24,620
Speaker 1: when you get like to the second part of the game where now you're in Like this mansion and you like go get a lightning rod and put it up and get lightning to strike it by casting a spell To get the book to get the glasses to read the other book to clear the spell.

526
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,878
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that part of the game is really hard and difficult to do.

527
00:37:28,701 --> 00:37:36,944
Speaker 1: But you start to get really paranoid and anytime you enter a new room you sit there thinking don't touch anything Don't touch anything.

528
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:37,948
Speaker 1: Don't look at anything.

529
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:38,630
Speaker 1: Don't do anything.

530
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:45,813
Speaker 0: Oh shit looking usually won't get you killed Yeah, but doing anything dead moving can get you killed.

531
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:46,474
Speaker 0: like there's some.

532
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:48,943
Speaker 0: there's some doors that if you just go in the door You die.

533
00:37:48,964 --> 00:37:50,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are some doors.

534
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,380
Speaker 0: if you open them you die.

535
00:37:51,701 --> 00:37:52,184
Speaker 0: There is some.

536
00:37:52,224 --> 00:37:52,445
Speaker 0: like.

537
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:55,199
Speaker 0: sometimes the game will give you a choice of like two or three ways to go.

538
00:37:55,684 --> 00:37:57,199
Speaker 0: If you choose the wrong way you die.

539
00:37:58,424 --> 00:37:59,769
Speaker 0: You just have to figure it out.

540
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:00,712
Speaker 0: It sucks.

541
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:02,900
Speaker 1: It helps that the flavor text is really funny.

542
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:08,379
Speaker 0: The game rewards depending on when every different death sort of has different flavor text.

543
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,888
Speaker 1: Mostly yeah, almost all of it does.

544
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:11,812
Speaker 1: very few of them don't?

545
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:12,876
Speaker 1: you can also kill yourself.

546
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,060
Speaker 1: set yourself on fire.

547
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:16,029
Speaker 0: You can be like use torch on self.

548
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,893
Speaker 0: Oh god.

549
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,911
Speaker 1: Oh And there's like a bunch of different potions potion one potion two potion three potion four.

550
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,237
Speaker 1: I think with one exception.

551
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:28,783
Speaker 0: They're all poison Way to go.

552
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,595
Speaker 1: a lot of items in that game are just fucking nothing.

553
00:38:31,615 --> 00:38:32,799
Speaker 1: They'll just kill you if you use them.

554
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:35,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is what I look.

555
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:38,080
Speaker 0: I do like that when games give you stuff in your inventory.

556
00:38:38,202 --> 00:38:39,340
Speaker 0: That's just not necessary.

557
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:43,920
Speaker 0: It's sort of like when someone's trying to solve a riddle and you give them a bunch of extra information.

558
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,892
Speaker 0: That doesn't actually mean anything and it throws them way off course.

559
00:38:47,515 --> 00:38:50,367
Speaker 0: It's like hey Sort of like petals around the roads.

560
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:52,577
Speaker 0: The reason that's so hard is all the extra information.

561
00:38:52,597 --> 00:38:53,240
Speaker 0: That's not necessary.

562
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:57,219
Speaker 1: Oh, man, I taught that game to Emily's dad and it's really bugging him and he wants to solve it.

563
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,807
Speaker 0: I just did what.

564
00:38:58,827 --> 00:39:01,360
Speaker 0: there's a bunch of extra information there that you don't need to look at.

565
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,150
Speaker 1: I don't think he listens to our show regularly.

566
00:39:03,271 --> 00:39:03,653
Speaker 1: Oh, well,

567
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:09,228
Speaker 0: I guess that's his loss And he'll say my shadow gate, I don't know I just

568
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:37,342
Speaker 1: it kind of gives me this feeling of exploring like While the game is weird and fucked up it's every screen is really interesting and the way you interact with a lot of things is really interesting and If nothing else I think of it as an exploration game and I'm exploring this screwed up world And I don't care if I beat the game because that's really hard Like getting some weird item and using it on something and making something happen and seeing a new screen with a weird graphic is kind Of cool.

569
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:42,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean just looking at pictures of all the screens would be enough plus the flavor text also.

570
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:47,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I didn't find a video of a bunch of deaths from the game But I found that speedrun.

571
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:52,300
Speaker 1: if you want to play the game though Don't watch much of the speedrun or you're not gonna be able to play the game and enjoy it.

572
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,961
Speaker 0: Yeah Just get the ROM or whatever because I think that's the only way to get this game nowadays and don't play any other versions of it.

573
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:01,069
Speaker 0: don't play like sequels or 64 versions or anything though.

574
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,539
Speaker 1: do play deja vu because it is overall a much better game.

575
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,072
Speaker 0: a Deja vu is the same kind of game only better and it's sort of like one.

576
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,277
Speaker 1: It's right up our alley.

577
00:40:09,558 --> 00:40:18,274
Speaker 1: It's like 2030s gangsters something mafia something film noir something really cool theme.

578
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:28,511
Speaker 1: the characters are cool and Most of the puzzles you can figure out by being smart and by reading text and not just random death Most of them anyway, and there is a plot the only.

579
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:35,593
Speaker 0: there's only a couple fit arbitrary things in deja vu But like exactly how you end the game is not immediately obvious.

580
00:40:35,754 --> 00:40:36,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you figure that out.

581
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,066
Speaker 1: if you're not an idiot Yeah, I figured it out.

582
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,533
Speaker 1: eventually if you don't figure it out.

583
00:40:40,553 --> 00:40:41,839
Speaker 1: That means you didn't understand the plot.

584
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,131
Speaker 1: yet Why don't you figure out the plot?

585
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:47,090
Speaker 0: You're like, ah It's not so easy to understand.

586
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:50,408
Speaker 0: the plot like gives you everything you need But it doesn't fill in all the blanks.

587
00:40:50,428 --> 00:40:51,915
Speaker 0: you sort of to fill in some on your own.

588
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:53,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I kind of like that.

589
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:54,588
Speaker 0: It's not.

590
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:56,580
Speaker 0: it's not the best either but it's better than shadow.

591
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,274
Speaker 1: The only real problem with deja vu is that you can totally fuck yourself.

592
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:03,108
Speaker 1: the first time I got to the end of the game I went to the bungalow.

593
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,155
Speaker 1: I had every day.

594
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:04,940
Speaker 1: I got all the shit.

595
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,680
Speaker 0: You didn't have enough money to get back in the cab.

596
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:10,897
Speaker 1: I didn't have any more quarters, so I couldn't take the cab back, but I had a $20 bill.

597
00:41:11,821 --> 00:41:13,871
Speaker 1: But the cabbie wouldn't give me change and it wouldn't.

598
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:15,900
Speaker 1: just let me give him the 20 and not take change.

599
00:41:16,503 --> 00:41:19,900
Speaker 1: And if I tried to leave the cab, he called the cops and if I tried to shoot him he called the cops.

600
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:28,032
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah Granted I was very satisfied when I found the people who did this to me Instead of you know getting the evidence and calling the cops.

601
00:41:28,414 --> 00:41:33,320
Speaker 1: I just shot him both in their beds And then the cops came and took me away, but whatever I got revenge.

602
00:41:33,481 --> 00:41:34,666
Speaker 0: That's not how you end the game.

603
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:36,092
Speaker 1: You can in the game that way.

604
00:41:36,112 --> 00:41:36,735
Speaker 0: That's it.

605
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:37,759
Speaker 0: There's a losing end.

606
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:42,015
Speaker 1: I see there's a bunch of different ends and I feel like that's a victory in a way.

607
00:41:42,517 --> 00:41:43,320
Speaker 0: It's a losing end.

608
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,420
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the week ending and Simon's quest.

609
00:41:47,582 --> 00:41:48,878
Speaker 0: No, it's also a losing end.

610
00:41:49,823 --> 00:41:53,900
Speaker 0: There's only one good ending in deja vu the correct at the one that lets you see the credits.

611
00:41:54,283 --> 00:41:55,069
Speaker 0: That's the real ending.

612
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:55,875
Speaker 1: All right, right.

613
00:41:55,895 --> 00:41:56,439
