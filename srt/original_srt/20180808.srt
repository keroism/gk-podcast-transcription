00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,592
Speaker 1: So, you know you go to buy some breakfast right like you do.

7
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:30,480
Speaker 1: sometimes you can get a whole but you know And to save money I want to get breakfast that I can have at home.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,020
Speaker 1: I just wake up and eat not have to stop and get an expensive bacon egg and cheese every day.

9
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:42,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, so as much as I would think that as much as I like things like yogurt and stuff for breakfast I pretty much want a hot breakfast.

10
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,719
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna make a hot breakfast at home.

11
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,225
Speaker 1: No, so, you know, I got.

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,750
Speaker 1: I got some pancake mix.

13
00:00:47,132 --> 00:00:47,614
Speaker 1: I got some.

14
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:49,019
Speaker 1: sometimes I buy some English muffin.

15
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,560
Speaker 0: Yeah pancake mix that's a weekend breakfast.

16
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:54,196
Speaker 1: Just make a few pancakes.

17
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,774
Speaker 0: You're not gonna do that before you go to work unless you work from home.

18
00:00:58,176 --> 00:00:58,919
Speaker 1: I do it anyway.

19
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:07,048
Speaker 1: But you know sometimes even though you know people our age don't do cereal Sometimes I'll go for some cereal.

20
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:19,379
Speaker 0: So where I work we have like the cafeteria with snacks and stuff But in the morning, there's a gigantic cereal bar With like ten different cereals and a lot of people eat cereal for breakfast with their milk.

21
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:25,708
Speaker 1: But anyway, so the cereal that I like is Shredded wheat because it's nothing but wheat.

22
00:01:25,768 --> 00:01:27,113
Speaker 0: What are you 90 years old?

23
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:28,518
Speaker 0: shredded wheat is awful.

24
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:28,960
Speaker 1: It's great.

25
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,345
Speaker 1: And then there's no bullshit.

26
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,332
Speaker 0: Is it at least the frosted shredded wheat?

27
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:32,814
Speaker 0: No.

28
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:34,500
Speaker 0: Why would you eat shredded wheat?

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,242
Speaker 1: It's delicious.

30
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:36,267
Speaker 1: It tastes like nothing.

31
00:01:36,287 --> 00:01:36,870
Speaker 1: Tastes like wheat.

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:37,915
Speaker 0: Tastes like, yeah, nothing.

33
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:39,080
Speaker 1: You don't like cream of wheat either.

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,125
Speaker 0: I think you just don't like wheat.

35
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:44,566
Speaker 1: Cream of wheat is Disgusting.

36
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:46,780
Speaker 1: I think rim just doesn't like wheat.

37
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:50,129
Speaker 0: Wheat is excellent if converted into something like bread.

38
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:54,200
Speaker 1: It can burn it into a hard biscuit or into a watery mush.

39
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, hard biscuit is fine.

40
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,654
Speaker 0: hard shredded wheat not fine.

41
00:01:58,694 --> 00:01:59,276
Speaker 1: that's a biscuit.

42
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:00,620
Speaker 0: anyway that is not.

43
00:02:02,181 --> 00:02:04,671
Speaker 0: There is a world where someone would call that a biscuit.

44
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,137
Speaker 0: That is not a biscuit to me.

45
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:13,560
Speaker 1: a biscuit is It says first of all, it says biscuit on the box right because the there's two versions.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,880
Speaker 0: There's the one I could take a poop in a box and write the word biscuit.

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,105
Speaker 1: It's the one with the big one and the one with a lot of little ones Right the big one.

48
00:02:20,125 --> 00:02:21,855
Speaker 1: that it says right on the box big biscuit.

49
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:22,580
Speaker 1: I don't like that one.

50
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:24,395
Speaker 0: I was about to say if you like that one.

51
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,020
Speaker 0: that's even worse.

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,040
Speaker 1: You got to get the ones a lot of small ones and it's the grocery store next to me doesn't have it.

53
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,131
Speaker 1: I got to go far away to get it and I don't want to.

54
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:37,478
Speaker 1: so I look at all the Cereals in the grocery store next to me to see which one doesn't have any fucking sugar in it.

55
00:02:38,385 --> 00:02:41,505
Speaker 0: right and Granted like for comparison.

56
00:02:41,565 --> 00:02:45,595
Speaker 0: as a kid the cereals I ate were the Nintendo officially branded cereal.

57
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:47,400
Speaker 1: So just sugar in a bag.

58
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:52,034
Speaker 0: I didn't like the charms, but I really only ate the marshmallow sugar in a box.

59
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,700
Speaker 0: Okay and frosted flakes.

60
00:02:54,021 --> 00:03:01,456
Speaker 1: so actually I found that the cereal with the most sugar per gram is Honey nut Cheerios, which is one of the series that I would eat.

61
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:05,268
Speaker 0: Yeah But actually I used to really like sugar crisp.

62
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like which was renamed what golden crisp?

63
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:09,385
Speaker 1: I don't know.

64
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,606
Speaker 1: I like corn pop was a sugar cereal a Most sugar cereals.

65
00:03:13,666 --> 00:03:14,249
Speaker 1: I would not eat.

66
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,640
Speaker 0: I usually eat cinnamon toast crunch was my jam.

67
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,106
Speaker 1: That's what I would eat.

68
00:03:19,147 --> 00:03:19,811
Speaker 1: If those were like.

69
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:25,279
Speaker 1: it was like the only sugar Cereal maybe but whatever the point is.

70
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,845
Speaker 1: So the sticker.

71
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:31,920
Speaker 1: I went and I looked at all these healthy looking cereals that looked healthy on the box.

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,104
Speaker 0: That's our next Thursday show.

73
00:03:33,124 --> 00:03:40,051
Speaker 1: We've never done a show on some all these healthy looking brands like Kashi and Whatever the fuck right and all these series.

74
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:40,754
Speaker 1: you look at the box.

75
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:44,650
Speaker 1: They look super healthy like hey We are you know tons of greens.

76
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:49,440
Speaker 1: and then you look at the fucking ingredients on the side And it's like sugar a bajillion grams.

77
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:50,165
Speaker 1: You know that's like.

78
00:03:50,406 --> 00:03:50,789
Speaker 1: it's like this.

79
00:03:50,809 --> 00:03:52,439
Speaker 1: shit's no better than the lucky charms.

80
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:59,152
Speaker 0: That is like when you try to get like a fruit juice and you look at it And it's actually just concentrated apple juice and flavor right.

81
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,200
Speaker 1: so it's like all these healthy looking cereals are just sugar.

82
00:04:01,764 --> 00:04:02,651
Speaker 1: So I'm like alright fine.

83
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:03,800
Speaker 1: I'll just get a rice krispie.

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,760
Speaker 1: It's rice plus fire, but no even rice krispie has some sugar in it.

85
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,893
Speaker 0: I so there was a time when I would eat rice krispies every morning rice krispie.

86
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like some banana in there.

87
00:04:12,661 --> 00:04:14,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, but but that's the thing I'd only eat.

88
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:17,300
Speaker 0: rice krispies adorned never unadorned.

89
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:24,332
Speaker 0: You eat a frosted or a non frosted flake unadorned.

90
00:04:24,592 --> 00:04:27,240
Speaker 0: would you eat a no shredded weed unadorned?

91
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:29,887
Speaker 1: No, I put a raisin in the shredding.

92
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:30,811
Speaker 0: just one raisin.

93
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,499
Speaker 1: No just one raisins.

94
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:34,247
Speaker 1: You don't eat it.

95
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:34,971
Speaker 1: You don't eat those either.

96
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:35,815
Speaker 1: I like raisins.

97
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:37,343
Speaker 1: You don't eat raisins I don't.

98
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:46,000
Speaker 0: so I take issue with the fact that 99% of the time when I see a cookie that from a distance is chocolate chip, and I find out that it's oatmeal raisin.

99
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:47,367
Speaker 1: I'm disappointed.

100
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:54,518
Speaker 0: oatmeal raisin is delicious And I actually like oatmeal cookies without raisins in them more than I like oatmeal raisin cookies.

101
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,164
Speaker 1: anyway I do like raisins.

102
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:57,551
Speaker 1: I go to buy the rice krispies.

103
00:04:57,793 --> 00:04:59,300
Speaker 1: It's a little box of rice krispies.

104
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,680
Speaker 1: They didn't have a big one, and it was mad expensive, so I'm like what the fuck is this?

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,187
Speaker 1: Why is it like $5 this tiny box of rice krispies?

106
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:13,410
Speaker 1: inflation, so I go over and as I'm walking I realize hey There's those like off-brand cereal in a bag.

107
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:21,800
Speaker 1: Well you really are like 70 years old, and I'm like hey There's that off-brand cereal in a bag that I would never in my whole life think of possibly buying when I was a kid.

108
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,425
Speaker 0: But actually I bought my term for those because as a young child I noticed them in the grocery store.

109
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:30,534
Speaker 0: there were two levels of the low-rent cereal.

110
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:38,120
Speaker 0: there was bottom shelf cereal That usually was in boxes or big bags and had names that evoked the names of real cereal.

111
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:39,907
Speaker 0: But then there's one step lower.

112
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:42,940
Speaker 0: there was the giant troughs where you could just scoop it into your own bag.

113
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:50,160
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't see that anyway, so yeah I see the off-brand rice krispies in a bag and it's way cheap compared to the real rice krispies.

114
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,069
Speaker 0: All right was it worth it?

115
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:54,634
Speaker 1: cuz I'm assuming you bought it And you tried it and had less sugar than the real rice krispies.

116
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:55,580
Speaker 0: It was probably worse.

117
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,351
Speaker 1: It was pretty much just right just and it didn't even have high fructose corn chip.

118
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:05,208
Speaker 1: The ingredients were literally just like rice You know and crispy increase.

119
00:06:05,248 --> 00:06:05,468
Speaker 1: right?

120
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,560
Speaker 1: I had some sugar, but not near not as much as the actual name-brand rice krispies.

121
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:09,823
Speaker 1: So I'm like.

122
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:10,571
Speaker 1: you know what fuck it.

123
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,359
Speaker 1: It's so cheap.

124
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:18,300
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy the off-brand rice krispies in a bag And you know what you could not tell it apart from real rice krispies with a blind taste test.

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,551
Speaker 1: It is the same fucking thing right?

126
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 1: why I'm the same factory I have no idea, but well it's different though the ingredients wise, but it tastes a hundred percent identical.

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,544
Speaker 1: You could not fucking tell.

128
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,533
Speaker 1: even I was unblind and I couldn't tell.

129
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:33,560
Speaker 1: there's no way you could tell if you were blind.

130
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:37,739
Speaker 1: Why did I not buy the off-brand cereal in a bag before?

131
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,542
Speaker 1: Right why did.

132
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:46,100
Speaker 1: I fall for the marketing of the snap crackle and pop dudes youth naivety and classism right?

133
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,493
Speaker 1: So give up your your whatever pride or whatever you can trust.

134
00:06:50,854 --> 00:07:00,494
Speaker 0: the cereal in a bag however I would argue that far superior to any form of cereal would be the shredded wheat or the cream of wheat would be just like The bagel with a couple of eggs and some bacon.

135
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:05,480
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that'd be great But that cost four dollars a day whereas a bet the cereal in a bag is like two dollars.

136
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,500
Speaker 1: And as I said last you a whole week what?

137
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,912
Speaker 1: Regardless of how much a week or four dollars a day.

138
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:19,079
Speaker 0: back when I was pretty poor I was willing to sacrifice most things in my life to have a good hot breakfast or not.

139
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,687
Speaker 1: poor I'll get a four dollars.

140
00:07:21,887 --> 00:07:23,554
Speaker 1: Maybe once or twice a week.

141
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:24,860
Speaker 1: Maybe once every other week.

142
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:29,340
Speaker 1: You know I still would rather pay two dollars a week total.

143
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, I will say though that lately I pretty much my breakfast is like two bananas.

144
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,789
Speaker 1: well No, you get a banana a crispy and some or sometimes.

145
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,174
Speaker 0: I'll been in one banana one plum.

146
00:07:38,294 --> 00:07:39,578
Speaker 0: like that's good breakfast mmm.

147
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:44,858
Speaker 0: So yeah in some news since Wednesday anime manga comics.

148
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:45,340
Speaker 0: What do you got?

149
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,865
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

150
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:49,792
Speaker 1: if people realize this if you don't read underwear.

151
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:53,044
Speaker 1: perfect comics right but Fantastic Four has.

152
00:07:53,847 --> 00:07:55,091
Speaker 1: which was Marvel's like.

153
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,679
Speaker 1: the first Marvel Universe comic was Fantastic Four.

154
00:07:57,699 --> 00:07:58,181
Speaker 1: people Don't?

155
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:01,191
Speaker 1: I don't have many people don't know that or do whatever right like.

156
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:07,691
Speaker 1: the Marvel Universe didn't even exist until The Human Torch met Namor right at some point.

157
00:08:07,731 --> 00:08:09,235
Speaker 1: that was like when it became a universe.

158
00:08:09,275 --> 00:08:10,819
Speaker 1: before that it was just separate heroes.

159
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:17,760
Speaker 1: But yet the Fantastic Four it was like the first Marvel comic and it ran super long.

160
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,673
Speaker 1: And then some time ago it disappeared.

161
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:27,371
Speaker 1: and not only did the comic disappear but all the characters disappeared from pretty much every Marvel thing.

162
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:38,039
Speaker 1: and the story goes that basically the Crazy, you know nut job owner of Marvel studio video, whatever right you guys got bought by Disney.

163
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,783
Speaker 1: But he's still.

164
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:42,880
Speaker 1: he's still the owner chief of Marvel who basically doesn't seem to do much.

165
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:55,520
Speaker 1: He just sort of an owner like the editor-in-chief of Marvel's who really makes the comic book decisions handed down some decree like no more Fantastic Four because They didn't have you know, even they didn't have the movie rights.

166
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:57,632
Speaker 1: So he felt like they were.

167
00:08:57,652 --> 00:08:59,000
Speaker 1: this is just a story, right?

168
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:10,980
Speaker 0: He felt like Marvel Comics were giving free advertising to someone else's movies someone else's stuff Which honestly makes sense because the market the core market for actual floppy comic books pretty tiny.

169
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,060
Speaker 0: You're gonna only gonna make real money by selling the movies.

170
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:22,458
Speaker 1: So they so they did stuff in the story to basically make the Fantastic Four go away So you wouldn't see those characters anymore and such.

171
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,428
Speaker 1: But now they're back because why?

172
00:09:25,569 --> 00:09:29,560
Speaker 1: well Disney which bought owns Marvel as that 21st century deal.

173
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,720
Speaker 1: But that's gonna finish probably next year and then they will own the Fantastic Four again.

174
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,572
Speaker 1: So they got to get the hype up because they're gonna you know, bring it in.

175
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:42,407
Speaker 1: probably one or two years from now You're gonna see some Fantastic Four Marvel Universe stuff happening.

176
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:45,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know it's hard to say if I care or not.

177
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:48,171
Speaker 1: So the thing with Fantastic Four right is like.

178
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,180
Speaker 1: they're not like my favorite heroes, right?

179
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,349
Speaker 1: You know, it's like but not like the biggest Fantastic Four fan in the universe.

180
00:09:53,369 --> 00:09:56,058
Speaker 0: They are very simple one could say elemental.

181
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:02,040
Speaker 1: well But the thing is if you read the old comics, they're hella corny.

182
00:10:02,481 --> 00:10:04,125
Speaker 1: Right as underwear.

183
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,371
Speaker 0: perfect comics of all old underwear.

184
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:07,575
Speaker 0: perfect comics are corny.

185
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:14,597
Speaker 1: the special thing about Fantastic Four Right with Stan Lee and Jack Kirby is That it is not quite.

186
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:21,890
Speaker 1: Dr Strange level of psychedelic but still sort of old crazy sci-fi Twilight Zone.

187
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,642
Speaker 1: ish in a way Right.

188
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:25,348
Speaker 1: It has those vibes going on.

189
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,077
Speaker 1: the other comics don't really have that sort of you know Sci-fi stuff going on.

190
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:40,480
Speaker 0: Well, like venture brothers has like their superhero stuff in that universe and it's basically the Fantastic Four and it's like that fits with The like super science genre, right?

191
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:46,333
Speaker 1: So if you read say, you know a Fantastic Four story You're basically like you can as a with a human.

192
00:10:46,534 --> 00:10:52,295
Speaker 1: as a human with a good brain You can sort of extract and separate like this corny presentation.

193
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:53,840
Speaker 1: I'll hit you you little guy

194
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:54,962
Speaker 0: From

195
00:10:55,384 --> 00:11:12,359
Speaker 1: this sci-fi story that also comes sort of intertwined and like your brain as you read them sort of splits them apart like a DNA coming apart in two strands Right, so it's very easy and many people have in more recent times You know made Fantastic Four stories that don't have the corny part

196
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:21,014
Speaker 0: But at the same time like to be fair if I really want like a trippy far-out sci-fi story I'm gonna read like a culture book or something.

197
00:11:21,074 --> 00:11:24,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do you know, whatever It's not that it's not exactly that kind of sci-fi.

198
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:31,658
Speaker 1: But anyway So Fantastic Four number one, I think comes out today cuz it's Wednesday right available on August 8th for purchase.

199
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:34,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay I was right Wednesday is Comics Day came out today.

200
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:36,059
Speaker 1: It's written by Dan slott.

201
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:45,240
Speaker 1: I've seen some rumblings online that like maybe Dan slott is a bad guy But I don't know why because I've only ever seen him being a good guy.

202
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,920
Speaker 1: He I think I mentioned this before that I found out that he wrote the red and stinky comic.

203
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,552
Speaker 1: That was awesome when I was a kid and he also is like any.

204
00:11:53,712 --> 00:12:06,419
Speaker 1: any Dan slott comic I've read has been Sort of that really light-hearted and fun but still really good like the kind of thing that a kid could read and connect with but also an adult can read.

205
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,445
Speaker 1: and You know, it's sort of you know.

206
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:12,119
Speaker 1: lifts makes the kid feel like he's smart, you know, and it's still.

207
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 1: you know.

208
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,085
Speaker 1: The kind of that's the kind of feel like you're right.

209
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:21,251
Speaker 0: matrix made a lot of people feel very smart about baby's first philosophy Right, but you know, he writes, you know, the more like.

210
00:12:21,351 --> 00:12:26,127
Speaker 1: it's fun, but it's not stupid fun It's it's somewhat intelligent, but still like.

211
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:35,175
Speaker 1: there's something there like like a Saturday morning cartoon that you can appreciate You know like a Dexter's lab kind of level maybe even a little more than that, right?

212
00:12:35,195 --> 00:12:36,360
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff he writes.

213
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,329
Speaker 1: and Yeah, so he's writing this new fantastic four.

214
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,095
Speaker 1: So maybe is gonna be good.

215
00:12:43,355 --> 00:12:44,700
Speaker 0: I feel like we're gonna have to review it.

216
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:54,363
Speaker 0: We can't avoid it, maybe I'm not gonna buy the issue By comic issues, it's 2018.

217
00:12:54,363 --> 00:12:55,612
Speaker 0: Say you don't buy comic issues.

218
00:12:55,672 --> 00:13:04,946
Speaker 1: It's 1998 But yeah, but apparently from what I've heard is that you know since the fantastic were like been missing that in the first issue It doesn't get him back together yet.

219
00:13:05,006 --> 00:13:08,600
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like it's almost a zero issue and not a number one issue.

220
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:10,070
Speaker 0: I did.

221
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:12,769
Speaker 0: I Really have a hard time with.

222
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,860
Speaker 0: well, let's start over again like that.

223
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,620
Speaker 1: I think it more explains what happened to them since you haven't seen them in so long.

224
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,252
Speaker 0: Oh, but I don't care about that either.

225
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:25,012
Speaker 0: I Almost would want a new Fantastic Four to just start in media res with.

226
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:28,844
Speaker 0: yeah, here's the Fantastic Four and let's just go They're doing something.

227
00:13:28,965 --> 00:13:33,020
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is is like, you know that I think they were like all in different places.

228
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:36,433
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, yeah do something like more reason spider-man stuff.

229
00:13:36,453 --> 00:13:38,040
Speaker 0: We're just like, you know, who spider-man is.

230
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:45,477
Speaker 1: We're just gonna have a spider-man story, you know spider-man like, you know Peter Parker's company is like in the Fantastic Four is building or something.

231
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:48,780
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz they're not there anymore.

232
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:56,488
Speaker 0: So in some other news if you didn't know Otacon which is no longer in Baltimore and we no longer perform at is Actually this coming weekend.

233
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,840
Speaker 1: There's supposed to be a Nazi rally down the street.

234
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:08,380
Speaker 0: Yeah So the news here is one if the Nazi rally is happening and you're going to Otacon You should go counter-protest the Nazi rally and go to Otacon.

235
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,126
Speaker 0: Don't just do one bring.

236
00:14:10,186 --> 00:14:13,960
Speaker 1: make sure your cosplay includes, you know rocks or something to throw at them.

237
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,996
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah do not cosplay as a Nazi.

238
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:20,230
Speaker 0: No But that's generally good advice anywhere.

239
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,600
Speaker 0: Not just if there happens to be a Nazi rally nearby.

240
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:27,340
Speaker 0: It's still weird though like to this like we don't go to at this point in geek nights.

241
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:28,627
Speaker 1: I've been to Otacon in nine years.

242
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:33,671
Speaker 1: We don't perform went to two three We went to eight Otacon's.

243
00:14:33,893 --> 00:14:37,448
Speaker 0: until a few years ago We had done more panels at Otacon than at pecs.

244
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:42,825
Speaker 1: I went to eight Otacon's and there's been a lot since we stopped going.

245
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:56,611
Speaker 0: there have been nine that we haven't gone to but more importantly we used to Attend and perform at a lot of anime cons and we're actually at a point where we neither attend nor perform At any anime cons.

246
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:58,340
Speaker 1: not your anime cons.

247
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:04,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least currently there are no anime centric conventions that we attend or perform at in any capacity.

248
00:15:05,441 --> 00:15:06,986
Speaker 0: Anime, Boston is still fantastic.

249
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:08,029
Speaker 0: Like it's a great convention.

250
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:13,647
Speaker 0: It's the best anime con I can think of but One it's in a cold part of the year.

251
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:18,765
Speaker 0: and to the security in Boston means that I basically don't want to ever go to Any convention in Boston?

252
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:22,740
Speaker 0: I'm even annoyed at going to PAX East because of that security.

253
00:15:23,551 --> 00:15:28,715
Speaker 0: but Even though we haven't been to Otacon in a long goddamn time.

254
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:30,180
Speaker 0: I don't want to go to Otacon.

255
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,980
Speaker 0: I definitely don't want to perform at Otacon.

256
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:39,600
Speaker 0: I Still get weirdly nostalgic when I think about Otacon because we went to a lot of Otacon's and spent a lot of time there.

257
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:52,870
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's this weekend And I guess if you're going I'm curious how it goes Because since they moved it seems like a lot of the but like almost no one I know goes anymore Either to perform or just to attend.

258
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:55,480
Speaker 0: so I like don't know what the state of Otacon is.

259
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:03,087
Speaker 0: mmm If you want to go to an anime con that we might go to though Anime NYC is coming up in November.

260
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:07,060
Speaker 0: It does not overlap with PAX meaning we can actually go to it.

261
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:08,586
Speaker 0: There's a good chance.

262
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,655
Speaker 0: We're gonna actually perform at it and do some panels.

263
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:11,600
Speaker 0: We're still working that out.

264
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,067
Speaker 1: Just take the subway over.

265
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,419
Speaker 1: Yeah walk around look around do a panel go home.

266
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:20,700
Speaker 0: Yep, the subway that goes to anime NYC also goes directly to my apartment.

267
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,430
Speaker 0: Yep, like it's real hard to not go to this.

268
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:29,693
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go to that anime Expo sponsored other anime event.

269
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:30,919
Speaker 0: No, that's gonna be in New York.

270
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:35,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, because one I can't take the subway to it and two I don't think it's gonna be good.

271
00:16:36,942 --> 00:16:44,720
Speaker 0: But if you want to do a panel at this anime convention anime NYC You should submit them because the panel deadline is like next week.

272
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,046
Speaker 0: It's coming up real quick.

273
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:49,280
Speaker 0: They're actually doing it way in advance because it's all smart people around on the con.

274
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:58,094
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day what do you got?

275
00:16:58,114 --> 00:17:05,102
Speaker 1: So, you know, I'm sure rim is familiar I don't know how many listeners are familiar with the Yoshida brothers who are a a group of people who play The.

276
00:17:05,142 --> 00:17:05,884
Speaker 1: I believe they're brothers.

277
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,794
Speaker 1: They play traditional Japanese instruments.

278
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,520
Speaker 0: I'm a big fan of the Yoshida brothers.

279
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,579
Speaker 1: Typically shamisen I think right and they play, you know, they don't play typical japanese music on those shamisen.

280
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,119
Speaker 1: They play fucking awesome music.

281
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:21,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you just go on youtube type yoshida brothers, you'll find good stuff.

282
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:23,720
Speaker 1: here is something I came across.

283
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:32,314
Speaker 1: It is a group of people with traditional japanese instruments Uh, and they are playing the theme song to sailor moon.

284
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,100
Speaker 0: This is real good, which is pretty good.

285
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:37,170
Speaker 1: So, uh, I think this channel I think has other stuff too.

286
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,300
Speaker 0: Well, both the stagecraft is good and the music is good.

287
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:43,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's like a filming of a live performance.

288
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:45,339
Speaker 1: So This is worth a listen.

289
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:52,111
Speaker 0: So I had a different thing in the day, but since scott had traditional japanese instruments I have one I found a long time ago.

290
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,759
Speaker 0: I think I used it as a stinger at some point.

291
00:17:54,281 --> 00:18:09,700
Speaker 0: But this is a traditional japanese band using mostly traditional japanese instruments covering a song you all know and love Africa by toto Which has been continuously stuck in my head for almost eight months now.

292
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:13,029
Speaker 1: It hasn't been eight months since we talked about this.

293
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,420
Speaker 0: oh we got stuck into my head well before we started talking about it.

294
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:22,528
Speaker 1: so at least Nobody once told you So he's gone.

295
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,640
Speaker 0: he blessed the rains down in africa.

296
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,306
Speaker 1: It has ousted a different song.

297
00:18:27,326 --> 00:18:30,756
Speaker 0: So i'm gonna warn you guys though like fair warning.

298
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:31,679
Speaker 0: because remember a while ago.

299
00:18:31,699 --> 00:18:36,618
Speaker 0: I was like I should make an anime music video and then like I just did and I made it.

300
00:18:37,361 --> 00:18:42,520
Speaker 0: So I have that same feeling in my brain and I took that same first step.

301
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:46,987
Speaker 0: I took all-star And I took africa.

302
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,392
Speaker 1: I don't know if those mixed well together.

303
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:50,539
Speaker 0: They so you wouldn't think they would.

304
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:51,707
Speaker 1: You tried.

305
00:18:51,727 --> 00:18:53,279
Speaker 1: you're trying to do a neil scissor ego job.

306
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,580
Speaker 0: So I pull I I threw together like I hacked it together just to see like is there a way to make it work?

307
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:07,247
Speaker 0: and it worked About as well as when I was like I should just take this pony song and take Takes utenna and just like mash them together.

308
00:19:07,268 --> 00:19:10,177
Speaker 0: and I just like threw the timeline together and just listened to it.

309
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:10,779
Speaker 0: It kind of worked.

310
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:16,685
Speaker 0: I might try to make the cesarengian style Africa all-star.

311
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:17,850
Speaker 1: How do they give the skills to do that?

312
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,219
Speaker 0: Uh, it'll be quite low bar here.

313
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,823
Speaker 0: Quite low bar.

314
00:19:21,843 --> 00:19:26,560
Speaker 0: You don't have a lot of experience making mashups, but I do have a lot of experience arranging.

315
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:29,560
Speaker 1: I think if you made a hundred of them, then you would certainly make good ones.

316
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:34,538
Speaker 0: Yeah But you know I'd never made an amv before and I had none of those skills and I met a pretty fucking good amv.

317
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:38,860
Speaker 1: in my opinion It's a little more, uh obvious to you know, I don't think it takes a hundred.

318
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,540
Speaker 1: I think it only takes like 10 to make a good amv, but I only made one.

319
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,129
Speaker 0: Well, I just made one.

320
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,739
Speaker 0: it only took like two days.

321
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:49,882
Speaker 0: But uh, we'll see i'm working on this a little bit But it's past.

322
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:55,140
Speaker 0: the point of this won't work and it's at the point of it's stuck kind of like a rabbit.

323
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,707
Speaker 0: So if you the thing about pet rabbits is that sometimes they'll get an idea in their head Like how do you know?

324
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,194
Speaker 1: So how do you know what the rabbit's thinking?

325
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,340
Speaker 0: So here's here's an example.

326
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,234
Speaker 0: So say there's an area the rabbits can't get to and should not get to.

327
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:09,840
Speaker 0: usually it's not a problem.

328
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,723
Speaker 0: They can't get there.

329
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,910
Speaker 0: They don't express any interest in getting there.

330
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:13,652
Speaker 0: It's not a problem.

331
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:24,369
Speaker 0: But occasionally the rabbit will appear to be like investigating the area that they're not supposed to get into Or actively attempting to get into the area.

332
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:27,480
Speaker 0: So of course you fortify the area from that point forward.

333
00:20:28,122 --> 00:20:38,120
Speaker 0: For the rest of time the rabbit will always be trying to get into that area and you see them attempting it Once they decide they want to do something the more you try to stop them the more they will try to do it.

334
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:39,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's what children do.

335
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:43,043
Speaker 0: That's what I do when it comes to Mashing up.

336
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:43,585
Speaker 1: What is this?

337
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:45,212
Speaker 1: No trespassing sign.

338
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,276
Speaker 1: I want to go in there.

339
00:20:46,316 --> 00:20:49,367
Speaker 0: real bad No swimming.

340
00:20:49,468 --> 00:20:50,214
Speaker 0: fuck you you can't.

341
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:50,980
Speaker 0: you're not my boss.

342
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:52,903
Speaker 0: Fuck you dad.

343
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:54,008
Speaker 1: I do what I want.

344
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:57,179
Speaker 1: Maybe they maybe you only see this in rabbits because they're learning from you.

345
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,976
Speaker 1: They got your your dna's.

346
00:21:01,483 --> 00:21:02,456
Speaker 1: Other rabbits don't do this.

347
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,870
Speaker 1: Well, the only rabbit says they learn.

348
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:06,860
Speaker 0: they learn from a professional.

349
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:11,152
Speaker 0: In the meta moment the book club book is no longer the odyssey.

350
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:17,089
Speaker 1: No, it is now the odyssey Regular odyssey space odyssey.

351
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,154
Speaker 1: you got to find a third odyssey.

352
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:29,357
Speaker 0: Yep, uh, actually If I use that uh planescape book What I keep talking about it is odyssey adjacent the pages of pain pages of pain.

353
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:32,157
Speaker 1: it is pages of pleasure instead.

354
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,059
Speaker 0: Uh pages of pleasure is basically all the culture books.

355
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:40,428
Speaker 0: The party and player of games.

356
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:44,930
Speaker 0: in the beginning before he goes off the guy gets so drunk He falls off the cliff and it's totally fine.

357
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:46,420
Speaker 1: Let's watch the mel triple.

358
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:51,771
Speaker 0: Everyone's walking around with their narcotics bowls Full of web.

359
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:52,278
Speaker 1: I see.

360
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:55,304
Speaker 0: I had to explain.

361
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:57,293
Speaker 0: I said full web to someone at work yesterday.

362
00:21:57,313 --> 00:21:58,177
Speaker 0: Oh, they didn't know what it was.

363
00:21:58,257 --> 00:21:59,927
Speaker 0: Of course not Of course not.

364
00:21:59,948 --> 00:22:01,579
Speaker 0: I had to explain it, but you know what?

365
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,146
Speaker 0: Full web as a concept.

366
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:11,368
Speaker 0: that is the most succinct way to express that con like that Moderately complex concept in a succinct form, right?

367
00:22:11,388 --> 00:22:12,892
Speaker 1: Well, well, I think there's two.

368
00:22:12,913 --> 00:22:15,440
Speaker 1: those are two terms from uh, science fiction novels, right?

369
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,024
Speaker 1: There's grok.

370
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:19,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is sort of like you have a full web of Understanding is what.

371
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:22,030
Speaker 1: so grok means you a full web of understanding.

372
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,980
Speaker 1: Yeah and full web means you have accomplished a complete, right?

373
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:32,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, sort of they're related in that way and they both sort of uh Communicate fullness.

374
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,947
Speaker 1: Yep, right of of you know I don't know.

375
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:40,778
Speaker 1: That's why that's why we need words like grok and full web because there's no other word.

376
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:41,723
Speaker 0: Yep Well, it works.

377
00:22:41,783 --> 00:22:44,980
Speaker 0: i'm taking over like i'm taking over an area for someone else.

378
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,000
Speaker 0: So I have to like do this knowledge transfer and like learn all their biz so I can deal with their biz.

379
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:52,780
Speaker 0: And one of the engineers was like so does this all make sense?

380
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,431
Speaker 0: And I said I understand it, but I do not yet grok.

381
00:22:55,933 --> 00:23:01,554
Speaker 0: and he said all right like he He fully grokked what I said to him grok the grok.

382
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:06,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, perfectly chromulant word But anyway 2001 a space odyssey.

383
00:23:06,228 --> 00:23:08,095
Speaker 1: I went to see the movie in 70 millimeter.

384
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:09,320
Speaker 1: It was still great.

385
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:10,988
Speaker 1: I hadn't seen it in a long time.

386
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,777
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read the book like imminently.

387
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:15,348
Speaker 1: I started Like two chapters of the book.

388
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,292
Speaker 1: it doesn't seem that long.

389
00:23:16,393 --> 00:23:16,694
Speaker 1: actually.

390
00:23:16,754 --> 00:23:22,215
Speaker 0: I was planning to read it Uh, possibly to fullness at the beach, but I feel like we're not going to the beach.

391
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,440
Speaker 1: this looks like it's gonna rain now.

392
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,318
Speaker 1: Maybe the weather will change and we will go to the beach.

393
00:23:25,338 --> 00:23:25,540
Speaker 0: We'll see.

394
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,340
Speaker 1: The point is uh, I didn't realize this but the I thought it was a book was written and then a movie was made.

395
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:40,396
Speaker 1: But actually the book and screenplay were written simultaneously by simultaneously Right, uh, what's author's name again?

396
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,180
Speaker 1: Arthur Arthur C. Clark and Stanley Kubrick worked on this at the same time.

397
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:53,140
Speaker 1: That was news to me and that's kind of really interesting But that's still different from the movie and still worth reading.

398
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,506
Speaker 1: Uh separate even if you see.

399
00:23:54,526 --> 00:23:57,440
Speaker 0: the important point is we have a book club and you should read these books.

400
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,814
Speaker 0: I think every book we've read and done a show on is worth reading.

401
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:04,976
Speaker 1: actually at least one person Who had already read the book said they were going to read it again.

402
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:10,831
Speaker 1: Wow Uh, okay, but yeah That's a person who already reads books.

403
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,100
Speaker 1: we need people who don't read books.

404
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,249
Speaker 1: This is a all-time classic book.

405
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,580
Speaker 1: I feel like you should read it if you're a nerd of any kind.

406
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:17,646
Speaker 0: I was just scrolling through.

407
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,169
Speaker 0: I think there's.

408
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,160
Speaker 1: I haven't read it and i'm fixing that you should fix it, too.

409
00:24:20,321 --> 00:24:30,066
Speaker 0: I am confident there is in fact only one book we have ever done on the geek nights book club that you should not bother reading world war z. That book's real fucking dumb.

410
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:31,954
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we did name of the wind also.

411
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:34,244
Speaker 0: Uh I don't.

412
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:35,732
Speaker 0: I think that's almost worth reading.

413
00:24:35,752 --> 00:24:37,018
Speaker 0: It's worth reading name of the wind's.

414
00:24:37,078 --> 00:24:45,666
Speaker 0: Okay Remember most of our complaints about name of the wind were based on knowledge from the second book Not based on that book.

415
00:24:45,947 --> 00:24:47,072
Speaker 0: that book in and of itself.

416
00:24:47,433 --> 00:24:48,015
Speaker 0: wasn't that bad?

417
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:48,337
Speaker 0: It wasn't.

418
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:49,120
Speaker 0: it was worth reading.

419
00:24:49,923 --> 00:24:52,472
Speaker 0: I think world war z is literally the worst book we've ever talked about.

420
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:54,659
Speaker 0: It's not good like by a mile not good.

421
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,890
Speaker 1: Anyway, uh, yeah and pax west is uh labor day weekend.

422
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,633
Speaker 1: We're gonna be there.

423
00:24:58,713 --> 00:25:00,660
Speaker 1: Our panel is monday at the crack of dawn.

424
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,651
Speaker 1: It's gonna actually be streamed even though it's in such a shitty time.

425
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,655
Speaker 1: That's a trade-off.

426
00:25:04,715 --> 00:25:05,618
Speaker 1: Whatever i'm going to pax.

427
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:06,020
Speaker 1: I don't care.

428
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,753
Speaker 0: Yep, otherwise, we'll just be at pax doing paxing.

429
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:09,134
Speaker 1: Duh.

430
00:25:09,154 --> 00:25:16,230
Speaker 0: Uh Yeah, if you see us around we're gonna try to do our expo hall thing Like the video thing that we used to do and then we stopped.

431
00:25:16,612 --> 00:25:18,340
Speaker 0: I think we'll have time to do it at this pax west.

432
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:19,926
Speaker 1: I got I got some ideas.

433
00:25:19,946 --> 00:25:21,110
Speaker 0: I got some ideas too.

434
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:21,853
Speaker 0: We should plan this.

435
00:25:22,315 --> 00:25:23,640
Speaker 0: i'll have the new camera by then too.

436
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,968
Speaker 1: Are you you definitely here?

437
00:25:25,491 --> 00:25:26,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's about how to bring any.

438
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,670
Speaker 0: I'm gonna bring a real camcorder to get this.

439
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,096
Speaker 1: I don't have to bring any video cameras.

440
00:25:31,236 --> 00:25:32,160
Speaker 1: I can bring way less stuff.

441
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,219
Speaker 0: Uh, we'll see.

442
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:34,284
Speaker 0: So what's your debate?

443
00:25:34,304 --> 00:25:39,597
Speaker 0: because if you bring your camera the only value of that other than you taking photos But you could bring a smaller camera for that.

444
00:25:39,637 --> 00:25:47,200
Speaker 0: indeed Is that we would have two 4k high quality actually color correct camera angles for our panel.

445
00:25:48,241 --> 00:25:48,963
Speaker 0: We've never had that.

446
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:53,578
Speaker 0: we always have your good camera and my like 15 year old camcorder.

447
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:55,083
Speaker 1: Uh, we'll see We'll see.

448
00:25:55,124 --> 00:26:00,948
Speaker 0: we'll play it by ear but for at least for the purposes of doing Non-panel content.

449
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:07,005
Speaker 0: I will have a real camcorder Which will just make that way easier to pull off So city.

450
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:14,580
Speaker 0: so, uh keiichi arawi Is the person who wrote the manga nichijou that you probably know from the anime nichijou.

451
00:26:14,921 --> 00:26:19,540
Speaker 1: I've never read that manga nichijou, but i've watched like a handful of episodes of the anime.

452
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,169
Speaker 0: I've watched a lot of the anime.

453
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:36,660
Speaker 1: It is one of my favorite Non like non-narrative anime and it was all right, but it was sort of it was a little bit more disjointed and wacky Uh than say as among a dial which is similar in feel and genre.

454
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:39,499
Speaker 0: It's one step more zany than as a manga dial

455
00:26:40,363 --> 00:26:44,680
Speaker 1: But it also has didn't feel compelled to keep watching it even though watching it wasn't so bad

456
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 0: I did but not in the sense of like watch every episode in order but more in the sense of I want to see something funny.

457
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:53,059
Speaker 0: I'd pick literally a random episode and just watch it.

458
00:26:53,386 --> 00:27:01,220
Speaker 1: but anyway Uh, so I saw in the comic order form city volume one and it's like from the creator of nichijou a new manga volume one.

459
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,167
Speaker 1: Buy it now and i'm like, all right.

460
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:03,949
Speaker 1: I'll try that out.

461
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,712
Speaker 1: See what the deal.

462
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:07,020
Speaker 1: right, you know, not an anime manga, right?

463
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,793
Speaker 1: We'll see what the deal is.

464
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,520
Speaker 1: So I got city volume one and I also got city volume two, but rim only read volume one.

465
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,038
Speaker 1: I read both but I remember two way better than one because I read one a long time ago.

466
00:27:16,842 --> 00:27:19,371
Speaker 0: Yep, so the short the tldr version is.

467
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,113
Speaker 0: I really like it.

468
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,298
Speaker 0: i'm gonna read all of it, right.

469
00:27:21,338 --> 00:27:21,940
Speaker 1: so it's weird.

470
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:31,546
Speaker 1: So the best way I can describe it is it's like a it's like a super cliche like you've seen all this before But it's crooked slightly.

471
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:33,973
Speaker 1: So and it's also current right?

472
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:38,567
Speaker 1: It's like even though I feel like i've read These exact stories before.

473
00:27:38,647 --> 00:27:41,720
Speaker 1: i've seen all this these characters before and everything.

474
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:44,572
Speaker 1: I haven't exact not exactly anyway.

475
00:27:44,592 --> 00:27:46,360
Speaker 1: Oh other characters slightly different.

476
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:50,780
Speaker 1: But what other manga anime coming out now?

477
00:27:51,402 --> 00:27:52,729
Speaker 1: Is this kind of thing?

478
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:53,574
Speaker 1: It's like in the past.

479
00:27:53,614 --> 00:27:54,499
Speaker 1: there were I feel like i've.

480
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:58,380
Speaker 1: I feel like even though I had a hard time naming them right these kinds of stories.

481
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:00,565
Speaker 1: But what were they?

482
00:28:01,107 --> 00:28:01,609
Speaker 0: I think it's this.

483
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:02,793
Speaker 1: and what coming out now?

484
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:03,636
Speaker 1: is that kind of story?

485
00:28:03,656 --> 00:28:12,820
Speaker 0: I guess like the genre it's It's slice of life Crossed with like a little more zaniness than the real world, but not much more.

486
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:24,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly like the level of things that happen in this comic Are about on par with the level of like things that I encounter living in new york city on a like weekly basis.

487
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:25,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right.

488
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:26,546
Speaker 1: So the deal is right.

489
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:28,472
Speaker 1: and his israel see the cliches, right?

490
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:31,059
Speaker 1: There is a very poor.

491
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:33,386
Speaker 0: She's my favorite character.

492
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:34,169
Speaker 0: What nagamo?

493
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,772
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.

494
00:28:34,893 --> 00:28:36,480
Speaker 1: so it's hard to say there's a main character.

495
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,225
Speaker 1: It's called nagamo.

496
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,520
Speaker 1: It's called city because it's really about all these characters.

497
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,880
Speaker 0: I think the main character is the creepy guy spying on everyone.

498
00:28:42,523 --> 00:28:45,760
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's it's about all these different characters living in a city.

499
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,300
Speaker 1: So it's sort of simpsons-esque or they'll be like chapters that are about a character who's not the main one.

500
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:55,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you start off focusing on this one character and that sort of is really the.

501
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:03,740
Speaker 1: she's the driver for that first volume And it seems to get more focused than the others Uh, thus making her the main one, right?

502
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:05,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though it's not she's not.

503
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:18,820
Speaker 1: as it goes on she doesn't really get that much more focused, you know percentage wise anyway, um But yeah, so she is poor she can't afford to pay the rent and she's kind of like neutral evil.

504
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:21,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's got to do some shenanigans to get rent money.

505
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:26,340
Speaker 1: Uh, you know escapes her apartment and stuff when you know landlords all upset.

506
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,819
Speaker 1: Right, you know, it's like you feel like you've seen that before right somewhere, right?

507
00:29:31,582 --> 00:29:35,432
Speaker 1: Uh, and then there's all these other wacky characters around.

508
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,180
Speaker 1: there's the girl who keeps taking photos of stuff.

509
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,140
Speaker 1: There's there's the cop the cop who always stands at the booth.

510
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,180
Speaker 0: There's the old lady who apparently knows hokuto shinken, right?

511
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:53,808
Speaker 1: There's a restaurant where somehow she ends up with a job at the restaurant has like the dad who's the cook and the son I like how she didn't want to work there.

512
00:29:53,868 --> 00:29:56,618
Speaker 0: They didn't want to hire her and yet she ended up working there.

513
00:29:56,899 --> 00:30:00,319
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, you know, it's like oh, you know stuff like that, right?

514
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:12,920
Speaker 1: uh, and then it's like on the one hand is like this thin line of like things developing like it actually Even though like nijijou there is a narrative emerging slowly through this slice of life, right?

515
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:21,506
Speaker 1: Even though each chapter is like completely episodic comedy situations that come Like there's a chapter in volume two.

516
00:30:21,847 --> 00:30:26,220
Speaker 1: That's about uh, the the kid who works at the restaurant getting trapped in the mascot costume.

517
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:30,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's like a whole chapter right even though this every chapter is like that.

518
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:42,415
Speaker 1: there is sort of this thread of very slow progression where like The character the connections between the characters are increasing and they know each other more because at the beginning They like don't know any even though they live in the same city.

519
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:48,000
Speaker 0: They have no Visible connection to yeah, the one guy's like wait, isn't that the restaurant that girl works at right?

520
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,547
Speaker 1: It's like they start discovering each other and learning about past connections to each other and developing current connections to each other and learning Each other's names.

521
00:30:55,587 --> 00:31:02,359
Speaker 1: and you know creating a group And coming closer to each other sort of like that scene in snatch where all the cars crash into each other, right?

522
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,461
Speaker 1: Uh, it's through.

523
00:31:03,482 --> 00:31:08,880
Speaker 1: you can see that slowly happening and you can also see people like getting their shit together slowly, right?

524
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,662
Speaker 1: She's slowly Getting money and getting her shit together and they sort of hint at like, ah This is her.

525
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:19,240
Speaker 1: she actually has a talent and when you know the photo girl, you know gains a fan.

526
00:31:19,382 --> 00:31:28,338
Speaker 0: The see The one nagamo like busts into her apartment and she's just like taking pictures of broccoli that she's arranged on the floor.

527
00:31:28,539 --> 00:31:34,063
Speaker 0: Yeah Pretty much if I I mean if I had to describe like the important point about this market because it's great I like.

528
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,557
Speaker 0: I think it's really funny and I like it.

529
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:45,472
Speaker 0: it has impeccable comedic timing The way like even in terms of like what will be on the next page?

530
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:45,673
Speaker 0: Like.

531
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:47,117
Speaker 0: it's so well crafted.

532
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:53,408
Speaker 0: I laughed out loud Easily a dozen times reading volume one and I think the part like the best.

533
00:31:53,508 --> 00:32:03,213
Speaker 0: the most illustrative story in volume one about this is When the dude at the restaurant the chef Spills the dish he was going to serve to this client.

534
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:04,820
Speaker 1: That's a very seinfeld-esque chap.

535
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,640
Speaker 0: It is he spills this new these noodles, right?

536
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,122
Speaker 1: He's going to.

537
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:09,166
Speaker 1: he's going to I think what.

538
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:12,680
Speaker 1: he's going to give someone noodles to serve them and the guy's like drinking some wine.

539
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:13,327
Speaker 0: So he doesn't like.

540
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:13,913
Speaker 0: he's not noted.

541
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:14,560
Speaker 0: He doesn't notice.

542
00:32:14,841 --> 00:32:19,580
Speaker 0: He spills the noodles into the guy's open bag on the ground and the guy doesn't notice.

543
00:32:19,984 --> 00:32:23,940
Speaker 0: yeah, and the whole question is What does he do in this situation?

544
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:29,629
Speaker 0: And it is so utterly funny Like I can't even spoil it.

545
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:34,411
Speaker 0: the last page of that arc Is a comedic triumph.

546
00:32:34,512 --> 00:32:34,753
Speaker 1: Yep.

547
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:39,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good one But I don't know.

548
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:40,226
Speaker 0: This is for everyone.

549
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:44,011
Speaker 0: Like I think I can't think of the person who wouldn't enjoy this comment Person.

550
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:46,847
Speaker 0: Even then it's just looking at the pictures.

551
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:48,674
Speaker 1: It's funny be cold-hearted evil person.

552
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:51,928
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I guess if someone's evil They would not enjoy this.

553
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, even then they might still think it's funny.

554
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:58,553
Speaker 0: Sometimes I mean some evil people also read books and enjoy them.

555
00:32:58,634 --> 00:32:59,296
Speaker 0: So it's possible.

556
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:15,252
Speaker 0: I guess so But like I really I literally recommend this manga to anyone who's a fan of nijijo to anyone who's a fan of autism as a manga Daio To anyone who listens to geek nights Like I. I I think this is great and I think you should check it out.

557
00:33:15,713 --> 00:33:19,703
Speaker 1: So the the thing is the art is very Simple, right?

558
00:33:19,804 --> 00:33:22,614
Speaker 1: It's like it's sort of like folk up for come for panel.

559
00:33:22,735 --> 00:33:25,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, the characters are all Instantly recognizable.

560
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:27,918
Speaker 0: I'm never confused as to who someone is.

561
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:35,080
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, it's sort of like the art is like is if you ever read the asa manga dial manga Which was a four panel a four coma they call it, right?

562
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,025
Speaker 1: Uh, it's better than that, but it's like you look at say yotsuba yotsuba is like elaborate compared to City, right?

563
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:44,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're looking for like fancy artworks, this is not it.

564
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,324
Speaker 1: I think the important part is also if you're looking for length This is not it either.

565
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:50,311
Speaker 1: like this reads in like two seconds.

566
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:52,480
Speaker 1: Like yeah, you buy this thing for what does it cost?

567
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:54,667
Speaker 0: I have no idea what things cost.

568
00:33:54,687 --> 00:33:55,832
Speaker 1: Uh, it was.

569
00:33:55,892 --> 00:33:57,640
Speaker 1: it's not expensive but it's like, you know.

570
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:01,292
Speaker 1: Uh see what it is to get it from the south american.

571
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:04,786
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's low investment Like it's easy to pick up and put down.

572
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:08,978
Speaker 0: it's episodic enough to where it doesn't really matter like how quickly you read it.

573
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,908
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get sucked into some long crazy narrative.

574
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:15,719
Speaker 1: All right, so it's like it's like 12 13 dollars a volume, right?

575
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,677
Speaker 1: Uh, you're gonna blow through that in like 15 minutes.

576
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,565
Speaker 1: But also it's like a dollar a minute.

577
00:34:20,646 --> 00:34:21,248
Speaker 1: entertainment.

578
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:31,139
Speaker 0: the dialogue like the way the car like especially nagamo and the girl she's kind of mooching off of Their dialogue is actually pretty like realistic to how friends would interact.

579
00:34:31,783 --> 00:34:33,331
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not you know, it's it.

580
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:34,960
Speaker 1: they don't talk in any kind of weird way.

581
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's it's all.

582
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:37,473
Speaker 0: everything's very natural.

583
00:34:37,513 --> 00:34:40,667
Speaker 1: you're reading a translation also But I guess you know the translation totally.

584
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:43,780
Speaker 1: I you forget that it's japanese except you're reading right to left.

585
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're in a very japanese city.

586
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,914
Speaker 0: So i'm gonna read the rest of this.

587
00:34:47,994 --> 00:34:50,206
Speaker 0: if scott keeps buying it I'll just keep borrowing it from him.

588
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:52,300
Speaker 0: And if he stops buying it, I might just buy the rest of it.

589
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,128
Speaker 1: No, you're gonna spend your 13 dollars.

590
00:34:54,268 --> 00:34:55,635
Speaker 0: I'll just buy it on kindle.

591
00:34:56,338 --> 00:35:01,911
Speaker 0: Oh Is it on kindle, uh, let's see i'm on the amazon page.

592
00:35:02,051 --> 00:35:04,900
Speaker 0: it is kindle and comixology eight bucks.

593
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,124
Speaker 0: Paperback 11 30.

594
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,233
Speaker 1: Oh, it's actually much cheaper to not buy the paper version.

595
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,200
Speaker 1: Maybe i'll buy the not paper version from now on.

596
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like it's eight bucks a volume.

597
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:14,825
Speaker 0: That's not bad.

598
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,393
Speaker 0: comixology and kindle.

599
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:16,916
Speaker 0: That's fine.

600
00:35:17,298 --> 00:35:18,483
Speaker 0: the art This is.

601
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:22,640
Speaker 0: you don't need this to be like full color retina display to appreciate the art.

602
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, it's not good, but it's I don't need.

603
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:26,597
Speaker 1: there were no color pages, right?

604
00:35:26,878 --> 00:35:27,320
Speaker 1: I think none.

605
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:28,625
Speaker 0: Uh, there's a handful.

606
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:29,789
Speaker 1: the cover the cover wasn't.

607
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:32,560
Speaker 0: there's the insert and there's a couple of little colors.

608
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,654
Speaker 1: I mean if I read on my ipad, i'll see color anyway.

609
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:35,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what do I care?

610
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,932
Speaker 0: There's the bit in the beginning about the bird the irrelevant bird.

611
00:35:38,952 --> 00:35:42,879
Speaker 0: Yep, and even though the bird is irrelevant I keep seeing the bird on things.

612
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:47,956
Speaker 0: Also, the one unexplained mystery i'm kind of invested in is in the police station.

613
00:35:47,976 --> 00:35:53,079
Speaker 0: You keep seeing in the background There's a picture of this like cobra looking snake and it's just like have you seen me?

614
00:35:54,301 --> 00:36:00,219
Speaker 0: I expect at some point that is chekhov's cobra and we're gonna see that you're really noticing all the details.

615
00:36:00,299 --> 00:36:04,999
Speaker 0: Yep But the bird appeared a couple of times in the background too.

616
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:09,360
Speaker 1: Well, I think that's what it is is like, you know, like I said before there's these connections building, right?

617
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,010
Speaker 1: So and it's you have all these individual episodes.

618
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,855
Speaker 1: yet during those individual episodes.

619
00:36:14,895 --> 00:36:25,726
Speaker 1: There's small things Happening being said characters seeing each other, you know I think there are some chapters where like you see even though it's this you read one chapter And then you read.

620
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:34,037
Speaker 1: the next chapter has nothing to do with the one previous But you can see that aha these character was there right near the character.

621
00:36:34,117 --> 00:36:37,340
Speaker 1: the other character Yeah was doing something at the same time.

622
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:38,206
Speaker 1: It's like aha.

623
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:58,543
Speaker 1: they were in the same place in this small little city Right, and even though they didn't see each other or talk to each other But they show you that they were near each other at that exact moment in time these two events took place You know on the same exact street, right and that somehow, you know Maybe they bumped into each other if it didn't say anything or one person caused a thing that You know.

624
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:09,935
Speaker 1: was it, you know, you see if like someone trips and falls But then in the second in the next chapter they show you ah that actually happened because of this Yep, and you didn't know it uses the fact that you see everything like.

625
00:37:09,955 --> 00:37:15,140
Speaker 0: there's all this stuff around These statues and like one girl steals one to try to sell it.

626
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:18,520
Speaker 0: But then it's like when she tries to sell it it's worth way too much money.

627
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,965
Speaker 0: So she feels bad about stealing it.

628
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:21,872
Speaker 0: She puts it back, but then she breaks it.

629
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:37,319
Speaker 0: someone else talks later about her like, oh, yeah I've just been throwing those things away because like our friend my mom keeps sending them to us and I don't really care like There's a lot of jokes that are based on the fact that you know the true story of the thing that all these other people are interacting with.

630
00:37:38,721 --> 00:37:40,347
Speaker 0: So yeah, you should pick this up and read it.

631
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:45,506
Speaker 0: and if someone in the stream asked this is not at all similar to dr Slump, no, dr.

632
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:48,318
Speaker 0: Slump is much more simplistic.

633
00:37:48,378 --> 00:37:53,476
Speaker 0: humor Does not rely very much on timing and frankly i've read a lot of dr.

634
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:54,600
Speaker 0: Slump because I own it all.

635
00:37:55,761 --> 00:37:56,947
Speaker 0: Not actually that good.

636
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:57,550
Speaker 1: Well, dr.

637
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 1: Slump is made by the dragon ball guy.

638
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, toriyama it it's enjoyable, but it's not like.

639
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:03,693
Speaker 0: I like gin tama too.

640
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:04,837
Speaker 0: I think in tom is really funny.

641
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:12,160
Speaker 0: This is Both very different from gin tama and objectively superior to gin tama in terms of its comedy.

642
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:13,725
Speaker 0: I'd say the same thing.

643
00:38:13,765 --> 00:38:16,982
Speaker 0: This is objectively comedically superior to dr Slump.

644
00:38:17,102 --> 00:38:23,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the thing I like about city the most is that it's sort of less Uh zany and ridiculous, right?

645
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:30,015
Speaker 1: Even even if you look, you know, it's not completely unzany But like, you know nichijou is famous for like the goat wrestling.

646
00:38:30,035 --> 00:38:31,140
Speaker 1: Yep gift or whatever.

647
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:32,547
Speaker 1: Even I was among a guy.

648
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:35,220
Speaker 1: I was like chio chan's dad where it's like what the fuck?

649
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,388
Speaker 0: Well, that's just asaka dreaming right?

650
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,220
Speaker 1: But I mean the point is is that there's none of that in the city.

651
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,867
Speaker 1: It's much more down to earth.

652
00:38:43,108 --> 00:38:45,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's not a hundred percent realistic, but there's no.

653
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:48,351
Speaker 1: like Super things like.

654
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:49,980
Speaker 0: the zaniness is literally like I said.

655
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,600
Speaker 0: It is the level of zaniness that I actually for real encounter on a regular basis living in new york city.

656
00:38:57,244 --> 00:38:57,991
Speaker 0: So check this out.

657
00:38:58,052 --> 00:38:58,900
