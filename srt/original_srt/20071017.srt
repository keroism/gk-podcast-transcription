1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,906
Speaker 0: There's so much going on.

2
00:00:01,966 --> 00:00:04,494
Speaker 0: I mean I got new parts of my laptop.

3
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:06,280
Speaker 1: I've got like eight new things of the day.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,040
Speaker 0: There's like bunch of things of the day and newsies and it all everything's so great.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,696
Speaker 0: We got loads of show material, but we're not gonna use any of it.

6
00:00:14,836 --> 00:00:15,680
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,648
Speaker 0: No, we're holding on to everything.

8
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,440
Speaker 0: All the cards are firmly planted against the chest.

9
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,200
Speaker 0: Today is yet another day of ask Grim and Scott week.

10
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:29,018
Speaker 1: Listen to I don't know Tuesday October 16th or Monday October 15th.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:39,100
Speaker 1: And even if you don't like I don't know computers or video games or any of that I'd say listen to them anyway, because we've been getting more feedback about these episodes than from frickin anything else.

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:43,314
Speaker 0: Yep, all this week and perhaps even another week in the future.

13
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:51,095
Speaker 0: We are going to just answer listener questions, and that's all we're gonna do and Basically some of the the rules about this.

14
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:56,116
Speaker 0: first of all We are not going to give credit to who asked the question so none of that.

15
00:00:56,276 --> 00:00:58,365
Speaker 1: Joey Jojo Shabbat who writes.

16
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:05,013
Speaker 0: first of all that takes up a lot of time and second of all that really can affect the psychology of how we answer the question, so we just got rid of that.

17
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:18,620
Speaker 0: and Second of all, we're just gonna I don't know answer the questions perfectly literally like well, that's been Scott's thing Yeah, but I mean a lot of people ask questions, you know, and it's obvious what they really asking.

18
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:22,760
Speaker 0: But if I answer the question literally is just yes or no, and then that's not what they want.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,493
Speaker 1: So now also we're doing this from pieces of paper.

20
00:01:26,513 --> 00:01:28,560
Speaker 1: We don't have any like screens open in front of us.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:28,821
Speaker 1: We're.

22
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:38,072
Speaker 1: we're kind of running it like it's a radio talk show and people just called in and asked these questions other than Going through quickly to make sure everything in the list was actually a question.

23
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:39,858
Speaker 1: We didn't even read him ahead of time.

24
00:01:39,878 --> 00:01:49,612
Speaker 0: Nope So shall we begin because all yesterday and the day before it was like we only got through half the questions And I believe we're going to get through half the questions.

25
00:01:49,732 --> 00:01:52,665
Speaker 1: if that because there's a lot of them here, okay Well, let's get started.

26
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:55,260
Speaker 1: All right, so do you torrent any comics?

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,193
Speaker 1: I have torrented one comic in my life and that was death note.

28
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,020
Speaker 0: I didn't torrent death note.

29
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,350
Speaker 0: I guess I'm gonna direct.

30
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,784
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say I mean Obviously.

31
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:08,380
Speaker 1: they're using torrent in the generic sense of download of scans lation.

32
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:09,660
Speaker 0: I never use bit.

33
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:19,320
Speaker 0: Well, actually they could be specifically referring to torrents because I know that every week They put out torrents that had for example every Marvel and DC comic that came out this week and stuff like that.

34
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:21,560
Speaker 0: So no, I do not torrent any comics.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,617
Speaker 0: I buy comics with money on paper and I read webcomics that are supposed to be free online.

36
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:28,519
Speaker 0: and that's it.

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,700
Speaker 0: The only I read the scans lations of death note back in the day, but I own all of death note now.

38
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:35,495
Speaker 1: so I guess part of it was that one.

39
00:02:35,536 --> 00:02:40,654
Speaker 1: I E-readers aren't there yet and physical media are still better for reading comics.

40
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:46,738
Speaker 1: in my opinion and to Scans lations are often inaccurate kind of crappy in many times.

41
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:48,524
Speaker 1: three It's not like manga.

42
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,848
Speaker 1: is that much money for?

43
00:02:49,868 --> 00:02:57,737
Speaker 1: I haven't been excited enough about a manga since death note To actually want to go through the effort of reading it ahead of time instead of just waiting.

44
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:04,660
Speaker 0: Yep All right This one is only to rim but I think I'm gonna outlaw that and say everyone we both answer every quest.

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:05,804
Speaker 0: How come for Wednesday?

46
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:10,900
Speaker 1: a lot of our listeners asked questions just to us because I noticed the next one's the same way.

47
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:19,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that was might have been the same person asking both questions might have been anyway Rim, even though it's spelled wrong.

48
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:20,896
Speaker 1: How can you spell that wrong?

49
00:03:20,937 --> 00:03:23,169
Speaker 1: It's in the feed It's rims thing of the day.

50
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,859
Speaker 1: every day people email me.

51
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:30,300
Speaker 0: Anyway, who is your favorite character in all of comics including manga what you know, whatever all the comics?

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,180
Speaker 1: I would say that's kind of a crap question.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,718
Speaker 1: Yeah That's like asking who's your favorite character in a movie ever or in a novel ever?

54
00:03:37,738 --> 00:03:38,360
Speaker 1: where in that case?

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,184
Speaker 1: It's a cross between Horatio hornblower and the Count of Monte Cristo, but I digress In comics, I don't know.

56
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:49,280
Speaker 1: I I'd have to say it's a cross between Ozzie Mandias and Rasha.

57
00:03:50,403 --> 00:03:55,263
Speaker 0: It's also a good one It's.

58
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,314
Speaker 1: that kind of question is really hard to answer.

59
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,300
Speaker 1: I can just say characters.

60
00:03:58,461 --> 00:03:58,842
Speaker 1: I mean what?

61
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:08,080
Speaker 1: a character that I identified with the most a character that I thought was an interesting character Even though oftentimes I don't identify with at all or sometimes hate characters that I think are great.

62
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:14,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even have ryuk sure There whatever.

63
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:19,856
Speaker 1: so Scott if you were married with a child obviously a hypothetical question what?

64
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:23,700
Speaker 1: what anime character Would you be proud to name your child after?

65
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,160
Speaker 0: I'm not a freak so I wouldn't name my kid after an anime character.

66
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:32,056
Speaker 1: I think my answer is that if I had a child their middle name would be get her beam.

67
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,084
Speaker 0: get her beam Hurricane John.

68
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,308
Speaker 1: get her beam to cost her.

69
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:40,324
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I don't know Scott rust hurricane Ruben I don't know.

70
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:52,500
Speaker 1: when I was younger in my teens I often thought yeah if I ever have a kid their middle name is totally gonna be something from literature and I Guess you could include anime manga comics in that and I think you could draw a name from that sort of thing.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:52,902
Speaker 1: Well,

72
00:04:52,942 --> 00:05:08,468
Speaker 0: yeah, if I interpret this question differently into where I didn't actually have to name my child after an anime character But sort of an anime character that has qualities that I would like you know that I think are good and I would be proud if my Offspring grew up to be like that character Roger

73
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:08,789
Speaker 1: Smith.

74
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,394
Speaker 0: Roger Smith's a good one.

75
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:15,295
Speaker 1: Togusa is pretty good Misato, I just really like Misato.

76
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:15,958
Speaker 0: talk to me.

77
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:18,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz talk to me.

78
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,549
Speaker 1: He learns he gets better Those kinds of characters.

79
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:22,273
Speaker 0: I don't know.

80
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,439
Speaker 1: All right, let's move on.

81
00:05:24,363 --> 00:05:28,259
Speaker 0: If you had to pick up an underwear pervert title, which one would it be?

82
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,052
Speaker 1: I would be just be the amazing rim.

83
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:31,824
Speaker 0: the amazing rim I can't.

84
00:05:31,904 --> 00:05:32,709
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know.

85
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,327
Speaker 1: if I was a superhero my name would just be rim I wouldn't put anything in front of it.

86
00:05:36,427 --> 00:05:38,074
Speaker 0: Well, I'm currently purchasing.

87
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:47,696
Speaker 0: I think the only underwear pervert title I'm purchasing right now is Marvel Comics presents, which is a brand new series And it's one of those ones where it's not actually like a continuing thing.

88
00:05:47,756 --> 00:05:48,740
Speaker 0: It's like an anthology.

89
00:05:48,901 --> 00:06:02,547
Speaker 0: so it's like you get four random stories in it each each month and I always buy all those things because They never sell and they always go out of print and then they come up with a new one every few years and I'm the Only one who likes them apparently, but I love those things.

90
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:07,020
Speaker 0: There's random stories hit or miss random artists random writers.

91
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:08,046
Speaker 0: It's like whoo.

92
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,680
Speaker 0: It's like a total grab bag and I love that action.

93
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:19,905
Speaker 1: So I guess of all the underwear pervert literature in the known world it's either, you know Watchmen or Batman the animated series.

94
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:22,355
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they didn't say they said title.

95
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 1: so I'm going with Batman.

96
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, what they really mean is that like a title that's currently coming out and you know, which yeah I don't care Batman the animated series is like the best underwear pervert thing ever.

97
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:38,015
Speaker 0: It is and I tried to buy an issue of Batman strikes Which is sort of like the Batman the animated series a comic equivalent.

98
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:38,296
Speaker 0: It does.

99
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:39,019
Speaker 0: it doesn't measure up.

100
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:42,635
Speaker 0: Okay, have either of you seen the anime desert punk?

101
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,800
Speaker 0: I've heard of it, but I've never seen it.

102
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,697
Speaker 1: I've also heard of it and not seen it.

103
00:06:46,342 --> 00:06:50,019
Speaker 1: I thought for a second it was this other anime, but I don't think that's the one I'm thinking of.

104
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,214
Speaker 0: Nope Do you have any interest in any anime coming out next season?

105
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:55,900
Speaker 0: How about the season just passed?

106
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Speaker 1: Let's talk about just I don't know very very recent anime that we were excited about cuz I'd have to go with baccano.

107
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:02,744
Speaker 0: It's a good one.

108
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:03,728
Speaker 1: I'm really excited about.

109
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:03,928
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:07:03,948 --> 00:07:09,828
Speaker 0: So last season I would say baccano and this season I have yet to watch the first episode.

111
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:13,220
Speaker 0: but Gundam double-o might be the second coming of Gundam wings.

112
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,505
Speaker 0: So that could be good.

113
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:17,015
Speaker 1: or you're excited about it because you haven't seen it yet.

114
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:20,576
Speaker 1: That's happened before Show and then I don't know it's.

115
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:23,228
Speaker 0: I mean it's a Gundam show I haven't seen and it's not Gundam.

116
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:23,911
Speaker 0: see destiny.

117
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,680
Speaker 0: So there's a chance it could be good.

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,680
Speaker 0: And if there's a good Gundam show, hooray, if it's not, I'll just won't watch it.

119
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,463
Speaker 1: What was that show?

120
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:43,320
Speaker 1: we were all excited about because we didn't listen to Emily and we didn't realize it was the same show And it started out all Aboardage and samurai pirate fighting on the high seas and politics and then it turned into gay samurai and nothing more.

121
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:49,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was excited about that for the first five minutes and then it turned out to be like some BL thing.

122
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,329
Speaker 0: Yeah guy harem instead of a girl harem.

123
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,677
Speaker 1: It was a guy harem with all guys who like all guys.

124
00:07:54,697 --> 00:07:59,095
Speaker 0: All right What do you think of controversial or taboo subject?

125
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:00,100
Speaker 0: anime for example?

126
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:04,427
Speaker 0: kohikaze Or konomo no jinkan, which I've never heard of?

127
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,895
Speaker 1: I think I am all.

128
00:08:07,156 --> 00:08:17,867
Speaker 1: when it comes to any controversial media I'm always of the mind that one freedom speech people unless they actually harm people in the making of media, you know, like Then there's no it's a snuff film.

129
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:21,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, then there is nothing wrong with making it no matter what it is.

130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:32,003
Speaker 1: I don't think that any subject it that could possibly be conceived of it should be taboo in terms of Writing about it or expressing feelings or thoughts or ideas about it but at the same

131
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:38,183
Speaker 0: time has nothing to do with whether I'm going to like it or not or whether I think that other people Should watch it or not

132
00:08:38,323 --> 00:08:39,347
Speaker 1: at the same time.

133
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:43,260
Speaker 1: I feel free to form opinions about people who enjoy such media.

134
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,419
Speaker 0: I do as well.

135
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,968
Speaker 0: so it pretty much comes down to.

136
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:47,509
Speaker 0: I mean like.

137
00:08:47,951 --> 00:09:08,812
Speaker 0: it's like you could even pick any taboo subject like you know murder or genocide or something and you could you you could have genocide be the focus of a comic or an anime or a video game or movie or any any art form that you know story a narrative art form and You could do it tastefully or Tastelessly.

138
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:12,086
Speaker 0: and if you do it tastefully then it might be enjoyable.

139
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:18,150
Speaker 0: and if you do it tastelessly Then it's crap and I think anyone who you know enjoys it is a pretty terrible person.

140
00:09:18,412 --> 00:09:21,290
Speaker 1: Sometimes that goes over the line into hilarity.

141
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,594
Speaker 0: It sometimes does.

142
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:28,330
Speaker 0: so it pretty much comes down to whether you do it tastefully or not and that is sort of subjective.

143
00:09:28,571 --> 00:09:34,914
Speaker 0: But there seems to be some sort of societal agreement on what's tasteful and what's not for you know like you can have.

144
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:43,287
Speaker 0: you know you go to the art movie the art theater and you see a movie that happens to have a Sex scene in it and then you go to the porn theater and you just see you know hardcore banging.

145
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:44,070
Speaker 0: There's a difference.

146
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,013
Speaker 0: They're both sex.

147
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:49,730
Speaker 0: They're both rated X or whatever, but one of them's tasteful one of them's not.

148
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,141
Speaker 1: So, uh, what anime is your latest favorite?

149
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,450
Speaker 1: I'll assume that means just any anime not just new stuff.

150
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:06,686
Speaker 1: Well latest favorite my latest favorite right now is I'm finally finishing up Master Keaton And I'm finally finishing up gone kotsuo and they're both the business.

151
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,259
Speaker 0: I Haven't watched anime in a month or two.

152
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:10,881
Speaker 0: I don't think.

153
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,566
Speaker 1: in fact actually I'm.

154
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:19,030
Speaker 1: I mean I've only got four episodes left of Master Keaton and I'm really sad because I really really like that show.

155
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:22,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm probably gonna watch it on the train sooner or later.

156
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,893
Speaker 0: I beat the Zelda.

157
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:27,809
Speaker 1: the only problem with Master Keaton is that I feel as though it peaked early or may.

158
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:28,937
Speaker 1: I'm not sure we were.

159
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:35,630
Speaker 1: the seasons broke up in Japan But there's one episode called the Cali man of the desert and it happens about two-thirds the way through.

160
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,356
Speaker 1: I think it's episode 25 or 26.

161
00:10:36,356 --> 00:10:41,706
Speaker 1: I don't remember but Good God was that that could have been the Master Keaton movie.

162
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,002
Speaker 1: as far as I was concerned That was everything that makes that show awesome.

163
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:54,610
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, but moving on Let's see, oh what are your opinions of theatrical releases of anime in the US or elsewhere?

164
00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:56,981
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, I like it.

165
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:58,470
Speaker 0: when they put anime in a movie theater.

166
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,970
Speaker 0: It's one of the few times I'll actually get off my ass and maybe go to the movie theater depending on the end.

167
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,710
Speaker 1: I've caught almost every major anime release in the last several years.

168
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:08,469
Speaker 1: I missed one in particular, but I caught it.

169
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:20,889
Speaker 0: I didn't even I got to tell you I didn't even realize the concept of anime in the theater until I think 1992 thousand when I was in Israel and Princess Mononoke was in the theater there with you know Like English with Hebrew subtitles or something like that.

170
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:22,590
Speaker 0: I didn't actually go see it there.

171
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:27,959
Speaker 0: but I saw the movie poster and I was like, oh and some other guy on the trip had seen it and he was raving about it the whole time.

172
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,780
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I like it when they put anime in the theater.

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,904
Speaker 0: I go see it.

174
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,310
Speaker 0: What what other opinion do you want?

175
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,693
Speaker 0: I don't know.

176
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,470
Speaker 1: I mean, it's great seeing I think.

177
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:42,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that they should market it more heavily and put it in more theaters and they're like, oh No one goes to see it.

178
00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:43,769
Speaker 0: The theaters is in our pact.

179
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,986
Speaker 0: You just had to push it out more and then more people will see it.

180
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:54,330
Speaker 0: It's like come on Yeah, I mean you take the sales in the theaters It's in and multiply them by you know, the number of theaters in a wide release.

181
00:11:55,171 --> 00:12:02,762
Speaker 1: That's a lot more money than they actually make especially considering that they don't promote anime in theaters for shit And it wouldn't cost that much to do it.

182
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:10,866
Speaker 0: and I and it's not like oh I just want you gotta do is put like the ad in the newspaper Right in the you know in the movie section that says come see this movie.

183
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:22,113
Speaker 0: What a bunch of awards Yeah, and you buy show time you buy a couple of reviews and local papers That's really cheap and then you freaking put like a commercial on TV during like the local news at night like for a week I don't know.

184
00:12:22,153 --> 00:12:36,741
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into our opinions on the anime industry in general, but I just think that I Get the impression that most of the American anime industry is won by old school anime fans or new school anime fans And they don't seem to have much business sense at all.

185
00:12:37,163 --> 00:12:43,902
Speaker 1: and while maybe oh, it's a labor of love They just want this stuff to come out at the same time They're not really doing anything to spread the genre.

186
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:47,192
Speaker 1: well not the genre the medium yep Alright.

187
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:48,737
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a good one for Scott.

188
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:50,602
Speaker 1: What comic publishing company.

189
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:53,410
Speaker 1: Do you believe most reliably produces the best content?

190
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,870
Speaker 0: This is a hard question right here because there are a lot of things like I could say vertigo.

191
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,678
Speaker 0: But the problem is vertigo is not a publishing company.

192
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,570
Speaker 0: vertigo is actually an imprint which means it's DC Comics.

193
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,781
Speaker 0: They just put a different label to separate those from the DC Comics.

194
00:13:08,243 --> 00:13:10,210
Speaker 0: so pretty much most vertigo comics are awesome.

195
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,896
Speaker 0: But that's not a publishing company.

196
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:12,638
Speaker 0: It's an imprint.

197
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,841
Speaker 0: so publishing company if you're talking about reliability We have to go by percentage.

198
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,175
Speaker 0: like the percentage of the stuff They put out that's quality.

199
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:24,754
Speaker 0: so if a company came out with one comic, and it was high quality Then they're the winner.

200
00:13:24,794 --> 00:13:29,450
Speaker 0: they got a hundred percent versus someone other company that puts out a hundred things and 99 of them are good.

201
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:33,009
Speaker 0: Then they're not the most reliable even though they put out more good stuff.

202
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:36,321
Speaker 0: So most reliably produces the best content.

203
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:41,617
Speaker 0: well the one that I know for sure is Reliable is vertical not vertigo.

204
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:45,730
Speaker 0: vertical incorporated, which is actually not strictly a comic publisher.

205
00:13:46,253 --> 00:13:47,419
Speaker 0: They are a book.

206
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:54,470
Speaker 0: basically they publish Japanese books in English But they're putting out all the Tezuka and the keiko Takami, and they never put out anything bad ever.

207
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:57,190
Speaker 0: It's a hundred percent across the board so vertical incorporated.

208
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:03,890
Speaker 0: But there's a chance that red five comics could be the second hundred percent comic publisher.

209
00:14:04,332 --> 00:14:12,928
Speaker 0: they are putting out the atom robo and such you know by the Brian clevenger of 8-bit theater fame, so you should buy that at the style of that.

210
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:19,629
Speaker 0: I mean It's already in the stores now if you want it But it's coming for me at the end of the month, and I liked 8-bit theater a lot.

211
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,279
Speaker 1: But goddamn is that comic exactly what I want?

212
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:30,039
Speaker 0: imagine like Indiana Jones more badass and a robot a cool robot But not not wise kraken robot.

213
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:32,990
Speaker 1: you're imagining a robot, and you're not imagining the right kind of row.

214
00:14:33,994 --> 00:14:37,970
Speaker 1: And this is pretty much almost the same spider-man plus, Indiana Jones plus robot.

215
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:41,800
Speaker 1: Which comic book author is most reliably involved in the best project?

216
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,702
Speaker 1: so Samu Tezuka.

217
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,527
Speaker 0: some with Tezuka, but he's dead.

218
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:50,905
Speaker 0: so living Brian cave on Brian cave on he can write no wrong all right good now.

219
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:52,069
Speaker 1: You can do this really long one.

220
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:58,008
Speaker 0: During the last 10 years the rate at which comic books are being adapted to an audio visual media is increased in the audience.

221
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:58,989
Speaker 0: consumption is grown.

222
00:14:59,552 --> 00:15:01,441
Speaker 0: EG spider-man x-men to prevent that etc.

223
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,430
Speaker 1: correct use of eg good job.

224
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:06,590
Speaker 0: Do you think this signifies a change on the product side of audio-visual?

225
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,537
Speaker 0: Entertainment on the consumption side of it.

226
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:13,196
Speaker 0: if those in charge of audio-visual entertainment keep producing comic book movies Well the audience keep watching it.

227
00:15:13,277 --> 00:15:14,843
Speaker 0: or will they get bored and move on to the next fag?

228
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:15,225
Speaker 1: well.

229
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:19,465
Speaker 1: I point out that spider-man 3 and x-men 3 didn't do so.

230
00:15:19,505 --> 00:15:20,389
Speaker 1: well and we're crap.

231
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:31,332
Speaker 0: I Want to point out that the only thing the only thing that is to be learned from all these comic book movies Is that you know we used to think we used to joke about like all Hollywood's run out of ideas They keep putting out.

232
00:15:31,352 --> 00:15:33,539
Speaker 0: see no they've really run out of ideas.

233
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,221
Speaker 0: They're basically.

234
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:35,645
Speaker 0: Hollywood has no writers left.

235
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:41,802
Speaker 0: They can't come up with a single Interesting or new movie plot or script.

236
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,430
Speaker 0: or you know whether they call it screenplay.

237
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:46,041
Speaker 0: I mean you don't have any of them.

238
00:15:46,082 --> 00:15:49,679
Speaker 0: there are exceptions I think very few compared to what it used to be.

239
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,430
Speaker 1: I think the I mean I wouldn't go quite that far.

240
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,977
Speaker 1: But I would say that I think the general problem is that the Hollywood industry is as it has been at many points in its Existence very risk-averse right now.

241
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:01,722
Speaker 0: Yep, so they're just.

242
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:02,424
Speaker 0: you know it's.

243
00:16:02,604 --> 00:16:16,870
Speaker 0: it's relatively easy to Adapt say a comic to a movie than it is to adapt say a book to a movie because you already sort of have like these Storyboards done for you and stuff like that and you could even do like a Sin City job where it's like a direct translation.

244
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,639
Speaker 0: You know so it's.

245
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:20,970
Speaker 0: it's very you know Hollywood people.

246
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,969
Speaker 0: They like to turn comics into movies and they're optioning comics to turn into movies all the time And it's proven to be a success in the past.

247
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:32,173
Speaker 0: So if it's proven to be a success in the past they want to take a risk on doing something else like writing a brand New screenplay.

248
00:16:32,454 --> 00:16:35,907
Speaker 0: they'll do something that they at least know has kind of worked in the past.

249
00:16:36,067 --> 00:16:39,440
Speaker 1: plus remember Normal like most people out there the audiences.

250
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:41,790
Speaker 1: They don't know that V for Vendetta was a comic.

251
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,861
Speaker 1: They don't know that yeah, he was a comic.

252
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,055
Speaker 1: No one knows that 300 was a comic.

253
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:52,145
Speaker 0: yeah They might say you know on the the movie poster like based on the graphic novel.

254
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,510
Speaker 1: or no one looks at that.

255
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,230
Speaker 0: They might you know in the bookstore people might see it.

256
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,786
Speaker 0: But the vast majority of people have no idea Like even if you put it right in front of their face like what to say V for Vendetta.

257
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:05,336
Speaker 0: right right at the beginning of V for Vendetta it says DC Comics.

258
00:17:05,898 --> 00:17:08,690
Speaker 0: most people you say hey V for Vendetta like oh, yeah, that was a good movie.

259
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:10,175
Speaker 0: They don't even know this fucking comic.

260
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:10,958
Speaker 0: They don't know Alan Morris.

261
00:17:10,978 --> 00:17:11,621
Speaker 0: They don't know anything.

262
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:14,009
Speaker 0: so Hollywood people are just gonna milk it.

263
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:20,349
Speaker 1: So anime in the HD DVD blu-ray versus the DVD format worthwhile or not?

264
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:27,127
Speaker 0: Well first of all I mean, I'm not I'm asking a question here I don't know, but how many anime were actually made in HD?

265
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,750
Speaker 0: I mean if the anime is not made in HD like I don't know Akira.

266
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:43,339
Speaker 0: well Akira was made on film so you could transfer that to HD, but Say what an old anime that wasn't made on film for the movie theater say initial D Initial D is not gonna do any bad.

267
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:45,129
Speaker 1: initial D would look like shit in HD.

268
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:47,298
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I like initial D.

269
00:17:47,318 --> 00:17:50,050
Speaker 0: Hey Eric, how I bebop can I bebop wouldn't do so well in HD.

270
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:51,917
Speaker 0: It's made for a TV screen.

271
00:17:51,977 --> 00:17:52,961
Speaker 0: It's not widescreen.

272
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:53,563
Speaker 0: It's not HD.

273
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,076
Speaker 0: It's it's just normal Resolution whatever.

274
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,590
Speaker 0: well putting it on an HD DVD isn't gonna help it out.

275
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:02,338
Speaker 1: I watched some of the Bandai visual like.

276
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:04,264
Speaker 1: check out how high quality this stuff is.

277
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,868
Speaker 0: oh yeah, see that was freedom They were showing.

278
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:10,720
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is what is made in age.

279
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:18,029
Speaker 1: what I'm saying before you interrupted me is that yeah I watched some of that stuff, and you know what it didn't really look much better than.

280
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:22,050
Speaker 1: There's no reason to buy anime on an HD DVD.

281
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:30,613
Speaker 0: I mean we watched freedom right the first episode on a downloaded fan sub so even less than DVD quality and still look pretty Fucking amazing.

282
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:40,130
Speaker 0: I mean it was more amazing admittedly on the HD TV from the you know at Otakon But not worth the price of an HD DVD player an HD.

283
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:41,900
Speaker 1: Well look at this an HD TV.

284
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,159
Speaker 1: unless you had them side by side You would not be able to tell.

285
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,890
Speaker 1: and it's just for anime of course I don't think it's even worthwhile for movies me there let alone for and then the price comes way down.

286
00:18:52,251 --> 00:18:54,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially since anime attempts to be a lot simpler.

287
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,693
Speaker 1: You know cell shading that sort of thing It's not.

288
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,628
Speaker 1: it's not the kind of thing that's gonna be benefited in any way.

289
00:19:00,111 --> 00:19:03,007
Speaker 0: Yep, except well freedom is actually like one of the.

290
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:06,081
Speaker 0: you know If there's an anime that's gonna benefit that's gonna be.

291
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,788
Speaker 1: yeah, but what I was saying was that didn't really.

292
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:07,869
Speaker 1: yep.

293
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,281
Speaker 0: Okay Why is the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is so popular.

294
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,090
Speaker 1: and what is Haruism all right for the first part?

295
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:16,812
Speaker 1: It's.

296
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:19,346
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it yet, but a lot of my friends have and I've read about it.

297
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,089
Speaker 1: I want to see it.

298
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:23,390
Speaker 1: It's just a really clever funny good show that's well animated

299
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:33,646
Speaker 0: And I think it's a show from what I've heard that is sort of you know made to like target the fans Right at the core the same way that you know a lot of video games like just they.

300
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:37,037
Speaker 0: they know their audience And they go straight for it with everything.

301
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:37,579
Speaker 0: They've got.

302
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:37,880
Speaker 0: you know.

303
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,307
Speaker 0: this show is like we know what otaku like.

304
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:44,961
Speaker 0: let's stroke Every part of them that likes to be stroked and this show does it.

305
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,190
Speaker 1: so in terms of what is hurry ism?

306
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,990
Speaker 1: And I've also seen it written as Haruhi ism now the same as Naruto ism only for Haruhi.

307
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:59,963
Speaker 1: I mean I've seen a lot of people trying to make it out to be something more, but and Unless there's some academic dissertation.

308
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:09,909
Speaker 1: I'm missing from what I can gather It's just one of those memes yeah where people kind of worship Haruhi in this kind of funny way And it looks very 4chan-y, and that's all I really have to say about that.

309
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:14,270
Speaker 1: So can you actually get caught torrenting anime?

310
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:22,812
Speaker 0: Well the first question is a technological question for Monday, which is yeah, you actually get caught torrenting anything which Technologically?

311
00:20:22,832 --> 00:20:36,490
Speaker 0: yes, there are things you can do to make it harder for anyone to to create reasonable doubt as to whether you were Torrenting or not and what you were torrenting and stuff like that including encryption and proxies and who knows what or even just reason.

312
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:38,078
Speaker 1: I mean getting caught is not the thing.

313
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:41,333
Speaker 1: what I think you really mean is could there be any Consequences?

314
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:47,681
Speaker 1: and it depends on if you were torrenting something that has been released in the United States yet Or not and it depends who is watching.

315
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,650
Speaker 0: for example there have been in the past.

316
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:57,230
Speaker 0: I think the closest people have come to dangerous situations is when Bandai Japan said do not pirate solid-state society.

317
00:20:57,331 --> 00:20:58,119
Speaker 0: We will come get you.

318
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:10,229
Speaker 1: do not fansub it but even then there's not much they could have done because being sued by a Japanese company when you're US citizen and Getting get them getting to the point where they can identify you from an IP and all that.

319
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:15,426
Speaker 1: I'm not a lawyer, but it seems highly unlikely it is.

320
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:16,750
Speaker 0: there is not nothing.

321
00:21:16,931 --> 00:21:17,513
Speaker 0: It's not like.

322
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:28,530
Speaker 0: I can't say there's nothing to worry about, but if you just pay attention to anime news a Come at least the current the current situation Companies will make a threat before they do anything.

323
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:29,434
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there's.

324
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,482
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure there's nothing to worry about at all.

325
00:21:31,522 --> 00:21:36,922
Speaker 1: the only time you would need to worry is if you Were torrenting or pirating things that have been released in the u.s..

326
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,050
Speaker 0: Straight torrent fansubs and anime ski.

327
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:42,461
Speaker 0: I would say you're 99% safe if you're torrenting trigon.

328
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:44,969
Speaker 1: well one you shouldn't be torrenting trigon and two.

329
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,674
Speaker 1: Well yeah, that's it.

330
00:21:46,714 --> 00:21:47,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, you deserve what you get.

331
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,310
Speaker 0: all right does the definition of anime include made in Japan?

332
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,290
Speaker 0: I can something be made in the US and be accepted as an anime?

333
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:55,892
Speaker 0: You know what?

334
00:21:55,952 --> 00:22:08,366
Speaker 1: I don't care about this anymore because there's there's two camps, and they're mutually exclusive and on one side They're the anime world order types who say by definition It is anime if it is animated and from the nation of Japan.

335
00:22:08,787 --> 00:22:14,810
Speaker 1: and on the other side There's people who say yeah, it's just anything animated that looks like that or it's just anything animated at all.

336
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:15,553
Speaker 0: But then what if some?

337
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:23,756
Speaker 0: there's a lot of things that are made you know for Japan like look crayon Shin-chan doesn't look like anime style But that's an anime or even even better.

338
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:29,150
Speaker 1: the word anime or anime is a French word that just means animation.

339
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:34,210
Speaker 0: Well and also the word is you know animation and they just shorten it to anime.

340
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:35,073
Speaker 1: But even better.

341
00:22:35,194 --> 00:22:39,390
Speaker 1: in Japan from what I gather they call a lot pretty much anything animated.

342
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Simpsons.

343
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:42,889
Speaker 0: if you go to Japan and you say is the Simpsons an anime?

344
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:49,872
Speaker 0: They would say yes, the Simpsons is an anime because they don't have a different word for something from their country and something from another Country.

345
00:22:49,893 --> 00:22:56,079
Speaker 0: they just use the word anime for all Animation whether it's movies or TV or from whatever country.

346
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,186
Speaker 0: the only reason we use the word anime is because we like to make a Difference between things that come from our country and things that come from.

347
00:23:03,206 --> 00:23:10,069
Speaker 1: well actually no I was going to say because I noticed that this didn't really happen with French animation It's just with Japanese stuff.

348
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:20,250
Speaker 1: And I think the reason is that for most anime fans when they saw anime It was just in general what they saw was very very different from American media.

349
00:23:20,571 --> 00:23:31,090
Speaker 1: the stories were just very different and a lot anime seemed like a genre to a lot of early fans just because The storytelling was a lot different the visualization was a lot different.

350
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,372
Speaker 1: It was.

351
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:44,590
Speaker 1: it was better in a lot of people's eyes And they kind of associated all those things that they saw in anime as this kind of Overarching genre and this is why these people became anime fans rather than fans of animation from around the world in general.

352
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:51,690
Speaker 1: So the real answer is that it doesn't matter at all And if you ever argue with someone over whether something is anime or not you really need to get a life.

353
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:58,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean just if you want call everything animation or start calling the Simpsons anime if you want to be really Japanese.

354
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:14,103
Speaker 0: but I guess the only thing I have to say is that as As I like words to be useful, and if we have words You know I like to give them the definition that makes the most sense in terms of using them in ways that make Conversation easier and allow communication to be you know facilitated.

355
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:15,910
Speaker 1: for example the argument over.

356
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:20,109
Speaker 1: You know they decided that Pluto is no longer a planet and there were people who?

357
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,430
Speaker 1: Protested this and I think all of those people are categorically stupid.

358
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:32,670
Speaker 1: yeah, because the reason Pluto is no longer a planet is because we've realized that there's a bit a bunch of things that are Bigger than Pluto or the same size as Pluto out there.

359
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:41,619
Speaker 1: And if we call Pluto a planet then we either have to call all those things planets too or the word planet now means dick Yep, so I like words to have to be useful.

360
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:46,336
Speaker 0: so speaking that we speak the English language and not the Japanese language I think in English.

361
00:24:46,436 --> 00:24:49,288
Speaker 0: You know we've taken a lot of foreign words like croissant.

362
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,310
Speaker 0: right We don't say hooked roll or something like that.

363
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:54,419
Speaker 0: You know it's much easier to say croissant.

364
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:02,150
Speaker 0: so we can take words from other countries like Anime and use them for our own purposes, and I think for the purposes of usefulness in language.

365
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:12,007
Speaker 0: I think it is good to use the word anime to mean Animation from Japan or for Japanese audience is the most useful way to use the term and that's what I use it for.

366
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:16,210
Speaker 0: but whatever Like if someone says I'm not gonna get hung up about it and go crazy.

367
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,700
Speaker 1: Well like a lot of people say oh avatar is very anime isher.

368
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,783
Speaker 1: It's very much like anime.

369
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:23,130
Speaker 1: You know what that's kind of true?

370
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:31,170
Speaker 1: It's a lot of the elements of avatar are very similar to a lot of elements commonly seen in Japanese animation.

371
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there in fact.

372
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:37,636
Speaker 1: I ran into a kid while I was at work, and he was playing the Naruto game And I just started to talk to him.

373
00:25:37,676 --> 00:25:38,721
Speaker 1: He's a little kid, and I was like.

374
00:25:38,762 --> 00:25:40,793
Speaker 1: so uh what other cartoons he like?

375
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:48,442
Speaker 1: he's like yeah, Naruto and One Piece and Avatar and he considered all three of those to be anime from Japan.

376
00:25:48,803 --> 00:25:52,234
Speaker 1: and when I told him that avatar was made in the US He didn't believe me.

377
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:52,897
Speaker 1: He's like Americans.

378
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:53,941
Speaker 1: Can't do something that good.

379
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:56,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just found that funny.

380
00:25:56,531 --> 00:26:02,717
Speaker 1: Yep, all right, so if more anime could go in the direction that music has been ie Downloadable for a fee.

381
00:26:02,818 --> 00:26:04,869
Speaker 1: again good use of ie correct mm-hmm?

382
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:08,061
Speaker 1: What do you believe would be the most profitable price per episode?

383
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:08,221
Speaker 1: well?

384
00:26:08,242 --> 00:26:13,798
Speaker 1: Let's see 26 episodes in an average series 2 bucks It's close.

385
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:20,570
Speaker 0: I think right now I'm willing to pay like 40 bucks for a thin pack of a 26 episode thing, but I'm getting DVDs.

386
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:23,528
Speaker 0: So it's gotta be less than 40 bucks for 26 episodes I don't know.

387
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:30,808
Speaker 1: I'd almost be willing to pay a little bit more for the convenience and the fact that I can watch it as it comes out And I don't have to deal with physical media, which I'm getting more and more sick of.

388
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,194
Speaker 0: I don't like.

389
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,301
Speaker 0: I see I would like see.

390
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:38,830
Speaker 0: actually here you go ready per episode basis.

391
00:26:39,311 --> 00:26:40,856
Speaker 0: I say five bucks an episode.

392
00:26:40,936 --> 00:26:47,566
Speaker 0: right, but first episode is always free and you can pay 40 bucks to get the whole season.

393
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,423
Speaker 1: well I'll go one step further and say I'll say that I don't buy anime and it's.

394
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,754
Speaker 0: and I'm yeah Netflix it all right That's the thing.

395
00:26:54,277 --> 00:26:54,720
Speaker 1: I'm fee.

396
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,585
Speaker 1: I'm getting to the point.

397
00:26:55,645 --> 00:27:06,581
Speaker 1: and it's not just anime It's all media other than video games because it doesn't really work with video games, but for all like movies and of any kind I have no desire to buy anything ever.

398
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:11,570
Speaker 1: and the idea of buying a DVD is Kind of important to me because it's just like I don't like face.

399
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:16,913
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't like owning things you know taking up physical space in my house not even that even Digitally.

400
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:21,450
Speaker 0: if I'm gonna watch it once why should I pay to keep it around on a hard drive somewhere?

401
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,473
Speaker 1: You know I'm just.

402
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:26,910
Speaker 1: I'm of the mind that I would I would pay to be able to rent digitally anime.

403
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:32,550
Speaker 1: The problem is renting is the same as owning unless you add DRM, but you know what if anime were digital?

404
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,769
Speaker 1: I'd probably buy it if it was cheap enough and then delete it.

405
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:43,250
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's got to be the basically this the equivalent price of Netflix in the series and then Watch him and then delete them.

406
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:45,036
Speaker 1: I mean I only buy anything.

407
00:27:45,176 --> 00:27:48,969
Speaker 0: well any you know DVD if it's but I do want to be able to download if I'm.

408
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:59,176
Speaker 0: if They're technically saying that I own them I won't be able to download it again Whenever I want in case I want to show a friend or something or in the very least if it's no DRM So I can back it up.

409
00:27:59,236 --> 00:27:59,518
Speaker 1: However.

410
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:01,189
Speaker 1: I want yep, okay?

411
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:04,216
Speaker 0: Why do anime?

412
00:28:04,336 --> 00:28:07,389
Speaker 0: opening song lyrics never make any sense?

413
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:18,863
Speaker 1: All right well part of that is that most of what you're thinking about is either Engrish II kind of openings like the opener to Nana Which is just any time.

414
00:28:18,883 --> 00:28:26,594
Speaker 1: a lot of Japanese songs Just kind of do that and a lot of times the lyrics don't make any sense particularly in just you know pop music and Sadly a lot of j-rock.

415
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:32,129
Speaker 0: wait listen think about some songs in the u.s.. Right like some Britney Spears song.

416
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,939
Speaker 0: no No, no like songs that really they're.

417
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,082
Speaker 0: they're concentrating on the.

418
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:44,477
Speaker 0: what the lyrics are is is the primary thing in the music Comes second right like for example Christian music or you know things like that.

419
00:28:44,517 --> 00:28:49,151
Speaker 0: where they really want to put they already figured out the words first and the music Second.

420
00:28:49,252 --> 00:29:05,014
Speaker 0: so what ends up happening is the music sort of suffers and the the words they have to sort of gimmick the words around And like add in like syllables here and there to make it sound right and not be stupid or impossible to sing Anime music.

421
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:14,210
Speaker 0: what they tend to do is rather than worry about what they're saying first and foremost They actually worry about the music first and foremost and as a result the lyrics often.

422
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:25,098
Speaker 1: Actually, I was going to say that a lot of anime put out in the late 80s and 90s had openers that were basically just pop Songs sometimes semi-popular pop song.

423
00:29:25,118 --> 00:29:34,870
Speaker 1: that also or song is that they were trying to then make popular and like for example The opener to Dominion Tank Police in Japan is crap pop nothing.

424
00:29:35,353 --> 00:29:44,093
Speaker 1: I kind of like the song since every move I like the song actually like it's kind of a guy could listen to it, but How did you know?

425
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:57,670
Speaker 0: it's that I was also a problem of Japanese people writing a song in English because the English sounds cool Not because they know what the English means all the time, but there are a lot of Anime songs openers and closers where the lyrics like for example gone kotsuo.

426
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:00,736
Speaker 0: That's written by a French guy.

427
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even Jean-Jacques.

428
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,264
Speaker 1: What's his name Jean-Jacques?

429
00:30:03,304 --> 00:30:03,886
Speaker 0: better now?

430
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:04,388
Speaker 0: Yes.

431
00:30:04,729 --> 00:30:11,069
Speaker 1: Yes But listen to that song and the lyrics are basically here's the plot of the count of Monte Cristo.

432
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:13,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's a he's a very famous song.

433
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:21,658
Speaker 1: Yes, our Utena is an example or it doesn't matter not so much the opener because actually the openings a day But the opening song to Utena.

434
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,370
Speaker 1: actually the lyrics like they kind of fit.

435
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:30,565
Speaker 1: They don't fit perfectly But they kind of make sense in the way that most pop kind of songs make sense.

436
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:35,529
Speaker 1: and the dual music Usually doesn't mean much but at the same time it sounds really cool.

437
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,829
Speaker 1: All right, I don't have anything else to say.

438
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:42,810
Speaker 1: What is the average production value of an anime movie and series per episode?

439
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:45,123
Speaker 0: No idea if I know millions of dollars.

440
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,310
Speaker 0: it depends on the show.

441
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:49,381
Speaker 0: I mean some shows are stupidly cheap and they spend nothing on them.

442
00:30:49,421 --> 00:30:52,592
Speaker 0: and some shows they spend a zillion dollars on like goes In the shell.

443
00:30:52,612 --> 00:30:57,010
Speaker 0: and some shows some movies are stupidly cheap and some cost a zillion dollars.

444
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:05,740
Speaker 1: It's and that's not even getting into the cost of you know, releasing things in America where no one ever says anything The cost of marketing or producing merchandise or all the.

445
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,084
Speaker 0: you know millions of dollars.

446
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:09,110
Speaker 0: There you go five bucks.

447
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:11,457
Speaker 0: Why is CG used in anime?

448
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,644
Speaker 0: anything that is CG seems that it can be drawn.

449
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,450
Speaker 0: instead you say that about anything.

450
00:31:15,693 --> 00:31:24,749
Speaker 0: Okay, first of all, right You know, you look you're watching an anime and you'll you'll say oh that looks like CG, you know Cuz it'll be like some 3d battleship or something like that.

451
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,913
Speaker 0: Do you realize that?

452
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:32,294
Speaker 0: no no anime that you watch nowadays except for Sazae-san is Animated on cells.

453
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:38,457
Speaker 0: everything is done entirely with computers full metal alchemist whole things computers Hara hey, Susan, man whole thing is computers.

454
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:39,802
Speaker 0: It's all CG.

455
00:31:39,862 --> 00:31:41,246
Speaker 0: The 2d is CG.

456
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:42,269
Speaker 0: Everything is CG.

457
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:46,869
Speaker 0: So I think what you're all you're noticing is the 3d stuff that looks different than the 2d.

458
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,336
Speaker 1: So and there are two reasons.

459
00:31:48,537 --> 00:31:56,470
Speaker 1: one a lot of times especially in a lower budget show It's a lot if something's three-dimensional or has to move three-dimensionally like really three-dimensionally.

460
00:31:57,132 --> 00:32:00,687
Speaker 1: It's a lot cheaper to make some CG than it is to animate that.

461
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:08,099
Speaker 0: Yep But if you watch some of the higher production value shows say goes in the shell The 3d looks 2d.

462
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,366
Speaker 0: You won't even notice that this 3d there.

463
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,190
Speaker 0: It's so subtle because they spend a lot more money on their technology.

464
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,409
Speaker 0: So the real thing you basically you're saying is I don't like it when they don't spend enough money on their 3d.

465
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,354
Speaker 0: And I agree if someone's gonna put 3d in their anime Why you know?

466
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:29,281
Speaker 0: you should just spend more money on it to make it look right and not stand out like a sore thumb like A Scooby-doo, it's bet you're better off doing a 2d.

467
00:32:29,342 --> 00:32:31,190
Speaker 0: if you don't, you know, huh right along those lines.

468
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,020
Speaker 1: What is your opinion on CG animation in an anime?

469
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,010
Speaker 0: aesthetic wise I like it when it doesn't Scooby-doo.

470
00:32:37,451 --> 00:32:39,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean some shows use it really well.

471
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:46,005
Speaker 1: some shows are initially some yeah PlayStation 1 graphics for the win All right.

472
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:51,267
Speaker 0: In what ways is a manga better or worse than a novel counterpart?

473
00:32:51,347 --> 00:32:52,010
Speaker 0: on the same note?

474
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,710
Speaker 0: What are the dis and advantages of an anime versus live-action?

475
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:01,170
Speaker 1: You know, I could give a long complicated answer and I have a lot to say but it really just comes down to.

476
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:04,038
Speaker 1: It's a different medium and different me.

477
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:06,145
Speaker 0: It's like saying how's this painting?

478
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:07,990
Speaker 0: How would this painting do in sculpture?

479
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,743
Speaker 1: How would this painting do in scrimshaw?

480
00:33:11,065 --> 00:33:11,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, how would this?

481
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:19,476
Speaker 1: needle point do in a live-action Musical with children's choir?

482
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:20,259
Speaker 0: exactly.

483
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:23,129
Speaker 0: It's like there's different mediums of art.

484
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:37,064
Speaker 0: You can express yourself in different ways, you know with with ink on paper with oil on canvas with Limestone on chisel whatever and There's different things to know about each medium and they're all different.

485
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:40,681
Speaker 0: and there's a dissident Advantages to all of them and there's.

486
00:33:40,741 --> 00:33:42,170
Speaker 0: none of them are better or worse.

487
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:43,154
Speaker 0: I did any other.

488
00:33:43,395 --> 00:33:45,706
Speaker 1: I mean I could say cuz I there's a lot of things to say.

489
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:47,393
Speaker 1: just papercraft I just think it.

490
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:49,521
Speaker 1: it wouldn't be interesting to go through all the.

491
00:33:49,882 --> 00:34:02,467
Speaker 1: well in manga you get to Visually make the frame and make the scene but in a novel you have to describe it and leave it up to the imagination Whatever and not going to go and describe the difference of every artistic medium ever.

492
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:03,130
Speaker 0: there's a lot of them.

493
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,410
Speaker 1: Why do you think people generally look down on cartoons anime, whatever?

494
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:19,510
Speaker 1: In Japan, I mean, it's not like everyone watches the ghost in the shell anime or anything But it's generally kind of an American thing where cartoons are kind of looked down upon.

495
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:23,103
Speaker 0: Yeah in Scandinavian countries Donald Duck is the business.

496
00:34:23,565 --> 00:34:24,710
Speaker 1: I should live in Scandinavia.

497
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:26,678
Speaker 1: Everything's telling me to move there.

498
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:27,219
Speaker 0: I know.

499
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,670
Speaker 0: however, you know, it's pretty much in America.

500
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:36,118
Speaker 0: we have had a culture and because of things like the Comics Code Authority and censorship on television.

501
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:53,165
Speaker 0: and you know animation and comics and those sorts of things were generally relegated and Culturally assumed to be mediums of art in which you could only create art For the enjoyment of by children and not for any other demographics.

502
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:55,393
Speaker 0: and of course, that's false Completely.

503
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:59,190
Speaker 0: you can mix you can appeal to any target demographic in any artistic medium.

504
00:34:59,592 --> 00:35:02,986
Speaker 0: You can make paper craft for one-year-olds paper craft for million-year-olds.

505
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:03,669
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

506
00:35:04,793 --> 00:35:14,526
Speaker 0: but because that was the way it was for so long and because that was the you know, The impression people had and sort of the the dogma of the society it stuck around.

507
00:35:14,587 --> 00:35:27,650
Speaker 0: and now the old people Pretty much anyone 30 and older and even people younger than that even little kids Nowadays, you know, they think that cartoons are for kids and some things are breaking that like Adult Swim, you know.

508
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:35,382
Speaker 1: But at the same time that's why a lot of your 13 year old girls are reading scary hardcore reality and their mom has no idea.

509
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:43,102
Speaker 0: Yep, so Yeah, as soon as you know Pretty much when the old people die that will be a thing of the past.

510
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:49,890
Speaker 1: I just there's a related question right here How do you how would you change cartoons anime whatever so that they would be taken more seriously?

511
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:52,186
Speaker 1: One I wouldn't I wouldn't even bother to.

512
00:35:52,227 --> 00:35:52,670
Speaker 1: I don't care.

513
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,930
Speaker 0: The only way you could do it is with a massive expensive PR campaign.

514
00:35:57,111 --> 00:35:59,501
Speaker 1: Well, no, I think it's the question really hits upon this.

515
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:11,667
Speaker 1: a lot of people who have like a we It's almost like a lot of we and anime people have this almost inferiority complex of my thing is serious business and the world's got to take my business seriously.

516
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,372
Speaker 1: and I got to get people to Respect.

517
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:17,330
Speaker 1: and you know what if I like something I don't care if other people respect it or not.

518
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,401
Speaker 1: I like it because I like it.

519
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,699
Speaker 0: Yeah And yeah short of a massive PR campaign.

520
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,646
Speaker 0: You got to wait till all the old people die.

521
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,870
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all you got.

522
00:36:26,195 --> 00:36:26,846
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

523
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:29,740
Speaker 1: Okay, I just read what the next question is.

524
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:31,125
Speaker 1: Okay, you can read it.

525
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:32,169
Speaker 0: Let me find it.

526
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:34,753
Speaker 0: Hold on Do you?

527
00:36:34,894 --> 00:36:37,990
Speaker 0: you have been given an arbitrary large amount of money to create an anime manga.

528
00:36:38,111 --> 00:36:38,918
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess I skipped about.

529
00:36:38,938 --> 00:36:40,330
Speaker 1: I was looking at a different question anyway.

530
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:42,616
Speaker 0: Okay.

531
00:36:42,677 --> 00:36:43,142
Speaker 0: Oh wait.

532
00:36:43,849 --> 00:36:44,854
Speaker 0: Oh Cuz I was okay.

533
00:36:44,874 --> 00:36:45,155
Speaker 0: I got it.

534
00:36:45,396 --> 00:36:45,517
Speaker 0: Good.

535
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,204
Speaker 0: What is the main purpose of hentai?

536
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:48,370
Speaker 0: to beat off?

537
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:51,200
Speaker 0: That is is it just something funny at all?

538
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,750
Speaker 0: watch with friends who are most people actually getting off.

539
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,777
Speaker 1: Most people are actually getting off to it.

540
00:36:56,098 --> 00:36:58,446
Speaker 1: Good God now hentai.

541
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,209
Speaker 0: see the main.

542
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:03,000
Speaker 0: you're asking What is the main purpose of hentai which is for perverts?

543
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,570
Speaker 0: hentai means pervert in Japanese for perverts to get off?

544
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:07,830
Speaker 0: That's the main purpose.

545
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:19,465
Speaker 0: however a side effect is that you can use something that perverts get off to in an ironic fashion to entertain yourself if you Put it in the right context for a side effect.

546
00:37:19,485 --> 00:37:20,510
Speaker 0: That's not the main purpose.

547
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:29,029
Speaker 1: I mean the good thing is if you go to you can always tell you go to an anime con and every big one there'll be some sort of hentai showing or something somewhere.

548
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:39,629
Speaker 1: and Sometimes especially if it's a bigger crowd if you go into that room It's mostly people like us and they're laughing hysterically and MST3K the whole thing.

549
00:37:40,453 --> 00:37:43,950
Speaker 1: But every now and then you go to a small con you walk into the hentai room.

550
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:50,332
Speaker 1: There's five guys and they're just watching it and that's super creepy super creepy All right.

551
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,625
Speaker 0: So here's the reason I messed up and picking the right question.

552
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:57,290
Speaker 0: The next question is Do anime manga comics need to be taken more seriously?

553
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,284
Speaker 0: That is lack of respect for anime manga comics a major problem with those media for you.

554
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:02,228
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

555
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:03,267
Speaker 1: All right All right.

556
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,836
Speaker 0: Now here's the question I started to read.

557
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:10,923
Speaker 0: you have been given an arbitrarily large amount of money to create an anime manga Comic or to hire someone to create it for you.

558
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:12,170
Speaker 0: What is created?

559
00:38:14,573 --> 00:38:17,669
Speaker 1: That's a really difficult to answer open question.

560
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:20,301
Speaker 1: I Couldn't say it all what I do.

561
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:24,110
Speaker 0: I couldn't pick just one But I'll just pick something that happens to be on my mind lately.

562
00:38:24,611 --> 00:38:32,010
Speaker 0: I would take the plot of a shounen fighting show but make the fighting actual choreographed fighting like cowboy bebop and not stupid.

563
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:32,950
Speaker 0: I will use this technique.

564
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,216
Speaker 0: I was this technique and it only.

565
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:37,430
Speaker 0: it would be less than 39 episodes and it'd be the best show ever.

566
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:38,428
Speaker 0: You know what I would do?

567
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:54,150
Speaker 1: I don't I can't say what the creative direction would be But I would try to get together the talent of the world to create a new good serious Not really science fiction but fantasy anime because there aren't a lot of really good like straight-up.

568
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,782
Speaker 0: Would it be more like a slayers or more like more like eska flown a?

569
00:38:57,842 --> 00:39:00,370
Speaker 1: I think something kind like that robot in there.

570
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:02,726
Speaker 0: Throw a little bit of school in there appeals to the wide audience.

571
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:03,310
Speaker 1: something like that.

572
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,944
Speaker 1: I quality music as component is one of my favorite shows ever.

573
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:08,510
Speaker 1: the other thing is just out of the blue.

574
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:10,509
Speaker 1: I just thought of this because I've always thought about this.

575
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:17,591
Speaker 1: I'd either make a movie adaptation of the plot of Final Fantasy 4 or an OAV adaptation of the plot of Final Fantasy 6.

576
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:22,610
Speaker 0: I might do also do something like an Akira television series to actually sort of adapt the manga.

577
00:39:22,951 --> 00:39:28,029
Speaker 0: That might be tough the correct way, but if you had money, yeah, it says arbitrarily large amount of money.

578
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,963
Speaker 1: Alright, the next question is what is the next step for anime?

579
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,407
Speaker 1: Where is the medium going?

580
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:35,410
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

581
00:39:35,652 --> 00:39:37,610
Speaker 1: Well, I think there are two answers.

582
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:52,597
Speaker 1: there's what's the next step as it should be and what's the next step as it is because as it should be is the anime industry in America kind of coming together to try to mass-market this stuff and where I see it going is Nowhere,

583
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,128
Speaker 0: it's not gonna keep going as it's

584
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:54,430
Speaker 1: going.

585
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:57,281
Speaker 1: I feel like it's kind of stagnating in the US and it.

586
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,490
Speaker 1: it doesn't worry me yet, but it's not a good.

587
00:40:00,192 --> 00:40:00,976
Speaker 1: It's not growing.

588
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:02,442
Speaker 1: It's kind of like it's treading water.

589
00:40:02,562 --> 00:40:09,250
Speaker 1: That's all it's been able to do for a long time Yep, and I feel like it wouldn't be that hard to start swimming, but no one seems to try.

590
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,293
Speaker 1: I mean no one.

591
00:40:10,313 --> 00:40:13,361
Speaker 1: when was the last time an anime company took a risk.

592
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:14,605
Speaker 1: That wasn't a stupid risk.

593
00:40:15,206 --> 00:40:15,367
Speaker 1: No.

594
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:16,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I rest my case.

595
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:18,550
Speaker 0: What's the next step for comics?

596
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:21,078
Speaker 0: Where is the medium going both artistically and financially?

597
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,390
Speaker 1: this one's easy trades all the way and I think issues are gonna disappear.

598
00:40:24,732 --> 00:40:31,570
Speaker 0: I think it'll take a while because as the you know Again, all these people are holding on to it fiercely and there's like a big tradition of it.

599
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:37,150
Speaker 0: But I think as time goes on the issues are gonna go down and down and the trades are gonna go up and up.

600
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:44,949
Speaker 1: I also think the traditional idea of a superhero is going not disappear because nothing disappears, but spider-man will always be there Don't worry.

601
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:57,777
Speaker 1: I just think that on average that sort of aesthetic of you know The costume wearing superhero will disappear except in ironic senses nostalgic senses and Watchmen style sense.

602
00:40:57,857 --> 00:40:59,928
Speaker 0: It might take a long time because you were gonna have to.

603
00:40:59,948 --> 00:41:00,511
Speaker 0: you know Cuz.

604
00:41:00,551 --> 00:41:12,870
Speaker 0: basically things are being kept the way they are Because the existing fan base which is not really growing or shrinking so much is sort of Maintaining a status quo and holding on to it for dear life.

605
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:41,088
Speaker 0: But the only thing that's gonna slow that down is When those people who have been underwear pervert fans since the Stan Lee days and continue to collect now and forever When they actually again start dying or you know Start stop collecting or whatever and the people of this crazy collector's mentality stop doing it then Marvel and DC and all them will be forced to abandon their superhero ways and try to do something new or Let the medium go by the wayside and become super niche and it'll be just.

606
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:52,290
Speaker 1: you know indie stuff because it's happening that the traditional comic industry is not doing well and You know so-called indie comics and all these kind of doing better than it did it after the crash in the nine.

607
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,374
Speaker 1: But that's not saying much.

608
00:41:53,394 --> 00:41:56,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not like some super mega bucks thing.

609
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:57,890
Speaker 0: It's just doing what it's always been doing.

610
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,840
Speaker 1: So, uh, how do you make a good webcomic?

611
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,188
Speaker 1: What do you look for in one a penny arcade?

612
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:05,056
Speaker 0: Okay How do you make a good webcomic?

613
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:06,845
Speaker 1: I think it there's.

614
00:42:06,865 --> 00:42:07,850
Speaker 0: no it's really easy.

615
00:42:07,951 --> 00:42:09,290
Speaker 1: All you have curious if you'll say the same thing.

616
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,277
Speaker 0: I say all right you use.

617
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:14,950
Speaker 0: you need to have some sort of artistic talent or find someone with artistic talent, right?

618
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:21,910
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter if your talent level is low as long as your potential is high and You know, you need to find someone with some writing talent.

619
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:35,553
Speaker 0: But it doesn't matter if it's currently low as long as has a high potential and then you just need to keep making Webcomics keep making them don't stop and whatever you do improve yourself in art and writing in Every comic.

620
00:42:35,593 --> 00:42:40,510
Speaker 0: as long as you constantly improve you will eventually have a great comic case in point.

621
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:42,419
Speaker 1: Look at the first year of penny arcade.

622
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:44,950
Speaker 0: look it go by go to the store and look at the penny arcade books.

623
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:47,277
Speaker 0: Look at the first one and look at the current one.

624
00:42:47,538 --> 00:42:48,340
Speaker 0: They improved.

625
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,844
Speaker 0: That's why they're gods now.

626
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:54,419
Speaker 1: Look at something else like You're trying not to name a certain comic.

627
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:56,225
Speaker 1: I know which one you're thinking of.

628
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:58,835
Speaker 1: All right, fine mega Tokyo, okay That's not the one I was thinking.

629
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:02,270
Speaker 0: it's improved some but largely it's unchanged.

630
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:06,765
Speaker 0: The writing is just as bad as it's always been and the art really hasn't improved.

631
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:16,268
Speaker 1: that means if you know what mega Tokyo started going and I thought a really good direction and then it I'm not sure where it went in the last couple weeks Yeah, I got any other ones that haven't improved at all.

632
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,330
Speaker 0: What about that one you read like CR college roomies from hell one that looks the same now as it always did.

633
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,122
Speaker 1: No, he actually looks super better compared to how it does it.

634
00:43:24,404 --> 00:43:27,296
Speaker 1: you own the first I don't know year of that.

635
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,425
Speaker 0: Bob and George never got never improved.

636
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:30,630
Speaker 1: Bob and George was never good.

637
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,434
Speaker 0: Well, he was it was.

638
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:35,914
Speaker 0: no it was when they made Joe about flash man and quick man And wood man.

639
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:36,697
Speaker 0: then it was downhill.

640
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,158
Speaker 0: guy there.

641
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,105
Speaker 1: those are the three examples you always give.

642
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:44,579
Speaker 0: did they ever make a fourth joke Flashman quick man wood man eat man.

643
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,066
Speaker 1: Did they ever make a fifth Joe airman?

644
00:43:47,287 --> 00:43:48,230
Speaker 0: No, they didn't know.

645
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:50,604
Speaker 0: Snake man, that was dumb.

646
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:53,895
Speaker 0: No see Beginning of the comic.

647
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:54,939
Speaker 0: it was all downhill from there.

648
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,144
Speaker 0: Luckily the comics over now.

649
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:57,550
Speaker 1: Oh god, that was a bad guy.

650
00:43:57,912 --> 00:44:06,400
Speaker 1: but in terms of specifics, I think a Lot of people approach the webcomic world I think in the wrong way and that You can't.

651
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:09,209
Speaker 1: you can tell a serious story You can do a comedy you can do whatever you want.

652
00:44:09,551 --> 00:44:17,369
Speaker 1: But the thing with a webcomic is that whatever your update schedule is one It has to update consistently or people won't read it to.

653
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:24,848
Speaker 1: When you put something up whatever unit you update in whether it's a page of volume a panel.

654
00:44:24,868 --> 00:44:29,110
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter That in and of itself has to be enjoyable.

655
00:44:29,473 --> 00:44:38,030
Speaker 1: I mean you can't have like just The Wednesday comic this week doesn't go anywhere because it's just set up for the Friday comic.

656
00:44:38,331 --> 00:44:39,395
Speaker 1: That'll kill a webcomic.

657
00:44:39,836 --> 00:44:45,355
Speaker 1: every single one while it can tell it can take you a story and while it can be consistent Has to have something.

658
00:44:45,596 --> 00:44:53,646
Speaker 1: one thing that happens like one unit of progression one unit of enjoyment Something that makes it stand at least somewhat on its own.

659
00:44:53,686 --> 00:44:59,290
Speaker 0: if you want to learn How to do that very well look at order the stick because he knows when all that is like the best web.

660
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:04,606
Speaker 0: He knows when he doesn't have enough in his single page to really do anything on its own.

661
00:45:04,626 --> 00:45:11,646
Speaker 0: and he'll do these multi-page Releases so that every update has stands on its own as something enjoyable.

662
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:21,454
Speaker 1: like look every order of the stick Advances the plot a little bit has a joke at like one main joke probably a side joke and some foreshadowing Almost every single one.

663
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:22,617
Speaker 0: It's a great comic.

664
00:45:22,898 --> 00:45:24,883
Speaker 1: Oh, it's definitely one of the top two.

665
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:27,530
Speaker 0: Okay, will Naruto ever die?

666
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:27,933
Speaker 0: I don't know.

667
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:28,824
Speaker 0: I don't watch the show.

668
00:45:28,864 --> 00:45:29,370
Speaker 0: I don't read the model.

669
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,960
Speaker 0: I know if the character will not die permanently ever.

670
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:38,640
Speaker 1: I'm certain of that at best and I don't think this will happen They would kill him at the end to save everyone.

671
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,509
Speaker 1: He'd probably kill himself, but that's beside the point.

672
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:50,450
Speaker 1: The show Naruto the idea of Naruto the reruns of Naruto the Phantom of Naruto Much like old generals and much like Dragon Ball will never die.

673
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:54,770
Speaker 1: It will just fade away and then always exist at this baseline level forever.

674
00:45:55,694 --> 00:45:56,948
Speaker 1: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

675
00:45:57,993 --> 00:46:03,410
Speaker 1: All right, if you could ask Alan Moore one question, what would it be?

676
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,820
Speaker 0: I don't really have a question for Alan Moore.

677
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,330
Speaker 0: That's like, you know, I'm dying to ask him So I'll probably just ask him like hey, why are you so crazy?

678
00:46:11,271 --> 00:46:12,978
Speaker 1: Down a bit who's your barber?

679
00:46:13,319 --> 00:46:15,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, who's not your barber?

680
00:46:15,368 --> 00:46:22,463
Speaker 1: All right I know what I'd ask the next one because they listed a bunch of people Kazuo Koike and my question would be are you for serious?

681
00:46:22,965 --> 00:46:24,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just are you just playing?

682
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:26,749
Speaker 0: Cuz something like that.

683
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:36,050
Speaker 1: I really don't know if the things he like some of the things he did Like if he knew how crazy and I ran stupid they were well not stupid, but you know just weird and scary.

684
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:43,493
Speaker 1: But I wonder if he understood what he was making when he made it or if he was just crazy Stanley.

685
00:46:43,574 --> 00:46:45,510
Speaker 1: actually, I gotta answer this.

686
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:49,200
Speaker 0: I know what you're gonna answer how I say the same thing But we saw actually at the New York comic-con.

687
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:50,810
Speaker 0: We saw him from like a hundred we did.

688
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:56,055
Speaker 0: He was surrounded by this throng of courtiers Yeah, and I was just like hey I think that's Stanley.

689
00:46:56,075 --> 00:46:56,518
Speaker 0: and it was.

690
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:59,092
Speaker 0: and then he hobbled away like an old man Which is what he is.

691
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:04,770
Speaker 1: and my question for you Stanley what the fuck was up with you bolding random words?

692
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:10,027
Speaker 1: It's not like you bolded words that should have been in because you've bolded random words just randomly.

693
00:47:10,268 --> 00:47:10,950
Speaker 0: what the fuck.

694
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:16,170
Speaker 0: I would actually you know sort of have a bigger question that includes the random bowling.

695
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,735
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the other question with me.

696
00:47:17,996 --> 00:47:19,060
Speaker 1: Why did you use words?

697
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:19,943
Speaker 1: You didn't understand?

698
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,889
Speaker 0: Well, I basically asked him in general You know, do you looking back now?

699
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:29,910
Speaker 0: Do you honestly think that that you know, your writing was high quality or do you think it was you know terrible?

700
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,669
Speaker 1: He would say yes it was.

701
00:47:32,513 --> 00:47:36,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right Osamu Tezuka, uh, I don't even know what to ask.

702
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:37,102
Speaker 0: I couldn't.

703
00:47:37,243 --> 00:47:39,190
Speaker 1: I wouldn't feel okay asking him.

704
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:44,415
Speaker 1: I'd ask him out for a drink because I think he's one of the He's.

705
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:46,689
Speaker 1: I have so much respect for the late Osamu Tezuka.

706
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:50,469
Speaker 1: I mean, I just finished Apollo's song a little while ago and god damn.

707
00:47:51,153 --> 00:48:02,436
Speaker 1: Also as an aside, I just would like to say that I know a lot of you are listening now Probably also listen to anime world order and they recently reviewed Apollo's song and I'm not gonna you know rip into them or anything But you're

708
00:48:02,456 --> 00:48:04,370
Speaker 0: gonna wait until we review Apollo's song to do that.

709
00:48:04,551 --> 00:48:08,350
Speaker 1: What I would like to say is that I don't think they got it at all.

710
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:14,650
Speaker 1: And I just I really don't think they got it and as a result, I think their review really didn't do that comic justice.

711
00:48:15,313 --> 00:48:21,380
Speaker 0: Well, I would basically as Tezuka, you know greedily like hey What was gonna be happening in the rest of Phoenix?

712
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:22,425
Speaker 0: because he didn't finish it.

713
00:48:22,445 --> 00:48:33,450
Speaker 1: I Just finished reading what was created and uh, yeah, actually I'd ask him if I'm right about Apollo's song Though I'm pretty sure I am because yeah, I don't want to spoil that comic.

714
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,718
Speaker 0: Why isn't Tezuka more popular in the USA?

715
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:41,330
Speaker 1: one Americans by and large don't like comics like any kind of comic.

716
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:56,869
Speaker 1: I mean manga is popular but it's not like the average Joe reads manga and comics and like So less popular than and Tezuka being black and white and being so different looking than even anime, you know Manga style comics also.

717
00:48:57,251 --> 00:48:58,554
Speaker 1: Tezuka is really disarming.

718
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:08,838
Speaker 1: you read Tezuka like Oh to carry hedo or Apollo's song or Phoenix and it looks goonian light-hearted But and there's jokes like every third panel But it was kind of random and bleh.

719
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,105
Speaker 1: those comics hit on issues Really hard that make a lot of people especially in the u.s.

720
00:49:14,346 --> 00:49:15,170
Speaker 1: Really uncomfortable.

721
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,305
Speaker 0: And I think the biggest thing is that really the it's sort of inaccessible.

722
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:20,690
Speaker 0: I mean most of his stuff.

723
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,438
Speaker 0: I mean he's got Phoenix's published by Viz.

724
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:28,050
Speaker 0: he's got a few things published by Dark Horse Which are kind of hard to get and the rest is published by vertical ink.

725
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:30,119
Speaker 0: These are not easy things to get at.

726
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:32,710
Speaker 0: these are not things that are marketed widely or advertised.

727
00:49:33,134 --> 00:49:34,990
Speaker 0: Most people in the country don't even know who Tezuka is.

728
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,654
Speaker 0: I think if people knew who Tezuka was and they were like, you know They they hyped him up.

729
00:49:39,794 --> 00:49:44,150
Speaker 0: as you know with again a PR campaign like Tezuka is as good as Walt Disney.

730
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,142
Speaker 0: Oh my god, his stuff is amazing.

731
00:49:46,202 --> 00:49:47,450
Speaker 0: It's so crazily popular.

732
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:53,430
Speaker 0: We're putting it everywhere and if you give people the impression that it is already popular then it will become pop, you know It's funny.

733
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:07,530
Speaker 1: I was gonna interrupt you but I didn't because I had to sniff and I would have said the exact same thing if there was just a marketing campaign of Osamu Tezuka the Japanese Walt Disney the greatest comic author ever and they just pumped it.

734
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, does it do greatly?

735
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:10,219
Speaker 0: Also, they're gonna.

736
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:13,490
Speaker 0: they're starting to colorize all of Tezuka's manga that the Tezuka.

737
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:20,548
Speaker 0: Actually, I I'm kind of really looking forward to How much it's gonna cost when it comes out here, but maybe that'll help a little bit.

738
00:50:20,588 --> 00:50:21,412
Speaker 0: I don't know I don't know.

739
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:23,481
Speaker 0: All right crossover question.

740
00:50:23,602 --> 00:50:25,570
Speaker 1: Oh, I can read this one cuz it's long.

741
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:31,518
Speaker 1: Okay, you've expressed distaste for underwear pervert comics But what do you think of underwear pervert video games?

742
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:35,130
Speaker 1: Did they suffer the same stigma as licensed branded movie video games?

743
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,394
Speaker 1: Have you paid?

744
00:50:36,414 --> 00:50:41,470
Speaker 1: I guess he means played any of the Marvel titles like X-men legends or Marvel?

745
00:50:42,612 --> 00:50:44,682
Speaker 1: Let me answer I want to answer to but you can do it.

746
00:50:44,702 --> 00:50:45,647
Speaker 1: All right, you can go.

747
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:50,930
Speaker 0: Okay, so There there's nothing inherently good or bad about an underwear pervert video game.

748
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:52,777
Speaker 0: I mean you make a good spider-man video game.

749
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:54,423
Speaker 0: you sadly almost no one did.

750
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,731
Speaker 0: you can make a bad spider-man video game like the Attar.

751
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:59,784
Speaker 1: actually, I think the Atari 2600 is one of the better spider-man.

752
00:50:59,804 --> 00:51:03,670
Speaker 0: the Sega Genesis one We have to take pictures of the bosses is actually a really good.

753
00:51:04,611 --> 00:51:05,335
Speaker 1: That's coming from me.

754
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:06,661
Speaker 1: I hated the Sega, but you know what?

755
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:08,290
Speaker 1: That was a damn good spider-man game.

756
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:10,399
Speaker 0: X-men arcade good game.

757
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:13,150
Speaker 1: the walk across the side smashing things won.

758
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:16,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, Captain America nothing moves the blob except Cyclops.

759
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:23,570
Speaker 1: the Captain America arcade game also quite good But uh that x-men legends game that that game was crap.

760
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,340
Speaker 0: It's just gauntlet our world of Warcraft.

761
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,886
Speaker 1: one of our friends hyped it up like man.

762
00:51:27,906 --> 00:51:28,688
Speaker 1: This game is awesome.

763
00:51:28,729 --> 00:51:32,690
Speaker 1: Check it out Oh my god, and we finally played it and I was like, it's just gauntlet.

764
00:51:33,394 --> 00:51:35,830
Speaker 1: It's better than gauntlet at being gauntlet.

765
00:51:36,192 --> 00:51:38,830
Speaker 1: But that's like saying world of Warcraft is better than the realm.

766
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,258
Speaker 1: Yeah in world over here play gauntlet.

767
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:50,250
Speaker 0: if you like gauntlet and you like the the under x-men Then you'll like x-men legends cuz it's just gauntlet with x-men instead of green wizard and red warrior.

768
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:54,627
Speaker 1: I think the worst thing is that the game has this leveling mechanic that was kind of cool.

769
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:55,811
Speaker 1: grind aside Like.

770
00:51:55,891 --> 00:52:01,086
Speaker 1: it was really cool except half the powers didn't do Jack and it just wasn't fun.

771
00:52:01,547 --> 00:52:02,510
Speaker 0: and it also didn't matter.

772
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:03,717
Speaker 0: It's like you get skill points.

773
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:07,799
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what you put the skill points in You just you can automatically spend them.

774
00:52:07,819 --> 00:52:08,603
Speaker 0: You'll do just fine.

775
00:52:08,643 --> 00:52:09,306
Speaker 0: You can't lose.

776
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,276
Speaker 0: It's gauntlet Alright.

777
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really can't lose it.

778
00:52:12,791 --> 00:52:17,970
Speaker 0: Nothing inherently good or bad about a game that uses an underwear pervert license to try to sell itself.

779
00:52:18,412 --> 00:52:23,293
Speaker 0: The thing is is that you know, you can make a good game and you can make a bad game Whatever.

780
00:52:23,313 --> 00:52:26,010
Speaker 0: Okay, would you guys be okay?

781
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,970
Speaker 0: If someone would continue the Phoenix story from the two pages the testicle left before he died?

782
00:52:30,151 --> 00:52:31,114
Speaker 0: Probably not.

783
00:52:31,335 --> 00:52:41,889
Speaker 1: I say yeah, you know why that sort of thing happens all the time and While it's effectively a glorified fanfic at the same time if someone's a good writer and they

784
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:46,170
Speaker 0: well I guess I guess anyone's allowed to try it go go nuts, you know, do whatever you want.

785
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:55,533
Speaker 0: But I think the odds of someone doing it well enough to the point where I would respect it and consider it to be the actual continuation of Phoenix Nothing.

786
00:52:55,633 --> 00:53:04,743
Speaker 1: I would consider that to be a work in and of itself kind of a. they took this core story and Everything that they knew about it and they just wrote something based on it.

787
00:53:05,205 --> 00:53:06,470
Speaker 1: I think it's like an adaptation.

788
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:08,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, let anyone try go nuts.

789
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,305
Speaker 0: You're free to do so.

790
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:10,350
Speaker 0: All right expression.

791
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,049
Speaker 1: But what would it take to get anime quote mainstream unquote recognition in the

792
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:15,370
Speaker 1: u.s.?

793
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:17,356
Speaker 1: Why hasn't this been done yet real?

794
00:53:17,396 --> 00:53:22,334
Speaker 1: simply it wouldn't take much and the American anime industry is run by morons And they all that.

795
00:53:22,354 --> 00:53:27,855
Speaker 0: the other problem is that they have to take a big risk and spend a lot of money on Marketing in PR.

796
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:28,356
Speaker 0: They're not.

797
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:33,233
Speaker 1: I mean they take risks on stupid things, but they don't take and also they're so secret It.

798
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:34,610
Speaker 1: uh, yeah, we talked about that a lot.

799
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,122
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll ask this one because I we both have a lot to say about this one.

800
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:40,430
Speaker 1: Why do DVDs cost so freaking much in?

801
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,640
Speaker 0: Japan People in Japan are dumb and they're willing to pay a lot for DVDs.

802
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,270
Speaker 1: I think the Japanese anime industry Well, really just media in Japan.

803
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:56,641
Speaker 1: They kind of for a long time took advantage of the Japanese people and I don't know if it I mean I think there's a lot of reasons.

804
00:53:56,701 --> 00:54:04,117
Speaker 1: but it ended up that They price things very high and people were willing to pay it and as a result The prices stayed really high.

805
00:54:04,499 --> 00:54:08,415
Speaker 1: and then Japan tried to sell stuff in the US and the US said $40 for a DVD.

806
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:17,350
Speaker 1: So Japan started selling, you know, they'd license it so that DVDs would be cheap in America.

807
00:54:18,036 --> 00:54:22,318
Speaker 1: but then Japanese people started Re-importing because they're like how come that DVDs?

808
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,270
Speaker 1: 20 American dollars in America and 80 American dollars here?

809
00:54:26,932 --> 00:54:33,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, so as a result, they don't license stuff to America right away, which hurts the American industry Which makes the licenses worth.

810
00:54:33,995 --> 00:54:35,359
Speaker 1: it's like this cycle of crap.

811
00:54:35,781 --> 00:54:44,950
Speaker 0: Another thing is that in America you realize, you know DVDs sell a lot maybe because they have lower prices, but also I guess because Americans watch a lot of things.

812
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:53,950
Speaker 1: I think the total output of Shows that are then put on DVD in America is a lot higher than Japan total just because there's a lot more TV in America.

813
00:54:54,191 --> 00:55:05,104
Speaker 0: I also I get the feeling also that you know The anime is on TV in Japan and I get the feeling that most people just watch it on TV and that only Sort of otaku were likely to buy it on DVD.

814
00:55:05,164 --> 00:55:14,330
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of the time A lot less people purchasing so and they're they're crazy fans and crazy fans are willing to pay more because they're crazed fans.

815
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:25,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kind of people who are gonna buy Bandai visual DVDs in the u.s So When are you going to do final thoughts episodes when I rewatch anime series?

816
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:31,030
Speaker 1: Actually, we're going to do one either next week or the week after because there is one show if we don't do it.

817
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:39,641
Speaker 1: Oh, no there is one show that we both remember enough to give our full final thoughts on and Scott just has to watch Ava again and eska flown a again.

818
00:55:39,662 --> 00:55:43,693
Speaker 0: And I'll tell you what as soon as I finish Phantom hourglass.

819
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:46,184
Speaker 0: I'll start watching Evangelion on the train.

820
00:55:46,546 --> 00:55:48,377
Speaker 1: Ah, see at the same time I was kind of waiting.

821
00:55:48,437 --> 00:55:52,048
Speaker 1: cuz I kind of want to watch it again, too And we have a couple friends who have never seen it.

822
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:55,425
Speaker 1: Oh, but at the same time, what are we gonna get together in marathon anime?

823
00:55:55,465 --> 00:55:56,330
Speaker 1: We don't have time for that.

824
00:55:56,531 --> 00:55:57,274
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna happen.

825
00:55:57,615 --> 00:55:58,218
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm not.

826
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,367
Speaker 1: should I say the title we're gonna do final thoughts on.

827
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:01,030
Speaker 0: it's up to you.

828
00:56:01,413 --> 00:56:02,018
Speaker 1: I think I should.

829
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:10,710
Speaker 1: just if you're listening We're very likely going to do a final thoughts on Trigon All right in the near future because I think a light kind of like Apollo song.

830
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,697
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people misinterpret what it was saying.

831
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:13,219
Speaker 1: Okay.

832
00:56:14,002 --> 00:56:16,110
Speaker 0: Do you think that nonfiction graphic novels?

833
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:23,250
Speaker 0: Eg also a correct use of again the 9/11 report a graphic adaptation will ever be a major force in the American comic book market.

834
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:25,396
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.

835
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:25,997
Speaker 1: I don't.

836
00:56:26,098 --> 00:56:30,570
Speaker 1: I think if comics became more mainstream than things like that would become equally mainstream.

837
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:31,798
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you know.

838
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:40,009
Speaker 0: there there's another graphic non-fiction graphic novel the plot by will Eisner which is sort of the the true history of the.

839
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,615
Speaker 0: What's the stupid conspiracy?

840
00:56:42,695 --> 00:56:44,981
Speaker 0: Jew book the brother the elders is ion?

841
00:56:45,021 --> 00:56:45,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, ever book.

842
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have that and it's pretty good.

843
00:56:49,452 --> 00:57:07,879
Speaker 0: Yes, there just really aren't that many Non-fiction graphic novels out there and I think if someone you know came out with one with good timing, you know They hit on an issue that was like, you know Very big at the time and they did a very good job of it and they market it properly that they could you know Really make a big hit.

844
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:09,230
Speaker 0: there is definitely a potential there.

845
00:57:10,312 --> 00:57:11,918
Speaker 0: Have I seen any examples?

846
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:13,684
Speaker 0: No, I haven't really seen anything.

847
00:57:13,704 --> 00:57:15,370
Speaker 0: that's that you know is gonna make it happen.

848
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:17,864
Speaker 0: I don't think this 9/11 report graphic adaptation did that?

849
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:18,810
Speaker 0: Well, I never heard of it before.

850
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:21,020
Speaker 1: I've heard of it because it was all over FARC.

851
00:57:21,301 --> 00:57:23,250
Speaker 1: Okay, but along the same lines.

852
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:26,790
Speaker 1: Uh, how common are nonfiction manga in the Asian comic book market?

853
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:30,502
Speaker 1: I vaguely recall you guys mentioning something about a manga history of ramen.

854
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:35,662
Speaker 0: I think they are more common than nonfiction I think is in the American comics.

855
00:57:35,682 --> 00:57:40,803
Speaker 1: broader answer is just that Manga isn't like this special thing in Japan.

856
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:45,650
Speaker 0: It's just another medium Yeah, and there's nonfiction in it as well as fiction.

857
00:57:45,710 --> 00:57:55,550
Speaker 0: I mean, I already already know they have like business manga which tells stories about businesses and I imagine is Historical manga which tell like, you know stories from history pretty accurately.

858
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:00,690
Speaker 0: I you know, I'm sure they had lots of drama to really get people going on it and stuff.

859
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:02,257
Speaker 0: But I'm sure it exists.

860
00:58:02,297 --> 00:58:03,161
Speaker 0: everything else exists.

861
00:58:03,282 --> 00:58:05,110
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you know nonfiction exists?

862
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,199
Speaker 0: Okay, so this one is actually a Thunderdome.

863
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,463
Speaker 0: we should do another Thunderdome episode.

864
00:58:09,523 --> 00:58:11,370
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're skipping those other two questions.

865
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:15,234
Speaker 0: Okay Now everyone's thinking.

866
00:58:15,274 --> 00:58:15,616
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

867
00:58:15,656 --> 00:58:15,957
Speaker 1: I want that.

868
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:16,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm skipping them.

869
00:58:17,524 --> 00:58:18,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're kind of crap.

870
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:19,030
Speaker 1: Not that I look at him.

871
00:58:19,231 --> 00:58:20,178
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll answer.

872
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,226
Speaker 1: I'll do this one real quick.

873
00:58:21,468 --> 00:58:25,650
Speaker 1: All right What's the most you've ever paid for a comic anime manga and the biggest steel deal ever scored?

874
00:58:26,031 --> 00:58:28,804
Speaker 1: We bought all of master Keaton for like freaking nothing.

875
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty damn cheap.

876
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,335
Speaker 1: That was so worth it.

877
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:34,126
Speaker 1: And the most was just in the early days.

878
00:58:34,568 --> 00:58:42,070
Speaker 1: I paid like Some stupid amount of money for the VHS box set of the original Tenchi Muyo OAVs.

879
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:45,038
Speaker 1: It was like thirty five forty dollars of VHS.

880
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:48,026
Speaker 0: I think for all six volumes of Akira.

881
00:58:48,106 --> 00:58:59,859
Speaker 0: I paid full retail price For anime, I bought all the gassaraki on dubbed VHS and for a single comic I never really five bucks.

882
00:58:59,919 --> 00:59:04,535
Speaker 0: I paid for like x-men number one, I guess but I Don't know.

883
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:12,370
Speaker 0: I guess I spent Like 30 bucks to get like a hardcover, you know, like come in a book like a graphic novel.

884
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:15,145
Speaker 0: But I you know, I guess those big red stars the volumes.

885
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:20,690
Speaker 1: I paid a lot for those I guess one I could say if you talk most expensive in terms of dollars spent per unit quality.

886
00:59:22,055 --> 00:59:40,870
Speaker 1: I forget what it was called but there's a picture of it in a picture I got from my mom of my bedroom when I was younger and It's a comic I think it was by Margaret Weiss and it was something about dragons, so, of course I bought it and Effectively I paid infinity for it because there was zero content worthwhile in it and I paid some amount of money.

887
00:59:41,731 --> 00:59:43,123
Speaker 1: Good God was that horrible.

888
00:59:43,183 --> 00:59:48,190
Speaker 1: and I even like Lied to myself and said I liked it because I didn't want to admit that I'd spent that money.

889
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,818
Speaker 0: All right, the other question that we skipped.

890
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,707
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna ignore cuz it's so generic.

891
00:59:51,827 --> 00:59:52,637
Speaker 1: Oh it is All right.

892
00:59:52,863 --> 00:59:53,150
Speaker 0: All right.

893
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:55,130
Speaker 0: So back to the Thunderdome gonna read the whole thing.

894
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,857
Speaker 0: Who would win in a battle?

895
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:59,750
Speaker 0: spike Spiegel and the swordfish or a starbuck in the Viper?

896
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:08,387
Speaker 1: I don't know who starbuck star is is a character from Battlestar Galactica Who in the modern Battlestar Galactica is a woman, but it doesn't matter.

897
01:00:08,427 --> 01:00:09,090
Speaker 1: I think it's kind of cool.

898
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:17,290
Speaker 1: They did that but in both Starbuck is a badass one of the best fighter in space pilots in the known human world.

899
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:18,755
Speaker 0: What kind of weapons does that thing have?

900
01:00:18,996 --> 01:00:22,910
Speaker 1: actually the Viper is fairly equivalent to the swordfish really?

901
01:00:23,713 --> 01:00:27,720
Speaker 0: Doesn't really have that many weapons other than the big Of it and which is kind of unwieldy.

902
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:28,906
Speaker 0: It's not really a gunship.

903
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:35,390
Speaker 1: So let me put it this way So she's flying and she's lying in the equivalent of an a-wing with extra weapons.

904
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:36,253
Speaker 1: That's a x-wing.

905
01:00:36,614 --> 01:00:41,510
Speaker 0: an x-wing Oh x-wing frickin wedge antilles could own spike in an x-wing.

906
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:46,488
Speaker 0: I mean spike is a good pilot, but the swordfish really isn't that powerful as as a fighter.

907
01:00:47,151 --> 01:00:55,270
Speaker 0: It's it's you know, it has fighter abilities and it shoots its laser But it that's really all it has and an x-wing which is actually a military vehicle.

908
01:00:55,591 --> 01:00:59,348
Speaker 0: He'd be owned he'd be toast but at the same time you take him out.

909
01:00:59,408 --> 01:01:04,850
Speaker 1: my answer I think is much more clever and I hope everyone agrees All right So and I'm not gonna ruin cowboy bebop.

910
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:05,352
Speaker 1: But it is.

911
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:11,549
Speaker 1: they kind of make reference to this in the first episode and they bring it up a lot and the movie Brings it up like super.

912
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:21,139
Speaker 1: but spike Spiegel the only way he could possibly die is in a very specific situation because Spike Spiegel doesn't say he has to die.

913
01:01:21,159 --> 01:01:21,942
Speaker 0: He just loses.

914
01:01:22,002 --> 01:01:23,166
Speaker 1: He can't win a battle.

915
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,110
Speaker 1: He cannot lose.

916
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:25,577
Speaker 1: I am up cuz it's a space battle.

917
01:01:25,617 --> 01:01:28,110
Speaker 1: You can't lose a battle like that and not die.

918
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:28,813
Speaker 0: He can.

919
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,281
Speaker 0: now your ship is damaged.

920
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:31,105
Speaker 0: You're floating in space.

921
01:01:31,125 --> 01:01:32,010
Speaker 0: Then someone picks you up and goes.

922
01:01:32,633 --> 01:01:33,456
Speaker 1: I don't think that could happen.

923
01:01:33,496 --> 01:01:34,882
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna gun them all the time.

924
01:01:35,143 --> 01:01:36,950
Speaker 1: Well Gundam is different in the real world.

925
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:40,025
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure your cabin would depress your eyes and you die immediately.

926
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:41,050
Speaker 0: Well, you're wearing a spacesuit.

927
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:43,502
Speaker 1: How does spike wear a spacesuit when he's in his?

928
01:01:43,682 --> 01:01:45,210
Speaker 1: uh swordfish sometimes?

929
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:47,929
Speaker 1: Does he think back sometimes?

930
01:01:49,031 --> 01:01:50,316
Speaker 0: He's puts on a space suit a few times.

931
01:01:50,356 --> 01:01:50,617
Speaker 0: All right.

932
01:01:50,918 --> 01:01:54,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just don't think spike could lose because of various plot.

933
01:01:54,151 --> 01:01:56,802
Speaker 1: I think that spike would just win due to some crazy thing.

934
01:01:57,163 --> 01:01:59,176
Speaker 1: Starbuck would just go insane or something I don't know.

935
01:01:59,237 --> 01:02:02,357
Speaker 0: Here's an easy question What are the good and bad parts of Naruto?

936
01:02:02,397 --> 01:02:03,982
Speaker 1: good parts funny ninja school.

937
01:02:04,162 --> 01:02:07,356
Speaker 0: funny ninja school and the characters are really awesome At least most of them.

938
01:02:07,537 --> 01:02:08,889
Speaker 0: bad parts everything else.

939
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:16,870
Speaker 0: Seriously, all right What point in your lives did you go from OMG all cartoons from Japan are awesome to anime jadedness?

940
01:02:17,272 --> 01:02:20,070
Speaker 1: Well, it's you know, people say oh you're jaded about anime.

941
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:27,407
Speaker 1: It's more than when I first found out about Japan cartoons, you know Japanimation anime on the sci-fi channel.

942
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:27,648
Speaker 1: Yep.

943
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:33,190
Speaker 1: Me too It was different and that alone made it amazing because it wasn't like things I'd seen.

944
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:33,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I was.

945
01:02:33,892 --> 01:02:35,398
Speaker 0: it's all relative you see.

946
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:42,162
Speaker 0: so when I was watching even though some of the things I watched were amazing Like say galaxy express 3 9 on sci-fi channel.

947
01:02:42,744 --> 01:02:58,762
Speaker 0: I was also watching Like fatal fury on the sci-fi channel and it was relative to what I had already Experienced in my life and at that point in my life the things that I had experienced in terms of animation We're not nearly even close to being as amazing as fatal fury even so.

948
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:01,570
Speaker 0: that's why everything was so awesome to me early on.

949
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:15,990
Speaker 0: But as I watched more and more anime and more and more amazing anime like the works of Satoshi khan Otomo and Miyazaki and reading manga of Tezuka They you can start to see when things are not so amazing because you've seen something even better than that.

950
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,816
Speaker 0: And that's when you start getting jaded.

951
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:22,390
Speaker 1: It's kind of like once you ride the Millennium Force the super bad rollercoaster.

952
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:22,812
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you.

953
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:27,494
Speaker 1: if you're not gonna have fun on the blue streak anymore because it just it pales by comparison Exactly.

954
01:03:27,534 --> 01:03:28,661
Speaker 0: You go to the amusement park.

955
01:03:28,681 --> 01:03:30,230
Speaker 0: You've never ridden a roller coaster in your life.

956
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:32,910
Speaker 0: You ride the hundred-foot Twinkie and it's awesome.

957
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,815
Speaker 0: Then you ride the 200 foot and you go, holy shit, then you ride the hundred foot again you go man That's how it goes.

958
01:03:38,237 --> 01:03:40,670
Speaker 0: so when I first watched anime it was it was the hundred footer.

959
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,282
Speaker 1: All right Should we end on this one?

960
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:44,430
Speaker 0: pick whatever you want?

961
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:48,684
Speaker 1: Cuz it we've gone about an hour as always right and this one's this one's aid.

962
01:03:48,744 --> 01:03:50,570
Speaker 1: and what are your opinions on?

963
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:52,253
Speaker 1: Otak in?

964
01:03:52,594 --> 01:03:54,480
Speaker 0: what are Otak in our otaku kin?

965
01:03:54,641 --> 01:03:55,484
Speaker 0: What are otaku kids?

966
01:03:55,504 --> 01:03:56,467
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't read that thread.

967
01:03:56,527 --> 01:03:57,812
Speaker 0: No, I didn't All right.

968
01:03:57,872 --> 01:04:07,243
Speaker 1: Well, uh, you know other kin theory entropes no People who think they're vampires or dragons or werewolves or anything like that.

969
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:09,089
Speaker 0: Yeah those scary people.

970
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:14,281
Speaker 1: well Otakin and this is a self-made term, but there seem to be a lot.

971
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,749
Speaker 1: I read a few serious business writings from these people.

972
01:04:20,011 --> 01:04:26,830
Speaker 1: They see manga or comics or sometimes it's something else and it's not like they identify with the character.

973
01:04:26,931 --> 01:04:30,330
Speaker 1: It's not like they like see parallels to the character.

974
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:34,342
Speaker 1: It's not like they feel a spiritual connection to like the story from the book.

975
01:04:35,145 --> 01:04:48,530
Speaker 1: It's that they believe somehow That they are that character or that their soul is that character and that book existed just to show them or that book Was written by someone who was channeled into their past life.

976
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:52,303
Speaker 0: And they're not jobs with psychological problems.

977
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:53,367
Speaker 0: Go see a shrink.

978
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:53,950
Speaker 0: end of story.

979
01:04:54,050 --> 01:05:02,670
Speaker 1: No, I think it's a much more interesting phenomenon because I don't think it's any different than all these other You know, but the theory entropes and the people are also not jobs.

980
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:02,921
Speaker 0: Well,

981
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:23,969
Speaker 1: no what I think it is is that a lot of people when they're young and they're going through puberty and just you know young becoming Adults becoming like adult sentient people they have feelings that they don't quite understand or explain and a lot of people attribute these to various Things but I think a lot of people attribute these to mystical experiences or to supernatural experiences or things along those lines.

982
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:36,310
Speaker 1: and I think at that point when you're a very impressionable person and you have experiences like that Your experiences tend to be shaped by the things that you think about a lot or the things that are going on in your life.

983
01:05:37,114 --> 01:05:51,077
Speaker 1: and I think this new phenomenon is coming out just because the primary audience of a lot of manga and comics these days are people who are in that time period and all these kind of subcultures are Psychologically almost identical.

984
01:05:51,157 --> 01:05:52,622
Speaker 1: and I think it's just what you've come across.

985
01:05:52,903 --> 01:06:00,190
Speaker 0: in my armchair psychologist kind of way I always viewed the people who think they're like You know a furry or they they sort of you know live in a fan.

986
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:00,874
Speaker 1: Well, it's not.

987
01:06:00,974 --> 01:06:02,081
Speaker 1: it's not hard to be a furry.

988
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:03,147
Speaker 1: You just have to like furry.

989
01:06:03,268 --> 01:06:10,730
Speaker 0: I know People actually think like I am a sea otter, you know, and like they you know that that's really what gets them.

990
01:06:11,352 --> 01:06:18,992
Speaker 0: I think that with those my armchair psychologist opinion is that those people have a very poor Self-image.

991
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:24,247
Speaker 0: So what they do is they replace the shitty self-image which in many cases is there's.

992
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:25,490
Speaker 0: they are a poor self-image.

993
01:06:25,651 --> 01:06:26,355
Speaker 0: I look down on that.

994
01:06:26,476 --> 01:06:34,350
Speaker 0: what they really are as well, you know, they're usually you know Kind of in people you don't want to hang around and they replace their own self-image with this.

995
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:34,932
Speaker 0: You know.

996
01:06:35,073 --> 01:06:43,470
Speaker 0: other image that they like say that their favorite character from you know Some anime and they say I'm not this shitty disgusting smelly stupid person that I am.

997
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:55,001
Speaker 0: I'm actually that other person that I really like and they replace their horrible self-image with a better self-image and then they sort of get Self-esteem, but it's not self-esteem for themselves It's self-esteem for what they wish they were.

998
01:06:55,021 --> 01:06:56,290
Speaker 0: and this is why it's a problem.

999
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:00,790
Speaker 1: You know, I would say that for I don't know I couldn't give a percentage but I maybe half of them.

1000
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:03,770
Speaker 1: I think that that is probably a somewhat valid assessment.

1001
01:07:03,870 --> 01:07:07,305
Speaker 1: But I think what I said is I think that I say we're both not psychologists.

1002
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:08,189
Speaker 0: So this is just woo.

1003
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:09,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's our guess.

1004
01:07:09,373 --> 01:07:13,830
Speaker 1: This is what makes sense to us what I will say because that's my opinions and not my opinions.

1005
01:07:13,992 --> 01:07:15,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have an opinion here.

1006
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:15,650
Speaker 0: I'm not a psycho.

1007
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:15,911
Speaker 0: My

1008
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:42,890
Speaker 1: opinion straight up is that it's it's almost more sad and I think I was talking to Emily about this and she brought this up a lot to that if someone's gonna have this kind of mystical experience or this like super like this thing in their life the spiritual idea and They base it on a Japanese comic they read as opposed to on something that just sprang from their creative consciousness It's like it's just like a one level down in terms of less sad.

1009
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:44,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, it.

1010
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:51,759
Speaker 1: I'd much rather someone believed something interesting that they made up than believe something That was just in a comic that some guy wrote to make money.

1011
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:52,401
Speaker 0: Mmm.

1012
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:59,862
Speaker 1: I mean I Would ask to one of these people so, uh, I'm actually Superman from Superman.

1013
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:04,123
Speaker 1: And if they think that's stupid well mirrors and such.

1014
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:04,585
Speaker 0: Yep.

1015
01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:06,130
Speaker 1: All right, maybe we could do one or two more.

1016
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:09,570
Speaker 1: I don't want a black maybe but my kettle is black.

1017
01:08:10,052 --> 01:08:12,024
Speaker 0: Do it do whatever you want go you wanna do another one.

1018
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:13,411
Speaker 0: do whatever you want It's up to you.

1019
01:08:13,873 --> 01:08:18,169
Speaker 1: Where do I get a good supply of one-shot Western comics along the lines of DMZ?

1020
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:21,707
Speaker 0: Amazon calm or in stock trades calm.

1021
01:08:21,768 --> 01:08:26,729
Speaker 1: next Why is it that the uglier the person the more sexual the cosplay costume they wear?

1022
01:08:27,551 --> 01:08:28,638
Speaker 1: That's not true at all.

1023
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,288
Speaker 1: That's just what stands out.

1024
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:35,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are hot people wearing hot costumes ugly people wearing cover-up costumes.

1025
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:36,950
Speaker 0: is there's all sorts of stuff going on.

1026
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,310
Speaker 0: It's a totally mixed up across the board.

1027
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:50,129
Speaker 0: It's just that when someone ugly or someone scary is wearing a particularly revealing and unattractive Costume it stands out like a little freaking don't know?

1028
01:08:51,013 --> 01:08:55,630
Speaker 1: Don't forget that there's a large subculture of the ironically bad cosplay.

1029
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,066
Speaker 1: You know a big fat guy who dresses like Sailor Moon, but that guy's cool.

1030
01:08:59,145 --> 01:09:00,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing It's you can't.

1031
01:09:01,457 --> 01:09:05,236
Speaker 1: don't just because you see someone in it like a scary cosplay Don't judge him based on that.

1032
01:09:05,336 --> 01:09:05,477
Speaker 1: now.

1033
01:09:05,899 --> 01:09:13,889
Speaker 1: if they also smell and tell you about their D&D character Then yeah, but if if you see Sailor Bubba Sailor Bubba is an awesome, dude.

1034
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:20,649
Speaker 0: Seriously, there's another question on here that has the same answer Which is why are the vast majority of cosplayers people that would never want to see naked?

1035
01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:22,948
Speaker 0: That's because those are the people that stand out like a sore thumb.

1036
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:28,250
Speaker 0: You don't notice all the completely average looking cosplayers because they don't stand out very much.

1037
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:30,149
Speaker 0: They're just mixing in with the herd.

1038
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,260
Speaker 0: You only notice the really hot ones and the really ugly ones.

1039
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:35,627
Speaker 1: now hot not isn't sexually attractive, but hot isn't.

1040
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:36,310
Speaker 1: damn.

1041
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,478
Speaker 1: That's a good cosplay exactly all right.

1042
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:41,750
Speaker 1: Let's end on this cuz I like this question all right as of today.

1043
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:42,193
Speaker 1: What is your?

1044
01:09:42,273 --> 01:09:44,709
Speaker 0: I like the one above it want to do both, okay?

1045
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:47,323
Speaker 1: All right, I'll ask this one, and then you do the other one.

1046
01:09:47,444 --> 01:09:52,029
Speaker 1: okay as of today What is your favorite AMV and what makes it so?

1047
01:09:53,657 --> 01:10:00,170
Speaker 1: I Have to say two because one is a hit me baby one more time set to utana.

1048
01:10:00,632 --> 01:10:02,782
Speaker 1: It's not the Britney Spears cover.

1049
01:10:03,023 --> 01:10:04,410
Speaker 1: well not really cover, but original.

1050
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:06,249
Speaker 1: It's a cover by a rock band.

1051
01:10:07,132 --> 01:10:14,572
Speaker 1: And I think that video aside from one comedic insertion is just amazing on levels that I really can't get into without Derailing the show.

1052
01:10:14,853 --> 01:10:20,610
Speaker 1: it's technically excellent the concept is solid the song fits perfectly and it's funny.

1053
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:24,325
Speaker 1: But if you've seen the show it's also really serious and really meaningful.

1054
01:10:24,365 --> 01:10:25,409
Speaker 1: It's just like the best AMV.

1055
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,817
Speaker 0: I will pick the Mambo Leo.

1056
01:10:28,298 --> 01:10:32,190
Speaker 1: the Mambo Leo is just one of those perfectly executed.

1057
01:10:32,692 --> 01:10:33,476
Speaker 1: Pump you up.

1058
01:10:33,657 --> 01:10:34,501
Speaker 1: so well done.

1059
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:35,907
Speaker 1: It's painful AMVs.

1060
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:40,281
Speaker 1: Yep In fact that was the last thing the last AMV.

1061
01:10:40,341 --> 01:10:42,067
Speaker 1: I ever showed at the RIT anime club.

1062
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:43,674
Speaker 0: all right Here's the question.

1063
01:10:43,694 --> 01:10:44,217
Speaker 0: That's good.

1064
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:44,820
Speaker 1: I got.

1065
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:45,644
Speaker 1: I got to say one more.

1066
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:47,912
Speaker 1: I got to jump in 25 25.

1067
01:10:47,912 --> 01:10:49,037
Speaker 0: that's okay.

1068
01:10:49,177 --> 01:10:51,828
Speaker 1: I think that is also one of the best anime music videos ever made.

1069
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:52,330
Speaker 1: It's a good one.

1070
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:52,974
Speaker 0: I think it's one of the best.

1071
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:55,610
Speaker 0: I think it is anyway all right.

1072
01:10:55,711 --> 01:10:58,069
Speaker 0: Here's a question that I could actually take up a whole episode with.

1073
01:10:59,072 --> 01:11:03,709
Speaker 0: If you could have any anime manga or video game mecha Which would you take now?

1074
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:11,530
Speaker 0: This is a very difficult question because do not be deceived if you're gonna ask which is the strongest you could say Voltron.

1075
01:11:11,691 --> 01:11:14,401
Speaker 0: But that might not be what I want with Voltron.

1076
01:11:14,461 --> 01:11:15,766
Speaker 0: I need four other people.

1077
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:16,690
Speaker 0: what a pain in the ass.

1078
01:11:17,272 --> 01:11:23,895
Speaker 1: Not only that, but you know it's relative because I would say that the only thing that could match Voltron would be I don't know the Ava.

1079
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah in an Ava.

1080
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:26,490
Speaker 0: You don't want that either.

1081
01:11:26,510 --> 01:11:27,879
Speaker 0: That's not practical for everyone.

1082
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,690
Speaker 1: use Ava's great, and I'd love an Ava.

1083
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,075
Speaker 1: Here's my problem with an Ava.

1084
01:11:31,657 --> 01:11:35,109
Speaker 1: that is not a world with Ava's is not a world you want to live in right.

1085
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,504
Speaker 0: so We're assuming that we're gonna live in the current existing world.

1086
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:42,057
Speaker 0: only I'm gonna have this robot So you know or mecha of some sort.

1087
01:11:42,077 --> 01:11:46,449
Speaker 1: so in that case oh, I almost said bokurano, but then I remembered right.

1088
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:52,050
Speaker 0: so You want to pick something that's incredibly practical and would make your life better like a Gundam would be a good choice.

1089
01:11:52,453 --> 01:11:54,205
Speaker 0: You know cuz a Gundam is very practical.

1090
01:11:54,225 --> 01:11:54,950
Speaker 0: for the normal world.

1091
01:11:55,030 --> 01:12:06,470
Speaker 0: It's usually no power especially something like the Zeta Gundam right or or freedom Gundam You know which can fly into and out of outer space and it can power itself and maintain itself.

1092
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:08,081
Speaker 0: You know I might a punk kid.

1093
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:08,564
Speaker 0: It's so easy.

1094
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:09,370
Speaker 0: a punk kid can fly.

1095
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:14,527
Speaker 1: I might go with a guy my left from Escaflowne because they just run on my soul or whatever.

1096
01:12:14,627 --> 01:12:15,590
Speaker 1: so they just work forever.

1097
01:12:16,531 --> 01:12:22,990
Speaker 0: Anything that requires too many people is right out and anything that is you know sort of requires a power source.

1098
01:12:23,412 --> 01:12:25,182
Speaker 0: It runs out of energy is sort of right out.

1099
01:12:25,202 --> 01:12:25,584
Speaker 1: You know what?

1100
01:12:25,685 --> 01:12:26,630
Speaker 1: there's an obvious answer.

1101
01:12:26,811 --> 01:12:28,500
Speaker 0: No, I have the obvious answer.

1102
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,250
Speaker 0: Oh no the big O is not so good.

1103
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:33,945
Speaker 0: Yes, it is not sort of in your full control all the time exactly.

1104
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:34,407
Speaker 0: You know what.

1105
01:12:34,488 --> 01:12:35,050
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter.

1106
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,647
Speaker 1: It's so cool that I take it anyway.

1107
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,416
Speaker 0: all right I have the perfect answer.

1108
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:43,398
Speaker 0: now the the first answer obviously is the most practical of all mecha Which is the Valkyrie from Macross.

1109
01:12:43,419 --> 01:12:45,530
Speaker 0: you know it turns to do a plane perfectly.

1110
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:49,822
Speaker 0: You know jet plane or a robot or the in-between right.

1111
01:12:49,903 --> 01:12:52,410
Speaker 0: the problem is just it's just little old Valkyrie.

1112
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,355
Speaker 0: It's not that powerful.

1113
01:12:53,395 --> 01:12:56,050
Speaker 0: I mean f-16s or f-22s could come and take you out.

1114
01:12:56,150 --> 01:13:07,510
Speaker 0: So you're not really king of the world which is why the obvious answer is the entire Sdf-1 Macross which comes with a whole fleet of Valkyries, so you have no problems there.

1115
01:13:08,631 --> 01:13:10,517
Speaker 1: You complain about needing four people.

1116
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:11,179
Speaker 1: now you need like.

1117
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,784
Speaker 0: there's the sdf-1 macross.

1118
01:13:12,864 --> 01:13:13,346
Speaker 0: see that's.

1119
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:18,690
Speaker 0: if you want to fly it around in Space and stuff you need a whole crew and a whole fleet of people and everything right.

1120
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:21,523
Speaker 0: But if you're just sitting on the ground it's gonna get full of dust.

1121
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:22,990
Speaker 1: you're not gonna mop that thing.

1122
01:13:23,191 --> 01:13:24,416
Speaker 0: You don't need to mop the thing.

1123
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:25,400
Speaker 0: It's self-repairing.

1124
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,605
Speaker 0: It's self powering.

1125
01:13:26,685 --> 01:13:27,750
Speaker 1: is it self mopping?

1126
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:29,456
Speaker 1: Yes, where does it say that?

1127
01:13:29,576 --> 01:13:32,506
Speaker 0: it's little robots that go around the ground and they clean it up.

1128
01:13:32,586 --> 01:13:33,630
Speaker 1: and who maintains those?

1129
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,859
Speaker 0: They maintain themselves.

1130
01:13:35,879 --> 01:13:38,370
