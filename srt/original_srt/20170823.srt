1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,907
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, August 23rd, 2017.

2
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:12,610
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,833
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:17,000
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, DuckTales!

5
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:18,083
Speaker 0: Woo!

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:18,707
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo.

7
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:20,839
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,170
Speaker 1: Alright.

9
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:29,790
Speaker 1: So you know how lately there seems to be this thing going on, especially on Twitch, with these marathons, right?

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,537
Speaker 1: They show like, all Bob Ross, all Mr.

11
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,139
Speaker 1: Rogers.

12
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:33,641
Speaker 1: Yeah!

13
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,010
Speaker 1: Crunchyroll did a marathon, like all these animes for a super long time.

14
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,674
Speaker 0: Remember RIT Anime, we do the marathons, like alright kids.

15
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,760
Speaker 1: No, but these are marathons like, you know, it's just.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,890
Speaker 1: basically we're gonna take this huge amount of content, put it end to end, and just stream it until it's done, right?

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,731
Speaker 1: And that's what they do.

18
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:58,249
Speaker 1: And I guess people tune into that, because I guess it's sort of like a temporary TV channel that only shows one thing, with ads or no ads, depending on your...

19
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:05,069
Speaker 0: And also, there's like one specific thing that that kind of thing does, it makes a pop-up community around that thing.

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,631
Speaker 0: Yep.

21
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:10,150
Speaker 0: Like the internet will talk about that thing, like suddenly you and all the Seinfeld people are talking about Seinfeld.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:20,370
Speaker 1: So I was thinking, what if we took every Geek Nights episode end to end, and just plugged it in and streamed it to like a Twitch channel and a YouTube channel.

23
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:22,970
Speaker 0: I could write a Python script that would...

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,170
Speaker 1: You just need to put all the episodes on a drive in a computer, connect that computer and just start streaming, and there'd be like a still image there while it streams.

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:29,571
Speaker 1: Yep.

26
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:34,510
Speaker 1: And it would just go from the first beta episode all the way to the end without stopping, all in one shot.

27
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,752
Speaker 1: That could actually be kind of fun.

28
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:54,130
Speaker 1: And see if, like would anyone give a shit, or would that just sit there, or it's like, cause the thing is, like I've noticed when you're streaming, it's like the way to get people in the stream is you have to stream long, cause you get one person, and you have to get a few viewers, and then once you have some viewers, your view count goes up, and then you can get more viewers.

29
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,130
Speaker 1: We have to stay on long enough for that to happen, and I can't play games longer than a few hours.

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,992
Speaker 0: Well the part of it is that...

31
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:02,461
Speaker 1: A lot of times I've stopped streaming when I have the most viewers, like eight viewers.

32
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:06,110
Speaker 1: finally, because it's been like three hours guys, where were you when I started?

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:06,331
Speaker 0: Yep.

34
00:02:06,351 --> 00:02:09,449
Speaker 0: Well that's probably why I don't do the Twitch, like I focus more on the YouTube for a lot of reasons.

35
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:12,764
Speaker 1: I just do both at the same time, cause you have the technology for that.

36
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,110
Speaker 0: Split those views even more.

37
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,192
Speaker 1: I don't really care about that.

38
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:25,210
Speaker 1: But, uh, so what if we just like streamed every Geek Nights episode, the audio, non-stop, would that be, would anyone give a shit?

39
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,090
Speaker 0: That would be like twelve hundred hours.

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,789
Speaker 0: It would be ridiculously long.

41
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,030
Speaker 0: That would be like twelve hundred hours of content.

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,147
Speaker 1: How many days is that?

43
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:40,010
Speaker 0: Twelve hundred hours divided by twenty four, that's fifty days.

44
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:50,430
Speaker 1: Uh, it didn't take fifty days, so we've done more Geek Nights, even though it's only been less years or whatever, it's like, how many hours does it take to watch all the Simpsons?

45
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:54,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, well so... They've been going longer, but they only did once a week.

46
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,630
Speaker 0: God, I just remember as a kid watching like the two hundredth episode special.

47
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,450
Speaker 1: Their episodes are only twenty minutes, and they don't do the whole year, they only do a season.

48
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,350
Speaker 1: It's like, is there actually more hours of Geek Nights than there are most other things?

49
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:13,130
Speaker 0: I mean, I watched almost all of Sailor Moon, like everything but the first season and one weekend once.

50
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:22,230
Speaker 1: I mean, in order to like beat us in hours, you start to have to go into things that are like questionable, like, oh, okay, there have been more hours of all baseball games ever.

51
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:22,646
Speaker 1: Yup.

52
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:23,668
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah.

53
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,530
Speaker 0: That channel that's just the guy sitting and meditating all the time, like, I think there's more hours of that than Geek Nights.

54
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like, we need, you know, uh...

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,909
Speaker 0: Actually, no, because he only started that like four years ago.

56
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,969
Speaker 1: But I wonder, like, is this a thing we should do?

57
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:35,630
Speaker 1: Yeah.

58
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:39,550
Speaker 1: Is it, was it worthwhile or will it just be a complete waste of bandwidth?

59
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,650
Speaker 0: It would probably, well, I don't care about bandwidth.

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:45,349
Speaker 0: I mean, people make those ten hours of poop, like fart noise videos on YouTube.

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,250
Speaker 1: But like obviously we would, uh, we would have a server that would be doing the streaming.

62
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,429
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, we set up an Amazon instance.

63
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,970
Speaker 1: We would not be doing it in our house.

64
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,530
Speaker 0: You set up an Amazon instance, you point it at the S3 bucket that we got.

65
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,750
Speaker 1: And I write a little, a little RTMP thing and it would use, I'd use the restream.io that I'm already using.

66
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,650
Speaker 1: We might even have to make separate YouTube and Switch channels just for this only.

67
00:04:05,932 --> 00:04:07,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'd probably want to make like the Geek Nights archive.

68
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:14,030
Speaker 1: We'd make a graphic to show in the thing that has like links to actual Geek Nights info and then just turn it on.

69
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,290
Speaker 0: It'd take like a day's worth of work to make that happen, I think.

70
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,790
Speaker 1: And then turn it on and then we'd make sure that it's still running.

71
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,029
Speaker 1: We need like a monitoring of some kind because I could imagine it failing.

72
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could imagine something like that failing at like the 31 day mark.

73
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:29,530
Speaker 1: We need, we need to go, we need to go poke at it to make sure it's still good.

74
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,250
Speaker 0: It's like running a video room at a modern anime con.

75
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,090
Speaker 0: The computer's just going, you gotta like peek at it.

76
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,830
Speaker 1: The question is, is it worth doing?

77
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:37,533
Speaker 0: I don't know.

78
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:40,289
Speaker 0: I feel like I want to now just for the fuck of it.

79
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:40,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

80
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:41,553
Speaker 0: Yeah.

81
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:42,989
Speaker 0: People seem into it here.

82
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:57,450
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the actual news, in case you didn't listen to our Monday episode on passwords, which you probably should because I actually know two different people who had a similar hack happen to them like recently.

83
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,876
Speaker 0: This is on the rise.

84
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:01,470
Speaker 0: Now, most people seem to be hacking this way to steal Bitcoins.

85
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,649
Speaker 0: It was notable that they did this to steal.

86
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,470
Speaker 1: That's when people use the word hacking, right?

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:27,750
Speaker 1: Because hacking, regardless of how you define hacking, when you say, for example, my account got hacked, that implies in the minds of the average person that some nefarious computer genius with a black screen and green text, you know, work some magic and types of magic codes and now has control of your account due to nefarious means.

88
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:36,490
Speaker 1: When actually all it means is someone, you know, or some bot or something figured out your password because your password is ridiculous.

89
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,532
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no.

90
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:38,656
Speaker 0: None of these situations.

91
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:42,070
Speaker 0: None of the situations I'm talking about involved ever getting someone's password.

92
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:50,910
Speaker 0: Every case is someone cloning your SIM card and then taking advantage of account recovery to then steal your accounts.

93
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,029
Speaker 1: That happens also.

94
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,650
Speaker 0: And that happens all the time because it's still not black screen, green text, evil genius.

95
00:05:56,951 --> 00:06:04,710
Speaker 0: No, it's the fact that T-Mobile and Verizon and all those companies, they'll basically give any hobo off the street your phone.

96
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,969
Speaker 0: Like, they'll clone your SIM and give it to a hobo with no ID.

97
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:16,950
Speaker 0: And that's a big problem because a lot of websites, if you have a phone, you can usually recover, and I'm making air quotes, the account.

98
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,529
Speaker 0: But anyway, that's happened to two people I know in the last week and a half.

99
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:26,604
Speaker 0: And in both cases, it was the SIM card cloning situation.

100
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:28,270
Speaker 0: And in both cases, it was Teemo.

101
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,530
Speaker 0: But I saw another account of a friend of a friend that was Verizon.

102
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,476
Speaker 0: So yeah, but that happened to Anime News Network.

103
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:42,370
Speaker 0: So even as of Dateline right now, they still don't have the Anime News Network domain back.

104
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,276
Speaker 1: Incompetent IT.

105
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:47,830
Speaker 1: They did not take Geeknight's advice in advance.

106
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:50,442
Speaker 0: I mean, the real problem is that...

107
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,330
Speaker 1: If you get Geeknight's anything, you will not succeed.

108
00:06:55,692 --> 00:06:57,443
Speaker 0: I'll bet I could get a cloning or SIM card.

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:06:59,631
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.

110
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:09,322
Speaker 1: I'm saying you could not move the DNS for Frontruker.com, and you could not easily... I guess you might have passwords because I might have given them to you.

111
00:07:09,382 --> 00:07:10,790
Speaker 1: I don't know if your keys are on there.

112
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,190
Speaker 0: I'm assuming I don't have passwords.

113
00:07:13,152 --> 00:07:17,030
Speaker 1: I mean, it's posted on Linode, which has a real two-factor, so good luck logging in.

114
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,970
Speaker 0: And the Amazon stuff is also a real two-factor.

115
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,367
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, yep.

116
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:25,870
Speaker 0: Do not construe what we just said as a challenge, you jerks out there.

117
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:32,750
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not Fort Knox, but we basically do all the normal best practices that I tell everyone to do, and we haven't had a problem.

118
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:46,629
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you tried to go to Anime News Network and you think it's down, you temporarily have to go to AnimeNewsNetwork.cc while they, I assume, sue or whatever to get their real domain back from the people who stole it from them.

119
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,990
Speaker 0: So yeah, in other news, Scott went to FlameCon, as did Emily, and I biked around all day instead.

120
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,230
Speaker 1: I wanted to bike around all day, but I went to FlameCon.

121
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:56,510
Speaker 0: I should have gone to FlameCon.

122
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,746
Speaker 1: So FlameCon, if you don't know, is a Comic-Con much like, say, MOCA, right?

123
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:02,870
Speaker 1: It's not like newer Comic-Con.

124
00:08:04,271 --> 00:08:08,990
Speaker 1: However, it's a room full of, you know, it's basically an artist alley, really, right?

125
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:12,790
Speaker 1: In one big room in a hotel, one hotel ballroom.

126
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,208
Speaker 0: Like SPX or TKF.

127
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:27,810
Speaker 1: It also had a gaming room, which was, like, at the level of, say, an Anime Boston gaming room, only a little more organized and, you know, bright, more brightly lit, and much more well advertised and patronized.

128
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:35,370
Speaker 1: And also, it had a few panel rooms that were heavily scheduled, unlike, say, a MOCA, right?

129
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,309
Speaker 1: You know, it had full panel schedules for all the days in there.

130
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:41,370
Speaker 1: I think it's a two day, I'm pretty sure it's two days, Saturday, Sunday.

131
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,210
Speaker 1: There was no Friday at this time.

132
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:51,330
Speaker 1: So we went for, like, just a few hours to walk around and see all the tables because there were many people that I knew who had tables there.

133
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,910
Speaker 1: There were a few tables with, like, super pro Marvel DC type people.

134
00:08:56,492 --> 00:09:00,310
Speaker 1: You know, there were serious, for real, comic publishers there, right, with tables.

135
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:05,130
Speaker 1: And the rest were mostly, you know, indie webcomic level people, you know.

136
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:08,589
Speaker 1: But none of the, I didn't see a single booth there.

137
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:17,830
Speaker 1: We usually go to one of these things and you see, like, the sad booth and it's like, wow, it's dude with, like, super sad comics that, you know, are really poorly drawn.

138
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:18,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

139
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,470
Speaker 1: Not a one of those did I see, right?

140
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:31,090
Speaker 1: The other thing about FlameCon, obviously, if you didn't guess by the name, is that it's a Comic-Con specifically for LGBTQ, et cetera, et cetera, you know, peoples, right?

141
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,570
Speaker 1: That's not to say that every person selling comics there was, you know, non-straight.

142
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:39,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, more than it's a focus for the convention.

143
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,890
Speaker 1: That is the focus of the convention is purpose, right?

144
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:52,570
Speaker 1: Even though not all of the content is that way, not all the creators are that way, but, you know, everyone there is obviously friendly in that regards, right?

145
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:55,630
Speaker 1: No homophobes in the room, not one, right?

146
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,109
Speaker 1: They would be very, very uncomfortable.

147
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,850
Speaker 1: That would be like someone with arachnophobia going to the Spider-Con.

148
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:05,889
Speaker 1: It wouldn't happen, you know, it's like the safest space.

149
00:10:06,655 --> 00:10:08,830
Speaker 1: And also because of that, right?

150
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:16,890
Speaker 1: You know, compared to say a mocha, just the general atmosphere was way more friendly, way more energetic, way more happening.

151
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:29,790
Speaker 1: And obviously it also, you know, some of the content, a significant percentage of it was obviously, you know, yuri, yaoi, sexy, erotic, et cetera, in some way.

152
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:31,789
Speaker 1: But most of it wasn't.

153
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,929
Speaker 1: It still wasn't even the majority, right, was that kind of stuff.

154
00:10:35,533 --> 00:10:38,110
Speaker 1: You know, and also that stuff is totally awesome anyway.

155
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,710
Speaker 0: Emily went, she bought a whole bunch of comics and like met a bunch of people and it was sort of an extra power weekend because there was that play event the same weekend.

156
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:56,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, the play NYC, which is, play NYC is like, it's a gaming con in New York, which is, you know, one of, you know, it's one of them, but it's not, it's the kind where you go to where there's...

157
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,010
Speaker 0: Try a bunch of indie games.

158
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:04,870
Speaker 1: There's a ton of indie game developers, all with tables all over the place showing off their indie games and not the kind where you can sit around playing board games, the kind we want.

159
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:05,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, the kind that we're going to make.

160
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:08,450
Speaker 0: But yeah, FlameCon is awesome.

161
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,050
Speaker 0: The other thing that was awesome and combined, it meant that a lot of people were in New York last weekend.

162
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:22,010
Speaker 0: So if you're ever in New York, like if you want to, like if you had to choose between Mocha Fest and FlameCon in New York, I think FlameCon is the better con.

164
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:23,070
Speaker 1: FlameCon, I think, yeah.

165
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,270
Speaker 1: I mean, you're getting about as much time spent there, right?

166
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:28,747
Speaker 1: It's at a better time of year, right?

167
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,430
Speaker 1: August is certainly better than what, April or whatever.

168
00:11:31,512 --> 00:11:32,470
Speaker 1: It's warmer and nicer.

169
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but super nice out.

170
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,310
Speaker 1: It's in, the only thing is it's in Brooklyn.

171
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:39,809
Speaker 1: So if you're like touristing in Manhattan, Mocha is a more convenient location, I guess.

172
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:49,110
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like if I had to choose between the two, at least in their current states, I mean, Mocha's heyday is way better than the current of either two, right?

173
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:52,170
Speaker 1: But Mocha has gone so far downhill and FlameCon exists.

174
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,070
Speaker 1: So it's like, well, might as well go to the FlameCon.

175
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:02,810
Speaker 1: I think FlameCon costs more money, but it doesn't matter because you're getting panel content if you actually stay at FlameCon, which Mocha has very little panel content.

176
00:12:02,952 --> 00:12:04,229
Speaker 1: Not much to speak of at all.

177
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:13,210
Speaker 1: Whereas the FlameCon panel content, while I didn't go to any, I could tell from looking at the schedule and being a panel expert type person that it was quite excellent.

178
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,670
Speaker 1: And it was in multiple rooms and lasted the whole con.

179
00:12:17,374 --> 00:12:19,009
Speaker 1: So, you know, it was worth, probably worth going to.

180
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,493
Speaker 0: So the only reason I didn't go.

181
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:27,350
Speaker 0: really was that because all these people were in town for the weekend, Ghost of Miami, we had the launch party because we launched it.

182
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,989
Speaker 0: It's live.

183
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:29,650
Speaker 0: You can buy Ghost of Miami.

184
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,749
Speaker 1: What is Ghost of Miami?

185
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:35,449
Speaker 0: It's a visual novel that's... Imagine visual novels set in like...

186
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,809
Speaker 1: But I'm already dating dads.

187
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,143
Speaker 1: Why would I go to this other group?

188
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,669
Speaker 0: It's more like Phoenix Wright.

189
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:48,010
Speaker 0: It's not just... It's like literally you're a PI in Miami in 1986 and you solve cases Phoenix Wright style.

190
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,729
Speaker 0: Like, do you go check out the docs or talk to that shady dude?

191
00:12:52,511 --> 00:13:00,050
Speaker 0: And you're always kind of torn between, on one hand, romancing the various people and on the other hand, actually solving the case.

192
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:01,822
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of endings.

193
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:02,569
Speaker 0: There's good stuff there.

194
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:15,110
Speaker 0: I have a vested interest in this game succeeding, but also we had a really rocking after party after FlameCon and the play event at a bar called the Hinterlands in Brooklyn, like way out, like in Flatbush.

195
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:15,869
Speaker 1: In the Hinterlands?

196
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,304
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,550
Speaker 0: But one interesting thing about that bar that was actually pretty cool.

198
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,530
Speaker 0: We went to it and we just wanted a quiet place, like hang out.

199
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:29,070
Speaker 0: And I go in and it looks like there's a big crowd in the front and there's a guy with a microphone and it looks like it's going to be loud.

200
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,084
Speaker 0: But then we get in and you know what's going on?

201
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:31,950
Speaker 0: Trivia.

202
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,749
Speaker 0: And you know what was notable about that trivia?

203
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,386
Speaker 0: It was good and nerdy.

204
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,579
Speaker 1: There's a lot of nerdy trivia out there.

205
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:40,410
Speaker 1: There's an Astoria, there's multiple nerdy trivia.

206
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like the bar, like the Baroness tried to do trivia a few times and they just... It was the, you can just stop trying to make this happen situation.

207
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:51,409
Speaker 0: But at this bar, like these people were into this trivia.

208
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:51,671
Speaker 1: Right.

209
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:53,930
Speaker 1: That's the thing is you can't just have a trivia at a bar.

210
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:59,190
Speaker 1: You need to actually create like a trivia community at the bar and certain bars have it and some don't, right?

211
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,930
Speaker 1: So it's like, if you ask around, people will tell you, these are the bars that have the trivia where people come and they already have teams and they already have, you know, the shit going on.

212
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:07,431
Speaker 1: Right.

213
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,656
Speaker 1: And then you have to like join a team and be friends with people.

214
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:14,870
Speaker 1: The thing is, uh, I'm not into trivia enough to want to do it more than like once in a while.

215
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,033
Speaker 0: See, I think I'm not.

216
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:19,590
Speaker 0: But then when I was there, like my quiz bowl blood came back.

217
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, whenever there is a trivia, I'm like, oh baby.

218
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,530
Speaker 1: But then it's like I couldn't do a trivia every week and we get old real fast.

219
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,717
Speaker 1: And also I don't drink alcohol.

220
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:31,610
Speaker 1: And most of the purpose of the trivia is to get you to go to a bar and drink alcohol.

221
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,391
Speaker 0: Ah, it depends.

222
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:39,830
Speaker 0: So I often, when I did go to trivia, like when I used to do it a lot, I went to trivia at bars during the day.

223
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,602
Speaker 1: You never see any bakery trivia, right?

224
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,730
Speaker 1: It's always bar trivia.

225
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I was like a teenager and I went to bars during the day where they did trivia and no one was drinking.

226
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:50,108
Speaker 1: Anyway.

227
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,653
Speaker 0: Anyway.

228
00:14:51,794 --> 00:14:53,058
Speaker 0: Otherwise, some other news.

229
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:56,250
Speaker 0: I found this essay and I've been hanging out at the link for a long time.

230
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,470
Speaker 0: And I just want to bring it up because Giant Robo.

231
00:14:59,351 --> 00:14:59,909
Speaker 1: Uh, you and a Giant Robo.

232
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,155
Speaker 0: Is one of my favorite anime.

233
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:08,010
Speaker 0: It's like, it's a fantastic, weird show that has a, like, if you think the show is weird.

234
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:08,604
Speaker 1: Overrated.

235
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,413
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

236
00:15:11,513 --> 00:15:19,130
Speaker 1: Amongst people who don't know about Giant Robo or never heard of it or aren't like, you know, super anime fans who know about obscure shit, it's underrated.

237
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,141
Speaker 1: But amongst people who know Giant Robo, it's overrated.

238
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,606
Speaker 1: They act like it's the God of God.

239
00:15:23,706 --> 00:15:24,590
Speaker 1: anime is when it's just.

240
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,029
Speaker 0: I think, I think it's in the top 10 or 15 though.

241
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:35,470
Speaker 0: Because it's so unique and also the story of how it got made and why it got made.

242
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a great story.

243
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,370
Speaker 1: It doesn't make the anime.

244
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,807
Speaker 0: Also, it has one of the best, most operatic soundtracks I have ever seen.

245
00:15:41,847 --> 00:15:42,470
Speaker 0: Like the score.

246
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,070
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

247
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:49,150
Speaker 0: What anime has a more like motif driven operatic score?

248
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:51,088
Speaker 1: Uh, Evangelion.

249
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:53,964
Speaker 0: I would not call Evangelion's operatic.

250
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,829
Speaker 0: It's a different style.

251
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:56,089
Speaker 1: Uh, Escaflowne.

252
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,430
Speaker 0: Uh, Escaflowne is more symphonic.

253
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,543
Speaker 1: I mean, you're going to argue about music shit.

254
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:02,849
Speaker 1: I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.

255
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:03,890
Speaker 1: I'm just saying.

256
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,670
Speaker 1: The point is the soundtrack, whatever, even if you want to narrow it to saying it's the best in some specific genre, whatever, right?

257
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,810
Speaker 1: It's not, I think Trigon has a better sound.

258
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:21,970
Speaker 0: Giant Robo is one of those few things, much like the Matrix or Star Wars, where if I see any amount of it, I have a desire to just watch the rest of it from that point.

259
00:16:22,193 --> 00:16:22,547
Speaker 1: I do not.

260
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,070
Speaker 0: Uh, so if you ever, if you're not like Scott and you actually have feelings, Gundam Shit has a better sound.

261
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:36,950
Speaker 0: Read this essay because this essay I'm going to link to actually does a really good job of capturing what it is that I like so much about Giant Robo.

262
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,409
Speaker 1: It was written by some Giant Robo fanboy.

263
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,790
Speaker 0: No, this is actually a really like well-researched, uh, like well-written essay.

264
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,790
Speaker 1: Someone who well-researched Giant Robo is a Giant Robo fanboy.

265
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:48,610
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know why you're so weirdly down on Giant Robo.

266
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,054
Speaker 1: I'm not weirdly down on it.

267
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,206
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's, oh, it's not, everyone makes out like it's so amazing.

268
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,130
Speaker 1: It's only, aight.

269
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,189
Speaker 0: I think you personally underrate it.

270
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:56,707
Speaker 0: Nah.

271
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,376
Speaker 1: I don't know.

272
00:16:58,457 --> 00:16:59,630
Speaker 0: Giant Robo is real good.

273
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:09,369
Speaker 0: And frankly, if you've never seen Giant Robo, if nothing else, just go find the first episode of it and watch it because it starts in the middle of a train chase.

274
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:12,630
Speaker 0: And you don't even know who the good guys are, the bad guys or anything.

275
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,349
Speaker 0: And it just escalates from there.

276
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,690
Speaker 1: I finished it and I don't know who the good guys are, the bad guys or anything.

277
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:16,893
Speaker 1: What?

278
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:17,950
Speaker 0: It's really straightforward.

279
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:18,556
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

280
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,310
Speaker 0: What do you think happened?

281
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,128
Speaker 1: The bad guys are just too cool, so I got, they seem like good guys to me.

282
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:28,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the impact is the best good guy, bad guy in all the history of anime, possibly.

283
00:17:29,194 --> 00:17:29,242
Speaker 0: No.

284
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,072
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

285
00:17:32,513 --> 00:17:39,070
Speaker 0: And in other minor news, uh, Scott's not watching it for some reason, but I've watched a whole ton of the Little Witch Academia show.

286
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,830
Speaker 1: I know I got to pay for Netflix at the right time, you see, because in September there's going to be some South Park.

287
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:46,590
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to pay for Hulu.

288
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:53,010
Speaker 1: And once the South Park season ends, then, and if there's nothing to watch on Crunchyroll, then I'll pay for Netflix, right?

289
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,290
Speaker 1: You see, you don't want to pay for more than one of these things at a time because then you're just throwing money in a giant pit of fire.

290
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,495
Speaker 1: Might as well buy lottery tickets.

291
00:17:58,797 --> 00:18:01,730
Speaker 1: The lottery tonight is like a jillion dollars, still not buying tickets.

292
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:06,090
Speaker 0: I just can't be bothered, so I just pay for Crunchyroll and Netflix and I just never stop paying for them.

293
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:09,210
Speaker 0: Only Hulu do I start and stop based around South Park.

294
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,789
Speaker 1: I only pay for the one I'm using at the time, so right now I'm only paying...

295
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,790
Speaker 0: I use Netflix and Hulu equally all the time.

296
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,509
Speaker 1: I'm only paying for Crunchyroll right now.

297
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:23,288
Speaker 0: But anyway, Little Witch Academia, if you haven't actually seen like the original OAV...

298
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,490
Speaker 1: Oh, and YouTube Red, but I always pay for YouTube Red because I watch YouTube more than anything.

299
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:27,410
Speaker 0: I don't pay for YouTube Red.

300
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,590
Speaker 1: I watch YouTube more than anything.

301
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,949
Speaker 0: I just use Adblock for now.

302
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,350
Speaker 1: I watch a lot of YouTube on device on the official YouTube app.

303
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,283
Speaker 0: I only watch YouTube on TVs.

304
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,350
Speaker 0: I never watch it mobile.

305
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,819
Speaker 1: I watch it mobile frequently.

306
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:40,130
Speaker 1: In bed with my iPad.

307
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:55,850
Speaker 0: But usually, in the history of anime, if you have the situation where there's an OAV or a special or a movie that is good or fondly remembered, there might be some people who then take that and make a long, drawn out, bad TV show version of it.

308
00:18:55,931 --> 00:18:56,429
Speaker 1: Read or Die?

309
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,730
Speaker 0: Tenchi Muyo, El Hazard vs El Hazard the Wanderer.

310
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:03,592
Speaker 1: Pat LeBourg TV Season 2?

311
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:03,745
Speaker 1: Yup.

312
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,610
Speaker 1: It's not bad, but it's not as good as say Pat LeBourg OAV or Pat LeBourg movie or Pat LeBourg TV Season 1.

313
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,430
Speaker 1: It is the opposite.

314
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:18,790
Speaker 0: And I think the reason is, in this case, the TV show is what they wanted to make, but what the specials were was like the minimum viable.

315
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,930
Speaker 0: They had to cram as much as they could into a tiny special and then they kickstarted a slightly less tiny special.

316
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,088
Speaker 0: And then the show was, "Okay, now we're going to make what we actually wanted to

317
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:28,309
Speaker 0: make.".

318
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:29,702
Speaker 0: It is great.

319
00:19:31,072 --> 00:19:32,569
Speaker 0: And every episode just gets better.

320
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,390
Speaker 1: How come Studio Trigger was able to get real anime and they didn't have to kickstart Kill la Kill?

321
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:41,430
Speaker 1: They didn't have to kickstart, oh I guess Inferno Cop doesn't even need money.

322
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,663
Speaker 0: They only kickstarted that second special.

323
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,970
Speaker 1: Right, but why does Little Witch Academia need kickstarting where the other things didn't?

324
00:19:50,151 --> 00:19:50,830
Speaker 1: I don't know, whatever.

325
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:54,950
Speaker 1: Didn't the original Little Witch Academia get kickstarted?

326
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,570
Speaker 0: No, I'm pretty sure the original Little Witch Academia was part of that Young Animators project.

327
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:00,390
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

328
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:05,610
Speaker 0: It was a Young Animators training thing and it was made as sort of like an experimental film.

329
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:06,084
Speaker 1: We'll see.

330
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,878
Speaker 1: But anyway, the TV show is so great.

331
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:11,337
Speaker 0: I'm sure it is.

332
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,090
Speaker 0: I believe it.

333
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,550
Speaker 0: And if you have fond memories of Mahou Tsekai Tai, this just picks up where that left off.

334
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,749
Speaker 1: Mahou Tsekai Tai, better than Giant Robo.

335
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:28,929
Speaker 0: I'd say Mahou Tsekai Tai, the original show, OAV, nothing after that, is nearly equal to Giant Robo.

336
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:31,850
Speaker 1: Definitely better than Giant Robo.

337
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,250
Speaker 0: Not nearly as deep as Giant Robo.

338
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,767
Speaker 0: Giant Robo being as deep as Big O.

339
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,950
Speaker 1: And Big O is way better than Giant Robo.

340
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,930
Speaker 0: I would say it is not better than Giant Robo.

341
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:46,730
Speaker 0: It's not as well animated.

342
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:47,729
Speaker 1: Significantly better.

343
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:59,238
Speaker 0: Nah, I think Giant... The problem is, I can't talk about why I feel so strongly about these two differences without spoiling the ever-living hell out of Big O. And Big O is spoilable.

344
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:01,770
Speaker 0: It's way deeper than you think it is if you haven't seen it all.

345
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:06,683
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you have Netflix, just watch Little Witch Academia right now.

346
00:21:06,803 --> 00:21:09,290
Speaker 0: Skip any other anime until you have seen it.

347
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:10,170
Speaker 0: It is so delightful.

348
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,882
Speaker 1: It probably is the best anime to see at the moment.

349
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:14,790
Speaker 1: that is an out now kind of thing.

350
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,540
Speaker 0: It's girl-driven Harry Potter with magical delights.

351
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,384
Speaker 0: Every episode is super unique.

352
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,448
Speaker 0: I have nothing but praise for the show.

353
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,390
Speaker 0: It's A anime.

354
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:32,280
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

355
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:40,120
Speaker 0: So, many of you know that I, as a kid, was not just a fan of roller coasters like pretty much every kid is, but I was a roller coaster nerd.

356
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,420
Speaker 0: Like, I know a lot about roller coasters and I get mad at the design of roller coasters.

357
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,305
Speaker 0: Case in point, the Hollywood Rocket.

358
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:53,000
Speaker 0: There's a reason that roller coaster feels weird because it was just a naively designed roller coaster, but I digress.

359
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:01,980
Speaker 0: So, there was a rumor for a while recently because Cedar Point had, for a while, the tallest and biggest and fastest wooden coaster in the world.

360
00:22:02,341 --> 00:22:05,893
Speaker 0: Wooden meaning traditional cyclone-style roller coaster.

361
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,900
Speaker 0: Like, flat metal slats.

362
00:22:08,081 --> 00:22:09,679
Speaker 1: It has rails just like a train does.

363
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:10,904
Speaker 0: Not even.

364
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:13,194
Speaker 0: So, they're not actually rails like a train.

365
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:14,380
Speaker 0: That would be more like a steel coaster.

366
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:23,540
Speaker 0: It has slat rails, meaning it's wood with thin, flat pieces of metal that are just laying there and the cars roll on top of it.

367
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,140
Speaker 0: Rails, like on a train, have a rounded sort of beveled top and the wheels actually work very differently.

368
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,120
Speaker 0: I'm not going to get into all the details of all that and what a steel coaster is, but anyway.

369
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,860
Speaker 1: So, you could have a roller coaster where the structure of the roller coaster is completely made of wood.

370
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,420
Speaker 1: All these wooden trusses and wooden... But it still counts as not wooden?

371
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,140
Speaker 0: Yep, if you have steel tubes or steel rails that are not slat rails.

372
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking about wooden tracks.

373
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:54,440
Speaker 1: It's a wooden structure, but the rails look like the subway train rails.

374
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:56,380
Speaker 1: That's not a wooden roller coaster?

375
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,120
Speaker 0: That would be a steel coaster in most cases.

376
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:03,020
Speaker 0: But anyway, the slat coasters are the ones that are known for a few things.

377
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,707
Speaker 0: One, they're known for an old-timey feel.

378
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:07,380
Speaker 0: They're known for giving you severe headaches if you ride them.

379
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,760
Speaker 0: And they require insane amounts of maintenance.

380
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,480
Speaker 0: So, Cedar Point had this gigantic... This roller coaster is so long it's stupid.

381
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:34,920
Speaker 0: And they were shut it down, but a bunch of roller coaster nerds snuck into the park and were taking pictures and noticed that the executives of RMC, which is a company that's known for rehabilitating or rebuilding old wooden coasters, were meeting with Cedar Point officials on location.

382
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,180
Speaker 0: And they finally announced and revealed recently, this video, my thing of the day, is a POV video of the render.

383
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,367
Speaker 0: This isn't the coaster.

384
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:44,950
Speaker 0: It's not done yet.

385
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,419
Speaker 0: This is clearly a render of some kind.

386
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:50,140
Speaker 0: Of what they're doing with this old wooden coaster.

387
00:23:50,482 --> 00:23:54,180
Speaker 0: They're turning it into a new kind of coaster called a hybrid coaster.

388
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 0: And it's going to be the tallest, fastest one in the world.

389
00:23:57,961 --> 00:24:05,120
Speaker 0: It's basically using the same old wooden superstructure, but the original coaster is an old DIN Corporation coaster.

390
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,220
Speaker 0: It's like standard wooden coaster.

391
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:11,119
Speaker 0: RMC is known for taking that and doing modern stuff.

392
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,527
Speaker 0: So, if... What?

393
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:14,553
Speaker 0: You don't like roller coasters?

394
00:24:15,216 --> 00:24:16,060
Speaker 1: You don't want to ride a roller coaster?

395
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,819
Speaker 1: I just like rolling them, but I don't need to hear any of this.

396
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:20,099
Speaker 0: That's the stuff I care about because I'm a nerd.

397
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,124
Speaker 1: You go there and you ride.

398
00:24:21,144 --> 00:24:22,111
Speaker 1: You don't care where they're made.

399
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,580
Speaker 1: You go to the park, you ride everything.

400
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:30,740
Speaker 0: No, I care about that a lot because if a coaster is not Intamin or B&M, odds are it's not great unless it's an old DIN coaster.

401
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,687
Speaker 1: You paid to get into the park.

402
00:24:31,708 --> 00:24:36,060
Speaker 1: They don't charge you to ride all... You pay one price, you ride as much as you want, so ride everything.

403
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:43,560
Speaker 0: You would be better off going to Cedar Point and just riding Millennium Force over and over and over again than you would be riding every coaster at some other parks.

404
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:46,500
Speaker 0: I'll stand by that statement.

405
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,566
Speaker 0: What's extra interesting to me... This is just a POV.

406
00:24:49,606 --> 00:25:01,600
Speaker 0: You watch this and it's just crazy to watch it when you realize that it... This is what you could have done with a wooden coaster had this technology existed back when they were making wooden coasters.

407
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:08,700
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I would not have watched this video, though, because one thing that I was always afraid of was roller coaster spoilers.

408
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:10,860
Speaker 1: That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

409
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,129
Speaker 1: I don't even believe in movie spoilers.

410
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:15,000
Speaker 1: You definitely know such a thing as roller coaster spoilers.

411
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,623
Speaker 1: Guess what, guys?

412
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,030
Speaker 1: It goes up and then it goes down.

413
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:23,740
Speaker 0: A big spoiler on this one is that wooden coasters do not have inversions.

414
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:30,120
Speaker 0: This technology, the kind of hybrid they're making, this wooden coaster goes upside down a bunch of times.

415
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:31,299
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

416
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,419
Speaker 0: And the first hill is crazy because it's a 90 degree angle.

417
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,619
Speaker 1: You're literally going straight down?

418
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,317
Speaker 0: Straight down.

419
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:41,204
Speaker 1: Okay.

420
00:25:41,446 --> 00:25:43,080
Speaker 1: For a very brief moment.

421
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:47,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, even the tallest coasters are not going down for that long.

422
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,280
Speaker 0: I mean... But yeah, next year, because I didn't get to go this year, I'm going to go to Cedar Point.

423
00:25:52,902 --> 00:25:55,520
Speaker 0: And this coaster actually looks like it's going to be really amazing.

424
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,660
Speaker 0: And I don't mourn that Mean Streak is dead because Mean Streak literally gave me a splitting headache every time I rode it in my entire life.

425
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,604
Speaker 1: Anyway, all right.

426
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,920
Speaker 1: Now that we're done with Rims roller coaster fanboy talk.

427
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:06,742
Speaker 1: Right?

428
00:26:06,762 --> 00:26:07,677
Speaker 1: So I discovered this...

429
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,340
Speaker 0: I thought you were going to say fetish for a second.

430
00:26:09,622 --> 00:26:10,479
Speaker 1: Sure, that same thing.

431
00:26:11,706 --> 00:26:14,700
Speaker 1: I discovered this documentary yesterday, like someone linked to it somewhere.

432
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:23,940
Speaker 1: And this is a documentary about something that I hadn't thought about in a long time, which is an old Ruby Spears cartoon that I only saw on Toonami.

433
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,980
Speaker 1: I didn't see it when it was like, you know, out originally because I was like zero years old, called Thunder the Barbarian.

434
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:36,920
Speaker 1: And the documentary is Lords of Light because Thunder used to always say Lords of Light during the show.

435
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you don't know, Thunder the Barbarian is this cartoon that looks super old, like, you know, Hanna-Barbera style.

436
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:43,745
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:44,694
Speaker 1: It's from the early 80s.

438
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:49,840
Speaker 1: But and the plots of Thunder episodes were not really that great.

439
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,388
Speaker 1: It was like, oh, it was a bad guy.

440
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:53,860
Speaker 1: We got to fight, you know, rescue people, whatever.

441
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,221
Speaker 1: Right.

442
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,323
Speaker 1: Just really standard stuff.

443
00:26:55,764 --> 00:27:04,220
Speaker 1: What was amazing about Thunder was that the setting of it was so ridiculous and so awesome and so ahead of its time.

444
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:04,523
Speaker 1: Right.

445
00:27:04,563 --> 00:27:06,460
Speaker 1: You basically had this swords and sorcery deal.

446
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:06,701
Speaker 1: Right.

447
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:07,583
Speaker 1: He's a barbarian.

448
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:09,649
Speaker 1: His companions are a monster.

449
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:13,260
Speaker 1: that's a lot like a wookie and a magical wizard girl.

450
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:13,621
Speaker 1: Right.

451
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:14,722
Speaker 1: It's sort of like that.

452
00:27:15,103 --> 00:27:25,320
Speaker 1: And, you know, but what happened is the earth, this giant meteor comet or asteroid or something, went in between the earth and the moon like an enormous one.

453
00:27:25,962 --> 00:27:26,285
Speaker 0: Look at that.

454
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,780
Speaker 0: That's New York getting volcanoes.

455
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,933
Speaker 1: The moon broke in half and the earth like had all like.

456
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:34,220
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, atmosphere sucked away.

457
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:35,228
Speaker 1: Like it was like the end.

458
00:27:35,268 --> 00:27:36,578
Speaker 1: It was like super apocalypse.

459
00:27:36,658 --> 00:27:36,800
Speaker 1: Right.

460
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:41,320
Speaker 1: And now the sword and sorcery wizards and monsters everywhere.

461
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:46,238
Speaker 1: But also there's the old destroyed remnants of the 20th century.

462
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:52,040
Speaker 1: But also there's all kinds of crazy sci fi space shit all together in this one place.

463
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:00,760
Speaker 1: And it's like it was actually like, you know, that aspect of it, all the characters and the designs and the backgrounds and all this stuff like they went all out.

464
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,041
Speaker 1: Right.

465
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:09,860
Speaker 1: And like I didn't realize that huge names like Jack Kirby and Alex Toth and people like worked on like designing stuff for this show, even though.

466
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:10,562
Speaker 1: Right.

467
00:28:10,642 --> 00:28:12,429
Speaker 1: It's just it doesn't look that great.

468
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,340
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, I guess it looked better than some of the other shows at the time.

469
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:20,200
Speaker 0: I mean, look at shows contemporary to the show and they're all animated about the same level.

470
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:20,862
Speaker 1: Yeah.

471
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:23,572
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, this show is really something special.

472
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,780
Speaker 1: In fact, it was ridiculously popular as well.

473
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,883
Speaker 1: People don't realize that.

474
00:28:26,923 --> 00:28:31,960
Speaker 1: But it was cut to two seasons, mostly because, you know, I guess it was kind of violent.

475
00:28:32,081 --> 00:28:32,241
Speaker 1: Right.

476
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:36,040
Speaker 1: It was a Saturday morning cartoon, but it was a little bit too much for the kids.

477
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,124
Speaker 1: These barbarians.

478
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,855
Speaker 1: So this show is really awesome.

479
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,740
Speaker 1: This is documentary where the interview, all the people related to the show that were still alive when they made the documentary.

480
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,025
Speaker 1: It's only a 20 minute deal.

481
00:28:48,085 --> 00:28:48,266
Speaker 1: Right.

482
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:51,660
Speaker 1: And you learn all this stuff about, you know, what the deals of the show.

483
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,580
Speaker 1: But really, they don't actually talk about Thunder itself that much because there isn't that much to say about a two season show with only a handful of episodes.

484
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:12,720
Speaker 1: But they talk about, like, you know, the state of animation at the time and the way things were and all this other techniques and decisions that they made in the studio and all this stuff, some of which I've told you just now.

485
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:18,780
Speaker 1: And that stuff is really fascinating and why this is worth 20 minutes of your time.

486
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:28,600
Speaker 1: And also, if you're into that, I recommend watching at least one or two episodes of Thunder or the Barbarian because it's actually like it's some really awesome stuff there.

487
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,229
Speaker 0: It's about as worth watching as I saw just clicking through this video.

488
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,100
Speaker 0: Someone like rebuilt a battleship out of wood and was sailing it somewhere.

489
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:36,862
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

490
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,365
Speaker 1: It's like it's about as worthwhile.

491
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:39,167
Speaker 1: It's it's not.

492
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:41,693
Speaker 1: it's almost as worth watching as Fist of the North Star.

493
00:29:41,754 --> 00:29:42,596
Speaker 1: I'd say almost.

494
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:44,039
Speaker 0: That's high praise.

495
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:44,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

496
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,530
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you should probably watch Giant Robo first.

497
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:50,340
Speaker 1: It Thunder the Barbarian is not as good.

498
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:57,950
Speaker 0: So in the moment, the Book Club book is apparently still Dune.

499
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,334
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

500
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:00,557
Speaker 1: OK.

501
00:30:00,978 --> 00:30:01,460
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

502
00:30:03,481 --> 00:30:06,268
Speaker 1: The Book Club book is The Fifth Season by N.K.

503
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:06,690
Speaker 1: Jemisin.

504
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,552
Speaker 1: And I started reading it.

505
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:08,655
Speaker 1: I'm already in like chapter three.

506
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:10,480
Speaker 0: I'll probably read it on my way to and from Pax.

507
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:10,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

508
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:17,180
Speaker 1: Ever since I decided to replace all of my playing of stupid phone games with reading, I'm reading a lot more.

509
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,910
Speaker 0: And now that I've completely finished literally everything I could read related to the Prince of Nothing universe.

510
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:24,172
Speaker 0: Now, I just got to wait.

511
00:30:24,232 --> 00:30:28,320
Speaker 0: I literally know everything that any human could know other than our Scott Packer himself.

512
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:32,468
Speaker 0: So I saw stuff and I know now I'm going to read this book.

513
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,280
Speaker 1: Otherwise, so far this book living up to the hype already.

514
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:39,486
Speaker 0: There won't be any nice next week because we're going to be a Pax.

515
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,269
Speaker 1: Who knows about the week after.

516
00:30:41,289 --> 00:30:46,659
Speaker 0: there won't be any big nights the week after, because one, I don't get home from Pax till like Tuesday to Tuesday.

517
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,609
Speaker 0: On Thursday, I'm flying to Salt Lake City and I'll be back like Sunday.

518
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,233
Speaker 0: So two weeks, no geek nights.

519
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,720
Speaker 1: But keep an eye on my YouTube channel.

520
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,742
Speaker 1: I'm going to be making.

521
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,425
Speaker 1: first of all, I'm planning to.

522
00:30:57,566 --> 00:30:59,389
Speaker 1: I'm promising it now so I don't mess it up.

523
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:00,151
Speaker 1: Right.

524
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,253
Speaker 1: Rims got to cooperate.

525
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:01,493
Speaker 1: Right.

526
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:04,780
Speaker 1: We got to do live stream from Pax with my phone every day.

527
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,181
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

528
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:06,022
Speaker 1: At least one time.

529
00:31:06,203 --> 00:31:06,703
Speaker 0: I'm into that.

530
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,308
Speaker 1: And then I'm going to bring my camera to Pax.

531
00:31:09,348 --> 00:31:11,572
Speaker 1: But not only am I recording whatever panel we do.

532
00:31:12,033 --> 00:31:12,274
Speaker 1: Right.

533
00:31:12,915 --> 00:31:15,780
Speaker 1: I'm going to be making video of like everything all the time.

534
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:21,953
Speaker 1: And then hopefully at the end of every day in the hotel room on my iPad, I'm going to try to upload a video.

535
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:24,880
Speaker 1: Even we're even talking starting Thursday before Pax.

536
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,923
Speaker 0: I tried to do that once.

537
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:29,485
Speaker 0: I stopped caring like immediately.

538
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,466
Speaker 1: I think I can do it.

539
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:31,527
Speaker 1: I'm going to see if I can do it.

540
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:37,715
Speaker 1: I've been like at other conventions, like at Kineticon, I did a bunch of videos like practice, but like I didn't upload any of that.

541
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:40,198
Speaker 0: Remember in the old days, remember like every time?

542
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:40,979
Speaker 1: I practiced enough.

543
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:41,680
Speaker 1: Now we can do this.

544
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,108
Speaker 0: I used to make those like what it's like at Pax videos.

545
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:50,580
Speaker 0: And I think Pax West 2012 was the last time I made one of those.

546
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,762
Speaker 1: No, we're not going to do it like that.

547
00:31:52,163 --> 00:31:54,869
Speaker 1: But I want people to see like the itinerary.

548
00:31:54,929 --> 00:31:55,129
Speaker 1: Right.

549
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:00,300
Speaker 1: Of like, you know, how we you know, what goes on in a day in a full day of Pax.

550
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:06,428
Speaker 1: Not like here is the expo hall, but like, you know, this is our day at Pax, right?

551
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:09,111
Speaker 1: Oh, we went to the Pike place and got this Chinese food.

552
00:32:09,672 --> 00:32:13,477
Speaker 1: Oh, and then we went to here, you know, we went to the tabletop and we stay here.

553
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:15,940
Speaker 1: We played this game and this game and this game and this game.

554
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:17,122
Speaker 0: Yep.

555
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,785
Speaker 0: We successfully.

556
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:26,780
Speaker 0: we successfully avoided ordering pizza because I've warned many people if at any point I say, hey, why don't we just order pizza and have it delivered to tabletop?

557
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,651
Speaker 0: You have to slap me and remind me that every time we've done that, the pizza has been in edible garbage.

558
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:31,992
Speaker 1: All right.

559
00:32:32,012 --> 00:32:35,260
Speaker 1: So you need to follow all our YouTube channels and whatnot.

560
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:43,334
Speaker 1: You need to keep an eye on also, you know, whichever you prefer, Twitch, YouTube for I'm going to be streaming stuff even when it's not Pax.

561
00:32:43,374 --> 00:32:46,640
Speaker 1: If RIM is not going to be here, I'll be playing games and planning to play West of Loathing.

562
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,303
Speaker 1: That's the game I got on my queue.

563
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:48,924
Speaker 1: Right.

564
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:49,745
Speaker 1: Because I'm way into that.

565
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:51,288
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try to live stream.

566
00:32:51,348 --> 00:32:53,312
Speaker 1: Ever since I saw it at Pax, I want to play it.

567
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:57,259
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll mount my phone on my mountain bike or on my chest and try to live stream myself mountain biking.

568
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:57,920
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

569
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,006
Speaker 1: What else should people come to our panel at Pax?

570
00:33:02,026 --> 00:33:05,032
Speaker 0: We're going to be on Sunday, September 3rd, six thirty p.m.

571
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:06,555
Speaker 0: in the Hippogriff Theater.

572
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:09,260
Speaker 0: It starts with an H, meaning it's in the Hyatt.

573
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:19,380
Speaker 0: We're talking about the rage of the quitter, not the generic quitting panel we did before, but specifically the people who quit a game in a fit of butthurt rage.

574
00:33:19,741 --> 00:33:21,908
Speaker 0: How, why and what that means.

575
00:33:22,008 --> 00:33:25,660
Speaker 1: And lastly, you should come to our forum, which is on our website for recruit.com.

576
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,185
Speaker 1: Make sure when you apply, you write like a reason in the reason field.

577
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:31,228
Speaker 1: that implies that you're actually a listener.

578
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:39,020
Speaker 1: So I don't reject you and all the other social media places, Twitter, Facebooks, wherever it is that you know that you do.

579
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:39,921
Speaker 1: Right.

580
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:40,783
Speaker 1: Even Instagram.

581
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:43,269
Speaker 1: I'll start using the geek nights Instagram also at Pax.

582
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,111
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

583
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:44,612
Speaker 1: Take that.

584
00:33:44,692 --> 00:33:47,940
Speaker 1: So I'll probably cross post to Twitter, though, or maybe even Facebook as well.

585
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:56,836
Speaker 1: But anyway, when you go to those places, make sure to communicate with us and tell us, do you think it's a good idea for us to set up some stream of all geek?

586
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,160
Speaker 1: that's episodes is one long, never ending 50.

587
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,807
Speaker 0: And don't just say yes.

588
00:34:01,068 --> 00:34:04,040
Speaker 0: Don't just say yes, because, you know, that'll be a pain in the ass for us to set it up.

589
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:10,768
Speaker 1: Only say yes, if you would actually go to it and like use it like you would tune into it.

590
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:17,679
Speaker 1: If you would view yourself would tune into that more than once just to see that it was a working thing, then say yes.

591
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:18,380
Speaker 1: Otherwise say no.

592
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,565
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid, I watched the hell out of DuckTales.

593
00:34:21,786 --> 00:34:22,065
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

594
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:25,393
Speaker 0: Like Disney Afternoon was some of my favorite cartoons.

595
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:26,154
Speaker 1: So it's weird.

596
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:29,340
Speaker 0: It's like because when I was and I already was watching anime by that.

597
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,099
Speaker 1: I know this is one of those things where it's like, you know, when I was a kid, you know, you get home and you watch certain things.

598
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,320
Speaker 1: Right.

599
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,702
Speaker 1: And there are certain things where it's like.

600
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:39,007
Speaker 1: if someone asked you, like, what are you a fan of?

601
00:34:39,206 --> 00:34:41,670
Speaker 1: I would say something like Thundercats or Voltron.

602
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:41,871
Speaker 1: Right.

603
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:42,012
Speaker 1: Like.

604
00:34:42,032 --> 00:34:46,400
Speaker 1: I wouldn't think like, oh, I'm a fan of like, you know, Goof Troop or whatever.

605
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:46,639
Speaker 1: Right.

606
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,929
Speaker 1: But it's like I. I watch Goof Troop every fucking day.

607
00:34:49,951 --> 00:34:50,452
Speaker 1: Yeah.

608
00:34:50,553 --> 00:34:52,699
Speaker 0: I watch DuckTales like every time it was on TV.

609
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,025
Speaker 1: I watch DuckTales, Tailspin every fucking day.

610
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,007
Speaker 1: I watch that shit.

611
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:57,548
Speaker 1: Right.

612
00:34:57,768 --> 00:35:00,072
Speaker 1: But I wouldn't think of like being a fan of it.

613
00:35:00,112 --> 00:35:04,720
Speaker 1: It wasn't something that I remembered or something I would set as my desktop wallpaper when I had a computer.

614
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,862
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it was gone.

615
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:06,283
Speaker 1: It was gone.

616
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:13,800
Speaker 1: And people don't know this, but even though I've told it before, but basically what happened was is the Disney Animation team.

617
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,681
Speaker 1: There was something.

618
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:18,086
Speaker 1: the executives there had the initiative to create original content.

619
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:18,366
Speaker 1: Right.

620
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:20,650
Speaker 1: And this is where the Disney afternoon came from.

621
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,933
Speaker 1: It was syndicated to all your local TV networks.

622
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:28,040
Speaker 1: is those executives were pushing things like, you know, DuckTales, Goof Troop, et cetera, et cetera.

623
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,868
Speaker 1: And as why did those things as great and amazing as they were, Chippendales, Rescue Rangers, et cetera, why did they end?

624
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:43,820
Speaker 1: Because the executives who pushed that got kicked out and the new executives couldn't just carry on the successful projects of the previous executives.

625
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,842
Speaker 1: They had to do their own thing.

626
00:35:46,263 --> 00:35:46,483
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:54,512
Speaker 1: So this was around like, I guess, me, you know, sometime, I guess, mid to late nineties, I'm going to guess where they got.

628
00:35:54,532 --> 00:36:01,140
Speaker 1: they pushed out those old shows and they put in basically shows based on, you know, the movies.

629
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,925
Speaker 1: So they had like Aladdin, the TV show and Timon and Pumbaa, the TV show.

630
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:05,766
Speaker 1: Yeah.

631
00:36:05,786 --> 00:36:07,288
Speaker 1: And those were not way.

632
00:36:07,308 --> 00:36:12,595
Speaker 1: No, those are bad shows compared to Disney afternoon, which was amazing and incredible.

633
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:16,060
Speaker 1: So DuckTales went away at some point because of this.

634
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:31,700
Speaker 1: And now many, many, many, many years later, like 20 plus years later, probably at least DuckTales is back by the same Disney XD kind of animation team that was doing like Gravity Falls stuff before.

635
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,045
Speaker 0: Now, what's really important is they have an all star cast of voice actors.

636
00:36:35,446 --> 00:36:40,114
Speaker 0: It's like a who's who of storyboarders, writers, DuckTales.

637
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:40,394
Speaker 1: Right.

638
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:44,080
Speaker 1: Anyone you know, it's like 20 years is enough for people to become an adult.

639
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,111
Speaker 1: So those people who are top voice actors now were DuckTales watchers.

640
00:36:48,532 --> 00:36:51,320
Speaker 1: So if you say, hey, you want to work on DuckTales, they're lining up to audition.

641
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:51,580
Speaker 0: Yep.

642
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,608
Speaker 0: Now I pirated basically all of the original DuckTales to watch a little bit to just be ready to compare.

643
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:04,740
Speaker 0: And one thing I realized immediately is that despite the fact that I watched Hella DuckTales as a kid, I have not seen all of DuckTales by far.

644
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,525
Speaker 1: There's a lot of episodes of old DuckTales.

645
00:37:06,565 --> 00:37:07,127
Speaker 1: How many are there?

646
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:08,090
Speaker 1: What does the Internet say?

647
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:08,772
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

648
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:09,915
Speaker 0: I didn't have that Wikipedia up.

649
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:11,340
Speaker 1: But like there's a lot.

650
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,422
Speaker 0: DuckTales.

651
00:37:14,723 --> 00:37:17,649
Speaker 0: That song's pretty much been stuck in my head since I was a kid.

652
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:18,391
Speaker 0: A hundred.

653
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:19,052
Speaker 1: A hundred.

654
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,680
Speaker 0: So there's half a Sailor Moon's worth of old DuckTales.

655
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,721
Speaker 1: I've watched all of this.

656
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,322
Speaker 1: The North Star.

657
00:37:24,422 --> 00:37:26,526
Speaker 1: I could watch all of DuckTales if I wanted to.

658
00:37:26,546 --> 00:37:27,247
Speaker 0: I have all of it.

659
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:29,571
Speaker 0: And the new DuckTales like.

660
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:30,713
Speaker 0: we'll talk about it in depth.

661
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:34,980
Speaker 0: But if you need the TLDR version, it seems like it's great.

662
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:35,381
Speaker 1: Right.

663
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:41,571
Speaker 1: So there's basically on YouTube for free, legally, there is the full first episode, which is more than an episode.

664
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:42,974
Speaker 1: It's like an intro movie deal.

665
00:37:43,014 --> 00:37:44,737
Speaker 0: It's a two parter, basically.

666
00:37:44,777 --> 00:37:46,660
Speaker 1: How long is like 40 minutes to an hour?

667
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,303
Speaker 0: It's like two episodes with a like a cut in the middle.

668
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:50,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of long.

669
00:37:50,946 --> 00:37:52,247
Speaker 0: And that's very pointedly.

670
00:37:52,288 --> 00:37:55,832
Speaker 1: But to watch more, I think you're going to need Disney XD or Pirate Bay.

671
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:56,453
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:57,094
Speaker 0: Yeah.

673
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:01,220
Speaker 1: Or I think Disney left Netflix and is making their own streaming service.

674
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,381
Speaker 0: That's going to be my news.

675
00:38:02,461 --> 00:38:03,683
Speaker 0: like the next Wednesday show.

676
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:08,989
Speaker 1: There's probably going to be the legal place to watch your DuckTales when it happens anyway.

677
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:18,139
Speaker 1: So the new DuckTales show is different from the old DuckTales and in some ways better and in some ways arguably not better.

678
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,520
Speaker 1: Who knows?

679
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,842
Speaker 0: I don't think.

680
00:38:19,962 --> 00:38:25,369
Speaker 1: I think if you're if you're a person who enjoys a duck, you should probably watch it regardless.

681
00:38:25,549 --> 00:38:27,492
Speaker 0: So here's there's the notable differences offhand.

682
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30,616
Speaker 0: It appears to be cleaving closer to the comics.

683
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,400
Speaker 1: It is cleaving much, much closer to the comics.

684
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,181
Speaker 1: The you know, the.

685
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:40,807
Speaker 1: the true duck is the cannon duck stuff comes from Carl Barks.

686
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:42,769
Speaker 1: If it's not Carl Barks, it's not canon.

687
00:38:42,829 --> 00:38:45,511
Speaker 1: But Don Rosa is basically canon.

688
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,433
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll I'll say it's it's.

689
00:38:47,613 --> 00:38:48,374
Speaker 1: it's canon for me.

690
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:48,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:54,280
Speaker 1: Because Don Rosa stays so close to Barks in fact, he calls them right on purpose.

692
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,242
Speaker 1: So that's like someone intentionally trying to honor the canon.

693
00:38:57,903 --> 00:39:04,107
Speaker 1: Anything outside of that, including original DuckTales, any kind of weird Disney movies, Donald Duck and Magic Land, all this.

694
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,569
Speaker 1: That's all non canon nonsense bullshit.

695
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:06,749
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:11,672
Speaker 1: Carl Barks comics and Don Rosa comics is canon duck stuff.

697
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:22,780
Speaker 1: And this DuckTales actually seems to try to some extent to pull from the Barks in facts, whereas the old DuckTales didn't seem to really give much shits about it at all.

698
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,065
Speaker 0: It would like spiritually draw from them, but just go off on its own all the time.

699
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:27,486
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

700
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:28,567
Speaker 1: It really had not much.

701
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:38,500
Speaker 0: And this also shows in the art style because the backgrounds are more comic book and the opening theme is nothing but comic book backgrounds.

702
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:38,900
Speaker 0: Yes.

703
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:45,805
Speaker 1: You can see there are scenes like you can frames you can pull from this that you can then go to the comic and see the exact with the character.

704
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,647
Speaker 0: styles are a much like modern stylized take that it looks a lot like.

705
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:50,048
Speaker 1: What's that?

706
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,589
Speaker 1: There's like a newer Mickey Mouse show that's on Disney.

707
00:39:52,669 --> 00:39:53,190
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

708
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,051
Speaker 1: It looks a little bit more like that.

709
00:39:55,131 --> 00:39:57,192
Speaker 1: But it's not 100 percent like that.

710
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:59,334
Speaker 1: But it's it's it's like towards that.

711
00:39:59,374 --> 00:40:02,516
Speaker 0: So it's got more lines and it's a little less abstract than that style.

712
00:40:02,576 --> 00:40:02,896
Speaker 0: Yes.

713
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:03,237
Speaker 1: Yes.

714
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,298
Speaker 1: It's somewhere in between old DuckTales and that.

715
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:08,260
Speaker 0: I think it's great, though, because this leads into the third big difference.

716
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,302
Speaker 0: Huey, Dewey and Louie are different characters now.

717
00:40:12,522 --> 00:40:12,823
Speaker 1: Yes.

718
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:20,909
Speaker 1: As far as a kid, I literally and this mostly seemed to focus on Dewey in these two episodes more than the other two.

719
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:21,749
Speaker 0: Well, he's the evil one.

720
00:40:22,029 --> 00:40:22,390
Speaker 1: Sure.

721
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:24,431
Speaker 0: I think that's just Louie.

722
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,312
Speaker 0: I already I lost.

723
00:40:25,372 --> 00:40:28,394
Speaker 1: it felt to me like Dewey got more focused than the other two.

724
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:28,874
Speaker 1: Yeah.

725
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:32,977
Speaker 1: As if maybe he was more of a main character or maybe this was just his focus episode.

726
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,560
Speaker 0: But in the original one, all the young dogs were basically just together.

727
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,242
Speaker 0: One character like Ice Climbers and Smash Brothers.

728
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:39,682
Speaker 0: Exactly.

729
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:42,604
Speaker 1: And they didn't even know which one was which in the old DuckTales.

730
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:42,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:40:42,864 --> 00:40:47,447
Speaker 0: But the new DuckTales clearly and they didn't like dive into it like this one's like this.

732
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:48,128
Speaker 0: This one's like this.

733
00:40:48,168 --> 00:40:51,510
Speaker 0: They just they act differently and they have different personalities, different voices.

734
00:40:52,571 --> 00:40:57,514
Speaker 0: And I feel like the girl duck is going to serve a similar girl.

735
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:58,295
Speaker 1: What's her name?

736
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,015
Speaker 0: I already forgot.

737
00:40:59,636 --> 00:40:59,956
Speaker 1: Me, too.

738
00:41:00,116 --> 00:41:02,137
Speaker 0: I don't remember most of the people's names at this show.

739
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:03,398
Speaker 0: There's Launchpad.

740
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:06,020
Speaker 1: I only remember their names if they were in the old DuckTales.

741
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,924
Speaker 0: I remember Glomgold from the old DuckTales.

742
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:10,426
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Glomgold.

743
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:10,646
Speaker 1: Right.

744
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,729
Speaker 1: So people don't know this in the original comics.

745
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,293
Speaker 1: Glomgold is a bower from South Africa.

746
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 1: They changed it in DuckTales to make him also Scottish like Scrooge McDuck.

747
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, because apartheid.

748
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,947
Speaker 1: And they don't want to have to whatever in the new DuckTales.

749
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:28,651
Speaker 1: They had the opportunity to make him South African again.

750
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,754
Speaker 1: And they've clearly put some effort.

751
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:35,460
Speaker 1: The people who are making the new DuckTales clearly have read Karl Barks comics and are trying to pay respect.

752
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,541
Speaker 0: Webby, that's her name.

753
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:36,882
Speaker 1: Right.

754
00:41:37,102 --> 00:41:46,754
Speaker 1: But they still left Glomgold, Flintheart Glomgold as a Scottish duck and not as a South African duck when they had the opportunity to change it back.

755
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:52,060
Speaker 1: And that's slightly bullshit, but not the biggest deal, but also just kind of annoying.

756
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time.

757
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:56,507
Speaker 1: Also, most people won't notice, but I fucking notice.

758
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:57,849
Speaker 0: I don't care that much.

759
00:41:57,909 --> 00:42:01,234
Speaker 1: Also, it's probably better as someone with a shelf full of duck comics.

760
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:02,195
Speaker 1: I noticed.

761
00:42:02,396 --> 00:42:02,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

762
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:05,300
Speaker 1: Most people don't even have one duck comic, let alone a shelf.

763
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,729
Speaker 0: One, it lets them just forget about the problems of South African bars.

764
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,400
Speaker 0: And two, it lets them be a little more loose in like what time this is actually set in.

765
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,704
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it's definitely set in like way more like the current 21st century.

766
00:42:19,724 --> 00:42:20,645
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:21,786
Speaker 1: Which is like, okay.

768
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,948
Speaker 0: His character would make less sense today.

769
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:26,331
Speaker 1: I mean, if you talk about like, it's weird, right?

770
00:42:26,371 --> 00:42:31,897
Speaker 1: It's like, because the story of Scrooge, like he made all his money in the Yukon, like competing with Flintheart.

771
00:42:31,937 --> 00:42:35,140
Speaker 1: Well, it's like, oh, well, if he was in the Yukon, then he'd be dead.

772
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:36,621
Speaker 0: Yeah.

773
00:42:37,581 --> 00:42:44,727
Speaker 0: But also the, the fact that he's the second richest duck in the world and he's also the second richest Scottish duck in the world.

774
00:42:44,747 --> 00:42:50,271
Speaker 0: It kind of sets up a better, like current rivalry without needing backstory to be explained.

775
00:42:50,591 --> 00:42:50,771
Speaker 0: Yeah.

776
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:52,372
Speaker 0: Like it's, it's pretty self evident.

777
00:42:52,392 --> 00:42:54,934
Speaker 0: And also he's, he's a good mix.

778
00:42:55,094 --> 00:43:02,820
Speaker 0: the way they've portrayed him here as evil and as incompetent and sometimes competent as he was in the original DuckTales cartoon.

779
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:03,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

780
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:10,045
Speaker 1: I mean, in DuckTales, you know, the villains were a lot more, you know, wacky and, and sort of like insane, no bad guys.

781
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:15,208
Speaker 1: Flintheart Glomgold isn't really kind of like, you know, he's not like maniacal right in the comics.

782
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:15,609
Speaker 0: Yeah.

783
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:19,111
Speaker 0: And in the show he's more just like kind of evil and really hate Scrooge.

784
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:19,511
Speaker 1: Yeah.

785
00:43:20,672 --> 00:43:21,433
Speaker 0: He's murderous though.

786
00:43:21,493 --> 00:43:22,213
Speaker 0: He's willing to kill.

787
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,194
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure.

788
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:23,514
Speaker 1: Right.

789
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:23,894
Speaker 1: Whatever.

790
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:26,216
Speaker 1: Um, yeah.

791
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,577
Speaker 1: What else is there to say about this?

792
00:43:27,757 --> 00:43:29,258
Speaker 0: It's very, very important.

793
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:32,340
Speaker 0: I think that that's not all that, that they got the original theme song.

794
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,183
Speaker 0: And re-performed it because that really sets the continuity.

795
00:43:36,203 --> 00:43:40,305
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing where if they hadn't used a different song, no one would have let that go.

796
00:43:40,605 --> 00:43:46,149
Speaker 1: They also sort of redo the sort of, um, you know, like origin story.

797
00:43:46,169 --> 00:43:46,790
Speaker 0: It's tighter.

798
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:49,311
Speaker 0: They, they immediately like, here's the characters set it up.

799
00:43:49,511 --> 00:43:49,832
Speaker 1: Go.

800
00:43:49,892 --> 00:43:53,594
Speaker 1: It's not an origin story of any of the characters individually.

801
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:56,656
Speaker 0: It's the origin story of Scrooge resuming his biz.

802
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:56,776
Speaker 0: Right.

803
00:43:56,816 --> 00:43:58,678
Speaker 1: It's the origin story of DuckTales.

804
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:05,002
Speaker 1: Like, okay, well how did they end up in this situation where all the nephews are always hanging out with Scrooge going on adventures?

805
00:44:05,362 --> 00:44:05,602
Speaker 1: Right.

806
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:07,223
Speaker 1: It wasn't always that way.

807
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,064
Speaker 1: The nephews were living with Donald before.

808
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:10,565
Speaker 1: And it's very artfully done.

809
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:19,471
Speaker 0: how when you watch the, the like pilot episodes, they don't play the opening theme until the halfway point when DuckTales properly begins.

810
00:44:19,952 --> 00:44:26,476
Speaker 0: The first episode is like the prequel and then the first episode is like episode zero and one and you get the song halfway through.

811
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:33,621
Speaker 0: And I got to say, when the song came in, it gave me that tiny little nostalgia chill that I so rarely get from a good reboot.

812
00:44:33,801 --> 00:44:35,582
Speaker 1: That's what the point of this is.

813
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:36,343
Speaker 1: That's the nostalgia.

814
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:36,903
Speaker 1: No one's making.

815
00:44:36,983 --> 00:44:46,590
Speaker 0: Also, another big difference instead of just Donald is away in the Navy, which I think was mostly done in the original because there was a point in the original where Donald was no longer was there again.

816
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,830
Speaker 0: Not, not, not much though.

817
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:59,358
Speaker 1: I definitely remember watching DuckTales episodes where Donald Duck was there and I don't really remember them ever explaining like why he wasn't there or why he came back or why he left or anything like that.

818
00:44:59,558 --> 00:45:00,739
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid, I did.

819
00:45:00,759 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 1: There were just some episodes where he was there and some episodes.

820
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,744
Speaker 0: As a kid, I didn't know where he was and I didn't even know he was in the show for a long time.

821
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:10,125
Speaker 0: And then there was like a throwaway, like something, something.

822
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:12,547
Speaker 0: He's in the Navy, like they had a letter from him or something.

823
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:13,908
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, I don't remember that.

824
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,109
Speaker 1: All I remember was him being there.

825
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,549
Speaker 1: He was in the Navy and not being there.

826
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:17,810
Speaker 0: He was like just in the Navy.

827
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,171
Speaker 1: Okay.

828
00:45:18,671 --> 00:45:32,280
Speaker 0: But I feel like the main reason they did that in DuckTales was because his voice does not work for any amount of exposition or significant dialogue and just getting rid of him.

829
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,623
Speaker 0: We've made it a lot easier in the new show.

830
00:45:35,084 --> 00:45:36,806
Speaker 0: They've toned him down, but not that much.

831
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:41,213
Speaker 1: There was, there was at least one point where I couldn't understand what the fuck he was saying, which I'm like, oh, they did a good job.

832
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:41,493
Speaker 0: Yeah.

833
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:43,376
Speaker 0: But now he's going to be in the show.

834
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:46,280
Speaker 0: And basically there's this one character who has a speech impediment.

835
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,480
Speaker 1: Right.

836
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:51,206
Speaker 1: The one thing though, I do want to say about the voice acting right is obviously all the voices are different.

837
00:45:51,226 --> 00:45:53,248
Speaker 1: It's not the original voice actors for anything.

838
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:53,509
Speaker 0: Yep.

839
00:45:53,669 --> 00:45:54,670
Speaker 0: Which I think is good.

840
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:55,391
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

841
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:56,913
Speaker 1: It's just, I got no problem with that.

842
00:45:57,053 --> 00:46:03,722
Speaker 1: But, and it's like, you know, at first because I'm used to the old voices, if you're not used to the old voices, it won't matter to you at all.

843
00:46:03,742 --> 00:46:04,102
Speaker 1: There are all.

844
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:05,044
Speaker 1: the voice acting is great.

845
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:05,444
Speaker 1: Right.

846
00:46:05,705 --> 00:46:16,540
Speaker 1: But if you're used to the old ones, the weird thing is that I was able to basically like as soon as any character talked for the first time, it felt off because my brain was not matching it up.

847
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:16,940
Speaker 1: Right.

848
00:46:17,201 --> 00:46:22,788
Speaker 1: But then the second time most of them talked like the second time any of the nephews talked, I completely forgot that it was.

849
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:29,276
Speaker 0: And in fact now, because I went back and watched an episode of the original DuckTales, those original voices, I cannot deal with them anymore.

850
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:31,880
Speaker 1: Except for the voice of Scrooge himself.

851
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,142
Speaker 1: I think it's fine.

852
00:46:33,262 --> 00:46:34,665
Speaker 1: I mean, no, there's nothing wrong with it.

853
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:40,396
Speaker 1: I'm just saying personally, I was able to get used to and completely forgot that all the other voices changed.

854
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:40,757
Speaker 0: True.

855
00:46:40,877 --> 00:46:42,120
Speaker 1: Except for the Scrooge voice.

856
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,668
Speaker 1: Every time Scrooge talked, even though there's nothing wrong with the voice acting itself, it's still.

857
00:46:47,808 --> 00:46:55,840
Speaker 1: I got that feeling like wrong voice alarm every single time he talked, because I guess it's different, more or different in such a way.

858
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:56,361
Speaker 1: I don't know.

859
00:46:56,621 --> 00:46:59,325
Speaker 1: But like listening to it, I'm like, there's nothing wrong with it.

860
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:01,027
Speaker 1: It's just this alarm.

861
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:05,353
Speaker 1: And my brain went off like wrong voice with that character design.

862
00:47:05,473 --> 00:47:08,136
Speaker 1: And it stopped going off for every other character.

863
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,900
Speaker 1: In fact, it never even went off once or stupid launch pad.

864
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,806
Speaker 1: But it went off for Scrooge every single time he talked.

865
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:19,414
Speaker 1: And I'm like, I please stop going off because I don't hate this voice acting.

866
00:47:19,535 --> 00:47:22,500
Speaker 1: But it just my brain was like, it's the wrong voice.

867
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:22,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

868
00:47:22,901 --> 00:47:25,167
Speaker 0: For some reason, I got a natural transition.

869
00:47:25,268 --> 00:47:26,451
Speaker 0: Scrooge just sounded fine.

870
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,775
Speaker 0: And then I watched the original.

871
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:28,858
Speaker 0: He also sounded fine.

872
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:29,580
Speaker 0: Just a little rougher.

873
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:42,400
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the writing is where it's really different because the dialogue in the old DuckTales from everyone other than the boys and Webb and the girl, like the young ducks were like fine.

874
00:47:42,961 --> 00:47:49,834
Speaker 0: But the kids pretty much only ever said, my, my, my uncle Donald adventure, but my, my uncle Donald.

875
00:47:49,894 --> 00:47:53,220
Speaker 0: And like the writing was that for those characters, actually not that great.

876
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,505
Speaker 0: The writing in this new show is fantastic.

877
00:47:57,565 --> 00:48:00,489
Speaker 0: The character interactions and dialogue and all this sort of subtle stuff.

878
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:08,780
Speaker 0: I guess the way I describe it is that the beats of the show are much denser and are much more to a modern sensibility and modern quality.

879
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,182
Speaker 0: There's more jokes.

880
00:48:10,383 --> 00:48:11,606
Speaker 0: There's more interactions.

881
00:48:11,826 --> 00:48:13,330
Speaker 0: There's more plot moving quicker.

882
00:48:13,571 --> 00:48:16,740
Speaker 0: There's less dialogue, exposition and more show.

883
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,543
Speaker 1: Nothing in the old DuckTales was very little.

884
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:20,764
Speaker 1: was character driven, right?

885
00:48:20,885 --> 00:48:23,047
Speaker 1: It was all plot driven, right?

886
00:48:23,428 --> 00:48:25,971
Speaker 1: Are they, they have to go and rescue the thing.

887
00:48:26,011 --> 00:48:27,332
Speaker 1: They have to get the treasure.

888
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:28,334
Speaker 1: Are they going to get it?

889
00:48:28,374 --> 00:48:33,720
Speaker 1: All the characters are just who they were and they didn't change or have internal struggles or anything.

890
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,704
Speaker 0: This one is clearly.

891
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:37,400
Speaker 0: every one of these characters is going to have their mini arcs.

892
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:47,580
Speaker 1: All of every character here you can see has some sort of, you know, thing to get over, you know, just like any other modern show has all the characters.

893
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,912
Speaker 0: Like why did Donald and Scrooge stop adventuring?

894
00:48:49,952 --> 00:48:50,616
Speaker 0: Like what happened?

895
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:51,300
Speaker 0: And who's that lady?

896
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,001
Speaker 1: Right.

897
00:48:52,041 --> 00:48:54,507
Speaker 1: Look at the gravity falls that this replaced, right?

898
00:48:54,587 --> 00:48:55,189
Speaker 1: Effectively.

899
00:48:55,209 --> 00:48:59,440
Speaker 1: It's on the same TV channel and some of the same people are working on it.

900
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,719
Speaker 0: And I feel like Webby is just going to be a toned down version of Mabel, which I'm fine with.

901
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:13,400
Speaker 1: I mean, Webby, first of all, right, is like super badass for some reason, which is totally, it's like, which is great because everyone else except Scrooge is not super badass.

902
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:13,961
Speaker 0: Yep.

903
00:49:14,042 --> 00:49:14,668
Speaker 0: Do he?

904
00:49:14,769 --> 00:49:15,073
Speaker 0: Do he?

905
00:49:15,234 --> 00:49:15,760
Speaker 0: He's not badass.

906
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,020
Speaker 1: All the nephews are super crappy.

907
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,819
Speaker 0: Donald, Donald's secretly badass.

908
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,730
Speaker 1: Donald is secretly badass.

909
00:49:22,911 --> 00:49:25,020
Speaker 1: Launchpad is accidentally badass.

910
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:25,762
Speaker 0: Yep.

911
00:49:26,104 --> 00:49:26,667
Speaker 0: Oh, the maid.

912
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,740
Speaker 0: The maid clearly is a spy or something.

913
00:49:29,382 --> 00:49:29,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

914
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:31,280
Speaker 1: He's not your secretary.

915
00:49:31,461 --> 00:49:31,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

916
00:49:32,162 --> 00:49:38,460
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, also this has less, at least for now, it has less characters than old DuckTales.

917
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:43,020
Speaker 0: I think that's just because the old DuckTales had few characters early on and they slowly introduced them all.

918
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,489
Speaker 1: They kept adding tons and tons of characters, right?

919
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:48,400
Speaker 1: So you'd get like, uh, Gyro Gearloose.

920
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:49,779
Speaker 0: I'm sure we'll get him.

921
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,140
Speaker 1: Some Gizmo Duck and you know, there could even be some Darkwing Duck, who even knows, right?

922
00:49:56,122 --> 00:49:56,967
Speaker 1: But none of that is here.

923
00:49:56,987 --> 00:49:59,340
Speaker 1: There wasn't even, you know, that's the only thing.

924
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:03,739
Speaker 1: There wasn't a single goddamn Beagle Boy in this whole fucking thing.

925
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,700
Speaker 0: Uh, they're in the trailer in the opening.

926
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,219
Speaker 1: I'm sure they're there and they're just not in episode one or two.

927
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:09,844
Speaker 0: Of course not.

928
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:11,700
Speaker 0: You're not going to have every villain in every episode.

929
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,140
Speaker 0: That's literally why the Marvel movies have a thing that bothers me.

930
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,324
Speaker 1: But the thing is Beagle Boy.

931
00:50:17,705 --> 00:50:21,980
Speaker 1: in, in DuckTales, the old DuckTales was the number one bad guy.

932
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:24,960
Speaker 1: The same way that like Mojo Jojo is the number one bad guy in Powerpuff Girls.

933
00:50:25,206 --> 00:50:25,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

934
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,759
Speaker 1: But in the comics, Flintheart is number one bad guy.

935
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,679
Speaker 1: And that is yet another indicator of how they're, you know, caring a lot about those old comics.

936
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:42,159
Speaker 1: Whereas if you were just remaking DuckTales and you only saw DuckTales, the TV series, and didn't read any comics, you would, Beagle Boys would be your first guys.

937
00:50:42,604 --> 00:50:42,892
Speaker 1: No.

938
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:43,097
Speaker 1: Yeah.

939
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:46,740
Speaker 0: I did like the villains that were hired by Glomgold.

940
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:54,242
Speaker 1: Like, I feel like they weren't just, you know, faceless, do nothing, you know, uh, henchmen, right?

941
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:56,380
Speaker 1: They were actually, they made them somewhat interesting.

942
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,240
Speaker 0: Which Gravity Falls, you know, had the same thing.

943
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,119
Speaker 0: Whenever they brought in a side character, like that time traveling guy, they always gave him a deal.

944
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:02,441
Speaker 0: Yeah.

945
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:04,660
Speaker 1: By giving them like that tiny deal to them.

946
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,419
Speaker 1: But you know that there's just that little bit that they had, you know, like someone was like a super knife-y person.

947
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:16,679
Speaker 1: It's like just giving them that little bit of story and character and uniqueness gives me the opportunity to bring them back.

948
00:51:17,462 --> 00:51:18,599
Speaker 1: The, if you ever need to.

949
00:51:19,021 --> 00:51:28,380
Speaker 0: The humor is also very dense and there's a lot of sort of like front of the screen jokes, but there's also a lot of subtle or back of the screen jokes.

950
00:51:28,982 --> 00:51:29,679
Speaker 0: There's just little things.

951
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:36,358
Speaker 0: I think my favorite little bit is when the boys figure out that Scrooge is their uncle or like related to them.

952
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:36,520
Speaker 0: Great.

953
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,040
Speaker 0: And they just, they jump around in the car and then there's the roll over the top of the car.

954
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,560
Speaker 1: Someone made a gif of that where they continue to just infinite loop over the top of the car.

955
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:51,920
Speaker 0: And there's so many just little subtle jokes and interactions.

956
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,099
Speaker 1: Like when he hits the gong and he's like, no, I won't release the thing unless you hit it through, you've already hit it.

957
00:51:58,222 --> 00:52:01,260
Speaker 0: I laughed out loud numerous times during this.

958
00:52:01,402 --> 00:52:01,978
Speaker 1: It's a funny show.

959
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:02,501
Speaker 0: Yeah.

960
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:06,060
Speaker 0: I feel like this is going to be one of my favorite current animated shows.

961
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,460
Speaker 0: Like bar none.

962
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:14,320
Speaker 1: I'm not going, I don't think, partially because the ways to get this, I probably need to pay for the Disney streaming or pirating.

963
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:18,320
Speaker 1: I see myself not watching every episode as it comes out.

964
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:22,680
Speaker 1: I see myself shotgunning it all later, waiting much like with gravity falls.

965
00:52:22,841 --> 00:52:26,200
Speaker 1: When the seasons ended, it became easy to download a full season.

966
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,460
Speaker 1: So like what I've, what I did with adventure time, this isn't going to be a thing where there's new episode every week forever.

967
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:32,780
Speaker 1: It's going to be a seasonal thing.

968
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,398
Speaker 1: I imagine.

969
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:33,878
Speaker 0: Yeah.

970
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:37,220
Speaker 0: But I think it'll be like, uh, they'll keep making seasons for a long time.

971
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,120
Speaker 1: Hope they keep making seasons for a long time.

972
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,699
Speaker 1: But the question is how many seasons will they make?

973
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:42,340
Speaker 1: Right.

974
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:42,829
Speaker 0: Yep.

975
00:52:43,302 --> 00:52:48,260
Speaker 1: Well, they aim for an ending or will they go for a hopefully, you know, continuous never ending.

976
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,640
Speaker 0: So they already, they already confirmed a second full season is paid for.

977
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,180
Speaker 1: I assume two definitely.

978
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:58,940
Speaker 1: I'm asking, is it going to be two or is it going to be 10 or 20?

979
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,636
Speaker 0: They said, they said something to the effect of each season that they do.

980
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:06,020
Speaker 0: will one, have an overarching plot.

981
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,659
Speaker 1: So they can end on any end of any season.

982
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,580
Speaker 0: But two will have many sub arcs within.

983
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,880
Speaker 0: So it can still be reasonably episodic.

984
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,560
Speaker 1: But so they're going to try to make it so that if any season ends, they'll have a good ending.

985
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:28,460
Speaker 0: Actually, they still, they implied from what I read that the goal there is more to, even if the episodes are all monster of the week, which they really want to keep that monster of the week for the most part.

986
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:35,640
Speaker 0: You have to be, they want to be able to in every monster of the week episode, push forward a meta plot of some kind.

987
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,119
Speaker 0: Or the sailor moon formula.

988
00:53:38,287 --> 00:53:38,456
Speaker 0: Yeah.

989
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:43,120
Speaker 0: Sailor moon is monster of the week, but tiny revelation almost every episode.

990
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:43,908
Speaker 1: Yeah.

991
00:53:46,102 --> 00:53:50,179
Speaker 0: But with adventure time and Steven universe, what I've been doing is just buying it on Amazon.

992
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:51,018
Speaker 1: Not buying.

993
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,039
Speaker 1: Well, how much does it cost?

994
00:53:52,641 --> 00:53:54,897
Speaker 0: Uh, it ends up being like 15 bucks a season.

995
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:55,219
Speaker 0: ish.

996
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,300
Speaker 1: How many seasons are there of Steven universe?

997
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:58,578
Speaker 0: Uh, six.

998
00:53:58,944 --> 00:53:59,879
Speaker 0: The way they break them down.

999
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,119
Speaker 0: Cause it's weird how they break them down.

1000
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,558
Speaker 1: 90 bucks.

1001
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,740
Speaker 0: I don't care the big, the big value.

1002
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,300
Speaker 1: Do they have like literally every episode on there?

1003
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:14,040
Speaker 1: So if I pay money on Amazon to buy, I can see even the newest, newest episodes.

1004
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,560
Speaker 0: So when an episode of Arizona TV, like for adventure time or Steven universe, it'll usually be on the Amazon season within like a couple of days.

1005
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,920
Speaker 1: So if I buy the current season, they keep adding the new episodes to it as they air.

1006
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,879
Speaker 1: And I don't have to keep paying.

1007
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:28,372
Speaker 1: Yes.

1008
00:54:29,262 --> 00:54:36,940
Speaker 1: So if I buy the newest season of, if, if, if Ducktales were on Amazon and I were to buy season one right now, I'd be able to watch this episode.

1009
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:43,380
Speaker 1: And as soon as episode two came out, like the next day it would be there and I would have already paid for it and thus be able to watch it.

1010
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,920
Speaker 0: That's how I've been watching adventure time and Steven universe.

1011
00:54:46,601 --> 00:54:51,438
Speaker 0: And because it's not a streaming service, the fact it's just there forever in the Amazon account.

1012
00:54:51,983 --> 00:54:53,779
Speaker 0: So I could watch it again or whatever.

1013
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,434
Speaker 1: And that, that actually is, can they take, they can't take it down because you bought it.

1014
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,180
Speaker 0: If they take it down, they got to give me my money back cause I paid for it.

1015
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:01,620
Speaker 0: That's right.

1016
00:55:01,701 --> 00:55:01,978
Speaker 1: Okay.

1017
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:02,480
Speaker 1: Interesting.

1018
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:02,960
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1019
00:55:03,041 --> 00:55:04,360
Speaker 0: So that's how I'm watching a lot of cartoons.

1020
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:10,659
Speaker 0: I hope they also just sell this on Amazon at some point, but I don't know if they will probably get even the new Disney thing.

1021
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,070
Speaker 1: Yep.

1022
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,680
Speaker 1: Disney pulled out of Netflix and they're setting up their own thing.

1023
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,925
Speaker 0: Disney's really on.

1024
00:55:15,427 --> 00:55:18,900
Speaker 1: what you're going to do is once a year for like a month or two and there's nothing else to watch.

1025
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:27,179
Speaker 1: Like in the summer, you're going to pay for the Disney stream and watch all your Disney for the year and then cancel it and then come back again.

1026
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:28,580
Speaker 1: Right.

1027
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:34,280
Speaker 1: For some more like, you know, like when the new Pixar movie that you didn't go see in the theater last year gets put up on that system.

1028
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,399
Speaker 1: You're going to pay for it.

1029
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:35,818
Speaker 1: Watch it.

1030
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:36,679
Speaker 1: Turn, you know what?

1031
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,138
Speaker 1: Turn it off.

1032
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:37,778
Speaker 1: Something like that.

1033
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:42,058
Speaker 0: So yeah, uh, we didn't obviously talk a lot about what happened in the episode.

1034
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:42,738
Speaker 0: cause just watch it.

1035
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,257
Speaker 0: It's free.

1036
00:55:44,005 --> 00:55:44,658
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

1037
00:55:45,021 --> 00:55:46,612
Speaker 0: And then you're probably gonna want to watch the rest of it.

1038
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:49,396
Speaker 0: cause the show, it looks like it's going to be really, really great.

1039
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,096
Speaker 1: Like it is, this is good.

1040
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,240
Speaker 1: This is taking over my gravity falls slot cause gravity falls ended.

1041
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:54,571
Speaker 1: Yep.

1042
00:55:55,041 --> 00:55:58,440
Speaker 0: I think based on that first episode too, I really like gravity falls.

1043
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:02,858
Speaker 0: I think both Steven universe and adventure time are much better shows than gravity falls was.

1044
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,447
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean adventure time.

1045
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:09,438
Speaker 1: probably, I haven't watched enough Steven universe, but I wouldn't argue.

1046
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,440
Speaker 0: Steven universe would be in my top 10 anime if I included it in anime.

1047
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,438
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

1048
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:17,160
Speaker 0: It's good.

1049
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,680
Speaker 0: You have not got, it's gotten subtle and good and there's good stuff in Steven universe.

1050
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:22,460
Speaker 0: You should watch it.

1051
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:41,138
Speaker 0: Sure there is, but I, you know, but adventure time ekes them all out partly because it's so long and so utterly experimental and varied yet still having a relatively contiguous and like self-consistent plot that is building up to a real conclusion as I'm watching the last season.

1052
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:49,080
Speaker 0: Like, you know, like the Lich stuff like is really like, it seems to be resolving why the Lich is a recurring villain in every time.

1053
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:56,020
Speaker 1: Adventure time is a in currently in hanging out with my web comics as soon as the last very, very extreme guaranteed.

1054
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,540
Speaker 1: This is the end of adventure.

1055
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,299
Speaker 1: Time is out.

1056
00:56:58,721 --> 00:57:02,340
Speaker 1: I'm going to go back to where I left off and go and go straight to the end.

1057
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,680
Speaker 0: When you do that, I might just watch it all again because it's from the beginning.

1058
00:57:06,045 --> 00:57:06,278
Speaker 1: Sure.

1059
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,759
Speaker 1: From episode one of it.

1060
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,334
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll skip season one.

1061
00:57:11,808 --> 00:57:12,178
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1062
00:57:12,481 --> 00:57:13,939
Speaker 0: I could start when the Lich appears.

1063
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,627
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, if you want to, if you want to start from season one, I could do that too.

1064
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,519
Speaker 1: We could do it together.

1065
00:57:20,621 --> 00:57:31,360
Speaker 0: But this DuckTales, I feel like will be definitely better than Gravity Falls and has the potential to be almost as good as the collected run of adventure time.

1066
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,838
Speaker 0: But I do not think this format could be better than adventure time.

1067
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,544
Speaker 1: Good

1068
00:57:36,564 --> 00:57:37,850
Speaker 0: goal because adventure time again,

1069
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:40,140
Speaker 1: I think it's got too much, you know, even though

1070
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:55,200
Speaker 0: it's got, it's got lanes that like boundaries that are set by the source material that can make it very good in a narrow realm, but it will not have the opportunity to be as ridiculously like fuckery enabled experimentalism of adventure time.

1071
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,680
Speaker 1: The Disney leash is going to prevent DuckTales from being as good as adventure time.

1072
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:03,596
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it looks like it's going to be like, it's going to be as good as it can be.

1073
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:06,720
Speaker 0: It is the best case scenario for a reboot of a Disney afternoon.

1074
00:58:07,081 --> 00:58:12,400
Speaker 0: And my hope against hope is that this means we get a tail spin at some point.

1075
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:19,419
Speaker 1: If you like the DuckTales, the new one or the old one, go read actual duck comics, the old ones.

1076
00:58:19,681 --> 00:58:21,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you want to get is you want?

1077
00:58:21,089 --> 00:58:22,919
Speaker 1: we've done an episode on this super long ago.

1078
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:23,562
Speaker 0: We did.

1079
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:27,740
Speaker 1: the life and times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa is your starting point.

1080
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:37,600
Speaker 1: And from there, if you are into it, you can read any duck comic, Scrooge or Donald or otherwise that is written by either Carl Barks or Don Rosa.

1081
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:38,865
Speaker 1: Those are your two names.

1082
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:43,019
Speaker 1: you're going to look for on the byline and read as much of that as you can get.

1083
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,999
Speaker 1: A lot of it is in print and available if you spend money.

1084
00:58:47,602 --> 00:58:47,877
Speaker 0: All right.

1085
