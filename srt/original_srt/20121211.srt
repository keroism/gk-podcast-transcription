1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,429
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday December 11th 2012 I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,838
Speaker 1: how to not suck at taking your fucking turn Jesus Christ Let's do this.

3
00:00:26,048 --> 00:00:26,789
Speaker 1: Is that a good pooping?

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,539
Speaker 1: About to do the show we literally I record the opener than Scott's like gotta poop and just gets up and walks out of the Studio, okay, like okay.

5
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,930
Speaker 1: That was the exact moment you had a bowel movement.

6
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,797
Speaker 1: Neither not too soon not too late, but right.

7
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:46,628
Speaker 1: then the moment I said it's December 11th 2012 I'm rim.

8
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:48,437
Speaker 1: You're like I got a poke cuz.

9
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:48,818
Speaker 0: I just.

10
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,750
Speaker 0: I just have some power to control exactly when this happens.

11
00:00:52,312 --> 00:00:54,379
Speaker 0: As I decide that is when the pooping move.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,029
Speaker 1: Ah, but if I have a bowel movement is often not that urgent.

13
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,923
Speaker 0: This wasn't heard, you know incredibly urgent like I was about to put it.

14
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:02,646
Speaker 0: poop everywhere.

15
00:01:02,947 --> 00:01:08,210
Speaker 0: that doesn't happen You know, but if I would have held that shit in I would have suffered through the the end of the show.

16
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:15,196
Speaker 1: It should not have been good Ah, but if the bowel movement would have been suffering then perhaps you should have dealt with it at an earlier bowel movement juncture in The day.

17
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:21,781
Speaker 1: that was the early the earliest implementer earliest manifestation of this.

18
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,608
Speaker 0: then perhaps I can't hold it for an hour.

19
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,862
Speaker 0: Hold you want to hold it in for an hour.

20
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:28,629
Speaker 0: That's not good for you.

21
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:31,804
Speaker 1: The first time I feel like hey got a poop is not the.

22
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,855
Speaker 1: if I hold it in for an hour I'm not gonna feel good.

23
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:36,288
Speaker 1: It's hey, you should poop at some time in the next 24 hours.

24
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:39,758
Speaker 0: You can help move in for 24 hours.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,284
Speaker 1: It's never that urgent.

26
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,030
Speaker 1: I poop exactly what I want.

27
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:44,856
Speaker 1: I poop on the mound.

28
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:45,338
Speaker 0: It's not.

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,686
Speaker 0: it's not healthy to hold in poop.

30
00:01:47,806 --> 00:01:48,649
Speaker 1: I don't have to hold it in.

31
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:53,970
Speaker 1: I have a feeling as I say rim From this point forward whenever you're ready, you can poop.

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,250
Speaker 1: However, if you wait more than like six or seven hours, I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna tell you it's a little urgent.

33
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:12,455
Speaker 1: I'm going to escalate the severity from a set of three to a set of two To shape your bowels are in Some sort of.

34
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:15,770
Speaker 0: you know Panama Canal locking system down there some shit.

35
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:20,831
Speaker 1: I just it's never urgent unless there's a problem and I poop once a day at like 845.

36
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:25,442
Speaker 0: it's not urgent, but you know like peeing it's like oh you feel poop in there.

37
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:28,950
Speaker 1: Suddenly suddenly, it's a slow rise.

38
00:02:29,432 --> 00:02:31,041
Speaker 0: No, it's pretty much as like no poop.

39
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:36,769
Speaker 0: Hey poops in there Then you go poop it out instead of holding waiting around.

40
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:40,134
Speaker 1: so anyway Gaming day.

41
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:40,917
Speaker 1: See you got any news.

Speaker 0: I do indeed have news.

00:02:42,765 --> 00:02:43,810
Speaker 0: This is the most amazing.

44
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:49,090
Speaker 1: No, you mean the thing you've been excited about and telling everyone about you're not as excited as Bruce is about key and peel.

45
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:52,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think anyone give you more excited about anything.

46
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:55,887
Speaker 0: No, but they usually.

47
00:02:55,907 --> 00:03:09,710
Speaker 0: you know It is very hard to excite me especially in a world where I have 10 million video games 10 million animes Like it's one Right, and there's all these things that are unwatched unread unlistened unseen.

48
00:03:10,432 --> 00:03:17,172
Speaker 0: Why would I be so excited about a new thing when I've already got so many awesome things that I have not experienced already piled up?

49
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,328
Speaker 0: is that thing would have to be pretty amazing to work its way so high up in the QE?

50
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:24,438
Speaker 0: we And that thing has happened.

51
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:26,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's the deal.

52
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:31,485
Speaker 0: some dude in Singapore Made a fan-made game, but he did a real damn good job.

53
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:54,498
Speaker 0: such a good job That Capcom, you know, the the owner of the IP rights to the fan-made game he was making helped him out gave him the hooks up and they have gone so far as to specifically endorse this game and Release it for free on their website a week from yesterday Which means next Monday December 17th.

54
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,268
Speaker 0: Wow a free PC download for everybody.

55
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:01,470
Speaker 0: there is at Capcom unity website.

56
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:08,403
Speaker 0: They're releasing the game known as Street Fighter cross Mega Man cross Street Fighter.

57
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:09,407
Speaker 0: I don't know which order it goes.

58
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:12,220
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter This game is not what you expect.

59
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:14,774
Speaker 0: like I was you know when I first heard the title I was like.

60
00:04:14,814 --> 00:04:16,146
Speaker 1: I thought it'd be like Marvel vs.

61
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,199
Speaker 0: Capcom Fighting game.

62
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:25,526
Speaker 0: they just had instead of Marvel characters Just way more Mega Man characters bringing in zero bringing in Mega Man X bringing in all kinds of people.

63
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:26,529
Speaker 0: right would man?

64
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,414
Speaker 0: and you Know everything.

65
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,988
Speaker 0: but that is not what it is.

66
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:39,688
Speaker 0: It's actually an old-school 2d Mega Man game where instead of robot masters you have Gal Blanca Ryu Chun Li etcetera etcetera.

67
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,769
Speaker 0: Dalzim oh my god.

68
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:49,730
Speaker 0: You see the trailer for this shit Which is what we're gonna link you to and maybe we'll link you to the website that it will eventually be available as a download.

69
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:56,532
Speaker 0: So I have a suspicion kills guile sonic boom when he kills ryu Hadouken.

70
00:04:56,974 --> 00:04:57,616
Speaker 0: oh my god.

71
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:59,161
Speaker 1: Do I get the thousand hand slap?

72
00:04:59,181 --> 00:04:59,843
Speaker 1: That's all I can.

73
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,641
Speaker 0: I don't know which the nine guys are So I don't you know.

74
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,689
Speaker 0: I don't know all the nine guys.

75
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:17,097
Speaker 1: I know one thing I can say I will guess that this game will be not actually Nintendo hard like Mega Man 9 was Some guy Fan-made game.

76
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:21,289
Speaker 1: I think it'll be hard, but there's a certain special level of Mega Man hard.

77
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:28,698
Speaker 0: well I'm actually thinking about as soon as I beat some of the games on my plate going to do a Mega Man ATHON Mega Man 1 2 3 9 10 and then X 1 2 3 whatever it is.

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,536
Speaker 0: I don't know how many X's there are.

79
00:05:32,556 --> 00:05:33,380
Speaker 1: I've only beaten.

80
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,676
Speaker 1: like Mega Man 2 3 4.

81
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:37,470
Speaker 1: I played a lot of them.

82
00:05:38,512 --> 00:05:40,120
Speaker 0: You gotta play Mega Man 5.

83
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,267
Speaker 0: Mega Man 5 is the shit.

84
00:05:41,769 --> 00:05:45,354
Speaker 1: I Rented Mega Man 5 from blockbuster a bunch of times But I never owned it.

85
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:49,190
Speaker 0: Mega Man 5 will play an emulator and beat Mega Man 5 because it's the proto man edition.

86
00:05:49,811 --> 00:06:00,010
Speaker 1: No, I guess Mega Man 3 was my was my jam Partly because I liked fucking around with that hold left on controller 2 and the game fucks up code.

87
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:05,117
Speaker 0: Okay, okay, Mega Man is the best.

88
00:06:05,763 --> 00:06:07,500
Speaker 1: You know I'm getting a vibe.

89
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,336
Speaker 1: This is gonna be like a step above the obobo game that came out a while ago.

90
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,440
Speaker 0: No you look at it.

91
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,807
Speaker 0: It looks like a real Mega Man game.

92
00:06:13,827 --> 00:06:14,510
Speaker 0: watch that trailer.

93
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,354
Speaker 0: Did you watch a trailer?

94
00:06:15,535 --> 00:06:15,856
Speaker 1: I did.

95
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,540
Speaker 1: it looks really good.

96
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:26,917
Speaker 1: The trailer of a Bobo's big adventure made it look equally good and the reality was it was pretty good But it was also way way easy.

97
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:32,917
Speaker 1: Well this has Capcom Hands on it true a Bobo had no one's hands, but a Bobo's.

98
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:33,459
Speaker 0: that's right.

99
00:06:35,424 --> 00:06:36,515
Speaker 1: I could play a Bobo again.

100
00:06:37,662 --> 00:06:37,802
Speaker 0: Me.

101
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,226
Speaker 1: yeah, did you ever beat it?

102
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:39,908
Speaker 1: No?

103
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:40,831
Speaker 1: No really?

104
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:41,733
Speaker 1: Why not?

105
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:42,375
Speaker 0: Yeah?

106
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,080
Speaker 1: What could you beat it?

107
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,026
Speaker 0: I didn't even try.

108
00:06:45,388 --> 00:06:47,100
Speaker 1: uh-huh wait a minute.

109
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:49,309
Speaker 1: It was really easy.

110
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:50,234
Speaker 1: How come you haven't beaten.

111
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,360
Speaker 1: It's like one playthrough.

112
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:54,180
Speaker 0: Why haven't I played any of the other hundreds team games?

113
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,987
Speaker 1: I haven't played because a Bobo takes less than an hour to beat Start to finish.

114
00:06:58,007 --> 00:06:59,820
Speaker 0: I got a lot of games take less than an hour to beat.

115
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,179
Speaker 1: I don't think you can and I think you're having trouble.

116
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:04,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, every day.

117
00:07:04,364 --> 00:07:07,518
Speaker 0: I've been going home trying to beat a Bobo for the past three years.

118
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:07,598
Speaker 0: why?

119
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,603
Speaker 0: So I can't.

120
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,811
Speaker 0: I meet you Bobo.

121
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:12,099
Speaker 0: That's what I've been doing all this time.

122
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:19,085
Speaker 1: We've learned that if we just shorted Nintendo's stock when the Wii U was about to come out we would have made a lot of money.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:29,625
Speaker 1: Nintendo has been not doing so well stock wise and I have no intention of buying a Wii U anytime in the next six months Next six million years.

124
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:29,966
Speaker 0: Well.

125
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:33,075
Speaker 1: There is a foreseeable what chance that I would buy one.

126
00:07:33,115 --> 00:07:37,011
Speaker 0: that would be I win the lottery if One they're a dollar.

127
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:40,445
Speaker 1: they made it also Interact with the 3ds.

128
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,114
Speaker 0: yeah to the 3ds you don't have.

129
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:44,840
Speaker 1: I could use four of those controllers.

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,042
Speaker 1: Three.

131
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:54,060
Speaker 1: they made a new four swords crystal chronicles pac-man verse advanced wars Any yeah, they had to make Mario Party Mario tennis.

132
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,285
Speaker 0: They would need more than one of those because just one of those You know all of those combined.

133
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:01,220
Speaker 1: if all of those things come then it would be worth the price.

134
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:04,857
Speaker 1: Then I will buy a Wii U, but if I needed another reason not by a Wii U.

135
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:12,980
Speaker 0: So luckily this only make a really big Bomberman where on your screen You see only the area around you and on the big screen you can see the whole thing.

136
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,805
Speaker 0: But it's such a gigantic Bomberman.

137
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:16,289
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

138
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,435
Speaker 1: the possibilities are endless, but you know what.

139
00:08:18,716 --> 00:08:25,838
Speaker 1: they were just as endless When the GBA connected to the Gamecube they were and when the DS should have but didn't connect to the Wii.

140
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:37,498
Speaker 0: the only thing the ideas ever connected to the Wii 4 is if you use the Nintendo store channel on Well the Nintendo channel on the Wii you could download demos of upcoming DS games to your DS over the air.

141
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:41,551
Speaker 0: that was only DS Wii connection that they've ever done.

142
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,440
Speaker 1: it also really took forever wasn't that good?

143
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:46,077
Speaker 1: Didn't really work that well?

144
00:08:46,198 --> 00:09:03,118
Speaker 1: no So if you needed another reason to really kind of not be happy with Nintendo the Wii U won't let you look at or Purchase anything in their interactive system that is rated 18 plus between the hours of 3 a.m.

145
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,979
Speaker 1: And 11 p.m.. If you are in Europe.

146
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:15,543
Speaker 1: Okay, really that is such an oddly specific Weird Regulation rule.

147
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:18,191
Speaker 0: I don't understand how could none of the other consoles do this.

148
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,618
Speaker 1: I also don't understand that now.

149
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,749
Speaker 1: it is true Europe has really fucked up.

150
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,639
Speaker 1: free speech law depends on the country as a whole.

151
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:31,543
Speaker 1: Europe on average has much less free speech than the US Depends on the country.

152
00:09:31,984 --> 00:09:40,920
Speaker 1: on average if you average all countries that are in what we consider Europe the average the the value of free Speech if you average them all together is lower than free speech in the US.

153
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:52,285
Speaker 1: I guess so also a lot of the individual countries like France has weird laws about What you can show on different kinds of TV at different times at the same time that you can see boobies on TV In certain times.

154
00:09:52,406 --> 00:10:02,459
Speaker 1: yeah, so in some ways is less than in some ways more Except at the same time a lot of the regulations in the US really only actually apply to broadcast TV Which effectively doesn't matter anymore?

155
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,380
Speaker 1: But and radio simultaneously and radio, but yet in podcast I can say fuck all I want like fuck fuck.

156
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,209
Speaker 1: And I'm showing movies right now.

157
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:12,360
Speaker 0: It's up boobies on the podcast.

158
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,057
Speaker 1: In fact I'm playing the Dave Zader game.

159
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:22,650
Speaker 0: Apparently this podcast even has scared What I was about to say.

160
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:26,646
Speaker 1: when did Dave Zader ever, and then I'd yeah You did.

161
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,219
Speaker 0: you were the one who brought scat on to this.

162
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 1: Well, I believe that you you were the the inseptor of that, and I simply brought it out.

163
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:35,455
Speaker 0: I didn't bring it out onto the show.

164
00:10:35,475 --> 00:10:36,920
Speaker 1: well Yeah, hope you brought it out.

165
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,110
Speaker 1: Otherwise you failed in your end and not onto the show.

166
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:52,698
Speaker 1: you want to put it on the show here, but in particular For example Germany has a lot of restrictive free speech laws and there appear to be a number of laws and rules in the EU Which remember as of you know a while ago the European Union.

167
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,019
Speaker 1: there are?

168
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,933
Speaker 1: European laws now yep, and there appear to be a lot of your.

169
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,639
Speaker 0: I don't know how much they're enforced like.

170
00:10:59,659 --> 00:10:59,859
Speaker 0: I don't.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
Speaker 0: I don't really get it.

172
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,756
Speaker 0: I haven't looked it up.

173
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,738
Speaker 0: They it seems like a lot of them are regulations on companies like this as opposed to laws that police would enforce.

174
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:13,079
Speaker 1: so This is ridiculous and one this is one of the reasons why?

175
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:28,069
Speaker 1: While I'm generally a very sort of left-wing slash radical techno progressivist type of person when it comes to politics I really don't want the UN the EU or basically anyone, but the United States to maintain the Basically complete control of the Internet.

176
00:11:28,109 --> 00:11:38,099
Speaker 1: because for all the things we've fucked up as a country The Internet is the one thing we have fucked up the least And relative to everyone else we're doing a pretty good job

177
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:38,829
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

178
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:46,880
Speaker 1: but - It bothers me that there's this movement in a like Australia and Europe and there is a movement for this in the u.s.

179
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,380
Speaker 1: To put restrictions on things to protect children that also affect adults.

180
00:11:53,463 --> 00:12:06,088
Speaker 1: I am fine with having any like computers like having operating system things where a User could lock things down for like a parent could lock things down for their children if they wish But the moment

181
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:06,813
Speaker 0: me

182
00:12:07,055 --> 00:12:12,174
Speaker 1: as an adult Has no ability to interact with that system and/or disable it.

183
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:13,297
Speaker 1: that is bullshit.

184
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,563
Speaker 1: There is zero Rationale.

185
00:12:15,623 --> 00:12:18,092
Speaker 0: yeah, it all should not be enabled by default.

186
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:24,191
Speaker 0: No, it's you something you have to turn on Right because it's like kids can't really buy things.

187
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:29,640
Speaker 0: So you don't have to worry about a kid buying a Wii and going he Because a kid can't buy things.

188
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, so why?

189
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:35,960
Speaker 0: so it should be disabled by the fault and then the adult who purchased it would enable it.

190
00:12:36,802 --> 00:12:42,720
Speaker 1: The kid immediately hacks it, but then the kid deserves it anyway, so fine, but the what this is so anachronistic.

191
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:45,300
Speaker 1: Did they really think whoever made this happen?

192
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,035
Speaker 1: Do you really think that if you can't buy these games between 11 p.m.

193
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:49,457
Speaker 1: And 3 a.m.

194
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:56,820
Speaker 1: That one kids aren't gonna buy them and the two no one's gonna have a problem with this that kids are asleep at those hours.

195
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:01,645
Speaker 0: Thing is well, I mean first of all, right It's like you've got.

196
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:16,060
Speaker 0: you know, if you look think of all the different categories of responsible parents responsible children Good bad everywhere in between on the gray scale, right kids who are more Responsible who are staying up late because their parents trust them and they're good kids.

197
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:23,180
Speaker 1: I'd sit down till till the Sun came up playing like sieve or right one or do not, you know They're gonna have access to these games.

198
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,345
Speaker 0: But it won't really matter.

199
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:25,589
Speaker 0: because just fine if they do.

200
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:31,375
Speaker 0: kids who are sort of in the middle Right, you know their parents make them go to bed.

201
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:32,360
Speaker 0: Maybe they're irresponsible.

202
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, the

203
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:48,920
Speaker 1: hardware controls don't matter because the good parent with the troublesome kid or the kid who can't you know Shouldn't the kid who's 15, but you know, some people just can't deal with games like this when they're 15 a good parent The kid will listen to him and won't do what they're not supposed to do or they'll get caught if they try to do it.

204
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:52,340
Speaker 0: Right, and then you have just the irresponsible parents.

205
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,960
Speaker 0: It's like well those kids are gonna be up all night because the parents are responsible.

206
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:56,984
Speaker 0: So it doesn't matter.

207
00:13:57,104 --> 00:14:01,400
Speaker 1: but this is more of a Thursday thing, but in the meta in the general, I do not like it.

208
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:09,810
Speaker 1: I'm fine with regulations laws everything to help protect kids and to help parents and all those things depends on the specific Yeah, but the philosophically I have no problem.

209
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,260
Speaker 0: We don't like the safe playground actually not at all.

210
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,596
Speaker 0: But philosophically and playground should not be a bed of spikes and fire.

211
00:14:15,636 --> 00:14:16,480
Speaker 0: All that would be pretty cool.

212
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:20,840
Speaker 1: I have no problem with the idea of something like this being debated.

213
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:26,919
Speaker 1: My problem is when I as an adult I have to deal with this stuff when I don't have.

214
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,998
Speaker 0: you know We don't live in Europe.

215
00:14:28,553 --> 00:14:39,116
Speaker 1: Nah But if I live in Europe or if I don't if I go to Europe on a business trip and I have a Wii U I want to buy Assassin's Creed at 1105 p.m I can't and that's bullshit.

216
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:39,597
Speaker 0: You mean 1105 a.m.

217
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:42,507
Speaker 1: No, 11 p.m.

218
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:43,170
Speaker 1: To 3 a.m.

219
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,060
Speaker 1: Is the only time you can do this.

220
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, you said if you want to buy it at 11 p.m.

221
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:47,744
Speaker 0: And you can.

222
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:48,285
Speaker 1: I said 1105 p.m I can't.

223
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:52,692
Speaker 0: oh What.

224
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,399
Speaker 0: oh, it's wait a minute.

225
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,323
Speaker 0: No, 1105 p.m.

226
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:56,568
Speaker 0: Will be late at night when you could.

227
00:14:56,588 --> 00:14:57,651
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I guess I could.

228
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,837
Speaker 0: you're backwards see like see what happens.

229
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:03,005
Speaker 1: You have confusing bullshit arbitrary regulations.

230
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,138
Speaker 0: I Was right the whole time but also Nintendo.

231
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:07,680
Speaker 1: how come?

232
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,864
Speaker 1: no one else does this stuff.

233
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:12,557
Speaker 0: Nintendo always does Extra shit for some stupid reason.

234
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:17,732
Speaker 1: I mean steam doesn't prevent me from buying a game at 11.

235
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:23,410
Speaker 0: This is why most of the world is PC gaming except for the US Yeah, where people are too dumb to plug a PC into the TV.

236
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,917
Speaker 1: I just thought this was kind of amazing.

237
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:34,360
Speaker 1: So I wanted to shed light on this sort of ridiculous star but anyway things of the day.

238
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:41,870
Speaker 1: so we were at an epic party at our friend's house over the weekend near Philly and Well, the YouTube party happened for a while downstairs.

239
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:44,360
Speaker 0: I was not invited to that YouTube party.

240
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:45,540
Speaker 1: No, you're busy doing other stuff.

241
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:51,800
Speaker 1: We also had the look at old pictures of rim and Scott and the front row crew from like a decade ago.

242
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:57,840
Speaker 1: I was at that party and we had the let's play Zendo with strangers party, which was actually really good.

243
00:15:58,422 --> 00:16:06,755
Speaker 1: I can't believe that one of our friends used the Zendo rule of Something involving prime numbers of pants the one you're not supposed to use.

244
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:07,900
Speaker 1: and yet they got it.

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,192
Speaker 1: But I think they only got it because I always use that as the example of a bullshit rule You shouldn't use.

246
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:17,280
Speaker 1: yeah But at the same time we also have a lot of friends who are getting really good at Zendo and start upping the ante.

247
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,936
Speaker 1: so We watched this series of short animated videos little shorts about Starcraft.

248
00:16:25,638 --> 00:16:28,119
Speaker 1: It is called Starcrafts.

249
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,242
Speaker 1: It's just adorable.

250
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:38,689
Speaker 1: It's little zerglings and protoss dudes running around with sound effects from the game being cute and They're super short and you should just watch all of these.

251
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:41,840
Speaker 1: They're by car bot animations and they're ridiculously adorable.

252
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,538
Speaker 0: This is funnier to me because I have recently actually beaten the Starcraft 2 campaign.

253
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:52,538
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about starting to play the Starcraft 2 campaign in the next six months and getting it into the queue.

254
00:16:52,558 --> 00:16:56,347
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm All right, you got a thing of the day.

255
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:56,809
Speaker 0: I do.

256
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,307
Speaker 0: yeah, so, you know the board game lahav Which you've only played a couple times.

257
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:01,253
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's okay.

258
00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:01,715
Speaker 1: Not great.

259
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:03,943
Speaker 0: It's good game These people.

260
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,167
Speaker 0: they're big board game nerds.

261
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:07,016
Speaker 0: They went to lahav.

262
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:17,040
Speaker 0: I would like to go there And what they did is they took the cards from the game And they went to all the places that are on the cards and took a picture with the card at the place.

263
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:23,960
Speaker 0: And here's a little imgur photo gallery of them holding up the cards from the places in front of the places.

264
00:17:24,161 --> 00:17:25,064
Speaker 1: That's adorable.

265
00:17:25,124 --> 00:17:25,987
Speaker 0: That is pretty good.

266
00:17:26,027 --> 00:17:29,760
Speaker 0: I'm wondering I'm trying to think of like what else can we do this with Puerto Rico?

267
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:35,233
Speaker 0: What Puerto Rico doesn't have a deck of cards really with pictures as the buildings.

268
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:37,480
Speaker 1: you go find buildings that do those things than plantations.

269
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:40,394
Speaker 0: I don't think you're gonna find all those plantations.

270
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:41,640
Speaker 0: You find an indigo plantation.

271
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,046
Speaker 1: There's probably still.

272
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:50,616
Speaker 0: I'll bet there is still indigo planting in Puerto Rico You gotta find an indigo factory a large indigo plant and a small indigo play.

273
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,183
Speaker 0: you're gonna find both of them All right, fine.

274
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:52,886
Speaker 1: Let's do Eclipse.

275
00:17:52,926 --> 00:17:53,930
Speaker 0: You gotta find a sugar mill.

276
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,633
Speaker 1: How about Eclipse?

277
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:55,557
Speaker 0: I'm up for that.

278
00:17:55,597 --> 00:18:00,126
Speaker 1: if you can make it We could do it with El Grande.

279
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,640
Speaker 1: go to all those regions of Spain, yeah, but those aren't on individual cards.

280
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:08,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just go and take a picture of a Caballero in front of a Castile in each place.

281
00:18:10,861 --> 00:18:18,580
Speaker 0: We're better off doing it with the D&D monster manual and Doing it with all the not all the monsters that actually exist.

282
00:18:18,941 --> 00:18:19,545
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

283
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:27,780
Speaker 0: like rats like fantasy movies and TV shows we find one instance of everything in Fantasy movies and TV shows and put and make basically take the monster man.

284
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,212
Speaker 0: It will replace the art with a picture from the movie or TV show.

285
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:39,592
Speaker 0: We might be able to pull it off with Genoa You know, it doesn't also have cards with places or anything our grid.

286
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:41,639
Speaker 1: just go find power plants of each type.

287
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,315
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, you're stretching it here in the meta moment.

288
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:51,797
Speaker 1: Holy shit We launched an entirely new show called geek nights presents did we?

289
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:52,921
Speaker 0: Yes Why?

290
00:18:53,563 --> 00:19:01,090
Speaker 1: because we're stupid and we committed to like 40 plus episodes of this bullshit and so far each one is taking us like It's like a half hour long.

291
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:09,138
Speaker 1: So too long And they're only gonna get longer because I was thinking about why don't you edit him down genius that is edited down.

292
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:16,980
Speaker 0: No So what we're doing Is a new show because we pretty much repeat the same thing over and over again so you can edit down.

293
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,291
Speaker 1: So we only say it once a YouTube show where we we take a media and we present it to you in a sort of Final thoughts format.

294
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,340
Speaker 1: So for example, we're starting.

295
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:30,020
Speaker 1: You know, we did radio free equestria is kind of like a test to get good at this kind of stuff.

296
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,727
Speaker 1: We're gonna keep doing radio free equestria.

297
00:19:31,747 --> 00:19:32,209
Speaker 1: Don't worry.

298
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:42,073
Speaker 0: I got a huge backlog of episodes I just have to upload and luckily the new episode which we have not our feed yet had A lot of material when it should have had none.

299
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:47,719
Speaker 1: I know apparently The pony named Luna spies on kids dreams in their sleep.

300
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,347
Speaker 0: That gives us something to talk about

301
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,271
Speaker 1: kind of creepy

302
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,718
Speaker 0: as being scared in the woods gives

303
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:51,838
Speaker 1: us

304
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:59,073
Speaker 0: Although we could talk about the haunted the haunted stories Like what's up with the headless horse and the rusty horseshoe

305
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:06,096
Speaker 1: also the fact that there's rainbow Waterfalls, so I guess they could harvest rainbows in the old days and later they made machines to make it.

306
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,420
Speaker 1: That's natural rainbow.

307
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,889
Speaker 1: They'd be like hydroelectric rainbow.

308
00:20:09,231 --> 00:20:09,613
Speaker 1: I don't know.

309
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:21,056
Speaker 1: Yeah So we're taking that and doing the same thing to an anime called shoujo kakamei, otena because it's Incredibly complex full of allegory lots to analyze little a lot of shit.

310
00:20:21,076 --> 00:20:22,100
Speaker 0: That's just fault, you know.

311
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,449
Speaker 0: Red herring.

312
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,748
Speaker 1: Yeah red herrings But also little bits like there's things.

313
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:33,166
Speaker 1: dudes say in episode one that an episode 38 you go Oh fuck, but you don't remember.

314
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:37,180
Speaker 0: but then if you watch episode one immediately after watching the final episode you go.

315
00:20:39,341 --> 00:21:00,820
Speaker 1: So if and when we finish this or if we get it on long enough to where we can support doing multiple shows geek nights Presents is going to be a show where we take things and we don't just review them You know, we don't just preview them we don't just talk about our experiences with them we finish them Mmm, because really we only have done this for anime up to this point.

316
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:11,095
Speaker 1: So we're trying to do and I guess our book clubs are trying to do this for other kinds of things In other meta news Magfest, oh, it's real close now fast.

355
00:22:57,561 --> 00:22:59,208
Speaker 1: We're really stepping up the game.

356
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,169
Speaker 1: if you thought we stepped up the game and Kinetic on last year We're gonna step up.

357
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,540
Speaker 1: this is so far for now.

358
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,192
Speaker 0: Let's heat them at a moment to things happening soon like magfa.

359
00:23:07,232 --> 00:23:09,883
Speaker 1: All right, the book club book is the great Gatsby It is.

360
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:11,467
Speaker 1: Scott has irregular bowel movements.

361
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:14,414
Speaker 1: I don't did you poop at this time yesterday.

362
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,403
Speaker 0: I Don't remember then?

363
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,269
Speaker 1: you do not have regular bowel movements.

364
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,066
Speaker 1: You've never had to poop during a geek nights recording before You got home early.

365
00:23:24,106 --> 00:23:24,529
Speaker 0: I don't know.

366
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,861
Speaker 1: I did this only 645.

367
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:31,439
Speaker 0: It's supposed to happen at the exact same time every day within a span of an hour or two.

368
00:23:32,362 --> 00:23:35,900
Speaker 1: Do you always poop right after geek nights or right before it in my bathroom?

369
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,808
Speaker 1: Maybe that's why I always run out of toilet paper.

370
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 1: You're using it all up every day before the show.

371
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:40,923
Speaker 1: It's cuz.

372
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,733
Speaker 0: you use half a roll every time you poop.

373
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,141
Speaker 1: I have a clean sphincter.

374
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,292
Speaker 0: your I also have a clean sphincter.

375
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:48,478
Speaker 1: apparently not if you don't use.

376
00:23:48,498 --> 00:23:57,990
Speaker 0: well apparently you're using all my toilet paper and blaming it on me and I think there is clean and your roll was almost empty and It is still not a hundred percent empty and my sphincter is clean.

377
00:23:58,492 --> 00:24:01,364
Speaker 1: That roll was almost full before it was almost into it Uh-huh.

378
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:07,229
Speaker 0: So do I need to take a picture of the roll?

379
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:09,640
Speaker 0: every time I poop before and after it's gotten I have a problem.

380
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:10,412
Speaker 1: That'd be a good tumblr.

381
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:13,004
Speaker 1: Really big problem.

382
00:24:13,284 --> 00:24:15,491
Speaker 0: Also, you should check us out and all the places on the internet.

383
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:20,496
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, g-plus Twitter Google communities But you think Facebook page.

384
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:30,067
Speaker 0: currently I think the thing that automatically posts our stuff to the Facebook page is broken and doesn't matter because Facebook doesn't reliably send your Friends anyway, yeah, but we're gonna.

385
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:31,010
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fix it.

386
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,777
Speaker 0: Anyway, but when I get a chance, don't forget your.

387
00:24:34,118 --> 00:24:38,589
Speaker 1: it's likely You're not getting all of our stuff If you only follow us on Facebook.

388
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:41,160
Speaker 0: 100% likely because it's not automatically posting there right now.

389
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:48,772
Speaker 1: But even once we get it posting there again, you're still not gonna get everything Maybe due to the way Facebook works with organizations like us.

390
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,978
Speaker 0: It's possible and their attempts at monetization.

391
00:24:50,998 --> 00:24:54,630
Speaker 1: Yeah So problem Scott and I have.

392
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:57,149
Speaker 1: we've had this problem for Ever 11 years.

393
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,267
Speaker 0: Our whole lives give or take.

394
00:25:00,327 --> 00:25:11,939
Speaker 1: now because there was a there was a time at our IT When we really only played board games Inside of our own group and other than if we played a choir with Scott Johnson, there was never a problem.

395
00:25:12,783 --> 00:25:16,860
Speaker 1: But then we brought in our horizons and decided we would bring our board gaming goodness to the world.

396
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:34,086
Speaker 1: We started playing board games with people we weren't already friends and family with and I learned something At a parapetia a horrible realization when I sat down to play Settlers of Catan and what should have taken 45 minutes took three hours Mm-hmm.

397
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:50,634
Speaker 1: It was in I think 2003 and I was playing Settlers of Catan at our wag with three people who I didn't know super well and had not played board Games with before and I realized at that moment Pretty much everyone else in the fucking world except me and Scott just never takes their turn.

398
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:52,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are exceptions.

399
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:58,612
Speaker 1: Those exceptions are mostly our own friends So all you FRC types and family that we play with.

400
00:25:58,953 --> 00:26:00,298
Speaker 1: we're not talking about most of you.

401
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:12,510
Speaker 0: Yeah well, there's a lot of reasons for Taking a turn slowly, but there's only one way to take a turn quickly be smart Yep, so you might remember a long time ago.

402
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,408
Speaker 1: We had a series on geek nights called how to not suck Man, where did that happen to that?

403
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:18,594
Speaker 1: So we're bringing it back.

404
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,539
Speaker 1: We're not gonna complain.

405
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:24,315
Speaker 0: We're gonna complain about all the slow people constantly and say how stupid they are.

406
00:26:24,536 --> 00:26:38,154
Speaker 1: in this episode we're basically going to tell you if you are or think you are one of those people who plays a board game and You're taking too long on your turn and other people are getting annoyed at you or odds are.

407
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:44,999
Speaker 1: or you play games with other people Who are doing this and it's frustrating you and you want to learn how to deal with them or?

408
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:50,765
Speaker 1: You want to get into the air hockey situation The air hockey conundrum.

409
00:26:51,227 --> 00:27:02,397
Speaker 1: if you follow all of it by all of our advice and you're not having a problem Suddenly you'll start taking your turn in a tenth the time you normally spend and now you're gonna hate all the rest of your friends But you'll win a lot more games.

410
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,979
Speaker 1: So how to not suck at taking your motherfucking turn.

411
00:27:08,782 --> 00:27:10,507
Speaker 1: We're just talking about board games.

412
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:15,240
Speaker 1: Oh these concepts can apply generally to other types of games.

413
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,746
Speaker 0: Alright, so the first thing you got to do right which is true in general for not sucking a board games Turn the page and then you wash your hands.

414
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:23,171
Speaker 0: Is know the fucking rules.

415
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:27,407
Speaker 0: a lot of people take so long in their turn because they're Not sure what the fuck they're supposed to be doing.

416
00:27:27,568 --> 00:27:30,960
Speaker 1: now you know, let's assume you're you're learning the game.

417
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,905
Speaker 1: You don't know the rules.

418
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:33,091
Speaker 1: that well, that's fine.

419
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:34,940
Speaker 1: You can still take your turn quickly.

420
00:27:35,782 --> 00:27:38,859
Speaker 1: The way to do that is if you're confused about a rule on your turn.

421
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:42,896
Speaker 1: What normal people do most people I've seen is they sit there going.

422
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:47,559
Speaker 0: hmm Like they're thinking like or ask to see the rules and start reading them.

423
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:49,975
Speaker 1: Yep So they'll be like, hey, can I see the rules for a second?

424
00:27:49,995 --> 00:27:50,680
Speaker 1: They just sit there going.

425
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,668
Speaker 0: Why'd you just fucking ask?

426
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,078
Speaker 1: or they don't even ask for the rules.

427
00:27:54,098 --> 00:28:02,597
Speaker 1: They go and then after five minutes of They look up and say hey rim What are victory points again?

428
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,199
Speaker 1: That's why I flipped the fucking table over and go home.

429
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,158
Speaker 1: Yeah to ask immediately and if you have to ask the same question every round.

430
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:14,220
Speaker 1: you Probably shouldn't be playing this game.

431
00:28:14,562 --> 00:28:19,772
Speaker 1: You need to go home and read the rules because you obviously didn't pay attention When it was taught to you nor when everyone answered your questions.

432
00:28:19,792 --> 00:28:22,242
Speaker 0: and maybe you should go home and play Candyland and work your way Up to whatever you.

433
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,687
Speaker 1: but the moral here.

434
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:36,820
Speaker 1: if you are confused about a point in the rules during the game ask Immediately and if asking the question is going to compromise your position in the game That's your penalty for not knowing the rules.

435
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:37,663
Speaker 1: You will.

436
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:41,735
Speaker 1: you will have a more fruitful experience by learning the rules by asking the question.

437
00:28:42,056 --> 00:28:46,535
Speaker 1: if you're really worried about it Pick someone else at the table and say hey, can I ask you a question?

438
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:47,460
Speaker 1: show them the card?

439
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,283
Speaker 1: You don't understand.

440
00:28:48,303 --> 00:28:52,019
Speaker 0: maybe find someone who's not actually playing the game but knows the rules and ask them.

441
00:28:52,581 --> 00:29:02,180
Speaker 0: But if it's like a card in your hand you want to ask about maybe there's someone around who knows how the game works And you can just show them your card and you won't have to show anyone else at the table who's actually playing your card.

442
00:29:02,773 --> 00:29:11,292
Speaker 0: All right The second thing you got to do is the most important while you're playing the game Pay fucking attention to the game the whole time you're playing the game.

443
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,780
Speaker 0: now a lot of people that sit down to play a game.

444
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,363
Speaker 0: Well, what do they do?

445
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:15,408
Speaker 0: They getting up?

446
00:29:15,609 --> 00:29:20,525
Speaker 0: They're looking around walking around peeing Drinking talking about something.

447
00:29:20,546 --> 00:29:23,699
Speaker 0: That's not the game not seeing what other people doing during the turns.

448
00:29:23,739 --> 00:29:29,080
Speaker 0: now There are some games where you don't have to pay attention during other people's turns say Alhambra, right?

449
00:29:29,321 --> 00:29:32,495
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what the fuck other people do on their turns.

450
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:45,868
Speaker 1: when it comes to your turn well, there is a fifth or sixth order of strategy and Process you can do to be to have a slight advantage in Alhambra by counting the cards people take up But you really don't need to do that.

451
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's nothing to do during other people's turns.

452
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,554
Speaker 0: So you can just wait till your turn then decide very quickly because there isn't much to decide.

453
00:29:52,635 --> 00:29:58,828
Speaker 0: but in most games You should pay attention What's happening during other people's turns like in Puerto Rico.

454
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:11,547
Speaker 1: now many who play games or teeny especially might already be saying but rim You get up all the time and dick around with people and yet because I already know what I'm gonna do in my turn I the master Attention, I will not.

455
00:30:11,587 --> 00:30:14,080
Speaker 0: yeah, it's it's do as I say don't do as I do right?

456
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,980
Speaker 0: I will not get up or take my attention off of a game Except in the case where I already know what I'm going to do on my turn.

457
00:30:22,482 --> 00:30:26,969
Speaker 0: You know and my turn is going to take a very small amount of time But it is not yet my turn.

458
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:35,474
Speaker 0: unless I am in that situation Where my next turn was already planned and will be swift I am paying attention to the game and calculating the next turn.

459
00:30:35,815 --> 00:30:48,880
Speaker 0: as soon as my turn ends I immediately begin calculating the next turn and this is point number three right parallel processing While other people are playing you don't get up and leave like at Alhambra.

460
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:53,960
Speaker 0: You pay the fuck attention and you think about what you're gonna do on your turn.

461
00:30:54,502 --> 00:31:03,180
Speaker 0: During other people's turns you don't stop playing the game at any moment Right unless you can make no more meaningful decisions.

462
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:19,977
Speaker 0: Or you are waiting for new information to be able to figure out what to do when you're doing your turn in which case Sit there and wait for that new information to appear Which is why we get very frustrated when your turn takes so long because you're waiting for you to reveal the information We need to complete our calculations.

463
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:23,437
Speaker 1: now We talk about processing in parallel.

464
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:24,719
Speaker 1: well Let's say you do that.

465
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,574
Speaker 1: But even then there are some games where you can iterate and step through like acquire.

466
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:36,040
Speaker 1: as a game you can basically Calculate the perfect move, but it takes a while unless you reasonably go to math and pattern recognition.

467
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:44,149
Speaker 1: But you need to as a player, and this is where these get more complicated Recognize very simply don't worry about all this other stuff.

468
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:49,923
Speaker 1: recognize when a decision you are about to make is Arbitrary now.

469
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:53,673
Speaker 1: This is already this everything the high level technique.

470
00:31:53,873 --> 00:32:03,515
Speaker 1: the next several steps that we're gonna talk about are Things you can do that are all under the sort of meta category of be better at games.

471
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:11,260
Speaker 1: if you are better at games Generally you don't have to write a specific game just better at games and generally learn master basic skills.

472
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:12,940
Speaker 1: Then you can do all these things.

473
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:23,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there's some things you can do to speed up your turn that you don't need to be good at games to Do like the things we've already mentioned paying attention and things like that and if you don't do those things then there's a fucking Problem.

474
00:32:23,465 --> 00:32:24,530
Speaker 0: there's another set of things.

475
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,640
Speaker 0: we need to have a low level of game skills.

476
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:28,858
Speaker 0: You need to have some amount of skills to do them.

477
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:33,200
Speaker 0: So and it's not necessarily a big fucking problem if you don't do those it's just slightly annoying.

478
00:32:33,562 --> 00:32:36,740
Speaker 0: Then there are things where you can take your turn crazy fast if you're a master.

479
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:41,057
Speaker 0: No one's expecting that from you if you're not a master, but you should still strive for it.

480
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:42,863
Speaker 0: otherwise Why are you here?

481
00:32:43,164 --> 00:32:48,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, like in teeny I'll just be like bam bam bam bam bam, but I've played teeny like a hundred times.

482
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:52,814
Speaker 0: It's also okay If a few turns during the game are slow and the rest are fast.

483
00:32:52,934 --> 00:33:09,394
Speaker 0: when I play a game like teeny Most of my turns will be relatively quick, but maybe two or three times during the game There will be a tough situation where even when after it gets around to my turn Oh, I don't know what to do or something particularly devastating happens right before my turn and then I go off fuck And then I need to really figure it out or

484
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:12,052
Speaker 1: so This is a kind of an aside.

485
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:28,152
Speaker 1: if you want to get better at games Watch people who are good at a game play and pay attention to when they take a long time on their turn and when they don't because if we're playing if I'm playing a game that I know and I I'm taking my turns like that and suddenly I take a long time on my turn.

486
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:43,820
Speaker 1: if you can figure out why suddenly, I'm you know thinking really hard you're gonna start to figure out the game because aspect for Recognize arbitrary decisions is such low-hanging fruit that so many people I play games with just can't grasp.

487
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:48,158
Speaker 1: There are many decisions in games that are effectively arbitrary.

488
00:33:48,559 --> 00:34:02,640
Speaker 1: either It doesn't matter what choice you make because it actually doesn't matter or it doesn't matter because you Lack the ability to calculate how much it matters to a degree that will actually affect the game.

489
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,666
Speaker 0: For example, who's gonna if you sit there and you're playing rock-paper-scissors and you sit there thinking he's chose rock last time He's not gonna choose rock again.

490
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:10,967
Speaker 0: Is he?

491
00:34:11,027 --> 00:34:11,953
Speaker 0: or maybe he will.

492
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,098
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe he won't.

493
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,273
Speaker 0: Inconceivable, right?

494
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:17,384
Speaker 0: then You are stupid.

495
00:34:17,404 --> 00:34:19,870
Speaker 0: You should know that it's arbitrary.

496
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:20,612
Speaker 0: which one you pick?

497
00:34:20,831 --> 00:34:23,980
Speaker 0: just fucking pick one randomly as randomly as possible.

498
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:24,722
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

499
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:32,905
Speaker 0: Do not use any psychology or any chain of logic, you know, if you can use all three at once That way you can't lose.

500
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,188
Speaker 0: you win two out of three times.

501
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:43,951
Speaker 1: now the same time there might be two options where you know Option a one and a half time trade a good To get money and option B is trade a good to get victory points.

502
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:45,777
Speaker 1: and maybe you're not like.

503
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:46,620
Speaker 1: you don't know.

504
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:57,520
Speaker 1: so you could try to figure it out, but if you have no direction to go on and You're trying to calculate it, but you don't understand what you're calculating.

505
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:03,832
Speaker 1: You'll think that you're working hard to win the game But really your brain just going in circles and you're not like.

506
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:05,640
Speaker 1: you're adding numbers up and you're not going anywhere.

507
00:35:05,984 --> 00:35:11,932
Speaker 1: There are also some decisions so the decision is effectively arbitrary because while it could be calculated you like the capacity.

508
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:20,872
Speaker 1: as soon as you recognize that you will not be Able to come to the mathematical conclusion You're trying to get to in your brain in a reasonable span of time.

509
00:35:21,113 --> 00:35:22,298
Speaker 1: You need to cut your losses.

510
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,204
Speaker 1: pretend It's an arbitrary decision.

511
00:35:24,264 --> 00:35:29,760
Speaker 1: instead let the game go on and instead do a post hoc process of at the end of the game.

512
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,608
Speaker 1: Think back that time.

513
00:35:31,648 --> 00:35:34,380
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure it out now that I've seen the end of the game.

514
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,180
Speaker 0: What should I have done for example in a game of Puerto Rico, right?

515
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,613
Speaker 0: There are certain things where I don't decide.

516
00:35:39,634 --> 00:35:40,640
Speaker 0: I just go with it.

517
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:46,982
Speaker 0: For example, let's say it's the first time the captain comes out and all the boats are empty and I pick the captain and I got Three corn.

518
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,512
Speaker 0: do I go in the small boat the medium boat of the big boat?

519
00:35:49,732 --> 00:35:50,937
Speaker 1: now there you could I.

520
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:51,720
Speaker 0: there's easy.

521
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:54,871
Speaker 0: It's possible to look at everyone's barrels and fucking figure it out.

522
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:55,453
Speaker 0: You know what I do.

523
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:57,340
Speaker 0: I just fucking pick a boat.

524
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,226
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit.

525
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,676
Speaker 0: that matters so little.

526
00:35:59,696 --> 00:36:08,509
Speaker 0: ah now Here's the thing that claim might end up mattering but to time it would take to figure it out Versus how much it would benefit me in the game.

527
00:36:08,629 --> 00:36:11,517
Speaker 0: I don't bother even though it's I really want to win.

528
00:36:11,577 --> 00:36:12,620
Speaker 0: It's a skill based game.

529
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:13,518
Speaker 0: I'm very good at it.

530
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,452
Speaker 0: I don't bother thinking about that when I just put my stuff on whatever boat I feel like

531
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:30,732
Speaker 1: now while the iterative Calculation of that is basically impossible or useless because either you're gonna be in a tournament where there's gonna be some sort of time limit I mean or you're playing with friends where there's the punching time limit.

532
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,458
Speaker 0: I mean there could be something obvious.

533
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:36,140
Speaker 0: for example Let's say I have four corn and the person next to me has four corn.

534
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:40,112
Speaker 0: I'm gonna put my four corn on the sixth size boat to prevent them from.

535
00:36:40,754 --> 00:36:43,082
Speaker 0: but that's so easy to see I can see that Immediately.

536
00:36:43,443 --> 00:36:48,160
Speaker 0: So what I do is I look around really quickly and it takes me about three seconds to figure that one out.

537
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,631
Speaker 0: And if I don't see any of those types of situations, then I just pick.

538
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,895
Speaker 0: any fucking boat does not know.

539
00:36:52,915 --> 00:36:54,220
Speaker 1: this leads into item six.

540
00:36:54,742 --> 00:36:56,211
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm gonna take a term.

541
00:36:56,231 --> 00:37:01,014
Speaker 1: I we had other terms for this But I'm committed to using the terms in that Garfield book from now on.

542
00:37:01,075 --> 00:37:04,887
Speaker 1: Okay, the characters of games Develop directional heuristics.

543
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,880
Speaker 1: what that means is look at Scott's situation.

544
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:09,706
Speaker 1: So which boat do I put it on?

545
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:18,580
Speaker 1: the decision is effectively arbitrary because I lack the ability to compute Reasonably all the possible outcomes into the future with odds that will actually have a chance.

546
00:37:18,709 --> 00:37:27,932
Speaker 0: Yeah I have no idea what barrels if I bother to think about what barrels people could possibly have for the next captain Let alone two or three captains down the road.

547
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:28,917
Speaker 0: Fuck that.

548
00:37:28,937 --> 00:37:39,000
Speaker 1: So I play the game a lot and Like I said before if there's a decision that appears are that appears like it is not actually arbitrary.

549
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:43,080
Speaker 1: But you it is effectively arbitrary for you because you can't figure it out.

550
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:50,719
Speaker 1: You have to put like a mental bookmark next to that and every time you have to think back every round Until it becomes apparent what you should have done.

551
00:37:51,500 --> 00:38:04,060
Speaker 1: Eventually, you'll have this sort of soft skill this directional heuristic Directional meaning you can have recognized a pattern where oh if the board looks like this I should move in this direction.

552
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:08,634
Speaker 0: Yeah a directional heuristic is basically the method you use to decide what to do on.

553
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:12,049
Speaker 0: your term for is a perfect example of one of My favorite directional heuristics.

554
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:18,720
Speaker 0: right the way I play power grid How much do I bid on a power plant that I want in power grid?

555
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,142
Speaker 0: And this is very simple calculation I make.

556
00:38:21,182 --> 00:38:29,092
Speaker 0: what I do is I look at how much the resources I'm going to have to pay To get the resources I want from the market that turn.

557
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,380
Speaker 0: I estimate that and I take that money and set it aside.

558
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,044
Speaker 0: No, then I look at how many houses I want to buy that turn based on the total amount of power I'll be able to make.

559
00:38:38,345 --> 00:38:41,780
Speaker 0: how how many will I get be able to get houses up to that number?

560
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,740
Speaker 0: How much will it cost me right this round?

561
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:57,424
Speaker 0: I estimate and I remove that amount of money from my hand and then I look at how much money is left and that's the Maximum amount of money that I will spend on buying a power plant this turn and that is my directional heuristic the method I use to make a decision.

562
00:38:57,464 --> 00:39:01,278
Speaker 0: the decision I need to make is how much do I am I willing to bid on the power plant?

563
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,439
Speaker 0: and There's a method to making that decision subtract the resource money subtract the house money count the leftover money All right.

564
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,820
Speaker 0: So these are directional heuristics and you had to develop these in particular games.

565
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,726
Speaker 0: You look at the decisions you have to make in a particular game and then figure out what will be the method I use to Make that decision.

566
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:25,400
Speaker 0: and then once you have that method Every time it gets to your turn anytime you had to make that decision.

567
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:26,626
Speaker 0: Use the method.

568
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,400
Speaker 0: use it as soon as you have enough information to use it.

569
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:30,425
Speaker 0: Figure.

570
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,430
Speaker 0: then you have your decision.

571
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,200
Speaker 1: some of these are calculated.

572
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:38,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, some some of them are crutches in calculation like if anything were really good.

573
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:45,160
Speaker 1: So in Tigris and Euphrates, I have a really simple heuristic of when I will attack someone else.

574
00:39:45,504 --> 00:39:46,700
Speaker 1: I have all these other conditionals.

575
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,654
Speaker 0: I can't really get into what I have a plus three advantage or more if I will.

576
00:39:50,814 --> 00:39:58,460
Speaker 1: you know if I'm if I get to The point of will I attack someone but yes once I am in the I have reached a decision tree of will I attack this?

577
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,222
Speaker 1: Person or not.

578
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:04,880
Speaker 1: It comes down to something so simple as do I have a three advantage or not?

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,757
Speaker 1: If the answer is yes, I attack no matter what?

580
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:12,460
Speaker 0: Well, I won't attack if a if winning won't get me a significant number of points.

581
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:24,285
Speaker 1: I know because I'm not gonna buy is fine - right, but I'm not gonna hurry up the end of the game if I'm behind What I said, I have all these other ones that get me to the point of if attacking is even an option Mmm.

582
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,098
Speaker 1: if attacking is an option So attacking is only an option for me.

583
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:45,640
Speaker 1: If one it is not likely to give a player who has a chance of beating me Points in a color that I know they're deficient in Mmm, if it is not if it is likely to give me points in a color that I am deficient in All the obverse like cases of that are also, you know They're like, I don't care.

584
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:56,428
Speaker 1: I'm not likely to attack or get to the point of deciding to attack if I don't need that color unless it causes disruption to A player who is likely to be me The treasure situation all these other factors.

585
00:40:56,729 --> 00:41:08,138
Speaker 1: There's so many of them that I could probably enumerate them all But I've played the game so much that it becomes a little more than patterns to where and you'll notice this if you play a lot of games.

586
00:41:09,221 --> 00:41:21,075
Speaker 1: Sometimes I'm calculating in power grid I have a gut feeling for what I should do and then I do a calculation to validate like Will I have enough money to do the thing that my gut heuristic tells me to do?

587
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:22,946
Speaker 1: if the answer is yes I just do it.

588
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:31,040
Speaker 1: if the answer is no Then I fall back on these more complex heuristics to figure out what I should do because my gut heuristic obviously was mistaken.

589
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:43,227
Speaker 0: Now if you don't have a heuristic either because you're new at a game or you're not sure right what you should try to do usually to come up with a heuristic right is What will get you the most victory points.

590
00:41:43,348 --> 00:41:48,600
Speaker 0: most games are victory point games and if it's not a victory point game You got to think you know, what will help you win, right?

591
00:41:48,840 --> 00:42:03,596
Speaker 0: So find the thing that makes you win whatever that may be most money most points get to the end the fastest and look at your options and Can you immediately tell which one of those will get you the most victory the closest to winning?

592
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:04,680
Speaker 0: if you can't tell?

593
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,640
Speaker 0: Just fucking pick one because you'll be able to tell after playing the game more, right?

594
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,544
Speaker 0: Don't sit around and try.

595
00:42:10,564 --> 00:42:12,454
Speaker 0: if you can't immediately tell right away.

596
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:14,362
Speaker 0: Don't bother Right?

597
00:42:14,643 --> 00:42:18,394
Speaker 0: that then think about it during other people's turns, you know, which one?

598
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:27,851
Speaker 0: that way you're not wasting everyone's time You know trying to cram in like multiple sessions of game learning into your first playthrough Now say you can't figure it out at all.

599
00:42:27,932 --> 00:42:28,879
Speaker 1: Like you have nowhere to go.

600
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,349
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you're acting randomly and you lose.

601
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,554
Speaker 1: you're just doing the best you can.

602
00:42:32,574 --> 00:42:34,060
Speaker 1: the key there is pattern recognition.

603
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:35,466
Speaker 1: You start to notice.

604
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:39,020
Speaker 1: Hey rim always goes into the castle and Kayla's and he seems to win a lot.

605
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:43,060
Speaker 1: Oh look rim and Scott and all those guys seem to castle all the time.

606
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:45,518
Speaker 1: I should probably be doing that too.

607
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:47,464
Speaker 0: yep see now here's the thing.

608
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:57,140
Speaker 0: in a lot of games doing what someone else is doing just brings you both down because you're fighting over a Shared resource and this other player who's not fighting over that same resource and is doing something different will win.

609
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:03,571
Speaker 0: But that's okay because if you're a noob and you know You can't already play this game quickly and make your decisions quickly.

610
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,220
Speaker 0: You don't have your directional heuristic set up, right?

611
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:20,214
Speaker 0: Better to copy someone else to learn and get the feel for what they're doing Because you'll do a lot better than just doing whatever you feel like that's wrong and you'll just be in the shitter and then they Will be fighting for supremacy.

612
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:27,819
Speaker 0: now at least make a good placement and feel better about yourself and learn some of the patterns of movement by copying somehow in

613
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:42,712
Speaker 1: a super super generalized case if you go before Someone else in whatever sense that entails you are better off copying that person Then copying a person who goes before you whatever there

614
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:42,933
Speaker 0: is.

615
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:49,356
Speaker 0: if there is a game with some sort of turn sequence Right, you want to do the same thing as someone who goes after you.

616
00:43:49,397 --> 00:43:54,500
Speaker 0: that for example Let's say power grid and you're you're going in with the coal power plants, right?

617
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,955
Speaker 0: Well, you want to buy your coal before the other guy who buys coal.

618
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:09,799
Speaker 0: if you have to buy coal second And the so other guy who likes coal is going before you don't do coal do oil or something else because it's gonna be worse For you if he steals all the coal out from under you.

619
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:14,620
Speaker 1: So back to more, you know non game theory ish sort of skills.

620
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:18,005
Speaker 1: Learn how to shuffle cards.

621
00:44:18,105 --> 00:44:18,847
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

622
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:25,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's so many mechanical things you have to do in a game shuffling cards rolling

623
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:28,667
Speaker 1: dice uni if you want if you're serious about playing counting

624
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:41,864
Speaker 0: thing moving is moving a space, you know addition and subtraction moving upon and the Number of spaces in one jump and not sitting there going one, two, three, four five six unless it's a joke Just to piss people.

625
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:47,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if I in carcass own if I get a bunch of points in one go I go one two three.

626
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,660
Speaker 0: But that's just trash talk that's not slow play.

627
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,528
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't need to do that to calculate 17 plus.

628
00:44:54,608 --> 00:45:11,952
Speaker 0: counting your money quickly handling bills and coins quickly and it Yeah being it if you're playing poker the ability just Neil be able to count the chips quickly and send them out into the Into the table instead of sitting there being like one two, right those sorts of things Really bother everyone because you've already made a decision.

629
00:45:12,253 --> 00:45:13,397
Speaker 0: You know what you're gonna do, right?

630
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,480
Speaker 0: You're just like you just can't shuffle your cards and everyone is sitting there waiting for you.

631
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:25,040
Speaker 1: You think this might be obvious, but no I see people who literally not only can't shuffle cards, but never get better at it.

632
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:30,268
Speaker 1: They just like throw all their Dominion cards in a pile and I go On the table.

633
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:32,039
Speaker 0: that is not tournament acceptable.

634
00:45:32,502 --> 00:45:34,730
Speaker 1: You at least need to know a proper card.

635
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:36,277
Speaker 1: shuffle or the like.

636
00:45:36,377 --> 00:45:37,000
Speaker 1: drop shuffle.

637
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:42,798
Speaker 0: And if you don't know how to do some sort of card shuffling YouTube go to YouTube watch videos of people doing it.

638
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,768
Speaker 0: go to The drugstore buy a deck of bicycle cards.

639
00:45:45,808 --> 00:45:46,932
Speaker 0: write a real card deck.

640
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,015
Speaker 0: Not a cheap-ass one.

641
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,560
Speaker 0: That's really not nicely coded.

642
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,005
Speaker 0: You know a nice smooth one.

643
00:45:51,547 --> 00:45:52,772
Speaker 0: open it up and freaking.

644
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:59,980
Speaker 0: watch that video and keep doing it Over and over until you can fucking do it and don't give me that small hand big hand bullshit, right?

645
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:07,218
Speaker 0: I could shuffle cards and I was three years old and I can still shuffle cards and my grandpa showed me I just watch what he was doing and copied it until I could do it.

646
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,704
Speaker 1: So I was the same thing.

647
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:21,834
Speaker 0: if you need YouTube grandpa, then I once played in a magic tournament with a 300 card deck Mostly as a joke because the kids No deck limit, but you must have a deck that can be shuffled in a reasonable amount of time.

648
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:32,370
Speaker 1: So, uh, I Didn't win the tournament, but I got to the finals because everyone around me was scrubs and that was basically Trash talk the deck his kids to sit down.

649
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:35,220
Speaker 1: They'd be like they'd look at this deck and they'd be like, what the fuck?

650
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,398
Speaker 1: Is that I'm like, it's got five colors bitches.

651
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:42,272
Speaker 0: You couldn't play anything for like the first ten turns.

652
00:46:42,292 --> 00:46:42,674
Speaker 0: You're lucky.

653
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:45,087
Speaker 0: No one tried to set you on fire Just they didn't.

654
00:46:45,188 --> 00:46:46,255
Speaker 1: they weren't good at the game.

655
00:46:46,275 --> 00:46:47,140
Speaker 1: It was actually reasonably.

656
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:51,100
Speaker 1: It was actually only three colors and had a fuck ton of artifacts.

657
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, because none of them had.

658
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:54,598
Speaker 1: it's like no magic tournament.

659
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:55,000
Speaker 0: I played him.

660
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,383
Speaker 0: I was a kid.

661
00:46:55,404 --> 00:46:56,999
Speaker 0: people knew what the fuck they were doing except me.

662
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was in one tournament where I lost due to poison.

663
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, I almost I was really not happy.

664
00:47:02,959 --> 00:47:11,184
Speaker 1: So similar to this learn a gaming lexicon because most board games are Very similar.

665
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:15,579
Speaker 1: if someone says there's going to be a card draft You should know what that means.

666
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:17,086
Speaker 1: Like it's one thing.

667
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:22,149
Speaker 1: if I'm gonna teach someone how to play a board game and like and I tell them Alright, so we start with a card draft.

668
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:23,436
Speaker 1: It works like this.

669
00:47:23,536 --> 00:47:27,238
Speaker 1: Let's go versus explaining what a card draft is.

670
00:47:28,661 --> 00:47:39,455
Speaker 1: Also, if I have to explain what the card draft is in a fundamental level then the people at the table seem to not Understand it even if I go through the mechanical stuff because now they're not just learning the game.

671
00:47:39,475 --> 00:47:41,020
Speaker 1: They're learning all these other pieces.

672
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:49,900
Speaker 1: It's like if you have to learn how auctions work because you've never heard of an auction before now Can't play a bidding game because you've never heard of an auction.

673
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:50,582
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're.

674
00:47:50,622 --> 00:47:54,957
Speaker 1: now you're learning the auction game before you even get to the power grid part of power grid.

675
00:47:55,037 --> 00:47:57,446
Speaker 0: Yeah So what's an auction?

676
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,638
Speaker 0: Oh fuck an auction is only one small part of this game.

677
00:48:00,658 --> 00:48:01,260
Speaker 0: We are fucked.

678
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,949
Speaker 1: You've got to learn a basic gaming lexicon.

679
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:05,936
Speaker 1: Are you gonna take forever on your goddamn turn?

680
00:48:06,338 --> 00:48:09,696
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Honestly, if you do all those things your terms are gonna be like that.

681
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:13,919
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean really the biggest one is when it's someone else's turn.

682
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:19,260
Speaker 0: Think about what you're gonna do in your turn and then if you're still paying attention, you'll be alert.

683
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:32,444
Speaker 0: I fail this sometimes, you know You'll be alert when your turn begins and as soon as your turn begins immediately start executing your turn and then as soon as your turn ends make sure the next person starts their turn and hopefully they will Be alert and just start taking

684
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:36,980
Speaker 1: up and if you can't figure out what to do and everyone's already groaning give up you.

685
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:38,805
Speaker 1: There's no way you're gonna figure it out.

686
00:48:38,946 --> 00:48:45,025
Speaker 1: act randomly based on the simplest directional heuristic you can and go far Mm-hmm.

687
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,470
Speaker 0: There anything else to say about taking your goddamn turn?

688
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:49,735
Speaker 1: I think we've covered.

689
00:48:49,775 --> 00:48:52,926
Speaker 1: if you do those ten things You counted all the things.

690
00:48:52,946 --> 00:48:56,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, we came up with them arbitrarily as we were talking, but there ended up being ten.

691
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:58,018
Speaker 0: Okay.

692
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,920
Speaker 1: So yeah, so I guess there's one side discussion.

693
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:09,240
Speaker 1: How do you deal with if you're not me and Scott who are just perfectly willing to be assholes to people and you're playing a?

694
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,731
Speaker 1: Friendly game with someone who won't take their turn.

695
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,739
Speaker 1: How do you get him to take their turn?

696
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:16,139
Speaker 0: Well, you can say, you know, listen Can you hurry it up?

697
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,940
Speaker 0: Like, you know, you can get a stopwatch and show them how long their turn is taking.

698
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:21,344
Speaker 0: You can.

699
00:49:21,384 --> 00:49:27,469
Speaker 0: you can just get up and ignore the game because you if you already decided your turn Because you got so much extra time to decide right?

700
00:49:27,891 --> 00:49:28,433
Speaker 0: That's another thing.

701
00:49:28,453 --> 00:49:29,316
Speaker 0: You gotta think about right?

702
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:33,740
Speaker 0: You might be thinking Oh, I'll win by taking a long time on my turn so I get the right decision.

703
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:39,400
Speaker 0: That is never the case What you're really doing is you're giving everyone else so much more time to think about their turns.

704
00:49:39,982 --> 00:49:43,555
Speaker 0: So in power grid you want to take your turn faster to hurt the other players.

705
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:44,297
Speaker 0: they have less time.

706
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:50,360
Speaker 1: to power grid I have heuristics, but if you take five minutes on your turn, I'm gonna count every fucking electro.

707
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:57,445
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to count out like exact actions and exact numbers of dollars I've got.

708
00:49:57,465 --> 00:50:03,320
Speaker 1: you'll see if I play a game of power to people who are slow You'll see me like lining up multiple turns of bullshit in front of me.

709
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,260
Speaker 1: I'll be like making stacks of bills counted out for yeah

710
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:18,793
Speaker 0: Because you know unlike some other people who get distracted and go look at something else while the game is going on like some TV Or some conversation if you give me more goddamn time I'm gonna think about the next turn in the next turn in the next turn.

711
00:50:18,813 --> 00:50:20,460
Speaker 0: You're only fucking yourself over.

712
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:21,559
Speaker 0: You're better off.

713
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:27,329
Speaker 0: The only way you're gonna have a chance is if you play your turn quickly, it might not be the best possible decision But it'll be.

714
00:50:27,695 --> 00:50:37,420
Speaker 0: you know Good enough maybe and you won't give me time to make the ultimate best Humanly possible decision in the universe because I waited five whole minutes for you to do your turn.

715
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:41,960
Speaker 1: Now the reality is that if you're taking a long time on your turn your friends are taking long times on their turns.

716
00:50:42,742 --> 00:50:43,244
Speaker 1: I hate to say it.

717
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,295
Speaker 0: basically just it's gonna make the game on fun.

718
00:50:45,315 --> 00:50:51,780
Speaker 1: If everyone's slow That's why people hate like monopoly, but it also means that you and your friends are all collectively not that good at games.

719
00:50:52,422 --> 00:50:55,711
Speaker 0: Mmm now play easier games until you get faster now.

720
00:50:55,872 --> 00:51:06,020
Speaker 1: if you get better at these things and you find that like if say you Start you follow our advice and you start taking your turns faster You're gonna find that you start winning a lot more often and you're gonna get into the boat.

721
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,110
Speaker 0: You ever see the guy who takes slow on his turn be the guy.

722
00:51:09,612 --> 00:51:11,218
Speaker 1: well except Scott Johnson in a choir, right?

723
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:12,401
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

724
00:51:12,462 --> 00:51:16,640
Speaker 0: The other thing to think about right is you know exactly that the analysis paralysis.

725
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:21,374
Speaker 0: Sometimes it could be the game's fault that people are taking a long time.

726
00:51:21,394 --> 00:51:33,660
Speaker 0: those games suck and I don't play them anymore Now, you know because the game is constructed in such a way that you know Like chess people take a long time on their turn if there's no chess, but look there's chess clocks to deal with that.

727
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:45,740
Speaker 0: But sometimes there aren't chess clocks and people take forever and because that gives them an advantage right what you need to do is Just not play those games or bring in the chess clock, right?

728
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:53,471
Speaker 0: And I think adding a timer to a games even if it's not part of the rules is perfectly Okay in a situation of an analysis paralysis game.

729
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:55,919
Speaker 0: if it's the game's fault that taking.

730
00:51:55,939 --> 00:52:09,949
Speaker 0: you know There's this long, you know time to take your turn It won't hurt the game to throw a timer in there and it's pretty easy to come up with a rule for the timer Such as you know when the timer is up You must make a move or you lose.

731
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,003
Speaker 0: just if you can't think of any other rule like some sort of penalty that doesn't fuck The game up.

732
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:16,800
Speaker 0: just say you lose game over because someone took too long.

733
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,092
Speaker 1: It's not say you start taking your turns faster and none of your friends do and you start finding That's not fun to play games with your friends anymore.

734
00:52:23,132 --> 00:52:23,757
Speaker 1: I hate to say this.

735
00:52:23,778 --> 00:52:26,725
Speaker 1: it Means your friends are scrubs.

736
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:30,095
Speaker 1: Yeah in that sense this word air hockey problem.

737
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:31,960
Speaker 1: The term scrubs have been thrown around a lot.

738
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:41,720
Speaker 1: I'll try to find the article But if I can't find it then I'm not gonna link to it obviously But I read an article where a guy came up with a really good definition of scrub because I'd use the word forever.

739
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,825
Speaker 1: But this guy is a good definition.

740
00:52:42,885 --> 00:52:44,794
Speaker 1: It's someone who plays games.

741
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:47,324
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm a lot But never.

742
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:52,460
Speaker 1: but after a certain point basically never invest to get better than that point.

743
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:57,960
Speaker 1: Well simultaneously denigrating the skills it takes to get beyond that point.

744
00:52:58,321 --> 00:53:02,639
Speaker 1: It's the Street Fighter guy who says you using, you know flowchart can is cheap.

745
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:11,289
Speaker 1: Or the Starcraft guy who's like, oh you're just doing you know, you're just APMing it up and microing me Like yeah, that's how you get that's how you're good at Starcraft.

746
00:53:11,309 --> 00:53:11,469
Speaker 0: Yeah.

747
00:53:11,509 --> 00:53:13,758
Speaker 0: See I say yeah, you're beating me with your APM's.

748
00:53:13,818 --> 00:53:14,240
Speaker 0: exactly.

749
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:15,606
Speaker 0: That's why you're better than me.

750
00:53:15,827 --> 00:53:17,654
Speaker 0: I just do not feel like doing that.

751
00:53:17,734 --> 00:53:21,169
Speaker 1: I don't call it cheap, but It's not cheap.

752
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,017
Speaker 0: it's hard as hell.

753
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:33,311
Speaker 1: if you Something's easy to do and wins if you move beyond Being a scrub to getting better at games and you take turns faster You will find that you just can't play games with scrubs anymore.

754
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:34,335
Speaker 1: And you know what?

755
00:53:35,057 --> 00:53:35,840
Speaker 1: It's fucking awesome.

756
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:41,589
Speaker 1: You realize when we want to play a board game we sit down 45 minutes later We're done with the game of Puerto Rico star.

757
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,600
Speaker 0: We can play a lot of goddamn games.

758
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,488
Speaker 0: It's so much more fun because you can play.

759
00:53:45,509 --> 00:53:46,895
Speaker 0: you can learn new games quickly.

760
00:53:46,935 --> 00:53:47,497
Speaker 0: You can play.

761
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,408
Speaker 0: exist games You already know much faster.

762
00:53:49,468 --> 00:53:55,736
Speaker 0: modern art takes maybe 40 minutes Maybe maybe and modern art is a good example, right one technique to use.

763
00:53:55,756 --> 00:53:56,840
Speaker 0: we talked about the auction thing.

764
00:53:57,021 --> 00:53:58,386
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, I'll run my auction.

765
00:53:58,406 --> 00:54:01,619
Speaker 1: All right, do I hear $1 going once going twice three top two.

766
00:54:02,203 --> 00:54:05,240
Speaker 1: Alright, I bid three going once going twice or three to five.

767
00:54:07,223 --> 00:54:10,397
Speaker 1: See how I'm forcing Scott to immediately jump on yep.

768
00:54:11,803 --> 00:54:19,890
Speaker 0: But no if someone's having trouble in a complex game where there's a lot of different things Play a game that only has one of those things right.

769
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:28,880
Speaker 0: if people are having trouble with a card draft at the beginning of seasons Just play seven wonders instead so that then once they got the hang of that then you can move up.

770
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:36,345
Speaker 0: you know if someone's having trouble in auctions and power grid play modern art so they can just deal with Auctions only if people don't.

771
00:54:36,445 --> 00:54:48,540
Speaker 0: you know, it's this progression of you know learning curve that people have to go through and it's you know Video games often since you know, especially long ones have this learning curve built in whether they teach you one skill at a time.

772
00:54:48,801 --> 00:54:50,508
Speaker 0: They'll have a level where all you do is jump.

773
00:54:50,568 --> 00:54:55,268
Speaker 0: then in the next level you jump and shoot right jump and shoot Jump and shoot man.

774
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:57,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then in the next level you slide.

775
00:54:57,599 --> 00:54:58,723
Speaker 0: next level You change weapons.

776
00:54:58,743 --> 00:54:59,847
Speaker 0: the next level you fly right.

777
00:55:00,691 --> 00:55:03,140
Speaker 0: if you can't do that with a board game you play a board game.

778
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:04,340
Speaker 0: You got to play the whole thing at once.

779
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,984
Speaker 0: It's not like turn.

780
00:55:05,124 --> 00:55:06,733
Speaker 0: one is easy turn and turn right.

781
00:55:06,814 --> 00:55:07,880
Speaker 0: very few games are like that.

782
00:55:08,161 --> 00:55:17,794
Speaker 1: In fact, if you want to get back to the Garfield book the term he uses for this called bushiness Which is a really nice bushiness was how much I'm getting at is that?

783
00:55:17,854 --> 00:55:21,506
Speaker 1: bushiness is the basically the number of sort of Directions or decisions you could make.

784
00:55:21,726 --> 00:55:26,826
Speaker 1: the first turns of games tend to be the most important and most difficult Mmm, and the decisions.

785
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:30,197
Speaker 1: actually you have fewer decisions as the game goes on after a certain point.

786
00:55:30,478 --> 00:55:30,538
Speaker 0: Mmm.

787
00:55:31,383 --> 00:55:33,239
Speaker 0: But anyway, what you want to do is you want to play?

788
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:40,630
Speaker 0: Simpler games games that have less going on to where you can learn just one thing Right and make those you're starting game.

789
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,976
Speaker 1: I mean we talked a lot about how.

790
00:55:42,016 --> 00:55:42,960
Speaker 1: you know, we don't like settlers.

791
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:43,683
Speaker 1: You know what?

792
00:55:43,743 --> 00:55:46,494
Speaker 1: I love settlers for like two years playing.

793
00:55:46,574 --> 00:55:48,080
Speaker 0: It's someone's brand new to board games.

794
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,380
Speaker 0: Don't just be like, hey, this is the best one is Eclipse.

795
00:55:50,561 --> 00:55:57,070
Speaker 0: It's like the same people do the same shit with anime like hey first Madoka first anime you should watch ever.

796
00:55:57,111 --> 00:55:59,160
Speaker 0: It's like no probably not right.

797
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,380
Speaker 0: You got to watch something that teaches the fundamental parts before you go to hard mode.

798
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:11,030
Speaker 0: I don't you no matter who it is on this earth even incredible genius person Right if they do not have experience with a thing.

799
00:56:11,472 --> 00:56:13,540
Speaker 0: They need to start an easy mode for the thing.

800
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:22,065
Speaker 1: We've played settlers of Catan for several years Regularly and toward the end.

801
00:56:22,105 --> 00:56:25,695
Speaker 0: it teaches you trading and you know territory placement.

802
00:56:25,735 --> 00:56:33,080
Speaker 1: after several years of playing this game We got to a point where we started to suspect that the game was random.

803
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:41,335
Speaker 1: Yeah In fact, we developed these position weird positional heuristics where we realized that whoever got a head first Always lost because they got robbed.

804
00:56:41,496 --> 00:56:41,900
Speaker 1: all fuck.

805
00:56:42,161 --> 00:56:51,275
Speaker 1: so everyone was shooting for second place to then try to have the stealth victory to occlude the positional heuristic and hide the fact that they were actually ahead like hoping.

806
00:56:51,295 --> 00:56:59,660
Speaker 0: people don't realize that I am Two turns away from largest road longest better go for longest road and largest army, so no one sees my victory points.

807
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:02,386
Speaker 0: Right yeah, anyway.

808
00:57:02,988 --> 00:57:03,569
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

809
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,071
Speaker 1: So you know what.

810
00:57:04,533 --> 00:57:06,379
Speaker 0: take your turn or I will hit you.

811
