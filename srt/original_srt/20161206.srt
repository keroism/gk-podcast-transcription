1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,240
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 6th, 2016.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,682
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:13,650
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,438
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,772
Speaker 1: The Jackbox Party Pack 3.

6
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:20,504
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,870
Speaker 1: So last week, on Friday, my life changed.

8
00:00:26,615 --> 00:00:26,848
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

9
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:34,450
Speaker 1: My life changed in a significant way that will impact me for days to come and in fact, impacted me even today.

10
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:35,022
Speaker 1: Mmhmm.

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is true.

12
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:42,870
Speaker 1: So, you know how I annoyingly, like, I don't know, like, a lot of, like, super history about the subway.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,870
Speaker 1: Like, I'm not a deep, deep, like, trained nerd.

14
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,310
Speaker 1: But I know, like, a lot about the operational, like, shit of the New York City subway.

15
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,510
Speaker 0: Well, you know, more than normal person because you're a nerd.

16
00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:01,010
Speaker 0: And a nerd, even though a nerd may specialize in one area, any nerd usually knows more about everything than a non-nerd.

17
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:01,870
Speaker 1: That is true.

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:10,530
Speaker 0: You could go up to, like, if you go to someone who's not a nerd at all or not a geek in any way, shape, or form, it's like they can tell you about, like, that TV show they watch and that's about it.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:19,069
Speaker 0: But if you go to someone who might be, like, a fighting game nerd and you ask them about some anime, and anime is not their main deal.

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,797
Speaker 0: They're not listening to anime podcasts.

21
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:23,290
Speaker 0: They're not, you know, reading anime news network.

22
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,610
Speaker 0: But they've seen some animes because they're in the fighting game community.

23
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,610
Speaker 0: They know more about animes than just a random person on the street.

24
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,467
Speaker 1: Because, like, the new subway that's coming, right?

25
00:01:32,507 --> 00:01:32,628
Speaker 1: The T?

26
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,847
Speaker 1: The only people I know who even today know that it's called the T are...

27
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:39,670
Speaker 0: People who pay attention.

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically all our friends know and, like, no one normal seems to know that even though that has been, like, on subway maps for over a year at this point.

29
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:55,669
Speaker 1: But anyway, like, I know, like, I know a lot about the subway and it's usually more annoying to people than practical because I'll bring it up a lot.

30
00:01:56,212 --> 00:02:00,590
Speaker 1: But something happened that affected me about the subway.

31
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,169
Speaker 1: And while it's something I should have anticipated and known, I did not know it and was surprised by it.

32
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,568
Speaker 1: So, you know how they brought the W back, right?

33
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,128
Speaker 0: Yeah.

34
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,303
Speaker 1: So, normally, what's the difference between the N, Q, R, and W?

35
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,770
Speaker 1: Like, what are they, like, generally, like, what's the differences between them?

36
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:22,910
Speaker 0: So, the R, once it gets to Queens, goes a different way than the N and W.

37
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,690
Speaker 1: Yup, it does come here, but it goes, like, way off to Queens Plaza and then it goes, like, way out into Queens.

38
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,269
Speaker 0: It goes to Eastern Queens.

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,413
Speaker 1: It doesn't go to Scott's.

40
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:35,150
Speaker 1: It's the one that comes, like, when Scott and I are in Manhattan late at night that I can take home, but kind of just fuck Scott.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,570
Speaker 0: Also, once you get downtown to, like, after Canal Street, I think?

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,850
Speaker 1: Yup, Canal Street's the line.

43
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,470
Speaker 0: They all split off into three different ways.

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,029
Speaker 1: Yup, well, there's really only two ways now, but...

45
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,910
Speaker 0: There's one that goes even further downtown and there's one that just goes fuck it and goes to Brooklyn.

46
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,221
Speaker 1: Yup.

47
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:57,190
Speaker 1: So, here's the big thing that I didn't think about, 'cause they brought the W back to make up for the fact that the Q don't go to Queens anymore.

48
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,886
Speaker 1: 'Cause the Q's gonna eventually go up the T to 125th Street.

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,010
Speaker 1: So, when the W came back, what route does the W follow?

50
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:06,376
Speaker 0: The W?

51
00:03:06,598 --> 00:03:07,770
Speaker 0: It's local in Manhattan.

52
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it goes to Astoria up here.

53
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:10,927
Speaker 0: Yup.

54
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:19,130
Speaker 1: But, currently, before the W came back, if I was in here and I want to go to work, 'cause my work is way down by Fulton Street, I pretty much have to transfer.

55
00:03:19,771 --> 00:03:23,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is no direct way to take the subway to my work.

56
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,250
Speaker 1: I either take the 7 or the N or the Q, in the old days, across to either Times Square.

57
00:03:30,612 --> 00:03:33,410
Speaker 1: I guess I could connect to the F and do some bullshit, but that sucks.

58
00:03:33,892 --> 00:03:35,250
Speaker 1: Or I can go to Grand Central.

59
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,477
Speaker 1: And then I take either the 1, 2, 3, or the 4, 5 downtown to my office.

60
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,070
Speaker 0: Pretty sure the N goes all the way downtown.

61
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,369
Speaker 1: No, it never has.

62
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,010
Speaker 1: The N turns to Canal Street and goes off to Fuck All.

63
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,689
Speaker 0: So, the R goes all the way downtown.

64
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,950
Speaker 1: Yup, but the R doesn't stop at Queensborough Plaza.

65
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,270
Speaker 0: It stops at Queens Plaza, which is right there in the same place, basically.

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,769
Speaker 1: No, it takes like 5 minutes to walk there.

67
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,409
Speaker 0: I just walked from the R. It took not 5 minutes.

68
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,490
Speaker 0: It takes almost 5 minutes.

69
00:03:59,810 --> 00:03:59,860
Speaker 1: No.

70
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,530
Speaker 1: Also, the R, if I go to that subway, yes, the R kinda goes direct to my office.

71
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,490
Speaker 1: It's local the whole way, and it doesn't come that often.

72
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:12,110
Speaker 0: Also, the R comes super often.

73
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,810
Speaker 0: In fact, the R is the least crowded subway, even though it's older trains, usually.

74
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,890
Speaker 0: Not always, but usually.

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,570
Speaker 0: It is the least crowded and most luxurious because it is the least crowded.

76
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:24,150
Speaker 1: A lot of the R, yeah, so downtown, the R is like crowded nightmare territory.

77
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:26,170
Speaker 0: Well, it's the least crowded in Queens.

78
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause no one's on it by then, 'cause everyone wants the N.

79
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:29,710
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

80
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,770
Speaker 1: So, but, and also, if I go to Queens Plaza, Queensborough Plaza.

81
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,830
Speaker 0: So, you're saying the W, because the W now is back, it takes you from Queens Plaza, Queensborough Plaza, not Queens Plaza.

82
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,850
Speaker 1: Direct to my office.

83
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,189
Speaker 0: Down where, okay, sure.

84
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:56,070
Speaker 1: So, it stops at Prince Street and City Hall, which, if I just looked at the subway map even once, like, when they said they were bringing the W back, I didn't think about down there, like, 'cause the last time the W existed, I didn't go down there.

85
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,670
Speaker 1: I worked in, like, I worked next to Grand Central.

86
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,050
Speaker 1: I didn't care about those up-down subways on, like, my normal commute.

87
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:10,350
Speaker 1: And going to Queens Plaza is kind of a dicey thing, because if anything happens, like, if the R's down, what, I can take the super fucking local E, like, all the way, and that takes forever.

88
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:11,605
Speaker 1: Or I can wait for an M.

89
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:14,248
Speaker 0: The E is, like, the most express train there is, like, woosh.

90
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,710
Speaker 1: Not if you're going into Manhattan, it stops everywhere.

91
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,230
Speaker 1: It's good if you're going to, like, West 4th Street, or if you're going to, like, the Upper East Side, but otherwise, it's actually not that great.

92
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:26,870
Speaker 1: And it also gets super crowded, like, crazy crowded.

93
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,070
Speaker 0: Well, 'cause it's super express, it goes everywhere.

94
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,674
Speaker 1: Yup.

95
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:30,447
Speaker 1: So...

96
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:31,540
Speaker 0: Even goes to the JFK.

97
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,270
Speaker 1: And it's rare that when the subway, like, updates the map, that it actually affects me directly.

98
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:39,690
Speaker 1: So I'm going, I have to stop at REI to, like, buy some ski boots.

99
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:48,729
Speaker 1: So I go to City Hall Station, which is right next to my office, and I can take the, usually the R stop there, and only the R. But the R will take any N, I think.

100
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,790
Speaker 1: But it would take me to, uh, Prince Street, where the REI is.

101
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,422
Speaker 0: There's a whole lot of talking for a whole lot of nothing.

102
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:55,369
Speaker 0: Also, why are you going to REI?

103
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,061
Speaker 1: That's, like, the best sports store.

104
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:59,610
Speaker 1: Paragon's kind of, like, not great.

105
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,190
Speaker 0: I've heard that, you know, pretty much only lame-os buy sporting goods at department stores.

106
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,630
Speaker 1: Alright, where would you buy ski boots?

107
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,374
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

108
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,170
Speaker 1: Ski boots need to be fitted, like, in person.

109
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:10,830
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

110
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,432
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

111
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:15,789
Speaker 1: There's, buying ski boots on Amazon, or even, like, Zappos or something, would be awful.

112
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:16,669
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

113
00:06:17,051 --> 00:06:18,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, I try to, like, temper.

114
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,170
Speaker 1: Most don't fit me that well.

115
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,949
Speaker 0: The special ski store.

116
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:21,873
Speaker 0: Uh, alright.

117
00:06:22,335 --> 00:06:26,050
Speaker 1: Where are specialized ski stores in New York City?

118
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,618
Speaker 1: Because I've been to almost all of them, and you know what?

119
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:32,430
Speaker 1: They're all way overpriced, and have really shitty selections.

120
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,869
Speaker 0: Uh, they have a shittier selection than REI.

121
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,457
Speaker 1: REI has an excellent selection of ski boots.

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,970
Speaker 1: They also are one of the only places that has good ski services.

123
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,131
Speaker 0: Oh, look.

124
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:45,950
Speaker 0: There is not only a ski shop.

125
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,745
Speaker 1: What, Emilio's?

126
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:47,411
Speaker 0: No.

127
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:55,210
Speaker 0: There is a special ski boot shop called Surefoot that has 4.1 out of 5 star rating on Amazon.

128
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:56,893
Speaker 1: Ooh.

129
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:58,043
Speaker 1: On Amazon.

130
00:06:58,063 --> 00:06:58,810
Speaker 1: So, can I try them all out?

131
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,050
Speaker 0: I meant on Google reviews, you know.

132
00:07:01,298 --> 00:07:01,468
Speaker 1: Yeah.

133
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:05,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is a special ski boot only store.

134
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:06,365
Speaker 1: Also, Scott.

135
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,890
Speaker 0: That looks really fancy, actually.

136
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,669
Speaker 1: I went there.

137
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,530
Speaker 0: These ski boots have, like, hoses coming out of them.

138
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:12,670
Speaker 1: You seem to, like, forget how this works.

139
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:19,850
Speaker 1: I went there, got the experts to explain to me the differences of all these boots, and I tried them all on, and I found the boots I wanted.

140
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:22,970
Speaker 1: Didn't say I bought them there.

141
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:34,910
Speaker 1: Also, I got to take my skis there because I bought my skis online and delivered them to the REI because I'm going to have professionals put my bindings on because I just don't want to deal with that crap.

142
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:37,012
Speaker 1: And, yeah.

143
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:43,610
Speaker 1: So, now I can take the W direct to work, and the W is the most luxurious train because it goes down to Whitehall.

144
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,167
Speaker 1: So, basically, no one gets on it until, like, 34th Street.

145
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:50,184
Speaker 1: So, I can sit down in a whole -- I can lay down on a whole row.

146
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:51,490
Speaker 1: No one will stop me.

147
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,945
Speaker 0: There's almost the same person who would be like, "Ah, fuck them yellow trains.

148
00:07:55,066 --> 00:07:55,347
Speaker 0: Take the

149
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:55,930
Speaker 0: 7.".

150
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,151
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

151
00:07:56,211 --> 00:08:05,470
Speaker 1: If I'm waiting at Queensborough Plaza and a 7 comes first, I'm still taking it because the 7 to the 4-5 is less comfortable but actually still, on average, 4 minutes faster.

152
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,842
Speaker 1: My commute home today took -- exactly all I'm going to take.

153
00:08:09,882 --> 00:08:12,569
Speaker 1: It took 30 -- That's way long.

154
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I go downtown.

155
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:17,146
Speaker 1: The best you can get to downtown, like, the best -- 34 minutes.

156
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:27,208
Speaker 1: The best possible commute to downtown by Fulton Street if every subway is working like clockwork and you get on the trains immediately is 28 minutes.

157
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,069
Speaker 1: That is the best possible case.

158
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:41,870
Speaker 1: And that is if you take the N or any yellow train to 59th Street and then catch a 4 or a 5 downtown and you make the connection and there's no one in your way on that stairwell.

159
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:43,061
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

160
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:45,114
Speaker 1: All right.

161
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:48,005
Speaker 1: You were making a big deal about some opening bit you had.

162
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,110
Speaker 1: that was apparently fascinating.

163
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,007
Speaker 0: I just can't remember it.

164
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,234
Speaker 0: Oh.

165
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:51,375
Speaker 1: Oh.

166
00:08:51,395 --> 00:08:54,670
Speaker 1: I guess a bird in the hand is better than none in the bush.

167
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,890
Speaker 0: No, because a shit in the hand is worse than empty, clean hands.

168
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:04,127
Speaker 1: But I was standing there at Prince Street like, "Well, I guess take the fucking R home because fuck

169
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:04,428
Speaker 1: this.".

170
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:06,334
Speaker 1: And then I see the W coming.

171
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,759
Speaker 1: I'm like, "The W!

172
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,180
Speaker 1: You're back!

173
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,922
Speaker 1: You're my

174
00:09:08,943 --> 00:09:09,043
Speaker 1: buddy!".

175
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,630
Speaker 0: He's been back for a while.

176
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I hadn't been to Prince Street since the W came.

177
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,499
Speaker 1: I mean, how often do you go to Prince Street?

178
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,050
Speaker 1: What's the last time you've been to Prince Street?

179
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,923
Speaker 0: Uh... I went to... I went to something.

180
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:27,650
Speaker 0: What the hell did I go to?

181
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,838
Speaker 1: Was that where you're thinking that it happened?

182
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:29,402
Speaker 1: At Prince Street?

183
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:30,329
Speaker 0: On the W?

184
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,344
Speaker 0: Oh, I went to see, uh...

185
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,090
Speaker 1: Babymetal?

186
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,088
Speaker 0: Miss Hokusai.

187
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:35,110
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

188
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:46,410
Speaker 0: With Judalee when you weren't in town and beforehand, because I had a bunch of time, I went to Prince Street first instead of just getting off at Bleecker and then did some stuff.

189
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, because right there is all the good clothing stores, too.

190
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,589
Speaker 1: It's like a Uniqlo and an H&M and everything right there.

191
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,890
Speaker 0: It's where the fancy clothing... It's a clothing shopping district.

192
00:09:56,592 --> 00:09:56,713
Speaker 1: Yup.

193
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:59,710
Speaker 1: And all the other sports stores are there, too, if you don't want to just go to REI.

194
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,742
Speaker 0: You go for like, "Oh my god,

195
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:01,268
Speaker 0: shopping!".

196
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:02,902
Speaker 0: "Oh my god, designer

197
00:10:02,963 --> 00:10:03,326
Speaker 0: whatever!".

198
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

199
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:07,749
Speaker 1: Well, occasionally I need new pants or whatever, so I'll go over there.

200
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,689
Speaker 1: I actually need some more Uniqlo pants.

201
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,738
Speaker 0: You can't just buy pants.

202
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,270
Speaker 0: You gotta go to the fancy store.

203
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,950
Speaker 1: Well, I really like Uniqlo jeans.

204
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:17,030
Speaker 0: You know, there's like a whole bunch of other Uniqlos that are closer.

205
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,539
Speaker 1: But that Uniqlo is right next to my work!

206
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,049
Speaker 1: I can just like stop there on my way home.

207
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,775
Speaker 0: Prince Street is nowhere near your work.

208
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:23,282
Speaker 0: It's way downtown.

209
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:25,330
Speaker 0: Prince Street is sort of middle-ish.

210
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:31,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I leave work, and I get on the W, and I take it to Prince, buy my shit, get right back on the W, and take it all the way home.

211
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:36,810
Speaker 0: The real problem is that the flagship Uniqlo at like Fifth Avenue and 57...

212
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,869
Speaker 1: It's always so crowded, like...

213
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,729
Speaker 0: No, it's like the biggest, best one.

214
00:10:40,613 --> 00:10:42,130
Speaker 0: But it is now in the no-go zone.

215
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:43,950
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

216
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,550
Speaker 1: The evil dude in his tower.

217
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:47,728
Speaker 0: It's in the no-go zone.

218
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:51,350
Speaker 0: It's right in, you know, Mordor moved in, so it's too close.

219
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,889
Speaker 0: You gotta go to like the 34th Street one now.

220
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,818
Speaker 0: Oh, this isn't Mordor.

221
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,150
Speaker 1: This is like Saruman's tower.

222
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,390
Speaker 1: Like, Saruman's tower is like in the middle of the Shire.

223
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,050
Speaker 1: Like, some fucking hobbit's trying to get his beer.

224
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,069
Speaker 1: It used to be the same place to go, and now you can't go there.

225
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:04,820
Speaker 1: Yup.

226
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:12,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I encountered that not too long ago, because we met Judalee to go to a movie, and they had their car, like, in Manhattan, because it was like late at night.

227
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:17,463
Speaker 1: So they just drove us home, and everything is fine, and we get to Fifth Avenue, and then all at once we go, "Oh, right.

228
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:17,947
Speaker 1: Fuck.".

229
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:19,210
Speaker 1: And then it took us a while.

230
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,048
Speaker 1: Well, we had to go across town, and it was causing traffic problems cross town, because...

231
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:25,167
Speaker 0: This is why I don't use a car.

232
00:11:26,111 --> 00:11:30,150
Speaker 1: But it was there, and getting home from 84th Street's not always the fastest late at night.

233
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:33,090
Speaker 1: Alright, got any news?

234
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,190
Speaker 0: Because I got some follow-up news.

235
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:41,590
Speaker 0: So, it is the 20th anniversary of something you wouldn't think about on a daily basis.

236
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,150
Speaker 1: Windjammers?

237
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:42,737
Speaker 0: No.

238
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,010
Speaker 0: Parappa the Rapper.

239
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:46,496
Speaker 1: Oh, my man.

240
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:48,549
Speaker 1: Crack, crack, crack the eggs into the bowl.

241
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,030
Speaker 1: M-I-X, the flower into the bowl.

242
00:11:52,432 --> 00:11:53,030
Speaker 0: So, anyway.

243
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,288
Speaker 0: So, this game came out 20 years ago.

244
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:01,530
Speaker 0: And there was an anime of it a ways back, right?

245
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:10,549
Speaker 0: But, for the 20th anniversary, it's getting a new fancy re-release on PS4 and maybe other... I think only PS4 probably, but maybe something else.

246
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:15,790
Speaker 0: And, there's also going to be a new Parappa anime also coming out.

247
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:17,269
Speaker 1: Ah, Parappa.

248
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,390
Speaker 0: So, it's Parappa time.

249
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,795
Speaker 0: This game is weird.

250
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:21,360
Speaker 0: It's like 20 years old.

251
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,249
Speaker 0: Like, holy shit, it's old.

252
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,510
Speaker 0: I thought it was dead.

253
00:12:26,773 --> 00:12:28,189
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, you look at modern...

254
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:37,630
Speaker 0: It's like, it's one of those, like, there's so many of these properties, right, that are like... Someone made the property, it maybe even lasted a while and got sequels or something, and then went away.

255
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,614
Speaker 0: But, it still has.

256
00:12:38,835 --> 00:12:41,030
Speaker 0: people still remember it, but it's gone, right?

257
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:41,710
Speaker 0: Yup, yup.

258
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:46,310
Speaker 0: And, some of them, sort of like, have always staying power, right?

259
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,750
Speaker 0: So, something like Voltron, for example, has sort of like this staying power, where it's always around a little bit just to stay alive.

260
00:12:52,831 --> 00:12:54,990
Speaker 0: And, occasionally, gets brought back a bunch.

261
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:55,468
Speaker 0: Yup.

262
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,030
Speaker 0: But, usually, it's just sort of like in the sleep mode, where like maybe a comic book will come out, maybe, just to keep the property rolling.

263
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,349
Speaker 1: Well, like current Sonic the Hedgehog.

264
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,479
Speaker 0: But, Parappa was one of those ones where no one was... I thought it was just 100% dead dead.

265
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:11,068
Speaker 0: Yup.

266
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,270
Speaker 0: Like, there was no new Parappa anything.

267
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,050
Speaker 1: Like, people too much younger than us, I couldn't even reference it because they would have no idea.

268
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,990
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, I thought it was, you know, there's a lot of those that, like, Viewtiful Joe's one, right?

269
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,770
Speaker 0: It's like back in college days, like, there were multiple games and even an anime.

270
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,476
Speaker 0: But, now, as far as I know, it's dead dead.

271
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:33,170
Speaker 0: There is no new Viewtiful Joe anything and is unlikely to be in the near future.

272
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:42,270
Speaker 1: It's also real interesting when you think about the fact that, like, modern rhythm games that aren't dancing games are all basically the exact same game.

273
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,948
Speaker 1: Like, they all just, like, copy, like, they're all just really, in my opinion...

274
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:49,450
Speaker 0: Except for Dub Wars, which is not like those.

275
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a lot of, like, weird indie ones on Steam that do something clever.

276
00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:03,050
Speaker 1: But, Parappa, like, not a bad design for that kind of game, considering how old it is.

277
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,907
Speaker 0: Also one of the first.

278
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:04,409
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:05,567
Speaker 0: 20 years old, right?

280
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:13,949
Speaker 0: So, yeah, if you Parappa'd back in the day and you have a nostalgia for the rapping and the chopping.

281
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:20,170
Speaker 0: And putting your eggs in bowls, now is the time to relive that while you can.

282
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:22,362
Speaker 0: 'Cause I don't know if it'll come back again in a 30, 40, 50 year anniversary.

283
00:14:24,591 --> 00:14:25,869
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's not that big a deal.

284
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:30,468
Speaker 0: And if you never Parappa'd, now is your chance to Rapa Rapa.

285
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:32,948
Speaker 0: So... Because you should.

286
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,370
Speaker 1: Do you remember Dale Brown?

287
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:35,749
Speaker 0: I have no idea what that is.

288
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,102
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he has another name.

289
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:37,889
Speaker 1: He is Hanjo.

290
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:39,408
Speaker 0: Oh, that guy.

291
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:40,128
Speaker 1: He's that guy.

292
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:41,550
Speaker 0: The guy you went on and on about.

293
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:45,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy who was trying to have the lowest possible rank in Overwatch.

294
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:46,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, uh, respectable.

295
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,690
Speaker 1: So he kept that up and he has a whole team, Team Hanjo.

296
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,090
Speaker 1: And, like, they've continued to aspire to be the very worst.

297
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:55,650
Speaker 0: Alright.

298
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,450
Speaker 1: And, like, they treat it professionally.

299
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,190
Speaker 0: Why don't they be the worst in some other games to sort of spread out, you know?

300
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,950
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause they're really specializing in this.

301
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,844
Speaker 1: Because the best part is...

302
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,050
Speaker 0: And you've already hit the worst possible rank.

303
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:06,770
Speaker 0: How much worse can you be?

304
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:09,290
Speaker 1: No, he hit the first possible rank in Season 1.

305
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,929
Speaker 1: And then they substantially changed how the ranking system worked.

306
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,730
Speaker 1: And Season 2, he eventually hit bottom, but it took a long time.

307
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,850
Speaker 1: He set a record.

308
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,690
Speaker 1: He was, 'cause now there's a whole bunch of Korean players who are always racing him to the bottom.

309
00:15:22,057 --> 00:15:23,090
Speaker 1: He beat everybody.

310
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:30,830
Speaker 1: He hit a score of one on the first day of Season 3.

311
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,123
Speaker 0: Whoa.

312
00:15:31,552 --> 00:15:32,621
Speaker 1: He is a pro at this.

313
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,870
Speaker 0: That tells me the ranking system is actually improved.

314
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,190
Speaker 0: If it's downranking him for being so shitty so quickly, it's doing a better job.

315
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,050
Speaker 1: But this article follows up on just, like, the state of that world.

316
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,490
Speaker 1: And apparently, oh, there was such a great quote in here, but they do everything in extremes.

317
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:59,170
Speaker 1: So their goal is not just to lose, but to be as super fucking amazing and great as possible and still lose.

318
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:06,050
Speaker 1: I think they set a record in one game for the most kills in one match any player has ever gotten.

319
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,970
Speaker 0: Oh, because they're playing against people who are so shitty.

320
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,570
Speaker 1: They're playing against people who are so bad that they just saw it by accident.

321
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,490
Speaker 0: So it's easy to get all these kills, but then you just ignore the objective.

322
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,350
Speaker 0: Like, if you played Counter-Strike, well, I guess in Counter-Strike, no one comes back to life.

323
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:23,130
Speaker 0: If it was, I guess, in Quake, only killing matters.

324
00:16:23,491 --> 00:16:39,210
Speaker 0: But if somehow in Counter-Strike you killed everyone on the team except one person, no one on your team died, but you pushed the hostages into the zone and got them rescued even though you're the terrorist and you didn't want them to be rescued.

325
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:47,770
Speaker 1: So he talks a lot about, like, people he's run into and situations that have occurred through these eras.

326
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,370
Speaker 1: Like, they started spawn camping for a while to see if they could do it because it's real hard to spawn camp in this game.

327
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,450
Speaker 1: Like, even a crappy team can bust out of their spawn.

328
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,470
Speaker 0: Well, you're getting reloads in there and shit because it's like a Team Fortress game, right?

329
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,609
Speaker 1: Like, set up a turret in there if you have to.

330
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it's like Team Fortress.

331
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:06,467
Speaker 0: A spawn is like an invincible base you can't touch.

332
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:07,210
Speaker 0: Of course you can get out.

333
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,622
Speaker 1: They found people where they could basically keep them in their spawn forever.

334
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,030
Speaker 1: Like, there's literally no way for them to get out.

335
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,381
Speaker 0: Well, there is a way for them to get out.

336
00:17:14,422 --> 00:17:14,624
Speaker 0: They just...

337
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,490
Speaker 1: No, there's no way for them to get out.

338
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:18,944
Speaker 1: Learn!

339
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:29,050
Speaker 1: He's also talked about running into crazy people who he'll keep running into because that bottom barrel, like, there's this person he keeps talking about as, like, the worst Reinhardt in the world.

340
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:30,982
Speaker 1: But that kid was actually trying to be good.

341
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,189
Speaker 1: Just wasn't.

342
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:33,474
Speaker 1: And how he watched him.

343
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,930
Speaker 1: eventually, like, slowly start to get better.

344
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:43,910
Speaker 1: So, the final quote of this article is a quote because he was asked a bunch of direct questions in the interview.

345
00:17:44,713 --> 00:17:46,727
Speaker 1: "I have no plans of ever stopping

346
00:17:46,787 --> 00:17:46,989
Speaker 1: this.".

347
00:17:47,211 --> 00:17:48,350
Speaker 0: I'm sure he will eventually.

348
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,456
Speaker 0: It'll get un-fun at some point.

349
00:17:50,857 --> 00:17:54,590
Speaker 0: Unless he's one of those obsessive types where, like, he can just focus on it so much.

350
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,710
Speaker 0: In which case, it's kind of sad because we need people like that to focus on something important.

351
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,085
Speaker 0: Imagine if you pointed that amount of effort at something meaningful.

352
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:02,648
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

353
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:12,745
Speaker 0: Not that this is meaningless, but I feel like once you achieve the rank one once, like, you don't need... There's no... Keep doing it over and over doesn't really, you know, add to it, right?

354
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:13,949
Speaker 0: You're better off doing something else now.

355
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:20,730
Speaker 0: If he could lose legendarily at other things, I think he could, like, keep coming back more, you know, as a big deal.

356
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,870
Speaker 0: But by concentrating on the one thing only, it only has so much staying power.

357
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,610
Speaker 1: So, after he hit the bottom, he started doing a different experiment.

358
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:33,250
Speaker 1: He teamed up with that really bad Reinhardt player who I think he described as the worst Reinhardt player ever.

359
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,770
Speaker 1: And tried to team up with him and bring him as high into the ranks as he could.

360
00:18:39,654 --> 00:18:40,790
Speaker 0: Oh, with a different account?

361
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,342
Speaker 1: Same account because he hit bottom.

362
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:43,169
Speaker 1: He doesn't need to stay there.

363
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:43,790
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

364
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:48,090
Speaker 1: So, once he hits bottom, it's like he won and then he spends the rest of the season experimenting.

365
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,650
Speaker 0: Oh, and then the season resets and he tries to go to the bottom again?

366
00:18:51,091 --> 00:18:53,381
Speaker 0: What if he ended one season at the bottom?

367
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,210
Speaker 0: Wouldn't he start the next season at the bottom?

368
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:58,250
Speaker 1: No, he'd do ten placement matches at the beginning of every season.

369
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,010
Speaker 0: So, at every season they reset everything?

370
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:01,614
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

371
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:04,590
Speaker 1: I think they seed you a little bit based on your previous rank.

372
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,230
Speaker 0: Oh, that's really interesting because that actually sounds better.

373
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:13,230
Speaker 0: What Hearthstone does is basically you have to grind to get into the legendary and then it's real ranking.

374
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:19,150
Speaker 0: But then at the beginning of every season, they basically downrank everyone some amount.

375
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,870
Speaker 0: So, if you were a legend at the end of a season, you're now going to start the season at rank five or seven.

376
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:29,710
Speaker 0: But if you ended the season at rank sixteen, you're going to start the next season at rank twenty.

377
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,288
Speaker 0: So, they just downrank everyone and force you to grind your way back in.

378
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:41,350
Speaker 1: So, you'd basically do ten placement matches and all that means is you play in competitive and you don't have a rank.

379
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:46,508
Speaker 1: And after you do the tenth one, it is like based on your performance in those ten, here's your starting rank.

380
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:47,110
Speaker 1: Good luck, have fun.

381
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:51,830
Speaker 0: Oh, so if you significantly improve, all your old games don't matter, only your placement.

382
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:54,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're good, you'll start Platinum.

383
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,150
Speaker 1: If you're bad, you'll start Honjo.

384
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,560
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

385
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,294
Speaker 1: So, I actually also have this issue of Mad Magazine.

386
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:18,120
Speaker 1: In fact, actually, because my mom and dad are both my families going back, we're independently big fans of Mad Magazine.

387
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,418
Speaker 1: I actually have crates and crates and crates of like...

388
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:23,509
Speaker 0: Your mom has crates and crates and crates.

389
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:24,051
Speaker 0: You don't have any.

390
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,860
Speaker 0: You have zero Mad Magazines in this apartment.

391
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,627
Speaker 0: None Mad Magazine.

392
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,820
Speaker 1: Yes, I own a lot of things or have access to a lot of things that are at my mom's giant house.

393
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,216
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, if you're going to have access, like I have access to almost every book ever written.

394
00:20:38,256 --> 00:20:39,180
Speaker 0: I can just go to the library.

395
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,903
Speaker 1: Do you have physical ones?

396
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:48,220
Speaker 1: Because the Mad Collection that we have is actually like the earliest Mads on.

397
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,260
Speaker 1: It might be almost a complete set.

398
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,408
Speaker 0: I'm confident that there is a New York library.

399
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:54,340
Speaker 0: you can go to where they have old magazines they have available.

400
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,284
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it's possible.

401
00:20:55,344 --> 00:20:55,927
Speaker 1: I'll look into it.

402
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:59,040
Speaker 1: But I'm definitely sure I have this one.

403
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:08,800
Speaker 1: And basically, Mad Magazine, making fun of board games, posted... They just had this one article that was the rules to a game.

404
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:12,320
Speaker 1: And I've referenced this game in the past, just kind of offhandedly.

405
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,020
Speaker 1: But I've never really referenced it into detail, but I remember the name and not much else.

406
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,580
Speaker 1: So this brought back a lot of memories.

407
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,779
Speaker 1: The game is called Three Cornered Pitney.

408
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,278
Speaker 0: Alright.

409
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:21,999
Speaker 1: And...

410
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:23,720
Speaker 0: Is it like Calvin Ball, basically?

411
00:21:25,365 --> 00:21:29,559
Speaker 1: It is a game that has very specific rules how to play it.

412
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,360
Speaker 1: And all the rules are here on the internet for your enjoyment.

413
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,340
Speaker 1: And I'm going to add slides with some of these to our panel on writing game rules.

414
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:40,938
Speaker 1: So here's step nine of the game.

415
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:49,640
Speaker 1: Three Cornered Pitney officially begins when the first player rolls the three dice and subtracts the number on one of them from the combined total shown on the other two.

416
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:52,298
Speaker 1: A bunch of examples.

417
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,520
Speaker 0: So if I roll six, one, and two, I can subtract one from eight and get seven.

418
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:01,120
Speaker 0: Or I can subtract two from seven and get five.

419
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,899
Speaker 1: And you keep doing it.

420
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,180
Speaker 0: Or I can subtract six from three and get negative three.

421
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:13,579
Speaker 1: The player whose point total on the die comes closest to the host telephone number must announce this fact by calling out, quote, "I vouchsafed that the opening Vinmert has herewith

422
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:13,780
Speaker 1: elapsed.".

423
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:20,479
Speaker 1: The others realizing it takes only three Vinmerts to make a complete Fenny may respond by either shouting, "I challenge" or "Souls your old

424
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:20,740
Speaker 1: man.".

425
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:21,280
Speaker 0: I challenge.

426
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also challenge.

427
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,840
Speaker 1: So this is, it's like Hall, that role playing game you're not supposed to play in board game form.

428
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:36,098
Speaker 0: All right, so my thing of the day is also related to Parappa the Rappa.

429
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:49,180
Speaker 0: So in honor of the 20th anniversary of Parappa the Rappa in Japan, the land where it seems like magic land for nerds and that is continues to be true to this day.

430
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,979
Speaker 1: Oh man, I want to go to this.

431
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,260
Speaker 0: They opened up a temporary Parappa the Rappa pop up store.

432
00:22:55,421 --> 00:22:58,400
Speaker 0: I do not know in which part of Japan this is.

433
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,328
Speaker 0: I assume Tokyo or what somebody's big.

434
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:02,512
Speaker 0: because otherwise, why would you write?

435
00:23:03,113 --> 00:23:05,280
Speaker 0: and you can see on this guy's Twitter account.

436
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,540
Speaker 0: There's other photos of the other parts of this store.

437
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:18,380
Speaker 0: It's quite elaborate considering what, you know, Parappa the Rappa, but the best part of the store is the dojo, which you can stand in and play Parappa the Rappa.

438
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:28,180
Speaker 0: I assume that's the remake version that he's playing there and the dojo as you play and chop your onions is quite animated.

439
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:34,719
Speaker 0: And if this, you know, the only reason I'm not going to this is because it's in Japan and not in New York.

440
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,240
Speaker 1: So Scott, why is Master Onion so good at rapping?

441
00:23:39,345 --> 00:23:40,320
Speaker 0: Uh, good question.

442
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,260
Speaker 1: Because he's a rapscallion.

443
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,000
Speaker 1: Oh.

444
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:47,859
Speaker 1: Oh, this is great for rap of a man.

445
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,460
Speaker 0: So yeah, uh, reasons to move to Japan plus one.

446
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,000
Speaker 1: In the matter of a moment, the Book Club book is Rebecca.

447
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,000
Speaker 1: I started reading it today because I finished the Mad Adam trilogy, the two following books from Oryx and Craig.

448
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:09,100
Speaker 0: I actually watched a movie recently that was in the same genre-ish, kind of, and that got me in the mood for reading it and I continued reading it.

449
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,529
Speaker 0: I read like two more chapters than I read previously.

450
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:14,100
Speaker 0: I should probably finish it real soon.

451
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,839
Speaker 1: Alright, I'll burn through it pretty quick, I think.

452
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:23,980
Speaker 1: Because now that I have a 28 to 34 minute subway commute that does not involve me having to stand up or transfer trains, I can read a lot more.

453
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:30,300
Speaker 0: The only thing that got in the way is Pokemon started to get in the way, but then Mario Maker 3DS came and pushed that out of the way.

454
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,738
Speaker 1: That's what you were playing when I came home.

455
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm making Marios.

456
00:24:33,268 --> 00:24:34,073
Speaker 0: You're going to see some levels.

457
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:35,020
Speaker 0: I'm going to make you play.

458
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:35,779
Speaker 0: I'll plan.

459
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,139
Speaker 0: I got ideas for some excellent, high quality Marios.

460
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:43,540
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we're going to be at PAX South doing at least one panel on Friday.

461
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,280
Speaker 1: We are going to be at MAGFest doing, between me and Scott, five panels at least.

462
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,379
Speaker 1: Hopefully not more, because that's a lot.

463
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,880
Speaker 1: PAX East will be there, probably, working on those arrangements.

464
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,019
Speaker 1: Stay tuned for all that.

465
00:24:57,565 --> 00:24:59,019
Speaker 1: The Patreon's got a bunch of shit in there.

466
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,679
Speaker 1: Scott's got a bunch of stuff on his YouTube channel, though he hasn't uploaded his cooking show yet.

467
00:25:04,285 --> 00:25:04,938
Speaker 0: It's a lot of work.

468
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:05,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

469
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,059
Speaker 1: YouTube channel's content is a lot of work.

470
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,640
Speaker 0: I got too busy doing other stuff.

471
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,205
Speaker 1: And also, I did pull the trigger.

472
00:25:14,325 --> 00:25:18,160
Speaker 1: I ordered my new gaming PC with the exception of one part that is currently sold out.

473
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,639
Speaker 1: And I'm going to play a bunch of games that I haven't played as soon as I upgrade my PC.

474
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,018
Speaker 0: Well, I'll do it by two weeks from now, so we can talk about it.

475
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,491
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I should be able to order.

476
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:30,758
Speaker 1: The last thing I needed is that M.2 SSD.

477
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,185
Speaker 0: It was on sale.

478
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,780
Speaker 0: Why'd you buy it when it was on sale?

479
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:34,639
Speaker 1: It's still on sale.

480
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:38,740
Speaker 1: When I went to buy the computer before, the 950 was sold out everywhere.

481
00:25:39,601 --> 00:25:42,280
Speaker 1: Unless I wanted the shit-sized 256 gig one, which, no.

482
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,770
Speaker 1: So, then it came back, and it's like 318, 320.

483
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,533
Speaker 1: It's actually cheap.

484
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:50,260
Speaker 0: It's not cheap, but okay.

485
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,640
Speaker 1: Well, for what it is, for a 512 gigabyte, like, ridiculous SSD.

486
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:55,740
Speaker 0: Lightning drive.

487
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:03,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, the first comment when I was looking at it on Newegg was, "Is this storage or is this

488
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:03,979
Speaker 1: RAM?".

489
00:26:06,003 --> 00:26:06,991
Speaker 0: Well, because it looks like RAM.

490
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:07,797
Speaker 0: People don't know what M.2 is.

491
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,913
Speaker 0: That's a good question.

492
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,673
Speaker 1: But the 960 came out, and I thought, you know, the 960 just came out.

493
00:26:17,135 --> 00:26:18,960
Speaker 1: How different could they really be?

494
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's gotta be a minor upgrade, right?

495
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,287
Speaker 1: It is actually a structural upgrade.

496
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,740
Speaker 1: It's like the equivalent of, like, going between Skylake and Kaby Lake.

497
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,940
Speaker 1: Like, it's a big deal, and it's cheaper.

498
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,660
Speaker 0: I thought Skylake and Kaby Lake was not gonna be a big difference.

499
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:38,060
Speaker 1: It is a big difference in some narrow areas, but it's not a big difference in other areas.

500
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,422
Speaker 0: You know what?

501
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:40,312
Speaker 0: There's actually one difference I heard of.

502
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,660
Speaker 0: I don't know if this is true.

503
00:26:42,821 --> 00:26:46,119
Speaker 0: That, you know, Netflix is gonna add support for 4K videos.

504
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,140
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, if you don't have a video card.

505
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,638
Speaker 0: But you need a Kaby Lake to do this, and not a Skylake.

506
00:26:53,658 --> 00:26:54,160
Speaker 0: That's what I heard.

507
00:26:55,441 --> 00:27:00,320
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the truth of that is you need a Kaby Lake and not a Skylake unless you have a real video card.

508
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,662
Speaker 0: I don't know.

509
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:01,610
Speaker 0: I don't know how true that is.

510
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,840
Speaker 0: I didn't see enough details.

511
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:10,340
Speaker 0: That's important info because, like, if I'm buying a new PC, it's like, I just bought a new HDVC just now.

512
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,897
Speaker 1: I don't have any monitor that can display 4K.

513
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:20,120
Speaker 0: No, but I just bought a new HDVC, and if you tell me it can't do 4K Netflix, then I'm not gonna buy a 4K TV.

514
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,260
Speaker 0: But if it can, then maybe I'll buy one in a year or two.

515
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,920
Speaker 0: Because actually, like, in the past month, 4K support has been added to a lot of things.

516
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,239
Speaker 0: People are only adding the 4K support if you have, like, a certain device and not for you just have a PC.

517
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:36,344
Speaker 1: Yup.

518
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:37,980
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

519
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,897
Speaker 0: I assume within a year or two, besides YouTube, which already has 4K support.

520
00:27:42,601 --> 00:27:47,060
Speaker 1: In fact, many Geek Nights panels are uploaded in 4K because you really need to see my pores.

521
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:52,000
Speaker 0: I'll be able to, you know, there'll be 4Ks for everything, and then I can buy a 4K TV without wasting money.

522
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

523
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:59,288
Speaker 1: But the 960 is actually significantly faster and more reliable and cheaper than the 950.

524
00:27:59,288 --> 00:27:59,479
Speaker 1: Wow.

525
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,484
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:03,000
Speaker 1: But it's sold out everywhere.

527
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:05,675
Speaker 1: And the other difference is...

528
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,138
Speaker 0: Just buy two just in case.

529
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:09,293
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not getting the motherboard that has two.

530
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,179
Speaker 1: That was a little bit excessive.

531
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:16,979
Speaker 1: If I'm gonna do that, actually, if I need, like, super fast storage, I could just buy a professional PCIe SSD.

532
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,056
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing you could do is get the motherboard that has two slots, buy the one crazy good 960 M2, and then the other slot...

533
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,347
Speaker 1: Put, like, the 950 EVO 2TB.

534
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,377
Speaker 0: No, there was that super cheap Intel M2.

535
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:29,526
Speaker 0: Oh, forget that!

536
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:30,899
Speaker 1: So, you know how there's the Pro?

537
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:37,100
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's not as good as the other ones, but it's still amazing and it's still so cheap.

538
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:37,923
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no.

539
00:28:38,144 --> 00:28:41,640
Speaker 1: So, right now, Samsung is like the leader in this.

540
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,260
Speaker 0: Well, Samsung has been the king of solid-state storage forever.

541
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:56,940
Speaker 1: There are the Pro versions and the EVO versions, and the only reason you need Pro is if you, like, really care about reliability, because the Pros have a five-year warranty and are way, way more reliable.

542
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,980
Speaker 1: The EVOs, unless you're doing crazy bullshit 4K stuff like I do, the EVOs are effectively just as fast as the Pros.

543
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:14,011
Speaker 1: They cost half, and they're less reliable, they only have a three-year warranty, but you can get, like, a 1TB 960 EVO for, like, 500, 600 bucks next year.

544
00:29:17,647 --> 00:29:18,159
Speaker 0: Oh, next year?

545
00:29:18,363 --> 00:29:18,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

546
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:21,237
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Whoa, I'll buy that right

547
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:21,438
Speaker 0: now!".

548
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,874
Speaker 1: No, they come out January 1st.

549
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:23,840
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

550
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,419
Speaker 1: Like, next year, like, literally next year.

551
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,959
Speaker 0: They already have release dates of these things?

552
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:32,312
Speaker 1: And also, right now, you can buy a 512GB 850, like, regular SATA 6 EVO for, like, 150 bucks.

553
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,628
Speaker 1: In fact, I saw one as cheap as 113, so SSDs are real cheap right now.

554
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,239
Speaker 1: And if you're not going crazy, they're, like, ridiculous cheap.

555
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,440
Speaker 1: But the Samsung ones are clearly superior.

556
00:29:48,261 --> 00:29:51,540
Speaker 1: So, you guys know, we're a big fan of the original Jackbox party packs.

557
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,619
Speaker 0: Well, pretty much just Drawful.

558
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:55,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, Drawful is, like, the good one.

559
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,019
Speaker 1: Fibbage would be good, except it doesn't have enough content in it.

560
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:04,120
Speaker 0: Well, back in the day, right, is, like, when this sort of thing was, like, super rare, you know, the regular ol' -- I think we did an episode on Jackbox already.

561
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,425
Speaker 1: We did.

562
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:04,979
Speaker 1: I'll link to it.

563
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:11,240
Speaker 0: But, yeah, pretty much what we said in that episode, right, is, like, back in the day, those old Jackbox -- you know, it wasn't Jackbox, it was just -- You don't know Jack.

564
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:27,920
Speaker 0: You don't know Jack, and it was a fun party game, but you had to sit around a PC, and everyone had their finger on one letter on the keyboard, and you'd play it like that to buzz in, and it was just trivia, and, you know, it was okay and funny, and it was unique back in those CD-ROM days, but it doesn't hold up that well, even though it's still okay.

565
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:42,880
Speaker 0: The Jackbox, with their revolutionary usage of your phone to connect to the game that's on the screen, you know, is amazing, and that's what makes it so hot, and Jackbox 1 and 2, you know, had some good games and some not good games.

566
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,968
Speaker 1: 2 was not super worth it.

567
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:45,772
Speaker 1: Like, 1 was good.

568
00:30:45,812 --> 00:30:46,697
Speaker 1: Like, 1 had Drawful.

569
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,480
Speaker 0: Well, they're not the cheapest, either, so, you know, right?

570
00:30:49,540 --> 00:31:01,040
Speaker 0: But anyway, but the -- you know, Drawful is pretty much the king of games, and then the trivia ones are okay, but they sort of run out of trivia, and it's also not always the best trivias, and that's about it.

571
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,087
Speaker 0: So, now the Jackbox Party Pack 3.

572
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,617
Speaker 0: So, we're like, "Well, I've got to try that

573
00:31:05,737 --> 00:31:05,898
Speaker 0: out.".

574
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:06,440
Speaker 0: So, we did.

575
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:11,000
Speaker 1: And the winner, like, the chicken dinner of this game is Quiplash.

576
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:12,398
Speaker 0: Uh, sort of.

577
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:17,640
Speaker 1: Well, so, TKO, I don't know how much, like, super -- like, I have a complicated feeling.

578
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,447
Speaker 1: We should just play all together.

579
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:19,620
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the bad one first.

580
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:20,075
Speaker 0: Okay.

581
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,278
Speaker 0: So, trivia murder party -- This game is garbage.

582
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,740
Speaker 1: It's hot garbage.

583
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,683
Speaker 0: It is the worst.

584
00:31:24,703 --> 00:31:25,245
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know.

585
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:31,740
Speaker 0: How did this even pass, like, the fun test that they -- Like, do they really enjoy playing this at the Jackbox office?

586
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,260
Speaker 1: So, 1, it's theme, because they're really doubling down, like, every game having, like, a really specific theme.

587
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:37,738
Speaker 0: That's fine.

588
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:44,720
Speaker 1: But the theme for this one was really sort of, like, a thin veneer, and it was not very, like, well put into what the game was.

589
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:50,638
Speaker 1: And it was just a shitty trivia game, and the theme was, "You were being tortured and murdered by a serial

590
00:31:50,678 --> 00:31:50,959
Speaker 1: killer.".

591
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:51,599
Speaker 0: Yeah.

592
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,760
Speaker 1: Which, I guess, you could go, like, Super Edgelord with it, but they don't.

593
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
Speaker 1: It's, like, lame-o dad jokes with a serial killer, like, twist to them.

594
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,001
Speaker 0: Right.

595
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:04,540
Speaker 0: So, everyone's a little voodoo doll kind of monster thing, right?

596
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, which are moderately cute, almost.

597
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:09,320
Speaker 0: You get a trivia question, and I think it's multiple choice, if I remember correctly?

598
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:09,605
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,680
Speaker 0: And if you get it wrong, then you're dead?

600
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everyone who gets it wrong has to play a minigame.

601
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:17,160
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

602
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,040
Speaker 1: And if they don't, and if they get killed in the minigame, they're dead.

603
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:27,860
Speaker 0: Right, there's a minigame to basically, you know -- and if you win, if you get the trivia question right, you can just avoid the minigame entirely, and you wait while the other people play.

604
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,003
Speaker 1: Yep, and the game goes on.

605
00:32:29,043 --> 00:32:35,260
Speaker 1: Now, the trivia is bad, and pretty much everything about it is bad, but the game goes on until there's only one player left alive.

606
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:45,960
Speaker 1: And then, much like WarioWare for the GameCube with the spaceships, then that player has to do this trivia challenge to get out before the ghosts of all the dead players catch up to them.

607
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,840
Speaker 1: So, basically, either they win, or they get overtaken, and one of the ghosts wins.

608
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:50,899
Speaker 0: I was a ghost, and I won.

609
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,227
Speaker 0: You did.

610
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:55,156
Speaker 1: I wasn't clear on how that part actually worked, playing it.

611
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:10,440
Speaker 0: The reason I won, even though I was a ghost, is because I got enough trivia questions right when I was alive so that I had a head start-ish in the final race, and then I just did better at the final race to make up for the margin between me and the people who were alive.

612
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,180
Speaker 1: Like, the end bit, like the chase, was almost clever enough to be interesting.

613
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,764
Speaker 0: It's also really slow.

614
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:22,151
Speaker 0: It's like you're waiting for shit to happen when you play this.

615
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:30,100
Speaker 1: Like, way more than the other games, and way less funny than even the latest.

616
00:33:30,402 --> 00:33:32,220
Speaker 0: So, don't play Trivia Murder Party.

617
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,178
Speaker 1: Like, don't even play it.

618
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:33,476
Speaker 0: Okay.

619
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:39,100
Speaker 1: Faking it is the second crappiest one.

620
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:45,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, this game, I guess, had a good idea, a good concept, but a bad execution where it didn't actually work out.

621
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, the idea is that everyone's playing the game earnestly, and one person is the faker.

622
00:33:52,381 --> 00:33:59,639
Speaker 1: So, it'll be like, it'll show on everyone's phone except one person, "Raise your hand if you've masturbated in the last 48

623
00:33:59,639 --> 00:33:59,799
Speaker 1: hours.".

624
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:00,861
Speaker 0: Right.

625
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:06,480
Speaker 0: So, then it goes, "One, two, three, go," and one person doesn't even know, you know, what they should be doing.

626
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,999
Speaker 1: It just tells them, like, you're the faker.

627
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:09,139
Speaker 0: It tells them nothing.

628
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,199
Speaker 1: And then, suddenly, like, three of your friends raise their hands and two of them don't, and you have to decide how to fake it so they don't realize you're the faker.

629
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,489
Speaker 0: If you're not the faker, you're trying to figure out who is.

630
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:23,080
Speaker 0: It's like, did someone raise their hand just because they were trying to follow everyone else?

631
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,580
Speaker 0: Or is there somebody who just, they're either the faker because they didn't raise their hand and they don't know what the hell's going on?

632
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,398
Speaker 1: This is an excellent concept for a game that was implemented so badly.

633
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:34,820
Speaker 1: it's unplayable.

634
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:41,500
Speaker 0: Because you're trying to look at the screen and your own phone, but you're also trying to look at the other people in the room, and there's no way for that to physically work.

635
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,371
Speaker 1: I think that could work.

636
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,219
Speaker 0: The problem- That is one problem, though.

637
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,141
Speaker 1: Here's the real problem.

638
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:53,637
Speaker 1: It wasn't super clear how, like, the game didn't, like, the other games kind of go overboard telling you way too much info about how they work, or are designed to where.

639
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:55,139
Speaker 1: if you don't know how they work, it's fine.

640
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,860
Speaker 1: This one didn't tell you enough and required you to do the things that you didn't really understand.

641
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:14,359
Speaker 0: The other thing is I felt like, I couldn't tell what was going on necessarily, but it felt like even though the faker didn't know why they should be doing a thing, I feel like it still told them, "Alright, this is a hand-raising

642
00:35:14,439 --> 00:35:14,840
Speaker 0: round.".

643
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,306
Speaker 1: It did.

644
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:16,260
Speaker 1: That was the problem.

645
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:21,530
Speaker 0: Like, it shouldn't tell them it's a hand-raising round or a clapping round or a jumping round or whatever.

646
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,200
Speaker 0: It should tell them absolutely nothing and all of the information should be private on your phone.

647
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:31,126
Speaker 0: So all the other players get a directive, like- This is a game that doesn't need the central screen at all.

648
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:35,196
Speaker 0: It should only use phones and then say, "One, two, three, everyone look up.

649
00:35:35,456 --> 00:35:36,699
Speaker 0: One, two, three, everyone do the

650
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:36,980
Speaker 0: thing.".

651
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,655
Speaker 0: And then the faker doesn't even know what the thing is.

652
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:42,000
Speaker 0: That's how it should go down.

653
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,930
Speaker 1: Imagine if it was suddenly, like, it just says, "Everyone wearing glasses, take them off right

654
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:46,331
Speaker 1: now.".

655
00:35:46,852 --> 00:35:54,340
Speaker 0: Like, that would be an amazing game, but this game is- This could be done as a board game with cards that you hand out and people look at in some way.

656
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:01,838
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny you say that because the next day after we played it, I was kind of sketching out, like, how I would redesign this game and I realized the same thing.

657
00:36:01,878 --> 00:36:09,800
Speaker 0: This game could be- Whereas trivia murder party is just bad trivia, faking it is a good concept that doesn't work so you don't need to actually play it.

658
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:10,198
Speaker 0: Alright.

659
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,760
Speaker 0: So, so far we're 0 for 2.

660
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,100
Speaker 1: Gaspionage is actually pretty fun, but I feel like it has the same problem that Fibbage does in that it'll run out of content.

661
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:31,976
Speaker 0: Right, so there's definitely limited content, but this is fun to play a few times and the way it works is they're like, "Okay, what percentage of people have, you know, something, right?

662
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:35,239
Speaker 0: I don't know, have never seen the ocean, right?

663
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:35,880
Speaker 0: I just made that

664
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Speaker 0: up.".

665
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:41,895
Speaker 0: And then one person who's, like, whose turn it is will guess- Publicly.

666
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:48,573
Speaker 0: Publicly on this pie chart what percentage of people they think have never seen the ocean according to Family Feud survey says, right?

667
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:51,639
Speaker 0: They'll be like, "Okay, 25% of people on Earth have never seen the

668
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:51,899
Speaker 0: ocean.".

669
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,140
Speaker 0: Then everyone else says whether that's too high, too low- Way too high.

670
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,444
Speaker 0: Way too high or way too low and whoever's right gets points.

671
00:37:01,945 --> 00:37:17,260
Speaker 0: and if you basically saying way high or way low is doubling down, so if you're wrong when you go way high or way low, you lose stuff, but if you're right when you go way high or way low, you get stuff, so sort of like double or lose, you know, it's bad news or good or great news.

672
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:21,039
Speaker 0: And then that's pretty much what the game is about, that one thing.

673
00:37:21,502 --> 00:37:23,654
Speaker 1: Yep, but it actually, like, it works pretty well.

674
00:37:23,895 --> 00:37:24,680
Speaker 1: It's moderately fun.

675
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,984
Speaker 0: It's interesting, you know, questions because it's not just, like, a trivia, like, "Do you know this or

676
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:29,264
Speaker 0: not?".

677
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:44,139
Speaker 0: It's, like, it's a percentage, so it's a lot like that Wits and Wagers board game, right, where you're sort of betting, like, the trivia question will be a number as the answer and you'll be betting on whether you, you know, what range you think the number is in.

678
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:44,940
Speaker 0: It's a lot like that.

679
00:37:45,481 --> 00:37:53,339
Speaker 0: It's also got a pretty good theme, like, I like how a lot of these- I feel like Wits and Wagers would be a good game to have just in-jackbox technology, period, yeah.

680
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,919
Speaker 1: So, Quiplash is probably going to be the drawful of this.

681
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, Quiplash is- there is a- the final game is actually a drawing game.

682
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:09,300
Speaker 0: Quiplash isn't a drawing game, but it's the best game in the pack.

683
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,080
Speaker 1: Because the final game is great, but that's a very qualified great.

684
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:13,497
Speaker 0: Right.

685
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,212
Speaker 1: So, Quiplash basically has you- everyone has to answer, like, two little things.

686
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,399
Speaker 1: Like, it'll give you a prompt, like, "A bumper sticker a nudist would

687
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:22,680
Speaker 1: have.".

688
00:38:22,929 --> 00:38:23,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

689
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,879
Speaker 1: And you come up with something funny.

690
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, so mine was, like, the name of a high-end cat salon, and I wrote, "Per

691
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:32,220
Speaker 0: Snips.".

692
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:32,717
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,119
Speaker 0: And I got- so that was a great answer.

694
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,274
Speaker 1: Mine- the one that got the most laughs for me was, "I missed my own wedding because,".

695
00:38:40,294 --> 00:38:41,758
Speaker 1: and I wrote, "I was at

696
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,059
Speaker 1: PAX.".

697
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:42,591
Speaker 0: Yeah.

698
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:58,040
Speaker 0: But yeah, you basically, you know, there's these prompts, you answer them, and then- Right, so even though there's eight people, everyone gets two prompts each, right?

699
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:05,160
Speaker 0: But there's still only a total of eight prompts because each prompt was given to two different players, at least, right?

700
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,000
Speaker 0: So that way it shows your prompt versus the other person who got the same prompt, and then people vote on whose is better.

701
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:17,580
Speaker 0: And if you want to get more votes because you- you made the- you basically gave a better, funnier response to the prompt than they did.

702
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,900
Speaker 1: Now, I say it's the drawful because it's the quick jump in and play game.

703
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,880
Speaker 0: And it's not trivia, it's a creative- you know, it's what drawful is, it's a creative competition kind of thing, right?

704
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,081
Speaker 1: Yep.

705
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:32,720
Speaker 1: It does not rely on anything other than those questions, those prompts, so you're not going to run out of trivia.

706
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:38,420
Speaker 1: Like, Fibbage, I've seen the same questions so many times that I pretty much always win if I play Fibbage with strangers.

707
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,700
Speaker 0: The only problem with Quiplash that I had, though other people didn't have it as much as I did, was time.

708
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:47,659
Speaker 0: I did not have enough time- I felt like- You gotta move quick!

709
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,840
Speaker 0: If I had another minute, I could have come up with, like, two incredible prompt answers.

710
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,060
Speaker 0: But, like, persnips took me all my entire time to think up.

711
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:56,920
Speaker 0: It was really good.

712
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:04,660
Speaker 0: And then I had, like, five seconds and I had to push the automatic "put an answer in for me" button because I ran- I was gonna just put in nothing otherwise.

713
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,149
Speaker 0: Yep.

714
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,043
Speaker 0: And I didn't like that.

715
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,273
Speaker 0: I wanted to have, like, a lot of time to think about it and come up with something.

716
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,240
Speaker 0: so spice for both prompts.

717
00:40:11,781 --> 00:40:18,780
Speaker 0: I feel like it could also do better by just having everyone do one prompt and then after four rounds, do another prompt.

718
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:24,160
Speaker 0: Oh, so then you can react to- Right, because you're given one allotment of time to do both prompts.

719
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,627
Speaker 1: That's good, though.

720
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:25,360
Speaker 1: You gotta think on your feet.

721
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,160
Speaker 0: I wanted to have enough time to do each one separately.

722
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:32,800
Speaker 1: It's also got the cutest sort of style and theme, like the little avatars are just good.

723
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,491
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, the visual design of this one is more fun.

724
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:37,260
Speaker 0: It's just cute little eyeball shapes.

725
00:40:37,642 --> 00:40:37,776
Speaker 1: Yep.

726
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:41,288
Speaker 1: So it's the one that's gonna get the most play, like, at conventions.

727
00:40:41,328 --> 00:40:45,100
Speaker 1: Like, if you look at- 'cause PAXes tend to have Jackbox games, like, out in the open everywhere.

728
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,580
Speaker 1: It's usually Quiplash these days.

729
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,200
Speaker 0: The other thing is, I gotta say, good or bad, all the games in this pack mostly support a ton of players.

730
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,712
Speaker 0: In the other PAX, there were some games that only supported, like, four players.

731
00:40:57,093 --> 00:40:59,060
Speaker 0: I think most of the ones in this pack support eight.

732
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,240
Speaker 1: Only faking it goes up to six.

733
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:03,240
Speaker 0: I guess that'd be hard to play with too many people.

734
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

735
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:06,440
Speaker 1: I think, actually, it'd be better with more people.

736
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:06,923
Speaker 1: Maybe.

737
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:07,427
Speaker 0: Yeah.

738
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:09,300
Speaker 0: But you'd need more rounds to narrow it down.

739
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,060
Speaker 1: Yeah.

740
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:12,166
Speaker 1: Maybe we should just design the board game version.

741
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:13,992
Speaker 1: That's way easier- that kind of game?

742
00:41:14,393 --> 00:41:16,740
Speaker 1: Way easier to design than the stuff you're working on right now.

743
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,160
Speaker 0: Sure.

744
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,829
Speaker 0: So, the final game.

745
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:23,540
Speaker 0: And this game is sort of, like, the best game, but not the best game?

746
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,850
Speaker 1: It's the craziest game.

747
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,100
Speaker 1: Like, it's an experience.

748
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:26,720
Speaker 0: Right.

749
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:30,620
Speaker 0: So it's sort of, like, a high investment thing, 'cause it takes a while and takes a lot of effort.

750
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:38,280
Speaker 0: But the payoff was, like- like, so the game basically- But we couldn't do it again, 'cause it was such an involved game.

751
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, we didn't know- we didn't even know what was going on.

752
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,114
Speaker 0: It's like you can't play "Axis and Allies" twice, 'cause even if it's so great, 'cause it's such a big deal.

753
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:47,040
Speaker 0: Not that "Axis and Allies" is great, but just, you know.

754
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,925
Speaker 1: So all the other games kind of, like, really tell you- well, except for faking it, which sucks, like, really tell you- They explain the game before you play.

755
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:58,700
Speaker 0: This game, you turn it on, and it just has you start playing before you even know what you're supposed to be doing.

756
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,965
Speaker 0: It's like- it says, "Draw something.

757
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:01,794
Speaker 1: Draw as many things as you can.

758
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:02,517
Speaker 1: They can be

759
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:02,979
Speaker 1: anything.".

760
00:42:03,302 --> 00:42:03,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like,

761
00:42:04,031 --> 00:42:04,516
Speaker 0: "Whoa!"

762
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:10,360
Speaker 0: And even worse- It gives you more drawing tools than the Drawful does.

763
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:13,866
Speaker 0: You actually- Colors, erasers- Colors, erasing different tools.

764
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:17,718
Speaker 0: It's like a real paint tool, and it makes you draw a bunch of stuff, and you're like, "Oh,

765
00:42:17,778 --> 00:42:18,019
Speaker 0: fuck.".

766
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,207
Speaker 1: And the art and the style and the theme is, like, crazy.

767
00:42:22,247 --> 00:42:29,380
Speaker 1: It's basically like a- like a Japanese fighting game crossed with a Jap- like a- like a Battle Balls puzzle kind of game.

768
00:42:29,601 --> 00:42:34,120
Speaker 0: Well, it has, um, you know, what are the names of the Japanese spirit monsters?

769
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,969
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you can be, like, a Tengu or, yeah, all these- The Umbrella Guy.

770
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,120
Speaker 0: What the hell are the names of those?

771
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,347
Speaker 0: I don't remember all of them.

772
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:44,177
Speaker 1: I get to see the list of all of them.

773
00:42:44,197 --> 00:42:44,720
Speaker 1: I don't have it up.

774
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,718
Speaker 0: You know, the things that Kitaro deals with.

775
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,280
Speaker 1: Oh, monsters?

776
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,705
Speaker 0: No, there's a name for it.

777
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:52,960
Speaker 0: That's a Japanese word that I know, but I just can't remember right now.

778
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:53,571
Speaker 1: Akemono?

779
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:55,970
Speaker 0: No, that's just the generic word for monster.

780
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,019
Speaker 0: There's a specific word for these coded monsters.

781
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:06,560
Speaker 0: Yes, that's- you basically- all your characters are yokais, and the styling is very, like, woodblock kaiju kind of styling.

782
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also, like, versus puzzle game and versus fighting game.

783
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a crazy awesome style.

784
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:15,417
Speaker 0: Whoever did the art on this game is the best art of all the games.

785
00:43:15,457 --> 00:43:16,380
Speaker 0: You did a great job.

786
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,708
Speaker 1: But, like, we didn't know what was going on, and the game was just like, "Fuckin' do this now.

787
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:21,794
Speaker 1: Write as many slogans as you can in a hurry.

788
00:43:21,834 --> 00:43:22,255
Speaker 1: Go, go, go.

789
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:22,777
Speaker 1: Puff, puff, puff.

790
00:43:22,937 --> 00:43:23,639
Speaker 1: Here's the interlude.

791
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:23,799
Speaker 1: Blah,

792
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,000
Speaker 1: blah.".

793
00:43:24,462 --> 00:43:34,460
Speaker 0: And then at the end, it kind of all comes together, and basically- It's like it didn't need to tell you what the game was until it got there, which is a great design, actually.

794
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm actually legit impressed.

795
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,040
Speaker 1: So

796
00:43:36,161 --> 00:44:03,500
Speaker 0: it makes you draw a bunch of pictures for whatever, then it makes you write a bunch of slogans that could go on a t-shirt, okay, and then each player on their screen gets a choice of, like, a few of the pictures that have been drawn by other people, and a few of the slogans that have been written by other people, and you choose a combination of one picture and one slogan to make the best t-shirt you can make amongst all the just raw materials that were just generated, right?

797
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:08,677
Speaker 0: You combine and make one t-shirt from all the things your friends just made, and then you vote.

798
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:18,355
Speaker 0: It puts two t-shirts together, and there's a tournament of t-shirts as to which one is the champion, and it's pretty much just like, "All right, t-shirt one, t-shirt two, go,".

799
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:21,400
Speaker 0: and then it's not a bracketed tournament.

800
00:44:21,761 --> 00:44:29,820
Speaker 0: It's an all-kill tournament, where if you win, you fight the next, you know, challenger, and the first challenger is dead, right?

801
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,632
Speaker 0: And then whoever wins that keeps going.

802
00:44:31,652 --> 00:44:32,900
Speaker 0: Whoever wins that keeps going.

803
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,814
Speaker 1: Now, the actual end result playing this game was kind of off the hook.

804
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,560
Speaker 1: Like, it was legit hilarious.

805
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:47,220
Speaker 0: Right, and somehow we've just made a bunch of random shit and wrote random slogans, and it made epic t-shirts of epicness.

806
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,220
Speaker 1: I mean, like, one of my favorite ones was just this, like, giant lightning bolt in the sky, like, just fucking killing the stick figure, dude.

807
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:58,340
Speaker 1: And on the bottom, it's just, "I'm sorry for your loss," and something about that just really clicked with me.

808
00:44:58,762 --> 00:44:59,949
Speaker 0: It was just so good.

809
00:45:00,673 --> 00:45:01,899
Speaker 0: Everything about this is so good.

810
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:07,034
Speaker 1: So, basically, there are two good games in here.

811
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:08,540
Speaker 1: One of them is, like, this deep experience.

812
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,677
Speaker 0: Also, because it's on Steam, you can take screenshots, which we did.

813
00:45:12,381 --> 00:45:13,552
Speaker 1: I took a lot of screenshots.

814
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:14,360
Speaker 1: I'll post them in the thread.

815
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,935
Speaker 0: Make sure you have, when you play the t-shirt one, your keyboard handy to push.

816
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,119
Speaker 0: I forget if it's F11 or F12.

817
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,578
Speaker 1: Because otherwise they're gone forever.

818
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,399
Speaker 0: The Steam screenshot button.

819
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,500
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen things you people wouldn't believe playing this game.

820
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:37,640
Speaker 1: So, the only other really unique thing, I mean, if you need a party game, like, this is the kind of game not everyone in your friend group needs to buy, one of you needs to own it.

821
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:42,260
Speaker 0: Right, I would recommend buying this if, A, you already have the other party pack with Drawful in it.

822
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:48,276
Speaker 0: B, you already play Drawful a bunch, but you're looking for something fresh, and you play this kind of thing often.

823
00:45:48,296 --> 00:45:49,620
Speaker 0: You have a lot of people over often.

824
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:51,785
Speaker 0: C, it's on sale.

825
00:45:51,825 --> 00:45:52,769
Speaker 0: It's a bit expensive.

826
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:55,540
Speaker 0: considering some of the games are just so bad you're never going to play them.

827
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,540
Speaker 0: Like, you're paying for trivia murder party whether you play it or not, so wait for a sale.

828
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,050
Speaker 0: Because the regular retail price, I think it's like $25 or $35.

829
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:02,512
Speaker 0: It's a little bit.

830
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I'm paying for SATA Express on my new computer.

831
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:08,740
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm going to use that nonsense.

832
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:14,060
Speaker 0: Right, but, you know, I'm just saying, don't spend full price unless this is your number one deal.

833
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:25,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, if you're the kind of person who runs- If it's on sale, and you already play Drawful a bunch, and you want to play something different a bunch, definitely get Jackbox Party Pack 3 because there's still nothing else out there like it.

834
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:31,091
Speaker 0: And TKO, and, uh, Quiplash 2, actually, are going to be totally worth it.

835
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:40,916
Speaker 0: And Gaspionage, you can play once in a while, you know, just to mix things up.

836
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,040
Speaker 0: Ignore the other games.

837
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't- you might think, "How bad could the trivia murder party

838
00:46:44,854 --> 00:46:44,995
Speaker 1: be?".

839
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:45,820
Speaker 1: It is not great.

840
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:51,240
Speaker 0: But listen, two and a half amazing games for that kind of price, if you play it enough, that's good.

841
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,508
Speaker 1: So, the- I mean, like, if you run- here's a perfect use case for these games.

842
00:46:56,069 --> 00:47:01,220
Speaker 1: If you host parties in hotel rooms at conventions, you put this on in the corner.

843
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:07,428
Speaker 0: If you are a convention or a club, like, imagine if, like, at the Anime Club back in the day- It would have just been in the club space.

844
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:09,440
Speaker 1: It would have been more popular than the anime.

845
00:47:09,741 --> 00:47:10,260
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

846
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:19,600
Speaker 1: So, this pack also does something interesting in that it is directly designed to be used as live streams on the internet.

847
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:27,580
Speaker 1: You can have up to 10,000 spectators who can sort of interact with the game, like, vote on good responses and kind of mess around.

848
00:47:27,702 --> 00:47:28,560
Speaker 0: Oh, we should try to do that.

849
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:29,044
Speaker 0: We should.

850
00:47:29,286 --> 00:47:30,620
Speaker 1: We should live stream playing this game.

851
00:47:30,845 --> 00:47:31,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's do that.

852
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically we can invite, like, some other- because if we're showing the screen, we don't need to be in the same room.

853
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
Speaker 0: Can we do it to YouTube or Twitch only?

854
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:42,100
Speaker 0: Uh, we all- Since it's integrated, right, we might not be able to make it go to YouTube?

855
00:47:42,602 --> 00:47:43,860
Speaker 1: Uh, I think we can make it go to YouTube.

856
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:44,361
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

857
00:47:44,402 --> 00:47:46,169
Speaker 0: But otherwise, we'll set up a Twitch.

858
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:48,860
Speaker 0: Other people, like you listeners, will watch on Twitch.

859
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,039
Speaker 1: I'll tweet, like, the code.

860
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,248
Speaker 0: We'll have eight people at our New Year's party.

861
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,554
Speaker 0: We'll all be playing.

862
00:47:53,574 --> 00:47:55,120
Speaker 0: I'll set the party we'll be playing.

863
00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:00,380
Speaker 0: But all you at home who are sad on New Year's and lonely with nothing better to do than go on Twitch will watch.

864
00:48:00,642 --> 00:48:02,740
Speaker 1: Yup, we can even point a webcam into, like, a fancy stream.

865
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,480
Speaker 0: And you will vicariously enjoy how funny we are and how good at TKO we are, or bad.

866
00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:11,019
Speaker 0: Uh, and that'll be that.

867
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,350
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

868
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:24,470
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

871
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:37,550
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

872
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,086
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

873
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,370
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

874
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,510
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

875
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:50,959
Speaker 1: And the Patreon patrons that order the minor winner of the game with us on a continuing basis are... And Chris Hahn, Rymer, and Thomas And... Literally right after I read all those names, some packages arrived and I got the phone call and I went down and brought them up here.

876
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,760
Speaker 1: The case and the Kraken for my new computer arrived.

877
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,760
Speaker 1: Don't worry, this is my money, not Patreon money.

878
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,700
Speaker 1: All the money that you patrons have donated to Geek Nights are still in a holding queue.

879
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,060
Speaker 1: You will know when we do awesome things with it.

880
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,960
Speaker 1: We're not just, like, putting it into our income.

881
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:15,140
Speaker 1: It'll be used for specific things that will enhance the Geek Nights experience for all of you out there when the time is right.

882
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,436
Speaker 1: And as Wesley Snipes said, "When it's time, you'll

883
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:18,677
Speaker 1: know.".

884
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:22,820
Speaker 1: But you might have noticed I haven't been doing a lot of YouTube videos lately.

885
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:29,680
Speaker 1: That's partly because I'm waiting for the new computer and then I'm going to explode onto the YouTube scene in ways that you have never seen before.

886
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:33,998
Speaker 1: But anyway, at this time, in this place, I leave you with...

887
00:50:34,441 --> 00:50:36,679
Speaker 0: Every single day, stress comes in every way.

888
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,759
Speaker 0: I ain't got no time for nobody.

889
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,339
Speaker 1: My style is rich, dope, fat, and rich.

890
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:43,638
Speaker 1: We'll make a cake today that looks rich.

891
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,999
Speaker 1: Crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

892
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,399
Speaker 1: Crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

893
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:50,839
Speaker 1: M-I-X the flour into the bowl.

894
00:50:51,502 --> 00:50:53,220
Speaker 1: M-I-X the flour into the bowl.

895
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,638
Speaker 0: Crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

896
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,039
Speaker 0: Crack, crack, crack the egg into the bowl.

897
00:50:58,561 --> 00:51:00,519
Speaker 1: M-I-X the flour into the bowl.

898
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:02,819
Speaker 1: M-I-X the flour into the bowl.

899
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:05,280
Speaker 0: Baking a cake, yes, means you gotta try.

900
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,598
Speaker 0: I'm doing this for years, but don't ask me why.

901
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,778
Speaker 1: Butter, butter, butter joins the bowl.

902
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,179
Speaker 1: Butter, butter, butter joins the bowl.

903
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,436
Speaker 1: We're making us a cake that you've never... Hi-ya!

Speaker 0: Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.

Speaker 1: If you wanna test me, I'm sure you're finding the things I'll teach ya.
