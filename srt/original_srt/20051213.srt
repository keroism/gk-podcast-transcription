1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,280
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, December 13th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:16,990
Speaker 0: Tonight, we talk about Loiterer, Nanostray, and more.

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,788
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,149
Speaker 0: Man, today was a painful day at work.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:30,410
Speaker 1: My day was pretty much the same boring day as the other day's, only, um... It was a little slower than yesterday.

6
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:38,290
Speaker 0: See, my day would have been just boring, but it was actually painful because I had to go to a large meeting and I learned something profound and scary.

7
00:00:39,312 --> 00:00:41,550
Speaker 1: Well, meetings tend to be scary, so I don't go to them.

8
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,663
Speaker 0: Well, this was a special meeting.

9
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:49,426
Speaker 0: Now, first off, I can't talk about the specific details because it was a confidential meeting and I generally can't talk about a lot of the things I do at work.

10
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,530
Speaker 0: But, and I can't talk about who was involved or who gave this meeting or whatever, but I think I can get away with talking about what I'm about to talk about.

11
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:58,752
Speaker 0: All right.

12
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,836
Speaker 0: So I went to this meeting.

13
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:03,730
Speaker 0: It was like this division-wide meeting, so a lot of people were there.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,949
Speaker 0: There's a major meeting, more of a presentation than meeting, where someone was going to present us a whole bunch of important information about IVF.

15
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,392
Speaker 0: Alright, cool.

16
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,418
Speaker 0: I get the morning off to go to this meeting.

17
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:14,382
Speaker 0: They give us lunch afterward.

18
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:22,850
Speaker 0: So I show up and the people giving the presentation are pretty much walking into the room right before I am, and I'm about two minutes early.

19
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:27,190
Speaker 0: They walk to the front of the room and they're ready to go and, oh!

20
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:29,070
Speaker 0: None of the equipment in the room's working!

21
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,290
Speaker 1: I've never seen that happen before.

22
00:01:31,572 --> 00:01:31,658
Speaker 0: Yeah.

23
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:45,870
Speaker 0: And instead of just immediately dealing with the situation, they just kind of stood there, twirled their thumbs, looked at each other a lot, and after a significant time, decided to do the meeting without any of the equipment.

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,849
Speaker 1: When did they call ETC?

25
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:49,228
Speaker 0: Because it wasn't RIT.

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,964
Speaker 1: Don't they have an ITC/ETC equivalent?

27
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:53,457
Speaker 0: I don't know.

28
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:55,069
Speaker 0: I've never had to coordinate a room.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:55,779
Speaker 0: All right.

30
00:01:56,311 --> 00:02:04,450
Speaker 0: All I know is that they did not... It was one of the most unprofessional and painful-to-watch things I have ever seen, and that includes classes.

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,289
Speaker 0: I've had people do presentations at Ed in RIT.

32
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, usually when that happens, like when it happened at RIT, I would laugh at it for like a minute.

33
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,810
Speaker 1: You know, maybe I'd yell out some advice or something if I felt like it, but I wouldn't actually get up and fix it unless it got really bad.

34
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,561
Speaker 1: Then I would just get up and fix it with like, "Doot!

35
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:20,823
Speaker 1: There it

36
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:20,944
Speaker 1: is!".

37
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:24,077
Speaker 0: Now the fact that a meeting went like.

38
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:25,782
Speaker 0: that isn't really the point of this.

39
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,190
Speaker 0: The point is that these were professionals.

40
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:34,470
Speaker 0: These are professional business people who are paid a lot of money to do their business thing and to act as professional-type people.

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:42,010
Speaker 0: And they did this in the most unprofessional, just cockamamie... It was just... It was painful to watch.

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:53,490
Speaker 0: And I'm not exaggerating when I say that I personally, and other people I've known who ran a freaking club in college, handled our club in a more professional manner than this meeting was conducted.

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,729
Speaker 1: It's pretty sad.

44
00:02:55,333 --> 00:03:02,162
Speaker 0: I mean, we would get to the room if we were doing a presentation, I don't know, half hour, hour early, check out the room, make sure it worked.

45
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:04,189
Speaker 0: If it didn't work, we called someone to fix it.

46
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:15,070
Speaker 0: If there was an emergency, you know, a microphone didn't work, we handled it in a professional manner and got it resolved as quickly as possible without... And we always had it appear smooth.

47
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,570
Speaker 0: We didn't just stand at the front of the room twiddling our thumbs.

48
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:24,128
Speaker 0: And it bothers me, because we had a lot of... Every class we had at RIT, they made us do presentations in groups in front of the class.

49
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:27,670
Speaker 0: And they always impressed upon us that you have to be professional in the real world.

50
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,644
Speaker 0: Classes may not seem, but we're training you for the real world.

51
00:03:30,905 --> 00:03:31,810
Speaker 0: Gotta act like professionals.

52
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,214
Speaker 0: They always use the word professional.

53
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:37,407
Speaker 0: You know, have two laptops if you're gonna do a PowerPoint in case one doesn't work.

54
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,361
Speaker 0: Have printed out things just in case you can't use the projector.

55
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,750
Speaker 0: Always be prepared for the worst case scenario.

56
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,339
Speaker 0: And they would grade you badly if you didn't.

57
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,790
Speaker 0: If you came in and the laptop didn't work, you failed.

58
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,335
Speaker 1: That's what it should be.

59
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:52,910
Speaker 0: But now I get to the real world, and now it doesn't matter.

60
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,730
Speaker 0: It's just as unprofessional in the real world as it was in college.

61
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:02,350
Speaker 0: In fact, college was in many cases more rigorous, and I was held to a higher standard there than I am now that I work.

62
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:08,450
Speaker 1: Well, I can't say that my work is more professional than what they forced you to do in college.

63
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:17,601
Speaker 1: But I think from what I've seen, and I don't see much, mind you, just sitting at my desk, that at least the people where I work try to be more professional.

64
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,410
Speaker 1: Or at least when they're not professional, they know it and they feel bad.

65
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:36,397
Speaker 1: Like I remember once someone was giving a software demo using GoTo Assist, you know, and it turned out that the license thing was messed up and only so many people could connect, and they tried to get more people to connect, and they were like, "Oh my god.

66
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:37,281
Speaker 1: I look like an idiot.

67
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:37,723
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

68
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:37,943
Speaker 1: Oh my

69
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:38,285
Speaker 1: god.".

70
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,389
Speaker 1: You know, like they knew.

71
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,219
Speaker 1: Which means, you know, and usually when people do things, especially when involving a customer or something, they try to be really professional.

72
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:52,910
Speaker 1: When they do kind of internal things, they don't seem to care so much, they just kind of talk like normal people.

73
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,176
Speaker 0: Yeah.

74
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:12,290
Speaker 1: But whenever it's something with a customer or another business or outsiders, unless, you know, they get buddy-buddy with them over time, I definitely see some sort of professional effort despite, you know, however the talent of being professional of the particular person or persons may be.

75
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:12,873
Speaker 1: See,

76
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:34,270
Speaker 0: I guess it's just, I mean, I'm not really picking on the company I work for because I've noticed it pretty much in every company I've worked for and every company I've dealt with, and even when I interviewed with companies, it just seems like most people who are out there in the real world getting paid to do a job are just the most unprofessional, unprepared, unable to cope with any sort of difficulty people in the world.

77
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:35,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's people.

78
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:38,649
Speaker 0: And it kind of frightens and saddens me.

79
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:43,759
Speaker 1: Well, it's because, you know, because people are business people, you kind of get this idea like, "Oh, he's a business

80
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,124
Speaker 1: person.".

81
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:48,229
Speaker 1: But really, business people are just the same stupid people as everyone else.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,750
Speaker 0: But how hard is it to at least take something and do it in a professional manner?

83
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:56,210
Speaker 1: Well, I'd say that our podcast- It's real hard if you don't give two shits.

84
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,749
Speaker 0: But I mean, look at this show right here.

85
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,950
Speaker 0: We're doing this pretty much as professionally as we have the means to do.

86
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,030
Speaker 0: We got nice equipment.

87
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:04,530
Speaker 0: We do it regularly.

88
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:05,970
Speaker 0: We got little microphones.

89
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's because this is something we want to do.

90
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,670
Speaker 1: And for no other reason than we want to do it.

91
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,630
Speaker 1: Imagine if this was like a chore.

92
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,310
Speaker 1: It felt like a chore and someone was paying us to do it.

93
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,330
Speaker 1: And we didn't really care about how it turned out.

94
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,549
Speaker 1: We're doing it just because.

95
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:20,688
Speaker 1: We're kind of forced to.

96
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,089
Speaker 1: And we do it every day and it's bleh.

97
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,370
Speaker 1: You wouldn't put as much effort into it or as much care.

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,210
Speaker 1: You would let things slip by and you wouldn't feel bad if it messed up.

99
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,546
Speaker 1: You'd just be like, "Oh, I still get

100
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:32,809
Speaker 1: paid."

101
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,086
Speaker 1: Whatever.

102
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:37,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, part of it is the things people want to do aren't things you can get paid for.

103
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:41,490
Speaker 0: And it's hard to get jobs that you can really be prideful about.

104
00:06:42,551 --> 00:06:45,630
Speaker 1: Yup, especially if you have no talents and no interests.

105
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, though it's even worse for us.

106
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,950
Speaker 0: We have talents and interests.

107
00:06:49,031 --> 00:06:50,949
Speaker 0: There's just there's no way to get into a lot of jobs.

108
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:51,546
Speaker 1: There is.

109
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,929
Speaker 0: We just need money and power.

110
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:55,469
Speaker 0: Inns.

111
00:06:55,836 --> 00:06:55,986
Speaker 1: Inns.

112
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,627
Speaker 1: We need some inns.

113
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:57,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need some inns.

114
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,404
Speaker 1: All up ons.

115
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:00,470
Speaker 1: All right.

116
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:01,208
Speaker 0: All right.

117
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,970
Speaker 0: So anyway, now that I'm done ranting about that, because I've been snippy about that all day.

118
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:09,929
Speaker 0: I came home and I was in a swearing mood because I just couldn't believe what I had just seen at work.

119
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:11,804
Speaker 1: You should have videotaped it.

120
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

121
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,790
Speaker 0: God, there's a recording of it somewhere.

122
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:17,510
Speaker 1: Dude, that should be hilarious.

123
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no way I could ever play it, because once we actually got the conference going, it went really well.

124
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,370
Speaker 0: And there's actually, it was a lot of cool, like, insider type information I can't talk about.

125
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:32,829
Speaker 0: But IBM pretty much, and I can say this because this is definitely true.

126
00:07:33,432 --> 00:07:38,770
Speaker 0: IBM pretty much said that all the problems with the Xbox 360 have nothing to do with their chips.

127
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:40,990
Speaker 0: It's all Microsoft ball.

128
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:41,667
Speaker 1: Of course.

129
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:43,650
Speaker 0: Our chips are fine.

130
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:44,334
Speaker 1: Duh.

131
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,049
Speaker 0: So on to some actual good news.

132
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,569
Speaker 0: Verizon hates the telemarketers as much as you do.

133
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,050
Speaker 1: Well, it costs them a lot of money.

134
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,007
Speaker 0: Oh, not even that.

135
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:05,370
Speaker 0: Customer service wise, if they take a stance against telemarketers, which doesn't really cost them anything, not only do they get money out of the telemarketers, who break the laws, but the customers are real happy.

136
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,109
Speaker 0: A lot of goodwill.

137
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:09,430
Speaker 1: Yep, definitely a good move on Verizon.

138
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,790
Speaker 1: I'm wondering why no phone companies have done this before.

139
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:12,285
Speaker 1: I mean...

140
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,770
Speaker 0: Well, Verizon's only targeting telemarketers who attack their cell phones.

141
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:16,332
Speaker 1: Ah.

142
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,010
Speaker 0: Because that's the only people they can target.

143
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:19,668
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,396
Speaker 1: But I mean, imagine it, but I mean, like, imagine it.

145
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:29,070
Speaker 1: back in the day, someone said, you know, when we had landline phones and telemarketing was rampant and terrible.

146
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:32,510
Speaker 1: And someone said, use our phone service.

147
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:36,230
Speaker 1: You know, who cares about stupid dime a minute, nickel a minute, whatever.

148
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,749
Speaker 1: They said, we'll make sure that, you know, telemarketers don't get you.

149
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, a lot of phone companies sell various telemarketer blocking things.

150
00:08:47,713 --> 00:08:49,110
Speaker 1: Those don't actually work, I imagine.

151
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,188
Speaker 0: Well, you know what works real well?

152
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,530
Speaker 0: A, having a cell phone or B, being on the do not call list.

153
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:54,827
Speaker 1: Do not call list.

154
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:55,428
Speaker 1: All right.

155
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:03,010
Speaker 0: Now, the reason the Verizon thing works is basically there's actually a federal law that telemarketers cannot call your cell phone ever.

156
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:04,088
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

157
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,390
Speaker 1: Because I absolutely.

158
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,230
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

159
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,890
Speaker 0: Unless they have an actual prior business relationship.

160
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:18,930
Speaker 0: And if they call you on a cell phone and they actually do have a legitimate relationship and you tell them never to call you again, they cannot call you ever again unless you reopen the business relationship.

161
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,110
Speaker 1: But you have to close the business relationship, though?

162
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:23,549
Speaker 0: You can just tell them not to call you.

163
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:24,711
Speaker 1: No, what?

164
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:32,390
Speaker 1: if they have but like, can you tell them call me if this but don't call me if that depends on the company, but basically they don't have to accommodate you in that sense.

165
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:40,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even if they call you, they can't call you for promotional reasons because I'd like Cablevision to not call me for promotional reasons, which is what they do.

166
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,428
Speaker 0: They do yell at them.

167
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,830
Speaker 1: But I do want them to call me if there's something wrong with my cable vision.

168
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,009
Speaker 0: Tell them to never call you for a promotional reason.

169
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,248
Speaker 1: All right, I'll do it next time.

170
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:56,750
Speaker 0: And if any of you out there ever get a telemarketer on your cell phone, it's against the law.

171
00:09:57,231 --> 00:09:57,895
Speaker 0: Nail him to the wall.

172
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,970
Speaker 0: You can sue him for money if you're really that inclined.

173
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,509
Speaker 1: And you have a landline phone.

174
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:02,197
Speaker 1: What?

175
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:02,685
Speaker 1: What?

176
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:03,030
Speaker 1: Why?

177
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:04,295
Speaker 1: What?

178
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:04,558
Speaker 1: What?

179
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:05,750
Speaker 1: What are you doing with that?

180
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:13,150
Speaker 0: I mean, the cheapest landline we could get here costs about the same as a cheap cell phone plan and doesn't include long distance or anything.

181
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:14,369
Speaker 1: And it can't leave my house.

182
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,093
Speaker 0: Yeah.

183
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,629
Speaker 0: And telemarketers can call it.

184
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:18,910
Speaker 1: It's pretty much bad all around.

185
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:21,016
Speaker 0: Even if you're on the do not call list, they can.

186
00:10:21,197 --> 00:10:25,610
Speaker 0: telemarketers can call you as long as they pretend to be a charity or a survey or politics.

187
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, politics.

188
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:32,029
Speaker 0: Though the Republicans called me before the election on my cell phone and they're not allowed to do that.

189
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,890
Speaker 0: I called them back and left a nasty voicemail.

190
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,548
Speaker 0: But did they ever get back to you?

191
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,693
Speaker 0: No, they never got back.

192
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:42,450
Speaker 0: But to be fair, the Democrats also called me and I also sent them a nasty voicemail.

193
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,051
Speaker 1: Yeah.

194
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:45,150
Speaker 0: In fact, I sent them almost identical voicemails.

195
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,750
Speaker 1: They probably found your phone number on some paper somewhere.

196
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,371
Speaker 1: Yeah.

197
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:56,250
Speaker 0: But the really the other really cool thing about this is that Verizon sued and they got like 20 grand out of one of these telemarketing companies.

198
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:56,974
Speaker 1: Awesome.

199
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,690
Speaker 0: They donated it to charity.

200
00:10:59,453 --> 00:11:00,120
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

201
00:11:00,564 --> 00:11:00,989
Speaker 1: There you go.

202
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:13,010
Speaker 0: So, I mean, I generally dislike Verizon's cell phone service, but not any more than I dislike every other cell phone service in the U.S I only have a problem with Verizon with their locking down of phones, but everyone locks down the freaking phone.

203
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:13,855
Speaker 0: Yeah.

204
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:15,150
Speaker 0: But plus one for Verizon.

205
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,130
Speaker 0: I'm slightly pleased with you as a corporation.

206
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,150
Speaker 0: Bravo.

207
00:11:21,152 --> 00:11:26,490
Speaker 1: I guess you need to do something to separate yourself from the competition when you don't want to break the business model.

208
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

209
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:27,591
Speaker 0: Yeah.

210
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:35,830
Speaker 1: So on the no mailing list, some guy was complaining that like some certain printer options don't appear in a dialog box.

211
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:45,690
Speaker 0: Now, just for those of you who may not be Linux inclined, Gnome and KDE are the two main window manager slash desktop environments that are used in Linux.

212
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:46,394
Speaker 1: Yeah.

213
00:11:46,454 --> 00:11:46,756
Speaker 1: Those are.

214
00:11:46,776 --> 00:11:49,150
Speaker 0: they're basically like the big overarching GUI.

215
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,811
Speaker 1: Yep.

216
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:50,867
Speaker 1: OK.

217
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:56,869
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the Gnome printing dialog, it doesn't have these options in it.

218
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:03,850
Speaker 1: And some guy was like, yeah, that's because the Gnome guys don't want to put it there because it's confusing to people who don't know what they're doing.

219
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,450
Speaker 1: And Linus Torvalds, the Linux guy, says he doesn't like that.

220
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,430
Speaker 1: He says that the users are idiots and are confused by functionality mentality.

221
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:18,250
Speaker 1: So he doesn't actually say the users are idiots.

222
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:26,590
Speaker 1: He says the mentality of the users being idiots is a disease and that if you think your users are idiots, only idiots will use your program.

223
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:31,010
Speaker 0: Now, this sparked a flame war on Slashdot.

224
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

225
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:37,430
Speaker 1: He basically said don't use Gnome because he gets rid of all these options to make things easy for idiots.

226
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:46,050
Speaker 1: And it makes it impossible for him to do things, because when you remove the things to make it easier for idiots, you remove the possibility to do things that he needs to do.

227
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:57,910
Speaker 0: Now, I agree with him there generally, because I really like to have all the options available to me, but I still use Gnome because honestly, for very little effort, Gnome looks very pretty and very functional very quickly.

228
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:58,370
Speaker 1: Yep.

229
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:03,943
Speaker 1: And the other thing is I'd like to know if Linus uses Firefox, because Firefox definitely has.

230
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:07,230
Speaker 1: the users are idiots and are confused by functionality mentality.

231
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:12,830
Speaker 1: I mean, every freaking Firefox upgrade, they remove things from the options menu.

232
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,130
Speaker 0: Yep.

233
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,550
Speaker 0: Or they at least hide them away under that advanced tab.

234
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:25,142
Speaker 1: If you go to about config, that's where they hide the advanced stuff, you know, they make it so that nothing is impossible, but they make everything.

236
00:13:25,603 --> 00:13:31,330
Speaker 1: that's not, you know, meant for the user hidden away and they make it as simple as possible, which is really good.

237
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:48,110
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, setting a default as opposed to having the user pick an option is great for your program, especially if you choose the right default, because, you know, a lot of times, you know, they just say, oh, we don't know which one to pick for the default or just give the user the option.

238
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:57,830
Speaker 1: And then you end up having the KDE, which I don't like, because, sure, you can do anything, but it's basically just sea of checkboxes and you have no idea what any of them do.

239
00:13:58,251 --> 00:13:58,492
Speaker 0: Yep.

240
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,969
Speaker 1: You know, the checkbox you want is in there somewhere, but it's impossible to figure out where the heck it is.

241
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,613
Speaker 0: See, we have two different rationales.

242
00:14:04,653 --> 00:14:12,290
Speaker 0: Scott cares a lot about the functionality, and I just don't like the way KDE looks without a lot of effort into making it look and feel differently.

243
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:13,234
Speaker 0: Yeah.

244
00:14:13,254 --> 00:14:14,229
Speaker 0: Gnome, I just like the look and feel.

245
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,330
Speaker 1: And the other thing is, even if you use Gnome, sure, there are things that won't appear in the GUI and they're kind of hard to do.

246
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:20,310
Speaker 0: You still have a terminal.

247
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,901
Speaker 1: You can still go to the terminal and do them.

248
00:14:22,204 --> 00:14:22,930
Speaker 1: No one's stopping you.

249
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:30,530
Speaker 0: While I have a GUI, and I have a grand total of five icons total that can do anything.

250
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:39,510
Speaker 0: I have Firefox, Gaim, a button that opens my MP3 folder, Steam, I don't know why, because it doesn't work, and Azureus.

251
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:48,690
Speaker 1: Well, at least Linus Torvalds, it looks like he has the, you know, do things the real way, you know, kind of philosophy a little bit.

252
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:55,450
Speaker 1: But at least he doesn't have the do everything in the terminal, Xs for losers kind of thing going on.

253
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:02,370
Speaker 0: Because I mean, it's one thing to be a super advanced Linux user where you use like rat poison and you do crazy things.

254
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:16,830
Speaker 0: But there are a lot of Linux developers out there who not only believe that everyone should only use the terminal command line, but they get actually pissed if people take hard to use applications and make them easier to use.

255
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:17,349
Speaker 1: Yep.

256
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,538
Speaker 0: Like, I'm not kidding.

257
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,910
Speaker 0: These people are kind of scary.

258
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,973
Speaker 1: Very scary, guys.

259
00:15:22,013 --> 00:15:27,450
Speaker 1: I remember I talked to one once and he's like, we shouldn't make a GUI installer for Gen 2, right?

260
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,470
Speaker 1: And I'm like, well, why not?

261
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,369
Speaker 1: I'm like, we're not forcing you to use it.

262
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,310
Speaker 1: I mean, if we were forcing you to use it and get rid of the normal install method, that would be a problem.

263
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:39,950
Speaker 1: But we're still keeping the old install method.

264
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,289
Speaker 1: We're just adding a GUI one.

265
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:50,230
Speaker 1: And the only argument he could come up with that was even close to rational was that the developers working on that could have been working on something else.

266
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:56,210
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, you know what, since they're not being paid, they decide what they want to work on.

267
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,850
Speaker 0: That's like saying, why are you riding your bike?

268
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,249
Speaker 0: You could be researching cancer.

269
00:15:59,730 --> 00:15:59,800
Speaker 0: Yep.

270
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,250
Speaker 0: Why are you going to the mall?

271
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:03,750
Speaker 0: You could be helping starving orphans in Africa.

272
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could, but it's not going to happen.

273
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:07,281
Speaker 1: Nope.

274
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:16,290
Speaker 1: And I think like 90 percent of the problems in this world is people not minding their own business and caring what other people do.

275
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,249
Speaker 1: Don't care what other people do.

276
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,089
Speaker 1: If they're not you, fuck them.

277
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,910
Speaker 0: Unless it hurts you or hurts other people, then you should care.

278
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:23,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

279
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,090
Speaker 1: And don't imagine it hurts you just because it bothers you.

280
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:33,310
Speaker 1: If it bothers you, that's probably because the other person is doing something that you want to do or they have an ability you don't have or you're jealous.

281
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:38,350
Speaker 1: 90 percent of the time, if something someone else does bothers you, it's because you are jealous of them.

282
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:40,550
Speaker 1: And if you accept it, you'll be a lot better off.

283
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:41,310
Speaker 0: Not always.

284
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,910
Speaker 0: I mean, if there's a Nazi doing his Nazi stuff.

285
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,789
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,950
Speaker 0: You're probably legitimately bothered by that, but.

287
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:50,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then he's harming himself and/or others.

288
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,630
Speaker 1: You know, and if it's seriously, I'm a Jew kind of.

290
00:16:54,950 --> 00:17:02,290
Speaker 1: And if there's a Nazi and he's doing his Nazi stuff, but he's not hurting anyone, he's just yelling his Nazi yells and such and marching his Nazi marches.

291
00:17:02,893 --> 00:17:04,169
Speaker 1: That doesn't bother me at all.

292
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I mean, even the Supreme Court agrees that freedom of speech carries a large risk.

293
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,190
Speaker 0: And despite that, we have to accept that risk in order to have a free society.

294
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, if someone's, you know, yelling Nazi stuff, I'm not going to be his friend, but I'm not going to make him stop.

295
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,249
Speaker 1: And it doesn't bother me.

296
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,628
Speaker 1: And I don't care if he does it or not.

297
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,150
Speaker 1: I only care if he starts, you know, his own little furnace.

298
00:17:25,373 --> 00:17:27,010
Speaker 1: Then I'll care and they'll put him in jail.

299
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:27,717
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:46,430
Speaker 1: So, you know, while I might think that, you know, doing everything in Aion is the hottest thing in sliced bread, if you don't think so, I might say, wow, you're dumb, especially if I'm obviously right and that it's poo on you.

301
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,950
Speaker 1: And I might try to help you realize why my way is better just because I want to help you out.

302
00:17:51,772 --> 00:17:53,710
Speaker 1: But it's not going to bother me if you don't.

303
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:56,130
Speaker 1: I'll just be like, oh, it sucks to be you if you don't want to listen.

304
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,168
Speaker 1: I'm trying to help you out, man.

305
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,552
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I don't get.

306
00:17:58,813 --> 00:18:07,850
Speaker 0: I mean, on Slashdot, the flame war that I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of people who seem to be almost angry that other people use a different program.

307
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,190
Speaker 0: I mean, people use Gnome, yelling, there's these posts where people are like, wow, people use KDE.

308
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,189
Speaker 0: I hate it.

309
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,909
Speaker 0: I can't stand it.

310
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:17,190
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

311
00:18:17,571 --> 00:18:18,289
Speaker 0: And just why?

312
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:19,889
Speaker 0: You don't have to care.

313
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,570
Speaker 0: Get out of your mom's basement.

314
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:26,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're like, we're two really big Linux geeks, but damn, just let it go.

315
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:28,608
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is.

316
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:39,090
Speaker 1: I think it's similar to the thing I wrote about in my blog a long time ago, how like someone would like one of my sister's friends like Cowabeebop because everyone likes Cowabeebop.

317
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,170
Speaker 1: But then she was like, yeah, it's not so good anymore.

318
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:43,969
Speaker 1: Now it's all mainstream and everyone likes it.

319
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:44,510
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what?

320
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,169
Speaker 1: So somehow the show changed because other people are watching it.

321
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, one more guy found out about it and downloaded it and suddenly it's not good anymore.

322
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,570
Speaker 1: That tells me that you don't actually like it because of it, that you just like liking it.

323
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,430
Speaker 1: You know, you, you like being the person who like you, who, you know, likes things that no one else likes.

324
00:19:02,852 --> 00:19:03,590
Speaker 1: You want to be different.

325
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,210
Speaker 0: Got to watch out for those like likes.

326
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,109
Speaker 0: They take your shield.

327
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:08,089
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely take the shield.

328
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:08,769
Speaker 0: Bastards.

329
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:09,928
Speaker 1: Defense is down.

330
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:13,090
Speaker 1: Oh, no, inner emotions exposed.

331
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:21,660
Speaker 1: All right.

332
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,940
Speaker 1: I had a thing of the day, but the link died.

333
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:28,540
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like another thing of the day that it's not as good, but it's all right.

334
00:19:29,023 --> 00:19:29,776
Speaker 0: So what is it?

335
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,900
Speaker 1: Well, someone's made little arts and crafts and they're selling it on eBay.

336
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:33,879
Speaker 0: Just one?

337
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:35,899
Speaker 0: So it's a unique, like one of a kind thing?

338
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:39,540
Speaker 1: Um, actually, I didn't read.

339
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,099
Speaker 1: I think it is.

340
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a one of a kind art piece.

341
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,259
Speaker 0: How much is it going for?

342
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,019
Speaker 0: Because I saw it and it's kind of cute.

343
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:53,600
Speaker 0: And the problem is it's a product that while I would buy it, I have no use for it because I do not have the thing that it is used with.

344
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's currently at twenty dollars and fifty cents.

345
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,840
Speaker 1: The reserve has been met and there are eight bids already.

346
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,360
Speaker 0: I guess I could use it as like the equivalent of a glove.

347
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:05,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, the auction ends in two days, fifteen hours.

348
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,580
Speaker 0: Because I get a little chilly down there sometimes.

349
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the item is a Cthulhu dildo cathosie.

350
00:20:14,441 --> 00:20:18,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you were looking for a dildo cozy and you like Cthulhu.

351
00:20:20,026 --> 00:20:20,920
Speaker 1: It's actually really good.

352
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:29,560
Speaker 1: It's made of like this green and it's got little wing-a-lings and little tentaclings and little red eyeballs and it fits right on that dildo there.

353
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:34,880
Speaker 1: And I don't I think that's probably the best dildo cathosie in the world.

354
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:36,098
Speaker 0: Wow.

355
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:47,160
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait, these are oh my God, it's from the people who previously bought the Flying Spaghetti Monster dildo cozy.

356
00:20:49,465 --> 00:20:52,300
Speaker 0: I think I see a trend of the types of products they develop.

357
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,280
Speaker 1: The Flying Spaghetti Monster dildo cozy is not as good as the Cthulhu dildo cathosie.

358
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:58,200
Speaker 0: All right.

359
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,098
Speaker 1: I wonder what's next.

360
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:07,280
Speaker 0: So if any of you end up buying that thing, you got to send us a picture of it in action somehow.

361
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,400
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone who listens to this is going to be the guy who wins the auction.

362
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:11,458
Speaker 0: No, no.

363
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,700
Speaker 1: And honestly, I don't really want to see the guy who wins the auction.

364
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,340
Speaker 0: I don't want to see the the possible action shots we might get of a dildo cozy.

365
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:21,604
Speaker 1: Yeah.

366
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:27,939
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is completely not at all related to that.

367
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,920
Speaker 1: It's not dildo related?

368
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,139
Speaker 0: For those of you who know me well, I'm going to work in a dildo.

369
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:47,500
Speaker 0: Like I'm not a history buff in the sense of I like study history, but I'm really fascinated with like old photos and old just sort of ways to look at the past or look at like old writing graffiti on walls from a long time ago.

370
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:57,078
Speaker 0: And there's just this cool archive that the Library of Congress put up of color photographs and color slides from the early 1940s in the U.S That's so old, man.

371
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:58,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that weeks ago.

372
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,020
Speaker 0: It was linked to on Fark today and I saw it and I thought it was really cool.

373
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:02,978
Speaker 1: It is pretty cool.

374
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,358
Speaker 0: So that's my thing of the day.

375
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,420
Speaker 0: Just a bunch of pictures of Americans doing their thing.

376
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:14,980
Speaker 1: There's actually a related thing I saw where someone made a program that could easily colorize black and white photos.

377
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,060
Speaker 0: There are actually a lot of various filters and methods to do that.

378
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is like you don't even have to know Photoshop.

379
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,140
Speaker 1: You literally pick a color and you draw a squiggle.

380
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,460
Speaker 1: You just kind of squiggle in the area where that color goes, just like kind of shoddily.

381
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,679
Speaker 1: And then you click go and it will go.

382
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:38,680
Speaker 1: And there are special plug ins like you just click sky and then you go weeka weeka weeka weeka weeka weeka and then click go and it puts the sky in.

383
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,480
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of stuff like that.

384
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,700
Speaker 0: How do you think Ted Turner colorized every black and white movie ever?

385
00:22:45,561 --> 00:22:52,260
Speaker 1: With a lot of money and a team of people and a lot of programs and computers and yeah, a lot of programs that automated most of the work.

386
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:55,300
Speaker 1: Well, this one's really simple and free and happy.

387
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, simple and free is definitely key.

388
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:57,460
Speaker 1: Yeah.

389
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it's video game day and well, not just video game day.

390
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:03,419
Speaker 0: It's actually gaming day.

391
00:23:03,881 --> 00:23:04,052
Speaker 1: Game day.

392
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:04,781
Speaker 0: It's just.

393
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:11,200
Speaker 0: we tend to do video games a lot since we don't get to play as many board games as we'd like to anymore or not any role playing games at all.

394
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:15,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're playing that online D&D game still, but you don't want to hear about that.

395
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,743
Speaker 1: No, what are the?

396
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:19,180
Speaker 1: I guess those are all the kinds of games that anyone wants to play these days.

397
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

398
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,659
Speaker 0: But we finally played Morterer.

399
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:24,879
Speaker 1: Oh, Morterer, an excellent game.

400
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:27,140
Speaker 0: I like it at least twice as much as I like Verator.

401
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:28,603
Speaker 1: I don't know.

402
00:23:28,623 --> 00:23:31,880
Speaker 1: I like Verator more than you, but I do like Morterer more than Verator.

403
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:35,700
Speaker 1: But I think it's not that Morterer is really better.

404
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:37,660
Speaker 1: It's that Verator is worse.

405
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:42,520
Speaker 1: It's only worse, though, because of the Gustav Kontor mechanic.

406
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,405
Speaker 1: I don't like that.

407
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:45,520
Speaker 1: I think that really brings Verator down.

408
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:57,300
Speaker 1: And I think if they did something else in Verator to replace that mechanic, that I would actually like that game better because I like the whole like, haha, I'm Verating is like a lot more forceful.

409
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,439
Speaker 1: And in Morterer, when you're mortering, it's like, all right, someone pick the Morterer, you know?

410
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:02,402
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:04,660
Speaker 1: In Verator, it's like, oh, my God, he picked the Verator.

412
00:24:04,762 --> 00:24:05,377
Speaker 1: What the heck?

413
00:24:06,701 --> 00:24:14,180
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's also in Verator, you have your supply of cards in your hand, and it's very difficult to get more cards into your hand.

414
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's your whole Gustav Kontor.

415
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:19,260
Speaker 0: I'm just kind of explaining it for all the people who haven't played this game.

416
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:26,280
Speaker 0: I don't speak German, but basically you have your hand and you have to use cards in your hand to accomplish anything, but then your hand runs out.

417
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,134
Speaker 0: And the only way to get things back into your hand is it forces you to either wait or take a stupid action.

418
00:24:32,154 --> 00:24:34,360
Speaker 0: that just doesn't let you do anything that round, basically.

419
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,000
Speaker 0: And everyone has to do that.

420
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,220
Speaker 0: So the game keeps forcing you.

421
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,752
Speaker 0: You have to keep worrying about this thing.

422
00:24:39,773 --> 00:24:40,600
Speaker 0: that's not fun.

423
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,519
Speaker 0: And it's just kind of a chore to fill your hand back up.

424
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,059
Speaker 0: In Verator, the hand just always fills back up.

425
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,400
Speaker 1: In Morterer, the hand always fills back up.

426
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:57,860
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, in Morterer, it just fills back up and you can focus on the more fun mechanics of the game, like being the mutineer or piloting the ship or trading the goods in port or telling the pirate to come and get you.

427
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:04,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what's funny is in the second game of Morterer we played where I won, I actually chose the Loadmeister.

428
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:12,700
Speaker 1: Like two or three times and all he does is let you have a little more choice in when you draw back up to five because everyone draws back up to five cards.

429
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,519
Speaker 1: And no matter what, you're going to have five cards each round.

430
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:20,480
Speaker 1: But the Loadmeister lets you draw three extras in addition to what you normally drew.

431
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,300
Speaker 1: And then that way you can kind of choose what you get to put in your hand, which is opposed to getting randomness.

432
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,338
Speaker 1: And that helped a whole hell of a lot.

433
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:34,880
Speaker 0: Whereas in this game, most games, like this game is very much a difference of one means a lot.

434
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,532
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

435
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,180
Speaker 0: Having one more card than someone is just insane.

436
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,000
Speaker 1: I mean, in Varator, it's pretty much all the cards in the game are for fighting.

437
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,700
Speaker 1: You know, it's the bigger numbers fight big and the smaller numbers fight small.

438
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:53,900
Speaker 1: And, you know, you get the Gustavs, which let you draw more cards and those kind of mean a lot, but they kind of don't.

439
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,840
Speaker 1: It's like they mean a lot over a long time.

440
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:03,260
Speaker 1: But if you lose one for a turn, it's all right, you know, but it's just number of cards in Varator and luck of getting big cards.

441
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:12,580
Speaker 1: In Moiterer, there's only six cards that are for fighting and all of them count as one, you know, and usually you don't see a whole bunch of them out there.

442
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:16,059
Speaker 1: You know, it's like if there's a fight, you'll see maybe three of these things.

443
00:26:17,081 --> 00:26:20,880
Speaker 1: And like someone just picking the mate counts as one automatically.

444
00:26:21,262 --> 00:26:22,258
Speaker 1: That's freaking huge.

445
00:26:23,222 --> 00:26:25,840
Speaker 1: It's like a one sixth advantage just for doing nothing.

446
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,019
Speaker 0: And there's two mechanics in Moiterer that I really, really like.

447
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:34,160
Speaker 0: One, if you're the captain, you basically get to pick your bribe for someone to be your mate.

448
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:39,480
Speaker 0: It's how many victory points of yours you'll give to whoever picks the mate card to help you fight off a mutiny.

449
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:45,920
Speaker 0: So depending on how confident you are, how bluff worthy you are, you can offer a lot or offer none.

450
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,839
Speaker 0: And I think that's really neat.

451
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:50,360
Speaker 0: Two, you can play conflict cards during the conflict.

452
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:55,658
Speaker 0: Or like basically what does you go around one card at a time and everyone plays a good.

453
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:05,420
Speaker 0: And then when you don't want to play any more goods, you say I'm out and you draw, you pick an action card based on whatever's left in the action card pile and no one else knows what you picked.

454
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:10,760
Speaker 0: So you can also lay out conflict cards during the good phase.

455
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,679
Speaker 0: So you could be like it comes around and you lay a toque or a piece of cloth down, comes around, you lay another toque.

456
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:18,739
Speaker 0: Then it comes around, you lay a conflict card.

457
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,179
Speaker 0: That's basically saying, yeah, don't fuck with me.

458
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:22,580
Speaker 0: I'll win a conflict.

459
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's already one sixth of the conflict cards in the whole game are out in front of you where everyone can see.

460
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,320
Speaker 1: They're going, damn, if we try to fight against him, then we're probably not going to win.

461
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,340
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if he's not the captain, you don't know what side that guy is going to be on necessarily.

462
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,460
Speaker 1: Well, really, the thing I like about the game most is in Varator, you can kind of guess what roles other people have.

463
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:53,240
Speaker 0: I mean, we guessed it with 100 percent accuracy when we played, but it was three player and it was kind of obvious.

464
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:59,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, because in Varator, there's six roles and the first person takes one of them and throws them out.

465
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,140
Speaker 1: And that role can't be chosen.

466
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:05,160
Speaker 1: The first person at least knows no one has that role.

467
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:05,901
Speaker 1: Right.

468
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:07,639
Speaker 1: Then he takes a role for himself.

469
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:16,060
Speaker 1: The second person in Varator knows that two roles are missing and that the first player is one of those two roles, but doesn't know which one.

470
00:28:16,886 --> 00:28:17,859
Speaker 1: And then he takes a role.

471
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:24,760
Speaker 1: The third player knows that there are three roles missing in the first and second player, two of them and so on.

472
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,340
Speaker 1: And the final player has, you know, all the remaining roles, which he keeps one of and throws out the rest.

473
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:37,140
Speaker 1: So, you know, the second last player knows he's one of those ones I gave him.

474
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:38,819
Speaker 1: You know, he doesn't know which one.

475
00:28:39,421 --> 00:28:41,419
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like different people know different stuff.

476
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,637
Speaker 1: In Moiterer, the captain doesn't know crap.

477
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:46,700
Speaker 0: It's real scary to be the captain.

478
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:55,797
Speaker 0: Like you're looking at your crew and as you're on a ship and you're standing there and you're looking at your crew and they're looking back at you and you don't know if one of them is going to betray you or it's scary.

479
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,100
Speaker 1: Because when the captain is done putting out his goods, he doesn't take an action card like everyone else.

480
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,071
Speaker 1: He's already the captain.

481
00:29:03,111 --> 00:29:03,780
Speaker 1: That's his action.

482
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:13,300
Speaker 1: He just puts the little ship where it's going to go, the marker where the ship is going to go to if he wins, if there is a fight even, because if there's no fight, the captain wins automatically.

483
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:13,692
Speaker 0: Yup.

484
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:15,337
Speaker 1: I have hiccups.

485
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:21,280
Speaker 1: But everyone else, the first person to finish who's not the captain, takes an action card.

486
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,420
Speaker 1: The second person knows exactly what the first person took because the only action card missing.

487
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,000
Speaker 1: And the third person, if there is a fourth player, knows two action cards are missing and the other two players are those two action cards.

488
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,119
Speaker 0: So you might be the third player and you look and someone took the Moiterer.

489
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

490
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,939
Speaker 0: Now you don't know who took it.

491
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:39,802
Speaker 1: Yeah.

492
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,880
Speaker 1: Is it the guy you think is going to win or is it the guy you think is going to lose?

493
00:29:43,262 --> 00:29:45,773
Speaker 1: Do you think that if you took the mate, you could help the captain win?

494
00:29:46,115 --> 00:29:47,280
Speaker 1: or is the mate already taken?

495
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,339
Speaker 0: Or do you want the captain to win?

496
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

497
00:29:50,361 --> 00:29:56,960
Speaker 1: Is the captain taking the boat somewhere where you're going to make out good or is the captain going to take, or is the Moiterer going to take the boat somewhere better?

498
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:57,877
Speaker 1: You don't know.

499
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,160
Speaker 0: It's just nerve wracking.

500
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:07,480
Speaker 0: I remember one instance I was the captain and Wyatt, a friend of ours, lay down like two or three conflict cards while we were going around with the goods.

501
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:10,499
Speaker 0: And I was like, is he going to Moitre me?

502
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,818
Speaker 0: Because I can't win if he does.

503
00:30:12,284 --> 00:30:13,859
Speaker 0: If he moitered, I'm just completely boned.

504
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:15,264
Speaker 0: But he didn't.

505
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,300
Speaker 0: He mated and we made out like bandits.

506
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:17,920
Speaker 1: Yep.

507
00:30:18,823 --> 00:30:25,660
Speaker 1: It's a real tough call because, you know, if you mate and you win, you can score big by helping the captain.

508
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:34,880
Speaker 1: Just like if you cabin boy and the Moiterer wins, you're basically, you know, the captain and the Moiterer are the big two, because if you're the Moiterer and you win, you become the captain.

509
00:30:35,221 --> 00:30:37,680
Speaker 1: And if you're the captain, you're pretty much in charge of everything.

510
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,120
Speaker 1: And you bring the boat to places and you get points for bringing the boat around.

511
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:42,139
Speaker 1: You don't have to do anything.

512
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,659
Speaker 1: Everyone else can trade goods to get points.

513
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,499
Speaker 1: But the big way to get points is to captain the ship.

514
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:54,640
Speaker 1: But if you are the Moiterer, you can become the captain by kicking the captain's ass.

515
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,520
Speaker 1: Now, it really kind of sucks if it's a four player game and only the captain and the Moiterer really have the ways to score big points.

516
00:31:03,164 --> 00:31:04,500
Speaker 1: So they put in the captain and the mate.

517
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,220
Speaker 1: I mean, the mate and the cabin boy.

518
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,196
Speaker 1: Basically, you can choose sides.

519
00:31:10,084 --> 00:31:11,800
Speaker 1: And if your side wins, you score big.

520
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:14,580
Speaker 1: But if your side loses, wow, you got screwed.

521
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:22,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, because you could have taken the neutral roles of Lodemeister or Hundler and probably gotten more points than picking the losing side.

522
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,599
Speaker 0: It's a really good game.

523
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,419
Speaker 0: It's really good.

524
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,080
Speaker 0: And it's got two more things going for it.

525
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:27,860
Speaker 0: One is this is a cardboard game.

526
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:28,800
Speaker 0: It's super portable.

527
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,660
Speaker 0: You just carry it in your pocket.

528
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was only eight bucks.

529
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,879
Speaker 0: And two, which is probably more important to me, it's a really quick game.

530
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:37,520
Speaker 1: I was surprised how quick it was.

531
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,376
Speaker 1: I thought it'd be longer, but it only took us like 10, 15 minutes.

532
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:42,218
Speaker 1: It was pretty short.

533
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could just blow through those.

534
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,360
Speaker 0: We just blow through round after round after round without even blinking.

535
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really good.

536
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,400
Speaker 1: The problem is it's in German, but there's good English rules online.

537
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:54,480
Speaker 1: And once you've played a few times, you don't need the rules anymore.

538
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,680
Speaker 0: English and German are very similar in many ways.

539
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,660
Speaker 0: And you can usually figure out what the cards mean just by looking at them.

540
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,640
Speaker 1: I'm actually thinking I'm having more fun playing the games written in German, saying the funny German words.

541
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, mate, or the frost hole, the piratin den.

542
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:08,979
Speaker 1: The piratin nest.

543
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,377
Speaker 0: Nest, nest.

544
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,620
Speaker 0: The frost hole.

545
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,380
Speaker 0: What else does the cabin word say, like jiggenschiffle or something long?

546
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,080
Speaker 1: The jigenschuffle something?

547
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,219
Speaker 0: Something long in German.

548
00:32:17,982 --> 00:32:18,440
Speaker 0: Means cabin boy.

549
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

550
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,840
Speaker 1: Sometimes you want to use the English word.

551
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,660
Speaker 1: I don't want to say the German word for cabin boy.

552
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:23,539
Speaker 0: No, no.

553
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
Speaker 1: But I do like to say meuterer.

554
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:26,520
Speaker 0: And leidenmeister.

555
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:27,597
Speaker 1: Lodemeister.

556
00:32:27,962 --> 00:32:28,880
Speaker 0: No, it's leidenmeister.

557
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,380
Speaker 1: Whatever.

558
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:30,500
Speaker 0: There's an A there.

559
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,939
Speaker 0: There's no O anywhere in that word.

560
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:33,180
Speaker 1: I like saying load better.

561
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:33,780
Speaker 0: It's not.

562
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:34,296
Speaker 0: It's leid.

563
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,300
Speaker 0: Maybe it's not pronounced leid, but there's no O there.

564
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:37,780
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter.

565
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,380
Speaker 1: He's the load.

566
00:32:38,501 --> 00:32:39,580
Speaker 1: In English, he's the loader.

567
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,220
Speaker 0: He's the load master.

568
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:41,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

569
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,300
Speaker 0: Meister.

570
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,319
Speaker 1: Lodemeister.

571
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:44,616
Speaker 0: Way to go.

572
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,659
Speaker 0: German for the win.

573
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,557
Speaker 1: For the win.

574
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:53,260
Speaker 1: So, um, over the weekend here, my friend came over.

575
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,760
Speaker 1: He had nanostray for the DS, which I kind of wanted to play for a while because it's a space shooty game.

576
00:32:59,103 --> 00:33:00,479
Speaker 1: And I like space shooty games.

577
00:33:01,201 --> 00:33:03,999
Speaker 1: But I didn't really want to pay for it because I heard it wasn't the perfect game.

578
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:08,680
Speaker 1: But, uh, I borrowed it for like a few minutes and I beat it overnight.

579
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,499
Speaker 1: I basically played a little before I went to bed and a little when I woke up and then I beat it.

580
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,020
Speaker 0: Great.

581
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,680
Speaker 1: It really, I can't say it's worth the money, but if you can play it for free, why not?

582
00:33:20,221 --> 00:33:20,980
Speaker 0: So it's like polarium.

583
00:33:21,963 --> 00:33:22,780
Speaker 1: Kind of like polarium.

584
00:33:23,021 --> 00:33:24,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say it's equal in quality.

585
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,960
Speaker 0: Cause I got all I was ever going to get out of polarium from when we went to the Nintendo world store grand opening in the city.

586
00:33:30,661 --> 00:33:34,140
Speaker 0: They had a polarium there on a little like DS kiosk.

587
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,500
Speaker 0: So I went into that DS kiosk and I said, told it to play multiplayer.

588
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,739
Speaker 0: I downloaded the demo from it and I played the demo on the train home.

589
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,860
Speaker 0: And then that was all I got out of that game.

590
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,999
Speaker 0: The game wasn't worth any amount of money beyond that.

591
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,556
Speaker 1: Yeah.

592
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,539
Speaker 1: Well, nanostray, the problem I really had with it was that it could have been a great space shooty game.

593
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,900
Speaker 1: It really like, it fell just short in every area, which made it kind of crummy overall.

594
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,272
Speaker 1: Great.

595
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:04,520
Speaker 1: So the way it works is the one first, first problem, weapon selection via touch screen.

596
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,699
Speaker 1: Very, very bad.

597
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:12,860
Speaker 1: You could have used the R button for weapon selection and L to go back, but R and L didn't do anything in this game as far as I could tell.

598
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

599
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,520
Speaker 0: It seems a lot of the earlier DS games use the touch screen in ways that you just, why bother?

600
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,047
Speaker 1: Yeah.

601
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:19,920
Speaker 1: All right.

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,840
Speaker 1: Number two is it's kind of 3D ish, which is all right.

603
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,498
Speaker 1: That's, that's cool.

604
00:34:24,761 --> 00:34:28,260
Speaker 1: You know, you're on the bottom, you're flying up like Galaga or Raptor.

605
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,060
Speaker 1: Call the shadows, but you're only on the top screen.

606
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:51,500
Speaker 1: If they would have made this actually just two screens and they're bad guys coming down from the top screen to the bottom screen, or you could fly the ship from screen to screen, or, you know, just a long space shooty game instead of one that was stuck in this little half, you know, of the DS screens, that would have made the game tremendously better.

607
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,400
Speaker 0: So you're basically, this is a game that could have come out on the GBA.

608
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could have come out in, well, no, cause it was 3D ish.

609
00:34:57,866 --> 00:34:58,300
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

610
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,460
Speaker 1: Basically it's you, you, there are four weapons.

611
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,480
Speaker 1: There's blue, which is just shoot forward.

612
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,799
Speaker 1: There's green, which is shoot to the both sides.

613
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:07,720
Speaker 1: There's red, which is these kind of homing things.

614
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:10,780
Speaker 1: It's like lasers and they bend a little bit towards bad guys.

615
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:22,860
Speaker 1: And the fourth weapon is, uh, lightning and the lightning shoots straight forward, but if it hits something, it kind of grabs onto it so you can fly off in a different direction and you'll still be doing damage to whatever you hit.

616
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:26,820
Speaker 1: And you have infinity of those four weapons.

617
00:35:27,401 --> 00:35:35,020
Speaker 1: You also have this energy meter and whenever you push B, you shoot like a special weapon, depending on which weapon you have selected.

618
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:42,700
Speaker 1: So if you have the blue weapon out, you'll shoot like a strong blue beam forward as long as you hold B down and your energy meter depletes.

619
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,620
Speaker 1: If you have the lasers, you'll shoot these big homing missile things around, you know, all that kind of stuff.

620
00:35:49,401 --> 00:35:50,900
Speaker 0: So I was never much of a fan of shmups.

621
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:51,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

622
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,878
Speaker 0: My favorite ones ever are still, uh, R-Type for the SNES.

623
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,039
Speaker 1: R-Type is great.

624
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Raptor Call of the Shadows.

625
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,560
Speaker 1: Gradius.

626
00:35:58,902 --> 00:35:59,460
Speaker 1: Gradius is great.

627
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,520
Speaker 0: Gradius III was alright.

628
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,840
Speaker 0: It's the only one I ever really played.

629
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,819
Speaker 1: I like the Darius's.

630
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:03,920
Speaker 1: I like lots of space shootings.

631
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,818
Speaker 0: I like Raiden.

632
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:05,939
Speaker 1: Raiden's very good.

633
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:06,760
Speaker 0: I liked it in the arcade.

634
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely the best arcade ones, Raiden.

635
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:10,800
Speaker 0: I don't like Ikaruga.

636
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,057
Speaker 0: That game is just beyond the amount of effort.

637
00:36:13,442 --> 00:36:13,838
Speaker 1: I like it.

638
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,520
Speaker 1: It's just really hard.

639
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,220
Speaker 0: It's beyond the amount of effort I would ever put into a video game ever.

640
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:18,570
Speaker 0: Yeah.

641
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,760
Speaker 1: I do have to say the one thing about Nanostray that made it really terrible, that if they would have fixed this, I would have been willing to pay like five bucks for it.

642
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:30,020
Speaker 1: Was that you couldn't, like normally, you can fly to the, anywhere on the screen.

643
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,479
Speaker 1: You use the arrows and you move.

644
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:35,060
Speaker 1: In Nanostray, like you can't fly to the corners.

645
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,140
Speaker 1: Like there would be items on screen in the corner and like the ship wouldn't go there.

646
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:39,628
Speaker 1: Ah.

647
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,560
Speaker 1: It was just really kind of painful to, uh, I don't know what they were thinking.

648
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,240
Speaker 1: Hopefully someone in the future will release like a really, really good space shooting for the DS.

649
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,020
Speaker 0: I want a really good space shooting for the DS that has wireless multiplayer.

650
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,125
Speaker 1: Yeah.

651
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,320
Speaker 1: Two people at once or two people against each other against or co-op or racing each other.

652
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,236
Speaker 0: There's so much you could do.

653
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:00,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

654
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,619
Speaker 0: Like Castlevania actually has you have to use both screens.

655
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:04,311
Speaker 0: Yeah.

656
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,300
Speaker 0: You don't need to use the touch screen.

657
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,518
Speaker 0: Developers get it in your heads.

658
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,379
Speaker 0: The touch screen's there if you want it.

659
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,797
Speaker 0: You don't have to use it.

660
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,220
Speaker 1: Yep.

661
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,739
Speaker 0: The microphone's there if you want it.

662
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
Speaker 0: You don't have to make every game have some stupid blow into me thing.

663
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,939
Speaker 1: Only use it if it makes sense.

664
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,740
Speaker 1: I mean, it makes sense for Nintendogs.

665
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,859
Speaker 0: Yes, it does.

666
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,519
Speaker 0: I call for my little dog and it comes over.

667
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:24,459
Speaker 1: It makes sense for Advance Wars to use the touch screen.

668
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,980
Speaker 0: Doesn't make sense to use the microphone to blow up a bomb in Bomberman.

669
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,900
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

670
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,760
Speaker 1: It would make sense if there was like a mini game like defuse the bomb and you're trying to blow up the fuse.

671
00:37:34,941 --> 00:37:36,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no, they didn't do that.

672
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,160
Speaker 1: No, they didn't do that.

673
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,738
Speaker 1: They made it stupid.

674
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:39,678
Speaker 1: All right.

675
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:40,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

676
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,120
Speaker 0: So it was Tuesday, so at least we got The Escapist.

677
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,039
Speaker 1: Oh, The Escapist.

678
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,739
Speaker 1: Better than every print video game magazine there is.

679
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:47,109
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,060
Speaker 0: Though the thing is, I read all but one of the articles and I didn't like any of them.

681
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,699
Speaker 0: But apparently, Scott says the one I didn't read is actually a good one.

682
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,680
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the past two escapist didn't really live up to the former glory.

683
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,620
Speaker 1: I can't believe I'm talking about former glory of a magazine that's only like 20 something issues.

684
00:38:02,801 --> 00:38:03,318
Speaker 0: Twenty three.

685
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but because some early escapists were just damn good.

686
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, the first two, I was just amazed.

687
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,099
Speaker 0: Like, wow, I would pay money for this.

688
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got this one.

689
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:13,938
Speaker 1: Actually, the ads are very nice.

690
00:38:14,662 --> 00:38:16,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw the Child's Play ad.

691
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, and no other ads, which is very nice.

692
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:27,600
Speaker 1: So the one article in there that I want to talk about was about these guys who collect like ultra rare unreleased video games stuff.

693
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:38,320
Speaker 0: God, this article read like like imagine like say you're a part of some sort of like indie subculture, like a creepy hidden kind of subculture that's not very big.

694
00:38:39,603 --> 00:38:41,639
Speaker 0: And someone decides they're going to write an article about you.

695
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:45,819
Speaker 0: And the only source they use is you talking about yourself and how awesome you are.

696
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:55,220
Speaker 1: And then they write it as if you were like glorifying you as like this great ancient master of amazingness who should be revered.

697
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,769
Speaker 0: Like this article was kind of painful to read, especially because the the people that is.

698
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:05,780
Speaker 1: knowing that people like this exist is always painful because really these are the people that I don't like.

699
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,240
Speaker 0: Basically, they're people who collect old like unreleased games that you can get like like a copy of a game that was never released for whatever reason.

700
00:39:13,381 --> 00:39:16,019
Speaker 0: And this is like the demo or the almost finished version or whatever.

701
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:33,380
Speaker 0: And these people seem to have this stupid subculture thing where they'll all trade with each other, but they have this code of ethics where you're never allowed to like publish the game on the Internet or give it to the heathens who don't want to understand it or talk about it or anything.

702
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I used to know people like in the early days of RIT when anime still wasn't digital yet.

703
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:47,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean, for all you who love digital fan subs, those are so recent, like those are a brand new thing.

704
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,680
Speaker 0: And when I was a kid, yeah, get off my lawn, you damn kids.

705
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:57,140
Speaker 1: Usually trade used to send blank VHS tapes to guys who would make you a copy and then send it back to you.

706
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,440
Speaker 0: And there was this whole code system of like how what generation the tape was and how good the subtitles were.

707
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:07,220
Speaker 0: Like if you got a master, that was like the holy grail of a fan sub.

708
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:18,360
Speaker 0: That meant someone had the laser disc from Japan and they used a genlock to make a to tape that to a VHS tape or an SVHS tape and put the subtitles in manually with this box.

709
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:20,880
Speaker 0: That was like worship.

710
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was like the great.

711
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Speaker 1: But anyway, there are people in those days who would like make a music, an anime music video and then not share it because they wanted to keep it to themselves.

712
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 0: They'd trade it to their other friend for a music video he made.

713
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,780
Speaker 0: And then they talk about how elite and awesome they were because they had these rare things that no one else in the world had.

714
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:51,040
Speaker 1: Or like they would get a new anime from Japan and they would subtitle it so that it could be watched, but they wouldn't give it to you unless you gave them a copy of a subtitled anime that no one else had.

715
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:54,339
Speaker 0: And if you gave something to someone else, they'd never talk to you again.

716
00:40:54,701 --> 00:41:05,280
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like they just feel good having things that no one else has, not, you know, caring about, you know, the many, many people who they're keeping information from.

717
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't care about the enjoyment they get or whatever.

718
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:09,260
Speaker 0: People are allowed to enjoy whatever they want.

719
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:09,955
Speaker 0: I'm fine with it.

720
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:20,800
Speaker 0: But philosophically, it bothers me when anyone would ever deign to either A, destroy information or B, hide information.

721
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:30,540
Speaker 0: I see those as just like, I'm not religious, I don't believe in gods that'll send me to hell or whatever, but that's pretty much as close to a sin as you can get with me.

722
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,280
Speaker 0: Destroying information is not cool.

723
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:34,641
Speaker 1: Definitely.

724
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:49,480
Speaker 1: I mean, it's bad enough that the game companies like abandoned these rare games, things like Missile Command 2 and, you know, like 3DO games that, you know, were canceled when the system died.

725
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:51,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a whole bunch listed in the article.

726
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,740
Speaker 1: Dev kits for Atari Jaguars that don't exist anymore.

727
00:41:55,242 --> 00:41:55,378
Speaker 0: Jaguar?

728
00:41:56,081 --> 00:42:03,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's bad enough that the companies tried to get rid of these things when, you know, they finished their company business.

729
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,480
Speaker 0: But if you find it, and you decide specifically to prevent other people from seeing it.

730
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:16,520
Speaker 1: I mean, think about what could happen if, you know, I mean, sure, okay, there is copyright law, you're not allowed to give these things up, you could get in trouble.

731
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:17,104
Speaker 0: You know what?

732
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:19,460
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ways to distribute things anonymously.

733
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you really cared and you really wanted to do good, you would get these things out on the net.

734
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:38,620
Speaker 1: I mean, the other thing is, is, okay, no matter how much assholes and how stupid these people are for keeping these games to themselves and denying a lot of people a lot of enjoyment by sharing them, which is what they should do.

735
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,420
Speaker 1: How can the game companies who legally own them aren't taking advantage of it?

736
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:51,500
Speaker 1: I mean, they have a thing, it could make them a lot of money with very little effort, and they just hold on to it, they don't do anything with it.

737
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,239
Speaker 0: I don't think they know that there's a market for these games.

738
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,539
Speaker 1: I think they know, I think they're just assholes.

739
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:04,840
Speaker 0: No, no company, except for Fox, with their Firefly debacle, is going to willfully deny themselves profit for no good reason.

740
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:32,600
Speaker 1: All they have to do, seriously, is make a site and say, "Rare ROMs downloads $1," and make a little system where if someone pays a dollar on their credit card, they can download a rare ROM of, you know, a dev kit for an NES, or a, you know, a game that didn't get made, or a broken MAME ROM of an arcade game that was destroyed, or some rare game that was only released in one store in Japan.

741
00:43:33,401 --> 00:43:39,817
Speaker 1: I mean, one of the things they talked about was the cartridges used for the NES World Championships that are going for like $6,000 on eBay.

742
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,720
Speaker 0: Just dump the ROM, and then we can all play it and enjoy it.

743
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,520
Speaker 1: I think you can actually get a ROM of that one, but, you know, similar things.

744
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:54,580
Speaker 1: You know, like the Atari Adventure quest for the, you know, what was it, the cup?

745
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:55,880
Speaker 0: Quest to avoid that duck?

746
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, quest to avoid the duck.

747
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:07,560
Speaker 1: When they have the contest to win, like, you know, the chalice and the sword and the whatever it was, and only the guy who won the chalice still has it, and everyone else, who knows?

748
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,556
Speaker 1: There's a story about it somewhere, but...

749
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:12,279
Speaker 0: Wow, that was probably as vague as you could ever be.

750
00:44:13,281 --> 00:44:16,020
Speaker 1: People know, if people know what I'm talking about, they know what I'm talking about.

751
00:44:16,201 --> 00:44:17,719
Speaker 0: I barely know what you're talking about.

752
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:17,980
Speaker 0: Well,

753
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:35,980
Speaker 1: I'll show it to you later, but anyway, there was a thing with Atari Adventure way back in the day where you could, if you did really good at adventure and you found clues that you would go somewhere, and you would play adventure, and whoever found the clues fast enough and solved it fast enough would win, like, these golden, like, amazing things.

754
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,940
Speaker 1: And they had, like, they were gonna have, like, four or five of them, and then whoever won the final final one would get, like, this crazy sword.

755
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:54,020
Speaker 1: And they ended up only having, like, two or three of them, and then they cancelled it, and no one knows what happened to the things, and, you know, it's kind of weird, and it's like a mystery, a cool video game history thing.

756
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:02,640
Speaker 1: But the cartridges they used for those are, like, these special versions of adventure, and, you know, those are the kind of rare things that need to be out.

757
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,344
Speaker 1: You know, people want to play that.

758
00:45:04,384 --> 00:45:05,407
Speaker 1: They want to see what it was.

759
00:45:05,768 --> 00:45:07,775
Speaker 1: Instead, it's like this complete secret mystery.

760
00:45:07,795 --> 00:45:09,100
Speaker 1: It shouldn't be.

761
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:11,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, information wants to be free.

762
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:12,286
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

763
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,146
Speaker 0: That sounds like a cliché.

764
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,456
Speaker 0: You hear it yelled on Slashdawd all the time, but you know what?

765
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:17,300
Speaker 0: It's true.

766
00:45:18,122 --> 00:45:21,120
Speaker 1: And, you know, you think, okay-- In the very least, information wants to exist.

767
00:45:21,561 --> 00:45:21,801
Speaker 1: Yup.

768
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:32,960
Speaker 1: And you might think, alright, well, they're actually trying to make more money this way, 'cause the longer they hold onto the information, and the later they release it, it'll be worth more money then, and they can get more money for it.

769
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,980
Speaker 0: But no, it's worth less.

770
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,104
Speaker 1: It's worth less, because then people forget about it.

771
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:42,716
Speaker 1: You know, as soon-- you gotta put it out quick to get the money before, you know-- I mean, how many people remember this shit now?

772
00:45:42,796 --> 00:45:44,800
Speaker 1: In ten years, no one's gonna remember or care about it.

773
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,979
Speaker 0: Like, imagine if you had a copy of, like, Kid Icarus Version 2 for the NES.

774
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:49,864
Speaker 1: Whoa.

775
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:51,480
Speaker 0: I don't think that even exists.

776
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,360
Speaker 1: I don't think so either.

777
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,226
Speaker 0: But let's say it did, and you had it, and you could play it.

778
00:45:55,727 --> 00:45:57,030
Speaker 0: Alright, great.

779
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:01,860
Speaker 0: A lot of people who are alive today would pay a lot of money for the privilege of playing that.

780
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:02,439
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

781
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,427
Speaker 0: Twenty years from now, no one's gonna remember who Kid Icarus was.

782
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:10,360
Speaker 0: It was a mediocre Metroid-like game from a long time ago that just didn't really do very well.

783
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:14,975
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, in twenty years, there might be just one guy who cares about it, and he'll pay a freakin' fortune.

784
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:20,920
Speaker 0: But I contend-- No, 'cause the one guy who cares already has his one copy that he's hiding from everyone in his mom's basement.

785
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,981
Speaker 1: Like, one of the things they were talking about was that they might have some kind of copy of, like, Mother 3.

786
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:29,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that.

787
00:46:29,108 --> 00:46:30,920
Speaker 0: I was kinda dubious of that claim altogether.

788
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,240
Speaker 1: That they can't get to work, or they might be able to get to work if they can find some rare hardware.

789
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:38,019
Speaker 1: And these guys are working together to be able to play it.

790
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,020
Speaker 1: But there are people who've been waiting for that kind of game for ages and ages and ages and ages.

791
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:50,320
Speaker 1: And it's really not fair for you to just, like, hold on to that and play it and not share.

792
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and for those who don't know, Mother is Earthbound.

793
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,162
Speaker 1: Yeah, Earthbound.

794
00:46:54,423 --> 00:47:03,140
Speaker 1: So it's basically Earthbound 2, which people have been clamoring for more Earthbound-- Well, it would be Earthbound 3, because there's Earthbound for the NES that wasn't released in the US.

795
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Earthbound is actually the name of the SNES.

796
00:47:06,771 --> 00:47:09,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a Final Fantasy-type numbering thing where it's all messed up.

797
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's 1 and

798
00:47:10,783 --> 00:47:11,305
Speaker 0: 2. 1

799
00:47:11,305 --> 00:47:13,051
Speaker 0: was for the NES, it was never released here.

800
00:47:13,051 --> 00:47:16,060
Speaker 0: 2 was released, and it was called Earthbound, instead of Mother.

801
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:25,120
Speaker 0: If you haven't played them, and you like RPGs, these are probably the longest and probably-- they're definitely in the top 10 of old-school RPGs.

802
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:34,160
Speaker 1: Even if you don't like RPGs, it's so great, because when the enemies are, like, the random encounters, at a certain point you're powerful enough, and you just automatically win.

803
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:35,102
Speaker 1: It's great.

804
00:47:35,746 --> 00:47:37,840
Speaker 1: It's not, like, painful like some of the other ones.

805
00:47:38,061 --> 00:47:40,700
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of old-school Nintendo-type humor.

806
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,560
Speaker 1: Oh my god, there's more just wacky humor in there than you can imagine.

807
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,420
Speaker 0: Like, if you like the humor in Paper Mario or Mario RPG, you'll friggin' love Earthbound.

808
00:47:50,641 --> 00:47:52,480
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, this is exactly the same kind of crap.

809
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,539
Speaker 0: I mean, enemies include, like, moving lamps and dirty hippies.

810
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:05,820
Speaker 1: I love the first part where you go to the arcade, and there's the bad kids there, and you beat 'em up, and there's, like, a pinball machine.

811
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:07,679
Speaker 0: My favorite part was with the cultists.

812
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,239
Speaker 1: The cultists!

813
00:48:09,421 --> 00:48:09,956
Speaker 0: The cultists.

814
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:10,597
Speaker 1: Cultists.

815
00:48:11,842 --> 00:48:13,220
Speaker 0: So, that's about all we have for today.

816
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:18,000
Speaker 0: We had more, but we've been talking a long time, and we don't want to make the podcast go too long.

817
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,560
Speaker 0: Nope.

818
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,639
Speaker 0: But just a few little meta bits.

819
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,559
Speaker 0: One, the forums are exploding again.

820
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:32,090
Speaker 1: Mainly because of our yesterday's podcast, where we talked-- where we said that you're pretty much dumb if you buy a computer more than $400.

821
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:32,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:33,539
Speaker 1: People didn't like that.

823
00:48:33,781 --> 00:48:37,820
Speaker 0: Keep it coming, and if you haven't joined the forums yet, join the forums, go to the website.

824
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:41,520
Speaker 0: The community is growing at a pretty good clip.

825
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying to-- I might get rid of comments on the front page and just limit it to forums.

826
00:48:48,561 --> 00:48:52,560
Speaker 1: So, try to-- if you're gonna-- if you want to talk about something, try to stick to the forums.

827
00:48:53,160 --> 00:49:01,140
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm gonna try to make it so that each thing on the front page has a link that goes into the forums to the associated discussion.

828
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:10,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly, we love that you guys want to comment, but on the front page, we were thinking now we want to use the comments more for stuff about that episode.

829
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:13,838
Speaker 0: Like, "Scott was sick," or "Here's a clarification on a

830
00:49:13,878 --> 00:49:14,120
Speaker 0: point.".

831
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:21,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very hard to have a discussion in the comments in the front page blog area, because it's not threaded or anything.

832
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:21,495
Speaker 1: Yeah.

833
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:25,660
Speaker 1: And in the forums, it's much easier for people to check and for everything to stay organized.

834
00:49:26,302 --> 00:49:30,840
Speaker 1: You know, in the blog comments, it doesn't really work so well for discussion.

835
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,977
Speaker 1: So, I might close it or limit it.

836
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,260
Speaker 1: So, everyone sign up for the forums.

837
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,180
Speaker 1: I know they're not-- they might not be the forums you're used to, but they're actually really cool.

838
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you get used to them, they're great.

839
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:43,197
Speaker 1: Everyone seems to like it.

840
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,060
Speaker 1: You know, I was kind of unsure of it at first, but no one's complained.

841
00:49:46,782 --> 00:49:47,640
Speaker 1: So, that's way cool.

842
00:49:49,141 --> 00:49:51,600
Speaker 1: And remember, we're all-- we're still looking for more feedback.

843
00:49:52,501 --> 00:49:58,100
Speaker 0: And if you send us audio feedback, since we haven't gotten any yet, you're fairly likely to be on our show at some point.

844
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:16,360
Speaker 1: So, either send an attachment or a link to an audio file to geeknights@gmail.com, or you can call our phone number, 206-333-1537, and record a voicemail, and I will get that voicemail and be able to play it on the podcast.

845
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:17,378
Speaker 0: All right.

846
00:50:18,204 --> 00:50:19,440
Speaker 0: So, we out.

847
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,176
Speaker 1: Peace.

848
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:20,329
Speaker 1: Peace.

849
00:50:27,563 --> 00:50:29,660
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

850
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,259
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

851
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:33,800
