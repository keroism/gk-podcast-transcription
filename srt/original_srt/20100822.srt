1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,078
Speaker 0: It's Monday August 23rd on rim.

2
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:20,117
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight tech zealotry and the canoe heard Let's do this.

3
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,854
Speaker 0: So Scott would you consider yourself a computer expert?

4
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:35,280
Speaker 1: I am indeed a computer expert perhaps in the 99th percentile.

5
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:36,545
Speaker 0: I am the world.

6
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:37,909
Speaker 0: I would tend to agree with that too.

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:38,391
Speaker 0: to a point.

8
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,258
Speaker 0: I mean we're tech professionals in New York.

9
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:50,380
Speaker 0: so Scott When you connect to a wireless network, and it doesn't work Why is your first instinct to tell me my wireless network that I am connected to just fine is broken?

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,397
Speaker 1: Because I pushed all the buttons that would normally repair a wireless network, and it didn't wait.

11
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:56,300
Speaker 0: so you use the windows.

12
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:57,547
Speaker 0: I don't know what I'm doing.

13
00:00:57,648 --> 00:00:59,720
Speaker 0: fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it button.

14
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,574
Speaker 1: But I also I also restarted the entire computer and did that work?

15
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,239
Speaker 0: no so then what fixed it?

16
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:12,129
Speaker 1: Flicking the switch on the side of the laptop that turns the radios actually off for reals Looking it again.

17
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:13,860
Speaker 0: so some sort of problem with your laptop.

18
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:21,675
Speaker 0: Not a problem with my perfectly fine Wireless network because I'm an IT problem did not happen at my house with the exact same laptop.

19
00:01:21,735 --> 00:01:23,600
Speaker 1: therefore the problem was in your router.

20
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:29,095
Speaker 0: Yes, my router somehow required you to reset the radio on your wireless car.

21
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:29,737
Speaker 1: that is correct.

22
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:34,586
Speaker 1: It was an evil router with evil waves Through the air.

23
00:01:34,707 --> 00:01:35,954
Speaker 1: so I did evil.

24
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:46,024
Speaker 0: all that aside Promised At least in the forum that tonight at the metabit we would actually announce the musical act for the penny arcade expo Friday night Late show.

25
00:01:46,045 --> 00:01:46,988
Speaker 1: why are you saying this now?

26
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:48,915
Speaker 1: It's not the medevit because people might be wondering.

27
00:01:48,956 --> 00:01:50,120
Speaker 0: I'm not actually going to announce it.

28
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,548
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that I'm going to announce it.

29
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,722
Speaker 0: It was that it was a meta meta bit Metabits going.

30
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:58,837
Speaker 1: the reason we have the meta moment is we don't want meta, so it's can't.

31
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,063
Speaker 0: no meta We don't want.

32
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,752
Speaker 0: I agree a hundred percent, but meta meta.

33
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:03,220
Speaker 1: We don't want any amount of meta.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,430
Speaker 1: Minimize all metas no matter how many metas there are.

35
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:06,972
Speaker 1: so can it.

36
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,979
Speaker 0: but meta meta is very different.

37
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,011
Speaker 1: No, it is not is exactly the same.

38
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:12,117
Speaker 1: save it for the meta moment.

39
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:13,064
Speaker 0: Not now I am.

40
00:02:13,084 --> 00:02:14,460
Speaker 0: I am saving the meta for the meta moment.

41
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:16,878
Speaker 1: also the meta meta.

42
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:24,580
Speaker 1: Thou shalt save us to all metas despite the exponent for the meta moment.

43
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:28,292
Speaker 0: All right, so I guess we should talk about the news.

44
00:02:28,473 --> 00:02:31,892
Speaker 0: since I can't talk about my meta stuff I don't have any opening bits whatsoever.

45
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:32,356
Speaker 1: It's raining.

46
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:34,485
Speaker 1: all right Woman, it's raining.

47
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:36,433
Speaker 0: She got some woman really woman.

48
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:36,935
Speaker 1: No.

49
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:40,005
Speaker 1: It's just raining I Guess I guess Poseidon.

50
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,594
Speaker 0: so you can talk about the Heliums.

51
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:42,780
Speaker 1: I'll talk about the Helium.

52
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:47,620
Speaker 1: So apparently there's this guy who is and he says he's an expert on helium.

53
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:54,708
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he is an expert on helium, but he is saying I don't feel like editing my voice.

54
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:57,840
Speaker 1: He's actually a Nobel Prize winning physicist, so he's smart.

55
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,406
Speaker 1: I'll spare you all.

56
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:06,959
Speaker 0: I was gonna just like edit this and make us sound really high-pitched And that idea Felt really stupid right away, so I didn't do it.

57
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,751
Speaker 1: That's good because usually you think those ideas are not stupid.

58
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,719
Speaker 1: your judgment is is getting clear.

59
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:15,460
Speaker 1: Anyways, he is a very smart person.

60
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,158
Speaker 1: He says you're running out of helium and the problem is that a we need helium for many things.

61
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,405
Speaker 1: for example We need it for MRI machines.

62
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:25,432
Speaker 1: Yep, and we need it for rockets.

63
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,900
Speaker 0: We need it for balloons and funny voices.

64
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:29,452
Speaker 1: Yes, we need it for many things.

65
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:30,380
Speaker 1: that is very needed.

66
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,228
Speaker 0: But so where do we get helium from?

67
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:32,529
Speaker 0: Scott?

68
00:03:32,589 --> 00:03:35,020
Speaker 1: we get helium from rocks under the ground.

69
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:38,080
Speaker 1: It's apparently only in a certain geological situation.

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,392
Speaker 1: We're like this salt and a certain kind of rock.

71
00:03:40,432 --> 00:03:42,723
Speaker 1: you can extract helium from it But it kind of sucks.

72
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:51,280
Speaker 0: now the worst part is I will admit straight up until I saw this article I'd never even considered where helium came from because it's in the grocery store.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,980
Speaker 0: We waste it like crazy, so I just never thought that it was trouble to get helium.

74
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,447
Speaker 0: Otherwise why would it just be wasted?

75
00:03:57,467 --> 00:04:03,880
Speaker 1: all the other thing is with helium right as soon as you let go of it Not only does it go in the air, but you can't really get it out of the air easily.

76
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,594
Speaker 1: Why cuz it goes up in fact not above everything.

77
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:07,720
Speaker 0: It does not just go up.

78
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:11,558
Speaker 0: I read that law goes into space go into space and are gone.

79
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:15,495
Speaker 0: Yep I guess we could mine some gas giant for its helium.

80
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:16,519
Speaker 1: right, but anyway.

81
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:28,217
Speaker 1: So you know when we use helium is gone That's it and we get it out of the rocks and once it's out of the rocks It's gone, and the problem is is that the United States had this gigantic helium reserve.

82
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,779
Speaker 1: ah very clever Because we have strategic reserves of all kinds of crazy elements.

83
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,318
Speaker 0: yep I mean we have the oil reserve partly because to date there is no electric fighter jet.

84
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:37,800
Speaker 1: yeah.

85
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:42,580
Speaker 1: So we have this strategic reserve of various elements and one of the elements he has cheated reserve of his helium.

86
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,880
Speaker 1: But there was an order.

87
00:04:43,981 --> 00:04:50,960
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it was a law or something But it basically they have to sell off the helium reserve all of it by a certain date.

88
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,830
Speaker 1: So they're selling helium like crazy.

89
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,740
Speaker 1: so the price is a wicked low.

90
00:04:55,683 --> 00:05:01,362
Speaker 1: But when that runs out there isn't gonna be a lot of helium and like a helium balloon for your birthday party is probably like $100.

91
00:05:01,362 --> 00:05:04,120
Speaker 0: so rim seems really short-sighted.

92
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:15,800
Speaker 1: Well, it does if it's true, but you brought up the fact that well the people trading the commodities markets They know all this information, so how come the commodities the helium futures aren't crazy way high now?

93
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:26,017
Speaker 0: This is why I'm dubious because at the same time reading all the physics and the science and the mining behind it I don't doubt that it's gonna be very difficult to this guy's a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

94
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:26,920
Speaker 1: this sounds right to me.

95
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:34,520
Speaker 0: I also kind of disagree with Selling off a strategic reserve or something like that because I feel like I think it's too late on that.

96
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,859
Speaker 1: It's already been done.

97
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,066
Speaker 0: Well we could undo that.

98
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:38,132
Speaker 0: unless we could hold it all.

99
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:39,620
Speaker 1: stop and keep what we haven't sold.

100
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,319
Speaker 0: I think we should and then maybe start buying up more or at least keep what we've got left.

101
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, about 80% of the world's reserves are in the u.s.. Southwest the u.s.. National helium reserve located in amarillo, Texas.

102
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,085
Speaker 0: Why don't we just go over there with a drill?

103
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:57,086
Speaker 1: a recently passed law has ruled the reserve must be sold off by 2015 Regardless of market price.

104
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:59,033
Speaker 0: that seems like a terrible law.

105
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:01,360
Speaker 1: who made that law and what were they thinking now?

106
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,951
Speaker 0: Maybe it costs so much.

107
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,120
Speaker 1: Maybe it was some reserve.

108
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:10,759
Speaker 1: Maybe it was companies that needed helium to be cheap like people making MRIs That lobbied for that law.

109
00:06:10,981 --> 00:06:17,048
Speaker 0: Maybe it was just pork to cut down on the spending there and to sell it off and bolster the budget with the pittance that We're gonna get from it.

110
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:17,755
Speaker 1: I don't know.

111
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:18,180
Speaker 0: I don't know.

112
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,945
Speaker 0: I I don't like the.

113
00:06:20,045 --> 00:06:21,369
Speaker 0: without respect to the market.

114
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,218
Speaker 0: a better law would have been hire a bunch of experts and Their job is to make the most money off of the helium reserve over the next 40 years.

115
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,920
Speaker 1: But you could possibly make even more money if you didn't pay the experts.

116
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:44,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time maybe the experts gonna do better than the market price of a quantity where you own all of it If I own all of it, and I say I'm gonna sell all of it kids.

117
00:06:45,014 --> 00:06:46,220
Speaker 1: It's a beer situation.

118
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,103
Speaker 1: It might see.

119
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:47,945
Speaker 1: two beers is smart.

120
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:49,470
Speaker 1: They keep all the fucking diamonds.

121
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:54,989
Speaker 1: if they just opened up the vault and let the diamonds out It would be diamonds like a dollar.

122
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,320
Speaker 1: But yes, but because they hold on to the diamonds They make such mad bank.

123
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,940
Speaker 1: If you got a big stock of something like helium and you're a government that is in debt You shouldn't be just opening the fucking vault.

124
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:12,560
Speaker 0: You should be selling that for a high price like the beers unless you know that the vault is not as valuable as everyone else.

125
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,560
Speaker 0: Is full of water or you have some other or dirt like maybe for example.

126
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:18,244
Speaker 0: We don't know.

127
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,874
Speaker 0: but helium is what attracts.

128
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:26,470
Speaker 0: I don't know earthquakes or aliens or Phalons, yeah, my dad's we don't know you and your bathroom.

129
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,192
Speaker 1: It is good.

130
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:28,357
Speaker 0: That is a really good word.

131
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:28,999
Speaker 0: It's perfectly.

132
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,445
Speaker 1: listen We have plenty of bath.

133
00:07:30,465 --> 00:07:31,308
Speaker 1: My dad's in the bath.

134
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:31,931
Speaker 1: My dad reserved.

135
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,160
Speaker 1: I think we do the clue that the price is very low.

136
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:34,662
Speaker 1: We're good.

137
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:38,160
Speaker 0: So this is now to qualify this one.

138
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:48,151
Speaker 0: I do not speak on behalf of anyone other than myself - while I work in the equities markets, I do not work in options or futures or Commodities or anything like that.

139
00:07:48,211 --> 00:07:59,528
Speaker 0: I have no expertise there but in general I would assume that if this were terribly solid research that People would be investing in this.

140
00:07:59,628 --> 00:08:02,636
Speaker 1: they would buy the helium, but they would buy in long.

141
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:03,980
Speaker 1: you wouldn't want to buy a short future.

142
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,400
Speaker 1: They would buy the long futures like 30-year futures, right?

143
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,006
Speaker 1: You know, which is?

144
00:08:09,147 --> 00:08:12,218
Speaker 1: I buy helium now, but you give me the helium in 30 years.

145
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,260
Speaker 0: There's also the possibility of buying real commodities of buying the helium or buying the helium.

146
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:33,400
Speaker 0: The problem with buying the helium is I know I'm well aware of all the problems But the one trouble with buying just futures and commodities and all that is that you know What if the time when we run out of helium is the time when Mad Max happens?

147
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,187
Speaker 1: It says here 25 to 30 years.

148
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:40,610
Speaker 1: actually remember how it always asked the one question about commodities Like if you buy hogsheads, do you actually get the hogshead?

149
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found the answer you did.

150
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:42,980
Speaker 0: What's the answer?

151
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:44,590
Speaker 1: It's depending on what you buy.

152
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:56,559
Speaker 1: There's like a time limit and If you don't do certain things by the time limit you basically you have to accept shipment somehow Like someone's gonna try to ship them to you and you have to like get to deal with it.

153
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:58,806
Speaker 0: You buy and sell a stock.

154
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:02,519
Speaker 0: You've got three days to clear and to actually give each other the stock.

155
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:11,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like if you if you don't like, you know resell your commodity or something like that You're actually going to take shipment of wheat or whatever the fuck it is you bought.

156
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:13,497
Speaker 1: Yeah, well imagine the thing is these commodities.

157
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:17,280
Speaker 1: guys Basically, they have to do everything that possibly can to avoid that.

158
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:25,015
Speaker 1: So oftentimes when a whole bunch of people are gonna take shipment real soon They'll just fucking sell it off at like some low price cuz they got.

159
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:26,602
Speaker 1: no they don't have warehouses They don't have.

160
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,072
Speaker 1: what are they gonna do with some fucking barrels of oil?

161
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,899
Speaker 1: They like shit get the hell out of here.

162
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:35,739
Speaker 1: You know sometimes you see the price is moving because of dates on people and stuff like that.

163
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,128
Speaker 0: But regardless, I don't know.

164
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:39,051
Speaker 0: This is a broader issue.

165
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:49,080
Speaker 0: I don't know if we really want to get into the whole idea of Technological strategic reserves or the fact that every resource on the earth until we can mine space is finite.

166
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:50,405
Speaker 1: Carbon is is.

167
00:09:50,827 --> 00:09:51,951
Speaker 1: I think we're okay.

168
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can get carbon pretty easy if we need it.

169
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,978
Speaker 1: I don't think we're worried about nitrogen either.

170
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:01,659
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking but it does take energy to compress nitrogen and do stuff with it.

171
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the nitrogen it's so easy and cheap compared to for now because we have you know, basically free.

172
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:10,640
Speaker 1: I don't think we have a shortage of photons either any time in the near future.

173
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not that good at harvesting them though.

174
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,740
Speaker 1: No, but I get harvesting there is dead.

175
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,031
Speaker 1: Oh, there's definitely really good harvesting.

176
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:18,579
Speaker 0: no shortage of your mom.

177
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:25,939
Speaker 0: So in something closer to home because silly voices are one thing.

178
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:29,891
Speaker 0: but bloggers Blogging is the most important thing ever.

179
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,380
Speaker 0: At least that's what bloggers told us.

180
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:35,640
Speaker 0: But an issue came up story on slashdot.

181
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:51,708
Speaker 0: I'll skip the details But basically there was this rabble about the fact that due to poorly written laws about business and such It appears that a blogger in Philadelphia who makes approximately five point five dollars a year From ads on her blog gross

182
00:10:51,848 --> 00:10:55,640
Speaker 1: Yig nights forum ad which is just one stupid ad makes more than that.

183
00:10:56,081 --> 00:11:16,477
Speaker 0: so she made five dollars and fifty cents a year gross not net off of her blog because she had some ads and Being a dutiful citizen this person reported it as income, you know other income on the tax form Like if Scott gives me 20 bucks and there's something where I reported This is some income 20 bucks and you just pay taxes on bad

184
00:11:16,538 --> 00:11:17,020
Speaker 1: move.

185
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:22,146
Speaker 0: So because she reported this Philly in Pennsylvania said oh, wait a minute.

186
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,540
Speaker 0: You have to pay $300 to incorporate to have a license to operate a business.

187
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,639
Speaker 0: So basically what it'd be cheaper to stop carrying the ads and not make the five bucks.

188
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:37,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, just turn the ads off and then it's no longer a business, right?

189
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,007
Speaker 0: So How are we in this situation?

190
00:11:40,027 --> 00:11:43,540
Speaker 0: I mean, this is not a situation where someone is running an illicit business.

191
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:53,753
Speaker 0: this is a situation where someone has a hobby and their hobby happens to generate a Trivial amount of money five bucks that doesn't even buy lunch in Midtown.

192
00:11:53,893 --> 00:12:00,331
Speaker 0: Nope, unless you buy that hot dog from that guy You can buy like five of that guy's hot dogs.

193
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,539
Speaker 1: maybe go at five water bottles, maybe.

194
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:03,162
Speaker 0: yeah You can buy.

195
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,009
Speaker 0: but no, they're those like two packs of gum.

196
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,078
Speaker 0: It depends on the gum fancy gum.

197
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:10,271
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, well, I mean think about this, right?

198
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:16,620
Speaker 1: This isn't just a case of Technology getting ahead of you know, the law as is so common, right?

199
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,476
Speaker 1: It's a case of actual society getting ahead of the law, right?

200
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:27,297
Speaker 1: I mean Back in the day would anybody for example open up a deli just for fun.

201
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:28,439
Speaker 1: I'm gonna open up a deli.

202
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,109
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna try to make money.

203
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,020
Speaker 1: In fact, if I lose money, I don't even give a shit.

204
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,628
Speaker 1: I just like running a deli.

205
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:46,080
Speaker 1: It's my hobby and in my spare time when I get home from work You know for an hour here and there I'll open up my deli and make sandwiches for fun And I'll just give the sandwiches away for free really now and I'll be maybe a donation jar and I'll get a buck a week.

206
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,616
Speaker 0: Now we're gonna skip all the kind of food safety regulation of that.

207
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:53,872
Speaker 1: Okay, fine I open up a dry cleaner cuz I just loved cleaning fucking clothes.

208
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:54,815
Speaker 1: And you know what?

209
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:56,200
Speaker 1: I just clean clothes for fun.

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,167
Speaker 1: I don't charge anyone money to do it.

211
00:12:58,227 --> 00:13:02,810
Speaker 1: I just do it cuz I like to at random hours once in a while Yep, but suddenly we're.

212
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:03,940
Speaker 1: nobody would ever do that.

213
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,560
Speaker 0: Suddenly we're in a world where some people run a blog as they're living.

214
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,654
Speaker 0: Some people run a blog not as they're living but as a business.

215
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:16,191
Speaker 1: they're incorporated there Different groups of people both engaging in the exact same activity.

216
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:19,580
Speaker 1: some are doing it as they're living and some are doing it for fun.

217
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:29,920
Speaker 1: Before like this decade or before like the 90s There was nobody doing things just for fun that other people were doing for work.

218
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,760
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe there are some people like, you know writing a book for fun But they wouldn't make even a penny off of it if they didn't get a publisher.

219
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,740
Speaker 1: But now someone can write a book for fun put it on the internets and make some dollars.

220
00:13:43,021 --> 00:13:45,397
Speaker 1: I mean, there's without actually engaging in real business.

221
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:45,780
Speaker 0: Here's one.

222
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:47,730
Speaker 0: Here's one thing that I see brought up a lot.

223
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:49,720
Speaker 0: So say I write software for open source.

224
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:53,595
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe that should be considered charity if I'm just writing it for fun.

225
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,006
Speaker 1: I don't know Is it?

226
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,100
Speaker 1: I mean, it's charity usually when you give to a specific group.

227
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,549
Speaker 1: But what if I just give something to the world?

228
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:09,377
Speaker 1: is that charity like if George Lucas just says, you know Star Wars public domain does he'd get up like a billion dollars tax deduction.

229
00:14:09,397 --> 00:14:10,019
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

230
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:16,440
Speaker 0: no Yeah, but we're in a world now where there are a lot of people who are creating actual value.

231
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,139
Speaker 0: They're creating tangible real value in the world and they don't expect to make money off of it Or they don't even try to make money off of it.

232
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:29,920
Speaker 0: But yet because of the secondary problem of the ease of making very small amounts of money.

233
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:34,877
Speaker 0: I mean, it would literally take me like 20 clicks and I'd have to type like 15 words.

234
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:39,120
Speaker 0: And I've got Google AdWords on my blog and I make like a dollar.

235
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:40,788
Speaker 1: It's probably been less than that.

236
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,160
Speaker 0: Should I have to register that as a business?

237
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,180
Speaker 1: Did you have to pay $300 to register that as a business?

238
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,969
Speaker 0: I feel like there's an easy way around this but the only way we'll get there is if maybe all the old people die or Government wise is the fuck up.

239
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,700
Speaker 1: The thing is the government doesn't want to wise up.

240
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,505
Speaker 1: They want to force all these people to pay 300 bucks each Thing.

241
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,668
Speaker 0: that the only reason.

242
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,099
Speaker 0: this is an issue and there are things like this happening all over the country.

243
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:12,020
Speaker 0: now Some city or some state or some county doesn't have enough money and they find none of them have name one that has enough money.

244
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:15,250
Speaker 1: Uh Bridgeport, Connecticut, they don't have enough money.

245
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,616
Speaker 0: I think they have enough money.

246
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:17,499
Speaker 0: What can't they do?

247
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:18,722
Speaker 1: Anything?

248
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:21,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had a lot of scandals and recent years and things.

249
00:15:22,364 --> 00:15:27,687
Speaker 0: So, all right regardless of all that so Forgot what I was gonna say.

250
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,120
Speaker 1: their place is all over looking for money.

251
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:37,068
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so states right they want money and they find a law that says, you know Technically women can't cut their hair on a Tuesday.

252
00:15:37,088 --> 00:15:41,500
Speaker 0: So they go around finding all the barbers cutting women's hair on Tuesday.

253
00:15:42,243 --> 00:15:44,372
Speaker 0: It'll take a while to strike that law off the books.

254
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:46,280
Speaker 0: They're gonna make as much money as they can in the interim.

255
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:52,200
Speaker 0: So what do you do when you have a legislature or a government that has a vested interest in?

256
00:15:52,522 --> 00:16:14,459
Speaker 0: Enforcing a law that itself puts forth No value to society other than drawing a revenue stream and in fact will harm the thing It's drawing the revenue stream from and the money it's going to get is basically gonna force all these bloggers to not file Do not pay and to not even report the income this woman paid Legitimate income tax on this and the city basically said you know what?

257
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,520
Speaker 0: Because we want you to pay the $300 you're never gonna file again and we're gonna get zero dollars.

258
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:28,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's like You know, isn't this a government that's supposed to be representative of the people but really it's adversarial?

259
00:16:28,337 --> 00:16:34,398
Speaker 1: in this situation the people are just trying to go about their business and the government is trying to just come and take money from the people.

260
00:16:34,418 --> 00:16:39,405
Speaker 1: and If you had like a referendum on any of these laws Nobody would agree.

261
00:16:39,586 --> 00:16:43,581
Speaker 1: not as I don't think a single person would say yeah some blog that made $11.

262
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:46,210
Speaker 1: Not a single intelligent sane person who was literate.

263
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:49,080
Speaker 0: but at the same time we got referenda legitimate.

264
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:50,814
Speaker 1: That wasn't an old person.

265
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:55,588
Speaker 1: let's say $11 blog should have to pay a $300 registration.

266
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:59,620
Speaker 0: referenda sis are dangerous because a lot of people want very stupid things.

267
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:06,619
Speaker 1: well, no, but I'm saying is a Referendum on that specific thing, but what like a referendum on cutting hair on Tuesday?

268
00:17:06,741 --> 00:17:10,420
Speaker 1: Not a single person except someone making a joke would vote that you shouldn't be allowed to cut hair.

269
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:13,390
Speaker 0: What if enough hipsters vote ironically and then it passes anyway?

270
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,252
Speaker 1: pictures don't vote.

271
00:17:14,272 --> 00:17:16,440
Speaker 1: They didn't even do the census worthless.

272
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,887
Speaker 0: so This is the tip of the iceberg.

273
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:22,337
Speaker 0: What are we gonna do 40 years from now?

274
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:22,858
Speaker 0: when?

275
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,394
Speaker 0: Technology has gotten to the point to where we won't make it 40 years.

276
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:28,021
Speaker 1: We're only making it maybe 25 You know what?

277
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:30,154
Speaker 0: Let's make it two years from now.

278
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,200
Speaker 1: What are they gonna do?

279
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,323
Speaker 0: I don't think we're gonna be.

280
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:34,916
Speaker 1: fine is basically gonna be just these kinds of problems.

281
00:17:35,257 --> 00:17:43,020
Speaker 0: times 10 Yeah, but what's gonna happen I think is This is part of the reason why I had such trouble setting up e-commerce because every time I go to do something.

282
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,854
Speaker 0: I find three paths in front of me the right way from a personal perspective.

283
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:50,040
Speaker 0: Don't file anything hide at all.

284
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,945
Speaker 0: It's probably the safest option.

285
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:57,260
Speaker 0: middle road file like the legitimate stuff like just alright on my taxes.

286
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,833
Speaker 0: I'm we're gonna make this money, but we're not gonna incorporate.

287
00:18:00,215 --> 00:18:05,620
Speaker 0: the real way Incorporate lawyer accountant the real way removes all our profits right now.

288
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,945
Speaker 0: So there's no way I'm gonna do that.

289
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:16,987
Speaker 0: the the easy way the right way for my personal perspective Sets me up for legal liability if anyone ever catches me and I'm basically breaking the law flag.

290
00:18:17,007 --> 00:18:18,513
Speaker 0: really the middle road.

291
00:18:18,754 --> 00:18:21,733
Speaker 0: do what the law says but get fucked anyway Because the laws are too complex.

292
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,085
Speaker 0: Yep So it sucks.

293
00:18:24,165 --> 00:18:26,978
Speaker 0: Basically, I gotta find someone else to do all this for me who doesn't want money.

294
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:32,419
Speaker 1: Okay, you just set it up in my name as if it's a business that is entirely run by me.

295
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,483
Speaker 0: You want me to do that?

296
00:18:33,543 --> 00:18:34,728
Speaker 0: You want to take all the liability?

297
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,333
Speaker 1: I already have all the payment accounts.

298
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:39,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do so Whatever yeah.

299
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:54,328
Speaker 0: Anyway, all that I just I feel like we're gonna hit some sort of crossroads because we've got a society now where a lot of people will generate a Surprising amount but still at the same time a fairly trivial Revenue or income from their hobbies.

300
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:57,620
Speaker 0: the average hobby that is creative can make money.

301
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:00,048
Speaker 0: I mean look at all the people in an artist's alley.

302
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,419
Speaker 0: Most of them just lie on that form or don't fill out the tax form.

303
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:13,804
Speaker 0: People we know didn't pay sales taxes because it's such a pain in the ass and if you try to do it and do it Wrong, you're fucked more than if you just don't do it They should.

304
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:20,876
Speaker 1: the thing is they government would be much better off if they did it for you But you know what the cost of doing it for you makes it unprofitable for them.

305
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:21,600
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

306
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,059
Speaker 0: But what about when we had?

307
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 0: Announced originally when they said we should let people file online?

308
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:29,840
Speaker 0: The plan was the government will give you a website.

309
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:32,818
Speaker 0: You can just do your fucking back there and that's the end.

310
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:36,105
Speaker 1: and People other countries have it.

311
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:41,080
Speaker 0: Yes, but there was a huge lobby from people like HR block saying no that would destroy our business.

312
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,125
Speaker 1: It would destroy their business.

313
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:45,420
Speaker 0: Yes, and as a result, we don't have the ability.

314
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:51,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what the thing is when the government looks at something like that, you know Congress or whoever.

315
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:53,305
Speaker 1: they say Well, look H&R block.

316
00:19:53,345 --> 00:19:56,816
Speaker 1: is this big company, you know into it with just turbo tax?

317
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:58,000
Speaker 1: is this big company, right?

318
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:02,500
Speaker 1: If we make this law those companies go out of business and it will create this much unemployment.

319
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,327
Speaker 1: This is the reason.

320
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,980
Speaker 1: see economists have this strange idea.

321
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:13,400
Speaker 1: They keep thinking that the the fact you know Everyone always worried that technology would create huge unemployment as computers are placed and it always did in the interim.

322
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,048
Speaker 1: Well, no, the thing is they would always.

323
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,540
Speaker 1: if you ask any economist will say no, that's not true.

324
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:18,940
Speaker 1: That hasn't panned out historically.

325
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:27,167
Speaker 1: it hasn't panned out historically because there have been legal blockades preventing it from doing so or Because the incompetence has prevented it from doing so.

326
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:38,860
Speaker 1: you could if technology was actually used properly and there weren't laws propping up businesses You would see massive unemployment due to companies just disappearing because they're not needed anymore.

327
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,600
Speaker 0: But at the same time I would argue look at what happened during the Industrial Revolution.

328
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:46,933
Speaker 0: there was mass unemployment and all sorts of social problems that then worked themselves out.

329
00:20:46,973 --> 00:20:55,718
Speaker 0: because the I think it's kind of a corollary to the broken windows fallacy because the broken windows fallacy is the idea that if you break a window You create jobs.

330
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:59,610
Speaker 0: That's a simple way of putting it because you know Someone's got to pay to replace the glass.

331
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:09,229
Speaker 0: you make a job for the glass maker and other But at the same time if the window hadn't been broken in the first place all those people could theoretically go do something productive Instead of fixing something broken.

332
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:19,039
Speaker 0: if technology was used in the right way I think in the end what would happen is all the jobs that were lost will be recreated in Brand new value add to the world.

333
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:21,411
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is they would all be.

334
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,236
Speaker 1: what kind of job?

335
00:21:22,256 --> 00:21:22,900
Speaker 0: I don't know.

336
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:23,986
Speaker 0: I think we need.

337
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:30,540
Speaker 0: the thing is I don't think propping up Bad old archaic businesses is the right way to go about it.

338
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,063
Speaker 1: so in the short term We're gonna create a.

339
00:21:32,243 --> 00:21:39,479
Speaker 0: you're gonna create the massive economic problems and get blamed for it and get you know What that has happened at every major juncture of technology in history?

340
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Speaker 0: So now it's only you know what this is like forest fires.

341
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:48,500
Speaker 0: Remember there were forest fires every now and then and one day human said you know what let's prevent forest fires.

342
00:21:48,781 --> 00:21:53,220
Speaker 0: And then there is big fucking forest fires because we let it build up too long.

343
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:56,317
Speaker 1: Instead of having a bunch of little ones we had a few big ones.

344
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,506
Speaker 1: yep Then we couldn't even stop because they were too big.

345
00:21:58,627 --> 00:22:02,280
Speaker 0: but regardless even if there would you know this is a political question.

346
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,270
Speaker 0: This is an ideological question, which should we do Scott?

347
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:15,540
Speaker 0: I'm going to ask you personally if our options are thus option one Continue to leave the laws in this situation as they are for bloggers and maintain some sort of a feeling.

348
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,725
Speaker 1: You're about to present me with a false dichotomy of course - all right, let's go with the taxes.

349
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:22,814
Speaker 0: should we have a net loss to society?

350
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:31,751
Speaker 0: from the ideological standpoint of government services should be free and not tied to the private sector and Force people to force the government not force the government.

351
00:22:31,771 --> 00:22:42,279
Speaker 0: the government should make a site where you can just do your taxes And they'll do it for you because it's a boon to society on the ideological standpoint that if they're gonna force you to do The taxes they shouldn't force you to go through a private company.

352
00:22:43,102 --> 00:22:48,097
Speaker 0: Or do we prop up the private company monopoly on this bullshit and not create that public boon?

353
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:59,208
Speaker 0: because of a short-term Pragmatic economic solution to the fact that we have more people who need work than we have work to do we should simultaneously Unit for the trigon approach.

354
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:01,035
Speaker 0: Let's try to do everything in fail.

355
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:06,274
Speaker 1: No we should simultaneously create the e-trade you know e-file thing you know.

356
00:23:06,314 --> 00:23:10,556
Speaker 1: put those companies out and Find something new for those people to do all right.

357
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:10,999
Speaker 0: like what?

358
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:15,272
Speaker 1: Like Maybe rebuild our infrastructure gonna be porn stars.

359
00:23:15,372 --> 00:23:17,300
Speaker 0: that porn stars good and make money.

360
00:23:17,642 --> 00:23:19,211
Speaker 0: But I don't think anyone disagrees that.

361
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:25,660
Speaker 0: regardless of any other rationale I think there should be some sort of like trivial business license that you can get from the government.

362
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,727
Speaker 0: It should be a federal thing.

363
00:23:26,827 --> 00:23:36,180
Speaker 0: even if you make less than like $5,000 a year from some thing whatever it is you can file something and then that's it like one piece of paper.

364
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,709
Speaker 1: That's as easy as like the easy.

365
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,177
Speaker 1: You know tax form.

366
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:51,469
Speaker 1: yeah It should be like the 1040 in corporation for hobbies like you put in the name of your business you put in your name and address and your security number and the date Can't write anything off.

367
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:53,200
Speaker 0: you get no tax benefits whatsoever.

368
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,460
Speaker 0: But and any money you make you just get taxed at your income tax rate based on your tax bracket.

369
00:23:58,842 --> 00:23:59,284
Speaker 1: And that's it.

370
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:03,265
Speaker 1: That's it, and if you may start making more money in fact the way it works No, here's how it should work.

371
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:03,868
Speaker 1: you ready for this?

372
00:24:03,969 --> 00:24:08,650
Speaker 1: yeah any money that the business makes The that you're the company that you form.

373
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:12,832
Speaker 1: you gave a w-4 to yourself And it just counts as your income, and that's it.

374
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:17,000
Speaker 0: you don't even need to do w-4 You just have to file it as income for you from hobby.

375
00:24:17,761 --> 00:24:21,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean if you know it could eat with the w-4 it could show that it came from your company like.

376
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,818
Speaker 1: so I don't think you need to take likes But it would take out the appropriate social security and such and such and such.

377
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,900
Speaker 0: yeah Do we want to even involve social security in a guy who has a blog that makes five dollars a year?

378
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,218
Speaker 1: Hey, why not be like two cents?

379
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:33,418
Speaker 1: They need money.

380
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:34,946
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

381
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:36,054
Speaker 0: the math will get screwed up.

382
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:36,920
Speaker 0: It'll be like six bucks.

383
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:38,279
Speaker 1: No, because the computer would do it for you.

384
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,700
Speaker 0: Oh the computer because our government is so good at using computer.

385
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,022
Speaker 1: You just say how much money your hobby made and it would go And it print out the w-4.

386
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:54,740
Speaker 0: you'd be so things of the day.

387
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,442
Speaker 0: What do you got?

388
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:58,754
Speaker 1: so this is probably way old, but I just discovered it.

389
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:00,862
Speaker 1: so screw you anyone who says It's old.

390
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,370
Speaker 0: you've given me shit before for using something old.

391
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,350
Speaker 1: if you know what this is and you've seen it before then You can give me shit all right.

392
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:10,400
Speaker 0: so prepared shit loaded all right.

393
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,067
Speaker 0: So you know load it into wolf cannons.

394
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:14,035
Speaker 1: You know one of our favorite websites laugh at rice.

395
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:17,314
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's been a while since I've been to laugh at rice.

Speaker 1: Oh my god.

00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:35,787
Speaker 1: These cars are these stupidest cars imaginable, so it's not just racers I cannot even be.

402
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:36,009
Speaker 1: no.

403
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:43,115
Speaker 1: This is just you drive what and you Just you go through some of these and it is.

404
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:46,614
Speaker 1: it is just ludicrous Ludicrous all over the place.

405
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:47,420
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

406
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:51,324
Speaker 1: Again, my little pony car Fucking to me.

407
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,190
Speaker 0: my little pony car is pretty badass.

408
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:55,317
Speaker 1: too many vans attached to each other.

409
00:25:55,417 --> 00:26:03,820
Speaker 1: It's like a still 80 like fucking Action like McDonald's kids meal toys just glued to all over the car, okay?

410
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,764
Speaker 0: That's kind of creepy.

411
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:15,283
Speaker 1: There's it's just the craziest most screwed up cars You've ever seen in your whole life one with like a zebra lady painted on the back I mean, I don't even know.

412
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:26,640
Speaker 0: wait wait wait a zebra lady like a furry like a. I don't know what that is.

413
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:31,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, so just go to this site, and you could be entertained literally for days on end.

414
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:38,060
Speaker 1: it'll take you to look at all of these ridiculous cars and Yeah, all right.

415
00:26:38,982 --> 00:26:43,735
Speaker 0: So the Empire State Building is the tallest building in New York City.

416
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:45,820
Speaker 1: however now it is well.

417
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:56,191
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of argument about the fact that someone plans to build another tower that is not as tall as the Empire State Building, but is Close to it.

418
00:26:56,372 --> 00:27:00,247
Speaker 0: It is like 67 stories 1200 feet tall.

419
00:27:00,668 --> 00:27:04,439
Speaker 0: it's gonna be a little bit shorter than the Empire State Building and it's gonna be nearby it.

420
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:09,315
Speaker 0: So the guy who owns the Empire State Building was basically like you can't build this.

421
00:27:09,556 --> 00:27:10,880
Speaker 0: it'll ruin the Empire State Building.

422
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,448
Speaker 0: It'll ruin the New York City skyline.

423
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:13,473
Speaker 0: everybody hates it.

424
00:27:13,975 --> 00:27:15,000
Speaker 0: No one should build this building.

425
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,431
Speaker 0: It should be like a quarter the size what it should be.

426
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:17,994
Speaker 1: double the size.

427
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,380
Speaker 1: make as big as you can yeah.

428
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,625
Speaker 0: And the guy who's building it.

429
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,758
Speaker 0: and there's this kind of piss fight between these guys in New York.

430
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,765
Speaker 0: luckily The vote is going to be tomorrow and by Wednesday.

431
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:28,707

00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:30,630
Speaker 1: Hey check this out.

434
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:40,820
Speaker 1: I say yes to all buildings.

435
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:41,543
Speaker 0: I do too.

436
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:44,113
Speaker 0: the thing is this building looks pretty cool and less.

437
00:27:44,153 --> 00:27:45,980
Speaker 1: the building actually looks like a penis.

438
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:50,840
Speaker 0: It looks pretty cool, but this is why I think the Empire State Building guy sucks one.

439
00:27:51,663 --> 00:27:56,178
Speaker 0: The Empire State Building is only taller than the Chrysler Building because they built that little penis on top of it.

440
00:27:56,238 --> 00:27:56,700
Speaker 1: That's correct.

441
00:27:56,861 --> 00:27:58,185
Speaker 0: It's done, and then on top.

442
00:27:58,206 --> 00:28:01,979
Speaker 0: There's that little penis, and then the penis has like a long penis off of it.

443
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,706
Speaker 0: Yep, so this new building.

444
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:06,016
Speaker 0: I'm looking at pictures of them side by side.

445
00:28:06,056 --> 00:28:07,000
Speaker 0: There's like an artist mock-up.

446
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,906
Speaker 0: It looks really cool for one.

447
00:28:08,926 --> 00:28:13,540
Speaker 0: It's like this shiny glass, and it doesn't have a penis on the top.

448
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:15,445
Speaker 0: No penis at all.

449
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:20,427
Speaker 0: and if you look at it next to the Empire State Building And you take away the Empire State Building's penis.

450
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,278
Speaker 0: It's taller than the Empire State Building pun.

451
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, I So hope they build this building.

452
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:26,328
Speaker 0: I mean

453
00:28:26,348 --> 00:28:36,874
Speaker 1: I like the Empire State Building, but it's you know from everything I've heard and I've heard a story of like a salesman who tried to sell like a keyboard tray to the guy who built it Or something you know the guy who runs the company that originally built it.

454
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:37,457
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

455
00:28:37,538 --> 00:28:37,940
Speaker 0: Is he a dick?

456
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it seems like all the people who run the Empire State Building are dicks, but it's an awesome building.

457
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:44,145
Speaker 1: But you know what I got?

458
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:46,900
Speaker 1: no, but what do they care if someone else builds another building?

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,468
Speaker 1: It's like I hate just all nimbys and bananas.

460
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:54,042
Speaker 1: you have no say over what the fuck someone else wants to build on their land Near you.

461
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:58,420
Speaker 1: I mean people in neighborhoods like complaining about oh you put that ugly house in the same street as me.

462
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,429
Speaker 1: It's like what the fuck do you care?

463
00:29:00,449 --> 00:29:01,715

00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,112
Speaker 1: Well, this is 100% right that it's going to be in the.

591
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:44,159
Speaker 1: what's the name of the theater?

592
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,110
Speaker 0: The bear is something I don't even have it up.

593
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:53,956
Speaker 1: It's gonna be in Benaroya Hall Which is a. it's like a concert hall down the road where the symphony plays much like how Otacon.

594
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:56,620
Speaker 0: because their stuff is too big They put it in the arena next door.

595
00:34:56,781 --> 00:35:01,200
Speaker 1: So the main events of PAX West are gonna be in Benaroya Hall, which is this place of the symphony plays.

596
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,352
Speaker 1: So I assume it's gonna be all seats and not a general admission.

597
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:05,877
Speaker 0: It also only seats like 2,500 people.

598
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,712
Speaker 1: Yes, the concerts can be pretty sad because you're not gonna be able to stand really.

599
00:35:11,073 --> 00:35:15,160
Speaker 0: I'll stand on my chair right anyway I'm in a beanbag anyway.

600
00:35:16,682 --> 00:35:27,396
Speaker 1: So they're gonna give out exactly 20, you know The number of wristbands equal to the number of seats for you know The the concerts and of course many people will get wristbands and not show up.

601
00:35:27,536 --> 00:35:28,480
Speaker 0: I've done that before.

602
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:37,520
Speaker 1: Yes, so I'm sure that some people will be allowed in without wristbands But I doubt many and I can't Gary I cannot promise you that you will get in without a wristband.

603
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,979
Speaker 0: But none of this is really news.

604
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,931
Speaker 1: No The news is.

605
00:35:41,032 --> 00:35:47,388
Speaker 1: well, it's not really news but it is advice if you don't have the wristband right and You know and let's say it's not.

606
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:51,059
Speaker 1: if it's a Q&A and you want to ask a Q You probably want to get there.

607
00:35:51,200 --> 00:36:03,853
Speaker 1: But if you just want to watch the keynote or you just want to see the concert and relax They are supposedly going to simulcast Everything in Benaroya Hall in the Q room in the Convention Center on a screen.

608
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:13,200
Speaker 1: so you could just chill in that Q room and Watch all the main events of PAX without having to walk down the street and lose a bunch of time waiting in line or dealing.

609
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:20,274
Speaker 0: so I get in line for event A. While I am in line, I watch event B simulcast from the hall.

610
00:36:20,675 --> 00:36:23,924
Speaker 0: then I immediately go to event A Mm-hmm.

611
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:26,000
Speaker 0: How have I at any point wasted my time?

612
00:36:26,842 --> 00:36:27,245
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

613
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:29,300
Speaker 0: I've gotten double awesome, that's right.

614
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:41,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, so take full advantage of these simultaneously cast main events in the Q room because you can avoid you know Spending time doing walks between the main, you know, the Convention Center and the Benaroya Hall and you could play games.

615
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:48,816
Speaker 1: You know, you can't play a game during a concert if you're in the concert hall But you could play a game in the Q room while the concerts are going on.

616
00:36:48,856 --> 00:36:49,620
Speaker 1: How awesome is that?

617
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,948
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that'd be fucking.

618
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,834
Speaker 0: let's think of this.

619
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:52,580
Speaker 0: we're getting to the point.

620
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Speaker 0: I mean they have entertainment in the Q room which already pushed packs like well above and beyond any other.

621
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,439
Speaker 1: Entertainment is also the main events.

622
00:37:01,882 --> 00:37:12,080
Speaker 0: It's gonna get to the point to where there are people who I could almost foresee Spending their entire con in events or in the Q room because the Q room also has its own like exclusive entertainment.

623
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,577
Speaker 0: We might be screening the late show there at one point.

624
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:16,940
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, all sorts of stuff goes out in there.

625
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,646
Speaker 0: There's that line entertainment the games.

626
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:23,244
Speaker 0: the Q room is an event in and of itself that is worth standing in line For.

627
00:37:23,566 --> 00:37:25,519
Speaker 0: will we someday have a Q room for the Q room?

628
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,301
Speaker 1: That'd be so.

629
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:30,034
Speaker 0: will we have the Q room be simulcast into the QQ room?

630
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:35,051
Speaker 0: The whole convention will be one room And parts of it simulcast into other rooms.

631
00:37:35,412 --> 00:37:36,055
Speaker 0: It's just a loop.

632
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:37,160
Speaker 1: now everyone on their phone.

633
00:37:37,301 --> 00:37:40,579
Speaker 1: It'll be a hundred cameras and you could pick which camera you want to look at in the room.

634
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:43,308
Speaker 0: All right, I guess that's enough.

635
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,353
Speaker 0: meta near comic-con.

636
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:45,579
Speaker 0: New York anime festival, October 8th.

637
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,136
Speaker 0: We're doing crazy shit there, but you'll will announce that as it gets closer.

638
00:37:49,156 --> 00:38:02,480
Speaker 1: All right, so Basically, I don't know this topic is sort of a. I guess it'll be an okay topic But it is not a mystery to anyone that it's a secret to everybody Yeah that there are fanboys in the world, but especially in the realm of technology.

639
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:08,260
Speaker 1: In fact, it was pretty much invented in the realm of technology because you know, the internet started out with technologists.

640
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:13,420
Speaker 0: So anything that happens argue the first fanboys you remember 12 Byzantine rulers?

641
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:19,500
Speaker 0: Okay, I I would argue that those debates about religion back then were basically fanboy arguments.

642
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:24,260
Speaker 0: yes, maybe so but is is Do you have to roll a 15 or an 18?

643
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,405
Speaker 1: The thing is on the internet right.

644
00:38:25,425 --> 00:38:27,554
Speaker 1: the first blogs were about technology.

645
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:32,667
Speaker 1: the first, you know Podcasts on pod, you know, we're about technology.

646
00:38:32,747 --> 00:38:41,500
Speaker 1: everything that's on the internet is always about technology first because the internet is technology and technologists Are the first people to take advantage of any of the new technology?

647
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:46,819
Speaker 1: so whenever there is a new technology the first instances of that new technology are about technology.

648
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:54,200
Speaker 1: and When these people who are about technology discuss technology they are often fanboys or zealots.

649
00:38:54,642 --> 00:39:04,970
Speaker 1: They pick a thing and then every other thing But the thing that they like is a shitty thing and their thing is better than everyone else's thing and it could be a programming Language, it could be a piece of software.

650
00:39:05,211 --> 00:39:07,360
Speaker 1: It could be an operating system, which I guess is a piece of software.

651
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,243
Speaker 1: It could be a hardware.

652
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,668
Speaker 1: It could be a hardware brand.

653
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:13,180
Speaker 1: It could be a software an open source license.

654
00:39:13,662 --> 00:39:14,507
Speaker 1: It could be anything.

655
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,838
Speaker 0: it's weird how specific these things get.

656
00:39:16,878 --> 00:39:17,200
Speaker 0: sometimes.

657
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,780
Speaker 0: I mean you might see like the Apple fanboy and think like yeah, look at our rabbit that guy Those guys aren't even on the radar.

658
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I have like.

659
00:39:24,546 --> 00:39:32,651
Speaker 0: have you ever spoken to like a new herd Linux kind of person you Correct you every time you say Linux.

660
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:34,740
Speaker 0: they will say it's GNU Linux.

661
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:39,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's GNU Linux like a summon won't even talk to you if you call it just plain old Linux.

662
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:47,344
Speaker 0: I mean, these are people who have focused on something so specific and are so like it is their entire life As far as I can tell.

663
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:53,788
Speaker 0: and it's weird because you don't see this in popular Culture on the internet as much as you used to.

664
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,360
Speaker 1: because those people because other people have made things on the internet.

665
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:05,818
Speaker 1: They're now podcasts about things other than technology Websites that are about things that are like remember remember slash shot like seven eight years ago.

666
00:40:06,922 --> 00:40:10,300
Speaker 0: There is a lot more of that there and it's kind of falling away.

667
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,294
Speaker 0: I don't know if those people have just they're on reddit.

668
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:15,245
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, basically.

669
00:40:15,406 --> 00:40:20,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz reddit has all the it's like, you know It's like a million digs because they have specific categories for everything.

670
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,280
Speaker 1: So you can go like the reddit just for a particular programming language and they'll be just just things for that You know.

671
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,550
Speaker 1: So that's where you find the fanboys and even people.

672
00:40:28,791 --> 00:40:29,896
Speaker 1: there'll be people who are like.

673
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:30,700
Speaker 1: they're both use it.

674
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,380
Speaker 1: They're both fans of the same programming language, but they'll argue about like two different libraries.

675
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:38,668
Speaker 1: You know, they're like, oh no.

676
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,414
Speaker 1: No, you must use this framework.

677
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:41,900
Speaker 1: No, this framework is superior.

678
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,840
Speaker 0: Now the trouble is this I think is holding back open technology more so than any other factor in the world.

679
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:49,468
Speaker 0: It's not man-hours.

680
00:40:49,508 --> 00:40:50,291
Speaker 0: We need to spend.

681
00:40:50,332 --> 00:40:52,100
Speaker 0: it's not like direction or design.

682
00:40:52,541 --> 00:41:04,020
Speaker 0: I think it's primarily that we have these weird divisions in almost all open software and open anything development Because people become zealots and they refuse to compromise on what I would argue are really stupid things.

683
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:08,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like I'll see two people arguing about a particular thing, right?

684
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:17,280
Speaker 1: Maybe they're arguing about like JavaScript libraries so one guy like jQuery and the other guy likes prototype or moo tools or one of the other ones.

685
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,602
Speaker 0: So it's got.

686
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:26,100
Speaker 0: we're intelligent, you know, we're gonna debate that I use jQuery because of X and Y. All right, I use moo tools because of X and Y, you know If you use jQuery for Z, it's actually faster.

687
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:31,580
Speaker 1: If you change your program to use Z, you know moo tools is easier to write because it's all friendly and such.

688
00:41:31,841 --> 00:41:40,499
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, well, I'm gonna keep using jQuery cuz it's faster for Z. No, you should use moo tools Jake I thought we were gonna discuss it like smart people should discuss it not for zealots.

689
00:41:43,443 --> 00:41:46,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's like first of all, why do you care what the fuck other people use?

690
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,145
Speaker 1: What do you care?

691
00:41:48,165 --> 00:41:49,671
Speaker 1: what the fuck other people use right?

692
00:41:49,751 --> 00:41:51,819
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess I don't know the answer to that.

693
00:41:52,162 --> 00:41:52,789
Speaker 0: Here's one case.

694
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,779
Speaker 0: All right at my work, right?

695
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,512
Speaker 0: We have a couple of guys who use Perl for all their kind of scripting.

696
00:41:57,552 --> 00:42:00,484
Speaker 0: like you got to bang out something quick for some Monitoring or something.

697
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:01,409
Speaker 0: they use Perl.

698
00:42:01,831 --> 00:42:02,916
Speaker 0: the rest of us use Python.

699
00:42:02,936 --> 00:42:04,283
Speaker 0: It's like 50/50.

700
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:04,524
Speaker 0: I can.

701
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:12,739
Speaker 0: I would rather the Perl people use Perl or use Python Because I'm better at Python and if I have to change their shit or reuse it, it's easy for me.

702
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:16,715
Speaker 0: But if they want to use Perl, I'm not angry.

703
00:42:16,816 --> 00:42:17,398
Speaker 0: It is not like.

704
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:23,213
Speaker 0: this somehow Bothers me outside of the specific inconvenience that causes me in the code.

705
00:42:23,815 --> 00:42:25,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like it's it works.

706
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,205
Speaker 1: So I'm being paid.

707
00:42:26,265 --> 00:42:28,740
Speaker 1: So what do I care that you're paying me for my time?

708
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:33,320
Speaker 1: I mean if I'm doing something on my own, I mean obviously I most cases I'm a programmer.

709
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,086
Speaker 1: I do have a preference right.

710
00:42:35,246 --> 00:42:39,440
Speaker 1: usually or you know, sometimes I don't care but usually I have at least a slight preference.

711
00:42:39,922 --> 00:42:42,093
Speaker 1: So I'll pick what I want when I'm doing it on my own.

712
00:42:42,415 --> 00:42:45,172
Speaker 1: if I'm doing it for work I don't care what the fuck it is.

713
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,239
Speaker 1: I'm being paid to do it.

714
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:53,640
Speaker 1: So whatever it is that they want I'll do it and you know if there's like I might work There's basically one person who cares and no one else cares.

715
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,449
Speaker 1: So that person just picks everything and you know what.

716
00:42:56,971 --> 00:43:02,611
Speaker 1: if another person were to join the team who also cared it would be Probably a big problem, but I don't care.

717
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:03,354
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

718
00:43:03,374 --> 00:43:04,257
Speaker 1: You don't like this one.

719
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:05,040
Speaker 1: We'll use that one.

720
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,370
Speaker 1: Okay, it's not any more trouble for me to use something different.

721
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,440
Speaker 1: They're all pretty much the same and equal.

722
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:11,206
Speaker 1: I still prefer the other one.

723
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:13,092
Speaker 1: I might disagree but it's work.

724
00:43:13,473 --> 00:43:13,995
Speaker 1: I don't care.

725
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:15,299
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna fight about it.

726
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:16,062
Speaker 1: What?

727
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:16,625
Speaker 1: what's the?

728
00:43:16,785 --> 00:43:19,900
Speaker 1: it'd be more trouble to fight about it than to use the different one?

729
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,040
Speaker 0: Yep, but yet in the open-source world like the fighting becomes like its own thing.

730
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:36,829
Speaker 0: I mean people fight to the point that even to this day Ubuntu You know they don't do a lot of things that would make Ubuntu a lot more usable because they're worried about purity Purity of the license purity of the open.

731
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:40,280
Speaker 1: money back to Ubuntu is is less pure than all the other ones.

732
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, we won't use Ubuntu because it's not pure.

733
00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:43,856
Speaker 1: I've run into those people so impure.

734
00:43:43,876 --> 00:43:50,611
Speaker 1: I mean good You can't use that but you gotta use Debian or whatever fuck Debian doesn't do it Kind of sucks.

735
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:57,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like look You know I'm all about open source miss right and I know some people who refuse to use anything.

736
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,810
Speaker 1: That's not open source right, but at the same time.

737
00:44:00,353 --> 00:44:02,300
Speaker 1: I got an iPhone, but I like open source.

738
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,423
Speaker 1: Why do I have this iPhone?

739
00:44:03,463 --> 00:44:04,185
Speaker 0: iPhone works better?

740
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:05,349
Speaker 1: I just works better.

741
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:09,983
Speaker 1: You know I it's not like I'm some you know Fundamentalist.

742
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:12,049
Speaker 1: I must follow this rule in all cases.

743
00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:13,172
Speaker 1: do I prefer open source.

744
00:44:13,212 --> 00:44:15,680
Speaker 1: Yes, I prefer things that work more.

745
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:21,660
Speaker 1: I would rather have one device that does the work of two devices and actually works and doesn't crash.

746
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:23,833
Speaker 1: I would prefer it to be open source.

747
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:28,331
Speaker 1: that made me very happy But I'm willing to sacrifice that thing in favor of another thing.

748
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:32,167
Speaker 1: and if someone else prefers the open source more What do I care?

749
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:33,154
Speaker 1: it doesn't bother me.

750
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:33,840
Speaker 0: there was a guy?

751
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:37,014
Speaker 0: I was working on something at IBM and his thing like the.

752
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:38,280
Speaker 0: it was the Aladdin license.

753
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,887
Speaker 1: I think oh guys the worst.

754
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,218
Speaker 0: he was trying to convince me because I made some jokes.

755
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:49,485
Speaker 0: I was look I was doing a research on all the licenses that were encumbering and A bunch of open stuff we were about to use in a project I was writing up a report on.

756
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:51,251
Speaker 0: here are the license concerns.

757
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:56,004
Speaker 0: if we do X with Y and Z you know the standard like IT Programmer kind of stuff for a big company.

758
00:44:56,586 --> 00:45:03,191
Speaker 0: and this guy I made an off-handed joke in the meeting like and this uses the Aladdin license Yeah, and the guy got really mad.

759
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:05,985
Speaker 0: He's like don't make fun of the Aladdin license in fact I think everything.

760
00:45:06,025 --> 00:45:07,773
Speaker 0: and he like went off on this crazy grant.

761
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,420
Speaker 1: this guy actually knew it the Aladdin license.

762
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:14,667
Speaker 0: Not only did he knew no canoe I. I could have made a joke.

763
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:16,317
Speaker 0: not only did he know but he can do.

764
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:19,437
Speaker 0: Scott stood up.

765
00:45:19,457 --> 00:45:20,585
Speaker 0: He's far away from his microphone.

766
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:21,350
Speaker 0: I can say whatever I want.

767
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:32,029
Speaker 0: There's nothing he can do about it, but the guy like not only did he know about the Aladdin license He cared about it really really strongly and was insulted that I had been flippin.

768
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:34,769
Speaker 0: in fact That's the word he used flippin about the Aladdin license.

769
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:35,811
Speaker 1: What?

770
00:45:35,891 --> 00:45:37,777
Speaker 1: what was his argument for this Aladdin license?

771
00:45:37,797 --> 00:45:39,161
Speaker 0: He didn't have an argument.

772
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:42,370
Speaker 0: Oh his argument was basically about like purity and stuff.

773
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,249
Speaker 0: He's one of those new herd kind of people mm-hmm He actually did.

774
00:45:45,852 --> 00:45:52,673
Speaker 0: He is the basis of almost all of my feelings about these people because he corrected me more than once and said uh you're forgetting The GNU tool.

775
00:45:52,693 --> 00:45:54,663
Speaker 0: said without that the Linux would just be a kernel.

776
00:45:54,925 --> 00:45:55,869
Speaker 0: He always called it the Linux.

777
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:06,404
Speaker 0: All right, yeah, whatever it was an anecdote doesn't really go anywhere from there, but mm-hmm And it was some like postscript thing that I had to use.

778
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:07,810
Speaker 0: the Aladdin license that I was looking at.

779
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:10,373
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what?

780
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:11,676
Speaker 1: what do you think there is any?

781
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:22,210
Speaker 1: I mean there's my standard internet solution for for people who are fanboys Which is you know - I think younger programmers, which is creativity always wins, right?

782
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:28,690
Speaker 1: So if you've got people arguing about some software some they're on they're both worked in an open source project community, right?

783
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,510
Speaker 1: So they're both Linux kernel developers, right and they're arguing which way you should do something.

784
00:46:33,671 --> 00:46:34,997
Speaker 1: You just come in write the code.

785
00:46:35,078 --> 00:46:35,882
Speaker 1: productivity wins.

786
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:36,685
Speaker 1: I wrote the code here.

787
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:37,027
Speaker 1: It is.

788
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:37,570
Speaker 1: Here's the patch.

789
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:44,983
Speaker 1: You know, I did the way I wanted to and the other two guys just arguing Well, you're gonna win cuz you actually did the work and it's the dude, bro.

790
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,449
Speaker 1: It's the same lesson, right?

791
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:50,837
Speaker 1: productivity Creativity always wins over arguing.

792
00:46:50,897 --> 00:46:56,198
Speaker 0: I mean, alright, so I did the thing that makes Ubuntu awesome, but it's not 100% pure It's not included in Ubuntu.

793
00:46:56,238 --> 00:46:56,861
Speaker 0: and I got a fork.

794
00:46:57,303 --> 00:47:00,477
Speaker 0: All right, so big deal No one's gonna follow my fork and then it dies.

795
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then my changes are lost.

796
00:47:03,067 --> 00:47:03,829
Speaker 0: I coded for nothing.

797
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:12,470
Speaker 1: No, you know, that's that's The thing is if you if you really want it right you have to do enough work.

798
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:15,770
Speaker 1: There's a. there's an amount of work you have to do to actually make it succeed.

799
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:22,695
Speaker 1: You keep at it to the point at which you've actually got a distribution That's you know Like better than Ubuntu.

800
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,482
Speaker 1: people will just start leaving it and come over to you.

801
00:47:24,502 --> 00:47:25,245
Speaker 1: look at like mint.

802
00:47:25,325 --> 00:47:30,010
Speaker 1: mint is an Ubuntu based Linux distribution and quite a lot of people use that instead of Ubuntu.

803
00:47:30,211 --> 00:47:42,045
Speaker 0: I think over time the problem is going to solve itself, but in a way that kind of sucks my personal feeling By observing younger people who are coming into tech and like new workers and companies and things.

804
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:43,650
Speaker 0: is that younger?

805
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:50,450
Speaker 0: Generations don't give a shit about most of this and their zealotries are so much more superficial than the old zealotries.

806
00:47:50,692 --> 00:48:04,192
Speaker 0: I mean the old zealotries would come down to Surprisingly esoteric and specific things where people would make very Very like real mathematical arguments for one of the other or they would argue about like the lineage of GNU and the toolset and all This stuff.

807
00:48:04,653 --> 00:48:10,695
Speaker 0: but now most younger zealots are zealous about some sort of very meta Abstract thing like.

808
00:48:11,297 --> 00:48:13,323
Speaker 0: I like a GUI versus a command line.

809
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:15,390
Speaker 0: I like Mac versus Windows.

810
00:48:15,531 --> 00:48:16,915
Speaker 1: Well, that's a general problem.

811
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:20,950
Speaker 1: I think in all of our society is people taking their preferences, right?

812
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:28,429
Speaker 1: You know if someone says I prefer GUI to command-line it's like alright cool whatever dude, but people will be like.

813
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:29,976
Speaker 1: This doesn't have a GUI.

814
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:30,478
Speaker 1: It sucks.

815
00:48:30,498 --> 00:48:31,182
Speaker 1: You shouldn't use it.

816
00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:33,393
Speaker 0: Well, it's like the correct answer Is it so?

817
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:34,741
Speaker 0: you're me and people like me?

818
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:35,425
Speaker 1: Yes, you are.

819
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:44,906
Speaker 1: you are misconstruing your personal preference for an Objective measure of something Scott and I could never be caught doing no ever ever.

820
00:48:44,986 --> 00:48:46,694
Speaker 0: whether that has never happened you know.

821
00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:54,470
Speaker 1: and the thing is I think actually the Technology itself is is to blame for a lot of this in the olden days, right?

822
00:48:55,371 --> 00:49:03,504
Speaker 1: If you had like, you know some old computer like a pdp-11 or something, right, you know olden days They were pretty much objective measures of what was better.

823
00:49:03,545 --> 00:49:04,770
Speaker 1: This uses less memory.

824
00:49:05,272 --> 00:49:08,264
Speaker 1: This is uses three less instructions to execute.

825
00:49:08,304 --> 00:49:09,469
Speaker 1: it goes faster, right?

826
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:15,010
Speaker 1: Because everything was so low-level you didn't really you know, whatever it was better was better.

827
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:17,190
Speaker 1: There was objective measurements of almost everything.

828
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:17,893
Speaker 0: That's kind of the point.

829
00:49:17,933 --> 00:49:18,617
Speaker 0: I was making the.

830
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:22,034
Speaker 0: the zealotries now are more superficial and there's no order They can make.

831
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:28,406
Speaker 1: the computer is so fast that you know Some people are still working on that level and are still have these objective differences.

832
00:49:28,587 --> 00:49:32,080
Speaker 1: and you know Sometimes those things actually don't like Linux kernel.

833
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,068
Speaker 1: That's that kind of thing still happens a lot.

834
00:49:34,108 --> 00:49:37,077
Speaker 1: Aha My algorithm is more efficient.

835
00:49:37,138 --> 00:49:45,990
Speaker 1: Okay, it wins right but at the same time You know, most arguments are not on that low objective level of computing.

836
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:58,456
Speaker 1: They're on some way up high level where they're not even measuring what's actually faster You know or what actually takes, you know, and the thing is, okay It takes an extra megabyte for my option But you know what.

837
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:03,630
Speaker 1: who gives a shit because I have four gigs of RAM So who cares that it takes an extra megabyte if it's better?

838
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:10,860
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing because the zealotries are not working in a cell phone are more Superficial and they're more kind of opinion-based.

839
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:13,350
Speaker 0: They don't really have the same strength.

840
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:20,590
Speaker 0: I mean find the most zealous Apple fanboy you've ever seen and their arguments don't get that much far beyond.

841
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:22,374
Speaker 0: My platform is better.

842
00:50:23,176 --> 00:50:23,978
Speaker 0: It looks better.

843
00:50:24,419 --> 00:50:25,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there is.

844
00:50:26,264 --> 00:50:28,168
Speaker 1: there are some cases though that I think.

845
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:39,150
Speaker 1: The problem is that people Like I wrote a blog post sort of about this right which is people have no problem like modifying their computer, right?

846
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:39,793
Speaker 1: It's like I don't.

847
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:41,018
Speaker 1: I have a problem girl.

848
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,425
Speaker 1: It's not matching my preference.

849
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:45,588
Speaker 1: So they change their computer They'll change the Dvorak keyboard or something, right?

850
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:50,067
Speaker 1: Whereas, you know and then they go to another computer and it's not the same way girl, right?

851
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:57,006
Speaker 1: I learned my lesson like in the late to that, you know three or four years ago Don't change a computer at all.

852
00:50:57,491 --> 00:50:59,679
Speaker 1: Just change your own damn self, right?

853
00:50:59,699 --> 00:51:02,410
Speaker 1: Because it's a lot easier to change yourself than it is to change the computer.

854
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,574
Speaker 1: It's a lot less time-consuming.

855
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:05,861
Speaker 1: I can use like in any computer.

856
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:11,130
Speaker 1: and the thing is, you know, you might argue Well, I have this I have this preference, right?

857
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,665
Speaker 1: And you might try to say it's objectively better or not.

858
00:51:14,705 --> 00:51:16,192
Speaker 1: Maybe you have an argument Maybe you don't

859
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:17,375
Speaker 0: but you

860
00:51:17,436 --> 00:51:32,270
Speaker 1: might recognize that someone else is doing something in a particular way and you know Objectively that your way is perhaps easier or more efficient and you can actually you know Show this like look if you would just use the friggin keyboard shortcuts, right?

861
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:33,715
Speaker 1: You would be a lot better off.

862
00:51:33,755 --> 00:51:52,569
Speaker 1: and the person goes and they don't want to learn they don't want to change themselves They don't want to bother with the keyboard shortcuts, but you know, maybe they don't mind the inefficiency Okay But if they simultaneously complain about the inefficiency and they won't learn to be more efficient and you're showing them the way It's like what the fuck dude what the fuck?

863
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:56,790
Speaker 0: Yep, at the same time sometimes if someone says Ella like say Dvorak is not better.

864
00:51:56,971 --> 00:51:57,894
Speaker 0: We've gone over this.

865
00:51:58,236 --> 00:52:01,408
Speaker 0: but say it were say it were somehow like two or three percent better.

866
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:01,770
Speaker 0: Okay?

867
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,562
Speaker 0: All right, so maybe I used on my keyboard two or three percent better.

868
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,370
Speaker 0: No one else supports that shit.

869
00:52:06,772 --> 00:52:09,530
Speaker 0: So everywhere else I go, I'm gonna have to go back to QWERTY anyway.

870
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:16,545
Speaker 1: So not to mention a lot of it causes a lot of other side effect problems Like oh you want to do ctrl s to save on a Dvorak keyboard.

871
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:17,690
Speaker 1: Guess what can't do with one hand?

872
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:19,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you can if you're a freak.

873
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,304
Speaker 1: yeah, right.

874
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:21,430
Speaker 0: and maybe you play the piano.

875
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:24,700
Speaker 1: So suddenly all your keyboard truck has had to be different.

876
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,587
Speaker 1: and then on and suddenly actually I can.

877
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,316
Speaker 0: God, I just tested.

878
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:33,190
Speaker 0: I can use either alt control or shift with one hand and hit any letter on the keyboard.

879
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,313
Speaker 1: All right, good.

880
00:52:34,353 --> 00:52:34,934
Speaker 1: Good luck for you.

881
00:52:34,994 --> 00:52:39,334
Speaker 1: But yes, it's a lot easier to hit ctrl s on QWERTY than a Dvorak.

882
00:52:39,877 --> 00:52:43,430
Speaker 1: so, you know, it kind of everything gets sorted, you know finagling.

883
00:52:43,713 --> 00:52:45,350
Speaker 1: Oh, you got to use some WASD for a game.

884
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:55,122
Speaker 1: So suddenly every time you're playing a game you have to reconfigure it, you know It's a whole lot more work than you think it is to that You're gonna be spending reconfiguring and then if you use a different computer.

885
00:52:55,182 --> 00:52:56,247
Speaker 1: Oh my god again, right?

886
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:03,167
Speaker 1: So it's best to just often forget your zealotry forget your preference for one browser another.

887
00:53:03,187 --> 00:53:09,495
Speaker 1: right if you are Actually a good computer user and you know how a computer works and how to use one You should be able to use anything.

888
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:11,321
Speaker 1: I can use Microsoft Word.

889
00:53:11,341 --> 00:53:12,946
Speaker 1: I can use Abby Word.

890
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:14,853
Speaker 1: I can use open office It doesn't.

891
00:53:14,873 --> 00:53:18,430
Speaker 1: if I can use Google Docs, it doesn't matter what the fuck word processor I have.

892
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,890
Speaker 1: I might like one the most but I can use anyone I have to use and I'll be just fine.

893
00:53:24,354 --> 00:53:26,129
Speaker 0: So I think there are two ways to deal with these people.

894
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:31,147
Speaker 0: If it's one of those like we should code with this or that the answer is alright, whatever.

895
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:31,789
Speaker 0: I don't care.

896
00:53:32,352 --> 00:53:37,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless there actually is you know a real reason need to pick one of the other.

897
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:40,662
Speaker 1: But in which case the person in charge whoever someone has authority.

898
00:53:40,702 --> 00:53:43,270
Speaker 1: or there's a voting or there's some mechanism by which you will decide.

899
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,621
Speaker 0: But the second case is the GNU Linux kind of person.

900
00:53:45,661 --> 00:53:49,358
Speaker 0: the person who makes the you know The kind of know it's GNU Linux.

901
00:53:49,398 --> 00:53:59,005
Speaker 0: if someone ever corrects you and says sorry, it's GNU Linux I think your response should be to just laugh and say okay, dude Fine, and then they might get really mad and hit you.

902
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:01,776
Speaker 0: Uh Unix anis can't hit that hard.

903
00:54:02,137 --> 00:54:02,719
Speaker 0: I don't know.

904
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:03,341
Speaker 1: There's a lot.

905
00:54:03,462 --> 00:54:05,248
Speaker 1: Oh, they might fall on you underneath that beard.

906
00:54:05,289 --> 00:54:08,341
Speaker 0: Watch out Maybe they'll strangle you with the beard.

907
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:13,004
Speaker 1: But yeah in general I think you should fight zealotry with productivity or laughter.

908
00:54:13,325 --> 00:54:18,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that you should You know change yourself before you start trying to change the computer.

909
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:20,078
Speaker 1: You should be.

910
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,253
Speaker 1: if you're actually good at computers You should be able to.

911
00:54:22,574 --> 00:54:23,176
Speaker 1: I can use.

912
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:33,843
Speaker 1: I can learn a new programming language in a couple days as long as it's you know A kind of programming language that I've you know learned before, you know It's not a new category of language might take me an extra few days to learn

913
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,750
Speaker 0: some sort of aspect oriented language.

914
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, you know not I mean something even completely new.

915
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,922
Speaker 1: I mean, I've done all I've done functional programming and all sorts.

916
00:54:41,942 --> 00:54:42,504
Speaker 1: so I can do.

917
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:44,170
Speaker 1: I can learn almost anything in a couple days.

918
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:45,626
Speaker 1: So what's you know?

919
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,769
Speaker 1: Throw anything you got at me if you're you know.

920
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:54,252
Speaker 1: If you can only use one particular thing and as soon as you're given a different thing you fall apart and don't know what to Do.

921
00:54:54,554 --> 00:54:56,430
Speaker 1: well, then you know with it then you suck.

922
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:57,695
Speaker 0: Well, yes, you are failing.

923
00:54:57,735 --> 00:54:58,398
Speaker 1: is you not failing?

924
00:54:58,579 --> 00:55:05,850
Speaker 0: in the computer anytime you're looking for a developer for something Especially for a short project you'll find the majority of developers out there are Java, which is fine.

925
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,009
Speaker 0: Java is good for a lot of small projects.

926
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:15,010
Speaker 0: But here's the problem the majority of the people out there who if you look for a small project thing are Java coder.

927
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:23,370
Speaker 0: So if you're looking for a Java coder specifically You will find these people and if you talk to them you will discover that they do not know how to program.

928
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,036
Speaker 1: They don't know any length.

929
00:55:25,076 --> 00:55:27,124
Speaker 0: They know how to write Java.

930
00:55:27,445 --> 00:55:28,850
Speaker 0: They do not know how to write code.

931
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,730
Speaker 0: They don't know any other programming language or programming fundamentals.

932
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:36,247
Speaker 0: They just know enough Java to do pretty much what you want.

933
00:55:36,689 --> 00:55:39,674
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I would argue that they are not computer science professionals.

934
00:55:39,694 --> 00:55:40,616
Speaker 0: They're not even coders.

935
00:55:40,856 --> 00:55:42,699
Speaker 0: They are Java errs and nothing more.

936
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:46,570
Speaker 1: and There's people like that for all like this done not even just languages.

937
00:55:46,812 --> 00:55:48,503
Speaker 0: You would be surprised like you think of an IT.

938
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:49,430
Speaker 0: They're excelers.

939
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:57,744
Speaker 0: There are so many IT guys who literally are I can support Microsoft Office on Windows or I can support Cisco.

940
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,470
Speaker 0: They don't know anything about networks.

941
00:55:59,691 --> 00:56:07,415
Speaker 0: They can't even tell you how multicast works, but they can make multicast work on a Cisco device Uh-huh, and they have like.

942
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:11,388
Speaker 1: I guess it's like some rote memorization as without actually knowing anything.

943
00:56:11,448 --> 00:56:14,750
Speaker 1: conceptually It's that I don't understand even how you could have that kind of knowledge.

944
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:19,292
Speaker 0: I don't but I would say that is the majority of the IT people I've ever interacted with Really?

945
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:25,313
Speaker 1: I don't even understand how you could memorize the steps for something and not understand what the steps were Like.

946
00:56:25,373 --> 00:56:25,594
Speaker 1: I don't.

947
00:56:25,654 --> 00:56:26,116
Speaker 1: I can't like.

948
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:28,727
Speaker 1: my brain doesn't even wrap around the way most schools teach it.

949
00:56:28,868 --> 00:56:31,189
Speaker 0: and you know still A lot of IT people never went to school for IT.

950
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,149
Speaker 0: They went for something else and kind of picked it up as they went.

951
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:35,397
Speaker 0: But like look at our IT.

952
00:56:35,417 --> 00:56:38,190
Speaker 0: compared to a lot of other schools our IT never taught a Cisco.

953
00:56:38,672 --> 00:56:42,446
Speaker 0: They gave us weird-ass routers that work terribly and they made us just use them.

954
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:43,610
Speaker 0: They didn't even tell us how they worked.

955
00:56:44,332 --> 00:56:45,078
Speaker 0: We had to figure it out.

956
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,510
Speaker 1: I saw a bunch of Cisco equipment.

957
00:56:46,632 --> 00:56:47,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had that too.

958
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:51,224
Speaker 0: We could go get Cisco if we wanted to but they wouldn't teach us like never.

959
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:54,377
Speaker 0: they never once told us how to do Anything with the Cisco router.

960
00:56:54,659 --> 00:56:56,570
Speaker 0: if you wanted to know you had to go figure it out yourself.

961
00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:05,684
Speaker 0: They would say make a router do this and you'd go find our router and make it do that Mm-hmm, and in one class they forced us to use this weird HP system.

962
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:07,330
Speaker 0: That was totally different from Cisco.

963
00:57:08,372 --> 00:57:11,710
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't know Cisco that well, I only know like, you know routing fundamentals.

964
00:57:12,094 --> 00:57:13,610
Speaker 0: I can make any router do anything.

965
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:17,110
Speaker 0: I just have to read the manual to figure out like how to turn on whatever routing protocol.

966
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:18,095
Speaker 1: I mean, it's CA.

967
00:57:18,156 --> 00:57:29,413
Speaker 1: in the CS department CS 1 through 3 were Java But then CS 4 was C++ and then in classes after that I mean everything was always Java a bull usually because you know They needed.

968
00:57:29,453 --> 00:57:38,656
Speaker 1: they couldn't like, you know force you to use something that you hadn't learned yet And the class was usually focusing on a specific topic and they couldn't force you to like Yep You know learn a new language.

969
00:57:38,776 --> 00:57:43,930
Speaker 0: as part of the class that I do is that way every IT class but a programming project And you could write in whatever you want.

970
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:52,123
Speaker 1: But usually usually they let they gave you some choices and there was even a class that Gave you a bunch of small projects and a bunch of different languages.

971
00:57:52,263 --> 00:58:03,890
Speaker 1: and you know, it was a weird adjunct professor But I learned like I did one thing in LISP and one thing in prologue and one thing in MATLAB Which isn't even really, you know, and I did like, you know one thing in a whole bunch of different languages.

972
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:05,767
Speaker 0: It sounds really fun one small thing each.

973
00:58:05,868 --> 00:58:07,763
Speaker 1: actually I got the shitty class.

974
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:12,904
Speaker 1: the better class Does it with you program the Lego robots with a bunch of different languages one after the other.

975
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:15,993
Speaker 1: that's a much better way to go I think that's actually.

976
00:58:16,033 --> 00:58:19,543
Speaker 1: I think the programming the robots in Python is CS 1 at MIT.

977
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,047
Speaker 1: now from what I've heard.

978
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:25,265
Speaker 1: Uh-huh But yeah, it's you know, that's that's how it should be.

979
00:58:25,285 --> 00:58:26,410
Speaker 1: you should be able to use anything.

980
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:27,977
Speaker 1: You can have a preference.

981
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:30,489
Speaker 1: don't try to shove your preference on anyone else.

982
00:58:31,131 --> 00:58:37,670
Speaker 1: You know if maybe you know your preference actually is objectively better somehow and you can see that it could benefit someone.

983
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,643
Speaker 1: But if they don't want to take it just fuck them.

984
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:40,569
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

985
00:58:40,911 --> 00:58:42,881
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, all you do is you point.

986
00:58:42,901 --> 00:58:44,630
Speaker 0: you have to really like work them up to it.

987
00:58:44,857 --> 00:58:48,924
Speaker 0: You know My computer is slow and you tell them will it be faster if you did this and that's true.

988
00:58:48,944 --> 00:58:53,006
Speaker 0: and every time they ever complain About the computer just remind them, you know, it'd work if you did this.

989
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:54,547
Speaker 1: Yep That's a good way to go.

990
00:58:55,092 --> 00:58:58,890
Speaker 1: But you don't don't sit there and be the zealot guy arguing with them saying Scott you've never done that.

991
00:58:59,392 --> 00:59:00,919
Speaker 1: No, listen, you got to do it my way.

992
00:59:00,939 --> 00:59:03,833
Speaker 0: I Think we've gone.

993
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,986
Speaker 1: I just berate people for being stupid is different.

994
00:59:06,227 --> 00:59:15,880
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

995
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,679
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.
