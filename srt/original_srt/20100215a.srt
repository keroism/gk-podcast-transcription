1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,026
Speaker 1: It's Monday, February 15th.

2
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:12,929
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,356
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:19,419
Speaker 1: Google buzz reminds us about privacy on the internet.

5
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:24,976
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:34,071
Speaker 0: So rim, you know that the four laws of physics Before I believe there are more than four.

7
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:36,439
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know the The.

8
00:00:41,644 --> 00:00:42,587
Speaker 0: No, there's only four.

9
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:45,615
Speaker 0: I just there were three and I added a new one.

10
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:46,919
Speaker 0: don't don't worry about those other ones.

11
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,528
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm not otherwise I can't make my joke.

12
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:54,202
Speaker 0: if you consider the laws of physics that aren't other than Newton's three laws I'm not.

13
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,953
Speaker 1: I'm not quite sure where you're coming with this.

14
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,080
Speaker 1: So you meant Newton's laws.

15
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:58,186
Speaker 0: Well, there was.

16
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:00,700
Speaker 0: you know, there are many laws in the universe, right?

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,414
Speaker 0: But there is one that people have referred to as a law.

18
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:09,191
Speaker 0: that wasn't actually a law But I have just proved that it actually is a law.

19
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,877
Speaker 1: and which law would this be?

20
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:11,600
Speaker 0: Murphy's law?

21
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,780
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even say that's a law so much as as a divine revelation.

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,529
Speaker 0: Regardless, you know be anything that can go wrong will go wrong is Absolutely.

23
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,599
Speaker 0: It is like it is.

24
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:30,937
Speaker 0: It is as it set in stone as every action has the equal but opposite reaction.

25
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:33,465
Speaker 0: Those are equally 100% true.

26
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:47,012
Speaker 1: that does not make sense because if that were true right now Every atom in all the recording equipment that we were using right now would have spontaneously Exploded while simultaneously Krauser appeared in real life and raped us today.

27
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:47,333
Speaker 0: It did.

28
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,416
Speaker 0: that was just in another universe that we're not in man.

29
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:53,270
Speaker 1: I'm glad I'm not in that universe.

30
00:01:53,692 --> 00:01:54,295
Speaker 0: I know right.

31
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:58,059
Speaker 0: so What can and did go wrong?

32
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:03,440
Speaker 0: So I have this car and I bought this car and I paid for the whole car.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,095
Speaker 0: I own the whole thing and I was like, oh man's I have this car.

34
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:06,900
Speaker 0: It's an awesome car.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,627
Speaker 0: I bought a brand new is totally awesome.

36
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:10,073
Speaker 0: And I used it and I used it.

37
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:10,795
Speaker 0: He's gonna used it.

38
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:11,660
Speaker 0: No, I was so great.

39
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:20,120
Speaker 0: That's like the rim and scott convention mobile right now and my plan With the car was that I would keep it forever and ever and ever until it died and it was like a hundred years old.

40
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,421
Speaker 0: No, I

41
00:02:20,441 --> 00:02:24,136
Speaker 1: remember you're talking about how yeah, this Mazda 3 one day is gonna be a fancy and

42
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:33,867
Speaker 0: it's gonna be yeah It's gonna be like an antique, you know, they'll be like the year 2040 and I'll have a car that from 2006 and It'll be like a classic.

43
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:35,353
Speaker 0: and I'll be like, yeah check this shit out.

44
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:36,860
Speaker 0: when they don't even have gas cars anymore.

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,867
Speaker 0: I'll have a gas car and I'm like, you know, like special gas tank, you know to drive at the antique car show And it'd be totally sweet.

46
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:49,236
Speaker 1: You have some interface where where the gas tank would be There's just a battery that somehow acts like gas.

47
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:52,575
Speaker 0: now Actual gas that's stored up, you know.

48
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:57,717
Speaker 0: for you know I have to pay like $100 a gallon for it from the antique car gas selling.

49
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:01,960
Speaker 0: guys, you know someday We're gonna run the same guy who sells leaded gas to work in like a Model T or whatever.

50
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,653
Speaker 1: We're gonna run out of dead dinosaur juice and then what?

51
00:03:04,854 --> 00:03:05,457
Speaker 0: no, I don't know.

52
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:10,731
Speaker 0: Well anyway So I moved to New York and my strategy was okay.

53
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:11,975
Speaker 0: I have this car.

54
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:18,020
Speaker 0: I don't really need it that often But I do still want to keep it until it's a classic.

55
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:19,857
Speaker 0: So what do I do as I say?

56
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:27,467
Speaker 0: I know I'll work really hard on stuff and try to make more money And if I can make more money Then I can get enough money to buy.

57
00:03:27,487 --> 00:03:29,595
Speaker 0: a parking space is a parking space where we are.

58
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,463
Speaker 0: It's a hike a hundred and thirty Bucks a month.

59
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,654
Speaker 1: Oh, it's only 125 in my building buzz away.

60
00:03:33,674 --> 00:03:34,217
Speaker 0: It was 125 actually.

61
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:36,831
Speaker 0: I think someone took the last parking space.

62
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:38,660
Speaker 1: There's one opening right now in my building.

63
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,220
Speaker 1: I was I was for a little while, you know, it was bonus time.

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,369
Speaker 1: I was like, maybe I'll buy a car.

65
00:03:43,429 --> 00:03:45,960
Speaker 0: the thing is I could get one that's like maybe out Long Islander.

66
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,673
Speaker 0: You know, I don't have to get the one at my building.

67
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:48,580
Speaker 1: It's not about it.

68
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,873
Speaker 1: I was like, maybe I'll buy a car.

69
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:55,420
Speaker 1: and While they're like, it would be really useful for a couple of really specific things like going to get groceries.

70
00:03:55,783 --> 00:03:58,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there's a Costco really close to me.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:05,330
Speaker 0: The thing is this Costco is sort of a little bit out of walking distance, you know Maybe it would be like even if it was walking distance.

72
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,394
Speaker 1: It's Costco.

73
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:07,740
Speaker 1: What are you gonna carry back?

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was insane to get.

75
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:19,680
Speaker 0: even if I got one of those grandma, you know grocery push carts that everyone has Right, even if I got one I couldn't even put like one Costco apple juice in there.

76
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,767
Speaker 0: You know, I would have to get like a giant one.

77
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:22,592
Speaker 1: what you do Scott?

78
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:24,600
Speaker 1: buy a real shopping cart.

79
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:28,699
Speaker 1: Where am I gonna store this real shopping chain it up on the street like a bike?

80
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:33,380
Speaker 0: And a homeless person will take it and it'll become their shopping cart only if they've got a hacksaw.

81
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,080
Speaker 0: You know you ever seen a homeless person?

82
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,812
Speaker 0: They've already got one shopping cart and it's definitely got a hacksaw in it.

83
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:39,816
Speaker 0: It's probably guys.

84
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:40,539
Speaker 0: It's like a holding.

85
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:41,967
Speaker 0: It's got everything in there.

86
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:42,832
Speaker 1: Why is the hobo?

87
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,320
Speaker 1: They're not really hobos anyway.

88
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:48,259
Speaker 1: I like saying hobo even though none of the people I refer to as hobos are actually hobos.

89
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:54,880
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but why are they gonna steal your shopping cart when they can just go to the grocery store and pick one?

90
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,886
Speaker 1: That's unlocked and just sitting there waiting?

91
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:05,099
Speaker 0: because if what they see one that's not at the grocery store They'll have to feel better about taking that one because obviously it doesn't belong to anyone's been lost.

92
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,929
Speaker 0: I have ones at the grocery store.

93
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,679
Speaker 0: They might feel bad about stealing it a little bit.

94
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,928
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's more of a hey crackhead situation.

95
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:11,871
Speaker 0: That's true too.

96
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:14,400
Speaker 0: But yeah, you've seen almost you've got multiple shopping carts.

97
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,194
Speaker 1: All right, they're like tied together in a little train.

98
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:25,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I had this car and other than like if I wanted to do certain things it would not really be useful.

99
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:28,472
Speaker 0: You know, it's like how when am I gonna use it?

100
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:30,240
Speaker 0: Well, I was gonna use it this weekend.

101
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,660
Speaker 0: I'd use it maybe to go to my parents house, but I can take the train.

102
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,845
Speaker 0: I don't need to use it for that.

103
00:05:34,865 --> 00:05:38,320
Speaker 0: I could use it to go to a convention, but I don't need to use it for that.

104
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:48,168
Speaker 0: so there are certain things, you know, basically the times I would use it are extremely extremely limited and the Even those times that I would use it.

105
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,120
Speaker 0: there are viable alternatives that are not really worse.

106
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,260
Speaker 1: Well even like for me, you know, I gotta go skiing.

107
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,538
Speaker 1: Renting a car is not that much money for the.

108
00:05:55,558 --> 00:05:57,589
Speaker 1: you know The four or five times I go skiing in a winter.

109
00:05:57,971 --> 00:05:59,580
Speaker 0: so it did not take very long.

110
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:05,318
Speaker 0: Right for me to switch from being like, oh, I'm gonna keep this car forever to fuck this car.

111
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:05,860
Speaker 0: It's a hassle.

112
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,690
Speaker 0: It's a pain in my ass.

113
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,418
Speaker 0: get it the hell out of here.

114
00:06:08,763 --> 00:06:11,160
Speaker 0: Like it took about like a week before I'm just like fuck this car.

115
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,480
Speaker 1: Part of that catalyst was the fact that you were doing the alternate side of the street parking.

116
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even if I didn't have to move it is basically just like just having it there.

117
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:19,300
Speaker 0: It's a burden.

118
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,398
Speaker 0: I'm paying insurance money and I'm not using it.

119
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:28,271
Speaker 0: If I took all my insurance money from the whole year I could buy multiple plane tickets and have money left over.

120
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,836
Speaker 1: as Jared said you buck the trend.

121
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:33,554
Speaker 1: most people move to the city Like just hold on to their car.

122
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,740
Speaker 1: like they linger they keep it.

123
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,797
Speaker 1: They're like, I'm gonna keep this car for like a year or two before they realize it's pointless and get rid of it.

124
00:06:40,078 --> 00:06:43,900
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm So it's only been a couple of months and I'm getting rid of it.

125
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,999
Speaker 0: So I'm smarter than those people who keep on to it for a year.

126
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I tried to find someone to buy it and nobody's buying cars But our friend wanted to buy it.

127
00:06:52,780 --> 00:07:00,500
Speaker 0: So I sold it to them and then of course I just mailed them the papers and then the next day car didn't start huh?

128
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:03,520
Speaker 1: It's funny because I remember a while back same thing happened.

129
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,700
Speaker 1: You tried to blame it on me for turning on a light that I didn't turn on.

130
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,071
Speaker 0: I think you did turn on the light and I think that didn't cause the problem.

131
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:10,734
Speaker 0: Haha.

132
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:12,159
Speaker 0: I can still blame you.

133
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,245
Speaker 1: Sounds like your alternators shot.

134
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:16,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went down.

135
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,172
Speaker 0: I had a guy.

136
00:07:17,212 --> 00:07:19,440
Speaker 0: he came first of all, you know.

137
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,764
Speaker 0: He tried to boost it.

138
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:21,929
Speaker 0: It boosted it started.

139
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:29,154
Speaker 0: He he unclipped and the car turned off Which I did not think it happened cuz it's like okay the battery gets the engine started.

140
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,680
Speaker 1: now battery does a bunch of other stuff.

141
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:31,343
Speaker 0: I know.

142
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:33,872
Speaker 0: the battery makes the lights turn on and all that kind of stuff.

143
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,840
Speaker 0: right and the thing is the lights are working.

144
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:37,339
Speaker 0: It's like the battery has juice.

145
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:43,180
Speaker 0: It was like the engine started but then as soon as he unplugged the jumper cables the engine turned off.

146
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,327
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, how did you know?

147
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,835
Speaker 1: so I was that's how cars work?

148
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:51,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's your my best bet He's gonna replace your battery or alternator.

149
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:51,560
Speaker 1: You'll be fine.

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's checking.

151
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,440
Speaker 0: so, you know.

152
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,614
Speaker 0: Then I'm like, how are you gonna tow this out of this parallel parking spot?

153
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:57,860
Speaker 0: and he had a clever machine.

154
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,793
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll try to find a YouTube that shows how this clever tow truck works.

155
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:08,627
Speaker 0: that can pull you out of a parallel spot And then he's gonna fix it up and then this weekend I will sell it.

156
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:13,051
Speaker 0: cuz good God I had to get rid of this thing You know, but I can't sell it if it's not fixed up.

157
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:14,939
Speaker 0: So I got to fix it up and then sell it.

158
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna leave that dent in it.

159
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:18,032
Speaker 1: Is that sold as is I'm gonna?

160
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:23,545
Speaker 0: I'm gonna attempt to repair the dent But really the dent is entirely on the bodywork, you know It is not.

161
00:08:23,646 --> 00:08:24,980
Speaker 0: there is no under damage.

162
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:30,520
Speaker 0: The dent is entirely in one piece of the bodywork right and I'm pretty sure you could just pop it out.

163
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:32,695
Speaker 0: I just haven't popped it out because it's cold.

164
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:38,600
Speaker 0: if it was the summer I would had no problem laying on the ground getting underneath the car and hitting it a few times to see what happened.

165
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:46,080
Speaker 0: You know, I'm gonna try the hair dryer, you know and followed by cold method that I saw videos of working on YouTube.

166
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:49,260
Speaker 1: So I know ice method is worked for me many times in the past.

167
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,416
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna attempt the.

168
00:08:50,599 --> 00:08:54,432
Speaker 0: well I'm gonna not actually use dry ice cuz someone said that why bother with dry ice?

169
00:08:54,814 --> 00:09:00,380
Speaker 0: buy one of those cans of compressed air at Staples turn it upside down and use the liquid dry ice coolant.

170
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,846
Speaker 1: Well, that's the conundrum of dry ice.

171
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,960
Speaker 1: dry ice is a lot cheaper than using one of those kids of air.

172
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,608
Speaker 0: It's real easy to buy a can of air.

173
00:09:06,688 --> 00:09:07,291
Speaker 0: It's kind of.

174
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,818
Speaker 0: where am I gonna get a piece of dry ice?

175
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:09,140
Speaker 0: Google?

176
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,127
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a bunch of place.

177
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:11,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like I gotta find a place.

178
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,360
Speaker 0: You got to get it in the styrofoam container.

179
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,612
Speaker 0: You got to get a towel around you gonna grab with the tongs and the rubber gloves and the.

180
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:20,151
Speaker 1: the styrofoam container is Just a beer cooler.

181
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:21,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you got it.

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,380
Speaker 0: You know, it's a whole to do with the dry ice with the can of air that it's a lot less work plus.

183
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,144
Speaker 1: However, they're wait.

184
00:09:26,185 --> 00:09:28,660
Speaker 1: There are a lot of distributors of dry ice all set to go.

185
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,656
Speaker 1: I mean, that's something you can do like in that when there's a heat wave They'll give dry ice to the old people to put in their house to cool it down.

186
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,083
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Still it's.

187
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:36,067
Speaker 0: you know, it's work.

188
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:42,297
Speaker 1: I wanted to do that at our IT and I found out afterward We could have gotten dry ice for free where at our IT.

189
00:09:43,742 --> 00:09:45,580
Speaker 1: But we didn't and we always complain.

190
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,012
Speaker 1: But we could have just cooled the house with dry ice.

191
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,421
Speaker 0: my grandpa would always talk about how you know How.

192
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:55,160
Speaker 0: today like if there's a butcher they drive the meat around in a refrigerated truck.

193
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:57,509
Speaker 0: He's like, why do they have a refrigerated truck?

194
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,383
Speaker 0: take a piece of dry ice put a fan in front of it Close the truck.

195
00:10:01,804 --> 00:10:10,000
Speaker 0: done that cut that truck would be colder than fucking anything, you know way better than a refrigerator And you won't have to power the refrigerator with gas or whatever.

196
00:10:10,623 --> 00:10:13,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course you have to use energy to get the dry ice.

197
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,740
Speaker 0: So it's you have to do the math on that to figure out what's more efficient.

198
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,631
Speaker 0: But the dry ice is definitely colder than the.

199
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:21,860
Speaker 1: you know, you don't want it to be too cold.

200
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,219
Speaker 1: You don't want to freeze the meat.

201
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,799
Speaker 0: Well, no, but that's you do want it.

202
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,091
Speaker 0: You know, if you're shipping meat long-distance, you do want to freeze.

203
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:27,594
Speaker 0: it depend.

204
00:10:27,614 --> 00:10:29,444
Speaker 0: basically have a big freezer truck It depends.

205
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,920
Speaker 1: so, you know, sometimes you want to just cool the meat.

206
00:10:32,141 --> 00:10:42,480
Speaker 0: Yes, if you did just want a cool but not frozen thing Then you might have to you know Regulate the dry ice somehow put it in a box a little vent or something like, you know, but you it's manageable.

207
00:10:42,641 --> 00:10:47,362
Speaker 1: I look forward to the day when we make Peltier or something like it a lot more efficient and we can just do everything I don't like.

208
00:10:47,402 --> 00:10:48,446
Speaker 0: I don't think that's happening.

209
00:10:48,506 --> 00:10:49,871
Speaker 0: Notice how quickly they abandoned.

210
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:52,500
Speaker 0: Peltier is a computer cooling method due to its crappiness.

211
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:55,347
Speaker 0: Yeah Lack of ability to improve.

212
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,853
Speaker 1: I think it can improve.

213
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:58,400
Speaker 1: I heat pumps and heat engines.

214
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,439
Speaker 1: We just have to figure out the molecular stuff better.

215
00:11:00,641 --> 00:11:04,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway car is getting fixed now and then I'm getting rid of it.

216
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,605
Speaker 0: Good God get out of here car And watch you it.

217
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:13,539
Speaker 0: and then my new strategy right is because obviously The strategy of wait till I get money for a parking space did not work.

218
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:20,680
Speaker 0: So the new strategy is aha wait until I have so much money that I can buy a new car and a parking space.

219
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,180
Speaker 0: And until I have that much money do nothing.

220
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:25,424
Speaker 0: That's the new strategy.

221
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:44,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean honestly the the nail in the coffin for me buying a car well again was just the fact that fresh direct delivered groceries last night and I realized that Nothing is more awesome in the world than having every grocer you would ever want just brought into your apartment by people Who would be perfectly willing to put it in your fridge for you?

222
00:11:44,472 --> 00:11:46,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not even just you know.

223
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,974
Speaker 0: I mean you think grocery delivery.

224
00:11:47,994 --> 00:11:48,780
Speaker 0: that's pretty amazing.

225
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:59,900
Speaker 0: you can get delivery of fucking anything like if you go to Bed Bath and Beyond and you buy like some bed sheets and a Pan a frying pan That's what you're buying and a toaster oven, right?

226
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:05,730
Speaker 0: You can go to the checkout and then you can go over to the other counter and be like Yeah, send this to my house and they just bring it to your house.

227
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,754
Speaker 0: I Think they might charge you a delivery fee, but not that much though.

228
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,499
Speaker 0: No, it's not that much.

229
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:12,174
Speaker 1: I just I've realized everything.

230
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:15,652
Speaker 0: in New York City They have like almost every place has delivery.

231
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,460
Speaker 1: what it basically comes down to is everywhere else.

232
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,316
Speaker 1: I just had Amazon so I bought 90% of the stuff I bought online and it got delivered.

233
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:29,160
Speaker 1: now I buy 99% of the stuff I buy and it just gets delivered and the other 1% is basically like street meat.

234
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:37,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually go to the grocery store though, cuz it's right I get off the subway when I get home from work and there it is and then I buy a food and then I go Home and I immediately eat it.

235
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,900
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, it's a little better than waiting for a grocery delivery.

236
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I buy cheese and fresh bread at Grand Central.

237
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:44,751
Speaker 0: Mmm.

238
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:45,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch me.

239
00:12:46,014 --> 00:12:46,516
Speaker 0: I should.

240
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:47,940
Speaker 0: I have troubles with breads.

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,872
Speaker 0: I got to find some some bread eggs.

242
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:50,919
Speaker 1: My policy is pretty good.

243
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,480
Speaker 1: now I only ever buy brand new fresh bread from like a bakery or something.

244
00:12:55,601 --> 00:13:00,633
Speaker 0: The thing is I got some bakeries But they're the kind of bakeries that have like cakes and cannolis and shit and I can't.

245
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:05,554
Speaker 0: I'm looking and some of them have breads But some of them like long breads, you know or big breads.

246
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:06,900
Speaker 1: That's the best kind of bread.

247
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:10,803
Speaker 0: It's a good kind of bread, but that's not the kind of bread that one person needs I need like?

248
00:13:11,064 --> 00:13:17,187
Speaker 0: no I need like a bag of rolls or you know a small loaf I don't need like a big long bread.

249
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:21,540
Speaker 1: Well, you can buy the big long bread use what you're gonna use and crouton the rest.

250
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,013
Speaker 0: You know how many croutons I'm gonna have you eat.

251
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,320
Speaker 1: a lot of croutons will all work out.

252
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,086
Speaker 0: Don't eat that many croutons.

253
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:30,779
Speaker 0: I mean I bag of croutons last me like a couple weeks.

254
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,834
Speaker 0: That's like you who eats the croutons like a snack because they are a snack.

255
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:35,276
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

256
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:37,205
Speaker 0: Snacks is snacks.

257
00:13:37,285 --> 00:13:38,350
Speaker 0: croutons is croutons.

258
00:13:39,073 --> 00:13:40,820
Speaker 0: So are you gonna put Doritos on your salad?

259
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,647
Speaker 1: Blackberry might be in trouble again.

260
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:46,840
Speaker 1: I mean the iPhone was never really competition for the blackberry.

261
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,179
Speaker 1: They were like two distinct products with two distinct kind of people who would use it.

262
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:57,060
Speaker 0: I mean iPhone made a token effort to try to appeal to corporate people by putting in exchange support in the Cisco VPN.

263
00:13:57,343 --> 00:13:58,980
Speaker 1: At work, I went to my corporate support people.

264
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,828
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, can we support the iPhone?

265
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:12,640
Speaker 0: because I was thinking maybe I'll buy an iPhone and they just laughed Yeah, it's like it's not enough because they don't realize that the blackberry also gives all this other stuff You know, which basically is stuff that Steve Jobs hates.

266
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,887
Speaker 1: So and whether I do it has basically I think relegated itself to the very solid kind of All the cheap default.

267
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:24,880
Speaker 1: like person goes to the store and says I want a smartphone.

268
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:27,055
Speaker 1: Eventually, I think they're all just gonna be web OS.

269
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,463
Speaker 0: Hmm I don't know about that.

270
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:32,240
Speaker 1: like low-end smartphones is where I feel if web OS survives at all.

271
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,166
Speaker 1: The low-end smartphone is where they do.

272
00:14:34,226 --> 00:14:36,532
Speaker 0: like though that we actually have like real competition.

273
00:14:36,552 --> 00:14:39,080
Speaker 0: We've got five real competitors, right?

274
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:45,530
Speaker 0: I know where you got web OS Android iPhone Blackberry and Microsoft five at.

275
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:45,911
Speaker 0: look at this.

276
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:47,960
Speaker 0: what happens in this actual competition?

277
00:14:48,321 --> 00:15:07,131
Speaker 0: The thing is that so depressing is that we have actual competition and people are stepping up the game but nobody's really stepping up the game, you know, and I think the reason for that is because Even though there's a real competition in the smartphone OS arena There is no competition in the carrier arena and it's tied up.

278
00:15:07,271 --> 00:15:13,259
Speaker 0: if the carriers were loosened or also had to compete Then we would see craziness happen.

279
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,335
Speaker 1: Absolute crazy, it's tough because there is competition.

280
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:23,120
Speaker 1: if you live in cities Like if you live in New York Verizon Sprint and AT&T are all equal except for the fact that AT&T sucks.

281
00:15:23,763 --> 00:15:27,880
Speaker 1: But like Sprint is super fast and they're a lot cheaper than Verizon you get pretty much the same coverage.

282
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:33,323
Speaker 1: But if you live in a lot of places, you can really only go with one carrier Maybe two.

283
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:33,886
Speaker 1: Yep.

284
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,195
Speaker 1: I mean t-mobile is not gonna mean.

285
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:46,340
Speaker 0: it's not just about coverage It's about you know pricing and it's also about you know Data networks and their data network policies and whether they allow the tethering or the charge, you know that kind of stuff

286
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:57,717
Speaker 1: Yep, but even with it with the competition in the you know, web OS and BlackBerry and everything I think what it's really coming down to it I didn't realize this until recently is that patent encumbrance is probably the biggest.

287
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,352
Speaker 1: like that It's the biggest thing that's holding back having a smartphone that does everything right.

288
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:08,394
Speaker 1: that is also very true because everyone has patents on all these Obvious good idea UI things that other people can't use.

289
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:09,860
Speaker 0: it's not even UI things, right?

290
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,273
Speaker 0: There's a lot of other things that the people have patents on.

291
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:16,620
Speaker 0: that aren't UI things Like for example for all the Verizon and Sprint phones, right?

292
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,245
Speaker 0: they use the ev dues and all that stuff.

293
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:20,292
Speaker 0: all those people don't realize right?

294
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:25,840
Speaker 0: all that ev dues CDMA stuff is Owned by Qualcomm, right?

295
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:31,700
Speaker 0: There are Qualcomm chips and all Verizon and Sprint devices and all the GSM GPRS stuff.

296
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,820
Speaker 0: That stuff is all open standards, you know.

297
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,940
Speaker 0: You could just make your own GPS G not GPS GSM network just in your house if you get the right radio equipment.

298
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:41,167
Speaker 0: You know people nerds have done it.

299
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:42,011
Speaker 0: You can go read about it.

300
00:16:42,474 --> 00:17:01,309
Speaker 0: And there's even like some guy he makes I think he called like the magic stick or something like that and You it's just a USB thing and you put it in your computer and it creates a GSM network in your house and then all of all your cell phones will use that instead of the local antenna because they're getting a stronger signal from it and You'll be able to make calls on your cell phone.

301
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:07,089
Speaker 0: No problem over your internets with this little stick but little things to like web OS.

302
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:17,060
Speaker 1: the only thing it really has over the other I guess OS is is That they have this great internet like all your contacts and chats and everything or just seamlessly integrated with each other.

303
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,972
Speaker 0: That's the one thing that I really wish other people would get right.

304
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:21,338
Speaker 0: that only web OS gets right.

305
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:26,036
Speaker 0: It's like wow Come right on, you know iPhone doesn't even have I chat right?

306
00:17:26,056 --> 00:17:27,000
Speaker 0: That's completely retarded.

307
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,883
Speaker 0: Android I guess has some chatting but it like, you know It's not like.

308
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:37,220
Speaker 0: it's all super integrated with your SMS and every single chat network and there's a bug.

309
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,520
Speaker 1: A lot of people are having this weird problem where their phone will just get duplicates of every SMS from some of their contacts.

310
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I still haven't heard any good risk.

311
00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:50,159
Speaker 0: and then like if you have you know The Android has the best Gmail but the Gmail separate from all the other mail.

312
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:54,160
Speaker 0: So it's like give all this other mail and then Gmail in two separate places.

313
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:00,620
Speaker 1: Yep at the pre actually I will say integrates with Gmail better than Google integrates with its own Gmail.

314
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:04,040
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the actual Gmail app on the Android.

315
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,620
Speaker 0: I haven't used it but every single person says that it is like the best better than any other phone dealing with Gmail.

316
00:18:10,781 --> 00:18:12,868
Speaker 0: But the problem is is that it's all on its own.

317
00:18:12,908 --> 00:18:16,892
Speaker 0: So if you also have like an IMAP, it's separate whereas on the pre It's together.

318
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,885
Speaker 1: Yep Everything's just together and it's all.

319
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:21,936
Speaker 1: just push because it pulls and figure all your emails in one place.

320
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:24,104
Speaker 0: all your IMS and SMS Is in one place.

321
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,394
Speaker 0: they're all you know, all your contacts are.

322
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:27,920
Speaker 0: you know span across the whole thing?

323
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,640
Speaker 0: So you only have one of everything and that's what I like the most, you know on the iPhone It's like everything is separated into apps.

324
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:42,248
Speaker 0: so your Facebook is over here and your Skype is over there and your emails over here and you don't even have I am unless You pay for one of those stupid apps that I'm not paying for.

325
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:50,638
Speaker 0: and maybe even if you have I am it's separate apps one For aim and one for something else, you know, I want all I am is together just like on the computer pigeon.

326
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:51,300
Speaker 0: does all I am?

327
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

328
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,588
Speaker 1: I used to run everything separately.

329
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:57,220
Speaker 1: I used to have like multiple I am clients open at the same time back in the day.

330
00:18:57,401 --> 00:19:00,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like we've gone back in time and then yeah, I got no multitasking.

331
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:05,720
Speaker 0: So if you don't put them all together in one place, I can't even do more than one at a time.

332
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,760
Speaker 1: Well, here's the real problem.

333
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:17,413
Speaker 1: It's that computers like evolved to a certain point and we solved all these problems on the computer because it's a multi-purpose device and it's open Like completely open unless it's an Apple and even then it's relatively open.

334
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,075
Speaker 1: It's a computer.

335
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,198
Speaker 1: if someone makes program You can just install it.

336
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:26,760
Speaker 1: So like we evolved to a certain point we we as nerds who use our computers to the fullest have these expectations.

337
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:30,479
Speaker 1: But now because we're mobile we're nerds who walk around a lot.

338
00:19:30,882 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaker 1: so now that we've got smartphones we carry the smartphone everywhere and There are tasks that our computers are perfect at that.

339
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,000
Speaker 1: We only did on the computer because we didn't have a computer that was in our pocket.

340
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,320
Speaker 1: Now we have a computer in our pocket.

341
00:19:44,662 --> 00:19:47,139
Speaker 1: So we want to do all this stuff primarily on the phone.

342
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:51,873
Speaker 1: But the phone can't do it as well as the computer can and the first.

343
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:54,420
Speaker 0: it's only frustrating because there's nothing wrong with the hardware.

344
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,220
Speaker 0: It's simply that someone did not write the software or will not allow the software to be written.

345
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,226
Speaker 0: There is no technological reason.

346
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,270
Speaker 0: It could not be done.

347
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,393
Speaker 0: Luckily should not be.

348
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,420
Speaker 1: it will be done in the long run.

349
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,366
Speaker 1: This is all just a conversion smart.

350
00:20:07,466 --> 00:20:08,269
Speaker 1: I've had everything wrong.

351
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:12,021
Speaker 0: the reason we're talking about this is because of Windows Mobile 7.

352
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:17,658
Speaker 1: Yes, Windows Mobile 7 is basically another pillar in this gigantic vehicle Eddie.

353
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:21,154
Speaker 0: Yes So here is my prediction for Windows Mobile 7, right?

354
00:20:21,194 --> 00:20:22,420
Speaker 1: Let's see if we have the same prediction.

355
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,280
Speaker 0: So you look at it and you say, okay, it's like zoom phone basically, right?

356
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:29,115
Speaker 0: You know the UI is you know what you might like it.

357
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:29,979
Speaker 0: You might not like it.

358
00:20:30,421 --> 00:20:32,507
Speaker 0: You know the Facebook integration is really heavy.

359
00:20:33,028 --> 00:20:35,936
Speaker 0: The thing is here's here's what it's got ready number one.

360
00:20:36,538 --> 00:20:37,280
Speaker 0: It's Microsoft.

361
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:44,642
Speaker 0: So it's got all the exchange corporate stuff that anyone could possibly need therefore Blackberry.

362
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:46,750
Speaker 0: Well, why do you need the blackberry anymore?

363
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,700
Speaker 0: Well, the one thing the blackberry still has is got the keyboard.

364
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,420
Speaker 0: So the need for the corporate people who basically write crazy long emails on their phones.

365
00:20:54,843 --> 00:21:00,840
Speaker 0: You got to make a Windows Mobile 7 phone with the keyboard Which I'm sure they will make because it's not gonna be like the iPhone where there's only one phone.

366
00:21:01,123 --> 00:21:02,740
Speaker 0: This is an OS that's gonna go on many phone.

367
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:11,340
Speaker 1: I was watching a bunch of videos about it and the Microsoft guy I skipped through this part But I remember him saying something about like what is required and what isn't required in the hardware.

368
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,760
Speaker 1: They're gonna use keyboard optional like he was like, yeah, it doesn't matter.

369
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:28,391
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah people there is an on-screen keyboard obviously because you have a capacitive touchscreen Absolutely necessary, but you know, there's gonna be one that has a keyboard that will please the corporate people and there'll be ones without You know, the thing is right.

370
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,235
Speaker 0: in addition to that.

371
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,400
Speaker 0: It also is soon.

372
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:35,700
Speaker 0: So it's got your music and your video and all that stuff that you know, nothing but the iPhone does.

373
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,492
Speaker 0: That's the thing with the iPhone that people still no one talks about except me.

374
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:40,976
Speaker 0: I feel like is that okay?

375
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:42,240
Speaker 0: the iPhones closed.

376
00:21:42,362 --> 00:21:46,773
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever whatever whatever Android your mom but the iPhone.

377
00:21:47,135 --> 00:22:03,102
Speaker 0: if I had an Android phone I would probably still need to have an iPod nano because the Android is not good, you know I mean it does it but it's not good if audio and video and music and podcasts, you know This is Google listen and stuff but it's not as good as having an iPod and the iPhone is an iPod

378
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:11,692
Speaker 1: and the the pre is even worse at that because it had the like the good hack together integration with iTunes Which gave me about 60% of what I needed from it and it was good enough.

379
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:13,840
Speaker 1: and then Apple decided to break all that.

380
00:22:14,122 --> 00:22:16,940
Speaker 0: Android is like 80% but it's not a hundred percent.

381
00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:20,400
Speaker 0: You know, it's all about the if I can carry one less thing in my pocket.

382
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:23,239
Speaker 0: That is so much a bigger difference in my daily life.

383
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:34,720
Speaker 1: See sadly, I've gotten to the point to where I feel like at least for the next many years I'm gonna just have to have a smartphone and completely separate from that an iPhone some sort of like Apple media playing device.

384
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, the I mean the new iPod nano - is so crazy awesome.

385
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:39,316
Speaker 0: That's a fucking video camera.

386
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,545
Speaker 0: I mean good God Yep, and it's right.

387
00:22:41,645 --> 00:22:44,840
Speaker 0: It's really there is nothing to complain about with the iPod nano, right?

388
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:46,829
Speaker 0: What can you possibly complain about with it?

389
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:47,171
Speaker 0: Nothing?

390
00:22:47,754 --> 00:22:49,000
Speaker 1: So, you know what I can complain about.

391
00:22:49,341 --> 00:22:51,407
Speaker 1: It doesn't just download podcasts over the air.

392
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,052
Speaker 0: That's what nothing does though.

393
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:55,239
Speaker 0: I know right so it's not.

394
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,544
Speaker 0: you can't Complain about them not doing something.

395
00:22:57,604 --> 00:22:58,508
Speaker 0: Oh, it's doing it.

396
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:02,100
Speaker 1: What's going to that stupid integration with Ford cars?

397
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:02,984
Speaker 1: That is like.

398
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:05,856
Speaker 1: our only hope God is that that Microsoft.

399
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:06,920
Speaker 0: Microsoft is doing that.

400
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:14,547
Speaker 1: Yeah so my only hope is that that thing will finally be the point at which I can just have Podcasts that I just listen to on my phone.

401
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:18,764
Speaker 0: the Android does it with Google listen, but Google listen doesn't like sink and down I don't know.

402
00:23:18,785 --> 00:23:22,380
Speaker 0: You know, it's not exactly the same kind of thing Because it's got it that no one does both.

403
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:29,939
Speaker 1: They either let you sink from a computer and then listen or they let you listen while you have an internet connection But as soon as you go like into a tunnel you lose it.

404
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,454
Speaker 0: Well, the Google listen like caches heavily so it'll download.

405
00:23:33,514 --> 00:23:37,053
Speaker 1: it'll try to download the whole podcast But you can't like switch it up while you're in the tunnel.

406
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:38,200
Speaker 1: It doesn't like keep you try.

407
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:43,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you try to start a new podcast in the tunnel I don't think that Google listen will be able to play it.

408
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,183
Speaker 1: So listen kids.

409
00:23:44,444 --> 00:23:47,780
Speaker 1: obvious app that for like Android that would make everyone happy.

410
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:51,680
Speaker 1: Just have a podcast II or internet media listening watching device.

411
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,860
Speaker 1: There's video and audio and all it has to do is you say what things you want to listen to and how much space?

412
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:08,215
Speaker 1: Or how many whatevers you want to alligate to it and it'll always keep the most recent and episodes cached on the phone And it'll let you listen to anything streaming as long as you have a connection

413
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:15,960
Speaker 0: and then you know If you do want to stream something, it'll download it And if you're done listening to something you can delete it and free up space for something else.

414
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,213
Speaker 1: Yeah Just have a little option of I'm done with this or not not deleting or undeleting.

415
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:24,620
Speaker 1: just I've already listened to this and it still Won't get rid of it until you know, it has to roll over because it ran out of space in its cache.

416
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one's even tried to do anything close to that.

417
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:29,100
Speaker 0: Nope, not even remotely.

418
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:30,829
Speaker 0: So the thing is right.

419
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,944
Speaker 0: this Windows mobile it's got it's got a zoom So it's like.

420
00:24:33,984 --> 00:24:41,400
Speaker 0: well if I've got one of those that now has sort of jumped ahead in that Well, look there is now it's not just the iPhone anymore.

421
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:52,079
Speaker 0: There is another phone that also is as good at music and video as the iPhone is and it has you know The they support like the fancy OLED screens like the Zune HD.

422
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:56,254
Speaker 0: So it might actually be better than the iPhone at audio and video.

423
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,780
Speaker 1: two more than X, right?

424
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,949
Speaker 0: So that's a big shocker.

425
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:00,069
Speaker 0: Now.

426
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,552
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

427
00:25:00,592 --> 00:25:04,848
Speaker 0: I don't think it's actually going to Compete with the iPhone in a direct way.

428
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:08,540
Speaker 0: I don't see people who are iPhone people going for the windows phone.

429
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:13,820
Speaker 1: You know, it competes with the with the iPhone in the same way that PCs or Dells just compete with Macs.

430
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:22,370
Speaker 1: I mean some people were like not really in the sense that eventually every now and then you'll snipe or someone who like would be Buying the next Apple product like some nerd points out.

431
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:28,012
Speaker 1: Hey that Dell is twice as fast and half as expensive Mmm, but otherwise, you know, it's not direct competition.

432
00:25:28,032 --> 00:25:29,318
Speaker 1: They're competing with blackberry.

433
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:47,140
Speaker 0: Yes I think what's gonna happen here is unless blackberry can step up their game that in the long run not in the short run Right, but in the long run as corporate IT places slowly switch to Windows 7 and slowly They're blackberries die and they need to buy new phones.

434
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:56,180
Speaker 0: They're gonna get these Microsoft Windows Mobile 7 phones instead of the blackberry or in the very least They're gonna stop paying for blackberry enterprise server.

435
00:25:56,702 --> 00:26:01,723
Speaker 0: Right and you people don't realize you think oh iPhone is the number one smartphone Not really black.

436
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:08,800
Speaker 0: in terms of smartphone market share blackberry is way way way ahead of everybody else Simply because most people don't buy smartphones.

437
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,399
Speaker 0: Here's what we'll do if I normal phones.

438
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:15,180
Speaker 0: So most smartphones are the ones people get from work for free which are blackberries straight up a hundred percent.

439
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,903
Speaker 1: What would do?

440
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:20,480
Speaker 1: it is if the blackberry enterprise server equivalent for the Windows 7 phone?

441
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,869
Speaker 1: Which is was was just exchange, but it is just exchange Yes, but if like exchange just had like the phone tab and you could do everything I do with like it does.

442
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,340
Speaker 0: it's had that for a long time.

443
00:26:31,922 --> 00:26:39,519
Speaker 1: With these phones integrated with everything that blackberry can do Remote wiping phones remotes, you know all the things you need to be able to do for corporate compliance.

444
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:43,220
Speaker 0: Jay I'm pretty sure exchange already does that for the windows mobile six and a half phones.

445
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:45,676
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't it do it for the windows mobile seven phone?

446
00:26:45,716 --> 00:26:46,320
Speaker 1: Are you sure though?

447
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,845
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure cuz how come?

448
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:49,452
Speaker 1: no one uses them in a corporate setting.

449
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,841
Speaker 0: people do use them in a corporate not enough for it To matter.

450
00:26:51,861 --> 00:27:02,500
Speaker 0: I think it's just cuz you know, the blackberry name and marketing and all those sorts of things and you know Whatever, I don't know because at least every big company I've worked with always they want to use something other than blackberry.

451
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,857
Speaker 1: They always explore the options and they always come back saying yeah, it doesn't offer this thing that by law.

452
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:07,700
Speaker 1: We're required to have.

453
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:18,460
Speaker 0: I'm not Informed in these matters so but you know I cannot imagine that my you know that Microsoft would not include the necessary things in exchange for their own phone.

454
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:25,147
Speaker 1: Well, I think the fact that they're launching this the way they are and especially looking at the UI like the way it's used They're definitely.

455
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,880
Speaker 1: this is marketed differently from other windows mobile devices.

456
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:28,764
Speaker 1: This is joy.

457
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:43,640
Speaker 1: This is the convergence between the business phone and the home phone Mmm, so people like me who have like a work blackberry and a home pre Well are probably best served in the long run sadly not by a droid but by some sort of Windows device That'll do the work stuff and do the home.

458
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,532
Speaker 0: It's also kind of crazy that his Microsoft Office in it like all of Microsoft Office.

459
00:27:48,214 --> 00:27:50,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like part at all.

460
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:50,782
Speaker 0: It's.

461
00:27:50,882 --> 00:27:51,243
Speaker 0: it's got.

462
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:54,334
Speaker 0: you know PowerPoint and exchange and word and the whole thing.

463
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:56,080
Speaker 1: My pre's got something halfway there.

464
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,540
Speaker 1: I've got this Microsoft doc view that came with it that I can read any Microsoft like document.

465
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I can edit some of them.

466
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:07,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like, you know iPad was talking about how to have I work.

467
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's like.

468
00:28:08,042 --> 00:28:10,529
Speaker 0: well Windows Mobile 7 has Microsoft Office.

469
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,393
Speaker 0: It's like game over right there.

470
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:19,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I I foresee Windows Mobile 7 being a lot like Windows in the long run.

471
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,180
Speaker 0: Where is it just dominates market share because it'll slowly eat away all of blackberries market.

472
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:35,915
Speaker 1: There are two markets that it'll probably never penetrate into and those markets will become blackberries like long-term like permanent business plan Government and military because those people never fucking change anything.

473
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:36,939
Speaker 0: No, they'll never change.

474
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:41,740
Speaker 0: Did you ever see that video of them asking Hillary Clinton to install Firefox at the State Department?

475
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,293
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll make that my thing of the day.

476
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:47,941
Speaker 0: Oh Next time.

477
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:58,088
Speaker 1: Well that went on a while.

478
00:28:58,168 --> 00:29:00,210
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

479
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:00,710
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

480
00:29:00,831 --> 00:29:05,050
Speaker 0: So I was gonna do a different thing of the day, but then I was reminded of this video.

481
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:05,797
Speaker 0: So why not?

482
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:06,990
Speaker 0: I'll just make it the thing of the day.

483
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,876
Speaker 1: I had not seen this video until just now.

484
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:15,146
Speaker 0: this is from July of 2009. if you're you know, it's not new antique antique.

485
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:17,961
Speaker 0: it's Basically, it's a video of the US State Department.

486
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:20,029
Speaker 0: It's basically like I guess it's like the employee meeting.

487
00:29:21,191 --> 00:29:22,035
Speaker 1: That's the same kind of thing.

488
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:24,045
Speaker 1: Like when I worked at IBM or all those big companies.

489
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:24,990
Speaker 1: The government's no different.

490
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:33,983
Speaker 1: They'll have like big Q&A with big wig in the company and everyone asked these pre scripted trip to kind of like lame Questions like why can't we do this?

491
00:29:34,164 --> 00:29:35,570
Speaker 1: Why don't we get more Vegas?

492
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:38,001
Speaker 0: Someone's like why don't we use fucking Firefox?

493
00:29:38,021 --> 00:29:40,070
Speaker 0: Why are we using piece of shit ie right?

494
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,276
Speaker 0: Sure, I get the impression the thing is right.

495
00:29:42,296 --> 00:29:46,230
Speaker 0: you think oh man people are so stupid right, but like the whole audience is like.

496
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:50,884
Speaker 0: So it's like well smart people work in the State Department.

497
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:55,169
Speaker 1: the best part is that Hillary Clinton Clearly is taken aback and has no idea what this is.

498
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:55,632
Speaker 0: She's like.

499
00:29:55,652 --> 00:30:01,601
Speaker 0: she's like oh the whole room knows something and thinks something is awesome And I have no fucking clue because I don't use a computer.

500
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,169
Speaker 0: I just have someone who does that for me.

501
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:11,610
Speaker 1: Hey Answer the question and the other guy gave like the stop stock corporate answer of it cost money.

502
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not actually freaks.

503
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:22,290
Speaker 0: You have to pay money to install it and stuff Which is technically true, but that you had the money you would save from people not having viruses and ie.

504
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:37,367
Speaker 0: You know if you limited you guys what you could do is you could limit their ie's so that the ie's could only visit Intranet sites which are the ones that you might have that might be ie only and then you could require all out Internet browsing to go in Firefox

505
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,352
Speaker 1: yep And thus

506
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,275
Speaker 0: you would not.

507
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:42,004
Speaker 0: you would eliminate viruses and spywares and malware.

508
00:30:42,064 --> 00:30:42,827
Speaker 1: so much really to do.

509
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:54,327
Speaker 0: just use Windows group Any money that it cost to get Firefox on there and to update it and such and to make sure you know Prevent people from doing weird extensions or whatever you would save.

510
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:57,790
Speaker 0: well I mean like in my company we actually don't even need to do a study to figure this out.

511
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:03,310
Speaker 1: I'll just tell you we actually push Firefox and ie updates simultaneously as part of all our other updates.

512
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:08,670
Speaker 1: So we force everyone to have Firefox and we keep it up-to-date for them, so it's just always there always works.

513
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:13,770
Speaker 1: Yeah Of course I also have Chrome installed because it actually works better for a lot of our internal stuff.

514
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:20,290
Speaker 1: Then ie that it was designed for because we use a lot of Ajax and the one thing that Chrome is great at is Anything with Ajax?

515
00:31:21,231 --> 00:31:22,416
Speaker 0: Any JavaScript anything.

516
00:31:22,556 --> 00:31:24,624
Speaker 0: Chrome is the fastest any client-side stuff.

517
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:25,970
Speaker 1: Chrome just seems to handle a lot better.

518
00:31:26,672 --> 00:31:28,921
Speaker 1: Only Chrome could properly block ads.

519
00:31:29,242 --> 00:31:32,295
Speaker 0: yeah, well, I mean there is an ad block extension But it's a little it.

520
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,307
Speaker 1: basically the ads go and then disappear.

521
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:39,930
Speaker 1: Yeah great I don't want the ad to download at all yeah, and then you know there's other things that chromed.

522
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:45,298
Speaker 0: You know it just doesn't have the features that Firefox has when fully extended.

523
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:49,050
Speaker 0: you know I mean you know they do have that little developer thing not as good as firebug.

524
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:50,120
Speaker 0: You know they got.

525
00:31:50,181 --> 00:31:52,054
Speaker 0: it's just you know Stuff.

526
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:53,720
Speaker 0: yep, what's your thing of the day?

527
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:55,206
Speaker 1: so in Arizona?

528
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,270
Speaker 1: Oh of course you remember?

529
00:31:56,371 --> 00:31:59,329
Speaker 1: You know riding the bus as a kid there were kids.

530
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:05,245
Speaker 1: Riding the bus was always annoying because kids are loud and punching each other and you know the bully.

531
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:06,810
Speaker 1: kids are bullying the nerd kids.

532
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:07,701
Speaker 0: And you missed us.

533
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:09,629
Speaker 1: You know what?

534
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,232
Speaker 1: randomly Something.

535
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:18,490
Speaker 1: someone missed their bus on the way to work during the snowstorm and my boss's boss starts singing crisscross.

536
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:19,316
Speaker 1: I miss the bus.

537
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,013
Speaker 1: no you're shitting me and everyone in the room is like What are you singing?

538
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:23,398
Speaker 1: and I'm your boss's boss?

539
00:32:23,418 --> 00:32:24,020
Speaker 0: This is a hive.

540
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,284
Speaker 1: yes, and I'm like.

541
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:26,810
Speaker 1: I just look at him.

542
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:32,958
Speaker 1: I'm like I saw them in concert And no one no one had a clue what the hell that was all about.

543
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:40,570
Speaker 1: so we reminisced about crisscross wearing the pants backwards Missing the bus missing the bus and jump jump jump.

544
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:43,499
Speaker 0: Yep, one word songs.

545
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:47,075
Speaker 0: and the thing is they had more lyrics than gwk though I mean jump and miss.

546
00:32:47,155 --> 00:32:48,462
Speaker 0: I miss the bus is four words.

547
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:53,390
Speaker 0: You know it's like They had all that six words, so it's like parties is one word.

548
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,666
Speaker 1: You know they had other words than I miss the bus in.

549
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:57,410
Speaker 1: I miss the bus.

550
00:32:58,132 --> 00:33:04,410
Speaker 1: I haven't heard that song since there's a lyrical narrative of the touching story of a young man who misses the bus.

551
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,655
Speaker 0: I gotta go find that on YouTube.

552
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:06,680
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

553
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:08,750
Speaker 1: I gotta see if I can find videos of their concerts.

554
00:33:09,432 --> 00:33:09,814
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

555
00:33:10,035 --> 00:33:12,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was one of the earlier concerts.

556
00:33:12,505 --> 00:33:13,630
Speaker 1: I went to in my entire life.

557
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:15,559
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

558
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,829
Speaker 1: I remember thinking I was so cool.

559
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:19,908
Speaker 0: Anyway, crisscross miss the bus here.

560
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:26,582
Speaker 1: It is great, so Buses generally suck ass especially for nerdy and smart kids.

561
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:34,950
Speaker 1: you just want to like read their book with the dragon on the cover Or like talk about the D&D game, but you know the other stupid kids are throwing stuff at each other.

562
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,738
Speaker 1: And there's fights on the bus and all that.

563
00:33:36,838 --> 00:33:42,090
Speaker 1: yes and in Arizona and in a lot of places There are serious problems on buses like serious fights.

564
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,489
Speaker 1: You know they put cameras on the buses.

565
00:33:44,234 --> 00:33:45,320
Speaker 1: You know deal with okay?

566
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:46,970
Speaker 0: We had fights and cameras on our buses.

567
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,190
Speaker 0: I'll see how it's any different unless unless they're stabbing we just had fist fight.

568
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,961
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fights are getting more and more serious like serious injuries.

569
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:55,090
Speaker 0: big trouble, so we never had serious injuries.

570
00:33:55,191 --> 00:34:03,752
Speaker 1: We just had fights on the bus in Vail, Arizona Where there are serious behavioral problems on the public buses because the bus rides can be up to 45 minutes long for a lot of These kids.

571
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:08,590
Speaker 1: uh-oh attention span short bus ride long for a couple hundred bucks.

572
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:18,643
Speaker 1: They put a wireless router that just gets internet from the cell network on the bus on all the buses and They give the kids free internet while they're on the bus.

573
00:34:18,663 --> 00:34:19,367
Speaker 0: who the kids?

574
00:34:19,407 --> 00:34:19,969
Speaker 0: off laptops?

575
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:21,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, netbooks.

576
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:24,710
Speaker 1: every freaking kid has a netbook outside of like a fourth grade.

577
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:26,509
Speaker 1: Well, these are like middle school.

578
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:32,230
Speaker 1: Okay Elementary kids don't have the stabbing problems as much as the middle school and high school kids.

579
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:38,610
Speaker 1: But what they discovered is that if they give the kids free internet all the behavioral problems stop straight away.

580
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,536
Speaker 1: There is no trouble on the buses at all.

581
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,527
Speaker 1: The kids are all completely quiet just on Facebook the whole time.

582
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:47,420
Speaker 0: Yeah Listen, any babysitter could have told you like a hundred years ago.

583
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,786
Speaker 0: You slap on a Disney movie.

584
00:34:48,826 --> 00:34:49,870
Speaker 0: kid sits down shuts up.

585
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,351
Speaker 0: That's it.

586
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:55,289
Speaker 1: I don't think a Disney movies gonna stop the sixth grade punk from stabbing the other sixth grade pump punk.

587
00:34:55,792 --> 00:35:03,010
Speaker 0: Listen, you know you could do right if I was a bus driver and see I could save a lot of money because I just Get a TV with a DVD player a lot cheaper than an internet, right?

588
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:08,590
Speaker 0: Put the same DVD on every day right, but it would be an awesome DVD like it wouldn't be.

589
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:11,610
Speaker 1: What's it gonna be that you're not gonna get sick like diehard or something?

590
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,315
Speaker 0: Right, it's something that they would.

591
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:17,430
Speaker 0: the kids would think was totally awesome and special like holy shit or like the predator, right?

592
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,910
Speaker 0: And then like the kids would build up all these rituals around it.

593
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:28,041
Speaker 0: You know like like every time during a certain scene they would do stuff and it would be like a total thing And they'd remember that for the rest of their lives.

594
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:36,890
Speaker 0: every time the predator kills that guy They Yeah, and then I could get the kids like act it out or they'd remember all the lines and we could do fun stuff.

595
00:35:37,337 --> 00:35:39,054
Speaker 0: It would be a cool time Not.

596
00:35:39,817 --> 00:35:43,270
Speaker 0: instead of internetting it would bring all the kids together around some sort of arts.

597
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:46,550
Speaker 1: I was thinking about why this work if you consider the predator be arts, which I do.

598
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,222
Speaker 0: Oh, so I would just show all of hokuto no Ken new episode each day.

599
00:35:49,242 --> 00:35:49,985
Speaker 0: There's 180 days of school.

600
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,988
Speaker 0: We would finish the show before the year was over.

601
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,758
Speaker 0: Watch hokuto no Ken in the morning.

602
00:35:54,798 --> 00:35:56,305
Speaker 0: I mean you could watch Rosa for sign the way home.

603
00:35:56,406 --> 00:35:57,230
Speaker 1: then you get the next year.

604
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:58,658
Speaker 1: You know the seventh graders are like.

605
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:04,390
Speaker 1: they've seen it all already and the sixth graders Watch Pokemon will watch whatever one episode a day.

606
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,184
Speaker 1: So the sixth graders like oh, no, what's gonna happen to catch your own?

607
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:08,230
Speaker 1: the seventh graders have the law.

608
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:11,037
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you haven't even seen row.

609
00:36:11,077 --> 00:36:13,544
Speaker 0: you watch a bus ride right every day.

610
00:36:13,564 --> 00:36:15,870
Speaker 0: Imagine like a bus got like 40 kids.

611
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:16,450
Speaker 0: They all go what?

612
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:18,786
Speaker 0: all at the same time.

613
00:36:19,751 --> 00:36:24,170
Speaker 1: But I realized why this internet thing is working so well and it's not just the babysitter syndrome.

614
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,781
Speaker 0: They would fight each other but they would use hokuto.

615
00:36:25,802 --> 00:36:26,950
Speaker 0: no Ken, so it would be permissible.

616
00:36:28,254 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 0: Not because of the southern cross.

617
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,530
Speaker 0: It would solve the fighting problem in the reverse direction.

618
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,129
Speaker 0: It would make the fights, you know finishable.

619
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:36,630
Speaker 1: But and there are a lot of like anecdotes and like kids talking about it.

620
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:47,697
Speaker 1: And I think what's going on here Is that all the nerdy kids who would get picked on or who don't have anyone to talk to are just talking to all the other nerdy kids elsewhere in the world with internet.

621
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:55,448
Speaker 1: because some nerdy kid in like Arizona has more in common with the nerdy kid in Germany and the Nerdy kid in like Australia than he does with all the other kids on his bus,

622
00:36:55,649 --> 00:37:02,181
Speaker 0: dude I would just fucking bring my DS and play games If I had it, you know I don't even need fucking internet on the bus.

623
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:06,142
Speaker 0: if I was a kid today on the bus Everyone would have a DS and everyone be playing.

624
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:06,665
Speaker 0: no player.

625
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:07,490
Speaker 1: This is the thing.

626
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,619
Speaker 1: The kids do have these things but there's still behavioral problems.

627
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,389
Speaker 0: The behavioral problems only stop even behavioral problems with everyone playing DS Scott.

628
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,310
Speaker 1: Yeah The whole point of this article is that the behavioral problems only stopped suddenly like a hundred percent when they gave them internet.

629
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:24,686
Speaker 1: But nothing distracted them nothing they could bring.

630
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:30,350
Speaker 1: because thing, you know the nerdy kid with the DS is playing his game and the other nerdy kid with his dragon book is reading his dragon book and The.

631
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:33,506
Speaker 1: the problem kid, you know takes the kids DS and breaks it.

632
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:34,330
Speaker 0: Why doesn't he have his own DS?

633
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,720
Speaker 0: Why isn't he playing against the nerdy kid?

634
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,970
Speaker 0: because it's the social stuff.

635
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:44,630
Speaker 1: This is what matters the fact that the kids want social interaction many of them But there's no one near them that they want to socially interact with.

636
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:50,610
Speaker 1: So what happens when you give them internet is the kids who are all internet are gonna talk to all their internet friends elsewhere.

637
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:52,509
Speaker 1: I mean look at how many kids today.

638
00:37:53,032 --> 00:38:00,488
Speaker 1: They basically can't wait to get the hell out of high school because they have real friends on the internet and they know that when They get to college they'll just be real friends with the same kinds of people.

639
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:05,349
Speaker 1: and the kids who don't have that are the ones who are gonna talk to each other and do the stuff on the bus.

640
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:15,790
Speaker 1: and The fact that giving kids the internet causes the problems to go away But DS is and books and TV and all these other things don't really points that social interaction is the root cause.

641
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,026
Speaker 0: I think fist of the North Star would keep them under control.

642
00:38:18,167 --> 00:38:24,545
Speaker 1: possibly It's hard to say that might also lead to serious bodily injury But that would be okay.

643
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:29,030
Speaker 0: bodily injury Like I already said it would not be like, you know when kids tried to do fake wrestling moves.

644
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:32,289
Speaker 0: It would be like, you know, one kid would hit the other kid his head would explode and I'll be that.

645
00:38:35,894 --> 00:38:40,943
Speaker 1: So a long time ago Google decided to make something that the world had not really seen.

646
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:42,710
Speaker 1: they made a social network.

647
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:49,620
Speaker 0: Well, I mean they didn't make or cut like oh they sort of did like a guy who worked for them made it But he sort of know didn't he make it?

648
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,526
Speaker 0: but then Google bought him.

649
00:38:50,566 --> 00:38:56,973
Speaker 1: so it was something weird I forget exactly what happened but or cut appeared and all of us jumped on it like oh, wow This is awesome.

650
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:02,389
Speaker 1: And then about six months later the nation of Brazil discovered this thing and that was the end of it.

651
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:05,670
Speaker 1: Mmm, I believe it's still used in Brazil and nowhere else.

652
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:11,326
Speaker 0: It says it's one of the Wikipedia says it's one of the most visited websites in India and Brazil.

653
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,249
Speaker 1: Oh India, huh?

654
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:18,992
Speaker 0: 51% of orcas users from Brazil filed by India with 20% and us with 17.

655
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,636
Speaker 1: What those 70% must be?

656
00:39:20,676 --> 00:39:22,059
Speaker 1: people who came from Brazil?

657
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,505
Speaker 0: Maybe there or India you could be.

658
00:39:24,886 --> 00:39:26,490
Speaker 1: it's otherwise it's impossible to use.

659
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:29,830
Speaker 0: It's 60th in the world and has more than a hundred million active users.

660
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:32,098
Speaker 1: But it's funny how you know.

661
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:35,610
Speaker 1: people always come to me and say things like why are you not on Facebook?

662
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,164
Speaker 1: You're so internet II and you're so like I had to the curve and all this internet stuff.

663
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:46,096
Speaker 1: and yet you don't use these social Networks and all I have to do is point back and say I used the first social network and I realized everything that's wrong With them.

664
00:39:46,116 --> 00:39:49,328
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm but the thing was orchid failed.

665
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:58,667
Speaker 1: and Now that I look at Facebook and basically I didn't realize this fundamental truth about social networks until oh shit Google's trying again with Google buzz.

666
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,922
Speaker 1: Google buzz is kind of doing things the opposite way that everyone else did.

667
00:40:03,963 --> 00:40:06,169
Speaker 1: then look at Facebook and or cut and all these things.

668
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:07,657
Speaker 1: They're walled gardens.

669
00:40:07,998 --> 00:40:10,230
Speaker 1: everyone looks at them as though they're walled gardens.

670
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:10,752
Speaker 1: They they're like.

671
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:17,119
Speaker 1: I will put my information in this thing and I'll interact with people entirely within the context of this thing.

672
00:40:17,139 --> 00:40:21,842
Speaker 1: and recently Facebook has like their Interactions to the outside like it can be.

673
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:23,350
Speaker 0: Facebook has had that for a long time.

674
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,570
Speaker 0: They had Facebook connect and they you can make a Facebook app and Facebook can talk to any other website.

675
00:40:27,831 --> 00:40:30,099
Speaker 0: You just got to go through their API and Twitter is the same way.

676
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,449
Speaker 0: Twitter as an API and Google has had open social For quite a while as well.

677
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:38,250
Speaker 1: Yeah But people didn't use that stuff a lot until people started using Twitter.

678
00:40:38,813 --> 00:40:42,530
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people unless someone else like set up an integration for them.

679
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:46,865
Speaker 1: They just lived in Facebook land and then they had the rest of their internet life separate from Facebook land.

680
00:40:46,885 --> 00:40:59,462
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm But I think the whole walled garden thing is the cause of a lot of the problems we have with social networks especially when it comes to privacy and Google with buzz seems to be taking kind of the opposite approach of that.

681
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:03,255
Speaker 1: It's not really a walled garden it's just an interface.

682
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:19,049
Speaker 1: like your point from Google just goes out in every direction with every possible means from by default from the start and I think that's why all the people who use Facebook Seem to hate Google buzz and all the people who have not been using social networks up till now seem to love Google buzz.

683
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:24,110
Speaker 1: Because it's weird, you know you look online and there's a lot of a lot of what people say about Google buzz.

684
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,119
Speaker 1: It's really really negative.

685
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:35,482
Speaker 1: people really hate it and people like well I'm not using Gmail anymore and all these concerns about privacy and like it's all the news about it is bad Except among the really tech people who don't use Facebook.

686
00:41:35,543 --> 00:41:42,336
Speaker 0: even the really tech people, you know If you look on like all the nerdy soup like the super nerdy sites like the hacker news They're all saying the same shit.

687
00:41:42,356 --> 00:41:45,490
Speaker 0: They're saying all Google buzz privacy fail, but they use Facebook.

688
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:48,280
Speaker 0: No, they don't use Facebook either.

689
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,124
Speaker 1: I think a lot of them.

690
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:50,370
Speaker 0: They'll just use Twitter.

691
00:41:50,712 --> 00:41:53,750
Speaker 0: Some of them probably use Facebook, but you know, I think a lot of them use Facebook.

692
00:41:53,992 --> 00:41:55,605
Speaker 1: It's hard to not use Facebook.

693
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:00,710
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I've only gotten away with it because I have my own private forum and that kind of does all the things.

694
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,857
Speaker 0: They don't have Facebook, but I don't use it.

695
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:06,269
Speaker 0: You know, I point Twitter forwards to it, but that's it.

696
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:09,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, I very pointedly avoid it because I don't want to have to maintain it.

697
00:42:10,171 --> 00:42:18,198
Speaker 1: I don't want because it'll diverge like that face of rim on the internet would rapidly diverge from my face Mmm, you know in possibly a bad way.

698
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:21,590
Speaker 1: Also people might message me in it and expect me to respond.

699
00:42:22,412 --> 00:42:24,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, people message me in it and I just ignore it.

700
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:30,364
Speaker 0: Well, you know if people like try to send me like say join this club I just click the ignore button if they give me an invitation to event.

701
00:42:30,726 --> 00:42:33,077
Speaker 1: I just say no Yeah, I don't even want to have to click.

702
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,890
Speaker 0: I don't know I could just ignore it, but I'd set it up.

703
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:41,984
Speaker 0: So it sends me an email, you know just in case cuz you never know Someone might eat send me a message on Facebook that says hey want a million dollars.

704
00:42:42,044 --> 00:42:43,470
Speaker 1: So I don't want that risk.

705
00:42:43,591 --> 00:42:45,723
Speaker 1: I don't want the risk of there ever being communication.

706
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:46,830
Speaker 1: that matters over a chance.

707
00:42:48,094 --> 00:42:49,981
Speaker 0: It goes through email, that's why I said so.

708
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:52,590
Speaker 1: it's not an unintended communication from Facebook.

709
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:56,289
Speaker 1: Just by the mechanism design of Facebook could slip through and I don't want that either.

710
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:00,833
Speaker 0: Whatever Is that anyway?

711
00:43:00,853 --> 00:43:03,583
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the people going nuts over this privacy thing.

712
00:43:03,843 --> 00:43:12,210
Speaker 0: I think that the big problem is People have like too much Emotional investment in like what it says on the screen.

713
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:18,955
Speaker 0: It's weird because at the one hand they don't read what's on the screen But on the other hand certain things they read on the screen Like they care about them too much.

714
00:43:18,975 --> 00:43:19,417
Speaker 0: Well think of this.

715
00:43:19,437 --> 00:43:19,778
Speaker 1: they hate.

716
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:27,750
Speaker 1: they'd hate reading what's on the screen, but they love inputting data About themselves on the screen, but they only want certain people to see that data.

717
00:43:27,991 --> 00:43:29,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like, you know, you have.

718
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,930
Speaker 0: I think there's actually room for a third place here, right?

719
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,470
Speaker 0: So you got the one place which is Twitter, right and Twitter you post something and then the whole world can see it.

720
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:41,303
Speaker 0: And if you do the stupid private thing, what the hell is the point?

721
00:43:41,404 --> 00:43:44,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never understood Why they offer that feature, right?

722
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,559
Speaker 0: So Twitter is you just broadcast to the world and that's that.

723
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:50,810
Speaker 0: and who cares if someone follows you or you follow someone?

724
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,240
Speaker 0: It's not it doesn't really well.

725
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:56,981
Speaker 1: it gets around the spam problem Just with a very simple network of trust that you only follow people who care about.

726
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:11,110
Speaker 0: you can't get spammed unless you follow people who suck Yep, so and then you got Facebook, which is you know was originally more like or cut but then moved To being more like Twitter where it's you know with the status update model, right?

727
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:20,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course or cut had the weird problem of it had all that status stuff and that's actually what brought it down in The end because people could respond to friends and friends of friends and it was made.

728
00:44:20,886 --> 00:44:22,090
Speaker 1: there was zero spam protection.

729
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,129
Speaker 1: Mmm Facebook has a lot of things to protect you from I guess obvious like Viagra.

730
00:44:28,149 --> 00:44:31,079
Speaker 1: spam Yeah, but it doesn't protect you from your friends being dumbass.

731
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:35,389
Speaker 0: Facebook or cut also had the groups like you join a group and then You would get all sorts of shit for that.

732
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because a million people speaking Portuguese would join your group and talk about things unrelated to the group.

733
00:44:39,731 --> 00:44:41,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never understood what was going on.

734
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:42,489
Speaker 0: That's not reading again.

735
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:49,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing with Facebook right is that you're only with your friends, but people seem to strangely really care, right?

736
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,976
Speaker 0: They don't care if you're following or not following on Twitter At least I don't think they are.

737
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:55,190
Speaker 0: but they really care if your friends on Facebook.

738
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,038
Speaker 0: So it's like if you don't friend someone who knows you.

739
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:59,550
Speaker 0: it's like they'll feel bad and you feel obligated.

740
00:45:00,092 --> 00:45:02,400
Speaker 0: You know, I don't feel that way at all.

741
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,210
Speaker 1: It's like it comes out of the whole walled garden mentality.

742
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,930
Speaker 1: They look at Facebook as this thing separate from other things.

743
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:11,750
Speaker 1: So and all the drama about Facebook comes of that idea.

744
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:18,444
Speaker 1: I mean look at you know Say like a lot of people have the problem of their boss sees that they're on Facebook and ask them for a friend invite Mm-hmm.

745
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:34,244
Speaker 1: And now they don't want to actually say yes because they don't want their boss to see all the stuff that they shared with just their Friends, but they don't want to say no to their boss because then their boss gets mad at them And it's a no-win situation because they have these weird Expectations that Facebook does not account for and inside of the walled garden.

746
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,990
Speaker 1: There's no context for dealing with them.

747
00:45:36,131 --> 00:45:43,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I think also that Something on I don't know go nowhere with that I was thinking about.

748
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:46,870
Speaker 0: I've had something and then I thought about the car that I had to go pick up when it's fixed.

749
00:45:47,091 --> 00:45:48,235
Speaker 1: Well again, look at the walled garden.

750
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:55,306
Speaker 1: Another problem is that people expect that they can control What level people see of them like when they use Facebook.

751
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,930
Speaker 1: they expect that?

752
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:02,090
Speaker 1: All right, I will put this picture of me naked and drunk and like punching some like puppy in the face.

753
00:46:02,753 --> 00:46:04,262
Speaker 1: You know, this is just what happened at a party.

754
00:46:04,503 --> 00:46:05,750
Speaker 1: They want to share it with all their friends.

755
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:16,107
Speaker 1: they put it in Facebook and they say only my friends can see this and They somehow expect that that will protect them and that that picture is never going to appear anywhere else on the internet ever.

756
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:20,670
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that's something you got to realize, you know, you might post something on Facebook.

757
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:22,599
Speaker 0: Let's say I only have one Facebook friend in the world.

758
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:26,439
Speaker 0: It's rim and I post a picture of me I don't know dancing stupidly.

759
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:31,950
Speaker 0: that is already on flicker like Rim can just take the picture and put it on the Internet's right?

760
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,147
Speaker 0: So any privacy that you think you have is totally an illusion right?

761
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:36,790
Speaker 0: people are all upset.

762
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:38,458
Speaker 0: Oh privacy this privacy that?

763
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,026
Speaker 0: no really you don't have any.

764
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:41,153
Speaker 0: if it's on the internet It's all.

765
00:46:41,193 --> 00:46:45,699
Speaker 0: you might as well be on the front page of the newspaper Anywhere on the internet no matter how private you think it is.

766
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,730
Speaker 0: you make a flicker account you turn off all public photo posting.

767
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,060
Speaker 0: You turn off everything.

768
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:51,290
Speaker 0: you put it on flicker.

769
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:55,970
Speaker 0: Maybe some guy at flicker is searching through and he sees your picture and he's like, oh, that's the best picture.

770
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:57,396
Speaker 0: It sneaks out somewhere.

771
00:46:57,476 --> 00:46:58,300
Speaker 0: No one knows who did it.

772
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,464
Speaker 0: So he doesn't get in trouble.

773
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:00,830
Speaker 0: And then what are you doing?

774
00:47:01,191 --> 00:47:02,235
Speaker 1: Well, the trouble isn't some.

775
00:47:02,255 --> 00:47:06,330
Speaker 1: I mean you can't do things privately if you either use your own servers or software.

776
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:16,026
Speaker 1: That's true you could but the trade-off there is that you can either do stuff in your own Completely private walled garden or you have to let other people in which basically gives you no privacy.

777
00:47:16,046 --> 00:47:18,876
Speaker 0: unless you as soon as you let One person in you're letting everybody in.

778
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:23,150
Speaker 1: but every day people want to share information about themselves.

779
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,350
Speaker 1: They want to have like their photo stream and their updates and everything.

780
00:47:26,872 --> 00:47:31,130
Speaker 1: But they have this weird hang up where they only want them to go to certain people which is also fine.

781
00:47:31,632 --> 00:47:44,590
Speaker 1: But they don't trust the people the other people enough or they rely on trusting the other people too much and if you go too much in either direction, you're screwed and They run into these weird social situations where they have their real friends.

782
00:47:44,892 --> 00:47:58,275
Speaker 1: But then there's people who think that they're their friends but they're not really and they're Confronted in these walled gardens with the fact that they have to either Friend the person and give them access to the secret side of their lives or not friend them and reveal the fact that they Don't actually like this person.

783
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:02,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like because people are you know, not high-quality people.

784
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,675
Speaker 0: They have drama in their lives.

785
00:48:03,936 --> 00:48:08,750
Speaker 0: then the drama the the internet forces the exposure of this drama due to the framework.

786
00:48:08,991 --> 00:48:14,970
Speaker 0: you know the way the social network dictates for relationships, yep, and Google Buzz.

787
00:48:15,111 --> 00:48:20,430
Speaker 1: I think the reason it's getting so much flack from so many people is that they have all these walled garden expectations.

788
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:24,950
Speaker 1: But Google is taking the exact opposite model and making it not at all a walled garden.

789
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,610
Speaker 1: It's just kind of a self-publishing thing.

790
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:30,320
Speaker 1: There's just you and you just publish out to the world.

791
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:32,427
Speaker 1: and if you don't want to publish out to the world don't.

792
00:48:32,808 --> 00:48:33,130
Speaker 1: and that's it.

793
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:34,519
Speaker 1: There's kind of no middle ground.

794
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,170
Speaker 0: There's a private button and a public button.

795
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,273
Speaker 0: I don't see what the problem was that people had, you know It's like.

796
00:48:39,313 --> 00:48:45,407
Speaker 0: well if I have a post a funny picture I can put I can click specifically who I wanted to go to and then push a button.

797
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:47,350
Speaker 1: Well their problem What were the biggest problem?

798
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:49,101
Speaker 1: I've seen people complaining about is that kind of?

799
00:48:49,142 --> 00:48:54,709
Speaker 1: by default if you're using it It'll add to the top of your friends list the people you email most often.

800
00:48:55,293 --> 00:48:58,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, and obviously there are people you email a lot that are not your friends.

801
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,273
Speaker 0: You don't any friends with that.

802
00:48:59,293 --> 00:49:04,733
Speaker 0: There was a big popular post that was like, you know abusive ex-boyfriend Automatically followed.

803
00:49:04,773 --> 00:49:08,286
Speaker 0: it's like so just unfollow the dude, you know, it's like.

804
00:49:08,848 --> 00:49:09,390
Speaker 0: what's the big deal?

805
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:27,230
Speaker 1: Well, I think what is gonna come down to is that people who I kind of get like when a walled garden is useful and And people who understand what is possible with internet privacy and what isn't are probably all going to migrate toward Google buzz or toward nothing and Everyone else is going to stay on Facebook.

806
00:49:27,331 --> 00:49:37,630
Speaker 1: I don't think Google buzz actually competes with Facebook except that People who wanted something more like buzz who use Facebook just because it's the default that exists are going to move if they can.

807
00:49:37,951 --> 00:49:41,950
Speaker 0: I don't see a lot of people going to Google buzz because every post I see is how do I turn it off?

808
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:47,560
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like Windows Vista where people have a false perception, you know And thus they all just turn it off and hate it.

809
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:56,503
Speaker 1: and whatever the gods get in my gmail Google buzz is brilliant because in the long run I think the way it's gonna go is that the things you publish out of it It doesn't even need to be buzz.

810
00:49:56,544 --> 00:49:57,350
Speaker 1: It could be anything.

811
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:05,323
Speaker 0: Yeah, my hope is that it will be like Google talk where first no one really used it But eventually everyone used it just because it was in their Gmail on their face all the time.

812
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:14,112
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be more like Effectively giving everyone the means to run their own Social network, but it's not a walled garden It's just.

813
00:50:14,714 --> 00:50:19,030
Speaker 1: I put my updates out and they appear in whatever format everyone else would see them in.

814
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:19,594
Speaker 1: You know, it puts.

815
00:50:19,654 --> 00:50:20,561
Speaker 1: it pushes them to Twitter.

816
00:50:20,863 --> 00:50:21,770
Speaker 1: It pushes them to Facebook.

817
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:22,770
Speaker 1: It pushes them to websites.

818
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:28,410
Speaker 1: But for me buzz is like the command console where I am sending out all the updates to everywhere.

819
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,054
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

820
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,282
Speaker 1: That's my hope for it.

821
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:31,410
Speaker 1: That's what I will use it for.

822
00:50:31,591 --> 00:50:33,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you're not you know, you have nothing to hide.

823
00:50:33,843 --> 00:50:35,170
Speaker 0: don't give a shit about suit privacy.

824
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:37,480
Speaker 1: I do have things to hide and you know where those are you hiding?

825
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:39,590
Speaker 1: we know what those are in our form.

826
00:50:39,632 --> 00:50:43,304
Speaker 1: You know We have the the geek nights farm and everyone uses it and we have the private part of it.

827
00:50:43,344 --> 00:50:46,396
Speaker 1: just for our actual friends We made our own wall guard.

828
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:50,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm not trying to keep that private because there's stuff in there I don't want anyone to see.

829
00:50:50,796 --> 00:50:51,721
Speaker 0: I keep it private.

830
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:54,939
Speaker 0: private because then people you know It's not relevant to those guys.

831
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,730
Speaker 0: So they would be they just be like what the fuck is this shit?

832
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,320
Speaker 1: I don't know why you're trying to argue with me.

833
00:50:58,361 --> 00:50:59,650
Speaker 1: I'm saying the exact same thing.

834
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:07,055
Speaker 1: I keep it private because it's basically walled gardens have a place for example in the private form is where I'll say hey having a Party at my apartment.

835
00:51:07,096 --> 00:51:08,424
Speaker 1: Here's the address and the time.

836
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:09,390
Speaker 0: who cares of people?

837
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:17,329
Speaker 1: I don't care if anyone knows the address in the time, you know I don't want to tell everyone in the world when I'm having a private get-together because then people will show up.

838
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:22,349
Speaker 0: Did you tell you know you got this visibly say hey you and you and you are invited and you're not.

839
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:24,377
Speaker 1: and That's how I use the forum.

840
00:51:24,638 --> 00:51:26,890
Speaker 1: I know that in my walled garden only X people are there.

841
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:38,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is is that I think people are just too concerned with like, you know privacy in general And they're also, you know get upset when they see things that they don't want to see.

842
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:46,936
Speaker 0: You know like that person who just saw that their abusive ex-boyfriend's email address is listed in like the following thing Automatically got upset.

843
00:51:47,077 --> 00:51:49,967
Speaker 0: It's like it's just a name on a screen.

844
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:50,750
Speaker 0: You can get rid of it.

845
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:52,796
Speaker 0: Why are you upset just over the appearance of it?

846
00:51:52,897 --> 00:51:56,970
Speaker 0: I get I get requests from people very very frequently on the forum.

847
00:51:57,291 --> 00:52:01,670
Speaker 0: They want the ability to like block posts and I'm like just ignore it.

848
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:04,580
Speaker 0: If there's a thread that doesn't interest you just scroll past it.

849
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:08,400
Speaker 0: if there's a comment that is someone is you know You don't like that person.

850
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,570
Speaker 0: just don't read their comment.

851
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,056
Speaker 0: Just you know use your scroll wheel.

852
00:52:11,076 --> 00:52:13,948
Speaker 0: doo doo doo and people have a really hard time with this.

853
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:14,349
Speaker 0: like they're like.

854
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,435
Speaker 0: no I need to block it I need to make it go away.

855
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:19,527
Speaker 0: and what I think what buzz does that makes a lot of people upset?

856
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:23,630
Speaker 0: is that because Google is spidering the internet and gets all this information.

857
00:52:24,092 --> 00:52:29,210
Speaker 0: It's grabbing all this stuff and putting it in your face and you need to do stuff to make it go away.

858
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,699
Speaker 0: You know and me I don't need.

859
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,610
Speaker 0: I don't have this compulsion to click and make it go away.

860
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,756
Speaker 0: I'll just scroll past it.

861
00:52:35,796 --> 00:52:38,430
Speaker 0: but other people they had to keep clicking to make it go away.

862
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,738
Speaker 0: And what is it when you're clicking to make things go away?

863
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,047
Speaker 0: It's like deleting spam from your email.

864
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:43,930
Speaker 0: That's what it's like.

865
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:48,042
Speaker 0: So they feel like Google buzz is spam.

866
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:52,415
Speaker 1: Whereas something like Twitter or Facebook is most of the complaints I've seen actually weren't along those lines.

867
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:56,970
Speaker 1: They were along the lines of information about them got out that they didn't want out.

868
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,692
Speaker 1: And the biggest one is still the contact thing Like.

869
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:08,051
Speaker 1: basically it would show other people The people you're emailing the most often and a lot of people were not comfortable with the fact that that information became public Automatically.

870
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:14,430
Speaker 0: Oh, no, you know who I'm emailing because I'm you know, I have secret emails to to like.

871
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,310
Speaker 0: You know this this porn site and now you know that I'm emailing this porn site.

872
00:53:18,432 --> 00:53:25,430
Speaker 1: That was a big problem with Firefox when they when they like change the way it would do a lot of like bookmarks and suggestions and stuff and it would like.

873
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:35,910
Speaker 1: people would always have like, you know, ten layers of bookmarks and then under like the kittens and the puppies and Like the taxes way at the bottom was a folder called like documents and then there was all the porn links.

874
00:53:36,191 --> 00:53:37,883
Speaker 0: Why do you even bookmark a porn site?

875
00:53:37,903 --> 00:53:38,950
Speaker 0: You can't remember the name of it.

876
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,550
Speaker 0: You can't just search for it on Google again.

877
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:46,150
Speaker 1: But this was a problem because you know Like it's just be a 45 year old husband who hides his porn links from his wife.

878
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:51,570
Speaker 1: Suddenly the porn links are like on the front of Firefox like here are the pages you visit most often.

879
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:53,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and here's the other problem, right?

880
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,458
Speaker 0: I think this is actually this is.

881
00:53:55,518 --> 00:53:58,190
Speaker 0: I think this is kind of why I don't have a problem with it.

882
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,937
Speaker 0: Other people do right is like.

883
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:03,450
Speaker 0: I look at that person and I'm saying why is you know?

884
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:08,010
Speaker 0: The technology is sort of exposing you and making you confront a problem in your real life.

885
00:54:08,331 --> 00:54:13,890
Speaker 0: Why are you hiding your porn links from your wife who is supposed to be the most important person in the world in your life?

886
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:21,652
Speaker 0: If you you know married them, right if I had a wife and I had porn it would be like hey honey Let's watch some porn That.

887
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:26,432
Speaker 0: so the people have privacy issues with this privacy stuff Right?

888
00:54:26,713 --> 00:54:31,890
Speaker 0: are people who have personal issues that they need to resolve and then they wouldn't have such a problem with it.

889
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:41,830
Speaker 0: like if I'm emailing someone else way often and You're bothered by that then either that's you have an issue or I have an issue.

890
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:43,376
Speaker 0: I'm keeping something secret from you.

891
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:50,325
Speaker 0: Like if my girlfriend sees that I'm emailing this other girl constantly Obviously, I'm just a shithead who's cheating.

892
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:55,645
Speaker 0: or you know She is Jealous and doesn't realize that that person's just a friend and is all bitchy.

893
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:56,770
Speaker 0: in which case why is she my girlfriend?

894
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,322
Speaker 1: See it's tricky because you don't want to go all the way down the slope of.

895
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:02,930
Speaker 1: if you got nothing to hide Then you don't care about people snooping on you.

896
00:55:03,411 --> 00:55:08,125
Speaker 1: I think it's more that people need to understand what is possible and what isn't with privacy.

897
00:55:08,226 --> 00:55:16,309
Speaker 1: on a fundamental level and independently people need to be able to confront the ugly truths about themselves and their friends and That's I think we're all.

898
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:36,690
Speaker 1: 90% of the drama about privacy and social networks Facebook internet everything comes down to the fact that a lot of people have friends But they keep different of their friends at like different levels of information and they don't want Information to leak beyond all these kind of arbitrary boundaries they've set up in their own lives.

899
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:42,643
Speaker 1: But at the same time they want to publish information To all their friends and they're not technical enough to do it on their own.

900
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,913
Speaker 1: They're not good enough to do it in person Mm-hmm.

901
00:55:45,094 --> 00:55:45,777
Speaker 0: So I watched.

902
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,466
Speaker 0: this is sort of relevant, right?

903
00:55:47,527 --> 00:55:51,339
Speaker 0: I watched The the TED talk of moot the fortune guy.

904
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,470
Speaker 0: I still gotta watch that and he was talking about how you know the internet.

905
00:55:54,631 --> 00:55:56,859
Speaker 0: You know, he wants more things to be crazy.

906
00:55:56,899 --> 00:55:58,645
Speaker 0: anonymous like fortune is right.

907
00:55:58,665 --> 00:55:59,930
Speaker 0: So I was like, huh?

908
00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:03,824
Speaker 0: Maybe I will make something that is crazy anonymous like fortune but not fortune.

909
00:56:03,965 --> 00:56:05,210
Speaker 1: an anonymous social network.

910
00:56:05,371 --> 00:56:08,830
Speaker 0: That's completely and I wouldn't work as the social network is defined by identity.

911
00:56:08,911 --> 00:56:09,298
Speaker 0: It's just.

912
00:56:09,318 --> 00:56:10,009
Speaker 0: no couldn't do that.

913
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:10,592
Speaker 1: You could do it.

914
00:56:10,733 --> 00:56:19,090
Speaker 1: you could do it if it was an anonymous social network where you create your persona and you use some Sort of a verifiable means of proving your identity when you're posting to it and you're doing stuff with it.

915
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:20,510
Speaker 0: But then it's not anonymous.

916
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:25,590
Speaker 1: It's anonymous in that you can prove that the person who made those posts before is the same person now.

917
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:26,394
Speaker 0: But that's the point.

918
00:56:26,434 --> 00:56:27,581
Speaker 0: Is it anonymous means?

919
00:56:27,621 --> 00:56:28,929
Speaker 0: No, it's not every single post.

920
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:35,170
Speaker 1: No, another way to have anonymous is that you have a verifiable identity that cannot be linked to your real identity.

921
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:41,950
Speaker 1: You can have a separate completely like self-consistent identity that unless you fuck up is not linked to your real identity.

922
00:56:42,472 --> 00:56:45,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's not that's not that's not the anonymous that we're talking about.

923
00:56:45,824 --> 00:56:53,690
Speaker 1: anonymous like fortune is, you know It's supposed you're saying anonymous capital a because anonymity means there are a lot of great fortune is I mean and not.

924
00:56:53,931 --> 00:57:00,710
Speaker 0: Fortune also has the feature where you can you know make an identity with a code so that you know people can verify you.

925
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:03,070
Speaker 0: But you can also post completely anonymously.

926
00:57:03,251 --> 00:57:08,670
Speaker 0: No one even knows if that's a brand new person or and that's you know, you can't have that at all on a social network.

927
00:57:09,213 --> 00:57:12,570
Speaker 0: So, you know it just it's counter to the idea of a social network.

928
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:13,436
Speaker 1: Well, but Scott you that's cuz.

929
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:15,490
Speaker 1: you're using this very specific definition of anonymity.

930
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:17,850
Speaker 0: That's what that's the kind of anonymous I was talking about.

931
00:57:18,332 --> 00:57:28,410
Speaker 0: So anyway, I think that we I'm trying to think of something I should make that is completely anonymous But on the other hand, I should also make something that is like the opposite of anonymous.

932
00:57:28,551 --> 00:57:32,270
Speaker 0: What it could be is make some sort of Facebook like thing, right?

933
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:46,187
Speaker 0: Maybe even simpler than Facebook but make it like Real friends only because I've read a lot of these studies that show that even when people have like a Facebook They actually only communicate heavily with like four or five six people.

934
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:57,400
Speaker 0: people have a very Small circle of people they actually communicate with extremely often like, you know wife girlfriend brother mom dad You know friend it's you know, that's pretty much it.

935
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,850
Speaker 0: for like the vast majority of people statistically Like 90% of their communication is with like six people.

936
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:14,490
Speaker 1: but what they do is they have like hundreds of Facebook friends and they watch all the update like they did passively consume the Updates from these other people but they don't actually interact except that those other people passively consume their updates.

937
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:23,041
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna make some sort of social network right and the way it could work is You only are ever actually going to friend those six people.

938
00:58:23,302 --> 00:58:23,944
Speaker 0: That's the idea.

939
00:58:24,045 --> 00:58:25,690
Speaker 0: You're never gonna friend all these other people.

940
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,665
Speaker 1: You're only gonna friend the real friends and it bears all 100% no matter what.

941
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:33,050
Speaker 0: no Well, you know, I mean to those people, you know, yeah, that's the point.

942
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:33,652
Speaker 1: Oh that you're right.

943
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:36,804
Speaker 0: But the thing is how do you make it to where?

944
00:58:36,864 --> 00:58:37,868
Speaker 0: how do you friend someone?

945
00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:38,350
Speaker 0: Right?

946
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:39,269
Speaker 0: How is that gonna work?

947
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:46,915
Speaker 0: And the way it would work is you just sort of type in people that are your real friends and it doesn't send Requests to them right?

948
00:58:46,935 --> 00:58:48,239
Speaker 0: it just sort of.

949
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:56,550
Speaker 0: you just type in a list of your real friends and then other people Type in a list of their real friends and where there is a match it will actually friend.

950
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:59,270
Speaker 1: you Make an account for someone who I know doesn't have an account on it.

951
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:03,374
Speaker 1: I pretend to be them and then I put in a list of everyone they know and wait for that and then I basically Man in the middle.

952
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:05,350
Speaker 0: Okay that we have to solve these.

953
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:11,251
Speaker 0: But you get the idea and that there would be some sort of system Compromise.

954
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:15,850
Speaker 0: Yes, there would be some sort of system by which you would only actually friend the real friends.

955
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:19,530
Speaker 0: You know if somebody was on it and they said hey, why don't you friend me on the thing?

956
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:22,999
Speaker 0: You would say I'm not on the thing, you know You could just lie and they couldn't.

957
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,790
Speaker 0: they wouldn't know if you were on there or not.

958
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:34,327
Speaker 0: there would be no way for them to know whether you were there or not, so you could totally lie and You would only you know friend your mom dad brother girlfriend kids course.

959
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:38,402
Speaker 1: at the same time I feel like with Facebook they should have grades of friends like.

960
00:59:38,903 --> 00:59:39,967
Speaker 0: well, that's what I actually do.

961
00:59:40,007 --> 00:59:42,010
Speaker 0: have that on Facebook I have to have a limb.

962
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:53,931
Speaker 0: What I do is I friend everyone on Facebook who requests unless they're obviously like spam like, you know It's one of those fake Non-existent people and if it's someone I don't know I just check limited profile and if it's someone I do know then I just say yes,

963
00:59:54,171 --> 01:00:00,710
Speaker 1: but see I think it'd be interesting if you had a proper gradation of like say five levels and you just could have like.

964
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,614
Speaker 0: You can say they have that.

965
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:04,285
Speaker 1: you can set that up, but they don't give you control over everything.

966
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:09,546
Speaker 1: No Facebook There are a lot of things where you can't control a hundred percent between different groups.

967
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:10,429
Speaker 1: Like how much they see.

968
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:21,030
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that you can say like, you know Anyone on this list allow them to do this and this and this but not this and this and this but a lot of those Lists a lot of those this and this and this is our all or nothing.

969
01:00:21,392 --> 01:00:29,170
Speaker 0: Well, they're like, you know post on my wall see my wall You know show their posts in my feed don't show their posts in my feed allowed them to see my address.

970
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:30,141
Speaker 0: I love them to see my phone number.

971
01:00:30,162 --> 01:00:31,352
Speaker 1: one thing that orchid I remember.

972
01:00:31,432 --> 01:00:36,991
Speaker 1: I remember doing something along the lines of you kind of noted how much of a friend they were and You can.

973
01:00:37,011 --> 01:00:43,403
Speaker 1: I like that idea because you can have like your layers of friends very openly Like these are my best friends.

974
01:00:43,665 --> 01:00:44,210
Speaker 1: I'm friends with you.

975
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:50,749
Speaker 0: Then you still then you still have that same problem where it's like, you know Request to be a friend with you and they put five and you put one.

976
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:54,490
Speaker 1: But the thing is that is that has always been a problem in humanity.

977
01:00:54,610 --> 01:01:00,490
Speaker 1: That is just the fact that a lot of people have really fucked up social interactions with their neighbors and friends.

978
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:05,430
Speaker 0: I hope my hope is that in people being forced to confront their social problems will fix them.

979
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,519
Speaker 0: But I know that the reality that is probably not the case.

980
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I it'll probably just make more drama.

981
01:01:10,511 --> 01:01:23,330
Speaker 1: I just think all the drama comes out of the fact that people have drama in their real lives and it just spills over into the privacy quote-unquote debate of social networks because Information kind of automatically exposes truth over time.

982
01:01:23,511 --> 01:01:24,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is see.

983
01:01:24,737 --> 01:01:32,710
Speaker 0: people have lately been talking about like, you know The old quote information wants to be free and people are like information doesn't want to be free information can't want anything.

984
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:37,004
Speaker 0: And I'm like, wow way to not get a you know metaphor.

985
01:01:37,144 --> 01:01:41,866
Speaker 1: analogy more than information Reveals all that is hidden and in the end.

986
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:42,690
Speaker 1: There's no way around.

987
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:46,782
Speaker 0: Yes, the thing is what information wants to be free means right.

988
01:01:46,822 --> 01:01:51,378
Speaker 0: is that once a piece of information has been revealed Right, you cannot.

989
01:01:51,438 --> 01:01:53,890
Speaker 0: it is incredibly difficult to bottle it up.

990
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,838
Speaker 1: He has been seen cannot to be as see.

991
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:00,990
Speaker 0: keeping a secret requires lots of effort and energy and difficulty, right?

992
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:10,510
Speaker 0: It's the momentum of information is to spread, you know the same way that it's hard to hold a boulder at the top of a hill But it's real easy to let the boulder roll down the hill.

993
01:02:10,991 --> 01:02:12,436
Speaker 1: Think about it where the drama comes from.

994
01:02:12,476 --> 01:02:19,569
Speaker 1: people they leak information out a little bit and then they don't want it to get any Further than it already got and if it does they try to like put it back in.

995
01:02:19,853 --> 01:02:22,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't do that I mean or it's incredibly difficult to do so.

996
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:32,828
Speaker 0: You know information wants to be free and that it is like a boulder at the top of a hill Once it is set loose once it is out of your mind and comes out of your mouth and someone hears it.

997
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:38,044
Speaker 0: now It can be replicated trivially and spread around the whole world with no effort whatsoever.

998
01:02:38,124 --> 01:02:44,110
Speaker 0: Just like it requires no effort whatsoever To let the boulder row down the hill and crush the houses and the cars at the bottom.

999
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:49,474
Speaker 0: But it requires a great deal of effort to like, you know, you just told someone oh shit Don't tell anyone that.

1000
01:02:49,715 --> 01:02:51,001
Speaker 0: then you have to watch that person.

1001
01:02:51,021 --> 01:02:54,332
Speaker 0: make sure they don't tell anyone that or just they do Right.

1002
01:02:54,392 --> 01:02:59,568
Speaker 0: It's incredibly difficult to keep a secret any information, you know any information that has been let out.

1003
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:04,230
Speaker 0: it is Super impossible to not let it get out even farther and farther.

1004
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,550
Speaker 1: Information wants to be free means I want to pull the debate all the way back.

1005
01:03:09,992 --> 01:03:17,470
Speaker 0: Once you have typed something into Facebook regardless of your Facebook settings You have effectively pushed the boulder over the top of the hill and it can just roll down.

1006
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:21,167
Speaker 1: So allow me to pull the argument all the way out now because this is where it's all going with.

1007
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:27,690
Speaker 1: so, you know Regardless of how much people want to have their walled gardens of you know, they want to publish their data, but they want walled gardens.

1008
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:33,650
Speaker 1: They only want to publish it to certain people and that works for things like I'm inviting you my real friends to an event.

1009
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:35,195
Speaker 1: You know, I'm doing this.

1010
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:35,838
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

1011
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:37,463
Speaker 1: You're when you're making plans with friends.

1012
01:03:37,483 --> 01:03:39,370
Speaker 1: That's no different than calling all your friends.

1013
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:40,654
Speaker 1: It's just a more efficient way of doing it.

1014
01:03:41,176 --> 01:03:48,816
Speaker 1: But when they put out information like pictures of me naked dancing on top of a flagpole It's gonna be on College Humor tomorrow.

1015
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:49,277
Speaker 0: Yes,

1016
01:03:49,719 --> 01:04:03,391
Speaker 1: but when they want to hide these sorts of things They're forgetting the fact that in the long run Data aggregation of stuff that is out there can figure stuff out about you whether or not you have ever published it outside of a walled Yard,

1017
01:04:03,512 --> 01:04:04,178
Speaker 0: well think about this.

1018
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:08,610
Speaker 0: if you were dancing naked on a flagpole Odds are whether you go to Facebook or not.

1019
01:04:08,730 --> 01:04:12,030
Speaker 0: Someone else took a picture of you on top of the flagpole and it's on the Internet.

1020
01:04:12,131 --> 01:04:13,659
Speaker 1: Well, you say you did it in your house.

1021
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:14,544
Speaker 1: So no one was there.

1022
01:04:14,585 --> 01:04:16,605
Speaker 1: by calling your house Yeah, and you took a picture of it.

1023
01:04:17,131 --> 01:04:21,149
Speaker 1: Well, if you put that picture on the internet you effectively did the flagpole thing outside in the first place.

1024
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:25,942
Speaker 1: now Yeah, actively basically but like people want privacy like your anonymous stuff.

1025
01:04:26,263 --> 01:04:30,292
Speaker 1: anonymous breaks down in one very fundamental way Algorithmically.

1026
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:34,230
Speaker 1: you can figure out who someone is based on their style of typing pretty accurately.

1027
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:34,872
Speaker 0: Yep, mister.

1028
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:39,970
Speaker 1: or even if you can't figure out who someone is you can statistically correlate and do things like this person.

1029
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:48,266
Speaker 1: We have a ninety nine point nine percent like a likelihood that they're responsible for All of these thousand posts over the last three years and all these different social networks.

1030
01:04:48,548 --> 01:04:53,789
Speaker 1: and oh look He was posting an anonymous and he was posting on anonymously in all these different places.

1031
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:59,344
Speaker 1: But he also has a LinkedIn profile and we're pretty sure it's the same guy now.

1032
01:04:59,364 --> 01:04:59,926
Speaker 1: You're fucked now.

1033
01:04:59,966 --> 01:05:00,447
Speaker 1: It's all linked.

1034
01:05:00,849 --> 01:05:06,190
Speaker 0: Yep, and Eventually, there's like if you go and you make some let's say you have a blog right and you have two blogs.

1035
01:05:06,251 --> 01:05:11,505
Speaker 0: You have one blog for all the stuff You don't want people to know about and another blog for the stuff you do want people to know about right?

1036
01:05:11,525 --> 01:05:12,368
Speaker 0: You're clean stuff.

1037
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,241
Speaker 0: People all right, they find the bad blog.

1038
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:20,190
Speaker 0: Let's say both blogs get popular Right, or even let's say only the bad blog is popular, right?

1039
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:21,054
Speaker 0: But nobody knows.

1040
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:24,710
Speaker 0: it's you and only the people that you you know want to keep the bad blog a secret from.

1041
01:05:25,152 --> 01:05:25,977
Speaker 0: They look at the good blog.

1042
01:05:25,997 --> 01:05:28,190
Speaker 0: They don't know about the bad one or they maybe they know about the bad one.

1043
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:28,551
Speaker 0: They don't know.

1044
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:28,852
Speaker 0: it's you.

1045
01:05:29,494 --> 01:05:33,167
Speaker 0: that's two samples of data that they can use and compare and then figure out.

1046
01:05:33,187 --> 01:05:34,050
Speaker 0: it's you with science.

1047
01:05:34,491 --> 01:05:42,989
Speaker 0: So the only way to keep something private like that bad blog would be to make the bad blog and then never make any other Posts on the internet other than that.

1048
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:53,210
Speaker 1: so I feel like really there are three levels of privacy that will exist in the long run and We won't have problems anymore once people understand this, but I don't know when people will understand.

1049
01:05:53,270 --> 01:06:00,789
Speaker 1: I mean people still don't understand that it's a bad idea to take a picture of yourself Holding your illegal gun and then putting it on YouTube and be like check out my illegal gun.

1050
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:12,159
Speaker 1: Of course there was an article a while ago I think was an Oregon where some cop was basically saying that they arrest so many gang members with illegal guns and drugs Because they just posted on like YouTube and Facebook.

1051
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,628
Speaker 1: He was like, I hope they never figure it out.

1052
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:19,244
Speaker 1: nice He's like, I think I don't think they realize how easy this is right fine.

1053
01:06:19,284 --> 01:06:20,869
Speaker 0: Maybe this is why crime is way down.

1054
01:06:22,170 --> 01:06:25,795
Speaker 0: huh, maybe Prime is way down Your big time.

1055
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:27,442
Speaker 1: I think there are people who are about.

1056
01:06:27,462 --> 01:06:34,009
Speaker 0: usually you would think that even you know Even though crime has been going way down since the 90s You would think that with the recession it would have gone up but it went down.

1057
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:35,470
Speaker 1: Well, it's the thing is it's weird.

1058
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:41,650
Speaker 1: It did go up in some places But it went down in the places people traditionally expected it to go up like the cities.

1059
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:46,330
Speaker 1: I mean New York City is having like no crime like it's kind of scary how little crime there is here now.

1060
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:50,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, despite the fact that the economy kind of you know, fuck up still.

1061
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:53,375
Speaker 1: But privacy, I mean think there's.

1062
01:06:53,395 --> 01:06:55,260
Speaker 1: there's actual private like.

1063
01:06:55,682 --> 01:07:05,617
Speaker 1: I have the naked picture of myself that I don't share with anyone in a Way where they could also share it with someone else, you know That's the on my own private server Encrypted on my USB key.

1064
01:07:05,737 --> 01:07:06,399
Speaker 1: or how about?

1065
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:09,670
Speaker 0: you took a picture with a Polaroid and the Polaroid is in your house.

1066
01:07:10,871 --> 01:07:12,135
Speaker 1: All the real security like.

1067
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:16,730
Speaker 1: you don't share these things or you share them within a walled garden that you maintain

1068
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:26,510
Speaker 0: The thing is their whole websites of like, you know, like, you know ex-boyfriend, you know When we were when we were going he took a video of me, but now he posts on the internet.

1069
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:28,430
Speaker 1: Well, that's why you know, I said there are three levels.

1070
01:07:28,696 --> 01:07:29,571
Speaker 1: That's level one The.

1071
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:36,922
Speaker 1: you are the only one who has actual mathematical control over that data And you might show it to someone something that you thought and have not said.

1072
01:07:37,264 --> 01:07:45,870
Speaker 1: or you show it to someone but you don't give It to them so they can say yeah Rima has all these naked pictures of Pikachu But you don't have any evidence of this other than you said you saw it.

1073
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:47,704
Speaker 1: So now it's a matter of do they trust you or me?

1074
01:07:47,805 --> 01:07:48,390
Speaker 1: There's no evidence.

1075
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:51,247
Speaker 1: Mmm, I have a lot of naked pictures of Pikachu by the way.

1076
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:56,133
Speaker 1: Actually, I do have one that I didn't keep it But I saw it.

1077
01:07:56,153 --> 01:07:58,489
Speaker 1: remember when we went to Bay image to see what was going on there.

1078
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:01,441
Speaker 1: It was nothing but Pokemon porn and pedophilia.

1079
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:10,008
Speaker 1: Oh, it's being still around I don't even know but last time we checked it was basically 90% Pokemon porn 9% digimon porn.

1080
01:08:10,771 --> 01:08:12,538
Speaker 0: Okay, it looks like it's still around.

1081
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:14,266
Speaker 1: how much Pokemon porn is there?

1082
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:14,848
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1083
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,321
Speaker 0: Ranma is the biggest tag.

1084
01:08:17,643 --> 01:08:18,066
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1085
01:08:18,086 --> 01:08:18,790
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's porn.

1086
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:20,535
Speaker 0: No, it's actually.

1087
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,044
Speaker 0: I think it's all of Ranma the manga.

1088
01:08:22,064 --> 01:08:27,606
Speaker 1: Oh Okay, huh, I feel like torrents are a better place to do that.

1089
01:08:27,928 --> 01:08:31,184
Speaker 1: yeah But level one is I control it.

1090
01:08:31,203 --> 01:08:34,910
Speaker 1: level two is Trust and this is the in the far future.

1091
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:40,689
Speaker 1: The only thing that matters in all the technology is trust networks because you're a being an identity.

1092
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:56,970
Speaker 1: You are your knowledge and you choose which other knowledge identities you will trust with information and with links to your information and Trust networks are 100% secure Unless someone in your trust network is a fucktard and then you're done and your whole trust network is compromised.

1093
01:08:57,553 --> 01:09:00,490
Speaker 1: So you really have to decide who you trust in the world?

1094
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:05,933
Speaker 1: And if you trust them, you're pretty much gonna have to trust them all the way You know.

1095
01:09:05,973 --> 01:09:09,068
Speaker 1: level two is I trust this person and that's the walled garden of.

1096
01:09:09,089 --> 01:09:10,569
Speaker 1: you know What people try to do with Facebook?

1097
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:11,091
Speaker 1: That's the.

1098
01:09:11,594 --> 01:09:18,705
Speaker 1: I'm having a party at this place and I only tell people in the walled garden As long as you trust everyone in your walled garden and you trust the walled garden.

1099
01:09:18,926 --> 01:09:19,227
Speaker 1: You're 100% safe.

1100
01:09:20,555 --> 01:09:26,662
Speaker 1: But if you want to publish information Anywhere outside of those two levels, you've basically got to publish it to the world.

1101
01:09:26,964 --> 01:09:28,268
Speaker 1: and just no holds barred.

1102
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:34,550
Speaker 1: No holding back No going back Mmm, and I think those are the only three levels of privacy that will ever exist in the future

1103
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:36,131
Speaker 0: Possibly

1104
01:09:36,152 --> 01:09:43,548
Speaker 1: and I think the second one breaks down for the majority of people because people have this weird meta problem Where there are people who?

1105
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:52,136
Speaker 1: Expect to be in their trust network that they don't actually trust and they will either make the mistake of trusting that person in which Gave days compromised their entire trust network.

1106
01:09:52,636 --> 01:09:57,310
Speaker 1: That's equally bad to the nerd who PGP signs a key that they don't trust.

1107
01:09:58,571 --> 01:10:09,950
Speaker 1: They're fucked if they do that or they say I'm not going to trust you but now they've admitted I don't trust you yeah, and Then it'll make drama for them because they're fail.

1108
01:10:10,211 --> 01:10:12,840
Speaker 1: But in the long run you basically have to cut off the people.

1109
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:19,603
Speaker 1: if someone's gonna cause drama because you've refused to trust them You have got to cut them off because you will never have good interactions with that person.

1110
01:10:20,085 --> 01:10:25,730
Speaker 0: So I think in summary Technical, you know privacy problems on the internet really boiled down to two things.

1111
01:10:25,810 --> 01:10:30,449
Speaker 0: It's not whether Google or Facebook gives you the features necessary or anything like.

1112
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:32,274
Speaker 0: no You can't blame anything on them.

1113
01:10:32,335 --> 01:10:39,630
Speaker 0: the two things to blame are a people's technological incompetence not understanding what they're doing Which is always clearly documented.

1114
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:50,105
Speaker 0: In fact privacy is so well documented that every frickin site in the universe has a privacy policy that tells you everything and they're usually in plain non lawyer text or at least have a plain non lawyer text component.

1115
01:10:50,708 --> 01:11:02,036
Speaker 0: and to In addition to the technological and competency people just have actual social privacy trust problems that they need to resolve and that's their real privacy problem.

1116
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:15,518
Speaker 1: that really I think accounts for the majority of all the Facebook drama is just Real-live drama that suddenly came to a head because technology forces and confront the harsh reality of the fact They're able to pass the blame on to Facebook.

1117
01:11:15,538 --> 01:11:21,158
Speaker 0: somehow like Facebook's supposed to know that you just broke up with that guy or Google's supposed To know that that you know.

1118
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:27,750
Speaker 0: the person you emailed a thousand times You know and said all these good things to was actually an evil ex-boyfriend.

1119
01:11:28,573 --> 01:11:32,305
Speaker 1: Google eventually or something like Google will know because that stuff's all statistical.

1120
01:11:32,365 --> 01:11:41,766
Speaker 1: remember way back at our IT There was that cool app that would take a sample of writing of more than like 50 words and tell with pretty much like a hundred Percent accuracy whether or not it was a man or woman who wrote it.

1121
01:11:41,927 --> 01:11:43,728
Speaker 0: Yep That's the kind of stuff.

1122
01:11:44,031 --> 01:11:53,363
Speaker 1: So I mean we're gonna have algorithms eventually that can look at all your email and tell you not only who you've dated Who you're currently dating who you're cheating with who you should be dating.

1123
01:11:53,705 --> 01:11:55,190
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's the same with anything.

1124
01:11:55,210 --> 01:12:03,710
Speaker 0: we're eventually gonna be able to just look into your house and see everything with a satellite and You know, we're gonna be able to you know, wait and see what you're thinking.

1125
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:04,394
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

1126
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:06,688
Speaker 1: I feel like this is where the three levels of privacy come in.

1127
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:18,443
Speaker 1: You are responsible ultimately for your own for your own privacy And if there is something that for whatever reason either for shady reasons or legitimate reasons you want it to be private The onus is 100% on you to maintain that privacy.

1128
01:12:19,790 --> 01:12:24,605
Speaker 0: Yeah people keep thinking that there is some sort of right to privacy and I think there's a right to the.

1129
01:12:24,946 --> 01:12:29,150
Speaker 1: your right is the Right to protect your own privacy within your own legal me.

1130
01:12:29,351 --> 01:12:31,250
Speaker 0: I mean that's exactly if you look at the Constitution.

1131
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:34,890
Speaker 0: It doesn't say you have the right to the privacy that shall not be infringed upon.

1132
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:36,336
Speaker 0: It says right.

1133
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:45,890
Speaker 0: the government shall not make unwarranted searches and seizures Which pretty much means if you want something to be secret you can keep it a secret.

1134
01:12:46,432 --> 01:12:56,089
Speaker 0: And as long as the guy's a secret to everybody right as long as and the government cannot come and take the secret by force without a warrant, right and Well, we got problems with that.

1135
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:57,893
Speaker 0: So that's the.

1136
01:12:58,034 --> 01:12:58,635
Speaker 0: that's really.

1137
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:08,470
Speaker 0: the only time I'm going to be angry about privacy is if the government makes an unwarranted Search and seizure which they do and that's something to be very very concerned about right?

1138
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:12,430
Speaker 0: But as long as they're not, you know, as long as that's not happening, right?

1139
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:16,969
Speaker 0: It is possible for you to keep something a secret if you want to.

1140
01:13:16,989 --> 01:13:17,532
Speaker 1: well Here's the.

1141
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:18,074
Speaker 1: here's the other thing.

1142
01:13:18,114 --> 01:13:22,840
Speaker 0: the other because anyone else who isn't the government tries to take it by force They're breaking the law.

1143
01:13:22,961 --> 01:13:23,749
Speaker 1: I captain interrupty.

1144
01:13:24,019 --> 01:13:36,810
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm gonna interrupt you because the other big component you're completely ignoring in the body of law is all the precedent regarding a reasonable Expectation of privacy and I think that is a good body of law and it's a good standard and reasonable expectation of privacy.

1145
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,498
Speaker 0: It is good to hear their problem.

1146
01:13:38,518 --> 01:13:39,343
Speaker 1: I know where you're going with this.

1147
01:13:39,383 --> 01:13:47,646
Speaker 1: The two problems are that one Different people due to their misunderstanding of technology of different expectations of what is reasonable when it comes to privacy.

1148
01:13:47,666 --> 01:13:48,087
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1149
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:54,770
Speaker 1: and two We've got this problem where the there is technology that basically makes it to where you base.

1150
01:13:54,850 --> 01:14:00,770
Speaker 1: You can't effectively have a reasonable expectation of privacy anywhere unless we make better laws to handle that.

1151
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:02,615
Speaker 1: Mmm, I think we definitely

1152
01:14:02,635 --> 01:14:24,893
Speaker 0: think the other problem is that the people who exist now have a reasonable expectation based on You know a world in which certain things are not true and because of the advances of science technology Those basic assumptions upon which their reasonable expectation were based are no longer true And thus their reasonable expectation is no longer reasonable and the problem is still living with their old reasonable Expectation.

1153
01:14:24,913 --> 01:14:26,402
Speaker 1: the reason this comes about is pretty simple.

1154
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:27,890
Speaker 1: to explain even a non-technical people.

1155
01:14:28,271 --> 01:14:35,577
Speaker 1: It's the fact that the laws and the and all the rules we followed before are perfectly valid But they break down any time.

1156
01:14:35,617 --> 01:14:39,993
Speaker 1: you can have machines iterate and automate so, you know It's your.

1157
01:14:40,073 --> 01:14:45,733
Speaker 1: you have no expectation of privacy in the street if someone's just walking down the street and they're just video videoing you That's awesome.

1158
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:53,062
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can really do about that if you're both on public property, so That was fine in the old days because not everyone had cameras.

1159
01:14:53,082 --> 01:14:54,769
Speaker 1: not everyone's gonna be filming everything all the time.

1160
01:14:55,691 --> 01:15:01,410
Speaker 1: With computers and technology I can just put a camera on every street corner and film every street 24/7 and just make that public.

1161
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:05,970
Speaker 0: The only reason you can't do it in New York City is because you need a permit to set up a tripod.

1162
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:07,589
Speaker 1: Yep, but you can use a monopod.

1163
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:08,893
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1164
01:15:09,134 --> 01:15:11,110
Speaker 1: I've seen people using monopods to get around that.

1165
01:15:11,191 --> 01:15:14,938
Speaker 1: I don't know if that works or not But it's basically just a stick with a camera on top.

1166
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:18,329
Speaker 0: you could get someone maybe for littering or vandalizing or dumping.

1167
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:20,383
Speaker 1: Oh, no, what if the government did it?

1168
01:15:20,423 --> 01:15:21,210
Speaker 1: I still stand by.

1169
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:27,979
Speaker 1: I think the best thing we could do for like New York City right now is to have public cameras that record Everything that's going on.

1170
01:15:27,999 --> 01:15:28,969
Speaker 0: What do we need them for though?

1171
01:15:29,474 --> 01:15:29,878
Speaker 0: I mean like.

1172
01:15:29,918 --> 01:15:31,070
Speaker 0: I agree that there's nothing wrong.

1173
01:15:31,556 --> 01:15:32,730
Speaker 1: What do we need them for one?

1174
01:15:33,031 --> 01:15:37,230
Speaker 1: It'd be really cool because I could go watch myself walking down the street and figure out if I have a funny gate.

1175
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:38,743
Speaker 0: They have some cameras you can.

1176
01:15:38,804 --> 01:15:43,790
Speaker 0: on my television There's a channel I can watch that shows like three different cameras of what's going on in the city in different places.

1177
01:15:44,032 --> 01:15:46,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want more of that and I want To.

1178
01:15:46,632 --> 01:15:49,250
Speaker 1: I would use it to whenever I am wronged.

1179
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:58,090
Speaker 1: I usually I'm of the mind at least that almost every time I've had an altercation in society I was in the right and were there of everyone always thinks they were in the right.

1180
01:15:58,332 --> 01:16:00,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm pretty sure I'm in the right most of the time.

1181
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:07,529
Speaker 1: So imagine if we had the camera and I could just go back and be like, okay So fat and ignorant woman you're claiming that I bumped into you.

1182
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:13,589
Speaker 1: Well, let's roll the tape and you see the fat and ignorant woman like backing up without a beeper and then slamming into me.

1183
01:16:15,027 --> 01:16:17,053
Speaker 1: You know Or like?

1184
01:16:17,093 --> 01:16:27,989
Speaker 1: recently there was a big news story in New York, you know during the blizzard One whole street in Manhattan I think it was a Manhattan like every car on it got totally smashed in the side like it looks like a plow just went down the street just

1185
01:16:29,413 --> 01:16:30,138
Speaker 0: Probably what happened

1186
01:16:30,843 --> 01:16:31,588
Speaker 1: and the city is like.

1187
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:38,656
Speaker 1: well There's nothing we can do about it because you can't prove it was a city plow and there's a million private plows that drive by And it might have just been some drunk guy.

1188
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:41,310
Speaker 1: Oh, it's true and there's no camera.

1189
01:16:41,511 --> 01:16:46,567
Speaker 1: So all these people were wronged and there's no way in the world to figure out what happened.

1190
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:47,290
Speaker 0: They have insurance.

1191
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:48,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that sucks.

1192
01:16:49,165 --> 01:16:49,729
Speaker 0: It does suck.

1193
01:16:56,002 --> 01:16:58,540
