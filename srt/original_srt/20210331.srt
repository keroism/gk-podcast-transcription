00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:31,649
Speaker 1: They told us in advance we'd be eligible on Tuesday.

7
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,859
Speaker 1: start right so we couldn't make appointments till Tuesday.

8
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:39,955
Speaker 0: If I can make an appointment like Monday night of course I couldn't.

9
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:47,799
Speaker 0: and then okay at 759 59 on Tuesday every site that I was using at least updated and immediately started working.

10
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:52,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean on the one hand as expected there weren't any appointments available.

11
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:59,165
Speaker 0: really unless you went far away right from where we are I did end up deciding to go to Staten Island So I didn't know.

12
00:00:59,185 --> 00:00:59,868
Speaker 1: good luck with that.

13
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I decided to just be patient.

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,560
Speaker 1: I'm just like oh, I'll just wait until you know why I'm not gonna sit here reloading all day wasting my time.

15
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:08,020
Speaker 1: I only got one life to live.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,812
Speaker 1: I'll just wait until I can get one easily with just like a click.

17
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:11,897
Speaker 1: You know there's just plenty.

18
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:12,480
Speaker 1: yeah pick one.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,565
Speaker 1: I'll wait until that time.

20
00:01:14,168 --> 00:01:16,178
Speaker 1: you know that time would come right.

21
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:25,992
Speaker 1: so I was only checking like you know once twice a day like wake up check it right go to check it Go to bed right see if they're just in case.

22
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:31,688
Speaker 1: you know most of the day You know I looked at I think once in the middle of the day, and it was like nope nothing no Early

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,819
Speaker 0: on I checked a lot But it was clear that it wasn't gonna happen like one would appear and it like wasn't worth it.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,070
Speaker 0: So I basically what I just.

25
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:43,440
Speaker 1: I do want to congratulate Whoever's running a lot of these sites such as turbo vax the official, New York City site all these sites.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,505
Speaker 1: There were some problems.

27
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:54,660
Speaker 1: for example at one point the official, New York City dot-gov site Said like city field available you click on it you fill out the form and then when you finish the form It's like actually just kidding low.

28
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:56,766
Speaker 0: Yeah So I did learn something about that.

29
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:07,427
Speaker 0: the reason that was happening is that if a lot of people once you fill out That form once if you change like if you go back or click on a different link from turbo vax It makes you fill the form out again and again.

30
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you can.

31
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:09,114
Speaker 1: I think on.

32
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:12,184
Speaker 1: the people are saying this tricks to Real simple.

33
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:15,280
Speaker 0: if you just stay on the page and just change the date or the zip code.

34
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,409
Speaker 0: It'll just immediately refresh and keep everything regardless.

35
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,074
Speaker 1: the point is is that there.

36
00:02:20,635 --> 00:02:23,308
Speaker 1: I want to say of course There's no appointments right.

37
00:02:23,328 --> 00:02:24,517
Speaker 1: There's just supply and demand.

38
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:31,574
Speaker 0: well Comment a Millions and millions of quote very online people.

39
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:33,700
Speaker 0: suddenly we're trying to get access right.

40
00:02:34,182 --> 00:02:42,070
Speaker 1: But all of these websites that I tried the various ones that were out there They were all fast and up right.

41
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:55,589
Speaker 1: so take a lesson people such as Blizzard right Going down when you get when you get crushed inventions where the artist alley application crashes slack slack on January 4th right.

42
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,278
Speaker 1: take notice.

43
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,119
Speaker 1: You know something.

44
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:05,320
Speaker 0: Wedges went on sale and literally every adult in New York City was trying to get them at the same time.

45
00:03:06,181 --> 00:03:06,823
Speaker 1: Right exactly.

46
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:11,860
Speaker 1: so good job keeping the the site up even though of course the inventory was down, right?

47
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:13,808
Speaker 0: It's like they're like people are.

48
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:16,440
Speaker 0: if you're if you're patient and persistent you're gonna get one soon.

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,640
Speaker 1: It looks like yeah, so what happened to me was you know my doctor long ago, right is you know it's NYU doctor, right?

50
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,740
Speaker 1: They have all kinds of apps and stuff.

Speaker 1: They're very you know modern right and they they just send a message to all the patients.

52
00:03:29,061 --> 00:03:32,158
Speaker 1: And it was just like hey stop calling us right we got shit to do.

Speaker 1: I know you'll know Right.

58
00:03:39,783 --> 00:03:45,020
Speaker 1: they were testing the vaccines themselves to see which ones they liked better and doing all kinds of all kinds of stuff.

59
00:03:45,702 --> 00:03:45,963

Speaker 1: I never communicated with them.

66
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,943
Speaker 1: once I'm just in the system as a patient and they said here's the link and it was a link to go to in my doctor's Official app.

Speaker 0: It's exciting that it's all working and we're getting shots and arms pretty quick which leads us You know it's a Wednesday animation day to a very relevant news that bridges what we just talked about and what?

82
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:36,280
Speaker 0: So there is an anime convention.

83
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:44,338

00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:51,590
Speaker 1: I told Telling Amanda this and I was like there's an anime conventions gonna happen, and she's like oh no But I'm like it's worse than that.

85
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:56,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, so It's oh, it's worse worse than that sack.

86
00:05:56,534 --> 00:06:00,206
Speaker 0: It's extreme worse Sacramento, but sack anime.

87
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,610
Speaker 0: I dug into it a little more.

88
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:07,209
Speaker 0: this con is a history of doing bad shit like they invite That other cons won't invite like whatever.

89
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:07,791
Speaker 1: I didn't.

90
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,514

Speaker 1: Oh sack anime There.

00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:15,620
Speaker 0: I only denounced two things in the world Scott in any civilization game and sack anime.

93
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:21,530
Speaker 0: So here's how egregious this is why opposite of endorse denounce.

94
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:27,165
Speaker 0: so sack anime is happening this weekend Like crap.

95
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:29,030
Speaker 0: April 1st and seconds.

96
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:30,936
Speaker 1: have you looked at a kovat graph?

97
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,360
Speaker 1: It's going up people way up.

98
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:41,673
Speaker 0: This ain't like New York City, this is a place where it's upper upper up yep - it is happening at the convention center.

99
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:49,440
Speaker 0: that was Giving vaccines out and the vaccines are all gonna be paused so the fucking anime con can happen.

100
00:06:50,526 --> 00:07:00,740
Speaker 0: uh-huh Three this anime con Should not be allowed to happen because per the rules of the region the place It's in you can't have conventions in the convention center.

101
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,853
Speaker 0: But you know what you're allowed to have in the convention center.

102
00:07:03,296 --> 00:07:04,944
Speaker 1: swap meets There's all they have.

103
00:07:04,964 --> 00:07:08,436
Speaker 1: there's a rule that you can have swap meets at half capacity right.

104
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:16,569
Speaker 0: so they're having classified their convention as a swap meet yep, and Multiple people reply because I tweeted about this.

105
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:18,516
Speaker 0: then I had to mute it because it got read like did.

106
00:07:18,536 --> 00:07:22,932
Speaker 0: this thread is like still Going on Twitter because people are mad about it as they should be.

107
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:24,979
Speaker 0: but it's even worse than that.

108
00:07:25,741 --> 00:07:30,803
Speaker 0: Apparently according to numerous sources this con was planned during Covid like.

109
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:31,627
Speaker 0: this was not like.

110
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:34,460
Speaker 0: they planned this five years ago, and they had to do something.

111
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:38,739
Speaker 0: It was planned during kovat and they classified as a swap meet on purpose to make sure it happens.

112
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,237
Speaker 1: Yeah, so never go to this con.

113
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,452
Speaker 0: Yes Evil people this is not.

114
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:51,660
Speaker 0: not that it's excusable But it is not the case of a con was forced to run or go bankrupt.

115
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:56,906
Speaker 0: It was a case of this con actively tried to run During a pandemic.

116
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:58,412
Speaker 1: for all that we can tell.

117
00:07:58,472 --> 00:07:59,074
Speaker 1: that is true.

118
00:07:59,154 --> 00:08:09,415
Speaker 1: right there may it may not be true But as far as the information available to us reported by reputable real news websites That at least appear to be real news websites that appears to be the case.

119
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:30,953
Speaker 1: therefore that means In summary anyone who is running sack anime the staff the board of that con whoever it's organized owner president Whatever right those are people who think it is okay to literally risk human lives Just to have an anime con and get together and cosplay for a weekend.

120
00:08:30,973 --> 00:08:31,575
Speaker 1: right.

121
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:42,777
Speaker 1: they would literally not Exaggerating like take a person who is alive and just murder them Right in order to have a convention, and then a person is dead.

122
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:43,558
Speaker 1: They're okay with that.

123
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:48,733
Speaker 1: I mean even one person would be too many and they're potentially risking many people.

124
00:08:49,315 --> 00:08:53,484
Speaker 1: yep, so they're just evil bad people And fuck their con.

125
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:54,688
Speaker 0: yeah, we've said this before.

126
00:08:54,748 --> 00:09:05,240
Speaker 0: but even if a con was you know forced to run like one of those situations We've talked about The whole purpose of making an LLC is to limit your liability.

127
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,782
Speaker 0: It's right there.

128
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:07,928
Speaker 0: in the name limited liability company.

129
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:15,873
Speaker 0: if your choices run your con or your LLC goes bankrupt You're morally obligated to let your LLC go bankrupt.

130
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:22,215
Speaker 0: because guess what you can just make a new LLC and get the same staff and just start your fucking con again like in a couple years.

131
00:09:22,316 --> 00:09:23,560
Speaker 0: like it'll be fine.

132
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:33,594
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, so yeah fuck everyone involved in the management and planning of sack anime And also do not go to sack anime.

133
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:37,020
Speaker 0: You don't say Who is even going?

134
00:09:37,822 --> 00:09:47,079
Speaker 1: Like that like people who properly believe the same thing as the people who run the con believe Which is that it is okay to risk human lives just to be.

135
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:52,080
Speaker 0: That was like you're gonna be mad and he sends this link and I click on the link and I was mad.

136
00:09:52,582 --> 00:09:54,190
Speaker 0: But as I read the rest of the article.

137
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,979
Speaker 0: I just got more mad and madder.

138
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,760
Speaker 0: It was Homer mad in bed face by the time I got to the bottom.

139
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,880
Speaker 1: Yep, so there you go.

140
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,355
Speaker 1: Waste any more breath on such trash people.

141
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:13,059
Speaker 0: Yep in some other news that is Complex and behind the scenes, but it's like it'll be interesting to see the real like what's going on here.

142
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:20,500
Speaker 0: Bandai Namco actually announced recently like this month a big re-shuffling of all their subsidiaries.

143
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,100
Speaker 0: Because remember you think oh Bandai Bandai is a holding company and there are a lot of like subsidiary companies under that.

144
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,043
Speaker 0: That's how a lot of.

145
00:10:28,084 --> 00:10:30,171
Speaker 1: yeah, you got sure you got Dragon Balls.

146
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:31,135
Speaker 1: Yeah getting poke a nap.

147
00:10:31,155 --> 00:10:37,552
Speaker 1: Oh, come on There's a lock it there's a lot there Pac Man's there's a lot of stuff.

148
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:47,126
Speaker 0: so they have rejiggered a lot of that together and consolidated and there's I don't I there.

149
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:57,388
Speaker 0: we might be able to infer some things about the state of That industry like that fandom industry based on this because the reason they gave They're mostly focusing on the u.s.

150
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:10,740
Speaker 0: France and China like subsidiaries in those three places in light of Re-evaluating the direction of the company's plan in light of expected changes in quote customers lifestyles and sense of value.

151
00:11:11,865 --> 00:11:18,840
Speaker 0: Like there's a something Predicately caused them to make these changes, but they're basically merging everything into three units.

152
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,758
Speaker 0: They're gonna have one unit that is entertainment, which is basically like toys and hobbies and network and all that stuff.

153
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,796
Speaker 0: one That's like IP production which is merging other visual like like TV stuff and their music stuff together and they're like IP units.

154
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:39,986
Speaker 0: and then a third unit the Amusement unit which I'm pretty sure is just the gaming stuff Mmm, and that's all we know.

155
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:43,540
Speaker 0: that is anime news it that doesn't sound super exciting.

156
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:49,420
Speaker 1: I'd probably go check out see what the gunpla communities are saying right because you know Bandai makes all the gunplas

157
00:11:49,640 --> 00:12:01,392
Speaker 0: Yep, the day that like where a fan will care is either this consolidation might also come along with some Business line that that fan cares about not being prioritized or being shut down.

158
00:12:01,732 --> 00:12:04,560
Speaker 0: that often happens in mergers or new ones appearing.

159
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:05,805
Speaker 0: Yep, new ones appear.

160
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,652
Speaker 0: one could be revitalized.

161
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,700
Speaker 0: That's been dead as part of a like a play.

162
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:15,160
Speaker 1: There's a lot you think things might become accessible or inaccessible in different places in the world.

163
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:27,440
Speaker 0: There might be more cross work like the visual and music production units and the IP units might like do stuff That was difficult to do before because they want to cross things that were previously managed by two separate subsidiaries.

164
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:28,641
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:12:28,902 --> 00:12:30,447
Speaker 1: All we all we can say for sure.

166
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,799
Speaker 1: Is that something I know it's so we know it's like Oh Tekken.

167
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:47,240
Speaker 1: We know so little right is basically Something related to some of the stuff that Bandai does in some way will likely change in the nearish future.

168
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,868
Speaker 1: Yep, that's it.

169
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:52,164
Speaker 1: That's how little we know but it's still What it.

170
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,463
Speaker 1: the news is not that the thing has changed yet So you can't write.

171
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,274
Speaker 1: the news is keep an eyeball in that direction.

172
00:12:58,334 --> 00:12:58,876
Speaker 1: Wait for it.

173
00:12:58,997 --> 00:12:59,579
Speaker 1: That's the news.

174
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:03,407
Speaker 0: So I'll talk about penguin drum.

175
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:04,670
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

176
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a tiny news, right?

177
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:13,265
Speaker 0: So ten years ago God damn I still haven't even watched it Ikuhara the Utena guy.

178
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:23,420
Speaker 1: right, you know, everyone knows Kuniko Ikuhara in this anime creator Created this TV anime called penguin drum that we didn't watch right?

179
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:34,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure you know the the bear one was good right and people said I watched a few episodes of the the newer one The couple one that was also for good.

180
00:13:36,423 --> 00:13:38,639
Speaker 1: What little I watched that the couple one was good anyway.

181
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:49,960
Speaker 1: But yeah penguin drum For a show that's ten years old that you thought was like a show that you know Like most anime happens ends and then fades from consciousness.

182
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:56,258
Speaker 1: They are coming out with a compilation movie of penguin drum ten years after its original release.

183
00:13:56,298 --> 00:14:06,336
Speaker 1: for some reason I guess there must be some value or money behind it or something That's interesting and cool in case maybe that might become.

184
00:14:06,356 --> 00:14:13,840
Speaker 1: you know Usually I'm not huge on compilation movies, you know, even people who say like, you know, those original Gundam compilation movies.

185
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,406
Speaker 1: I watched the three movies instead of watching the original Gundam series, which can drag a bit I personally.

186
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,914
Speaker 1: we just watch the original Gundam series.

187
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:21,939
Speaker 1: I got time for that, right?

188
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I say that neither one of us watched penguin drum.

189
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,823
Speaker 1: That's true So it's.

190
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:32,980
Speaker 1: but the point is as someone who I think that's why there might be some appeal in the compilation movie.

191
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,200
Speaker 1: It's like oh, well, I didn't watch it, but it's like watch this compilation movie.

192
00:14:37,381 --> 00:14:41,200
Speaker 1: Oh, well, if I had watched it, I'd probably be like man who needs a compilation movie.

193
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never in my life seen something.

194
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,259
Speaker 0: and then later when a compilation movie came out said hot.

195
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,833
Speaker 0: Damn I really got to get on top of that

196
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:53,159
Speaker 1: Exactly, but when you haven't seen it and you know, you're not, you know

197
00:14:55,101 --> 00:15:00,399
Speaker 0: There's gonna be a ghost in the shell movie and I get real pumped and then I find out it's a compilation movie and my Interest drops back to zero.

198
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:02,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like oh maybe I'll what.

199
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:06,660
Speaker 1: maybe you'll be worth watching the compilation movie penguin drum instead of watching the real thing.

200
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,760
Speaker 1: Who knows it's coming.

201
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:14,200
Speaker 1: And that's I think the most fascinating thing is not that the compilation movie will be good bad worth watching or not?

202
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,082
Speaker 1: It's that penguin drum as a franchise and a property isn't dead, you know It's still.

203
00:15:19,342 --> 00:15:22,750
Speaker 0: if they I if they made a new tenor compilation movie.

204
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,379
Speaker 0: I would actually be how could you just could you?

205
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,153
Speaker 1: You might have to make three like the Gundam ones.

206
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, that might work.

207
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:37,806
Speaker 0: antenna one dot one one one dot one All right, so his isn't is?

208
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:41,084
Speaker 1: today is a Trans visibility day.

209
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:41,947
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so let's.

210
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:44,997
Speaker 1: so let's check this news right very relevant news.

211
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:55,380
Speaker 1: So when it comes to wiki's write this Wikipedia, everyone knows Wikipedia and The thing with Wikipedia is that they will cover a wide variety of topics.

212
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:11,249
Speaker 1: But Wikipedia refuses to go super in-depth on narrow topics right even You know because there are some things in the world that there is just so much information on right like, you know Pokemon, let's say right, but you don't have.

213
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,540
Speaker 1: they don't put all the Pokemon info on Wikipedia, right?

214
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,347
Speaker 1: Just like you don't put everything there is to know about Turtles in the encyclopedia Britannica.

215
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:20,370
Speaker 1: Does that even still exist?

216
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,731
Speaker 1: I don't know.

217
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:27,407
Speaker 0: Well with this it's especially things that are Fictional Especially yes, like there are.

218
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:33,460
Speaker 1: that's why we asked for like every kind of boat, but that's a very yes But they don't go into, you know, super detail, right?

219
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,839
Speaker 1: So that's why we have things like Bulbapedia to give you all the Pokemon information.

220
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:41,248
Speaker 1: Yeah And there's a website fandom.

221
00:16:41,549 --> 00:16:42,191
Speaker 1: Is it just fandom?

222
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,577
Speaker 1: calm but it's.

223
00:16:43,797 --> 00:16:58,380
Speaker 1: they run Wikis about all the you know for all the different major fandoms including the famously pun named Wikipedia which has all the Star Wars information about literally everything Star Wars ever right is catalogued on the Wikipedia.

224
00:16:58,982 --> 00:17:03,640
Speaker 1: Because obviously that is so much information that Wikipedia doesn't need to be hosting.

225
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,955
Speaker 1: And what happened is they had a policy.

226
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:10,805
Speaker 1: is that the trans Related part right?

227
00:17:10,825 --> 00:17:23,319
Speaker 1: They had policies on there that were like look, you know, someone may have you know transgendered right and have a new name and You know regardless of how you feel about that, right?

228
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:23,982
Speaker 1: They want.

229
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:29,000
Speaker 1: their policy was to use the names of people that were in the credits of the thing.

230
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:45,580
Speaker 1: so if there was a comic book a Star Wars comic book and they were making a page about it and The writer was a transgender person and their name at the time of writing the book was different from their name Now they were gonna use the the dead name, right which is bad for a lot of reasons

231
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,550
Speaker 0: And even worse they choose to die on this hill for a while.

232
00:17:49,671 --> 00:18:04,835
Speaker 1: yes, but has the very very tiny Somewhat barely understandable reason of like, you know Someone might look up the person because they have the comic right and if they didn't have the dead name up there You wouldn't find the person.

233
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:14,168
Speaker 0: well Meanwhile, we could Wikipedia or IMDB actually has a handles that very well and that they will have a page for each person And it has their real like.

234
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:26,060
Speaker 0: whatever name they go by is the name there That is their real name only ever appear in a separate class of for a specific film Credited as X for data integrity purposes, right?

235
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:32,340
Speaker 1: I mean and the way you know to give a good example right is like, you know, someone like sting, right?

236
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:36,344
Speaker 1: I bet if I go to IMDB I haven't done this so I'm just guessing.

237
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:40,162
Speaker 1: but I'm willing to bet if you go to IMDB and look for sting is It?

238
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,331
Speaker 1: the name is gonna be sting and is like his real name?

239
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:46,198
Speaker 1: right quote real legal name, you know, was it?

240
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:46,700
Speaker 1: is it like?

241
00:18:47,621 --> 00:18:48,465
Speaker 1: What is it forget?

242
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:55,286
Speaker 1: It's something really like sounds dorky like har, you know Looking it up right now.

243
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,552
Speaker 1: It's gordon.

244
00:18:56,572 --> 00:18:57,215
Speaker 1: I think it's gory.

245
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:59,843
Speaker 0: Go Steve go Steve Borden Steve Borden.

246
00:18:59,903 --> 00:19:01,168
Speaker 0: Okay, so he orton it was.

247
00:19:01,228 --> 00:19:02,031
Speaker 0: oh he is listed.

248
00:19:02,312 --> 00:19:03,175
Speaker 0: Oh, no, that's a wrestler.

249
00:19:03,195 --> 00:19:03,536
Speaker 0: Never mind.

250
00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:16,420
Speaker 1: Okay The point is right is like Gordon's by staying Matthew some nerd it was going is listed as Sting in IMDB and exactly but it lists for each thing.

251
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,020
Speaker 0: He's in what he's credited as there but the name that is his name associated with his like page is just staying.

252
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,884
Speaker 1: Exactly, right.

253
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:28,817
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure that Gordon whatever is his legal name, right?

254
00:19:28,937 --> 00:19:29,700
Speaker 0: Well, they do it better.

255
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:32,902
Speaker 0: They also said like they point out they don't even say it's his legal neighbor Whatever.

256
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:35,099
Speaker 0: they just say he was born with that name.

257
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:36,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

258
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:37,349
Speaker 1: Sure good.

259
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,891
Speaker 1: That's fine.

260
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:43,452
Speaker 0: There's a lot of nuance how to handle these situations But Wikipedia was taking a right arbitrary hard line.

261
00:19:43,773 --> 00:19:45,700
Speaker 0: That was harmful for no good reason, right?

262
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,362
Speaker 1: So here's the.

263
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:47,545
Speaker 1: here's the the why.

264
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:52,980
Speaker 1: Wikipedia itself was bad, but the end result of the whole situation ended up good.

265
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Speaker 1: So what Wikipedia was doing is they were putting it up for a vote using their existing processes, right?

266
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:12,120
Speaker 0: Seen in Shattered Earth trilogy where someone puts up a vote similar to this and someone can't Yeah Blows it up and says you don't get to vote on who counts as people.

267
00:20:12,742 --> 00:20:14,466
Speaker 1: That's right trans rights or human rights.

268
00:20:14,507 --> 00:20:16,753
Speaker 1: You can't have votes on human rights, right?

269
00:20:16,813 --> 00:20:18,498
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it is it.

270
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:25,600
Speaker 1: as a Jew There's one Jew right in a room and it's like alright, let's have a vote and should we kill the Jews?

271
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:26,141
Speaker 1: It's like.

272
00:20:26,162 --> 00:20:28,047
Speaker 1: that's not how it works right.

273
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:32,020
Speaker 0: you vote on things like should taxes be four point one percent or four point three percent?

274
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,084
Speaker 1: Exactly, right.

275
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,760
Speaker 1: So this is why you know in democracy you took my majority rules minority, right?

276
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,111
Speaker 1: See we vote on things but anything that is the right of minorities.

277
00:20:42,131 --> 00:20:43,114
Speaker 1: You can't vote on that.

278
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,598
Speaker 1: It just is right.

279
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,180
Speaker 1: deal with it.

280
00:20:45,650 --> 00:21:03,819
Speaker 1: so Fandom, you know the Wikipedia was going about things all the wrong way voting on human rights, which they shouldn't be doing and Luckily I don't know if all just luckily but goodly Fandom the Overarching, you know service that runs and hosts all these wikis.

281
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,260
Speaker 1: They're the technology platform that all the wikis on fandom are governed individually.

282
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:18,660
Speaker 1: But fandom itself, you know runs the servers so they have a terms of service for any wookie for a wookie For any of the wikis that they host right?

283
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:26,618
Speaker 1: And so the even though the wikis might vote on their own internal, you know governance issues they're still beholden to fandom itself.

284
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:36,960
Speaker 1: and Fandom came through and was like look You can't vote on this Because you know having all these dead names is violating our terms of service.

285
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, right of not respect to human rights.

286
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,620
Speaker 1: So shove it Wikipedia, right?

287
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,069
Speaker 1: Your your voting is over right.

288
00:21:44,712 --> 00:21:46,480
Speaker 1: get those dead names out of here, right?

289
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:54,100
Speaker 1: And that also applies to all the other wikis hosted by fandom, which is a very good news.

290
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:55,125
Speaker 1: you can read.

291
00:21:55,165 --> 00:22:07,491
Speaker 1: this gizmodo article gives you a Hundred percent of the details on this story if you really want all the details and all the history because there is a lot of history going down Here with Wikipedia and such.

292
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:16,746
Speaker 1: all the details have been Thoroughly documented by journalists and so you don't need to hear them from my mouth Because I didn't read all of them.

293
00:22:16,806 --> 00:22:18,492
Speaker 1: I just read enough to tell you the news.

294
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:19,456
Speaker 0: Yep.

295
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:20,882
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah I am.

296
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,255
Speaker 0: DB has another interesting policy.

297
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:22,679
Speaker 0: That's good.

298
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:30,874
Speaker 0: Even if you like if you're if you have if your birth name is not credited anywhere They will not like.

299
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:35,092
Speaker 0: if you want it gone They will remove it because there's no relevance to their database to that.

300
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:36,216
Speaker 1: I agree.

301
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,280
Speaker 1: That's also a good policy.

302
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seemed to have a pretty good policy here.

303
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:47,560
Speaker 0: now that I'm digging through it Mmm, so in some other news before we get to our main bit this is relevant.

304
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,650
Speaker 0: It's not really news but it's a recent article and I don't want to go too in-depth on it because we're gonna probably spend a lot of time talking about The Simpsons.

305
00:22:54,056 --> 00:22:56,525
Speaker 0: but You can guess why I bring this up.

306
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:05,840
Speaker 0: This is an article on CBR about why king of the hill Which was very popular at the time of his cancellation was canceled.

307
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:16,600
Speaker 0: It's not a bunch of huge new insights Like this is not a lot of new information But it talks a lot about why a popular Fox show might be canceled while executive changes at the network.

308
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,945
Speaker 1: That's usually what the story is.

309
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:19,311
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's also like.

310
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:20,918
Speaker 1: that's what killed Disney Afternoon.

311
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:31,400
Speaker 0: We learned that Yeah, but sometimes it's also things around like the creative staff either out of ideas or like geek nights Yeah, yeah, or maybe like they think the show like did what it needed to do.

312
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,685
Speaker 0: They want to move on to something else.

313
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,834
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons for this kind of thing.

314
00:23:35,296 --> 00:23:40,053
Speaker 0: Fox has never Officially given a reason for this one so we can only speculate.

315
00:23:40,113 --> 00:23:40,634
Speaker 0: but the art do?

316
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:44,765
Speaker 1: they give reasons regularly or Sometimes no obligation.

317
00:23:44,785 --> 00:23:49,660
Speaker 0: sometimes shows get canceled and an explicit official reason is given like ratings were expectations.

318
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,529
Speaker 0: Sometimes no reason is given.

319
00:23:51,971 --> 00:24:00,599
Speaker 0: the only thing we know for sure Objectively is that the time slot that king of the hill was in was taken over by the Cleveland Show.

320
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:07,140
Speaker 0: Okay But It's very interesting that the Simpsons is still going.

321
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:13,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know all I have to say about king of the hill is like I didn't really watch it.

322
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,920
Speaker 1: It was one of those shows that I would always see starting or ending before or after other shows and then change the channel away.

323
00:24:19,482 --> 00:24:21,529
Speaker 1: But in more recent years, right?

324
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:24,279
Speaker 1: I have I know people who are appreciators of it.

325
00:24:26,123 --> 00:24:30,460
Speaker 0: It is like really low-key funny shows, but I didn't watch it.

326
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,134
Speaker 1: So I don't have an opinion of like whether I didn't like it or dislike it.

327
00:24:34,174 --> 00:24:35,017
Speaker 1: I just didn't watch it.

328
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:46,980
Speaker 1: So But seeing other people's appreciation of it adjacent to me right and people like spreading memes from it I'm like my now current thought on it is like, huh?

329
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,072
Speaker 1: There was probably something good there that I didn't see cuz I didn't watch it.

330
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:50,293
Speaker 1: Yep.

331
00:24:50,896 --> 00:24:51,860
Speaker 1: That's my feeling on that.

332
00:24:53,221 --> 00:24:54,085
Speaker 0: Watch all of it.

333
00:24:54,728 --> 00:24:55,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not gonna go.

334
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:56,215
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do that.

335
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,400
Speaker 1: But that's what my talk.

336
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:04,423
Speaker 0: Hill Set later, but same care queen of the queen of the valley Like.

337
00:25:04,464 --> 00:25:06,219
Speaker 0: I think all the characters will be 15 years older.

338
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:07,943
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever.

339
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:09,710
Speaker 0: I don't know we'll see but I was.

340
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,413
Speaker 0: oh I was a big like.

341
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:14,320
Speaker 0: our family was a big fan of Mike judge Like even from the early Beavis and butthead days.

342
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:24,218
Speaker 0: So when a king of the hill was announced we were all on board and honestly king of the hill is one of the funnier like American prime time cartoons there ever was.

343
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:30,599
Speaker 0: Hmm it's no first ten seasons of Simpsons, but it's definitely a solid show.

344
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:35,149
Speaker 0: You wanna talk about Keanu Reeves ultra-violent comic.

345
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:35,691
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

346
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:35,972
Speaker 1: I forgot.

347
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:45,180
Speaker 1: So this is sort of a geek bite and sort of a news right, so There was a comic book listed in the comic book order form called berserker with some vowels removed.

348
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,665
Speaker 0: It will not hit you like a truck.

349
00:25:46,705 --> 00:25:51,300
Speaker 1: However, yes, people are making all sorts of berserker jokes, right?

350
00:25:52,424 --> 00:26:02,018
Speaker 1: But I it caught my eye Because on the the credits right in the cover were two names that I recognized Matt Kintz, right?

351
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:09,740
Speaker 1: Which you know is a great comic writers written things like MCND, right and the spy spy thing.

352
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,283
Speaker 1: What was it called?

353
00:26:10,545 --> 00:26:12,839
Speaker 1: I have it on the shelf and it's not turning around to look at it.

354
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:25,374
Speaker 1: anyway, I like the comics I've read that have been written by Matt Kint and Keanu Reeves the famous person that you even I know who that is bench sitting guy, right.

355
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,960
Speaker 1: So you see Keanu Reeves name on a front of a comic book.

356
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,766
Speaker 1: It's like did he actually write this comic book?

357
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:39,784
Speaker 1: and on the cover of the comic book is an illustration of Keanu Reeves You know wearing guns and shit like.

358
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:43,030
Speaker 1: he's ready for the typical movie that he's typecast to play in.

359
00:26:44,932 --> 00:26:49,490
Speaker 1: Okay, so I go and I'm like, well, I guess I'm ordering that comic book.

360
00:26:50,093 --> 00:26:51,781
Speaker 1: I'm like, give me send me volume one.

361
00:26:51,801 --> 00:26:52,445
Speaker 1: I want to.

362
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:53,530
Speaker 1: I want to read it, right?

363
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,909
Speaker 1: I'll see what the hell's in it if he actually wrote it.

364
00:26:57,132 --> 00:27:02,230
Speaker 1: And I read volume one not volume one, you know the first floppy issue, right?

365
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:23,697
Speaker 1: And in that book it was Keanu Reeves is is basically this immortal dude Who can't die sort of Wolverine esque, you know he gets gets really beat up and shot and and destroyed and they he goes back to this lab and they can sort of fix him and He's out doing wars and stuff.

366
00:27:23,857 --> 00:27:30,823
Speaker 1: But also he's like a zillion years old right like caveman old and that's sort of the plot.

367
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:44,303
Speaker 1: and Not long after I get this first, you know issue and read it and see what the deal is There's announced like yeah, they're making like, you know animation of it and every.

368
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,735
Speaker 1: it's like the license it right and I'm like Already.

369
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:49,610
Speaker 1: the first issue just came out, right?

370
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:56,329
Speaker 1: so sometimes we see things where a comic is like 10 years old before it gets adapted like invincible.

371
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:58,594
Speaker 1: and Sometimes we see things.

372
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,980
Speaker 1: It's like yeah one floppy comic comes out.

373
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,983
Speaker 1: They're like up licensed.

374
00:28:02,244 --> 00:28:03,126
Speaker 1: Yeah adaptations.

375
00:28:03,206 --> 00:28:03,647
Speaker 1: They're coming.

376
00:28:03,668 --> 00:28:04,389
Speaker 1: Let's go comics.

377
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:13,750
Speaker 0: A lot of geek nights comics have become one of the biggest like Floats to see if something can be turned into an animation or a movie.

378
00:28:13,951 --> 00:28:17,410
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's been true for like 15 to 20 years already.

379
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,749
Speaker 0: Yes, that's why we bring it up a lot on geek nights.

380
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:20,916
Speaker 1: But I'm saying is like.

381
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:23,530
Speaker 1: that's why I still read comics and don't watch a lot of TV.

382
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,874
Speaker 1: Just get the original biz.

383
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:29,809
Speaker 1: why you know something so strong that is inspiring someone to invest money in it, right?

384
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:39,445
Speaker 1: Whether that thing they the adaptation they want to make happens or not a mouse guard The original thing must have some incredible strength.

385
00:28:39,485 --> 00:28:40,410
Speaker 1: that's worth checking out.

386
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:44,189
Speaker 1: Just constantly read comics and you won't need to bother with the other stuff.

387
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:55,209
Speaker 1: but yeah, if you are a fan of the Works of Keanu Reeves in which he has typecast as action, dude such as John wicks matrix, etc.

388
00:28:56,154 --> 00:28:58,709
Speaker 1: You will probably enjoy this because that's what the fuck it is.

389
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:01,781
Speaker 1: And if you're not then you're not.

390
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:02,466
Speaker 1: so ignore it.

391
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:02,889
Speaker 1: Yeah.

392
00:29:04,272 --> 00:29:08,969
Speaker 0: And last before we get into things the day and everything I know I've mentioned this every every other Wednesday or so.

393
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:12,610
Speaker 0: But great pretender all I'm gonna say is now that I've seen everything but the last arc.

394
00:29:13,611 --> 00:29:15,078
Speaker 0: People are sleeping on this show.

395
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:16,686
Speaker 0: I cannot understand.

396
00:29:16,746 --> 00:29:17,570
Speaker 1: I was gonna watch it.

397
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,610
Speaker 1: We would have done a show in it today had I watched it.

398
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:19,952
Speaker 0: I just.

399
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,080
Speaker 0: and why more anime?

400
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,430
Speaker 0: people are not talking about this show?

401
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,200
Speaker 0: This is not a cowboy bebop like how we bebop is an s-rank show But right now having seen all but the last arc.

402
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:37,009
Speaker 0: this is an a-minus show and Depending on how the last arc goes which appears to be like now, you know all these characters.

403
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,115
Speaker 0: now It's gonna get like more serious.

404
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,920
Speaker 0: Like here's the here's the real meat.

405
00:29:41,361 --> 00:29:44,912
Speaker 0: like here's the story like how kobe bebop did to a degree This.

406
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:47,329
Speaker 0: this could easily be an a anime in the end.

407
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:52,577
Speaker 0: hmm Me so many times and but it's just.

408
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:56,690
Speaker 0: it's so weird that I see almost no one talking about the show.

409
00:29:57,771 --> 00:29:59,416
Speaker 1: Well, I just just a very quick note.

410
00:29:59,516 --> 00:30:00,038
Speaker 1: Also working.

411
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,763
Speaker 1: I'm continuing at least to watch.

412
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:07,840
Speaker 0: volt is five and much more than rim has Ten episodes in but I feel I'm based on what you said to me.

413
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,703
Speaker 0: I gotta go deep.

414
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:16,950
Speaker 1: We're on episode 20 something and The every episode except for like the dog episode which is just like a random monster of the week episode.

415
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:21,797
Speaker 1: Other than that one episode every episode like Something happens they push.

416
00:30:22,018 --> 00:30:25,610
Speaker 1: the status quo does not stay still like they are pushing hard.

417
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:32,529
Speaker 1: It is quite interesting to see a super robot toy selling show that keeps going right?

418
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,915
Speaker 1: Doesn't let up.

419
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:44,365
Speaker 0: so, you know things of the day.

420
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:49,926
Speaker 0: so My favorite character in Adventure Time is actually LSP in terms like.

421
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:54,230
Speaker 0: there's something Hilarious about that character and that voice and everything.

422
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:58,297
Speaker 1: but LSP is definitely a top five.

423
00:30:58,738 --> 00:31:02,490
Speaker 1: I don't know there might there might be enough characters, but you know way up there highly ranked.

424
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:09,452
Speaker 0: Yeah, like LSP is right up there with like Marceline and Princess Bubblegum and like there's I actually you know I put all.

425
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:13,290
Speaker 1: I'm a person who likes weird side characters because they're more interesting.

426
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:22,113
Speaker 1: Even you know, even when main characters do have interesting things about them which Adventure Time all the main characters obviously do they always have.

427
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:30,729
Speaker 1: they're always a little less out there right than side characters because you do you need to use them more often if They're out there that they run out of material and don't work.

428
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:38,930
Speaker 1: But the out there ness of side characters always makes me like them more Even though you don't see them often, but I know I like this character a lot.

429
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,929
Speaker 0: But I know Scott is particularly a fan of the choose goose.

430
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:46,690
Speaker 1: I think choose goose might be the number one as like prismo cosmic owl choose goose.

431
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:49,744
Speaker 0: And it's very telling because now this is out of date.

432
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:58,010
Speaker 0: it only gets up through Elements which is near the end of Adventure Time, but there have been some appearances post that that are not in this video.

433
00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:04,170
Speaker 0: This is all of Adventure Time up through the end of elements, but only when choose goose is visible.

434
00:32:05,151 --> 00:32:09,523
Speaker 0: Yep, not even if he's talking he has to be on screen or it doesn't count.

435
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:10,686
Speaker 0: it is two minutes and 35 seconds long.

436
00:32:12,492 --> 00:32:21,249
Speaker 1: they took all the frames in which choose goose was on screen and Cut those frames out and pasted them in order, and that's it favorite bit.

437
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,430
Speaker 0: with shoes I mean the thing we quote the most is the armor thing.

438
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:33,201
Speaker 0: But yep my favorite thing with him ever is when Finn buys that cursed sword And he goes back to choose good because you didn't buy it.

439
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:35,589
Speaker 0: for me the fuck like he's pissed at.

440
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:36,514
Speaker 1: he's like What are you doing?

441
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:36,756
Speaker 1: Yeah?

442
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,850
Speaker 1: He's angry cuz like they went to another store.

443
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,312
Speaker 1: He's like.

444
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:41,483
Speaker 1: I know you went to go shop at the grass, huh, huh?

445
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:45,710
Speaker 1: Yeah a bunch of jerks Thought you were loyal customers of the choose goose.

446
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:47,092
Speaker 1: Now you're.

447
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,275
Speaker 1: now you're coming to me for help.

448
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, just so mad.

449
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:57,170
Speaker 1: So the thing I like about choose goose is that choose goose is simultaneously silly looking.

450
00:32:57,732 --> 00:33:00,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like this floppy goose thing though.

451
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,326
Speaker 0: We know canonically he can walk.

452
00:33:02,466 --> 00:33:04,777
Speaker 0: We didn't learn that until Right.

453
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:06,147
Speaker 1: well yeah, but he's just floppy looking.

454
00:33:06,167 --> 00:33:11,807
Speaker 1: yeah He is a merchant which is totally cool in a fantasy universe selling cool stuff right being.

455
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:14,569
Speaker 1: that's always everyone loves You know shot item shops, right?

456
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:16,535
Speaker 1: He's actually.

457
00:33:16,555 --> 00:33:23,910
Speaker 1: he rhymes in a silly way talks in a funny way But it otherwise is perfectly confident intelligent not foolish.

458
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:28,583
Speaker 1: You know he's just a quality merchant doing merchant biz right.

459
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:34,709
Speaker 1: He's not like doesn't have any issues You know just going about his biz mm-hmm, so what you got?

460
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:36,544
Speaker 1: So what do I have?

461
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:36,707
Speaker 1: so?

462
00:33:37,652 --> 00:33:45,432
Speaker 1: The NWHL after having to suspend their season with their failed bubble in Lake Placid Which was the she went away.

463
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:46,795
Speaker 0: people were watching that stuff.

464
00:33:47,456 --> 00:33:49,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was on Twitch and everything you know they were.

465
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,537
Speaker 1: They've managed to come back and finish it.

466
00:33:52,577 --> 00:34:05,530
Speaker 1: they basically finished it by just having you know a one weekend deal right a little semi-finals finals kind of thing and They managed to get that broadcast on NBC Sports Which was exciting?

467
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:10,065
Speaker 1: But it also meant that you couldn't watch it on Twitch in the United States.

468
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:10,929
Speaker 1: if you're in other countries.

469
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,103
Speaker 1: It was still on Twitch, but in doubt US twitch region blocks.

470
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:18,978
Speaker 1: you could use a VPN I guess but if you're in the US you had to use NBC Sports to watch it.

471
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:29,530
Speaker 1: the champions the Isabel Cup champions of 2021 is Boston because Boston needs more sports Whatever.

472
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:36,170
Speaker 1: Regardless It was still glad to see that they managed to finish it and didn't just cancel the whole thing.

473
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:41,543
Speaker 1: And I'm sure that next year There's you know there's been talk of like adding a team from Montreal so that'll bring them up to.

474
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:43,329
Speaker 1: you know even more teams.

475
00:34:44,991 --> 00:35:00,870
Speaker 1: Seven teams would that be seven teams, but yeah, it'll be a lot more exciting And they'll hopefully have a real ish season next time not plagued by plague Yeah, so to somewhat celebrate this this person What is their name on Twitter?

476
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,073
Speaker 0: Adam Stevens color-filled.

477
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:05,279
Speaker 1: madam Stevens color-filled mind on Twitter.

478
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,762
Speaker 1: took because there obviously is not an NWHL video game Although there should be all right.

479
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:18,950
Speaker 1: took NHL 21 EA Sports and where you can Customize your teams and your rosters and your jerseys and every right you can customize.

480
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:20,755
Speaker 1: That's how they every a sports game.

481
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:34,350
Speaker 1: lets you do that these days, and he basically set up the whole NWHL Right jerseys player rosters everything inside of NHL 2021 and I think that's pretty awesome.

482
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:42,638
Speaker 1: And there's a whole Twitter thread they posted with all the screenshots and descriptions of the whole thing going on here, so That's pretty cool.

483
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:49,730
Speaker 1: I say and I hope as You know Adam Stevens points out that like yeah, actually he wasn't able.

484
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:56,724
Speaker 1: He got it as close as he could but because of the limitations You know like there weren't even enough hairstyles available.

485
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:02,765
Speaker 1: right in an NHL 21 Like you probably couldn't even get a Mika's advantage at going on with the limitations and hairstyles.

486
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:03,628
Speaker 1: They got right.

487
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:06,495
Speaker 1: so Step up your game.

488
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:08,061
Speaker 1: EA Sports right.

489
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:10,330
Speaker 1: it's in the game now, so it has to be in the game.

490
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,526
Speaker 0: That's what your slogan was just making fun of EA for bringing out a new golf game.

491
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,682
Speaker 0: They were like Yeah, come on.

492
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,481
Speaker 0: Yeah It is not of a great track record for like.

493
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,208
Speaker 0: there's the people who play it.

494
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:28,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, sports games don't overlap as much for the people who play almost all other games.

495
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:46,750
Speaker 1: If you're out there, and you want to compete with EA Sports right But you can't because they got all those licenses like yeah, and shit, right There are plenty of women's sports leagues I'm sure that you could make very happy by paying them to license.

496
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,769
Speaker 1: You know their team logos and players and everything and you know games.

497
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:55,710
Speaker 0: I don't have to address that or market of the people who play EA games.

498
00:36:56,033 --> 00:36:57,406
Speaker 0: You might be able to make better games, too.

499
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,776
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could just make it like you know.

500
00:36:59,796 --> 00:37:03,046
Speaker 1: there's no reason the video game couldn't be.

501
00:37:03,227 --> 00:37:04,270
Speaker 1: you know even better, right?

502
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,149
Speaker 1: Why this if you came out with?

503
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,392
Speaker 1: NWHL 21?

504
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:13,471
Speaker 1: right somehow you managed to develop it all in a year, and it was better than NHL 21.

505
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:15,141
Speaker 1: There's no reason it couldn't be yeah.

506
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:16,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, why couldn't it be?

507
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,830
Speaker 1: People would play that right.

508
00:37:21,013 --> 00:37:26,550
Speaker 1: You know you might force EA to buy your company And incorporate your your thing into their lineup.

509
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,013
Speaker 1: I don't know.

510
00:37:27,475 --> 00:37:30,210
Speaker 0: so in the meta moment the geek nice book club book is the tale of Genji.

511
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:33,099
Speaker 0: We're reading it, and yeah, just follow along with us.

512
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,282
Speaker 0: I think I think the trajectory is Probably something like end of May or June we could probably do.

513
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:40,408
Speaker 0: the episode is what I'm feeling.

514
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,336
Speaker 1: Oh, you're reading that fast huh?

515
00:37:42,356 --> 00:37:47,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, well I was but this just this week I've been too busy to read so I slowed down a lot Sam.

516
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:48,684
Speaker 0: Okay.

517
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:50,515
Speaker 0: Good good cuz I was Hit a busy wall.

518
00:37:53,591 --> 00:37:56,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily no new video games have been released.

519
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:56,367
Speaker 1: to like.

520
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:56,709
Speaker 1: take me.

521
00:37:56,769 --> 00:38:01,730
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, unluckily that what it was made me busy this week was I actually started playing hearts of iron.

522
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:02,734
Speaker 0: God damn it.

523
00:38:02,754 --> 00:38:05,284
Speaker 1: That was what's made me busy as I'm actually doing work at work.

524
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:09,179
Speaker 0: Oh That clock never rings.

525
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,428
Speaker 1: yeah, I know.

526
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,402
Speaker 0: right You always make fun of me when I'm like I'm too.

527
00:38:13,422 --> 00:38:14,569
Speaker 0: I got a busy with work stuff.

528
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:20,790
Speaker 1: No, I'm hopefully gonna finish it all and then I'll be able to stop working for you know the remainder of my life.

529
00:38:22,713 --> 00:38:25,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah, let's just get right into it cuz this is a big topic way back.

530
00:38:26,352 --> 00:38:29,166
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to this, but I'll warn you this was 2006 for him and Scott.

531
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:34,150
Speaker 0: We did a show called television of our youth and we talked about all the shows we watched when we were young.

532
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:38,230
Speaker 0: I am sure we talked about the Simpsons at some point in that episode.

533
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:42,050
Speaker 1: I'm sure we've talked about the Simpsons at many points throughout the life of this podcast.

534
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:52,069
Speaker 0: There have been 15 more years of the Simpsons since we did that episode Which is more seasons of the Simpsons than we have seen.

535
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:53,754
Speaker 1: That's true.

536
00:38:54,136 --> 00:38:56,046
Speaker 0: That's why I want to bring that up.

537
00:38:56,508 --> 00:39:01,637
Speaker 0: we Might have talked about the Simpsons 15 years ago, I think.

538
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:06,469
Speaker 0: to this date like I have seen about a quarter of all Simpsons episodes

539
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:24,044
Speaker 1: I have probably seen no Simpsons episode that came out between when we did that podcast and now I Basically if we had done a Simpsons podcast on that day It would probably have similar material to the podcast we're about to do other than the fact that we're talking about how there were 15 Years of time.

540
00:39:24,246 --> 00:39:30,050
Speaker 0: I remember In AV Club said something like we're not gonna bother reviewing every Simpsons episode ever anymore.

541
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:34,801
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's the fascinating thing about the Simpsons like the thing like that.

542
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:57,329
Speaker 0: the overarching theme of this episode I think is that it looms Terrifyingly large in not just the pop culture of people our age but like on the internet like the Simpsons is so deeply ingrained in so many places and yet Pretty much everyone on earth agrees that only the first ten ish seasons were good.

543
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:15,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the only term the only kinds of properties right in the world that are like big enough to like Be on Simpsons level Would be things like Pokemon I guess all Disney combined right.

544
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:17,504
Speaker 1: not any one Disney right, but like just.

545
00:40:17,645 --> 00:40:33,507
Speaker 1: you know the full Disney Loadout right or like you know maybe even the full Warner Brothers loadout you but all of them together Right could be on like the Simpsons Level of bigness right like Gundam is I don't think as big as Simpsons.

546
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:36,439
Speaker 1: It's close I guess cuz Pokemon is bigger than that right.

547
00:40:36,479 --> 00:40:38,950
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz remember we're not talking about number of episodes like at the word.

548
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,824
Speaker 0: There's like one piece episode 4,000 or what I like, but and Pokemon and Pokemon.

549
00:40:43,844 --> 00:40:49,647
Speaker 1: I think is what is it got to be at least Close to ten years younger than Simpsons is?

550
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:54,446
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's it's just unbelievably huge.

551
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:59,970
Speaker 1: you could I mean I'm sure there are several Simpsons only podcasts for us to do one episode on it.

552
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,246
Speaker 1: It's like we can't even scratch the surface of what you know.

553
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:04,090
Speaker 1: what's going on there.

554
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:16,830
Speaker 0: It's interesting that it's one of the rare shows where it would be very easy for people like us about our age say oh Yeah, I liked X when I was young and it was good But then it got bad and everyone who likes it now does is stupid.

555
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:22,090
Speaker 0: But this is like the one case where everyone has nostalgia for like this one era of the Simpsons.

556
00:41:22,913 --> 00:41:25,742
Speaker 0: But it seems like it is like a hundred percent legit.

557
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:31,960
Speaker 0: that feeling and what I've got up on the screen here And which is I'm just looking at cuz it really there's a lot of analysis like this.

558
00:41:32,341 --> 00:41:38,009
Speaker 0: someone did an analysis of the IMDB rating Just like what do people rate episodes of this show?

559
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:46,830
Speaker 0: for all of the Simpsons and It maps one to one with my understanding and feeling and thoughts on the Simpsons.

560
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:48,379
Speaker 1: It's well.

561
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,245
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

562
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:56,250
Speaker 1: It's like yeah I see that these newer episodes that I've never watched are ranked lowly compared to the ones from our heyday, right?

563
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,733
Speaker 1: But it's like.

564
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:59,979
Speaker 1: is that really because they're worse?

565
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,328
Speaker 1: or is it because the audience of this has?

566
00:42:03,348 --> 00:42:05,359
Speaker 1: I don't know I have no numbers.

567
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:13,240
Speaker 1: has the Simpsons continued to capture a The you know new audience as time has gone on?

568
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:18,519
Speaker 1: or are that because we're the prime People I want to sit right?

569
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,452
Speaker 0: it came out in the show my family would watch Religiously.

570
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:26,424
Speaker 1: this show came out into being when we were in like fifth sixth grade.

571
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:27,166
Speaker 1: I guess right.

572
00:42:27,186 --> 00:42:31,647
Speaker 1: why the late Come here's before that?

573
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:35,690
Speaker 1: I Remember being like elementary school cafeteria.

574
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:41,046
Speaker 0: I don't think you started watching it on the Tracy Altman show like our family did pretty sure his fifth grade.

575
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:46,902
Speaker 1: when the Simpsons came out I Was in kindergarten.

576
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:49,013
Speaker 1: what like 80?

577
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:50,566
Speaker 1: No, okay, maybe a little earlier than that.

578
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:52,516
Speaker 0: I don't know I was are we?

579
00:42:52,556 --> 00:42:52,897
Speaker 0: we are?

580
00:42:52,978 --> 00:43:03,010
Speaker 0: but we would watch the Tracy Altman show as a family and The Simpsons like the precursors to the Simpsons were on that show as like animated skits, right?

581
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:06,983
Speaker 0: And we watched those like the night they aired as a family right

582
00:43:07,023 --> 00:43:12,138
Speaker 1: and then it became its own show yeah Created by Matt Groening who also did lots of like little

583
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:20,483
Speaker 0: and I think you don't understand like if you're younger than us that TV Was still up like in American culture in particular like TV.

584
00:43:20,503 --> 00:43:21,285
Speaker 1: There was no internet.

585
00:43:21,707 --> 00:43:22,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was no internet.

586
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:35,924
Speaker 0: so when a new show came out, especially an animated show, especially a controversial animated show cuz the Simpsons was Terrible like weirdly controversial for like the first four years of its run.

587
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:36,144
Speaker 0: like.

588
00:43:36,445 --> 00:43:38,290
Speaker 1: so when the show is new, right?

589
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:46,638
Speaker 1: It's like, you know the the I guess the the thing that preceded it that you would compare it to would be like the Flintstones Right like a cartoon that was on primetime.

590
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,310
Speaker 1: that was you know based on in a family, right?

591
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:55,765
Speaker 1: You know, it's honeymooners asked, you know Simpsons has some of that honeymooners DNA in it as well.

592
00:43:55,965 --> 00:44:00,525
Speaker 0: clearly at least the early Simpsons This is a lot of the DNA of the all the early sitcoms.

593
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:08,030
Speaker 0: Yes It's almost like they took the best techniques of all the early sit long long running ridiculously popular, right?

594
00:44:08,491 --> 00:44:14,790
Speaker 1: So, you know the Simpsons had a lot of that same formula only, you know refreshed, right?

595
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:25,335
Speaker 1: You know for the late 80s early 90s times Yeah, it was super controversial because it's like, you know You had all the same people.

596
00:44:25,395 --> 00:44:27,041
Speaker 1: you see now getting mad about.

597
00:44:27,061 --> 00:44:31,435
Speaker 1: you know, Lil Nas X and they're like Oh, you know kids watching this.

598
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:37,470
Speaker 1: it's so violent and you know heinous and dirty and you know uncouth things are happening.

599
00:44:39,473 --> 00:44:40,542
Speaker 1: Kids can't be watching.

600
00:44:40,643 --> 00:44:47,343
Speaker 0: when I was in fifth grade We went to an amusement park and I had a Bart Simpson shirt on and the amusement park made me turn it inside out Or they wouldn't let our family in.

601
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:50,540
Speaker 1: Wow, like don't have a cow man.

602
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,029
Speaker 0: Yeah that the shirt was the don't have a cow man shirt.

603
00:44:54,211 --> 00:45:01,470
Speaker 0: Bart Simpson was seen as too subversive to display in public by a scary number of people when we were kids.

604
00:45:02,331 --> 00:45:03,657
Speaker 1: Meanwhile Bart Simpson is.

605
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:06,610
Speaker 1: that is actually like the most corporate possible, right?

606
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:19,777
Speaker 0: Might as well be Mickey Mouse at this point but also in that era Bart Simpson like the worst thing Bart Simpson ever did in any Simpsons episode I ever saw like Eric Cartman was worse than that within seconds.

607
00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:22,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, that's the whole thing is like a ridge.

608
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:28,204
Speaker 1: the original Simpsons The sort of you know, the the the image of it was.

609
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:37,710
Speaker 1: it's mostly about you know This is family, but the main character is Bart is as bad You know sort of troublemaking kid is not a role model for your kids, right?

610
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:38,773
Speaker 1: So you don't want your kids watching.

611
00:45:39,174 --> 00:45:46,238
Speaker 1: but the show first of all Bart didn't really, you know other than like, you know Mild pranks.

612
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,669
Speaker 1: It's like what?

613
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:50,825
Speaker 1: Misbehaving stuff does Bart actually do?

614
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:54,602
Speaker 0: I mean later on it There's like the episode where Bart quote goes too far like there's.

615
00:45:54,622 --> 00:46:05,272
Speaker 0: there's a few things like that that happen at one point Yeah, but some of those things like accidents too, right or like the dog in the vent was a legit accident Right.

616
00:46:05,312 --> 00:46:06,659
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, he wasn't like.

617
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:11,298
Speaker 0: purposefully you're calling me a liar Right, and we can't quote.

618
00:46:11,378 --> 00:46:12,884
Speaker 0: the fucking Simpsons is gone forever.

619
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,210
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna nip that in the bud right now.

620
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:17,821
Speaker 1: I caught myself but like, you know the episode like stampy the elephant.

621
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:20,870
Speaker 1: He's like he just innocently cares about this elephant.

622
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:26,230
Speaker 1: It causes trouble, but he's not like trying to have an elephant stomp the town down or anything like that.

623
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,890
Speaker 1: You know, yeah, but I guess but the show transfers quickly right after those first few seasons.

624
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:43,650
Speaker 0: It's like really it's a Homer focused show and because the character of Homer changes as well Right, the Simpsons from being sort of my life where I've recognized this concept of the a-plot and the b-plot of a show.

625
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:45,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, well every episode has an a-plot and a b-plot.

626
00:46:45,985 --> 00:46:46,367
Speaker 1: That's the whole.

627
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:46,569
Speaker 0: yeah.

628
00:46:48,132 --> 00:47:01,297
Speaker 1: But yeah, the character of Homer changes after you know Earlier episodes right earlier seasons from being more of like a bad mad dad to the sort of you know Dope Homer that you are familiar with.

629
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,126
Speaker 0: Homer went through these eras kind of like Lupin like there was.

630
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:11,878
Speaker 0: there was loving but just bad at things Homer who moved into like Kind of stupid Homer to evil Homer.

631
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:16,230
Speaker 0: and then there was like evil Homer who was weirdly cunning like at like a dangerous animal.

632
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:21,364
Speaker 0: and then like Borderline offensive stereotype of a mentally challenged person Homer.

633
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:27,410
Speaker 0: and they've like just Oscillated around what Homer is over the years and I don't even know what Homer is like now.

634
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:29,419
Speaker 0: I literally have not seen an episode since season 13.

635
00:47:29,419 --> 00:47:31,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no idea.

636
00:47:32,931 --> 00:47:34,094
Speaker 1: But yeah that you know, I think.

637
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:39,450
Speaker 1: but the show quick got away from that, you know being about Bart the bad kid, right?

638
00:47:40,652 --> 00:47:41,836
Speaker 1: You know to being about.

639
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:45,709
Speaker 1: you know, the family as a whole right or even some episodes are just about.

640
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,329
Speaker 1: you know Different characters in the town.

641
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:49,243
Speaker 1: Simpsons family is not even there.

642
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:53,812
Speaker 0: very slowly They started like Moe would have more speaking lines like one by one They would like.

643
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,158
Speaker 0: ah, we need to freshen the show up.

644
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,750
Speaker 0: bring one of the characters in hand him two knives.

645
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,478
Speaker 1: That's how they got so many episodes.

646
00:48:00,538 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 1: is that by fleshing out this town and this cast of characters?

647
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:07,525
Speaker 1: They could start making episodes about different characters, right?

648
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:12,918
Speaker 1: You know, we got the famous steamed hams, right Chalmers and Skinner.

649
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:18,606
Speaker 1: it's like though talk about side characters, right Chalmers Right, but everyone knows who that is.

650
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:21,522
Speaker 1: Yep somehow, you know, but like.

651
00:48:21,583 --> 00:48:21,904
Speaker 1: it's like.

652
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:31,888
Speaker 0: the reason I love the show so much other than like it was the era when there was television and it was literally the funniest thing on television at the time.

653
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:35,199
Speaker 0: Cuz like what was he gonna compete with?

654
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:56,230
Speaker 0: like SNL was never funny, so but basically The show once it came into its own and I didn't recognize This until later when I started actually care and learn about like when writers changed in the show and you can sort of see like patterns The Simpsons did something that sort of revolutionized this kind of comedic television.

655
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:05,199
Speaker 0: The show was dense with jokes to the point that it made others especially starting like season 3 or 4 especially season 4 To where it made.

656
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:19,130
Speaker 0: all the other Comedy shows I would watch as a kid just seem slow and plotting and sparse and unfunny as a result Even if you watch something like Seinfeld right, which is you know, less old than The Simpsons, right?

657
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:24,150
Speaker 1: But all right, which which started and ended in the time The Simpsons is aired.

658
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:28,123
Speaker 1: Since Seinfeld is kind of slow, right?

659
00:49:28,444 --> 00:49:31,733
Speaker 1: It was fine at the time but if you watch it now It'll be like joke.

660
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:39,505
Speaker 1: They're like, they'll tell a joke and then like you'll just see Jerry like Standing there looking at someone after he says the funny line.

661
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,670
Speaker 0: Hello the lantern.

662
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:51,750
Speaker 1: Right, there'll be a there'll be a pause a laugh track and like nothing is happening Right and The Simpsons there is in times where nothing is happening.

663
00:49:52,111 --> 00:49:55,264
Speaker 1: It's like like there's even the density of jokes.

664
00:49:55,304 --> 00:50:03,290
Speaker 0: They'll be like a visual gag Simultaneous to a like a character joke and then there'll be a background joke like all in the span of six seconds.

665
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:04,795
Speaker 1: Yep, you'll have.

666
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:07,550
Speaker 1: you know, you have the a pot in a plot B plot, right?

667
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,553
Speaker 1: You know the every episode.

668
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:23,040
Speaker 1: this the standard formula at least is to intro the episode with this one plot and then that There's a wave in Springfield the pool track has come to town Exactly, then you transfer to the second plot.

669
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,986
Speaker 1: That's really the meat of the episode.

670
00:50:25,046 --> 00:50:37,070
Speaker 1: Homer buys a pool Exactly, but then somehow that our original plot that you started the episode with comes and ties in Probably at the end but not necessarily originally.

671
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,310
Speaker 0: They tie in pretty directly like one would just directly cause the second one.

672
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:49,250
Speaker 0: But then the show started to do what you're describing where the first plot would kind of go off the second plot would spring up Sort of out of nowhere and then they tie together at the end in a hilarious

673
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:56,530
Speaker 1: Right, but as you're exploring this main plot or even this either one of the plots, right?

674
00:50:56,911 --> 00:50:58,014
Speaker 1: You're seeing how.

675
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:04,350
Speaker 1: you know, it goes on over time and you're also seeing how it impacts different characters, right?

676
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:06,298
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like okay.

677
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,410
Speaker 1: We've got this pool in Homer's backyard.

678
00:51:08,992 --> 00:51:10,778
Speaker 1: What happens with Milhouse in the pool?

679
00:51:10,858 --> 00:51:11,962
Speaker 1: know what happens?

680
00:51:12,484 --> 00:51:12,745
Speaker 1: Right?

681
00:51:12,965 --> 00:51:14,290
Speaker 1: What happens with Bart in the pool?

682
00:51:15,393 --> 00:51:17,752
Speaker 0: episode with Martin Right.

683
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:20,042
Speaker 1: what happens with Flanders in the pool, right?

684
00:51:20,123 --> 00:51:21,770
Speaker 1: It's like I don't even know if Flanders is in the pool.

685
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:26,990
Speaker 1: I don't remember how long ago this was but it's like you can get lots and lots of jokes out of that, right?

686
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:32,430
Speaker 1: It's like okay there, you know, they're doing you know, I'm just making stuff up and remember episodes that do this.

687
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,543
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, you'll be.

688
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:52,290
Speaker 1: you know characters might be going from A to B and they might stop in at you know, the racist quickie Mart or somewhere else right and Suddenly you're telling jokes with other character Stop it at Moe's Tavern right for a quick joke and then back out, right?

689
00:51:52,390 --> 00:52:02,070
Speaker 1: You're there got the same setup and you're just hitting Throughout the town or throughout wherever at different angles and different characters, right?

690
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:06,830
Speaker 1: And even like rim said sometimes in the background, you know, it's like, okay.

691
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:09,810
Speaker 1: So the main thing going on in Moe's Tavern, right?

692
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:19,770
Speaker 1: The main joke is Homer and Moe talking about something and Barney's do something in the background To throw in a quick side joke, all right to sort of fill fill the space there.

693
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:30,560
Speaker 0: And if you're like interviews of that over and over and over again Like during that era when they hit the maximum density of jokes per second Was the era when they were just working themselves to death like the only.

694
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:36,010
Speaker 0: it's kind of like game design and the game Advance Wars And people would say oh, why is it so hard to make a game like this?

695
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:36,973
Speaker 0: Like why don't you make more?

696
00:52:37,515 --> 00:52:45,330
Speaker 0: it takes so much effort to make something like that so dense with quality That I don't think that pace was even like reasonably sustainable.

697
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:54,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they were right it so of course, you know The joke came eventually from another long-running show South Park, right like Simpsons did it?

698
00:52:55,451 --> 00:52:59,930
Speaker 1: They've been running so long and not only they've been running so long, but the shows were so dense.

699
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:01,916
Speaker 1: What could you possibly?

700
00:53:01,936 --> 00:53:06,810
Speaker 1: what story could you tell right that the Simpsons has not already told right?

701
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,917
Speaker 1: They're running out of ideas like geek nights is And not even just the same story.

702
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:15,790
Speaker 0: you can't use like the same joke multiple times too soon.

703
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:23,570
Speaker 0: Yep, like seeds feed and seed you can't have that in the background again or a similar joke again for at least a decade.

704
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,850
Speaker 0: Granted that means they can use a joke three times if they follow the decade rule.

705
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:29,852
Speaker 1: But it's like.

706
00:53:29,932 --> 00:53:34,265
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, the Simpsons is done pretty much everything that can be done.

707
00:53:34,385 --> 00:53:35,890
Speaker 1: how does it still go on?

708
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:40,730
Speaker 0: Part of it too is that it still makes its blood comes from the stone.

709
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:46,485
Speaker 0: But like very online people like I can I have a lot more options than watching TV.

710
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:46,786
Speaker 0: So it was.

711
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:50,962
Speaker 0: this perfect confluence of TV was the only way to get a lot of like.

712
00:53:50,983 --> 00:54:10,910
Speaker 0: this kind of entertainment at the time coupled with the show was Literally at a peak that had not existed in the world in that format before and then both They couldn't sustain that pace for all the reasons we talked about and The internet literally changed everything and those are the two forces that I think caused the Simpsons to become deeply mediocre.

713
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think even if right these Simpsons had put out the exact same episodes.

714
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:18,170
Speaker 1: No episodes were changed, right?

715
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:30,203
Speaker 1: What really I think made it bigger in my life that in the lives of many people than it was and otherwise would have Was that it was syndicated so heavily.

716
00:54:30,223 --> 00:54:32,130
Speaker 0: I'd said I turned on the TV random.

717
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,308
Speaker 1: Sure, there was in in the 90s, right?

718
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:42,028
Speaker 1: especially Pretty much mid to late 90s when I was watching the most TV right before I went to college and stopped watching TV.

719
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:43,153
Speaker 1: pretty much Right.

720
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:46,150
Speaker 1: It wasn't just Simpsons is on Sunday night.

721
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:48,397
Speaker 1: That was only when the new episodes came on after foot.

722
00:54:48,457 --> 00:54:52,970
Speaker 0: reruns are on every goddamn day and multiple times every single day.

723
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,254
Speaker 1: We would watch right.

724
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:55,176
Speaker 1: so there would be.

725
00:54:55,317 --> 00:54:55,618
Speaker 1: there'd be.

726
00:54:55,818 --> 00:54:59,770
Speaker 1: we hadn't because we're in Connecticut even at the time when we didn't have cable.

727
00:55:00,311 --> 00:55:02,738
Speaker 1: Okay, no cable, but we're in Connecticut.

728
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:06,890
Speaker 1: So the antenna picks up Connecticut stations and New York station.

729
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:12,290
Speaker 1: Oh, so we would have like Fox 5 which was like New York City Fox, right?

730
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:19,997
Speaker 1: And then we would have like channel 20 some Connecticut Fox Affiliate, you know channel that would.

731
00:55:20,178 --> 00:55:22,827
Speaker 1: that's be where you watch like your Sailor Moon when you came home from school.

732
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:28,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, right And you could watch at like before dinner, right?

733
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:40,530
Speaker 1: like matter forget the exact times five five thirty something like that a Simpsons on one and Then the other one would immediately after have another different Simpsons episode.

734
00:55:40,611 --> 00:55:41,235
Speaker 0: Yep, there was.

735
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,342
Speaker 0: there was a good job.

736
00:55:42,403 --> 00:55:43,067
Speaker 0: It was Simpsons.

737
00:55:43,087 --> 00:55:49,852
Speaker 1: Simpsons You could get a full hour of Simpsons before dinner and I think that there were at some points I don't remember.

738
00:55:49,872 --> 00:55:56,650
Speaker 1: it feels like there were times where you could get three Simpsons in a day on broadcast television where I live.

739
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:00,570
Speaker 0: But also there'd be a new channels at the right time, you know, this is an old time.

740
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,248
Speaker 0: There'd be a new episode every week.

741
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:12,941
Speaker 0: No one had seen that episode before and literally everyone you knew would watch that episode except the Christian families that wouldn't let their kids Watch it Who would usually try to sneak over someone else's house.

742
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:21,408
Speaker 0: so like I would go to middle school the next day and literally every single person I knew had also watched that Simpsons episode.

743
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:32,250
Speaker 0: and And you can't underestimate like if you were in middle or high school with me or with a lot of people our age People were just quoting the Simpsons at each other as like background noise.

744
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:37,082
Speaker 1: Yep, if it was just like this language right the same way.

745
00:56:37,122 --> 00:56:39,408
Speaker 1: We have a language of memes today, right?

746
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,845
Speaker 0: There was a language of the Simpsons, which is I think is why that was.

747
00:56:42,886 --> 00:56:43,610
Speaker 1: there was no me.

748
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:44,817
Speaker 1: There were no internet memes.

749
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:46,909
Speaker 1: We couldn't be like, you know, yo dog, right?

750
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:53,367
Speaker 0: I put an X in your X and it's noteworthy how the Simpsons are still used as memes say even by people who didn't grow up during that.

751
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:58,184
Speaker 0: and Most Simpsons memes are from those first like 13 ish seasons for some reason.

752
00:56:58,204 --> 00:57:01,269
Speaker 0: Yeah Some reason yeah.

753
00:57:02,032 --> 00:57:16,510
Speaker 1: But even if you didn't watch it on Sunday night, right that episode that just came out Sunday night would get syndicated within a year or two right and Before DVD box sets you could not afford a all VHS of Simpsons unless you were rich.

754
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:16,992
Speaker 0: We can't.

755
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:20,510
Speaker 0: we taped everyone every single everyone but other people didn't.

756
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:28,382
Speaker 0: So it's not be those tapes and pass them around Sure, but you in that thanks to the syndication.

757
00:57:28,402 --> 00:57:30,588
Speaker 1: I saw every freaking episode.

758
00:57:30,768 --> 00:57:32,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, right You know.

759
00:57:32,931 --> 00:57:47,237
Speaker 1: So and that's everyone you knew was the Simpsons watcher also saw every episode because of that syndication Yep which is so we can all those the Simpsons language together and just assume anyone we were talking to to Had seen most of the Simpsons.

760
00:57:47,478 --> 00:57:48,281
Speaker 0: like that was just a thing.

761
00:57:48,321 --> 00:57:54,540
Speaker 0: I could assume of anyone I talked to in my youth Except like everybody nurse were too Christian and weird about it.

762
00:57:55,122 --> 00:57:57,930
Speaker 1: So now as for the the declining popularity, right?

763
00:57:57,990 --> 00:58:01,310
Speaker 1: It's like I feel having again having not watched any episode.

764
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:09,878
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of episodes of like some years ago from like seasons 15 16 17 and they were just like Okay, like they weren't nothing.

765
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,385
Speaker 0: they were okay, like they weren't bad.

766
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,053
Speaker 0: They just weren't that funny Like.

767
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:15,430
Speaker 0: I will anyway watch them as a primary activity.

768
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:22,984
Speaker 1: I can't comment on their quality But I think you know There are other reasonable explanations for why the pie player has gone down.

769
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:29,090
Speaker 1: if it's not capturing a new audience Right if it is still the same audience, there's just attrition Pete, right?

770
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:36,500
Speaker 1: Not only attrition, but it's like, you know, we're going to see those episodes as you know The the best like.

771
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,609
Speaker 1: that's what you're competing with.

772
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:43,208
Speaker 1: So, of course, we're gonna rate anything newer as not as good but I have experience like Emily went through this.

773
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,014
Speaker 0: a lot of people I know have gone through this of.

774
00:58:45,315 --> 00:58:47,783
Speaker 0: they'd never seen the Simpsons and we.

775
00:58:47,803 --> 00:59:05,910
Speaker 0: they watched a bunch of it in the current era and I've consistently found when I have shown people the Simpsons that They really really get into it because I usually show them the same seasons that we know like four or five six ish and then they Usually discover that they don't like the later seasons at all.

776
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:09,383
Speaker 1: Nick it's you know, that's also a reasonable explanation.

777
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:14,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, right But yeah for you know, how many other things?

778
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:20,870
Speaker 1: Right are so long running but have this reputation of getting worse, right?

779
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:23,218
Speaker 1: Usually things jump the shark and then they go away.

780
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:26,470
Speaker 1: happy days jump the shark and it didn't last too much longer after the shark.

781
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have like a sharp decline and either a rebound or a class.

782
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:34,770
Speaker 0: But the Simpsons just like this very very long slow decline.

783
00:59:35,513 --> 00:59:37,803
Speaker 1: It's like no one wants to be the person who ends it.

784
00:59:38,265 --> 00:59:41,397
Speaker 0: It's like well How do you even end a show like that?

785
00:59:41,919 --> 00:59:43,283
Speaker 0: Like what's the last episode?

786
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:44,527
Speaker 1: you just you just don't.

787
00:59:44,607 --> 00:59:45,330
Speaker 1: why do you have to do?

788
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,539
Speaker 1: A special last episode?

789
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:50,962
Speaker 1: just be like, okay, you know What was the last episode of the current season of the previous season?

790
00:59:51,303 --> 00:59:52,186
Speaker 1: just like okay no more.

791
00:59:52,307 --> 00:59:52,889
Speaker 0: that's what I would do.

792
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:58,890
Speaker 0: That's actually what we're there that could delisters were talking about that concept in the chat and that's what I proposed earlier.

793
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,862
Speaker 1: Why do you have to do a Seinfeld style ending?

794
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:02,050
Speaker 1: people might just hate it anyway.

795
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:03,970
Speaker 0: You know what I would do bad job with it.

796
01:00:04,131 --> 01:00:09,247
Speaker 0: I would just make the last episode be the Simpsons characters acting out word-for-word with no changes.

797
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:10,170
Speaker 0: the last episode of mash.

798
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:12,079
Speaker 1: You could do that too.

799
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,927
Speaker 0: That is what I would do.

800
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,488
Speaker 0: That would be very funny to me.

801
01:00:16,551 --> 01:00:19,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if that would be funny to anyone else, I don't know.

802
01:00:20,104 --> 01:00:34,769
Speaker 0: but I guess before we like the things I liked about the Simpsons the most like when I think back was like specifically Principal Skinner was the funniest character in the entire show and I will die on that hill.

803
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:36,814
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.

804
01:00:36,854 --> 01:00:41,989
Speaker 0: I think the best the best humor came out of like the spaces around principal Skinner.

805
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:49,720
Speaker 1: Okay But he's not my favorite guy Because he's like.

806
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:50,870
Speaker 0: he's not funny.

807
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:57,880
Speaker 0: It's everything around him becomes becomes funny as a result of his like extreme non funniness, which itself is funny.

808
01:01:02,071 --> 01:01:03,897
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know like.

809
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:04,861
Speaker 0: what would you point to?

810
01:01:04,921 --> 01:01:06,948
Speaker 0: is the parts of the Simpsons you particularly enjoy?

811
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:08,574
Speaker 1: it's weird Did like I know.

812
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:12,950
Speaker 1: actually I can't think of like a part as like which part of the Simpsons is funnier, right?

813
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,652
Speaker 1: It's like it's.

814
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:16,562
Speaker 1: I don't know if there is a part that's funnier.

815
01:01:16,682 --> 01:01:18,950
Speaker 1: I guess there are parts that are less funny.

816
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:20,233
Speaker 1: Right, like.

817
01:01:20,273 --> 01:01:22,743
Speaker 1: I didn't really care about Marge's sisters that much.

818
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,089
Speaker 1: They were sort of annoying, right?

819
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:27,923
Speaker 1: I wasn't you know, I was like, uh, really?

820
01:01:28,044 --> 01:01:31,631
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, but I Don't know.

821
01:01:31,651 --> 01:01:32,675
Speaker 1: It's just like it didn't really.

822
01:01:32,715 --> 01:01:36,549
Speaker 1: I think what it is is like, you know, like I was talking about.

823
01:01:37,772 --> 01:01:40,020
Speaker 1: You know the side characters in Adventure Time, right?

824
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:50,203
Speaker 1: The Simpsons is nothing but side characters And you're sort of you're getting them all the time all over the place Like any episode is giving you a huge pile of them now.

825
01:01:50,263 --> 01:01:51,850
Speaker 0: You're thinking of a guy with two knives.

826
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:55,180
Speaker 0: Right, that's actually relatively later season too.

827
01:01:55,963 --> 01:02:02,088
Speaker 1: And some of them are even you know More brief right like, you know seed bell guy.

828
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:07,601
Speaker 1: Right You know, it's like he appears so like.

829
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:08,345
Speaker 1: what's that guy's name?

830
01:02:08,365 --> 01:02:11,195
Speaker 0: I forget What are you talking about?

831
01:02:11,215 --> 01:02:13,726
Speaker 1: I was chatting with the guy with this the guy with the seed bell.

832
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:17,025
Speaker 0: Oh Hans moldman Hans moment.

833
01:02:17,045 --> 01:02:21,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like Significant.

834
01:02:21,093 --> 01:02:26,250
Speaker 0: you just not have complete encyclopedic perfect memory of the first 11 seasons of The Simpsons like I do.

835
01:02:26,611 --> 01:02:28,341
Speaker 1: Complete encyclopedic memory of a show.

836
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,729
Speaker 1: I haven't watched in 20 years.

837
01:02:31,212 --> 01:02:33,748
Speaker 0: They're just burned into my brain because I watched them on loop as a kid.

838
01:02:34,211 --> 01:02:42,710
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of them are burned into my brain, but you know, it's like Yeah Not gonna remember if we're gonna Hans moment's name at the job of a hat here.

839
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:49,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess that the real test I've noticed is that if I go watch cuz I tried this a while ago, too I just went and picked clip like.

840
01:02:50,007 --> 01:03:01,870
Speaker 0: I typed episode numbers of The Simpsons and watch clips and The old episode clips like just almost make me want to watch that episode again, even though I literally know it by heart.

841
01:03:02,572 --> 01:03:08,950
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and other things that I've loved in my childhood do not do that same thing to me as an adult.

842
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:10,989
Speaker 0: The Simpsons is one of the rare things.

843
01:03:11,552 --> 01:03:16,036
Speaker 0: It's gonna talk about this as something that can trap you if it's on a TV Like.

844
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,650
Speaker 0: you're not thinking about Star Wars.

845
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:21,852
Speaker 0: You walk by a TV like you're visiting your parents and Star Wars is on TV You.

846
01:03:21,873 --> 01:03:24,544
Speaker 0: just next thing, you know credits are rolling and you just sat there.

847
01:03:25,107 --> 01:03:25,730
Speaker 0: How did that happen?

848
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:37,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, a tape of Simpsons with no ads or breaks of any kind can definitely just trap a person there Watching it right at least if it's good episodes and such for however long, right weird I'll listen.

849
01:03:37,533 --> 01:03:45,628
Speaker 0: or tried to tell you it was Hans moment before I Corrected you or I pointed it out and it was blocked and flagged as a possibly inappropriate comment.

850
01:03:45,648 --> 01:03:49,328
Speaker 1: for some reason Hans moment is a inappropriate comment.

851
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:50,347
Speaker 0: I YouTube.

852
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:52,016
Speaker 1: Maybe there's some.

853
01:03:52,056 --> 01:03:53,304
Speaker 1: maybe there's something we don't know.

854
01:03:53,666 --> 01:03:54,048
Speaker 0: I don't know.

855
01:03:55,014 --> 01:03:56,441
Speaker 1: Maybe it's in another language.

856
01:03:56,562 --> 01:03:58,070
Speaker 1: I don't know Hans moment.

857
01:03:58,311 --> 01:04:04,834
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, if I if Hans moment means something that I don't know Clearly I'm clueless.

858
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:05,597
Speaker 1: Please inform me.

859
01:04:05,637 --> 01:04:09,470
Speaker 0: so I don't you know, well, I did click the button to let it appear in our YouTube stream.

860
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:12,009
Speaker 1: So, oh, well, I hope that wasn't a mistake.

861
01:04:12,685 --> 01:04:19,450
Speaker 0: but Yeah, the Simpsons I think at this point it's almost funnier to just see how long they can keep it going.

862
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:23,030
Speaker 0: But I don't want to watch any episodes of it.

863
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:34,302
Speaker 0: I just want to see like if it hits if it if the Simpsons out lives me That is legendary Started watching it basically like if it outlives me.

864
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:36,930
Speaker 0: it has been such a big part of my life, right?

865
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:41,410
Speaker 1: I mean assuming that I live as long as I would like right if it outlives me.

866
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:45,704
Speaker 1: Considering the people making it were adults when I was a child.

867
01:04:45,724 --> 01:04:46,246
Speaker 1: They're likely.

868
01:04:46,266 --> 01:04:48,996
Speaker 0: that means That everyone.

869
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:58,825
Speaker 1: it will be very likely that the people who are making it Right, we're not alive we are younger than the thing they're making right.

870
01:04:58,886 --> 01:05:03,682
Speaker 1: like nobody who works on this It would have been alive when the first episode of the Simpsons air.

871
01:05:03,742 --> 01:05:14,938
Speaker 0: if the venture brothers doesn't get canceled Like if it gets picked up, I feel like that'll be true of that because it takes them so long to make a season But has way way less seasons.

872
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:16,464
Speaker 0: it does sound like seven.

873
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,228
Speaker 0: it's taken them how long Mm-hmm.

874
01:05:20,351 --> 01:05:27,366
Speaker 0: but yeah, if you've know if you've somehow never watched the Simpsons like just Started like season four or five and just watch a bunch of episodes.

875
01:05:27,446 --> 01:05:28,130
Speaker 0: You'll see what we mean.

876
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:30,065
Speaker 0: I think you'll find it is nice that it's not.

877
01:05:30,568 --> 01:05:31,797
Speaker 1: you know There's so many things these days.

878
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:32,401
Speaker 1: are cereal?

879
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,549
Speaker 1: cereals are all the hotness.

880
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:39,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't watch any Simpsons anything about the Simpsons literally nothing Like.

881
01:05:39,231 --> 01:05:44,270
Speaker 0: just just pick a random episode between seasons four and eight and you pretty much can't go wrong.

882
01:05:44,754 --> 01:05:51,710
Speaker 0: Unless I'm looking to this chart Season six episode three is the only early season episode to have a very low rating.

883
01:05:52,094 --> 01:05:53,204
Speaker 1: I think that would be like a clip.

884
01:05:53,224 --> 01:05:58,645
Speaker 0: that's a clip show I think and that low rating is still higher than many of the ratings from later.

885
01:05:58,946 --> 01:06:00,029
Speaker 1: So cuz they're good clips.

886
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:00,751
Speaker 1: Yeah Good clips.

887
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:01,293
Speaker 0: Oh wait.

888
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,441
Speaker 0: No season nine episode 11.

889
01:06:03,441 --> 01:06:04,465
Speaker 0: That's the lowest one.

890
01:06:04,505 --> 01:06:05,750
Speaker 0: What the fuck was that episode?

891
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,461
Speaker 0: I want to look that up before we stop the show.

892
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,691
Speaker 0: season 9 episode 11.

893
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:25,095
Speaker 1: Yeah rim found a JPEG that is like, you know average ratings by like, you know, I am DB people so people who care enough about the Simpsons to rate episodes and average their ratings together per episode and then put them in a Visualization by season.

894
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:27,341
Speaker 0: so you can see not episode 12 episode.

895
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:28,003
Speaker 0: Come on.

896
01:06:28,464 --> 01:06:29,086
Speaker 0: Come on.

897
01:06:29,126 --> 01:06:29,969
Speaker 0: It's telly's keep point.

898
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:31,032
Speaker 0: Oh, here we go Here we go.

899
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,617
Speaker 0: I want to know what this episode was.

900
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:35,757
Speaker 0: Yeah clip show Highlighting the musical bow.

901
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:36,059
Speaker 0: Okay.

902
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was just a clip show.

903
01:06:37,709 --> 01:06:43,650
Speaker 1: Yeah But yeah, the Simpsons in by going so long they had to do every, you know, they've done everything.

904
01:06:43,771 --> 01:06:45,883
Speaker 1: But that means they had to do everything right?

905
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:51,324
Speaker 1: They did musicals Sentimental parts mystery plots, right?

906
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:54,034
Speaker 1: It's like sci-fi Lots of horror.

907
01:06:54,074 --> 01:06:55,838
Speaker 0: we didn't even talk about who shot mr.

908
01:06:55,878 --> 01:07:00,090
Speaker 0: Burns, which was like a legit cultural event in America.

909
01:07:01,172 --> 01:07:09,856
Speaker 0: Yep, like you people people talked about that like it was real Like until we found out who shot mr Burns like you don't understand.

910
01:07:10,338 --> 01:07:12,926
Speaker 0: you could not avoid that conversation anywhere.

911
01:07:13,087 --> 01:07:13,950
Speaker 0: Everyone had a theory.

912
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:15,155
Speaker 1: No, it was.

913
01:07:15,175 --> 01:07:16,199
Speaker 1: it was pride.

914
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,650
Speaker 1: That was probably maybe the pink Simpsons moment, right?

915
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,856
Speaker 1: I don't think Simpsons ever been bigger.

916
01:07:20,976 --> 01:07:29,017
Speaker 0: in the comments that itself was just parodying who shot jr of course Which is the last thing I'll leave you with.

917
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:46,089
Speaker 0: I have found that one thing that has been consistent in my life since about 2008 is that I run into a lot of people who will Notice a reference in a more current thing and say oh that's a reference to the Simpsons and have no idea That it is actually a reference to like treasure of the Sierra Madre.

918
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:57,669
Speaker 0: Yep, like the Simpsons became like because the Simpsons parodied and referenced so many things that it becomes the the nexus point Of references and people don't try to look earlier than it.

919
01:07:57,972 --> 01:07:59,629
Speaker 0: They just assume it came from the Simpsons.

920
01:08:00,292 --> 01:08:11,581
Speaker 1: If I tell a joke someone else told and I don't immediately say that is so-and-so's joke if this is anyone but And then you laugh at it and then you'd be.

921
01:08:11,681 --> 01:08:15,688
Speaker 1: and then now that in your brain is a Scott joke Even though I stole it from someone else.

922
01:08:16,352 --> 01:08:18,359
Speaker 1: That's just how you know, how are you?

923
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,546
Speaker 1: How are you to know unless someone points it out to you?

924
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:26,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so How many people just quote Star Wars and nobody's gives it a shit about hidden fortress?
