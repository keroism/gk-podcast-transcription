1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,310
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:10,592
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,562
Speaker 0: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:14,868
Speaker 1: - And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,599
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about lifestyle games.

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,998
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:27,510
Speaker 0: So, we did a show on food boxes, 'cause we, you know, we get food boxes here.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,616
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:30,888
Speaker 1: We just got a couple of food boxes yesterday.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:38,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, for the first time ever, I think my food box is, like, just not gonna show up.

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:39,331
Speaker 1: - Whoa.

12
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:51,410
Speaker 0: - There was supposed to be a blue apron here yesterday, and when I checked the tracking, you know, it's in that state where it says, like, the label was printed and they're awaiting the package to arrive to start shipping it.

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,277
Speaker 1: That's happened to us once or twice.

14
00:00:53,478 --> 00:00:55,466
Speaker 1: One time, they were like, "Look, it's not gonna come.

15
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:55,847
Speaker 1: Sorry.".

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,655
Speaker 0: Like, they emailed me.

17
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:15,148
Speaker 0: They automatically, I guess, their system automatically detects when the shipping isn't gonna come on the appointed day, so it automatically sent me an email that was like, "Look, if it doesn't come tomorrow, it's still fine, 'cause it's full of ice and it's cold as hell outside, but if it doesn't come tomorrow, we'll give you a full

18
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:15,590
Speaker 0: refund.".

19
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,896
Speaker 0: And sure enough, it's today.

20
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:20,853
Speaker 0: It's still not here yet, and the tracking still just says, "Label

21
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:21,335
Speaker 0: printed."

22
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,599
Speaker 0: Nothing.

23
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,189
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna eat this week.

24
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:32,021
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to, like, even though we ordered a pizza for lunch, I guess, what am I gonna eat for dinner, more pizza or something?

25
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,026
Speaker 1: - We have a plethora.

26
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,590
Speaker 1: - We have a cornucopia of food boxes and food if you needed some food.

27
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,667
Speaker 0: - I mean, you know, it's more like, you know, "Amanda, what's she gonna

28
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:45,948
Speaker 0: eat?".

29
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:48,478
Speaker 0: She usually, you know, I usually cook the box, right?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,534
Speaker 0: And then she'll take the other half of it to work, 'cause it's two servings.

31
00:01:52,554 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 0: But it's like, if I don't cook it, what's she gonna, she's gonna eat something for a night, you know?

32
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,520
Speaker 1: - So, meanwhile, going to two hockey games a couple days in a row, I did something that I haven't done in a while.

33
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:05,825
Speaker 1: Yelled a lot.

34
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:08,895
Speaker 1: Also, wearing a mask the whole time.

35
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:11,551
Speaker 1: You kind of yell louder, 'cause you can't hear your own voice as much.

36
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:17,515
Speaker 1: And I'm not talking in my real life as much as I do, and I kind of hurt my throat a little bit from all that yelling.

37
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:18,661
Speaker 0: - I hear that.

38
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:21,939
Speaker 0: I didn't hear it until you went, "Eh," before that you sounded fine.

39
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:30,251
Speaker 1: - It's the exact same thing that I used to feel after every single goddamn convention until I learned to do radio voice all the time at conventions.

40
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:32,017
Speaker 1: And you know what?

41
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:42,394
Speaker 1: I just didn't think to talk that way, 'cause for the last few years, other than talking to you on this and doing work meetings and talking to Emily, I don't really talk to people much.

42
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:48,050
Speaker 0: - I pretty much only talk at work meetings, and yeah, not a lot of talking.

43
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:58,773
Speaker 1: - And work meetings are, well, it's funny, 'cause half my work meetings are about like this, like I'm this on, and the other half of my work meetings are very like, "Yes, I have submitted the report,".

44
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,022
Speaker 1: very subdued, Brandon.

45
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:14,305
Speaker 0: - My work meetings are like, if I'm in a meeting, generally I'm just listening, and then when there's something I gotta say, then obviously I come out and I'm like, "Hey, this thing, this thing, this thing,".

46
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:14,425
Speaker 0: right?

47
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,021
Speaker 1: - My meetings are very different.

48
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,694
Speaker 0: - When other people are talking, I'm just sitting there.

49
00:03:18,714 --> 00:03:21,549
Speaker 1: - Most of my meetings are me talking most of the time.

50
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,715
Speaker 0: - Yeah, poking at some web browser, reading an article, listening carefully, listening also carefully.

51
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:28,297
Speaker 0: - Very

52
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:44,869
Speaker 1: rarely, if there's a meeting that I have to attend, like for political reasons, like the product manager has to be there, but it's a meeting that doesn't matter at all, I've learned to be able to play Overwatch while looking on the camera, like I'm, and I actually am paying attention, but I don't need to pay that much attention.

53
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,072
Speaker 0: - Nope.

54
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:53,150
Speaker 1: - So yeah, so the other thing, I was thinking about this, 'cause I beat Zelda 2 recently just for shits and giggles.

55
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,595
Speaker 0: - That's what you have time for?

56
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,084
Speaker 0: Did you finish the Tale of Genji?

57
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,090
Speaker 0: You have two days.

58
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,575
Speaker 1: - I got two chapters to go.

59
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:04,139
Speaker 1: You were right, the college years, like the post big moment.

60
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:04,969
Speaker 0: - It reads easier.

61
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,342
Speaker 1: - It reads easier, it reads different, and it also is structured a lot differently, like it's more like a modern novel.

62
00:04:11,362 --> 00:04:12,510
Speaker 0: - Also, less happens.

63
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:19,170
Speaker 1: - Well, I would argue that in some ways more happens compared to very early chapters.

64
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,701
Speaker 0: - But also less happens.

65
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:26,310
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but less, it's more like the drama intersects really quickly, but then also diffuses really quickly.

66
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,282
Speaker 0: - Anyway.

67
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:28,509
Speaker 0: - Anyway.

68
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,205
Speaker 0: - It also is gonna, just warning, it just sort of ends suddenly with no resolution.

69
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:53,429
Speaker 1: - So I've been reading chapter summaries after I finish chapters, and one of the chapters I just read, after I read it, I went and read a chapter summary like yesterday, and the chapter summary was like, there is a lot of evidence that this chapter is a forgery, it was written later, it was probably not part of the rest of Genji, there was a whole thing about it.

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,240
Speaker 0: - Yep, all kinds of stuff like that.

71
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,670
Speaker 1: - Yep, and there's a lot of that with everything after the shortest chapter in the book.

72
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:01,954
Speaker 0: - Yep.

73
00:05:01,974 --> 00:05:13,936
Speaker 1: - So, but anyway, so in Metroid, what would you say is the most high concept thing that Metroid 1, the game, did in terms of game design?

74
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,510
Speaker 0: - High, most high concept thing?

75
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,170
Speaker 1: - Something that hadn't really been done before, or that was really notable.

76
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:22,656
Speaker 0: - In Metroid 1?

77
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,570
Speaker 0: - In Metroid 1.

78
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:36,990
Speaker 0: - In Metroid 1, I guess the thing that Metroid did differently was that you had smooth scrolling, and not the pitfall one screen at a time.

79
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,719
Speaker 1: - Yep, you can go in multiple directions.

80
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:48,363
Speaker 0: - Right, yeah, it went up and down, and left and right, and it also had, you know, a lot of that secret finding going on that other games didn't have.

81
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:49,190
Speaker 1: - What about the title?

82
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,618
Speaker 1: When's the first time you see a Metroid?

83
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,550
Speaker 0: - Oh, like close to the end of the game?

84
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:08,349
Speaker 1: - Yep, you basically get to this area at the end of the game, and these Metroids you've been hearing about the whole time, they don't exist, you've never encountered one, and then suddenly you're on a weird part of the map, and there's fucking Metroids in your business every single screen.

85
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,119
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it's Torian.

86
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:19,481
Speaker 1: - So, I remembered that Zelda 2 had enemies that were only in the last castle, and that's just something I remember, there's those way more dangerous sword guys.

87
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:23,054
Speaker 0: - And Zelda 1 has that too, you got the eyeball, what's the eyeball guy's name?

88
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:26,470
Speaker 1: - I used to know that guy's name.

89
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,592
Speaker 1: Zelda 1 Eyeball Guy.

90
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:35,600
Speaker 1: But Zelda 2, not Eyegore, is it Eyegore?

91
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:37,586
Speaker 1: No, that's not...

92
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:44,132
Speaker 0: - I'm not talking about Goma the Spider, I'm talking about... I've got, just keep talking.

93
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:44,232
Speaker 0: -

94
00:06:44,252 --> 00:07:07,570
Speaker 1: So when Zelda 2, the game progresses, because by that point other Zelda's, other games that come out, but Zelda 2 is doing the thing where you start to encounter a bunch of different classes of enemies as the game goes on, but in the very end of the game, it just starts to max out at the blue guys, like the blue versions of everything are the hardest damn things in the game.

95
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:30,762
Speaker 1: Then you get into the castle at the end, and not only are there none of those blue guys, but there are like six or seven completely new unique things you have never encountered before in the whole game, different patterns you've never encountered, that final dungeon has like enemy concepts that you have never encountered up to this point.

96
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,852
Speaker 0: - Maybe Mario 1 has that too.

97
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:34,515
Speaker 0: - A little bit.

98
00:07:34,535 --> 00:07:43,424
Speaker 0: - Suddenly you get a Koopa, it's like suddenly, I guess it happens before like the eighth Koopa, but it's like suddenly Koopa's throwing hammers, right?

99
00:07:43,465 --> 00:07:44,891
Speaker 0: It's like, oh shit, right?

100
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:47,803
Speaker 0: Suddenly there's a water world in the middle of world eight.

101
00:07:47,823 --> 00:08:05,651
Speaker 1: - Blue Knight was the hardest thing you have ever seen in Zelda 2. up to that point, and suddenly there's no blue knights, there's this other knight that looks different who's jumping around and flying and has a million hit points, and the statues are all different, and I just noticed that and I see that.

102
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,980
Speaker 1: The giant slime only appears in that dungeon.

103
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,869
Speaker 0: - I mean a lot of games did that, that's not unique.

104
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:20,260
Speaker 1: - Not that many games at that point in gaming had several completely unique monsters that only appeared in the final level.

105
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:32,359
Speaker 0: - Well how many games are there that even had at that time, how many games were there that were sequential games that had an ending and a story and different guys, right?

106
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:39,080
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there weren't that many games that could even meet that qualification by their structure.

107
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,839
Speaker 1: - There's a decent number, but yeah, not that, like Guerrilla War had that technically, sort of.

108
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,129
Speaker 0: - You know, Contra, I guess had different guys.

109
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,777
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but it was always different.

110
00:08:49,118 --> 00:08:59,951
Speaker 1: It's more that Zelda really sort of leads you into, all right, you have hit the blue Rizzrobes, you've hit basically the most dangerous shit, and now we're gonna do the final dungeon, you get in there, not one blue Rizzrobe.

111
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:01,480
Speaker 1: There's a different kind of wizard.

112
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,285
Speaker 0: - All right.

113
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:05,200
Speaker 1: - That game holds up okay.

114
00:09:07,063 --> 00:09:09,939
Speaker 1: It actually does, it was pretty easy to beat and I enjoyed it.

115
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:36,731
Speaker 0: - I mean, Zelda 2 isn't terrible as a game overall, but it's just like, compared to most other Zelda games, most other Zelda games are legendarily S-tier, so it's sort of like a second half of Death Note situation, where like, even if that second half of Death Note considered on its own out of context is an okay normal manga, it feels like a shit manga because you just, it's part of Death Note 1, which is like A-tier, right?

116
00:09:36,752 --> 00:09:39,027
Speaker 1: - But also similarly, having played Zelda 2 again recently.

117
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:49,633
Speaker 0: - Zelda 2 coming after Zelda 1 is like, okay, if you just put out Zelda 2 on its own, if it was not a Zelda game, if it was some other game, it would be like a B to C-tier game.

118
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:50,375
Speaker 0: - I

119
00:09:50,576 --> 00:09:57,592
Speaker 1: think a little higher than that, but I will admit, as a kid, I liked Zelda 2 a lot, but then when Zelda 3 came

120
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:58,253
Speaker 0: out and I

121
00:09:58,353 --> 00:10:09,465
Speaker 1: played Zelda 3, I immediately recognized that it was refreshing to play Zelda 3 compared to Zelda 2, I felt that.

122
00:10:09,485 --> 00:10:10,975
Speaker 0: - Of course, Zelda 3's S-tier.

123
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:23,313
Speaker 0: But yeah, Zelda 2, I think because it was attached to Zelda 1, right, it gets a lot, people think of it as like C to D-tier.

124
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:26,227
Speaker 1: - Well, people also lose the context of - It's not legendary.

125
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:41,311
Speaker 0: - Nintendo was very much at that time trying to make radically different 2s, there's a lot of reasons they didn't release the real - Nintendo has, no, well, that's only because you have a US perspective where Mario 2 was different, whereas it wasn't really different, right?

126
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:45,224
Speaker 0: The real Mario 2 was just like Mario 1 with poison mushrooms, then it was harder.

127
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:58,598
Speaker 0: But Nintendo does and continues to have a history of not wanting to ever just take a game and make another game in the series.

128
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,047
Speaker 0: that's just like that game they just did, right?

129
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:11,649
Speaker 0: It's like, especially Zelda, right, they're always making, every Zelda game is like a different kind of game, you know, mostly, you know, they don't like to just keep, you know, it's kind of interesting.

130
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:16,170
Speaker 0: they're going to do Breath of the Wild 2 because I guess just so much money they can't not do it this time.

131
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:21,752
Speaker 1: - Well, also we'll see where and how it departs from Breath of the Wild 1, too, like we haven't seen the game yet.

132
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:34,974
Speaker 0: - Sure, but, you know, they keep, Nintendo always takes a game and tries to do something, you know, they don't just do a sequel that's like, okay, more of that same thing you just had, only another one.

133
00:11:35,074 --> 00:11:39,210
Speaker 0: They always spin every single time, even if it's a smaller spin.

134
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:50,818
Speaker 0: You think about like Mario Sunshine being a spin, right, where it's like, okay, you know, it's still a 3D Mario, but we'll give you this water thing going on, you know, Mario Odyssey, okay, it's a 3D Mario, is it really a spin?

135
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:52,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at all shit they did with the hat.

136
00:11:52,143 --> 00:12:02,067
Speaker 1: - They'll also take chances and be experimental sometimes, like they'll alternate between being really experimental and being really safe, but they'll make some stinkers along the way if they try to experiment.

137
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:14,010
Speaker 0: - Yeah, they just don't feel, you know, they won't do what other game companies do, where it's like, okay, it's Call of Duty 10, the same as all the other Call of Duty's, just another one.

138
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:22,184
Speaker 1: - Oh, which is kind of relevant to the main bit we're going to talk about, so I guess we should get into the news first, because there are two huge news in gaming.

139
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:26,963
Speaker 1: First off, right after all the other acquisitions we were just talking about, Sony felt left out.

140
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:31,982
Speaker 0: - Mostly the Microsoft Blizzard one, which the FTC is going to have a look at, which they should.

141
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,288
Speaker 1: - Yep, FTC better look at this one, too.

142
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:36,394
Speaker 1: Sony was left out.

143
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:39,724
Speaker 0: - Can the FTC look at a Japanese company like that?

144
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:42,133
Speaker 1: - Depends on how much of a US presence they have.

145
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:43,117
Speaker 0: - Okay.

146
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,985
Speaker 1: - Of either the acquirer or the acquiree.

147
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,107
Speaker 1: - All right.

148
00:12:47,127 --> 00:13:02,152
Speaker 1: - Granted, my personal, this is not investment advice, I have no special knowledge, I am not a registered investment advisor, is I suspect that the FTC will take zero action against anything related to gaming at any point in the next decade.

149
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:06,004
Speaker 1: I just cannot see that happening, but Sony...

150
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,488
Speaker 0: - They haven't taken action yet.

151
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:21,807
Speaker 1: - Yep, Sony is acquiring Bungie, completing the miracle of life, so everybody needs a lifestyle brand or a lifestyle game or a set of IP they can really hang their flag on.

152
00:13:21,827 --> 00:13:34,271
Speaker 0: - So if anyone doesn't know, Bungie got their start making games like Marathon, which was like the FPS that people with Macs played, because they couldn't play, you know, Doom as easily, right?

153
00:13:34,732 --> 00:14:20,408
Speaker 0: But you know, Marathon was actually pretty good, but then they struck it really big with Halo, obviously, and then, you know, Microsoft had them, but then at one point Bungie split off from Microsoft, but they left Halo behind, so Bungie, so Microsoft kept the Halo and let the Bungie part go, Bungie went on to make Destiny, right, which is their current, I guess, game, and now Sony is bringing them in, and I feel like they've really bounced around a lot, like Destiny used to be in like the Battle.net app, and now it's not, now it's, right, it's like they, and now Activision, that Blizzard Activision has now went back to Microsoft, it's like all kinds of different directions going on here,

154
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:20,790
Speaker 1: and

155
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:42,428
Speaker 0: I also, I remember there being like some drama involving like, the last time I thought about this company, because I don't play their games, as I remember years ago reading some drama involving like, right, there were some writers that were writing, probably Destiny, I imagine, and then like they had to switch to some other writers, and the guy was mad or something,

156
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:59,220
Speaker 1: yeah, well Destiny's a weird hybrid in that every one of these big companies needs a lifestyle or lifestyle adjacent game to keep like a player base in their orbit and monetize them forever, and Destiny might be the perfect storm of that kind of game for this.

157
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's successful and big, but not

158
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:03,675
Speaker 1: mega big, it's just kind of like

159
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:04,197
Speaker 0: regular big,

160
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:14,008
Speaker 1: and it's kind of like take a loot shooter like Borderlands, but also make it kind of an MMO, like that's sort of what Destiny is, if I tried to describe it to someone,

161
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:22,622
Speaker 0: yeah, I never played it, but I always got the feeling it was a bit Helldivers-y, where there's like a plot, but you know, that's, there's something like that,

162
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:46,046
Speaker 1: yep, so that's, I never played it, it's the magic circle of you, you have all these attributes, you have a bunch of lore that a certain set of your players will care about, a bunch of PvE or cooperative type content, which a good chunk of your players will care about, a competitive aspect so you can keep those people in your orbit, a way to sell hats, and leveling up in progression and stateful stuff to keep people there forever.

163
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:53,447
Speaker 1: The people I know who play Destiny play primarily Destiny to the exclusion of everything else.

164
00:15:53,468 --> 00:15:54,692
Speaker 1: Yeah,

165
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,520
Speaker 0: I mean that's, you know, the kind of game that is

166
00:15:56,801 --> 00:16:20,622
Speaker 1: exactly that kind of game, this doesn't superboat, the worst thing is the games industry just in the last like couple months has consolidated to a degree above and beyond the trends that were happening up to that point, but we've hit a sort of balance of power, I think, with this acquisition in that the balance of power among the major players has remained relatively constant by these acquisitions.

167
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:32,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get that, you know, the anti-trust people generally feel like as long as you're not a monopoly of one, they'll let biopolies, or in this case, triopoly, they'll

168
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:39,928
Speaker 1: also let monopolies exist if there's no evidence that they're exploiting the market, which I think is a terrible loophole that should be removed.

169
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:47,842
Speaker 0: But as long as there's still separation between Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, it's like regulators aren't going to understand that Nintendo is actually separate.

170
00:16:47,862 --> 00:16:50,532
Speaker 0: Nintendo sort of has a monopoly, right?

171
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:56,471
Speaker 0: If you consider their market to not be the same market as, you know, Microsoft, Sony, and then...

172
00:16:56,792 --> 00:17:09,759
Speaker 1: And these games don't directly compete with each other, but there's no way to explain that to a regulator, and the nuance there is that would not survive even the briefest interaction with the United States Congress, let alone the FTC.

173
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:19,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, and plus the language of the law was written for, you know, train and oil companies, right, which bears no resemblance to the modern world.

174
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:28,668
Speaker 1: Yep, because the real problem is more that there are companies that have so much power and dominance that they can control the narrative conversation and ecosystem around games.

175
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:34,708
Speaker 1: Even though they don't have a monopoly, gamers can choose among three large companies for their primary game.

176
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:47,643
Speaker 1: So it'll be interesting to see what comes of this, because Destiny probably could be a lot bigger with the right marketing and the right investment.

177
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:48,527
Speaker 0: I don't know.

178
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:52,364
Speaker 0: They might just be hiring them for the... It is an extremely talented team.

179
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:57,952
Speaker 0: They might just have them create some... Because PlayStation, you know, they need some exclusives to make you buy a PlayStation.

180
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:59,300
Speaker 0: They might just have them make some games.

181
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:13,347
Speaker 0: And, you know, we already heard the news that they decided that at least the next number of Call of Duties are still going to be cross-platform, or at least, you know, Sony said they were confident in, you know, so at least the next few, right?

182
00:18:13,768 --> 00:18:22,353
Speaker 0: But who's to say that whatever they make Bungie make next or whatever they are making now won't be PlayStation exclusive?

183
00:18:22,975 --> 00:18:25,644
Speaker 1: So there's one thing that's interesting here...

184
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:30,022
Speaker 0: Because Microsoft is okay with games at least going to cross-platform on PC.

185
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:35,900
Speaker 0: Sony, you know, has some PC stuff, right, like that God of War thing just came out, right?

186
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:46,395
Speaker 0: But, you know, for the most part they only let that happen way after and some games never because that's the only reason to buy a PlayStation is if they have exclusive titles.

187
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:53,000
Speaker 0: So, whereas Microsoft is okay with stuff going on PC because that PC runs Windows, so they're okay with that.

188
00:18:54,481 --> 00:19:00,626
Speaker 1: Several articles about this from like The Verge and other places, they do point out that Fortnite seems to be a big part of what drove this.

189
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:11,559
Speaker 1: And one thing that I just looked up and confirmed, if you look at the top 10 games played on PlayStation 5s, Fortnite is number one.

190
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,443
Speaker 0: Yes, Fortnite, far away.

191
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:17,377
Speaker 0: On every iOS, yep, probably iOS, probably Switch, probably PC.

192
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,194
Speaker 1: And Fortnite captures a really, really lucrative demographic.

193
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:34,804
Speaker 1: Fortnite is almost like sitting in between Roblox/Minecraft on one side and Destiny, Borderlands, Overwatch-type games on the other side, like Destiny.

194
00:19:34,905 --> 00:19:35,447
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

195
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:37,496
Speaker 0: Destiny sits in that middle sweet spot there.

196
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:38,079
Speaker 0: Exactly.

197
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:44,920
Speaker 1: So, Fortnite is so powerful that Sony seems to want to court the right side of that ecosystem.

198
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can't, I guess Epic is the one they can't buy, right?

199
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,341
Speaker 1: Yep.

200
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:52,656
Speaker 1: Granted, if they somehow... Nor is Valve.

201
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,220
Speaker 1: Yep.

202
00:19:54,682 --> 00:20:01,307
Speaker 1: Valve remains the, not a dark, Valve is just sort of invincible because of the structure of the company, like...

203
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:03,099
Speaker 0: I don't know.

204
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:03,640
Speaker 1: Yep.

205
00:20:03,741 --> 00:20:07,664
Speaker 1: Valve is invincible for a bunch of reasons that you can probably intuit, we've talked about on the show.

206
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:11,020
Speaker 1: There's another huge news, which is yet another big acquisition.

207
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:21,940
Speaker 1: Wertle, the game that took web browsers and the internet and Twitter by storm, has been bought by the New York Times for what appears to be a seven-figure deal.

208
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,447
Speaker 0: No, that's good for that guy.

209
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:28,260
Speaker 0: He made a webpage with a clever, well-designed game.

210
00:20:28,802 --> 00:20:29,946
Speaker 0: It's a static page.

211
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:32,716
Speaker 0: He served it up and then waited a long time.

212
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:35,868
Speaker 0: It got discovered and he made seven figures.

213
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,859
Speaker 1: He said in a press release quote, "In the low seven

214
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:39,180
Speaker 1: figures.".

215
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,703
Speaker 0: Yeah.

216
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,371
Speaker 0: You made at least a million dollars, right?

217
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:42,933
Speaker 0: Some millions.

218
00:20:43,214 --> 00:20:44,480
Speaker 0: It's like, that's the nerd dream.

219
00:20:45,281 --> 00:20:46,730
Speaker 0: That's my dream as well.

220
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:47,374
Speaker 0: Congrats.

221
00:20:47,656 --> 00:20:48,280
Speaker 0: Congrats, dude.

222
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,761
Speaker 1: Yes.

223
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:55,466
Speaker 1: If any corporation wants to spend the low... Look, for the low seven figures, you've got a simple game.

224
00:20:55,928 --> 00:21:00,648
Speaker 1: For the low seven figures, we can offer you an entire goddamn podcast.

225
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:01,739
Speaker 0: That's right.

226
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:14,835
Speaker 1: But it's fascinating here because Wertle, well, there's a few things going on, but Wertle is trivially cloned because game mechanics are not copyrightable.

227
00:21:15,136 --> 00:21:15,759
Speaker 1: You could make a game.

228
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,225
Speaker 0: There are many clones.

229
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:21,685
Speaker 0: There was a big fiasco with clones on the App Store, some of which are still there.

230
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:26,180
Speaker 1: Many of those were taken down only because they used language.

231
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,219
Speaker 0: I went to the App Store, there's still some there and they're highly ranked too.

232
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,319
Speaker 1: But the ones that got taken down were the ones that could be confused for the real Wertle.

233
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,588
Speaker 1: It was about trademark, not about game mechanics.

234
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:40,545
Speaker 1: Because game mechanics are just fundamentally not copyrightable at all.

235
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:48,740
Speaker 1: So we could make a game and call it unlicensed free word game, and it's just Wertle and free and not owned by the New York Times.

236
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:49,821
Speaker 0: Sure.

237
00:21:50,584 --> 00:22:02,243
Speaker 1: So the other thing that a lot of you need to realize, we talk about this kind of often, it comes up on gig nights, but at least every few months, the New York Times has a significant games division.

238
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:03,306
Speaker 0: Yep.

239
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,251
Speaker 0: So especially for puzzles.

240
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:05,772
Speaker 0: Yes.

241
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:08,178
Speaker 0: So which are talking nerds, right?

242
00:22:08,739 --> 00:22:09,402
Speaker 0: So they have.

243
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:12,054
Speaker 0: they have the crossword puzzle is the biggest, right?

244
00:22:12,114 --> 00:22:16,572
Speaker 0: They have all the crossword, the best crossword makers in the world are working for them.

245
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:17,074
Speaker 0: Right.

246
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:20,146
Speaker 1: And before any of you think, how hard is that?

247
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:22,596
Speaker 1: Like we thought we did a whole show on crossword puzzles.

248
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,102
Speaker 1: That is some of the hardest.

249
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,832
Speaker 0: crossword puzzles have to be handcrafted and authored.

250
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:27,194
Speaker 0: Right.

251
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:32,753
Speaker 0: But the New York Times also has some machine generated, some hand authored puzzles.

252
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:37,997
Speaker 0: They've got their little spelling bee game, which is actually really fun, but I'm not going to pay money to play.

253
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,426
Speaker 0: I've just played it for like the free demo once in a while.

254
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,209
Speaker 0: They've got their Sudoku's, I think are machine generated and not that great, but you know, whatever.

255
00:22:47,229 --> 00:22:50,861
Speaker 0: Uh, they've got like their, what's the chess puzzle, right?

256
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:53,291
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the move to win here, whatever.

257
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,263
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't know if the jumble still exists.

258
00:22:56,726 --> 00:23:09,261
Speaker 0: Wasn't it, you know, the jumble, which always has a funny little, I don't know if they own that either, but someone, I think that syndicated the jumble by someone else, but regardless, there is a New York Times official crossword app, which is a really good app by the way.

259
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:20,582
Speaker 0: Um, and if you install it on your phone or tablet, then you can do a mini crossword every day, but if you don't do it within 24 hours, it goes away and they give you a different mini crossword.

260
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:25,077
Speaker 0: So you get a tiny crossword every day that literally takes like a minute to do.

261
00:23:25,097 --> 00:23:27,748
Speaker 0: And if you want to do anything else, you got to pay money.

262
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:30,420
Speaker 0: If you get a subscription, you can do everything.

263
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:33,651
Speaker 0: There are over a million people with that subscription.

264
00:23:33,832 --> 00:23:34,896
Speaker 0: It is a big deal.

265
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:36,904
Speaker 0: So you have a million subscribers.

266
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:37,888
Speaker 0: You don't need to work, right?

267
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:38,290
Speaker 0: You're good.

268
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:43,995
Speaker 1: So obviously Wordle is like exactly the kind of game that fits into the New York Times ecosystem.

269
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:52,965
Speaker 1: So you might be asking yourself, why did the New York Times pay low seven figure sum for a game they could have just cloned with zero consequences.

270
00:23:53,587 --> 00:23:57,320
Speaker 1: They are buying the eyeballs of people who are playing Wordle today.

271
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,331
Speaker 1: I am confident Wordle will remain free forever.

272
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,861
Speaker 1: There is no way they would put that behind the paywall.

273
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:12,789
Speaker 0: Maybe, but regardless, they definitely are going to leverage the popularity of Wordle to try to boost their game subscribers in some way.

274
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

275
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,906
Speaker 0: What that way is remains to be seen, but they're going to do it.

276
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:18,549
Speaker 1: Yeah.

277
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:23,090
Speaker 1: Well, couple that with what we talked about before where New York Times bought the athletic, which we pay for.

278
00:24:23,532 --> 00:24:26,142
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll end up with a New York Times subscription anyway.

279
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:35,784
Speaker 0: I mean, if there's a subscription that gets me the games and I think I said this when we did that news, if there's one subscription that gets me the athletic and the puzzles, I would probably pay for it.

280
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:36,146
Speaker 1: Yep.

281
00:24:36,286 --> 00:24:38,518
Speaker 1: The New York Times itself just comes along for the ride.

282
00:24:38,598 --> 00:24:41,931
Speaker 0: Like, oh, the price they're charging for the puzzles alone.

283
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:53,076
Speaker 0: The last time I looked was not worth it to me, especially since my recent ish thing of the day, cracking the cryptic YouTube channel, plus their discord server, you know, with their, their high level Sudoku's.

284
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:54,863
Speaker 0: the pencil puzzles, right?

285
00:24:54,903 --> 00:25:04,533
Speaker 0: And the whole puzzle internet community with the puzzles that they are hand crafting, that are mostly free are like unbelievable.

286
00:25:04,553 --> 00:25:06,299
Speaker 0: There's no reason for you to go.

287
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,192
Speaker 0: If you're looking to do that kind of puzzle, you don't need the New York Times.

288
00:25:09,353 --> 00:25:13,352
Speaker 0: And then you could even get into the cracking the cryptic Patreon, right?

289
00:25:13,372 --> 00:25:16,324
Speaker 0: They didn't pay me to tell you this, you know, you just Patreon them.

290
00:25:16,826 --> 00:25:21,864
Speaker 0: And I think that's a better deal than New York Times, uh, puzzles, I guess, unless you want to do crosswords.

291
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:32,918
Speaker 0: Uh, but I think, you know, I would say crosswords are better than regular Sudoku, but they're not better than the handcrafted, you know, next level Sudoku's.

292
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:37,941
Speaker 1: So, so I learned something just now about the bungee acquisition that I think we want to step back to briefly.

293
00:25:37,962 --> 00:25:48,240
Speaker 1: Uh, the D there's a bunch of talk about how the deal is actually kind of unusual, uh, bungee, like formally will maintain complete creative independence and operate independently.

294
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:49,542
Speaker 1: Okay.

295
00:25:49,743 --> 00:25:56,786
Speaker 0: Even self publishing was probably like, we know how you so many, you know, companies like to work, right?

296
00:25:56,946 --> 00:26:06,080
Speaker 1: You know, and it's honestly, that's smart because much like wordle, if something's doing a really good job, the worst thing you can do is buy it and then fuck with it.

297
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:11,156
Speaker 1: That is how so many cool things get destroyed when big companies buy them.

298
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:21,437
Speaker 1: And it seems like I suspect that both Microsoft and Sony with their relative acquisitions recently are going to be very careful to not ruin what was good about the companies and the IP they bought.

299
00:26:21,537 --> 00:26:21,718
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:27,362
Speaker 0: I mean, sometimes you do acquire something to shut it down because it's a competitor, but that's not this case.

301
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,427
Speaker 1: No, definitely not.

302
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:32,061
Speaker 1: I mean, wordle was not competing with the New York times puzzle section.

303
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,368
Speaker 1: Bungee was not competing with Sony.

304
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:34,428
Speaker 1: No.

305
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:38,379
Speaker 0: Well, it's bungee was competing with Sony.

306
00:26:38,619 --> 00:26:45,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not in a, not in a way that was going to impact the specific game that Sony had that destiny was rubbing up against.

307
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:46,107
Speaker 0: Yeah.

308
00:26:46,127 --> 00:26:49,821
Speaker 1: You're just competing with Sony Fortnite, which runs on Sony platforms.

309
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:50,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

310
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:58,048
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

311
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:05,406
Speaker 1: So, uh, on my birthday this year, a video got uploaded and, uh, I noticed it and I watched it and it's 34 minutes long.

312
00:27:06,027 --> 00:27:11,872
Speaker 1: I encourage you to watch the whole thing, even if you feel like this might be a boring topic, because I already know this information.

313
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:17,976
Speaker 1: You may know this information, but it makes an interesting argument, uh, not an argument, but sorry, it frames it a different way.

314
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:50,169
Speaker 1: It's titled the unreasonable effectiveness of JPEG and on one hand, it explains in very understandable, but very technically correct detail how JPEG works, the compression algorithm for images, but it frames it pointing out the fact that the reason things like JPEG and MPEG and a lot of our modern, uh, algorithms for compression work is that it's really signal processing that an image is basically just a

315
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:57,334
Speaker 0: signal, signal processing is just a, you know, a different way to, of mathematically modeling, right?

316
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,805
Speaker 0: The same, you know, it's like, what's it, what's it?

317
00:27:59,825 --> 00:28:03,018
Speaker 0: you, you, you hook up to your, even though if you're USB, right.

318
00:28:03,118 --> 00:28:05,508
Speaker 0: Is it is a digital signal, right?

319
00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:08,356
Speaker 0: You hook, you hook up your oscilloscope, right?

320
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:22,630
Speaker 0: It's like you could, instead of using binary logic to examine, you know, whatever data is coming down your USB cable, you could treat it as signal processing and process it in a different, you know, it's, that's how computers are.

321
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,738
Speaker 0: Everything is signal processing in the real world.

322
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:26,326
Speaker 0: Things boil a different model.

323
00:28:26,506 --> 00:28:26,728
Speaker 1: Yep.

324
00:28:26,768 --> 00:28:27,672
Speaker 1: Things boil down to.

325
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:39,878
Speaker 1: basically, you can make a big equation that will generate a signal that is analogous to the real thing you're trying to model, but much simpler and takes the end with much less space needed to convey this information.

326
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:46,463
Speaker 0: And mostly the reason, I mean, if you think about it, you know, it's like, look at back in the day, you VHS tape, right?

327
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:52,607
Speaker 0: You know, if you put, you know, VHS tape quality, even if you turn as super VHS and turn it all the way up, right.

328
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:58,870
Speaker 0: It, you know, it's just recording an analog signal from the radio waves in the sky to a VHS tape, right?

329
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:06,160
Speaker 0: They're pretty much directly, uh, and then it's going to play them back off of that magnetic tape to your TV as go in the antenna hole.

330
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,253
Speaker 0: So the TV thinks like basically that's what was being broadcast, right?

331
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:34,145
Speaker 0: So you, the quality you get on a VHS tape with that analog recording, you know, it's not great, but if you were to make a digital compression of like, you know, even the best H two six, whatever MPF, FM peg you've got, and try to save that to a VHS tape as a magnetic digital device, that's going to be so much worse.

332
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:40,505
Speaker 1: So think about the analog recording video on a VHS tape could not be stored on that medium in a digital form.

333
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:41,809
Speaker 1: Think about that.

334
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,800
Speaker 1: Really think about what's gotcha said, right?

335
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:51,165
Speaker 0: Because I mean, well, cause you know, if you have the signal, right, you know, an analog signal has lots of values, right?

336
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:53,635
Speaker 0: You know, so if you look at it, it's a sine wave, right?

337
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:54,721
Speaker 0: It's bendy, right?

338
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:59,320
Speaker 0: You know, and if it's in, if it's in between zero and one, that still has some meaning, right?

339
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:04,440
Speaker 0: When you have a digital signal, only the five volt and the zero volt of any meeting, right?

340
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,729
Speaker 0: Everything else is just timings, right?

341
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:10,865
Speaker 0: You're ignoring everything in between your clock cycles, basically, right?

342
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,290
Speaker 0: All that information is wasted.

343
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,416
Speaker 0: Whereas analog signal, right?

344
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:19,932
Speaker 0: The whole signal is used every, you know, whatever, I guess it's in infinite.

345
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:24,872
Speaker 0: I don't know how far you can zoom in, you know, with one unit of time, there's no such thing.

346
00:30:24,912 --> 00:30:26,761
Speaker 1: Yes, there is actually with the Planck's constant.

347
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:30,397
Speaker 1: There is a minimum unit of time and a minimum unit of interaction in the universe.

348
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:35,174
Speaker 0: All right, so one Planck's constant of time is the resolution, right?

349
00:30:35,194 --> 00:30:41,737
Speaker 0: You know, it's like every, you chop up the analog signal into that small of, you know, segments, right?

350
00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:44,728
Speaker 0: You're using the whole magnetic tape, right?

351
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:45,872
Speaker 0: You know, every single piece of it.

352
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:56,358
Speaker 1: This is also why, like, one thing you could say is that the fast Fourier transformation, like the ability to do quick math and Fourier transformations is probably more important than most other digital technologies we've come up with.

353
00:30:57,744 --> 00:31:05,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's pretty much, like, you know, the most important, you know, one of the most important maths that's been, you know, invented.

354
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,678
Speaker 1: See, I put this on a Tuesday because...

355
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:09,748
Speaker 0: In terms of, like, practical usage, right?

356
00:31:09,808 --> 00:31:17,418
Speaker 0: And every actually gets used to do things in your everyday life, but you don't know what's there, as opposed to fancier maths that are just...

357
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:25,811
Speaker 1: Well, case in point, a lot of what I'm doing right now to record and then later upload Geek Nights involves that technology, or would not happen the way it happens today.

358
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:40,302
Speaker 0: Yep, the audition that's recording my voice and the software that's sending our voices over the internet to each other is all doing plenty of fast Fourier transforms, so are probably the hardware devices and the mixers and all that kind of stuff.

359
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:43,013
Speaker 0: They're all doing that same math in various ways.

360
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:57,828
Speaker 1: I also learned something as a result of this video, that there's two different entropy encodings that could be used for JPEG, and one of them, the arithmetic one, is far superior, like, it's better in every way, but IBM had a patent on it, and as a result nobody ever used it.

361
00:32:00,371 --> 00:32:00,812
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

362
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,496
Speaker 1: I assume a cool gaming thing.

363
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:21,151
Speaker 0: Yeah, so somebody out there decided to take the map, the overworld map of Zelda 1, a map that I have memorized in my brain down to almost the pixel level, at least in the first quest, and they recreated the entire map in Legos, including the enemies.

364
00:32:21,893 --> 00:32:25,643
Speaker 0: It took them 25,000 Lego pieces.

365
00:32:25,864 --> 00:32:35,592
Speaker 0: It's enormous, and there's a YouTube video where basically they pan a camera over it so you can examine all of it in very closely and see their their handiwork.

366
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:43,736
Speaker 0: It's not, like, incredible, amazing, like, the result, because it's really not a high resolution thing that they replicated.

367
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:48,833
Speaker 1: But when you zoom out, like, the zoomed out view, it looks pretty great.

368
00:32:49,615 --> 00:32:55,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also they, uh, I think just the effort involved, right, could you imagine sitting there doing this?

369
00:32:55,955 --> 00:33:09,459
Speaker 0: Especially, like, some of the details they put in, like, they clearly made, like, a base layer and then a water layer, and then you could see, because, like, the lakes are inset, so, like, all the land is on top of lakes, right?

370
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,622
Speaker 0: And then the trees are, so the verticalness of it, um, clearly had a lot of work and thought and planning going into it.

371
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:19,132
Speaker 0: So, uh, I don't know where they're putting this.

372
00:33:19,513 --> 00:33:23,328
Speaker 0: I certainly don't have room for it in my apartment, but, uh, good job.

373
00:33:23,388 --> 00:33:25,195
Speaker 1: It was, like, they immediately just took it down.

374
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:26,501
Speaker 1: They took it apart as soon as it was done.

375
00:33:26,521 --> 00:33:29,253
Speaker 0: Oh, after they made the YouTube video, yeah.

376
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:34,372
Speaker 1: I imagine it was very sort of soothing and fun as an activity to just work on this every day.

377
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:44,719
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, which I, uh, we should be doing our episode on it on, uh, Thursday in two days.

378
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,143
Speaker 1: Whoa.

379
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,208
Speaker 1: It's, uh, we've hit the end.

380
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:50,617
Speaker 0: Our first of, our first of maybe a couple few episodes.

381
00:33:50,657 --> 00:33:53,106
Speaker 1: Yep, we'll do at least two episodes, I think.

382
00:33:53,467 --> 00:34:04,989
Speaker 1: I think on Thursday we're just gonna react to the book as a book, because I have to read some more history and, no, I wouldn't even say brush up on, but learn more about the Heian Era.

383
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:15,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, I don't need, I'm gonna feel like, you know, if we're gonna talk about the meta of it, I'm not gonna, like, research the history more than what, like, I've already just happened to find out, like, mostly

384
00:34:15,212 --> 00:34:18,909
Speaker 1: I want to react to, like, what I learned as a result of reading this book.

385
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:25,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, but, you know, there clearly are lots of meta things to discuss even without studying them.

386
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:31,561
Speaker 0: If you actually care about, like, the actual, there are people who, like, research this for a living, you can just go read what they wrote.

387
00:34:31,601 --> 00:34:39,067
Speaker 0: There's no reason for me to either, you know, be wrong or read what they wrote and regurgitate it to you.

388
00:34:39,127 --> 00:34:41,496
Speaker 1: But I guess we'll react to the book as a waste of time.

389
00:34:41,516 --> 00:34:45,533
Speaker 1: We'll react to the book as a book for the first episode, and then the other episode.

390
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:56,232
Speaker 1: we'll talk about, like, the meta around it and, like, how it, how, like, we interpreted and experienced it compared to other novels and, like, its place in history, etc.

391
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,559
Speaker 1: But I don't regret it.

392
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:06,007
Speaker 1: I feel like the, honestly, Covid is what made it take so long because I didn't read much of anything for, like, that first year in quarantine.

393
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:09,298
Speaker 0: It was a, it was a big conflagration of factors.

394
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:10,402
Speaker 1: Lots of factors.

395
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:24,357
Speaker 0: You know, but now, you know, like I said, much like baseball players who swing the heavy bat and then to make the other bat feel lighter, even though that doesn't actually work, the next book club book that we are going to do, I'm 80% done with.

396
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:31,204
Speaker 1: Yep, and I imagine, I didn't start reading it yet because I was, I'm 80% done with a book club, unannounced book club book.

397
00:35:31,264 --> 00:35:34,074
Speaker 1: But I feel like it'll be a real fast read for a lot of reasons.

398
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:39,893
Speaker 0: That's how fast I can read when a book is written, uh, modernly, I guess is the word.

399
00:35:42,081 --> 00:35:43,224
Speaker 0: A contemporary novel.

400
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:46,236
Speaker 1: I don't have to look at a footnote to remember who someone is.

401
00:35:46,256 --> 00:35:49,570
Speaker 1: And even then, I forget again by, like, two pages later.

402
00:35:50,751 --> 00:35:50,951
Speaker 0: Yep.

403
00:35:51,934 --> 00:35:52,456
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah.

404
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:54,442
Speaker 1: Otherwise, no real cons coming up.

405
00:35:54,763 --> 00:36:03,230
Speaker 1: I'm putting in some panels for PAX East, but the odds that we will go to PAX East to actually play games in PAX are basically near zero.

406
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:05,173
Speaker 0: Pretty low.

407
00:36:05,313 --> 00:36:07,923
Speaker 0: The most likely- Not zero, but it's low.

408
00:36:07,943 --> 00:36:15,835
Speaker 1: The most likely situation is either myself or me and Scott will go for, like, one day to do some panels and hang out, but that's the extent of it.

409
00:36:16,377 --> 00:36:19,070
Speaker 1: There's no way I'm at PAX East for more than one day in April.

410
00:36:22,011 --> 00:36:22,534
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

411
00:36:22,554 --> 00:36:22,915
Speaker 0: Who knows?

412
00:36:23,136 --> 00:36:23,880
Speaker 1: We'll see how it goes.

413
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:33,195
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we really got nothing going except a bunch of, uh, side projects, uh, working on some non-convention panels still that, uh, might just- Making a new Geek Nights website.

414
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:39,457
Speaker 0: It's coming along, uh, you know, at a pace that is, uh, much better than it was previously.

415
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:43,230
Speaker 0: I'm getting held up a lot trying to make the RSS feeds real.

416
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:46,089
Speaker 1: I'm also playing a lot of Fortnite lately.

417
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,763
Speaker 0: I probably would be if I didn't have to install the Epic Store.

418
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,270
Speaker 1: I mean, I had that same reservation.

419
00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:03,688
Speaker 1: I only have one game in the Epic Store and that is Fortnite, but, uh, I gotta say, uh, just before we get into the main bit, I liked PUBG when we were playing it, but- Yeah, it was okay.

420
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:05,838
Speaker 0: When we played it, I enjoyed it for a couple years ago.

421
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:10,280
Speaker 1: But now I played Fortnite a bunch, and the other day- Quite a few years ago, actually.

422
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:25,570
Speaker 1: A bunch of us went to just play PUBG, and, uh, trying to play PUBG after having played a significant amount of Fortnite is like trying to read an even more silted translation of the Tale of Genji, having just read a real book.

423
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,568
Speaker 0: I haven't even played Fortnite even once in my life, and I played PUBG years ago.

424
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:34,221
Speaker 0: At least, it had to be pre-pandemics with two or three, three plus years ago.

425
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:42,166
Speaker 0: And going back to PUBG now, it's like, not having played Fortnite even once, PUBG is just not great.

426
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:43,650
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of issues.

427
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, so having played- I can see why the player base really disintegrates.

428
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,935
Speaker 1: Having played Fortnite will amplify that by an order of magnitude, because everything that is slow and tedious about.

429
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,080
Speaker 1: PUBG is just erased from Fortnite.

430
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,008
Speaker 1: Like, nothing.

431
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:06,010
Speaker 1: At any point, you will never encounter something that's not worth interacting with in Fortnite.

432
00:38:07,792 --> 00:38:09,439
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we got right into it.

433
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,750
Speaker 1: Lifestyle games, like, uh, PUBG.

434
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,678
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, so what is a lifestyle game?

435
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:26,081
Speaker 0: So, you know, most, you know, people in their lives, uh, when they interact with games, you imagine that it's like, oh, you, you know, you have a game that you play over here, a game that you play over there, right?

436
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:30,177
Speaker 0: Maybe you even have a game that you play every single day.

437
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:33,071
Speaker 0: Like, maybe you have a phone game that you have to check in on every morning.

438
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:36,023
Speaker 1: Like Whirl, I play every morning before I do a work meeting.

439
00:38:36,806 --> 00:38:37,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

440
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,421
Speaker 0: Or, like, I play a tower defense every morning.

441
00:38:39,441 --> 00:38:42,779
Speaker 1: Or, like, in the evening before I go to bed, I often play one Slay the Spire.

442
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:45,150
Speaker 1: Like, I just play one Slay the Spire, and then I go to bed.

443
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,719
Speaker 0: Right, but that's not really a lifestyle game.

444
00:38:48,739 --> 00:39:05,413
Speaker 0: A lifestyle game is a game in which you don't necessarily have to play it every day, but you probably are, or playing it most days, but it's a game which not only, you know, you're playing it a lot, but it suddenly occupies a place in your life.

445
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:10,067
Speaker 0: Like, it becomes a part of your daily existence, right?

446
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:13,597
Speaker 0: Like, you're now in communities for that game.

447
00:39:13,838 --> 00:39:23,351
Speaker 0: You're thinking about the game when you're, and the game is constantly, you know, refreshing and adding things and bringing you back and giving you a reason, right?

448
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,038
Speaker 0: So, examples of lifestyle games.

449
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,886
Speaker 0: Something like Magic the Gathering, right?

450
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:30,200
Speaker 0: You're going, you're hanging out with people who play Magic.

451
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,190
Speaker 0: That's not, it's part of your social existence.

452
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,119
Speaker 1: Now, that last bit is not necessarily true, though.

453
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:39,245
Speaker 1: For example, Counter-Strike 1 6, I would argue, is, for a lot of people, a lifestyle game.

454
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:40,170
Speaker 1: That game isn't updating.

455
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:46,571
Speaker 0: Right, well, Magic could be a lifestyle game for one person and not for another person, right?

456
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:59,772
Speaker 0: You could play Magic in a way such that it is not your lifestyle, but it is definitely marketed and sold and pushed in a way to where they're trying to get that lifestyle customer, right?

457
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:04,406
Speaker 0: A part of their recreational life is, like, centered around Magic.

458
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:07,035
Speaker 0: You're paying attention to the competitive scene.

459
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:09,103
Speaker 0: You're perhaps even trying to compete.

460
00:40:09,384 --> 00:40:11,612
Speaker 0: You're spending a lot of money on it frequently.

461
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:13,821
Speaker 0: You're following it in the news.

462
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:15,587
Speaker 0: You've got, like, Magic news sites.

463
00:40:15,607 --> 00:40:20,745
Speaker 0: You're listening to Magic podcasts or, you know, watching Magic YouTube channels, right?

464
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:26,082
Speaker 1: Like, I'd say the archetypical example of a lifestyle game is chess.

465
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:26,805
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft.

466
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:28,470
Speaker 0: Chess is also chess.

467
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,114
Speaker 1: I, like, I play chess.

468
00:40:30,134 --> 00:40:30,917
Speaker 1: Scott's played chess.

469
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,022
Speaker 1: We all know how to play chess.

470
00:40:32,443 --> 00:40:35,336
Speaker 1: I'm not great at chess, but I'll play it.

471
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:35,938
Speaker 0: I'm awful.

472
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:41,097
Speaker 1: But, like, I would play a game of chess here and there, uh, but, uh, I'd rather play the Duke.

473
00:40:41,418 --> 00:40:45,410
Speaker 1: I don't know, nor am I interested in my ELO rating in chess.

474
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,419
Speaker 0: Like, I- Mine- I know mine is near the bottom.

475
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:52,410
Speaker 0: I'm sure- Not the absolute bottom, but way down.

476
00:40:52,470 --> 00:41:04,716
Speaker 0: There are definitely people I can beat in chess, but people who have played more than, like- Yeah, I can beat people who don't know how to play chess or, and people who, like, have never studied anything about chess.

477
00:41:05,077 --> 00:41:05,700
Speaker 0: I will beat them.

478
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,312
Speaker 0: The last time we played a game of chess- One opening, I'm gonna lose.

479
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:16,082
Speaker 1: The last time we played a game of chess, you beat me, and that was at the Brickhouse Pizza Place in Beacon in the waiting room.

480
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:18,088
Speaker 0: Let's, let's play a game of online chess.

481
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:19,674
Speaker 1: I would play a game of online chess with you.

482
00:41:19,694 --> 00:41:21,179
Speaker 0: I, uh- Just once.

483
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:31,175
Speaker 1: Since then, I'd actually- No looking up online, no looking up openings or getting- Well, well, so, so, uh, no from this point, because I memorized a couple openings a few years ago.

484
00:41:31,195 --> 00:41:32,920
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

485
00:41:33,221 --> 00:41:37,476
Speaker 0: I've never, I've never- I, I heard about names of openings, but I don't know any of them.

486
00:41:37,516 --> 00:41:49,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, uh, I actually, when I play chess, if I ever play it, uh, I always start with a Polish opening, because I learned that one many years ago, and it's extremely effective against novices.

487
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:58,314
Speaker 0: All right, well, you're not allowed to look up what the Polish opening is to confirm whether you're- Nope, nope, I'm going based on the, what I remember the Polish opening to be.

488
00:41:59,398 --> 00:41:59,779
Speaker 0: Okay.

489
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,949
Speaker 1: Which roughly, well, I'm gonna save it as a surprise now.

490
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,961
Speaker 1: Yeah, neither one of us can read anything about chess until we play this game.

491
00:42:06,202 --> 00:42:06,704
Speaker 1: That's the rule.

492
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,519
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, at least- You know what we should do?

493
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:09,901
Speaker 1: Anyway.

494
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:12,875
Speaker 1: Total aside, we'll pick a day, let's just live stream us playing that chess game.

495
00:42:13,738 --> 00:42:14,340
Speaker 1: That could be fun.

496
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,701
Speaker 0: Whatever.

497
00:42:15,705 --> 00:42:18,715
Speaker 0: We could make that- Some chess person, tell us what chess apt is.

498
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:24,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us, tell us the best way for the two of us to play a live streamed single game of chess.

499
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:27,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, bad chess, real bad.

500
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:32,983
Speaker 1: Like chess so bad, you're gonna- Yeah, any of you who know chess are gonna really be disappointed.

501
00:42:33,365 --> 00:42:38,443
Speaker 0: I'm gonna play it the same way I play every other perfect information abstract game.

502
00:42:38,483 --> 00:42:50,632
Speaker 1: Generally, the way I play chess, I'm real bad until there's so few pieces that I can actually predict how it's gonna go and then- My heuristic is gonna be make a move that costs me the least number of dudes and maybe kills rims-deeks.

503
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:53,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, my goal is get in Scott's grill and hope that he makes a mistake.

504
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:55,456
Speaker 1: Like, that's how I play chess.

505
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:57,330
Speaker 0: Maybe try to upgrade a pawn, that would be sick.

506
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:02,030
Speaker 1: My main goal is never let the other person upgrade a pawn no matter what.

507
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:04,719
Speaker 0: Well, this is not happening.

508
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:10,650
Speaker 1: So yeah, we do not play chess as a lifestyle game, but you know what games I have played as lifestyle games in the course of my life?

509
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:11,531
Speaker 1: Magic.

510
00:43:12,133 --> 00:43:14,943
Speaker 1: When I played Magic, I played it as a lifestyle game.

511
00:43:15,064 --> 00:43:23,329
Speaker 1: I was so deep into Magic, it was like- I was thinking about Magic for like 30% of my waking hours when I played Magic.

512
00:43:25,051 --> 00:43:29,427
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike, I tried to get legitimately good at Counter-Strike.

513
00:43:29,447 --> 00:43:31,293
Speaker 1: I played Counter-Strike so much.

514
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,740
Speaker 1: In retrospect, it's embarrassing.

515
00:43:34,582 --> 00:43:37,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Magic, was it a lifestyle game?

516
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:46,242
Speaker 0: It was sort of borderline because I think it would have been if I had the greater ability to go to more tournaments and get more community involvement.

517
00:43:46,544 --> 00:43:50,983
Speaker 0: I was only playing it with kids I knew, but it was basically- Oh, I went to tournaments.

518
00:43:51,023 --> 00:43:52,470
Speaker 1: I played in a lot of tournaments.

519
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,393
Speaker 0: Right, I went to one.

520
00:43:54,474 --> 00:43:55,557
Speaker 0: I was talking about it.

521
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:57,824
Speaker 0: I was reading magazines.

522
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,389
Speaker 0: I was buying books.

523
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:00,834
Speaker 0: I was buying cards.

524
00:44:00,934 --> 00:44:05,890
Speaker 1: I was making decks and playing matches against myself to test those decks out.

525
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:13,290
Speaker 0: It was like one of my primary activities for the one to three years that I was involved.

526
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:23,105
Speaker 1: Now, what's interesting is that I think I've noticed most of the discourse about lifestyle games, everybody talks about ortho games almost exclusively.

527
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:32,814
Speaker 0: Well, because a game that has a competitive scene has a much greater ability to become a lifestyle game because it gives people a reason to go.

528
00:44:32,854 --> 00:44:37,289
Speaker 0: So, you think about most professional sports, they're all lifestyle games, right?

529
00:44:37,309 --> 00:44:40,236
Speaker 0: So, someone who's playing tennis, right?

530
00:44:40,317 --> 00:44:43,506
Speaker 0: It's got a ranking and everything, right?

531
00:44:43,566 --> 00:44:50,290
Speaker 0: If there wasn't a competitive scene around tennis, it would be much harder for it to be a lifestyle game.

532
00:44:50,370 --> 00:45:03,225
Speaker 1: I would argue that Civilization could not have been a lifestyle game until the era of streaming because now there's this weird adjacent place where there are people who play a game exclusively and deeply, but they're live streaming and trying to break things.

533
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:14,946
Speaker 1: There's this whole universe of people who have basically forced Civilization 6 to be a lifestyle game despite not playing it competitively at any point, but that's kind of an edge case driven by streaming.

534
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:21,067
Speaker 1: I think we want to focus on ortho games, but two, most tabletop games are incapable.

535
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:24,056
Speaker 0: Tabletop RPGs are usually the one.

536
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:28,008
Speaker 0: The Lizards in Dark Places is a lifestyle game for a lot of people.

537
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:29,152
Speaker 1: D&D is a lifestyle game.

538
00:45:29,273 --> 00:45:31,842
Speaker 1: It was a lifestyle game for me for a long time.

539
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,710
Speaker 0: That's what I just said.

540
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's because of that human element.

541
00:45:37,399 --> 00:45:51,515
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, on the other side, most tabletop board games could never be a lifestyle game because the space of competition solidifies into a perfect meta if you actually play them a lot.

542
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:55,588
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, the game space is too small.

543
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,052
Speaker 0: There's not enough replay value.

544
00:45:57,092 --> 00:46:05,879
Speaker 0: No one will ever have a better scene, and not only that, the game needs to have some sort of life to it, right?

545
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,245
Speaker 0: Some sort of evolution, right?

546
00:46:07,325 --> 00:46:16,153
Speaker 1: Or it has to have so much depth that it doesn't... Counter-Strike 1.6, the cap on skill is infinite in a game like that, effectively.

547
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:22,476
Speaker 0: Right, that's why tennis doesn't really need to change because people get old, and the skill cap is infinite.

548
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:26,571
Speaker 0: You can always run faster, hit the ball harder, hit the ball trickier, right?

549
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:27,233
Speaker 0: There's no limit.

550
00:46:27,393 --> 00:46:36,484
Speaker 0: The human body is the only limit, but for something like, you know, Carcassonne, it's like they could keep putting out more expansions.

551
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,151
Speaker 0: A lot of them are competitively viable.

552
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:46,381
Speaker 0: That really hurts, but it's like, you know, it's like there's only so much Carcassonne can give before you've exhausted all of it.

553
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:59,303
Speaker 0: There's nothing more to see there, and there's not enough social... It's like, even if you have a community built up around it, if it doesn't evolve, it's not a deep enough game like chess or tennis.

554
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:02,393
Speaker 0: There's nothing else to be said or discuss.

555
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:04,683
Speaker 0: You've arrived at the answer to Carcassonne.

556
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:12,468
Speaker 0: It's just going to be random tile draws and seat position that determines who wins any game, and the game doesn't die.

557
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:26,030
Speaker 0: It just can't sustain like somebody's, you know, being someone's primary interest in their recreational life that they're like so devoted to Carcassonne that, you know, it defines them as a human being.

558
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,085
Speaker 0: It just ends up being a fun game to play now and then, which is fine.

559
00:47:29,105 --> 00:47:30,633
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be a lifestyle game.

560
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:40,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when I think about it, like, I think there are a lot of different reasons why people, certain kinds of people, gravitate to certain kinds of lifestyle games at different points in their lives.

561
00:47:41,477 --> 00:47:59,610
Speaker 1: For me, the main reason, like the lifestyle games, just thinking about all the ones that achieve that for me, were either a role-playing game type thing or they were a competitive game I was good enough at to experience flow state reliably when I play it.

562
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:11,365
Speaker 1: Like games that I am not good enough to get to to ever experience flow state don't really do that for me, but like Overwatch, Counter-Strike, all the FPSs I'm pretty good at.

563
00:48:11,385 --> 00:48:17,726
Speaker 1: I just feel like it's almost like soothing to the brain to play a game that I understand well.

564
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:25,111
Speaker 1: I don't need to learn anything new other than get better at this thing, and I'm playing like within a universe that I know.

565
00:48:25,172 --> 00:48:26,195
Speaker 1: There's people that I know.

566
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,760
Speaker 1: There's spaces that I know.

567
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,590
Speaker 1: It's just, it's a fun social thing.

568
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,655
Speaker 1: that's very easy to see.

569
00:48:31,715 --> 00:48:35,471
Speaker 1: why someone could take a game like Overwatch and make it the only game they play.

570
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:41,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, the last game for me that was a lifestyle game was Netrunner, which was Lifestyle for several years.

571
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:46,852
Speaker 0: I started Netrunner because I saw it highly ranked on BoardGameGeek and I said, "What's that?

572
00:48:46,892 --> 00:48:47,515
Speaker 0: It's Cyberpunk.

573
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:49,203
Speaker 0: I guess I'll buy it and see what the deal is,".

574
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:52,742
Speaker 0: and then I found out, "Oh, it's one of those, it's just what I always wanted.

575
00:48:52,803 --> 00:48:55,616
Speaker 0: It's a collectible card game, but you have to collect and buy all the cards,".

576
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:58,006
Speaker 0: and then I found a community.

577
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:02,760
Speaker 0: Once I had the community, it's like, "Well, now I'm hanging with these people.

578
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,566
Speaker 0: We're competing,".

579
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:12,030
Speaker 0: and it was really nice to be able to play a game against people who understood the rules, were trying to win.

580
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,552
Speaker 0: You could play fast.

581
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:17,018
Speaker 0: You could play repeatedly, and the game kept changing.

582
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:40,166
Speaker 0: It's like there's an social activity, the game itself, that I could spend a significant portion of my recreational time invested into it, and money also, and not have it get spent.

583
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,529
Speaker 0: It wouldn't run out.

584
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:42,351
Speaker 0: It kept giving.

585
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:46,442
Speaker 0: When I gave it, it gave back until it died.

586
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,188
Speaker 0: It's not technically dead now, but- But it's dead.

587
00:49:51,152 --> 00:49:57,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, they got the fan-run Project Nisei thing, which is really high quality, but it's not what it was before.

588
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:57,930
Speaker 1: No.

589
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:58,613
Speaker 1: Well, like PUBG.

590
00:49:58,673 --> 00:50:03,494
Speaker 1: PUBG distilled down to the people who have decided they will be there till the end.

591
00:50:05,164 --> 00:50:07,790
Speaker 0: But that social- We talked about what a lifestyle game is.

592
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:18,599
Speaker 1: But I guess that community part actually is so important because it also gives you an automatic social context in that you know everyone you're playing this game with can talk to you about the meta of the game.

593
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:22,969
Speaker 0: So we're talking about what a lifestyle game is, right?

594
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:31,540
Speaker 0: So why would you make a lifestyle game versus, if you're a game company, video game or tabletop, right, versus making a one-off game?

595
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:38,200
Speaker 1: Well, it's way cheaper to take a game that already exists and add stuff to it than it is to make a new game from nothing.

596
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,108
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know about that necessarily.

597
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:42,414
Speaker 0: I guess a video game, yes.

598
00:50:43,398 --> 00:50:45,667
Speaker 0: But you know, tabletop game, not necessarily.

599
00:50:45,707 --> 00:50:49,499
Speaker 0: Developing expansion, you know, printing materials is necessary.

600
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:55,079
Speaker 1: I think that's the reason why there are fewer lifestyle tabletop games that have succeeded long term.

601
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:05,178
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's because the tabletop ones, I think, is the only restriction that, you know, hurts them is that you need to have the people to play with in person, right?

602
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:06,919
Speaker 0: Because without the social aspect, it's done.

603
00:51:07,241 --> 00:51:13,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Imagine if Netrunner existed in a state where you could click a button and you're immediately matched with someone who's about your skill level.

604
00:51:14,201 --> 00:51:17,300
Speaker 0: They did, but the user interface was shitty and unofficial.

605
00:51:18,941 --> 00:51:19,664
Speaker 0: And it still exists.

606
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:24,482
Speaker 0: Anyway, but it's like you're a game company, you make a lifestyle game.

607
00:51:25,024 --> 00:51:37,156
Speaker 0: What you get is, you know, you think about if you're a single person who makes a game and puts it out there and it sells a pile of copies and it's like, okay, you got a pile of money, but it's not enough money to live the rest of your life, right?

608
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:38,884
Speaker 0: You need to make another game.

609
00:51:38,924 --> 00:51:40,130
Speaker 0: Well, that game might not be a hit.

610
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:42,481
Speaker 0: You're gambling each time you make a game.

611
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:50,100
Speaker 0: If you can make a lifestyle game and make it stick that and you can build your right, that game will build over time.

612
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:52,049
Speaker 0: Any other game is just going to go down.

613
00:51:52,089 --> 00:51:59,317
Speaker 0: Most sales will probably go down over time unless suddenly there's a new like renewed interest from somewhere, right?

614
00:51:59,357 --> 00:52:03,400
Speaker 0: Like settlers gets a renewed interest in it, you know, once in a while.

615
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:03,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

616
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:14,385
Speaker 1: People who play lifestyle games tend to evangelize the lifestyle games they play because they want more people to play it with them and they're desperately afraid it will die, right?

617
00:52:14,425 --> 00:52:33,500
Speaker 0: If you can create a game that is a lifestyle game, then as a, you know, as the person who makes and sells it, you can now live off of it more securely as it's a constant revenue stream and not just this one big blob of risk that you're going to repeat rolling the dice over and over again, hoping that you hit enough times to be able to pay your bills.

618
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:37,535
Speaker 0: If you can hit on a lifestyle game, then you're all set.

619
00:52:37,635 --> 00:52:46,931
Speaker 0: And if you fail on the lifestyle game, well, that initial first set you produced wasn't any bigger a risk than any other tabletop game that you would have failed on, right?

620
00:52:47,594 --> 00:52:53,395
Speaker 0: So you're better off rolling the dice with lifestyle games over and over until one hits.

621
00:52:53,496 --> 00:52:55,207
Speaker 0: And then you can make that your life, right?

622
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:55,938
Speaker 0: Running that game.

623
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:05,372
Speaker 1: So thinking more about when I played lifestyle games, it's, there's also this aspect, at feel like there's more I could get out of it.

624
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:14,027
Speaker 1: Anytime I hit a point in a game where I feel like there's nothing novel or different I could get out of it, or I feel like I could not get better reasonably.

625
00:53:14,087 --> 00:53:15,633
Speaker 1: Like there's nothing I would do differently.

626
00:53:15,653 --> 00:53:16,977
Speaker 1: I lose interest.

627
00:53:17,298 --> 00:53:23,502
Speaker 1: But like most of the lifestyle games I've played in my life were FPSs where the skill cap is literally infinite.

628
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:32,140
Speaker 1: And no matter how good I am and how good I feel like I'm playing, if I'm playing, I could win a game or lose a game and think I could have done that better.

629
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:34,820
Speaker 1: I could have learned something and done something differently.

630
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:35,941
Speaker 0: Right.

631
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:39,483
Speaker 0: Well, that's going to be just automatically true for any sport, period.

632
00:53:39,604 --> 00:53:41,239
Speaker 1: That's why a lot of sports are lifestyle games.

633
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:42,440
Speaker 0: Right.

634
00:53:42,461 --> 00:53:44,028
Speaker 0: The human body has no limit, right?

635
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:49,169
Speaker 0: But any, if it's not a sport like chess, it needs to be so incredibly deep, right?

636
00:53:49,530 --> 00:54:05,959
Speaker 1: I think there's also an aspect of if a game is sufficiently complex or difficult and you as a person have invested enough in it to reach basic proficiency, it feels like a waste if you don't use that proficiency.

637
00:54:05,979 --> 00:54:09,100
Speaker 1: Like, ah, I spent all this time to get decent to this game and then I just stop.

638
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:11,625
Speaker 0: Not necessarily.

639
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:15,108
Speaker 1: There's definitely a sunk cost for some people in like, I got good at this game.

640
00:54:15,129 --> 00:54:16,279
Speaker 1: I'm going to fucking play it now.

641
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,463
Speaker 0: Eh, sometimes.

642
00:54:18,584 --> 00:54:19,026
Speaker 0: Depends.

643
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:19,507
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:27,579
Speaker 0: I think the bigger thing to keep a lifestyle game going, you know, it's like, that's true that if a game does run out of depth, that it will end.

645
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,240
Speaker 0: And that's why the game set to keep changing and adding to themselves, uh, to keep it going.

646
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:37,380
Speaker 0: But I think more, what keeps the lifestyle game going is just the social aspect, right?

647
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,870
Speaker 0: It's like you could have a game that's deep as hell.

648
00:54:40,392 --> 00:54:45,696
Speaker 0: And if the social structure surrounding the game collapses, then that's going to be the end of it, right?

649
00:54:45,756 --> 00:54:52,283
Speaker 0: If someone plays magic, but their friends stop have suddenly have a different interest and aren't talking about magic anymore.

650
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:53,669
Speaker 0: That's it, right?

651
00:54:53,709 --> 00:55:05,237
Speaker 0: Unless that person finds new friends or goes to the game store or something, you know, if the game store has a, is running some tabletop RPG, and then they stop running it frequently or whatever, it's like, that's it.

652
00:55:05,277 --> 00:55:06,363
Speaker 0: That game is going to die.

653
00:55:06,684 --> 00:55:10,361
Speaker 0: Even if the publisher keeps publishing more stuff, that's really high quality.

654
00:55:10,381 --> 00:55:38,120
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you know, what, you know, net runner, even before the publisher, you know, I mean, they messed it up quite a few times in various ways, but what really killed it most was simply less people showing up to play it at the, you know, at the, at the meetings, it's like, you know, we had, we were having tournaments like twice a month with crowds showing up, you know, we had, we'd have store championships, people filling up every seat.

655
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:46,170
Speaker 0: And then later on, it's like, you'd have a meetup and there'd be like, you know, sometimes you'd show up and like, no one else would show up and you'd go home.

656
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:49,811
Speaker 0: And so maybe one person shows up, you play a couple of games and go home.

657
00:55:49,932 --> 00:55:55,379
Speaker 1: Well, just like in a video game, you go to the matchmaking and 10 minutes go by and it hasn't found you a match.

658
00:55:55,399 --> 00:55:57,686
Speaker 1: You're a little worried now.

659
00:55:57,706 --> 00:55:57,786
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,154
Speaker 0: It's not just about the game.

661
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:01,016
Speaker 0: You know, it's all.

662
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:07,520
Speaker 0: the social part of it is, you know, combined with the game, the game becomes, even if you suck at the game, right?

663
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,292
Speaker 0: You're still like involved in the community around it.

664
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:11,497
Speaker 0: You're following the game.

665
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:13,466
Speaker 0: You're into the game as your primary interest.

666
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,635
Speaker 0: And it's your connection to this community.

667
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:18,587
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, that can keep you going in it.

668
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:19,491
Speaker 0: Well, look at us.

669
00:56:19,552 --> 00:56:21,440
Speaker 1: Neither one of us ever got good at Counter-Strike.

670
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:29,796
Speaker 1: We were not great, but we played it a lot in college, but I feel like we wouldn't have played it if it weren't for the fact that so many people we knew were also playing it.

671
00:56:29,836 --> 00:56:35,298
Speaker 1: If I joined a server half the time, you and half our friends were there in the server playing with us.

672
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:46,340
Speaker 0: But I mean, we weren't hanging out in like Counter-Strike, you know, forums or no, like, you know, it wasn't that it didn't have that next level where Counter-Strike was the focus of your life.

673
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:49,932
Speaker 1: But we would play it every day and we did play it a lot.

674
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:54,090
Speaker 0: And when we were playing it a lot isn't enough to make it a lifestyle game.

675
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:54,311
Speaker 1: Yep.

676
00:56:54,351 --> 00:56:55,215
Speaker 1: Well, we were close to it.

677
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:57,665
Speaker 1: We were close to that in that it was part of our lifestyle.

678
00:56:57,685 --> 00:56:58,729
Speaker 1: We were playing it regularly.

679
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:02,764
Speaker 1: And also we would talk about it when we weren't playing it.

680
00:57:03,206 --> 00:57:07,001
Speaker 1: And I noticed as we talked about it, less that coincided with us playing it less.

681
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:11,520
Speaker 1: And that coincided with a few of us stopped playing Counter-Strike to play other games.

682
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:15,940
Speaker 1: And that sort of destroyed the broad interest among a lot of our friends in playing Counter-Strike.

683
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,098
Speaker 0: I even see Link to the Past Randomizer being a lifestyle game for a lot of people.

684
00:57:21,118 --> 00:57:21,480
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

685
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:22,381
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

686
00:57:22,421 --> 00:57:34,632
Speaker 0: And it's like they've got, you know, they have a competitive community, but yeah, a lot of people play it who are really, you know, not maybe not even as good as I am, but I see them and it's like they're up and they got a Discord, right?

687
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:35,456
Speaker 0: The Discord is huge.

688
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:36,721
Speaker 0: How many people are in that Discord?

689
00:57:36,741 --> 00:57:37,142
Speaker 0: Let me see.

690
00:57:37,182 --> 00:57:37,523
Speaker 0: Hold on.

691
00:57:38,164 --> 00:57:40,749
Speaker 0: There are, get out of the way.

692
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:43,916
Speaker 0: Eleven.

693
00:57:45,338 --> 00:57:45,679
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

694
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:46,602
Speaker 0: They have so many rolls.

695
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:51,400
Speaker 0: Eight, eight, over 8,000 people have the Discord for Link to the Past Randomizer, right?

696
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,632
Speaker 0: And like that community, you know, they keep it going.

697
00:57:54,652 --> 00:57:57,843
Speaker 0: They have daily races, weekly races, right?

698
00:57:57,863 --> 00:58:02,900
Speaker 0: There's streaming, there's spectating, there's new modes, there's new people working on tools.

699
00:58:03,462 --> 00:58:06,193
Speaker 0: There's so many different ways to come at the game.

700
00:58:06,273 --> 00:58:07,297
Speaker 1: And it's self-fulfilling.

701
00:58:07,478 --> 00:58:15,989
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people would not play Randomizers as much if there wasn't the culture of you can share it, you can play it with other people, you can talk about it.

702
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:16,311
Speaker 1: Yeah.

703
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:20,950
Speaker 0: They got races, they got, you know, it's like there's different ways to play it.

704
00:58:21,452 --> 00:58:33,940
Speaker 0: And you can also, you know, you can come into that community and be like, you could, you could be a, like a, you know, like a sportscaster for it, where you just, you know, that's what your, that's your involvement in the community.

705
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:41,666
Speaker 0: But now you're still in that sort of lifestyle game space, even if you're not, you know, the champ or trying to be the champ.

706
00:58:43,352 --> 00:58:51,081
Speaker 0: Some people aren't any good at it, or some people are good at the stream, you know, non-competitively, but people like their stream because they're a streamer, right?

707
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:52,387
Speaker 0: They want to watch them, whatever.

708
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:55,624
Speaker 1: I do think too, a lot of people speedrun it, some people don't.

709
00:58:56,047 --> 00:59:00,407
Speaker 1: A lot of people get into lifestyle games, partly because like, it's a game that they play every day.

710
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:04,483
Speaker 1: And for most people, they don't play a lot of different kinds of games.

711
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:12,583
Speaker 1: Like we're like, the people who play a lot of different games from a lot of different genres across a lot of different platforms and media are relatively rare in the gaming world.

712
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:17,467
Speaker 1: We did a big panel about this at PAX many years ago, like why it's so hard to find anyone to play the game you want to play with.

713
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:29,048
Speaker 1: But if you play the same game long enough, most people will have a few hobbies and that game becomes a hobby, just like any other hobby, just like woodworking or something else.

714
00:59:29,088 --> 00:59:31,862
Speaker 1: It becomes the thing they do when they get home from work.

715
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:40,520
Speaker 1: Even if they don't engage that much with the community, it's still sort of a lifestyle game in that they come home, they play two hours of Counter-Strike, then they go about their life.

716
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:47,901
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, if you're a person who plays a lot of different games, right?

717
00:59:48,705 --> 00:59:53,526
Speaker 0: I mean, you look at us, we come after work, we're like, what game should we play tonight, and we can't even pick one.

718
00:59:53,586 --> 01:00:02,207
Speaker 1: Like one night I play Fortnite, the next night I'm reading Tale of Genji, the night after that I'm playing Overwatch by myself, the night after that we're playing Civilization 6 competitively in a group.

719
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:30,290
Speaker 0: Right, it's like if we had a lifestyle game that we are all in the community of, right, and like focusing on it, you know, if I'd gotten any of you people to play Netrunner instead of the other people I met, but I guess it was good, I met a lot of good people playing it, you know, then it's like we could have just gone, you know, we would just be playing, it wouldn't be any question like what game do we play, it's like there's one game and we're playing it, right, that's our game.

720
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:34,420
Speaker 1: It would be the situation where I'm cutting class, I'm like, hey Scott, when are you coming back, I'm playing Counter-Strike.

721
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:54,330
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's, you know, I think the main question, I think, is like if you have a lifestyle game, it's like what percentage of your life do you end up dedicating to it, and then when you look back on your life as a whole, do you regret?

722
01:00:54,451 --> 01:01:05,212
Speaker 0: It's like I played Netrunner for a handful of years, right, but if it had gone on several years longer, like if I was still playing it, I think it was mostly, you know, last decade, right, you know, earlier.

723
01:01:05,232 --> 01:01:13,776
Speaker 1: Well, like if I was still playing Counter-Strike 1.6 literally every day, either I'm a pro or that is my only hobby.

724
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:24,377
Speaker 0: Right, but like if I was still playing Netrunner as much as I did back then, all the way up until this point, it's like when I look back as an old man, it's like what's my obituary gonna be, played Netrunner?

725
01:01:24,477 --> 01:01:40,091
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like even if you don't think that that's, that's not an unhealthy activity, it's not a wrong way to spend your time, you know, there's nothing wrong with playing, you know, if you some MMO, you just play it a whole bunch, but you

726
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:42,963
Speaker 1: might have missed out on something, like think about as

727
01:01:43,003 --> 01:02:07,393
Speaker 0: long as it doesn't, you know, if it's not hurting other parts of your life, you know, you're eating, your hygiene's okay, you're not neglecting your responsibilities, right, you know, whatever, you know, there's nothing wrong with playing a game a lot, but will you have a regret when you only are going to be alive for so long, will you have a regret looking back on your life as a whole and being like, wow, I spent like 10% of my life only playing Game

728
01:02:07,614 --> 01:02:07,754
Speaker 1: X,

729
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:12,188
Speaker 0: was that the life, you know, that was my life, I can't live it again.

730
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:12,951
Speaker 0: Or you

731
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:28,894
Speaker 1: can get a very myopic view where say you don't regret it, like you love Magic, you played Magic, like that was the only game you played your whole life, like great, like you, you look back on your deathbed and you think, fuck yeah, no regrets, maybe you missed out on a slightly different game.

732
01:02:28,914 --> 01:03:05,624
Speaker 1: that would have given you a much broader perspective on games or things as a result, even if you have zero regrets about it, like when I talk to people, like I know some people who pretty much just like Magic is the only game they play, and that's fine, like they have other hobbies outside of gaming, but the only game they play is Magic, but it's interesting that they tend to have extremely limited opinions on games generally, and any game conversation they really can only express or talk about it through the lens of Magic, the only game they play.

733
01:03:06,327 --> 01:03:32,129
Speaker 0: That is definitely a danger with a lifestyle game is that if you are most, a lot of people, like you said, who play a lifestyle game probably have not played a lot of games in total, and yeah, their perspective gets very warped and limited to where that one game that is their lifestyle game becomes the lens through which they view all other games, right, and that can be, that can be dangerous.

734
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:35,902
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that is how you get things like last hitting in MOBAs.

735
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:37,867
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

736
01:03:40,713 --> 01:03:42,959
