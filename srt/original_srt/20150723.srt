Speaker 1: Why is that an opening bit?

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:49,280

00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,573
Speaker 0: So uh last night for about 30 seconds.

11
00:00:57,216 --> 00:00:58,440
Speaker 0: I thought I was dying.

12
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:00,698
Speaker 1: Don't you think that pretty often?

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,180
Speaker 1: How about that time in RIT when like you couldn't breathe because your throat was allergies or whatever?

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,264
Speaker 0: I didn't think I was dying.

15
00:01:06,345 --> 00:01:08,474
Speaker 0: I just thought that really really sucks.

16
00:01:08,494 --> 00:01:09,960
Speaker 1: What about the time we had Lyme disease?

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,832
Speaker 0: Uh that time I thought I was dying.

18
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:12,599
Speaker 0: that was the other time.

19
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,634
Speaker 0: That of course that time I remember what about a time something went through your leg.

20
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:19,280
Speaker 0: I didn't think I was dying.

21
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:22,094
Speaker 0: I just thought this is gonna hurt like a motherfucker when I go to the doctor.

22
00:01:22,114 --> 00:01:25,825
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Actually didn't cuz they don't me up.

23
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:32,859
Speaker 1: What about that time you got a rocket to the face, uh Never actually gotten a rocket to the face.

24
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,272
Speaker 0: No Bottle rocket hit me in the shoulder one time.

25
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,709
Speaker 0: We played quake you got Face, I believe the wrong thing.

26
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:40,232
Speaker 1: You died.

27
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:41,820
Speaker 0: I believe they're kind of dramatic.

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,394
Speaker 1: They're bits of you all over the place primarily hitting you and they're not called bits.

29
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:46,157
Speaker 0: They're called Gibbs.

30
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:49,069
Speaker 1: understand So you definitely died whatever.

31
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,119
Speaker 1: at the time you jump tried to jump over that hole and fell in.

32
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,224
Speaker 0: So I'm laying in bed.

33
00:01:53,264 --> 00:02:01,876
Speaker 0: No sleep, and I wake up and Just one like the typical like you fell asleep in a weird way.

34
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,580
Speaker 0: your arm fell asleep.

35
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:04,325
Speaker 0: Both my arms were numb.

36
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,809
Speaker 0: I've had that and my neck hurt.

37
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:11,706
Speaker 0: So I'm like, uh, and I kind of like wiggle my shoulders My arms just like yeah, I've had that.

38
00:02:11,807 --> 00:02:16,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and my neck is like feels thick and heavy and I'm like am I having a stroke?

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:28,726
Speaker 0: No, I lay there for a second stroke feels like and then and then like two or three seconds later My brain like the rest of the brain wakes up and says ah, dude Think about how you're laying.

40
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:37,240
Speaker 0: and basically I was laying with like one arm behind My neck like holding my head back and my other arm was like crossed underneath it.

41
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,751
Speaker 0: I had tied myself in a knot and cut off circulation of my arms.

42
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:43,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's have it any once or twice.

43
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:55,783
Speaker 0: Yep But it was interesting as part of my but you know The the lower part of the brain wakes up and says yo dog emergency time and then the rest of the brain says yeah You're just a moron Stan you're back if that happens to me I'm just.

44
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:58,380
Speaker 1: I'm just like I've never thought I was dying when that happened.

45
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,025
Speaker 1: I was just like fuck.

46
00:03:00,165 --> 00:03:08,154
Speaker 1: and then I basically like wobble my torso to flap the arms around like What angel is that that has the paper arms?

47
00:03:08,576 --> 00:03:13,720
Speaker 0: Oh Not milk Don't remember the name, you know the ones up?

48
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:17,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and then I just you know They just wobble around until they start working again.

49
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:28,170
Speaker 1: And it's kind of fun because like your arm is sort of like a dead piece of meat you can sort of grab it like if a one arm is working you can sort of grab the dead arm and like Flap it at things like like it's a club.

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,179
Speaker 0: Usually it's one arm that goes.

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,150
Speaker 0: Sham's shell is this guy with the flappy.

52
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:34,853
Speaker 1: Yes that guy.

53
00:03:34,873 --> 00:03:35,034
Speaker 0: Yep.

54
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:40,752
Speaker 0: Sham shell with the weird head Anthropod like angel with deadly quote whips of light.

00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:42,900
Speaker 1: I'm watching I'm not your home.

56
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,680
Speaker 1: Why would I watch anything else when there's such a good show?

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,620
Speaker 0: Well, that's the problem of all things in life.

58
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,860
Speaker 0: And this is like, I don't know if it just happens when you get older and you've seen a lot of stuff.

59
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:58,779
Speaker 0: But I could spend a month like if I was locked like I couldn't go outside because the weather was bad.

Speaker 0: That's not in the manga or the remake.

87
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,956
Speaker 0: It's only in the anime.

88
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,895
Speaker 0: Oh Interesting same with the big spider one that they catch the strip in the acid.

89
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:09,780
Speaker 1: I've seen the spider one.

90
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:16,379
Speaker 0: It's only in the anime, okay Yeah, so the anime has the most the only one that's in the end.

91
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:17,926
Speaker 0: That's not in the anime.

92
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:19,473
Speaker 1: had more monster of the week going on.

93
00:05:19,594 --> 00:05:22,465
Speaker 1: Yeah more monsters for the weeks All right.

94
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:24,774
Speaker 0: This article is getting complicated quickly.

95
00:05:24,854 --> 00:05:26,219
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna pass that on.

96
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,460
Speaker 0: Read this wiki I do have a news.

97
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:39,800
Speaker 0: so when I worked at IBM and all those places before Like there's this weird culture in American companies where people don't talk about their salaries and also among friends.

98
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:43,310
Speaker 0: There's a weird social culture where people don't talk.

99
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,920
Speaker 1: I mean, I said, I mean, it's an American and also other certain countries.

100
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:56,264
Speaker 1: I mean there are countries where it's not a thing but most cultures on earth I think where people have jobs that pay money the culture is not to discuss Salaries.

101
00:05:56,305 --> 00:06:07,310
Speaker 1: now people might feel bad Like if you tell them, you know It's like if you find out someone who's like new just got hired is making more than you who's been there for five years You know, it's gonna cause dry.

102
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:11,066
Speaker 1: It's just people want to avoid drama So they don't tell anyone.

103
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:19,473
Speaker 0: but at the same time I feel like both of those factors combined Hurts a lot of people who are way underpaid for the work.

104
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:27,774
Speaker 1: Yes this this culture absolutely favors companies and Employers and fucks employees.

105
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:48,860
Speaker 1: if you're an employee Even though you're worried that there might be drama with other employees if you share your salaries with each other You have no one's be mad at except your employer and your employer is the one who is happy that you are not sharing that Information because then they would have to pay a lot more money or people would quit and they'd have to hire someone else.

106
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:52,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, and since all the information is public they're gonna have to pay that person more money.

107
00:06:52,220 --> 00:07:03,779
Speaker 1: Anyway, now a lot of super big bureaucratic companies is why unions are awesome And people who are in unions even today what unions aren't strong as they used to be Still get more stuff than people aren't in unions.

108
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:12,989
Speaker 0: So, uh, like big corporate bureaucratic companies sometimes especially if they're super bureaucracies Like if you know someone's band or level or whatever.

109
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,524
Speaker 0: like people know what the salaries are within a range and bonuses are sometimes public Yeah, and government work.

110
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:21,172
Speaker 1: Someone's an executive like a public company.

111
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:22,897
Speaker 1: This thing is public, you know, everyone knows.

112
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,948
Speaker 0: like government military It's like what government rank are you?

113
00:07:26,048 --> 00:07:29,040
Speaker 0: Well, I know exactly how much money you make and how many vacation days you get.

114
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, because there's some structure to it.

115
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,272
Speaker 0: So when I worked at a company, I want to say which one.

116
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:38,319
Speaker 0: just because one day I was sitting around and a guy was bitching about his salary and I was like, wow

117
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,728
Speaker 1: I've never actually heard anyone bitch about he

118
00:07:40,768 --> 00:07:46,074
Speaker 0: was he was just pissed off in general because he'd been doing like all this night work He didn't want to be doing and I was

119
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:46,879
Speaker 1: like just say no.

120
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,808
Speaker 0: So I was just like how much do they pay you?

121
00:07:48,828 --> 00:07:49,752
Speaker 0: and he's like.

122
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:55,531
Speaker 0: he says a number and I said He's like what.

123
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:59,556
Speaker 0: and I'm like, yeah I make like 20 grand more than that and I do way less work than you.

124
00:07:59,857 --> 00:08:00,440
Speaker 0: and he was like what?

125
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:02,867
Speaker 0: Fuck this and he quit that week.

126
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:03,308
Speaker 1: Fuck.

127
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:03,629
Speaker 1: Yeah.

128
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:03,990
Speaker 0: Yeah.

129
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:04,712
Speaker 0: Yeah.

130
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:05,574
Speaker 0: I hope he did.

131
00:08:05,594 --> 00:08:05,875
Speaker 0: Well.

132
00:08:06,136 --> 00:08:07,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go good, dude.

133
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:18,193
Speaker 0: so when I worked for a broker-dealer in the finance world like Money was well, that was the company where one I Got a really low salary because I didn't know.

134
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:23,194
Speaker 0: I asked for like 70k Because I thought that was you know, a lot of money back then and they were like, yeah.

135
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:28,234
Speaker 0: Yes, we will pay you that Sure, and if only later did they be like, okay.

136
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:33,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna take advantage of you But we're only later not immediately because they're still jerks.

137
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:36,837
Speaker 0: They waited until my my you know, quote-unquote probation, which was 30 days.

138
00:08:37,842 --> 00:08:40,355
Speaker 0: So I worked for 30 days and then they gave me like a 30k race.

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,025
Speaker 0: so, uh One day years later.

140
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:51,707
Speaker 0: We're all like my team's all sitting around in the office and we'd been just kind of annoyed and bored for a While we'd all been thinking about quitting.

141
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:55,944
Speaker 0: So the guy who quit soon after that was like, yeah so I'm probably gonna quit soon.

142
00:08:55,964 --> 00:09:13,679
Speaker 0: and then we just started talking openly about our salaries and bonuses and everything and once we realized who all got paid what it explained a lot and We pretty much all quit Like all of us everyone within a few months of that.

143
00:09:14,642 --> 00:09:20,118
Speaker 0: So the news is that a bunch of Google employees shared their salaries with each other.

144
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:20,680
Speaker 0: They're smart.

145
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,677
Speaker 1: they would figure this sort of thing out wouldn't they?

146
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:24,043
Speaker 0: and They.

147
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,627
Speaker 0: basically it's just.

148
00:09:24,687 --> 00:09:26,700
Speaker 0: it's like when you're playing but I mean you work at Google.

149
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,289
Speaker 1: You're probably you're a developer and not the security mature.

150
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,256
Speaker 1: I'm sure even the security guard gets paid nicely.

151
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:33,103
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're Google You're making money.

152
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:37,600
Speaker 1: You shouldn't really have anything to be upset or have drama about if you reveal your salary to someone else.

153
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:43,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time Companies even Google it appears pay as little as they can get away with.

154
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:45,385
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't they?

155
00:09:45,426 --> 00:09:46,631
Speaker 1: they're a for-profit company?

156
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:47,615
Speaker 1: That's why unions are good.

157
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're in one.

158
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:54,857
Speaker 0: So apparently Google's management actually flipped out about this and there's a whole drama thread.

159
00:09:54,897 --> 00:09:56,020
Speaker 0: you can read all this stuff.

160
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaker 1: You can't stop you from talking.

161
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:57,882
Speaker 1: There's no love.

162
00:09:58,123 --> 00:10:00,353
Speaker 0: so a lot of company fire them if you want.

163
00:10:00,393 --> 00:10:02,039
Speaker 1: you can do that for any reason.

164
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:03,829
Speaker 0: Uh, it depends on the state actually.

165
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,131
Speaker 1: Sure.

166
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:07,474
Speaker 1: I don't know what California is up to but So they could fire you if they wanted to.

167
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:18,340
Speaker 0: well It depends because a lot of companies more recently like in the last decade Part of your employment agreement because usually there's some kind of NDA like I won't release company secrets or whatever.

168
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:23,415
Speaker 0: They actually cover your compensation Under that would challenge that shit in court.

169
00:10:23,435 --> 00:10:24,340
Speaker 1: be like you can't do that.

170
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:34,292
Speaker 0: I have had stock options and equity in companies in my life that I was not actually legally allowed to disclose Unless I was exercising them.

171
00:10:34,312 --> 00:10:35,015
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

172
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:38,006
Speaker 0: So This is a complicated issue.

173
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:48,443
Speaker 0: All I want to say is I urge all of you out there to Be open about your salaries with your at least your friends Like.

174
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:51,540
Speaker 0: I know friend drama money can often be a problem.

175
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:55,422
Speaker 1: But I mean even even if you you know It's like come on Like.

176
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:59,660
Speaker 1: I haven't discussed all our salaries and exact numbers with all my friends.

177
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:03,840
Speaker 1: They know how much everyone knows who's making more money than other people, right?

178
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,883
Speaker 1: Who makes more money?

179
00:11:04,903 --> 00:11:09,945
Speaker 1: the rim the rim working in the fight in the finance company in New York City right.

180
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,943
Speaker 1: or the art teacher in The sticks.

181
00:11:14,063 --> 00:11:14,585
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

182
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:15,969
Speaker 1: It's not a secret.

183
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:26,282
Speaker 0: We all know the Scott who flew to Pax Australia for the fuck of it Or the other friends who stopped going to the PAX East because they can really only afford one con a year and they go to Magpies, right?

184
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:27,365
Speaker 1: It's like we know this.

185
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:28,588
Speaker 1: it doesn't.

186
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:35,949
Speaker 1: no one's feelings are gonna be hurt by the truth that everybody knows if they are hurt By just pure knowledge.

187
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:42,180
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about I mean if they're not hurt with the general knowledge If they're hurt by the numb they're hurt when you reveal the numbers.

188
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:45,720
Speaker 1: Why weren't they hurt before when they knew already but didn't know an exact?

189
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,240
Speaker 0: Oh, of course, if you use those numbers to be a dick, you're like I make seven times your salary.

190
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,539
Speaker 1: Then why are you friends with them in the first?

191
00:11:56,901 --> 00:12:17,580
Speaker 0: So, but what I urge you is if you have friends who work in your industry I would suggest Sharing your salaries with each other because odds are one of you is getting ripped the fuck off And knowing what all your friends are being paid in your industry can do nothing but benefit workers.

192
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:22,004
Speaker 0: And frankly workers are the only people that matter Labor.

193
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:22,104
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:24,631
Speaker 0: Well, even though labor is actually not valuable anymore.

195
00:12:24,651 --> 00:12:34,919
Speaker 0: I've recently arguing at length with people that Communism as a concept is failed not socialism, but communism was destroyed by modernity.

196
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:41,540
Speaker 0: Like well, I guess post modernity industrialization in the sense that labor is actually not that valuable anymore.

197
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,420
Speaker 0: Nope, like the workers are not the means of production capital and technology are the means of production.

198
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, the tech worker is always that picture of all the workers right holding up the big plate with all the big fat.

199
00:12:54,061 --> 00:12:58,600
Speaker 0: They're all right, they're all next to the computer that has one person typing at it exactly.

200
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,820
Speaker 1: It's like we could all let go of the plate and it would float on money and rock.

201
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,760
Speaker 0: So seriously guys like I'm curious actually because I have said my salary on geek nights Many times in the past like a number.

202
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:18,139
Speaker 1: Only reason I don't say my exact number because I actually don't fucking know.

203
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,190
Speaker 1: Yeah I started with a number that I don't even remember.

204
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,009
Speaker 1: that was just slightly more than what I had in my last company and Then I got a raise every single year.

205
00:13:26,331 --> 00:13:27,456
Speaker 1: See I don't get like.

206
00:13:27,596 --> 00:13:28,460
Speaker 1: that's like a percent.

207
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,093
Speaker 1: That's like one and a half or five.

208
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:30,920
Speaker 1: I think was was it five?

209
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,931
Speaker 1: I can't even know if it's one and a half or five percent.

210
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:36,720
Speaker 0: See I don't get raises, but I get complicated compensation.

211
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,360
Speaker 1: Mine's really straightforward.

212
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:45,467
Speaker 1: but there's been a raise like every year and it actually sort of happens frequently like my boss just like oh By the way, you got a raise.

213
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:54,446
Speaker 1: I got you the most raise you're allowed to get and it's like Okay That seems like this happened yesterday and it seems like it happens pretty often But I don't ask for it.

214
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:55,210
Speaker 1: It just happens.

215
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,199
Speaker 1: No, I don't know the actual number.

216
00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:12,067
Speaker 1: now I know the amount of money that I get in a that goes into my checking account but that is nowhere near the salary that I have if I multiply it by 24 because I get it twice a month because They're taking so much stuff out.

217
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:13,433
Speaker 1: The taxes are coming out.

218
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,020
Speaker 1: The health care is coming out.

219
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:19,200
Speaker 1: The 401k is a large is like 15 percent or something that's coming out.

220
00:14:19,702 --> 00:14:24,020
Speaker 1: So it's like I don't do a lot of math to figure out the exact number or ask HR which I really don't care.

221
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:28,073
Speaker 0: yeah, but uh Yeah, it's just an interesting thing.

222
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:33,282
Speaker 0: We'll see if this Story continues into any meaningful Dialogues.

223
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:33,807
Speaker 1: Yeah.

224
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:35,199
Speaker 1: So what did Google do to these employees?

225
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,046
Speaker 0: Nothing, there's just a big drama right now.

226
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:39,109
Speaker 1: I deal with it.

227
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:42,480
Speaker 1: So in a money related issue as well, right?

228
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,779
Speaker 1: We've talked a lot and geek nights about ads and how Internet ads are fake and it's a big scam or whatever, you know.

229
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:55,531
Speaker 1: But this guy he wrote this really short thing Called why you will never escape ads by paying for content, right?

230
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:58,400
Speaker 1: Cuz we're always like, oh you pay for Netflix.

231
00:14:58,501 --> 00:14:59,612
Speaker 1: Why should I have to see ads?

232
00:14:59,653 --> 00:15:00,300
Speaker 1: I'm paying for Hulu.

233
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,524
Speaker 1: why should I have to see ads.

234
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:05,256
Speaker 1: and he brings up a point that is common sense once you hear it.

235
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:09,992
Speaker 1: and But I had never thought of it exactly in quite this way.

236
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:15,147
Speaker 1: and the thing is advertisers They want people to see ads right?

237
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:15,629
Speaker 1: Yep.

238
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,680
Speaker 1: Who do they want to see ads?

239
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:25,118
Speaker 0: Ideally people who are either dumb or who are likely to become customers of their thing.

240
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,099
Speaker 1: Mmm That is incorrect.

241
00:15:27,601 --> 00:15:33,860
Speaker 1: According to him people who are buying ads want people who have money to see their ads.

242
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:41,991
Speaker 1: someone who can afford to pay to make ads go away is Somebody who has fucking money and he can buy shit.

243
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:42,874
Speaker 0: god damn it.

244
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,420
Speaker 1: So you want god damn it.

245
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:46,828
Speaker 0: Think of it from this angle, right?

246
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,400
Speaker 1: So the more you are willing to pay to keep ads away.

247
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:51,645
Speaker 1: So think about it.

248
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:54,455
Speaker 1: Let's say you charged a hundred dollars a month to have no ad.

249
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,519
Speaker 1: Netflix, right?

250
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,005
Speaker 1: Advertisers are gonna be like, holy fuck.

251
00:15:58,407 --> 00:16:01,980
Speaker 1: There's a group of people who can afford a hundred bucks a month to not see ads.

252
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:03,840
Speaker 0: I'll be I'll be a thousand bucks.

253
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:08,914
Speaker 1: Pay so much money to have my ads target only those people.

254
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:17,380
Speaker 1: the more ads The more people will pay to keep ads away the more advertisers will pay to show ads to specifically that group of people.

255
00:16:18,321 --> 00:16:23,600
Speaker 1: So this is why you cannot pay to make ads go away because the more that you pay to make ads go away.

256
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:35,060
Speaker 1: Suddenly Netflix is there with like a car company telling them we will give you a five million dollars to let us advertise to the paying Customers who are paying a hundred bucks a month and Netflix has to be like, uh, do we just say no to like five million?

257
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,491
Speaker 1: Dollars for nothing.

258
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:37,359
Speaker 1: It's a hard choice.

259
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:42,673
Speaker 0: Well, I mean as noted Hulu even if you pay still has ads.

260
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,961
Speaker 1: and then this guy also refers to another article that I haven't Read.

261
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,132
Speaker 1: it's is actually a three paragraph deal, right?

262
00:16:48,213 --> 00:16:48,554
Speaker 1: But it's just.

263
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,459
Speaker 1: the point is so good.

264
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:53,371
Speaker 1: He says consider the recent opinion piece by Thomas Wells.

265
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:55,337
Speaker 1: is advertising morally justifiable.

266
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:59,571
Speaker 0: I read that article By Thomas.

267
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:03,392
Speaker 1: well, so You know read this three paragraphs pretty much.

268
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:05,420
Speaker 1: I already told you everything the three paragraphs have to say.

269
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,126
Speaker 1: But then read the other one.

270
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:09,093
Speaker 1: is advertising morally justifiable?

271
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,909
Speaker 1: perhaps in the future quote I mean quote.

272
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:19,140
Speaker 1: perhaps in the future It will be just as illegal to broadcast this type of material as it is to mass distribute malware because that's what advertising is.

273
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:19,959
Speaker 1: It's brain malware.

274
00:17:20,602 --> 00:17:25,599
Speaker 0: So there was another article that I'm not going to talk about in depth because I kind of want to talk about this on Monday.

275
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:52,020
Speaker 0: smartphone apps a bunch of them have been collecting 850 million dollars in fraudulent revenue by Hosting ads not displaying the ads but just lying and saying people saw the ads there's a good, you know, we already know that like a huge percentage of all ad Clicks and ad views just pretty much across the board are fake either from botnets or whatever.

276
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:57,282
Speaker 0: And that's not even counting all the ads that don't get shown because of ad block It.

277
00:17:58,008 --> 00:17:59,420
Speaker 0: it might actually be way higher than that.

278
00:17:59,641 --> 00:18:05,199
Speaker 0: I would push that estimate up to 70 80 percent and this is just even more evidence for that.

279
00:18:05,864 --> 00:18:13,155
Speaker 0: So advertising is a big circle jerk scam Independent of the even more disturbing concept that you brought up that I hadn't thought of until just now.

280
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:13,657
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

281
00:18:14,078 --> 00:18:14,640
Speaker 0: Also was a kid.

282
00:18:15,821 --> 00:18:19,593
Speaker 0: We had cable way early and we had HBO from old satellite dish way early.

283
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:27,632
Speaker 1: there weren't ads back then Like there were not HBO's deal pay for the content and not no ads.

284
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is why he has a lot of money.

285
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,938
Speaker 0: But then we got cable and cable showed movies and had all these channels and there weren't ads.

286
00:18:36,018 --> 00:18:37,884
Speaker 0: when we first had Cable was new.

287
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:38,646
Speaker 1: It didn't have ads.

288
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:39,449
Speaker 1: That was its deal.

289
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it had ads.

290
00:18:41,075 --> 00:18:43,259
Speaker 1: Yep, because of probably this reason Well had three deals.

291
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:50,203
Speaker 0: The first deal was you live in a town that doesn't get reception will have one community antenna and a cable that distributes the stuff From that and sure.

292
00:18:50,244 --> 00:18:50,505
Speaker 1: Yeah.

293
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:56,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, but knowing that that that era is Irrelevant and archaic and is not in any way.

294
00:18:56,992 --> 00:19:00,283
Speaker 1: Well, I mean you probably in your antenna Days, right?

295
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,270
Speaker 1: You probably only got like Detroit TV.

296
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,160
Speaker 0: No, we got like 19 channels plus.

297
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

298
00:19:06,464 --> 00:19:07,508
Speaker 1: So we were in Connecticut.

299
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,380
Speaker 1: So on antenna, we had all New York stations.

300
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,585
Speaker 0: No, we got like 30 channels.

301
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:13,368
Speaker 0: I'm enumerating my head.

302
00:19:13,388 --> 00:19:21,240
Speaker 0: We had to channel 2 2 4 7 14. we're all like major networks plus 20 and 50.

303
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,133
Speaker 1: But like we had two of each major network because we had New York and Connecticut.

304
00:19:25,193 --> 00:19:27,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be like I got Canada.

305
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:37,900
Speaker 1: We had two different NBC's two different ABC's two different CBS's - right so you could watch even though a lot of times they would Both show the same thing like well footballs on New York NBC and Connecticut NBC.

306
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:43,701
Speaker 1: Oh, you had nightly news on ABC to get Connecticut nightly news on 8 and you get New York 7.

307
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:45,969
Speaker 1: You know eyewitness news on 7 even though they're both ABC.

308
00:19:45,989 --> 00:19:48,839
Speaker 0: we get a lot of Wisconsin content, you know 8 o'clock 7 central.

309
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:55,300
Speaker 1: We had two PBS's and then there were all the local stations right like channel 20 or 21 like, Connecticut station.

310
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,279
Speaker 1: You watch cartoons after school like that, but then we also had New York ones like 11 where you can watch the Mets and whatnot.

311
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:08,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we had like double stations within the antenna days Which is probably a lot of the reason why we didn't get cable for so long also because it was expensive.

312
00:20:09,281 --> 00:20:15,160
Speaker 0: We I remember Channel 9 was Canadian TV and that had all the cartoons like the best cartoons all the Canadian TV.

313
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,654
Speaker 1: I mean the government cartoons, right?

314
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:24,540
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, also in that was the one Inspector Gadget was on at a better time on the Canadian network than it was on whatever I forget what channel.

315
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,942
Speaker 1: They're also Saturday morning cartoons in those days.

316
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:27,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

317
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:36,410
Speaker 0: there were so things of the day.

318
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,416
Speaker 0: So this is actually pretty cool.

319
00:20:40,557 --> 00:20:45,670
Speaker 0: I have a video here that is happy family family of kittens bird and puppy.

320
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,555
Speaker 1: What kind of bird is it?

321
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:48,769
Speaker 0: Oh, just like a little parakeet.

322
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:52,463
Speaker 0: Okay, so the interesting thing about this video is that is from 1955 but word in color.

323
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,528
Speaker 0: This is just YouTube from today.

324
00:20:57,171 --> 00:21:00,702
Speaker 0: Okay, it's just but the reason this is on YouTube.

325
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,450
Speaker 1: it looks like it was shot though in a studio not in a home.

326
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:08,069
Speaker 0: it was because There was no amateur video production back then like this.

327
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:11,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, how you gonna set up a big old film camera from the 50s at home?

328
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,525
Speaker 0: Yeah with a giant light that's giving anyone cancer or whatever.

329
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:25,822

339
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:43,190
Speaker 1: I haven't lives it organized.

340
00:21:43,371 --> 00:21:44,418
Speaker 0: Anyway, seems to be.

341
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,290
Speaker 0: you can go to a website like search for stuff.

342
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,890
Speaker 0: There's lots of cool that's useful like the bombing of Pearl Harbor like some first-hand stuff.

343
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,450
Speaker 0: I don't need to see the the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

344
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,381
Speaker 1: What are the good things to see?

345
00:21:57,422 --> 00:21:59,530
Speaker 0: more kittens happy family of kittens bird.

346
00:22:00,073 --> 00:22:03,926
Speaker 0: There's a lot of that a lot of old building construction like things.

347
00:22:06,252 --> 00:22:08,745
Speaker 0: I have not fully gone through this yet.

348
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:09,830
Speaker 1: We got to find the nerd stuff.

349
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,461
Speaker 1: Where are the nerds from the 50s 120 years of video?

350
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:25,950
Speaker 0: The only thing that bothers me about this other than it should be creative commons in some fashion But I'll take it is That minutes does not seem like the optimum unit to use to measure this.

351
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,725
Speaker 1: It's they got to have the most impressive number they can visit.

352
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,750
Speaker 1: how many videos they'd be like.

353
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,050
Speaker 1: Yeah about a thousand videos.

354
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,578
Speaker 0: I would have put it in hours or perhaps day.

355
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,290
Speaker 1: like a thousand videos are uploaded to YouTube like every second.

356
00:22:37,511 --> 00:22:37,993
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's.

357
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,926
Speaker 1: no you can't really brag about like we uploaded a thousand YouTube videos.

358
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:45,422
Speaker 0: Yeah, good job But really minutes dude, like we see what you're doing there.

359
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:52,670
Speaker 1: Anyway, so for my thing of the day I dug back to my what used to be the most common source of things of the day.

360
00:22:52,891 --> 00:22:56,609
Speaker 0: Oh reaching back for glory the glory of Japanese television.

361
00:22:58,012 --> 00:23:03,635
Speaker 1: So there's a show on Japanese television called gonna mispronounce the name Sekai.

362
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:13,788
Speaker 1: no hot a mod a tech which means Riddles at the ends of the earth exclamation point and I recognized Sekai and literally nothing else.

363
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:21,390
Speaker 1: Yes The attack is spelled ITT EQ, which I've never seen as a Japanese spelling before and a romanization anyway.

364
00:23:22,013 --> 00:23:34,333
Speaker 1: so in this video they are demonstrating a Material called the predator shield, which is basically like a glass that you would use at a zoo to keep you know Animals in.

365
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,823
Speaker 0: oh, so not like predator shield.

366
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:44,430
Speaker 1: No, you know something you would use You know maybe like on windows of a vehicle on a safari an actual predator like a bear not right a predator.

367
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:55,601
Speaker 1: And in this video there's a schoolgirl or a girl a woman in a schoolgirl outfit inside of a box that is Six sides sealed with oh good god.

368
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:57,087
Speaker 1: She looks terrified.

369
00:23:57,107 --> 00:24:00,015
Speaker 1: He is terrified With predator shield.

370
00:24:00,195 --> 00:24:01,119
Speaker 1: I don't know how she's breathing.

371
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,303
Speaker 1: There must be a hole in it somewhere.

372
00:24:02,343 --> 00:24:03,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a hole right there.

373
00:24:03,326 --> 00:24:07,923
Speaker 1: Okay, and There's just a real fucking bear like rawr.

374
00:24:08,084 --> 00:24:08,726
Speaker 1: I'm a bear.

375
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:16,230
Speaker 1: go go Like Attacking this box that she's in and she's holding a camera pointing at the bear.

376
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,189
Speaker 1: She's somehow managing to keep the camera aimed at the.

377
00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:27,250
Speaker 1: now She's not look at this while also being terrified for her life because this bear is actually ferociously attacking this box.

378
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:37,569
Speaker 1: Thankfully, it seems that the predator shield product works and protects you from bears But it doesn't mean you should subject someone to being in a box that is attacked by a bear.

379
00:24:38,692 --> 00:24:46,130
Speaker 1: You could have put say I don't know Honey in the box and had it be attacked by the bear to prove the bear could not get the honey.

380
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:50,070
Speaker 1: And that would have been an ample demonstrate that it would not be Japanese television.

381
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,116
Speaker 1: No, it would not.

382
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:52,343
Speaker 1: nor would it be a thing of the day.

383
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:55,702
Speaker 0: in the meta moment The book club book is the wheel of time.

384
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:56,930
Speaker 1: I read a bunch more of yesterday.

385
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:00,058
Speaker 0: How far'd you get like what happened recently?

386
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:03,468

388
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:10,890

389
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:11,654
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

390
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:14,909
Speaker 0: a chuckle fuck in the alley totally ratted them out.

391
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,601
Speaker 1: Yeah, they even said man that chuckle fuck is gonna ride us out.

393
00:25:23,575 --> 00:25:30,761

394
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:33,430
Speaker 0: They should stab Rand and Perrin.

395
00:25:34,751 --> 00:25:46,280
Speaker 1: These guys got to learn a lot more from other long quest adventures like my man, you know, oh the water Like Tetsuro just gun people fucking down.

Speaker 1: concerts canceled Just say go.

463
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:49,970
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Assholes so belts When I run another Thursday show ideas unless it's book club.

464
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:50,391
Speaker 1: So

465
00:29:50,472 --> 00:29:52,520
Speaker 0: I was a kid and pretty much

466
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,990
Speaker 1: pretty much down to types of food and articles of clothing

467
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:03,445
Speaker 0: when I was young like as a little kid a belt was something that my mom made me wear when I had to wear a suit to go To like a wedding or a funeral.

468
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:09,029
Speaker 1: or yeah I did not wear a belt until like I was in high school except if I was dressing up.

469
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:18,690
Speaker 0: Yep, and a lot of that was you don't tuck your shirt in and if you're not talking to shirt in Probably don't need the belt unless your pants don't fit All right.

470
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,246
Speaker 1: And the only reason to wear the belt because if you're tucking the shirt in is because pants look stupid.

471
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,196
Speaker 1: if they're sticking out There's no belt on them.

472
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,450
Speaker 1: Just a bunch of loops and shit with nothing.

473
00:30:26,871 --> 00:30:30,967
Speaker 0: If you tuck your shirt in and you're not wearing a belt you like that's it game over man.

474
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:31,890
Speaker 1: Looks it looks bad.

475
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,517
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not styling.

476
00:30:33,537 --> 00:30:34,019
Speaker 0: Well, there's.

477
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:34,843
Speaker 0: no you don't have to.

478
00:30:34,863 --> 00:30:37,012
Speaker 1: you have to know anything about fashion to know that That's not good.

479
00:30:37,032 --> 00:30:37,977
Speaker 0: in fact, there's no excuse.

480
00:30:38,017 --> 00:30:41,090
Speaker 0: cuz what your if your pants don't have belt loops, so it's what like sweatpants?

481
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:43,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, you tucked your shirt into your sweatpants, dude.

482
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:56,038
Speaker 0: Okay Once in high school I started wearing a belt because I started wearing slightly more fashionable jeans and I would occasionally do the thing Where you'd.

483
00:30:56,078 --> 00:31:00,430
Speaker 0: I'd tuck a shirt in But then I'd have another shirt or something on and wear like a jacket or something.

484
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:03,162
Speaker 1: I wore a belt to keep pants from falling down.

485
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:04,770
Speaker 0: I had one belt.

486
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,109
Speaker 0: I got a really nice like black leather belt.

487
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:11,205
Speaker 0: It's the only belt I ever wore no matter what because I just never kind of like how.

488
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:13,374
Speaker 0: I only owned one tie a thin Black silk tie.

489
00:31:13,816 --> 00:31:16,750
Speaker 1: I had one belt but it was not a black belt was brown.

490
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:24,790
Speaker 1: And this was when the style of the time was not the onion style But it was the style where the belt was a bunch of like thin strips of leather.

491
00:31:24,992 --> 00:31:27,150
Speaker 1: We're rated Bell that we're all braided together.

492
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:30,390
Speaker 0: I was not the style when I was in high school where I lived.

493
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,621
Speaker 1: It was the style for quite a time where I was.

494
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:35,717
Speaker 1: what year you're talking like you would go to the store And that's the only belts they had.

495
00:31:35,858 --> 00:31:37,467
Speaker 0: What year are you talking about?

496
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:38,070
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

497
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,804
Speaker 1: I just remember that's the kind of belt I had for a long time.

498
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:48,484
Speaker 0: Maybe even into RIT I had that same belt, you know, actually I'll bet it comes down to because you know The internet wasn't really fully internet back then.

499
00:31:48,504 --> 00:32:18,221
Speaker 0: I Suspect that fashion varied widely depending on where you live like Michigan kind of behind the curve like in high school you know, it was actually kind of what like the Semi cool slacker skater, you know, like the the so popular set like the sub genius they often wear like semi baggy black or blue jeans a flannel shirt like over the top unbuttoned just like open and Like an ironic t-shirt like the dare shirt underneath that.

500
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,626
Speaker 1: that's a typical 90s fashion.

501
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:24,430
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe you'd wear some like boots and get the boot cut jeans.

502
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,256
Speaker 0: maybe I Wore boots a lot in high school.

503
00:32:30,276 --> 00:32:33,249
Speaker 0: I wore like engineer's boots or motorcycle boots, but that was just.

504
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:34,180
Speaker 0: you know I've lived in Michigan.

505
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:34,870
Speaker 0: I had a mustache.

506
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,415
Speaker 0: That's how things were.

507
00:32:36,556 --> 00:32:40,530
Speaker 1: rim is not the person to look at for fashion with his toe shoes and his kilt.

508
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:43,280
Speaker 0: See, I'm not worried.

509
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:50,487
Speaker 1: I didn't count for Non sporting mean-spirited in the sense of a sense of fashion with the toe shoes and the kill.

510
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:54,010
Speaker 1: that ain't recent Look at you right rim from high school had the same fashion stuff.

511
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,618
Speaker 1: You just didn't have the same money and there weren't the same.

512
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,250
Speaker 1: if I weren't the same things on offer you tell the guys exist.

513
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:03,326
Speaker 0: If I could have gotten you till I killed in high school, I would have fucking been wearing that.

514
00:33:03,346 --> 00:33:04,110
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

515
00:33:04,531 --> 00:33:12,717
Speaker 0: However, even I have not changed even that I would have known better than to go with the trilby Because that the trilby went from.

516
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:15,123
Speaker 0: that seems like a cool idea to all hell.

517
00:33:15,183 --> 00:33:23,006
Speaker 0: no in about 30 seconds anyway, but When I got to college, I just had that same belt.

518
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,129
Speaker 0: one day belt broke.

519
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:27,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, my weave II belt.

520
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:29,785
Speaker 1: I think you know, I remember that we've.

521
00:33:29,846 --> 00:33:34,950
Speaker 1: I think it might have died And then I I think it died twice and I think I replaced it with a weave II belt.

522
00:33:35,113 --> 00:33:36,010
Speaker 1: I don't know when it died.

523
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:44,656
Speaker 1: I just remember twice having belts die and one time replacing it with a similar belt and then again replacing it with a Not weave II belt.

524
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:46,221
Speaker 0: see now the reason I want a black belt.

525
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:47,807
Speaker 1: his belts last a fucking long time.

526
00:33:47,847 --> 00:33:48,650
Speaker 1: What are you doing to it?

527
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just rub in your like hips against the wall every day or something.

528
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:55,710
Speaker 0: But you had a brown belt.

529
00:33:56,092 --> 00:33:56,675
Speaker 0: So did you all?

530
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,230
Speaker 0: did you have a black belt for when you were dressed up or yes?

531
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,579
Speaker 1: I had a black shiny belt for wearing a suit.

532
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,863
Speaker 0: You only wore when you were.

533
00:34:03,884 --> 00:34:05,870
Speaker 1: that I only wore when required.

534
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:10,230
Speaker 0: Yep, so I chose black because all the jewelry I wore was mostly silver.

535
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,922
Speaker 0: so it was like black and I had a silver buckle on it like silver.

536
00:34:13,063 --> 00:34:22,135
Speaker 0: ish and Basically if I I couldn't wear although I couldn't wear gold jewelry really because I wouldn't match the belt I wasn't gonna own multiple belts.

537
00:34:22,175 --> 00:34:23,079
Speaker 0: that just seemed crazy.

538
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,042
Speaker 0: I didn't wear jewelry.

539
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:25,648
Speaker 0: So yeah, I did so.

540
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:33,606
Speaker 0: yeah but I had to buy a new belt and I bought an identical black belt that lasted me until like it died a couple years ago.

541
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:34,148
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

542
00:34:35,112 --> 00:34:48,889
Speaker 0: so, uh, I didn't expand my belt purchases until relatively recently because I kick-started this weirdo belt and Now I have four of these things and they're the only belts I wear wearing clothes one of them.

543
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:52,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we are not sponsoring this belt.

544
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,141
Speaker 1: They don't pay us any money.

545
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:53,844
Speaker 1: They don't know us.

546
00:34:53,904 --> 00:34:55,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, but pretty much.

547
00:34:56,632 --> 00:35:12,650
Speaker 0: This belt is great in the sense that it solved a problem that I kind of wish had been solved for me with belts earlier That you cut it to be the exact perfect size when you buy it and it is literally the perfect size And it has no belt holes in it at all.

548
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's you know, not only belt lengths can be an issue, right?

549
00:35:17,411 --> 00:35:24,181
Speaker 1: But you know, especially if you're some in-between size and the store only has like, you know, 30 and 40 It's like I need 35, bro.

550
00:35:25,211 --> 00:35:26,337
Speaker 1: You know, why don't you make that?

551
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,990
Speaker 1: you cut the belt but the belt is attached to the buckle.

552
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,866
Speaker 0: you can't and you don't need all those holes because like are you your rates not gonna fluctuate that much?

553
00:35:33,886 --> 00:35:34,147
Speaker 0: right?

554
00:35:34,388 --> 00:35:34,548
Speaker 1: so?

555
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:35,954
Speaker 1: but the real Issue is the holes.

556
00:35:36,074 --> 00:35:43,107
Speaker 1: because even if you have holes on the belt, even if the belt has a lot of holes Okay, so you pull the belt and use the closest hole.

557
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:43,690
Speaker 1: All right.

558
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,756
Speaker 1: Well, this one's too tight.

559
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:50,309
Speaker 1: that was not tight enough and you poke a hole in the belt in the middle But you shouldn't do right and now it's the right size.

560
00:35:50,813 --> 00:35:53,629
Speaker 1: But you just ruined your belt by poking a crappy hole in it.

561
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:56,290
Speaker 0: Plus if you use one hole for even like a little while.

562
00:35:56,652 --> 00:35:59,045
Speaker 0: Then it kind of gets worn in on that hole and it looks stupid.

563
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:05,710
Speaker 0: if you use any other hole Yep, so you can't be like, uh better loosen the belt Then you lose some weight and you tighten up the belt.

564
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:14,139
Speaker 1: You know one stop in the summer because you lose the your hibernation fat or whatever and it's like now this ugly beat-up Hole is sticking out where everyone could see it.

565
00:36:14,582 --> 00:36:15,386
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I kick-started.

566
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:16,090
Speaker 0: this belt is great.

567
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:22,830
Speaker 0: So now I pretty much I own four of this belt and I only own one other kind of belt in the world.

568
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,850
Speaker 1: I bought one buckle for this belt system and I bought two belts a brown one a brown one in a black one.

569
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:33,070
Speaker 1: I don't think you can change the buckles that well, I did it work fine, and I don't change it too often either.

570
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if you change it like often I buy?

571
00:36:35,724 --> 00:36:41,230
Speaker 0: what if I have to do it often I would buy one because I won't wear brown belts because literally nothing I own goes with a brown belt.

572
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,963
Speaker 1: I rarely use the brown one, but sometimes I use the brown one.

573
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:48,480
Speaker 0: So I have basically Three black ones with three different buckles on them.

574
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,846
Speaker 1: I don't need different buckles.

575
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:51,979
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is one of them I wear every day to work.

576
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:52,907
Speaker 0: So it's getting kind of beat up.

577
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,615
Speaker 1: The buckles getting beat up?

578
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:57,761
Speaker 1: I've never had a buckle break.

579
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:59,868
Speaker 0: I'm wearing it every day all the time.

580
00:36:59,888 --> 00:37:00,048
Speaker 0: I wear

581
00:37:00,068 --> 00:37:00,650
Speaker 1: them most days

582
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:13,349
Speaker 0: Yeah and then I got one with like the like a Black buckle like black metal that go like it kind of blends in really well when I wear like formal wear But I own but basically two of those belts I wear like twice a year.

583
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:16,915
Speaker 0: So that cuz when you wear a nice suit like you want the bulk of the belt It just looks perfect.

584
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:22,802
Speaker 0: You want a belt that is like wrinkles in it Like it looks like the shitty belt and it suddenly stands out and detracts.

585
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:29,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh nice three-piece suit and Shabby shoes that you obviously also wear to work, right?

586
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,190
Speaker 1: It's like if you're wearing a suit and like you have a shoe and there's like a big gash on it.

587
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,250
Speaker 1: It's just like, you know, it's like anything that's like perfect just sort of blends in and is not unseen.

588
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:47,542
Speaker 1: But anything that's like a you know, a negative mark like sticks out like like this do like it's glowing Yeah, like the hip like the the weak spot on a boss.

589
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's totally the weak spot.

590
00:37:49,953 --> 00:37:50,959
Speaker 0: And then the fourth one I got.

591
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:52,770
Speaker 0: I bought the gray belt.

592
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,318
Speaker 0: But now I realized that I don't.

593
00:37:54,499 --> 00:37:55,726
Speaker 0: I don't really have anything that goes with it.

594
00:37:55,766 --> 00:37:56,470
Speaker 0: So I've never worn it.

595
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:56,913
Speaker 0: There's no.

596
00:37:56,953 --> 00:37:59,169
Speaker 1: when would any of you ever see anyone wearing a gray belt?

597
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:05,690
Speaker 0: Uh, actually I was looking through my clothes there I found like some I looked through like cuz I have a bunch of white jeans with a gray suit.

598
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,874
Speaker 1: Do you wear a gray belt?

599
00:38:07,376 --> 00:38:09,565
Speaker 0: No, I wouldn't wear a gray belt with a gray.

600
00:38:09,605 --> 00:38:10,950
Speaker 1: What do you wear a gray belt with?

601
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,208
Speaker 1: I wear a gray belt, but I guess when you wear gray socks, what do you wear gray socks with?

602
00:38:16,343 --> 00:38:18,261
Speaker 0: old You wear it with old.

603
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,190
Speaker 1: that's old man clothes.

604
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, you wear that with old.

605
00:38:20,414 --> 00:38:24,750
Speaker 0: so when I'm 70 start wearing that gray fucking belt with my white fucking pants.

606
00:38:26,136 --> 00:38:26,688
Speaker 1: Even that's weird.

607
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:41,070
Speaker 0: Usually the gray belt actually works really well because I have one pair of proper jeans not like the spandex II like hipster stuff that I usually wear but they're like old-school like heavy straight down jeans and they're white like fucking white white white.

608
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:47,530
Speaker 0: and They work really well with that gray belt, but I don't guess it's kind of yeah But I've never seen you wear white jeans.

609
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,170
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I don't wear them that often because they don't stay white love.

610
00:38:50,572 --> 00:38:53,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought white shorts and I was like, these are gonna get really dirty really fast.

611
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,336
Speaker 1: They did but I'm just like.

612
00:38:54,356 --> 00:38:57,839
Speaker 1: well fuck I knew that was gonna have these shorts is okay But I don't.

613
00:38:57,859 --> 00:38:59,650
Speaker 0: that's the other thing I realized long ago.

614
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,015
Speaker 0: This is the other kind of belt I have.

615
00:39:01,738 --> 00:39:04,489
Speaker 0: wearing a leather belt with shorts looks really stupid.

616
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:08,518
Speaker 1: Not if they're like nice shirts Where's nice shorts?

617
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:09,910
Speaker 0: I wear comfortable summer shorts.

618
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,119
Speaker 0: I have a pair of like, you know, the kind we're like.

619
00:39:12,139 --> 00:39:16,382
Speaker 1: you see the guy who's a model standing on the sailing boat And he's all like, oh, yeah.

620
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:17,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but here's the problem.

621
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:21,069
Speaker 0: I wear shorts and I'm like biking or it's hot out or whatever.

622
00:39:21,531 --> 00:39:25,146
Speaker 0: I sweat and when leather belts get sweaty they start to deform.

623
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:29,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not Doing any sort of physical activity, but I need a belt.

624
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,750
Speaker 0: so I have a bunch of canvas belts that I use for Anything that doesn't need a real belt.

625
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:39,030
Speaker 0: So a lot of the shorts I bought recently like come with that like kind of fake Oh fabric belt.

626
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,350
Speaker 1: This one I'm wearing right now came with a belt the ones I'm wearing now.

627
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,961
Speaker 0: I don't have the belt in but they can also came with.

628
00:39:45,202 --> 00:39:46,086
Speaker 0: it's not a canvas belt.

629
00:39:46,106 --> 00:39:49,578
Speaker 0: It's just a fabric belt Some sort of woven thing.

630
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,870
Speaker 1: It's sort of durable and then it's basically just on the other end instead of a buckle.

631
00:39:52,931 --> 00:40:01,116
Speaker 1: There's sort of like these two metal loops Yep, and so the size is only gonna be perfect because there's no holes you just pull it through these Yeah, but because it's not leather.

632
00:40:01,156 --> 00:40:03,826
Speaker 0: It's comfortable in the summer and it matches the pants.

633
00:40:03,866 --> 00:40:04,910
Speaker 1: because it came with the pan.

634
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have to do any thinking if you don't know anything about fashion.

635
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:13,890
Speaker 0: I keep all those belts with the the short that they came with exactly and I well, yeah, maybe I could mix them up.

636
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,257
Speaker 0: No, I don't know how that works.

637
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:17,006
Speaker 0: It'll probably look stupid and I wouldn't understand why.

638
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:17,710
Speaker 0: why bother?

639
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:18,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

640
00:40:18,514 --> 00:40:20,123
Speaker 1: It was like Oh shorts plus free belt.

641
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:23,358
Speaker 1: Hey, not bad But I don't have to wear my other belt.

642
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:26,290
Speaker 0: so when I was a kid, I was a Cub Scout, right?

643
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:31,342
Speaker 0: Cub Scouts had that military belt with the weird like the metal buckle.

644
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,165
Speaker 1: Oh, I had that.

645
00:40:32,205 --> 00:40:33,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has like a weird pin.

646
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:34,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the one.

647
00:40:35,197 --> 00:40:35,438
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:36,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I had that and you know what?

649
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:37,810
Speaker 0: I always hated that thing.

650
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,612
Speaker 0: I thought it was stupid.

651
00:40:38,673 --> 00:40:52,830
Speaker 0: It's a stupid belt buckle, but I did have a use for that kind of belt in my modern life Because now one of the things that I do, you know Hiking and running and like track like like running through the mountains of Hong Kong or whatever.

652
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:58,550
Speaker 0: I often need a belt for the kinds of pants that I wear to keep them like secure and like in the right place.

653
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:02,151
Speaker 0: Can't use my leather belt and those woven belts Like.

654
00:41:02,232 --> 00:41:07,098
Speaker 0: I don't want to get those dirty or fucked up because they go with those shorts And I don't want to ruin them.

655
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:08,970
Speaker 0: And also I need a belt that's dirty.

656
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:11,521
Speaker 1: You're gonna ruin the shorts before you ruin the belt.

657
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:12,144
Speaker 1: It depends.

658
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:13,270
Speaker 1: How's the belt gonna get ruined?

659
00:41:13,913 --> 00:41:16,406
Speaker 0: So I bought a bunch of a bunch.

660
00:41:16,446 --> 00:41:19,335
Speaker 0: I bought two Canvas belts on Amazon.

661
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:20,539
Speaker 1: How many belts do you have?

662
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,165
Speaker 0: So they're like two dollars.

663
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:23,790
Speaker 1: You have like one belt to a hundred belts.

664
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:26,010
Speaker 1: I got like one belt for each short.

665
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,301
Speaker 0: I have one leather belt for daily use and two other belts.

666
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,979
Speaker 0: Three leather belts for like dressing up like fashion I have.

667
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:36,029
Speaker 0: every pair of shorts has the belt it came with.

668
00:41:36,732 --> 00:41:40,730
Speaker 1: Are you sure you're just using these belts for wearing and you don't have an abundance of belts for other activities?

669
00:41:41,092 --> 00:41:49,129
Speaker 0: If I was gonna use other activities I can think of different kinds of velour belts but The canvas belts were like two dollars.

670
00:41:49,852 --> 00:41:51,778
Speaker 0: They're as strong as a seat belt.

671
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:53,041
Speaker 0: They got the two loops in the front.

672
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:54,406
Speaker 0: Just like though yours do.

673
00:41:54,907 --> 00:41:58,761
Speaker 0: those are for Camping hiking rock climbing that kind of shit.

674
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,930
Speaker 0: Mmm, like hang some stuff off of my bed.

675
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,558
Speaker 1: I don't think I need a different belt for that.

676
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:03,664
Speaker 0: You don't do that stuff.

677
00:42:03,684 --> 00:42:04,950
Speaker 0: So you don't need that kind of belt.

678
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:15,696
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna wear a leather belt like I can do the mountains But the belt that goes to the shorts is I'm not gonna take it off of the shorts and like put it on my pants That I'm wearing on the mountain.

679
00:42:15,717 --> 00:42:18,010
Speaker 0: That seems like a pain anyway.

680
00:42:19,214 --> 00:42:23,987
Speaker 0: the Yeah, plus I could use those belts to like splint a leg on the woods if I ever like.

681
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:24,710
Speaker 0: mess up my leg.

682
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:36,730
Speaker 1: So the one kind of belt that never really understood I guess it's just not the style of these parts or times is the giant cowboy fancy belt buckle like the really fucking big one.

683
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:40,763
Speaker 0: I think those things look hideous, but other people have other tastes.

684
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:44,355
Speaker 1: So I think someone wearing one Looks hideous.

685
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:48,270
Speaker 1: if you're actually a full-on cowboy at least matches what the rest of your way.

686
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:48,603
Speaker 0: That's fine.

687
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:56,150
Speaker 0: Like if you're if you've got like a if you have a bolo tie on You are allowed to wear a narrow range of weird belt buckles, right?

688
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:56,833
Speaker 0: That's okay.

689
00:42:56,914 --> 00:42:59,790
Speaker 1: The thing is like if someone say has a collection of these things.

690
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,034
Speaker 1: I think that's kind of cool like.

691
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:02,278
Speaker 1: look at them like because they're.

692
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,170
Speaker 1: it's like it's a more advertising space for your geekery, right?

693
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:10,849
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you can have a belt buckle for your favorite sports team or your fur.

694
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:13,861
Speaker 1: You give it like a netrunner belt buckle or does you can.

695
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:17,889
Speaker 1: it's a. it's space to put something awesome The kind of thing that you would put on a tattoo.

696
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:33,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, alright a t-shirt on your face, but it's usually Confederate flags or like bullets Obviously, it's usually guns or better bikes or bullets or cows or something stupid right, but just the aesthetic of it is usually very Uncool.

697
00:43:33,955 --> 00:43:36,689
Speaker 1: you have to sort of go all-in on it to make it work.

698
00:43:37,093 --> 00:43:47,170
Speaker 1: And if you're the kind of person that it works for You know some cowboy person I'm usually gonna have a skeptical view of you unless you prove otherwise.

699
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:48,033
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what?

700
00:43:48,053 --> 00:43:50,140
Speaker 0: It's like the trilby and the fedora.

701
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:58,606
Speaker 0: They look great on a Person who is wearing all the other clothes that go with that kind of hat.

702
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:04,430
Speaker 0: in the year 1930 some or even today like I go to fancy like Wall Street parties, right?

703
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:20,610
Speaker 0: Occasionally you see someone who's wearing like a fancy Wall Street party in the art deco ballroom But they're wearing like a snappy semi period jacket and they're basically in the Waldorf Astoria ballroom Like those kinds of hands in the modern hotel ballroom.

704
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:25,830
Speaker 0: Those kinds of hats were the old hotel if you double down on it and wear all the things that go with it.

705
00:44:26,111 --> 00:44:38,997
Speaker 0: But if you're wearing an expensive fashion hat like that With a nerd t-shirt a tweed jacket Utilikil toe shoes vape pen It's just like the belt buckle, you know,

706
00:44:39,017 --> 00:44:45,837
Speaker 1: you go around the city and sometimes you see that old guy whose fashion is just like Yeah, it's like damn.

Speaker 1: Or is there some?

712
00:44:55,022 --> 00:44:59,186
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's someplace in the city I can go to get the clothes that look so amazing.

713
00:44:59,206 --> 00:45:03,668
Speaker 1: when you're an old man You're so style so jazz, so I learned the secret of how to look like that.

714
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:09,134
Speaker 0: unless your hobby is fashion you go to a Place and give them a lot of money.

00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:42,250
Speaker 0: Well, cuz I got some special shorts for bouldering.

722
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:45,737
Speaker 0: The difference is these shorts are wearing bouldering.

723
00:45:46,098 --> 00:45:49,508
Speaker 0: the front will just get scraped off by the rocks in the wall.

724
00:45:49,528 --> 00:45:50,370
Speaker 0: It's like sandpaper.

725
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:53,730
Speaker 0: Okay, and might hurt myself to like I'll scrape myself.

726
00:45:54,273 --> 00:46:00,502
Speaker 0: So the shorts are like really durable like really heavy But they also have more pieces of fabric than like normal shorts do like here.

727
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:03,089
Speaker 0: crotch kind of just comes together like normal pants.

728
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:08,090
Speaker 0: do These things have gussets in the crotch for full range of movement all the stuff you need like there.

729
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:10,986
Speaker 0: They're specialized equipment for a specific sport.

730
00:46:11,328 --> 00:46:11,488
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

731
00:46:11,991 --> 00:46:16,424
Speaker 0: So the reason normal shorts don't have that stuff even though they're a lot more comfortable.

732
00:46:16,544 --> 00:46:18,350
Speaker 1: as you're just walking and cuz it looks stupid.

733
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:20,921
Speaker 0: No You wouldn't even see you wouldn't even know if I was wearing these shorts.

734
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:23,449
Speaker 0: unless you like put your face under my crotch And I took a good look.

735
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:34,050
Speaker 0: It's way more Expensive to have the machine that can do those extra pieces of fabric when you're making the shorts in the factory The shirts are the same way.

736
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:39,269
Speaker 0: So this guy's like yeah I had to get this machine that can do this kind of cut and this kind of cut and this kind of thing.

737
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:40,448
Speaker 0: and I learned a bunch of stuff about shirts.

738
00:46:41,411 --> 00:46:51,665
Speaker 0: so he knows some people who make like the ultra like, you know, this like the Three-piece suit that like a famous person wears to like the Oscars.

739
00:46:51,705 --> 00:46:52,848
Speaker 0: that's like a unique suit.

740
00:46:52,868 --> 00:46:53,390
Speaker 0: That's weird.

741
00:46:54,195 --> 00:46:55,282
Speaker 0: They make that kind of stuff.

742
00:46:56,046 --> 00:47:02,090
Speaker 0: So He offered introduced me and I might be able to get like one suit from these people.

743
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,190
Speaker 1: Doesn't still gonna cost you thousands of dollars.

744
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:07,670
Speaker 0: They might work with me just because they seem like really super cool news.

745
00:47:08,112 --> 00:47:11,610
Speaker 1: It's not cheap because them thousands of dollars to make the suit the material.

746
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:16,270
Speaker 0: Well, yeah that but maybe I might be able to get a deal where I'll pay for the materials.

747
00:47:16,371 --> 00:47:19,309
Speaker 0: But they're not gonna charge me like what they would charge for their time.

748
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:23,758
Speaker 0: But it's not gonna be I it's gonna be iron monkey style.

749
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:24,641
Speaker 1: so you get a $10,000 suit for $6,000.

750
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:24,801
Speaker 1: maybe.

751
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,735
Speaker 1: yeah That's still I wouldn't buy it.

752
00:47:28,816 --> 00:47:31,710
Speaker 0: I think they might charge more than 10,000 for one of their like ultra.

753
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:35,021
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably but so I hadn't met them.

754
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:35,924
Speaker 0: but he described them.

755
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:43,590
Speaker 0: and then later on to Wall Street party I saw a person and I was like, oh damn because the suit this guy was wearing was crazy.

756
00:47:43,831 --> 00:47:44,955
Speaker 1: What kind of belt was he wearing?

757
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:47,325
Speaker 0: I didn't even notice because the suit was so crazy.

758
00:47:47,345 --> 00:47:48,470
Speaker 1: That's what happens a lot, right?

759
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:55,310
Speaker 1: It's like, you know I think about these old guys with their so style that I see in the city and it's like what kind of belt were they?

760
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:55,591
Speaker 1: Wearing?

761
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:58,643
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine it cuz the purpose of the belt is just to blend in.

762
00:47:58,683 --> 00:48:00,290
Speaker 0: if you notice the belt the suit fuck.

763
00:48:00,351 --> 00:48:02,409
Speaker 1: The belt is functional unlike the suspenders.

764
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:10,186
Speaker 0: You're only functional if your pants are really heavy like a fireman Uh, or if you you like 20 style pants don't have belt loops.

765
00:48:10,427 --> 00:48:10,989
Speaker 1: That's true, too.

766
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:12,817
Speaker 0: So you have to wear suspenders like.

767
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:13,521
Speaker 0: that's just how it goes.

768
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:14,606
Speaker 1: hide those suspenders.

769
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:18,526
Speaker 0: You don't show them off Yeah, unless you're of a businessman style taking your jacket off.

770
00:48:18,748 --> 00:48:34,525
Speaker 0: That's right anyway, so the suit was crazy and it was like on the edge of being the Scuzzy suit that a homeless person in the 20s would wear but Well done on purpose to be fashion like it.

771
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:35,630
Speaker 0: the suit was crazy.

772
00:48:36,153 --> 00:48:39,369
Speaker 0: And then later I was like was that one of the people he was like, how'd you guess?

773
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:40,928
Speaker 0: Was it the suit?

774
00:48:43,571 --> 00:48:53,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I had you know if I cared if I was actually I pay someone to make me look good Right, but like I would get I want to you know I don't actually want to be looking like the old guy who's so style.

775
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:58,067
Speaker 1: I want to be like, you know, the ultimate badass dude with the black suit.

776
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:58,970
Speaker 1: It looks so dangerous.

777
00:48:59,251 --> 00:49:07,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, the guy who's wearing an all black suit black shirt black tie black belt buckle black everything He's got an obsidian ring and a black knuckle buster.

778
00:49:07,322 --> 00:49:09,650
Speaker 1: like that guy must be a secret agent over there.

779
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:10,965
Speaker 1: Look how badass he is.

780
00:49:10,985 --> 00:49:14,780
Speaker 1: Yes Doesn't say where that is a dangerous individual.

781
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,428
Speaker 1: The problem is I don't have the body of a dangerous individual So I put that suit on it.

782
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:21,089
Speaker 1: They'll be like who's that guy with the hunch wearing a suit that doesn't fit?

783
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:27,290
Speaker 0: You can possibly pay someone to give you a dangerous looking body - how does that work personal trainer?

784
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,683
Speaker 0: He's gonna make you go these and take you to a gym and tell you to do stuff But I can't even do the push-up.

785
00:49:31,764 --> 00:49:32,450
Speaker 0: He'll figure it out.

786
00:49:32,872 --> 00:49:34,279
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna magically do the push-up.

787
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,469
Speaker 0: if they tell me to maybe you'll make you do the knee push-up.

788
00:49:38,171 --> 00:49:38,814
Speaker 1: I've tried to do.

789
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,463
Speaker 0: I can't make you do the wall push-up.

790
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:42,937
Speaker 1: I Mean, that's a push sideways.

791
00:49:43,118 --> 00:49:45,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can push sideways until you can push down.

792
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:48,376
Speaker 1: Why would I pay money for that?

793
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:49,460
Speaker 0: so you want to.

794
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:49,982
Speaker 0: so think of this.

795
00:49:50,163 --> 00:49:51,910
Speaker 0: I can do like a bunch of pull-ups like.

796
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:52,735
Speaker 0: I Just do a bunch of pull-ups.

797
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:53,963
Speaker 1: You see the pinky pull-up guy.

798
00:49:54,205 --> 00:49:54,909
Speaker 0: I can't do that.

799
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:56,275
Speaker 0: Okay, I can.

800
00:49:56,315 --> 00:49:58,684
Speaker 1: some guys just recently set the record for pinky pull-ups.

801
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:00,109
Speaker 0: I can do zero.

802
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:02,757
Speaker 0: I can do me too.

803
00:50:02,777 --> 00:50:03,239
Speaker 1: We're tied.

804
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,590
Speaker 0: I can do a quarter of one and probably break my pinky.

805
00:50:07,131 --> 00:50:08,418
Speaker 1: We're tied great.

806
00:50:09,201 --> 00:50:10,106
Speaker 1: I'm just as strong as you.

807
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:11,010
Speaker 1: we can do the same number.

808
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:16,595
Speaker 0: I can do like eight nine ten pull-ups like easy, but So rock climbing.

809
00:50:16,635 --> 00:50:20,150
Speaker 0: there's an exercise thing called a campus board, which is basically these little wooden nubblies.

810
00:50:20,311 --> 00:50:28,438
Speaker 0: It's not the people who decide to kick you out of college Sticking out of a wall like thin pieces of wood sticking out of a wall Like you grab them like this with your fingertips.

811
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,399
Speaker 0: I've seen that but then they go up the wall at an angle like this Mm-hmm.

812
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:35,243
Speaker 1: So I haven't seen that.

813
00:50:35,424 --> 00:50:42,957
Speaker 0: I can get like Two or three steps up that thing before I fall off Flailing like a monster the whole time.

814
00:50:42,977 --> 00:50:44,240
Speaker 0: just woodley woodley woodley woodley.

815
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:53,352
Speaker 0: But then I see people who are way better than me rock climbing who basically just walk up the thing with two fingers if you change like Boop-boop-boop-boop-boop Yeah.

816
00:50:53,894 --> 00:50:54,134
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

817
00:50:54,837 --> 00:50:57,426
Speaker 0: I guess if I paid a personal trainer they could make me like that over time.

818
00:50:57,446 --> 00:50:58,248
Speaker 1: Are you gonna do that?

819
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:05,590
