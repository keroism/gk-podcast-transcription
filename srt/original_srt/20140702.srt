Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:31,005
Speaker 1: Lately I found that a bunch of our friends just talking about anime.

5
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:36,943
Speaker 1: They're watching Almost like point-for-point all the shows we watched over the last three years.

6
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:45,090
Speaker 1: at a delay of about three years People are like all our friends are just starting to catch up on shows that we were watching between one and three years ago.

7
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,970
Speaker 0: I mean most people on the internet are watching like every current show and have watched the shows we were watching a hundred years ago.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:01:00,109
Speaker 1: Yep, but like I got a message from someone recently who was like, oh my god episode 3 of Madoka And then someone else is like, oh my god, Senketsu and killa killa.

00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:14,410
Speaker 1: I like Repeatedly the same way that happened to us with the prince of nothing book.

13
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:19,768
Speaker 0: It's better to be in their position where you watch it for the first time and then talk about who the people who are already bored of it.

14
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:29,057
Speaker 1: The thing is sometimes when you do that you get in a situation where you're like, man I just saw a cool thing and the prince of nothing and they're like, yeah Well, you haven't gotten to the cool part yet.

15
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:32,469
Speaker 1: or oh wait till you find out what happens to that character.

28
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,281
Speaker 1: I said it was not enough of a storm to prevent me from biking.

29
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:10,289
Speaker 0: I'd sound bangs to differ with you.

30
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,635
Speaker 1: I what do you mean with me?

31
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:13,463

41
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:03,487

42
00:03:03,608 --> 00:03:07,069
Speaker 0: Yeah Right now like so I should just watch it when I get home.

43
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:20,903
Speaker 1: So watching utana again for the I don't know sixth time and taking notes during it I feel like at this point I have an expert understanding of that show at least the first 12 episodes As much as anyone not named Ikahara can have.

175
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,119
Speaker 1: Licenses bikes, it's ridiculous.

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:49,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, but regardless Bike thieves are one of the few exceptions I might add to my list of things that are worth corporal punishment for when the thieves are caught.

177
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:53,063
Speaker 0: Do we just set up bikes like bait bikes and they're electrified exactly.

178
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just die if you touch them.

179
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:59,910
Speaker 0: Or if you touch them for longer than sir or if you try to actually ride them you die.

180
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,544
Speaker 1: How about one that just clamps you to it or explodes or no?

181
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:08,609
Speaker 0: if you actually try to bike on it Like it's X when you're sitting on it and a knife comes out the seat right up in your ass?

182
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:14,389
Speaker 0: That way you can't possibly accidentally hurt someone with it who doesn't deserve it.

183
00:11:15,771 --> 00:11:25,859
Speaker 1: what if a poor beat cop chasing down a serial like double murderer is Tries to commandeer that bike is a tied up and locked.

184
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:26,621
Speaker 0: How's he gonna get it?

185
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:32,023
Speaker 0: He uses his bike commandeering equipment By the time he undoes the bike.

186
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,129
Speaker 0: It's the guys gone.

187
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:37,730
Speaker 1: There's some exigent circumstance that cause you use your cop car or your cop bike.

188
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:51,220
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so if you see this guy's bike anyway things of the day.

189
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:53,567
Speaker 1: So this is not related to anything.

191
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:07,083
Speaker 1: this is a documentary from vice vice comm vice Came out of nowhere and went from shock journalism to some of the best journalism or investigative journalism I've seen in Recent memory.

192
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:11,380
Speaker 0: I mean I watched one about this crazy drug in Colombia and it seemed true.

193
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,363
Speaker 0: But I'm still.

194
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:12,664
Speaker 0: it's.

195
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:17,320
Speaker 0: it's weird because it's like they have these documentaries about the crazy underworld in real life.

196
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:23,465
Speaker 0: But it's like so unbelievable, which is why it's compelling, but it's also Slightly unbelievable.

197
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:23,706
Speaker 1: Yeah.

198
00:12:23,726 --> 00:12:28,500
Speaker 1: Well, I the first thing I saw of theirs was their documentary on croco deal that horrible drug.

199
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:28,861

Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what Google image search for that.

202
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:33,640

00:12:34,762 --> 00:12:35,325
Speaker 0: Was that the same?

204
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:36,351
Speaker 0: it might have been a different drug.

205
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,780
Speaker 1: the one there was a different one.

206
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,856
Speaker 0: You barely get any of it and you could die but also mostly just lets you control people.

207

Speaker 1: So the better moment.

274
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:06,200
Speaker 1: the book club book is a canicle for Liebowitz the precursor to all modern post-apocalyptic science fiction.

275
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,417
Speaker 1: Pretty much started the genre of me and play God destroy the world.

276
00:16:11,477 --> 00:16:13,711
Speaker 0: post-apocalypse I don't know.

277
00:16:13,912 --> 00:16:15,000
Speaker 0: I'm talking about one.

278
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:25,469
Speaker 0: I don't think it did post-apocalyptic in general I but I pretty sure it was the first one where the post-apocalyptic situation and Humanity is isolated in some way.

279
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,320
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's partly that it was yield in society.

280
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:40,880
Speaker 1: It was one of the earlier novels that moved from the old style story of apocalypse to this new style Mostly nuclear driven because we should go and try to find like an old like the first story.

281
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,474
Speaker 0: That's truly post-apocalyptic.

282
00:16:42,494 --> 00:16:45,382
Speaker 0: the Bible It's up.

283
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,110
Speaker 0: that's apocalyptic not post-apocalyptic post-apocalyptic.

284
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,096
Speaker 1: the apocalypse happened in that story.

285
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,320
Speaker 1: No is bullshit.

286
00:16:52,122 --> 00:16:55,459
Speaker 1: isolated human on a boat surviving the apocalypse.

287
00:16:56,781 --> 00:17:00,214
Speaker 0: It's pretty much straight up saying mechanical for Liebowitz is a Noah's Ark metaphor.

288
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,637
Speaker 0: Uh, yes And where all the animals at?

289
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:06,509

Speaker 1: There were no bears in any book Since canicle for Liebowitz.

297
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:27,549

00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:29,716
Speaker 0: I want my hat back.

301
00:17:29,776 --> 00:17:38,700
Speaker 1: Yeah Not this weekend But next weekend is Connecticut and Hartford Connecticut the best convention in the northeastern United States.

302
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,540
Speaker 1: If you live within a day's travel of Connecticut, it is worth your while.

303
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,571
Speaker 1: imagine Dragon Con, but you can actually get into stuff.

304
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,724
Speaker 1: the panels are way higher quality and It's mostly.

305
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:52,899
Speaker 1: it's mostly in one building and the city it's in is way worse.

306
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:56,187
Speaker 1: Seriously it's super fun.

307
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:58,520
Speaker 1: We would not be plugging it unduly.

308
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:02,780
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go to it every year for X years in a row and do hard work to make it happen.

309
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:07,240
Speaker 1: If it wasn't worthwhile if we ever lied to you about a convention, I rest my case.

310
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:12,300
Speaker 1: And also just to bring it up again watch our show on shoujo kakamei utenna.

311
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,758
Speaker 1: The 12th episode is online.

312
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:15,266
Speaker 1: Share that shit around.

313
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:22,380
Speaker 1: in fact share all of our videos on the reddits and all those places Because the more views they get the faster will crank those things out.

314
00:18:22,922 --> 00:18:24,709
Speaker 1: I've dumped a ton of videos on one.

315
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,180
Speaker 0: make some of our shit so popular right on to work anymore.

316
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:35,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, guys if we don't have to work anymore You realize there's geek nights like multiple times a week reliably for the rest of your lives a multiple times a day.

317
00:18:36,302 --> 00:18:38,228
Speaker 0: More geek morning geek afternoon.

318
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:41,400
Speaker 1: you realize I would just stream every video game.

319
00:18:42,723 --> 00:18:43,669
Speaker 1: All of them I would play.

320
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:44,697
Speaker 1: I would let you guys pick.

321
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:48,784
Speaker 0: I don't care RPGs every day.

322
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:54,160
Speaker 1: yeah stream the RPGs I had time to set up like a studio to stream us playing burning wheel.

323
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,819
Speaker 0: anyway anyway, so Bravest warriors.

324
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,710
Speaker 0: So bravest warriors, it's a show.

325
00:19:03,731 --> 00:19:06,080
Speaker 0: I watched it when there was only one episode of it.

326
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,851
Speaker 0: I was like hey, this is new show on YouTube, but it's like.

327
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:10,900
Speaker 0: it's a real show that they're making for reals.

328
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:14,239
Speaker 0: But the episode is short, but it's made by the Adventure Time guy.

329
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just watch it on YouTube for free.

330
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,460
Speaker 1: like I ignored it in the beginning because there was a lot of stuff on YouTube.

331
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:25,658
Speaker 1: I didn't really put the pieces together I didn't realize there's the Adventure Time people right away, or at least I didn't realize the Pendleton Ward.

332
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:32,503
Speaker 1: yeah, and then I sort of paid attention to it because Scott was watching it and It's awesome.

333
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,230
Speaker 1: It's really awesome.

334
00:19:34,691 --> 00:19:42,877
Speaker 0: So it's it's a weird thing right because it's sort of Most things like this will give you some sort of like origin story for like what are the bravest warriors?

335
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:43,960
Speaker 0: who are all these characters?

336
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
Speaker 0: Right, but bravest warriors doesn't introduce anything.

337
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,812
Speaker 0: It just puts you right in the middle of whatever it is.

338
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,620
Speaker 1: the term for that is in media res.

339
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,189
Speaker 0: No, it's not in media.

340
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,779
Speaker 0: res is for like when you're in the middle of the act.

341
00:19:56,081 --> 00:19:57,934
Speaker 1: Action to some some episodes.

342
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:02,700
Speaker 1: it doesn't some episodes It does for almost every episode starts in the middle of like the one you just watched again.

343
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:10,832
Speaker 1: It just starts in the middle of there in this crazy war with these bugs Sure, but in terms of character introductions, right?

344
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,318
Speaker 0: It's not like oh by the way everyone.

345
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,160
Speaker 0: This is cat bug.

346
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,329
Speaker 0: It's just like they're hanging out and cat bug comes in.

347
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,293
Speaker 0: It's like hey cat bug.

348
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:18,879
Speaker 1: Don't hit me.

349
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:20,587
Speaker 0: It's like they don't introduce this.

350
00:20:20,648 --> 00:20:21,833
Speaker 0: Where did this cat bug come from?

351
00:20:21,994 --> 00:20:23,160
Speaker 0: I didn't know they had a cat bug.

352
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,224
Speaker 0: What is going on here?

353
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:28,260
Speaker 0: and it's just there suddenly and then there's millions of merchandise about it out of nowhere.

354
00:20:28,441 --> 00:20:28,682
Speaker 0: the way

355
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:48,288
Speaker 1: I described it originally after I'd watch a little bit of it was that take Adventure Time and pare it down to the essence of semi-random and humor like remove even the the Small framing story that season 1 episodes of Adventure Time had remove even that And that was what bravest warriors was.

356
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:55,960
Speaker 1: but then it did the same thing Adventure Time did and got Increasingly plotty and serious and all these threads kind of came together.

357
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,720
Speaker 1: But yet it didn't lose that start in the middle of something without any introduction or explanation.

358
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,685
Speaker 1: Aspect that has got going for it.

359
00:21:02,865 --> 00:21:07,020
Speaker 0: pretty much every episode no matter what it has is some sort of monster of the week.

360
00:21:07,382 --> 00:21:08,126
Speaker 0: But it's they're not.

361
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,500
Speaker 0: you're usually not monsters, right?

362
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:19,976
Speaker 0: It's usually like like take for example the episode where they have to get the two Creatures that inhabit their butts to like fall in love during the whatever.

363
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:20,680
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

364
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,117
Speaker 0: It's like they're on a mission to save something or to help some alien somewhere, but it's very.

365
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:27,100
Speaker 0: it's actually pretty rare.

366
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,580
Speaker 0: I mean sometimes it is just go and shoot things like on a you know that kind of mission.

367
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:35,214
Speaker 0: But even episode one it's like oh is a time-traveling thing to deal with.

368
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,020
Speaker 0: what's the deal, right?

369
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,545
Speaker 0: There's a lot of time travel going on in general.

370
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:43,960
Speaker 1: I think what married me to the show was you're married now.

371
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:45,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, where should I send the gift?

372
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:49,192
Speaker 1: It was in that the first episode.

373
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:53,420
Speaker 1: when they come into the room You know there's like this time paradox loop happening.

374
00:21:53,902 --> 00:22:01,937
Speaker 1: And then when they come into the room and find themselves all dead in the room, and they're like yeah, nope I'm done Nothing to do with this.

375
00:22:04,183 --> 00:22:05,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's that kind of show mmm.

376
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:19,626
Speaker 1: But I think what's interesting is I like you and other people were watching it further before I watched it So I'd see like the tail end of an episode and normally like I remember I'd see snippets of Adventure Time like I saw Before I watched the show.

377
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:22,637
Speaker 1: I saw that like all the characters singing a song in front of a door.

378
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:28,300
Speaker 1: it looked really good But it looked like there'd been a whole bunch of character development and build up that led to that moment.

379
00:22:28,921 --> 00:22:36,021
Speaker 1: So it felt like that's something that happens later in a show like this and then watching the show again and seeing all the build-up To that.

380
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:39,413
Speaker 1: like that added a lot to it with this show.

381
00:22:39,433 --> 00:22:57,759
Speaker 1: if you catch the end of an episode and Then later you see the entire series there what that little bit you caught at the end of the episode is basically it Like I saw the bit about the paralyzed horse and then when I saw that whole episode I was like oh that was just in that one episode like just in that one part.

382
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,125
Speaker 0: Have you seen all of season two?

383
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,939
Speaker 0: I think I'm one episode behind okay, because there's more paralyzed horse then.

384
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:05,905
Speaker 1: okay I'm one episode behind spoil.

385
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:07,411
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like take for it.

386
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:08,575
Speaker 0: It's weird.

387
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:21,980
Speaker 0: I'd like in Adventure time I guess because it's longer because they have more episodes right they can really introduce something and Recurrent a bunch before bringing it back right, but like wanker shim, which is a big fucking deal.

388
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,251
Speaker 0: It's always been wanker sure, but it's like.

389
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,678
Speaker 0: when did he first appear in?

390
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:34,959
Speaker 0: The butter lettuce episode in the best in the hollow John which is the best episode And he's just a dude in the hollow John is like there's nothing about him.

391
00:23:35,401 --> 00:23:40,960
Speaker 0: Right when a jelly kid appear the episode with the losing memory every dog on the spaceship, right?

392
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:47,567
Speaker 0: and it's just oh, there's just some jelly kid on the thing and he ejects and There's nothing about him, but then later.

393
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:48,832
Speaker 0: It's like jelly kids.

394
00:23:48,872 --> 00:23:49,816
Speaker 0: suddenly a big deal.

395
00:23:49,856 --> 00:23:53,029
Speaker 0: this character that Didn't even have any building.

396
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:53,974
Speaker 0: It was just there.

397
00:23:54,296 --> 00:23:58,532
Speaker 0: like a second You know becomes like a whole episode later on or more.

398
00:23:58,552 --> 00:24:00,438
Speaker 1: yep, but oh, you're right.

399
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:08,913
Speaker 1: cuz adventure time I think it's just more episodes, and they fill in the details like this show Just is like the peaks along the way of what would be a show.

400
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,762
Speaker 1: you could have a show with the same pacing as adventure Time.

401
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:15,577
Speaker 1: that was just bravest warriors filling in all the time between those points.

402
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,780
Speaker 1: instead It's like they have this whole story, and they pick these points along the way, and they only animate those points.

403
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:22,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have some of the comics.

404
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:22,780
Speaker 0: I haven't read them.

405
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,870
Speaker 0: I'm curious if the comics are just more bravest warriors Or if they fill in a lot of those blanks in between.

406
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,673
Speaker 0: like are they Canon?

407
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:30,220
Speaker 1: I almost don't want them to one thing I?

408
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:38,496
Speaker 1: Like about bravest warriors that adventure time has its own lexicon like its own Language like P the way thin and people say things like that's Greece.

409
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:41,384
Speaker 0: algebraic Mathematical said that in a while.

410
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:43,470
Speaker 1: yeah lately Greece has been the thing.

411
00:24:43,972 --> 00:24:48,950
Speaker 1: I've been saying that lately myself, but in this show Instead of doing that with adjectives.

412
00:24:49,392 --> 00:24:52,342
Speaker 1: They've been doing it with straight-up nouns Mm-hmm.

413
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:58,760
Speaker 1: I mean they'll be they'll be like blah blah blah the calliope of space And they just use these terms that literally mean nothing.

414
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,966
Speaker 1: It's just the gobbledygook that you'd use in.

415
00:25:01,006 --> 00:25:06,380
Speaker 1: like Star Trek the next generation just applied whenever they needed some crab people nouns.

416
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:17,597
Speaker 0: I thought like a lot of the sort of Technologies that go on that they somehow keep consistent right like they all have these basically Pokemon holograms in these gym.

417
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:20,005
Speaker 1: that has zero Explanation right.

418
00:25:20,166 --> 00:25:23,500
Speaker 0: well, but they keep coming up and actually mattering a whole lot.

419
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:27,433
Speaker 0: And yeah, and holograms have like mad powers.

420
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:34,180
Speaker 0: apparently they can turn them into bazookas and wings And you know basically all these powers come from like these little pokemons that they have.

421
00:25:34,922 --> 00:25:35,603
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

422
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:38,210
Speaker 0: those things do a lot, but they're mostly there visually.

423
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:56,830
Speaker 0: they rarely draw attention to them except for I think once when they're introduced And maybe one other time they're just always there, and if you don't actually look it's like oh he you know Chris always has the B and Dan always has the dog and Bets is a cat and wallow is The Eagle Hawk thing.

424
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:02,815
Speaker 0: yeah, whatever it is right It's like if you're not paying close attention you won't realize that or just the little things like.

425
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:13,020
Speaker 1: all the characters are actually really well Developed, but you only see it through these little Snippet lenses like wallows got all those little animals hanging around him all the time like he collects little guys.

426
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:14,169
Speaker 0: He's also the doctor.

427
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:17,467
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm gonna Lee Even though he's the big guy.

428
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:20,300
Speaker 1: He's walls are way better than Zoidberg ever was it being a doctor.

429
00:26:22,482 --> 00:26:27,180
Speaker 1: The level of technology they possess is approaching culture level - well I think it's right.

430
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:31,593
Speaker 0: I guess the idea is that their parents were even better than them and we're like the real.

431
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:33,820
Speaker 0: what were they called the courageous battlers?

432
00:26:34,605 --> 00:26:36,397
Speaker 0: Right yeah, and they're they guess their parent.

433
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,219
Speaker 0: all this shit I think is their parents shit Which is why it's so fucking awesome.

434
00:26:39,781 --> 00:26:46,559
Speaker 0: And there's sort of like the half-assed people taking over for their parents and aren't as good and they often fail.

435
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:50,299
Speaker 0: So I guess that's where all their cool stuff comes from.

436
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:54,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, also just the level of technology in this world is pretty high.

437
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:57,746
Speaker 1: That's also true But the only other really interesting.

438
00:26:57,766 --> 00:26:59,633
Speaker 1: I mean the episodes are so short.

439
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:03,759
Speaker 0: if you they have a video That's watch all of season one in one video.

440
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,422
Speaker 0: It's an hour.

441

470
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,320
Speaker 0: Well, if they do it all at the same time that you're not multiplying 20 minutes times the number of people.

00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the the voice acting is top-notch.

00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, that has.

477
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:28,340

Speaker 0: emotion.

480
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,500
Speaker 0: Lord shows up in like episode 2. so it's not like it grew the plot.

481
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,940
Speaker 1: It was always there, but the plot became more prevalent and the episodes got more serious.

482
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:42,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean like Merrif tag ended on a really bittersweet note.

483
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,359
Speaker 1: Also, the concierge is one of my favorite things.

484
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:48,179

486
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:59,300
Speaker 1: Yep It's one of those shows like some of those comics where you want to pay attention to all the weird little details going on in The background and all the weird little jokes.

487
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:07,090
Speaker 1: Like the dialogue is very well written and there's a lot of subtle humor in the dialogue That the show does not go out of its way to point out to you.

488
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:07,793
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
