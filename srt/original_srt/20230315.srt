1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,189
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, March 15th, 2023.

2
00:00:10,189 --> 00:00:10,510
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,260
Speaker 0: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,865
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:20,320
Speaker 1: We're reviewing the new animated show Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

6
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,120
Speaker 1: You may know them from Marvel's Snap.

7
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,878
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:44,860
Speaker 1: So uh, way back when Kickstarter like first came around, and even before Kickstarter, one thing that you and I were both into was having a really minimalist, thinnest possible wallet that wasn't like the traditional big ass leather George Costanza wallet.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:01:01,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I still have a really tiny wallet, but my hope these days is that uh, they will, Apple, well New York will be one of the states that has, you know, the driver's license in your Apple wallet and then, cause literally the only two cards left in my wallet

10
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,948
Speaker 1: I do have to carry a MetroCard for one reason.

11
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,839
Speaker 1: AirTrain, there's literally no other way to pay for it.

12
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,777
Speaker 0: But if I want to go take the AirTrain, I would just buy one there, boop.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,939
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, so uh, fun fact, when I was going to London for this work trip, uh, I took the AirTrain and I get there.

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:31,376
Speaker 1: Every station, every machine that you could buy a MetroCard at, anywhere in that subway station at the end of the line where you get on the AirTrain, especially the ones that are near.

15
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:36,512
Speaker 1: the actual AirTrain entrance had like 10 to 15 people in line.

16
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:44,300
Speaker 1: It was like a mob you had to force your way through because nobody had MetroCards and nobody understood it and it was a gigantic shit show.

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,064
Speaker 1: The only reason I was able to get through that massive crowd is cause I happened to have a MetroCard in my wallet that I didn't even know I had.

18
00:01:52,124 --> 00:01:54,372
Speaker 1: that I found when I dug through my wallet.

19
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:58,077
Speaker 1: It was like stuck between two credit cards and I happened to have some money on it.

20
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the AirTrain fare has increased to $825, right?

21
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,500
Speaker 1: Which is a weird, non-round number that I hate even more.

22
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,993
Speaker 0: Right, but let's say I'm about to go and use the AirTrain, right?

23
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:14,360
Speaker 1: Being a wise New Yorker Oh yeah, you go to a MetroCard other than the one in Jamaica, like obviously.

24
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:24,220
Speaker 0: Right, I would just, while I'm about to get on the E, I would go pick up a 1650 MetroCard precisely So London, similarly, they got something like Omniknight.

25
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,943
Speaker 1: Then I would throw it out In London.

26
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:29,500
Speaker 1: now, you just swipe a credit card or an iWatch or whatever just like you do in New York.

27
00:02:29,962 --> 00:02:35,696
Speaker 1: So I have a bunch of OysterCards with money on them, so I'm just using them every time I go to London until they run out of money.

28
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:36,715
Speaker 0: Yep.

29
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:45,500
Speaker 1: But, so anyway, I decided because I had, we had those plastic wallets that we bought that I think we reviewed on Geek Nights and like made a big deal of that.

30
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,180
Speaker 0: That was a super long time ago, the plastic wallets Yep, I still have one of those.

31
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:53,580
Speaker 1: I use it as my, I call it my stash wallet or my secondary wallet.

32
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:58,660
Speaker 1: All the cards that I need to keep but I don't need to carry every day are actually in that other wallet.

33
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,100
Speaker 0: No, I have them in a Ziploc bag, I don't know.

34
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:06,760
Speaker 1: But, well I kickstarted a wallet a long, long time ago that I've been using like this whole time.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,218
Speaker 1: I've been using this wallet for a long, long time and I really liked it, it was super minimalist Had that little carbon money clip on the end.

36
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:15,895
Speaker 1: I got a new credit card.

37
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:20,360
Speaker 1: recently I actually got a new card, like an Amex to get some rewards and all that biz.

38
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:31,980
Speaker 1: And I did a purge of my wallet and I discovered that I could reduce what was in my wallet by more than 50% And what I, but the prime, that was fine, that was great.

39
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:41,660
Speaker 1: The wallet I had kickstarted was so old and had slowly sagged and expanded because of the leather and time and my butt.

40
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cards, cards fell out if you didn't put them up in there.

41
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:51,940
Speaker 1: I took all the cards out of the wallet, I set the wallet on the table And a credit card just like popped out of the wallet and fell on the floor.

42
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,020
Speaker 1: And I was like, that can't stand, that's going to be a big problem immediately.

43
00:03:57,562 --> 00:04:08,400
Speaker 1: So I bought what I hope is the last wallet I ever own And I found a really, really good wallet that is made of metal And it's only designed to carry a very small number of cards.

44
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:09,440
Speaker 0: Doesn't even have a money clip.

45
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,180
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of those.

46
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:18,040
Speaker 1: When we were early geek nights at those plastic wallets There were two, there was like that plastic wallet and one other company making a plastic wallet.

47
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:22,500
Speaker 0: The small wallet was like a brand new, I mean I'm sure it wasn't brand new.

48
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,400
Speaker 0: There had probably been some in the past because grandpa's all had money clips and whatever.

49
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:38,820
Speaker 0: But it's like the small wallet that only held a few cards and not like 100 photos of your whole family And a plastic window for your license and a whole area, a billfold area.

50
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:45,580
Speaker 0: Every single wallet I had up until then was that style The old style that held every fucking thing in the universe.

51
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:50,320
Speaker 1: I used to keep like five checks in my wallet just in case I needed a check.

52
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,439
Speaker 0: The small ones were just becoming a thing.

53
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:57,874
Speaker 0: We were ahead of the curve And now there's just hundreds of them, 10 to 1000 different choices.

54
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:00,339
Speaker 0: They're all pretty much the same.

55
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:13,380
Speaker 0: But I'm hoping that yes, the only two cards that are left in my wallet Even my insurance cards are in my phone now Are my driver's license, which New York could partner with Apple to get it in the Apple Wallet.

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,180
Speaker 0: Oh they could But they haven't.

57
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:17,319
Speaker 0: And then I have a credit card in there.

58
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:24,260
Speaker 0: But that credit card is also in Apple Pay And I very, very, very, very, very rarely actually have to swipe the card.

59
00:05:26,983 --> 00:05:30,380
Speaker 1: I actually don't even need to carry this wallet and I would be fine most days.

60
00:05:30,647 --> 00:05:37,340
Speaker 0: Yeah The only other exception is FSA card Which I was able to add the FSA card to Apple Pay.

61
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:43,360
Speaker 1: Whoa I would never have believed that would actually work Because FSA cards are all weird on the back end.

62
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 0: That's exactly right.

63
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:45,600
Speaker 0: So I added it to Apple Pay.

64
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:47,740
Speaker 0: It showed up in the Apple Wallet just fine.

65
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,498
Speaker 1: That is amazing.

66
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,220
Speaker 1: Honestly I am astonished by that.

67
00:05:51,686 --> 00:05:53,400
Speaker 0: I'm not done yet You're not letting me finish.

68
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,498
Speaker 0: I tried to go and actually use it.

69
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:58,779
Speaker 1: Okay Okay I'm less astonished.

70
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,680
Speaker 0: It showed up even the right picture.

71
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,560
Speaker 0: The picture in Apple Pay matched.

72
00:06:03,662 --> 00:06:04,740
Speaker 0: It looked like the card.

73
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:05,912
Speaker 1: I got so excited.

74
00:06:05,953 --> 00:06:06,579
Speaker 0: I thought it worked.

75
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,399
Speaker 0: There was no indication that it wasn't going to work.

76
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:14,579
Speaker 0: And then when I tried to use it It wanted like a PIN number And it's like it was fighting with me.

77
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,139
Speaker 0: And I was like what the fuck is this?

78
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,220
Speaker 0: Why isn't it just working?

79
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:24,900
Speaker 0: And I was like Now if I have to go buy an FSA thing I bring the actual card Which does not even have a chip in it.

80
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,610
Speaker 0: You have to swipe it like it's 19 2000 something.

81
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,499
Speaker 0: So Nothing much I can do about that But I use that so rarely.

82
00:06:34,964 --> 00:06:36,400
Speaker 0: It doesn't need to live in the wallet.

83
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,500
Speaker 1: So I did my research.

84
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:48,380
Speaker 1: I looked around and I found what I think Is the best possible wallet And I really hope This is the last wallet I ever Own in my life.

85
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,199
Speaker 1: It's made of metal.

86
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:50,500
Speaker 1: I think it'll last forever.

87
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,958
Speaker 1: It's way thin It's way comfy.

88
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,958
Speaker 1: It's called the Vulkit And based on all my research I'm just going to say I think it's the best one.

89
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,260
Speaker 1: There were some that all Looked equivalent but they were way more expensive.

90
00:07:02,887 --> 00:07:11,799
Speaker 1: And there were some that looked equivalent That were so cheap With brand names that I did not trust That were only sold on Amazon And didn't seem to have websites That I also did not trust.

91
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,498
Speaker 1: This seems to be like the perfect storm of money And it's pretty good.

92
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:17,458
Speaker 0: Yeah.

93
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,198
Speaker 1: So also It's finally warm.

94
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,498
Speaker 1: I biked home from work today.

95
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,359
Speaker 0: How warm could it be?

96
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:27,379
Speaker 0: It's like 45 out It's 43, that's cold.

97
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:29,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's bike weather That's cold.

98
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:42,640
Speaker 1: That is, let's bike to Poughkeepsie Let's go, it's biking and hiking season That's, don't even go outside At 43 At Fahrenheit Which is Ah yes, Fahrenheit.

99
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:45,379
Speaker 1: So I got 6 degrees.

100
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:58,275
Speaker 1: I did get a bunch of European co-workers to come around On the whole Fahrenheit vs Celsius thing And with one exception One of my teams over in Germany They all agreed, they're like Oh, Fahrenheit actually makes more sense And they're like kinda into it.

101
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:58,458
Speaker 1: now.

102
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:08,940
Speaker 1: Okay They like the argument of It's a scale from 0 to 100 And 100 is really hot and 0 is dangerously cold And it's the human scale of temperature.

103
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:09,913
Speaker 1: And they were kinda into that.

104
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,960
Speaker 1: But anyway I got a little mini Geek bite of something I did not watch Which I think this is more.

105
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,480
Speaker 0: How can you geek bite something you didn't watch?

106
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,480
Speaker 0: Isn't that just prejudice?

107
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,599
Speaker 1: I mean I did this once, long ago.

108
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:33,518
Speaker 1: You might remember an anime that was popular For a few minutes called Attack on Titan That had a really great first season And then kinda just goes nowhere And isn't worth watching at all after that point.

109
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:37,880
Speaker 1: So there was an anime we were watching Way back, we watched one season of it.

110
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,940
Speaker 1: We even reviewed it Made in Abyss.

111
00:08:40,923 --> 00:08:45,357
Speaker 1: And the only things you need to know about Made in Abyss Are the person who made.

112
00:08:45,377 --> 00:08:49,380
Speaker 1: the manga Is definitely A bad person who likes bad things.

113
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,240
Speaker 1: I think I can elaborate on that.

114
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:56,099
Speaker 1: You can look at this thing And you will know exactly what I mean.

115
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:57,360
Speaker 1: This is bad stuff.

116
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:58,919
Speaker 1: This is definitely a bad person.

117
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:01,699
Speaker 0: It's a bunny drop scenario.

118
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:08,720
Speaker 1: Yup And the anime was Way less of that Than the manga.

119
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,859
Speaker 1: Though if I had known what was in the manga Before I had watched the anime I don't think I would have even watched the anime.

120
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,959
Speaker 1: But we're here, we watched that first season And it was alright, not the worst.

121
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,960
Speaker 1: I was moderately intrigued by the usual Terrible secrets.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,940
Speaker 0: Not the worst, I think you liked it a lot more.

123
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,679
Speaker 0: If we go back and listen to the episode You're probably like, oh this is great.

124
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:31,919
Speaker 1: Well, I'm pretty sure I actually did go back and listen to some of that episode Because I have.

125
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:40,680
Speaker 1: I put a bunch of our anime reviews on YouTube a long time ago Like a few years ago During COVID when I was bored And we were both really into it.

126
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:49,283
Speaker 1: But we also both spent like 15 minutes Talking about how we think the creator is creepy And how the show Is like right on the line Of.

127
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:52,859
Speaker 1: maybe nobody should watch this And maybe we should just burn this creator's works.

128
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:57,637
Speaker 0: Well, maybe the listener will go back To that episode and verify For him is lying or not.

129
00:09:58,992 --> 00:09:59,620
Speaker 0: I'm too lazy.

130
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,140
Speaker 1: I was vaguely curious.

131
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:06,260
Speaker 1: Just like with Attack on Titan, I wanted to know what was in the basement And turns out the answer sucks.

132
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:09,620
Speaker 1: I kind of want to know What's at the bottom of the abyss.

133
00:10:10,185 --> 00:10:20,259
Speaker 1: I am confident the answer sucks But the reason I'm warning all of you is If you had any intention Of watching the newer Season of this show.

134
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:33,859
Speaker 1: A friend of ours Said some words About what happens In part of this season And I looked at a wiki and confirmed Unless you are really into Underage anal glands.

135
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,682
Speaker 1: Do not watch Made in Abyss season 2.

136
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:42,340
Speaker 1: Just assume that it is Not to be seen That the show just was never made.

137
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:50,560
Speaker 0: Just forget about it Alright, well those three words Have definitely turned me off From watching that show ever again.

138
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:57,240
Speaker 1: I read a couple paragraphs of a wiki And those were the least Disturbing three words in that paragraph.

139
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,150
Speaker 1: I'm done Do not engage.

140
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,100
Speaker 0: So I guess the manga creeped into the anime even more.

141
00:11:05,141 --> 00:11:05,760
Speaker 0: Is what you're saying.

142
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,620
Speaker 1: I think that was inevitable.

143
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,473
Speaker 0: It's not inevitable.

144
00:11:11,183 --> 00:11:12,640
Speaker 0: You can do a full on rewrite.

145
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,731
Speaker 0: It's like back in the day.

146
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:17,240
Speaker 0: we used to complain That the anime versions of things were nothing like the manga.

147
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,080
Speaker 0: It's like the anime is nothing Like Ghost in the Shell.

148
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:26,399
Speaker 0: The animated versions of things Were like huge divergences From the original source material.

149
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,239
Speaker 1: But sometimes, like with Trigun That is literally just better.

150
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,360
Speaker 0: That's another great example.

151
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,200
Speaker 0: But then, you got these cases.

152
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,299
Speaker 0: It seems like the past decade or so.

153
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:42,500
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of the animes Are very, very just literal Reproductions of the manga.

154
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:46,660
Speaker 1: And it's like, on the one hand You want a monster manga as an anime.

155
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,920
Speaker 1: Guess what, it is literally just monster Scene for scene, line for line, shot for shot.

156
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:52,215
Speaker 1: That sucks, doesn't it?

157
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,327
Speaker 0: Right, it's like.

158
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:58,580
Speaker 0: on the one hand I have this purist Urge of like a nerd.

159
00:11:58,782 --> 00:12:02,240
Speaker 0: It's like I see something like a Spiderman movie And they'll change something.

160
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:09,120
Speaker 0: It's like Spiderman has biological webs Instead of a device The web shooter device that he makes.

161
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:16,160
Speaker 0: And it's like, I'm mad about that But it's like, it doesn't need to be Frame for frame the exact same thing As a Spiderman comic.

162
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,359
Speaker 0: Because then what's the purpose of even making it?

163
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,100
Speaker 0: I've already read that.

164
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,920
Speaker 0: Why would I read it again?

165
00:12:23,462 --> 00:12:34,614
Speaker 1: There is a window that's not explored here And that window is what a few of those High budget But brief anime OAVs Would do in the 90s and early 2000s.

166
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:35,541
Speaker 1: Where?

167
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:43,339
Speaker 1: what if you just faithfully recreate Some scenes from a manga But you animate the ever living fuck out of them?

168
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:46,519
Speaker 1: You can do that And that's fine, I'm down with that.

169
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:58,440
Speaker 0: The other thing you can do is If you really care about Purism and sticking to the canon Don't make your adaptation a retelling.

170
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:05,795
Speaker 0: Make your adaptation An additional story In the same universe With the same characters.

171
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,148
Speaker 0: possibly It's almost like.

172
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:14,318
Speaker 0: Obviously you wouldn't want to make it A sequel to the manga Because the people who haven't read the manga Can't watch it.

173
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:24,860
Speaker 0: But you can definitely make A side deal Or something that would still be Entriable For people who haven't read it.

174
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,657
Speaker 1: We've talked about it on Geek Nights a lot.

175
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:38,520
Speaker 1: Sometimes if the source material Is S tier Then remakes of it Are just going to be a Degraded form of it in some way.

176
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:44,740
Speaker 1: Like Monster, no matter how good it is That manga is just like A work of art to be treasured by humanity.

177
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:51,080
Speaker 1: And that's not it But something that's not actually That good, like say the Trigun manga.

178
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:56,218
Speaker 1: The perfect storm Is when you take the good parts out of it And you just rewrite the rest.

179
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:14,720
Speaker 0: Well the other thing is that You can sometimes Even if you don't really change Too much from the source material You can enhance If your medium The way you tell the story In the different medium is transformative enough That it can be worthwhile.

180
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:21,220
Speaker 0: For example You have Initial D the manga But Initial D the anime Is basically the same fucking thing.

181
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:22,986
Speaker 0: It's really close Except Eurobeat.

182
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:28,458
Speaker 0: It's like you added some value With that Eurobeat in there.

183
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:36,179
Speaker 0: That actually then Feeds and enhances It's existence enhances the manga Because now someone goes to read the manga.

184
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,532
Speaker 0: Eurobeat plays If you just read the manga.

185
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:48,860
Speaker 0: before the anime existed No Eurobeat would play When you read the manga But now you open up to any page And music plays.

186
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,671
Speaker 1: So The moral of this is Do not watch any more Made in Abyss However much you watch.

187
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:57,532
Speaker 1: just declare bankruptcy On that and move on.

188
00:14:59,088 --> 00:14:59,618
Speaker 1: Got any news?

189
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:11,032
Speaker 0: Yeah so The NHL and Disney Did a thing right because Hockey is on ESPN now And it was a really New thing.

190
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:11,900
Speaker 0: it happened yesterday.

191
00:15:12,505 --> 00:15:17,840
Speaker 0: I was at in person at Madison Square Garden At the actual hockey game.

192
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:21,045
Speaker 0: That was the one that went with this Thing.

193
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:27,130
Speaker 0: so what they did is apparently There's some kids cartoon on Disney Something called Big City Greens.

194
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,300
Speaker 0: I never heard of this show before.

195
00:15:28,421 --> 00:15:30,339
Speaker 0: If it wasn't for this I still wouldn't know about the show.

196
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,100
Speaker 0: I don't know about the show.

197
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,950
Speaker 0: It's a kids show Kids cartoon.

198
00:15:34,273 --> 00:15:34,960
Speaker 0: it exists right.

199
00:15:35,888 --> 00:15:47,200
Speaker 0: And what they did Is for this one NHL game that was on ESPN Right yesterday March 14th They took The tracking data.

200
00:15:47,341 --> 00:15:54,840
Speaker 0: There's already tracking data for basically Every NHL game in the players Equipment and in The puck right.

201
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,298
Speaker 0: They just have it already.

202
00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,006
Speaker 0: so They didn't add anything new To that.

203
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:14,084
Speaker 0: but what they did is they Collected that data in real time something They were already doing for every game And they fed it into Basically a video game Effectively speaking As the controller inputs Right.

204
00:16:14,104 --> 00:16:18,104
Speaker 0: so each player by playing Hockey without even thinking about This.

205
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:22,265
Speaker 0: other thing that was happening Right was unknowing To them.

206
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:26,188
Speaker 0: I guess they might have known About it but that's not like they were thinking about it While they were playing.

207
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,080
Speaker 0: they were just playing hockey.

208
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:41,440
Speaker 0: But Their body movements and the Location of the puck were the Inputs into a video game And in the video game There were basically Representations of many of the players.

209
00:16:41,863 --> 00:16:46,752
Speaker 0: Some of the players the goalies and a couple others Were replaced by characters From the cartoon show.

210
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,006
Speaker 0: I don't know who got Replaced.

211
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:48,819
Speaker 0: besides the goalies.

212
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,974
Speaker 1: I don't actually know anything about the show.

213
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:51,819
Speaker 1: Big City Greens.

214
00:16:52,062 --> 00:16:53,200
Speaker 0: I mean I said that already.

215
00:16:54,804 --> 00:17:05,175
Speaker 0: They had different Commentators so Kevin Weeks and Someone else I think were commentating This video game As opposed to commentating on the Actual game.

216
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:05,500
Speaker 0: there was.

217
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,367
Speaker 0: There was a normal broadcast of the game on ESPN Also right but on Disney Disney XD.

218
00:17:10,388 --> 00:17:12,958
Speaker 0: I think you could watch On ESPN Plus also.

219
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:23,685
Speaker 0: They basically had an alternate Broadcast of the game where instead of Watching video footage of the game You were watching this video game To which the inputs were the real Players.

220
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,958
Speaker 0: so the game played out The same way as it played in real life Except for the referee.

221
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:38,780
Speaker 0: that was Also a chicken that Would disappear and reappear To do puck puck drops and disappear Again and Could only say buck buck buck buck.

222
00:17:39,144 --> 00:17:40,500
Speaker 0: And it was pretty cute chicken.

223
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,136
Speaker 1: It was overall pretty cool.

224
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,760
Speaker 1: I love This idea of telemetry driven visualization.

225
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:50,600
Speaker 0: Yeah so the graphics Of it were you know you look At it and you're like wow that's not great right.

226
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,825
Speaker 0: And there was even a big goal where like the Puck teleported and teleported Right.

227
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,111
Speaker 0: it was like everyone's making jokes like that's Offsides.

228
00:17:57,152 --> 00:18:05,065
Speaker 0: maybe Right you know but You know for as much as people were Like ah this is stupid right whatever I think.

229
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:11,898
Speaker 0: actually the Response to this not just from You know there were those kind of fans who were like Ah this is dumb it's not funny.

230
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:24,899
Speaker 1: The article I found all the comments You know the part of the internet you should never look at On a website are old men who were like If the NHL wants to grow the game They shouldn't do this technological mumbo Jumbo kids are distracted with their phones.

231
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,663
Speaker 0: Right it's like You know.

232
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:27,653
Speaker 0: am I gonna watch this?

233
00:18:28,158 --> 00:18:29,553
Speaker 0: No Right why would I watch this?

234
00:18:29,573 --> 00:18:31,378
Speaker 1: I watched a few minutes Of it just to see if it worked.

235
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,432
Speaker 0: Yeah but the point is is that Was it successful?

236
00:18:35,654 --> 00:18:50,020
Speaker 0: I don't have the numbers So I can't say how to what degree It was successful but anecdotally There were people Who said that their kids Were into it and Wanted to watch the whole thing And those kids would not sit.

237
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,440
Speaker 0: Their kids were not you know watching Regular hockey games right.

238
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:55,594
Speaker 0: So that's a positive.

239
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:05,918
Speaker 0: And secondly Secondly the hockey people Right in the you know like Even though you know in advance They might have been grumbly grumbly.

240
00:19:06,907 --> 00:19:13,959
Speaker 0: In the social media Among hockey fans A lot of people were posting Clips from this game.

241
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:17,917
Speaker 0: Right the video game version Like everyone wanted to see.

242
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,299
Speaker 0: like oh What did that goal look like?

243
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:20,789
Speaker 0: They're like.

244
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:32,040
Speaker 0: you know I was at the game and there was actually a great play Where You know Igor the goalie Had an assist right with a big long pass And so everyone was like.

245
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:36,060
Speaker 0: I think there was a character called Granny Or something that was taking the place of Igor.

246
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:43,679
Speaker 1: I might have caused A minor disturbance In our Blaze in the Dark game because I had the game on On the other monitor and that happened.

247
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,520
Speaker 0: Yeah I forgot to view myself But everyone was like oh Granny with the huge assist.

248
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:55,500
Speaker 0: Oh right it's like This was you know in its really Somewhat you know shabby Implementation.

249
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,573
Speaker 0: Pretty good Right you know.

250
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:03,398
Speaker 0: it made a bigger Splash than anticipated at least Within hockey circle.

251
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:07,620
Speaker 0: Cool thing to do And this was only the first one.

252
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:09,659
Speaker 1: This was like baby's first MVP.

253
00:20:11,089 --> 00:20:12,140
Speaker 0: You give this shit.

254
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:20,974
Speaker 0: A few years and like this is gonna be Some hot stuff Right And I think it'll be pretty exciting Actually.

255
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:28,382
Speaker 1: so It's interesting because I remember way back when I was a kid We went to some like Red Wings Fan access event Cause.

256
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:29,189
Speaker 1: you know my family.

257
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:33,859
Speaker 1: we were like really into hockey My mom and brother even way more than me And you're hitting autographs and stuff.

258
00:20:34,144 --> 00:20:48,460
Speaker 1: And they had a little exhibit Where you would sit there you put on headphones And you would hear A hockey game commentary like an old hockey game And you would have to draw In a series of little like storyboards What the fuck happened in these plays.

259
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:56,020
Speaker 1: And then You would see the video of what was Actually being commented on to see how accurate You were based on hearing the commentary.

260
00:20:56,444 --> 00:21:04,320
Speaker 1: And the thing that always struck me about hockey Was that The only thing that a lot of people would get wrong Is they'd have like the left side or the right side wrong.

261
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,378
Speaker 1: But in terms of how the play evolved You can.

262
00:21:07,884 --> 00:21:11,536
Speaker 1: You know a lot about what's going on Just from that very simple commentary.

263
00:21:11,576 --> 00:21:14,679
Speaker 1: that's leaving A lot of information out At least on a broad level.

264
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:20,059
Speaker 1: I bet you could even train an AI model to listen to commentary And animate a hockey game pretty well.

265
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,000
Speaker 0: I think that you know.

266
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,245
Speaker 0: The final form of this Really is just full VR sports right where a person Isn't on ice they're not wearing Skates.

267
00:21:30,306 --> 00:21:31,317
Speaker 0: they're not right.

268
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:39,660
Speaker 0: it's like They're just somewhere where there's Enough tracking on their bod Right and they make the movements And they're wearing some kind of goggles.

269
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,859
Speaker 0: So it looks like hockey to them Right but they're really just playing a video game.

270
00:21:44,548 --> 00:21:50,160
Speaker 1: There is already Installation level tennis where you have A person on each side of a full sized tennis court.

271
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,699
Speaker 0: There's golf simulators.

272
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:57,407
Speaker 1: Yeah no you have people standing on the On either side of a full sized indoor tennis court Wearing VR helmets but not Consumer.

273
00:21:57,468 --> 00:22:09,092
Speaker 1: this is like installation VR where it's using the room And like it's not technology we could get And you run at full speed And play for real tennis But you're in a virtual fucked up World.

274
00:22:10,405 --> 00:22:13,309
Speaker 0: I don't see the Point of that though?

275
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:18,300
Speaker 1: Well cause there's like pits don't fall In them and there's stuff happening and it's Oh okay it's not.

276
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,219
Speaker 1: It's not just like You put on the VR helmet and everything looks the same.

277
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,480
Speaker 0: It's VR Mario Tennis.

278
00:22:24,521 --> 00:22:25,260
Speaker 0: That's what you're saying.

279
00:22:27,523 --> 00:22:42,499
Speaker 1: This also For sportspectation like imagine Just if you had a VR headset If you could buy a really cheap hockey Ticket and just watch the game like you're Sitting in the front row or sitting in any fucking Seat you want or you're in Igor Shostakin watching what he sees.

280
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,979
Speaker 0: Right it's like they.

281
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:49,596
Speaker 0: Instead of having to put cameras All over they just need to put enough Tracking yeah telemetry.

282
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:52,540
Speaker 0: And then for the broadcast of the game.

283
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,469
Speaker 0: It's like right now.

284
00:22:53,732 --> 00:23:04,680
Speaker 0: you know if you're watching A live broadcast of a sporting event They can only put cameras You know in certain places right It's like they have to not block the views of the Spectators they have to not get in the way of the players.

285
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,819
Speaker 0: They can only go where they're like mountable.

286
00:23:07,225 --> 00:23:08,340
Speaker 0: Right it's like this limit.

287
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:22,924
Speaker 0: You know how big is the camera that they're putting in different Places and you know you can't just Put cameras in you know but with if you Have if you're just recreating the Game exactly in a Digital world you can just put A camera in fucking anywhere because the camera is Virtual.

288
00:23:22,965 --> 00:23:27,066
Speaker 1: yeah right and telemetry data Is cheap like if any of you are video gamers because This is Wednesday.

289
00:23:27,107 --> 00:23:28,280
Speaker 1: we don't talk about this stuff that much.

290
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:38,720
Speaker 1: When you're playing an FPS with a bunch of other people The only data that's Going back and forth between these clients Is the telemetry data of where all the Objects are and how they're interacting.

291
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:43,558
Speaker 1: Every end point is Rendering a view based on that Pure telemetry data.

292
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:45,995
Speaker 0: So yeah I think that this is.

293
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:48,056
Speaker 0: you know Most people don't have any idea.

294
00:23:48,097 --> 00:23:51,914
Speaker 0: this even Happened but this is Like a first of its kind deal.

295
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:54,035
Speaker 0: it happened Yesterday while we were at the game.

296
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:58,863
Speaker 0: they were showing Some clips of it on the scoreboard In the arena after the Fact.

297
00:23:58,964 --> 00:23:59,530
Speaker 1: but a good idea.

298
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:04,844
Speaker 0: this is Sort of like you know if you think about like Hatsune Miku version 1 and where it is Today.

299
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:08,035
Speaker 0: like this is gonna Evolve right along that.

300
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:15,530
Speaker 1: I think a lot Of people are distracted by all the AI, ML, GPT whatever nonsense Going on and people I think A lot of people aren't.

301
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:21,011
Speaker 1: They're drastically underestimating What this is and what it's Going to be.

302
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,559
Speaker 0: I'm hopeful for this right especially you know.

303
00:24:24,826 --> 00:24:28,935
Speaker 0: Yeah Maybe some kids out there are gonna Watch hockey.

304
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:30,980
Speaker 1: now We gotta get more people watching hockey.

305
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:39,859
Speaker 1: And last little news in case you were unaware You know Gkids the masters Of you wanna see some good animation In theaters in America.

306
00:24:40,944 --> 00:24:54,945
Speaker 1: They're doing once again this year Like in March End of March, April, May, June, July A bunch of the Ghibli movies Including the live action Spirited Away play Are just gonna be in theaters all over America.

307
00:24:54,965 --> 00:24:56,117
Speaker 0: well they do this.

308
00:24:56,197 --> 00:25:09,148
Speaker 0: they do This every year but the play is the New one because the basically the live Action you know theatrical Spirited Away is gonna be performed In Japan and there will be a Live stream of it to Movie theaters.

309
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,499
Speaker 1: you know in the US April 23rd and April 27th we can Just go see it at the start of Kauffman like right by us.

310
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:19,552
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm gonna probably go to the movie Theater nearby and you know watch It the same time.

311
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:26,218
Speaker 0: people in Japan Are in the theater seeing it right Which is uh People don't realize this.

312
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:26,480
Speaker 0: it's like.

313
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:26,905
Speaker 0: You know.

314
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,017
Speaker 0: I went to the.

315
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:31,320
Speaker 0: I've known for a while that they do the Fathom events.

316
00:25:32,683 --> 00:25:41,712
Speaker 0: Yeah basically one of the things that they do Also along similar lines is They'll show the Metropolitan Opera On the screen either live Or recorded.

317
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:47,920
Speaker 0: and It's like I went to the opera recently And that shit's expensive and a movie Ticket is way cheaper.

318
00:25:48,804 --> 00:25:52,360
Speaker 0: And it's like they don't sell a lot of DVDs of that or put it on YouTube.

319
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,068
Speaker 0: A lot right.

320
00:25:53,088 --> 00:25:57,673
Speaker 0: so um It's you know maybe there's pirates out there I guess probably.

321
00:25:57,693 --> 00:26:04,400
Speaker 0: but Um that's probably the least Expensive way to see It like value wise right.

322
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:12,599
Speaker 0: So if you don't have a world Class opera house where you live but you have A movie theater Maybe you should go to one of those.

323
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:13,896
Speaker 0: It would probably be worth it.

324
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:22,884
Speaker 1: But anyway things Of the day.

325
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:35,370
Speaker 1: so uh Do you ever wonder like On a modern ship like when we take the ferry Even uh over to uh Sandy Hook There's lifeboats you ever Wonder like how they work and what's in them And like what a modern boat looks like.

326
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,309
Speaker 0: Harry doesn't have a big fancy lifeboat like this.

327
00:26:37,572 --> 00:26:38,137
Speaker 1: Uh they have.

328
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:40,480
Speaker 1: they have some that are only A step down from this.

329
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:43,247
Speaker 1: they have the ones that Roll out from the side of the boat.

330
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:45,509
Speaker 1: I found this video.

331
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:48,426
Speaker 0: A lot of things have the inflatable ones A little triangle in front yep.

332
00:26:49,072 --> 00:26:56,590
Speaker 1: But uh imagine if you're on like a cruise ship in the middle of the Pacific And there's those gigantic Orange lifeboats the ones that are basically Just boats like.

333
00:26:57,774 --> 00:27:01,915
Speaker 1: I realized when I found this video I didn't know anything about them like I Couldn't.

334
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:05,596
Speaker 1: even I didn't even know what they looked like Inside how they worked Nothing.

335
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:06,806
Speaker 1: and this video.

336
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:07,674
Speaker 0: we've never been In one.

337
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:08,866
Speaker 1: why would you know why would you be?

338
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:16,240
Speaker 0: they're not gonna Let me unless you unless you had some boat training Or something right or I Guess to people when they go on cruises Never been on a cruise.

339
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,190
Speaker 0: they don't know they.

340
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:24,749
Speaker 1: They have a muster thing where all they do is make You stand where the lifeboats are gonna be And tell you that you might have to get into Them but they don't teach you anything about them.

341
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:41,509
Speaker 1: Okay I learned this because During COVID When for some reason capitalism Cruises were still happening Cruises didn't have to do that muster Because that got too many people together in the same place At the same time and they relatively recently Had to start doing that again.

342
00:27:42,136 --> 00:27:45,105
Speaker 1: And uh that's why I learned About this because that was in the news.

343
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:48,630
Speaker 1: and then I Found this video because I remembered like wait lifeboats The fuck's even in those?

344
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:54,422
Speaker 0: It seems like you know a cruise should do more Than like a flight but Oh you would think that.

345
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,097
Speaker 1: but uh no Cruises suck.

346
00:27:56,501 --> 00:27:58,116
Speaker 1: uh you know My feelings.

347
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,490
Speaker 1: on cruises you have similar feelings.

348
00:27:59,672 --> 00:28:01,249
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of going on a cruise.

349
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,030
Speaker 0: There are kinds of cruises that could be cool.

350
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:09,550
Speaker 0: I have thought about the buy a home On a cruise that goes around the world and you Spend three years of your life doing that and nothing else.

351
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:16,650
Speaker 1: I've also thought about just book a birth On a cargo ship and spend a month going Across the Pacific like kind of want to do that For real not even joking.

352
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,666
Speaker 0: I mean it depends on the.

353
00:28:18,787 --> 00:28:24,217
Speaker 0: you know You might go into it with uh rose colored Glasses and then you know a week in you're like That's enough of that.

354
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:26,910
Speaker 0: they're like well you're stuck in this Uncomfortable ass boat with us now.

355
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,939
Speaker 1: But worst case scenario one I know They're pretty comfortable.

356
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:45,969
Speaker 1: I've watched a bunch of Documentaries on this and two Oh no I have to just play Video games and hang out with Emily and drink And eat food and like Okay this is way Better than my working life And it costs like six dollars A day alright.

357
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:56,022
Speaker 1: Anyway So this is a video that will tell you what the deal Is with modern Lifeboats and it's Way cooler than I thought.

358
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:56,690
Speaker 1: there's a lot going on.

359
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,507
Speaker 0: There is a sponsor on this video.

360
00:28:58,527 --> 00:29:00,164
Speaker 0: I Dislike the sponsor.

361
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,306
Speaker 0: you should not Patronize the sponsor of the video.

362
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,770
Speaker 1: So the secret if you don't know This I assume Scott knows this.

363
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,022
Speaker 1: A lot of internet people know it.

364
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:11,478
Speaker 1: ad block Can block between ad block and just Paying for YouTube.

365
00:29:11,498 --> 00:29:14,848
Speaker 1: you don't see ads but That doesn't block the natural ad.

366
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:23,361
Speaker 1: read Where you're watching like a SciShow video And they pause for a second and then they're like Speaking of blah blah blah Brilliant something You know.

367
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:24,998
Speaker 1: the old timey ad read Can't?

368
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:26,029
Speaker 1: it's hard to block those.

369
00:29:26,756 --> 00:29:39,178
Speaker 1: The way you block those on YouTube Is if you've noticed if you hover Over the timeline on a modern YouTube video You see the heat map of what Parts of the video people have watched more or watched Over and over again.

370
00:29:39,198 --> 00:29:42,209
Speaker 1: and in any video With ad reads you'll see a huge hump.

371
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:46,469
Speaker 1: Occasionally that hump Is all the people trying to skip the ad read.

372
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:54,520
Speaker 1: So hover Over look for the hump Click on the end of the hump And you'll always be past the ad read Well you also.

373
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,864
Speaker 0: there's an extension I think With community submitted time Codes that will automatically skip The ads for you.

374
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:07,450
Speaker 0: but I just You know I just yeah Whenever an ad read starts I just click forward until it's gone.

375
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:13,727
Speaker 1: But the hump is the way to find it Especially if you watch weird videos that no one Bothered to put time codes in for where the ad reads are.

376
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:15,685
Speaker 1: So anyway what do you got?

377
00:30:17,036 --> 00:30:21,578
Speaker 0: So If you ever go see an old timey Silent film right You know.

378
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:28,830
Speaker 0: like if you Go on YouTube and look for a silent film It won't actually be Silent right?

379
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:29,334
Speaker 0: It's like.

380
00:30:29,354 --> 00:30:34,790
Speaker 0: yeah there's gonna be like title cards for all the Dialogue if there is any And you won't hear anyone talking.

381
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:41,049
Speaker 0: But there's like a little old timey Music playing like do do do do do do Like on a piano probably right.

382
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:47,810
Speaker 0: Maybe a few sound effects that whistle Like if there's a car It'll go like honk honk or a ooga.

383
00:30:48,275 --> 00:30:52,114
Speaker 0: Right it's like there's noises Going on even though it's a silent Film.

384
00:30:52,741 --> 00:30:54,196
Speaker 0: where were those noises Coming from?

385
00:30:54,237 --> 00:31:04,581
Speaker 0: well sometimes the noises Were coming from just people In the back right making noises Sometimes you know it depends on Where you saw the silent film and when and All kinds of things.

386
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:05,128
Speaker 0: but it's not like.

387
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:12,660
Speaker 1: It's not like they had a and they're just watching the movie With you and they're like they have a sheet that says Make the gunshot noise around this time And they watch the movie.

388
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,402
Speaker 1: they kind of just like Bang on something.

389
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:14,929
Speaker 0: yep.

390
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:21,190
Speaker 0: But there was apparently an instrument That I never knew about Until recently called the photo player.

391
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,543
Speaker 0: And what is a photo player?

392
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:33,390
Speaker 0: it's basically A non portable one man Band plus player piano in one Machine yep with a Very important addition Of the sound effects generators.

393
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:34,460
Speaker 0: Right.

394
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:39,210
Speaker 0: well so it's basically A player piano right With one additional modification.

395
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:40,380
Speaker 0: Is that you can?

396
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:41,712
Speaker 0: you can get Like.

397
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,569
Speaker 0: you can get two rolls going on there.

398
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:48,197
Speaker 0: So you can seamlessly go from roll one To roll two to roll three without a gap Because you can.

399
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:52,903
Speaker 0: you can get that because the role Of player piano music is Shorter than the movie right.

400
00:31:52,923 --> 00:31:57,169
Speaker 0: so you need to Be able to queue up rolls back and forth Between the two rollers right.

401
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:01,490
Speaker 0: And then it's got An organ in addition to a piano.

402
00:32:02,076 --> 00:32:03,065
Speaker 0: So it's a it's a it's.

403
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:07,788
Speaker 0: you know you got This one keyboard going but you can play the organ Or the piano or kind of both right.

404
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:10,602
Speaker 0: So you get all kinds of more Noises going on there.

405
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:17,510
Speaker 0: you know The main feature of the organ that the piano doesn't Have is sort of the infinite sustain Which you kind of need for a lot of things.

406
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:34,530
Speaker 0: And then You got foot pedals and pull Levers and all sorts of things because next To the piano organ Is a box and in that box you got a Drum and a cowbell And horns and Toot flutes and chimes And all sorts of fucking

407
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:37,290
Speaker 1: That you hear in a lot of old cartoons.

408
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:40,075
Speaker 0: Yeah just all sorts of fucking things In there.

409
00:32:40,337 --> 00:32:48,197
Speaker 0: right and the person operating Since the player piano role Is you know you could play the piano With your hands but the role is Taking care of that.

410
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:55,310
Speaker 0: you're using your hands To like change the organ settings You know and and pull the Things and honk the horns right.

411
00:32:55,654 --> 00:33:05,046
Speaker 0: And as long as you know if you know the film Well which you're if it's your job to Operate this instrument then yeah Yeah you're gonna do this over and over again Like a hundred times for every night.

412
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:09,330
Speaker 0: you probably You probably practice with the movie like once Or twice before you do it for real right?

413
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,765
Speaker 0: It's like the scene where the horn comes in.

414
00:33:10,785 --> 00:33:12,461
Speaker 0: you reach over And go honk honk right.

415
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:16,988
Speaker 0: if there's two Cars you use the second horn For car number two.

431
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:32,503

Speaker 0: Right whether it's baseball cards or board games Or comics or whatever.

433
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:36,949
Speaker 0: right.

434
00:34:37,655 --> 00:34:45,130
Speaker 0: If you are going to collect something And you are not Actually a museum Right you're just a person.

435
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:59,697
Speaker 0: You should aspire To be like Joe Renato Right who has collected A photo player Right but really has collected Knowledge of the photo player And shared it and acted as A museum.

436
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,728
Speaker 0: right if you just got A collection in your house it's like Uh I'm not a fan.

437
00:35:05,031 --> 00:35:06,989
Speaker 1: Indiana Jones has some words for you.

438
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:12,529
Speaker 0: That's right but if you do It the Joe Renato way right Then I'm going to be a huge fan.

439
00:35:12,953 --> 00:35:14,667
Speaker 0: Complete opposite right.

440
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:25,190
Speaker 0: so if You got a big ol' collection Of something right Start you know acting Like Joe Renato does with that collection And that would be totally awesome.

441
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:31,680
Speaker 1: In the meta moment The Geek Nights Book Club book Is the satanic Versus.

442
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:36,449
Speaker 1: having read The first couple of chapters This is an S tier book.

443
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:38,270

00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:48,528
Speaker 0: Satan is not The latest fan upon me.

448
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:52,210

Speaker 0: That's real soon.

455
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:22,829
Speaker 1: At 2.30pm eastern time in the Bumblebee Theater we will have a panel That very few people have seen And even the people Who have seen it saw an early Prototype version of it either at a Magfest where we did it once Or in the video that Magfest uploaded Or the patrons Saw an audio only version of it With the slides.

456
00:36:24,113 --> 00:36:26,624
Speaker 1: I've already been planning a lot of changes to this Before next week.

457
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:30,349
Speaker 1: Can competitive and casual coexist?

458
00:36:30,975 --> 00:36:33,522
Speaker 1: And the spoiler answer Is in the same game?

459
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:37,346
Speaker 0: Fuck no Absolutely not Probably not right.

460
00:36:37,386 --> 00:36:37,750
Speaker 0: it's tough.

461
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:41,210
Speaker 1: If you can make them coexist You will be a billionaire.

462
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:43,424
Speaker 0: Yeah it's one of those things where it's like.

463
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:44,696
Speaker 0: does P equal NP?

464
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:45,242
Speaker 0: and it's like?

465
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:47,222
Speaker 0: well you know I can't say for sure.

466
00:36:47,383 --> 00:36:49,664
Speaker 0: otherwise I'd be Like a zillionaire right?

467
00:36:49,745 --> 00:36:54,569
Speaker 0: I'll be famous Forever but we're pretty sure What the answer is right?

468
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:56,146
Speaker 1: Alright.

469
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,810
Speaker 1: so Marvel.

470
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:01,262
Speaker 1: As you know Marvel Marvel's made a bunch of stuff.

471
00:37:01,665 --> 00:37:02,190
Speaker 0: When's Marvel?

472
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:10,757
Speaker 1: So I'll be honest I wasn't familiar with The Moon Girl or I guess originally Moon Boy or Devil Dinosaur Like.

473
00:37:10,797 --> 00:37:13,402
Speaker 1: that was not a part of the Marvel universe I knew anything about.

474
00:37:13,422 --> 00:37:21,610
Speaker 0: I knew I knew that they were characters In Marvel comic books but I had never Read a single comic book or seen Anything that contained them.

475
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,057
Speaker 1: I don't think I knew that Devil Dinosaur Existed until I saw it in Marvel Snap.

476
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:35,810
Speaker 0: to be honest Devil Dinosaur is a character that I knew existed in the Marvel universe But I had never read even a single Comic book or seen any cartoon or any Anything that had Devil Dinosaur in it.

477
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:38,658
Speaker 0: I didn't even have a collectible card with Devil Dinosaur on it.

478
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:47,190
Speaker 0: but I knew there was a Marvel character called Devil Dinosaur And that character was indeed A literal dinosaur And that was the extent of my knowledge.

479
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:58,509
Speaker 1: I spent before this show About 45 seconds Reading about The origin of Devil Dinosaur And the origin of Moon Boy Which came before Moon Girl.

480
00:37:59,295 --> 00:38:00,565
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything about this.

481
00:38:00,605 --> 00:38:06,110
Speaker 0: so tell me All I knew was that they were characters That existed with those names in Marvel comics.

482
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:07,659
Speaker 0: The end So it's.

483
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:13,329
Speaker 1: I don't want to say it's bad But it's not good.

484
00:38:14,235 --> 00:38:16,710
Speaker 1: Okay It's Jack Kirby.

485
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:18,650
Speaker 1: Jack Kirby was the one who brought this out.

486
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,269
Speaker 1: This is 70's Marvel.

487
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:30,930
Speaker 1: Moon Boy is a Monkey man who comes from a Dinosaur planet And Devil Dinosaur is smarter than him And I lost interest after that point.

488
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:37,448
Speaker 1: So I don't actually know anything else Okay But they come from a planet where there's a bunch of terrible crap going on And it sucks.

489
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,129
Speaker 0: Maybe I will go read The first issue of Wherever that happens and know the deal.

490
00:38:44,194 --> 00:38:45,969
Speaker 1: That should only take me like Five minutes.

491
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:55,030
Speaker 1: So at least it is in it's own comic called Devil Dinosaur volume 1 Alright Written and drawn by Jack Kirby in 1978.

492
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,250
Speaker 0: Alright well I'm sure that I can read that In about five minutes.

493
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:12,670
Speaker 1: I don't think Literally anything From the entire history Of Moon Boy or Devil Dinosaur In any way matters to The modern Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

494
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,349
Speaker 0: They might as well be Completely separate things.

495
00:39:16,693 --> 00:39:23,887
Speaker 0: There's no way for me to know if there are Callbacks or connections Between the two obviously because I didn't even Know anything about the original.

496
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:26,510
Speaker 0: but If there are they don't matter.

497
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,050
Speaker 0: You don't need to know them And they might not even exist.

498
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:38,530
Speaker 1: The only other thing I learned which If you watch Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Is pretty apparent within about Four interactions with the Devil Dinosaur.

499
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:44,820
Speaker 1: Devil Dinosaur Is canonically as smart as or smarter Than a human like straight up Just day one.

500
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:46,648
Speaker 1: the Devil Dino Knows his shit.

501
00:39:48,295 --> 00:40:02,084
Speaker 1: So Marvel released Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur animated show And the cool thing is the First episode which is a straight Up Marvel origin Story of a character Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Two characters.

502
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,822
Speaker 1: I guess It's just free on YouTube.

503
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:05,670
Speaker 1: you can just watch it.

504
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:06,750
Speaker 1: It's like a double episode.

505
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,279
Speaker 1: The second episode of the show is also Just free on YouTube.

506
00:40:10,682 --> 00:40:12,620
Speaker 1: I think you have to subscribe To something to see more.

507
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:14,688
Speaker 1: but those two Episodes are just free.

508
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,510
Speaker 0: I imagine it's Disney Plus right?

509
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,297
Speaker 0: They're on Disney Plus?

510
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,045
Speaker 1: I don't know.

511
00:40:20,353 --> 00:40:23,309
Speaker 1: Okay I watched the free Episodes and then I stopped.

512
00:40:24,536 --> 00:40:30,264
Speaker 0: I watched one free Episode the big The big long first one And it's pretty good.

513
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:31,514
Speaker 1: there's a lot going On here.

514
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,010
Speaker 1: we're going to review it right now.

515
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:42,260
Speaker 0: There are eight episodes in one Season and It premiered on Disney Channel and was released On Disney Plus Five days after that.

516
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:43,187
Speaker 1: alright there we go.

517
00:40:44,158 --> 00:40:44,666
Speaker 1: You can watch.

518
00:40:44,707 --> 00:40:50,142
Speaker 1: at least You can watch 66 Minutes of this free And honestly.

519
00:40:50,485 --> 00:40:55,584
Speaker 1: if nothing else I think it's worth watching the first episode Cause one free like Who can't argue with that?

520
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:55,848
Speaker 1: and two.

521
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:59,898
Speaker 1: It's basically kind of a stand alone Movie.

522
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,569
Speaker 0: I think there might be 11 episodes If you watch that first episode.

523
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:04,710
Speaker 1: It's kind of a 44 minute like mini movie.

524
00:41:05,094 --> 00:41:10,890
Speaker 1: That ends at a pretty satisfying Place and if it's not your jam You can stop there and still be satisfied.

525
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:14,189
Speaker 1: I guess we can talk about.

526
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:17,235
Speaker 1: The plot is pretty Simple.

527
00:41:17,256 --> 00:41:20,163
Speaker 1: the show is definitely aimed at Young children like.

528
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:24,410
Speaker 1: it is Extremely simple Very straightforward.

529
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:26,970
Speaker 1: The dialogue is doing its job.

530
00:41:27,274 --> 00:41:28,127
Speaker 1: Is what I would say?

531
00:41:30,038 --> 00:41:34,087
Speaker 0: Ah so I'm reading about The moon girl comic from 2015.

532
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:42,102
Speaker 0: Ah And that is also I think significantly what I'm reading On Wikipedia at least is that There are also.

533
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:45,294
Speaker 0: it's significantly Different from what's happening in this Cartoon.

534
00:41:45,314 --> 00:41:47,313
Speaker 1: yeah so this cartoon what's The deal?

535
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:51,820
Speaker 1: we're in New York City Modern place Modern times.

536
00:41:52,224 --> 00:41:54,385
Speaker 1: Marvel universe Exists like all that.

537
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:56,809
Speaker 1: stuff is out There and Spiderman lives there.

538
00:41:57,011 --> 00:42:08,586
Speaker 1: Right yeah Marvel so and Moon girl just a cool girl Who is into science with a cool Family living in a Cool part of the city running a roller Rink which does not exist.

539
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:10,910
Speaker 0: there is no Roller rink in the Lower East Side no room.

540
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:11,346
Speaker 0: This is.

541
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:25,666
Speaker 1: The problem is I feel like The New York City portrayed here is the New York City from Into the Spiderverse the Not actual New York City Because that is a way cooler Lower East Side than what we got going on.

542
00:42:28,084 --> 00:42:29,483
Speaker 1: But Yeah she's there.

543
00:42:29,726 --> 00:42:30,658
Speaker 1: she's super Into science.

544
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,990
Speaker 1: she's super smart She's a secret Almost super hero.

545
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,919
Speaker 1: Who's going through?

546
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,723
Speaker 1: her origin story Coming of age?

547
00:42:38,743 --> 00:42:42,495
Speaker 0: basically Yeah basically it's a little bit Dexter's lab going On right.

548
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:49,060
Speaker 0: it's like she goes in her bedroom She goes in like the closet and it goes down Underneath to like an abandoned subway tunnel Or some shit.

549
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:51,490
Speaker 0: yup and she's got You know her shit down there right.

550
00:42:51,671 --> 00:42:56,799
Speaker 1: It is very obvious that her entire family Knows what she's up to and Approves like.

551
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,757
Speaker 1: that is that is Telegraph from a mile away That they all know the deal and She doesn't know.

552
00:43:02,798 --> 00:43:11,280
Speaker 1: her family knows because she's A naive child but Everyone knows and she's basically Living in the cool Lower East Side The cool family.

553
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:20,556
Speaker 1: it's a pretty Good representation of an idealized New York City though it's Not a hundred percent real Because there's a bodega that's called A bodega.

554
00:43:20,879 --> 00:43:23,201
Speaker 1: now that's bodegas In New York don't have names.

555
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:27,726
Speaker 0: unless you look at city Records and those names they do have a name Sometimes printed on the awning.

556
00:43:27,787 --> 00:43:28,736
Speaker 0: sometimes No one calls.

557
00:43:28,837 --> 00:43:33,470
Speaker 0: nobody calls them by the Name that they have on there and there's Often a real name.

558
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:39,350
Speaker 1: And the name of a business Is they Are not what you would expect.

559
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:41,344
Speaker 1: They are kind of random.

560
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:42,455
Speaker 1: they're all over The place.

561
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:45,445
Speaker 1: there's bodegas but there's No bodega called bodega.

562
00:43:45,465 --> 00:43:59,530
Speaker 1: but in this Universe the bodega is called bodega Okay But otherwise She is obsessed with This astronaut who I guess Disappeared or something and left some tech Behind and she's trying to figure out the deal.

563
00:43:59,953 --> 00:44:10,244
Speaker 1: And she accidentally summons a gigantic dinosaur Who is Totally cool and an awesome Pet and then she Becomes a superhero and that's pretty much what Happens.

564
00:44:12,623 --> 00:44:18,798
Speaker 0: The thing I like the most about This show was that In which he's in school Right.

565
00:44:19,263 --> 00:44:34,357
Speaker 0: there was this Other student who's like the friend student Right and in the first scene with The friend the friend is Portrayed as first of all not A friend right as Some sort of popular girl Who is you know the exact opposite of Moon girl

566
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,209
Speaker 1: living for the tiktok

567
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:40,149
Speaker 0: Who is all into like tiktok social Media ing and that sort of biz.

568
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,696
Speaker 0: And you know Is like.

569
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:47,042
Speaker 0: you know you think that's Gonna be like a villain or a bully Of some kind.

570
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:52,333
Speaker 0: right Following the typical tropes of a school Story right it's like nerdy Girl.

571
00:44:52,454 --> 00:44:58,801
Speaker 0: and then social media Popular girl and they're gonna be at odds Right and In you know.

572
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:15,425
Speaker 0: indeed I think after That first scene they are Sort of you know at odds but Basically like the second Third time it's like actually No right They sort of team up And they team up in a positive Way right.

573
00:45:15,526 --> 00:45:15,849
Speaker 0: it's like.

574
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:21,829
Speaker 1: You know like immediately and they team up In a way that is very modern to kids And this is something I do appreciate too.

575
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:25,646
Speaker 1: This show Definitely acts like.

576
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:39,546
Speaker 1: it Understands how kids use technology And how their lives work and the fact that Social media and smartphones exist And the you know The way they portray the using Of social media is In a positive way right?

577
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:39,889
Speaker 0: it's like.

578
00:45:40,354 --> 00:45:53,545
Speaker 0: It's like yes they're using it To like get themselves out there and be You know popular you know Get clout or whatever right And bring attention to things But they're not doing anything with it that would Be considered like.

579
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:57,669
Speaker 0: You know the bad behavior that You usually see from.

580
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:13,768
Speaker 0: You know those sorts of people right get it you know Annoying people with it getting people In there who do you know don't want to be on There harassing people Invading people's privacy Doing you know Too much capitalisms right You know anything like that.

581
00:46:13,788 --> 00:46:25,328
Speaker 0: it's like They're just using it in a. You know they're using it perhaps too much Yeah But they're using it in a Good example of at least How to use it somewhat responsibly.

582
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:33,341
Speaker 1: The show is largely a lot of kids And adults being pretty good role models For kids which Is a good portrayal.

583
00:46:33,603 --> 00:46:37,809
Speaker 1: the the villains Are appropriate To the stakes.

584
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:44,008
Speaker 0: I think I mean the villain really Felt like a a spider-man villain You know which is appropriate for one.

585
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:45,462
Speaker 0: a New York story.

586
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:49,945
Speaker 1: definitely I feel like if she'd actually killed All those people spider-man would have showed up.

587
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,766
Speaker 0: Yeah probably I don't know Someone would have showed up but it's like.

588
00:46:54,864 --> 00:47:00,387
Speaker 0: Um Yeah but I think if You are if you're a kid who is?

589
00:47:00,892 --> 00:47:08,430
Speaker 0: Perhaps you know I don't know if it's a. I guess it would Be about the same age target As a My Little Pony maybe a little bit older.

590
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:11,701
Speaker 1: Yeah maybe a little younger actually Could be.

591
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:12,630
Speaker 0: it's like around the same.

592
00:47:12,812 --> 00:47:14,330
Speaker 0: I guess you know young kids.

593
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,650
Speaker 0: It's like you understand English.

594
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:20,128
Speaker 0: You're too old for Sesame Street But you know you're too young for.

595
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,390
Speaker 0: You know The Simpsons I don't know.

596
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:24,915
Speaker 1: But especially too it is very It is.

597
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:32,210
Speaker 1: it is not Centering whiteness In like very directly And that is clearly a big part of the show.

598
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:32,533
Speaker 1: It is.

599
00:47:32,938 --> 00:47:38,270
Speaker 1: it is de-centering that To a strong degree and it's a very Very diverse cast for a reason.

600
00:47:38,714 --> 00:47:44,150
Speaker 0: The voice acting I think it's a. It's a you know New York cast Yeah and the voice acting.

601
00:47:44,292 --> 00:47:54,330
Speaker 1: Even though the dialogue is extremely simple The voice acting is spot on like it's Very well done even if the actual words They say are very simple Plot moving Dialogue.

602
00:47:54,955 --> 00:48:06,280
Speaker 1: But the thing that stands out the main reason I would say you as a Geek Nights listener I don't think we have any like nine year old Geek Nights listeners Is that the animation Is fantastic.

603
00:48:06,502 --> 00:48:09,916
Speaker 1: you know Spider-Verse Like captured a very particular Style.

604
00:48:10,522 --> 00:48:15,758
Speaker 1: well this Really captures 2D newspaper Print comics.

605
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,817
Speaker 1: the backgrounds are Very flat.

606
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,190
Speaker 1: the characters are very flat.

607
00:48:19,533 --> 00:48:22,038
Speaker 1: The special effects are done in A really interesting way.

608
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:25,290
Speaker 1: this is visually On the edge of stunning.

609
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:29,089
Speaker 1: Regardless of anything else I would watch Anything animated in this style.

610
00:48:31,474 --> 00:48:34,241
Speaker 1: That is that is it's so Well done right?

611
00:48:34,282 --> 00:48:47,797
Speaker 0: so perhaps the coolest Thing about this show is not anything in The show itself but the story of How the show came to be Because none other Than Morpheus the Lawrence Fishburne

612
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:52,650
Speaker 1: I was about to say because he He plays the Beyonder in this Show in one of the episodes

613
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:53,578
Speaker 0: Right.

614
00:48:53,961 --> 00:49:00,608
Speaker 0: so he Read the comic book that Rym thinks is probably bad the Moon Boy When he was a young right.

615
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:05,716
Speaker 0: And he found out that the Moon Girl Comics from 2000 whatever Existed.

616
00:49:06,686 --> 00:49:10,670
Speaker 0: and then He read those and he says Oh this should be a cartoon.

617
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,594
Speaker 0: And so he was the executive producer For it.

618
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:18,119
Speaker 0: right but it wasn't one of those situations Where like you just slap in your name on something But you get no credit.

619
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,210
Speaker 0: he clearly like believed.

620
00:49:19,472 --> 00:49:21,050
Speaker 0: He's like right he was like.

621
00:49:21,111 --> 00:49:21,534
Speaker 0: He was like.

622
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:22,099
Speaker 0: oh I like.

623
00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:23,269
Speaker 0: you know let's make this happen.

624
00:49:23,573 --> 00:49:24,886
Speaker 0: And he you know he made it happen.

625
00:49:24,906 --> 00:49:31,717
Speaker 0: the other Big name involved Which makes obviously perfect sense Is Steve Loader Right.

626
00:49:31,737 --> 00:49:35,817
Speaker 0: you know Who is a Kim Possible you know Key person.

627
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:42,443
Speaker 0: so and that Makes perfect sense because you look at the show and you're like Oh yeah I can see the I can see the Connection definitely see it.

628
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:50,685
Speaker 1: so I would say anyone Who listens to Geek Nights it is worth It to at least watch the first episode Because it ends at a satisfying point.

629
00:49:50,726 --> 00:49:51,655
Speaker 1: treat it like a Mini movie.

630
00:49:51,939 --> 00:49:54,248
Speaker 1: the animation is great There's a lot of good stuff going on.

631
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:58,930
Speaker 1: But if you got kids this show I feel like it'll just hit.

632
00:49:59,273 --> 00:49:59,758
Speaker 1: It'll hit them.

633
00:49:59,778 --> 00:50:01,322
Speaker 1: I think they'd be into It.

634
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:06,910
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm gonna watch the rest of it aggressively But I feel like at some point I'll watch it all.

635
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,570
Speaker 1: There won't be that much of it I imagine.

636
00:50:09,413 --> 00:50:11,574
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't think this is something that I'm gonna Like.

637
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:16,425
Speaker 0: go and spend my time Watching a whole bunch of but like if it was on I would watch it right?

638
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:20,018
Speaker 0: Oh absolutely And then I would tell someone else To watch it.

639
00:50:20,503 --> 00:50:24,019
Speaker 0: but uh Especially if they are a child In this year.

640
00:50:24,685 --> 00:50:26,306
Speaker 0: but am I Gonna watch it you know?

641
00:50:27,173 --> 00:50:27,810
Speaker 0: Eh maybe.

642
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:30,807
Speaker 0: But that doesn't mean it's no good.

643
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:32,067
Speaker 0: that just means I got no time.

644
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,370
Speaker 0: I'd watch lots of television.

645
00:50:34,471 --> 00:50:38,947
Speaker 1: The Devil Dinosaur himself is just extremely Cute and very well done.

646
00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:42,248
Speaker 1: like They have the right amount I think he's great.

647
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:46,020
Speaker 0: I mean who isn't Gonna love?

650
00:50:57,455 --> 00:51:01,856
