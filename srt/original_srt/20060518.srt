00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,650
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, May 18th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,308
Speaker 0: Tonight we conclude Worst Week with a rundown of the worst people ever in the history of people.

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,748
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:36,509
Speaker 0: Now as everyone who frequents the forums is aware, I started conducting an experiment as of this morning where randomly I decided I was going to drive exactly the posted speed limit no matter what road I was on, no matter where I was for a week.

5
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:37,549
Speaker 1: Use cruise control?

6
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,949
Speaker 0: Yes, when I can.

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,091
Speaker 0: And cruise control doesn't work so well under about 40.

8
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,110
Speaker 1: Oh, in my car it's like an exact thing.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,490
Speaker 1: I don't use it ever.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:54,087
Speaker 0: The way cruise control works in most cars, it doesn't work so well, especially at low speeds or when there's traffic around, because you gotta slow down and stop based on what's going on.

11
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,045
Speaker 0: But on the freeway, I just put it at 55 and it went.

12
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:06,310
Speaker 0: And especially after my commute home today, I have somewhat revised my views regarding speed limits and speeding laws.

13
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:12,370
Speaker 0: Now before, everyone knows that I speed a lot and I think many of the speed limits out there are silly.

14
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,790
Speaker 0: And I tended to think the people who drove the speed limit were just driving too slow and whatever.

15
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:20,069
Speaker 0: My opinion is completely different now.

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,170
Speaker 0: It is not only silly to have these laws, it is dangerous to actually follow them.

17
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:30,810
Speaker 0: I almost got run off the road because I was going 55 on the freeway.

18
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:33,570
Speaker 1: So how did they run you off the road?

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:40,329
Speaker 0: People would come up, coming up behind me, they'd get right on my ass and then they'd like swerve around me because there was traffic in the left lane too.

20
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,670
Speaker 0: As fast as they could.

21
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:52,408
Speaker 0: I almost got clipped by someone, people were passing me in the shoulder at one point, and I made this huge clusterfuck of traffic as far as I could see behind me as people were fighting with each other to try to get around me.

22
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what happens on these two lane roads.

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,269
Speaker 1: You see on 84, like on my way to work, traffic will just be going nicely and then some truck will get behind a slower truck.

24
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:05,210
Speaker 1: Both going well above the 55 mile an hour speed limit.

25
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,130
Speaker 1: So the faster truck will pass the other truck on the left, then a million cars, including me, will line up behind the truck in the left lane.

26
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,989
Speaker 1: And then when the truck finally gets in the right lane, all the cars will finally get going and spread out again.

27
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:31,090
Speaker 0: But me, one little car going 55 in the right lane, not even doing anything like sitting in the left lane, I was following the letter of the law, and I was only screwing up traffic and endangering myself and others.

28
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:32,269
Speaker 0: Yep.

29
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,589
Speaker 0: This isn't cool.

30
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:34,190
Speaker 0: Nope.

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:43,429
Speaker 0: I'm going to try to do this all week and see if the trend continues, but I think the end result is going to be that it is actually dangerous to follow the speed limit on most freeways.

32
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,226
Speaker 1: Yep.

33
00:02:45,317 --> 00:02:45,970
Speaker 1: We knew that already.

34
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,946
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, eventually we're going to do a Thursday show on speeding and speed laws and all that.

35
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,869
Speaker 1: I went real fast home today.

36
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:54,574
Speaker 1: Yeah.

37
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,527
Speaker 1: Real fast.

38
00:02:58,644 --> 00:02:58,958
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

39
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:10,559
Speaker 1: So long time ago, I don't know, months ago, search on frontrowcrew.com for like this story and you'll find we talked about it when it was just a rumor, but finally today it's true.

40
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,199
Speaker 1: Seagate, the company that makes the hard drives that I buy, is buying MaxDoor, the company that makes the hard drives I buy.

41
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:19,156
Speaker 1: There you go.

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,940
Speaker 1: So now me and Rym both buy hard drives in the same company.

43
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:25,478
Speaker 1: What does this mean?

44
00:03:25,922 --> 00:03:29,000
Speaker 1: It means there's going to be less competition for hard drives.

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,845
Speaker 0: Which isn't that big of a deal right now because hard drive prices are pretty much bottomed out.

46
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,556
Speaker 1: It means that MaxDoor's drives are a little less reliable than Seagate's, some people say.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, some people.

48
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,419
Speaker 0: A lot of people say the other way too.

49
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,600
Speaker 0: There's really no data.

50
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:46,838
Speaker 1: Someone really should do a thing.

51
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,540
Speaker 1: We know that Western Digital is crap.

52
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:49,538
Speaker 0: Used to be.

53
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,380
Speaker 0: They're a lot better than they were a long time ago.

54
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:58,514
Speaker 1: But anyway, it means that there'll probably be a lot more products available with the Seagate label on them.

55
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:07,779
Speaker 1: Means that Seagate will be an even bigger, more powerful, dangerous computer company, probably as big as the likes of Intel and AMD and all those.

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,580
Speaker 0: Actually, I see a lot of good coming out of this because Seagate had a lot of proprietary patented technology in their hard drives.

57
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:15,554
Speaker 1: A whole lot.

58
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Speaker 0: MaxDoor had an equal body of proprietary technology in their hard drives.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,799
Speaker 0: Now, this conglomerate company, Seagate, with all of that under them, can use the IP from both to make better drives.

60
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they'll buy Western Digital, and then that'll be it.

61
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:31,615
Speaker 1: The end.

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,019
Speaker 0: Well, no, then the antitrust hammer will come out like it always does.

63
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 1: Too bad it's an international company.

64
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,437
Speaker 1: What can you really do?

65
00:04:39,463 --> 00:04:40,199
Speaker 0: They can do things.

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:50,020
Speaker 1: You can't say, no, if you're the only company in the world that makes hard drives, really, you can't say, no, you're not allowed to sell in the United States, there'll be no hard drives here.

67
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:50,640
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

68
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can, because the United States would want to say, you can't sell here, and then they'd make incentives for some domestic company to make inflated-price hard drives for us.

69
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:57,876
Speaker 0: Great.

70
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,660
Speaker 1: Inflated-price hard drives.

71
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:00,297
Speaker 1: What do you expect?

72
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:05,300
Speaker 1: We can start the black market underground hard drive importing business.

73
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:07,739
Speaker 1: Illegal Seagate here.

74
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,399
Speaker 1: Hey, man, want some Seagates?

75
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,778
Speaker 1: Seashields.

76
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,540
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, it really couldn't happen anyway.

77
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:16,440
Speaker 0: I can't see any situation where Seagate would also buy Western Digital.

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,079
Speaker 1: Me either.

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,139
Speaker 1: Because Western Digital doesn't have a useful secret IP that you'd want.

80
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,839
Speaker 1: They just have crap.

81
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Speaker 0: So you know this whole NSA thing, the NSA spying on American citizens and whatnot?

82
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:43,517
Speaker 0: Well, the news that's come out, this is actually from yesterday, is that apparently they had a program, I think it was called ThinThread, quite some time ago, where they had decided that they wanted to analyze the same kind of data that the NSA claims to be analyzing now.

83
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:55,317
Speaker 0: Now apparently they'd come up with a way of doing this, quite some time ago, where they wouldn't actually be able to extract from the data the individual people, or who actually called who.

84
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,779
Speaker 0: They could only get the aggregate data and look for trends.

85
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:12,359
Speaker 0: It was completely legal, it doesn't run afoul of any of the laws that the current spying program may or may not be running afoul of, and there's really no reason they couldn't have done their current program that way, as opposed to the horribly privacy-infringing way they're doing it now.

86
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:18,480
Speaker 1: Wait, so it would find people with calling patterns similar to the calling patterns of terrorists?

87
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:18,773
Speaker 0: What?

88
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:38,060
Speaker 0: No, it would look for patterns in calling, in aggregate, so you could try to figure out the source and destination, like you could try to find patterns and trends in calls, kind of like the way we search for "chatter" to determine when terrorist activity is going to happen, because chatter increases, or certain patterns of communication appear in the airwaves.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,618
Speaker 1: So certain patterns of calling mean...?

90
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,236
Speaker 0: Yeah!

91
00:06:43,182 --> 00:06:45,900
Speaker 0: If you look at data like that in aggregate, you can get a lot of information.

92
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can, but how are you supposed to find the bad guy like that?

93
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:54,039
Speaker 0: You can't find the bad guy that way, you can find out what the bad guy's gonna do.

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,660
Speaker 0: You're not gonna find the bad guy the way they're doing it now anyway.

95
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:57,598
Speaker 1: I know.

96
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,978
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that the stated purpose of what they're doing now is just to find patterns.

97
00:07:02,682 --> 00:07:04,019
Speaker 0: That's how they're getting away with it.

98
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,217
Speaker 0: But they could have done the same thing they say they're doing now without infringing the way they are.

99
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,800
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so obviously the answer is they're not doing what they say they're doing.

100
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,380
Speaker 0: Oh no, I'm pretty certain they're just recording everyone's conversations and looking for keywords.

101
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously.

102
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,660
Speaker 0: What really saddens me is that Americans really don't seem to care so much at all.

103
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,960
Speaker 1: 'Cause it doesn't affect their lives in a visible way, so they don't care.

104
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,740
Speaker 1: They'll only care if something, you know, is affecting people that they can see.

105
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,919
Speaker 1: If you can't see it, it's not happening.

106
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what, that's just kind of sad and scary.

107
00:07:37,482 --> 00:07:40,220
Speaker 1: Yep, people are, you know, stupid.

108
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,200
Speaker 1: You can do anything you want to 'em.

109
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,195
Speaker 1: You can sell 'em bullshit fake medicine and you can spy on 'em.

110
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:47,460
Speaker 1: and what do they care?

111
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:55,100
Speaker 1: Doesn't affect their useless lives where they don't think about those sorts of things and they don't care about those sorts of things and they don't notice.

112
00:07:56,781 --> 00:08:01,717
Speaker 1: And then when something bad finally happens, then they'll complain, but there's not a goddamn thing they can do about it then.

113
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,220
Speaker 1: That's the fate of the stupid version.

114
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:07,100
Speaker 1: You're gonna get screwed your whole life.

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,780
Speaker 0: Well, the problem with that is that it affects me just as much and there's really no way I can get away from stupid people.

116
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,580
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have been on the same team with the stupids.

117
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,758
Speaker 0: There's no other team!

118
00:08:15,342 --> 00:08:15,516
Speaker 1: Huh?

119
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,165
Speaker 1: Wow.

120
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,290
Speaker 0: So in the spirit of worst week, I have a worst thing of the day.

121
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:27,265
Speaker 1: How bad is it?

122
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,250
Speaker 0: Well, let me just say that I really like amusement parks and roller coaster parks.

123
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:33,070
Speaker 1: Oh, it is a worst!

124
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,609
Speaker 1: That's right!

125
00:08:33,874 --> 00:08:34,149
Speaker 1: Awesome.

126
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,729
Speaker 0: So I grew up, you know, I grew up in Michigan near Cedar Point, which is the roller coaster capital of the world.

127
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,549
Speaker 0: It's the biggest roller coaster park that has ever been.

128
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,330
Speaker 0: They have more roller coasters than anyone.

129
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,249
Speaker 0: I love roller coasters.

130
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,377
Speaker 0: Apparently this guy went to- Oooowee!

131
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,116
Speaker 0: Oooowee!

132
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:51,869
Speaker 0: Went to Egypt.

133
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,589
Speaker 0: And in Egypt he saw this amusement park.

134
00:08:55,131 --> 00:08:56,508
Speaker 0: He decided he wanted to go in.

135
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,890
Speaker 1: Was it next to the pyramids?

136
00:08:58,774 --> 00:08:59,630
Speaker 1: Was it Pyramid Park?

137
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:00,457
Speaker 1: No.

138
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,170
Speaker 1: Was it Sphinx City?

139
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:05,930
Speaker 0: You know, it wasn't even Egyptian themed.

140
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:08,830
Speaker 0: If anything, it was derelict shack themed.

141
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:09,201
Speaker 0: What?

142
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,067
Speaker 1: What?

143
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:12,430
Speaker 0: It was basic- Look at these pictures.

144
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,130
Speaker 0: It looks like zombies killed everyone in an amusement park.

145
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,749
Speaker 0: This is upset for a movie.

146
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,208
Speaker 0: It is not an amusement park.

147
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,809
Speaker 0: However, it's actually an amusement park.

148
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,190
Speaker 0: There's no joke and these pictures are from this amusement park.

149
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,108
Speaker 0: The guy paid 30 pounds to get in.

150
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,309
Speaker 1: Egyptian pounds.

151
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,410
Speaker 0: And he- And he just- Look at these pictures.

152
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,249
Speaker 0: I can't say more.

153
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,290
Speaker 0: None of the rides worked.

154
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,670
Speaker 0: This place is scary looking.

155
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:38,490
Speaker 1: I have a theory, a hypothesis, actually.

156
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:40,770
Speaker 0: That this amusement park is nothing more than a scam?

157
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,790
Speaker 1: No, the amusement park was just a run down amusement park that wasn't actually open.

158
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:50,088
Speaker 1: And some guy realized that if he stood in the ticket booth all day, he could just take money from people.

159
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:51,896
Speaker 1: And not give the-.

160
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,469
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

161
00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:01,430
Speaker 1: I mean, if there was a run down amusement park nearby, I would just go stand in the ticket booth and sell tickets until I- and just collect money.

162
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:03,449
Speaker 0: Why did they attack the amusement park?

163
00:10:03,873 --> 00:10:04,268
Speaker 1: For fun.

164
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:06,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, check out these pictures.

165
00:10:06,972 --> 00:10:12,148
Speaker 0: It looks like urban exploration, but nah, it's an amusement park and some of the rides were working.

166
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,470
Speaker 1: Who was running the rides?

167
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:15,129
Speaker 0: I don't know.

168
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,530
Speaker 1: What are they paying those employees with?

169
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:17,609
Speaker 1: Who goes to this park?

170
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,150
Speaker 0: It's like Cartmanland.

171
00:10:20,051 --> 00:10:20,284
Speaker 1: Wow.

172
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,530
Speaker 1: Alright.

173
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:31,769
Speaker 1: So, I found this video, surprisingly it wasn't on YouTube or Google Video or anything, it was on Myspace.

174
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:31,998
Speaker 0: What?

175
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,230
Speaker 0: What are you doing on Myspace?

176
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:33,729
Speaker 1: I wasn't.

177
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,549
Speaker 1: Someone linked there.

178
00:10:34,773 --> 00:10:35,707
Speaker 0: And you followed it?

179
00:10:36,655 --> 00:10:37,148
Speaker 0: What the hell?

180
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,699
Speaker 1: Well, it was worth it because this video is-.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,770
Speaker 1: well, in the video, let's start, there are some old timey videos.

182
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:51,732
Speaker 1: I think someone said the video might be from Hugh Hefner's Playboy penthouse from the early 60s.

183
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,741
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

184
00:10:53,170 --> 00:11:07,930
Speaker 1: Of course, who knows what it could be from, but regardless, it's an old black and white TV show of some sort, or movie or something, of two really cool jazz dancing guys named, I think, Al and Leon.

185
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:12,850
Speaker 1: And they do this awesome swing jazz dance of old timeyness.

186
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,189
Speaker 0: These guys can dance, though I wouldn't really consider that old timey.

187
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:25,532
Speaker 1: Well, it's not super 1920s old timey, but it's old timey considering the present year is 2007.

188
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,929
Speaker 0: I wouldn't consider something that happened within the last hundred years old timey.

189
00:11:29,351 --> 00:11:29,606
Speaker 1: I would.

190
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:30,930
Speaker 1: Definitely.

191
00:11:31,432 --> 00:11:31,604
Speaker 0: Punk kid.

192
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,230
Speaker 1: You're the punk kid.

193
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:34,367
Speaker 0: I'm older than you.

194
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:36,370
Speaker 1: The 1920s are old timey, alright?

195
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:36,970
Speaker 1: No, they're not.

196
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,149
Speaker 1: And those are less than a hundred years ago.

197
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,910
Speaker 0: I don't consider them old timey at all.

198
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,389
Speaker 1: 1920s is as old timey as it gets, because you know what?

199
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,830
Speaker 1: Medieval stuff is not old timey, it's ancient.

200
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:47,570
Speaker 0: That's not ancient.

201
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,326
Speaker 1: Yes it is.

202
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,350
Speaker 0: No, no, ancient is pyramids.

203
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,110
Speaker 1: No, pyramids are mega ancient.

204
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,490
Speaker 0: That's not a word.

205
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:55,150
Speaker 1: It's double ancient.

206
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:55,778
Speaker 0: No.

207
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:56,950
Speaker 1: Double plus ancient.

208
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,930
Speaker 0: I double dog ancient ancient you.

209
00:11:59,513 --> 00:12:00,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, anyway.

210
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,230
Speaker 1: So you have this video of two cool guys dancing in an old style, right?

211
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,989
Speaker 1: And the dance is really cool.

212
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,090
Speaker 1: Now, the one thing that's notably absent is the old style music.

213
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,249
Speaker 1: Where's it at?

214
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:11,805
Speaker 1: I don't know.

215
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,735
Speaker 1: What someone did is they took some new school hip hop rhymes, which are actually some pretty good songs.

216
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:24,549
Speaker 1: I should find what song it is and get the guy's stuff, because it's, you know, I don't like a lot of hip hop musics, but this is pretty good stuff.

217
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:31,308
Speaker 1: And he puts it right on top of this video of old school dancing, and it works really well.

218
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,650
Speaker 0: It looks like you synced the timing up somehow.

219
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:52,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like as the guys dance, I think what the thing is, it must be that either the beats per minute of the old song match that of the new hip hop song, or they sped up or slowed down the video slightly to get it to match the beats per minute of the hip hop song.

220
00:12:54,091 --> 00:12:58,890
Speaker 1: Or he made the song especially for this video that he found, which would be extra cool.

221
00:12:59,473 --> 00:12:59,562
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:03,230
Speaker 0: All we gotta do is get some sort of leak action in there, and we'll be golden.

223
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:09,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get some new school dancing videos and put some old timey music to them, see what happens.

224
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:12,570
Speaker 1: That should be very entertaining, too.

225
00:13:12,913 --> 00:13:13,948
Speaker 0: You're not gonna do that.

226
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:19,169
Speaker 1: If the opportunity presents itself and it's trivially- You're not gonna do that.

227
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,809
Speaker 1: The effort is low, I'll do it.

228
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,728
Speaker 0: You realize it wasn't until just now that I finally decided to do my Wonder Woman Superman remix.

229
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:31,090
Speaker 0: In fact, for some reason, I didn't think about it all day.

230
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,753
Speaker 0: And then as we sat down to the podcast, I'm like, "Oh, yeah," and I suddenly started doing it.

231
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:41,090
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, so everyone knows, what is it, last week, I think?

232
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were talking about Freep Comic Book Day.

233
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:57,110
Speaker 1: We were talking about Freep Comic Book Day, and in the Justice League Unlimited free comic book, there was one page in the comic where if you remove the text and just looked at the pictures, there were some sexual innuendo implications.

234
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,410
Speaker 0: The best part, just when Superman's standing there behind Hawkgirl, and then he gets this stupid grin on his face as he grabs her shoulder.

235
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:12,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we took that and someone scanned it and sent it to us, and then I erased the text from the bubbles, and I put it on the forums.

236
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:23,930
Speaker 1: So if you go to frontroadcrew.com and go to the discussion forum, you can get this picture, and there's a contest to put funny text in the bubbles or modify the picture to be funny.

237
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 1: There's no real prize except for everyone else will say how awesome you are.

238
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,590
Speaker 0: Yes, fame and fortune, without the fortune.

239
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,590
Speaker 1: Without the fortune, just the fame, in a little tiny forum.

240
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:40,010
Speaker 1: But yeah, you should go and make parodies of this picture that are funny to amuse us.

241
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:49,130
Speaker 0: Yes, especially since after we're done, I'm going to submit the picture to Fark, and there's a decent chance it'll get into the Photoshop, because they love that sort of crap.

242
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:50,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good one.

243
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,770
Speaker 0: So if you guys get to it first, then you'll be all set to win the Fark one.

244
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:55,101
Speaker 0: Ooh.

245
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:56,969
Speaker 0: You know what you win when you win the Fark one?

246
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:58,290
Speaker 1: Fame without fortune?

247
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:04,108
Speaker 0: Not even that, no one ever actually looks at the thread to see who won, as far as I can tell.

248
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:04,650
Speaker 0: Really?

249
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:06,449
Speaker 0: I don't even vote, I just look at them.

250
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, they have the little voting thing, don't they?

251
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:10,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do.

252
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:10,635
Speaker 0: Oh.

253
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,046
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's just randomly enabled on threads that really don't need it, which leads to hilarity.

254
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,583
Speaker 1: A bunch of people vote for a guy that says, "Fuck

255
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:19,744
Speaker 1: you.".

256
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:25,509
Speaker 0: There's always someone who posts something like a picture of Nelson and the lyrics to Iron Man.

257
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:28,350
Speaker 1: Alright.

258
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, you might have noticed we were a little quick on the news.

259
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:38,683
Speaker 0: That's because today's Thursday, and it's the end of Worst Week, and to wrap it up, we want to talk about the worst people ever.

260
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:44,750
Speaker 1: And not worst people that you know about, so we're not gonna be talking about your Hitlers and your Stalins.

261
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,608
Speaker 0: Stalins, your Jesuses.

262
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:51,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not talking about those guys that everyone knows, you know, your Pol Potts.

263
00:15:51,636 --> 00:15:51,806
Speaker 1: Yeah.

264
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,749
Speaker 1: And we're not talking about those guys, because everyone knows those guys.

265
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,789
Speaker 1: And girls, I guess there's some evil bitches in history, too.

266
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:00,010
Speaker 1: I'm the juggernaut.

267
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,748
Speaker 1: I'm the juggernaut, bitch.

268
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:05,668
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

269
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,330
Speaker 0: I gotta stop thinking about that stupid thing.

270
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,210
Speaker 1: Wasn't that yesterday's thing?

271
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:10,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

272
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,390
Speaker 0: You know we gotta show it to everyone this weekend.

273
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:12,856
Speaker 1: We do.

274
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:15,668
Speaker 1: Cuz I'm the juggernaut, bitch.

275
00:16:16,311 --> 00:16:17,309
Speaker 0: Fuck you with my pink cane.

276
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:32,185
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about the worst people in history that you probably either A, think we're good people but we're actually bad, or B, never heard of in your entire life, or C, you're so smart and know so much about history.

277
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:33,969
Speaker 1: you've heard this all before and you'll think we're stupid.

278
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:34,850
Speaker 0: Yeah.

279
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:37,330
Speaker 0: If anyone is C, that's great.

280
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,590
Speaker 0: Tell us who we shoulda listed.

281
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,476
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd love, you know, cuz.

282
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:49,970
Speaker 1: basically what we did is we took people that we know that other people didn't know, and then we did some Google searching and added a few more people we just discovered, and that's that.

283
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:55,970
Speaker 1: And I'm sure there are plenty more evil, crazy, batshit, bad guys that we can talk about.

284
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:56,519
Speaker 0: Yep.

285
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,767
Speaker 0: And once again we decided to hold off on our worst people in the world ever that we personally know.

286
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:06,050
Speaker 1: You mean, well I think that should be for hated week instead of worst week.

287
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,790
Speaker 0: Nah, there's some people we have met mostly at cons briefly who I think objectively are bad people.

288
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:16,910
Speaker 1: Yep, they are bad people, but we could say worst people we know personally.

289
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,049
Speaker 1: That would fit.

290
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,990
Speaker 0: Worst people we have been in physical proximity with for any amount of time.

291
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,109
Speaker 1: Well, because there are people that we might have been near some really terrible people and not known it cuz you didn't interact with them in any way.

292
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,569
Speaker 1: Or we might not know their names or anything about them.

293
00:17:31,054 --> 00:17:32,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we could usually smell them.

294
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:33,407
Speaker 0: We can.

295
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,806
Speaker 1: Alright, so, who do you want to talk about first?

296
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,129
Speaker 0: Alright, I can think of so many.

297
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,497
Speaker 0: Let's start with an easy one, cuz Scott.

298
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,830
Speaker 0: actually, everyone remembers William Randolph Hearst and Pulitzer.

299
00:17:46,453 --> 00:17:47,169
Speaker 1: Newspaper guys.

300
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,129
Speaker 0: Newspaper guys, famous newspaper guys.

301
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:57,530
Speaker 0: Now the Pulitzer Prize is named after Pulitzer, yet Pulitzer was kind of a bastard.

302
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,829
Speaker 0: He really wasn't the greatest guy.

303
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:18,530
Speaker 0: Him and Hearst, I don't know how many of you know much about US history around Spanish-American war-type times, yellow journalism and whatnot, but these guys basically sensationalized war and things going on in the world to try to cause bad things to happen in order to sell more newspapers.

304
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do that today also.

305
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:28,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this is really kind of the start of journalism that affects the world in addition to reporting on it.

306
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:38,429
Speaker 0: And it's kind of started this vicious cycle of, if you make bad news, more bad news happens, which you can then report on, which makes more bad news, and money keeps coming out of that cycle.

307
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,470
Speaker 1: Yep, because people like to read about bad news for some reason, cuz they're fuckers.

308
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,130
Speaker 0: It's like the citric acid cycle, only money comes out of it instead.

309
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:45,652
Speaker 0: Oh.

310
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:52,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll do little quick blurbs, we're not going to go into detail on all these people.

311
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,449
Speaker 0: For the most part.

312
00:18:53,811 --> 00:19:02,010
Speaker 1: Alright, so the next guy I want to talk about is a guy that everyone knows and probably thinks good things about, but I'm going to make you think real bad things about him.

313
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,702
Speaker 1: But first I want to talk about what habeas corpus is.

314
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,050
Speaker 1: in case you didn't pay attention.

315
00:19:06,794 --> 00:19:07,689
Speaker 0: I was waiting for this one.

316
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,909
Speaker 1: In case you didn't pay attention in social studies class.

317
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,510
Speaker 1: Habeas corpus is an essential right in any free society.

318
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:23,007
Speaker 1: What it means is that when you get arrested, right, so let's say the cops come up in the arrest rim and they say, "We're taking you to jail, you're under

319
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:23,389
Speaker 1: arrest.".

320
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,499
Speaker 0: "But I'm the juggernaut,

321
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:24,862
Speaker 0: bitch!".

322
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,250
Speaker 1: Habeas corpus means that they have to tell rim why he's being arrested.

323
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:36,545
Speaker 1: They have to say, "You're being arrested for stealing, or killing, or

324
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:36,986
Speaker 1: whatever.".

325
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:44,388
Speaker 1: And the reason habeas corpus is so important is because let's say we arrest rim, and we don't tell him what he did.

326
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:52,747
Speaker 1: Even if we have a court, we take him to the court, right, or whatever, and we say, "Alright, you're on trial, what do you have to say for

327
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:53,149
Speaker 1: yourself?".

328
00:19:53,815 --> 00:19:54,545
Speaker 1: "I didn't steal that

329
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:54,808
Speaker 1: thing!".

330
00:19:55,172 --> 00:19:56,545
Speaker 1: "Well, you're not on trial for

331
00:19:56,585 --> 00:19:56,969
Speaker 1: stealing.".

332
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,584
Speaker 1: "Um, um, and you're in jail, and then you're

333
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:00,806
Speaker 1: fucked.".

334
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:03,230
Speaker 1: That is why habeas corpus is important.

335
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,628
Speaker 1: Without habeas corpus, you can just go around putting anyone you want into jail and no one can do a goddamn thing about it.

336
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:13,470
Speaker 1: Now, it's just as important as freedom of speech and everything else.

337
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:14,529
Speaker 1: Even more important.

338
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,250
Speaker 1: Because even without freedom of speech, you won't be in jail.

339
00:20:17,831 --> 00:20:32,750
Speaker 0: Now, I would also like to posit that, because it all relates to this guy, I would say that the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are worth a little bit more than the arbitrary boundaries of one or possibly two countries.

340
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,549
Speaker 0: And thus, we actually name the person.

341
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:42,330
Speaker 1: Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States.

342
00:20:43,212 --> 00:20:45,850
Speaker 0: Probably one of my most disliked presidents.

343
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:47,769
Speaker 1: Yup, okay, so here's what happened.

344
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,290
Speaker 1: There was a civil war going on, in case you didn't know, there was a civil war going on.

345
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,050
Speaker 0: Which had very little, actually, to do with slavery.

346
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,769
Speaker 1: That is correct.

347
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:01,345
Speaker 1: And, there were these guys called the "peace

348
00:21:01,405 --> 00:21:02,068
Speaker 1: democrats."

349
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,990
Speaker 1: And what the peace democrats wanted to do, was they wanted to resolve the civil war peacefully.

350
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:18,130
Speaker 1: Their plan was to make a truce with the south, and have a new constitutional convention, and they would change the constitution to have some states' rights.

351
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,449
Speaker 1: I'm all with the peace democrats.

352
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,139
Speaker 1: Woo hoo.

353
00:21:22,591 --> 00:21:24,830
Speaker 1: Of course, the constitution already protects states' rights.

354
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem back then was the constitution did not protect you from slavery.

355
00:21:28,513 --> 00:21:28,910
Speaker 0: That's right.

356
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,950
Speaker 0: But that's a whole other issue.

357
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:35,050
Speaker 1: Yes, but the peace democrats were just peaceful, non-violent guys who opposed Lincoln.

358
00:21:35,992 --> 00:21:38,129
Speaker 1: Now, what did Abraham Lincoln do?

359
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:49,389
Speaker 1: Well, in 1861, he suspended Habeas Corpus in places that were resisting- Oh, no, first.

360
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:56,370
Speaker 1: In 1861, he suspended it in certain places that were strategic for the war.

361
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:06,970
Speaker 1: So, let's say there was a city, and if the city decided to resist the north, that the north would be in big trouble war-wise, he suspended Habeas Corpus there and arrested anyone who resisted.

362
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:22,049
Speaker 1: In 1862, when they started, you know, yelling at him about suspending Habeas Corpus in a few places, he just suspended it everywhere, and he started arresting these peace democrats all over the place.

363
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,430
Speaker 1: No Habeas Corpus, no nothing.

364
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:37,550
Speaker 1: So, imagine if Bush today, right, decided to go around arresting all the anti-Bush people around the country, not accusing them of any crime.

365
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,970
Speaker 1: Just have police round them up and throw them into jails.

366
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,790
Speaker 1: Anyone who opposes him, he just throws them into jails.

367
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, not even a- I mean, this is people who were opposing by saying- 60, 60, what is it, 38% approval rate?

368
00:22:49,390 --> 00:23:02,270
Speaker 1: So, it's like if Bush just took 62% of the population and just started locking them up in jail and didn't tell any of them what they had done wrong, didn't accuse them of any crime, no Habeas Corpus, no nothing.

369
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:11,970
Speaker 0: Now, the South was doing kind of a stupid thing in breaking away from the North, but I don't think it justified, you know, marching down there and killing a bunch of people.

370
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,879
Speaker 1: And, you know, if you think, oh, he just arrested a few really people who were opposing him a little bit, no, 13,000 people were arrested.

371
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,690
Speaker 1: Thirteen thousand.

372
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:29,290
Speaker 0: And another argument people seem to make a lot is- That's probably more people than they have in the Guantanamo.

373
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:36,469
Speaker 0: But, oh, if he hadn't done that and won the Civil War, then there wouldn't have been an America to stop Germany, and you know what?

374
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:42,490
Speaker 0: We didn't know that back then, hindsight, whatever, you can't make that argument, that's just wrong, because you can't know the future.

375
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,420
Speaker 1: No, you can't.

376
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:50,309
Speaker 1: So yeah, you should never suspend Habeas Corpus, and if you do, Scott will think you're a fucker, and so will Rym.

377
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,910
Speaker 0: All right, so we've already named Abraham Lincoln as one of the worst people ever.

378
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:58,608
Speaker 0: I think I can top that one in terms of people going, "Why would they say

379
00:23:58,688 --> 00:23:58,889
Speaker 0: this?".

380
00:23:59,653 --> 00:24:02,108
Speaker 1: If they've watched Bullshit, they won't.

381
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:10,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Bullshit really taught me about this, but then I read a bunch more, and I'm gonna go with Mother Teresa as one of the worst people ever.

382
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:11,648
Speaker 0: How bad was she?

383
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:17,410
Speaker 0: Mother Teresa caused the deaths of lots of people, and there's a lot of evidence that she was kind of a scam artist.

384
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,364
Speaker 1: Did she beat Abraham Lincoln's 13,000 people arrested?

385
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,949
Speaker 1: Oh, by the way, Habeas Corpus was reinstated, we're okay now.

386
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,186
Speaker 1: For now.

387
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:36,730
Speaker 1: In 1866, the Supreme Court brought it back, and now it's illegal to have a military trial in an area in which a civil trial is possible to happen.

388
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,330
Speaker 0: Now, that is why we have those secret prison camps in Eastern Europe right now.

389
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:47,070
Speaker 1: Because it's not possible to have a civil trial over there, so it's perfectly legal to have a military trial.

390
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:48,163
Speaker 0: Yeah.

391
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:48,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

392
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:51,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're none too happy with the current administration either.

393
00:24:52,552 --> 00:25:09,489
Speaker 1: But don't worry, this means that as long as you don't leave where you are, safe in the United States, or wherever, hopefully you're safe outside the United States, you're not a citizen, but if you're a US citizen, you're safe as long as you don't leave your home or anything, because there's a civil court near you.

394
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:14,570
Speaker 0: So anyway, a bunch of brief facts about Mother Teresa.

395
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,805
Speaker 0: I don't want to go into depth about this, because this shouldn't be a show of.

396
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,570
Speaker 0: here are all the details as to why this person's bad.

397
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,189
Speaker 0: This is a show of us yelling about the people who we think are bad.

398
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:34,470
Speaker 0: She took, her organization took lots of money, and the people who donated the money were under the impression that this money was going to go toward helping the sick and the poor and building hospitals and feeding people.

399
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,810
Speaker 1: That's what I would think if I was giving money to Mother Teresa.

400
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,789
Speaker 0: Money didn't go to that.

401
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,528
Speaker 0: The money all went to the Vatican and into missionary work.

402
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,005
Speaker 0: Missionary work, which has nothing to do with helping people and everything to do with converting them.

403
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:47,030
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

404
00:25:47,514 --> 00:25:49,210
Speaker 1: None of the money went into helping people at all?

405
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:58,150
Speaker 0: Almost none, because Mother Teresa very much believed that the poor should accept their lot and that that is a wonderful thing for them to do and that that's how they'll get close to Jesus.

406
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,789
Speaker 0: They should never try to better themselves, and the best way to get close to God is through suffering.

407
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:12,189
Speaker 0: So, your hospitals were very poorly maintained, they weren't that large, and they didn't actually treat people.

408
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,067
Speaker 0: They wouldn't, in many cases, would not help people who were dying with pain, because the suffering was good for them.

409
00:26:20,331 --> 00:26:26,390
Speaker 1: Did they at least convince the people that were suffering that the suffering was good before they had them suffering?

410
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,590
Speaker 0: They convinced them constantly while they were suffering.

411
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:30,429
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

412
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:38,829
Speaker 0: They would also not discriminate between people who had a minor illness and people who had a terminal illness, and they put everyone in hospice-style care.

413
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:42,970
Speaker 0: Meaning, if you came in and you were dying of cancer, they kept you there until you died.

414
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:46,690
Speaker 0: If you came in and you just had a cut on your leg, they kept you there until it turned into.

415
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:47,670
Speaker 0: you were really angry, and then you died.

416
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:54,529
Speaker 0: They didn't have any real doctors, and they didn't perform any actual services, other than washing your wounds periodically.

417
00:26:54,791 --> 00:26:55,570
Speaker 1: So where were these hospitals?

418
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,429
Speaker 1: Mostly Africa?

419
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,190
Speaker 0: India.

420
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:57,584
Speaker 1: India?

421
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,157
Speaker 1: Yeah.

422
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:59,079
Speaker 0: Great.

423
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:07,250
Speaker 0: The hospitals were much smaller than people in the West were led to believe, and Mother Teresa was kind of crazy.

424
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,690
Speaker 1: See, but you always remember her as this old woman, it's like, how did she do any stuff as an old lady?

425
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,347
Speaker 1: She didn't do it.

426
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:14,516
Speaker 1: Was it?

427
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:17,270
Speaker 1: she did it when she was young, and then when she was old, she just became old?

428
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:22,010
Speaker 0: A lot of people call it a cult, but she had a group of people who did all this together.

429
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:23,822
Speaker 1: Alright, so was it her idea?

430
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:24,409
Speaker 1: that's the thing?

431
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, she was the kind of figurehead and public face of all this.

432
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:34,508
Speaker 0: But she wasn't the greatest person, and I really don't think she should be remembered for very much.

433
00:27:35,431 --> 00:27:36,210
Speaker 1: I don't think so either.

434
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:37,747
Speaker 1: Bad lady.

435
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,310
Speaker 1: Bad old crazy lady.

436
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,150
Speaker 0: Of course, we haven't really talked about people who openly directly killed a bunch of people.

437
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,089
Speaker 0: We'll get to that right now.

438
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:45,109
Speaker 1: Oh, but that's the most fun.

439
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,888
Speaker 0: I want dibs.

440
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,150
Speaker 0: No, no, because we got the one for the end that we really got to save.

441
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,349
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to save him to the end?

442
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:50,606
Speaker 1: Alright.

443
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,908
Speaker 0: You want to do the Triple H, or you want me to start with Otto?

444
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,030
Speaker 1: I thought Triple H is the guy we're going to save to the end.

445
00:27:55,191 --> 00:27:56,809
Speaker 0: Oh, I was going to save the guy we have a song for.

446
00:27:57,917 --> 00:27:58,309
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

447
00:27:58,692 --> 00:27:59,507
Speaker 1: Fine, I'll do the Triple H.

448
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,550
Speaker 0: Alright, then I'll start with Otto, because Otto killed people less directly.

449
00:28:04,055 --> 00:28:04,290
Speaker 1: Okay.

450
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:12,908
Speaker 0: So Otto of Lagerie, he is indirectly responsible for countless deaths in the Middle East and Europe.

451
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:23,010
Speaker 0: He started wars, he started a huge war that spawned at least nine other wars as a result, and carnage and chaos, and spreading of the Christian church.

452
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:29,430
Speaker 0: He was actually known as Pope Urban II, and he was the pope who called for the First Crusade.

453
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,850
Speaker 1: So he invented the idea of the Crusade.

454
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, a nation out near the Holy Land was asking for help to repel the Turks.

455
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,649
Speaker 0: He rallied a whole bunch of Christians.

456
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:40,628
Speaker 1: I mean, kenigits.

457
00:28:41,114 --> 00:28:41,290
Speaker 0: Yeah.

458
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:44,787
Speaker 0: And he told them, "Anyone who fights in this war is absolved of all sin no matter

459
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:44,948
Speaker 0: what.".

460
00:28:45,711 --> 00:28:49,610
Speaker 1: So all the dirty kenigits who had done all sorts of nasty bits went down there.

461
00:28:50,092 --> 00:28:51,589
Speaker 0: And all the peasants who had nothing better to do.

462
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:53,230
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what I would do if I was a peasant.

463
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,049
Speaker 1: Better than peasanting.

464
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,490
Speaker 0: Eh, yeah, probably.

465
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:56,669
Speaker 0: And you sent them off to...

467
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,469
Speaker 1: Get to hang out with the kenigits.

468
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:09,670
Speaker 0: And, I mean, the Crusades, I'm not going to talk about the Crusades much, other than that it usually involved a bunch of Christian knights going out to the Holy Land and sacking towns and killing people.

469
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:13,269
Speaker 0: At one point they sacked Jerusalem and killed almost everyone in it.

470
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,547
Speaker 1: Yep, that's what they did.

471
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,450
Speaker 1: And Jerusalem's like the most defensible place on earth.

472
00:29:18,652 --> 00:29:19,788
Speaker 1: So that's not easy to do.

473
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,690
Speaker 0: I mean, it's kind of staggering.

474
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,788
Speaker 0: People think that the Dark Ages were like this dark time where all civilization ground to a halt.

475
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:27,485
Speaker 0: No.

476
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:42,969
Speaker 0: There were large, fortified, well-defended cities and there were large armies who made their way from Europe, like Western Europe, all the way to the Holy Land and still had enough force to lay month-long sieges to large cities.

477
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:47,709
Speaker 1: You need to lay a month-long siege to those cities because there's really no other way to get through.

478
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:53,550
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're ever bored, just go to Wikipedia and read all the articles about the Crusades.

479
00:29:54,231 --> 00:29:58,622
Speaker 0: They're not the simple things that most people have learned about, and there were a lot of them.

480
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:06,448
Speaker 1: And it's really cool because even if you read all of these terrible stories and they make you sad, there's all sorts of cool kenigits to look at.

481
00:30:08,412 --> 00:30:10,849
Speaker 1: And paintings of kenigits, and yeah.

482
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,710
Speaker 1: Even though the kenigits are the bad guys, which kind of sucks.

483
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:20,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, though to their credit, some of the points they were actually trying to repulse the Moorish invaders who were striking back.

484
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

485
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:26,010
Speaker 0: And of course, this all spiraled into the Middle East we know and love today.

486
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:32,249
Speaker 1: Hey, you know, talking about Moorish invaders, it's not really related, but I guess there's some connection in my brain.

487
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,429
Speaker 1: Attila the Hun wasn't the greatest guy.

488
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,806
Speaker 0: Nah, he really wasn't.

489
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:36,430
Speaker 1: Nah.

490
00:30:37,771 --> 00:30:39,850
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's all we gotta say about him.

491
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,490
Speaker 1: Barbarian, army, killing, raping, pillaging.

492
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are worse guys than him by far.

493
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:46,689
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, for sure.

494
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,715
Speaker 0: Like Triple H. Triple H.

495
00:30:48,816 --> 00:30:50,189
Speaker 1: So we just learned about this guy.

496
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,352
Speaker 1: Dr.

497
00:30:51,372 --> 00:30:52,316
Speaker 1: H. H. Holmes.

498
00:30:55,452 --> 00:30:56,249
Speaker 1: H-O-L-M-E-S.

499
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,630
Speaker 0: He got his doctorate from the University of Michigan.

500
00:30:59,377 --> 00:30:59,586
Speaker 0: Awesome.

501
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:00,469
Speaker 0: What the hell?

502
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:06,616
Speaker 1: Okay, so I think his real name, according to Wikipedia at least, was Herman Webster Mudgett.

503
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:11,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw a slightly different name given on Snopes, but it's verifiable that this guy existed.

504
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:12,750
Speaker 1: Yes.

505
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,020
Speaker 1: Now, what did H. H. Holmes do?

506
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:22,250
Speaker 1: that made him so bad that he was equally bad to the likes of Mother Teresa and Abraham Lincoln?

507
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,308
Speaker 0: This is gonna sound like we're making it up.

508
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:26,108
Speaker 1: I thought they were making it up.

509
00:31:26,712 --> 00:31:28,170
Speaker 0: He built a torture castle.

510
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:29,670
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, okay.

511
00:31:29,995 --> 00:31:30,210
Speaker 1: Alright.

512
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,133
Speaker 1: So the World's Fair was in Chicago in 1893.

513
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,450
Speaker 1: You know what the World's Fair is, right?

514
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:36,370
Speaker 0: I assume everyone does.

515
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,890
Speaker 0: It's something that doesn't really happen anymore, because no one cares.

516
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:43,427
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the World's Fair was awesome, and the last awesome World's Fair was in Queens, New York.

517
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:47,250
Speaker 1: But anyway, in 1893, the World's Fair was in Chicago.

518
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:54,130
Speaker 1: So he built a hotel in Chicago so that he could make a lot of money, because hell, the World's Fair is coming to town.

519
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:59,009
Speaker 1: A lot of people are gonna stay in a hotel, they'll stay in your hotel, and you'll make a shit ton of money.

520
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:02,770
Speaker 1: And World's Fairs, they're not like the summer fair that lasts a few months.

521
00:32:03,512 --> 00:32:05,170
Speaker 1: The World's Fair lasts for years.

522
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,930
Speaker 1: So this is gonna be quite a profitable business.

523
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:20,089
Speaker 1: Now he built this hotel, and well, he filled the hotel with gas chambers and torture traps and all sorts of evil, nasty bits.

524
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:29,830
Speaker 0: He called it his castle, and he hired all these different contractors, so it's not like one guy built the whole thing and could call the police and say, "Hey, this guy built gas

525
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,422
Speaker 0: chambers.".

526
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:37,890
Speaker 0: One guy would lay the gas pipes, then another guy would extend the gas pipes, then another guy would make these rooms soundproof that, "Oh, this is a sound studio," or whatnot.

527
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:41,110
Speaker 0: And no one person could really figure out what was going on in there.

528
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:49,484
Speaker 1: Yep, the bottom store, he had shops, the top store, he had his office, and all the middle places had a maze of windowless rooms.

529
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:51,070
Speaker 1: that were the hotel rooms.

530
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:58,370
Speaker 0: And the soundproof gas/torture rooms, where he would lock the girls up that he was torturing, and he would just, on a whim, send the gas in and kill them.

531
00:32:58,870 --> 00:32:58,938
Speaker 1: Yep.

532
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:02,590
Speaker 1: And he, of course, did all sorts of evil things.

533
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:06,090
Speaker 1: He had a chute that he would put bodies in, and the bodies would go right to the basement.

534
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:15,430
Speaker 0: And then in the basement, he had lime pits and various chemical means of disposing of bodies, in addition to fire pits and crematoriums and all sorts of fun stuff.

535
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,158
Speaker 1: Yep.

536
00:33:16,892 --> 00:33:18,870
Speaker 1: And it was pretty, pretty nasty, this guy.

537
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:26,950
Speaker 0: They got him for, I think, 23 murders in the end, but it's estimated that he killed up to 200 people over the course of his murdering.

538
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:27,739
Speaker 1: Yep.

539
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:35,750
Speaker 1: And even when the World's Fair ended, he went around the country murdering and killing and all sorts of nastiness.

540
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:43,807
Speaker 0: They eventually caught him because his castle burned down, and the firefighters found all these human remains in it.

541
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,067
Speaker 1: Good job.

542
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:47,629
Speaker 0: And then there was an investigation, and whoa.

543
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,049
Speaker 1: But don't worry, Triple H got his in the end.

544
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,430
Speaker 1: He was hanged.

545
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,410
Speaker 1: But here's the thing.

546
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:55,930
Speaker 1: This is great.

547
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,464
Speaker 1: There is a funny story about when H.H.

548
00:33:58,524 --> 00:33:59,550
Speaker 1: Holmes was hanged.

549
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,910
Speaker 1: He went up to get hanged, and he says to the hangman, "Don't bungle," which says, "Don't screw up my hanging.

550
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,060
Speaker 1: I want to just die right

551
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,342
Speaker 1: away.".

552
00:34:10,491 --> 00:34:14,790
Speaker 1: So the hangman, of course, hanged him, but he screwed up the hanging.

553
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:28,964
Speaker 1: He didn't snap Holmes' neck on the first go, so Holmes hung there for like 15 minutes strangling and dying slowly and painfully, which I guess is the worst way that they were going to make him go.

554
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:31,014
Speaker 1: So H.H.

555
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:33,429
Speaker 1: Holmes, bad dude.

556
00:34:34,632 --> 00:34:35,286
Speaker 1: Bad dude.

557
00:34:36,614 --> 00:34:37,228
Speaker 1: Real bad.

558
00:34:37,732 --> 00:34:37,967
Speaker 0: Yeah.

559
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:39,728
Speaker 1: So here's another guy.

560
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,120
Speaker 1: He's from the 1400s.

561
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,610
Speaker 1: Ooh, back in the day.

562
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,908
Speaker 1: And he was French.

563
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:45,536
Speaker 1: Ho, ho, ho.

564
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,583
Speaker 1: Ho, ho, ho.

565
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:50,050
Speaker 0: Are you quite Finnish?

566
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:50,889
Speaker 1: Yeah.

567
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:58,208
Speaker 1: And his name was Gildere, G-I-L-L-E-S, space, D-E, space, R-A-I-S.

568
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:59,170
Speaker 1: Gildere.

569
00:35:00,877 --> 00:35:01,368
Speaker 1: What did he do?

570
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,388
Speaker 1: Well, he was some military guy, an aristocrat, you know, he had a lot of money, whatever.

571
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:14,548
Speaker 1: To sum it up, he teamed up with these two other people, and he raped and killed little boys.

572
00:35:15,275 --> 00:35:15,908
Speaker 1: A lot of them.

573
00:35:16,655 --> 00:35:17,169
Speaker 0: How many?

574
00:35:18,414 --> 00:35:18,678
Speaker 1: Um, God.

575
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:23,130
Speaker 1: Too many.

576
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:35,769
Speaker 1: Basically the scary part isn't how many he did it to, it's that what him and his friends would do is they would like torture the little boys, rape them, whatever, mutilate them, scary things.

577
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,237
Speaker 0: Oh, fun.

578
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:46,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they would put like the heads on a stake, on stakes, of whatever boys they had that night, and then like decide amongst themselves who was the most beautiful.

579
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:50,990
Speaker 0: Wow, that's like, that's like something out of a terrible manga.

580
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:57,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, these guys are just like extreme sadists of nuttiness with the little boys and little girls.

581
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:00,849
Speaker 1: Although he preferred, this guy preferred little boys.

582
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:12,848
Speaker 1: And basically what happened is the church like wanted to get his land or something, and during that they discovered what he was doing and they caught him.

583
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,769
Speaker 1: And he was hanged, I think.

584
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:17,508
Speaker 0: Good deal.

585
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,030
Speaker 1: Yup, hanged.

586
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,470
Speaker 1: It seems like they hang all these bad dudes.

587
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,710
Speaker 1: So yeah, this guy is king of the little boy rapers.

588
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,609
Speaker 1: You think like the Catholic priests are bad.

589
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:28,109
Speaker 1: Gilda Ray.

590
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,490
Speaker 0: Though speaking of Catholics, there's always our friends the Borgias family.

591
00:36:34,054 --> 00:36:34,888
Speaker 0: Ah, poison poison.

592
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:35,669
Speaker 0: Poison poison.

593
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,230
Speaker 0: Poison poison.

594
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:42,970
Speaker 0: Even though, because actually the poisoning Borgias family, they probably did poison a lot of people.

595
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,168
Speaker 0: There's a lot of evidence that they did.

596
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:53,170
Speaker 0: But there's also a lot of evidence that much of the writings and stories about this family were largely just propaganda by their enemies.

597
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,250
Speaker 0: Because remember, the winners write history.

598
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:06,029
Speaker 0: And it's very hard to tell historically whether writings about someone are accurate or if they were just the writings of other people's opinions of them.

599
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says actually some people say that Gilda Ray might have actually been just a normal dude.

600
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:16,285
Speaker 1: And the Catholic church wanting to, you know, get him for whatever reason made up all this stuff.

601
00:37:16,691 --> 00:37:20,250
Speaker 1: But that's probably unlikely in this particular case, but it could be.

602
00:37:20,431 --> 00:37:20,808
Speaker 1: We don't know.

603
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,510
Speaker 1: No one was alive in 1400.

604
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,306
Speaker 1: No one knows Gilda Ray.

605
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,110
Speaker 1: None of those Catholic priests or whatever is still around.

606
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,370
Speaker 0: Well this applies to our last one too, which we're not going to say until the end.

607
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,525
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, the last one.

608
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:33,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, the last, last guy we're going to talk about.

609
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:40,930
Speaker 0: Because there's a lot of evidence that, I mean, the last guy was a bad dude and he wasn't all together there in the head.

610
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,189
Speaker 1: Well let's hold on, because he's the last dude.

611
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:50,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I just want to say that it's, there's evidence that he wasn't nearly as bad as people have written about him.

612
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:53,210
Speaker 1: Yep, but that's fine.

613
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,310
Speaker 0: Let's move a little away from the death and back to work.

614
00:37:55,391 --> 00:37:57,389
Speaker 1: You know what I just thought about was a bad guy?

615
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:57,556
Speaker 0: Who?

616
00:37:58,471 --> 00:37:58,850
Speaker 0: Rasputin.

617
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,205
Speaker 0: ♪ Ra ra Rasputin ♪ Yeah, he was a bad guy.

618
00:38:01,205 --> 00:38:09,648
Speaker 0: ♪ R-r-r-russian queen ♪ Yeah, I pretty much rank him with all those Randy pseudo-science mess with people cult-y crazies.

619
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:12,130
Speaker 1: Yep, he's just like all of them, L. Ron Hubbard, bad guy.

620
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was about to say L. Ron Hubbard.

621
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,890
Speaker 0: I don't think we need to say why L. Ron Hubbard's on the list.

622
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,721
Speaker 1: Nope.

623
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,049
Speaker 0: Zenu, real bad guy.

624
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,770
Speaker 0: I mean, what the hell, he nuked billions and billions of people.

625
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:23,589
Speaker 0: That's not cool.

626
00:38:23,974 --> 00:38:24,528
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

627
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:27,850
Speaker 1: L. Ron Hubbard didn't nuke people.

628
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,129
Speaker 1: The made-up alien made-up nuked people.

629
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,309
Speaker 1: You get the idea.

630
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,570
Speaker 0: Those indigo children will come get us now.

631
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,290
Speaker 1: Oh, they will.

632
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:42,710
Speaker 0: But let's back away from death and move toward corruption a bit, because I'd like to name two of the most corrupt individuals in American history.

633
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,570
Speaker 0: We've got Boss Tweed of Tammany Hall.

634
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:54,169
Speaker 0: Very briefly, he was the head of probably the largest, most corrupt political machine to ever grace the world.

635
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:55,709
Speaker 1: More corrupt than what we have now?

636
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:04,689
Speaker 0: Imagine going around a city, grabbing hobos and paying them with liquor to vote, and then going from district to district having them all vote for you.

637
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,128
Speaker 1: We should do that now.

638
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:08,069
Speaker 0: It's tougher now.

639
00:39:08,511 --> 00:39:09,370
Speaker 0: Not that much tougher.

640
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,570
Speaker 0: I could have said any name when I went to vote before.

641
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,010
Speaker 0: They don't check.

642
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,576
Speaker 0: The only people running the voting booths are old people who have nothing better to do.

643
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:20,309
Speaker 0: Or punk kids whose parents made them do it, or their school made them do it.

644
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:20,858
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

645
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:26,809
Speaker 0: But along with Boss Tweed, I'd like to talk about my favorite president of the United States, Taft.

646
00:39:27,571 --> 00:39:28,309
Speaker 1: That fat fat.

647
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:29,950
Speaker 0: Oh my God, that guy is fat.

648
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,129
Speaker 1: Fat bastard.

649
00:39:31,832 --> 00:39:33,310
Speaker 0: He was fat and corrupt.

650
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:37,704
Speaker 0: There's a speech of his that I was gonna play in this podcast, but I don't want to bother with cleaning it up.

651
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,090
Speaker 1: Tyrone, you fat bastard.

652
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:44,369
Speaker 0: Read about Taft.

653
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,010
Speaker 0: He's just the most useless, corrupt president ever.

654
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,990
Speaker 1: Teapot Dome scandal.

655
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,910
Speaker 1: You think Watergate's bad.

656
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,289
Speaker 1: Go check out the Teapot Dome real estate scam.

657
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:58,569
Speaker 0: Not to mention just the rampant corruption and bribery that was going on in Congress and in his administration.

658
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:05,210
Speaker 1: This guy basically just became president and just did a bunch of corrupt, evil things to get lots and lots of money and evil and whatnot.

659
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,069
Speaker 1: That's all he did.

660
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,750
Speaker 1: Nothing useful.

661
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,090
Speaker 0: He was also incredibly fat.

662
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,149
Speaker 1: It looks like he's a corrupt guy.

663
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:15,269
Speaker 0: He looks like a big ball with a little head on top of it.

664
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,169
Speaker 1: With a mustache and a funny hat.

665
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:17,482
Speaker 1: Yeah.

666
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:22,810
Speaker 1: And it's old timey, although it's more old timey than the dancing video.

667
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:27,806
Speaker 0: I mean, I can't think of many people politically who have been more corrupt than Taft and Boss Tweed.

668
00:40:29,797 --> 00:40:30,109
Speaker 1: Yeah.

669
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,210
Speaker 1: I mean, not even people we have today.

670
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:39,270
Speaker 1: They're not going around flickering up, maybe de-balled with just fixing the election machines.

671
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:39,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,489
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

673
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:47,589
Speaker 0: It's actually easier to talk about older people than newer people because it's hard to see now what the ramifications of people's actions are going to be.

674
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:50,050
Speaker 1: Back in the day, also, stuff was obvious.

675
00:40:50,372 --> 00:40:50,809
Speaker 1: Like, "Hey, look.

676
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,266
Speaker 1: There's a guy flickering up hobos and telling them to

677
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:53,528
Speaker 1: vote.".

678
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:53,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

679
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,884
Speaker 1: Nowadays, it's, "They made some machines, grumble

680
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:58,346
Speaker 1: grumble.".

681
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:01,410
Speaker 0: At least back in the day, people were just corrupt.

682
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,410
Speaker 0: Like, "I'm a corrupt dude.

683
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,080
Speaker 0: I'm doing corrupt

684
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:03,405
Speaker 0: things.".

685
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:06,530
Speaker 0: Now it's hard to tell if people are actually corrupt or just stupid.

686
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,355
Speaker 1: Yeah.

687
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,990
Speaker 1: Maybe back in the day, they couldn't tell if people were corrupt or stupid either.

688
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:13,770
Speaker 1: And that's why it took so long and now we realize they were corrupt.

689
00:41:14,095 --> 00:41:14,408
Speaker 0: I think.

690
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,886
Speaker 0: I think history will vindicate us.

691
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:16,616
Speaker 1: Maybe.

692
00:41:18,315 --> 00:41:19,510
Speaker 1: I could love to see the history books.

693
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,347
Speaker 1: The history books now say, "All the people in the past were

694
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:22,649
Speaker 1: evil.".

695
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,685
Speaker 1: The history books 200 years from now, "All the people in the past were

696
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:26,128
Speaker 1: stupid."

697
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:27,770
Speaker 1: Stupid, stupid, stupid.

698
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:31,290
Speaker 0: Well, Futurama, they always refer to this era as the stupid ages.

699
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:33,709
Speaker 1: That's right.

700
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,250
Speaker 1: Those are the stupid ages.

701
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:48,390
Speaker 0: I really do wonder what the history books are going to say 50 years from now about Bush and the war and the terror, whatnot, and the secret prison camps in Eastern Europe.

702
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,630
Speaker 1: Depends who writes the books.

703
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:53,276
Speaker 0: Go back to 1996 and tell someone the U.S.

704
00:41:53,296 --> 00:42:00,670
Speaker 0: in the year 2005 is going to start building secret prison camps in Eastern Europe.

705
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:02,808
Speaker 0: See what they say.

706
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:06,909
Speaker 1: Nowadays... Well, we had those Japanese prison camps in World War II.

707
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what we say about those...

708
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,490
Speaker 1: Those aren't really in the history books so much.

709
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,609
Speaker 0: We don't say so much about them.

710
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:12,348
Speaker 1: No, we don't.

711
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,510
Speaker 1: So they're not going to say so much about these ones either.

712
00:42:14,772 --> 00:42:15,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the fact is...

713
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,328
Speaker 1: Maybe even less.

714
00:42:17,692 --> 00:42:18,570
Speaker 0: People... They're in the news.

715
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:21,250
Speaker 0: Like, everyone knows, but yet no one cares.

716
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,249
Speaker 1: Because they're not in the prisons.

717
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:24,277
Speaker 0: Yeah.

718
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:27,647
Speaker 0: And then there was no one left to speak of it.

719
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,069
Speaker 1: But no one cares.

720
00:42:29,855 --> 00:42:30,107
Speaker 1: You know?

721
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:38,849
Speaker 1: No matter how much you know it's going to happen, I mean, the people waiting for the Holocaust in Germany, they knew it was going on.

722
00:42:39,151 --> 00:42:41,850
Speaker 1: They knew all these things that we know now, but it doesn't matter.

723
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:43,647
Speaker 1: There's not much you can do.

724
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:44,970
Speaker 0: You know what?

725
00:42:45,091 --> 00:42:45,870
Speaker 0: Why don't we just move to Finland?

726
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,048
Speaker 0: At least I'll get good music.

727
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:48,828
Speaker 1: Finland, Finland, Finland.

728
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,070
Speaker 0: Dibby dibby dop, dibby dop, bop bop.

729
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:52,826
Speaker 0: Okay.

730
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:53,750
Speaker 0: Dibby dibba bop bop.

731
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,389
Speaker 1: So, who else is bad?

732
00:42:57,475 --> 00:42:58,090
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson.

733
00:42:58,916 --> 00:42:59,327
Speaker 0: That guy.

734
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,930
Speaker 1: Is he a bad enough dude to rescue the president?

735
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:14,625
Speaker 0: I don't remember the guy's name, but anyone who's seen Hotel Rwanda, you know they have the radio voice guy who was like, "Cut the tall trees, cut the tall

736
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:15,448
Speaker 0: trees!".

737
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:35,350
Speaker 0: That wasn't one dude, and that was kind of dramatized, but there was the radio station that was playing that sort of propaganda and inciting people to go out and genocide, and I forget the guy's name, but it was this Belgian guy who ran that radio station, and he was behind a large part of the genocide propaganda in Rwanda.

738
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,430
Speaker 1: And he went to international war crimes court, and now he's in jail.

739
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:40,849
Speaker 0: In fact, he's still in jail.

740
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:42,068
Speaker 1: And he's gonna stay there.

741
00:43:42,631 --> 00:43:43,770
Speaker 0: He'll get out in a while.

742
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:46,230
Speaker 1: And then someone will immediately come and beat the shit out of him.

743
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:49,810
Speaker 0: We were thinking, because he's gonna get out in a few years, actually, because he's been there a while.

744
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,710
Speaker 1: Because I don't think he actually killed anyone.

745
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,970
Speaker 1: That's why he's not there forever.

746
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, not like that general guy.

747
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,190
Speaker 1: He just told people to kill people.

748
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:58,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's a really scary-looking guy.

749
00:43:59,010 --> 00:43:59,228
Speaker 1: Definitely.

750
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,769
Speaker 1: He looks like a terrorist when you look at him.

751
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:02,590
Speaker 0: I mean, he was born a long time ago.

752
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:03,407
Speaker 0: He's pretty old now.

753
00:44:03,931 --> 00:44:10,370
Speaker 0: And he was part of the dying days of the Belgian adventures into Africa.

754
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,690
Speaker 0: Now people think, you know, the Spanish were terrible when they conquered the native people.

755
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,110
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we didn't talk about any Columbus or Conquistadors.

756
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,329
Speaker 1: Those are bad dudes.

757
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:20,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'll say this.

758
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,710
Speaker 1: Wraiths and Native Americans and Mayas and Aztecs.

759
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:31,930
Speaker 0: If you wanna rank the nations of Europe and how they treated the natives they dealt with, the Nordic peoples and the French were probably the best.

760
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:38,869
Speaker 0: They were no saints, but they probably treated the people they were subjugating or invading or whatnot better than anyone.

761
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,149
Speaker 0: Then the English were pretty bad.

762
00:44:41,693 --> 00:44:43,290
Speaker 0: The Spanish were real bad.

763
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,310
Speaker 0: I mean, Conquistadors.

764
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:50,770
Speaker 0: The Portuguese were significantly more vicious than the Spanish were, all things considered.

765
00:44:51,552 --> 00:44:52,848
Speaker 0: But nobody topped the Belgians.

766
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,350
Speaker 0: You wouldn't think, but the Belgians were the brutal ones who marched around Africa just murdering.

767
00:44:59,310 --> 00:44:59,376
Speaker 1: Wow.

768
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:00,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

769
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:03,910
Speaker 1: So they kept it up all the way up to Rwanda.

770
00:45:04,975 --> 00:45:05,988
Speaker 0: At least this one guy did.

771
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:08,323
Speaker 1: Carry on the legacy of evil.

772
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,109
Speaker 0: We should go to whatever place he's actually being held in.

773
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:15,609
Speaker 1: Some Eastern European secret prison that we can't get to.

774
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:21,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait for him to be released and just walk up and give him a swift punch to the cock and then walk away.

775
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:22,689
Speaker 1: I don't think it's cock.

776
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,647
Speaker 1: Maybe, I don't know.

777
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,269
Speaker 1: It's probably hardened in many a prison ass.

778
00:45:28,538 --> 00:45:28,770
Speaker 0: Okay.

779
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,650
Speaker 1: Just imagine.

780
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,730
Speaker 0: I don't know what it's like in a war crimes trial or war crimes prison.

781
00:45:34,856 --> 00:45:35,049
Speaker 1: Yeah.

782
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:41,130
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like we've got local county jail, which is like drunk guy locked up laughing.

783
00:45:41,532 --> 00:45:43,769
Speaker 0: Or rim was trespassing in a factory again.

784
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:44,270
Speaker 1: Yeah.

785
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,710
Speaker 1: Then we've got state prison, which is pound me in the ass state prison.

786
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:49,200
Speaker 1: Great.

787
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:54,070
Speaker 1: Then we've got federal pound me in the ass prison, which is god damn.

788
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:01,770
Speaker 1: But there's also the nice happy prisons for guys who evade taxes or do some corrupt scam.

789
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,670
Speaker 0: It seems like the worse you are, the nicer prison they put you in after a point.

790
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:10,270
Speaker 0: Like if you kill like 10 people, you go to a bad prison.

791
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,208
Speaker 1: Very bad.

792
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:14,469
Speaker 0: If you kill 100 people, you go to a bad prison and someone shivs you in there.

793
00:46:15,512 --> 00:46:19,547
Speaker 0: If you kill a million people, they put you under house arrest and bring you food for the rest of your life.

794
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:20,974
Speaker 1: Yeah.

795
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,287
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with that.

796
00:46:22,771 --> 00:46:25,570
Speaker 0: Like Eddie Izzard's thing, you know, pull pot and killed all those people.

797
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:26,447
Speaker 0: He's in his house now.

798
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,709
Speaker 0: Just fucking don't go in that house.

799
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:29,498
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:37,450
Speaker 1: But I mean, where are the international prisons when they lock up?

801
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,310
Speaker 1: Like let's say they find said I'm guilty and give them life in prison.

802
00:46:40,392 --> 00:46:41,008
Speaker 1: Where do they put him?

803
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:42,089
Speaker 0: Uh, you know what?

804
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,890
Speaker 0: I'll bet a quick Google would answer that question.

805
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,239
Speaker 1: Yeah.

806
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:48,310
Speaker 1: There must be some crazy international war crimes prison.

807
00:46:48,491 --> 00:46:51,850
Speaker 0: Let's do a show on international law.

808
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:53,350
Speaker 1: All right.

809
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:54,610
Speaker 1: Cause I don't know a lot about it.

810
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,650
Speaker 0: Something I don't know a lot about either.

811
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,290
Speaker 1: I know that the international court doesn't have a lot of power over other people.

812
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

813
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,209
Speaker 0: Partly because the United States is all for the international court whenever it's ruling against someone else.

814
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:10,429
Speaker 0: But the moment it turns its eye toward the US, we always say something to the lines of you can't do anything to us.

815
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:11,130
Speaker 0: He was no authority.

816
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:11,583
Speaker 0: Leave us alone.

817
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:12,510
Speaker 1: Exactly.

818
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:13,398
Speaker 1: Yeah.

819
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:15,270
Speaker 1: Same thing with the UN in general.

820
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,869
Speaker 1: The US does the same thing.

821
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:17,443
Speaker 0: Yeah.

822
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:17,988
Speaker 0: The UN.

823
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:19,670
Speaker 0: Whatever.

824
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:21,129
Speaker 0: I could do a whole show on the UN.

825
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:22,170
Speaker 1: Okay.

826
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:24,470
Speaker 1: So who is a bad guy we can talk about?

827
00:47:25,012 --> 00:47:25,988
Speaker 0: Other than our last guy.

828
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:27,970
Speaker 1: Blackbeard was pretty bad.

829
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was.

830
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,530
Speaker 0: But how much of that is story versus how much of that is fact?

831
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,949
Speaker 1: I don't know, but it's all pirates, so it's all cool by me.

832
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:36,068
Speaker 0: Yeah.

833
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:37,634
Speaker 1: Huh.

834
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,610
Speaker 1: Were there any evil show guns we could talk about?

835
00:47:40,973 --> 00:47:42,150
Speaker 0: I don't know much about them really.

836
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, or evil Chinese emperors, or kings of Siam, or Mongolians.

837
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,669
Speaker 1: Genghis Khan was bad.

838
00:47:49,171 --> 00:47:49,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was.

839
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:50,386
Speaker 1: Bad guy.

840
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:55,670
Speaker 0: Uh, there was a whole line of Russian patriarchs who were variously evil and corrupt.

841
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:57,850
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I know who's bad.

842
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,868
Speaker 1: Pancho Villa.

843
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:00,549
Speaker 0: Pancho Villa.

844
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:02,010
Speaker 1: Pancho Villa was bad.

845
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:03,069
Speaker 0: And you know what?

846
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:04,409
Speaker 0: While we're at it, Che Guevara.

847
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:05,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of bad.

848
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,130
Speaker 1: Not as bad as Pancho Villa.

849
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:21,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Che Guevara is one of those people where a lot of punk kids and college kids and people out there who are all, you know, like college socialists, they always, like, they have the poster of Che and they always talk like, "Ooh, he understood," or they look at him as this hero.

850
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:26,510
Speaker 0: And he was just a warlord, fighter, like anyone else in that era.

851
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,609
Speaker 0: He wasn't anything special.

852
00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:28,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:30,450
Speaker 0: And he was a fairly brutal murdering person.

854
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,190
Speaker 1: His face and the piece of artwork that depicts his face is just, like, iconic.

855
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:37,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

856
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:43,309
Speaker 0: Actually, I do want to see Motorcycle Diaries, which is a semi-documentary about him, but is mostly just fluff.

857
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:43,842
Speaker 0: Yeah.

858
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:44,489
Speaker 0: But it looks good.

859
00:48:45,110 --> 00:48:45,869
Speaker 1: I'll see it one day.

860
00:48:46,492 --> 00:48:46,582
Speaker 0: Yeah.

861
00:48:48,296 --> 00:48:48,362
Speaker 1: Ah.

862
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:49,829
Speaker 1: So, Pancho Villa.

863
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,029
Speaker 0: Pancho Villa.

864
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:58,166
Speaker 0: A lot of people think he's this funny guy, and he was really just a murdering, thuggish kind of bandit.

865
00:48:59,011 --> 00:48:59,495
Speaker 0: The U.S.

866
00:48:59,515 --> 00:49:01,230
Speaker 0: sent troops to try and get him in Mexico.

867
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:02,409
Speaker 1: They failed.

868
00:49:02,878 --> 00:49:19,846
Speaker 0: He eventually... Now, this is a funny story, and I'm led to believe that this is true, but it's really hard to verify 100%, but it's said by his second in command, the guy who held him in his arms as Pancho Villa died, that Pancho Villa's last words were, "Don't let it end like this.

869
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:21,302
Speaker 0: Tell them I said

870
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:21,769
Speaker 0: something.".

871
00:49:23,691 --> 00:49:29,370
Speaker 0: Now, if that's true, what kind of asshole was his second in command to tell that story to anyone?

872
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:47,168
Speaker 1: You know, when your boss is Pancho Villa, someone who is so bad that a long time later, two idiots doing a podcast, put you on their list of bad guys, then your second in command isn't going to be the greatest guy.

873
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:49,149
Speaker 0: I just like our list.

874
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,670
Speaker 0: It's like, "Serial killer, serial killer, evil guy.

875
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:56,126
Speaker 0: Abraham Lincoln, Mother Teresa, serial killer, evil

876
00:49:56,166 --> 00:49:56,488
Speaker 0: guy.".

877
00:49:57,091 --> 00:49:58,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they're all bad.

878
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of serial killers we left off.

879
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,750
Speaker 1: Oh, Charles Manson.

880
00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:05,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Boston Strangler.

881
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:08,490
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean, Bin Laden's a bad guy.

882
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:09,670
Speaker 0: Jack the Ripper.

883
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,149
Speaker 1: The problem with Jack the Ripper is we don't know about Jack the Ripper because of the mystery.

884
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:14,570
Speaker 1: Not

885
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:29,179
Speaker 0: only does no one really know who he was, DNA evidence just now, like I saw this while we were doing the show, leads people to believe that the person who killed many of the people who claimed to be killed by Jack the Ripper was actually a woman,

886
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:30,986
Speaker 1: and

887
00:50:31,367 --> 00:50:33,669
Speaker 0: Jack the Ripper may or may not have existed.

888
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:35,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of like Jesus.

889
00:50:37,291 --> 00:50:43,788
Speaker 0: A lot of people were killed by thugs in that time, and a lot of people were murdered, and you know what?

890
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:44,148
Speaker 0: You know what?

891
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:45,270
Speaker 0: I know who Jack the Ripper was.

892
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:46,308
Speaker 0: I got it all sorted out.

893
00:50:46,971 --> 00:50:47,990
Speaker 0: He was shown in bat.

894
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:48,452
Speaker 0: Oh.

895
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,570
Speaker 0: That explains everything.

896
00:50:51,373 --> 00:50:52,268
Speaker 1: Some Puerto Rican guy.

897
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:56,369
Speaker 0: It was just Maromi Chan.

898
00:50:57,192 --> 00:50:58,149
Speaker 1: Some Puerto Rican guy.

899
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:00,168
Speaker 1: That's who it was.

900
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:02,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're getting kind of silly here.

901
00:51:03,372 --> 00:51:06,650
Speaker 0: We can't think of any more specific people that are worth talking about.

902
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:07,868
Speaker 1: I think we can.

903
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:14,730
Speaker 0: All right, but then we're going to have a lot of us padding time out on the air while we think of it, because I said I'm not cutting anything out of this episode.

904
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:16,429
Speaker 1: Not even silence?

905
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,630
Speaker 0: No, not even silence.

906
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:18,429
Speaker 0: We've got to keep talking.

907
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:19,699
Speaker 0: Yeah.

908
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,489
Speaker 1: Rim's a bad guy.

909
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:23,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've murdered thousands.

910
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,169
Speaker 0: Millions.

911
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,610
Speaker 1: There are a lot of South American dictators who are pretty bad.

912
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:37,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I blame most of that on the US, because most of those dictators are ones that our CIA put into power to keep the communists out.

913
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:41,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'd rather have some evil dictator in South America than a communist one.

914
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,189
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, look at what we did in the Middle East, too.

915
00:51:44,571 --> 00:51:47,369
Speaker 0: We funded Iran, and we funded Iraq, and we got them to fight each other.

916
00:51:48,251 --> 00:51:52,965
Speaker 0: And then when the both of them said, "Eh, screw you, America," suddenly we're all in a tiff.

917
00:51:54,253 --> 00:51:55,369
Speaker 0: We gave them the weapons.

918
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:56,670
Speaker 1: Yeah.

919
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:59,590
Speaker 0: All right, I can round out the list real easily.

920
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:09,149
Speaker 0: Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney, Bush, Karl Rove, Karl Rove, I could write a little song.

921
00:52:12,812 --> 00:52:16,390
Speaker 1: All the evil sultans, and the Ayatollahs.

922
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, people who had the title Maharaja.

923
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:19,489
Speaker 1: Not all of them.

924
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,229
Speaker 0: No, not all of them, but many of them.

925
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,148
Speaker 1: Many, yes.

926
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:23,406
Speaker 0: Of course, many kings, too.

927
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,389
Speaker 0: Kings were often corrupt.

928
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:27,550
Speaker 1: King Evil, King Bastard.

929
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:29,686
Speaker 0: I'm King Bastard II.

930
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,309
Speaker 0: I am bastard, son of bitch.

931
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:34,509
Speaker 1: Ivan the Terrible.

932
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:36,010
Speaker 1: Ivan the Terrible was bad.

933
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:37,869
Speaker 0: Ivan the Terrible wasn't so bad.

934
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,790
Speaker 0: He gets a bad rap.

935
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:41,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he was still terrible compared to Peter the Great.

936
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

937
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,950
Speaker 0: Now, I want to point out, one, Peter the Great is kind of badass.

938
00:52:45,573 --> 00:52:46,909
Speaker 0: I've got a biography of him.

939
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:47,869
Speaker 1: And he was great.

940
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,250
Speaker 0: It's in the downstairs bathroom.

941
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:50,709
Speaker 1: Just like Alexander, who was also great.

942
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,773
Speaker 0: Alexander was kind of a ...

943
00:52:54,773 --> 00:52:56,609
Speaker 1: He wasn't as great as Peter, but he was still great.

944
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,470
Speaker 0: Do you actually know, or are you just going based on their titles?

945
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,650
Speaker 1: I know he did some great stuff.

946
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:02,427
Speaker 0: What'd he do?

947
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:08,050
Speaker 1: He went around conquering the world, naming every damn city after himself, except for one that he named after his horse.

948
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,008
Speaker 0: That is indeed true.

949
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:09,790
Speaker 0: All right.

950
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:14,729
Speaker 1: And then he made an awesome library, but then he also did all sorts of bad things, conquering and being evil.

951
00:53:15,071 --> 00:53:16,069
Speaker 1: But that doesn't matter.

952
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:22,570
Speaker 0: Actually, most of the bad that came of what Alexander did was after he was dead.

953
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:23,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

954
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:33,208
Speaker 0: Because the moment he died, all the people who were in a position to become the next leader looked at each other and said, "And then there was a big fight and crazy

955
00:53:33,248 --> 00:53:33,569
Speaker 0: wars.".

956
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:38,110
Speaker 1: And it broke up into a bunch of pieces instead of being one giant piece that Alexander had.

957
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,490
Speaker 0: Not that one giant piece of anything is great.

958
00:53:40,692 --> 00:53:41,910
Speaker 1: No, it's really bad, actually.

959
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:53,850
Speaker 0: I mean, look at the Polyponnesian Wars, and back when, before there were really nation states, there were city states, and there were all the Greek city states, and they were all pretty much independent, and they were all pretty much constantly fighting with each other.

960
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:59,710
Speaker 0: I mean, Sparta and Athens were always at war, and everyone was fighting and back and forth, but they stayed to themselves.

961
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:07,869
Speaker 0: And then the Persians came and invaded, and suddenly, it's like, imagine, here's my slight explanation of the Greek Wars.

962
00:54:08,711 --> 00:54:17,309
Speaker 0: You walk into a bar, and there's a bunch of guys fighting with each other, and you bring your own bunch of guys, and you walk into the bar, and you walk over to one guy in the corner and start beating him up.

963
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:23,309
Speaker 0: Suddenly, everyone in the bar, all the people who were fighting with each other, turn, and they all, in a united front, attack you.

964
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:24,948
Speaker 0: That's Greece.

965
00:54:26,712 --> 00:54:28,269
Speaker 0: You can tell I'm stalling for time here.

966
00:54:28,955 --> 00:54:29,169
Speaker 0: Awesome.

967
00:54:29,412 --> 00:54:31,330
Speaker 0: Well, I was hoping you would think of someone else to talk about.

968
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,470
Speaker 1: I did, and I just forgot them, because you talked too long.

969
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:39,170
Speaker 0: Talk about Darius, or all the other kings of Persia.

970
00:54:40,312 --> 00:54:43,190
Speaker 0: If they would have left Greece alone, the world would have been a lot different today.

971
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:47,010
Speaker 1: There were a lot of evil mafia dudes throughout time.

972
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:50,650
Speaker 0: Al Capone, not so bad, all things considered.

973
00:54:50,811 --> 00:54:53,870
Speaker 1: Not really that bad, but a lot of Sicilian guys are motherfuckers.

974
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:55,610
Speaker 1: Like the guy they just got recently.

975
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:56,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

976
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:59,670
Speaker 0: To that guy's credit, he was on the lam for a long time.

977
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:00,308
Speaker 1: He was.

978
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:02,389
Speaker 0: They couldn't catch him, and he didn't really go very far.

979
00:55:03,999 --> 00:55:04,208
Speaker 1: Yeah.

980
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,670
Speaker 0: There's all the Nazis who escaped to South Africa.

981
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,769
Speaker 1: Vlad the Impaler was pretty bad.

982
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how much of that is truth?

983
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:22,930
Speaker 1: See, I'm not sure, because apparently some Romanian people say he's kind of a hero, that he killed bad guys, and he put their heads, you know, he just killed them in horrible ways, and put their heads on stakes.

984
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:29,128
Speaker 1: But history and different websites seem to say that he just kept killing people, because he was a bad guy.

985
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:32,685
Speaker 1: And, you know, they based Dracula on him, so, yeah.

986
00:55:35,350 --> 00:55:37,570
Speaker 0: Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, Cheney, Rove.

987
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,608
Speaker 1: That's not gonna work.

988
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:41,310
Speaker 0: It works pretty well.

989
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:41,827
Speaker 0: I said 'em.

990
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:42,767
Speaker 0: They're on my list.

991
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:44,266
Speaker 0: Great.

992
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:47,650
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone involved in the Project for New American Century is on my list.

993
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:49,073
Speaker 1: Mmm.

994
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:53,530
Speaker 1: Then I'll throw FDR out there, as the counterweight.

995
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like FDR a lot.

996
00:55:55,811 --> 00:56:01,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, he did a bunch of stuff that was good at the time, but it's fucking us now.

997
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:06,869
Speaker 0: Though it wouldn't really be screwing us so badly now if so many other mistakes hadn't been made after him.

998
00:56:07,361 --> 00:56:07,490
Speaker 1: I know.

999
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:12,210
Speaker 1: I mean- Plus, the stuff that he did that I liked is the stuff that doesn't exist anymore.

1000
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:12,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the CCC?

1001
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:13,844
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1002
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,290
Speaker 1: And the stuff that he did that I didn't like so much is the stuff that won't go away.

1003
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:18,410
Speaker 0: Like Social Security?

1004
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:18,855
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1005
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,690
Speaker 0: Social Security was supposed to be a safety net.

1006
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:25,450
Speaker 0: It's not supposed to be this, like, permanent- Originally, it wasn't supposed to be permanent.

1007
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:26,644
Speaker 1: Now it is.

1008
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,149
Speaker 0: Plus, think about it, FDR did so much.

1009
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:41,090
Speaker 1: I mean, basically everything we have now, FDR and what he did affects your life if you live in the United States more than Bush, what Bush has done.

1010
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,887
Speaker 0: So far.

1011
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:42,470
Speaker 1: Yep.

1012
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:47,848
Speaker 0: Well, I'd say if you live in certain parts of France and Germany, what FDR did affected you quite a bit too.

1013
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,348
Speaker 1: Yes, also, very much.

1014
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,789
Speaker 1: But not if you're living there now.

1015
00:56:52,598 --> 00:56:53,689
Speaker 1: Only if you lived there.

1016
00:56:54,170 --> 00:57:06,568
Speaker 1: The point is that me and my life, my life has been more affected by the actions of Franklin Delano Roosevelt that has been affected by Bill Clinton, who was president for eight years of my life.

1017
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:14,430
Speaker 0: I've been affected slightly more by recent presidents, you know, being investigated by the Secret Service and all that bullshit a few years ago.

1018
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:16,389
Speaker 1: Yep, but FDR is still more so.

1019
00:57:16,971 --> 00:57:19,849
Speaker 1: And he was president for 12 years, a long time ago.

1020
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:20,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was.

1021
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:22,267
Speaker 0: I would have voted for him.

1022
00:57:23,211 --> 00:57:24,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, the competition wasn't so high.

1023
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:25,126
Speaker 0: Do we?

1024
00:57:25,893 --> 00:57:26,670
Speaker 0: Do we defeat Strowman?

1025
00:57:27,390 --> 00:57:27,434
Speaker 1: Ah!

1026
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:29,348
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1027
00:57:30,894 --> 00:57:31,610
Speaker 0: Actually, it was Hoover.

1028
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:32,670
Speaker 0: I remember the Hoovervilles.

1029
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:33,798
Speaker 1: Great.

1030
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:35,017
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1031
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:36,689
Speaker 0: Well, I don't remember them.

1032
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:37,708
Speaker 0: I wasn't there.

1033
00:57:39,616 --> 00:57:41,329
Speaker 1: Oh, you remember learning about them.

1034
00:57:42,496 --> 00:57:43,550
Speaker 0: No, I'm actually a Highlander.

1035
00:57:44,595 --> 00:57:44,806
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

1036
00:57:45,218 --> 00:57:45,388
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1037
00:57:47,156 --> 00:57:48,149
Speaker 1: I think this episode's done.

1038
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:49,890
Speaker 0: I think we've descended into silliness.

1039
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:55,970
Speaker 0: Because thus, thus, without further ado, the final person we're going to talk about.

1040
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:56,889
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

1041
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:57,258
Speaker 1: Hooray.

1042
00:57:57,893 --> 00:57:58,348
Speaker 0: Uh, yes.

1043
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:11,090
Speaker 0: If anyone's still listening, I'm partly taking advantage of the fact that we upgraded the Libsyn so we can make episodes as long as we want, and you guys wanted a long episode, so I'm showing you right now, this is what you get when you get a long episode.

1044
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:15,589
Speaker 1: Well, no, because the point was we were going to do a long episode for E3 when we had stuff to say.

1045
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:19,010
Speaker 1: Making a long episode just by padding it out is completely different.

1046
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:23,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, the waiting on the E3 was good because that way we could cover all the stuff that came out.

1047
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:27,509
Speaker 1: Well, because it just so happened that the stuff that we didn't cover, new news came out about it the next day.

1048
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:28,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, which was good.

1049
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,209
Speaker 1: Lucky us.

1050
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:29,518
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1051
00:58:30,135 --> 00:58:30,430
Speaker 1: All right.

1052
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,669
Speaker 0: It was all part of the cunning plan.

1053
00:58:32,191 --> 00:58:33,610
Speaker 1: Oh, because we knew in advance.

1054
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,290
Speaker 1: We were just keeping it a secret.

1055
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,690
Speaker 0: So our final person.

1056
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:43,670
Speaker 1: And just so everyone knows, we record these podcasts like a month in advance, and we're just so psychic in our powers.

1057
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,529
Speaker 0: You better call Randy.

1058
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:45,129
Speaker 0: I better.

1059
00:58:46,052 --> 00:58:46,389
Speaker 0: All right.

1060
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:54,909
Speaker 0: So without further ado, I'm going to play the song that will introduce our final, final contestant here on Rim and Scott's Worst Week.

1061
00:58:56,530 --> 00:59:03,190
Speaker 1: And when with manhood I was blessed, I tasted the temptations of incest.

1062
00:59:04,591 --> 00:59:10,930
Speaker 0: And my uncle, he would binge on alcohol and women.

1063
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:19,470
Speaker 1: And when his life would suddenly halt, this one eye would take the throne.

1064
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,009
Speaker 0: Emperor Caligula.

1065
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:41,650
Speaker 1: There were a lot of Roman emperors that were pretty bad, like Honeiro.

1066
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:42,401
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1067
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:43,250
Speaker 0: Constantine.

1068
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:44,090
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1069
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:46,490
Speaker 1: Oh, we should talk about Constantine though.

1070
00:59:46,972 --> 00:59:47,290
Speaker 1: All right.

1071
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,030
Speaker 1: Let's talk about him first.

1072
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:57,530
Speaker 0: Real briefly, Constantine is pretty much the sole human reason that Christianity exists as it does today, and that the Catholic church ever came into existence.

1073
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,209
Speaker 1: Without Constantine, we'd all be Jews.

1074
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,329
Speaker 0: Well, I wouldn't, but.

1075
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:06,369
Speaker 1: But wait, I'm a Jew anyway, so it doesn't bother me.

1076
01:00:09,671 --> 01:00:13,335
Speaker 0: Actually, without, because you realize back then Constantine, the Jews were persecuted too.

1077
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:14,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, they sure were.

1078
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:28,330
Speaker 0: And even without Constantine, we probably just would not have had, the middle ages would have been a lot different, because the Catholic church kind of filled a power void, and if it had not come about, I don't know what would have happened.

1079
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:29,141
Speaker 1: Me either.

1080
01:00:30,111 --> 01:00:45,769
Speaker 0: And I'm really, it's something I've always wondered about, because every time I look at problems in history, I'm not relating them back to Christianity so much, I'm relating them back to Constantine, and the fact that he created this void of power wherein this church happened to take over.

1081
01:00:46,554 --> 01:00:49,906
Speaker 0: And I don't think it was so much that the church took over, it was that something took over.

1082
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:55,090
Speaker 1: And I could go into great- If he hadn't left the void of power, who would have been in charge, Constantine?

1083
01:00:56,010 --> 01:01:00,470
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know, it wouldn't have been a religious institution, I don't think.

1084
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:01,084
Speaker 1: No.

1085
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:19,690
Speaker 0: Christianity could not have formed as it did, and I don't think there would have been an organization to control the failing pieces of the Roman Empire, and I think possibly the Byzantine Empire, or all the small nations that appeared after the fall of Rome, history might have been a lot different.

1086
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:27,570
Speaker 1: That's like a huge, that's like a choke, you know you play Krononauts, there's linchpins, and you flip one of those over, and a billion other cards flip?

1087
01:01:27,912 --> 01:01:28,628
Speaker 1: That's one of those.

1088
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:29,130
Speaker 0: Yep.

1089
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:41,789
Speaker 0: I mean, it's weird to think that all the things that happen in history, and it always comes down to, there's one little event like dropping the atomic bomb changed history in crazy, unforeseen ways.

1090
01:01:42,352 --> 01:01:47,470
Speaker 0: Emperor Constantine legalizing Christianity changed history in crazy, unforeseen ways.

1091
01:01:48,013 --> 01:01:48,175
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

1092
01:01:49,491 --> 01:01:50,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, Constantine bad.

1093
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:57,879
Speaker 0: But Caligula, not so bad in terms of his policies or what he did, other than a few stupid failed wars.

1094
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:04,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did the same shit that every other Roman Emperor did, march the legions around, fight the barbarians- Yell at the Senate.

1095
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:09,989
Speaker 1: Make Rome pretty lookin', be very lavish, et cetera.

1096
01:02:10,592 --> 01:02:16,830
Speaker 0: Now, if the stories would be to believed, he was probably one of the most depraved, sexually individuals ever.

1097
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:19,069
Speaker 0: He was also possibly a paranoid schizophrenic.

1098
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:21,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, kinda like H.H.

1099
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:21,590
Speaker 1: Holmes.

1100
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:27,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are lots of stories of his horrible, decadent, murderous sexual appetite.

1101
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:35,426
Speaker 1: Like I heard stories he would like, put a robe on, dress up like a homeless bum, sneak out into the street, grab a little boy, et cetera.

1102
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:44,389
Speaker 0: Yep, he supposedly had a cadre of little boys he called his "young minnows" that he would have swim about and nibble on his flesh while he bathed.

1103
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,943
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1104
01:02:48,075 --> 01:02:55,010
Speaker 0: Caligula... Now, there's a lot of evidence that many of the things that were written were hyperbole from his enemies, 'cause he had a lot of enemies.

1105
01:02:55,412 --> 01:02:57,710
Speaker 1: You're gonna have a lot of enemies when you're the Emperor of fuckin' Rome.

1106
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:03,050
Speaker 0: He was assassinated by one of his best friends and his closest, most trusted guard.

1107
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:04,350
Speaker 1: Good.

1108
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:07,090
Speaker 1: It seems like it happens to a lot of Roman emperors.

1109
01:03:07,614 --> 01:03:08,022
Speaker 1: Et tu, Brute?

1110
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:11,290
Speaker 1: Your best friend just kills you because you're being too evil.

1111
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,830
Speaker 0: Et tu, Scotus Ghaul?

1112
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:18,706
Speaker 1: Here, this is what we do, Rym, if any of us is ever too evil at being the Emperor of Podcasting, the other one of us has to...

1113
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:20,030
Speaker 0: The Emperor of Podcasting.

1114
01:03:20,052 --> 01:03:20,310
Speaker 0: Do us in.

1115
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:23,769
Speaker 0: You know what, if Geek Nights ever becomes a linchpin in history...

1116
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:26,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll be sure to kill you first.

1117
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:27,275
Speaker 0: Great.

1118
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:33,269
Speaker 1: Because if I kill you and then I become a Roman emperor, there won't be anyone to kill me, so I'll be all set.

1119
01:03:33,571 --> 01:03:42,510
Speaker 0: See, here's the thing, if we follow the natural conclusion of this out, game theory-wise, we both play games in a very similar way, you know, the whole enlightened self-interest.

1120
01:03:43,511 --> 01:03:52,670
Speaker 0: If we were gonna murder each other, we'd probably be walking down the street, simultaneously whip out knives, thrust them toward each other, the points would meet and stop between the two of us.

1121
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:52,928
Speaker 0: I'd win.

1122
01:03:53,211 --> 01:03:55,030
Speaker 0: I would also have a gun, the bullets would hit in the middle.

1123
01:03:55,111 --> 01:03:55,889
Speaker 1: I'd have a rocket.

1124
01:03:56,951 --> 01:03:58,109
Speaker 0: Yes, you would have a rocket.

1125
01:03:58,431 --> 01:03:58,989
Speaker 1: That's right.

1126
01:04:00,572 --> 01:04:02,489
Speaker 1: Not a rocket-propelled grenade to shoot at you.

1127
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:06,489
Speaker 1: One that would take me up and up and up and you would get killed by the fire coming out of the bottom.

1128
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,450
Speaker 1: And then I would jump off before I went into space.

1129
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:14,970
Speaker 1: Caligula Lucy had one of those.

1130
01:04:15,491 --> 01:04:16,006
Speaker 0: Yes, he did.

1131
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:18,249
Speaker 0: He would strap little boys to it.

1132
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:19,201
Speaker 1: Oh god.

1133
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,426
Speaker 0: Oh god.

1134
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:21,188
Speaker 0: Alright.

1135
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:23,688
Speaker 0: We're done, I think.

1136
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:29,990
Speaker 0: This weekend, we're having almost all of our friends, except Scott Johnson, that's why he's on the list.

1137
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,229
Speaker 0: He's not coming out to the Geek End.

1138
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:32,908
Speaker 0: One of the worst people ever now.

1139
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:33,730
Speaker 1: Definitely.

1140
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:34,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1141
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:36,249
Speaker 0: I mean, he even came out last weekend.

1142
01:04:39,231 --> 01:04:41,790
Speaker 1: You gotta come out last weekend, you gotta come out this weekend.

1143
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:42,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, at Momentum.

1144
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:44,789
Speaker 0: Juggin' on, bitch.

1145
01:04:47,611 --> 01:04:50,970
Speaker 0: We're having a crazy Geek End this weekend, we're probably gonna play some Burning Wheel.

1146
01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:55,884
Speaker 0: If we do end up playing Burning Wheel, I'm gonna try to set up a microphone and record it.

1147
01:04:56,310 --> 01:04:59,729
Speaker 0: So hopefully I can play back some relevant bits as to how awesome Burning Wheel is.

1148
01:05:00,272 --> 01:05:00,508
Speaker 1: Maybe.

1149
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:07,330
Speaker 0: And then of course next weekend, anyone who's in the North Carolina Raleigh area, I'm going to be speaking at Animazement.

1150
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,350
Speaker 1: The weekend after that, we may or may not go to Wizard World Philly.

1151
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:13,125
Speaker 0: Yes.

1152
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,329
Speaker 0: If any of you live near Philly and are thinking of going, let us know.

1153
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:19,189
Speaker 0: The more fans are there, the more likely we are to go.

1154
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,408
Speaker 1: And the weekend after that, I think there's something in the city.

1155
01:05:23,508 --> 01:05:24,544
Speaker 1: maybe you may or not go.

1156
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:29,925
Speaker 0: We've never planned that far ahead, except Otacon, which I bought the hotel room last year.

1157
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:32,229
Speaker 1: It will be at Otacon, see you there.

1158
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:42,170
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1159
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:44,789
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

Speaker 0: Geek Nights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

1165
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,650
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

1166
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:15,530
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
