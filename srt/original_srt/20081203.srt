1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,365
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday December 3rd.

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:12,047
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,555
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,856 --> 00:00:17,858
Speaker 0: We talk a bit about the fantastic ordinary victories.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,914
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:36,372
Speaker 0: so I've been watching the Sequel to know down my cantabile in Paris just kind of follows for the.

7
00:00:36,532 --> 00:00:38,036
Speaker 1: did you finish the first one?

8
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:39,200
Speaker 0: Yes a while ago.

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,407
Speaker 1: Well, that's a lot of watching now.

10
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,654
Speaker 0: It's only a 24 episode show.

11
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:44,678
Speaker 0: I think it's still.

12
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:47,407
Speaker 1: that's a. you know It's a normal-sized show that takes a while.

13
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:48,169
Speaker 0: It takes.

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,694
Speaker 0: I don't know three days on a train.

15
00:00:50,276 --> 00:00:51,500
Speaker 1: How many episodes do you watch?

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,759
Speaker 1: You must just be watch as immediately as one stops you start the next one skip all the openers and closers.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,220
Speaker 0: I skip the openers and closers because honestly normally it's weird especially back in the anime club.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,037
Speaker 0: I used to watch openers a lot more often than I do now, but I've realized that it just.

19
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:08,980
Speaker 0: it depends on the anime.

20
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,747
Speaker 0: I mean slayers DVD problems aside.

21
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:13,377
Speaker 0: I kind of like that opener and I'll watch it.

22
00:01:13,497 --> 00:01:13,940
Speaker 1: It's okay.

23
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,266
Speaker 0: I'll watch it about half the time.

24
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,817
Speaker 1: I think there's something about if you watch the.

25
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,791
Speaker 1: oh at least When you watch a show at you know.

26
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:24,760
Speaker 1: if you watched it in Japan every week It wouldn't really be that much of a difference.

27
00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:41,020
Speaker 1: but there's something about when you watch a show in a marathon or close to a marathon and the opener and the closer play over and over again the songs get in your head and They have some sort of additional impact when they inevitably play the song during the climax of the final episode.

28
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:47,643
Speaker 0: of course Some shows just don't have like the Nodama opener at least isn't Fantastic.

29
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:51,317
Speaker 1: is it a music show an opener and a closer or 90% music?

30
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:52,180
Speaker 1: shouldn't it be awesome?

31
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:58,300
Speaker 0: Oh, the music's good, but it's just kind of some generic cell shaded 3d stuff of instruments floating around.

32
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,513
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not like a all cool and stylized.

33
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:01,834
Speaker 0: No.

34
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:03,260
Speaker 0: It's not all cool and stylized.

35
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:05,600
Speaker 0: It's not that not the good kind of opener.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,618
Speaker 0: But the only thing I have to say about Nodama in Paris is that while it's good, and I'm very much enjoying it I'll probably eventually review this kind of the show as a whole.

37
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:25,015
Speaker 0: but The problem it has is that they moved to Paris and there's all new cast other than the main two and the new cast So far is so lame compared to the original cast.

38
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:34,771
Speaker 1: well see that's something I always wonder like if that new cast had been the first cast you Experienced and then the first show was the sequel would you?

39
00:02:34,791 --> 00:02:37,840
Speaker 1: is it actually a worst cast or is it just because?

40
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,790
Speaker 1: Attached to the first one and this is the second one that it.

41
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:43,520
Speaker 1: you know if you had watched him in reverse order would these?

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,806
Speaker 1: Do the original cast seem worse than the second?

43
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:50,520
Speaker 0: you know it's very difficult while that's probably true in this case at least so far.

44
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,659
Speaker 1: See I'm not saying it's always one of the other.

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,703
Speaker 1: I'm saying that it's.

46
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:57,938
Speaker 1: it's difficult to tell whether it's one of the other but like in this case it definitely just.

47
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,882
Speaker 0: they're not as Interesting.

48
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:06,513
Speaker 0: they're kind of like oh, we've taken characters you had before and mixed them around a little bit But they're not really that interesting or different or new.

49
00:03:06,594 --> 00:03:07,297
Speaker 0: They're just there.

50
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:18,831
Speaker 0: yeah I mean, it's not as bad as the Death Note syndrome where they went from the best Protagonist or I guess antagonist depending on which side you're on and how much of a jerk you are To something kind of lame.

51
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:22,827
Speaker 1: It wasn't lame But it was.

52
00:03:22,847 --> 00:03:35,556
Speaker 1: I mean if I mean imagine if Death Note was just the second half right That would still be better than the vast majority of manga If it had started with the second half characters and then turned into the first half.

53
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:36,760
Speaker 0: I think it would have been better.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,420
Speaker 0: It's kind of like riding the smaller roller coaster before you're at the big roller.

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,564
Speaker 1: I know it's very.

56
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:49,595
Speaker 1: it's very hard to measure these things because it's it's like you want to try to measure them absolutely But it's all like relative.

57
00:03:49,615 --> 00:03:52,364
Speaker 1: It's like you put your hand Wait wait wait Scott.

58
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:58,680
Speaker 0: Are you are you admitting that there is no objective truth as to what media are good and bad?

59
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,264
Speaker 0: No, but we're measuring here.

60
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:00,546
Speaker 0: right?

61
00:04:00,566 --> 00:04:10,240
Speaker 1: is the The differing emotional impact of works of entertainment based on the order in which they are consumed?

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,777
Speaker 0: Okay, and it's very interesting it is yeah, I see how you get backed out of that one.

63
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:16,178
Speaker 1: Well.

64
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:16,620
Speaker 1: I didn't back.

65
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,805
Speaker 0: Anyway, do you have any anime news?

66
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,692
Speaker 1: because I don't know I have.

67
00:04:21,773 --> 00:04:23,620
Speaker 1: I have a very strange comics news.

68
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,717
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what to make of this or I'm not?

69
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:28,409
Speaker 1: you know I'm not fully aware of all the details either right?

70
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:31,460
Speaker 1: so I'm gonna add in a lot of fluff to sort of you know.

71
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,734
Speaker 0: Is it the Batman's dying?

72
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:34,897
Speaker 1: Batman's dead.

73
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:35,899
Speaker 1: why gotta die?

74
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:36,943
Speaker 1: It?

75
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:43,103
Speaker 1: wasn't he dying like way back in the day when he was like an old man with his broken back in a wheelchair and Someone else's Batman?

76
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:51,460
Speaker 0: well the fourth or fifth comment on FARC about this story basically said yeah, that didn't actually happen Don't worry about I think I'm gonna quote.

77
00:04:51,561 --> 00:05:02,425
Speaker 1: I forget who said this but it was one I think someone who was a writer at Marvel and he basically said your job is to Found them at the end.

78
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:05,620
Speaker 1: It's like that's the job as a Marvel or DC writer anyway.

79
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:07,563
Speaker 1: So check this out.

80
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,211
Speaker 1: There's a comics publisher called Devil's due press.

81
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:13,160
Speaker 1: right and I've actually I actually liked them a lot.

82
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,620
Speaker 1: See back in the day and not back in the day.

83
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:26,320
Speaker 1: But like in the early 2000s when I started reading comics again I actually started reading comics again because I saw Ghost in the Shell 2 the issue on the shelf and borders.

84
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:37,836
Speaker 1: but then my friend Ian took me to where the comic book store was at and You know, I started with familiar things, you know things like Voltron or Transformers or Thunder, you know familiar things like that.

85
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:42,659
Speaker 1: and Devil's due Press actually was doing the GI Joe's and the Transformers and things like that.

86
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,757
Speaker 1: They actually did the.

87
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:49,840
Speaker 1: you know I think the Voltron series started out as image but then went to Devil's due Press.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,615
Speaker 1: So I've known about them for a while and they actually did a comic called drafted Remy.

89
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,237
Speaker 1: read that right?

90
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,380
Speaker 1: Ah Maybe yeah, it was the one with the the aliens coming to draft everyone on earth into the space war.

91
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,133
Speaker 0: Oh, I read a little bit of it and I'll be honest.

92
00:06:04,173 --> 00:06:05,018
Speaker 0: I didn't like it at all.

93
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:05,420
Speaker 1: I liked it.

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,148
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's not like the greatest thing ever.

95
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,398
Speaker 1: But I just I thought it was pretty clever.

96
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:09,820
Speaker 0: I don't know.

97
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,330
Speaker 0: I really think the concept was good.

98
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,434
Speaker 0: The characters were mad.

99
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:14,960
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's like some of the.

100
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:22,835
Speaker 1: The first issue is a lot better But when you read like the whole trade It's like that they bring in the rest of the cast and not as sort of like.

101
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:26,593
Speaker 1: the first issue is a lot anyway Right, so they're not a bad comics publisher.

102
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:27,960
Speaker 1: They're doing some cool stuff, right?

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,389
Speaker 1: Now let's go over to our can studio press.

104
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,240
Speaker 1: they're the people that publish mouse guard and a bunch of other stuff.

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,386
Speaker 1: You know all about mouse card.

106
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,200
Speaker 1: No one needs to tell you right but something weird was going on.

107
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:40,181
Speaker 1: All right.

108
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:45,260
Speaker 1: mouse guard was like where the fourth issue of the current series was like missing in action.

109
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,044
Speaker 1: It's like what the hell.

110
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,857
Speaker 1: and then suddenly it appeared this month like aha here it is, right?

111
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,118
Speaker 1: I just got it and it's like why was there this huge delay?

112
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:58,936
Speaker 1: usually You know, David Peterson's really good about and obviously When you know the situation you'll see.

113
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:01,144
Speaker 1: aha What happened here?

114
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:05,698
Speaker 1: right is there was a company called I think Kuni Ochi or Kuno Ichi.

115
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:06,200
Speaker 1: I don't know.

116
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,560
Speaker 1: It's an American company actually not a Japanese company despite the Japanese ish name.

117
00:07:12,004 --> 00:07:13,997
Speaker 1: And actually there was a guy Japanese ish.

118
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:22,972
Speaker 1: Yeah There was a guy who was in charge of devil's dew or a high up there and he left and made the company Kuni Ochi or kunai.

119
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,623
Speaker 1: I don't have it in front of me I don't know what.

120
00:07:24,784 --> 00:07:27,358
Speaker 1: I'll just say kuno ichi for now because I like saying that.

121
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:36,217
Speaker 1: better and Recently there was some shake-ups and some you know money and some other things right and there were rumors going around.

122
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:51,598
Speaker 1: the devil's dew was Gonna buy our can studio press that does mouse guard but actually it was the Kuni Ochi that was trying to buy Arcadia studio press and then like devil's dew and our kids and Kuno Ichi were like sharing offices and they weren't sharing offices and then they like traded CEOs.

123
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:56,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what's the end result of all this?

124
00:07:56,612 --> 00:07:58,720
Speaker 1: well the end result is that mouse guard is back.

125
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:05,100
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the Kuni Ochi company is buying our cast studio press most likely or they did.

126
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,854
Speaker 1: I'm I couldn't get an article that actually said yes, or no.

127
00:08:08,894 --> 00:08:22,713
Speaker 1: I just said you know talks this and that and Some people who were working for very closely related companies moved around and Devil's dew is sort of having some troubles in the money banks.

128
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:36,938
Speaker 1: wise you know the GI Joe comics Got the license got moved over to IDW and they're trying to come up with their own properties instead of you know Where they've traditionally relied on licensed properties, so they might they might you know be gone pretty soon.

129
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:45,767
Speaker 1: But the Kuni Ochi company owns our kids studio press and mouse guard so I don't think that's in any danger Especially considering its high qualities.

130
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:48,657
Speaker 1: You know they'll always find a home for mouse guard.

131
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,460
Speaker 1: there won't be a problem.

132
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,335
Speaker 0: Yes, I would hope because my only vested interest in this is reading the rest of mouse guard.

133
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,137
Speaker 1: Yeah pretty much.

134
00:08:55,157 --> 00:09:05,097
Speaker 1: Yeah Man, it's just sort of like these interesting shake-ups that happen at like these little comic companies And it's like huh did you wonder like what the drama behind this was?

135
00:09:05,137 --> 00:09:05,298
Speaker 1: well?

136
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:10,500
Speaker 0: It's still Nothing compared to the shake-ups and drama in the anime industry.

137
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're even like the.

138
00:09:12,347 --> 00:09:15,800
Speaker 1: the backpack company goes under and it's like what happened an anime cup.

139
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,949
Speaker 0: They never go under like a normal company.

140
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:18,612
Speaker 0: It's never like up.

141
00:09:18,712 --> 00:09:18,993
Speaker 0: Well.

142
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:19,877
Speaker 0: We're going bankrupt.

143
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:20,600
Speaker 0: Yes, it's fly.

144
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,080
Speaker 0: It's always like they disappear, and there's like a cryptic message on the website.

145
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:31,043
Speaker 0: And then some like if you get the cryptic message some kind of form is like I used to work there the CEO Exploded.

146
00:09:31,244 --> 00:09:35,619
Speaker 1: yeah, at least with this there's like news articles on comic book websites, so it's one step up.

147
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:44,779
Speaker 0: so There's a new anime that I I saw the title a couple times But I didn't realize what it was until the second teaser trailer was announced.

148
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,054
Speaker 0: Isakai no say Kishi Monogatari now.

149
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:49,717
Speaker 1: It's a lot of words.

150
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:56,644
Speaker 1: I hear in Yeah, well Sorry means like side story.

151
00:09:56,705 --> 00:09:57,607
Speaker 0: right you know what this is.

152
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:59,892
Speaker 0: it is a spin-off of something.

153
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:04,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it is a spin-off of Tenshi muyo up.

154
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:05,500
Speaker 0: great why?

155
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:17,636
Speaker 1: We've only had like two or three of those already, and they were terrible I know, but it even I don't even like the regular Tenshi But I at least I know the Tenshi GXP is a thousand times worse than that even.

156
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:18,700
Speaker 0: well well the thing is well.

157
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,868
Speaker 0: Tenshi GXP was was far worse a sin than it could would have otherwise been because of the fact that it had Such a great opening song.

158
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,212
Speaker 1: it did a really great.

159
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:28,437
Speaker 1: Oh, we should put that in the episode.

160
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:30,782
Speaker 0: song was wasted MP3.

161
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:35,815
Speaker 1: we should put that in the episode so people can hear the amazing opener of Tenshi GXP.

162
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,643
Speaker 0: best opening song worst anime Oh my god.

163
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:40,831
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the noir syndrome.

164
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:43,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, that had a really good opening song.

165
00:10:45,243 --> 00:10:48,738
Speaker 0: Well it was no K anime that went downhill a lot better than Tenshi GXP.

166
00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:49,260
Speaker 0: yes.

167
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:53,300
Speaker 0: However, I point out that Tenshi GXP started low and didn't have anywhere to go from.

168
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:59,238
Speaker 0: Noir started real high and took exactly one episode to ruin everything.

169
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:02,908
Speaker 0: yeah The popcorn was like the last cool moment wasn't that?

170
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:03,750
Speaker 0: like an episode two.

171
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,923
Speaker 0: I don't remember anyway, so yes They're making.

172
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:08,947
Speaker 0: here's the deal.

173
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,154
Speaker 0: no Tenshi characters are even in.

174
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,705
Speaker 0: this doesn't look like it's in an altar So it's Photon.

175
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:15,314
Speaker 0: It's even worse than that.

176
00:11:15,696 --> 00:11:19,217
Speaker 0: Tenshi Masaki is not the main character.

177
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:25,919
Speaker 0: instead Kenshi Masaki his half brother hitherto unknown is the main character.

178
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:29,455
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but it does nothing to do with the characters that people care about.

179
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:30,601
Speaker 0: no and furthermore I.

180
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:35,640
Speaker 1: so this is like if I made a transformers right and it doesn't have optimus dime.

181
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,205
Speaker 1: it's about Rob to miss dime and Degetre on.

182
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:41,873
Speaker 0: hey it could be hiding.

183
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:43,180
Speaker 0: There's a small chance.

184
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,919
Speaker 0: It could be optimus rhyme in which case it would be awesome, but that's not that that's a real thing.

185
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,309
Speaker 1: yes This is a made-up thing.

186
00:11:49,934 --> 00:12:11,819
Speaker 0: the big difference I've always said it seems like with Tenshi in particular because remember the original tenshi Oh av was directed by person a. I forget all their names at this point I've stricken the second guy from my memory, but then The other dude directed all the other tenshi stuff, and it's like all he's been trying to do is Recapture that he even directed tenshi GXP and this new thing.

187
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:12,623
Speaker 0: I don't.

188
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,194
Speaker 0: I don't know who's directing this new thing in the tenchi in Tokyo.

189
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:17,869
Speaker 0: Oh my god Tenshi in Tokyo was.

190
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,300
Speaker 1: I remember I would watch tsunami But I never watched tenshi because I hated it.

191
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,020
Speaker 1: But I would always see the commercials like during Robotech like tenshi in Tokyo next week OMG.

192
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,525
Speaker 1: And I'd be like whatever see.

193
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:31,620
Speaker 1: I remember a more innocent time where and then multi would show me some robot X.

194
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:32,324
Speaker 0: I'm all tar.

195
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,054
Speaker 0: I miss him Horatio.

196
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:37,086
Speaker 1: I knew him But that's like you've had a space.

197
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:40,640
Speaker 1: go show about dull car and race dose.

198
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,606
Speaker 0: I like the tenshi OAV joke ran out.

199
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:51,893
Speaker 0: there were a lot of people really really looking forward to a tenshi in Tokyo because it's a new tenshi and It took about 30 seconds for everyone to stop pretending.

200
00:12:51,913 --> 00:12:53,640
Speaker 0: It was good and admit that it was bad.

201
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,668
Speaker 0: But I've one more a little bit of news.

202
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:59,919
Speaker 0: this one is much more interesting and about something good for a change.

203
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:02,640
Speaker 1: Another news, what are you doing Murakami?

204
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,740
Speaker 0: Yeah is opening a new studio all right in LA.

205
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,374
Speaker 0: Uh-huh he's gonna have two floors and 30 employees.

206
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:12,077
Speaker 1: He's got the money.

207
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:15,710
Speaker 0: Yes I'm excited to see what comes of this.

208
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,084
Speaker 1: I'm sure it would be lots of Super flat things.

209
00:13:21,205 --> 00:13:24,353
Speaker 0: see maybe he'll move one step further some sort of ultra flat.

210
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,900
Speaker 1: yeah, double double double plus.

211
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,100
Speaker 1: I don't think we've yet to maybe help.

212
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,872
Speaker 1: Maybe he'll start doing things that are the opposite of flat.

213
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:44,693
Speaker 0: the closest thing to a definition of super flat I've ever heard is something made by Murakami something that looks like Murakami stuff Yes, and even then looks like his super flight stuff.

214
00:13:44,914 --> 00:13:47,708
Speaker 0: Yes a jet engine technology situation.

215
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,419
Speaker 1: oh great.

216
00:13:55,091 --> 00:14:01,310
Speaker 0: So things of the day of anime news network is what it is, but an anime news Nina is awesome.

217
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,920
Speaker 1: But oh I gotta read some anime news Nina, but I miss them.

218
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:06,430
Speaker 0: you did, but they have done something.

219
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,243
Speaker 0: I don't remember if we talked about it or not, but it's over now.

220
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,650
Speaker 0: so instead of saying hey You should enter this I can say hey check out the winners.

221
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:22,068
Speaker 0: They had a contest to depict Hatsune Miku in whatever way you thought best And the five best would receive a really cool figurine of Hatsune Miku.

222
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:27,755
Speaker 0: And now they have posted all of the entries and the winners and the winners are really really good Isn't that something?

223
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:29,490
Speaker 1: where it's like this is the anime news network.

224
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,002
Speaker 1: It's a site that's supposed to report on news about anime.

225
00:14:32,485 --> 00:14:36,770
Speaker 1: Hatsune Miku Really if you think about it has nothing to do with anime.

226
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:44,855
Speaker 0: I point out that she is in fact the closest link between anime in the real world We've got because she is the first step.

227
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:46,499
Speaker 0: She is Macross Plus.

228
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,487
Speaker 1: Hatsune Miku is a cartoon mascot.

229
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:50,129
Speaker 1: Am I wrong?

230
00:14:50,530 --> 00:15:07,225
Speaker 1: No anime news network reporting on Hatsune Miku is effectively the same as if say a magazine about American television cartoons reported on the Philadelphia fanatic, you know, it's a mascot of something a cartoon mascot.

231
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,650
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

232
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,520
Speaker 0: There's a little bit more to it than that.

233
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,149
Speaker 1: It happens to be Japanese.

234
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:16,530
Speaker 0: It's really well, there's a big overlap.

235
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,313
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

236
00:15:17,474 --> 00:15:21,030
Speaker 0: anime fandom has a huge overlap with Hatsune Miku fandom.

237
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:22,035
Speaker 1: so why?

238
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,342
Speaker 1: yeah, but that's the it's.

239
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:30,766
Speaker 1: it's so strange how like Mascots can have this overlap with this one fandom, but in the same fandom in other countries.

240
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:31,910
Speaker 1: the overlap doesn't happen.

241
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,295
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on what I mean.

242
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:46,274
Speaker 0: the Philly fanatic has very little to do with many geekeries other than sports geekery but Hatsune Miku has to do with lots of different kind of geeky fandoms because the you know people draw on the little toms and getting into the kind of Open creative content.

243
00:15:46,314 --> 00:15:47,638
Speaker 0: everyone has their own take on her.

244
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:50,627
Speaker 1: I will say though if you I see lots of mr.

245
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:53,074
Speaker 1: Metz around Mr.

246
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:53,820
Speaker 0: Metz fan art.

247
00:15:54,002 --> 00:16:03,753
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm going to use a phrase incorrectly, but this begs the question Begs what question?

248
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,083
Speaker 0: um I'm sure there are erotic work.

249
00:16:07,264 --> 00:16:08,487
Speaker 1: I haven't seen any erotic mr.

250
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:08,608
Speaker 1: Metz.

251
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,796
Speaker 1: No, I have not perhaps.

252
00:16:11,816 --> 00:16:18,335
Speaker 0: We should seek some out for I'm sure I am sure that it is out there even though even a non Erotic mr..

253
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,409
Speaker 1: Metz has many exposed bats and balls.

254
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:29,206
Speaker 0: Anyway Scott I want you to feast your eyes over my shoulder on this stunning entry into the contest.

255
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:30,490
Speaker 1: That's mine.

256
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:32,909
Speaker 0: What are you doing?

257
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:41,229
Speaker 0: Let's just say that the quality of the entries ranges from the absurd to the good And I'll leave it at that.

258
00:16:41,812 --> 00:16:44,421
Speaker 0: I will say I'm a fan of Hatsune Miku so long as she does not.

259
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:51,683
Speaker 0: I also like Hatsune Miku so long as she does Not take over a giant space station and control our society through idol music.

260
00:16:51,703 --> 00:16:52,625
Speaker 1: I also like mr.

261
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:56,549
Speaker 1: Metz, but I don't actually like He sucks.

262
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:02,609
Speaker 1: Did you know the Philly fanatic was created by the same person who made Miss Piggy?

263
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:04,560
Speaker 0: No, I did not know that.

264
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,042
Speaker 1: I know that.

265
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:05,849
Speaker 1: see how smart I am.

266
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:06,654
Speaker 0: How did you know that?

267
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:07,740
Speaker 1: because I've read the Internet's.

268
00:17:08,303 --> 00:17:09,490
Speaker 0: so what you look this up one day?

269
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,200
Speaker 1: No, I saw it was posted some day.

270
00:17:11,623 --> 00:17:17,946
Speaker 1: Okay, all right For me this is a. this is a Nokia commercial, so just beware of that.

271
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:23,930
Speaker 1: however Basically they took an old video and appropriated it as a commercial and the old video is is good.

272
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,829
Speaker 1: It's like if I took I don't know all your base, and then at the end of the video I just put like geek nights.

273
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:39,270
Speaker 1: That's basically what's going on here and the video that they have decided to put Nokia at the end of the Nokia logo at the end of is a video of Bruce Lee playing ping-pong with nunchucks.

274
00:17:40,152 --> 00:17:41,336
Speaker 0: Oh, I've seen that thing.

275
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:42,519
Speaker 0: that that's pretty cool.

276
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,883
Speaker 1: That's all you need to know.

277
00:17:43,923 --> 00:17:48,233
Speaker 1: if you haven't seen enough Bruce Lee's I mean Just watch it.

278
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:49,175
Speaker 0: Okay.

279
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:54,930
Speaker 0: I can at least tell you that I cannot find any erotic fanfiction or fan art about mr.

00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:10,710
Speaker 1: I don't know about other mascots, but I'm a hundred percent.

288
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,289

Speaker 1: Matt to the wedding and you can go and you can find this video of mr.

294
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,541
Speaker 1: Matt like having the best time in the universe at this wedding.

295
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:33,550
Speaker 1: It's like it's like the greatest thing ever.

296
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,869
Speaker 1: So if I you know if I married some Mets fan someday, I would consider calling mr.

297
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,887
Speaker 1: Matt because you know there's like a bunch of different people in the costume.

298
00:18:42,008 --> 00:18:44,659
Speaker 1: obviously You know this is not the same person all the time.

299
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:45,743
Speaker 0: It would be cheaper Scott.

300
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:47,549
Speaker 0: Just get a bootleg mr.

301
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,544
Speaker 0: Matt costume.

302
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:54,689
Speaker 1: no The real the this because you you're not waiting for the costume you're paying for the at the best mr.

303
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,040
Speaker 1: Matt person.

304
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,089
Speaker 0: so you want the real mr.

305
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:57,450
Speaker 0: Matt.

306
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,579
Speaker 1: yeah, it's like not just anyone in the costume would like you know.

307
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:08,463
Speaker 0: act that way at the wedding because it's so difficult to kind Of caper around with a giant baseball on your head to keep her around properly.

308
00:19:08,483 --> 00:19:09,627
Speaker 1: It's very difficult.

309
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:10,570
Speaker 0: So there's an art to it.

310
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:17,270
Speaker 1: There's that there's a certain to say qua So if you're saying if I put you in the Philly fanatic costume you could do just as good a job.

311
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:19,156
Speaker 0: You know what I think I can.

312
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:20,039
Speaker 1: you think you can?

313
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:20,922
Speaker 0: I think I can.

314
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:22,167
Speaker 1: you definitely could not.

315
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,170
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand.

316
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,383
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't think you understand how much skill is required for the proper case.

317
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:29,262
Speaker 0: You understand just how much study I have put into capering.

318
00:19:29,565 --> 00:19:32,180
Speaker 1: Oh Saying you're an expert mascot.

319
00:19:32,883 --> 00:19:34,410
Speaker 0: I think that I could mask out pretty well.

320
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:38,267
Speaker 1: I think you're a terrible mascot and don't even know the first thing about mascot.

321
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:38,850
Speaker 0: I know the baby.

322
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,810
Speaker 1: I don't think you can even deal with the heat of the costume for more than one minute.

323
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,163
Speaker 0: I don't think you could dance to the baby elephant walk.

324
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:47,937
Speaker 1: I could dance the baby elephant Yeah, but not in the giant costume.

325
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:48,921
Speaker 0: I think I could.

326
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,970
Speaker 0: good luck with that plus the man who can't even do a push.

327
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,184
Speaker 1: You can even giant you can even balance the baseball on your head.

328
00:19:56,204 --> 00:19:57,910
Speaker 1: It would fall off your tiny neck.

329
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,157
Speaker 0: Do we need to call mr.

330
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:01,089
Speaker 0: Matt here and have him?

331
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,334
Speaker 1: You know that might not.

332
00:20:03,475 --> 00:20:03,776
Speaker 1: mr.

333
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:04,500
Speaker 1: Matt doesn't talk.

334
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,430
Speaker 1: You really wouldn't help in deciding anything.

335
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,403
Speaker 0: I see this is where you do not understand the art of being mr.

336
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:19,770
Speaker 0: Matt because the artistry The Qualities come from the fact that he can convey so much meaning with no word.

337
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:20,190
Speaker 1: You know what?

338
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,204
Speaker 1: He would say is he would just say anything.

339
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:22,848
Speaker 1: that needs to be.

340
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:23,050
Speaker 1: you know.

341
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,026
Speaker 1: Any argument any disputes ever should be decided with baseball and that is you know, it's pretty much all mr.

342
00:20:28,066 --> 00:20:28,568
Speaker 1: Matt can say.

343
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:31,830
Speaker 0: well Were we to decide this by baseball?

344
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:38,497
Speaker 1: I think I would still win now because we we need eight peoples and I would just to be me and eight mr Matt's and you would be you and eight.

345
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:39,984
Speaker 0: so you're assuming that mr.

346
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:41,270
Speaker 0: Matt can play baseball.

347
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,855
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

348
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,018
Speaker 1: He's made of baseball.

349
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,927
Speaker 0: being made of something does not mean you're good at it.

350
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:47,629
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.

351
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:52,135
Speaker 0: Anyway How could it not?

352
00:20:52,456 --> 00:20:53,943
Speaker 0: so what are we reviewing tonight?

353
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,490
Speaker 1: He lives in the stadium?

354
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,072
Speaker 1: I think he's.

355
00:20:56,112 --> 00:20:57,700
Speaker 1: he knows enough to win.

356
00:20:57,721 --> 00:21:01,277
Speaker 0: I still can't find any erotic fan art So let's just move on 34.

357
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:04,554
Speaker 0: Oh My god, I'll have for channel.

358
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:04,835
Speaker 0: do it.

359
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,319
Speaker 0: All right, or Chen already did.

360
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:09,630
Speaker 0: ordinary victories by Manolo larcenette.

361
00:21:10,212 --> 00:21:11,055
Speaker 1: Pronounce it properly.

362
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:11,798
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

363
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:12,481
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

364
00:21:12,782 --> 00:21:14,810
Speaker 1: It's a French dude with the French comic.

365
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:23,750
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure this is just volume one and there are further volumes, but I believe he's French Belgian But either they are not in English or I do not own them.

366
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,766
Speaker 0: Yes, in fact, he is French Belgian and the second volume in English is available on Amazon right now.

367
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,156
Speaker 0: No buy it Okay.

368
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:32,249
Speaker 0: All right.

369
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,470
Speaker 1: So now I think that tells me everything you need to know about this.

370
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,361
Speaker 1: It is a French comic that is good enough to.

371
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,958
Speaker 1: where someone will buy the second volume French Belgian.

372
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,933
Speaker 1: oh Excuse me.

373
00:21:44,314 --> 00:21:47,665
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe I should say it's not a French comic or a Franco Belgian comic.

374
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:52,143
Speaker 1: It's a bond a design a Manga and anger everyone.

375
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:52,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

376
00:21:52,768 --> 00:22:04,904
Speaker 0: All right all right, so before I did realize something though because not that long ago Emily and I kind of perused through the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles OAV Mm-hmm, that might seem unrelated.

377
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:05,709
Speaker 1: Why did you do that?

378
00:22:06,172 --> 00:22:16,450
Speaker 0: That might seem unrelated but I also read this comic and I realized something important about reviewing things because currently the way we review shows or Comics or any sort of media here on geek nights?

379
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:24,890
Speaker 0: Is that if it's something bad will basically say it's bad and why it's bad and spoil it But not fully because you know, we've kind of avoid spoiling things.

380
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:32,897
Speaker 1: We're reviewing things to get people to try them out or avoid and it seems to work because there's a lot of people tell us You know, oh you told me to read watchman.

381
00:22:32,937 --> 00:22:33,519
Speaker 1: I bought it.

382
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:34,503
Speaker 1: You're right.

383
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:36,170
Speaker 1: You know, you told me to watch cowboy bebop.

384
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:44,730
Speaker 0: You're right and when something's good We tend to do a kind of pre like a review where we don't spoil anything because we're not trying to all we talk about it.

385
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,466
Speaker 1: We're trying to just try to make you excited about it enough to buy it.

386
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,554
Speaker 1: because yes No, it is in your best interest to do so.

387
00:22:51,574 --> 00:23:09,693
Speaker 0: the problem here is that that necessitates if we want to talk about something in any real depth to either have a spoiler line which no one wants or do more Final thought style episodes which while they're fun to do now They're on this half schedule doing any number of those at a time really kind of eats into talking about new stuff in a big Way.

388
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:16,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should see the pile of Unconsumed media in my room, but Dave and Joel made me realize that there's one kind of review.

389
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:26,930
Speaker 0: We don't do Mm-hmm the review where something is bad and the best enjoyment to be gotten from it is Someone else reviewing it to the point of spoiling it entirely.

390
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:32,090
Speaker 0: But you one do not have to watch it and two can live humorously and vicariously through them.

391
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,090
Speaker 1: But that is the job of Dave and Joel and not the job of ribbon skirt.

392
00:23:35,311 --> 00:23:38,886
Speaker 0: However, I know that none of these people have done the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles OAV.

393
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,333
Speaker 1: They did have an old order Did they?

394
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:41,319
Speaker 1: that's how I found out about.

395
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,074
Speaker 0: Oh when they do it when you aren't listening I haven't listened.

396
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:46,166
Speaker 1: How do you think I found out about that crazy stupid thing?

397
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:50,461
Speaker 0: I'll be honest I have not listened to any podcast outside of it's all politics.

398
00:23:50,561 --> 00:23:51,283
Speaker 1: I also stop.

399
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:53,530
Speaker 1: I stop listening to the vast majority of podcast.

400
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,723
Speaker 0: I listened to the penny arcade and politics and that's it.

401
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:02,485
Speaker 1: I listen to penny arcade twit One ESPN show and I got the onion video.

402
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,169
Speaker 1: That's about it.

403
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess pseudopod, but I don't know.

404
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:09,630
Speaker 1: I kind of wore out a horn even when I was trying listen trying to listen to pseudopod.

405
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,329
Speaker 1: I couldn't listen to enough even though I loved it.

406
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,430
Speaker 0: I listen to every one but then I just I guess I got burned out on horror.

407
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,527
Speaker 0: I've heard so many horror stories that like they don't even.

408
00:24:17,547 --> 00:24:18,673
Speaker 1: yeah I'm not scared.

409
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,410
Speaker 1: the only one that ever like got me even a little bit of a hospital one.

410
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,735
Speaker 1: Yeah with the MRI.

411
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:24,096
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:24,779
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,481
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:29,960
Speaker 0: Anyway, but anyway, I don't know I kind of want to do a review like that about something.

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,930
Speaker 1: Well, not about this because this doesn't suck.

416
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,759
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't ordinary victories.

417
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:37,639
Speaker 0: If you don't listen any further from this point Can you find the add the original name of it?

418
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,750
Speaker 1: Cuz that's that's sort of the translated name.

419
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:39,971
Speaker 1: That's.

420
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:46,432
Speaker 0: and as I flounder to remember the name Emily actually hands the book to me open to the page where it says that it Was.

421
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:48,048
Speaker 0: I wasn't actually looking at the book.

422
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,515
Speaker 0: Realize it'll be in the book.

423
00:24:50,776 --> 00:24:53,327
Speaker 0: and then I looked at the book and I'm looking at all these other things.

424
00:24:53,588 --> 00:25:00,456
Speaker 0: it is combat ordinary aha, which translates to Ordinary combat.

425
00:25:00,657 --> 00:25:02,670
Speaker 1: Yeah as opposed to ordinary victories.

426
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:08,645
Speaker 1: It's like a different meaning there, but I think they didn't want to call it ordinary combat because that would sound you know That would be like, huh?

427
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,650
Speaker 1: But anyway, I don't know.

428
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:24,841
Speaker 0: I feel like they should have just left it in the original language because anyone who speaks English Will understand what combat ordinary means but it won't carry the kind of I don't know the the weird Baggage of the English language if it said ordinary combat.

429
00:25:24,881 --> 00:25:31,343
Speaker 1: This is something for our friend the the Oda King and his Dynamic equivalent school to figure out.

430
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:32,550
Speaker 0: we should ask him.

431
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,599
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is I don't know if he's a French expert.

432
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,914
Speaker 0: though before we go any further if you don't listen any further This is fantastic.

433
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:38,517
Speaker 0: You should read it.

434
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:40,565
Speaker 0: Don't even worry about what it's about.

435
00:25:40,585 --> 00:25:41,670
Speaker 0: Just buy it and read it.

436
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,388
Speaker 0: It's really really really good.

437
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:47,810
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean really what got me about this comic, right?

438
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,622
Speaker 1: well, let me do a little like a really short summary of the plot.

439
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:55,117
Speaker 1: right you have this guy and He is I guess he's.

440
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,084
Speaker 1: they're Italian or French or something.

441
00:25:57,104 --> 00:25:58,047
Speaker 1: I can't I can't really tell.

442
00:25:58,067 --> 00:26:00,198
Speaker 0: he's into Photography.

443
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,816
Speaker 1: He's a photographer Journalistic photographer.

444
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,449
Speaker 1: right takes pictures of all sorts of horrible things, you know, like starving kids and whatnot.

445
00:26:07,752 --> 00:26:19,490
Speaker 1: but he has a lot of psychological problems for various reasons and Basically, he's at a time in his life where things are changing up, you know, he decides to stop seeing the psychology people.

446
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:23,042
Speaker 0: You know, he's well, that's actually the the books.

447
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:25,390
Speaker 0: Well, the comic starts out really strong.

448
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,750
Speaker 0: He's laying in the chair and it pretty it comes in kind of in media res.

449
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:33,844
Speaker 0: So that's why I've decided to stop my therapy and the the therapist.

450
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:34,746
Speaker 0: I love the way he's drawn.

451
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:36,070
Speaker 0: just kind of looks there.

452
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,320
Speaker 1: It looks like a little Durky Freud kind of guys.

453
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he just doesn't react and the guy gets nervous.

454
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,121
Speaker 0: He's like, uh, so that's it.

455
00:26:43,543 --> 00:26:48,587
Speaker 0: And then the therapist says, all right Well, I'll set your appointment for next month and it really throws him off guard.

456
00:26:48,627 --> 00:26:58,329
Speaker 0: and just the way Yeah the way that's put together in this first page will hook you right away into this comment because the whole thing is Clever and well-written and realistic and engaging just like that.

457
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:12,518
Speaker 1: yep, you know and the guy goes through some tough times in his life where things are changing up and Over the course of that, you know, it's like all these these issues that you know affect you know, pretty much everyone sort of come into play.

458
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:46,825
Speaker 1: and what really got me is how many of the issues are things which we Talk about or think about frequently such as you know Things like Mike Tyson syndrome where you have like this horrible human being who has like incredible talents or Mike You know, Michael Jackson's the same way Or the exact opposite where you have these like really great people who are in so talented Really or in fact, you know, they're really friendly and great and you you love being with them But they're actually horrible people and it's like, you know what how are you supposed to you know deal with these people in your everyday life?

459
00:27:46,885 --> 00:27:48,029
Speaker 1: and what are you supposed to think?

460
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:50,313
Speaker 1: and It's it's good.

461
00:27:50,373 --> 00:27:50,854
Speaker 1: They don't.

462
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:55,427
Speaker 1: whether they answer it or whether the answer is satisfactory is is up to you.

463
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:58,170
Speaker 0: I Just the art is real.

464
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:09,986
Speaker 0: I mean one thing about the main character and you'll find out right away that part of the reason he's going to therapy is That he succumbs to panic attacks and he's I mean he's going to therapy for many years I think it says eight years and he still hasn't really gotten over it.

465
00:28:10,026 --> 00:28:10,930
Speaker 0: In fact, it's gotten worse.

466
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:25,206
Speaker 0: He doesn't understand what it is that triggers him and this that more than anything really kind of throws him off balance despite the fact that all these kind of Ordinary battles like the battles that people fight in their daily lives are also confronting him.

467
00:28:25,226 --> 00:28:27,353
Speaker 0: and then beyond all that He's also got this.

468
00:28:27,413 --> 00:28:32,270
Speaker 0: but I guess artistically I really like the way they portray those those episodes.

469
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,307
Speaker 0: He has the art style will change and the panels get red and his eyes are really sketchy and it.

470
00:28:37,528 --> 00:28:39,315
Speaker 0: you'll have to look at The comic to see what I mean.

471
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:40,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really.

472
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,826
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, it's sort of the.

473
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:50,805
Speaker 1: it's an art style I see in a lot of you know French and Belgian comics, you know little sort of slightly sketchy squiggly characters, right?

474
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,630
Speaker 1: But it totally works.

475
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,402
Speaker 1: I mean you can you recognize every character perfectly every time.

476
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,930
Speaker 1: you never have that issue of is this that guy or is this another?

477
00:28:59,672 --> 00:29:06,270
Speaker 1: You see a person you know who they are, you know and just it really, you know gets across exactly what it's trying to say.

478
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,992
Speaker 1: The paneling isn't crazy experimental or anything like that but it.

479
00:29:10,514 --> 00:29:15,488
Speaker 1: it definitely works in controlling the pace properly and You know, it's I really I mean.

480
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:24,561
Speaker 1: But isn't it say on the cover that it like won something like one of the best something ever one of the five best Graphic novels of all time as picked by time.

481
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:26,187
Speaker 1: Yeah how time magazine?

482
00:29:26,388 --> 00:29:26,689
Speaker 0: Yes.

483
00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:33,670
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't know if it's one of the five best graphic novels of all time, but it's maybe one of the best 20.

484
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,184
Speaker 0: I would definitely put it on the must-have.

485
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:37,210
Speaker 0: must must read lists.

486
00:29:37,531 --> 00:29:44,682
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're someone who appreciates comics of all shapes and sizes This is a comic you really can't not have.

487
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:48,708
Speaker 0: I mean the only warning I really have about it Is that don't go into it?

488
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:58,009
Speaker 0: I mean, it's light-hearted at times and it's realistic in his portrayal of just about everything that it addresses But it is not the most non depressing works to put it like.

489
00:29:59,111 --> 00:30:01,962
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean we've already talked summarized the plot a little bit.

490
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,010
Speaker 1: It's obviously going to be depressing.

491
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,213
Speaker 1: This is not going to be like happy times at the sunshine Part one.

492
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:12,025
Speaker 0: I mean it's broken up into parts and it does have a lot of humor though.

493
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:16,997
Speaker 0: There's plenty of jokes going around And hangs out with his friend and they call each other.

494
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:18,020
Speaker 1: This is brother.

495
00:30:18,261 --> 00:30:21,070
Speaker 0: It really portrays those kinds of relationships.

496
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,790
Speaker 0: Well, they George George and you know all the kind of weird things friends do where they call each other something funny.

497
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,289
Speaker 0: here They have like these the rituals that they engage in when they meet each other.

498
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:31,192
Speaker 0: They.

499
00:30:31,212 --> 00:30:35,504
Speaker 0: basically it's kind of like we do things like that where you yell some kind of catchphrase.

500
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,430
Speaker 0: only there's this big fat joints.

501
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:49,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one thing that's that really a lot of comics mess up, you know Even great ones is that the dialogue between people is either like melodramatic or corny or not, you know realistic.

502
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:57,510
Speaker 1: But the dialogue between the people in this comic is exact is exactly like, you know, dialogue of real people.

503
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:04,534
Speaker 1: I mean even something like Scott Pilgrim where the dialogue is sort of like Like.

504
00:31:04,574 --> 00:31:05,960
Speaker 1: yeah, it's it's it's or it's.

505
00:31:06,402 --> 00:31:13,658
Speaker 1: it's like real dialogue But it's sort of like I don't know micro or macro In Scott Pilgrim particular.

506
00:31:13,678 --> 00:31:17,210
Speaker 0: I think the dialogue is it very much evokes what?

507
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:22,390
Speaker 0: People like that or people who are into like our culture the way we talk to each other.

508
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:22,932
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

509
00:31:23,033 --> 00:31:24,398
Speaker 1: it's like it takes like Scott.

510
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:27,370
Speaker 0: No one actually talks like you know, except possibly Conrad.

511
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,338
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they take like the real diet.

512
00:31:29,358 --> 00:31:38,039
Speaker 1: They take real dialogue, but it's exaggerated right in a way You know, they take certain aspects of it in hand and you know Bring them out and take the normal talk and sort of push it down.

513
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,390
Speaker 1: But this this just has actual real dialogue.

514
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:41,775
Speaker 1: It's like.

515
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:49,929
Speaker 1: that's how people talk That's what they say, which is pretty amazing considering it's a translation from the French, you know And it still comes across that way.

516
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,256
Speaker 1: That's that's a real good translation job right there.

517
00:31:52,276 --> 00:31:59,074
Speaker 0: and also the dialogue not just natural but the characters and the way they interact is just Incredibly realistic.

518
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:05,610
Speaker 0: and I I often am caught off guard by characters just by the way they react to things because they're there.

519
00:32:05,811 --> 00:32:10,190
Speaker 0: They're very fleshed out which is something that really I guess adds a lot to this comic.

520
00:32:10,692 --> 00:32:15,230
Speaker 0: I mean that hit one of the issues that his father isn't doing so well, he's having trouble with memory.

521
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,190
Speaker 0: They're hinting that he might have Alzheimer's and they go through this as time goes on.

522
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:27,910
Speaker 0: but when he meets his dad near the beginning of the comic that the dad kind of points off to a freighter in the distance and Remarks that apparently they go by every day.

523
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,698
Speaker 0: But yet every day he forgets that they're there that they'll come and he's always amazed when he sees them and the son doesn't really Know how to react and he's kind of nervous.

524
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,930
Speaker 0: and they have this kind of halting conversation.

525
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:43,610
Speaker 0: And then the dad start gets really feeble suddenly and repeats himself you see that freighter yonder.

526
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:48,890
Speaker 0: Well, your mom tells me and the guy really freaks out at this point and then the dad just starts laughing.

527
00:32:49,131 --> 00:32:50,379
Speaker 0: Hey, I can still crack a joke.

528
00:32:50,781 --> 00:32:52,806
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good It was a good

529
00:32:52,827 --> 00:33:13,870
Speaker 0: scene But at the same time then there's a lot of atmosphere because the last panel on that page you'll get a lot of panels like This where it'll show two characters talking or kind of be focused on what's going on for a while But then the last panel on a page will often cut away to something else like something in the background or something Something that isn't really pertinent to the scene directly, but was part of the atmosphere.

530
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:20,714
Speaker 1: Yeah It's the same thing a lot of anime do where like in between scenes will give you like the five seconds of the sky and then Like three seconds of the tree

531
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:26,450
Speaker 0: except for the the old boring sci-fi space anime where you'll get the four minutes of the empty space.

532
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:28,290
Speaker 1: It's so great.

533
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:28,735
Speaker 1: but

534
00:33:28,998 --> 00:33:44,770
Speaker 0: what I like is that Most of the time when they it'll end on one of those panels and then you'll see that same thing in a much more important light later like a Chapter or something will end on almost the same scene to kind of bring you back to the moment that led to this.

535
00:33:45,252 --> 00:33:52,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also kind of weird how everything in this comic, you know, there's nothing Supernatural or magical going on.

536
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,621
Speaker 1: There's no superpowers.

537
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:54,865
Speaker 1: There's no magic spells.

538
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:55,747
Speaker 1: No curses.

539
00:33:55,848 --> 00:33:56,550
Speaker 1: No nothing, right?

540
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,844
Speaker 1: It's it's totally just story of people in the real world.

541
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:06,130
Speaker 1: That's it, but Even so there's almost there's sort of like a magical quality in around.

542
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:10,889
Speaker 1: You know certain things like especially like when he's at his house and he's wandering around outside.

543
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:19,422
Speaker 1: It almost feels like you know, one of those, you know person wandering in the magic woods kind of things Even though it's just a guy in the woods outside his house.

544
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:22,208
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't know if you felt the same thing.

545
00:34:22,471 --> 00:34:25,989
Speaker 0: It was a little surreal when he meets that old man in the woods.

546
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:30,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, because definitely he meets an old man in the woods who got two old men in the woods.

547
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,000
Speaker 1: Well the first one bad one one good one.

548
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,665
Speaker 0: I'm the good one that I'm referring to it.

549
00:34:34,685 --> 00:34:36,150
Speaker 1: Well, it's sort of good.

550
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, yes.

551
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:39,949
Speaker 0: I'm trying to avoid spoiling this book for obvious reasons.

552
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:47,177
Speaker 0: Yeah He appears sage-like almost you would you if you didn't get to the point in the book where yes He's a real person.

553
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,590
Speaker 1: you think he was like a magic wizard.

554
00:34:49,032 --> 00:35:02,989
Speaker 0: Very easy to believe that he was a figment of the main character's imagination because the guy is walking around and this man will kind of appear out of nowhere in the woods and He always has something very wise or pertinent to say about what's going on in the man's life.

555
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:09,728
Speaker 0: but then there is plot as to who that man actually is and and why he's the way he is and it.

556
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:14,750
Speaker 0: I Don't want to speak any more about anything in this comic without ruining.

557
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:19,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember a scene where like someone was dreaming and they woke up but it's like they push.

558
00:35:19,156 --> 00:35:19,618
Speaker 1: they showed.

559
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:24,661
Speaker 1: the way the paneling was is that you you sort of Accepted the dream as what was happening for real.

560
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:27,375
Speaker 1: and then the person wakes up and it actually Like.

561
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:36,169
Speaker 1: I actually felt like I was waking, you know Like the same startling of waking up from like a dream that seems like it's real like oh shit I was like, ah, that was that was pretty good.

562
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:39,836
Speaker 1: You know a lot of comics try to do like dream sequences and they don't.

563
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:41,499
Speaker 1: they don't quite work as well as that.

564
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:49,014
Speaker 0: I Much else we can say.

565
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,500
Speaker 0: I mean, it's fantastic.

566
00:35:50,641 --> 00:35:51,524
Speaker 0: It was great.

567
00:35:52,226 --> 00:35:53,170
Speaker 1: How much Emma should it cost?

568
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,032
Speaker 0: I don't know.

569
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:58,817
Speaker 1: It says on the bot and the book you have it, but that's that's the Suggested retail price.

570
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:04,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what most people are gonna pay 1595. that's not bad or mature.

571
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:08,370
Speaker 1: It's published by I think NBM which is the same people who published, you know dungeon.

572
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:12,890
Speaker 1: They do a lot of the translation of the you know, Franco Belgian comics.

573
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:19,659
Speaker 0: well, in fact if I go on Amazon it recommends buying the second book of this and Dungeon and the rabbi's cat.

574
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,549
Speaker 0: so it's definitely in the same kind of.

575
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:25,705
Speaker 0: It's a comic for people who like the things that we suggest.

576
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,990

578
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:32,950
Speaker 1: maybe because I already bought dungeon in the rabbi's.

579
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:51,696
Speaker 0: so partly in light of the fact that we Want to read more of it before we talk about it any sort of spoilery depth and also because I think it's worth all Of you reading I guess untainted I don't want to really push people into interpreting or seeing this comic in a certain way because It's one of the greats.

580
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:53,265
Speaker 0: It's what already I can see that.
