1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,577
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday November 21st.

2
00:00:11,958 --> 00:00:15,006
Speaker 1: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:18,942
Speaker 0: We we Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:26,270
Speaker 0: You go down to the Nintendo store.

5
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:31,217
Speaker 0: So what?

6
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:33,290
Speaker 0: Sunday I woke up I was sick.

7
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:38,469
Speaker 0: I went down to the city on the train listening to my iPod and some podcasts on the way there.

8
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,736
Speaker 0: Get off the train go to Nintendo store.

9
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:41,700
Speaker 0: I got a pre-order.

10
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:43,868
Speaker 0: I'm guaranteed to walk away with a Wii.

11
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,979
Speaker 1: meanwhile I am in bed completely asleep.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, they got thousands of Wiis there.

13
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,415
Speaker 0: There's no chance They're not gonna have one for me.

14
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:55,830
Speaker 0: The line went from the Nintendo store and almost around the block.

15
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:58,310
Speaker 0: I was on the exact opposite side of the block.

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:09,834
Speaker 0: So it was three sides of a block away and this guy from the Nintendo store is standing at the end of the line And he says, you know, you might be in line here till after 5 p.m When we'll close.

17
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:10,756
Speaker 0: he's like.

18
00:01:10,776 --> 00:01:15,850
Speaker 0: he said that we don't think we can actually process all these people it before we close.

19
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:17,698
Speaker 0: It'll take too long.

20
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,610
Speaker 0: We only have six registers seat now.

21
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:30,746
Speaker 1: I gotta say if I were in charge of the Nintendo store if I were the general manager there I would have taken a page out of the playbook for a lot of conventions a lot of other events.

22
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:35,197
Speaker 1: I would have set up Temporary Extra cash registers.

23
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,790
Speaker 1: you can rent them for very little money.

24
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,514
Speaker 0: That's what I would say.

25
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:43,877
Speaker 0: They had employees that were owned that were just managing the line And not only that had excess employees there.

26
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:46,685
Speaker 1: those registers often come with people to man them.

27
00:01:46,785 --> 00:01:52,230
Speaker 1: you can for very little money rent Cashiers who are very good at what they do for and it cost almost nothing.

28
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:57,730
Speaker 1: They could have just set him up outside even and just process people as fast as possible.

29
00:01:58,112 --> 00:02:01,370
Speaker 0: Yep, instead they kind of process people slowly.

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,182
Speaker 0: I think the problem was is it was sort of inefficient.

31
00:02:04,243 --> 00:02:09,025
Speaker 0: everyone wanted something different, you know And some people had pre-orders and some people didn't and it was kind of.

32
00:02:09,145 --> 00:02:09,949
Speaker 0: it was a little bit tricky.

33
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:15,390
Speaker 0: You know some people wanted different games and they also wanted to make sure nothing got stolen and all that jazz.

34
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,809
Speaker 1: See I would have done something else too.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,570
Speaker 1: I would have said pre-orders from this time this time or pre-orders only day one day two free-for-all.

36
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:30,304
Speaker 0: I actually think before I got there from six to eight I heard I don't know if this is fact that they did pre-orders only for two hours.

37
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,250
Speaker 1: Oh two hours great Yeah.

38
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,614
Speaker 0: But anyway what they did.

39
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:39,977
Speaker 0: there was one big line going around the store and I was in this line and it actually moved a lot Faster than I said it would.

40
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,910
Speaker 0: I was in the store like noon.

41
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:47,918
Speaker 1: They were probably trying to trick people into not standing there But what they did it was really.

42
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:55,370
Speaker 0: essentially there was a line for pre-order people and a line for non pre-order people Even though there wasn't physically two separate lines.

43
00:02:55,852 --> 00:03:13,629
Speaker 0: So what this guy did is he would go down the line and he would say he was a pre-order and he would take the people who at the front who had pre-orders and you know Say go to the head of the class and you would go into the store and as that when the store after people left the Store, he would go down the line and pick out more pre-order people and get them into the store.

44
00:03:14,131 --> 00:03:18,564
Speaker 0: So at you know, eventually I was led into the store way ahead of the people I was standing there.

45
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:26,192
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'm still asleep Yep noon, I Might have gotten up around 11.

46
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:29,490
Speaker 0: Anyway, maybe I don't remember about the line.

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,609
Speaker 0: The only thing really I have to say about the line is it wasn't an exciting line is you know?

48
00:03:33,951 --> 00:03:35,538
Speaker 0: Say the Miyamoto line or anything.

49
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:38,330
Speaker 0: There weren't lots of fanboys with all sorts of stuff.

50
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,120
Speaker 0: I mean one guy had a link costume.

51
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:41,870
Speaker 0: some people had Nintendo shirts.

52
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:49,410
Speaker 0: Not actually that many DS is really and but the line primarily consisted of people who are at least 20 years old.

53
00:03:49,672 --> 00:04:04,577
Speaker 0: There were some parents with kids, you know There were some teenage punk kids But mostly it was 20 plus year old people who all were going to buy the Wii and play it as opposed to homeless people hired by greedy capitalists to Exploit the masses.

54
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:18,680
Speaker 0: so actually like everyone near me, you know They weren't the kind of people I would make friends with and hang out with all the time But they were cool people and they had entertaining and intelligent conversation for a few hours You know talking about mostly video games and such like.

55
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,923
Speaker 0: oh what games you're gonna buy?

56
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,769
Speaker 0: Oh what games you've been playing lately?

57
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, do you like this kind of game?

58
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,613
Speaker 0: Etc, etc.

59
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:27,258
Speaker 1: Any DS is in the line.

60
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:27,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

61
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,650
Speaker 0: I already said there were some but not as many as lines previous.

62
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,556
Speaker 1: Did you have yours?

63
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,362
Speaker 0: Nope what?

64
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:33,510
Speaker 0: I left there home.

65
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,770
Speaker 0: I was I didn't want to carry anything cuz I knew I was gonna have to carry a bunch of shit back.

66
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,054
Speaker 1: You mean one bag?

67
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:40,060
Speaker 0: I didn't want to carry extra shit.

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,163
Speaker 0: Plus I wasn't feeling well.

69
00:04:41,484 --> 00:04:43,290
Speaker 0: that true true and it was cold.

70
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,597
Speaker 0: I wanted to keep my hands in my pockets.

71
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,589
Speaker 1: So you could have worn gloves and played your DS.

72
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,015
Speaker 0: You can't play as a glove.

73
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can in fact today.

74
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:52,834
Speaker 1: I was playing my DS with gloves on Nothing.

75
00:04:52,854 --> 00:04:54,461
Speaker 0: I don't have like tight leather gloves.

76
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,390
Speaker 1: See I got all the gloves I own.

77
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,243
Speaker 1: I have one pair of gigantic ski gloves and everything else are tight leather gloves.

78
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:02,090
Speaker 1: I got for four dollars or less in Chinatown.

79
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:05,327
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna get new gloves and hat this season totally bootleg.

80
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:15,600
Speaker 0: one of them You know, it's kind of annoying is the only thing I wanted to buy besides a Wii is I wanted a new wool hat And I saw these people walking around with these white We will hats and I was like, oh I want one.

81
00:05:15,961 --> 00:05:18,150
Speaker 0: they gave him away at the Toys R Us midnight launch.

82
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:19,336
Speaker 0: I couldn't get one.

83
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:20,200
Speaker 0: I was so pissed.

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,310
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll find one on eBay for like 10 bucks.

85
00:05:22,774 --> 00:05:24,370
Speaker 0: That's about what I'm willing to pay 10 bucks.

86
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

87
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:32,975
Speaker 0: So eventually got inside waited in line in the store for an hour got to the front bought my Wii The only thing they had.

88
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,962
Speaker 0: they didn't have trauma center.

89
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:37,190
Speaker 0: They didn't have that Marvel game, whatever.

90
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,914
Speaker 0: They didn't have every game at the Nintendo World Store but the games they did have.

91
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:49,149
Speaker 0: they had an essentially infinite supply that it essentially infinite supply of Wii and They had an essentially infinite supply of wiimotes and nunchucks.

92
00:05:49,973 --> 00:05:54,810
Speaker 0: But they weren't letting people buy more than one extra wiimote and one extra nunchuck.

93
00:05:55,011 --> 00:06:00,830
Speaker 1: So we can only play two-player games right now Which is kind of annoying because we had four people over all the five feet.

94
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,621
Speaker 1: We really wanted to play Wii games with a lot of people and we couldn't.

95
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:09,321
Speaker 0: I'm sure in a few weeks that we will be Able to buy emotes and nunchucks and we'll be all good.

96
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:22,050
Speaker 0: but right now every store is Almost completely sold out and reports around the country are pretty much agreeing that not only is the Wii sold out But the nunchucks and the wiimotes are sold out as well, but games are not sold out.

97
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:23,124
Speaker 0: You can get games aplenty.

98
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:23,630
Speaker 1: now.

99
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:31,901
Speaker 1: Some people said oh doesn't matter because in some areas you could get wiimotes but not nunchucks and in some areas You could get nunchucks, but not wiimotes.

100
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:32,283
Speaker 0: Yes.

101
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:37,266
Speaker 0: This is one annoying thing Is that the wiimote is $40 retail and the nunchuck is $20 now.

102
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,137
Speaker 0: This is good in the long run.

103
00:06:40,378 --> 00:06:41,903
Speaker 0: because let's say my nunchuck breaks.

104
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:43,810
Speaker 0: I can go buy a new one for 20 bucks.

105
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:44,532
Speaker 0: That's cool.

106
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,647
Speaker 0: Instead of having to buy a wiimote nunchuck combination for say 50 bucks or 60 bucks.

107
00:06:49,831 --> 00:07:06,749
Speaker 0: However in the short run this kind of sucks because you know, what if you basically have to send every store You know like three wiimotes and three nunchucks for every single Wii the store gets to make sure there are enough out there and it doesn't balance out apparently.

108
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:09,657
Speaker 0: and Some game a lot some multiplayer games.

109
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:12,908
Speaker 0: You only need the wiimote and some multiplayer games.

110
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:13,530
Speaker 0: You need both.

111
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:14,473
Speaker 0: So it's got.

112
00:07:14,493 --> 00:07:18,870
Speaker 0: you know, I'd like to only buy like two wiimotes to none or four wiimotes and two nunchucks.

113
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:22,810
Speaker 0: But monkey ball, there's some things where you need four remotes and four nunchucks.

114
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:31,450
Speaker 1: See, I think the way it'll work out is that I would expect Everyone I know to own their own wiimote and just bring it wherever they go.

115
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:36,044
Speaker 0: That's what I would expect also, but at the steep price of $40.

116
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:37,630
Speaker 0: It's a little tough, you know what?

117
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,157
Speaker 1: No, it isn't not for our friends.

118
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,264
Speaker 1: I guess some of them are really poor though I wasn't really pointing out other people just us.

119
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:51,621
Speaker 0: Oh So in the end, I got the Wii I got on the train I came home and then it was we tap.

120
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,630
Speaker 1: now we'll get to all that after the news.

121
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:56,277
Speaker 1: We're not gonna do the news.

122
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:57,723
Speaker 0: Well, here's the news that we came out.

123
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got it.

124
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:17,530
Speaker 1: Actually We'll probably talk about this next week but the news media has generally had the consensus and there have been a lot of reports to the effect that There were a lot of problems in the ps3 launch lines A lot of crime a lot of robberies a lot of injuries a lot of trouble.

125
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:23,972
Speaker 1: There were no as far as I saw reported incidents in any we line anywhere Mm-hmm.

126
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:37,270
Speaker 1: and considering that more people lined up for the Wii because there were more wheeze and there were still people who didn't get wheeze I think that a different kind of crowd was trying to get the Wii as opposed to trying to get the PlayStation 3.

127
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,948
Speaker 0: Yes, the obvious.

128
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:55,660
Speaker 1: So in the interest of going to bed since we are still a little sick more so Scott than me with his seppical or Sepical or however, we've decided to pronounce it.

129
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's a tough call in the pronunciation of seppical.

130
00:08:58,251 --> 00:09:09,730
Speaker 0: I've always said seppical but I look at the box now and there's a line over the E and if I remember correctly that Means long vowel sound and if you know the long vowel sound of easy, so it could be seppical.

131
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:11,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see.

132
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 1: I've never actually used that.

133
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,648
Speaker 1: I usually use halls or chloroceptic.

134
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:26,380
Speaker 0: Sepical basically started out as a chloroceptic spray like the first one and it was wicked powerful because he uses benzocaine and Also menthol or halls is just menthol if I remember right.

135
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:36,501
Speaker 0: and so eventually, you know, it did so well on the market they made the throat lozenge and it's basically the most powerful mouth and Throat numbing thing.

136
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:37,770
Speaker 0: you can get over the counter.

137
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:42,525
Speaker 0: So if you have a sore throat and you just need to go away seppical way to go.

138
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:43,529
Speaker 1: product placement.

139
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:46,530
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, but I'll endorse a product that works.

140
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:55,622
Speaker 1: we decided to skip the news and go right to the things of the day and we're gonna be real to the point about our Things of the day because they're more to the point than we were about seppical.

141
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,630
Speaker 1: They're very simple things of the day.

142
00:09:57,851 --> 00:09:59,180
Speaker 1: I just like saying that okay.

143
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:10,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Actually, it's two yuko things of the day in a row mostly because I'm lazy and I haven't seen anything funny on the internet And I don't really want to talk about the kid getting tasered or Kramer being a racist.

144
00:10:12,392 --> 00:10:13,930
Speaker 0: So we'll save that for next week.

145
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:19,507
Speaker 1: Enjoy this video of a bunch of Siamese kittens versus a bunch of bananas hanging from strings.

146
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:29,190
Speaker 0: Oh, man It's really freaking cute All right Mine is a little animation video thing made by some obviously punk kids possibly college kids.

147
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:35,810
Speaker 0: They put post-it notes on a glass pane and they made stop-motion animation by moving the post-it notes around and taking pictures, right?

148
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,613
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

149
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:37,800
Speaker 0: I like the way it dances.

150
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:51,520
Speaker 0: So without further ado Though we so after the long ordeal at the Nintendo store I received the Wii that I rightfully pre-ordered and I brought it home on the choo-choo train and was not mugged.

151
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:58,290
Speaker 0: and The first thing I knew about the Wii but in before opening it was god damn is it motherfucking small?

152
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,410
Speaker 1: It's a really little box compared to what you might expect.

153
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:08,810
Speaker 0: Like people were walking out of the Nintendo store with these pretty small bags and I was like what did that guy not buy a Wii?

154
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,246
Speaker 0: But and I was like no wait the Wii fits in that bag.

155
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,630
Speaker 0: Oh Shit, and you get in the store and you see these boxes and they're so small.

156
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,790
Speaker 0: I mean, it's bigger than a GameCube box, but that's because it comes with a bunch of extra manuals.

157
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:38,926
Speaker 0: I mean they're putting everything in English Spanish and French where before you know The other languages they didn't concentrate on so much and they got to stick a wiimote in there and the sensor bar and all That other stuff, but if they didn't do that The wiimote itself is so small.

158
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,032
Speaker 0: Oh my god I should.

159
00:11:40,052 --> 00:11:45,838
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take a picture while you're editing the podcast of the wiimote next to a Mac Mini So everyone can see.

160
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:49,234
Speaker 1: yeah and compared to the Wii Yeah I gotta say we.

161
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:55,978
Speaker 1: next I gotta say I wish and I hope that Apple and Nintendo Would do some fun things together.

162
00:11:56,038 --> 00:12:04,910
Speaker 1: make a little incestuous love child because I got to say the Wii Looks real slick next to that Mac Mini and I feel like the two of them should do something together.

163
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,144
Speaker 1: I feel like my wiimote should work with Bluetooth on the Mac.

164
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:09,430
Speaker 0: We tried to get it to work.

165
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,177
Speaker 0: We just we tried to make the wiimote Bluetooth work as a pointing device of the Mac Mini And it didn't work.

166
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,470
Speaker 1: We tried the minimal amount of.

167
00:12:18,857 --> 00:12:21,290
Speaker 0: We said does this work right away with no modifications?

168
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:22,393
Speaker 0: No, no, it doesn't.

169
00:12:22,634 --> 00:12:25,887
Speaker 1: it almost did until we had to type the passkey into the wiimote.

170
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:40,837
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, so Unboxing the Wii was really very different in experience from the unboxing of any other Console I've ever had.

171
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:50,589
Speaker 0: well basically it had like these numbers on parts of the box So that idiots and people who don't know how to set up computer audio visual electronics equipment could follow.

172
00:12:50,609 --> 00:12:58,569
Speaker 1: well No, actually, there's a trend lately in a lot of things because I didn't talk about this yet but I'd install some printers at work giant expensive HP printers.

173
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:13,202
Speaker 1: and The cool thing was it came in this special package with all this fancy Cardboard folded in fancy ways so that you open it and Each part of the package like comes out in a special way and it makes it really easy to unpack and protects the thing really well.

174
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,790
Speaker 1: packaging science has come a long way.

175
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:23,098
Speaker 0: Yeah the Wii box scene you open it up and it says one two obviously pull out number one first do it number one says then Pull out number two and do it.

176
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:24,609
Speaker 0: number two says and etcetera etcetera.

177
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,110
Speaker 0: But we just took the Wii out.

178
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:36,096
Speaker 0: we plugged in the sensor bar put on top of the TV plugged it into the wall with the Incredibly relatively small power cable Maybe plugged in what else.

179
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,464
Speaker 0: Oh the AV cables right into the back of the TV.

180
00:13:38,664 --> 00:13:40,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we still got to get the component cable.

181
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,538
Speaker 0: Yep, we pushed the power button and we were good to go.

182
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,504
Speaker 1: We were we in here we now.

183
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:50,360
Speaker 1: the first thing we noticed His Scott experienced at first he's holding the Wiimote.

184
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,950
Speaker 1: We didn't even put the sensor bar up really, right?

185
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,327
Speaker 1: We just got to toss it on top of the TV.

186
00:13:54,892 --> 00:13:56,622
Speaker 1: We just went as fast as possible.

187
00:13:56,722 --> 00:13:57,989
Speaker 1: get it going get it going turn it on.

188
00:13:58,891 --> 00:14:01,194
Speaker 1: It was pretty much perfect the Wiimote with.

189
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:14,590
Speaker 0: no matter how poorly you set your room up the Wiimote pretty much just works as appointing device in the menus of the Wii Channels area and all the Wii the bait that the Wii operating system interface.

190
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:18,002
Speaker 0: It's pretty much like a mouse, but you hold it in your hand.

191
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:20,330
Speaker 0: I mean it works with optical mouse technology.

192
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:22,015
Speaker 0: We basically learned this over time.

193
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,339
Speaker 0: is that the sensor bar?

194
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,262
Speaker 0: all it really does?

195
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:29,719
Speaker 0: is it has some infrared LEDs in it that blink And the Wiimote has a camera that looks for.

196
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,750
Speaker 0: these LEDs sort of like your optical mouse is a camera that looks at the table.

197
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:51,062
Speaker 0: So when you move the Wiimote around, you know trying to use it as a pointing device not as its other functions but it can tell if it's moving left or if it's moving right or up or down and then the arrow on the screen moves accordingly and As a pointing device to pick different items on the screen.

198
00:14:51,242 --> 00:14:53,770
Speaker 0: It's pretty much perfect unless you have infrared interference.

199
00:14:54,231 --> 00:15:04,005
Speaker 1: Yep, now there are a lot of cool people trying to figure out exactly how this works because basically your remote is kind of like A camera, so people are trying to figure out now how high resolution is it?

200
00:15:04,045 --> 00:15:05,089
Speaker 1: How sensitive is it?

201
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,655
Speaker 1: If you want to really see this well take a digital camera especially an older one or one.

202
00:15:10,696 --> 00:15:15,512
Speaker 1: you can remove the IR filter from and take a picture or look at Your.

203
00:15:15,953 --> 00:15:20,189
Speaker 1: we can your bar the sensor bar and you'll see a whole bunch of lights coming out of it.

204
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:27,830
Speaker 0: Yep, if you if you run monkey ball calibration mode, you can actually see what the camera in the Wiimote sees.

205
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, it gives you a semi rod dump straight up.

206
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,190
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's basically two blinking dots and that's what's in the sensor bar.

207
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,154
Speaker 0: So it's pretty.

208
00:15:36,174 --> 00:15:36,777
Speaker 0: that's how it works.

209
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:37,300
Speaker 1: Yeah.

210
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:39,450
Speaker 0: Now the Wiimote also does other things.

211
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:53,930
Speaker 0: You can rotate it in pretty much every different direction and flick it in different directions and these accelerometers in the Wiimote Which are pretty much Average run-of-the-mill accelerometers from electronic shop they detect when you rotate it or move it.

212
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,910
Speaker 0: So for example in the Wii menu your cursor isn't an arrow like on every computer.

213
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,470
Speaker 0: It's a hand with a finger pointing up and it has a number in the middle of it.

214
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,361
Speaker 0: so player one has a blue hand with the number one and Player two has a red hand with the number two.

215
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:09,266
Speaker 0: We don't know what.

216
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,130
Speaker 0: players three and four.

217
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:21,182
Speaker 0: I imagine it's green and some other color probably probably totally guessing But you move the Wiimote around like you're trying to point at the screen and The hand moves around if you just rotate.

218
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:22,650
Speaker 1: this was one of the shining moments.

219
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:33,429
Speaker 0: I you've Scott rotated his hand his wrists just a little bit I flipped it over so it was all gangsta style and the hand on the screen Flipped over and now instead of the finger pointing up the finger was pointing down.

220
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:35,107
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

221
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:39,126
Speaker 1: Now in general, I mean in terms of unboxing the thing and plugging it in.

222
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:48,110
Speaker 1: aside from all that This was the first console where after we plugged it in We went for almost two hours before we put even a single game into this thing.

223
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean when I put the game when I set up the GameCube, which is the last console we got.

224
00:16:51,762 --> 00:17:03,190
Speaker 0: You know it took me a few minutes to set the time and date and it took me a Committed or two to check the memory card thing to see how it worked and then popped in Luigi's Mansion Which is the only game that day and we were off.

225
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:04,748
Speaker 0: But the Wii.

226
00:17:05,531 --> 00:17:07,309
Speaker 0: First I had to set up the internet connection.

227
00:17:07,832 --> 00:17:09,217
Speaker 0: Then I had to install.

228
00:17:09,257 --> 00:17:12,569
Speaker 0: I had to put my Wii points that I bought two thousand Wii points on a card.

229
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:14,369
Speaker 0: I had to install them into the Wii store.

230
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:20,087
Speaker 0: Then we had to make me now and we had to try everything else before we even played a game.

231
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:23,016
Speaker 0: We'll get to the Mies Mm-hmm be that we will.

232
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:23,558
Speaker 1: there was.

233
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,163
Speaker 1: there's a lot of stuff to do.

234
00:17:25,223 --> 00:17:31,065
Speaker 1: the Wii by itself is Barely entertaining and has potential for great amounts of entertainment.

235
00:17:31,145 --> 00:17:39,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was disappointed However that the opera browser the news channel and the weather channel are not yet available.

236
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,021
Speaker 0: I'm still waiting for those because I was really looking forward to that.

237
00:17:42,122 --> 00:17:43,668
Speaker 1: But yeah, I got a couple guesses.

238
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:44,696
Speaker 1: the weather one I don't know.

239
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:45,609
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not ready yet.

240
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,562
Speaker 1: Maybe they want to wait until the wheeze are already on.

241
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:52,599
Speaker 1: they have an idea of how many are out there online Before they put these servers live.

242
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:55,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know though opera about browser.

243
00:17:55,652 --> 00:18:12,390
Speaker 1: My guess is that the reason it is not working yet and not available yet is that they are trying to make sure There is some sort of don't let children see Pornography or run into child predators option and they want to make sure it works because Nintendo is so paranoid about that.

244
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a thing when I turned the Wii on for the first time.

245
00:18:16,268 --> 00:18:18,130
Speaker 0: it asked me Do you want to set parental controls?

246
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,379
Speaker 0: Do you want to do this and that?

247
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,810
Speaker 0: and I just said no to all of it.

248
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:26,610
Speaker 0: Of course because we don't need parental controls in our house But there it is if you're a parent and you care about that sort of thing.

249
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:38,504
Speaker 0: I imagine it works via the ESRB system because I can't imagine what other system it worked by actually In America, it works by the ESRB In Japan, it works by another system that you know this for sure.

250
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:40,530
Speaker 1: I read an article about this this morning.

251
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:49,130
Speaker 1: Okay, so apparently I don't have the article in front of me So take my five-minute readings word on it, but at least in America it goes by the ESRB.

252
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,523
Speaker 1: Obviously, this doesn't work for GameCube games.

253
00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:53,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

254
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,753
Speaker 0: So for Wii games.

255
00:18:54,794 --> 00:19:01,596
Speaker 0: you can just set it, you know only play games that are tier less and you need a parental unlock I guess to play any other game.

256
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:02,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there's a code.

257
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,170
Speaker 1: you can like you set a code.

258
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,878
Speaker 1: Then you can enter the code to override it.

259
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,721
Speaker 1: I don't know.

260
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:09,473
Speaker 1: We didn't really actually play with that Obviously.

261
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,224
Speaker 0: All right, so let's talk about the the console a little bit.

262
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:18,565
Speaker 0: when you put discs into it It grabs the disc the way the Mac Mini does only better like right away.

263
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:19,950
Speaker 1: It feels really good.

264
00:19:20,171 --> 00:19:22,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you put a GameCube disc.

265
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:23,370
Speaker 0: like the hole is big.

266
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,190
Speaker 0: It's a hole big enough for a Wii game, which is about the size of a DVD Maybe slightly different from the size of a DVD.

267
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,479
Speaker 0: I haven't actually put them next to each other to find out.

268
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,970
Speaker 1: so one of those little GameCube discs is really be sidewalling if you Try to stick it in there.

269
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:44,283
Speaker 0: Yeah You could put the GameCube disc in the middle You could put it in the side You could put it in the other side and it'll suck it right in and work just fine No matter where you put it in that big old slot.

270
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:45,189
Speaker 0: It's really cool.

271
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:53,286
Speaker 0: I mean you could just sit there putting GameCube discs in and taking them out all day And also while you can stick a disc in upside down, it doesn't hurt anything.

272
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,450
Speaker 1: It doesn't scratch the disc.

273
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:55,255
Speaker 1: It just says up.

274
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,025
Speaker 1: I can't read this disc and spits it back out.

275
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:06,733
Speaker 0: Yep The other thing is the Wii is really small and you notice the people always in the pictures online or have it on its side In the little stand.

276
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:14,777
Speaker 0: I opted to just put it lying, you know face up like a little player way to be different Horizontally, I just rested it right there.

277
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:15,982
Speaker 0: You'll see it in the picture.

278
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:16,223
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

279
00:20:16,243 --> 00:20:17,930
Speaker 1: maybe we'll put it on top of the Mac Mini.

280
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:19,790
Speaker 1: We'll make a Nintendo come back.

281
00:20:19,931 --> 00:20:20,839
Speaker 0: I don't know what we want to do.

282
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:22,049
Speaker 0: that little heat issues.

283
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:26,730
Speaker 0: Plus the Wii is a little longer than the Mac Mini, but it's shorter and less wide.

284
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that wouldn't balance.

285
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:32,490
Speaker 1: I want to make room for the Atari 7800 that's bigger than both of them combined.

286
00:20:33,012 --> 00:20:34,478
Speaker 1: Wow, think about that.

287
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:40,221
Speaker 1: The Atari 7800 is half air inside Yeah, and also it has really big resistors.

288
00:20:40,242 --> 00:20:46,444
Speaker 1: Like if you look inside an old Atari system It's the kind of board that I would solder on my own.

289
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:47,006
Speaker 1: Yeah.

290
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:57,598
Speaker 0: Parts from Radio Shack Yeah, a lot of electronics parts like back in the day like a capacitor for like with a set number of amount of storage Of capacitance.

291
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,303
Speaker 1: Wow.

292
00:20:58,403 --> 00:20:59,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was great.

293
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:11,727
Speaker 0: Back in the 80s was a big thing physically and today you can get that same electronic part But really really small, you know miniaturization, which is probably one of the best advances in Civ 2.

294
00:21:11,727 --> 00:21:12,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, it probably is.

295
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,441
Speaker 1: Yeah, it leads to all sorts of fun.

296
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:15,285
Speaker 1: Okay.

297
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:18,440
Speaker 0: Yeah So let's talk about the Wii interface.

298
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,787
Speaker 0: is you move this arrow around?

299
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:25,934
Speaker 0: and the Coolest thing that I thought was when you move it around from item to item it Vibrates.

300
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:28,051
Speaker 0: when you move it between items You can.

301
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:34,730
Speaker 0: actually it actually feels like all the buttons on the screen are physical buttons and you're bumping over from one to the next.

302
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:38,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can't stress how absolutely intuitive this is.

303
00:21:38,204 --> 00:21:39,530
Speaker 1: I could hand this to my grandma.

304
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,269
Speaker 1: Well, not like I could end this to my grandpa and he would just immediately be able to use it.

305
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:46,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's only cuz your grandma has problems.

306
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:48,190
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, she has Alzheimer's.

307
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, my grandma doesn't have Alzheimer's and she probably couldn't but my grandpa could after a few minutes wait But he has a pacemaker so he can't use it.

308
00:21:55,639 --> 00:21:55,880
Speaker 1: What?

309
00:21:56,121 --> 00:21:57,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do you mean?

310
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:58,090
Speaker 1: He gets a pacemaker?

311
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,293
Speaker 1: He can't use a sensor.

312
00:21:59,354 --> 00:22:02,544
Speaker 0: Apparently it says on the Wii if you have a pacemaker don't play.

313
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:04,210
Speaker 1: that's ridiculous.

314
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:05,614
Speaker 0: That's what it says.

315
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,380
Speaker 1: That's absolutely ridiculous.

316
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,866
Speaker 0: There might be some kind of interference.

317
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,835
Speaker 0: Maybe perhaps the blue There's no interference.

318
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:18,938
Speaker 1: if that was true then people with pacemakers couldn't go near computers which give off far more Interference than the we know.

319
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:19,904
Speaker 0: that's what it says.

320
00:22:19,944 --> 00:22:20,950
Speaker 0: That's what the internet says.

321
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:21,856
Speaker 0: I've seen the pic.

322
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:26,059
Speaker 0: it's in the manual that the health and Sort of BS, you know this.

323
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,606
Speaker 1: it's like the epilepsy thing is double.

324
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:28,370
Speaker 0: get my grandpa.

325
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,991
Speaker 0: We'll try to get him to play we golf and we bowling cuz he loves golf and bowling like and we'll see if he falls Over.

326
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:38,230
Speaker 1: well like fun fact, you know a long time ago used to be like microwaves had warnings.

327
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:44,189
Speaker 1: No, don't be around with a pacemaker, but modern microwaves are for the most part shielded enough to where it doesn't matter.

328
00:22:44,973 --> 00:22:47,230
Speaker 1: Your pacemaker is not gonna have trouble with your microwave.

329
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:50,285
Speaker 0: Well, we'll find out when my grandpa tries to play we bowling.

330
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,094
Speaker 1: of course He's gonna play we bowling.

331
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:59,425
Speaker 1: we bowling is one of the best games and even though we solved it And it's all I saw that you didn't I saw what you did.

332
00:22:59,485 --> 00:23:00,509
Speaker 1: It didn't look too tough to do.

333
00:23:00,851 --> 00:23:02,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see if you get to all that.

334
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so horse feedback is awesome.

335
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:12,390
Speaker 1: The fact that the PlayStation 3 doesn't have rumble really isn't cool, especially feeling how well the Wii is using rumble.

336
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:17,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean like I didn't care about when rumble came out for the n64.

337
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,068
Speaker 0: I was like whatever.

338
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:18,550
Speaker 0: who gives you?

339
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, well the n64 rumble was really ham-fisted.

340
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:21,853
Speaker 1: It was really this.

341
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:26,810
Speaker 1: the controller would either be sitting there normal or shaking wildly at semi random times.

342
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:31,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they had forced feedback for joysticks on the PC a long time ago.

343
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:42,238
Speaker 0: And while I thought it was cool and semi useful for a few games especially space flying games There was so many different Standards for it and so many different joysticks.

344
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:43,301
Speaker 0: It just didn't pan out.

345
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:46,010
Speaker 0: and now it's like a few people have all the patents for it.

346
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,223
Speaker 0: So that real force feedback for joysticks is dead.

347
00:23:49,424 --> 00:23:50,609
Speaker 0: And so we're flying games.

348
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,394
Speaker 0: Yep, so forget that.

349
00:23:52,775 --> 00:24:00,061
Speaker 1: and you know rumble really started getting good with the GameCube where it was mostly the PlayStation 1 And the PlayStation when the dual shock came out.

350
00:24:00,101 --> 00:24:01,570
Speaker 0: that's when rumble was used properly.

351
00:24:01,711 --> 00:24:06,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of games for those systems even though they could have used it Well used it poorly.

352
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,310
Speaker 0: a lot of games for every sit pretty much any game for the play.

353
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:18,361
Speaker 0: Once the dual shock was came out and as the GameCube and every other system that had rumble As soon as those systems existed every game that came out was using rumble.

354
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:22,349
Speaker 0: some games used rumble properly and some games Didn't use rumble prop.

355
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:24,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the most games didn't use rumble.

356
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,912
Speaker 1: proper games that used it well were the ones with very subtle You don't like that.

357
00:24:28,454 --> 00:24:34,740
Speaker 1: your engine start and there's this very very faint rumbling in the controller And then as you accelerate the rumble increases.

358
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,343
Speaker 1: things like that.

359
00:24:35,363 --> 00:24:36,670
Speaker 1: Yeah little little things.

360
00:24:37,172 --> 00:24:39,059
Speaker 0: I mean there were some games where it's like you die.

361
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,786
Speaker 0: it rumbles a whole bunch other than that.

362
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:41,710
Speaker 0: It doesn't rumble at all.

363
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,696
Speaker 0: It's like good rumbling games.

364
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:47,810
Speaker 0: You'll know use the rumble often and they use it appropriately.

365
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,018
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, but the wiimote make sound.

366
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,060
Speaker 0: you probably know this.

367
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:56,190
Speaker 0: you barely even notice it when you're playing because it's just so natural.

368
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:57,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you took it.

369
00:24:57,836 --> 00:25:01,109
Speaker 0: it's one of those things where you don't notice when it's there unless you're looking for it.

370
00:25:01,592 --> 00:25:04,450
Speaker 0: But if someone took it away you'd go where to go and you'd be pissed off.

371
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:08,530
Speaker 1: There's little things like in Wii sports when it's your turn your controller goes ping.

372
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:12,890
Speaker 0: Yeah in bowling and Wii bowling, you know, you sit there while someone else is bowling.

373
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,170
Speaker 0: You're just sitting there holding your wiimote and you know picking your nose or whatever.

374
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:22,033
Speaker 0: Then when the other person is done bowling your Wii shakes a little bit and makes a noise like doo Go bowl.

375
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:27,134
Speaker 1: or when you're boxing and you hit someone well, it makes a hitting noise Out of the wiimote.

376
00:25:27,475 --> 00:25:27,656
Speaker 0: Yep.

377
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:28,880
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

378
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:32,636
Speaker 1: or and in terms of rumble actually the Madden game This is really cool.

379
00:25:32,676 --> 00:25:37,850
Speaker 1: If you're choosing plays you can hover over like, you know You point out what play you want and you hover over whatever play.

380
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:38,308
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, okay.

381
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:42,870
Speaker 0: So yeah, because in Madden the problem is you'll pick a play and everyone sees what play you picked.

382
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:47,565
Speaker 0: Oh now they're gonna pick the perfect defense or the perfect offense to counteract the play you chose.

383
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:56,506
Speaker 0: if you hold the B button Which is the trigger on the bottom of the wiimote and pick a play with that It won't actually look on the screen like that.

384
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:57,350
Speaker 0: you pick that play.

385
00:25:57,471 --> 00:25:59,449
Speaker 0: It'll look like you just passed over that play.

386
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:03,590
Speaker 0: Then you pick another play with the a button and it looks like you picked that other play.

387
00:26:03,991 --> 00:26:06,239
Speaker 0: But in reality you picked the first play.

388
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:10,673
Speaker 1: now it tells your partner your teammate if it's multiplayer How does it happen?

389
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:16,170
Speaker 1: by making their wiimote vibrate a little bit in their hand when you're pointing at the right play?

390
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:26,786
Speaker 0: Yep So if you have people on your team and you're the one who picks the plays you pick a play Everyone knows on your team knows because their wiimotes vibrate and then you pick some other play to confuse the opponents.

391
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:29,413
Speaker 1: now that to me Is hot shit.

392
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:35,890
Speaker 1: that demonstrates one of the small but very awesome things you can do with this sort of technology.

393
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:43,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Wii is really all about really small stuff lots and lots of incredibly small perfections.

394
00:26:43,670 --> 00:27:00,888
Speaker 0: It's sort of like World of Warcraft in a way in that they took the standard MMO Which basically I have I'm against the standard MMO, which is the reason I don't like World of Warcraft But I got to give it to him and that they took all the little things that were wrong with every other standard MMO And they fixed all of them and polished all of them.

395
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:05,847
Speaker 0: The Wii is a game console which I have no problem with and they polished all the little things.

396
00:27:06,108 --> 00:27:06,610
Speaker 0: So it was great.

397
00:27:07,471 --> 00:27:11,230
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the wiimotes themselves, I mean way back when they first announced it.

398
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,135
Speaker 1: it was a little bigger.

399
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:16,534
Speaker 1: they you know made it smaller and such and now it's Really small.

400
00:27:16,995 --> 00:27:18,058
Speaker 0: it looks really small.

401
00:27:18,078 --> 00:27:18,339
Speaker 0: you go.

402
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:22,050
Speaker 0: No way, but then you hold it and you're like, ah, oh it kind of fits my hand.

403
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it feels absolutely perfect.

404
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:32,730
Speaker 0: I imagine someone with huge Frickin incredible Hulk hands is gonna have a problem and someone with little tiny hands is gonna have a problem also.

405
00:27:33,171 --> 00:27:41,710
Speaker 0: But everyone that was over our house ranging from small people to big people Yeah was doing just fine and in terms I mean you hold it sideways.

406
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,082
Speaker 1: So it's a normal controller and it fits really well.

407
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:46,146
Speaker 1: It really feels good.

408
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:47,230
Speaker 0: It's an excite truck.

409
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,500
Speaker 0: You don't hold it like a remote.

410
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:53,830
Speaker 0: you hold it like an old NES Controller with the arrows on the left and one and two on the right and it works.

411
00:27:53,911 --> 00:27:55,402
Speaker 0: Well, like I'm really good at excite truck.

412
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:56,350
Speaker 1: now Wow excite truck.

413
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,950
Speaker 1: I got to say that would that really proved to me how intuitive this is.

414
00:28:00,754 --> 00:28:01,239
Speaker 1: We sat down.

415
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,290
Speaker 1: Scott has played it a bunch of times.

416
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:06,010
Speaker 1: I finally sit down to race against him and I hope I sit there and the game starts.

417
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:07,779
Speaker 1: I just kind of hold my wiimote naturally.

418
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,910
Speaker 1: I had no idea how to play the game.

419
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,523
Speaker 1: I'd never even seen the game before.

420
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:15,923
Speaker 1: and you know It's one two three go and I start going and it.

421
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:28,410
Speaker 1: after about a minute of racing I realized that I was using the wiimote and that I wasn't touching buttons other than you know The gas button and I was just staring with my hands and I kind of expected the way to feel weird.

422
00:28:28,451 --> 00:28:37,090
Speaker 1: You know, I'm moving the controller I'm not hitting the d-pad or moving an analog stick But I totally didn't notice that I was playing a Wii for a while.

423
00:28:37,673 --> 00:28:42,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, you expect it to be all fascinating like whoa Like, you know, you play virtual reality.

424
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:55,355
Speaker 0: I'll think the calibration of everything is always seems to be off like you move the gun in a VR game And then the camera angle moves crazily and you can kind of feel it and it's very noticeable in the Wii Totally subtle.

425
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:56,559
Speaker 0: You don't even realize you're doing it.

426
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,269
Speaker 1: That's probably the Wii's biggest strength is just that absolute intuitiveness.

427
00:29:02,155 --> 00:29:07,679
Speaker 0: so we set up the Wii's internet connection and It did its internet thing and updated with no problems.

428
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:13,189
Speaker 0: apparently some people are having problems updating the firmware and I don't know what their problem is.

429
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:21,550
Speaker 1: Yeah Luckily, it seems to be a very small minority and Nintendo is right on that if you actually have a problem Yeah, the Wii does have a warranty and you can get it.

430
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,070
Speaker 0: But I mean every console that has come out in the past 10 years has had problems at launch.

431
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,815
Speaker 1: No, but think it is expected.

432
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:29,560
Speaker 1: if your PlayStation 3 doesn't work.

433
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:33,850
Speaker 1: When do you think somebody's gonna give you another PlayStation 3?

434
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,074
Speaker 1: Nintendo right now.

435
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:43,542
Speaker 1: they sold out but they have more Wiis because if you have a problem they ship you a Wii Immediately, well, they ship you a Wii when you send them your Wii.

436
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,289
Speaker 0: So you're gonna go a few days without a Wii.

437
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:47,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, but other than that you'll get a new one.

438
00:29:48,045 --> 00:29:48,729
Speaker 1: I have a feeling.

439
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:55,309
Speaker 1: well I'm not gonna bash the PlayStation 3 but I don't think you'll get a PlayStation 3 real quick if your PlayStation 3 doesn't work.

440
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,157
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

441
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,004
Speaker 0: So what comes next?

442
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:00,350
Speaker 0: we got the Wii modes.

443
00:30:01,013 --> 00:30:03,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so let's talk about the Wii channels.

444
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,890
Speaker 0: the first channel I'll talk about is this photo channel.

445
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:11,530
Speaker 1: This is really really completely unnecessary and yet at the same time really really nice.

446
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:18,033
Speaker 0: So the photo channel the front of the Wii has a little flat and you open it up and you can put it in an SD Card.

447
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:20,690
Speaker 0: I took the SD card out of my digital camera.

448
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:24,364
Speaker 0: It contains some pictures that we took and one video that I took.

449
00:30:24,424 --> 00:30:27,515
Speaker 0: I don't know when I took the video though I know when you took it.

450
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:30,625
Speaker 1: you were driving and for some reason you accidentally took a video.

451
00:30:30,806 --> 00:30:32,130
Speaker 0: I must have anyway.

452
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:40,811
Speaker 0: I put it in the Wii and The Wii didn't say anything and we went to the photo channel and there were all the pictures and we could look at all Of them.

453
00:30:40,851 --> 00:30:41,898
Speaker 0: we could zoom in all of them.

454
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,509
Speaker 0: We could draw on all of them.

455
00:30:43,891 --> 00:30:48,690
Speaker 0: We could turn any picture into a puzzle, you know, like a sliding piece puzzle to you know, whatever.

456
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:56,174
Speaker 0: most importantly it had a slideshow and yeah had a slideshow that had epic sort of music and It could.

457
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:56,555
Speaker 0: what was the?

458
00:30:56,636 --> 00:31:02,716
Speaker 0: oh it can apply certain filters to any of the photos make them brighter or Negative or anything like black and white.

459
00:31:02,976 --> 00:31:04,200
Speaker 1: that that parts kind of silly.

460
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,326
Speaker 1: They're for they're completely useless.

461
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:06,988
Speaker 0: Yes.

462
00:31:07,168 --> 00:31:07,710
Speaker 0: It's kind of dumb.

463
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:08,252
Speaker 1: It's just fun.

464
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,762
Speaker 0: You can save the modified photos to your.

465
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:17,642
Speaker 0: the Wii has some internal memory so if you don't have an SD card You can just save things to the memory in your Wii.

466
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:29,709
Speaker 0: an SD card is sort of like a memory Expansion and also a way to you know, take things in and out of your Wii and to bring them with you But you don't have to buy any memory cards for the Wii really you can just save everything in the Wii.

467
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:35,606
Speaker 0: Your virtual console games you can save in the Wii or on an SD card, you know, whatever you want.

468
00:31:35,967 --> 00:31:37,793
Speaker 1: now aside from that I mean, that's really cool.

469
00:31:38,154 --> 00:31:40,000
Speaker 1: There was the store channel.

470
00:31:40,603 --> 00:31:47,270
Speaker 0: Oh, well first of all, I gotta mention one thing though Is that the video on my that my digital camera took also worked on the Wii.

471
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:52,640
Speaker 0: We could make a puzzle out of the video, which is oh, yeah That hurt my brain trying to watch that.

472
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,145
Speaker 1: that don't do it.

473
00:31:54,286 --> 00:32:03,516
Speaker 0: everything you can do to photos You can do videos, but it only works with JPEGs standard JPEG avi Movies and mp3s.

474
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:04,941
Speaker 0: nothing else works in the Wii.

475
00:32:05,001 --> 00:32:10,330
Speaker 0: So if you take an SD card out of a digital camera You're just using it's probably gonna work just fine.

476
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:17,133
Speaker 0: If you try to take photos off the internet and put them on an SD card put in your Wii Unless they're all JPEGs This isn't gonna.

477
00:32:17,153 --> 00:32:21,010
Speaker 0: you know, you can't take Divx movies or x-vid movies and put them on an SD card.

478
00:32:21,271 --> 00:32:23,436
Speaker 1: Sorry, this isn't for you.

479
00:32:23,897 --> 00:32:24,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

480
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:35,450
Speaker 0: maybe they'll fix that in a firmware update cuz I can understand why they wouldn't include some Formats like I don't know AAC and WMA, but there's no reason not to include a hug, which is free other.

481
00:32:35,591 --> 00:32:36,514
Speaker 0: No one cares about it.

482
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,202
Speaker 1: I think that's the primary reason.

483
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:39,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, but doesn't hurt to have it.

484
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:43,739
Speaker 1: It takes development effort to put it in.

485
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:49,536
Speaker 1: it does low priority, but anyway, yeah, but the store Don't mind Scott coughing.

486
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:50,599
Speaker 1: He's still a bit sick.

487
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in the store you can buy.

488
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:57,630
Speaker 0: We chant you could buy more Wii channels and virtual console game.

489
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,358
Speaker 1: There aren't any more Wii channels to buy yet.

490
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:00,000
Speaker 1: There will be.

491
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:02,170
Speaker 1: I imagine there's going to be a lot of fun things.

492
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,610
Speaker 0: Yes, so the two ways to get first any Wii points now.

493
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:08,584
Speaker 0: Usually I'm wary of point systems because they're usually a scam.

494
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:14,750
Speaker 0: the reason people have point systems Is because they want you to convert your money into points that can ever be converted back into money.

495
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:20,770
Speaker 0: Then they hold on to your money and they make they basically made money off you before you actually bought anything.

496
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:26,630
Speaker 0: It's like giving a store like $20 and saying I'll buy something from you someday, but not right now.

497
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,725
Speaker 0: You just hold on to that money and make interest on it until you know Get a hundred percent profit until I actually decide to come and take something from you.

498
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:33,850
Speaker 0: It's a great deal.

499
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:47,896
Speaker 0: The other reason they have point systems is because what they do is they make everything available Worth some weird number of points so that it's impossible to get your account down to zero points and Thus not give them any more money.

500
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,944
Speaker 1: Well, except actually with the Wii.

501
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:51,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I was gonna get to that.

502
00:33:51,651 --> 00:33:55,387
Speaker 0: You know, usually you'll run down to like a hundred points and the cheapest thing in the store is 200 points.

503
00:33:56,351 --> 00:34:01,890
Speaker 0: So you're like, uh, I don't want to let them have that hundred points worth of money forever.

504
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:06,210
Speaker 0: I want to get something, you know for what I paid already, but I can't get anything.

505
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,129
Speaker 0: So now I got to put in more money to get something and then get my.

506
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,422
Speaker 0: you know It's very difficult to get your balance to zero on the Wii not so in Japan.

507
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,967
Speaker 0: one yen is one point.

508
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:16,750
Speaker 0: in the u.s.

509
00:34:17,552 --> 00:34:19,500
Speaker 0: One yen at one point is one cent.

510
00:34:19,821 --> 00:34:22,250
Speaker 0: So one dollar gets you like a hundred points.

511
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you can just buy points.

512
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:24,501
Speaker 0: You can just buy points.

513
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,350
Speaker 0: You can go to the store and buy a card.

514
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:31,550
Speaker 0: That's two thousand points for twenty dollars and you scratch it off and there's a number on it.

515
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,172
Speaker 0: You type the number into the Wii and You're good to go.

516
00:34:34,474 --> 00:34:38,590
Speaker 0: or you can type your credit card number into the Wii and buy points directly from Nintendo.

517
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:45,237
Speaker 0: then when you want to buy something is go into the store click on what you buy and click buy and it takes points away and Gives you whatever you bought.

518
00:34:45,661 --> 00:34:46,569
Speaker 0: and that's all there is to it.

519
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:53,449
Speaker 1: Yep, though another reason and I can see why they would do this The reason they'd like to use point systems like this is that you've already paid for it.

520
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:55,650
Speaker 1: So now it doesn't feel like real money.

521
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:00,288
Speaker 1: I mean if you tell someone, you know, they're looking five bucks for Mario Brothers screw that.

522
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,939
Speaker 1: but Five hundred points for Mario Brothers.

523
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:04,666
Speaker 1: I have two thousand points.

524
00:35:04,706 --> 00:35:05,530
Speaker 1: That's almost nothing.

525
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:07,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been.

526
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:23,810
Speaker 0: every time I go and look at the virtual console I keep it in mind that a hundred points is a dollar and I look and I see pinball for the NES which is a game I kind of want to play because it's I have some history with that game and Has that fun little minigame with with Mario and what's-her-name?

527
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:31,470
Speaker 0: Not the princess, but that other girl where you the ball bounces and Mario metal thing back and forth But it's like five dollars.

528
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,717
Speaker 0: I'm like five dollars for pinball.

529
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:38,070
Speaker 0: I get that like at five for a dollar at the local store on an NES cartridge.

530
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll pay you 50 points for that not 500 for free.

531
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,246
Speaker 1: on to internet.

532
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:48,010
Speaker 0: Yeah Like I go to venus.com with the Opera browser once it's available and play it there.

533
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:54,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are some games I imagine will buy and I imagine that the prices on older games will eventually come down or something.

534
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,149
Speaker 0: That's what I'm counting on.

535
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:04,635
Speaker 0: I'm hoping that as games like the first games that came out in the virtual console or like pinball Zelda Donkey Kong etc.

536
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:05,517
Speaker 0: Etc.

537
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:10,149
Speaker 0: in a gear those games are gonna still be sitting in the virtual console now.

538
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:16,789
Speaker 0: either What they're gonna do is take old games out and put in new games and thus, you know, you'll be like, oh I missed out.

539
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:24,110
Speaker 0: or The old games will sit in there and they'll decrease them in price and number of points they cost so that more people will get.

540
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:25,803
Speaker 0: And I hope they do the second thing now.

541
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:26,669
Speaker 1: Here's what I foresee.

542
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:35,082
Speaker 1: I imagine that eventually what they'll do is they'll take a lot of old games Put them into packages that you can then buy like for a thousand points.

543
00:36:35,122 --> 00:36:37,790
Speaker 1: get these 15 games from last year.

544
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:46,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, the virtual console the only real problem with it beside it works Great, is that it really does cost a bit too much for the games.

545
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:51,736
Speaker 0: I mean when ice hockey comes out I'll pay five bucks for ice hockey But most of the games.

546
00:36:52,117 --> 00:37:00,700
Speaker 0: while I want them and I really I kind of want them to play on my Wii I'm not gonna pay that money for them but I think a lot of people will.

547
00:37:01,021 --> 00:37:02,046
Speaker 0: a lot of people will.

548
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:07,649
Speaker 0: I mean I Felt the urge just to buy something for the sake of seeing how it worked and I wasn't gonna do it.

549
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:09,077
Speaker 0: But a lot of people.

550
00:37:09,137 --> 00:37:10,082
Speaker 0: they bought Wii points.

551
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,907
Speaker 0: when they bought their Wii.

552
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:11,510
Speaker 0: they go home.

553
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,465
Speaker 0: They want to spend those Wii points right away.

554
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:14,150
Speaker 0: See how it works.

555
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,250
Speaker 0: They're gonna buy a game even if they wouldn't have bought it in the store for the same amount of money.

556
00:37:18,672 --> 00:37:19,699
Speaker 0: It's a psychological thing.

557
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:20,101
Speaker 0: It works.

558
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:21,908
Speaker 0: I've seen it work on people Yep.

559
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:37,198
Speaker 0: But all that aside perhaps the most entertaining thing not even counting the games yet on the Wii is the me Mii, yep, the me is actually I but soon as I found out about it, I knew it was gonna be cool But it's it's pretty damn cool.

560
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:51,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically in Wii Sports This is the first game that uses this but in the Wii itself built in one of the channels Go to your me area and you make an avatar a it's set up to where you make it a human like avatar.

561
00:37:52,236 --> 00:38:02,108
Speaker 1: They took out anything weird or fanciful So you're very much encouraged to make it look exactly like you look and so far We've been able to make a me that looks pretty much like everyone.

562
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:08,223
Speaker 1: we know Yeah I mean Brian and Yuko and Emily and everyone all made pretty perfect spot-on me's.

563
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:10,790
Speaker 1: my me looks almost exactly like me.

564
00:38:11,254 --> 00:38:12,244
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of scary.

565
00:38:12,426 --> 00:38:21,793
Speaker 2: Yeah Anyway, so we all made me's and it was we had a lot of fun Just sitting around making me's and telling other people how to make their me's look more like them, you know And you it's.

566
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:23,016
Speaker 2: it's a pretty simple thing.

567
00:38:23,137 --> 00:38:29,381
Speaker 2: Like you choose the hair style you choose the color you choose the eyebrows style You move it around you rotate the eye.

568
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just love stuff like that.

569
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,485
Speaker 1: I don't know why but creating characters and games is really really fun for me.

570
00:38:35,505 --> 00:38:37,050
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like what was that?

571
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,939
Speaker 2: That he City of Heroes game.

572
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:51,613
Speaker 2: It was only fun for the character creation part All those Korean like build-a-princess games, yeah His Korean build-a-princess anyway Uh-huh.

573
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,800
Speaker 2: So it's a lot of fun to make a lot of me's.

574
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,554
Speaker 2: now in addition to making me's there are a few things you can Do with them.

575
00:38:57,998 --> 00:38:58,948
Speaker 2: first you can.

576
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,594
Speaker 2: What was it?

577
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,626
Speaker 1: You didn't know where you're going with that.

578
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:03,210
Speaker 0: I got it.

579
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:03,893
Speaker 1: I first off.

580
00:39:04,154 --> 00:39:07,969
Speaker 1: you can use them as your avatar in games that support it.

581
00:39:08,331 --> 00:39:08,813
Speaker 1: It's you.

582
00:39:08,834 --> 00:39:10,421
Speaker 1: so you can bring it around with you.

583
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:13,966
Speaker 1: you can save your me on your remote Yep, or just send.

584
00:39:14,006 --> 00:39:22,549
Speaker 2: yeah You can save your me on your remote that like a one we moat the actual controller can hold I think like 10 plus me's in it.

585
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:28,010
Speaker 2: So it's pretty if you got to bring just your me to your friend's house You can put it in your remote.

586
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:31,524
Speaker 2: Bring your remote to your friend's house and then unload your me and play.

587
00:39:31,825 --> 00:39:40,670
Speaker 1: so what you do in Wii Sports At least as you start the game and in any different any game you want to play within it You pick your me and then it's actually you playing the game.

588
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,867
Speaker 1: It's just the avatar in the game is the me you made.

589
00:39:43,887 --> 00:39:49,948
Speaker 1: Yep So when we're boxing it's a thing that looks exactly like me fighting a thing that looks exactly like Scott.

590
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:55,830
Speaker 2: Yep It's also fun because let's say you're doing bowling and let's say I'm bowling and rims bowling.

591
00:39:56,031 --> 00:40:03,294
Speaker 2: So those the avatars that do the bowling but sitting around the bowling alley are all the other me's that we made and a bunch Random me's.

592
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:11,083
Speaker 2: yeah, if you don't have enough me's in your me area created It just has random system means that it uses like we'd be bowling.

593
00:40:11,124 --> 00:40:14,779
Speaker 1: I see Emily talking to Harry Sada in the background.

594
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:16,830
Speaker 2: Yeah, we made a me for Harris.

595
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:19,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't know who Harris is you didn't watch Gog manga.

596
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:20,228
Speaker 2: be already like.

597
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:20,650
Speaker 2: we told you.

598
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably one of the greatest anime ever made.

599
00:40:23,217 --> 00:40:25,423
Speaker 2: Oh now it's one of the greatest anime ever made.

600
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:26,466
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd say so.

601
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:30,940
Speaker 1: Okay, so Now in addition that's all really cool.

602
00:40:31,523 --> 00:40:33,370
Speaker 1: now remember how the Wii is on the internet.

603
00:40:33,691 --> 00:40:33,852
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

604
00:40:34,395 --> 00:40:35,159
Speaker 1: I have a Wii.

605
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:37,008
Speaker 1: my friend James has a Wii.

606
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:41,410
Speaker 1: We share our Wii numbers, which are a lot like DS friend.

607
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:41,580
Speaker 1: Yes

608
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:48,676
Speaker 2: You have to go into the message board which I'm gonna talk about pretty soon and there's an address book and in the address book You can add

609
00:40:48,756 --> 00:40:49,623
Speaker 0: people by

610
00:40:49,663 --> 00:41:01,010
Speaker 2: their email addresses Which doesn't do anything yet because it doesn't let you send email or you can add people by their Wii number and to get your Wii number you just look at the front page of your address book and it tells you your Wii number.

611
00:41:01,451 --> 00:41:09,616
Speaker 2: So if I add James's Wii number to my address book and he adds my Wii number to his address book We are now connected.

612
00:41:10,238 --> 00:41:15,680
Speaker 1: now among other things my Miis Might just wander over to his Wii.

613
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:18,129
Speaker 2: Well, they won't just wander over.

614
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:22,750
Speaker 2: first You have to enable me traveling in the me parade section.

615
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:33,130
Speaker 2: Then for any Miis that you want to travel you have to set those Miis to mingle mode So you can have you know private me like Harris is a geek nights geek house exclusive.

616
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:35,458
Speaker 1: He's not allowed to go to other people's Wiis.

617
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:38,889
Speaker 2: Yep, but all the other Miis, you know that represent our.

618
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:40,834
Speaker 2: You know ourselves.

619
00:41:40,935 --> 00:41:48,220
Speaker 2: go to all our friends, you know in their me parades so that if we go to their house There's a good chance that they'll just have our Miis already there.

620
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,542
Speaker 1: Yep.

621
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,629
Speaker 1: You can also straight-up send someone a me.

622
00:41:51,312 --> 00:42:00,230
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah if you go to the message board and send someone a message you can attach a me to the message Which is like here check out this me or you know.

623
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:01,810
Speaker 2: You put a picture just you know.

624
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,787
Speaker 2: So they can see at a glance who's sending the message by looking at the me.

625
00:42:05,847 --> 00:42:06,530
Speaker 2: that's on the message.

626
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:14,781
Speaker 2: So that way even though we only have one we it's mine because I paid for it Rim can send James a message with rims me attached.

627
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,688
Speaker 2: So James knows it's a message from rim.

628
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:21,170
Speaker 2: Yep And yeah the message board area it does a few pretty cool things.

629
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:28,879
Speaker 2: The first thing it does is it gives you every day if you play your boot your Wii There will be a message telling you exactly what you did and when

630
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:32,689
Speaker 1: played Wii Sports for one hour from this time to this time

631
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:39,348
Speaker 2: Played with me's for 10 minutes played virtual console Mario Brothers for 20 minutes.

632
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,290
Speaker 1: now I see a lot of ramifications for this one.

633
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:45,930
Speaker 1: It's really fun to look back and laugh about how much time you spent playing with your Wii.

634
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,658
Speaker 1: to Parents can go and say alright Billy.

635
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Wii for eight hours today.

636
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,810
Speaker 2: This is a non editable thing.

637
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:56,988
Speaker 2: This is I haven't found a way to remove it.

638
00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:02,950
Speaker 2: I'm There might be a way to just erase messages, but I this is a permanent thing.

639
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:04,416
Speaker 2: There it is for all to see.

640
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:07,810
Speaker 2: it can be disheartening when you realize how much time you spent.

641
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:10,729
Speaker 2: It can be surprising if you spent less time than you thought.

642
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:13,590
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just pretty cool all around.

643
00:43:14,394 --> 00:43:17,327
Speaker 2: The other thing it does is you can send messages to people.

644
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:22,250
Speaker 2: now You can send a message to yourself and just like leave messages up there like using the calendar.

645
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:33,310
Speaker 2: So let's say instead of having a whiteboard on the fridge You can use this system in the me in the way To do the same thing as a refrigerator whiteboard calendar type of thing for the people in your house.

646
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,060
Speaker 2: You can also just send messages to other people.

647
00:43:36,642 --> 00:43:38,710
Speaker 2: my guys send a message to James like hey, how you doing?

648
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,397
Speaker 2: He sent me a message back like hey, what's up?

649
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:42,406
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like little.

650
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:43,350
Speaker 2: we email.

651
00:43:43,932 --> 00:43:51,129
Speaker 2: Not too not too useful right now, but maybe as more people start to make friends with each other It'll become pretty cool.

652
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:57,242
Speaker 1: Not only that but just I mean in general There's a lot of potential in the Wii that is going to be unlocked over time.

653
00:43:57,302 --> 00:44:00,010
Speaker 1: as more channels appear more services become available.

654
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:03,342
Speaker 1: The Wii is very extensible and has a lot of opportunity.

655
00:44:03,603 --> 00:44:09,715
Speaker 2: Here's an example of in create interesting use of the Message board area.

656
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:20,271
Speaker 2: I went into Wii Sports and I did the fitness workout training mode and I got like a I think my Wii Sports age was 60 and I think the best is 20.

657
00:44:20,271 --> 00:44:21,096
Speaker 2: So I did terribly.

658
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:28,630
Speaker 2: it was I hadn't been good at Wii Sports yet Anyway, and it put a log of my Wii Sports performance in the message board.

659
00:44:29,212 --> 00:44:33,488
Speaker 2: so I guess for games like DDR with diet mode might put something in there.

660
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:44,209
Speaker 2: or You know any sort of game where you're building skill over time or Games or you might want to remember how well you played it in the future or how well you did in the future.

661
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:45,274
Speaker 2: if they Come out with brain age.

662
00:44:45,334 --> 00:44:47,503
Speaker 2: We it'll totally do something like this.

663
00:44:47,544 --> 00:44:48,950
Speaker 2: I can guarantee it, you know.

664
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:54,790
Speaker 2: Maybe if you beat a game, it'll put something on the calendar so you can remember what day you beat it stuff like that.

665
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can imagine a lot of things.

666
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,570
Speaker 1: I could imagine a trophy room channel.

667
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:02,070
Speaker 1: I can imagine God we don't even get into that.

668
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,688
Speaker 1: I can imagine like a house area so they could set up where your me can live in.

669
00:45:06,492 --> 00:45:10,810
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, maybe you get Pokemon and you put them in your little little me house.

670
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,957
Speaker 2: Pokemon channel is dangerous.

671
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:14,264
Speaker 1: This game can do a lot.

672
00:45:14,304 --> 00:45:15,550
Speaker 1: this system can do a lot.

673
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:18,201
Speaker 1: We haven't even touched the games yet and we're not going to.

674
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:20,410
Speaker 1: we're gonna review the game separately in another episode.

675
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:25,430
Speaker 1: But before we end tonight, I think we'll each say one sentence about each of the game.

676
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:27,198
Speaker 2: I just want to talk about one other thing.

677
00:45:27,318 --> 00:45:29,006
Speaker 2: one other thing the mp3 playing.

678
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,095
Speaker 1: All right, right Yeah, totally forgot about that.

679
00:45:31,497 --> 00:45:31,919
Speaker 2: the.

680
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,708
Speaker 2: if you have mp3s on your SD card It is possible for the Wii to play them.

681
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,881
Speaker 2: The most interesting use of this is currently excite truck.

682
00:45:40,941 --> 00:45:41,984
Speaker 2: No other game does this.

683
00:45:42,025 --> 00:45:42,907
Speaker 2: that I know yet.

684
00:45:43,088 --> 00:45:45,577
Speaker 1: I haven't tried though I wish Madden did it god damn.

685
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:48,470
Speaker 2: Yeah, EA Sports games with their MTV crap music.

686
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:53,528
Speaker 2: But if you play excite truck, it has this standard rock music in it.

687
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:54,110
Speaker 2: It's okay.

688
00:45:54,571 --> 00:46:03,516
Speaker 2: You can tell excite truck to instead of playing that standard rock music to play mp3s from your SD card instead and That's pretty cool.

689
00:46:03,596 --> 00:46:06,510
Speaker 1: So you can play excite truck to geek nights if you really want.

690
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,400
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could totally take geek nights.

691
00:46:08,662 --> 00:46:09,989
Speaker 2: put it in your SD card.

692
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:15,229
Speaker 1: You know what I would play to a loop of that laughing insanity test from way back.

693
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,548
Speaker 1: Happen happen happen.

694
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:31,590
Speaker 1: Okay Yeah, but alright let's go through the games and then we'll call it a night so I can go to bed and hopefully sleep off this minor sickness that Has been ailing me and Scott who has been coughing constantly throughout.

695
00:46:32,092 --> 00:46:34,239
Speaker 2: Actually, I was feeling sick before now.

696
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:35,342
Speaker 2: I'm not feeling sick.

697
00:46:35,643 --> 00:46:42,990
Speaker 2: But because I'm talking so much for this episode It's starting to bother my throat and it gets scratchy and then I cough and there's a lot of mucus moving around.

698
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,310
Speaker 2: That's all that's really wrong with me right now is I got a lot of mucus in motion?

699
00:46:46,752 --> 00:46:48,925
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got to get the mucus out.

700
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:49,890
Speaker 1: I sympathize.

701
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:53,867
Speaker 1: I only bring it up because that means I have to sit here editing out as many coughs as I can.

702
00:46:53,887 --> 00:46:55,434
Speaker 1: Yeah It's alright.

703
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:56,298
Speaker 2: It's fine.

704
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, it won't be so bad.

705
00:46:57,784 --> 00:47:00,317
Speaker 1: But yeah, uh, Okay, we sports.

706
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:02,510
Speaker 1: We'll do a sentence each per game.

707
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:06,049
Speaker 1: Okay We sports is really really intuitive and really really fun.

708
00:47:06,351 --> 00:47:10,548
Speaker 2: We sports makes better use of the wiimote than any other game that I played.

709
00:47:10,589 --> 00:47:15,810
Speaker 2: yet Monkey ball Hey, I haven't played the single-player.

710
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:21,185
Speaker 2: The multiplayer is half really awesome minigames and half absolutely terrible minigames.

711
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:22,910
Speaker 1: exactly what Scott said.

712
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:25,336
Speaker 1: It was worth purchasing though.

713
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:26,581
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're in bought that one.

714
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:26,963
Speaker 1: Yes.

715
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:27,364
Speaker 1: I did.

716
00:47:27,384 --> 00:47:28,529
Speaker 2: So not a fan of monkey ball.

717
00:47:29,073 --> 00:47:34,790
Speaker 1: excite truck is Very very fun with lots of crashing.

718
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:44,029
Speaker 2: Excite truck is a very good formulaic truck driving game yet somehow it's really fun.

719
00:47:46,831 --> 00:47:48,356
Speaker 1: All right, you got trauma center didn't you?

720
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:49,077
Speaker 1: I didn't play it yet.

721
00:47:49,178 --> 00:47:56,319
Speaker 2: trauma center is DS trauma center exactly ported to the Wii Plus another trauma center game.

722
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:59,590
Speaker 2: It's like getting the DS episodes and plus a whole bunch of new episodes.

723
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:08,229
Speaker 1: I have not played trauma center awesome Zelda Twilight Princess looks like it's going to cause minor orgasms for me.

724
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:09,476
Speaker 2: I've barely.

725
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,170
Speaker 2: I played it for 10 seconds just because I don't have time.

726
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:17,970
Speaker 2: I got to really sit down with that one for an extended period of time and part of the Wii philosophy is short game playing.

727
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:20,056
Speaker 2: It's that I really haven't had time.

728
00:48:20,297 --> 00:48:22,523
Speaker 2: Yeah this weekend for sure is all the action.

729
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:23,386
Speaker 1: Definitely.

730
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:24,810
Speaker 1: Well for you, I'll be out of town.

731
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:25,675
Speaker 1: Yeah crying.

732
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,607
Speaker 1: Yeah now they have any good food.

733
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,772
Speaker 1: It's all good Alright.

734
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:34,888
Speaker 1: Madden is a typical but probably well-executed football game that I need to play more of before I can pass judgment.

735
00:48:35,268 --> 00:48:39,289
Speaker 2: if you like Football and you understand football then Madden will be fun.

736
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:45,822
Speaker 2: It makes use of the wiimote But it doesn't make use of the wiimote in a way in a good way.

737
00:48:46,063 --> 00:48:50,455
Speaker 2: It makes use of the wiimote in an average No-brain kind of way.

738
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:53,305
Speaker 1: Wow, there were a lot of semi-colons and such what you just said.

739
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:54,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's alright.

740
00:48:55,194 --> 00:48:57,309
Speaker 2: It could make better use of the wiimote than it does.

741
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:05,532
Speaker 1: Yeah It uses the wiimote more like mouse gestures in black and white then a wiimote where you throw the football and depending on how You throw it.

742
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:08,381
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly, which is probably fine.

743
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:09,766
Speaker 2: It is fine.

744
00:49:09,786 --> 00:49:10,910
Speaker 2: It just it could be better.

745
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:12,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be better.

746
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:16,470
Speaker 1: But there were a lot of DS games that didn't use the touchscreen to its full capacity.

747
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're still really good games.

748
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,103
Speaker 1: They were I mean in some.

749
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:22,150
Speaker 1: the Wii is frickin awesome.

750
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:25,009
Speaker 1: I am so incredibly pleased with this.

751
00:49:25,652 --> 00:49:27,017
Speaker 1: I think it is going to be.

752
00:49:27,037 --> 00:49:33,049
Speaker 1: I think it has a decent chance of in terms of this Console war that may or may not be actually happening.

753
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:36,890
Speaker 1: I think the Wii has a chance to come out on top not just in second place.

754
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:44,720
Speaker 2: No, I think that pretty much anyone who plays the Wii is gonna go As long as this because there's a game out there for everyone.

755
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:46,225
Speaker 2: I mean you got everything.

Speaker 2: You know, they got excite truck They got Wii Sports They got Madden.

758
00:49:56,553 --> 00:50:00,610
Speaker 2: They got all the bases covered depending on what your gaming taste is and these are the launch titles.

759

00:50:13,372 --> 00:50:22,239
Speaker 2: I mean, it's gonna be hard to find someone out there who isn't like, you know a blind Nintendo hating Sony fanboy or something who's gonna go.
