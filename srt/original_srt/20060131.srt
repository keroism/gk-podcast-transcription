1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,947
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday January 31st, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:20,389
Speaker 1: tonight We nominally talk about gaming clubs with our returning guest Emily, but we mostly just run off on a whole bunch of tangents.

3
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,407
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,471 --> 00:00:24,677
Speaker 1: So we're here and once again.

5
00:00:24,717 --> 00:00:27,348
Speaker 1: We have a guest Emily who's been on the show before.

6
00:00:27,368 --> 00:00:36,591
Speaker 2: yep Hello So I don't really have much of a thing of the day except if you want to hear about how to chop onions the right Way.

7
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:42,868
Speaker 2: I found a video about the correct way to chop onions But I figure you know that might not have a sufficient quotient of geek.

8
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:49,410
Speaker 0: well We did do a whole episode on food one time on food wasn't really so much about food, but it was supposed to be.

9
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:53,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it was funny stories about any food stories.

10
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:56,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it was just an excuse to get Adam on the show.

11
00:00:56,415 --> 00:01:01,645
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I've just you know come to the conclusion that my food skills are less than adequate.

12
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:05,309
Speaker 2: so I was like poking around online searching for the correct way to stir-fry.

13
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:14,549
Speaker 2: but Anyway instead of doing a thing of the day so much I thought I'd relate an anecdote a weird thing that happened to me yesterday.

14
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:35,005
Speaker 2: Cuz I've you know I've been back home for the last couple of weeks because you know I'm going abroad And I'm not back in school and so I just came back to New York to start to you know wrap things up And you know I had to go see a few of my teachers And you know see my roommate for the last time and everything like that.

15
00:01:35,587 --> 00:01:37,753
Speaker 2: and so I Was.

16
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:43,650
Speaker 2: it was kind of funny too because I bought my computer and then She's got a sexy little.

17
00:01:47,851 --> 00:02:00,535
Speaker 2: It's just an iBook oh, but it's so so so so wonderful, but anyway, so I The credit card cut me off because I'd never made a purchase over like $30 or something.

18
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,925
Speaker 2: and they're like whoa computer sale what.

19
00:02:03,126 --> 00:02:04,210
Speaker 2: and then they shut it off.

20
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:11,035
Speaker 2: So I had to you know after this big dramatic exit of like goodbye goodbye everyone I shan't see you for so long.

21
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:16,130
Speaker 2: I come running back upstairs like five minutes later being like I can't get in the subway.

22
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:17,118
Speaker 2: I have no money.

23
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:17,964
Speaker 2: Give me two bucks.

24
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:23,110
Speaker 1: You know I remember my credit card did that to me when I first ordered my computer when I was in high school.

25
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,261
Speaker 2: Oh, it was so bad like $3,000.

26
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:29,711
Speaker 1: They must have thought there's no way a kid in high school is $3,000.

27
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:34,730
Speaker 0: Well, I had problems where the addresses would be messed up, but I never had problems with spending too much money.

28
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:39,910
Speaker 1: Well a lot of credit cards mostly debit cards more than credit cards like almost exclusively debit cards.

29
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:46,989
Speaker 1: I'll do this if you take out too much money all at once They'll fight your account and lock it until you call them and tell them that you're not that no one stole your card.

30
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:50,110
Speaker 0: I guess it's a good thing that I have a credit card and not a debit card.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,870
Speaker 2: then I was late for my train and you know I get up to Grand Central and I'm just kind of hanging around.

32
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,081
Speaker 2: I have about half an hour until my train comes.

33
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:00,810
Speaker 2: so I'm in the you know the Great Hall.

34
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:12,210
Speaker 2: It's kind of watching the people Kind of out of the way leaning against the wall And there's this girl next to me reading a book like she's sitting on the floor a couple a couple of yards away And I'm not paying any attention.

35
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,750
Speaker 2: You know I'm just kind of watching and spacing out and got my computer.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,678
Speaker 2: And so she you know this guy in a leather jacket comes up and says something then walks away And you know not paying attention.

37
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:28,304
Speaker 2: and then a few minutes later You know he's kind of creepy looking, but there's people all around.

38
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:29,429
Speaker 2: I'm not paying any attention.

39
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:36,070
Speaker 2: and Then a few minutes later this guy comes back, and he's acting like kind of weird.

40
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:43,493
Speaker 2: He's like and he says in this like creepy hitting on a woman sort of voice like hey lady That's a nice book.

Speaker 2: and the lady's like get away from me.

43
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,677

Speaker 2: He's like trying to force a kiss on her, and I'm like oh my god.

47
00:04:03,603 --> 00:04:05,710

Speaker 2: we were kind of.

54
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,750
Speaker 2: you know one of those and you know there wasn't.

55
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,339
Speaker 2: There weren't a whole lot of people where we were.

56
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:31,244
Speaker 2: we're kind of like in a corner out of the main In place where people go, but anyway it was like what the heck This is like really really out of line here, and so I'm like what a creep.

57
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,090
Speaker 2: and so I come up.

58
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:37,323
Speaker 2: I like kind of was like girl, and I was gonna.

59
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:39,550

Speaker 2: I had like my leg all raised up like I was gonna kick him in the face And then we were gonna run away.

62
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:51,257
Speaker 2: and then The girl turns around like with this weird expression on her face And she starts laughing.

63
00:04:51,277 --> 00:04:53,670
Speaker 2: the guy turns around like utterly flabbergasted like.

64
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:57,219
Speaker 2: And then I realized I'm like oh my god.

65
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,825
Speaker 2: You guys are just fooling around.

66
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:00,812
Speaker 2: They're like yeah Yeah, we're.

67
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,397
Speaker 2: I was like oh, they're a couple.

Speaker 2: and but we were laughing so hard and she's like no seriously We we were just acting, but if he had been of her real you would have totally been my hero.

69
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,630
Speaker 2: And she's like you totally almost got your ass kicked by a girl.

70
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:23,830
Speaker 2: So we we hung out for like about five minutes And then like I went home on the train And I felt kind of good about myself because I was thinking like it turned out okay.

71
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:31,749
Speaker 2: But if he had been like a real jerk who is trying to like Be like what was that?

72
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:42,960
Speaker 2: Okay Then I would have totally been brave enough to go and stand up for that girl, and she said that yeah You totally stepped up, and that was like I'm gonna.

73
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,743
Speaker 0: Go kick you.

74
00:05:44,325 --> 00:05:47,235
Speaker 0: That's a lot like the The purse snatching story.

75
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:51,350
Speaker 2: yeah, that's what rim said you know and that's what makes me feel really good about New York.

76
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:58,910
Speaker 1: Like everybody's down on the city I mean look at this every time something bad is about to happen everyone around just kind of steps up and does the right thing.

77
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,857
Speaker 2: What's like I'm like after 9/11?

78
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:03,787
Speaker 2: it's like people really pulled together, and they'd help each other out.

79
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:09,845
Speaker 0: I was always like What just people led stereotypes, and they were scared because there was he suburbanites.

80
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,229
Speaker 0: he's always been that way.

81
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:26,870
Speaker 2: well Even in the 80s in the early 90s I mean even in just the past decade It's gotten a lot better as far as crime rates and just cleaned up a lot.

82
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,130
Speaker 2: But you know and some people have mixed emotions about like the Disney vacation and the Giuliani years or whatever.

83
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:34,719
Speaker 2: But you know it's.

84
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:36,730
Speaker 2: it's a good place to live.

85
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,510
Speaker 1: It's really I think a bright and shiny Times Square is at least a lot cooler than a porn shop filled time.

86
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean yeah, I just I just miss my three-card Monty.

87
00:06:47,793 --> 00:06:49,150
Speaker 1: That's that's a wonderful

88
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,211
Speaker 0: Yes,

89
00:06:52,592 --> 00:07:04,133
Speaker 2: well I guess I'm just coming from the angle of like you know I live in Manhattan So I can't really speak much for some of the neighborhoods like in the Bronx and stuff because some of those are still a little Iffy, but

90
00:07:04,494 --> 00:07:04,575
Speaker 0: you

91
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:06,260
Speaker 2: know New York's a good city.

92
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,728
Speaker 0: You know what I really want to learn seriously.

93
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:18,686
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean I love Baltimore, but god damn there are a lot of angry homeless people following me around Whenever I walk outside.

94
00:07:20,751 --> 00:07:21,474
Speaker 0: It's like I had.

95
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:29,783
Speaker 0: I remember I worked at a summer camp once and the other counselor was from like The worst place in all of Chicago area like the worst place, and she was like.

96
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:30,626
Speaker 0: you know.

97
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:41,002
Speaker 0: people think that you know you Suburban people think that like you go to a neighborhood Like Harlem where there's a bunch of black people all standing around in the street And they think that that's like a slum, and it's scary and dangerous.

98
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:41,062
Speaker 0: No.

99
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,348
Speaker 1: There's people in the street.

100
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:44,954
Speaker 0: Yes That's not dangerous.

101
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:46,378
Speaker 0: That's a great place to go.

102
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:56,461
Speaker 0: you know where I where I've been you know every single window has bars over it No one's out on the street and the snipers in every window You know.

103
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:04,210
Speaker 2: you gotta say though Even like you know alphabet city in the East Village and stuff that's cleaned up a lot since because my uncle used to live there.

104
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,199
Speaker 2: He was telling stories about.

105
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,681
Speaker 2: he kind of liked living in the building He was living in because it was.

106
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,696
Speaker 2: it was run by drug dealers But they had snipers on the roof.

107
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:23,129
Speaker 2: so all all other petty crime kind of cleared out and as long as you didn't mess with The drug people they'd leave you alone, and it was kind of like your building was protected by

108
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:29,670
Speaker 1: In a city of God when Lil Zay and Benny kind of cleaned up the town even though they were selling drugs.

109
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:34,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like any mafia Mafia or gang in charge.

110
00:08:34,184 --> 00:08:40,669
Speaker 0: they don't let any other Mafias or gangs come in and as long as the police don't try to come in no one really fights or kills each other.

111
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,890
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of violence It's.

112
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,930
Speaker 1: so what do you do when a cruise ship with a thousand Yakuza on it parks in your Harbor?

113
00:08:46,052 --> 00:08:46,749
Speaker 1: Dumb dumb dumb.

114
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:53,439
Speaker 1: Yeah We've had people complain about inside jokes before.

115
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,085
Speaker 1: so yes, that was an inside joke.

116
00:08:55,165 --> 00:08:56,490
Speaker 1: read a manga called sanctuary.

117
00:08:57,592 --> 00:09:00,006
Speaker 0: It's out of print, but I can get it for you if you really want to.

118
00:09:00,348 --> 00:09:02,095
Speaker 1: yeah Can I spoil it?

119
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:07,842
Speaker 0: It's like the best manga ever one of the best mangas ever.

120
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:08,043
Speaker 0: well.

121
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:09,828
Speaker 1: It's certainly it's not up there with.

122
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,182
Speaker 1: you know Cantarella?

123
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:15,177
Speaker 2: oh My god, I don't know why I've been.

124
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:20,398
Speaker 2: I read Cantarella volume 2 when we were in the anime So you did read it.

125
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did read most of it.

126
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,338
Speaker 2: That's what I was making fun of when I was drawing all those little One I remember.

127
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,050
Speaker 1: do we actually talk about Cantarella on the show?

128
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:31,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, Cantarella is awesome.

129
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:45,899
Speaker 1: Yeah in like a way that you just like want to laugh about it, but anyway in actual news The optimist keyboard which we've been nutting about for pretty much as long as we've known about Everyone has been nothing about who's seen it.

130
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's finally kind of coming out.

131
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:57,374
Speaker 0: Well, basically it's a but if you don't know it's supposed to be this keyboard where every key has a little monitor on it Made with o LEDs.

132
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:05,323
Speaker 0: so like you're playing quake instead of having ABCD or AWS D They'll actually be little arrows and instead you know each.

133
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:20,130
Speaker 0: instead of one two three four five You'll actually see like the little chain blade thing and the little pistol and the rocket launcher on your keys You know matching the icons on the screen or say you're using Photoshop or audacity or some kind of media entity type thing.

134
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:23,184
Speaker 1: Your keyboard seven letters will have you know, the zoom in button.

135
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:32,380
Speaker 0: just sitting there looking at you It makes a lot of sense because you know You only need the keyboard that you use it a lot But a lot of times the keyboard doesn't have any functionality.

136
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,479
Speaker 0: like if I'm using I don't know Photoshop Start typing in the middle of the you know picture.

137
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,382
Speaker 0: It doesn't do anything.

138
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:43,890
Speaker 0: It only does something if I'm using like the text tool.

139
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:54,510
Speaker 0: Yeah So binding all those things on the screen the buttons on the keyboard really makes it useful Considering it's a lot easier to just push a button then move the mouse click move the mouse again.

140
00:10:54,912 --> 00:11:00,261
Speaker 2: Well actually like at school a lot of the editing suites We have specialized keyboards and like.

141
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:10,038
Speaker 2: well even my final cut Express came with a bunch of peel-off stickers that you could put over your keyboard saying, you know, yeah this function This is the razor function.

142
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,250
Speaker 0: This is this eliminates all those stickers.

143
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:21,607
Speaker 1: My nasty keyboard I used for like over a decade that had those marker I'd written things all over the keyboard for like mega TF and quick - yeah.

144
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,895
Speaker 0: So anyway, they were gonna make this thing and they made a picture of it and everything they designed it But it's not out yet.

145
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,283
Speaker 0: What they did make is a little thing.

146
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:37,375
Speaker 0: That's USB and it has three buttons which have monitors on them and It's basically kind of a tech demo.

147
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:38,859
Speaker 1: slash prototype slash.

148
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,407
Speaker 1: buy this to give us money to make the real thing.

149
00:11:41,507 --> 00:11:42,510
Speaker 1: buy it to look cool.

150
00:11:43,472 --> 00:11:46,909
Speaker 0: I guess it might be useful to someone but not really useful to me.

151
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:50,690
Speaker 1: I think it should be really useful to those ricer equivalents for computers.

152
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:52,818
Speaker 1: People have the cold cathodes and everything all over.

153
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,886
Speaker 0: their PC might be useful if it was wireless.

154
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:55,850
Speaker 0: because then think about this.

155
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,776
Speaker 0: Right, you could have a little thing next like your bed and you pick it up and it would have a button For like.

156
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:14,298
Speaker 0: then on the screen It would say how many new emails you have and you could push the button to launch your email thing maybe something that reads your email out loud to you from your computer or The other button.

157
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:20,441
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, you're really stretching it Rolling in it and you push it to update the news.

158
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:22,830
Speaker 0: or you know, you could come up with some pretty good stuff.

159
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,318
Speaker 0: It has uses but nothing worth buying.

160
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,645
Speaker 1: It's low resolution and it doesn't refresh quickly.

161
00:12:27,686 --> 00:12:29,010
Speaker 1: It's basically just a tech demo.

162
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:34,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can actually see physically what this keyboard is going to be like but they are making it and selling it.

163
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:36,494
Speaker 1: So yeah, I think it's gonna be $100.

164
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,030
Speaker 1: It's kind of hard to tell from the website.

165
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:45,870
Speaker 0: $100 to three buttons really doesn't cut it because I spent less than $100 and I get a mouse and a numpad Yeah, which doubles as a calculator and a thermometer.

166
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 1: I mean I guess to me if the Optimus keyboard as the original concept was ever comes out on the market I'd pay a good 200 bucks for that thing.

167
00:12:53,901 --> 00:12:55,468
Speaker 0: I think I don't think it's gonna cause 200 bucks.

168
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:00,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I'm kind of leery of the current rate of three buttons for $100.

169
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:07,179
Speaker 0: That means a hundred and four buttons for Yeah, wow, you're real good at math.

170
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,448
Speaker 1: I like how you just came up with that figure so quickly.

171
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:19,161
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You know just out of the blue 104 divided by three That's about thirty four thirty five.

172
00:13:19,462 --> 00:13:20,647
Speaker 0: so thirty five hundred dollars.

173
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,162
Speaker 0: so You may or may not know about this.

174
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:35,016
Speaker 0: there's a thing called Star Force and Star Force is this software that comes with PC games certain PC games to prevent you from Copying and wheresing the PC games.

175
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:39,410
Speaker 1: It's basically all of all those copy protection programs that have been out in the past.

176
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:44,103
Speaker 1: The it seems to be the most effective and at the same time the most horrible.

177
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:59,280
Speaker 0: So what this does is Installs a new driver Which is kind of funny actually and it which I'll talk about in a second and the driver kind of replaces your CD-ROM IDE driver things But it doesn't work.

178
00:13:59,340 --> 00:13:59,763
Speaker 0: So great.

179
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:14,810
Speaker 0: So what ends up happening is you end up failing to read CDs and your IDE drivers and modules start failing and Windows like reverts all the way back to 16-bit mode at which point things just don't work.

180
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:25,883
Speaker 0: And there have even been numerous reports of like Hardware destroying like your DVD roms will just die Because this thing uses the shitty drivers that just screw everything up.

181
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:31,575
Speaker 1: and before you call shenanigans on that I'd like to note that it is fairly Trivial.

182
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,940
Speaker 1: it's not so trivial anymore.

183
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:33,663
Speaker 1: But back in the day.

184
00:14:33,704 --> 00:14:40,549
Speaker 1: It was fairly trivial to ruin CD-Rs and DVD readers and monitors by giving them improper input.

185
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,984
Speaker 1: You take an old monitor and give it certain frequencies.

186
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,450
Speaker 1: it'll just destroy itself physically.

187
00:14:47,073 --> 00:14:50,428
Speaker 0: So you basically have a thing designed to prevent people from copying CDs.

188
00:14:51,571 --> 00:15:11,277
Speaker 0: that in effect destroys many DVD roms and ruins computers and makes computers crash because it's unstable and poorly written and a lot of PC game people are using this and There's a new movement to boycott any game that uses star force and a lot of game companies are stopping the use of it But it's still out there.

189
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:12,261
Speaker 1: I mean, it's.

190
00:15:12,442 --> 00:15:16,958
Speaker 1: I mean if any of you read penny arcade Tycho has been railing about it fairly often lately.

191
00:15:17,098 --> 00:15:21,230
Speaker 2: So what's an example of a game that all right seven sins a neato?

192
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,134
Speaker 1: Africa core versus desert.

193
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:27,004
Speaker 1: rats beyond divinity blitzkrieg rolling thunder breed chaos.

194
00:15:27,024 --> 00:15:28,087
Speaker 0: You don't have to read the whole list.

195
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,070
Speaker 1: code name outbreak.

196
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:31,801
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in the idea that lots of them.

197
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,504
Speaker 1: All right, wait a minute.

198
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:38,322
Speaker 1: It's in the Garfield game Destroyed by Garfield.

199
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,129
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

200
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:44,177
Speaker 0: Point is is Today or the other day boing.

201
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:48,713
Speaker 0: boing made a story about Star Force and they said yeah, it's it's malware Whatever.

202
00:15:49,255 --> 00:15:58,250
Speaker 0: So the guy in charge of Star Force is his Russian guy I think or Eastern European at the least sent them an email that was like, oh I will sue you.

203
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,474
Speaker 0: You called it malware.

204
00:15:59,594 --> 00:16:00,758
Speaker 0: I called the FBI on you.

205
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:03,225
Speaker 0: Yeah now obviously he's just lying.

206
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:04,650
Speaker 1: That's the classic sign.

207
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,864
Speaker 1: I mean sometimes you'll get a real cease-and-desist order from someone.

208
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,049
Speaker 0: it looks like it's from a lawyer.

209
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:15,370
Speaker 0: Well, it has lawyerly talk and not the kind of lawyerly talk in a Nigerian scam a real lawyerly talk.

210
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:28,721
Speaker 1: But I guess rule number one because Jack Thompson does this a lot too Is that if you get any sort of legal threat like that and it ever includes something along the lines of I called the police Or I called the FBI or I called the Secret Service.

211
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,130
Speaker 1: You can safely ignore it because it's bullshit.

212
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,228
Speaker 0: yeah, it's someone just trying to scare you and being stupid and evil.

213
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:42,418
Speaker 0: and If it's a real cease-and-desist, it'll be very lawyerly and very official and Then you should actually be scared of that.

214
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:52,289
Speaker 1: because that means you know, unless there's something awful They've received hundreds of perfectly legitimate cease-and-desist that they've not only ignored but posted on the website and mocked publicly.

215
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:57,090
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but that the point is is that if it's something like this, I mean you can go read this thing online.

216
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:57,921
Speaker 0: it's just hilarious.

217
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:09,050
Speaker 0: and Apparently this guy has sent similar things to all kinds of people who say that star force is bad and Everyone's making fun of this guy now because he's such an idiot

218
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:15,289
Speaker 2: Like you can't cover up bad information by just you know, telling people not to talk about

219
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:15,369
Speaker 0: it.

220
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,597
Speaker 0: He's not telling people not to talk about it.

221
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,542
Speaker 0: He's scaring people into not talking about it.

222
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:24,087
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, he's telling people not to talk about it Because if people do talk about it.

223
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:31,952
Speaker 1: Maybe the companies that buy his terrible program will hear about this and realize that oh one it doesn't work - it actually harms my Customers.

224
00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:34,160
Speaker 1: and three the guy who makes it's kind of a nut job.

225
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:36,690
Speaker 0: They should sue the guy who makes it like for real.

226
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:37,774
Speaker 0: You know, it's.

227
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,802
Speaker 0: it's like sometimes they sue people and it's stupid.

228
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,670
Speaker 0: This guy should get totally screwed.

229
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:50,267
Speaker 1: I mean I guess for anyone who's looking at for perspective on this a lot of people who are in the know Consider it as bad as if not worse than the Sony rootkit.

230
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,209
Speaker 1: Yeah So use that as a nice.

231
00:17:53,853 --> 00:18:00,658
Speaker 0: The sunny rootkit would screw you over but it wouldn't destroy your DVD burner Yeah, or even you're just plain old CD-ROM or whatever.

232
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,723
Speaker 2: you had nasty stuff on your.

233
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:11,288
Speaker 1: I'm still shopping around for a computer and I Found pretty much I can buy a super awesome dual layer DVD burner of awesome speed for like 40 bucks.

234
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:21,723
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That's because you know This blu-ray hdvd thing is putting down the prices of the normal burners Which is fine because I have no desire for blu-ray or hdvd whatsoever.

235
00:18:22,004 --> 00:18:35,410
Speaker 2: That's why I totally got the Lower end iBook though because basically the only difference was that the 14-inch had the combo drive And that's just like a DVD burner and I'm like, it's not worth.

236
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,835
Speaker 2: Okay, but I love.

237
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,963
Speaker 2: my new computer opened it last night.

238
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:46,650
Speaker 2: I was like jumping around the room.

239
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I was trying to make my computer and I keep looking like.

240
00:18:50,282 --> 00:18:53,114
Speaker 1: I built it today in a new egg and it was About.

241
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,390
Speaker 1: it should have been about five hundred dollars total.

242
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:04,223
Speaker 1: But I fell into the trap that all computer geeks fall into when they're designing a computer online Where you know Rams not that expensive on four gigs.

243
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:04,664
Speaker 1: Why not?

244
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:05,809
Speaker 0: You don't need four gigs.

245
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,425
Speaker 1: I know I ended up going with two gigs and they're like.

246
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:08,988
Speaker 0: two is fine.

247
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,136
Speaker 1: Three hard drives raid five.

248
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:12,520
Speaker 1: I'll get the claw hammer.

249
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,684
Speaker 1: It's not that much more.

250
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:15,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is actually.

251
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:15,690
Speaker 1: no, it's not.

252
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:20,290
Speaker 2: So what would you use all that RAM for other than like podcast nothing even if he had four.

253
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,290
Speaker 1: I'll point out that I was not literally saying I'll get four gigs.

254
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:35,890
Speaker 1: it was just like it was an example of a computer geek sitting down and Just slowly expanding the scope of what they wanted just because they're not really looking at the price as much as they should.

255
00:19:36,272 --> 00:19:37,015
Speaker 2: I need RAM.

256
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:43,627
Speaker 2: I'm the one of everybody who needs RAM because I do all the 3d I get exactly what I need and no more.

257
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:48,081
Speaker 1: I gotta say PC3200 RAM is about 80 bucks.

258
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:48,825
Speaker 1: It's almost nothing.

259
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:53,193
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, 80 bucks times four There's.

260
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,819
Speaker 0: three hundred and twenty dollars is quite a bit.

261
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,686
Speaker 0: You can buy almost a whole computer for that.

262
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:59,927
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm here I'm be a skin-flint Yankee.

263
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:09,024
Speaker 1: The main thing that got me was that the claw hammer is only $80 more than the lowest lowest end Athlon that'll fit in.

264
00:20:09,144 --> 00:20:10,930
Speaker 0: you know, there's is quite a bit in terms of CPUs.

265
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,621
Speaker 0: There's some CPUs that can be had for $80.

266
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:16,257
Speaker 0: Yeah So that's quite a jump.

267
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:20,571
Speaker 0: I'm you I usually go up as long as the jumps are in the 10 to $20.

268
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:21,738
Speaker 0: You know less than 20 bucks.

269
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,629
Speaker 0: I'll keep going higher on the CPUs.

270
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:38,085
Speaker 1: But as soon as there's a jump more than $20 see that's what it was I started at the lowest end CPU that'll fit in my computer and every jump up was 10 to $20 Until the claw hammer that I've settled upon the next chip up was $300.

271
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:38,185
Speaker 1: Yeah.

272
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:40,351
Speaker 0: Yeah It's.

273
00:20:40,412 --> 00:20:45,654
Speaker 0: it's sort of like this graph where it goes up a little bit a little bit a little bit and then it goes crazy Like the next job.

274
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:54,270
Speaker 0: It's like up by up by a dollar up by $2 up by $5 up by $10 You know and each next chip is only a couple dollars more than the last.

275
00:20:54,691 --> 00:21:01,769
Speaker 0: But then you look at it from beginning to end and you're like, oh all those little $2 is add up to like 50 bucks But that's okay.

276
00:21:02,353 --> 00:21:14,240
Speaker 0: but then eventually you see the next chip is like $50 more than the previous one and you got to say alright, it's not $50 faster than the previous one But it is $50 more.

277
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,166
Speaker 0: so I'm not gonna get it.

278
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:21,894
Speaker 1: though honestly, what I might do is I'll buy the lowest end chip that'll fit in that socket and Then a year from now.

279
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:34,778
Speaker 1: I'll put the fastest chip that'll fit in that socket, you know that strategy Works in theory, but it not really because what happens what ends up happening is well keep in mind with computers for me I'm pretty much on a six-year upgrade scale.

280
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:35,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

281
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:38,310
Speaker 0: But you know, what happens is that chip?

282
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,309
Speaker 0: That's the slowest one that goes in the socket will be too slow for anything you do.

283
00:21:42,732 --> 00:21:45,550
Speaker 1: It's more than three times faster than my current chip.

284
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:51,590
Speaker 0: You have no idea this laptop here that I got from work as a crazy fast CPU, right?

285
00:21:52,131 --> 00:21:53,057
Speaker 0: It is the old.

286
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:55,310
Speaker 0: the CPU is the only bottleneck for me on this thing.

287
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,150
Speaker 0: It is constantly at a hundred percent is pissing me off and it basically makes it completely useless.

288
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,841
Speaker 1: Well, see for me currently my bottleneck is actually RAM and hard drive.

289
00:22:04,543 --> 00:22:06,448
Speaker 0: you still you're gonna have a CPU bottleneck.

290
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:10,040
Speaker 1: Trust me Only for encoding mp3 is most of what I do.

291
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,385
Speaker 1: It's just very hard drive intensive.

292
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:12,470
Speaker 1: That's why I'm getting the raid box.

293
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,316
Speaker 0: It's more CPU intensive than you think.

294
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:18,030
Speaker 0: you just don't realize because right now your CPU is getting maxed out.

295
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,516
Speaker 1: No, it's not not even close.

296
00:22:19,857 --> 00:22:25,443
Speaker 1: Yeah, no when I do most of my audio filtering on the podcast My CPU sits around 40% and my hard drive is going.

297
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:26,468
Speaker 1: chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga.

298
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:34,111
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you know what if your hard drive wasn't going chugga chugga chugga and you had an s8 a drive your CPU would be Going.

299
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,476
Speaker 0: oh, I can't do anything.

300
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:42,483
Speaker 1: You know what it doesn't because the cheapest chip that goes into my the motherboard I'm looking at is probably gonna be perfectly adequate for at least a couple years.

301
00:22:42,624 --> 00:22:43,347
Speaker 0: Yeah, what chip?

302
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:44,110
Speaker 0: what chip is it?

303
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,033
Speaker 1: It's uh, Athlon 64 3200.

304
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,776
Speaker 0: that's not really the.

305
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:51,469
Speaker 1: it's not the cheapest one that'll go in but it's it's very cheap.

306
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:53,357
Speaker 0: Oh, so it's not the cheapest one.

307
00:22:53,377 --> 00:22:57,475
Speaker 1: Well the cheapest one that'll go in they don't sell on Newegg anymore Really?

308
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least I didn't see it.

309
00:22:58,603 --> 00:23:02,320
Speaker 1: I Sorted by price and that was the cheapest one that was listed in stock.

310
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:07,017
Speaker 0: I would still go look at some like Comparisons of chips to make sure.

311
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:10,711
Speaker 0: because yeah, I did and I saw because it's an athlete, you know, cuz yeah I did.

312
00:23:10,772 --> 00:23:15,589
Speaker 1: I look at all the different cores and I looked at all the benchmarks and this isn't a computer show So I didn't really want to get into it.

313
00:23:15,951 --> 00:23:22,410
Speaker 1: But they're all very similar and the differences in the benchmarks are almost nothing until I get well beyond what I'm willing to spend.

314
00:23:23,091 --> 00:23:23,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that's the thing.

315
00:23:24,314 --> 00:23:29,109
Speaker 0: it I always mess that up recently when I look at benchmarks is because the graph doesn't.

316
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:34,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, you look like a giant jump in the graph and then you looked at the scale is in like two hundredths of a second.

317
00:23:35,032 --> 00:23:39,767
Speaker 0: Well, no, usually what I have been is I look at the graph and it's a tiny jump and then I look closer and it's like a hundred.

318
00:23:40,731 --> 00:23:46,793
Speaker 1: Now I was looking and there's really very little difference in the range of chips that I'm willing to pay money for in terms of Performance.

319
00:23:47,597 --> 00:23:49,064
Speaker 1: if I jump beyond the range, I'm willing to pay.

320
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:53,850
Speaker 1: there's a crazy jump If I get the at like the Athlon FX whatever but I don't need that.

321
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,678
Speaker 0: Really it's like a thousand dollar processing.

322
00:23:59,220 --> 00:23:59,822
Speaker 0: Yeah, screw that.

323
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:01,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's not get into it.

324
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,530
Speaker 1: cuz you know This is happy get whatever you want.

325
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:12,550
Speaker 0: But I'm just telling you getting the plan of getting the slowest one and then upgrading to the fastest one doesn't usually work because the fastest one stays crazy expensive.

326
00:24:12,893 --> 00:24:23,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it worked for me because honestly the PC I got now has pretty much one of the slowest chips that'll fit in it and I could have bought for very little money and extremely the fastest chip that'll go into this motherboard.

327
00:24:24,113 --> 00:24:27,330
Speaker 1: And the only reason I didn't is because this computer is so old that it's falling apart.

328
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:33,310
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know things like this once I get my new computer I'm probably gonna buy whatever Athlon will fit in this computer when I make a server.

329
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,475
Speaker 0: I thought about doing that too.

330
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:40,856
Speaker 0: I can put the Athlon XP 3200 in my computer, but It's still out years later.

331
00:24:40,876 --> 00:24:42,262
Speaker 0: There's like a two or three year old computer.

332
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:44,250
Speaker 0: that thing is still two or three hundred dollars.

333
00:24:44,671 --> 00:24:49,207
Speaker 1: It hasn't gone down in price at all really because the the fast ones that'll go into my computer are 50 60 bucks.

334
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:52,541
Speaker 0: Well, that's because your computer is so old.

335
00:24:52,561 --> 00:24:53,586
Speaker 1: My computer is six years old.

336
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,470
Speaker 1: That's about my upgrade.

337
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,358
Speaker 0: My computer is two or three years old.

338
00:24:56,419 --> 00:24:59,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I said, I'm using your original plan.

339
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,384
Speaker 0: You said oh, I'll buy the slowest one and then a year later.

340
00:25:01,405 --> 00:25:02,290
Speaker 0: I'll upgrade to the fast.

341
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:03,056
Speaker 1: No, I was.

342
00:25:03,499 --> 00:25:11,093
Speaker 0: my plan wasn't specifically that I said a year or a year or two that no you need to literally wait six years And you know what.

343
00:25:11,313 --> 00:25:14,849
Speaker 0: then I will but you're not gonna live with that slow processor that whole time.

344
00:25:17,335 --> 00:25:25,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, barely you ever.

345
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:30,442
Speaker 0: You know out and about the town or maybe drive down a highway or something.

346
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,144
Speaker 0: You got a pee.

347
00:25:31,566 --> 00:25:32,950
Speaker 0: There's no convenient bathrooms.

348
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:36,320
Speaker 0: There's a nasty bathroom or whatever and you resort to.

349
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,330
Speaker 0: you know, peeing in the woods peeing in an alley something like that.

350
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:43,622
Speaker 0: Well some guy developed what I think is a pretty awesome solution.

351
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:45,809
Speaker 0: It's called the pee tree.

352
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:52,030
Speaker 0: It's basically this giant porcelain tree and you pee on the tree.

353
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,309
Speaker 1: That's just fantastic.

354
00:25:54,813 --> 00:26:02,026
Speaker 0: And the way the tree is made because the material you know The the liquid just kind of go flows down the tree nicely without getting all over the see.

355
00:26:02,046 --> 00:26:06,789
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the picture and one I imagine drunk guys just peeing on people across from them instead of peeing on the tree.

356
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:11,270
Speaker 0: Well, if you're drunk, but you know, come on, even drunk guys can hit the toilet most of the time.

357
00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:13,665
Speaker 0: No, they can't most of the time.

358
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:13,725
Speaker 0: no.

359
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,730
Speaker 0: But anyway the tree, you know.

360
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:19,066
Speaker 0: but the other thing is that the trees are big enough that won't happen.

361
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:23,129
Speaker 0: and the tree has a little trough at the bottom of it where the P collects and then goes in the sewer.

362
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:30,130
Speaker 0: and I think it's pretty good because a lot of other countries they have like these public urinals just like in the street like little booths.

363
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:33,909
Speaker 0: You just go in and pee and it's sometimes it's really hard to pee in this country.

364
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,192
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's.

365
00:26:35,313 --> 00:26:40,450
Speaker 1: it's like every business is afraid of having people who aren't gonna spend money coming in and using their bathroom.

366
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,879
Speaker 0: I don't know why you're afraid of that.

367
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,068
Speaker 1: They're afraid that everyone's just gonna vandalize them.

368
00:26:45,369 --> 00:26:53,950
Speaker 2: Yeah Well, it is kind of the case that people And it's also to keep like the bathrooms cleaner, I guess, you know.

369
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,781
Speaker 2: So people don't just go in and use them as a public toilet.

370
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:58,629
Speaker 2: It's like keeps the number of people down.

371
00:26:59,271 --> 00:27:04,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, well plus if I mean if there were public pay toilets you can bet there'd be a hobo who finds a dollar and lives In it.

372
00:27:05,078 --> 00:27:06,910
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that is a problem with the hobos.

373
00:27:07,031 --> 00:27:08,900
Speaker 0: But come on, not every there are many.

374
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:10,870
Speaker 0: most of the country is a non hobo area.

375
00:27:11,152 --> 00:27:13,989
Speaker 0: They're only hobos in like hobo towns, you know.

376
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:21,890
Speaker 1: So I got to say even a lot of times now I think about it when I visit New York City like to visit you and I Got a pee and there's nowhere to pee unless I go and pay for something somewhere

377
00:27:22,071 --> 00:27:26,129
Speaker 2: They used to have like public pay toilets like deposit a quarter and you can

378
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:26,270
Speaker 0: pee.

379
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,374
Speaker 0: They had that though I would totally like.

380
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:33,529
Speaker 0: I wouldn't live in it like a homeless guy but I'd find a way to get in and hack the.

381
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,769
Speaker 0: you Know the lock or whatever it is.

382
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:45,670
Speaker 2: I would pee for free, you know Toilet seat is locked and then you then you put the the little coin in and it opens.

383
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,701
Speaker 1: Wow, you know I can see so many problems with that.

384
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,589
Speaker 1: I mean, alright, so you gotta see.

385
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,098
Speaker 1: wait You got to put a quarter in to open it right?

386
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:53,306
Speaker 1: You just pee on it.

387
00:27:53,608 --> 00:27:56,675
Speaker 2: Yeah People probably did.

388
00:27:56,876 --> 00:28:02,760
Speaker 0: I had an idea once that we should make like at the rest stops There would be like a free bathroom and a pay bathroom.

389
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:06,695
Speaker 1: So people who were like, oh, you know this again Yeah, are you this to death?

390
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:07,578
Speaker 1: It's infeasible.

391
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:08,802
Speaker 1: I know give it up.

392
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:09,364
Speaker 0: Give it up.

393
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:12,975
Speaker 0: It's good in in in concept Possible to execute.

394
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,048
Speaker 1: Alright, he had this idea that you could somehow have like a

395
00:28:16,108 --> 00:28:16,530
Speaker 0: premium

396
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,102
Speaker 1: Toilet stall in a rest stops that you have to pay to get into

397
00:28:20,503 --> 00:28:28,553
Speaker 0: so that people who were all like Fussy would pay extra and we basically take all their money because they would spend it to go in the nice toilet That was clean.

398
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:31,950
Speaker 2: What did have like couches like a perfume?

399
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,787
Speaker 0: Stall yeah, so like all the other ones would be like unflushed or clogged and one that you had to.

400
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:48,478
Speaker 1: well, no Yeah, Scott, I remember very specifically that you're involved Extortion like she said actually making the other bad.

401
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:52,110
Speaker 1: No, never my idea when I was in fact the primary.

402
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,833
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

403
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:54,198
Speaker 0: you're just making shit up now.

404
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:57,430
Speaker 1: We've we've argued this to death to death.

405
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:04,213
Speaker 0: The only thing that was a extortion e was the fact that we would clean the the other one more frequent the pay one more Frequently.

406
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:08,145
Speaker 1: then yeah, wasn't your other idea that you have to pay to get out to know?

407
00:29:10,594 --> 00:29:11,708
Speaker 0: But that would be a good idea.

408
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:18,626
Speaker 2: You know, it would only work if it was like, you know a separate premium like lounge like.

409
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:19,989
Speaker 2: have you ever been in?

410
00:29:21,431 --> 00:29:23,849
Speaker 2: the bathrooms at like the Eastman theater.

411
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:25,777
Speaker 1: Actually, you know what?

412
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:27,330
Speaker 1: I've never had to pee at the Eastman theater.

413
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,770
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the Eastman theater has like these chandelier bathrooms And it's like it looks like a restroom with couches and stuff like that.

414
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,010
Speaker 1: Was there an attendant the guy who stands there in hand you a towel?

415
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,673
Speaker 2: No, but you know close.

416
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:41,298
Speaker 0: I've been to fancy bathrooms like that.

417
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:43,265
Speaker 0: Radio City Music Hall has fancy bathrooms.

418
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:44,208
Speaker 0: Actually.

419
00:29:44,308 --> 00:29:46,602
Speaker 2: Yeah, so You know.

420
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:48,896
Speaker 1: So I could see.

421
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:53,965
Speaker 0: so we go to a rest stop and there's a. there's a ballroom Bathroom next to the normal public toilet.

422
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:58,154
Speaker 2: Yeah You could do.

423
00:29:58,234 --> 00:29:59,200
Speaker 2: it is what I'm saying.

424
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you need what I think you need a person.

425
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:11,490
Speaker 1: There's no mechanical device that can allow a person into a place to pee Especially a guy and yet not allow them to pee without paying because they could just pee on the thing that takes their money.

426
00:30:27,571 --> 00:30:35,055
Speaker 1: All the vending machines would really stay Apparently Used to back in the day.

427
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:41,407
Speaker 1: if you poured salt water into most vending machines, they just give you free stuff really It's just totally break them in.

428
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:53,890
Speaker 1: I know they fixed this problem recently or recently like I think of ten years ago Because most vending machines have a little sign inside if you look that says it's basically warning salt water will not give free food.

429
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,158
Speaker 0: I've never seen that in my life.

430
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:57,585
Speaker 1: I've seen signs like that everywhere.

431
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,430
Speaker 0: I'm sure that's not a snow.

432
00:30:59,251 --> 00:31:04,287
Speaker 1: I've seen them personally made not my cousin's brother's sister's dog, but I've never ever seen that.

433
00:31:04,347 --> 00:31:09,604
Speaker 2: yet to point it out to me I've seen you know funny pictures that are like do not push the venue.

434
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:13,661
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see don't put your hand Slot because it'll get stuck.

435
00:31:14,084 --> 00:31:14,969
Speaker 0: That's that's a good one.

436
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:18,466
Speaker 1: I saw like the one with like the crushed stick figure under a knockover coke machine.

437
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:19,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a great one.

438
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,641
Speaker 0: Don't try to push it over.

439
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:21,709
Speaker 0: It'll fall down and kill you.

440
00:31:24,892 --> 00:31:28,447
Speaker 1: But yeah pee is mostly salt and uric acid and water.

441
00:31:28,467 --> 00:31:30,476
Speaker 2: so Wet is like pee.

442
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,685
Speaker 2: you pee out your armpits every day.

443
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:33,970
Speaker 1: that explains.

444
00:31:35,712 --> 00:31:41,508
Speaker 0: Anyway, the tea tree is cool, and I hope someone installs a pea tree somewhere for me to pee on.

445
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:45,945
Speaker 1: so This doesn't look like pea tree from the land before time does it?

446
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:50,942
Speaker 0: no It's a giant white piece of ceramic not a course pterodactyl.

447
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:51,864
Speaker 1: who likes to eat cherries.

448
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,730
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a porcelain pterodactyl.

449
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:56,762
Speaker 1: And my other concern is this is great for men.

450
00:31:57,223 --> 00:31:58,529
Speaker 1: What about a woman who has to pee?

451
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,719
Speaker 0: Women don't seem to have a problem finding places to be.

452
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:02,040
Speaker 0: do they?

453
00:32:02,884 --> 00:32:04,290
Speaker 1: are you serious Scott?

454
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,016
Speaker 2: Have you ever seen the line?

455
00:32:06,096 --> 00:32:10,931
Speaker 2: That's like for all you the Joke.

456
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:12,920
Speaker 0: not everyone in that line is there to pee.

457
00:32:12,961 --> 00:32:14,909
Speaker 0: women go to the bathroom to do all kinds of other stuff.

458
00:32:15,493 --> 00:32:18,029
Speaker 0: Oh my god, no it takes longer.

459
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:26,710
Speaker 0: See here we are going on a rant here because you know Scott has just exceeded his quotient of sexism.

460
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,606
Speaker 2: For all you listeners who are not aware Scott is the king of the sexist joke.

461
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:36,385
Speaker 2: like I was nice I stayed home today because you know I figured going in the city.

462
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:37,550
Speaker 2: I had other stuff to do.

463
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:43,430
Speaker 2: I wanted to play with my new computer, and so I stayed at the house, and you know I looked in the fridge.

464
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:44,796
Speaker 2: There's you know all the stuff.

465
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,590
Speaker 2: I'm like maybe I'll make dinner, so I cook and he comes in the door.

466
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,677
Speaker 2: He's like yeah, that's the way it should be.

467
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:56,193
Speaker 2: you know the woman made us, but not what's sadder is even So easy?

468
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:56,976
Speaker 2: no, it's.

469
00:32:57,176 --> 00:33:05,264
Speaker 2: it's like well as easy as it may be it's still like Grotesquely, you know you're like a relic from the 1950s.

470
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:17,962
Speaker 1: Actually Think the operative thing here is that even when Emily's not here, and I have dinner ready, and he comes home He that he says the same thing to me.

471
00:33:18,465 --> 00:33:22,347
Speaker 2: Yeah We all know Scott's the wife in the relationship.

472
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:25,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah What the Necco?

473
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:25,883
Speaker 1: they call it now?

474
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,029
Speaker 2: He is the okay?

475
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, but actually there's a funny anecdote related to that because RIT has a very.

476
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:34,658
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not.

477
00:33:34,678 --> 00:33:36,787
Speaker 0: I think we sold this one the jeopardy.

478
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:38,159
Speaker 0: the jeopardy I think we told that.

479
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:38,989
Speaker 0: I don't think we told this.

480
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:41,457
Speaker 1: Well tell it anyway because we might.

481
00:33:41,758 --> 00:33:49,009
Speaker 1: I think we told it on one of the unaired lost episodes of geek nights Maybe but basically the the feminist group at RIT.

482
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:53,945
Speaker 1: They are a little bit beyond what I would consider rational feminism.

483
00:33:54,286 --> 00:34:04,810
Speaker 0: I think it's just because Yes, it's because the people who have a full-time job of working for the women-centered RIT are a little whoa Yeah, and they're all men too who run it.

484
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:05,593
Speaker 1: it's kind of weird.

485
00:34:05,613 --> 00:34:11,253
Speaker 1: a couple of them that like all the heads of it are men and the advisor is a man and He's the biggest.

486
00:34:11,514 --> 00:34:13,822
Speaker 1: I mean I've met some simple dicks in my life.

487
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:16,553
Speaker 1: This guy is the most horrible dick I've ever met.

488
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:20,090
Speaker 1: he was just a giant jerk every time I ever spoke to this person.

489
00:34:20,713 --> 00:34:38,367
Speaker 1: it was the most adversarial relationship I've ever had with anyone, but We just we noticed that this group was doing a women's history month jeopardy, and you could sign up teams and compete on it and We decided that we were going to do something hilarious and by hilarious.

490
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:39,070
Speaker 1: I mean offensive.

491
00:34:40,152 --> 00:34:43,350
Speaker 1: We were gonna go and we came up with this kind of like oh, what if we did this?

492
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:50,656
Speaker 1: Oh, what if we did this and we just stand there with this big grins on our faces and no matter what the question was One of the answer was whatever.

493
00:34:50,676 --> 00:34:52,283
Speaker 1: the answer was yeah, because it's jeopardy.

494
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:53,609
Speaker 1: see I would have lost right there.

495
00:34:54,251 --> 00:35:02,890
Speaker 1: Something like Pete would just ring in and say back in the kitchen To which you know obviously isn't the answer and then I would ring in and say where she belongs.

496
00:35:03,514 --> 00:35:11,810
Speaker 1: And we wondered how many times we could do this before they just kicked us out And and then we talked ourselves into actually doing it like let's actually do it.

497
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:14,749
Speaker 0: And then you realize that the jeopardy was over like an hour ago.

498
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:17,590
Speaker 1: So we spent an hour coming up with a stupid idea.

499
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:23,088
Speaker 1: Then we spent another like 20 minutes actually working up the courage to go out and I was ready to do it.

500
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:23,790
Speaker 1: that offense.

501
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:29,763
Speaker 1: I just needed a team and then we were completely shot down by the fact that we missed it because we spent so much time Talking about it.

502
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:44,090
Speaker 0: It would have been funny no, but seriously like if I tell a joke like you know a joke about maybe punch out in bicycles It's not because I'm racist or I actually think that people have a different skin or something.

503
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:50,335
Speaker 2: The thing is though a lot of times you you have misinformation About women.

504
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:53,794
Speaker 2: you say these things that even if they're not a joke a lot of times You're not joking.

505
00:35:54,156 --> 00:35:55,906
Speaker 2: you just say these really obscure things.

506
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,636
Speaker 2: You're like Why would you think women do that?

507
00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,378
Speaker 2: or why would you?

508
00:35:59,479 --> 00:36:03,029
Speaker 2: it's like just intense stereotype like why?

509
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:03,089
Speaker 0: oh?

510
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:05,780
Speaker 2: God, let's let's see you're so alright.

511
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,330
Speaker 1: What are women do in the bathroom Scott?

512
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,629
Speaker 0: Put on makeup, and they look in the mirror.

513
00:36:10,452 --> 00:36:12,437
Speaker 2: Women take so long in the bathroom is one.

514
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:19,059
Speaker 2: men have more places to go because they have urinals - it takes women longer because they Have to take off their pants and sit down.

515
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,269
Speaker 2: then you know go through this whole thing.

516
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:23,888
Speaker 2: Biological difference.

517
00:36:24,731 --> 00:36:26,983
Speaker 1: Once I was at a band event and we're all like.

518
00:36:27,023 --> 00:36:29,254
Speaker 1: we had eight buses full of kids And we all had to pee.

519
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:34,800
Speaker 1: so we stopped at this rest stop and the girls all lined up And there's really no way to speed up what they were doing.

520
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:36,265
Speaker 1: and the men we all had to go.

521
00:36:36,305 --> 00:36:43,422
Speaker 1: so bad that we used every urinal yeah, and the sinks and People took turns at the sink, but how are they?

522
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:44,950
Speaker 0: there are more urinals than toilets?

523
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,578
Speaker 0: Why don't these urinals take less space?

524
00:36:46,659 --> 00:36:48,690
Speaker 0: Why don't they just make the women's bathroom bigger?

525
00:36:48,978 --> 00:36:49,329
Speaker 1: You know what?

526
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:53,917
Speaker 2: Actually there were some things that they were saying.

527
00:36:53,977 --> 00:37:02,438
Speaker 2: businesses are trying to go back in and increase the floor space of you know per foot to Versus the male's.

528
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:05,210
Speaker 1: yeah, actually I saw an article on FARC about that not too long ago.

529
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:14,009
Speaker 1: They were talking about how the rules originally were that men's and women's bathroom equal square footage And then this much square footage of bathroom per square footage of occupied space.

530
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:18,950
Speaker 2: And here's here's a good example that this was the time that you made me so mad on the train.

531
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:23,909
Speaker 2: You almost made me like, you know hit you like I hit you in the knee or something like that.

532
00:37:25,092 --> 00:37:28,170
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was our big train fight and people were like looking at us.

533
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,964
Speaker 2: But the whole yeah, cuz boys play with Barbie doll or?

534
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,550
Speaker 2: no, that was not the way it went.

535
00:37:33,892 --> 00:37:39,318
Speaker 2: It was boys play with video games and girls play with Barbie dolls And that's why there are no girls in the sciences.

536
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:40,040
Speaker 0: video games.

537
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:41,987
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I said.

538
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:47,077
Speaker 0: and you said oh no Matchbox cars not Barbie doll.

539
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,662
Speaker 2: No video games.

540
00:37:48,863 --> 00:37:50,027
Speaker 0: and I didn't say video games.

541
00:37:50,047 --> 00:37:51,010
Speaker 0: There are girly video games.

542
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,148
Speaker 2: No, he's trying to rationalize it.

543
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:55,733
Speaker 2: We were on the train.

544
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:58,741
Speaker 2: He was just set on this thing.

545
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,487
Speaker 1: All right, Scott what Barbie horse adventure?

546
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:08,750
Speaker 1: Yeah Scott that most of the girls we know are quite hip to gaming.

547
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:10,902
Speaker 0: Those are the girls we know that are like old.

548
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:17,073
Speaker 1: and talking about little kids here When I was a little kid all my actually when I was in first grade I it was.

549
00:38:17,515 --> 00:38:20,606
Speaker 1: she was my girlfriend and I. you could see me make the quotes.

550
00:38:20,646 --> 00:38:21,428
Speaker 1: cuz we were just friends.

551
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:22,152
Speaker 1: cuz I was a Little.

552
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,244
Speaker 1: I was a little Mac pimp when I was in first grade.

553
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,250
Speaker 1: I followed all the girls around.

554
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,529
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the lone blue shirt in the sea of jumpers.

555
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:30,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to a Catholic school.

556
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:42,101
Speaker 0: No But that argument anyway All I was trying to say was that the fact that girls play with Barbie and boys play with matchbox cars is not entirely Due to the commercials that they watch during TV shows.

557
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:49,404
Speaker 0: there is also there is something other reason besides Society and graining that idea into children that that is the way it is.

558
00:38:49,584 --> 00:38:51,330
Speaker 2: I think society is a great part of it.

559
00:38:51,410 --> 00:39:02,196
Speaker 2: I also think there are some psychological differences But all I'm saying is a lot of times the way you present this stuff comes across as incredibly Insufferably sexist.

560
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:03,182
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

561
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,409
Speaker 0: No one else seems to think so.

562
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:18,414
Speaker 0: Yes, they do Scott You don't see me beating women or Scott.

563
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:23,210
Speaker 1: you often make very good logical arguments about things.

564
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:29,264
Speaker 1: However, you often as your evidence will make up a meta a hypothetical situation.

565
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:31,830
Speaker 1: that is absurd to the point of being offensive.

566
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:40,074
Speaker 1: I'm not bringing up the classic one that all of us cite because I don't really feel like bothering with it on the air But good God.

567
00:39:40,094 --> 00:39:43,446
Speaker 0: Well, that's the other thing is I don't think that anything is offensive.

568
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,610
Speaker 0: I think people are offended.

569
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:46,393
Speaker 2: No, I'm just.

570
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:50,729
Speaker 2: I'm just mainly messing with you because like like I said tonight you've been on a roll.

571
00:39:51,192 --> 00:39:52,559
Speaker 2: What was the gun emcee thing?

572
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,690
Speaker 2: It's like her boobs are big cuz she's pregnant.

573
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,738
Speaker 2: He was making reference.

574
00:39:58,778 --> 00:39:59,581
Speaker 2: cuz we're talking about.

575
00:39:59,621 --> 00:40:11,047
Speaker 2: she's smart enough to be the captain of the spaceship And I said, oh that Scientific American article about you know, the woman's Intelligence changing when they become pregnant, you know that there are different psychological.

576
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:14,288
Speaker 0: and then I was like There must be something to that.

577
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:24,962
Speaker 0: Eating pizza and pickles, you know Scott you just made a joke poorly and we Didn't get it wasn't much of a joke.

578
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,429
Speaker 0: It was just more kind of like an a.

579
00:40:27,032 --> 00:40:29,442
Speaker 2: So let's let's stop picking on Scott.

580
00:40:29,683 --> 00:40:31,833
Speaker 2: yeah talk about something though I'll admit there's.

581
00:40:31,853 --> 00:40:35,590
Speaker 1: no I'm glad you came up because I don't know what it is with you people.

582
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:44,189
Speaker 1: You must be sadis, but I got more feedback about yesterday's episode than about any other freaking episode We've done and everyone was telling me.

583
00:40:46,013 --> 00:40:50,689
Speaker 1: All it was was me and Scott arguing with each other about Wikipedia about Wikipedia and about Nintendo DS.

584
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,239
Speaker 1: Instead of doing the show we wanted to do.

585
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,837
Speaker 1: we just yelled and screamed at each other and I cut out a good 20 minutes Of arguing.

586
00:40:56,877 --> 00:40:58,451
Speaker 0: that wasn't even a good arguing I mean.

587
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:02,890
Speaker 0: we said I think we ran through the whole argument in Wikipedia and then ran through the whole thing again from the beginning.

588
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,137
Speaker 1: Yep, but then we ran through it yelling at evidence.

589
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:05,859
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,688
Speaker 2: Yeah when these when it comes to argument these two are pros.

591
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:10,900
Speaker 1: Why do you people want to listen to us?

592
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:11,765
Speaker 1: Are you that's?

593
00:41:11,785 --> 00:41:12,550
Speaker 0: I don't know.

594
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:16,350
Speaker 1: They're just nobody nobody cared about when we did a nice series on how to build a computer.

595
00:41:16,731 --> 00:41:17,493
Speaker 1: Everyone cares about.

596
00:41:18,035 --> 00:41:18,275
Speaker 1: Scott.

597
00:41:18,295 --> 00:41:19,118
Speaker 1: remember yelling at each other.

598
00:41:19,178 --> 00:41:20,983
Speaker 2: It's the conflict, you know every.

599
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:26,236
Speaker 2: they always tell us this and you know screenwriting class But I don't conflict.

600
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:27,179
Speaker 2: the drama.

601
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:27,982
Speaker 0: no, I don't know.

602
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:31,266
Speaker 0: strangers want to hear that though, that's the thing entertaining.

603
00:41:33,171 --> 00:41:36,338
Speaker 0: See any feedback from strangers on that episode.

604
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,270
Speaker 0: No, I only saw feedback from people we know all I gotta say about Wikipedia.

605
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,890
Speaker 2: I'm writing that article about Flemish giant rabbits.

606
00:41:44,242 --> 00:41:50,750
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz I gotta say I learned one weird thing about rabbits on Wikipedia and it's that rabbits are instrumental to the lemon farming industry.

607
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:52,548
Speaker 2: I'm gonna go farm me some lemon.

608
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,543
Speaker 0: They protect the lemons from parasites or something.

609
00:41:55,583 --> 00:42:01,570
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it's actually Yeah, it's their their urine and they're dropping and poop all over the lemon fields.

610
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:02,914
Speaker 1: Yes, and for what?

611
00:42:02,994 --> 00:42:03,195
Speaker 1: the?

612
00:42:03,315 --> 00:42:11,119
Speaker 1: the chemical makeup of those components is a very conducive to citrus Bright because the rabbits are eating citruses.

613
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:11,701
Speaker 1: No.

614
00:42:11,782 --> 00:42:14,210
Speaker 1: No, I don't think rabbits particularly like a lemon.

615
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:20,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, no, but that's the thing is they don't eat the lemons, but they eat other things that are vegetable fruit type matter.

616
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:26,850
Speaker 2: I always thought rabbit urine was very acidic in general, but rim said it's because it has a lot of nitrates in it.

617
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:27,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

618
00:42:27,896 --> 00:42:32,417
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm obviously going on what I remember from a Read a few days ago.

619
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:33,743
Speaker 0: You should ask a rabbit ologist.

620
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,342
Speaker 2: Oh I'm a rabbit ologist for real.

621
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:38,810
Speaker 2: No, I just read a lot of.

622
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,879
Speaker 2: I'm probably of anybody in this room.

623
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:43,922
Speaker 2: I'm probably the best first.

624
00:42:44,023 --> 00:42:45,890
Speaker 1: I would say the the breeding habits.

625
00:42:46,892 --> 00:42:48,439
Speaker 0: I don't know if you're a real rabbit ologist.

626
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,529
Speaker 2: I don't have a degree in rabbits.

627
00:42:52,956 --> 00:42:58,430
Speaker 1: I would say that she knows more about rabbits that I know about dogs and I freaking love dogs.

628
00:42:59,233 --> 00:43:02,082
Speaker 2: I'm obsessive to the point of being kind of scary about it.

629
00:43:02,203 --> 00:43:02,965
Speaker 0: But yes for sure.

630
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:03,527
Speaker 2: Yep.

631
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:03,928
Speaker 2: Yeah.

632
00:43:04,691 --> 00:43:06,457
Speaker 0: So anyway, what's the episode today?

633
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:09,327
Speaker 1: Yeah was going to be about since it's gaming day.

634
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:10,109
Speaker 0: It's still about.

635
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,349
Speaker 2: we bought the chair fund.

636
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:14,003
Speaker 0: okay, we're gonna get there.

637
00:43:14,044 --> 00:43:17,800
Speaker 1: so I Want to talk about totally forgotten about that.

638
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,868
Speaker 0: Okay, let's talk about this gaming group.

639
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:20,430
Speaker 0: That's near here.

640
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,728
Speaker 0: We like board games and in college you had people to play board games with.

641
00:43:23,889 --> 00:43:26,710
Speaker 1: yeah Like we had a whole club of hundreds of people just playing board games.

642
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:28,237
Speaker 0: It wasn't hundreds, but it was big enough.

643
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,583
Speaker 1: It had hundreds of members.

644
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:30,728
Speaker 1: They didn't all show up.

645
00:43:30,949 --> 00:43:35,290
Speaker 0: Yes So we had places to play board games.

646
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:45,702
Speaker 0: We would love to play board games with and board games require usually three and sometimes up to seven people, you know It's hard to make a two-player board game for lots of mathematical.

647
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:48,010
Speaker 0: there are a few two-player games that I'm gonna try out.

648
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:50,776
Speaker 0: I think they might be good but I don't know how long that lasts us.

649
00:43:50,837 --> 00:44:00,029
Speaker 0: but the the for the four-player game seems to be like the best games because it's You know, there's no none of that two people ganging up on the third player business and it's just generally good all around.

650
00:44:00,089 --> 00:44:05,247
Speaker 0: so We didn't have anyone to play games with when we were here because only two of us and we were desperate.

651
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:10,670
Speaker 1: like I moved here Too over two years before he did and I was searching I couldn't find gamers anywhere.

652
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,290
Speaker 0: So finally I found this group of gamers.

653
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:26,610
Speaker 0: I found out that they existed or had once existed and they were called maws the mid-hud scenario wargame society and It took me like months and months and months to actually contact them because they were so out of touch with reality.

654
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:28,900
Speaker 1: I guess their website was a tripod site.

655
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,370
Speaker 0: Well, their website tripod site didn't exist.

656
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,438
Speaker 0: They had a website before that was destroyed.

657
00:44:33,699 --> 00:44:38,180
Speaker 0: the tripod site is destroyed like what in a fire I don't know but it no longer existed.

658
00:44:38,221 --> 00:44:39,810
Speaker 0: there were links to it that were all dead.

659
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,597
Speaker 1: How does a website get destroyed?

660
00:44:41,757 --> 00:44:43,423
Speaker 0: they put it on some hosting and they cancel it?

661
00:44:43,704 --> 00:44:44,005
Speaker 2: Yeah.

662
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:44,768
Speaker 1: Yeah.

663
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:47,980
Speaker 0: Wow So then they got the tripod site very recently.

664
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,830
Speaker 0: then it was terrible and then now he got them a real site.

665
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:56,600
Speaker 0: but the point is is I went there and You know, they're old crusty wargamers, but they're not you know.

666
00:44:56,861 --> 00:45:04,350
Speaker 0: personality wise they're pretty good compared to some other old scary guys I've you know seen and played games with uh, yeah the people at our way we used to know.

667
00:45:04,671 --> 00:45:07,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, like these guys have okay personalities and they're fun to play games with.

668
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:15,987
Speaker 0: but even though they look kind of scary And old which they are kind of scary and old and they you know, they play sometimes scary war games Which I don't like so much.

669
00:45:16,852 --> 00:45:31,741
Speaker 0: So I've been there twice so far playing at the local game store and you know these guys are sort of complaining that they can't get more members and After observing two of their meetings it's plain to see why They don't talk to anybody.

670
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:33,492
Speaker 0: I Was sitting there.

671
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:43,970
Speaker 0: we were playing this giant train game and there must have been over the course of the day Like over ten people coming over and looking at the train game and going ooh, and they were obviously very interested.

672
00:45:44,712 --> 00:45:46,362
Speaker 0: Did anyone have a conversation with them?

673
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:51,189
Speaker 0: No Did anyone even so much as say hi only I did.

674
00:45:51,932 --> 00:45:59,810
Speaker 0: You know, I tried to have a conversation with this one cool old guy who came around but you know Then he got up and left because no everyone else is paying so much attention to this game.

675
00:46:00,413 --> 00:46:03,049
Speaker 0: And I was like, hey you guys here to recruit or you're here to play games.

676
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,975
Speaker 0: so Yeah, now they're.

677
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,987
Speaker 0: they have more scary things about them like the chair thing the chair thing that she.

678
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:13,995
Speaker 1: basically They collect dues.

679
00:46:14,035 --> 00:46:20,084
Speaker 0: They used to collect dues and when I when someone says they collect dues for a club I think oh they're gonna buy advertising they're gonna buy games.

680
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:22,495
Speaker 0: They're gonna buy a banner They're gonna do something.

681
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,663
Speaker 1: So we asked them what their dues are for.

682
00:46:24,704 --> 00:46:24,965
Speaker 1: they said.

683
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,150
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the broken chair fund And i'm like broken chair fund.

684
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:36,892
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought it might have been like some sort of tradition like they have a broken chair They pass around or something silly or it might have been, you know, one of those terms that It's.

685
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:38,777
Speaker 2: it's words, but it means something else.

686
00:46:38,877 --> 00:46:45,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no it's quite literally because many of them are rather uh rotund very uh majestic.

687
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,020
Speaker 1: it was literally and They would often break chairs.

688
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,810
Speaker 0: Um, the other thing is I realized these people don't have a lot of money.

689
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:58,670
Speaker 0: I know it's because they buy too many games or what but um, they didn't seem extremely wealthy.

690
00:46:59,253 --> 00:47:06,721
Speaker 1: That seems to be a trend among uh, not so much video gamers but German board gamers who aren't role-playing gamers and larpers.

691
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:13,830
Speaker 1: and it's like once you leave college and you're a board gamer It's hard to still make money, which I don't see but apparently that seems to be the case.

692
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

693
00:47:15,714 --> 00:47:20,070
Speaker 0: I was the only one there like I was the only one there who didn't mind just going eat out anywhere.

694
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:21,303
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, let's go to the neko.

695
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:25,905
Speaker 0: and they were like, whoa So, you know too too high class, yeah, I guess they couldn't.

696
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:26,730
Speaker 0: they didn't want to do that.

697
00:47:26,971 --> 00:47:27,415
Speaker 0: I don't know.

698
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:29,190
Speaker 0: one guy was unemployed though, so I can understand him.

699
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:37,070
Speaker 2: I wouldn't think it's like the most expensive hobby under the sun though You know that you got some people going yachting and of course, maybe it's a different demographic.

700
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:46,861
Speaker 1: Well, what i'm starting to think is that it seems that most people who like board games The ones who are like they like board games But they also have those other factors of being successful in life.

701
00:47:47,001 --> 00:47:56,009
Speaker 1: Like they're just good at something or whatever Tend to go when they leave college and give up all their fun hobbies and have a normal boring job and work hard at it.

702
00:47:57,152 --> 00:48:00,730
Speaker 1: And because I know a lot of people at ibm who seem like when they were young they were really cool.

703
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:11,270
Speaker 1: They were into these german board games back 20 30 years ago And now they're married to people who hate board games and they never play them anymore And all they do is work go home talk to their family watch tv go to sleep.

704
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:14,919
Speaker 2: This sounds like you're being jaded from your experience at ibm.

705
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,001
Speaker 1: Yes god.

706
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:16,402

Speaker 1: Anyway meter from it.

756
00:50:20,676 --> 00:50:22,967
Speaker 0: So so we got off topic at the gamer guys.

757
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:27,329
Speaker 2: Yes So I I'm geek enough I can run with the rest of them.

758
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:29,269
Speaker 2: I I make the grade.

759
00:50:29,812 --> 00:50:31,237
Speaker 2: Okay, so moz.

760
00:50:31,277 --> 00:50:34,590
Speaker 0: so these is these scary gamer guys and i'm trying to straighten them out.

761
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,776
Speaker 1: We basically kind of took them over as in.

762
00:50:36,836 --> 00:50:40,989
Speaker 1: we built him a website and a forums and we run their mailing list.

763
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:41,310
Speaker 1: now.

764
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:44,570
Speaker 1: And I I see I foresee a transfer of power.

765
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, the transfer of power though their election next is in october 2007 election.

766
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:50,890
Speaker 1: They have like five members.

767
00:50:51,291 --> 00:51:03,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't matter because as soon as see as long as I am the guy who actually talks to people Then eventually i'll be the public face that actually says something that people know and i'll be friends with all the new people.

768
00:51:03,712 --> 00:51:06,744
Speaker 0: And as soon as I recruit more new people than there are existing people.

769
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:07,948
Speaker 0: That's that's the end.

770
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:10,823
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean i'd like to say i'll do that too and I will.

771
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:16,298
Speaker 1: but you see the funny thing is Despite all the work we've done for this group I've never met a single one of them because

772
00:51:16,379 --> 00:51:17,683
Speaker 0: every two of their meetings ever

773
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:19,710
Speaker 1: every time they've met i've gone out of town

774
00:51:20,192 --> 00:51:22,463
Speaker 0: You know, and i'm probably going to be out of town the next time they meet too.

775
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:25,535
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like Conventions.

Speaker 1: we have social lives.

777
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:32,310

Speaker 0: Then he'll know who I am.

823
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:27,044
Speaker 1: See if we can get an interview with him or something.

824
00:53:27,326 --> 00:53:28,130
Speaker 0: That could be cool.

825
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,590
Speaker 0: He's the problem with interviewing him is he's 10 000 times smarter than any of us.

826
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:33,072
Speaker 1: You know what?

827

832
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:41,550

835
00:53:46,404 --> 00:53:49,493
Speaker 2: Well, that might be cas but uh, It's it.

836
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:51,743
Speaker 0: his classes are probably the hardest classes to get into.

837
00:53:51,763 --> 00:53:57,325
Speaker 0: they're like giant lectures at night You know with like lots of people and it probably doesn't count towards your major at all.

838
00:53:57,405 --> 00:54:00,296
Speaker 2: Yeah media studies Well, it could be a gen ed though.

839
00:54:00,317 --> 00:54:06,401
Speaker 2: All right, you know because I do have a certain amount of humanity He always I have to he always announces when he has a new.

840
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,650
Speaker 0: when he he only teaches like one class per semester.

841
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:17,605
Speaker 0: So the next time I see one of his he always announces on his website because you can get all his course Materials on his website so you can take the class along at home if you want to.

00:55:02,831 --> 00:55:04,860
Speaker 0: This thing is three boards.

859
00:55:06,122 --> 00:55:08,173
Speaker 0: It was so big it had three boards.

860
00:55:08,193 --> 00:55:09,460
Speaker 0: You ever seen a game with three boards?

861
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,539
Speaker 1: No, uh battle tech.

862
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:13,645
Speaker 0: You know what.

863
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,458
Speaker 0: it was bigger than three battle tech boards.

864
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:16,786
Speaker 0: It's pretty big.

865
00:55:17,007 --> 00:55:17,671
Speaker 0: It was so huge.

866
00:55:17,852 --> 00:55:23,245
Speaker 0: So it's basically giant hex map with cities and You would have money.

867
00:55:23,265 --> 00:55:32,060
Speaker 0: and if you didn't have enough money to do what you wanted you to take shares from the bank And then you had to pay like a thousand dollars of your money per share per turn.

868
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:38,280
Speaker 0: So taking too many shares would cut into your profits And your victory points would be your like income.

869
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:44,194
Speaker 0: So if you didn't have enough victory points, you had too many shares You would lose money every turn and had to take out more shares.

870
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:44,998
Speaker 0: and that's what happened to me.

871
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:51,952
Speaker 0: I lost But you just spent money to build track And then you would ship cubes along the track to get more points.

872
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:54,420
Speaker 1: do the cubes actually fit in the little trains?

873
00:55:55,702 --> 00:55:56,707
Speaker 0: No, it's not like that.

874
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:59,019
Speaker 1: Ah, it's just cubes and what good is it?

875
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:01,195
Speaker 0: It was all right.

876
00:56:03,163 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 0: I don't think it was like my favorite game ever, but it was pretty good.

877
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:13,730
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of our problem is that between puerto rico and tigris and euphrates We've pretty much come upon the current perfection of gaming.

878
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:18,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least that type of gaming this game apex This yes, this game.

879
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:20,111
Speaker 0: I think would be really fun.

880
00:56:20,232 --> 00:56:29,240
Speaker 0: if you have a lot of people like five or six people And you all want to get around a big table and like, you know, yell about cubes and stuff for like a while

881
00:56:30,501 --> 00:56:34,555
Speaker 1: Why don't we just get a bunch of wooden cubes and take a chessboard and move them around and yell

882
00:56:34,676 --> 00:56:35,800
Speaker 0: because you wouldn't have any trains?

883
00:56:36,781 --> 00:56:37,729
Speaker 2: Anybody out there?

884
00:56:37,749 --> 00:56:38,718
Speaker 2: No bug room.

885
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:45,299
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you're trying to figure out what bug room is because my sister my sister was doing this.

886
00:56:45,681 --> 00:56:55,910
Speaker 2: She's pre-med and biology so she was going on a job shadow thing in an emergency room With one of our doctor friends in wisconsin and scary.

887
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:56,532
Speaker 2: What?

888
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:56,913
Speaker 2: why?

889
00:56:56,933 --> 00:56:58,718
Speaker 0: emergency room guts and things?

890
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:03,425
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah Well, some of the things were pretty intense But anyway, she had some stories.

891
00:57:03,726 --> 00:57:13,800
Speaker 2: but my cousin, you know since she was staying with my aunt my cousin is really A whole bunch of geeky friends really into dnd and a lot of german board games.

892
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,160
Speaker 2: But they were playing this chess thing.

893
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,895
Speaker 2: It's like with two chess boards and you could switch pieces in and out.

894
00:57:19,955 --> 00:57:25,977
Speaker 2: and it was called bug room I think and I had never heard of it and I can't really find any information on it.

895
00:57:26,058 --> 00:57:29,087
Speaker 1: So Hmm, I mean one thing I got to say from what?

896
00:57:29,188 --> 00:57:35,628
Speaker 1: from the vague description we got it seems to sound a lot like It's not chess, but it's it's.

897
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:38,919
Speaker 1: it is to chess as the carcass own expansions are to carcass own.

898
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:44,295
Speaker 1: As in you use chess pieces and chess boards and some chess rules But it doesn't play like chess because it's crazy.

899
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:45,742
Speaker 0: How do you?

900
00:57:46,244 --> 00:57:47,908
Speaker 0: there's no such thing on board game geeks.

901
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:49,633
Speaker 0: No, i'm really curious.

902
00:57:49,954 --> 00:57:53,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, you sure you're spelling it Or saying it was like bug room.

903
00:57:54,781 --> 00:57:56,991
Speaker 0: Bug room not bug rum or something.

904
00:57:57,413 --> 00:57:58,538
Speaker 2: Nah, maybe i'm just.

905
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,790
Speaker 0: Where did they learn the game from?

906
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,758
Speaker 0: did like someone teach it to them or something?

907
00:58:03,798 --> 00:58:04,119
Speaker 0: Yeah.

908
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,718
Speaker 2: Yeah She was playing with my cousin's friends.

Speaker 2: uh, I don't know what bug room stands for but

911
00:58:15,664 --> 00:58:16,997

Speaker 1: I mean mafia is on the internet fairly widely now, but that wasn't.
