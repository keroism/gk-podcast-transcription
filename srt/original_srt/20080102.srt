00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:01,245
Speaker 1: I don't know what's in this box.

16
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,811
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about this.

17
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,277
Speaker 1: You don't want to talk about it.

18
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,000
Speaker 0: I don't care.

19
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,627
Speaker 1: We have to talk about it.

20
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,169
Speaker 1: Why?

21
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,615
Speaker 1: because she brought it it's hair.

22
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:09,719
Speaker 1: It's sitting in front of me.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,307
Speaker 0: It's put in a closet or something.

24
00:01:11,347 --> 00:01:12,674
Speaker 0: throw it out to sell it on eBay.

25
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:13,136
Speaker 0: I don't know.

26
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,209
Speaker 1: If you really don't care I won't talk about it.

27
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:16,872
Speaker 0: All right.

28
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:18,519
Speaker 0: Okay, then talk about it then.

29
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,676
Speaker 0: So I was at the post office today and you know, I tried to go to the post office.

30
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:25,700
Speaker 1: I don't care about this.

31
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:27,840
Speaker 0: Okay, we won't talk about that either.

32
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:30,377
Speaker 1: You're gonna say that some fat lady got in front of you in line.

33
00:01:30,397 --> 00:01:30,800
Speaker 1: You had to wait.

34
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:33,510
Speaker 0: No, I was also gonna talk about selling stuff on eBay.

35
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:36,140
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, I sold something on eBay.

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,441
Speaker 0: You know what?

37
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:40,072
Speaker 0: I figured out it's unless you are like super poor.

38
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:42,540
Speaker 0: It is not worth it to sell stuff on eBay.

39
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,391
Speaker 0: I mean I sold some RAM.

40
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,216
Speaker 0: I had lying around.

41
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:48,579
Speaker 0: that was still good But I had no use for it and I figured this will get some money.

42
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:57,155
Speaker 0: The amount of money I got versus the amount of trouble I had to go through to sell it Even if there had been no line at the post office Not worth it.

43
00:01:58,102 --> 00:02:02,780
Speaker 1: So you're saying that it would have been more economical to throw the RAM away than to sell it on eBay.

44
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:07,320
Speaker 0: Maybe not economical because I have a salary job.

45
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,958
Speaker 1: You realize economical includes your opportunity cost of your time and that sort of thing.

46
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:15,260
Speaker 0: then Yes, it would have been more economical for me to throw the RAM away.

47
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:18,470
Speaker 1: I have never bought anything on eBay and I've never sold anything.

48
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:21,821
Speaker 0: buying things on eBay isn't so bad if you can get a Deal.

49
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:24,995
Speaker 0: because I you know people always think oh eBay scams.

50
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:29,694
Speaker 0: and yeah, there's scams there But they're generally obvious and every time I've ever bought something on eBay.

51
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,180
Speaker 0: I've always successfully received it.

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,284
Speaker 0: I mean we got that dune game right?

53
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:32,826
Speaker 0: Perfect.

54
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:36,660
Speaker 0: So yeah, but selling stuff on eBay almost perfect.

55
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,315
Speaker 1: There's some creepy wax seals on a bunch of the spice.

56
00:02:40,335 --> 00:02:41,540
Speaker 1: I don't know why that's there.

57
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:44,894
Speaker 1: Why are there wax seals on the spice?

58
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:45,658
Speaker 0: I don't know.

59
00:02:46,802 --> 00:02:47,987
Speaker 0: They keep prevent different flowing.

60
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:52,149
Speaker 1: I Can't wait to talk about the dune game.

61
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:54,000
Speaker 0: Well tell you how to do in game in a few weeks.

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,326
Speaker 0: We got some hot stuff next week.

63
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:57,235
Speaker 1: We should play some more two-player dune.

64
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:00,742
Speaker 1: I can be the Harkonnen about not All right.

65
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:03,556
Speaker 1: So what do you got in the anime manga comic news then?

66
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:09,300
Speaker 0: Oh God, I really I don't want to do this news because it's such a shit shit news.

67
00:03:09,944 --> 00:03:12,299
Speaker 0: But there really isn't anything else to talk about.

68
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,751
Speaker 0: So I'd rather do the shit news than the nothing news.

69
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:19,543
Speaker 0: and you know, we've been laying on some underwear perfect Love lately.

70
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:23,094
Speaker 0: So now we got to lay back on five times the underwear.

71
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:23,655
Speaker 0: pervert hate.

72
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:24,056
Speaker 0: You're ready.

73
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:25,180
Speaker 1: All right, I'm ready.

74
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,785
Speaker 0: Okay, you know spider-man Yeah guy shoots webs.

75
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:34,200
Speaker 1: He had one possibly two good movies, and I don't like anything else spider-man, right?

76
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:43,438
Speaker 0: well, there was a recent story in spider-man right and The story goes like this remember recently spider-man like revealed himself to the world.

77
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:43,799
Speaker 0: now.

78
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:47,958
Speaker 0: Oh spider-man revealed himself to the world like a year ago months ago.

79
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,486
Speaker 0: Okay So the story now is this.

80
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,595
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to sum it up in as few words as possible.

81
00:03:52,636 --> 00:03:56,153
Speaker 0: if you actually care about Spider-man, first of all, how are you a geek nice fan?

82
00:03:56,756 --> 00:03:59,022
Speaker 0: and second of all Tough shit.

83
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:02,990
Speaker 1: So did something happen to our friendly neighborhood?

84
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,852
Speaker 0: Listen to this, right?

85
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 0: Look take what I'm about to describe to you as Sort of a a story Right and sort of examine this story from the perspective of someone who is like an author Someone who is judging good writing from bad writing right not from the respective of underwear perverts, right?

86
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:34,660
Speaker 0: Okay, so spider-man revealed himself to the world and his aunt May who by all means should have been dead a hundred years ago She must be like 300 years old by now get shot by like a sniper and is in the hospital But not dead this crazy old woman.

87
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:39,039
Speaker 0: so Spider-man really wants her to come back to life.

88
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:40,960
Speaker 0: So he goes to Iron Man.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,679
Speaker 0: He says Iron Man give me some money and Iron Man's like black can't help you.

90
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:45,825
Speaker 1: But why not?

91
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:48,300
Speaker 0: Iron Man has money but then Iron Man gives some money anyway.

92
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,309
Speaker 1: so why did that do?

93
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:51,878
Speaker 1: that didn't even matter right.

94
00:04:51,898 --> 00:04:56,872
Speaker 0: and then It still isn't helping right.

95
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,100
Speaker 0: your old lady's gonna die.

96
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:02,199
Speaker 0: So he goes and Mephisto shows up who's effectively Satan.

97
00:05:03,242 --> 00:05:10,079
Speaker 0: spider-man makes a deal with Satan and It makes a deal with Satan that The old lady doesn't die.

98
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:18,180
Speaker 0: but Basically spider-man like for and his wife both forget their marriage like as as if it never happened.

99
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:23,713
Speaker 1: That is perhaps The dumbest thing I've ever heard.

100
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:31,212
Speaker 1: yeah Care about spider-man's marriage who's even married to Mary Jane, okay?

101
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:33,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, it's.

102
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:34,600
Speaker 0: it's so stupid.

103
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:42,460
Speaker 0: Even the underwear perverts don't like it like if there's a poll on you know that's the comic nerd news website.

104
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,951
Speaker 0: That's like do you think this was good, and it's like nine thousand.

105
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,278
Speaker 0: This is the worst thing ever like a hundred.

106
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:48,840
Speaker 0: This is great.

107
00:05:50,881 --> 00:06:04,340
Speaker 0: so I Just want to point out that I really think this has revealed to me the fundamental problem with the underwear pervert comics Especially the ones that tend to be in the US Marvel DC that go on forever and ever and ever and ever

108
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:06,507
Speaker 1: Writing bad plot run out of stuff to do.

109
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:07,430
Speaker 0: no.

110
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,520
Speaker 0: It's that they have a status quo, right?

111
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,791
Speaker 0: you know this is what spider-man is.

112
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,378
Speaker 0: he's this and he's this and he's this right.

113
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:23,586
Speaker 0: and you really can't tell a story right with any drama or excitement or or Suspense or anything.

114
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:29,228
Speaker 0: you can't have any feeling in any sort of narrative without somehow threatening the status quo.

115
00:06:29,429 --> 00:06:33,905
Speaker 0: and Years they change.

116
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:39,746
Speaker 0: the status quo is there was one girlfriend and then she actually died and then his friends died and then he got married.

117
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,850
Speaker 0: in the status quo change and change and change right.

118
00:06:41,870 --> 00:07:09,700
Speaker 0: and But then you know once the status quo got to it's been in like one place for a long time now and all the stories All they all the stories ever do is change the status quo change it back change it change it back again change it change it back Again, so now because they've run out of things to do they went back to the original status quo of like 1960 whatever And pretty much every underwear pervert story you look at is change it go bring it back Superman.

119
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,852
Speaker 0: Remember they killed Superman in like the 90s.

120
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,140
Speaker 0: now Superman is just fine.

121
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:15,850
Speaker 0: Batman at one point like Batman broke his back.

122
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,693
Speaker 0: It was in a wheelchair.

123
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:18,420
Speaker 0: now Batman's just fine.

124
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,672
Speaker 0: You know Robin leaves they bring in a new Robin.

125
00:07:20,712 --> 00:07:22,180
Speaker 0: Robin dies like a new Rob.

126
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:35,505
Speaker 1: I think what they Bank on here and I remember recognizing this as a kid This is one of the reasons I'd never wanted to read Underwear pervert comics was that I'd look and every time someone told me about a comic or they were excited about comic books And they like something happened.

127
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:43,059
Speaker 1: It would always be something like oh, man You won't believe what they did to Cyclops this time.

128
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,569
Speaker 0: And meanwhile now Cyclops just fine.

129
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jean Grey dead and alive.

130
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,480
Speaker 1: They're just fine later.

131
00:07:48,540 --> 00:08:00,386
Speaker 1: It's that it seems like all that Matt like people were just like oh my god, so and so got Married to so-and-so and it wasn't the writing it wasn't really the story It was just the actual.

132
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:04,620
Speaker 1: something happened and the thing that happened is the only thing everyone cared about.

133
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,639
Speaker 1: They rabble and rabble and rabble about it, and then they'd get rid of that thing.

134
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz basically all the fans of these things.

135
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:23,620
Speaker 0: They're just Somehow mentally attached to these you know iconic characters for whatever reason and they just they care so much about these Characters more than they care about real human beings you know and anything that happens.

136
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,760
Speaker 0: There's character is a big deal even though they know that the characters will always return to the status quo.

137
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,234
Speaker 1: It's not like anime is any different.

138
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,361
Speaker 1: I'm our manga I mean.

139
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:33,770
Speaker 1: look at one piece and bleach and Naruto.

140
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,135
Speaker 1: you hear someone talk about what.

141
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:39,894
Speaker 1: oh, man So and so fought so and so and and so inside the hair.

142
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,580
Speaker 0: they do like it for the same reasons.

143
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,080
Speaker 0: But if you look at the plot of even something like Naruto right the plot doesn't stay at some status quo.

144
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:53,348
Speaker 0: It's continually moving forward incredibly slowly You know in tiny tiny bits you know.

145
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,180
Speaker 0: and it's like even though you see what's coming a mile away.

146
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,869
Speaker 0: It comes eventually at some point.

147
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:01,939
Speaker 0: You know and they keep moving around even Pokemon.

148
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,565
Speaker 0: eventually He's the Pokemon master.

149
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,132
Speaker 0: eventually you know.

150
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,844
Speaker 0: it does happen at some point You know.

151
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:10,716
Speaker 0: and then they don't go on and make him the Pokemon masters.

152
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:11,479
Speaker 0: They can do it again.

153
00:09:11,862 --> 00:09:13,920
Speaker 0: They just keep moving forward incredibly slowly.

154
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:19,980
Speaker 0: So it never changes too much to throw the status quo off so much that people will go Oh, what is this bullshit?

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,926
Speaker 0: But they do keep moving forward.

156
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:27,509
Speaker 0: so at least it's a little bit better even when it's crap like Naruto, so uh Spider-man is no wait a minute.

157
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,193
Speaker 1: They were married.

158
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,307
Speaker 1: right yep, so Ha the rest of the world knew they were married.

159
00:09:33,049 --> 00:09:35,658
Speaker 1: so does spider-man just not remember, but everyone else does.

160
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,026
Speaker 0: it's well You know I don't know.

161
00:09:37,046 --> 00:09:40,541
Speaker 0: I I didn't actually read this comic Paperwork.

162
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:43,108
Speaker 1: there's all that paperwork that he got married with.

163
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,191
Speaker 1: it's still there.

164
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just.

165
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,139
Speaker 0: you know they just go bleh.

166
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:51,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever It's a comic book, but I only read the summary on Wikipedia.

167
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,282
Speaker 0: I didn't.

168
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:53,929
Speaker 0: I'm not actually reading this shit comic.

169
00:09:54,390 --> 00:10:00,292
Speaker 1: see I think the whole that that quip is actually very Very illuminating into the some of the fundamental problems.

170
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:01,739
Speaker 1: Oh, it's just a comic book.

171
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:03,103
Speaker 1: alright We don't have to worry anymore.

172
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:04,207
Speaker 1: that explains that.

173
00:10:04,668 --> 00:10:06,615
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean they just they don't.

174
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,260
Speaker 0: you know they don't bother with details like that.

175
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,100
Speaker 0: They just they have a thing they want to do and then they just find a way to do it.

176
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,342
Speaker 0: They don't.

177
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:19,760
Speaker 0: actually the thing is the guy who actually wrote the story Posted a thing like yeah, I let everyone know that I thought this was a dumb idea.

178
00:10:19,941 --> 00:10:21,513
Speaker 0: But you know that's what they pay me for.

179
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:25,894
Speaker 0: so I did it And they're all blamed on the editor and the editors like yeah, I did it.

180
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.

181
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:30,969
Speaker 1: bleh Man, if you want to read a comic book just read bone.

182
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, so finally reading bone good all of it, and it's great.

183
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:34,785
Speaker 0: It's great.

184
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:35,995
Speaker 1: I always knew it was great.

185
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:36,580
Speaker 1: It's one of those things.

186
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,751
Speaker 1: I'd always see it and go oh, that's that bone thing.

187
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,560
Speaker 0: the problem is it's gross and things like that.

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,104
Speaker 0: What do you do?

189
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:42,980
Speaker 1: read them all and the way?

190
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,927
Speaker 1: I do that is by not reading anything else.

191
00:10:45,168 --> 00:10:47,940
Speaker 0: what happens if you don't finish before and you die first?

192
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:50,085
Speaker 1: I think I'm doing doing okay, so fine.

193
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:50,727
Speaker 0: You're doing all right.

194
00:10:50,928 --> 00:11:00,606
Speaker 1: I think by not watching bleach Naruto one piece TV or Spider Man or Spider Man I Only even saw the first spider-man movie.

195
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,996
Speaker 1: I liked it, but I heard the second one's good.

196
00:11:03,016 --> 00:11:05,528
Speaker 1: I had the third one stupid Yeah, who knows?

197
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,640
Speaker 1: so ever speaking of spider-man The Japanese released the top 10 manga of 2007 according to a bunch of retailers.

198
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,211
Speaker 0: All right, so these are what retailers in Japan selling.

199
00:11:17,272 --> 00:11:19,920
Speaker 0: tonka bond not we're not counting like shonen jump sales or anything.

200
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Speaker 1: You know it's the anime news network, and they don't say and their source is in Japanese, so that doesn't help me.

201
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:33,484
Speaker 0: I think that's in a safe assumption We can make though if it's retailers And they're getting the individual manga titles cuz I mean if you counted shonen jumps How do you do that?

202
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:36,337
Speaker 0: you get a count everything in shonen jump once for every shonen jump sold.

203
00:11:36,357 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 0: that doesn't yep?

204
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,280
Speaker 1: And then the problem there is that all right add the tonka bond on top of that all right?

205
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,467
Speaker 1: But anyway, they went through.

206
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,460
Speaker 1: it's like the book of the year action committee.

207
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:56,349
Speaker 1: I don't need to read the bottom of this but bunch of stars and the list is one piece Nana Nodama cantabile Naruto full metal alchemist hunter x hunter bleach D gray man Etc.

208
00:11:56,369 --> 00:11:58,542
Speaker 0: and make sense I Don't know.

209
00:11:58,562 --> 00:11:59,889
Speaker 1: I can't really.

210
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:01,859
Speaker 1: I don't think many of these are good.

211
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:03,987
Speaker 0: No, many of them are not good.

212
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:06,577
Speaker 1: hunter x hunter was particularly dumb.

213
00:12:06,617 --> 00:12:07,380
Speaker 0: have you read the manga?

214
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:08,267
Speaker 0: I haven't.

215
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,820
Speaker 0: I've only seen like one episode of the anime.

216
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:15,480
Speaker 1: I've heard it's really dumb from more than one person who I trust I watched the first episode of D gray man anime.

217
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,366
Speaker 0: That was pretty dumb.

218
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:20,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nana's great, but One piece is on top of it.

219
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:21,811
Speaker 1: one piece is only good in theory.

220
00:12:21,831 --> 00:12:25,785
Speaker 0: one one piece some of its good and most of it's Just fights now.

221
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,294
Speaker 1: I've heard Nodama cantabile is actually really good.

222
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is I want to read it.

223
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's about the girl in the music school or whatever.

224
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,514
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be good.

225
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:37,746
Speaker 1: so how's that Naruto Popular?

226
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:38,855
Speaker 0: I mean think about this though.

227
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:45,121
Speaker 0: right Dragon Ball is like the most popular manga there ever was you know and it oh Wait a minute.

228
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:45,904
Speaker 1: one piece.

229
00:12:46,205 --> 00:12:48,733
Speaker 1: number 46 is number one.

230
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,685
Speaker 1: Nana number 18 is not individual volume.

231
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:59,356
Speaker 0: daruto 37 fma 17, okay Now I see what's going on here, I see what you did.

232
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:01,424
Speaker 0: that all right What everybody owns there.

233
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:04,375
Speaker 1: so I guess I have a question cuz I didn't actually read any of it.

234
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:05,780
Speaker 1: the Fullmetal Alchemist manga.

235
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:07,325
Speaker 0: It's average manga.

236
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:09,493
Speaker 1: is it better or worse than the show.

237
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:10,356
Speaker 0: It's just different.

238
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,079
Speaker 1: is it worth it?

239
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:14,232
Speaker 1: If you got time is it actually worth it.

240
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,016
Speaker 1: Are you still reading it?

241
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:15,759
Speaker 1: Are you gonna finish it?

242
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, I sort of like it's weird cuz every time I pick up a volume.

243
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:20,680
Speaker 0: I sort of just start reading it.

244
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,604
Speaker 0: It's just like tee hee hee hee and I barely even remember like what happened in the previous volume And it doesn't really matter either.

245
00:13:26,624 --> 00:13:32,180
Speaker 1: huh, I'm just curious cuz I honestly I realized just now that I just never even read it.

246
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:32,883
Speaker 1: I just didn't.

247
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:33,887
Speaker 0: yeah, I have all of it.

248
00:13:33,907 --> 00:13:34,550
Speaker 0: That's in English.

249
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,307
Speaker 0: I'm just sort of buying it somewhat out of habit But it's I mean it's not bad.

250
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:38,648
Speaker 0: It's just.

251
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:39,915
Speaker 0: it's not something like you know.

252
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:40,820
Speaker 0: It's not a good quality.

253
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:44,616
Speaker 1: I'd number nine is a kata keo hits man reborn.

254
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:45,640
Speaker 0: That's actually really funny.

255
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,269
Speaker 0: Yes, it is I think is I don't know.

256
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,379
Speaker 0: there's a lot of those comedy mangas and things other than gog manga.

257
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:51,479
Speaker 0: vre.

258
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,869
Speaker 0: You know there's sort of like one hit.

259
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:54,853
Speaker 0: wonders is where it's like.

260
00:13:54,893 --> 00:14:02,780
Speaker 0: I could watch an episode of hit man reborn Maybe two episodes or read one volume of the manga and reading a second volume of the manga would just not be funny anymore.

261
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,523
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

262
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:04,446
Speaker 0: I've seen the joke.

263
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,574
Speaker 0: It's over funny little hit man.

264
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:06,875
Speaker 0: Yes.

265
00:14:06,996 --> 00:14:12,778
Speaker 1: I get it yep But then there was the gonna guide chibi Kara world which didn't even have any jokes.

266
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,622
Speaker 0: yeah I think it had insider jokes for gonna guy fans And that was it.

267
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:19,996
Speaker 1: but it had a plot which kind of took the thunder out of all of that.

268
00:14:20,257 --> 00:14:20,759
Speaker 0: it sure did.

269
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:25,960
Speaker 1: So uh last bit of news here just to pan this out because our news is we're both kind of lame and super.

270
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:30,279
Speaker 1: Our choice is anime news network or make something up.

271
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:32,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not.

272
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,224
Speaker 1: So a gog manga.

273
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:38,557
Speaker 1: vre is for the eighth year running the number one media in the world.

274
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:53,055
Speaker 1: yes But oh this will be real quick but I just want to point out that it's a new year and with the new year comes the new con season and The first con of the season for us every year is katsu khan.

275
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:54,179
Speaker 0: well starting last year.

276
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:57,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, well yeah, I went to katsu khan for two years.

277
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,414
Speaker 1: before that I just got to.

278
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,782
Speaker 1: khan was my third favorite Khan.

279
00:15:01,842 --> 00:15:05,920
Speaker 1: it is now my second favorite khan and it might someday become my first favorite.

280
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:07,368
Speaker 0: I might be my thing.

281
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,762
Speaker 0: it might have been the best khan last year Maybe.

282
00:15:09,822 --> 00:15:13,156
Speaker 1: well it really helps katsu khan is that it's not better than Otakon.

283
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:14,000
Speaker 1: It's just different.

284
00:15:14,201 --> 00:15:15,284
Speaker 0: It's better for us.

285
00:15:15,404 --> 00:15:27,422
Speaker 1: cuz you know the most of that video game room if you are between the ages of 17 and 30 The katsu khan is probably the best anime khan for you to go to especially if you're between 21 and 100.

286
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:30,980
Speaker 1: Yes, because it has the I think even though I I don't care about it.

287
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,301
Speaker 0: no,

288
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:44,598
Speaker 1: but the most important thing is that the bar at the khan is really classy and If you want if you're one of those people who's single and is going to anime cons you want to meet people You can go into the bar and basically be guaranteed to not break laws.

289
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:51,597
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, katsu khan as you know is the khan where we do a lot of shit.

290
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:53,647
Speaker 1: to put it lightly I mean pretty much kinetic.

291
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,080
Speaker 1: how do we do a million panels and katsu khan?

292
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,270
Speaker 1: We kind of started high and are ramping it up every year.

293
00:15:59,291 --> 00:15:59,893
Speaker 1: Yep.

294
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:05,031
Speaker 0: So katsu khan is February 15 16 and 17. it's coming up pretty quick.

295
00:16:05,412 --> 00:16:11,623
Speaker 0: If you already haven't if you haven't got a hotel already I don't think you're gonna the overflow hotel as Room still.

296
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:15,380
Speaker 1: however the overflow hotel you have to go over a bridge and the bridge sucks.

297
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,505
Speaker 1: But I'd be worried.

298
00:16:16,565 --> 00:16:18,795
Speaker 0: but getting a badge is not difficult to this con.

299
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,564
Speaker 1: It might be worth it though I can tell you this.

300
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:21,589

322
00:17:34,642 --> 00:17:36,470
Speaker 1: So, um, you like Freddie Mercury.

323
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:45,054
Speaker 1: Yeah, a good artist you think yeah maybe was was a good artist maybe greatest live rock singer ever Possibly possibly.

324
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:55,450
Speaker 1: Well, uh, there is in fact a band and a singer that while they're not quite Freddie Mercury level they're very reminiscent of Freddie Mercury.

325
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,554
Speaker 0: I don't really think so.

326
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:57,979
Speaker 1: a lot of the songs are.

327
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,250
Speaker 1: one of the songs is a pretty much straight-up tribute to fat bottom girls.

328
00:18:01,511 --> 00:18:03,519
Speaker 0: I don't know just cuz it has a similar subject.

329
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,026
Speaker 0: It's not really a similar song.

330
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:08,419
Speaker 0: nor does the guy Quite give me a Freddie Mercury vibe.

331
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:09,683
Speaker 1: Have you listen to all their music?

332
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:10,386
Speaker 0: No.

333
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:16,248
Speaker 1: Oh, well, there you go But it just so happens that the one I'm linking to is not quite the perfect example of that.

334
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:25,930
Speaker 0: However this uh This music video is pretty hot and I'm going to video is awesome regardless of how close it really it resembles Freddie Mercury or not.

335
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:33,895
Speaker 1: I am going to piss off Darryl Surratt and say that this music video is Definitely super flat.

336
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:36,541
Speaker 1: Oh, this is super flat.

337
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:37,924
Speaker 1: It is super flat.

338
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:44,439
Speaker 1: It's more yellow submarine Yeah, but it's too well animated and it's super flat.

339
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,865
Speaker 0: yellow submarine as well animated not as well as this.

340
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:48,490
Speaker 1: there were no computers back then.

341
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:52,496
Speaker 1: Okay This is pretty terrific and you should see it.

342
00:18:52,576 --> 00:19:02,310
Speaker 1: if you can find a non YouTube version somewhere or I don't know any sort of Non-utubified thing because there's a lot going on in the animation that YouTube really can't show you.

343
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:09,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, but regardless watching it in YouTube is still okay because this music video is probably in my top 10 now You can probably bit torn or something, right?

344
00:19:09,776 --> 00:19:10,880
Speaker 1: I don't know.

345
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,783
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's out there.

346
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:13,709
Speaker 0: I might think of the day.

347
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,870
Speaker 0: initial D The arcade game, you know it it exists.

348
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:24,925
Speaker 0: There have been four versions of this game version one kind of blab version.

349
00:19:24,965 --> 00:19:25,908
Speaker 0: two kind of blab version.

350
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:36,930
Speaker 1: three amazing Version four even more amazing than version three if you thought that if you didn't think that was possible Yep, I think I talked about that a little bit when I was when I went back to Rochester for that weekend.

351
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:46,798
Speaker 1: I went to hammer girl and sure enough The initial D machine was a lot bigger and had LCDs and when I tried to do my classic Go down the mountain real fast.

352
00:19:46,899 --> 00:19:49,168
Speaker 1: I crashed into every single wall because it was completely different.

353
00:19:49,328 --> 00:20:08,208
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think it might be you know, if not already quickly approaching being I guess, you know I guess I assume there'll be a five and a six and whatever the greatest arcade racing game there is and I don't mean You know physically in the arcade even though that is also true I mean arcade style as in the style of driving is arcade style.

354
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:24,348
Speaker 0: driving which means a virtue erasing may be dethroned or maybe not but regardless in Japan the land of all the greatest things in the world that never go anywhere else They have made a special version a limited release of initial d4.

355
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,509
Speaker 0: it's the same game that you would play initial d4 in your local arcade, but it's the special edition.

356
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:37,607
Speaker 0: and Well, you will see in this video Exactly why this is a special edition of initial d4 not the regular edition.

357
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:49,289
Speaker 1: if I am ever Idly wealthy to the point where I just live a life of decadent powdered decadence I will purchase some sort of device similar to what Scott is going to show you in this video.

358
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,028
Speaker 0: I'll just let you watch the video on your own.

359
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:53,775
Speaker 1: This is a epic.

360
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:58,090
Speaker 0: even if you don't like initial D and you don't care about cars or racing video games.

361
00:20:58,732 --> 00:21:03,987
Speaker 0: You should see this just as an example of that's how Japan does it and the u.s.

362
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:04,850
Speaker 0: Really?

363
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,153
Speaker 0: Doesn't do that.

364
00:21:06,193 --> 00:21:08,002
Speaker 0: That's why they suck Oh Scott.

365
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:23,593
Speaker 1: I would just like to point out that the BBC Talks at length in two different articles about how Mika is in fact the reincarnation of Freddie Mercury whatever and apparently He recorded something recently on Freddie Mercury's piano Uh-huh.

366
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:25,943
Speaker 0: Yes, Freddie Mercury had more than one piano.

367
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,570
Speaker 1: Well one of Freddie Mercury's pianos.

368
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,241
Speaker 0: I'll have to go look into this cuz I don't see.

369
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:34,189
Speaker 1: I think you should listen to more of his music before you say anything maybe.

370
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:39,562
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so, uh, we haven't talked about anime in a while.

371
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,585
Speaker 1: Have we not so much.

372
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:42,110
Speaker 0: No, we haven't watched any anime.

373
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,416
Speaker 0: This is what the hell are we gonna do?

374
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:46,409
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it works out that we've been reading a lot of comics.

375
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:47,715
Speaker 1: suddenly I guess it's comic season.

376
00:21:47,976 --> 00:21:51,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're making up for back in the day when used to hundred anime shows and no comic shows.

377
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:57,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the real problem is the only show I'm excited about now is bacchanal and I haven't watched enough of it.

378
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:04,874
Speaker 0: Maybe we should like Netflix one of those shows that you know from back like maybe the ergo proxy or something Did that finish coming out?

379
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:06,741
Speaker 1: I assume so I did genie on.

380
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,408
Speaker 0: is they're going out of business?

381
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:08,930
Speaker 0: prevent that?

382
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:09,613
Speaker 1: I really.

383
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:12,043
Speaker 1: I got to watch the rest of that show because I really like that show.

384
00:22:12,103 --> 00:22:19,682
Speaker 1: and the thing is I Remember ergo proxy was coming out or watching it and I got to the point I'm like, wow, I'm suddenly bored with this.

385
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:22,394
Speaker 1: if the next episode doesn't Kick it into high gear.

386
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:22,876
Speaker 1: I'm done.

387
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:25,870
Speaker 1: And then the next episode kicked it up into high gear and I was hooked again.

388
00:22:26,151 --> 00:22:27,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, I checked the Netflix for that.

389
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:28,802
Speaker 0: Maybe we can watch it.

390
00:22:28,983 --> 00:22:30,188
Speaker 1: See the thing is what are we gonna watch?

391
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:30,650
Speaker 1: the Netflix?

392
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,959
Speaker 1: We you know what the next anime in the queue is.

393
00:22:32,979 --> 00:22:33,381
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

394
00:22:33,823 --> 00:22:34,767
Speaker 1: Kazu no yo Jimbo.

395
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,235
Speaker 0: That's a good one Which I saw.

396
00:22:36,275 --> 00:22:37,402
Speaker 0: four episodes and they were good.

397
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:38,670
Speaker 1: and you know what's in the queue right now.

398
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,939
Speaker 1: You know what's sitting in front of the Mac right now?

399
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, gankotsu.

400
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,988
Speaker 1: Oh the last is that we still haven't watched.

401
00:22:45,209 --> 00:22:49,030
Speaker 0: No Alright Well this weekend, you know, we're not doing anything.

402
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:54,170
Speaker 1: You know, maybe it's like the more of things we do at anime cons the less anime we watch.

403
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:58,289
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that if we start doing like main events at Otakon, we'll never watch anime again.

404
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:03,341
Speaker 1: Maybe it's kind of like an RIT the more we did with the anime club the less anime we watched.

405
00:23:03,401 --> 00:23:12,050
Speaker 1: and pretty much if you grabbed like Level in the anime club hierarchy versus amount of anime watched the limit at infinity is zero and such.

406
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,156
Speaker 0: Yeah you think that like you go to anime con.

407
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:20,530
Speaker 0: right and there's the people at the top of the con like the con chairs and The guests in the the industry people right?

408
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,593
Speaker 0: These are the big people.

409
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:24,101
Speaker 0: right lots of access lots of everything.

410
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:26,810
Speaker 0: and then there's the lowly fan who's poor.

411
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,226
Speaker 0: They're a high school kid, right?

412
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,208
Speaker 0: That little high school kid.

413
00:23:30,711 --> 00:23:34,023
Speaker 0: He might be all jealous of those people at the way top but little does he know.

414
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:39,321
Speaker 0: that little high school kid is watching a thousand Times more anime than the con chair has watched all year.

415
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:42,010
Speaker 1: I remember when I ran the RIT anime club.

416
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:42,898
Speaker 1: I didn't even like.

417
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:44,330
Speaker 1: we just put on anime.

418
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:57,510
Speaker 1: We'd show people anime and I would pretty much stand there in the back of the room after the anime started make sure nothing blew Up and then after the music videos played I'd leave because I had anime club work to do and it sucked.

419
00:23:57,992 --> 00:24:04,609
Speaker 0: Yep, the people are making all this stuff happen are actually doing work and that's why you know everyone thinks Oh and I work on video games.

420
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:05,654
Speaker 0: I'll get to play video games.

421
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:06,276
Speaker 0: all they know.

422
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:10,290
Speaker 0: you will actually play almost no video games if you work in video games.

423
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:14,490
Speaker 1: In fact at best you'll play one video game that you're already sick of every day.

424
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:24,389
Speaker 0: If your job is writing comic books You will end up reading almost no comic books compared to just being a fan that this is the reality of geekdom get with it Understand it.

425
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,898
Speaker 0: Anyway, what anime let's?

426
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,950
Speaker 0: because we haven't watched anime recently But we have to do an anime show because it's mostly been comics lately.

427
00:24:31,632 --> 00:24:35,325
Speaker 0: Let us talk about a show of anime from the olden days.

428
00:24:35,446 --> 00:24:40,324
Speaker 0: All right, let's talk about Escaflowne but I haven't why I gotta watch that again cuz I forget it.

429
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,408
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about dragon half.

430
00:24:43,411 --> 00:24:43,833
Speaker 0: We could.

431
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:45,943
Speaker 0: I need a little bit reminder.

432
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:49,763
Speaker 1: I Think we talked about Ava.

433
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:54,749
Speaker 1: No, have we ever actually talked about cowboy bebop, you know, huh?

434
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,405
Speaker 0: It looks like we got a lot of enemies to talk about.

435
00:24:57,425 --> 00:25:05,187
Speaker 1: I don't know I feel like a lot of those I want to hold off on but then again That was one of the reasons why anime world order avoided doing all those shows for so long.

436
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:06,010
Speaker 0: and I'll tell you what.

437
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,657
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what.

438
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:07,730
Speaker 0: Oh, no, never mind.

439
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:09,234
Speaker 0: See here's the thing.

440
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:09,716
Speaker 0: is I just?

441
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:10,962
Speaker 0: this is sort of off topic.

442
00:25:11,002 --> 00:25:16,661
Speaker 0: I'm delaying the main bit here, but I Downloaded all those Lucasarts adventure games.

443
00:25:17,002 --> 00:25:18,630
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what we need right now.

444
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:23,028
Speaker 1: You need to give me full throttle and grim fandango instead of anime, right?

445
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,023
Speaker 0: And I was just thinking well, you know what?

446
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:25,730
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do it.

447
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,303
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take those Ava discs and watch them on the train and we'll be done with it and we can do it.

448
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,426
Speaker 0: and Now I'm gonna be playing adventure game.

449
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:37,696
Speaker 1: sorry Okay, at least Ava went to one thing.

450
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:42,147
Speaker 1: it's still winter and I would like to point out that woman it's cold.

451
00:25:42,248 --> 00:25:47,250
Speaker 1: it's cold but Maybe cuz I think Kate has never actually seen Ava.

452
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,130
Speaker 1: I think we got to have one of those old-school anime marathons like days of yore.

453
00:25:52,230 --> 00:26:01,730
Speaker 0: But I was just thinking recently like yesterday if they're because you're looking at Lord of the Rings on the go I would much rather watch all three Lord of the Rings movies because I've only seen some of them like twice.

454
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,178
Speaker 1: I've only seen the third one once.

455
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:06,686
Speaker 0: Oh my god, but I've seen the third one three times.

456
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:10,058
Speaker 1: I've seen the first one three times.

457
00:26:10,098 --> 00:26:13,490
Speaker 0: So the first one two times and the second one one and a half time.

458
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,369
Speaker 1: Why don't we just watch Star Wars?

459
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:20,642
Speaker 0: Because I've seen each of those 25 times each but I need to make it to 30 each.

460
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:24,346
Speaker 0: I'm just making I just make it up numbers But I'm probably not far off.

461
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:28,362
Speaker 1: Then we'll watch snatch followed by attack the gas station.

462
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,746
Speaker 0: I've seen attack the gas nation.

463
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:30,810
Speaker 0: I think seven times.

464
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:32,661
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure that.

465
00:26:34,356 --> 00:26:36,561
Speaker 0: okay, so We need an anime.

466
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:37,330
Speaker 0: What do we talk about?

467
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:45,396
Speaker 1: we talked about a while ago of slayers because this TV series because surprisingly copy rezo Scott had Never seen slayers.

468
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:46,703
Speaker 0: I saw like an episode or two.

469
00:26:46,763 --> 00:26:48,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was one of my favorite shows.

470
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,657
Speaker 1: So we we got it.

471
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:52,850
Speaker 1: We watched it all back when we had no responsibilities and infinite money.

472
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,218
Speaker 1: You know those days are long gone.

473
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:54,983
Speaker 0: Copy rezo.

474
00:26:55,627 --> 00:26:58,505
Speaker 1: God Slayer still wins the award for one one.

475
00:26:59,832 --> 00:27:04,569
Speaker 1: It has a character who pretty much right away takes a sweat drop and beat someone over the head with it.

476
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:18,407
Speaker 1: Yep And to when the evil bad guy at the in like the climactic part is doing his ritual and the good guys come to stop Him he just runs away into another room locks the door and finishes the ritual immediately.

477
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:19,410
Speaker 0: I love that part.

478
00:27:20,451 --> 00:27:21,597
Speaker 0: That's how it's got to go down.

479
00:27:21,898 --> 00:27:22,300
Speaker 0: villains.

480
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:24,290
Speaker 0: learn none of the Sharks lasers shit.

481
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:24,768
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:35,350
Speaker 0: If you're gonna set off a bomb or send a drill to the middle of the earth or fire a laser at the moon Fucking push the goddamn button immediately as soon as you can because otherwise it ain't gonna happen.

483
00:27:37,231 --> 00:27:42,308
Speaker 1: But we talked about the slayers TV show, I don't think we talked a lot about the OAVs.

484
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:49,246
Speaker 0: and okay Here's the thing with slayers right if you watch slayers slayers next or slayers try.

485
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,230
Speaker 0: these are TV series.

486
00:27:50,331 --> 00:27:51,569
Speaker 0: They have a lot of episodes, right?

487
00:27:52,051 --> 00:28:02,241
Speaker 0: They follow the story adventures of Lena inverse and her companions gallery and zellows and Amelia Amelia, Prince Phil, Prince Phil and such and such.

488
00:28:02,362 --> 00:28:10,950
Speaker 0: it is a D&D adventuring party plus mostly comedy Going around fighting villains, you know having inns get destroyed, etc.

489
00:28:11,331 --> 00:28:24,564
Speaker 0: Right, but there are also slayers OAVs and slayers movies and the slayers OAVs and slayers movies are also about Lena inverse but they are not about Zellows or Amelia or gallery or any of those other characters.

490
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,030
Speaker 0: They're basically not even there.

491
00:28:26,211 --> 00:28:30,010
Speaker 1: This is from way before she met any of those people.

492
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:33,281
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was paddling around with Naga the white serpent.

493
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:34,966
Speaker 0: Naga the serpent.

494
00:28:35,147 --> 00:28:35,990
Speaker 0: Are you gonna make the laugh?

495
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:37,356
Speaker 1: I don't think I can.

496
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:38,643
Speaker 0: I think I've got something like this.

497
00:28:38,663 --> 00:28:40,574
Speaker 0: I Can't do it.

498
00:28:40,775 --> 00:28:43,290
Speaker 1: The thing is, you know these people it's the Fujiko laugh.

499
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:44,170
Speaker 1: It's there.

500
00:28:44,491 --> 00:28:49,950
Speaker 1: There are so many evil women in anime with with like the finger next to the mouth and they make that laugh.

501
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:56,710
Speaker 0: She's one of those Laughter and she has giant boobs which aren't there for perverted reasons.

502
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,439
Speaker 1: They're there for fun unless you read the manga.

503
00:28:58,761 --> 00:29:00,450
Speaker 0: if you read the manga that they're for perverted reasons.

504
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:07,190
Speaker 0: But then again the manga also uses Lena inverses non-existent breasts for you know perverted reasons.

505
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:09,057
Speaker 0: You know all the animations.

506
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:12,570
Speaker 0: they take the breasts and they keep them there and use them for comedic reasons.

507
00:29:13,892 --> 00:29:17,390
Speaker 0: It's like in manga perverted jokes about tiny breasts.

508
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,850
Speaker 0: Anime hilarious jokes about tiny breasts.

509
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,396
Speaker 0: I mean actually the way how they did it.

510
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:35,238
Speaker 1: the way I would describe it is thusly if you watch the slayers TV shows They're really funny But there's a story and it's kind of like it kind of edges into serious territory And it never times that time.

511
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:42,250
Speaker 1: it never gets all the way serious But it gets real close and there's moments where you forget it's a comedy and you get really into it.

512
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,544
Speaker 1: You're like, oh man, and then suddenly something stupid happens.

513
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:48,473
Speaker 1: and oh crap slayers Adventure story.

514
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:59,186
Speaker 0: but in the parts of the adventure story where there isn't great tension and great immediate evil and stuff like that They as the plot progresses they toss in jokes and that's how it.

515
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:08,158
Speaker 1: that's why I know granted It has the syndrome where you know a lot of shows rollercoaster between really funny and really serious And they kind of skirt a lot like Fullmetal Alchemist did that a lot.

516
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:10,405
Speaker 1: Yep, like our mom's dead.

517
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:12,069
Speaker 1: Oh, he's really short.

518
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:16,190
Speaker 0: Yeah Slayers doesn't do that so bad.

519
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,333
Speaker 1: Well, it gets.

520
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:24,318
Speaker 1: it does that more and more as you fought like slayers next is more serious than slayers, but also funnier layers.

521
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:46,029
Speaker 1: try is Really really really goofy at times and yet at the same time it goes so far into serious territory that you really don't Know what you're watching, but then instead of gradually coming back into funny They pretty much will give you the plot of an epic anime and then Effectively ruin it suddenly with a really lame joke.

522
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,920
Speaker 0: But anyway, it still works though today.

523
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,486
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about specifically.

524
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:51,309
Speaker 0: I think you want it.

525
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:57,606
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about slayers the movie slayers the motion picture the slayers movie period.

526
00:30:57,646 --> 00:31:00,562
Speaker 0: if there's more than one slayers movie We're talking about the first one.

527
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:01,449
Speaker 1: This is the one, you know.

528
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:04,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's called slayers the motion picture.

529
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:05,670
Speaker 0: That's what it's called.

530
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:06,332
Speaker 1: This was.

531
00:31:06,352 --> 00:31:11,147
Speaker 1: I mean if anyone in America talks about the slayers movie they're talking about this now.

532
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:17,290
Speaker 1: the slayers OAVs and movies especially the OAVs are a lot like this.

533
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,704
Speaker 1: They have a different feel a different tone a different theme and it is not.

534
00:31:20,764 --> 00:31:24,443
Speaker 1: it's Lena the same character you know and love but I don't know.

535
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:33,370
Speaker 1: everything's kind of Goofier a little more perverted a little funnier, but not it's not really funny or just a different kind of funny.

536
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:38,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it there isn't so much serious action going on because you're only gonna you know, it's gonna be over so quickly.

537
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,910
Speaker 0: They just sort of tell as many jokes as they can and cuz naga the serpent there.

538
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,981
Speaker 0: She's pretty much only useful for comedy except for that.

539
00:31:46,002 --> 00:31:46,805
Speaker 0: You know, it's basically.

540
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:51,170
Speaker 0: it's sort of like a buddy movie, you know You know, it's one of those instead of a party adventure.

541
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:57,650
Speaker 0: It's sort of a buddy tale where you know, I'm the good guy trying to save the day whatever and funny shit happens to me.

542
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:02,850
Speaker 0: Oh, but there's this bitch who comes along and fucks with me and makes fun of me and I fight with her.

543
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:07,447
Speaker 0: But in the end when the real villain comes along we team up and then we make fun of each other again.

544
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:07,729
Speaker 0: the end.

545
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:21,366
Speaker 1: Now the slayers motion picture that we're talking about kind of skirts the line between the OAVs and the show because the OAVs I mean, I think my favorite one is slayers gorgeous, which uh, let's say the giant golems.

546
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:36,148
Speaker 1: It is not the most plotacular Anime, it's also pretty short But the motion picture is goony and funny and in fact I'll get to this but it's actually super full of all these inside jokes.

547
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:43,564
Speaker 1: a lot of them I think are actually dub specific but there's a lot of kind of anime industry crossover inside jokes in the slayers like

548
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,567
Speaker 0: all the octopuses

549
00:32:45,269 --> 00:33:04,399
Speaker 1: or the slime path or or Joyrock but At the same time the plot of the slayers movie comedy aside Is actually really kind of touching and sad and well done and it's it's kind of this Two-headed beast where it's a really fun movie.

550
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,290
Speaker 0: Let me tell you this the plot here that rim thinks is so touching.

551
00:33:07,592 --> 00:33:08,621
Speaker 1: It has touching moments.

552
00:33:08,823 --> 00:33:11,977
Speaker 0: I gotta say ready They're stuck on this island.

553
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:13,201
Speaker 0: and it's why?

554
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,265
Speaker 1: why are they at this island?

555
00:33:14,306 --> 00:33:15,370
Speaker 0: I forget doesn't matter.

556
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:19,240
Speaker 1: Alright, so this movie actually this movie kind of opens the way.

557
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,350
Speaker 1: a lot of those like we have this show and it's super popular.

558
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:26,692
Speaker 1: We're gonna make the high-budget Movie.

559
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:27,538
Speaker 1: it has the set.

560
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:36,340
Speaker 1: actually actually watching the beginning of it I felt a lot like when I watch those Sailor Moon movies back in the day just in terms of Obviously, they're just having this high-budget thing.

561
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:36,943
Speaker 1: Check it out.

562
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:38,390
Speaker 1: Oh, look, it's Lena inverse.

563
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:42,806
Speaker 1: We're gonna have her come on screen in the epic way that you all expect and then we're gonna start the movie.

564
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:50,770
Speaker 1: Yep, and Long story short stuff happens and then her and Naga go on this kind of discount trip to a hot spring on an island.

565
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:56,316
Speaker 0: Alright the hot spring yes me pros island I think it's me pros Island it.

566
00:33:56,376 --> 00:33:58,664
Speaker 1: well you realize that it's just promise.

567
00:33:59,466 --> 00:33:59,767
Speaker 0: I know.

568
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know Oh, that was a spoiler.

569
00:34:04,172 --> 00:34:08,867
Speaker 1: In the ancient language of the elves the word me pros means a promise to be kept.

570
00:34:09,288 --> 00:34:17,510
Speaker 0: Yes Anyway on this island they are you know, there's inns exploding and there's a problem with octopuses and all sorts of other things going on.

571
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:22,510
Speaker 0: But primarily they get accosted by the fifth strongest man on the island.

572
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:25,860
Speaker 1: I believe I am the fourth strongest man on me pros Island.

573
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,030
Speaker 0: Yes, and well, you know you wonder huh?

574
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,199
Speaker 0: He's the fifth strongest man.

575
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,210
Speaker 0: Who's the first strongest man?

576
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,591
Speaker 0: I don't know.

577
00:34:32,333 --> 00:34:46,060
Speaker 0: and apparently all these different strongest men of the island are all working for you know The first strongest man or you assume so and you know They fight the fifth strongest man and the fourth and then third and a second and then eventually Surprise it's the first.

578
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:58,450
Speaker 0: and what who the first is is the way it's revealed I think is incredibly well done and It's foreshadowed in one of those in one of those clever ways where the foreshadowing was there all along.

579
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,115
Speaker 0: You saw it all along.

580
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:11,570
Speaker 0: There's no way you could have known but as soon as they reveal you think back and you give them the finger Who the first strongest man on me pros out is see the thing is this movie?

581
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:17,429
Speaker 1: The tone is just so different from every other slayers thing and that it's it's kind of got this cut like.

582
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:34,350
Speaker 1: there's this Undercurrent where the show is goonie and for the first half of this movie It is just they show up and these guys appear and this little whiny guy And then this big bustly guy goes I'm the fifth strongest man on me pros Island and then they fight and then there's sea cucumbers and it's explosion

583
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:35,754
Speaker 0: and it's

584
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,326
Speaker 1: just dumb and crazy.

585
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:43,819
Speaker 1: but yet There's all these like quiet Eerie moments and it's just undercurrent of.

586
00:35:43,939 --> 00:35:45,965
Speaker 1: there's actually something bad going on here.

587
00:35:46,006 --> 00:35:47,470
Speaker 1: There's something serious in this movie.

588
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,404
Speaker 1: There's something not quite right and I don't know.

589
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:55,356
Speaker 0: islands has an evil secret And it's not just oh.

590
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:56,581
Speaker 1: the evil secret is the plot in.

591
00:35:56,621 --> 00:36:09,970
Speaker 0: the evil secret is actually, you know There's a lot of those cliche like one-shot adventure plots where oh, there's a mysterious dungeon There's a curse on a item or whatever and this is one of those plots.

592
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:16,015
Speaker 0: But it's actually not cheesy like it would be easy to make it cheesy But it's actually.

593
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:20,133
Speaker 0: it's not a bad little one-shot adventure plot It's it's pretty good.

594
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,622
Speaker 1: And also they the way they resolve it.

595
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,730
Speaker 1: in the end it actually it doesn't matter.

596
00:36:24,831 --> 00:36:34,710
Speaker 1: It's not like oh, well, this changes the can of slayers and all that but they definitely Introduce An element I don't want to really spoil because this movie is really worth watching.

597
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,650
Speaker 1: But it involves gallery's magic sword and maybe his family's lineage in some way.

598
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:40,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

599
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:42,370
Speaker 0: it's one of those things where you know.

600
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:51,257
Speaker 0: It's like if you have seen other slayers, then you can sort of like take this hint and maybe you know Infer something about it.

601
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:52,764
Speaker 0: Like maybe they're trying to say something.

602
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:57,190
Speaker 0: maybe it's sort of like an inside joke And if you don't get the inside joke, it doesn't really take away from it at all.

603
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,768
Speaker 0: You don't even notice, you know, you just kind of like oh dude to do.

604
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:05,248
Speaker 1: But really this movie despite all the dumb humor is actually it really has this kind of.

605
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:14,130
Speaker 0: it Feels like a serious movie even though you know It's not is a above average classic anime movie that any anime fan should see.

606
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:15,635
Speaker 1: It's also really kind of.

607
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:21,056
Speaker 1: it's very slow paced and very just kind of Atmospheric and just.

608
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:23,946
Speaker 0: it is slow paced but then it's also not long.

609
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:24,890
Speaker 0: It's it's kind of weird.

610
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:25,859
Speaker 0: It's like you won't.

611
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:34,610
Speaker 0: if you watch this movie You won't feel like you were sitting there for a very long time But you'll feel like you saw a lot in a very short amount of time, but nothing feels hurried.

612
00:37:34,912 --> 00:37:37,829
Speaker 0: It's a I can't really imagine it doing it much better than that.

613
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:49,424
Speaker 1: Now one thing a lot of people really seem to remember from this movie and I just I see it all the time maybe not so much now, but Being an anime fan and you know the late 90s and all that sort of thing.

614
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:52,680
Speaker 1: when this movie was you know Slayers was big for a long time.

615
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:58,610
Speaker 1: and now I realize a lot of people Haven't seen slayers don't even know what it is or they vaguely like they see it they go.

616
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,882
Speaker 1: Oh, that's that slayers thing, but no one really watches it.

617
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:09,137
Speaker 1: and a lot of people really don't remember this movie, but The song they play at the end of this movie for some reason I remember it being kind of a big deal.

618
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:14,760
Speaker 1: like every anime fan loved this song and listen to it all the time and It was just midnight blue, you know, Megumi Hashibara.

619
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,563
Speaker 1: She's all a million.

620
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:24,375
Speaker 1: She did all the slayers music pretty much Except that one god-awful in English song from Valgaav in slayers tribe My baby.

621
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:27,327
Speaker 1: you don't know how much I love you me.

622
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:28,130
Speaker 1: I love you.

623
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:31,497
Speaker 0: Okay, and I don't remember that song.

624
00:38:31,598 --> 00:38:33,042
Speaker 1: No, I played that song for you.

625
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:34,607
Speaker 0: Don't play it for me again.

626
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:38,715
Speaker 0: Sounds bad Sounds very bad But the movie.

627
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:43,079
Speaker 1: actually if you don't want to watch the movie, you don't get what I haven't seen it You don't get like oh what.

628
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:44,069
Speaker 1: how could it be this?

629
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:49,183
Speaker 1: Slow-paced serious movie and yet it's full of explosions and I'm the fourth strongest man on me.

630
00:38:49,224 --> 00:38:51,330
Speaker 1: pros Island secret cucumber smash.

631
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:56,666
Speaker 1: Listen to that song and that song kind of really sums up the mood of this movie.

632
00:38:57,288 --> 00:38:57,469
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

633
00:38:57,931 --> 00:38:58,937
Speaker 0: Well, I just looked it up.

634
00:38:58,977 --> 00:39:04,545
Speaker 0: You can get the digitally remastered in 5.1 version of the slayers motion picture for $18 in Amazon.

635
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,527
Speaker 0: All right, that is totally worth it, but it's four dollars and eighty cents for a used coffee.

636
00:39:10,888 --> 00:39:13,754
Speaker 1: That is Also totally worth it.

637
00:39:13,814 --> 00:39:14,937
Speaker 0: Yes, very much.

638
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:18,949
Speaker 0: So I mean no reason not to get this one and you can Netflix it for sure.

639
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:24,813
Speaker 1: It's not the greatest movie ever made it's no Akira It's no.

640
00:39:24,833 --> 00:39:25,094
Speaker 0: me is.

641
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:33,789
Speaker 1: a lot of my enjoyment of this movie is definitely nostalgia And also just my love of slayers and wanting to see more slayers because I've seen.

642
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:35,355
Speaker 1: yeah I think here's I can see.

643
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:36,219
Speaker 0: I think you're really.

644
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:38,530
Speaker 0: I don't know if this should be the first slayers you ever watch.

645
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,530
Speaker 0: I think you should watch some other slayers before you add to the Slayer.

646
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:47,410
Speaker 1: But then again this was for a lot of people in our generation the first layers that they saw because it was marketed.

647
00:39:47,995 --> 00:40:01,310
Speaker 1: It was marketed heavily and a lot of people Oh the slayers movie and they'd see a slayers movie and then they'd see a pile of VHS tapes and they we were poor and it was like 30 bucks for four episodes of a subtitled anime.

648
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,299
Speaker 1: Yep, so they just buy the movie and watch that.

649
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:03,881
Speaker 1: and there were.

650
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,770
Speaker 0: there were slayers you could watch first.

651
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,355
Speaker 0: You can watch that slayers gorgeous first.

652
00:40:07,395 --> 00:40:08,720
Speaker 0: That's not a good first slayers.

653
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,964
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it's not.

654
00:40:10,084 --> 00:40:11,729
Speaker 0: but there's also better first layers.

655
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:16,046
Speaker 0: I think you should at least start watching the TV show a little bit like maybe four episodes.

656
00:40:16,086 --> 00:40:18,919
Speaker 0: at least then you can watch this Movie because you'd understand the character is.

657
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:19,482
Speaker 0: now it's going.

658
00:40:19,522 --> 00:40:26,669
Speaker 1: this is one of those movies were really I mean I think everyone should see eskaflowne and cowboy bebop and slayers and all these you know, just important shows.

659
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:35,670
Speaker 1: and the OAVs of slayers are really only for people who really like the humor of slayers and That sort of thing and really like these OAVs because they're goonie and they're silly.

660
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:36,132
Speaker 1: But I think the

661
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:48,095
Speaker 0: only reason that it really shouldn't be the first slayers you watch is because a lot of the jokes like Exploding ins and stuff, you know They only happen once or twice in the movie and you'd only laugh at them as hard as you should If you knew that.

662
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,062
Speaker 0: yeah, that's a slayers in Joe.

663
00:40:50,122 --> 00:40:50,624
Speaker 0: It's a trope.

664
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:51,106
Speaker 0: Yes.

665
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:52,070
Speaker 0: It's a trope of slayers.

666
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,285
Speaker 0: So you have to watch the TV show to get the tropes that you see.

667
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:57,998
Speaker 0: you can laugh at them in the movie Plus the movie really?

668
00:40:58,018 --> 00:40:58,842
Speaker 1: I don't know.

669
00:40:58,862 --> 00:41:01,641
Speaker 1: I Don't know what I was even gonna say there.

670
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:08,278
Speaker 0: Awesome Slayers movie me pros Island High quality if nothing else.

671
00:41:08,358 --> 00:41:10,304
Speaker 1: It's one of those kind of not.

672
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,250
Speaker 1: it's not like a revolutionary anime movie.

673
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:17,945
Speaker 1: Important because it was a very popular and very well-known movie when it came out.

674
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:25,150
Speaker 1: and I feel like if you are Someone who wants to have seen that, you know the full breadth of everything that there is anime out there.

675
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:28,589
Speaker 1: There aren't a lot of anime movies that are like this.

676
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:32,981
Speaker 1: This movie kind of stands out among the many anime movies out there.

677
00:41:33,362 --> 00:41:34,365
Speaker 0: It's kind of strange.

678
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:41,939
Speaker 0: Like if I if I just sort of Think in my brain what other anime movie was like this I don't come up with any but if I feel in my gut.

679
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,117
Speaker 0: it feels like every anime movie is like this and yet They're not and it's.

680
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:47,204
Speaker 1: I don't know why that is.

681
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:50,177
Speaker 0: I don't know But maybe that's why it's so great.

682
00:41:50,237 --> 00:41:52,706
Speaker 0: It's like this is the core of the awesomeness.

683
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:57,642
Speaker 0: That was the anime Feeling that we had when we got into anime like 98 99.

684
00:41:57,642 --> 00:42:09,593
Speaker 0: Yes, this movie definitely you will feel the Night the late 90s anime fan nostalgia Yep, and if you weren't an anime fan in the late 90s watch this and you'll see what it was like to be an anime fan In the late 90s.

685
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:11,179
Speaker 0: and the dub ain't so bad.

686
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,443
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean the dub.

687
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:13,407
Speaker 1: this was Lisa Ortiz.

688
00:42:13,467 --> 00:42:17,522
Speaker 1: She was you know Yeah, yeah, she was on our magic game.

689
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,287
Speaker 1: She's really awesome.

690
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,819
Speaker 0: But Titles are probably a little bit better.

691
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,310
Speaker 0: But you know, the dub isn't a bad dub.

692
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:30,229
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is this and I think we've said this before a lot but dubs from this era We're not technically as good as dubs today.

693
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:45,611
Speaker 1: But at the same time even though they weren't as accurate and they weren't as technically well done and there were problems with them I feel like in the end they were a lot better than the dubs of today on average and not It's definitely not the nostalgia talking I think there was I don't know.

694
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:58,010
Speaker 1: I think that partly just because a lot of the people who were doing the dubs back then were kind of into the Anime that certain groups of dub actors just they got into the spirit of it And it felt like they had a lot more fun making these dubs than some people now have making dubs.

695
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,797
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe you should just watch both.

696
00:43:00,898 --> 00:43:02,625
Speaker 0: I mean it's a fun enough movie.

697
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:03,690
Speaker 0: I've seen it multiple times.

698
00:43:03,811 --> 00:43:04,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen it dubbed.

699
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:05,489
Speaker 1: I've seen it sobbed.

700
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:13,683
Speaker 1: I the the sob is technically better But the dub has a lot of heart and I think a lot of new anime Has a lot of different jokes - yes, it does.

701
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:20,244
Speaker 1: There's a. the dub has some Late 90s anime inside jokes that you may or may not pick up on.

702
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:21,869
Speaker 0: It's it's worth it though.

703
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,121
Speaker 0: Alright, we got anything else to say?

704
00:43:24,242 --> 00:43:25,028
