1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,629
Speaker 0: It's Monday, November 21st, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:18,405
Speaker 0: Tonight, we try a new bea- Let's do this again.

3
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,173
Speaker 0: Man, we had a weekend of geek.

4
00:00:21,735 --> 00:00:23,200
Speaker 1: You could say it was a geek-end.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 0: No, no, you really can't.

6
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:26,491
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just saying it's a geek-end.

7
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:28,440
Speaker 0: 'Cause then I would have to administer a beating.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,920
Speaker 1: Oh, but you sure didn't do that this weekend.

9
00:00:32,202 --> 00:00:37,360
Speaker 0: I administered a couple beatings along the fronts of Tigris and Euphrates and Alhambra.

10
00:00:37,761 --> 00:00:42,258
Speaker 1: I also administered a beating in Tigris and Euphrates, and what was the other game I won?

11
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:42,539
Speaker 1: St.

12
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:42,880
Speaker 1: Petersburg?

13
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also had a Carcassonne.

14
00:00:46,764 --> 00:00:49,274
Speaker 1: I won a bunch of video games, like the Mario Kart.

15
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:50,859
Speaker 0: I also won a bunch of video games.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, we won a lot and other people didn't win so much.

17
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:55,507
Speaker 1: Eh?

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:58,408
Speaker 1: And in D&D, everyone wins.

20
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:00,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like college again.

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,260
Speaker 0: We stayed up until 4 in the morning playing a one-off Dungeons & Dragons game that we just made characters, went, and completed it all at once.

22
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:08,973
Speaker 1: And we finished it the next day.

23
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:09,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

24
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,139
Speaker 0: I Gotta say I feel the college coursing through my veins again.

25
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:19,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, if only we had like one more person living here, we could just constantly do that.

26
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:20,437
Speaker 1: Yeah.

27
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,220
Speaker 1: Every freaking day.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,198
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, come visit us.

29
00:01:23,801 --> 00:01:24,142
Speaker 1: Yeah.

30
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:25,285
Speaker 0: And play some board games.

31
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:31,439
Speaker 1: If you like geekery, and you're a geek, and you're not socially inept or smelly, come on down.

32
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:38,513
Speaker 0: So, uh, I never thought I'd have to say the name again on this podcast, but Jack Thompson.

33
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:40,520
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Jack Thompson.

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,400
Speaker 0: Alabama revoked his right to practice law because he's an asshat.

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,042
Speaker 1: Way to go.

36
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:49,091
Speaker 1: One more awesome judge on the awesome judge list.

37
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:52,180
Speaker 0: Not only, he, what happened was he was on that case.

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:52,983
Speaker 0: That's in Alabama.

39
00:01:53,024 --> 00:01:55,237
Speaker 0: That's where the original Grand Theft Auto makes people kill.

40
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:55,760
Speaker 0: case was.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Speaker 0: And there, he was really spending most of the time on the case defending his own actions both in and out of the courtroom instead of trying the case itself.

42
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:09,780
Speaker 0: So he's decided to resign from the case, so the case wouldn't be about him, and it might have a chance of winning.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,748
Speaker 0: The judge refused to let him resign so that the judge could write an 18-page dissertation on why Jack Thompson is a terrible person and a bad lawyer.

44
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:18,671
Speaker 0: 18 pages?

45
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,894
Speaker 1: 18 pages.

46
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,718
Speaker 1: Is that a publicly available 18 pages?

47
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,312
Speaker 0: Uh, if it is, I'm sure someone will link to it so shortly.

48
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:28,359
Speaker 1: I'll be reading that.

49
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:34,419
Speaker 1: With much humor, but hopefully there aren't too much lawyer talks in it.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:40,899
Speaker 0: But he can, oh, he sent a letter in response to the judge calling him various names.

51
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:42,825
Speaker 0: Ooooh.

52
00:02:42,946 --> 00:02:44,420
Speaker 0: In typical Jack Thompson style.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's so mature, you know, I mean, look at it, Jack Thompson can't even do his job without calling people names, you know?

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,380
Speaker 1: No wonder he can't believe that someone can play a violent video game with without killing anyone.

55
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,739
Speaker 1: All you know is yourself.

56
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,176
Speaker 1: Dum-dum-dum.

57
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:17,660
Speaker 1: So, um, apparently, I don't know how true this is, but the rumor is that on Tuesday Microsoft is actually going to open up the Office file format for real.

58
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,073
Speaker 0: Shits!

59
00:03:20,462 --> 00:03:34,991
Speaker 1: We don't know how real this is, but if they do it for sure, OpenOffice and Abby Word and everything are gonna go a whole lot awthomer, and Microsoft Word isn't gonna get awthomer.

60
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,399
Speaker 1: It's gonna stay the same crap it is.

61
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:44,700
Speaker 1: Well, the thing about it that makes it great is not so much that people with Microsoft Office can send documents to people without, But

62
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,847
Speaker 0: now, me with my OpenOffice, people

63
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:56,243
Speaker 1: who are using Microsoft Office who still have a pile of documents in Office format, you can go say, "Hey, bitch, use numeric," and they'll say, "Wait, but my spreadsheets are all in Excel,".

64
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:58,167
Speaker 1: and you can say, "It's all right.

65
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,409
Speaker 1: We can open them,

66
00:03:59,489 --> 00:03:59,770
Speaker 1: bitches.".

67
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,797
Speaker 0: So, uh, the Sony DRM.

68
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:05,523
Speaker 1: Again?

69
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,650
Speaker 0: It's over now.

70
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:09,324
Speaker 0: They're being sued by everyone.

71
00:04:09,545 --> 00:04:11,334
Speaker 1: Well, the EFF, of course.

72
00:04:11,515 --> 00:04:12,480
Speaker 0: The state of Texas.

73
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,425
Speaker 1: Some country, I forget what country.

74
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,368
Speaker 0: I think it was Germany.

75
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,211
Speaker 1: Germany, maybe?

76
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:17,773
Speaker 1: Sounds right.

77
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:19,700
Speaker 0: The state of Florida's thinking about suing them.

78
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,608
Speaker 1: I don't know why Elliot Spitzer hasn't made a move.

79
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,856
Speaker 1: He's a little slow on the trigger.

80
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:23,540
Speaker 1: Maybe he's busy.

81
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:24,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, he might be.

82
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,299
Speaker 1: Running for governor, you know.

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Speaker 0: But, uh, the one in Texas is interesting because they have this anti-spyware, anti-malware law, and Sony would be liable at a hundred thousand dollars per infraction.

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,970
Speaker 1: They'd have to count the infractions in the state of Texas.

85
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:43,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and multiply that by a hundred thousand.

86
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:46,367
Speaker 1: How are they gonna count the infractions, though?

87
00:04:46,387 --> 00:04:47,431
Speaker 0: I don't know.

88
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,977
Speaker 0: I guess people come forward and say, "Yeah, I'm

89
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,379
Speaker 0: infected.".

90
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if he was that way, it would be a very low number.

91
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:59,032
Speaker 0: No, no, because I could see a campaign of geeks going around, putting this CD in every computer they can find, and then reporting them.

92
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,242
Speaker 1: I think it only counts if it was done before the suit.

93
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,992
Speaker 0: Nah, because they haven't recalled all the CDs yet.

94
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,317
Speaker 1: I thought they did recall them all.

95
00:05:06,337 --> 00:05:07,260
Speaker 0: No, they recalled them.

96
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,889
Speaker 0: A lot of them were still in circulation.

97
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:15,160
Speaker 1: Oh, some guy today said he, uh, tried to buy one on Amazon so he could test it out, you know, because he's a security guy.

98
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

99
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:30,060
Speaker 1: He wanted to test it out in some Windows box to see what it did, and he got a thing from Amazon that was like, "The CD has been, like, you know, you know, recalled or discontinued or something, you know, if you want a real one, do this,".

100
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:31,375
Speaker 1: and such.

101
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:44,360
Speaker 0: Even better, a lot of people have pointed out that not only is this a terrible rootkit, and not only is this pretty much the worst thing Sony could ever have done, but it can be circumvented by a magic marker or a piece of tape.

102
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,527
Speaker 1: Most DRM can be circumvented that way.

103
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,068
Speaker 0: Well, all DRM can.

104
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:54,950
Speaker 1: Because they add a data track, and if you write over the data track, then the CD, any CD player will just skip right over.

105
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,596
Speaker 0: Or, you know, there's one step further than that.

106
00:05:56,636 --> 00:05:57,860
Speaker 0: There's that whole analog hole.

107
00:05:58,901 --> 00:05:59,423
Speaker 1: Oh, the analog hole.

108
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,975
Speaker 0: You know, if I can see it with my eyes, I can record it.

109
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:02,940
Speaker 1: See, that's what they're doing now.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,597
Speaker 1: See, the problem here is all these DRMs with CDs and things, is they're trying to put DRM on the medium.

111
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:10,940
Speaker 1: when the device is, devices are all wide open.

112
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:16,300
Speaker 1: But the next gen, they're coming out with these not-so-open devices, and we're gonna see how well that works out.

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,560
Speaker 1: Because now we're gonna have to crack a device, and then crack a data.

114
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:27,340
Speaker 0: That's fine, though, because all we have to do really is have the output of the, because at some point it comes into a format that a human can perceive.

115
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's true, but you know, we might end up having to, like, put a microphone in front of a speaker.

116
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,419
Speaker 0: That's right, that actually works really well.

117
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:35,924
Speaker 0: And think of it this way.

118
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:41,900
Speaker 0: It's alright, you have some loss once, and then now you have a perfect digital copy to spread forever.

119
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,452
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, it's not perfect.

120
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:47,460
Speaker 0: It's not that bad, though.

121
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's worse than what we're used to, and people will be kind of upset.

122
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,564
Speaker 0: Most people wouldn't notice.

123
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:56,980
Speaker 0: You lose more from compressing an MP3 to 128 than you do by putting a microphone in front of a good speaker.

124
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here's the thing, most people are using shit microphones in front of shit speakers that are already outputting crap because they're crap.

125
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,400
Speaker 0: They're gonna make, like, in the speaker wire that's going to the speaker and plug it in in some sort of--.

126
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,739
Speaker 1: No, because that's what they're talking about is, in the next gen of hardware, they're gonna make--.

127
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:21,920
Speaker 0: Um, I point out that at some point, no matter how encrypted it is, at some point there's a RAM DAC where it converts whatever encrypted signal into, uh, pulses.

128
00:07:22,883 --> 00:07:23,898
Speaker 0: And those pulses are raw sound.

129
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,440
Speaker 1: They're gonna put that in the speaker.

130
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,280
Speaker 0: That's fine, then there's some sort of thing driving the cone in the speaker, right?

131
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:29,979
Speaker 1: Yep.

132
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,160
Speaker 0: You take that and you plug it into a RAM DAC.

133
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:33,120
Speaker 1: I guess you could.

134
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,164
Speaker 0: That's all you have to do.

135
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:35,168
Speaker 0: The analog hole?

136
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,660
Speaker 0: Unless they get chips in my brain, there's nothing they can do to stop me.

137
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:45,575
Speaker 1: I guess someone might take apart DRM speakers and, like, make machines that output to digi-- But people aren't gonna buy those, they're, you know, it's--.

138
00:07:47,081 --> 00:07:55,060
Speaker 1: It'll definitely down the amount of prolificness because you won't have people just ripping all their CDs with the push of a button in one program, you know?

139
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:01,180
Speaker 1: When you make it a whole lot more difficult, people still do it, people go through the effort, but far fewer will.

140
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:08,840
Speaker 1: And I think that if they do this, for real, and it works, that things like, you know, iTunes and allofmp3.com will make out more.

141
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,700
Speaker 1: Things that have less DRM and are easier.

142
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,840
Speaker 0: Well, allofmp3.com is illegal anyway.

143
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,260
Speaker 1: Technically kinda, sorta, maybe.

144
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,780
Speaker 0: It's legal in other countries.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,265
Speaker 1: Russia.

146
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:19,119
Speaker 1: But it's in it.

147
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:22,360
Speaker 0: Even in Russia, it's kinda dubious.

148
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,182
Speaker 1: Yeah.

149
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:24,890
Speaker 1: Thing is, they don't have the songs I want either.

150
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,840
Speaker 1: They have every song that everyone else wants.

151
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,840
Speaker 1: But they don't have, like, Eurobeat or anything.

152
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:30,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what?

153
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,819
Speaker 0: It's real easy to just pirate most of that.

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

155
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:43,530
Speaker 1: So, um, they're, uh, they're not calling the Scriptkitties "Scriptkitties" anymore, according to this article here.

156
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,649
Speaker 0: Well, uh, what are they calling them?

157
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,960
Speaker 0: They're calling them "Click

158
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:46,628
Speaker 0: Kids."

159
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,190
Speaker 0: That is not the proper term for that.

160
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:58,750
Speaker 1: Well, you see, they're talking about this new trend that I actually haven't heard of, so I'm not-- And I've only read this one article, but I think this feels like the kind of thing that's gonna get bigger.

161
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:06,510
Speaker 1: It used to be that if you were a real hacker, you would write tools and use tools and go to DefCon and break into all kinds of stuff.

162
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,329
Speaker 1: And you'd have a target, like a bank, and you would go for it, right?

163
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,390
Speaker 0: Then you had Scriptkitties.

164
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,150
Speaker 1: Then you had Scriptkitties who would just download the tools that the other guys made and use them.

165
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,869
Speaker 1: But usually you had to kinda know something to use the tools.

166
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:17,852
Speaker 0: All right, wait a minute.

167
00:09:17,893 --> 00:09:18,636
Speaker 0: So I take it.

168
00:09:18,676 --> 00:09:21,929
Speaker 0: this is kind of a-- I download a program that has two buttons.

169
00:09:22,331 --> 00:09:24,270
Speaker 0: It has two buttons and a space to put an IP address.

170
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:34,090
Speaker 1: Even worse, the crazy hackers are making websites that-- and they're only letting all the Clickkitties in.

171
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,970
Speaker 1: And basically all they do is visit a website and click, and it basically starts breaking stuff all over the internet.

172
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,012
Speaker 0: You know what?

173
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:45,630
Speaker 0: That's great, because in my eyes, the internet is still the Wild West, and, uh, yeah.

174
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's, you know, what are we gonna do about it?

175
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:52,410
Speaker 1: It's easy to stop a Scriptkitty who's, like, messing around at home.

176
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,855
Speaker 1: You just go find him and get him.

177
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:57,630
Speaker 1: When it's some guy clicking on a website, you don't know who clicked on it.

178
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:00,050
Speaker 1: The logs are held by the crazy hacker guy.

179
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:00,914
Speaker 0: You know what you have to do?

180
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,990
Speaker 0: You can't trust the information that's going over the interweb.

181
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,930
Speaker 1: That's for sure.

182
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,270
Speaker 0: You just have to assume that it's this amorphous, Wild West, horrible, barren wasteland with monsters and dragons about.

183
00:10:12,131 --> 00:10:16,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good thing that we're not giving the internet to other countries, because then this kind of stuff would really ruin us.

184
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,216
Speaker 1: Yeah.

185
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:25,470
Speaker 1: But we'll see how, if this trend really, you know, they start really calling them clickkitties, or if it just kind of stays back.

186
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,817
Speaker 0: You know, uh, I'm not calling them that.

187
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:29,123
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

188
00:10:29,143 --> 00:10:30,630
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm not bad.

189
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:36,370
Speaker 1: I will, but only if the trend really grows, because right now I don't see it so much, I just read one article about it.

190
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:45,870
Speaker 0: I don't see it so much either, because say you have a script like that somewhere, now there's a central place where all those kids are clicking, and all the attacks are coming from that one place.

191
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:46,489
Speaker 1: Yep.

192
00:10:46,672 --> 00:10:47,729
Speaker 0: It's easier to track it down.

193
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,702
Speaker 1: But I think that the guys setting up the places are a lot smarter than that.

194
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:52,710
Speaker 1: Like, they have a forum, and you need to register.

195
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,770
Speaker 0: Alright, but why would someone smart give tools to idiots to make idiocy about?

196
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,390
Speaker 1: The reason is because if I made a tool, right, and I make it, say, in this house, no one knows, I never get in trouble.

197
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,889
Speaker 1: But if you take the tool and use it, you get busted.

198
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:13,070
Speaker 1: They basically make things to do bad stuff, and then they get other people to do the bad stuff for them, like a mafia boss.

199
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:14,262
Speaker 0: Why even do it?

200
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:14,949
Speaker 0: You don't gain.

201
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,189
Speaker 1: Because you want to make mischief, because you're a dumbass.

202
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:19,887
Speaker 0: Oh, they're griefers.

203
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,234
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on what tool.

204
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:27,070
Speaker 1: They might try to get revenge on someone, they might have a monetary gain, you know, all kinds of things.

205
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:28,705
Speaker 1: But, you know.

206
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:29,603
Speaker 0: Yeah.

207
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:35,425
Speaker 0: So, uh, today is the 100th anniversary of the publication of E=MC^2.

208
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:38,509
Speaker 1: That's great.

209
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:47,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, in 1905, Einstein's fourth, uh, series of papers, general relativity, special relativity, all that cool stuff.

210
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,430
Speaker 1: And since then, still no unified theory.

211
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:54,048
Speaker 0: Kind of tough.

212
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,033
Speaker 1: Yep.

213
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,770
Speaker 0: We really still can't explain gravity so well.

214
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:00,470
Speaker 1: Got any ideas?

215
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:02,488
Speaker 0: Uh, you know what?

216
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:06,190
Speaker 0: Uh, my lord and savior Jesus Christ did it all.

217
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,281
Speaker 0: And, uh, yeah.

218
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:09,107
Speaker 0: That's it.

219
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:09,570
Speaker 0: It's magic.

220
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,630
Speaker 1: Actually, there's a gravity satellite probe thing they sent up recently.

221
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:14,879
Speaker 1: Yeah.

222
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,950
Speaker 1: It has the most perfect spheres ever made by humans in it.

223
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,450
Speaker 0: And they're trying to detect the quantum vortex around the Earth, the spacetime.

224
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:28,642
Speaker 1: Because if Einstein was right, then the Earth should be pulling on spacetime a little bit.

225
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:32,090
Speaker 1: so it should have, like, these creases of, like, spiraling a little bit.

226
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,020
Speaker 1: And not just a pit.

227
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:38,870
Speaker 0: Like, take your finger and put it into a bedsheet and then twist your finger and see how the sheets kind of twist around the finger?

228
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:39,326
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,809
Speaker 0: The Earth is supposedly doing that to spacetime around it.

230
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:50,850
Speaker 1: And if it's not, and it's just making a, like, you know, just put a bowling ball on a bedsheet and it just goes plump and makes a pit, if it does that, that means Einstein was a little bit wrong.

231
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:51,385
Speaker 1: Yeah.

232
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:55,322
Speaker 1: People are gonna make it, if it's really that way, people are gonna be like, "Oh my god!

233
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,385
Speaker 1: He was holy crap wrong!

234
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:57,087
Speaker 1: The whole thing's thrown

235
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:57,227
Speaker 1: out!".

236
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:58,090
Speaker 1: But that's 'cause they're idiots.

237
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:00,029
Speaker 1: It just means he was a little bit wrong.

238
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:02,630
Speaker 1: I'm betting on right, though.

239
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:03,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

240
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:08,490
Speaker 0: I mean, it's been a hundred years and we've still got mostly Einstein.

241
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,735
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

242
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:14,445
Speaker 1: I would definitely bet on, uh, winning.

243
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:15,810
Speaker 1: Correctness.

244
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:17,969
Speaker 0: So TiVo's making a good move.

245
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:24,950
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, TiVo finally doing something smart to make up for all the crap they're doing making their service worse than MythTV.

246
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:25,790
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:33,090
Speaker 0: I mean, if they do this right, basically, anyone who has one of these new TiVos, anything they've recorded, they can just pop down onto their iPod video.

248
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:33,631
Speaker 0: Yep.

249
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,650
Speaker 1: That's pretty terrific.

250
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:37,749
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought PSP also.

251
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:39,337
Speaker 0: Uh, possibly.

252
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:40,003
Speaker 0: I didn't read that.

253
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:40,689
Speaker 0: Yep, PSP.

254
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:42,615
Speaker 1: Yep.

255
00:13:42,716 --> 00:13:47,650
Speaker 1: That's killer, because now, you know, before you would get MythTV, right, and it was a pain in the ass.

256
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,690
Speaker 1: You'd have to re-encode it for your iPod video and get it on there from Linux and your whatever.

257
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:57,029
Speaker 1: But if they make TiVo just work, then friggin' idiots can do this.

258
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,410
Speaker 1: You know, it might even kill the TV downloading business.

259
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,729
Speaker 1: You know, the torrents of TV, they might go away in favor of this.

260
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,868
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

261
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:18,010
Speaker 1: And, frankly, if I wanted to pay, if I had an iPod video or a PSP, and I had TV, and I didn't mind paying for TiVo, I would go get it.

262
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,953
Speaker 1: But it used to be TiVo2Go sucked.

263
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:29,910
Speaker 1: TiVo2Go would, like, put your TiVo files in this proprietary format and you could only watch them with a TiVo player, and you had to do hacks to convert it to a normal video format.

264
00:14:30,752 --> 00:14:32,630
Speaker 1: Now that they're doing this, it's pretty terrific.

265
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:33,549
Speaker 0: Yeah.

266
00:14:34,032 --> 00:14:37,269
Speaker 1: It might even hurt the iTunes TV episode sales.

267
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:41,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're charging, what, $1.99 to download stuff, but they don't have everything.

268
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,349
Speaker 1: And now you'll have everything that you can watch.

269
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:44,949
Speaker 0: Yeah.

270
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:49,750
Speaker 1: Including, like, you know, you could friggin' get the Super Bowl on your iPod video if you want to watch it again or something.

271
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:52,329
Speaker 1: The NFL would never do something like that.

272
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:57,530
Speaker 1: No major sporting whatever lets you redistribute or redo their episodes.

273
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:59,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'd even warn you about it right away.

274
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember in The Simpsons?

275
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:01,469
Speaker 0: Yep.

276
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:09,530
Speaker 1: We're illegally rebroadcasting Major League Baseball with only implied verbal consent and not express written consent.

277
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,729
Speaker 0: So, uh, things of the day.

278
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:17,329
Speaker 1: Are we getting bummed for music or what?

279
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:18,654
Speaker 0: Uh, someday.

280
00:15:19,117 --> 00:15:21,570
Speaker 0: See, I'm going out of town this weekend, so, uh, no.

281
00:15:22,471 --> 00:15:22,748
Speaker 1: Great.

282
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:26,530
Speaker 0: So, yeah, got a thing of the day?

283
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:28,228
Speaker 1: I sure do.

284
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:29,129
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

285
00:15:29,692 --> 00:15:29,948
Speaker 1: Really.

286
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:37,510
Speaker 1: So, um, these four kids, one of them, uh, dressed up as Toad.

287
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,949
Speaker 1: Two of them were the Mario and Luigi.

288
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:40,744
Speaker 0: It's-a me!

289
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:42,209
Speaker 1: And there was a little princess.

290
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,969
Speaker 1: And they had, uh, they had a question block.

291
00:15:46,054 --> 00:15:47,109
Speaker 1: And they had a drum set.

292
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,969
Speaker 1: And they had two marimbas hidden behind two green pipes.

293
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:51,828
Speaker 1: Aha!

294
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:52,746
Speaker 1: And a goomba.

295
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:55,249
Speaker 1: And a star and some mushrooms, you know, and stuff.

296
00:15:56,411 --> 00:16:03,265
Speaker 1: And, um, they played every major Mario song there is on stage on the marimbas and the drums.

297
00:16:03,946 --> 00:16:05,630
Speaker 1: for, I get, it looked like their high school.

298
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:14,630
Speaker 1: And the video's on Google Video and it's circulating and it's, uh, it's at least equal in quality to the Mario video game acapella group.

299
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:15,670
Speaker 0: That's kind of badass.

300
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:16,989
Speaker 1: It's pretty badass.

301
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:18,597
Speaker 1: We watched it.

302
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:19,670
Speaker 1: High quality.

303
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:22,268
Speaker 0: Recommended for- Definitely, uh, check this out.

304
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,848
Speaker 1: Recommended for video game fans.

305
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:24,770
Speaker 0: Yes.

306
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:29,370
Speaker 0: And I gotta say, it speaks a lot for the way culture is changing.

307
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,689
Speaker 0: Because when I was in high school, if the high school band did that, I'd be all about it.

308
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,961
Speaker 0: But the majority of the audience would sit there thinking, "What the fuck?

309
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:40,486
Speaker 0: What is this?

310
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:41,308
Speaker 0: Some kind of video

311
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:41,609
Speaker 0: game?".

312
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:48,050
Speaker 0: But, uh, nowadays, if you watch this video, the crowd is screaming as loud as any crowd could scream.

313
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:48,948
Speaker 1: Yeah.

314
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,690
Speaker 1: And, I mean, I could even hear they messed up once or twice, you know.

315
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,250
Speaker 1: And they weren't, like, perfect, amazing musicians.

316
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,430
Speaker 1: And you can tell that Mario was really good and Luigi not so good.

317
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:58,703
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:02,709
Speaker 1: You know, but, you know, everyone's screaming because of what they did.

319
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:08,650
Speaker 1: Someone else who might have done better music technically, but a song that no one cared about, would probably not get as much cheering.

320
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:09,319
Speaker 0: Yep.

321
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,710
Speaker 0: It pleases me that, uh, my, uh, cultural, uh, blah-blah-blahs are starting to get mainstream a little bit.

322
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,267
Speaker 0: It's kind of cool.

323
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,270
Speaker 1: We'll be dominating in ten years, no doubt.

324
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:24,690
Speaker 0: Once again, like I keep saying, someday there's going to be a president of the United States of America who played Mario Brothers.

325
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,989
Speaker 1: And by then, everything will be great.

326
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:27,661
Speaker 0: Yeah.

327
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,390
Speaker 1: Or, that will be the time when everything starts becoming great.

328
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:37,870
Speaker 0: Or, 'cause right now, we're all young, and we're always complaining about things, and the people who are in power are fixing the problems that they were mad about when they were kids.

329
00:17:38,931 --> 00:17:46,348
Speaker 0: So we'll be fixing problems with video games and geekery, and all the kids will be yelling at us for, "Why aren't you fixing the problem with virtual reality,

330
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,029
Speaker 0: blah-blah-blah?".

331
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:52,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, people keep, you know, uh, we got big problems with people, uh...

332
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,909
Speaker 0: Things keep changing!

333
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, make laws about virtual rape or something, you know?

334
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:00,889
Speaker 0: You know, there actually was a case about virtual rape not too long ago.

335
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:01,961
Speaker 1: How does that...

336
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:06,450
Speaker 0: It was a couple years ago, I forget what MMO it was, I'll try to dig up the link.

337
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,849
Speaker 1: You can't rape people in MMOs.

338
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:15,830
Speaker 0: Well, apparently, there was some MMO, and people were roleplaying, and one guy started roleplaying that he raped this female character.

339
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:23,289
Speaker 0: And she was so traumatized, she called the police, and soon, I don't remember... I never saw the follow-up article as to whether anything came of it.

340
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,190
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna Google that and try to find out at some point.

341
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,108
Speaker 1: It's kinda screwed up.

342
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,718
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:31,217
Speaker 1: Alright.

344
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,330
Speaker 0: What's your theme today?

345
00:18:32,731 --> 00:18:35,590
Speaker 0: So, uh, I discovered a whole bunch of interesting facts about Chuck Norris.

346
00:18:36,371 --> 00:18:38,870
Speaker 0: Apparently, the chief export of Chuck Norris is pain.

347
00:18:40,063 --> 00:18:40,230
Speaker 0: Yup.

348
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,290
Speaker 0: Chuck Norris lost his virginity before his father did.

349
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:44,590
Speaker 1: How is that possible?

350
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:45,730
Speaker 0: He's Chuck Norris.

351
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,570
Speaker 0: And the fastest way to a man's heart is Chuck Norris's face.

352
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:57,770
Speaker 1: That would be the fastest way, but then why did Bruce Lee kill Chuck Norris in the Colosseum in Italy?

353
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,110
Speaker 0: Because then he came back to life to save that kid from asthma and sidekicks.

354
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:03,339
Speaker 0: God damn.

355
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:07,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know who thought this site was a good idea.

356
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:10,823
Speaker 0: And when I found it, I thought, "Why would this be funny?

357
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,147
Speaker 0: It's just a thing about Chuck

358
00:19:12,188 --> 00:19:12,489
Speaker 0: Norris.".

359
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:18,810
Speaker 0: But when he actually started reading these things, I don't know why, but Chuck Norris just fits, and these are absolutely hilarious.

360
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,438
Speaker 0: I mean, there are no disabled people.

361
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,410
Speaker 0: There are only people who have met Chuck Norris.

362
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,640
Speaker 1: The thing is that they got a Mr.

363
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,947
Speaker 1: T one and a Vin Diesel one.

364
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:27,570
Speaker 1: Not as funny.

365
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,314
Speaker 1: No.

366
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,763
Speaker 1: Now, the question is, if they had started with Mr.

367
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,090
Speaker 1: T, would it have been as funny?

368
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,111
Speaker 0: I don't know.

369
00:19:34,171 --> 00:19:40,750
Speaker 0: I don't know if this was the first thing like this, or if this is a case of, for some reason, Chuck Norris fills this void.

370
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:45,090
Speaker 1: I don't know, but can it be repeated for more funny?

371
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,279
Speaker 1: It would have to be someone who doesn't dish out pain.

372
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:49,610
Speaker 1: It would have to be someone who's different in a different way.

373
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,130
Speaker 1: Like maybe a politician or something.

374
00:19:52,531 --> 00:19:57,870
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of them on this site, and I really think the people who are doing it are trying to make a new kind of internet cliché.

375
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,856
Speaker 1: Well, I think they've already made it with.

376
00:20:00,137 --> 00:20:03,410
Speaker 1: they got one, and I don't know if it's repeatable is the thing.

377
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,570
Speaker 1: It's like hot or not, they could expand by just adding more pictures.

378
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, but will this become another YGMD?

379
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:14,850
Speaker 1: You can make anything else or not, but this, if the famous person isn't funny, it doesn't work.

380
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Chuck Norris isn't that funny.

381
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:19,370
Speaker 0: He's Chuck Norris, and he does roundhouse kicks.

382
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,650
Speaker 1: And he has a beard.

383
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:22,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

384
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:26,110
Speaker 0: And Chuck Norris actually once ate three 72-ounce steaks in one hour.

385
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:29,830
Speaker 0: He spent the first 45 minutes having sex with the waitress.

386
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,373
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

387
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:32,377
Speaker 1: Giggity.

388
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,650
Speaker 1: We should use the giggity wave.

389
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:43,890
Speaker 0: So, uh, we're still having trouble with Mondays, and we had a long, crazy, geeky weekend, and we're tired.

390
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:44,969
Speaker 1: I'm not tired.

391
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:45,628
Speaker 0: I'm tired.

392
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:46,469
Speaker 1: I'm great.

393
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:46,895
Speaker 0: Eh.

394
00:20:48,371 --> 00:20:50,750
Speaker 0: So we're going to try a new bit that we just came up with, just now.

395
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,168
Speaker 1: The bit is, uh, before we had the story bits, we were going to do a little story at the end of each podcast.

396
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,373
Speaker 0: But that was kind of weak.

397
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:02,590
Speaker 0: I mean, we like telling stories, but we'd like to do it in a slightly better way than just tell a story.

398
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,813
Speaker 1: In a way that's meaningful.

399
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:09,927
Speaker 1: So, last week, we tried to do a "how not to" or "how to" something.

400
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:10,950
Speaker 1: geek, you know?

401
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:21,370
Speaker 1: Well, if Thursday becomes, like, interview day, then what we're trying to-- One other thing we're going to experiment with right now is a story of geek with a moral.

402
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:24,869
Speaker 0: Some form of morality at the end.

403
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:26,008
Speaker 1: Yeah.

404
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,483
Speaker 1: Yeah.

405
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:32,670
Speaker 1: Something that-- it's a story relating to geekery that hopefully will teach geeks to be better geeks by example.

406
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:36,870
Speaker 0: Or, in the very least, will be funny, and they'll teach you not to do what Donnie Don't did.

407
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:42,370
Speaker 1: Don't do what Donnie Don't-- does, does, doesn't-- done.

408
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

409
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:54,330
Speaker 0: So, when we got to RIT, and we all met-- we all really met at the gaming club on campus.

410
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:54,746
Speaker 0: Yep.

411
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:56,417
Speaker 0: And there was this guy in the corner.

412
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:57,462
Speaker 0: His name was Dwayne.

413
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,210
Speaker 0: And he seemed cool.

414
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,680
Speaker 0: He yelled, "Hey, I'm running a third ed D&D

415
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,002
Speaker 0: game!".

416
00:22:02,022 --> 00:22:03,670
Speaker 0: And we all flocked, and we all met each other.

417
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:06,256
Speaker 0: And he was the Dungeon Master, and he was great.

418
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:09,450
Speaker 0: And we played this awesome Dungeons & Dragons game for, like, two days.

419
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:15,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't really tell how-- it wasn't that great in retrospect, but I hadn't played D&D in, like, a couple years.

420
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:16,459
Speaker 1: So it was like,

421
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:16,601
Speaker 1: "Woo!".

422
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:17,452
Speaker 0: Yep.

423
00:22:17,773 --> 00:22:19,905
Speaker 0: Plus, I'd never played D&D with that many people.

424
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:22,550
Speaker 0: There were seriously, like, 20-- There were so many people-- 22 people in this group.

425
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,975
Speaker 1: There were so many people, they had to split us up into two groups.

426
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:31,670
Speaker 1: But that-- this was-- the reason it was so big was because third ed was new, and everyone wanted to play it, regardless of how quality it was gonna be.

427
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:32,111
Speaker 0: Yep.

428
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,305
Speaker 0: And he seemed like a cool guy.

429
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:35,010
Speaker 0: We hung out with him.

430
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,810
Speaker 1: He was a little weird-looking, but, eh, you know, he's okay.

431
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,370
Speaker 0: I know a lot of weird-looking people.

432
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are definitely worse-looking people.

433
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:42,665
Speaker 0: Yeah.

434
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:43,550
Speaker 0: A lot of 'em.

435
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,430
Speaker 0: And he was nice, he was friendly, he seemed pretty smart.

436
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,811
Speaker 0: Yep.

437
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,590
Speaker 1: He was in college.

438
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:48,832
Speaker 0: Yeah.

439
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:53,370
Speaker 0: Give-- fast-forward about two weeks, and we learn that Dwayne smokes pot.

440
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,593
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have a problem with that.

441
00:22:57,135 --> 00:23:01,990
Speaker 0: I don't mind people doing whatever they wanna do, but, uh, Dwayne smoked too much pot.

442
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,049
Speaker 1: In fact, I think Nicole brought a whole bag of it.

443
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:07,230
Speaker 0: And he smoked it all.

444
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,169
Speaker 1: A giant, giant, giant bag of it.

445
00:23:09,617 --> 00:23:09,889
Speaker 1: Yeah.

446
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,630
Speaker 1: And they smoked all of it in, like, a night, two nights?

447
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:14,449
Speaker 0: Not long.

448
00:23:15,153 --> 00:23:16,309
Speaker 1: A very short amount of time.

449
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:24,150
Speaker 0: So, we started, uh, dis-- not purposefully distancing ourselves, more like Dwayne stopped running the game because he was stoned.

450
00:23:25,152 --> 00:23:28,110
Speaker 1: And, like, the other guy who was running the other half of the game disappeared.

451
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another story.

452
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:29,941
Speaker 0: He just disappeared.

453
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,150
Speaker 0: We never found out what happened to him.

454
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:31,830
Speaker 1: Yeah.

455
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:47,410
Speaker 0: So, as we stopped playing the game with him, just because he was stoned all the time, we started, uh, learning from some of the older, wiser people around that Dwayne had a history of being cool, and then not being cool anymore when he started smoking pot again.

456
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:52,130
Speaker 1: In fact, the story that was told was that when he first got to RIT, he was a cool guy who knew everyone.

457
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:59,450
Speaker 1: And then when he smoked pot, and started smoking pot more and more, he just became less and less cool and weird and, yeah.

458
00:23:59,753 --> 00:23:59,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

459
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:01,588
Speaker 1: It basically ruined him.

460
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,806
Speaker 0: Now, there's-- I mean, it's just a story-- you've all met someone who smoked too much pot.

461
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:06,710
Speaker 0: That's not much of a story.

462
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,201
Speaker 0: But, uh, there was this house.

463
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,630
Speaker 0: It was called Patoria.

464
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,610
Speaker 1: Because Pat was the owner.

465
00:24:12,691 --> 00:24:14,410
Speaker 0: The guy named Pat owned it, so it was called Pat.

466
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,198
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if he owned it.

467
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,230
Speaker 1: He was the primary renter.

468
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,071
Speaker 0: Something like that.

469
00:24:18,315 --> 00:24:23,890
Speaker 0: And, uh, they were all kind of into the pot and various other bits of herbal refreshment.

470
00:24:24,694 --> 00:24:25,909
Speaker 0: We visited them one day.

471
00:24:26,852 --> 00:24:27,749
Speaker 1: I didn't, but you did.

472
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:31,497
Speaker 0: And we go in to play some D&D or Settlers or something.

473
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,085
Speaker 0: And the floor was damp.

474
00:24:36,589 --> 00:24:37,050
Speaker 0: All of it.

475
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:38,460
Speaker 1: And it was upstairs, right?

476
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:40,353
Speaker 0: It wasn't-- Like, it wasn't flooded.

477
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,779
Speaker 0: It was just kind of dank.

478
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,330
Speaker 0: Like Moe's Tavern, only danker.

479
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,041
Speaker 1: The dank, Moe.

480
00:24:45,102 --> 00:24:45,569
Speaker 1: The dank.

481
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,903
Speaker 0: I got to the point where we walk in and he's like, "Hey, take your shoes

482
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:49,184
Speaker 0: off.".

483
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,188
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Hell

484
00:24:50,228 --> 00:24:50,449
Speaker 0: no!".

485
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:52,981
Speaker 1: Tell them about the chairs.

486
00:24:53,001 --> 00:24:53,670
Speaker 1: Tell them about the chairs.

487
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,630
Speaker 0: So we go to sit at the, uh, I guess it was a dining room table to play some Settlers.

488
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:04,390
Speaker 0: And there's a wooden chair, but it was dank to the point that it had more of the consistency of soggy cardboard.

489
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:05,930
Speaker 0: But it was definitely wood.

490
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,490
Speaker 1: That's pretty frightening.

491
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

492
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:10,852
Speaker 1: People lived in this.

493
00:25:11,374 --> 00:25:15,730
Speaker 1: In fact, Duane lived in it because, well, he didn't really have any money because he spent it all on pot.

494
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,190
Speaker 1: So he kept moving from, like, friend's house to friend's house, whoever would let him stay there.

495
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,460
Speaker 1: Until eventually no one would let him stay there.

496
00:25:22,902 --> 00:25:24,590
Speaker 1: And he had to go back home to his mommy.

497
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,452
Speaker 0: And you know what?

498
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:29,370
Speaker 0: From last I heard, he went back home to his mommy, he stopped smoking pot, and he straightened himself up.

499
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,469
Speaker 0: But he lost all his geek friends and he left RIT.

500
00:25:33,453 --> 00:25:39,269
Speaker 1: And he's all out of geek, he's all out of cool, he's just someone we haven't heard from him, and eh.

501
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,180
Speaker 0: So... Wheel of morality, turn, turn, turn.

502
00:25:43,562 --> 00:25:45,210
Speaker 0: Tell us the lesson that we should learn.

503
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,970
Speaker 0: Either A. Don't smoke pot.

504
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:52,609
Speaker 0: B. Don't smoke too much pot.

505
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:57,084
Speaker 1: C. Don't drop Adam's goal.

506
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:00,075
Speaker 0: D.

507
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:01,185
Speaker 1: Get a job!

508
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,197
Speaker 0: Get a job!

509
00:26:04,506 --> 00:26:05,150
Speaker 0: Watch Futurama.

510
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,429
Speaker 1: In other words, don't be Duane.

511
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,266
Speaker 0: Yeah.

512
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,186
Speaker 0: Alright, that was our trial of this bit.

513
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:19,080
Speaker 0: I imagine the stories will range from actually funny to actually serious depending on what kind of story we want to tell.

514
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:22,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we want to try to elaborate on the stories a little longer, maybe?

515
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:23,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

516
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,503
Speaker 1: Who knows?

517
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:26,500
Speaker 0: Maybe if they're short we can tell them.

518
00:26:26,801 --> 00:26:32,199
Speaker 0: Do you want serious stories like, "That time our friend got killed and we had to bury the

519
00:26:32,219 --> 00:26:32,520
Speaker 0: body."?

520
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:37,175
Speaker 0: Or stories like, "Haha, our stupid friend did something

521
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:37,677
Speaker 0: silly."?

522
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can tell all kinds of stories.

523
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:47,140
Speaker 1: We can tell general stories like about a place, or we can tell specific stories like a specific time in the place.

524
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,798
Speaker 1: Like I can tell you all about Otacon, or I can tell you about Otacon 2002 at this panel.

525
00:26:53,918 --> 00:26:54,560
Speaker 0: Something happened.

526
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:56,340
Speaker 1: And it was funny.

527
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,084
Speaker 0: So this is the experimental bit.

528
00:26:59,104 --> 00:26:59,887
Speaker 0: We don't know what we're doing.

529
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:02,175
Speaker 0: So, uh, post in the forums.

530
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:02,777
Speaker 0: What do you think?

531
00:27:02,818 --> 00:27:03,440
Speaker 0: What do you want to hear?

532
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,720
Speaker 0: If anything, to our friends out there who actually know us, what stories should we tell?

533
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we're definitely going to go with the interviews on the Thursday.

534
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:13,935
Speaker 1: I'll set up the Skype.

535
00:27:14,155 --> 00:27:15,560
Speaker 1: even though it's kind of evil it works.

536
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,406
Speaker 1: It might cost us a little bit of money.

537
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:20,200
Speaker 1: I think it was .0162 cents per minute or something.

538
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's only if we have to use the phone part of it.

539
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:24,500
Speaker 0: If we call someone on Skype with Skype.

540
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they also have Skype, then we're all good.

541
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,665
Speaker 0: I imagine no problem.

542
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:31,320
Speaker 0: I imagine we'll be interviewing somewhat geeky people at first.

543
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,980
Speaker 1: And then Monday we were just trying to find out a bit, and we're going to keep experimenting until we find one.

544
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:45,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, for now it looks like unless someone has a better idea, we'll do more news on Monday because we have the whole weekend to cover.

545
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:49,760
Speaker 0: And then we'll tell stories until we get sick of talking and play this song.

546
00:27:56,732 --> 00:27:58,900
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

547
00:27:59,241 --> 00:28:01,470
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.
