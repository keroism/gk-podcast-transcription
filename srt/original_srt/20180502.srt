Speaker 1: It says 85 degrees, but that's fine.

13
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,701

00:00:54,454 --> 00:01:00,009
Speaker 1: point is I Neglectfully forgot the yesterday.

17
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:01,876
Speaker 1: I was the first of me.

18
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:08,297
Speaker 1: Oh outdoor fucking Mm-hmm Weather's just in time.

19
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:09,542
Speaker 0: it's.

20
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:16,928
Speaker 0: uh, it was a good day because you know, I started a new job and Yeah, you wonder why we've been busy.

21
00:01:16,968 --> 00:01:29,011
Speaker 0: there's been a lot of life changes in the rim and Scott households, but As you know in my last job, I'd biked to work every day and it was like a seven ish mile ride So like 25 to 28 minutes,

22
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,560
Speaker 1: let me check on the Strava how long the ride was to work today.

23
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:36,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but I'd bike hard and get sweaty and wear shorts and everything and I had it like it.

24
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:42,736
Speaker 0: in New York There's always this minefield of will your building let you bike even though the law says they have to?

25
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:43,860
Speaker 0: there's a lot of loopholes in.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,831
Speaker 1: Well, oh, it's not about the it's not always about the building.

27
00:01:46,851 --> 00:01:49,020
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah, maybe your employer might just suck.

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,513
Speaker 1: And anyway, so this morning to the new work, which is seven point two miles It took me 39 minutes from my home on the slow heavy bike.

29
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:06,415
Speaker 1: No and to get to rims house Okay to get to rims house which is much closer than my house from work took 30 minutes in his 5.3 mile.

30
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:14,366
Speaker 0: it took me to get home 12 minutes to bike the 3.2 miles to get home.

31
00:02:14,747 --> 00:02:14,867
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,673
Speaker 0: That's a real nice bike.

33
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:18,298
Speaker 0: What's interesting is it takes me years?

34
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:20,906
Speaker 1: Oh my god That's not as unfairly close.

35
00:02:21,006 --> 00:02:22,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm telling you you're cheating.

36
00:02:22,872 --> 00:02:25,459
Speaker 0: Oh even better if we move offices, I'll be here.

37
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:26,345
Speaker 1: What?

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,247
Speaker 1: Oh at 59, yeah Building with the weird.

39
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,260
Speaker 0: Yep, that would mean I think I would literally just bike over the bridge.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,248
Speaker 0: I'm at work if I go to the version of home.

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,059
Speaker 0: It'll be like seven minutes tops.

42
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,900
Speaker 1: The difference is when you bike you try to go fast only on the way home.

43
00:02:45,343 --> 00:02:47,780
Speaker 0: I don't want to show up to work all huffing and puffing and sweaty.

44
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,733
Speaker 1: I basically even when I'm biking like on the weekend with the biking group.

45
00:02:52,355 --> 00:02:56,753
Speaker 1: I never huff or puff But not even as if I feel any.

46
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:03,655
Speaker 0: but like dynamite I'm huffing and puffing in the community if I feel any like difficulty or strain.

47
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,888
Speaker 1: or you know exercise Happening gear down to slow down.

48
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:11,442
Speaker 0: This is why I took you like two more hours to do the Hudson Valley Well ride.

49
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,767
Speaker 1: they take me more hours.

50
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:15,759
Speaker 0: It was a long time before you rolled in.

51
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,563
Speaker 0: No, it was.

52
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:22,305
Speaker 0: I'd already eaten like a full dinner and had a couple beers Mm-hmm But I got huff and puff.

53
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:25,821
Speaker 0: I bike hard and fast wherever I am unless I have a reason not to you like I'm with other People.

54
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:26,364
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

55
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:27,268
Speaker 0: I like it.

56
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,840
Speaker 0: I still do that thing where I run everywhere if I have a good excuse.

57
00:03:31,201 --> 00:03:32,445
Speaker 0: And I'm doing a thing at work now.

58
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,560
Speaker 0: So I try to not ever use the elevator in the high-rise.

59
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:38,614
Speaker 1: How what floor is your office?

60
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:38,958
Speaker 0: So previously?

61
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,087
Speaker 0: I'm previously at rooms job.

62
00:03:42,328 --> 00:03:43,193
Speaker 0: I was on the tenth floor.

63
00:03:43,213 --> 00:03:44,097
Speaker 1: That's a little too high.

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:44,680
Speaker 0: That's fine.

65
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:46,574
Speaker 0: That's like a five minute walk up.

66
00:03:46,614 --> 00:03:53,932
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't a big deal I used to be a little like out of breath by the time I got to the eighth or ninth floor But now up ten like no big deal.

67
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:57,334
Speaker 0: I'm just skipping steps is fine We moved up to the 18th floor.

68
00:03:57,414 --> 00:04:02,969
Speaker 0: Let me tell you 18 8 10 18 8 10.

69
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:03,460
Speaker 1: You know what?

70
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:11,060
Speaker 0: But it's even worse because the 13th floor is where there's like the unlimited food and coffee and stuff.

71
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,840
Speaker 0: So now I'm going up and I hit 13.

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,764
Speaker 0: It's like a fuck it.

73
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,892
Speaker 0: and I go and get like some breakfast that I take the elevator.

74
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,786
Speaker 1: the rest of my previous work was On the seventh floor, right?

75
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,975
Speaker 1: But guess what are the eighth floor?

76
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:22,276
Speaker 1: I think.

77
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,106
Speaker 1: but anyway, yep My apartment is on the third floor.

78
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:28,597
Speaker 1: Your apartment is on the third floor right my new work.

79
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:29,720
Speaker 1: Guess what third floor?

80
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:30,101
Speaker 1: That's right.

81
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:33,440
Speaker 1: And whenever I get so weird whenever I get an elevator, I only got to push three.

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,850
Speaker 1: I don't got to push no other buttons only threes and ones.

83
00:04:35,991 --> 00:04:37,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got to push nothing else.

84
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,166
Speaker 1: no matter where I go I can't forget dude.

85
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,252
Speaker 1: It's either three or one.

86
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:43,350
Speaker 0: to this fucking day Two jobs ago.

87
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:45,280
Speaker 0: My company was on a certain floor.

88
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,115
Speaker 0: I will if I'm really tired and not paying attention when I'm going to work anywhere.

89
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:51,680
Speaker 0: I'll hit that floor number.

90
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:54,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't worked at that place in like a decade.

91
00:04:55,021 --> 00:05:00,792
Speaker 1: This is why it's real good to have one of those fancy buildings like the building Microsoft is in where when you go to the Front desk.

92
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,728
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You just tell me what floor you're going.

93
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:03,110
Speaker 0: or if you're

94
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:17,950
Speaker 1: an employee you waive your card at this Turnstyle and then an elevator comes with no buttons on it And knows that a person going to floor 12 or whatever has gone through the turnstile and an elevator comes Programmed to go to that floor and no other.

95
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,914
Speaker 0: Oh, it's even better.

96
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:26,947
Speaker 1: or it's not only secure It is also convenient which is great because usually security, you know Usually means a decrease in convenience.

97
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:39,436
Speaker 1: that technology of the elevator with no buttons is a dramatic security increase along with a Dramatic convenience increase like any hotel that has that will literally never have the checkout problem at a con again.

98
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:49,405
Speaker 1: The only problem is People who don't know know if you if you go through the turnstile, right and the elevator comes and you don't get on Are you just trapped.

99
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,640
Speaker 1: you have to go back out and then go back into the turnstile again?

100
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, there isn't like a place to waive your bar.

101
00:05:56,062 --> 00:06:09,940
Speaker 0: So a cool thing about the building I'm in now and actually a lot of the buildings here They're double-decker elevators so the elevator stops at two floors at any given time and Algorithms just manage that as the elevator is two cars one on top of each.

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,180
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so we can open on floor one and two at the same.

103
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:13,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

104
00:06:14,021 --> 00:06:17,720
Speaker 0: And then it goes up and it just cleverly tries to multiplex the ride.

105
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,930
Speaker 1: So you might but you might be say in a car stopped while the people above it's rare though It avoids that when it can.

106
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,379
Speaker 1: it might as well open the doors.

107
00:06:26,023 --> 00:06:32,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the other thing is and just because the kind of company I work for now They really want people to walk because it's good for you.

108
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:32,937
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

109
00:06:33,138 --> 00:06:48,150
Speaker 0: So elevators by default unless you have a special access card that says you have made it like Privately if it basically flags you as some sort of disability or reason why you should be able to pick your floor Elevators only go to odd or even floors.

110
00:06:48,813 --> 00:06:58,658
Speaker 0: So you got to use the stairs Unless you're real lucky and you're on an odd-numbered floor because then you can get to the food floor and your office and theoretically never Have to use the stairs.

111
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:04,860
Speaker 1: One final thing there's some health insurance companies in the US now giving discounts to people who do enough exercise.

112
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:12,620
Speaker 1: You know like there's things that you can put in your car that will monitor your car and see that you drive safely Yeah, and give you a discount on your car insurance.

113
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,220
Speaker 1: Yeah They're doing the same thing where it's like where a Fitbit equivalent device and we'll check the data on it as if you're healthy enough.

114
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:20,867
Speaker 1: We'll give you just kind of hell dude.

115
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:26,324
Speaker 0: I get a credit because I bike to work sometimes but most of them are Really just like pedometers.

116
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:33,894
Speaker 1: Yeah people on Amazon are selling devices that will shake your pedometer to give you the health insurance discount without exercising.

117
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:38,649
Speaker 0: that is Amazing and very American.

118
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,620
Speaker 0: Yes both sides of that conversation.

119
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,130
Speaker 0: But uh, where's that going with that?

120
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,955
Speaker 0: I don't know all we got.

121
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:47,401
Speaker 1: go to the go to the news All right.

122
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:53,880
Speaker 0: So in the news, there's actually some pretty interesting news about Hasbro and the Power Rangers.

123
00:07:54,201 --> 00:08:12,408
Speaker 1: right, so right it seems like in the world of the US at least all of the popular culture nerd properties right are being gobbled up by Disney and or Hasbro, which is extra complicated because Did Hasbro already has the rights to.

124
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:15,940
Speaker 0: I most like Disney princesses like Disney stuff.

125
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:20,354
Speaker 0: So if Disney gets something has basically has a real has a lacy difference over that.

126
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:25,610
Speaker 1: well license to like toys Right this version doing license licensing and owning.

127
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:31,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like Disney owns fucking Star Wars Right, but they don't make the Star Wars toys.

128
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,171
Speaker 1: Someone else makes.

129
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,535
Speaker 0: well Hasbro makes them.

130
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,580
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Disclosure I own a lot of Hasbro stock.

131
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,179
Speaker 0: I've been buying Hasbro stock for like a decade and I'm continuing to buy it for reasons like this rims.

132
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,564
Speaker 1: Eventually, it's gonna own Hasbro.

133
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:54,492
Speaker 0: Well, holy but surely, uh, and my current rate of buying when I'm a hundred and thirty years old give or take you'll own like a fraction of a percent.

134
00:08:54,733 --> 00:09:09,380
Speaker 0: I'll own enough to where I could actually Vote in a proxy election and if it was real close You One day so that the Hasbro executives are gonna call ribbon be like, huh?

135
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,952
Speaker 1: Who you thinking of voting for for the board rims?

136
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:11,900
Speaker 1: a 90 year old man?

137
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:13,739
Speaker 1: They're all like these 40 year old executive.

138
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:18,840
Speaker 1: He's like son my save games older than your grandpa.

139
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,137
Speaker 1: Don't try to tell me who to vote for.

140
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:31,260
Speaker 0: My goal in life is to walk into Hasbro's office vote in one shareholder election and then immediately collapse into a skeleton.

141
00:09:32,245 --> 00:09:33,379
Speaker 1: And they'll make a toy skeleton.

142
00:09:35,162 --> 00:09:35,929
Speaker 0: That's my one vote.

143
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,159
Speaker 0: You got to make it skeleton rim.

144
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,078
Speaker 1: All toys then will just be cyber it constructions.

145
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:43,406
Speaker 0: anyway Your hands.

146
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:43,788
Speaker 0: What is this?

147
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:44,451
Speaker 0: a baby game?

148
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,460
Speaker 1: You'll be going to their virtual executive.

149
00:09:47,907 --> 00:09:48,896
Speaker 1: You have to hack your way in.

150
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:54,160
Speaker 0: But yeah this there's a lot of things going on here.

151
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,580
Speaker 1: But yeah Hasbro bought the Power Rangers from Saban Saban, however, you pronounce it, right?

152
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,467
Speaker 1: Yeah, they didn't license it or any like.

153
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:06,632
Speaker 1: they now own it the same way they own Watsy and Transformers and My Little Pony.

154
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:10,830
Speaker 0: they fucking own it Meaning they can make the shows they can.

155
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,414
Speaker 1: so if you want to make a Power Rangers movie You have to buy a license from Hasbro.

156
00:10:15,474 --> 00:10:22,693
Speaker 1: if they want to make Power Rangers and My Little Pony Transformers crossovers guess what they can just fucking do it if they want.

157
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,259
Speaker 1: you can't stop them because they own it all.

158
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:26,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, they probably will and it's real interesting.

159
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,703
Speaker 0: This is all happening.

160
00:10:27,743 --> 00:10:35,633
Speaker 1: people that they currently licensed to like IDW who makes all the pony Transformers GI Joe comics, I think they also make.

161
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:37,500
Speaker 1: they might even already make Power Rangers comics.

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,276
Speaker 1: I bet who makes the Power Rangers comics, but guess what if the IDW doesn't already?

163
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,240
Speaker 1: they're going too soon.

164
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:45,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can expect any place that you currently see.

165
00:10:45,722 --> 00:10:48,639
Speaker 1: Hasbro stuff the Power Rangers you get in that mix.

166
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,875
Speaker 1: You'll probably go home and you're probably watch My Little Pony on the hub.

167
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:52,720
Speaker 1: Is that still a network?

168
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,965
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

169
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,712
Speaker 1: I don't even know anymore.

170
00:10:54,954 --> 00:11:12,368
Speaker 0: but Power Rangers Hasbro is down right now because of an unrelated thing because as you all recall Toys R Us is gone bye-bye and It's while it's not gone for any good reason.

171
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:15,536
Speaker 0: like the reasons why Toys R Us actually went bankrupt are just really fucked up.

172
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:21,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Because the last national toy chain is gone.

173
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,933
Speaker 0: That's really hurting Hasbro's sort of short-term value.

174
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:26,900
Speaker 1: and the guys market cares about short-term.

175
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,094
Speaker 1: But rim who's gonna be 90 to get his one vote?

176
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,889
Speaker 0: Yeah Short I am not giving investment advice.

177
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,400
Speaker 0: do not construe anything that I'm saying as investment advice.

178
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:38,664
Speaker 0: I swear to fucking God.

179
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:44,062
Speaker 0: do not do not talk to me about this, but don't do it done in brim Don't does.

180
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,294
Speaker 0: but I am continuing to buy a lot of Hasbro stock now that it's down.

181
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:55,905
Speaker 0: just cuz someone does something does not mean They're suggesting that you do that thing cuz I also drink a lot of poison and huff and puff on a bike Sometimes not wearing a helmet.

182
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,702
Speaker 1: So yes, I Don't wear a helmet if I ride a city bike, but on a city bike There's even.

183
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:03,134
Speaker 0: I already don't feel like the city bike.

184
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,420
Speaker 0: I should be wearing a helmet.

185
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:09,120
Speaker 1: I or I already don't huff and puff on a road bike on a city bike.

186
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,550
Speaker 1: I even know how do I somehow negative huff city bike.

187
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,836
Speaker 0: I fought and fuck city bike.

188
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,280
Speaker 0: I'm rarely even in that top gear.

189
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,532
Speaker 0: I'm just like putter.

190
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:17,775
Speaker 0: putter.

191
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:21,360
Speaker 1: putter Like the city bike is just so heavy and slow.

192
00:12:21,481 --> 00:12:22,800
Speaker 0: That's not a thing.

193
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,265
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna carry a helmet with me.

194
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:28,140
Speaker 0: not a single drop of sweat is gonna come from my brow on a city bike.

195
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,450
Speaker 0: I'll tell you why I used one the other day.

196
00:12:30,771 --> 00:12:34,631
Speaker 0: cuz yesterday I didn't bring my bike to work and it was so nice I was like fuck it and I took a city bike home.

197
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you're close enough.

198
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:37,472
Speaker 1: Yeah for me it'd be cutting it.

199
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:42,160
Speaker 1: I could I could do it I could make it all the way to work in one ride without docking but it would be close.

200
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,496
Speaker 1: Cuz I mean I'd lose time because it's a big heavy but even better because I bought the day pass.

201
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:46,958
Speaker 0: it was 24 hours.

202
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:48,448
Speaker 0: So later that night.

203
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,840
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't have a permanent thing.

204
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,130
Speaker 0: I used to and I cancel it.

205
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:51,875
Speaker 0: cuz they doubled the price.

206
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:52,480
Speaker 0: I might get it back.

207
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,807
Speaker 1: So I paid for it.

208
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,275
Speaker 0: right but I paid for it back.

209
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,445
Speaker 0: It was like a hundred bucks But you know what my new job.

210
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,108
Speaker 1: they pay for it.

211
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,640
Speaker 1: So as soon as it expires, I just renew it for free.

212
00:13:01,043 --> 00:13:06,451
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get it again cuz They're screening Porco Rosso at Kips Bay.

213
00:13:06,472 --> 00:13:07,355
Speaker 1: Just watched it.

214
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:08,800
Speaker 0: I haven't watched it in a while.

215
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:10,607
Speaker 0: Okay so I might go see the fact.

216
00:13:10,668 --> 00:13:21,785
Speaker 1: I gave a computer to George and I left my Porco Rosso DVD in the DVD player and then he's like, oh we watching this and I'm like, oh good Good thing I left it in there.

217
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,748
Speaker 0: He was just asking me.

218
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:24,293
Speaker 0: He wants all my old computers too.

219
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:25,437
Speaker 1: Good take them.

220
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,934
Speaker 0: Yeah Start mining those bitcoins or whatever you're gonna do.

221
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:32,900
Speaker 1: I don't know what you can do with them But please take all of my unused technology.

222
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:39,480
Speaker 0: So in some other news more of a geek bite Scott I want to review this on geek nights But I gotta get Scott to watch it first.

223
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:48,182
Speaker 0: Emily I have been watching on Judas recommendation and also the Internet's recommendation because this is one of those things we talked about with judge Anime by its cover.

224
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:57,679
Speaker 0: I ignore a lot of anime even if I'm positively inclined toward it unless people keep talking about it and People keep talking about made in abyss.

225
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:00,518
Speaker 0: So I felt like I had to watch it.

226
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:05,378
Speaker 0: So I watched one episode and it was intriguing enough to watch the rest and I'm almost done with it.

227
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:05,900
Speaker 0: It's not long.

228
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,833
Speaker 0: It's like 10 or 11 at 13 episodes the season supposedly.

229
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:15,220
Speaker 0: I haven't seen the end yet, but supposedly it ends in a reasonable place unlike say attack on Titan.

230
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:22,480
Speaker 0: And what I have to say about it is that if you're an anime fan, it is definitely worth watching.

231
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,370
Speaker 0: I'm really enjoying it.

232
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,639
Speaker 0: I think Scott will really like it.

233
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:28,092
Speaker 0: It reminds me of the good parts of Jew.

234
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:31,087
Speaker 1: Oh say if you remember that show I remember there was a show called you.

235
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,863
Speaker 0: Oh, so that was owners like the brothers on the planet with the plants It'll eat you.

236
00:14:34,883 --> 00:14:36,850
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought that was number nine.

237
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:38,757
Speaker 1: I don't know anymore.

238
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,466
Speaker 0: number six Yeah, I can play.

239
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:41,947
Speaker 0: I can play it.

240
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:43,652
Speaker 0: all these shows together because I can't.

241
00:14:44,214 --> 00:14:53,360
Speaker 0: anyway the show is plants to eat people but coupled with Secret of Mana Like a secret of mana's got cute slimies.

242
00:14:53,647 --> 00:15:04,860
Speaker 0: Yeah so imagine a show that is the terrible secret of space which is there's this pit and It no one knows how deep it goes and it's called the abyss.

243
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:09,760
Speaker 0: And like Dragon Quest everything is like cute Dragon Quest looking characters.

244
00:15:10,181 --> 00:15:15,320
Speaker 0: Everything's set up like an RPG with people like upgrading their equipment and like levels.

245
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,511
Speaker 1: You know what delicious and dungeon is a lot like that.

246
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,653
Speaker 1: only it's about eating the monsters But it's still about going deeper in the dungeon into different.

247
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:22,859
Speaker 0: but the deal with this show?

248
00:15:23,825 --> 00:15:26,479
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna spoil anything, but here's the real deal.

249
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:28,987
Speaker 0: This pit is Golgotharoth.

250
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:39,255
Speaker 0: This might as well just be the prequel to the prince of nothing But it's framed in that there's these kids who live in this town.

251
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:39,696
Speaker 0: That's on the edge.

252
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,140
Speaker 1: Is it Golgotharoth or is it?

253
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:44,766
Speaker 1: You know Lord of the Rings.

254
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:45,770
Speaker 0: It's Golgotharoth.

255
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,380
Speaker 0: Okay, like specifically it's a pit.

256
00:15:48,681 --> 00:16:02,965
Speaker 0: There's like a probably an alien ship buried down there and the story is there's this orphanage and kids in the orphanage Are forced to go down into this pit and bring back artifacts and if they grow up and survive They eventually level up.

257
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:17,460
Speaker 0: and now they're employees of this thing that goes down deeper into the pit to bring up artifacts and they don't really understand how the artifacts work, but they use them and If you go the further down you go the harder it is to come back up because it starts fucking with you.

258
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,548
Speaker 1: I mean, that's how all holes are now.

259
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:22,880
Speaker 1: Like can you tell me a hole that is it buddy where that rule is?

260
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:28,000
Speaker 0: No, we're talking like go down a hundred feet trying to walk back up ten feet.

261
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,823
Speaker 0: You start getting sick.

262
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:29,746
Speaker 0: walk back up twenty feet.

263
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:30,569
Speaker 0: You start vomiting.

264
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,854
Speaker 0: walk out fifty feet.

265
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,420
Speaker 0: blood starts coming out of your eyes.

266
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:36,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that might be harder than a normal hole.

267
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, the same is true in a normal hole the farther you go down the harder it is to get back up.

268
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:46,075
Speaker 0: But it's framed in this like very cute JRPG like Secret of Mana looking way.

269
00:16:46,115 --> 00:16:53,485
Speaker 0: It's a Japanese fantasy show Yeah, but unlike a lot of these shows that have nothing going on Really feeling it.

270
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:54,732
Speaker 0: Okay, really good.

271
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:55,878
Speaker 0: I've thoroughly enjoyed it.

272
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,228
Speaker 1: It's I just want to watch a Gretzky co.

273
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:58,911
Speaker 0: but did.

274
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,800
Speaker 0: oh, we're gonna wash the shit out of a Gretzky co.

275
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,166
Speaker 0: It is a plus as well.

276
00:17:02,528 --> 00:17:04,276
Speaker 1: But yeah, you watched any of it.

277
00:17:04,336 --> 00:17:05,140
Speaker 0: I watched one episode.

278
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,385
Speaker 0: I'm gonna watch again with Emily.

279
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:08,093
Speaker 0: It is a Gretzky co.

280
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:12,310
Speaker 0: if I had to give the shortest geek fight possible There is a lot more to it than you would have guessed.

281
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:13,093
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

282
00:17:13,314 --> 00:17:14,900
Speaker 0: It is a. it's a legit show.

283
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,989
Speaker 0: It isn't just DMC which as much as I loved it DMC is basically just the same joke over and over again.

284
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:22,413
Speaker 1: The DMC manga is a complete.

285
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:28,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but aggressive co Feels like it'll be very simple jokes and it's not.

286
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,115
Speaker 0: it's actually a pretty good character drama.

287
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:34,710
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But made in abyss is good And way dark.

288
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,480
Speaker 0: like one of the things is these kids?

289
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:43,200
Speaker 0: Like the environmental storytelling like they find one of the things that they find and no one knows what they are is skeletons.

290
00:17:44,103 --> 00:17:49,377
Speaker 1: Oh, this is why you like this show all around this pit like everywhere people who tried to walk up from 200 feet.

291
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:56,898
Speaker 1: What if you're just down there like let's say you're a thousand you just stay sure.

292
00:17:56,918 --> 00:17:59,192
Speaker 1: no No, I'm saying you're a thousand feet deep right?

293
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:03,152
Speaker 1: Oh and just like you jump You just jump in place.

294
00:18:03,193 --> 00:18:03,556
Speaker 1: Do you like?

295
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,667
Speaker 1: Disintegrate from going up a little bit.

296
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:10,598
Speaker 0: So I don't know because the characters I am following are only in the fourth level.

297
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:15,168
Speaker 0: now There are four levels down Which is way beyond what normal people do.

298
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:21,372
Speaker 0: and the people who are allowed to go down there like the black whistles or the white Whistles, they're all fucked up non men.

299
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:25,264
Speaker 0: now, like they've been fucked up by this stuff Yeah But they'll keep.

300
00:18:25,284 --> 00:18:29,475
Speaker 0: they keep finding just thousands and thousands and thousands of skeletons.

301
00:18:29,636 --> 00:18:33,006
Speaker 0: nice and they're all Buried in the same way.

302
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:37,500
Speaker 0: They look like they're praying and they're all facing toward the center of the abyss and they're so old.

303
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:38,731
Speaker 0: No one knows what the deal is.

304
00:18:38,752 --> 00:18:40,323
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's fun stuck.

305
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:43,978
Speaker 0: It's this is a good show and there's a reason why everyone's talking about it.

306
00:18:49,372 --> 00:18:54,290
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day we got a double thing of the day feature.

307
00:18:55,594 --> 00:19:03,033
Speaker 1: well, one of them is a thing of Remix thing of the day and one of them is a just the unoriginal a thing from the olden days that's not remixed at all,

308
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:17,842
Speaker 0: so I found this because the the the sort of the buried lead here is that all those Psychedelic Awesome shorts from Sesame Street in the back back in the day they're all just on YouTube like all of them and they're amazing.

309
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:33,497
Speaker 0: and I've been watching them when I'm bored and It's shocking to me how little I remember some of them until I hear that first note and suddenly my brain remembers every single Possible detail of this animation.

310
00:19:33,517 --> 00:19:33,918
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

311
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,468
Speaker 0: But this one is one that has been stuck in my head for the last 36 years.

312
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,229
Speaker 0: It is the Sesame Street pinball song.

313
00:19:42,052 --> 00:19:49,370
Speaker 0: This is a remix of the Sesame Street pinball song with the animation also remixed and it's pretty great.

314
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:52,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the original song is already great.

315
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:58,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, so while talking about things that are great This video reminded me of another Sesame Street video.

316
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:01,990
Speaker 1: So we searched for it and there it was the king of eight.

317
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,998
Speaker 1: He's really great too, but he's not remixed.

318
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:07,050
Speaker 1: It's just the king of eight official Sesame Street YouTube channel.

319
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:15,414
Speaker 1: And the king of eight has the same exact vault voice as the Muppet Rolf the piano playing dog, which is Obvious.

320
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:16,218
Speaker 1: Whoo.

321
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:17,365
Speaker 1: Take out those hot princesses.

322
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:33,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like these Sesame Street shorts were a big foundational part of my life and I'm starting to notice as I'm older that Between like these and things like Donald Duck in math magic land and the anime I watched when I was a little little kid.

323
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:38,024
Speaker 1: I Like it's.

324
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:45,410
Speaker 1: you know It's hard not to draw a connection between the aesthetic of these and the aesthetic that I like in artworks today.

325
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:51,249
Speaker 0: Yep, I do really like late 60s early 70s semi psychedelic stuff.

326
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:57,338
Speaker 0: Then the minute moment the geek nights book club book remains Homer's the Odyssey.

327
00:20:57,781 --> 00:20:57,922
Speaker 0: Mmm.

328
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:01,830
Speaker 0: I got a bunch of travel coming up So I'm gonna finish it in the next month or so if not sooner.

329
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:03,349
Speaker 1: I thought you had finished it and we're waiting for me.

330
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,434
Speaker 0: No, I slide.

331
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:08,730
Speaker 0: I stopped reading to wait for you to start reading again, but I'm all well on my way.

332
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:15,430
Speaker 1: I'm probably gonna read, you know, but I'm chillin in the park laying down in the Sun with the grass and such.

333
00:21:15,762 --> 00:21:15,909
Speaker 0: Yep.

334
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:25,505
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read on trips cuz uh, although the part of the meta moment is that I'm going to be Scottless in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this weekend for Zenkai counter.

335
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:30,400
Speaker 0: I'm doing three panels Anime openers from around the world which important point.

336
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,970
Speaker 0: This is the last time I'm running this fucking panel.

337
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:41,966
Speaker 0: Thank God, I've run this so many versions of it so many years and it is not feasible for me to make new versions of it.

338
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,396
Speaker 0: and Because I can't put it on YouTube.

339
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:48,290
Speaker 0: I'm increasingly unwilling to make content that I can't put on the internet.

340
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:50,997
Speaker 0: So I'm letting that ship sail.

341
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:54,370
Speaker 0: This is the final performance of anime openers from around the world.

342
00:21:54,952 --> 00:21:56,158
Speaker 0: I got a couple of little gems.

343
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,267
Speaker 0: I'm gonna share but that's it.

344
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,354
Speaker 0: I'm done Underrated anime.

345
00:22:00,394 --> 00:22:04,229
Speaker 0: you should see the first brand new geek nights anime panel in a long goddamn time.

346
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:05,214
Speaker 1: It's anime.

347
00:22:05,234 --> 00:22:08,950
Speaker 1: You should see only ones that he just cut the list apart to be different.

348
00:22:09,952 --> 00:22:11,236
Speaker 0: I'm really because I looked.

349
00:22:11,718 --> 00:22:14,830
Speaker 0: every anime panel we've got has bullshit old slide.

350
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:17,241
Speaker 0: So I'm making this like we make modern panels.

351
00:22:17,884 --> 00:22:21,140
Speaker 0: So I'm making it from scratch and Apocalypse zero is in there.

352
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:22,328
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

353
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,436
Speaker 1: Nor is it underrated?

354
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,765
Speaker 0: I feel like everyone needs to see it exactly once.

355
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:29,094
Speaker 0: no when they're an adult No, they know.

356
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:35,494
Speaker 0: no that is that type of anime is an important Area of anime.

357
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:43,377
Speaker 0: no and knowing what the fuck it's deal is if you're gonna watch one of those fucked up violent weird ass old Anime, I feel like that's the one.

358
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,366
Speaker 0: no, I mean name in that genre.

359
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:51,570
Speaker 1: name a better show to watch The educational channel, which is turning TV off and go outside.

360
00:22:52,152 --> 00:22:55,946
Speaker 0: I mean we said people should play pandemic legacy in our 40 tabletop games.

361
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:56,709
Speaker 0: I don't like that shit.

362
00:22:57,312 --> 00:22:57,774
Speaker 1: I don't know.

363
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,863
Speaker 1: pandemic legacy is different than pandemic, which is garbage.

364
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:01,530
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you don't need to play regular pandemic.

365
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,215
Speaker 1: I haven't played pandemic legacy.

366
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:12,905
Speaker 0: So, you know, I've heard some people say that it might have some redeeming qualities over regular pandemic That I want to point out that that is the most positive you have ever sounded about pandemic.

367
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,150
Speaker 1: I cannot confirm or deny.

368
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,519
Speaker 0: No, do not watch mad bull 34.

369
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,927
Speaker 0: I think you're better off watching a popular apocalypse zero.

370
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:29,749
Speaker 0: No Anyway when I'm not doing those three panels I'm either gonna be playing board games in my hotel room or playing board games in the tabletop area.

371
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,202
Speaker 0: And also I'm not gonna be there on Friday because I'm just go to work.

372
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,002
Speaker 1: I Will not be wasting my time going to Lancaster friends.

373
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:38,470
Speaker 0: I don't know why you're so down on zinc icon.

374
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:39,252
Speaker 0: It's a great.

375
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,476
Speaker 0: It's basically review con.

376
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:44,630
Speaker 0: Plus I I do some panels and otherwise it's just review con.

377
00:23:45,653 --> 00:23:46,717
Speaker 1: I mean Lancaster Pennsylvania.

378
00:23:47,018 --> 00:23:48,081
Speaker 0: Yeah with amazing food.

379
00:23:48,382 --> 00:23:48,543
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

380
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,530
Speaker 0: It's a short train ride on Sunday.

381
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:52,935
Speaker 1: No, they fix that and at night.

382
00:23:53,176 --> 00:23:54,139
Speaker 0: No, there's food now.

383
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,443
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

384
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:57,630
Speaker 0: I talked about this when I reviewed the con last year.

385
00:23:57,971 --> 00:23:58,836
Speaker 0: There's plenty of food now.

386
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:01,549
Speaker 0: all these non-religious restaurants opened up.

387
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,492
Speaker 0: Apparently the locals are mad about it and apparently only non locals eat at these places Mm-hmm.

388
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:08,556
Speaker 0: There's all these like.

389
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:12,250
Speaker 0: there are literally restaurants there that basically people who take the Amtrak from New York.

390
00:24:12,714 --> 00:24:18,650
Speaker 0: No one else does okay Which is sad because when I was on the ski trip this year, we ran into the same thing.

391
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:24,674
Speaker 0: There's this place we eat at which ironically is called the common man And it's got.

392
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:30,156
Speaker 0: its motif is like I don't know farmer Peasants and it's got like.

393
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:47,449
Speaker 0: this logo is literally like a peasant pushing some peasant ass thing But the proprietor of this establishment I was talking to him because we were there alone because we were there like in a time when most tourists don't come in to Ski and he was like, yeah, literally no one who lives within a hundred miles of this place will ever eat here.

394
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:49,734
Speaker 0: Okay, no one can afford to.

395
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:57,137
Speaker 0: this place exists solely for New Yorkers and mostly New Yorkers who come out here to ski And that's it.

396
00:24:57,519 --> 00:24:59,230
Speaker 0: And that's sustainable business model, apparently.

397
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:02,558
Speaker 0: So Ed Piscor, right?

398
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,464
Speaker 1: So we talked about him on the show before.

399
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,310
Speaker 0: I think there's awesome posters, right?

400
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:12,410
Speaker 1: No ed Piscor is the creator of a comic known as hip-hop family tree.

401
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:17,665
Speaker 1: Family tree is a comic which is in.

402
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,890
Speaker 1: ed Piscor is unique.

403
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:21,138
Speaker 1: It's he has a unique style yet.

404
00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,530
Speaker 1: It is familiar to you feel like you've seen this style before Yet you can't name where you've seen it before.

405
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:45,467
Speaker 1: But he made a comic called hip-hop family tree, which is the history of the creation of the hip Genre of music in somewhat documentary but also Somewhat definitely document her somewhat not documentary for that is a photograph.

406
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:46,210
Speaker 0: I'm assuming

407
00:25:48,531 --> 00:26:12,210
Speaker 1: So It was such a mega amazing awesome comic that you should read if you can get your hands on it, which you can just buy it That Marvel the you know, well Disney hired him to make a comic called x-men grand design Which he made joyfully as he is a big-ass x-men nerd a little younger than me, but still a big x-men nerd.

408
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, he grew up drawing some x-men as a kid.

409
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,200
Speaker 1: you know, that's how he ended up doing comics.

410
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:29,586
Speaker 1: and this x-men grand design is Thankfully an x-men comic a normal person can read or at least a normal nerd can read Because it is not involved with any current x-men stuff.

411
00:26:29,646 --> 00:26:33,079
Speaker 1: It is basically Same thing as hip-hop family tree.

412
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,270
Speaker 1: almost you could almost call it x-men family tree.

413
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:46,684
Speaker 1: It is a retelling, you know of the original x-men story in a new Digestible form yet also an old form right.

414
00:26:46,764 --> 00:27:01,290
Speaker 1: and then at the very end of this first volume There's also a bonus which is basically a redrawing of the first issue of x-men just redrawn But otherwise exactly identical to the first issue of x-men just in his style instead of in the original style.

415
00:27:02,811 --> 00:27:04,795
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say that I really enjoyed it first off.

416
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,460
Speaker 0: What uh, it's definitely.

417
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:20,170
Speaker 0: It captures a lot of what x-men is really like in condensed form Meaning that the statement I just said is either a strong positive or a strong negative depending on who you are.

418
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,070
Speaker 1: That's all yeah, it's still x-men, right?

419
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:26,483
Speaker 1: It's not, you know sort of taking the x-men out of x-men.

420
00:27:26,624 --> 00:27:36,270
Speaker 0: It's not read writing anything It's not really changing like plots or back story But what it does do is sort of tie things together.

421
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:36,612
Speaker 1: Right.

422
00:27:36,672 --> 00:27:40,210
Speaker 1: because if you actually read the original real x-men comics, right?

423
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,384
Speaker 1: Let's say you get your hands on every fucking x-men comic ever and you freeze time except for everyone but you so you can read them all.

424
00:27:48,193 --> 00:27:53,615
Speaker 1: You know, there are things that happen and some of those things, you know Sort of come out of nowhere.

425
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:54,338
Speaker 1: They don't have.

426
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:59,169
Speaker 1: you know it, you know, it's like you get time travel You get characters coming in.

427
00:27:59,273 --> 00:28:08,810
Speaker 1: Yeah And it's like things happened and changed over time because writers would change new series would come up Crossover events would happen with the rest of the Marvel Universe.

428
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:18,330
Speaker 0: I would read for a while and then I go to a comic shop and literally just buy like Whatever uncanny x-men was there and it would just be like I wouldn't know what was happening.

429
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be retcons and this and that and all you know things would happen.

430
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:40,950
Speaker 1: But like if you were to say see something happen in x-men issue 200 It's like the things that foreshadow that may have been a non-existent or be only go back a few issues Here, for example, you've got like, you know the sentinel thing which came, you know quite a bit later.

431
00:28:41,231 --> 00:28:43,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, no tied in from the beginning, right?

432
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,690
Speaker 0: They're showing you back to like Xavier finding storm right Farouk and all that like really old ass nonsense, right?

433
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:59,841
Speaker 1: You've got you know, the Phoenix Force, you know being foreshadowed heavily like oh the feet They're like, hey the Phoenix Force is coming Even though if you actually read the comics is sort of like Phoenix for it's like.

434
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:00,363
Speaker 0: what's that?

435
00:29:00,563 --> 00:29:00,804
Speaker 0: Yep.

436
00:29:01,305 --> 00:29:01,787
Speaker 1: Here it is.

437
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:06,770
Speaker 0: I Remember as a kid when the from the dart in the Phoenix shit happened.

438
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:11,949
Speaker 0: I remember feeling dumb and thinking wait, I should know if shouldn't I know what this is.

439
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,716
Speaker 0: Did I just like not read this?

440
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,548
Speaker 0: and I didn't like I didn't understand what the deal was.

441
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:25,950
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean actually bought um, I didn't read the actual Phoenix, you know The famous comic where Sokolov is holding the dead dream girl in the cover.

442
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:41,150
Speaker 1: Yeah That comic and the couple issues before after it until I was living in Beacon and I bought basically like Marvel Essentials essential x-men volume something that contained all those issues in black and white and it's really only like a few issues.

443
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,500
Speaker 1: It's not like this big mega thing that leads into it.

444
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,926
Speaker 1: Right and it's you know, it's like uncanny x-men from like the 80s Like, you know, it's like it comes way deep in.

445
00:29:52,946 --> 00:30:10,950
Speaker 1: Yeah story Whereas here you've got you know in this retelling that's sort of trying to take all the major Plot points of x-men the you know, the big things that happen right get rid of all those meaningless details and you know Month-to-month garbage that doesn't matter, you know the in between the real issues.

446
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,296
Speaker 1: Just take the big major plot points.

447
00:30:13,356 --> 00:30:26,950
Speaker 0: right x-men are created because X their magneto is here and Xavier Yeah, there's magnetos deal if you want to know like Other than oh he was in the Holocaust and then he has reasons, right?

448
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,705
Speaker 1: It's like basically he you know, well, how did why did professor X already know storm?

449
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,090
Speaker 0: Like what's Jean Grey's deal?

450
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,134
Speaker 0: Where did you really come from?

451
00:30:34,395 --> 00:30:44,303
Speaker 1: Yeah, all this stuff is You know Told without any cruft and it sort of feels a bit hurried because you're only going over these major details

452
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:53,294
Speaker 0: and it feels somewhat disjointed because literally read a page and it's like Professor X deals with Farouk over the span of like six panels like that entire story.

453
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,720
Speaker 0: the next page is like what was magneto doing?

454
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,553
Speaker 1: Yep, it's like you might not even realize you're like, oh, it's magneto.

455
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:01,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually took me a couple panels.

456
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:07,131
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right, that's what's going on And that only it helped that I had all this x-men knowledge.

457
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,804
Speaker 1: if you don't have x-men knowledge at all I can't.

458
00:31:10,844 --> 00:31:13,075
Speaker 1: I don't know if this will be I can't tell.

459
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:24,177
Speaker 1: this will either be great for you because it'll allow you to get the big picture of What the egg all the major things that happen to the x-men the important parts of the story without the garbage.

460
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:24,960
Speaker 1: that's hard to understand.

461
00:31:25,361 --> 00:31:30,660
Speaker 1: Honestly, I didn't know or you might not know what the hell is going on because you've never read any x-men before.

462
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,769
Speaker 1: Like who the hell are these people?

463
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,808
Speaker 1: there's no character development No character advanced for the x-men that I had read.

464
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:38,096
Speaker 0: I never knew who the fuck Namor was.

465
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:40,854
Speaker 1: Oh, you know Namor I never read those parts.

466
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:41,440
Speaker 0: I had no idea.

467
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:41,922
Speaker 1: that's that.

468
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:49,506
Speaker 1: well see the thing is that's actually a very interesting part of this x-men grand design because Namor the Submariner was.

469
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:50,489
Speaker 1: you know, he is a mutant.

470
00:31:50,649 --> 00:32:03,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that part of you know Establishing why humanity hates mutants it being Namor's fault of sort of making the wrong first impression Was not really in x-men comics.

471
00:32:03,937 --> 00:32:06,284
Speaker 1: That was a Motherfucking comic.

472
00:32:06,364 --> 00:32:07,528
Speaker 1: Namor is way.

473
00:32:07,668 --> 00:32:11,240
Speaker 1: Namor is like one of the original Marvel things from like decades before the x-men.

474
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,810
Speaker 1: He predates the x-men by like a zillion years.

475
00:32:14,152 --> 00:32:15,216
Speaker 1: the fact that he's a mutant.

476
00:32:15,336 --> 00:32:18,065
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Came way later.

477
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 1: This is originally just like the prince or king of Atlantis who is evil.

478
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:30,080
Speaker 1: This is actually the thing that caused more not really evil but sort of you know Seen as evil by humans, right?

479
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:40,643
Speaker 0: So when I was younger like middle school elementary school every time I started reading x-men the other kids who read more comics than me would always Like like.

480
00:32:40,684 --> 00:32:43,492
Speaker 0: I wouldn't know about shit like Namor and they all knew.

481
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:51,076
Speaker 0: and I and it wasn't until much later in my life That I realized there were all like you had to read non x-men comics to understand.

482
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:52,100
Speaker 1: see I going on.

483
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:54,332
Speaker 0: I just assumed that they knew and I didn't understand.

484
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:55,257
Speaker 1: why see I cheat?

485
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:58,256
Speaker 1: when I was a kid There were only three kinds of comics that I read.

486
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:07,975
Speaker 1: I read Spider-man, but I read spider-man 2099 because it started at issue one and in 1990 Whatever two three and it was cyberpunk.

487
00:33:08,256 --> 00:33:10,326
Speaker 1: So it was the best I read like still the best.

488
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,140
Speaker 1: if you want to read I highly recommend spider-man 2099.

489
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,710
Speaker 0: I also I read x-force and like later uncanny x-men.

490
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,520
Speaker 1: I also read all that infinity stuff, which is becoming very relevant.

491
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,008
Speaker 1: It's good to have that knowledge today.

492
00:33:22,029 --> 00:33:25,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though I'm not watching that movie And three.

493
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,555
Speaker 0: so the best part about that movie is of course like a ton of characters die.

494
00:33:28,977 --> 00:33:29,760
Speaker 0: from what I gather.

495
00:33:29,961 --> 00:33:32,656
Speaker 1: Well in the comic half the superheroes died, but then they undyed.

496
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:33,300
Speaker 0: so from what?

497
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is something like I was curious about this.

498
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:52,280
Speaker 0: it appears that the majority of the people who went to see this movie have mostly just been watching MCU and I Realized if you've never actually read comics and just watch the movies the idea that superheroes die all the time And like that's just a thing is unknown

499
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:53,580
Speaker 1: All right.

500
00:33:53,761 --> 00:34:02,695
Speaker 0: So teenagers who have watched every Marvel Cinematic Universe thing and read zero comics are Freaking the fuck out because all their favorite characters are dead.

501
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:04,020
Speaker 1: They'll be back in the next movie.

502
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:06,918
Speaker 1: They'll have different actors coming back.

503
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,908
Speaker 1: Those are mostly just to kill off the contracts.

504
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:16,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they literally don't know that like Superman died a hundred times He died the first time he died.

505
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:17,110
Speaker 1: It was a big deal.

506
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:21,239
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the first time a super big superhero died It was a big deal and then we learned and knew better.

507
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:24,980
Speaker 1: But yeah, well anyway Was I saying?

508
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:34,339
Speaker 1: Right, and I read the Infinity comics and I read x-men comics right now and the way I knew about other things in Marvel anyway.

509
00:34:35,023 --> 00:34:37,536
Speaker 1: Well, I was like collected superhero cards.

510
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,607
Speaker 1: I cards to but Characters were without having to.

511
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:45,857
Speaker 1: I didn't read any Namor moon Knight or fantastic or con.

512
00:34:45,897 --> 00:34:46,960
Speaker 1: I mean I've read them later.

513
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,440
Speaker 1: But as a kid, I didn't read any of those other comics never read an Avengers comic I never read any of that garbage, but I knew who Iron Man was a new Captain America was.

514
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,660
Speaker 1: I knew what their origins were what their deals were and all this stuff.

515
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,774
Speaker 1: because I read those superhero cards that I collected I collect.

516
00:35:01,794 --> 00:35:07,172
Speaker 1: there was then when they were Like single panel references to these other characters and things.

517
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:18,019
Speaker 1: and also there was for example one time There was a series right after there was fatal attractions Which is the the crossover between all the different X series which let me learn all the X for.

518
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,505
Speaker 0: yeah I read fatal attractions.

519
00:35:19,606 --> 00:35:22,420
Speaker 1: There was that's the one where Wolverine got all the metal ripped out of him.

520
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:31,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, right after that cuz then he had the bone right right after that the next there was immediately a second crossover Which is the x-men Avengers like blood ties cross.

521
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,407
Speaker 0: Oh, that is when I stopped reading.

522
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:37,140
Speaker 1: but I read that and that's how I knew who some Avengers were at that point.

523
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,164
Speaker 1: Right and things like that.

524
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,348
Speaker 0: I never read any Avengers.

525
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:44,854
Speaker 1: I mean I that's the only Avengers I read was yeah Not even that I just didn't care.

526
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:49,136
Speaker 1: later on I guess I read Kree's girl war which is include some event.

527
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,000
Speaker 0: part of what messed it up.

528
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,466
Speaker 0: Is that because I got into anime so young?

529
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:57,500
Speaker 0: I was like trying to read x-men after I'd already discovered anime.

530
00:35:58,203 --> 00:36:04,796
Speaker 0: So as soon as I found as soon as manga was purchasable by me I basically stopped reading American comics for like a decade.

531
00:36:04,816 --> 00:36:10,680
Speaker 1: I Stopped reading the comics when they comic book store went away, and then it got anime.

532
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,753
Speaker 0: Yep, but like I read one manga, and I was like whoa.

533
00:36:14,396 --> 00:36:18,197
Speaker 1: This is a comic Mm-hmm anyway, but yeah if you.

534
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,780
Speaker 1: So this x-men grand design by the way is like a large.

535
00:36:22,061 --> 00:36:24,391
Speaker 1: It's not a. you're gonna get the trade paperback.

536
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:25,295
Speaker 0: Don't get the trade.

537
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:26,360
Speaker 0: get this giant ass book.

538
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:26,862
Speaker 1: That's it well.

539
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:28,529
Speaker 1: No then this is the trade paperback.

540
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,477
Speaker 1: There's a hardcover is the other one?

541
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:31,300
Speaker 0: don't get the hardcover.

542
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,932
Speaker 1: So this is a. this is like it's like a Marvel Treasury Edition.

543
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:37,600
Speaker 1: It's not a normal size trade paperback.

544
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:45,906
Speaker 1: It's like this big fucking thing and the pages are like not quite newspaper size But they but they feel very newsprint.

545
00:36:46,006 --> 00:36:48,173
Speaker 1: It's bigger than an old-life magazine.

546
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,740
Speaker 0: I'd say oh easily bigger than life magazine.

547
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:50,921
Speaker 0: It's.

548
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,044
Speaker 1: the point is is big.

549
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:53,910
Speaker 1: It's not a normal size book.

550
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:56,098
Speaker 0: I can't actually like get it all in frame here.

551
00:36:56,118 --> 00:37:03,140
Speaker 1: Yeah It's at least it's probably like it's like a legal pad, but whiter almost.

552
00:37:04,701 --> 00:37:05,163
Speaker 0: I had trouble.

553
00:37:05,203 --> 00:37:09,380
Speaker 0: I was reading it in bed, and I wanted to set it down, and it wouldn't fit on the tiny table.

554
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,147
Speaker 1: It's not thick or heavy.

555
00:37:12,247 --> 00:37:12,870
Speaker 1: It's just big.

556
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:16,085
Speaker 1: it's gonna take up like it's like laptop size Maybe even like 15.

557
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,074
Speaker 0: this is way bigger than my laptop.

558
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:19,400
Speaker 1: It's bigger than my laptop, too.

559
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:21,944
Speaker 1: It's bigger than my big iPad.

560
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:26,818
Speaker 1: so it needs to be that big because the art blows up to that big.

561
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:33,700
Speaker 1: really well I'm gonna say even though like it includes a lot of the corniness If they come out with a smaller edition you don't want the smaller edition.

562
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:37,777
Speaker 1: But just got to know it's a big book if you buy it on Amazon, but

563
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:49,080
Speaker 0: most of the joy I got from reading it is just that it was a condensed Feeling of what it was like when I was reading comics as a kid, but condensed to my adult.

564
00:37:50,041 --> 00:37:55,887
Speaker 0: Let's move it along sensibilities, and I really enjoyed just Looking at all this art.

565
00:37:55,968 --> 00:37:58,860
Speaker 0: I really like like this style of comic art.

566
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:03,140
Speaker 0: You know One of these pages would be a great poster.

567
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:15,760
Speaker 1: There's another so you get Charles Xavier with dot eyes and dot eyes is one of my favorite things googly eyes, but There is another x-men series from that was not super recent, but somewhat recent.

568
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,562
Speaker 1: I think it's.

569
00:38:16,583 --> 00:38:21,999
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's x-men forever it might be called and what that is is it's basically.

570
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:36,600
Speaker 1: you know There's the wheat this uncanny accent, but then this adjective list x-men We read where the first issue with Jim yeah, yeah with the full all the multiple fold-out covers Yeah So that adjective was x-men sort of got away from where it started at a certain point.

571
00:38:37,101 --> 00:38:42,180
Speaker 1: And is that more recent series is basically ignoring all other x-men continuity.

572
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:56,158
Speaker 1: it basically just picks a spot in that series where it's veers off and cancels everything that veers off and just starts at that veering off point and Keeps going as if it had been had the same writer the whole time now.

573
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,879
Speaker 1: This is one thing I like about the MCU and it has only these 90s character designs with it.

574
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:09,591
Speaker 0: I'm hoping the MCU will keep its continuity and never Split off again like they're releasing the movies and slow enough right?

575
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:13,140
Speaker 1: or the people who are the realities of actors and money-making.

576
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:15,217
Speaker 0: That will never happen yeah, but we'll see how it goes cuz.

577
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:20,038
Speaker 0: right now It's coming at a sustainable rate because instead of read this whole series then this whole series.

578
00:39:20,098 --> 00:39:22,184
Speaker 0: It's literally There's 19 movies.

579
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:23,910
Speaker 0: Just watch a movie and then watch a movie.

580
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's 19 movies.

581
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:25,757
Speaker 1: wait until there's 190 movies.

582
00:39:27,002 --> 00:39:28,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean I've watched.

583
00:39:28,229 --> 00:39:29,860
Speaker 0: I've watched all of Sailor Moon in a weekend.

584
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:31,528
Speaker 0: That's 200 episodes.

585
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:33,879
Speaker 1: you're gonna watch all the superhero movies in a weekend.

586
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:35,464
Speaker 1: Their movies.

587
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:36,990
Speaker 1: it must be 90 minutes right these things.

588
00:39:38,182 --> 00:39:39,610
Speaker 0: I mean I've seen a few of them.

589
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,299
Speaker 1: there are at least 90 minutes each right?

590
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:50,838
Speaker 0: yeah the trouble is the ones I enjoyed the most were Guardians of the Galaxy one and I Haven't seen Thor Ragnarok yet, so I don't have any opinions on it.

591
00:39:51,786 --> 00:39:56,229
Speaker 0: Yeah Guardians of the Galaxy Doctor Strange was okay, but I don't need to watch it again.

592
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,173
Speaker 1: the main problem.

593
00:39:57,233 --> 00:40:03,464
Speaker 1: Is that they don't have the Aesthetic enough.

594
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:07,039
Speaker 1: the comics you know Marvel Comics that I like have that.

595
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:13,158
Speaker 0: Well even in this one in Grand Design in the very beginning you get the watcher and his recorder.

596
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,407
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, that's actually really.

597
00:40:15,568 --> 00:40:19,805
Speaker 1: you know cuz that the watcher doesn't show up in x-men comics very Right.

598
00:40:19,826 --> 00:40:30,210
Speaker 0: so the fact that they bring him in there Really sort of sets the tone of like what this just I love the fact that he's standing there with his hand on his chin Just like I have watch now.

599
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,158
Speaker 0: I'm going to record on a tape.

600
00:40:32,198 --> 00:40:43,640
Speaker 1: well the reason He's watching right is not just to sort of you know provide a non corny intro at the start Which is often the watchers use in Marvel Comics is to provide this sort of narration.

601
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you see what's going on here.

602
00:40:45,858 --> 00:40:58,000
Speaker 1: well But it is here it actually serves a second purpose and that it shows it says is the story of the x-men Which is usually a very local story a very American story an earth story, right?

603
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:07,420
Speaker 1: It only goes into space when you're dealing with Cyclops is dead Which actually they totally bring into the fold here properly right and you know instead of having it come out of nowhere the starjammers.

604
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:24,260
Speaker 1: But he you know combined with the Phoenix force it shows how the x-men it sort of takes the x-men story and shows How it is a grand you know design a universal design of some sort and not just this local story, right?

605
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it does this does do a very good job.

606
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:33,471
Speaker 0: It is comic of fitting the x-men shit into this like giant Apocalyptic future space world right.

607
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:37,674
Speaker 1: it's sort of you know whereas before again It was just sort of like you know a Marvel comic.

608
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,866
Speaker 1: if you read it over time It's just sort of bouncing around.

609
00:41:39,906 --> 00:41:40,268
Speaker 1: It's like well.

610
00:41:40,288 --> 00:41:42,840
Speaker 1: What do we do the x-men now into space with you, right?

611
00:41:43,343 --> 00:41:44,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, where you know here?

612
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,060
Speaker 1: It's like you know by having that watcher there all this stuff for the Shi'ar come.

613
00:41:49,181 --> 00:41:53,258
Speaker 1: I guess professor X didn't date the Shi'ar Queen yet, but yeah that comes later.

614
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,959
Speaker 1: spoilers And the Phoenix.

615
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:03,540
Speaker 1: Find out what Magneto's up to right, but you know they sort of you know it helps tie.

616
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,020
Speaker 1: He's tying all those random x-men bits together into a grand design.

617
00:42:10,222 --> 00:42:11,196
Speaker 1: Right which is what makes it?

618
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,246
Speaker 1: Great and more comprehensible.

619
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:13,507
