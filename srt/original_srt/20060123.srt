1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,657
Speaker 1: It's Monday January 23rd, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:17,780
Speaker 1: tonight We have special guest and scientist Peter Olson here to talk with us about the dangers of pseudoscience.

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:27,199
Speaker 1: Let's do this so as many of you might have seen in the forums Uh I had a little trouble with right stuff over the past six days.

4
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:29,837
Speaker 2: Those are those people with the giant anime catalog.

5
00:00:29,857 --> 00:00:33,791
Speaker 1: right yeah And I hadn't ordered from them in a long time like once.

6
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:47,340
Speaker 1: I called in an order like way way back and just Recently they had a crazy crazy deal that a good friend of mine told me about and you know Cosmo warrior Which is in that whole my tell universe, and it was super cheap like four bucks DVDs, so I thought what the hell?

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,408
Speaker 1: I'll make an account on right stuff and order it.

8
00:00:50,889 --> 00:00:52,956
Speaker 1: I mean they're they're pretty much the biggest name in that.

9
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,220
Speaker 1: what could go wrong?

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:11,980
Speaker 1: well you see apparently some people have trouble and some people don't and It turns out that they do manual credit card verification and manual credit card charging Meaning instead of having the big machine that most companies have you just swipe, and it just takes care of the credit card.

11
00:01:12,502 --> 00:01:21,638
Speaker 1: They have a dude who looks at your number and then he calls your credit card company Verifies your address over the phone with them and then asks to make a charge against it.

12
00:01:23,412 --> 00:01:25,818
Speaker 1: and they failed to do this with my credit card.

13
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,659
Speaker 1: and After that they called me like five times and she kept asking me for various information.

14
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,878
Speaker 1: at one point They asked me for the customer service number of my own credit card.

15
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:41,666
Speaker 2: So I had people ask for that before like on various sites and things But not often.

16
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:43,819
Speaker 2: usually they ask for that little number on the back.

17
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:47,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the PSC or whatever it's called whatever the hell They call it.

18
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,918
Speaker 2: And then they have a you know a credit card processing computer that just you type in your number And it automatically does everything and there isn't a person on the other end.

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,393
Speaker 2: That's the whole point of having an you know.

20
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:58,097
Speaker 2: What do they call it?

21
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:06,159
Speaker 2: E-commerce you know an internet store is that you don't need a Checkout clerk to handle your order?

22
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:13,220
Speaker 1: Well, basically it's worse than that because their online store is not an online store like other online stores.

23
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:18,380
Speaker 1: When you make an order in their online store, you might as well have called in an order or faxed them an order.

24
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:19,379
Speaker 1: It's no different.

25
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,471
Speaker 1: Wow, it's just.

26
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:36,108
Speaker 1: it's all manual and so it really just depends on your credit card company because whatever it was they couldn't seem to And they kept calling me.

27
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:36,751
Speaker 1: I got sick of it.

28
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:36,972
Speaker 1: fine.

29
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:38,198
Speaker 1: I just told him to cancel the order.

30
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:49,458
Speaker 1: That's easy, and they were kind of indignant, but I mean I'm a big I'm a proponent of anime companies doing good things But right stuff didn't do me a good thing really pisses me off when companies.

31
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:54,756
Speaker 2: Just don't Upgrade and use new technologies or don't use technology properly.

32
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,708
Speaker 2: It's like alright You have a company.

33
00:02:56,991 --> 00:03:03,500
Speaker 2: sure you might be profitable But you could make your company like a thousand times more awesome if you just did these three simple things.

34
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:11,698
Speaker 2: But no everyone at your company is a Luddite or is old-fashioned Or doesn't know anything and you don't even know enough to hire someone like me to tell you what you don't know.

35
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:13,764
Speaker 1: see it's not Even just small companies like this.

36
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:20,851
Speaker 1: I mean I work for IBM pretty much one of the biggest like big iron old-school tech companies And even inside IBM.

37
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 1: They just have no clue about Technology in the outside world and the fact that the way they do a lot of things is old crusty expensive and obsolete.

38
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's even scarier is a lot of times.

39
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:33,053
Speaker 1: They don't believe me.

40
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:35,044
Speaker 1: I'll tell them uh You could.

41
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:46,018
Speaker 1: that could be done within a week And they'll laugh at me and they expect it to take like five months and cost a hundred thousand dollars When Scott over here could probably code what I want in a week for nothing not for nothing.

42
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,166
Speaker 2: well for time Yeah, I cost a lot.

43
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:48,869
Speaker 1: Yeah.

44
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:49,511
Speaker 1: I'm not cheap.

45
00:03:50,114 --> 00:03:50,576
Speaker 1: It's funny.

46
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:51,278
Speaker 1: I have it.

47
00:03:52,003 --> 00:04:01,648
Speaker 1: I mean I always tell people I have a consulting rate and It seems to vary and I've discovered that whenever I think of my consulting rate It basically just shows me how much my time is worth.

48
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:02,190
Speaker 1: at this moment.

49
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:08,648
Speaker 1: it ranges from twenty to a hundred and eighty dollars an hour Depending on how I feel Depends on what you want me to do.

50
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:12,446
Speaker 2: I mean Oh Scott We need you to educate us about.

51
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:13,730
Speaker 2: you know LDAP.

52
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:17,502
Speaker 2: my consulting fee is a thousand dollars an hour Scott.

53
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,366
Speaker 2: we need you to write.

54
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,651
Speaker 2: make this video game for us.

55
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:23,522
Speaker 2: my consulting fee is one dollar an hour Scott.

56
00:04:23,562 --> 00:04:26,031
Speaker 2: we need you to go lay and have fun with those hot girls.

57
00:04:26,212 --> 00:04:28,540
Speaker 2: my consulting fee is negative ten dollars an hour.

58
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 1: I don't think you're gonna get that for ten dollars an hour.

59
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:32,995
Speaker 1: You're kind of gangly.

60
00:04:34,004 --> 00:04:34,991
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's still.

61
00:04:35,152 --> 00:04:36,179
Speaker 2: you know you get the idea.

62
00:04:38,684 --> 00:04:48,502
Speaker 1: So we only have one news today, but being science and tech day It's a science and tech news, and it's one that we probably have a lot to say about Now.

63
00:04:49,084 --> 00:05:08,666
Speaker 1: for the longest time pretty much since Windows 2000 and it got even bigger in XP That Windows has had signed drivers Meaning that you know you have hardware like I don't know a PCI card a video card, and there's a driver that you need to make that card work and You need and the driver.

64
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,878
Speaker 1: normally you just get it from the manufacturer and install it.

65
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:22,997
Speaker 1: now Windows started saying that if you pay them a pile of money, it's like 500 bucks a year per license or something silly like that and They test your driver and decide that it's kosher in whatever weird criteria.

66
00:05:23,037 --> 00:05:23,560
Speaker 1: They have.

67
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:27,280
Speaker 1: Then your driver will be signed and it'll install without a problem.

68
00:05:28,045 --> 00:05:37,122
Speaker 1: But if your driver isn't signed and you try to install it Windows would give you a little error message and say hey hey this driver might break your computer and kill your firstborn son and make You impotent.

69
00:05:37,906 --> 00:05:39,533
Speaker 1: now any of you use Windows 2000 or XP.

70
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:42,304
Speaker 1: you've probably seen that a bunch of times And if you're smart you just ignored it.

71
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:54,700
Speaker 1: well Windows Vista in all of Microsoft's infinite wisdom is making this mandatory Meaning if your driver isn't signed you cannot install it no matter what root administrator privileges you have.

72
00:05:55,301 --> 00:06:02,722
Speaker 2: Well, that's gonna be pretty much mean Microsoft can say that hardware is allowed to work on Windows and that hardware can never work on Windows.

73
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:21,439
Speaker 2: yeah, I mean little companies aren't gonna want to pay for this and people who make hardware that needs to interact or connect to Windows computers or work inside of Windows computers Aren't gonna be able to make that hardware work without paying Microsoft lots of money.

74
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:25,574
Speaker 1: and Even aside from the money it takes control away from me.

75
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:33,215
Speaker 1: if I have Windows And I want to do something to my own copy of Windows I should be able to do whatever I want if I don't install a broken driver.

76
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:34,200
Speaker 1: That's my prerogative.

77
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:45,240
Speaker 2: Yeah, what if I make a piece of hardware cuz I'm all cool like that And I want to plug it into my computer and make it do something I can't with Windows cuz I can't write a driver unless I pay Microsoft a pile of money.

78
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:56,745
Speaker 1: Now apparently this only applies to 64-bit Applications or the 64-bit version of Windows, but a lot of people have speculated that there is going to be in fact No, 32-bit version.

79
00:06:57,427 --> 00:06:59,153
Speaker 2: there probably won't be a 32-bit version.

80
00:06:59,194 --> 00:07:00,799
Speaker 2: so cuz I don't think Vista is.

81
00:07:01,606 --> 00:07:07,754
Speaker 2: I think Vista is too bloated And it was written for 64-bit, and I don't think Microsoft took the time to write it for 32 and 64-bit.

82
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:17,889
Speaker 2: so That but I'm pretty sure it's gonna be 64-bit only yeah And that's fine because most newer computers are 64-bit.

83
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:20,676
Speaker 2: You're gonna need a newer computer to run Vista anyway.

84
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:27,542
Speaker 1: now theoretically It also says that this only actually applies to kernel mode drivers.

85
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:35,593
Speaker 1: so anything that requires access to hardware or certain kernel hooks or Basically anything that's low-level which includes almost all drivers.

86
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:37,160
Speaker 2: That's pretty much everything important.

87
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:41,000
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm pretty sure that actually even includes USB devices and stuff.

88
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,712
Speaker 1: I mean we don't know all the details yet since Vista isn't even out and

89
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:49,664
Speaker 2: there's a lot of Windows technology is a secret anyway That we don't understand and no one understands, but

90
00:07:49,704 --> 00:08:00,379
Speaker 1: for any of you who really don't see why this is a big deal consider this Nvidia I mean ATI is all well and good But Nvidia pretty much makes the best video cards and the best drivers in general.

91
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,040
Speaker 1: now for the longest time You could download the Nvidia reference driver the official Nvidia driver for any Nvidia card.

92
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:10,688
Speaker 1: You still do and you know what.

93
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:13,180
Speaker 1: back then it wasn't signed on Windows.

94
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:19,113
Speaker 1: Nope If that happened now, it just wouldn't run and you couldn't use your fancy new video card.

95
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:31,755
Speaker 2: also a lot of times now You'll see people releasing like they'll take the Nvidia driver And they'll like modify it to do something special Like when people modify the ATI driver to cheat in video games and stuff like that.

96
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:33,220
Speaker 2: you won't be able to do that.

97
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,960
Speaker 2: You'll have to pretty much ATI and Nvidia will probably pay Microsoft to make their drivers signed.

98
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:44,477
Speaker 2: But so you'll be able to use the official Nvidia and ATI drivers, but you won't be able to use anything else.

99
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,540
Speaker 2: every other.

100
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:51,336
Speaker 2: You know hackers special gamers modified modified drivers all of those will disappear.

101
00:08:51,437 --> 00:08:52,580
Speaker 2: They won't exist for Vista.

102
00:08:54,181 --> 00:09:01,759
Speaker 1: Now here are the three clauses that because basically what I'm about to read is going to reveal to you exactly why Microsoft is doing this.

103
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:03,205
Speaker 1: There are three.

104
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:05,737
Speaker 1: these are the three clauses that are from the Microsoft article.

105
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:24,746
Speaker 1: citing all this One drivers must be signed for devices that quote stream protected content this includes audio drivers and that they have this acronym a protected user mode audio or Puma and protected audio path or PEP and Video drivers that can handle the same.

106
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,135
Speaker 1: so basically anything involving DRM.

107
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:29,720
Speaker 1: You can't touch in your computer anymore.

108
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:36,960
Speaker 2: well It actually what it is is a way to enforce DRM in that you won't be able to use a device.

109
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:45,080
Speaker 2: you won't be able to take a device that say has an open analog hole or Something like that and plug it into your computer.

110
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:53,928
Speaker 2: So your hop edges and things like that just probably won't work because Microsoft won't approve those drivers Yeah which aren't nice to DRM any that.

111
00:09:54,089 --> 00:10:03,979
Speaker 1: and you couldn't just write a piece of software that looks at the data screen stream and Takes the video out of it in an unencrypted form because the Windows kernel just won't let you do that without a sign driver.

112
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:09,390
Speaker 1: The second one unsigned kernel mode software will not load and will not run.

113
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:17,860
Speaker 1: So any software that uses kernel mode in any way can't run period unless that could be construed as a security thing.

114
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,259
Speaker 2: And it's good in some ways but in other ways.

115
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:24,780
Speaker 2: You know sometimes I want to write stuff down there.

116
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:37,880
Speaker 1: It'd be fine if I could sign thing like maybe say if Windows did this by default It won't run anything unsigned But say every copy of Windows had its own signing mechanism so that you could manually sign anything you wanted to run.

117
00:10:38,442 --> 00:10:39,105
Speaker 1: That'd be fine.

118
00:10:39,146 --> 00:10:42,220
Speaker 1: That actually be a really good security fix for Windows in general?

119
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,560
Speaker 2: Well, it would be as a dialog box or it'd be like do you want to sign it?

120
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,220
Speaker 2: Yes, it would be no different than what we have now.

121
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,126
Speaker 1: Well, unless you'd made it hidden and undocumented.

122
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,131
Speaker 1: It's only like freaking geeks could do it.

123
00:10:52,014 --> 00:10:55,040
Speaker 2: I guess but making it's just obscurity It's not real security.

124
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,740
Speaker 2: You know I'm saying because then the hackers would just sign things and send them out or send something to you.

125
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,717
Speaker 2: Maybe if you time you get your computer to sign it and then it's.

126
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:03,240
Speaker 2: you know what I'm saying.

127
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean if you at least hide the key to an individual computer there are ways to do it.

128
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,093
Speaker 1: It'd be good for corporate environments and all that BS.

129
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:11,179
Speaker 2: It'd be alright.

130
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:17,100
Speaker 1: and Three even users with administrator privileges cannot load unsigned kernel mode code.

131
00:11:17,481 --> 00:11:23,080
Speaker 1: This applies for any software module that loads including device drivers filter drivers and kernel services.

132
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:32,743
Speaker 2: so basically it means If you're running Windows Vista, then you have a Windows computer, and you cannot do Windows.

133
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:38,219
Speaker 2: Microsoft can control your computer to make it so that you cannot force your computer to do everything that it can do.

134
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:53,983
Speaker 2: it's like if I had a car and in the car were a bunch of features like power windows and a sunroof and heated seats and anti-lock brakes right but and anti-lock brakes?

135
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:56,413
Speaker 2: whoa those violate copyright they don't.

136
00:11:56,514 --> 00:12:04,068
Speaker 2: but let's just pretend that anti-lock brakes equals copying movies, right that's quite a metaphor.

137
00:12:04,088 --> 00:12:04,592
Speaker 1: you got going for

138
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:17,759
Speaker 2: the sake of my analogy and Microsoft could from far away even though my car has any lock brakes in it say you know what we're gonna disable all analog brakes For you, and you're never gonna be able to use them even though you've got them.

139
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,599
Speaker 2: And it's your car and you own every part of that car.

140
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:27,340
Speaker 2: We are the owners of the operating system on that car and we decide we don't want anyone using analog brakes So you can't use them all right Scott?

141
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,183
Speaker 1: You know what that'd be like?

142
00:12:28,544 --> 00:12:36,552
Speaker 1: that'd be like if I had a computer running Windows Vista and Microsoft had a way to Control my computer from afar and prevent me from doing things.

143
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:53,240
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's exactly what it's kind of like the way we have it on cell phones now where cell phones can do all sorts of great stuff, but The cell phone providers like Verizon and Sprint and whoever singular They don't let your cell phone do everything that it can do because then they won't be able to rip you off.

144
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:53,779
Speaker 2: I have hiccups.

145
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:58,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's pissed me off for the longest time that my cell phone has GPS in it.

146
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:03,065
Speaker 1: It's not the most accurate GPS because it gets it from the cell towers But it's still GPS.

147
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,159
Speaker 1: my cell phone also has a data cable that can come off of it.

148
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:17,484
Speaker 1: there is no way in the world to get that GPS data to come down that data cable into my hands.

149
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,807
Speaker 2: it's In the cell phone and the network.

150
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:23,041
Speaker 2: this well that the hardware in the cell phone and the network the cell phone is attached To.

151
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:34,500
Speaker 2: but because the software running on the cell phone is completely controlled by the cell phone provider And so is the network they won't allow you to do that even though you own the cell.

152
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,505
Speaker 1: Why does all this happen?

153
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:36,129
Speaker 1: money.

154
00:13:36,571 --> 00:13:38,160
Speaker 1: people are assholes and they want your money?

155
00:13:38,780 --> 00:14:02,092
Speaker 2: I'm gonna recommend to everyone in the universe that no matter what crazy games come out be it half-life 12 or counter-strike awesome or God knows what you know amazing MMO number 10. when Windows XP has died out and is no longer useful and Vista is the only way to go if this sort of regime is still in place I think Linux is the only option.

156
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:07,540
Speaker 2: besides well, I guess Mac But yeah might have some of the same DRM is going on - who knows I mean seriously work.

157
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,977
Speaker 1: I'm not saying oh you have to dump windows now because if you want to play games you got to run Windows 2000 Windows XP.

158
00:14:13,382 --> 00:14:19,880
Speaker 1: But look to the future and be aware that you might not be able to use Windows Vista the way you expect.

159
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:27,185
Speaker 2: Yeah, imagine if you know you have this giant collection of mp3s in your XP computer, and then one day XP is useless.

160
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,749
Speaker 2: There's a giant security hole in it.

161
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,494
Speaker 2: Microsoft says we're never gonna fix it.

162
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,237
Speaker 2: XP is dead.

163
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:41,459
Speaker 2: you have to use Vista and you haven't learned Linux yet and you're all your mp3s are stuck in this XP machine, which is being destroyed by viruses.

164
00:14:41,479 --> 00:14:45,959
Speaker 2: and So you get a Vista machine and now your mp3 collection is dead.

165
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,570
Speaker 1: I mean this isn't the only problem with Vista.

166
00:14:49,951 --> 00:14:52,740
Speaker 1: Vista has is not going to be easily pirated if at all.

167
00:14:54,002 --> 00:14:54,384
Speaker 1: Due to.

168
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:57,160
Speaker 1: I mean you know XP as its online authentication.

169
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:00,593
Speaker 1: Vista is gonna be about a thousand times that.

170
00:15:01,257 --> 00:15:04,239
Speaker 2: yeah pretty much No one's gonna pirate it, but no one's gonna want to pirate it.

171
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,227
Speaker 1: So well the other thing is that it's so bloated.

172
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:11,438
Speaker 1: you realize that they're claiming Vista won't run on pretty much any PC on the market today.

173
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,479
Speaker 2: Wow isn't this supposed to come out this year?

174
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,251
Speaker 1: I don't actually know when it's coming out.

175
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:20,592
Speaker 2: I think it's coming out this year So it might run on like high-end computers.

176
00:15:20,773 --> 00:15:24,632
Speaker 1: You know yeah, cuz that statistic I just mentioned was from a month or two ago.

177
00:15:24,652 --> 00:15:30,336
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows actually a few months ago Actually, it was about four months ago now that I think about it.

178
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:52,158
Speaker 1: time's moving too quick So my thing of the day isn't a new thing But it's something that while I had been vaguely aware of I was not aware quite of the extent to which it goes until just recently and It's cute and scary at the same time.

179
00:15:53,003 --> 00:16:03,560
Speaker 1: now I don't know how many of you are familiar with this concept, but uh OS tons or Our or s chan's is there sometimes called or basically cute chibi female?

180
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,059
Speaker 1: personifications of major operating systems.

181
00:16:07,924 --> 00:16:09,514
Speaker 2: Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.

182
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:24,640
Speaker 2: so Someone takes a computer operating system like I don't know Commodore 64 OS whatever it was called and They turn it into a cute little anime character.

183
00:16:25,741 --> 00:16:33,902
Speaker 1: Alright, I mean it goes to the point that all the different OS characters are well-defined and people in this community get yelled at if They deviate.

184
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:43,320
Speaker 1: apparently they even correlate things like breast size and appetite to such things as Gooey flashiness and memory requirements.

185
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:46,933
Speaker 1: Wow apparently Windows XP is fairly well-endowed.

186
00:16:47,234 --> 00:16:54,052
Speaker 1: Windows 2000 eats a lot Yeah, and they all have OS X that have the biggest tutors right.

187
00:16:54,252 --> 00:16:56,580
Speaker 1: there don't seem to be so many of Macs.

188
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:01,520
Speaker 1: They're mostly the various Windows operating systems though the two DOS girls are kind of cute actually.

189
00:17:01,982 --> 00:17:04,934
Speaker 2: What about some Linux action and maybe some BSDs?

190
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:09,780
Speaker 1: There's a Longhorn There's new Linux, and it's just funny like goat looking girl.

191
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:21,140
Speaker 1: Now there's a lot of Japanese puns that might not make sense to people in English But pretty much this is the most punny thing I've ever come close to understanding in Japanese.

192
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:22,586
Speaker 1: But it's all.

193
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,556
Speaker 1: it's nothing about puns like.

194
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,460
Speaker 1: here's a nice example.

195
00:17:26,263 --> 00:17:28,819
Speaker 1: The Windows girls are often seen carrying scallions.

196
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:32,815
Speaker 1: This is a pun a popular Japanese firewall program.

197
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:37,009
Speaker 1: any GIES Sounds like their word for scallion negi.

198
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,413
Speaker 1: so the OS ton.

199
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:40,560
Speaker 1: carry scallions around as shields or weapons.

200
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:45,053
Speaker 1: Negi maki, I could really use some beef negi maki right now.

201
00:17:45,615 --> 00:17:47,140
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I could just eat those forever.

202
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:53,939
Speaker 2: All right, so I don't know if I've talked about this before but there's an I don't watch TV.

203
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,188
Speaker 2: We don't watch TV so much, but in Britain.

204
00:17:57,408 --> 00:18:00,396
Speaker 2: There's this awesome awesome awesome car TV.

205
00:18:00,436 --> 00:18:03,625
Speaker 2: Show call about cars Called top gear.

206
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:08,200
Speaker 1: I was real skeptical until I saw it and it was actually highly amusing.

207
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:25,800
Speaker 2: it's just this really good show with like these cool British guys, and they just do things about cars and There's the coolest part of the show is that they're not endorsed or Supportive of any particular auto brand or anything like that.

208
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,843
Speaker 2: They're just totally.

209
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:31,700
Speaker 2: they just love cars in general, and they'll just be straight honest with you about whatever.

210
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,183
Speaker 2: I remember.

211
00:18:33,223 --> 00:18:34,306
Speaker 2: I saw one show.

212
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:40,989
Speaker 2: the first time I saw this show was when this guy drove a v8 Audi Like like I think it was.

213
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,315
Speaker 2: it was other 400 miles or 800 miles.

214
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:50,800
Speaker 2: It was an obscenely long distance from like the bottom of England to Scotland and back on one tank of gas.

215
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:52,084
Speaker 2: It was like the.

216
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:57,040
Speaker 2: it was like beyond the limit of the rated fuel efficiency of the car.

217
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:59,411
Speaker 2: It was crazy, and they just.

218
00:18:59,652 --> 00:19:03,827
Speaker 2: the whole show was just a Camera in the car looking at this guy like.

219
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:06,195
Speaker 2: what is the car running on?

220
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:07,519
Speaker 2: oh my god?

221
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:09,321
Speaker 1: Love.

222
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:20,487
Speaker 1: I love the announcer and just the way they talk to each other and the way they talk in this show is actually really Hilarious yeah, so the one I linked to is the one I just found today which is the second time I've seen this show.

223
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:26,529
Speaker 2: the guy who he drives a Hunt an Acura NSX which is a car.

224
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:27,453
Speaker 2: They just stopped making.

225
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:36,040
Speaker 2: it's a really awesome car actually Around the Laguna Seca racetrack in California, but he does it in Gran Turismo.

226
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:38,472
Speaker 2: I think three the newest before the newest one.

227
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,767
Speaker 2: and He sees what time he gets and he learned.

228
00:19:41,787 --> 00:19:46,015
Speaker 2: he tries to learn the track where all the turns are when to brake when to Turn all that stuff.

229
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:54,631
Speaker 2: Then he goes to Laguna Seca with an Acura NSX and he drives it around trying to get the same time And pretty much right away.

230
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:54,954
Speaker 1: He's like.

231
00:19:54,974 --> 00:19:55,600
Speaker 1: Oh, holy crap.

232
00:19:57,081 --> 00:20:01,900
Speaker 2: He just starts cursing and he's just pissed off that it's not the same as the game.

233
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:05,359
Speaker 2: And you know he drives in the dirt, and he fishtails a bit.

234
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,940
Speaker 2: It's hilarious.

235
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:18,718
Speaker 2: So if you care about the cars or anything like that at all this is like the ultimate Car show ever and you should definitely check it out.

236
00:20:19,502 --> 00:20:23,280
Speaker 1: So we've noticed that a lot of people seem to have trouble with what we're about to talk about.

237
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:32,880
Speaker 1: So we decided we'd do a show with a guest to kind of define it and maybe shed some light on this issue for Maybe some people in our forums who might think otherwise.

238
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,968
Speaker 1: But tonight we're talking about pseudoscience.

239
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:45,279
Speaker 1: We have with us Peter Olson who is actually a scientist and a friend of ours and We're just gonna go in about pseudoscience and rant about it until we run out of time here.

240
00:20:46,464 --> 00:21:02,996
Speaker 0: all right, so for those of you that don't know me out there the Veritable legion of listeners who are unfamiliar with me I'm a microbiologist for the state of New York, and I won't go into the boring details of my job But I keep your food safe and make sure you don't die.

241
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:08,271
Speaker 1: yeah He tells us when it like every now And then he'll be like hey, you know such-and-such restaurant, or you know such-and-such food.

242
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:09,094
Speaker 1: Don't eat it.

243
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:09,636
Speaker 1: You'll die.

244
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:14,853
Speaker 0: yeah a warning I can give this in general if you eat bean sprouts wash the shit out of them.

245
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,719
Speaker 0: Just like wash them or cook them.

246
00:21:18,363 --> 00:21:19,679
Speaker 0: You'll be a lot better off that way.

247
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:23,739
Speaker 0: So Pseudoscience, so what is it?

248
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:37,820
Speaker 0: This is a. this is an important question, and it like a lot of terminology that relates to science it gets thrown around and abused and misused a lot and I think we've got a Wikipedia article that says what it is and defines it.

249
00:21:38,061 --> 00:21:46,467
Speaker 1: There are a lot of different definitions of pseudoscience and basically the way we want to use this word is simply Something that isn't science, but pretends to be

250
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:47,029
Speaker 0: yeah

251
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:51,460
Speaker 1: as in the willful deceit of people and using scientific sounding terminology

252
00:21:52,762 --> 00:21:57,335
Speaker 2: The real problem with this word is that the the roots of the word if you pick it apart.

253
00:21:57,395 --> 00:22:04,154
Speaker 2: It's pseudo which means Sort of or kind of and science which is well science right.

254
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:06,200
Speaker 2: so when you hear the word you're like pseudoscience.

255
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:08,850
Speaker 2: Oh, so that's almost science, but not quite no.

256
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,440
Speaker 2: pseudoscience actually means not science at all right.

257
00:22:11,641 --> 00:22:13,429
Speaker 0: That's what it means is kind of the way science works.

258
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:13,891
Speaker 0: It's such.

259
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:18,931
Speaker 0: It's such a simplified Yeah, you know bare-bones thought process that there's really.

260
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:20,316
Speaker 0: it's it's kind of like on/off.

261
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,580
Speaker 0: It's science, or it's not science.

262
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,980
Speaker 0: I mean you can't really kind of be middle-ground quasi science.

263
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:32,619
Speaker 1: I mean if you want a nice example I here's a list of commonly things that are commonly known to be pseudoscientific in their nature.

264
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,496
Speaker 1: Acupuncture not as in the the placebo effects of it, but the theory behind why it works.

265
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,660
Speaker 1: It's not really a theory.

266
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,471
Speaker 2: There is no key flow that is being unlocked by magic.

267
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:46,259
Speaker 1: me any effects of alchemy have nothing to do with the basis of alchemy.

268
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:58,995
Speaker 2: acupuncture alchemy astrology chakra theory chiropractic reflexology reflexology eugenics All of these things are just completely made out home.

269
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,882
Speaker 1: You would at the Some home.

270
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:03,112
Speaker 1: I mean homeopathy has some.

271
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:06,304
Speaker 1: actually there is real homeopathy Allergy shots.

272
00:23:06,364 --> 00:23:11,160
Speaker 0: yeah, the thing is homeopathy means well your your body's natural immune system is homeopathy.

273
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,351
Speaker 2: Well, there's two things that they that.

274
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:14,498
Speaker 2: no that's not true that.

275
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:23,804
Speaker 2: well Two things homeopathy is a theory of medicine where you have number one very high Dilutions of active ingredients.

276
00:23:24,366 --> 00:23:27,714
Speaker 2: and two you're assuming that like cures like.

277
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:32,912
Speaker 1: so for example you take a Poison that causes a headache, and it'll make your headache go away.

278
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:33,394
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

279
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,980
Speaker 1: That's what homeopathy really says.

280
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,086
Speaker 2: That's the as the theory of homeopathy is.

281
00:23:37,106 --> 00:23:42,845
Speaker 2: let's say you were poisoned by cyanide that some cyanide will cure you But you just dilute it.

282
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,920
Speaker 2: you you would take the site like one part cyanide and ten thousand parts of water.

283
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:49,209
Speaker 0: It sounds like a bastardization of the way they do.

284
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:54,079
Speaker 0: and you know a vaccine or something like that Which is based on your body's immune principles?

285
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,240
Speaker 1: Yep, it works.

286
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:59,092
Speaker 1: It is while some homeopathic things have been found to work in the past.

287
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:07,560
Speaker 1: it has nothing to do with the idea of homeopathy Because the the ideas and suppositions behind homeopathy as to why it works are mostly just bullshit.

288
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:14,380
Speaker 2: Yeah, see sometimes like can cure like which that's not even really scientific terminology whatsoever.

289
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:33,080
Speaker 2: Because you know look allergy shots I'm allergic to mold so you take a very small amount of the mold so it won't really give me an allergic Reaction and we dilute it heavily and we put it in me and because of the theories of immunology I now don't get the allergy so much not because of homeopathy.

290
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,789
Speaker 0: It works best with with the viral shots things like that.

291
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:42,257
Speaker 0: you take the actual virus itself you destroy it and you inject yourself with this.

292
00:24:43,001 --> 00:25:02,327
Speaker 0: basically, it's kind of like cooked a virus for lack of better terminology without explaining it and the way your body's immune system works is recognizes these broken down pieces of virus and it develops immunity to them, but it doesn't work for stuff like Cyanide or you know Anything else that you know?

293
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:05,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't immunize yourself to gamma radiation.

294
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:19,840
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you have the flu taking some drinking some water and a sugar pill that is like one part You know duck liver and ten thousand parts water and other stuff that doesn't do anything is not going to cure the flu.

295
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,260
Speaker 2: There's just no chance.

296
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:37,940
Speaker 1: Statistically and if you look at chemistry and physics homeopathy as it is practiced today can't work because Statistically not even a single atom or molecule of the thing They say they're diluted will actually appear in a diluted homeopathic solution.

297
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,562
Speaker 2: So let's so.

298
00:25:38,623 --> 00:25:44,125
Speaker 2: if it's cat liver, which I know one of the very popular ones is after they dilute it They dilute it so much.

299
00:25:44,186 --> 00:25:46,880
Speaker 2: There is zero cat liver in the medicine that you actually.

300
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:52,320
Speaker 2: Then you're also assuming the cat liver cures the flu, which it does not.

301
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,054
Speaker 2: Yeah, it doesn't do anything.

302
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,485
Speaker 2: It's just made up Just like cruelty.

303
00:25:58,545 --> 00:26:01,435
Speaker 2: you could eat a raw cat liver and you would still have the flu.

304
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:06,127
Speaker 2: and not only that you'd probably be vomiting more Nasty raw cat liver.

305
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:07,232
Speaker 0: No, not so good.

306
00:26:07,795 --> 00:26:08,900
Speaker 0: So basically delicious.

307
00:26:09,544 --> 00:26:17,363
Speaker 1: We got on a rant about some specific pseudosciences out there But basically the the whole gist of this is just gonna be simply that a lot of things out there pretend to be science.

308
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:19,630
Speaker 1: or they say oh, we're backed by scientific research.

309
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:26,840
Speaker 1: or oh the so-and-so professors say this is good and People like us are really good at just spotting like oh, that's pseudoscience.

310
00:26:27,382 --> 00:26:28,106
Speaker 1: I know that guy.

311
00:26:28,166 --> 00:26:30,378
Speaker 1: he promotes all sorts of bullshit and this is probably more of it.

312
00:26:30,438 --> 00:26:31,903
Speaker 1: and oh look He has no data behind it.

313
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:38,002
Speaker 1: or yeah that guy he always makes claims like this, but he never actually publishes an article Mm-hmm.

314
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:38,724
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

315
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:43,919
Speaker 2: Let's talk about how other people who don't know how to detect pseudoscience so easily can detect it.

316
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:48,520
Speaker 1: Yep Well Wikipedia has a list of the so-called characteristics of most pseudoscience.

317
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,946
Speaker 1: Pseudoscience asserts claims or theories Unconnected to previous experimental results.

318
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:55,128
Speaker 1: Yep.

319
00:26:55,149 --> 00:27:12,740
Speaker 2: So if you know that it's commonly believed by scientists that say gravity exists or you know a Sediment if in works in such a way and Someone comes along with some other science that says everything that science already knows is wrong, right?

320
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,527
Speaker 2: They're probably making shit up.

321
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:23,420
Speaker 0: Yep, if there's no data to back up what you're saying The fundamental principle of science you make a claim you get evidence.

322
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:33,390
Speaker 0: you know you bring evidence to bear to support your claim and if you don't have the evidence at fuck you By asserting claims which cannot be verified or falsified.

323
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,237
Speaker 1: This is a big problem with intelligent design.

324
00:27:37,257 --> 00:27:37,880
Speaker 2: There's a lot of things.

325
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:40,236
Speaker 2: This is one that people have a real hard time understanding.

326
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:49,260
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It doesn't necessarily mean that any claim that genuine legitimate science makes is false or is erroneous in some fashion.

327
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:59,999
Speaker 0: What it means is that the claims and assertions you make the conclusions you draw There has to be a way to prove it to to generate a test that could falsify it.

328
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,199
Speaker 0: There has to be some kind of testability to it.

329
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:11,192
Speaker 0: If you're making a blanket statement with no holes in it No gaps nothing like that if there's literally just no way to that you could prove it wrong.

330
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:18,530
Speaker 0: if you make an assertion that there's a God up there that you can't interact with and you can't you know Take a gram of it and try to prove what it really is.

331
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:19,695
Speaker 0: That's not science.

332
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:20,820
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

333
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:26,040
Speaker 2: So if I come along and I say what did I say in the forums that I'm the evil Hitler God?

334
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,363
Speaker 2: There's something like that.

335
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:28,849
Speaker 2: There's no way you can prove.

336
00:28:28,949 --> 00:28:30,455
Speaker 2: I'm not the evil Hitler God.

337
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:31,559
Speaker 2: There is no way to do that.

338
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,482
Speaker 2: Therefore that claim and or any validation of it is not scientific in any way whatsoever Don't any?

339
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:43,336
Speaker 1: there's another right after that asserting claims which contradict experimentally established results.

340
00:28:43,837 --> 00:28:44,700
Speaker 1: That's one step further.

341
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,446
Speaker 1: That's not even something that can't be falsified.

342
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:49,517
Speaker 1: That's something that has been falsified and you're just making something up.

343
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:54,120
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, you'd see a lot of people do this, especially audio files.

344
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:57,506
Speaker 1: I don't know if I've ran it about them much But these are people.

345
00:28:57,546 --> 00:28:59,918
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about people who like music or like audio.

346
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,438
Speaker 1: well You know what the word should mean.

347
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:10,092
Speaker 1: These are people who will spend thirty to forty thousand dollars on a special magic power cable that they claim makes their CDs sound better Cleans the electricity.

348
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:22,739
Speaker 1: Yeah Because the electricity is dirty because it's you know, just freaking a less visit they get messed up that Yeah, even the best are the monster cables that are digital and they cost like a hundred dollars more than up by the.

349
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,217
Speaker 1: you know The cheapo digital cable and a lot of you don't seem to realize that digital is digital.

350
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:28,583
Speaker 1: if the data gets there It's perfect.

351
00:29:28,624 --> 00:29:30,115
Speaker 1: No matter what if it doesn't get there.

352
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:30,760
Speaker 1: It doesn't get there.

353
00:29:31,843 --> 00:29:32,610
Speaker 2: So digital works.

354
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:33,580
Speaker 2: It's a zero and a one.

355
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,095
Speaker 2: The only way to be messed up is if some of the zeros and ones go missing.

356
00:29:37,156 --> 00:29:39,478
Speaker 2: and if some of them go missing It just doesn't work at all.

357
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:43,436
Speaker 1: so the audio files will claim that oh this cable makes my power better.

358
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:47,449
Speaker 1: but then Scientists study the cable and see that it's identical to every other cable.

359
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,996
Speaker 1: and then the claim contradicts the established results.

360
00:29:50,457 --> 00:29:56,239
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm by failing to provide an experimental possibility of reproducible results.

361
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,391
Speaker 0: Reproducibility is the biggest key to scientific experiments.

362
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:10,689
Speaker 0: if you do it once and you can never reproduce it Your claim is mostly invalid aka the person who brought up the famous Semifamous leaf experiment in the forums.

363
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,231
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

364
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:36,537
Speaker 1: This was an experiment done and I think it was 1940 by I talked about at the forums I don't remember all the details anymore but it was this crazy Russian electrician dude and He claimed to have found the aura of a leaf and that if he cut off a piece of the leaf and then did this technique again, the aura was still there showing that the leaf had memory of itself and No one in the last, you know since 1940 has ever ever ever reproduced this.

365
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:45,337
Speaker 1: so Science says alright his claim was bullshit or there was some sort of error in his original experiment some kind of fluke instrumental error.

366
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,872
Speaker 0: You know that sort of thing tech error.

367
00:30:48,053 --> 00:30:56,280
Speaker 1: Yes in this specific case I believe it was discovered that in fact He had simply not wiped off his photographic plate before cutting off a piece of the leaf.

368
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,993
Speaker 1: So the moisture from the leaf was still there when he ran the test a second time.

369
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,643
Speaker 1: and oh the aura is still whole Science.

370
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:16,192
Speaker 0: whoo, of course, there's also the possibility, you know, he may have done that accidentally Or he may have done that intentionally to reproduce these results with the specific knowledge that this is what he would find Yep, that that sort of falsification of data.

371
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:19,724
Speaker 0: That is that is about the biggest Taboo in all of science.

372
00:31:19,764 --> 00:31:32,988
Speaker 0: It's like the worst crime you can commit as a scientist is to make stuff up And as you know in college trying to pass classes We won't talk about that Moving on.

373
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,240
Speaker 1: well, that was a big issue.

374
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:43,799
Speaker 1: I know you're all familiar with the Korean scientist who claimed to have cloned someone and Then no one could reproduce his results and then it turned out that he just made the whole thing up.

375
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:54,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I don't I don't know if it went that far yet but there were enough claims that he falsified data and such that he had his own paper retracted, which is Usually a bad thing to do.

376
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:55,851
Speaker 0: You don't want to do that.

377
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:56,554
Speaker 0: You don't want to.

378
00:31:56,574 --> 00:31:59,852
Speaker 0: you don't want to say like oh, yeah I don't have confidence in my research.

379
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:00,900
Speaker 0: I'm gonna retract my paper.

380
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:10,982
Speaker 2: So what it comes down to is if someone says they can do something or that something does something They make a claim and then they can't do it again, or you know, they can't do it all the time They can only do it.

381
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,949
Speaker 2: Sometimes they're just lying.

382
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,746
Speaker 2: if something works if something is scientifically, you know It's not pseudoscience and is real science.

383
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:22,163
Speaker 2: You can do it all the time over and over again in any lab at any place Any time.

384
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:33,020
Speaker 0: yep, you should be able to argue that if you can't reproduce it under the same conditions Just made up something's wrong or a lot of pseudo scientists will get around this by conducting an experiment.

385
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:37,252
Speaker 1: You couldn't see me but I made a little quote marks around the word experiment here.

386
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:40,383
Speaker 1: that cannot be reproduced like oh I did this.

387
00:32:40,403 --> 00:32:44,778
Speaker 1: I'm during the planetary alignment of blah and blah that won't happen for another thousand years.

388
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,089
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, that is it's.

389
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,480
Speaker 0: it's certainly interesting but it is not scientific.

390
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,400
Speaker 2: No, nor is it true.

391
00:32:53,913 --> 00:33:05,240
Speaker 1: Yeah Now here's the big one not so much for pseudoscience itself But for you being able to spot it if you're not good at doing so By failing to submit results to peer review prior to publicizing them.

392
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:14,099
Speaker 1: Oh, yes If a scientist comes up with something real or new or important They're going to submit it to scientific journals and then the media are going to pick up on it.

393
00:33:14,822 --> 00:33:21,938
Speaker 1: If anyone claims to have invented something or discovered something and they go to the press before they go to other scientists Something's wrong.

394
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:25,148
Speaker 0: Your review is a very important process in science.

395
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:39,697
Speaker 0: It's when your research gets passed around to basically a committee made up of respected scientists and they take a look at your paper they take a look at your research and They basically make sure that that the research you've done and the conclusions you've reached and all this stuff that it's.

396
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:42,846
Speaker 0: it's kosher Basically that it falls in the realm of science.

397
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,255
Speaker 0: and I got to say scientists are assholes.

398
00:33:46,516 --> 00:33:47,960
Speaker 0: We're just we're bastards.

399
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,049
Speaker 0: We will rip your paper apart if you've done something that's even like Slightly maybe not the best science.

400
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:56,340
Speaker 0: you will hear about it and you will hear about it a lot.

401
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's a reason for that and that's because there's a lot of this pseudoscience out there.

402
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:13,473
Speaker 0: a lot of people will will use shoddy methods or maybe flub some numbers fudge a little data and You know, maybe that you use that you get an unfair advantage you get a grant that someone else should have gotten.

403
00:34:13,695 --> 00:34:19,739
Speaker 0: or maybe you're in the Pharmaceutical industry and you fudge some data and you accidentally kill, I don't know a hundred thousand people.

404
00:34:20,623 --> 00:34:24,040
Speaker 0: Something like that, you know, it's a very very critical thing.

405
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,799
Speaker 0: And if someone doesn't want to submit to peer review, they'll have a million reasons for it.

406
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:33,656
Speaker 0: They'll say like the committee does committees against them or scientists are closed-minded.

407
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:38,754
Speaker 0: I hear that one a lot But really it's been around it's been this way for a while and you know, it's.

408
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,560
Speaker 0: there's a reason it's established like this.

409
00:34:41,263 --> 00:34:47,588
Speaker 2: So there's only one scientist who says yeah, this is the real deal Check to make sure the person's even a scientist.

410
00:34:47,688 --> 00:35:00,500
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because that's mad scientist syndrome there in the movies You always see like the crazy Maverick scientist who comes up with something in his basement and the you know Established scientific community ignores him and it turns out he was right and then he stops the aliens.

411
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,559
Speaker 2: It never is that way in the real world.

412
00:35:03,422 --> 00:35:09,058
Speaker 1: The one mad scientist come in with something in his basement is basically the crazy dude walking out on the street going.

413
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:10,164
Speaker 1: everyone's crazy But me.

414
00:35:10,204 --> 00:35:11,579
Speaker 1: yep, everyone's crazy, but me.

415
00:35:12,622 --> 00:35:19,697
Speaker 0: The big thing is if you see a paper released by someone and there's like one author on the paper You might want to question that a little bit.

416
00:35:19,938 --> 00:35:28,582
Speaker 0: most Scientific research of any significant nature is done in a team and it's done in a team that goes well beyond whose name gets on The paper.

417
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:32,860
Speaker 0: that doesn't even account for the people that did the bulk of the work or anything like that.

418
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,775
Speaker 1: So yeah research assistants getting paid crap.

419
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:36,278
Speaker 0: Shut up.

420
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:39,224
Speaker 0: We do all the work.

421
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:41,089
Speaker 0: the director takes all the credit.

422
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,540
Speaker 0: Watson and Crick steal their woman's research, you know?

423
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,632
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of science is full of assholishness like that, but that's how it happens.

424
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:50,254
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

425
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:56,090
Speaker 0: I guess you know I've always I've always been confused by the pseudoscience thing.

426
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,333
Speaker 0: Like how does it?

427
00:35:58,095 --> 00:35:59,880
Speaker 0: how is it so pervasive still?

428
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,534
Speaker 2: Well, the number one thing about pseudoscience that I've seen and notice is it all.

429
00:36:04,594 --> 00:36:06,220
Speaker 2: it's always something too good to be true.

430
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,915
Speaker 2: It's something people want to believe and it's false.

431
00:36:09,357 --> 00:36:12,079
Speaker 2: So People will want to believe it so bad.

432
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:17,703
Speaker 2: They'll believe it despite any amount of contradictory evidence and this is actually a really good way to detect pseudoscience.

433
00:36:17,763 --> 00:36:26,239
Speaker 2: if something seems really great like, you know Hey, we have this pill that cures cancer perfectly every time or perpetual emotion machine.

434
00:36:26,802 --> 00:36:28,651
Speaker 2: Yeah, you never had to use gasoline again.

435
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,420
Speaker 2: The world is saved anything like that.

436
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,038
Speaker 2: The truth is the universe is much terrible and much more of a bastard than any.

437
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:46,190
Speaker 2: so If someone ever socks, so someone ever says anything and it just seems too good to be true It's ninety nine point nine nine nine nine percent of the time.

438
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:47,515
Speaker 2: It's just completely made up.

439
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:53,704
Speaker 2: because if it was real Imagine like think about if a psychic could actually for real It wasn't just pretend.

440
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:59,446
Speaker 1: if psychics could actually talk to the dead like you realize they'd be in every courtroom ever and there'd never be An unsolved murder ever again.

441
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:02,700
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would just talk to every freaking corpse and they would go up.

442
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,949
Speaker 2: We know exactly what happened.

443
00:37:04,151 --> 00:37:05,340
Speaker 1: no one would have wills anymore.

444
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:09,199
Speaker 1: You just have a psychic ask you after you were dead where you wanted all your crap to go.

445
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,047
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would be world changing.

446
00:37:11,108 --> 00:37:13,960
Speaker 2: the entire world would just flip over in a second.

447
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:19,140
Speaker 2: We would freaking go talk to George Washington and find out stuff and we'd go talk to JFK and ask who shot him.

448
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:29,529
Speaker 1: And yeah if John Roberts and a Sylvia Brown and all those assholes who talks claim to talk to the dead could actually talk to the dead we Yeah, there just wouldn't be questions anymore.

449
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,697
Speaker 0: We just we just know shit from the past.

450
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:35,188
Speaker 0: We don't definitely Yeah, we wouldn't have to worry about the things.

451
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:35,930
Speaker 0: Hey Alexander.

452
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,014
Speaker 2: What happened to your library?

453
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:38,700
Speaker 1: Oh, I got burned out.

454
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,879
Speaker 2: Hey Caligula, why were you so nuts?

455
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:44,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should do another whole other show on Abraham Lincoln and how.

456
00:37:44,893 --> 00:37:47,439
Speaker 1: not only was he a pretty terrible president But he was kind of an asshole.

457
00:37:47,773 --> 00:37:54,316
Speaker 2: Yeah a little bit a little bit did some good did some bad and Really people don't pay attention to the bad so much and some of the good you think he did.

458
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,369
Speaker 1: He didn't really do Yeah, I mean he suspended habeas corpus.

459
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,191
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:37:59,331 --> 00:37:59,512
Speaker 0: Yeah.

461
00:37:59,592 --> 00:38:02,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course who recently suspended habeas corpus?

462
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:04,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

463
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,360
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we won't rant about politics.

464
00:38:06,601 --> 00:38:18,673
Speaker 1: well, even though politics are really play into the pseudoscience thing because not to rag on our fearless leader President Bush, but He's very much for the teaching of intelligent design American schools.

465
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:19,717
Speaker 1: He said as much.

466
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:20,379
Speaker 2: well too late.

467
00:38:20,681 --> 00:38:23,200
Speaker 0: That pisses me off more than any other pseudoscience.

468
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,480
Speaker 0: Well, maybe not any other pseudoscience, but probably in the top three pseudosciences that piss me off the most.

469
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ones that really bother me are the ones that are actually dangerous and harmful directly.

470
00:38:33,222 --> 00:38:35,912
Speaker 1: I mean, there are crazy crazy people out there and I'm not kidding.

471
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:38,000
Speaker 1: They really believe in perpetual motion machines.

472
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,279
Speaker 1: They called they're called free energy.

473
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:47,732
Speaker 1: And if you google for free energy, you'll find a million of these people who claim they're just you know Another year of research away from perpetual motion.

474
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:53,740
Speaker 1: and they really believe it Yeah, and they're just kind of nutty but they're not hurting anyone except the other idiot to give them money.

475
00:38:54,543 --> 00:39:00,971
Speaker 0: The real problem is the people that that use pseudoscience and they're in any kind of position that can influence a large number of people.

476
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:03,565
Speaker 0: intelligent design is Notorious for that.

477
00:39:04,067 --> 00:39:07,880
Speaker 2: That's even intelligent design really can't hurt so many people it might.

478
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,866
Speaker 1: Well, I think it can.

479
00:39:10,187 --> 00:39:10,910
Speaker 0: it definitely can.

480
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,747
Speaker 2: it can't hurt people as bad as say chiropractic, which is just oh We're just gonna kill.

481
00:39:14,827 --> 00:39:15,070
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

482
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,914
Speaker 0: Well, it's Intelligent design is just creationism in disguise.

483
00:39:18,994 --> 00:39:30,624
Speaker 0: and if you get a bunch of people Institutionalized believing in this one specific creation myth then it's not far to go to Institutionalized religion and then you get a whole Load of crap from there.

484
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,513
Speaker 0: physical harm is dangerous upon people not like.

485
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:36,080
Speaker 0: physical harm is not the worst thing you can do.

486
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,184
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but it's not like.

487
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:41,418
Speaker 2: it's not nearly as bad as the people who said yes cyanide cures cancer.

488
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:42,100
Speaker 0: No, no, okay.

489
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,148
Speaker 0: Okay, I grant you that.

490
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:43,733
Speaker 1: I don't see.

491
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:44,660
Speaker 1: you all know people.

492
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,060
Speaker 1: There are people who really did say cyanide causes can't or cures cancer and they're still saying it.

493
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,890
Speaker 0: I will contend that in fact cyanide does cure cancer.

494
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,780
Speaker 0: It also cures that nasty problem of living that everyone seems to have.

495
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:03,696
Speaker 2: And actually the the specific thing is they had this Pill or vitamin was called lorat adene.

496
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:08,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, Loretta No, lorat adene is an anti decongestant or an anti allergy pill that I take.

497
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:13,335
Speaker 1: Oh, it's called Lara trial or large Vitamin b12.

498
00:40:13,437 --> 00:40:17,962
Speaker 1: I know Yeah, b16 Whatever.

499
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:20,009
Speaker 2: No, you'll see you'll know when you see it.

500
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:21,032
Speaker 0: It's not a beaver.

501
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:21,433
Speaker 0: Yeah.

502
00:40:21,554 --> 00:40:29,928
Speaker 2: No, it's not a vitamin at all But that's what they call it Happens is is you eat this thing and it's not really harmful to you except once it gets into your liver.

503
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:34,885
Speaker 2: your liver picks it apart with some enzymes and After the enzymes pick it apart.

504
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:39,740
Speaker 2: One of the leftover bits is cyanide which will kill you nearly immediately.

505
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,048
Speaker 1: Well, basically what it's all it is.

506
00:40:42,088 --> 00:40:43,192
Speaker 1: is there these people?

507
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:47,170
Speaker 1: and we have a we are friending our friend Scott Johnson Who is also a scientist?

508
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:48,779
Speaker 1: He has a bunch of friends who?

509
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,629
Speaker 1: They have some issues with pseudoscience.

510
00:40:51,669 --> 00:40:53,859
Speaker 1: I guess they're a good example of people who fall for this stuff.

511
00:40:54,321 --> 00:41:02,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean no offense to them, but they went on this whole rant in this email discussion We had about how this Lara trial cures cancer.

512
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:08,540
Speaker 1: It's a giant conspiracy to keep it away from everyone and their argument had every hallmark of a pseudoscientific claim.

513
00:41:08,863 --> 00:41:13,148
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm going to post it in the forums After the show so you all can peruse it.

514
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:13,971
Speaker 1: Basically.

515
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:16,780
Speaker 1: This is a step-by-step example of what to watch for in pseudoscience

516
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:17,821
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

517
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:28,021
Speaker 1: and the funny thing was despite the fact that I presented them with actual evidence to the contrary They ignored it and claimed that either the evidence was made up or the scientists are just part of the conspiracy to keep it Down.

518
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:37,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hear that conspiracy thing a lot from this pseudoscience stuff And yeah, I think it comes from a misrepresentation of what science and the scientific community is per se.

519
00:41:38,238 --> 00:41:40,002
Speaker 0: there's no Conspiracy.

520
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:41,248
Speaker 0: the government's not even.

521
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,915
Speaker 0: really I'm a government employee.

522
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:43,880
Speaker 0: Okay, I work for the state.

523
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:49,000
Speaker 0: Let me tell you we're not competent enough to initiate some kind of global conspiracy like that.

524
00:41:49,101 --> 00:41:57,864
Speaker 0: It You wouldn't even believe it and most scientists are far too busy doing their own stuff to even consider that sort of thing Really?

525
00:41:57,884 --> 00:42:01,000
Speaker 0: I mean that's probably how a lot of these problems got past us in the first place.

526
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,230
Speaker 0: Like I didn't even realize how widespread pseudoscience is.

527
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:07,520
Speaker 0: but the reason is we've debunked it so many times.

528
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,833
Speaker 0: We're like people just have to know by now, right?

529
00:42:09,873 --> 00:42:11,100
Speaker 0: We've already debunked it.

530
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,197
Speaker 1: We're already past this but they don't they just forget keep coming back to it Like the guy in the forums who brought up the aura thing that the aura.

531
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:36,280
Speaker 1: they call it a Curiology, I forget exactly what they call it now where they claim to photograph auras and it became a really big fad in the 70s as in the 1970s and all over the world people were really getting into it and it was debunked thoroughly and Completely back then and it stopped being an issue and no one talked about it anymore.

532
00:42:37,043 --> 00:42:38,849
Speaker 1: And now for some reason it's coming up again.

533
00:42:38,869 --> 00:42:46,539
Speaker 1: Yep, and there aren't that many good debunking is online Just because no one who cares even considered the fact that people would ever believe in this stuff again.

534
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:52,297
Speaker 2: It's mostly because back in the day when you wanted to spread information about something.

535
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:53,200
Speaker 2: It wasn't so easy.

536
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,420
Speaker 2: Now the internet makes it real easy.

537
00:42:55,461 --> 00:43:03,245
Speaker 2: Of course It makes it real easy to spread lies too and people are gullible as all fuck and they'll believe just about anything Means.

538
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:08,910
Speaker 0: today you have to be even more More critical of what you read, especially on the internet.

539
00:43:09,351 --> 00:43:11,457
Speaker 0: any research you see be very critical.

540
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:12,440
Speaker 0: Check the sources.

541
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:23,239
Speaker 1: I see that a lot of scientific institutions either turn a blind eye or just ignore Pseudoscience saying that it's not even worth our ability our effort to debate and debunk because it's obvious to us

542
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:23,902
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

543
00:43:24,284 --> 00:43:32,012
Speaker 1: and I'm starting to think more and more that while it may be a waste of resources I think scientists need to vigorously defeat the pseudoscience at every turn.

544
00:43:32,434 --> 00:43:34,700
Speaker 0: Well, there are a couple of issues with that.

545
00:43:35,642 --> 00:43:38,351
Speaker 0: At some point in debunking some amount of pseudoscience.

546
00:43:38,511 --> 00:43:43,185
Speaker 0: I've grew up in a very Christian area and I can.

547
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:45,420
Speaker 0: I can talk about the creationism thing, especially a lot.

548
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,988
Speaker 0: No at some point you run into a wall you.

549
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:54,217
Speaker 0: there is a point at which all the logic and reason in the world will Not debunk somebody strongly held belief.

550
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:55,905
Speaker 1: damn it You know that that is.

551
00:43:56,066 --> 00:44:07,600
Speaker 0: that is the problem with this pseudoscience because a lot of it is You know preying on things that people desperately want to believe, you know You really want to know like, you know, you if you're you want to talk to your dead father.

552
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:10,319
Speaker 0: You're and you're in a really tough spot about it.

553
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:18,397
Speaker 0: You're gonna be really really really inclined to want to believe the guy that says yeah I can contact your dead relatives and it's dangerous stuff.

554
00:44:18,758 --> 00:44:24,920
Speaker 1: Yeah Penn and teller do a show called bullshit and it's on Showtime and it's a really good show.

555
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,066
Speaker 1: It's a lot like Mythbusters.

556
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:27,936
Speaker 1: So if you're fan of Mythbusters, you'll love bull.

557
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:38,165
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah but they do an episode where they take on all those psychics who claim to talk to the dead and I guess you should you guys should all watch it because it's not even a joke It's not even funny what they do to these people.

558
00:44:38,366 --> 00:44:42,276
Speaker 1: It's not not Penn and teller but psychologists and the the psychics.

559
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:43,802
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah it's.

560
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:55,609
Speaker 0: it's definitely like it's well, and that's I guess the best thing you can do to defend yourself against pseudoscience is to Educate yourself about what science is exactly and this.

561
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,573
Speaker 0: this can be a little tricky because there's a lot of you know In a dynamic field.

562
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:04,620
Speaker 0: It's very Changing Can be a little tricky sometimes.

563
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:09,053
Speaker 0: The best thing to know is I can explain it a little bit science is just.

564
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:15,253
Speaker 0: it's a very broken down Very very very methodical process of thought.

565
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:19,525
Speaker 0: It's not even a body of knowledge so much as it is Just a way of doing things.

566
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:20,689
Speaker 0: It's a way of thinking.

567
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:22,453
Speaker 0: It's a branch of philosophy.

568
00:45:22,473 --> 00:45:26,066
Speaker 0: That's specific and it has a practical bend to it.

569
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:46,622
Speaker 0: and Really what you got to look at is is things that are making no good science will ever make just a broad Extraordinary claim or anything that it it that can't be supported by evidence that sort of thing if you're seeing just broad Extraordinary out there claims like alien life forms and things like that Science.

570
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:58,702
Speaker 0: good good scientists won't dismiss the possibility that it might exist But they won't go ahead and make extraordinary claims that this thin flimsy evidence points to this extraordinary thing.

571
00:45:59,243 --> 00:46:07,240
Speaker 0: most science has done in a very very most conclusions that are drawn are very conservative and It's very very methodical and slow and stepwise.

572
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:10,287
Speaker 2: That's why you don't see new science every day.

573
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:13,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it takes years and years for breakthroughs to come out.

574
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,516
Speaker 0: That's what when they're when someone says like this is a new scientific breakthrough.

575
00:46:17,536 --> 00:46:18,360
Speaker 0: It's not a breakthrough.

576
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:25,680
Speaker 0: There are about like 10 years of research behind that and like people got PhDs about it There have been more papers than you can even imagine.

577
00:46:26,324 --> 00:46:29,020
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that you haven't seen.

578
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,238
Speaker 2: Yeah, so someone put together a gizmo in his garage in like five minutes, then it's probably not real.

579
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,060
Speaker 0: Nope I mean, what's that quote by Edison and trying to invent the light bulb?

580
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:44,600
Speaker 0: No failed a thousand times and he said I've just found a thousand ways that won't work.

581
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:45,848
Speaker 0: That's that's about.

582
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,419
Speaker 0: that's about how science goes.

583
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:58,928
Speaker 0: It's about 95 99 percent of what you do just doesn't work and you know it doesn't give you the result you expected and you just keep trying and you keep repeating and it takes a long time costs a lot of money.

584
00:46:59,538 --> 00:47:08,859
Speaker 0: and Eventually at one point, you know You finally have done this research and you can draw these conclusions and then you can publish your your breakthrough amazing paper.

585
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:19,336
Speaker 0: But it's never done overnight and it's not gonna be some Some wonderful revolutionary thing just like from this one experiment you did.

586
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:20,640
Speaker 0: just doesn't happen.
