1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,602
Speaker 0: Oh fuck, we're back.

2
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:02,550
Speaker 0: Finally.

3
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:04,790
Speaker 1: Oh, you started the show when I was looking out the window.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,169
Speaker 0: I guess we should do the opening, actually.

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,056
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, April 23rd, 2014.

6
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:18,478
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

7
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:22,290
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,916
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

9
00:00:23,997 --> 00:00:26,970
Speaker 0: Tonight, Kill la Kill, final thoughts.

10
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,408
Speaker 1: I guess we still do this show.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,269
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

12
00:00:35,541 --> 00:00:43,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was in Paris, then we were at PAX, then all the stuff that happens after a PAX, like recovering and laundry and...

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,480
Speaker 1: The sun coming out.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,000
Speaker 0: Yep, it'd be a nice outside, biking everywhere.

15
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,240
Speaker 1: I took a day off work yesterday, went to the park, and burned my head.

16
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:55,139
Speaker 0: I should have taken a day off just to bike around or something, but I didn't.

17
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:55,796
Speaker 0: Mistake.

18
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:56,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

19
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,469
Speaker 1: Why live?

20
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,179
Speaker 1: Why work?

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,810
Speaker 0: Got one more weekend at a convention.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,220
Speaker 0: we'll talk about later, then we're pretty free.

23
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:04,157
Speaker 1: Yay.

24
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,752
Speaker 0: So this morning, something happened to me.

25
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:13,139
Speaker 0: that's only happened to me twice in my life, and I always forget that this is a thing that can happen until it does happen.

26
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,800
Speaker 0: So around 5 AM, I hear the fire alarm go off.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,420
Speaker 1: You weren't sleeping?

28
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:20,739
Speaker 0: Well, I'm woken up by it.

29
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:28,559
Speaker 0: I guess I heard it in my dream, and then it didn't make sense, and then I woke up and I hear it, but then it stops.

30
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,140
Speaker 0: And then I hear a voice, a robot voice, yell something.

31
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:32,640
Speaker 1: What?

32
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:36,960
Speaker 1: Does your fire alarm, your fire smoke alarm, your smoke detector has a robot voice?

33
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

34
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:40,080
Speaker 0: It's connected to other fire systems.

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,260
Speaker 0: The whole building's integrated.

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,920
Speaker 0: So it looks like a regular fire alarm up there in a hallway, but actually it's got a wire, and it connects to all the other smoke detectors in our apartment.

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,998
Speaker 0: So if one goes off, they all go off.

38
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:52,119
Speaker 0: Standard deal.

39
00:01:54,224 --> 00:02:00,014
Speaker 0: So I just kind of lay there for a minute, and then it goes off again, and then I hear the voice, and it says, "Battery

40
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:00,476
Speaker 0: low!".

41
00:02:01,514 --> 00:02:01,577
Speaker 1: Eh.

42
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,320
Speaker 1: Wait, isn't it powered by the building?

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,859
Speaker 0: No, well, so.

44
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:10,460
Speaker 1: And then the battery is just a backup because that way it works during a power outage?

45
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:18,000
Speaker 0: Yes, but the batteries still get drained a little bit and eventually wear out, and about once every year-ish, you're supposed to replace the 9-volt battery.

46
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,460
Speaker 1: Of course.

47
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,580
Speaker 1: Everyone, check your smoke detectors so you don't die in a horrible fire.

48
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:33,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, smoke detectors usually, though I'm really shocked at how many people don't seem to know this, when I was a kid, I'd go over to people's houses, because normally when the battery's low on a regular old smoke detector, it'll chirp.

49
00:02:34,005 --> 00:02:34,256
Speaker 0: Like, boop!

50
00:02:34,841 --> 00:02:37,820
Speaker 0: Every few minutes until you change the battery.

51
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,298
Speaker 1: But you can push the button to shut it up.

52
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,359
Speaker 0: No, usually not.

53
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,859
Speaker 0: Usually it'll start up again at some point.

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,131
Speaker 0: Okay.

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,837
Speaker 0: So I remember as a kid, a lot of people had smoke detectors that basically chirped forever because they didn't notice it.

56
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:51,020
Speaker 1: Uh, much like your Fios battery.

57
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, much like the Fios batteries in a lot of our neighbors' apartments.

58
00:02:54,965 --> 00:02:55,138
Speaker 1: Yep.

59
00:02:55,703 --> 00:03:01,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a feeling I'll be hearing the alarms of all my neighbors' Fios batteries being dead until I move.

60
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:09,098
Speaker 0: So this thing still needs the backup battery to be replaced about once every year, even though it's powered by the AC.

61
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,900
Speaker 0: And there's no way to suppress this fucking alarm.

62
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:15,439
Speaker 1: A new battery.

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't happen to have a 9-volt battery laying around.

64
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,120
Speaker 1: But if your smoke detector, like, actually died, and it was a fire at, like, 5.30 and you didn't replace it.

65
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,840
Speaker 0: Well, if it died, died, one, it still would have had power to wake me up.

66
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,359
Speaker 0: I mean, the "Hey, the battery's dying" alarm would wake me up.

67
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,740
Speaker 0: So that would have worked fine.

68
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:34,520
Speaker 0: There's no way to suppress this alarm.

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,378
Speaker 1: Doesn't know what time it is.

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,477
Speaker 0: And it doesn't go, yeah, doesn't know what time it is.

71
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:39,840
Speaker 0: Thinks it's a perfectly fine time to do this.

72
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,380
Speaker 1: Listen, if you want to make a lot of money, right?

73
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,300
Speaker 1: There's that company, Nest.

74
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:45,160
Speaker 1: So make the Nest of smoke detectors.

75
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,920
Speaker 0: Nest makes smoke detectors, Scott.

76
00:03:47,323 --> 00:03:48,318
Speaker 1: Oh, well, just buy it from them.

77
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,060
Speaker 0: I don't own this apartment.

78
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,138
Speaker 1: That's not my problem.

79
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:57,960
Speaker 0: So I think what annoyed me about this was, you know, I'd rather these things fail loud than fail quiet.

80
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,478
Speaker 0: That's how it's supposed to be.

81
00:04:00,001 --> 00:04:04,300
Speaker 0: And if you live in a house, you don't notice this kind of stuff, not super sympathetic when your house burns.

82
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:04,960
Speaker 1: We live in New York.

83
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,320
Speaker 1: You can go to the 24/7 bodega, get a 9-volt battery.

84
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at 5

85
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:08,489
Speaker 0: a.m.,

86
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:09,459
Speaker 0: I don't want to go do that.

87
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,599
Speaker 1: Well, don't burn your house down.

88
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:11,970
Speaker 0: Yeah.

89
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:20,959
Speaker 0: So what annoyed me was that this repeated cycle of the super loud alarm telling me the battery is dying.

90
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,539
Speaker 1: I notice he's not going off now.

91
00:04:23,322 --> 00:04:25,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I took care of that shit.

92
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,800
Speaker 1: That's right.

93
00:04:26,702 --> 00:04:27,729
Speaker 0: It happened every 48 seconds.

94
00:04:30,224 --> 00:04:31,380
Speaker 1: You timed it with your stopwatch.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,700
Speaker 0: I laid there in bed going one, two, three, because I didn't want to get up.

96
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,780
Speaker 0: And I wondered, can I just ignore this and deal with it when I get home?

97
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,460
Speaker 0: Is it going to go off like once an hour?

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,799
Speaker 0: No, every 48 to 50 seconds.

99
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:45,500
Speaker 0: So that was my morning.

100
00:04:46,302 --> 00:04:49,080
Speaker 0: I found a dead 9-volt battery that wasn't quite dead.

101
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,920
Speaker 0: So I swapped it and that delayed it until I could get a real battery.

102
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:54,054
Speaker 0: That's my story.

103
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,899
Speaker 0: That's the exciting life of a rim.

104
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,020
Speaker 1: I'm sure I have plenty of stories because we haven't done a show in a while, but who gives a shit?

105
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,616
Speaker 1: Let's do some news.

106
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,039
Speaker 0: All right, you got some news?

107
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:03,285
Speaker 1: I do.

108
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:07,860
Speaker 1: So the 2014 Eisner Award nominations are out.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,796
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

110
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,280
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, obviously, right?

111
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:15,260
Speaker 1: You can read the nominations yourselves, right?

112
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,360
Speaker 1: But I'm going to go down this list and let's talk about some notable things, right?

113
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:22,340
Speaker 1: Notable thing number one, saga's all over this list.

114
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,540
Speaker 1: Best continuing series.

115
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,959
Speaker 1: What else is it nominated for?

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
Speaker 1: Best continuing series.

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,919
Speaker 1: Keep going.

Speaker 1: Keep going.

119
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:34,020
Speaker 0: Keep going.

120
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,239
Speaker 0: You know, this prepped it all.

121
00:05:36,022 --> 00:05:37,600
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you got to go down this whole list here.

122
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,640
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, best writer.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,670
Speaker 0: No, you didn't just do a control F.

124
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:47,750
Speaker 1: Best cover artist.

125
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,810
Speaker 1: I can't on this iPad.

126
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:50,768
Speaker 1: Ho, ho, ho, ho.

127
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,248
Speaker 1: At least not, I don't know how to.

128
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,950
Speaker 0: Highfalutin iPad can't do a grip through a file, eh?

129
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:56,610
Speaker 1: I'm sure it can.

130
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,009
Speaker 0: That's exciting right there.

131
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

132
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,208
Speaker 1: All right.

133
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,049
Speaker 1: It's got at least three.

134
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,350
Speaker 0: My superior PC can do this.

135
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's going to take all its categories for sure.

136
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,430
Speaker 0: Best continuing series, best new series, best writer.

137
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:08,069
Speaker 0: Only those three.

138
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:08,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

139
00:06:09,372 --> 00:06:11,530
Speaker 1: That Hawkeye comic is all over the place, right?

140
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,930
Speaker 0: People have said that's really good.

141
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,589
Speaker 1: Everyone says it's really good.

142
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:16,330
Speaker 1: It's nominated for a million Eisner Awards.

143
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,803
Speaker 1: It's even got like best single issue and shit like that, right?

144
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,650
Speaker 1: It's all over the place.

145
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,330
Speaker 1: It's even in more categories than Saga.

146
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,669
Speaker 0: Is that the one we read a little bit?

147
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,470
Speaker 0: I'm trying to remember.

148
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:28,006
Speaker 1: No, I've never read it.

149
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,230
Speaker 0: I think I read a different Hawkeye.

150
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,090
Speaker 1: The reason I've never read it is because by Matt Fraction.

151
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,890
Speaker 1: And Matt Fraction is this guy where everyone says his comics are so great.

152
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,410
Speaker 1: And tons of people just love him to craziness.

153
00:06:36,491 --> 00:06:37,387
Speaker 1: And he seems like a cool guy.

154
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,270
Speaker 1: But every comic I've ever read of his, at least in my opinion, has been garbage.

155
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,349
Speaker 0: Now bear in mind, we think a lot of things are garbage.

156
00:06:44,873 --> 00:06:47,650
Speaker 1: Right, but for some reason, everyone likes this guy that I don't like.

157
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,429
Speaker 1: Anyway, other notable things.

158
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,970
Speaker 1: Best limited series, Trillium's in there by Jeff LeBaron.

159
00:06:53,051 --> 00:06:53,362
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

160
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,310
Speaker 0: Shit, I forgot all about Trillium.

161
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,990
Speaker 0: I read the first floppy.

162
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:58,009
Speaker 1: Waiting for that trade.

163
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:58,849
Speaker 0: And it was great.

164
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,808
Speaker 1: Waiting for the trade.

165
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:05,850
Speaker 1: Best new series, you've got Lazarus by Greg Rucka.

166
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:06,810
Speaker 1: Greg Rucka's awesome.

167
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can dig him.

168
00:07:08,651 --> 00:07:10,230
Speaker 1: What else is going on that's exciting?

169
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,510
Speaker 1: Mouse Guard has best publication for kids, which is interesting.

170
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:16,450
Speaker 1: I don't know how much, I mean, kids can read it.

171
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,368
Speaker 1: Is it for kids?

172
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,490
Speaker 1: I would argue it's for everybody.

173
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,529
Speaker 0: Dark things happen in it, but on the level that kids seem to like.

174
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,550
Speaker 1: Sure, maybe.

175
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,870
Speaker 0: It's scary, but it's also just little mouses doing a little mouse thing.

176
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,410
Speaker 1: Vader's Little Princess is best humor publication.

177
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:33,470
Speaker 0: I could agree with that.

178
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,849
Speaker 1: I haven't read the other ones.

179
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,925
Speaker 1: So it's like I, you know, I'm just pointing out the ones that I know mostly, right?

180
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:44,830
Speaker 1: Another interesting thing is that the Oatmeal, right, by Inman, that webcomic, right?

181
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:55,050
Speaker 1: It's nominated in the best digital webcomic category, but it's also got like best short story and I think it might even be nominated for something else, which is pretty interesting.

182
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,310
Speaker 1: I think maybe the first time like a webcomic is in some other category besides best webcomic.

183
00:08:00,391 --> 00:08:02,170
Speaker 0: Oh, this list was multi-paginated.

184
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:13,210
Speaker 0: Saga's got best continuing series nomination, best writer, best painter, multimedia artist for interior art and best cover artist for Fiona specifically.

185
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,849
Speaker 0: And there's like, there's a bunch of notes next to this here.

186
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:16,420
Speaker 1: Yep.

187
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,149
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's a lot of interesting things in here.

188
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,350
Speaker 1: You know, things that, I mean, those big Prince Valiant volumes that I bought, that's in the best archival collection projects.

189
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,028
Speaker 0: Have you read those?

190
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,209
Speaker 1: I've read the first one.

191
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,397
Speaker 1: Huh?

192
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,649
Speaker 1: It's really good.

193
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:31,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

194
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,869
Speaker 1: It's like the best thing ever.

195
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,130
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid, I was always dumbfounded by Prince Valiant.

196
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know why?

197
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,210
Speaker 1: Because you go to the newspaper and you get this one giant panel and you're like, what the fuck originally?

198
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,950
Speaker 1: So the original Prince Valiant took up basically a whole newspaper page per comic.

199
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:47,150
Speaker 1: They were gigantic, right?

200
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:53,570
Speaker 1: So these collected editions that I'm buying are the size of these hardcovers that are the size of an old newspaper.

201
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:54,128
Speaker 1: They're huge.

202
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,970
Speaker 1: And it's like the original size printing, right?

203
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:58,210
Speaker 1: From the beginning in order.

204
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,168
Speaker 1: So you know what's happening, not like when you read in the newspaper and you're like, what's going on?

205
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,210
Speaker 1: I've never read a Prince Valiant in my life.

206
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,028
Speaker 1: Who are these people?

207
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:07,030
Speaker 1: Is that Valiant or is that Valiant?

208
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:07,646
Speaker 1: I don't know.

209
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,069
Speaker 1: And it's like you won't even know what's going on.

210
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,330
Speaker 1: And it was like this tiny small piece, right?

211
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,530
Speaker 1: So it wasn't the Prince Valiant that we were reading in the newspaper as kids wasn't the original one, right?

212
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:18,788
Speaker 1: It was some other one.

213
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:22,150
Speaker 1: It was by later artists and writers, not the originals.

214
00:09:23,052 --> 00:09:27,490
Speaker 1: So anyway, but yeah, lots of interesting nominations here.

215
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,290
Speaker 1: You know, you can't vote, I guess, but you can go and look and see who's nominated.

216
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,770
Speaker 1: It'll be more interesting than, I guess, Tony Award nominations.

217
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,120
Speaker 0: Yep.

218
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:50,490
Speaker 0: I have a feeling if we haven't talked about them already, many of the things that win them we'll probably read and talk about because after Kill La Kill, there's like, I'm watching anime still, but there's not a, there's a hole in my anime.

219
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,338
Speaker 1: This weird thing seems to happen a lot.

220
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:55,815
Speaker 1: where it's like, you know, you go down and it's like most of these categories.

221
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:59,570
Speaker 1: I've read at most one or two of, right?

222
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,690
Speaker 1: In some categories, zero of, right?

223
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:05,770
Speaker 1: And even the ones where I haven't read, it's like, I've heard of maybe one more than that.

224
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,610
Speaker 1: So it's like 75% of the things in this list I've never heard of at all, period, right?

225
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:18,670
Speaker 1: Yet when they come out with the awards in the end, usually it's the things I've heard of or have already read that win most of the time.

226
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,230
Speaker 0: Well, to be fair, we have not been super paying attention to comics lately.

227
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:23,850
Speaker 1: I know.

228
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:25,669
Speaker 0: It's been gaming and anime season.

229
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,510
Speaker 1: The thing is my buying comics rate is steady.

230
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:34,069
Speaker 1: It never changes, but my reading comics rate goes way down and now I have all these comics to read, no time to read them.

231
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,630
Speaker 0: My buying comics rate is extremely, it's on the level of, oh right, I was waiting for that comic to come to trades.

232
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,103
Speaker 0: Amazon.

233
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,170
Speaker 0: Is it on trades?

234
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:42,466
Speaker 0: Yes.

235
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,882
Speaker 0: Buy it at like 30 or 40% off.

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,088
Speaker 1: Right.

237
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:46,950
Speaker 0: That's why I caught up on all the My Little Pony.

238
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,209
Speaker 1: So I think what I'm going to do is, you know, I'm going to try- Any adventure time.

239
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:51,650
Speaker 1: Right.

240
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,890
Speaker 1: What I'm going to do this summer is whenever I go biking, I'm going to bring comics.

241
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,170
Speaker 1: That way I can read them in the park.

242
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,110
Speaker 0: Bike to the park, read a comic, bike home.

243
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:00,486
Speaker 0: That's right.

244
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,710
Speaker 1: And that way I will efficiently read more comics.

245
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:13,869
Speaker 0: If we do that, then I think we'll have to review a lot of comics because like I said, anime still going strong, but there's a little hole in my anime watching because Kill la Kill is gone.

246
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:22,270
Speaker 0: So speaking of anime and these other things, if you didn't notice, an anime person did an adventure time episode.

247
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,810
Speaker 1: Well, is going to or is working on or is almost done with?

248
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,670
Speaker 0: It's already done, but it's not going to air right away because that's how things work.

249
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,349
Speaker 0: It's not like animators finish your show and then it's on TV that day.

250
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,470
Speaker 0: But the guy who's doing ping pong, which is kind of up our alley.

251
00:11:41,454 --> 00:11:42,350
Speaker 1: So shame on rim.

252
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,990
Speaker 1: Didn't know who Masaaki Yuasa was until like two seconds ago.

253
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:48,490
Speaker 1: Even though people have basically been talking about his awesomeness for many moons.

254
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's a lot of people like that people talk about.

255
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,849
Speaker 1: Sure, I guess.

256
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,090
Speaker 1: But you're you're the one who's out of the loop.

257
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,650
Speaker 1: All the other people who at least know about anime know who this is.

258
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew vaguely who it was, but I looked at his list of stuff.

259
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,450
Speaker 1: A lot of the listeners probably have no clue who it is.

260
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,469
Speaker 0: I looked at his list of stuff.

261
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:09,230
Speaker 0: If you remove all the things where he can animated one episode, not super prolific yet.

262
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 1: No, he's not prolific, but he's just like, as soon as he did one thing, people are like, whoa, because he does shit crazy different from everyone else.

263
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,309
Speaker 1: He's got a really distinctive style.

264
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,249
Speaker 0: Well, way back there was that anime, a kimonozu man.

265
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,467
Speaker 1: Right.

266
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,289
Speaker 1: And it's like we really didn't know his name at the time or that he was the one responsible, but it stood out.

267
00:12:26,971 --> 00:12:30,430
Speaker 1: So since then, he's done a bunch of other stuff and is doing more stuff.

268
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,190
Speaker 1: So ping pong is the big thing he's doing at the moment.

269
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:36,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think ping pong now is why I'm going to get really excited about it.

270
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,228
Speaker 0: They got ping pong.

271
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:37,546
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,428
Speaker 0: One, I play ping pong.

273
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:44,669
Speaker 0: So that that might be for me, kind of like your Shonen boys on bike show is for you.

274
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:46,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah.

275
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,350
Speaker 1: So from what I gather, probably give me a better show.

276
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,190
Speaker 0: This Adventure Time episode that he did, he wrote it, storyboarded it and directed it.

277
00:12:54,751 --> 00:13:01,290
Speaker 0: And apparently he had zero restrictions on what the episode consisted of.

278
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,729
Speaker 0: He was told to just go nuts and do whatever he wanted to do.

279
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,610
Speaker 1: I'm sure he didn't interfere with the overarching plot and just made a one off.

280
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,809
Speaker 0: I wonder what they would have done if he had come back to them like, all right, this is this is my storyboard.

281
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:18,710
Speaker 0: And it's like Finn dying and then being reincarnated in the 80s and becomes a detective.

282
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:20,109
Speaker 0: And that's the entire episode.

283
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,850
Speaker 1: They would have just had to be that and then moved on.

284
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,670
Speaker 1: The same way Cowabeebop did with the alien in the fridge episode.

285
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:26,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, they all died.

286
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,710
Speaker 1: Up next episode.

287
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:28,470
Speaker 1: Nothing happened.

288
00:13:28,532 --> 00:13:29,010
Speaker 0: They didn't die.

289
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,869
Speaker 0: They were just taking a coma and the ship was already set to guide toward that waypoint where there would have been doctors.

290
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:35,610
Speaker 1: Sure.

291
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,769
Speaker 1: Whatever you say.

292
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:37,589
Speaker 0: That could have worked out.

293
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,328
Speaker 1: Whatever you say.

294
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,989
Speaker 0: It's not like Samurai Champloo where it just didn't make any fucking sense.

295
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,510
Speaker 0: So this adventure time episode will be interesting.

296
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,669
Speaker 0: Ping pong will be interesting and we'll see where this guy goes.

297
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:50,650
Speaker 1: He's already gone.

298
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:52,409
Speaker 1: You're just the only one who has it.

299
00:13:52,713 --> 00:13:53,950
Speaker 0: I'm saying he hasn't done a lot yet.

300
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,210
Speaker 0: Let's see where he's done a lot.

301
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:02,289
Speaker 1: But everything that Misaki Wasa has done has been critically acclaimed and known and recognized by the whole anime community, even in the US.

302
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,889
Speaker 1: And you were the only one who hasn't noticed.

303
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:09,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure everyone in the US is really excited about Photo Kano episode seven.

304
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,650
Speaker 1: He did Kick Heart.

305
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,470
Speaker 1: His Kickstarter was huge and all over the anime news everywhere.

306
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:14,946
Speaker 1: Yeah.

307
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,470
Speaker 1: He did Mind Game, a highly lauded and very much celebrated Studio 4C production.

308
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:22,250
Speaker 1: Right.

309
00:14:22,492 --> 00:14:24,589
Speaker 1: Was a big deal when it happened.

310
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,008
Speaker 1: Is not this unknown person.

311
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,537
Speaker 0: You are just failing to admit that you were just in the dark.

312
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,790
Speaker 1: Everybody knows who Misaki Wasa is already.

313
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:37,150
Speaker 1: One already a big deal.

314
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,128
Speaker 1: He's not going places.

315
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,409
Speaker 1: He is places now.

316
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,190
Speaker 0: I didn't say he wasn't a big deal.

317
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,649
Speaker 1: You said you'll see where he goes.

318
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,009
Speaker 0: Basically, what's he going to do next?

319
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:45,830
Speaker 0: Give him ten years.

320
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:46,827
Speaker 0: What else is he going to do?

321
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,945
Speaker 1: You are just simply someone who does not know and will not admit.

322
00:14:51,026 --> 00:14:51,729
Speaker 1: you do not know.

323
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,790
Speaker 0: I wasn't super up on him.

324
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:54,589
Speaker 0: What do you want me to say?

325
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,249
Speaker 1: Now you have admitted the truth.

326
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,409
Speaker 1: Everyone else knows already.

327
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,869
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that most of the people listening have no idea about any of this.

328
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:04,069
Speaker 1: We'll see.

329
00:15:04,811 --> 00:15:07,470
Speaker 1: Anyone in the anime community already knows.

330
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,910
Speaker 0: Anyone in the anime community.

331
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,570
Speaker 0: The anime community.

332
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,129
Speaker 1: Exactly.

333
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,849
Speaker 0: The anime community that doesn't even know.

334
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:15,469
Speaker 0: Like they didn't know who Tomino was.

335
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,630
Speaker 0: Only the Gundam people knew.

336
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,990
Speaker 1: That's not the anime community.

337
00:15:18,313 --> 00:15:19,290
Speaker 1: That's the Homestuck community.

338
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,489
Speaker 0: So you're talking about Anna Twitter.

339
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,086
Speaker 0: Yes.

340
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:21,690
Speaker 0: Okay.

341
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,050
Speaker 0: That's not the anime community.

342
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:23,567
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

343
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,010
Speaker 0: That's the people who tweet.

344
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,669
Speaker 0: That's like Mike Tool, you, me, Daryl Surratt.

345
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:28,947
Speaker 1: The real people.

346
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:29,367
Speaker 1: Yeah.

347
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,130
Speaker 1: Everybody knows.

348
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,370
Speaker 0: Okay, Anna Twitter knows.

349
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,008
Speaker 0: I'll give you that.

350
00:15:33,473 --> 00:15:35,229
Speaker 1: But you didn't, so you're not Anna Twitter, I guess.

351
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:35,827
Speaker 0: Yeah.

352
00:15:36,273 --> 00:15:37,070
Speaker 0: I mean, I knew the name.

353
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,230
Speaker 0: I just didn't think of all the things he'd done together.

354
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,150
Speaker 0: I completely forgot about Kamonosume.

355
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,549
Speaker 0: In fact, I pretty much always forget about that until I see it.

356
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,630
Speaker 0: And I remember the girl with the big monster arm.

357
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:49,950
Speaker 1: All his stuff looks like this.

358
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:50,119
Speaker 0: Yeah.

359
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,609
Speaker 0: Well, Ping Pong doesn't have monster arms yet.

360
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,850
Speaker 1: It still looks like this.

361
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,929
Speaker 0: So as a little aside, tiny news.

362
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:11,870
Speaker 0: If you were mad about the bag checks at PAX or Anime Boston, or if you're mad about the fact that basically the city of Boston prevents Anime Boston from having their little anime rave or pretty much anything else weird that's happened in Boston.

363
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:19,389
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know the fact that Boston forced PAX to have fewer women's restrooms and wouldn't let them make them gender neutral.

364
00:16:20,076 --> 00:16:21,650
Speaker 0: The mayor of Boston, Marty Walsh.

365
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,410
Speaker 1: They let him have one or two gender neutral.

366
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:31,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, they let him have one gender neutral in one area, and they refused to let them turn any of the other ones into gender neutral.

367
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:42,070
Speaker 0: They just turned them without the cons real approval into men's bathrooms, thus causing women's bathroom deserts in certain parts of the convention.

368
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,809
Speaker 0: And apparently the Boston response to complaints from PAX was, yeah, fuck you.

369
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,429
Speaker 0: So the mayor of Boston's doing an AMA on Reddit.

370
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,032
Speaker 1: It's not like.

371
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,150
Speaker 1: he's going to respond to your question regarding this.

372
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,250
Speaker 0: He's not going to respond to anyone.

373
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:57,904
Speaker 0: These things already are going to be 99% about marijuana.

374
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:04,444
Speaker 0: So I'd ask you to make this one 80% about marijuana, 20% about PAX and Anime Boston.

375
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,310
Speaker 1: Okay, good luck.

376
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,229
Speaker 0: That's what I'm shooting for.

377
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,306
Speaker 0: Let's make sure that 100% of the questions are still questions.

378
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:12,304
Speaker 0: he's not going to want to answer.

379
00:17:13,393 --> 00:17:14,170
Speaker 1: He's not going to answer.

380
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:20,500
Speaker 1: Someone else is going to copy and paste pre written answers on things that he's already decided he wants to answer about is to look for the.

381
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:26,550
Speaker 1: basically someone's job is going to take these answers, find the question they apply to and post it as a reply.

382
00:17:26,711 --> 00:17:30,330
Speaker 1: And after they posted every answer they've already pre written, stop answering.

383
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:31,309
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

384
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:33,070
Speaker 0: You have figured out politics.

385
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,048
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

386
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:38,070
Speaker 0: It's still good to do these things anyway, because the more torrent there is, he'll have.

387
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,209
Speaker 1: at least there's a naive person out there who this works on.

388
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:48,620
Speaker 0: Now, what it is is they'll have an aide somewhere who keeps track of what people actually asked about and goes into some statistics folder.

389
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:50,250
Speaker 0: that probably gets ignored.

390
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,768
Speaker 0: So that's the impact we're shooting for.

391
00:17:54,371 --> 00:18:02,110
Speaker 0: Or if nothing else, if you ask the really good question, it becomes a focal point itself of people who are mad, even though he'll never answer.

392
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,289
Speaker 0: No one in the government will ever see it or look at it.

393
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:08,630
Speaker 0: It gives you sort of a rallying point for your tiny marijuana driven cause.

394
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:10,930
Speaker 0: It's mostly marijuana.

395
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:23,060
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, I found this area of YouTube and I'm going to link to it.

396
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,677
Speaker 0: My thing of the day.

397
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:26,900
Speaker 0: This is an hour, two hour long video.

398
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 0: And it's just a whole bunch of old Donald cartoons in a row.

399
00:18:30,823 --> 00:18:31,175
Speaker 1: That's yours.

400
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,460
Speaker 0: Super high quality.

401
00:18:33,283 --> 00:18:36,560
Speaker 1: And more importantly, how is this not taken down by Disney?

402
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:37,336
Speaker 0: What fucking knows?

403
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,956
Speaker 0: These videos have been up for a long time.

404
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:42,080
Speaker 0: It's got like 7 million views and there's a million of them.

405
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,300
Speaker 0: Every old Disney cartoon is just right here.

406
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:44,800
Speaker 1: All right.

407
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:45,680
Speaker 1: Good job, Disney.

408
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,820
Speaker 0: It was uploaded by Jeff and Dale.

409
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:49,660
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe that's official.

410
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

411
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:50,779
Speaker 0: I don't know.

412
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:51,718
Speaker 0: I didn't really look into it.

413
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,660
Speaker 1: Those are your best buddies.

414
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,000
Speaker 0: Wow.

415
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,259
Speaker 0: This video is almost as many dislikes as likes.

416
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:57,316
Speaker 1: Okay.

417
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,120
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

418
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:02,000
Speaker 0: But these are not just any Disney videos.

419
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,279
Speaker 1: They're the Nazi ones?

420
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,940
Speaker 0: No, it's not the weird ones that are like not shown anywhere.

421
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:15,080
Speaker 0: These are the ones that when I was a kid, I would rent from like video stores that predated Blockbuster on Beta fucking Max tapes.

422
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:16,420
Speaker 1: Like Goofy playing golf?

423
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

424
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,519
Speaker 0: These are like Goofy playing golf.

425
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,620
Speaker 0: These are like the Donald Duck and Chip and Dale fighting over popcorn.

426
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,000
Speaker 0: Like those kinds.

427
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:40,220
Speaker 0: And the one thing I've noticed the most watching all these again as adult, Donald Duck plays the most dangerous game because in multiple of these, he has a goddamn rec room with a lot of dead animals on the walls, multiple shotguns.

428
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,998
Speaker 0: And in one of them, he has all these duck lures just hanging out with a shotgun, just sitting right next to them.

429
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,198
Speaker 0: What is Donald Duck up to?

430
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Speaker 1: Well, in the Warner Brothers universe, right?

431
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,320
Speaker 1: Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny are getting hunted by Elmer Fudd all the time, right?

432
00:19:56,342 --> 00:19:56,495
Speaker 1: True.

433
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,300
Speaker 1: In the Disney universe, there is no Elmer Fudd because Donald Duck murdered him and lives in his house.

434
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:08,540
Speaker 0: Donald Duck also kind of an asshole, but.

435
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,940
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, he's a sailor, so he knows how to shoot, right?

436
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 1: Not that you shoot too often in the Navy, but you shoot more than zero.

437
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,400
Speaker 0: As much of an asshole as he is, Huey, Dewey and Louie are way more asshole.

438
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,800
Speaker 1: Apple does not fall far from the other branch of the tree.

439
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:26,839
Speaker 0: I was about to correct you just in case.

440
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:32,139
Speaker 0: But like there's one where Donald Duck is just hanging out in this lighthouse, working the lighthouse, doing his thing.

441
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:34,280
Speaker 0: And he sees another bird, a pelican asleep.

442
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,600
Speaker 0: So he's like, well, fuck that guy.

443
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,819
Speaker 0: He just points the lighthouse at him and starts fucking with him.

444
00:20:39,862 --> 00:20:41,098
Speaker 0: And then the pelican fucks him up.

445
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:41,656
Speaker 0: The end.

446
00:20:42,803 --> 00:20:44,779
Speaker 0: And he pretty much deserved everything that happened to him.

447
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,480
Speaker 0: These are a great way to kill two hours.

448
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,719
Speaker 1: Now we don't have to watch him anymore.

449
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,180
Speaker 1: He just told everything to happen.

450
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:55,580
Speaker 1: So this is something I feel like might have been a thing of the day in the past.

451
00:20:57,081 --> 00:21:03,540
Speaker 1: But it's like and it's something I've definitely seen before, but I found it again and it's awesome.

452
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,256
Speaker 1: So who cares?

453
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:08,240
Speaker 1: And I'm too lazy to look up whether it's actually a thing of the day in the past or not.

454
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,539
Speaker 1: So I'll just read the text for you because it's very short.

455
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,937
Speaker 1: Three space colony summer studies were conducted at NASA Ames in the 70s.

456
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,679
Speaker 1: A number of artistic renderings of the concepts were made.

457
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,719
Speaker 1: They have been scanned and are available here as small, medium, large and publication quality JPEG scans by some guy.

458
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,580
Speaker 1: Images are not copyrighted.

459
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,139
Speaker 1: Please credit photos to NASA Ames Research Center.

460
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:33,480
Speaker 1: So I made some desktop wallpapers.

461
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, these are basically just amazing artistic renderings of not real space colonies.

462
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:44,739
Speaker 1: But you look at these and it's like, oh, that's where the Gundam space colony design came from.

463
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,260
Speaker 1: Pretty much stolen directly from these or borrowed or whatever.

464
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Speaker 1: I guess since they're not copyrighted, not stolen either, right?

465
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,540
Speaker 1: But yeah, here's your next desktop wallpaper for all your computers.

466
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,958
Speaker 1: There are many to choose from.

467
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,740
Speaker 1: Also, I really wonder how did the Gundam artists see these images that were made at NASA?

468
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,140
Speaker 1: Like, how did they get around at the time?

469
00:22:09,481 --> 00:22:11,780
Speaker 1: Were they printed somewhere that they saw them in Japan?

470
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,880
Speaker 0: Maybe they were in like a popular science or something like that.

471
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

472
00:22:16,561 --> 00:22:17,179
Speaker 0: Maybe they were part of.

473
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:22,500
Speaker 0: Maybe the designs of these things were just somehow confluent.

474
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,859
Speaker 1: Maybe it seems unlikely when you see the pictures.

475
00:22:26,323 --> 00:22:27,853
Speaker 1: It's like, no, there's no way.

476
00:22:27,873 --> 00:22:32,939
Speaker 1: because it's like, wow, that's a direct shot from War in the Pocket right there in that picture.

477
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,680
Speaker 0: A space station shaped like a kid's butt with a slingshot.

478
00:22:38,502 --> 00:22:42,020
Speaker 1: Whoa, not that.

479
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:42,771
Speaker 1: No, I know.

480
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:44,283
Speaker 0: It just.

481
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:49,998
Speaker 0: I was recently looking for a good picture of War in the Pocket and I couldn't find anything better than that.

482
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:54,839
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in the moment, the book club book is.

483
00:22:56,048 --> 00:22:56,720
Speaker 1: Oh, the book club book.

484
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:59,140
Speaker 1: I have chosen the book club book.

485
00:22:59,361 --> 00:22:59,638
Speaker 1: I have.

486
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:10,818
Speaker 1: So remember how we were talking about, you know, when we talked about wool, we talked about how wool is the same as fallout is the same as, you know, the other ones.

487
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,039
Speaker 0: You've forgotten all the other examples.

488
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,339
Speaker 0: Paranoia, Logan's run.

489
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,099
Speaker 1: All those.

490
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,059
Speaker 1: It's the same as all those.

491
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,211
Speaker 1: Right.

492
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,199
Speaker 1: Someone mentioned one that was another one of those.

493
00:23:21,969 --> 00:23:22,240
Speaker 1: Right.

494
00:23:22,862 --> 00:23:24,500
Speaker 1: That I'd never heard of before.

495
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:27,160
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, that's interesting.

496
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:27,936
Speaker 1: Another one of those.

497
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:33,898
Speaker 1: But then, like, coincidentally, like a few days later, like Boing Boing made a post about it.

498
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:37,539
Speaker 1: And I'm like, and I'm like, something must be up.

499
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:39,338
Speaker 1: The antennas are up.

500
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,900
Speaker 1: Something is happening.

501
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:42,339
Speaker 1: So I'm like, you know what?

502
00:23:43,042 --> 00:23:45,920
Speaker 1: If the antennas are up, just why don't even hesitate.

503
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,616
Speaker 1: Just go for it.

504
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:47,079
Speaker 1: Right.

505
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:49,498
Speaker 1: So let me let me read this here.

506
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:56,531
Speaker 1: A Canticle for Liebowitz is a post apocalyptic science fiction novel, something from the 60s.

507
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,059
Speaker 1: And I guess they said it's about the same thing.

508
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,700
Speaker 1: And that's older than any of those other fucking ones.

509
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,080
Speaker 1: Right.

510
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:04,877
Speaker 1: You find one older than this.

511
00:24:05,682 --> 00:24:07,100
Speaker 0: That's been on my radar for a while.

512
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,379
Speaker 0: Emily's been bugging me to read it.

513
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,140
Speaker 0: I think Luke was telling me that's what I heard at first from Luke.

514
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:12,659
Speaker 1: And then I saw it on Boing Boing again.

515
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:15,537
Speaker 1: So this is published in 59, not even the 60s.

516
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,639
Speaker 1: So if that if this is one of those, this is probably the first one of those.

517
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:22,199
Speaker 1: So then we don't have to read any more of those.

518
00:24:23,207 --> 00:24:23,555
Speaker 1: There you go.

519
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:24,938
Speaker 0: Unless it's bad.

520
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,360
Speaker 1: It's possible.

521
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,339
Speaker 0: Then you got to keep reading them.

522
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,240
Speaker 1: But why the fuck is everyone talking about it if it's so bad?

523
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,740
Speaker 0: Probably because wool and all these other things have come out and people are really into that.

524
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,860
Speaker 1: Also, our book club book seems to have a tradition of saying, this is the first one of those like Snow Crash.

525
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,879
Speaker 1: This is the first one.

526
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,660
Speaker 1: So we're going to read all the first ones.

527
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:47,956
Speaker 0: Watch out, though, because there might be an urr version of this.

528
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:50,880
Speaker 0: going back to like, I don't know, Stanislaw Lem might have written something.

529
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,120
Speaker 1: You go find it for me.

530
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,218
Speaker 1: We'll change a book club selection.

531
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:54,800
Speaker 0: I'm down with this book.

532
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,540
Speaker 1: Also, it's an old sci-fi novel.

533
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,419
Speaker 1: I'm betting it's short.

534
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,780
Speaker 0: Pretty sure I already own it.

535
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,660
Speaker 1: I'm betting it's short.

536
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,200
Speaker 1: I don't know how many pages.

537
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,758
Speaker 1: It could be long.

538
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,395
Speaker 1: I haven't read it.

539
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:02,872
Speaker 1: All right.

540
00:25:03,281 --> 00:25:03,917
Speaker 1: But it could be.

541
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaker 1: I'm betting that it's not long.

542
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,867
Speaker 0: So this weekend in Lancaster, It's 320 pages.

543
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,620
Speaker 0: Pennsylvania.

544
00:25:11,441 --> 00:25:14,060
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Zenkai Con 2014.

545
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,860
Speaker 0: It's a moderately sized anime con, especially for Pennsylvania.

546
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,559
Speaker 0: Supposedly Lancaster has okay food, though.

547
00:25:20,081 --> 00:25:21,000
Speaker 0: It has Amish food.

548
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,820
Speaker 0: We're told the food closes at like seven o'clock.

549
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:24,999
Speaker 1: Well, Amish people.

550
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,579
Speaker 1: They got to get home in their buggy.

551
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:28,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it takes a while.

552
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:33,616
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we're taking the train out there on Saturday at 10 a.m.

553
00:25:33,697 --> 00:25:34,760
Speaker 0: in Live 3.

554
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,159
Speaker 0: We're doing anime openers from around the world.

555
00:25:37,863 --> 00:25:38,259
Speaker 1: Exciting.

556
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:39,828
Speaker 0: On Saturday at 1 30 p.m.

557
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:42,500
Speaker 0: in Live 3.

558
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:42,884
Speaker 0: We're doing.

559
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,420
Speaker 0: all anime are the same.

560
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Speaker 1: I hope I still have it.

561
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,980
Speaker 0: This one's also known as It's All Scott because he wrote the panel.

562
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,460
Speaker 0: He put it together and he might have deleted all the source material.

563
00:25:53,163 --> 00:25:56,480
Speaker 0: If that's the case, I'll show up and we'll see what happens in this panel.

564
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,280
Speaker 1: Just do something.

565
00:25:57,781 --> 00:25:58,880
Speaker 1: No one will show up to our panel anymore.

566
00:25:59,081 --> 00:25:59,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, they might.

567
00:26:00,421 --> 00:26:02,300
Speaker 0: That's a moderately provocative title.

568
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:02,855
Speaker 0: Maybe.

569
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,629
Speaker 0: And then on Sunday at 10 30

570
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:04,850
Speaker 0: a.m.,

571
00:26:04,891 --> 00:26:06,300
Speaker 0: we are doing bad games.

572
00:26:06,462 --> 00:26:07,398
Speaker 0: Our panel from PAX.

573
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:08,519
Speaker 1: Okay.

574
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,320
Speaker 0: Well, the previous PAX.

575
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,558
Speaker 0: The the previous previous PAX.

576
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,380
Speaker 0: PAX Prime.

577
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,319
Speaker 0: Because our most recent PAX panel was Why No One Will Game With You, which I got video of.

578
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,217
Speaker 0: I'll see if I upload it.

579
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:19,552
Speaker 0: Okay.

580
00:26:19,781 --> 00:26:20,918
Speaker 0: I haven't gone through it too much yet.

581
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:22,115
Speaker 1: Okay.

582
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got two episodes of Geek Nights Presents Utena that I just have to edit and upload.

583
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:29,258
Speaker 0: They're already pretty much good to go.

584
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,780
Speaker 1: I got three videos from the latest Netrunner tournament.

585
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,750
Speaker 1: 20-sided store.

586
00:26:33,771 --> 00:26:34,419
Speaker 1: I have to upload.

587
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:36,539
Speaker 1: But my upload is slow.

588
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:36,988
Speaker 1: No.

589
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:40,259
Speaker 0: For a small fee, I could upload it for you.

590
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,440
Speaker 1: Oh, you know who won that tournament?

591
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:42,419
Speaker 0: Uh, you.

592
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:42,877
Speaker 1: Maybe.

593
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,213
Speaker 1: Really?

594
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:43,674
Speaker 1: Maybe.

595
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,198
Speaker 0: All right.

596
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:45,000
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

597
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,118
Speaker 0: Spoilers.

598
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,800
Speaker 1: There was no one there.

599
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,020
Speaker 1: It was like six people total.

600
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:48,938
Speaker 0: So Kill La Kill.

601
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,800
Speaker 0: One, if you haven't watched Kill La Kill, don't listen because we're going to spoil it.

602
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:53,858
Speaker 0: Final thoughts.

603
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,997
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about the show as we watched it.

604
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,380
Speaker 0: So seriously.

605
00:26:58,062 --> 00:26:59,900
Speaker 1: Who hasn't watched the whole thing?

606
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,128
Speaker 0: Who hasn't watched the whole thing?

607
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,740
Speaker 0: who listens to an anime podcast?

608
00:27:03,586 --> 00:27:03,776
Speaker 1: Really?

609
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:04,958
Speaker 1: Really?

610
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,740
Speaker 1: Who has internet access to listen to podcasts, but doesn't have...

611
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,420
Speaker 0: So here's what I've noticed among other people talking about Kill La Kill.

612
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,798
Speaker 0: Unlike Attack on Titan, which had one wave of people who were really into it, and then the wave of everybody else watched it.

613
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:24,739
Speaker 0: This one has a ton of tiny waves.

614
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,760
Speaker 0: Like people were saying, oh, this is great.

615
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:28,780
Speaker 0: We watched it.

616
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,680
Speaker 1: We saw it coming a mile away because I saw all the other trigger things.

617
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,900
Speaker 1: And I said, anything that says trigger on it, I will pull the trigger on.

618
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:42,979
Speaker 0: But I saw a lot of other people who would watch one, two episodes and say things to the effect of this looks porny.

619
00:27:43,381 --> 00:27:44,280
Speaker 0: This looks dumb.

620
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,634
Speaker 0: It does.

621
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,779
Speaker 0: This looks crazy.

622
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:47,779
Speaker 0: I'm not comfortable with this.

623
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,778
Speaker 0: I'm not going to watch it.

624
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,099
Speaker 1: In that first episode, I was like, oh my God, this nakedness.

625
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,655
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I was like, that Kamigori.

626
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,920
Speaker 0: Did Kamigori just jump off the side of the building?

627
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:00,077
Speaker 1: I'm watching this show.

628
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:03,679
Speaker 0: When he's there at the door at the bottom of that scene.

629
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,880
Speaker 0: But then the many of those people who said these things would watch one or two more episodes.

630
00:28:11,262 --> 00:28:12,199
Speaker 1: If they could be forced to.

631
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,099
Speaker 0: And then they tweet something to the effect of, you know, I don't know, the show might actually be pretty good.

632
00:28:17,742 --> 00:28:21,899
Speaker 0: And then they basically just blitz to the end and then talk about how it was one of the greatest things they've ever seen.

633
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:34,479
Speaker 0: I've seen so many people go from not watching this to marathoned it over the course of five episodes, that if you have avoided the show for any reason, trust us, watch it.

634
00:28:35,201 --> 00:28:45,579
Speaker 0: Even if you get to the end and somehow still think that it is an objectively horrible show or you have serious beef with it, at least now you can argue with us about it.

635
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,418
Speaker 0: It's a notable show, even if you don't like it.

636
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:50,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

637
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,979
Speaker 0: Because it might have saved anime.

638
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,780
Speaker 0: Well, this is Space Dandy.

639
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,879
Speaker 1: How's anime doing right now?

640
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:57,598
Speaker 1: Not that it's okay.

641
00:28:57,841 --> 00:29:00,180
Speaker 0: Anime is like, it's coming up, coming along.

642
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:00,819
Speaker 1: It's doing okay.

643
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,120
Speaker 0: Got to watch, I got to finish Space Dandy.

644
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,480
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the last few episodes.

645
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,140
Speaker 1: Well, you're going to get some more pretty soon.

646
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:06,409
Speaker 1: I know.

647
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,056
Speaker 1: A month or two.

648
00:29:07,525 --> 00:29:07,694
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,319
Speaker 1: April's almost over.

650
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:10,999
Speaker 0: Oh, God.

651
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:11,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

652
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,780
Speaker 0: I mean, Adventure Time season six already started out.

653
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,220
Speaker 1: That's right.

654
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,920
Speaker 0: So Kill La Kill ended very well, in my opinion.

655
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:25,079
Speaker 0: It was a show where had they flubbed the ending, it could have gone from A to B.

656
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,700
Speaker 1: Right.

657
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,997
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the ending wasn't, like, I was expecting the ending to be like, boom, holy sugar.

658
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,059
Speaker 1: But it wasn't.

659
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,480
Speaker 1: It was really, the ending was really one or two episodes before the last episode.

660
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,740
Speaker 1: And the last two episodes are just like, you know how it's going to end?

661
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:40,879
Speaker 1: We're just going to do it.

662
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,939
Speaker 1: Like, you know, we're going to do it.

663
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:42,660
Speaker 0: And here it is.

664
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:48,100
Speaker 0: We accept that it did not do the Eva existential thing that I expected it to do.

665
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,160
Speaker 1: I didn't expect that at all.

666
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:50,038
Speaker 0: I expected that.

667
00:29:50,643 --> 00:29:51,740
Speaker 0: Not to the level of Eva.

668
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,772
Speaker 1: I just expected, like, oh, you know, it's like.

669
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:58,000
Speaker 1: the show was so over the top and it was always one upping itself.

670
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,100
Speaker 1: I thought it would one up itself and then two up itself and three up itself.

671
00:30:01,201 --> 00:30:02,031
Speaker 1: And at the end, 100 up itself.

672
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:03,739
Speaker 1: But it didn't.

673
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,200
Speaker 1: It just brought it up to the highest level and then maintained it for the last two to three episodes.

674
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:11,120
Speaker 1: And I'm like, so the ending was sort of like, yep, that's the ending.

675
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:11,560
Speaker 1: All right.

676
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:13,495
Speaker 1: As opposed to like, yeah.

677
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:36,118
Speaker 0: But I guess what I expected of, say, three episodes before the end was something more like Big O because the show had a lot of these sort of metaphorical elements that I expected the ending to be something more along the lines of junketsu and Satsuki talking to each other.

678
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,740
Speaker 0: And there being some sort of understanding between like some sort of dialogue with the life fibers.

679
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:42,498
Speaker 0: And then that would have been the end.

680
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,440
Speaker 0: And it was actually kind of refreshing that that didn't work.

681
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:49,038
Speaker 0: And the real end was just fucking kill them all.

682
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:50,899
Speaker 0: They were the bad guy.

683
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:51,634
Speaker 0: The end.

684
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,340
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, the show, as much as it borrowed from things that we like, such as Ava, Nutenna and whatnot.

686
00:30:58,661 --> 00:30:59,659
Speaker 0: It went its own way.

687
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,860
Speaker 1: Well, that but it borrowed mostly from like Mazinger and that sort of, you know, going a guy type of thing more than the other things that borrowed from.

688
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:08,179
Speaker 1: Right.

689
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Speaker 1: So, of course, it ends with kill all the bad guys exploding and fighting.

690
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,020
Speaker 1: Right.

691
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:16,040
Speaker 1: As opposed to an Ava ending or a Nutenna ending.

692
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,208
Speaker 0: Yep.

693
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:29,456
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the kill everything ending has extra ramifications for this kind of story because all the characters we know and love, except for Ryuko, are just normal people now.

694
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:32,460
Speaker 1: No, they're still crazy people.

695
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,140
Speaker 0: Oh, they're crazy people, but they no longer have superpowers.

696
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,940
Speaker 1: I guess someone could still.

697
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, it's like, are there still any Goku uniforms anywhere?

698
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:41,957
Speaker 0: Yeah.

699
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:49,380
Speaker 0: They said that they would all basically, you know, not have power sources anymore and would die except for Yuko, I guess, because she's made of them.

700
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:56,279
Speaker 0: And I guess she's just going to be a God in this world now because she might literally be the most powerful being in the entire earth at the end of the show.

701
00:31:56,426 --> 00:31:56,517
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,758
Speaker 1: But like if all life fibers lose power, but they're still in her heart, is she dead or she didn't?

703
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,579
Speaker 1: She's obviously not dead.

704
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:02,710
Speaker 1: Right.

705
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,800
Speaker 0: But it's like, well, because she's a perfect synthesis of life fibers and man.

706
00:32:08,047 --> 00:32:08,237
Speaker 1: Yeah.

707
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:14,816
Speaker 1: I mean, if you really care about, you know, checking the growth of Gandalf in this show, you're not going to get too far.

708
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:18,959
Speaker 0: Though the show gives you enough to debate it at length if you wish.

709
00:32:19,281 --> 00:32:20,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, go for it.

710
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,380
Speaker 0: Look, look, everyone has a time in their life.

711
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,500
Speaker 1: That's not the most important part of it.

712
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,920
Speaker 1: It's far from it so no one cares.

713
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:34,580
Speaker 0: Scott, there was a time when even you and I and other people would sit up late at night debating about the literal details of what happened in Evangelion.

714
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,219
Speaker 1: But we know the answer to that.

715
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:36,595
Speaker 1: Yes.

716
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,800
Speaker 1: It's not a thing to debate.

717
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,980
Speaker 0: And when we were younger, it was a thing to debate.

718
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,480
Speaker 0: We were also younger.

719
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:45,419
Speaker 0: And what I said, this is what I'm getting at.

720
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:48,620
Speaker 0: There's a time in every young, all you 20 year olds can go into.

721
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:58,660
Speaker 0: There's a time in every young person's life where they're going to watch a show like this and they're going to spend months debating with each other about the finer points of, well, what's the scissor used for now?

722
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,140
Speaker 0: Could they synthesize life fibers from Ryuko?

723
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,920
Speaker 0: Could that be the future of humanity?

724
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,380
Speaker 0: Could young Katsu have been reasoned with?

725
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:07,940
Speaker 1: Why does everyone wear normal clothes?

726
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,100
Speaker 1: Everyone should just be naked now because.

727
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,615
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

728
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:10,292
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

729
00:33:10,601 --> 00:33:13,800
Speaker 1: Did Nudist Beach fail because not everyone's just naked all the time?

730
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,380
Speaker 0: But much like Eva, the literal plot was awesome, but was not the whole story.

731
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
Speaker 0: Not the important part.

732
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:28,279
Speaker 0: The important part was this is a story about a lot of really interesting characters who did a lot of really interesting and sometimes surprising things.

733
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a lot of shows.

734
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:33,360
Speaker 1: They have like one core message and then like some supporting messages.

735
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,900
Speaker 1: This show was more like three or four equally emphasized messages all side by side, right?

736
00:33:39,342 --> 00:33:43,960
Speaker 1: The message about clothing, the message about, you know, having crazy friends.

737
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,520
Speaker 0: The messages about if you have a goal, how much are you willing to sacrifice for that goal?

738
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,240
Speaker 1: The message, the obvious comparisons to society.

739
00:33:53,303 --> 00:33:53,470
Speaker 1: Right.

740
00:33:53,900 --> 00:34:02,960
Speaker 1: The, you know, my favorite episode, the one where they get all fancy and crazy rich by participating in the fights and then come falling right back down because it's horrible being rich.

741
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,640
Speaker 0: That one being the most ham-fisted.

742
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:06,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I like that episode.

743
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,799
Speaker 1: Some of my favorite episodes.

744
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,675
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong.

745
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:09,498
Speaker 0: I enjoy a big old fist ham.

746
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,540
Speaker 0: The somewhat more disturbing elements about that.

747
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:22,159
Speaker 0: This is a story about basically someone who was abused and raped by her mother repeatedly and put up with it in order to then murder her mother.

748
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,760
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of whole talk about family in general.

749
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,678
Speaker 0: We'll get into that bit.

750
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, no, these crazy people are my real family.

751
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:29,853
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

752
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:36,299
Speaker 0: It had morals about not using violence and it had equally strong morals about sometimes violence is the only way.

753
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:37,757
Speaker 1: Don't lose it.

754
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:38,300
Speaker 0: Yes.

755
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,659
Speaker 0: Don't lose your violent ways.

756
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,940
Speaker 1: It makes her the best entertainment for violence.

757
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,437
Speaker 0: I pretty much pegged that Satsuki was going to betray her mom and try to murder her.

758
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:49,399
Speaker 1: A million episodes early.

759
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,300
Speaker 1: I mean, but really that's, you know, like I was saying before, how the ending was sort of like, you know, sort of plateau.

760
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,079
Speaker 1: That was the turn when they actually teamed up.

761
00:34:58,441 --> 00:35:02,220
Speaker 1: Like that was basically the beginning of the end and it plateaued from there.

762
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,499
Speaker 0: However, that moment.

763
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,340
Speaker 1: That was like the last crazy climactic thing to happen.

764
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,140
Speaker 1: We have teamed up now.

765
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,459
Speaker 1: We will now end the show for you.

766
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:17,940
Speaker 0: When they fully teamed up and then you get that shot with Zenny and he goes all like Gundam dramatic as the ship sails off.

767
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:18,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

768
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,719
Speaker 0: That was one of my favorite scenes in the whole show.

769
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:21,757
Speaker 1: Money guy.

770
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:22,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

771
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,280
Speaker 0: I love that guy.

772
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,360
Speaker 1: Crazy distant side characters coming back and mattering.

773
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,540
Speaker 0: Well, cause he got the watercolor flash at the end.

774
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,839
Speaker 0: I love that watercolor flash.

775
00:35:30,781 --> 00:35:36,897
Speaker 0: That, that is a, that is the, the, that is the moment in old shows where you go, ah, shit, son.

776
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:39,284
Speaker 0: How's it like that?

777
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,760
Speaker 0: pictures that were made of him and then it's like on a laptop covered in pieces of paper that say Bitcoin.

778
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:47,760
Speaker 0: That just makes me giggle.

779
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,160
Speaker 1: That guy would definitely have all the Bitcoins in the real world.

780
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,900
Speaker 0: But I really liked the characters and it's, it's mostly about characters.

781
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
Speaker 0: It is, but the plot was straightforward, sensical, complex enough to be interesting, but you're right.

782
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:11,480
Speaker 0: It did kind of plateau because after that moment, the final fight was literally just a series of escalations that ended in a conversation and a suicide.

783
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:11,950
Speaker 1: Yep.

784
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,240
Speaker 1: It was just like, all right, we have teamed up now.

785
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,739
Speaker 1: We will now fight everything we have to fight until it's over.

786
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:23,620
Speaker 1: And it was almost video game ish and like, you know, beating the mini bosses, being the final boss, being the second form of the final boss.

787
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,120
Speaker 0: Right.

788
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,680
Speaker 0: Marco coming back.

789
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:30,400
Speaker 1: It's like the didn't, the plot didn't really twist or turn or evolve after that, you know, moment.

790
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,058
Speaker 1: It was pretty much just, you know, let's, all right, we have, we have now resolved and now we will fight to the finish.

791
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,084
Speaker 0: The show did a couple of those false pull at the heartstrings that a couple other shows have done.

792
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:43,177
Speaker 0: that kind of annoyed me.

793
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:45,500
Speaker 0: Like, Gamagori's dead.

794
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,279
Speaker 0: Oh, no, he's not.

795
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:47,499
Speaker 0: No, no, he's not.

796
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,378
Speaker 0: We just did that.

797
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:48,840
Speaker 0: Fuck.

798
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,399
Speaker 1: I was actually disappointed that none, you know, they didn't really murder a whole bunch of good characters.

799
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:59,720
Speaker 0: Uh, I, I kind of expected one more character who I liked to be killed.

800
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,880
Speaker 1: I mean, they could have done, I was even expecting them to do something funny.

801
00:37:03,001 --> 00:37:05,759
Speaker 1: Like maybe guts gets killed and they have a little doggy funeral.

802
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,299
Speaker 0: That would have been really sad.

803
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,457
Speaker 1: Just something like that.

804
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:16,376
Speaker 0: You know, I was actually kind of surprised by the manner of Senketsu death by the, by that point, I assumed he made it.

805
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:26,057
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I sort of assumed in advance that like, if they're going to kill all the life fibers, like Senketsu, Junketsu, right?

806
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,420
Speaker 1: Those are all, you know, anything that was involving life fibers, right?

807
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,260
Speaker 1: Including Ryuko, I figured was toast, right?

808
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,200
Speaker 0: They might've been able to make it.

809
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,880
Speaker 0: Senketsu might've made it if they just headed back a little earlier.

810
00:37:37,127 --> 00:37:37,215
Speaker 1: Yeah.

811
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:47,199
Speaker 1: I assumed, you know, when they were fighting the giant, you know, the one original life fiber, I'm like, oh, I guess the only things that will die at the end of the show for sure are things that have life fibers in them.

812
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:56,039
Speaker 1: So all the, all the uniforms and all the people who are half life fiber and all the just life fiber monsters are all dead because good guys are going to win and we're going to make bad guys win.

813
00:37:56,104 --> 00:37:56,213
Speaker 0: Yup.

814
00:37:56,602 --> 00:37:56,731
Speaker 1: Right.

815
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,638
Speaker 0: And that would have been an interesting thing.

816
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,285
Speaker 1: That was 99% correct.

817
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:10,240
Speaker 0: Though I kind of, did you notice how all the shots of the outside, basically other than the area around this school, everyone's just totally normal lives.

818
00:38:10,903 --> 00:38:13,240
Speaker 0: Like only that area was post-apocalyptic.

819
00:38:13,384 --> 00:38:13,736
Speaker 0: Yeah.

820
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,459
Speaker 1: It's very like, they would always show the map.

821
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,440
Speaker 1: Like life fibers have taken over the whole world.

822
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,659
Speaker 1: They've covered the whole world.

823
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,139
Speaker 0: But then it's like some dude like, what's that up there in the sky?

824
00:38:22,865 --> 00:38:23,999
Speaker 0: I was having coffee.

825
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,460
Speaker 1: Only these tiny area of Japan did anything actually matter in the whole world.

827
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,140
Speaker 1: Right.

828
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,579
Speaker 1: But it affected the whole world.

829
00:38:31,761 --> 00:38:35,220
Speaker 0: Aliens from space always land in Tokyo near this particular school.

830
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:42,439
Speaker 1: This particular public school with like a few hundred students is where all the earth dominating space aliens will come to fight.

831
00:38:43,803 --> 00:38:45,139
Speaker 1: They just know where the good guys are.

832
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,900
Speaker 1: I mean, messenger Z, all the bad robots always come near where he launches from.

833
00:38:50,468 --> 00:38:50,700
Speaker 1: Right.

834
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:51,112
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:51,739
Speaker 0: That is true.

836
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,460
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, the only thing that handles this properly.

837
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,318
Speaker 1: Well, Ava kind of.

838
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,299
Speaker 0: Ava handles it very well.

839
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,960
Speaker 0: It lampshades us directly with, oh, they're actually trying to get into your bullshit.

840
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:01,560
Speaker 1: That's true.

841
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:07,500
Speaker 1: But I'm saying in terms of alien invaders are actually going everywhere on earth and you have to stop them everywhere on earth.

842
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,100
Speaker 1: There's only one thing I can think of that.

843
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,624
Speaker 0: That's the one.

844
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:10,329
Speaker 1: that's the one.

845
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,419
Speaker 0: You know what the moral of XCOM was?

846
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,379
Speaker 0: The original XCOM.

847
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:15,458
Speaker 1: Earth is big.

848
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,040
Speaker 0: The secondary moral was poor countries don't get defense.

849
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,780
Speaker 1: That's right.

850
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:23,053
Speaker 0: I had a base in Europe and I had a base in the US.

851
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:24,379
Speaker 0: and fuck everybody else.

852
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,420
Speaker 1: And if I get a third base, maybe China or Japan.

853
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's done.

854
00:39:29,823 --> 00:39:32,139
Speaker 0: I don't think I ever, ever put a base in Africa.

855
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:32,920
Speaker 0: Nope.

856
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,680
Speaker 0: I hid one in Antarctica once just so I could launch interceptors from up there.

857
00:39:37,862 --> 00:39:39,140
Speaker 1: Well, you know, the old ones are down there.

858
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:39,658
Speaker 1: You got to watch out.

859
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,019
Speaker 1: Those are, I mean, seriously, you can't just let them set a base down there.

860
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:53,800
Speaker 0: The show also had enough false notes as in there were themes that didn't end up going anywhere or they lead you in a direction like a red herring.

861
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,920
Speaker 0: But then that wasn't the plot to where you couldn't predict the full details of the show.

862
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,740
Speaker 0: Like you could say a Gundam seed, right?

863
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,819
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, this nudist beach.

864
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,698
Speaker 1: What's up with them?

865
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:05,860
Speaker 1: Oh, what's up with?

866
00:40:06,183 --> 00:40:06,999
Speaker 1: Oh, what's up with them?

867
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,979
Speaker 1: And then you finally, you know, it takes like three or four things before you learn the full truth of nudist beach.

868
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:15,379
Speaker 0: Like I had a gist that Satsuki was going to turn on her mom.

869
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:21,420
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure that everyone else around her knew that was the plan.

870
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:21,860
Speaker 1: Yeah.

871
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,319
Speaker 1: And it's like you didn't know the whole truth of it.

872
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,740
Speaker 1: Like, oh, the whole school was just to strengthen everyone up to fight the mom.

873
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,680
Speaker 0: But specifically to strengthen them to be able to resist the control of life fiber.

874
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,260
Speaker 0: so they could then use them Lena inverse style casting the spells of the ancient evil gods.

875
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:39,760
Speaker 1: Yep.

876
00:40:40,702 --> 00:40:41,800
Speaker 0: Like those details.

877
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:42,905
Speaker 1: It's like you knew it's like.

878
00:40:43,086 --> 00:40:46,960
Speaker 1: anyway, you could pretty easily predict and see where the show was going generally.

879
00:40:47,482 --> 00:40:50,955
Speaker 1: But the details like that were, you know, not like.

880
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:57,720
Speaker 0: I was obsessed the whole show with the fact that it was Senketsu life fiber synchronized junketsu life fiber override.

881
00:40:58,342 --> 00:41:01,660
Speaker 0: And they did set it up that Matoi would talk to Senketsu.

882
00:41:01,742 --> 00:41:02,520
Speaker 0: They had a thing going.

883
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:05,400
Speaker 0: Satsuki would just would just dominate junketsu.

884
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,399
Speaker 0: And occasionally that didn't work out so well.

885
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:07,668
Speaker 0: Yep.

886
00:41:08,401 --> 00:41:12,700
Speaker 0: That's why I was so sure that that was going to be a thing and it ended up being a thing.

887
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:14,820
Speaker 0: But it was not the thing I thought it would be.

888
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,440
Speaker 1: And it was a thing that only mattered like a little bit for a while.

889
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,980
Speaker 1: And then that plot was sort of wrapped up and done.

890
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:27,560
Speaker 0: But I love when they show it like restrained Eva style in that case and they're messing with it and how they basically couldn't control it.

891
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:29,339
Speaker 0: And they just put like Matoi's blood in there.

892
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was for sure.

893
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:35,340
Speaker 1: Like the first thing they give you in the show is it's like, don't go too crazy.

894
00:41:35,681 --> 00:41:37,380
Speaker 1: We'll just drink all your blood and you'll be dead.

895
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,629
Speaker 1: Right.

896
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,439
Speaker 1: And that was emphasized early on.

897
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:41,520
Speaker 1: And it comes up a little bit later on.

898
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,160
Speaker 1: And I was so sure right from episode one or Mike.

899
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:52,660
Speaker 1: Well, towards the end of the show, at some point, if not at the end, someone is just going to die from having all their blood sucked out by their life fiber uniform.

900
00:41:53,243 --> 00:41:54,258
Speaker 1: And it didn't happen.

901
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,320
Speaker 0: See, I made a much more specific prediction.

902
00:41:56,581 --> 00:42:05,059
Speaker 0: I thought that someone was going to die and their blood was going to fuel someone else's uniform to strike the final blow.

903
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,359
Speaker 0: I thought either Ryuko or Satsuki was going to die and their blood was going to save the other one.

904
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,769
Speaker 0: That's a very specific prediction.

905
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:20,439
Speaker 1: that or at the very least, somebody's like, you know, uniform would like untransformed because they were out of blood and then they get killed right by by fighting.

906
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:27,500
Speaker 0: Though also, you know, the fact that I did not expect Ryuko to be life fibers.

907
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.

908
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,320
Speaker 0: But then in retrospect, looking at the show again, yeah, she survived a lot of things that clearly killed other people.

909
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:36,500
Speaker 1: I mean, she was a badass, right?

910
00:42:36,881 --> 00:42:42,340
Speaker 1: From the very beginning, she shows up and she's fighting without any special, any no uniform or anything.

911
00:42:42,742 --> 00:42:45,299
Speaker 1: And it's just like, oh, she's just a really badass fighter.

912
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,591
Speaker 1: Yeah.

913
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,280
Speaker 1: Because she and they didn't explain to you how she got that.

914
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,220
Speaker 0: But then they would show you like other people who are kind of badasses die.

915
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:53,127
Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:54,079
Speaker 0: Like what's his name?

917
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:54,839
Speaker 0: We stole the uniform.

918
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,960
Speaker 0: They just fucking killed him.

919
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,640
Speaker 1: He wasn't a badass.

920
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,359
Speaker 1: He was some high school punk.

921
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he was still moderately badass because he could wear the Goku uniform.

922
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,619
Speaker 1: With a one star.

923
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:03,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

924
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:07,159
Speaker 1: Everyone at the school was wearing one stars pretty much.

925
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,999
Speaker 0: No, the vast majority of them were no stars.

926
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,679
Speaker 1: The no stars didn't really make it.

927
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,939
Speaker 0: How many people died in the no late day?

928
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:15,460
Speaker 0: That's my question.

929
00:43:17,063 --> 00:43:18,098
Speaker 0: That's what I want to find out.

930
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good question.

931
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,820
Speaker 1: How many people died in the Osaka battle?

932
00:43:22,222 --> 00:43:22,800
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

933
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,699
Speaker 1: It's probably got the highest kill count at all.

934
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:28,667
Speaker 0: But this show was that.

935
00:43:28,787 --> 00:43:39,519
Speaker 0: that is my main point that this show did enough interesting things in a complex enough manner to where you couldn't just watch the opener and predict every beat of the show along to the end.

936
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:40,560
Speaker 0: You could only predict.

937
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,731
Speaker 0: But yet everything was self-consistent.

938
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:45,780
Speaker 0: going back and watching it again.

939
00:43:46,284 --> 00:43:48,120
Speaker 0: All those things make perfect sense.

940
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:49,520
Speaker 0: Nothing comes out of nowhere.

941
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing.

942
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:52,979
Speaker 1: there's nothing in the show where you're like, oh, giant given plot hole.

943
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,120
Speaker 1: This show's garbage, poorly written, right?

944
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:59,796
Speaker 1: And it's just, you know, the show just had all these aspects that make it really fun to watch.

945
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,137
Speaker 1: It pumps you the fuck up.

946
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:01,531
Speaker 0: Yep.

947
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,120
Speaker 0: The leitmotifs of the characters that don't lose your way song.

948
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,460
Speaker 0: Right.

949
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,600
Speaker 0: That is like the music in the first level of Doom one.

950
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:10,899
Speaker 0: That's like the music in tribes, too.

951
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,920
Speaker 1: There's a lot of bad animations, but also good animations.

952
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,019
Speaker 1: Which they've corrected.

953
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bad ones are getting fixed.

954
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,740
Speaker 1: So if you watch it now, it's probably really good.

955
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,339
Speaker 0: Though it's telling, it takes repeated watchings usually to notice the really bad animation mistakes.

956
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, they rushed it out for TV South Park style and then they fixed it later.

957
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:27,750
Speaker 0: Yep.

958
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:35,019
Speaker 1: So, you know, there's plenty of good animations, plenty of references to the old animes to excite the nerds when they see them.

959
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:35,998
Speaker 0: So many references.

960
00:44:36,401 --> 00:44:37,058
Speaker 1: All the references.

961
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,380
Speaker 0: Like some of them were so like there was a point in one of the episodes where the those various people are sewing uniforms.

962
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,740
Speaker 0: And it was, I want to go find the exact episode of Sailor Moon that this was ripping off.

963
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,820
Speaker 0: Like to the point that I think the background was the same.

964
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:54,240
Speaker 1: Right.

965
00:44:54,684 --> 00:44:55,919
Speaker 1: It's got comedies.

966
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,459
Speaker 1: It's got, you know.

967
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,740
Speaker 0: And the comedy, you know what, was funny.

968
00:45:00,382 --> 00:45:03,180
Speaker 0: Which is not super common in a lot of anime.

969
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,240
Speaker 0: Like a lot of anime are funny, but I don't laugh out loud.

970
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,240
Speaker 0: But I actually laughed out loud unexpectedly a couple of times in this show.

971
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:12,960
Speaker 1: It's got, you know, it's got pretty much everything.

972
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,460
Speaker 1: It's got some highbrow.

973
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,378
Speaker 1: It's got some lowbrow.

974
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:17,020
Speaker 1: It's got some action scenes.

975
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,100
Speaker 1: It's got some romance scenes.

976
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:21,820
Speaker 1: It's got, you know, it's got animes for everything.

977
00:45:22,361 --> 00:45:24,099
Speaker 1: Every aspect of anime is in the show.

978
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,078
Speaker 0: What is not in this show?

979
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,519
Speaker 1: It does not.

980
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,539
Speaker 1: Actual porn.

981
00:45:29,861 --> 00:45:30,459
Speaker 1: It gets close.

982
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:30,780
Speaker 0: Yep.

983
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,879
Speaker 0: So there's no actual porn.

984
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,460
Speaker 0: And even then to be to be significantly titillated by the show, you've got to be the kind of person.

985
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:40,500
Speaker 1: It's like people are getting naked left and right.

986
00:45:40,982 --> 00:45:42,859
Speaker 1: And they're doing sexy things left and right.

987
00:45:43,201 --> 00:45:47,100
Speaker 1: But if it actually turns you on to watch the show, that's weird, dude.

988
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,119
Speaker 0: Well, other than what about the little romance scenes?

989
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,919
Speaker 0: Like from Mako's like, oh, I like her.

990
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,880
Speaker 1: But you're getting actually turned on by that for reals.

991
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:54,516
Speaker 1: Like, oh, baby.

992
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,179
Speaker 0: Well, turned on is not a switch.

993
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,019
Speaker 0: It's not binary.

994
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,954
Speaker 0: It's not like you were either 100% turned on or not.

995
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,180
Speaker 1: You're not faffing to that, right?

996
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,076
Speaker 0: Someone is.

997
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,580
Speaker 1: That's a bad dude.

998
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:04,580
Speaker 0: Someone's faffing everything.

999
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:04,859
Speaker 1: You know what?

1000
00:46:04,941 --> 00:46:05,398
Speaker 1: It's a dude.

1001
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,497
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna lie.

1002
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,259
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1003
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:14,298
Speaker 0: The show does have elements of sexual tension that I could see driving a certain kind of person in a certain way.

1004
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,880
Speaker 1: But I don't think they're faffing to the show directly.

1005
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:25,499
Speaker 0: Like we said in one of our panels at Anime Boston, you can tell a lot about your friend by how they recommend Kill La Kill to you.

1006
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:31,840
Speaker 0: If they talk about the fact that it involves nakedness, they're probably a bad person.

1007
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:38,359
Speaker 0: If they talk about how over the top and awesome it is, and they mentioned going a guy, they're probably an awesome person.

1008
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:40,980
Speaker 1: You should still watch it anyway, right?

1009
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,258
Speaker 1: Just watch it for the right reasons.

1010
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,197
Speaker 1: Why would you not watch this?

1011
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:46,900
Speaker 1: What else are you possibly watching?

1012
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,860
Speaker 0: The thing is, this show is going to be important for anime.

1013
00:46:51,485 --> 00:46:52,559
Speaker 0: I honestly believe that.

1014
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,020
Speaker 1: This will not be a show that, like, I can already feel Attack on Titan sort of disappearing.

1015
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,680
Speaker 0: Well duh, because Attack on Titan is just Full Metal Alchemist 2 Electric Boogaloo.

1016
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,238
Speaker 1: I think when they make more anime of Attack on Titan, if they do, they probably will, right?

1017
00:47:06,603 --> 00:47:08,339
Speaker 1: Then it'll come, it'll rise again.

1018
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,079
Speaker 1: Oh, it'll explode.

1019
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,260
Speaker 1: Much like Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood made it rise again.

1020
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:12,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then it'll fall again.

1021
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,420
Speaker 1: Kill La Kill, there's not gonna be any more Kill La Kill ever.

1022
00:47:15,241 --> 00:47:18,000
Speaker 1: But, oh, isn't there gonna be like one OAV or something?

1023
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,659
Speaker 0: Supposedly there's going to be an OAV.

1024
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,900
Speaker 1: There's not gonna be any significant Kill La Kill ever again, right?

1025
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,680
Speaker 0: Which is, because they could very easily make a sequel.

1026
00:47:26,841 --> 00:47:27,719
Speaker 0: Sure, if they wanted to.

1027
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:28,919
Speaker 1: I don't know what it'd be about, but they could.

1028
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like Cowboy Bebop, I mean.

1029
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,560
Speaker 1: More shows, same characters.

1030
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,620
Speaker 0: Cowgirl at 9.

1031
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,179
Speaker 0: I would watch, if they've had a hundred more episodes of just these characters, I would probably watch it.

1032
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,019
Speaker 0: But at the same time, I don't want them to do that.

1033
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,311
Speaker 1: Kill La Kill Fumafu, right?

1034
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,959
Speaker 1: But this show, I don't think, you know, it still hasn't been a long time, so I don't know for sure.

1035
00:47:47,362 --> 00:47:49,680
Speaker 1: But I would bet it will not disappear completely.

1036
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,078
Speaker 1: Many moons from now, it will still be mentioned and remembered and talked about.

1037
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:55,160
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1038
00:47:55,941 --> 00:48:05,640
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll be on the, you know, the A level with the Evangelion changing all anime history, but it'll be, you know, a step or two under that.

1039
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:12,640
Speaker 0: It's very rare that I'll say something like that about an anime within the first decade of it having been in existence.

1040
00:48:14,907 --> 00:48:15,500
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

1041
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:21,599
Speaker 0: And yeah, if you're mad right now about us talking about your precious Attack on Titan, seriously, I like Attack on Titan a lot.

1042
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,260
Speaker 0: It's Full Metal Alchemist.

1043
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,577
Speaker 0: It's time will pass.

1044
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:31,120
Speaker 0: In fact, it's time is actually passing pretty rapidly unless they get an OAV or something out stat.

1045
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:33,420
Speaker 0: Though the cosplay is rising.

1046
00:48:33,941 --> 00:48:41,620
Speaker 0: I saw way more like Kill la Kill busted onto the cosplay scene in a huge way for obvious reasons.

1047
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,978
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a show about clothes.

1048
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:44,420
Speaker 1: It's a show about clothes.

1049
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,500
Speaker 1: It was made for cosplay.

1050
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,900
Speaker 0: I mean, the second opener just has all those, like all their costumes cycling.

1051
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,799
Speaker 1: And then whenever they introduce a new costume, they change the opener to add that new costume to the rotation.

1052
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,335
Speaker 0: Yep.

1053
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,079
Speaker 0: Actually, too, look at the second opener thinking back on it.

1054
00:49:00,664 --> 00:49:02,100
Speaker 0: It does the Gundam seed thing.

1055
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:03,220
Speaker 0: It tells you what's going to happen.

1056
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:12,240
Speaker 0: You notice how you see Matoi and her people on one ramp, one lane, and then on the other lane of that fashion stage, you see Satsuki and her people.

1057
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,180
Speaker 0: They both have their group of crazy people.

1058
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,420
Speaker 0: They get to the same goal through different means, looking at each other the whole time, walking along the way, and then cut each other up with swords.

1059
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,300
Speaker 0: Well, fight with each other, but spray blood all over the place.

1060
00:49:25,042 --> 00:49:27,760
Speaker 0: Then after they fight, it does the same thing in Gundam.

1061
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:42,297
Speaker 0: Remember in Gundam seed, there was a point where two characters slide in from the side with guns pointed at each other, and then when the opener updates mid-season, they slide in from the side, they keep going, same poses, now they're back to back, and that's the episode where they join up.

1062
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,580
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1063
