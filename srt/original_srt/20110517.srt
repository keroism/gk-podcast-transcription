1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,447
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, May 17th.

2
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:11,109
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,421
Speaker 0: I'm sky and this is geek nights tonight in the year 2011.

4
00:00:14,421 --> 00:00:16,559
Speaker 0: We talked about the game diplomacy from.

5
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,127
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:31,627
Speaker 0: All in all I'm very happy with my real phone as opposed to my free.

7
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:32,450
Speaker 0: They really couldn't do anything.

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,290
Speaker 1: Well, you know the pre had a nice interface.

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,738
Speaker 1: It was a good size has a better interface than either droid or iPhone by and you know when they first announced it I was like, oh shit.

10
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,050
Speaker 1: Look at this real competition.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,190
Speaker 1: It was pretty excited and most I would have got if it had gone the wet, you know, it had fulfilled its potential.

12
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:53,824
Speaker 1: I probably would have been interested in generation to.

13
00:00:54,086 --> 00:01:00,284
Speaker 0: most of the problems I had with it came down to the fact that it was you know Two-year-old hardware and there was no like like.

14
00:01:00,304 --> 00:01:01,550
Speaker 0: there were never any updates for you.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,710
Speaker 1: And I really liked how it integrated all the instant messaging and the text messaging together.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,716
Speaker 1: Yeah, droid doesn't all the email together.

17
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:14,178
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but one of the things like it was functional as a smartphone Except for Google Maps.

18
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:16,310
Speaker 0: because Google Maps it didn't have the new vector version.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:21,989
Speaker 0: So basically if you didn't have great internet wherever you were it just wouldn't load Google Maps at all.

20
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,857
Speaker 0: But one thing that I'd overlooked.

21
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:30,232
Speaker 0: I didn't really think about games on the phone because the pre had no games None.

22
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:35,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's actually games on droid and I actually played a couple of games.

23
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:39,330
Speaker 0: And all I have to say is Angry Birds is mildly entertaining.

24
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:42,283
Speaker 0: It is a three out of five flash game at best.

25
00:01:42,464 --> 00:01:43,910
Speaker 1: That's you know, that's sort of the point, right?

26
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,166
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get any games on your phone that are gonna be like, oh my god.

27
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:49,070
Speaker 1: This game is amazing.

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,183
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but what's what amazes me?

29
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:52,310
Speaker 0: I guess it doesn't amaze me.

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:02:04,070
Speaker 0: I should expect this but it interests me that of all the Similar level of flash game out there all the similar level of game you can make on a phone Angry Birds is the one that has such like cultural cachet.

31
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,558
Speaker 0: The reason is because the birds are cute.

32
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:09,247
Speaker 0: it's a dollar and then it was the free version.

33
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:12,675
Speaker 1: the birds are cute and It has fun noises.

34
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:19,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bird and the noises they make are pretty good and it's you know, I mean like hey You know, I agree three out of five is pretty much what I would give it.

35
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,813
Speaker 1: But you know what?

36
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:20,599
Speaker 1: I beat the whole thing.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,290
Speaker 1: I even bought Angry Birds seasons.

38
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:32,609
Speaker 1: I paid two dollars to get every Angry Bird there is because you know It's not like I'm sitting there at home playing Angry Birds if I'm standing on the subway, you know Do look out the window.

39
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:41,410
Speaker 0: Based on total enjoyment over like over time like average unit enjoyment per unit time.

40
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:45,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can also rate them in total enjoyment overall.

41
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:47,505
Speaker 0: Because look at a game like QWOP.

42
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:53,547
Speaker 0: QWOP cannot be played for more than about a minute or two, that's pretty much it.

43
00:02:53,808 --> 00:02:58,803
Speaker 0: but QWOP that minute or two was solid goddamn gold.

44
00:02:58,843 --> 00:03:00,668
Speaker 0: primarily because there are other people watching.

45
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:01,330
Speaker 0: you try to play.

46
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:04,803
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah, you know, there's all these cell phone games.

47
00:03:04,864 --> 00:03:06,370
Speaker 1: mostly, you know, I got quite a few of them.

48
00:03:06,752 --> 00:03:09,909
Speaker 1: They're pretty much mild entertainment that you know.

49
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,650
Speaker 1: The only reason that it's beneficial in any way is because you can play it very quickly.

50
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:27,034
Speaker 1: There's a lot of great DS games, you know, but the problem with DS games, you know It's their real games is that they're real games Which means you usually can't play them like in five minutes on the subway, you know You need like.

51
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:27,415
Speaker 1: I'll play.

52
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:32,430
Speaker 1: I play my DS primarily when I'm about to go to sleep and not when I'm on the subway.

53
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,420
Speaker 0: That's when I typically play Advance Wars every day.

54
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:38,378
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know, it's like, okay I read books or I'm about.

55
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:41,370
Speaker 1: I'm you know, I'm gonna play DS and then read a book or vice versa.

56
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:43,280
Speaker 1: You know cuz I'm laying in bed.

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,809
Speaker 1: I don't have a TV in front of me.

58
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:48,885
Speaker 1: That's when the DS comes in because it provides that middle ground of gaming.

59
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,517
Speaker 1: but you know game on the phone It's because you have your phone no matter what.

60
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:57,060
Speaker 1: sometimes you're stuck somewhere a waiting room Something and you just wanna.

61
00:03:57,663 --> 00:03:59,170
Speaker 1: you can't really do anything productive.

62
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:03,864
Speaker 1: So at least occupy your mind with the blackbird dinner.

63
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:07,595
Speaker 0: Well, you can't just sit and think I Already did my sit and thinking.

64
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:08,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

65
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:13,498
Speaker 1: I also sit and think while playing, you know Plus some of the you know, there are some games you can get.

66
00:04:13,518 --> 00:04:16,570
Speaker 1: there was like when I first played bejeweled blitz on the phone.

67
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:21,889
Speaker 1: I really said all this is a game of randomness is basically if you get a really easy board You're gonna get a high score.

68
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:26,030
Speaker 1: But then week after week I noticed that other people are getting half a million and I never got half.

69
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,606
Speaker 1: And I was like there's more to this game.

70
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:31,595
Speaker 1: So I looked online At some but you'll wait.

71
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:32,478
Speaker 0: Wait, so it wasn't.

72
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,305
Speaker 0: so I tried to get better at the game.

73
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:34,707
Speaker 0: It was.

74
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:35,590
Speaker 0: I looked online.

75
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:39,250
Speaker 1: So I looked online at what people are doing in bejeweled blitz.

76
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:43,220
Speaker 1: It is there is some advanced fucking play in bejeweled blitz.

77
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:45,687
Speaker 1: Let me tell you I could see that it is like.

78
00:04:45,727 --> 00:04:51,076
Speaker 1: I thought I Wrongly judged the game thinking it was a game of luck Just getting an easy board.

79
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:53,626
Speaker 1: that would give you a high score and there is some of that right.

80
00:04:53,646 --> 00:05:05,050
Speaker 1: if you get an easy board You're gonna get a higher score no matter how good you are, you know, yeah, but At the same time, you know, there are someone who's good is gonna get us, you know consistently higher score.

81
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:11,017
Speaker 1: There's significant speed factor going on, you know, if you can go fast You can get a high score on.

82
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:13,345
Speaker 1: you know, every time no matter what the board is.

83
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:22,250
Speaker 0: So we did Recently go to the no quarter exhibit the second of two in New York at the NYU gaming center.

84
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:23,174
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

85
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:26,510
Speaker 1: it was small than I expected but you know, it was worth the trip over there.

86
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,294
Speaker 0: I mean it was neat to see.

87
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:28,683
Speaker 0: it was kind of like a series of exhibits.

88
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,870
Speaker 0: They had one really good game.

89
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,920
Speaker 0: It was basically this kind of ultra simplistic like in the style that we've been liking lately that we may or may not be doing A pax panel on that sort of game.

90
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:42,781
Speaker 0: Yep, or at least aspects of games like that Reminded me of you ever play American gladiators today.

91
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:45,750
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that was actually a pretty damn good game.

92
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:46,819
Speaker 1: Well, it's parts of it.

93
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,009
Speaker 1: But yeah, the wall was hot.

94
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,822
Speaker 1: But you remember the one where you go?

95
00:05:49,963 --> 00:05:50,890
Speaker 1: you're in the safe zone.

96
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,530
Speaker 1: You can get a. you get a ball in the safe zone and have to run into the danger zone where the gladiators are And put the ball in the baskets.

97
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was sort of like that only maybe reversed.

98
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,090
Speaker 1: ish this one ball and you have to hold the ball in the goal zone.

99
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,475
Speaker 0: You know what?

100
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:07,752
Speaker 0: It was a lot like soccer for the Atari 2600.

101
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:09,659
Speaker 0: I didn't play that.

102
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:10,823
Speaker 0: really I've got it over there.

103
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:11,927
Speaker 1: No, let's go try it.

104
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:12,570
Speaker 0: It's a lot like it.

105
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,510
Speaker 0: Let's try it not as fun as Wizards of War or outlaw.

106
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:18,115
Speaker 0: Yeah The only.

107
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:19,263
Speaker 0: it's kind of a decide.

108
00:06:19,284 --> 00:06:25,518
Speaker 0: the NYU Game Center I think is a great thing and clearly the people who are involved in it Really know their stuff and really enjoy being there.

109
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:29,650
Speaker 0: But in general I've noticed that there is a. it's not a trend.

110
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:40,904
Speaker 0: This is probably always been this way but being in the city and going to events like this Almost universally an event that provides free food and especially free beer doesn't have much else going on.

111
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:54,669
Speaker 0: I Mean this place was basically so crowded so fast that you could kind of just stand there in the crowd eating and drinking But you couldn't interact with any Game Center people or actually play any of the games.

112
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,850
Speaker 0: I have noticed this that they're you know, they're well like all those startup meetups or tech meetups or hacker meetups in the city.

113
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,356
Speaker 0: They're all the same.

114
00:07:02,376 --> 00:07:07,536
Speaker 1: Well, no, that's why I was see the one that you went to right like that Like NY hacker.

115
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:09,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are all the same thing, right?

116
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:10,850
Speaker 1: But I was going for a time.

117
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:11,275
Speaker 1: I guess it.

118
00:07:11,356 --> 00:07:12,530
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened to it, right?

119
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,032
Speaker 1: It just sort of.

120
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:17,450
Speaker 1: I missed one meeting and then I haven't heard about it since I'll guess I'll subscribe to it.

121
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:26,399
Speaker 1: But hack and tell was actually you have to go and someone who made something gives a you know A five-minute presentation and then another person goes another.

122
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,814
Speaker 1: so they were actually there was something happening at hack and tell which is why I liked It and I kept going to.

123
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,770
Speaker 0: I think what it comes down to is that event had an agenda.

124
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,378
Speaker 0: Yeah Many things do not have agendas and

125
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:52,010
Speaker 1: that's why I did stopped going to the NY hacker Town halls because it was pretty much stand around this free pizza and talk to people and it's like yeah Okay, I can network with people but the thing is I you know What a lot of the people who go to these things will also want to network, you know.

126
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,135
Speaker 1: And what do they have to sell?

127
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,060
Speaker 1: they're trying to hire you.

128
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:56,110
Speaker 1: they're trying to get you to use their product.

129
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,218
Speaker 1: They're trying to sell you on something right?

130
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,110
Speaker 1: It's like all I got to bring here is geek nights.

131
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,950
Speaker 1: It's like hey, you want to listen to geek nights?

132
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,522
Speaker 1: It's like, you know that works.

133
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:11,358
Speaker 1: if I'm given a panel It doesn't really work if you just walk up to someone to talk to them and especially when they're only interested in you know software because

134
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:18,650
Speaker 0: as much as I thought it works pretty well, but Unintentionally because what it ends up getting you is the guys like oh, yeah, you can interview me about my thing.

135
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:31,315
Speaker 1: Yeah but you know the thing is It's as much as we look down and like all these we go to anime cons and we're always confused about how the anime kids Don't care about games or technology The technology people.

136
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:35,890
Speaker 1: they actually do sort of care about video games in a shallow way because they all play them.

137
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they they also.

138
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:44,570
Speaker 1: they care about tech like 90% and they don't care about Any and this is the primary thing of geek nights.

139
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,190
Speaker 1: You should care about all the geekeries from cars to sports to technology.

140
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:54,144
Speaker 0: I would say more that you should have multiple areas of interest.

141
00:08:54,204 --> 00:09:02,739
Speaker 1: Yes many as many as possible You know, even if something is not your area of interest if you see the lot of people are interested in it at least You know, what does it take?

142
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,069
Speaker 1: five minutes while you're bored at work?

143
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,763
Speaker 1: You know to learn the basics of some hobby that you have nothing to do with like.

144
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:12,138
Speaker 1: remember we were at the park and we Saw the people doing like the the mini remote control boats.

145
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:12,881
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

146
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:15,890
Speaker 1: I read a couple web pages about remote control boats.

147
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:23,510
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm gonna get one or that I know enough to talk about it But I read because I was just interested to see what the deal is.

148
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,180
Speaker 0: So what's one interesting thing you learned about?

149
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,609
Speaker 0: remote-controlled boat hobbyists?

150
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,930
Speaker 1: Well bait like the way it steers is there's actually like a little spinning thing.

151
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,527
Speaker 1: It's tied to the string and when you under remote control You basically move the sail back and forth as opposed to like a rudder underneath the water.

152
00:09:38,547 --> 00:09:39,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I knew that.

153
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,858
Speaker 0: That's how those sailboats work.

154
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:49,414
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know that was like, oh I didn't realize But I don't have any advanced knowledge, right I mean, I basically have any.

155
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:53,230
Speaker 1: you know, I know I know but next to nothing but I know more than nothing.

156
00:09:54,354 --> 00:10:02,169
Speaker 1: Which is you know, it's good to know Yeah And then if I meet someone and they happen to be into remote control boating I can have an okay conversation with them.

157
00:10:03,232 --> 00:10:09,990
Speaker 0: So there's not a terrible amount of video game news That's really worth talking about right now and we're kind of in a lull of games being announced.

158
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,168
Speaker 0: 3ds is selling as well as it's gonna sell.

159
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:27,672
Speaker 0: So I kind of want to talk about because we've already talked about Nintendo's future in the 3ds and why we're not buying them Nintendo is transitioned from a buy sight unseen Company for us to a wait-and-see Company.

160
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:33,650
Speaker 1: only thing from Nintendo that I plan to buy is they're gonna come out with the skyward sword for the Wii, right?

161
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:41,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm gonna get that because it's a Zelda game for the Wii But actually I have an expectation that it won't be so great.

162
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:45,727
Speaker 1: I think it'll be less good than was it Twilight Princess.

163
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,910
Speaker 0: Was that the Never even finished Twilight Princess?

164
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:49,492
Speaker 1: It's just.

165
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:56,090
Speaker 1: it's just weird because I know that if you say whenever you had the word Twilight and Prince our goal I just get confused princess.

166
00:10:56,411 --> 00:11:02,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, Celestia and I also get confused with like the vampire thing and Twilight struggle.

167
00:11:03,973 --> 00:11:05,247
Speaker 1: There's too much going on there.

168
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,489
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think it'll be less good than that.

169
00:11:09,952 --> 00:11:19,677
Speaker 0: Well, I'm actually downgrading my expectation of Nintendo in general because you know We talked already about a lot of the reasons why Nintendo's having trouble lately So I don't need to get into all of those.

170
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,490
Speaker 0: but to summarize then I'll call attention to two articles.

171
00:11:23,171 --> 00:11:31,514
Speaker 0: Nintendo for one is really Really stepping up the region slash DRM situation.

172
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,561
Speaker 1: we knew this already when the 3ds came out.

173
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:39,330
Speaker 1: people read the terms of service and it said You know, we can break your 3ds if you like use an r4 or whatever.

174
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:46,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is old people who were calling in Nintendo basically confirmed that no warranty like there's no way back if it gets brick.

175
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,844
Speaker 0: They said yeah, we'll say there might not be a way to recover.

176
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:49,950
Speaker 0: You might have to buy a new one.

177
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they're you know, they're gonna.

178
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,064
Speaker 1: pretty much so.

179
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:55,430
Speaker 1: that's why I'm keeping on glad I got a DS lite not a DS I or anything like that.

180
00:11:55,571 --> 00:12:07,330
Speaker 0: It also turns out according to this article that if you read the terms of service Nintendo pretty much collects and owns the rights to Any user-generated content that is generated with the device.

181
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:10,081
Speaker 1: That's incredible news to me.

182
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,490
Speaker 1: I was not aware at all.

183
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,585
Speaker 1: So that's like if you bought a camera from Nikon and you're a photographer and you take wedding photos.

184
00:12:16,665 --> 00:12:18,230
Speaker 1: Nikon doesn't own those photos.

185
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:18,753
Speaker 0: I mean one.

186
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:25,579
Speaker 0: Nintendo reserves the right to collect all the user content Which they define as comments messages images photos movies information data.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,867
Speaker 1: really all the penises of pictochat now belong to Nintendo.

188
00:12:28,907 --> 00:12:33,239
Speaker 1: Yeah The world's largest database of penis doodles.

189
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:56,067
Speaker 0: that users grant Nintendo a worldwide royalty-free irrevocable perpetual non-exclusive and fully sub license of a license to use reproduce modify adapt publish translate create derivative works from distribute perform and display Your user content in whole or in part and to incorporate your user content into other works in any form media or technology Now known or later developed including other promotional or marketing purposes,

190
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:58,948
Speaker 1: man It's gonna be so great with like some

191
00:12:58,988 --> 00:12:59,832
Speaker 0: parents Nintendo

192
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:05,590
Speaker 1: takes pictures of their kids on the 3ds and then the next thing they know it's you know, human centipod.

193
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:09,377
Speaker 0: when I Think the greatest thing.

194
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:16,649
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a great thing for consumers now Unlike any other time in history the entire world will see my balls.

195
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:20,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I'm going to take pictures of nothing bought my balls.

196
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:35,469
Speaker 0: Yeah But independent of this I was reminded the other day that the 3ds is also region locked which Basically fucks one kind of person people who speak Japanese and English and are actually willing to pay for games.

197
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:49,337
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if you if the DS was any indication Right and actually now that I have an entire library of Game Boy and Game Boy Color and GBA games It's really it's been true since the Game Boy Is that the chip.

198
00:13:49,377 --> 00:13:52,070
Speaker 1: in terms of portable games Japan has all the better games.

199
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:56,327
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, I mean they've had all the better games in the past forever.

200
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:57,130
Speaker 1: Yeah forever.

201
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,138
Speaker 1: There's been tons of awesome games that they've had.

202
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:02,010
Speaker 1: that we have not had but it's actually been decreasing over time.

203
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:06,844
Speaker 1: They've had less cool exclusive Japanese games over time like in the Saturn era.

204
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,309
Speaker 1: They were like there was that one game.

205
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:10,273
Speaker 1: I forget what it was called But I could.

206
00:14:10,393 --> 00:14:12,664
Speaker 1: I could if you had the cover of the game I could tell.

207
00:14:12,905 --> 00:14:23,919
Speaker 0: but at the same time It might be that you're not looking for because I was in book off the other day with Emily Yeah, and I was looking through all the Japanese DS games In the portable realm right?

208
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:24,541
Speaker 1: There's just.

209
00:14:24,901 --> 00:14:28,210
Speaker 1: it was like Game Boy Game Boy Color GBA DS.

210
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,935
Speaker 1: They have all these amazing games.

211
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,059
Speaker 1: We don't have right.

212
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:34,590
Speaker 1: it was even a miracle that we even got the Etrian odysseys over here.

213
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, not that those are that great But still that's what I just I don't get.

214
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:44,461
Speaker 0: why like I really I tried to understand and I've come up with a bunch of Rationalizations, but I can understand why Nintendo's dr.

215
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:49,437
Speaker 0: Emming because you pirate every goddamn game now Yeah, but the thing is none of the.

216
00:14:49,577 --> 00:15:00,818
Speaker 1: I can honestly say none of the games that I have pirated for the DS Right are games that I would have paid for If the piracy was not an option.

217
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:05,688
Speaker 1: and in fact, there are still games that I went out and bought like, you know I went out and bought.

218
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:07,970
Speaker 1: Even after I had the piracy card.

219
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,901
Speaker 1: I still bought games such as Miles Edgeworth investigations.

220
00:15:12,001 --> 00:15:13,666
Speaker 0: What about Golden Sun DS?

221
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:15,110
Speaker 0: What about that might magic game?

222
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,194
Speaker 1: I'm buying that on the 360.

223
00:15:17,194 --> 00:15:19,584
Speaker 1: I never would have bought the DS one.

224
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:19,925
Speaker 1: Really?

225
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:20,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought it.

226
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:21,270
Speaker 0: I played it.

227
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:21,694
Speaker 0: It was great.

228
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:33,930
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy the Xbox one but I just Every rationale I can come up with for why Nintendo is actually for the first time region locking a portable console Doesn't actually make sense.

229
00:15:34,231 --> 00:15:37,243
Speaker 0: If you assume that Nintendo actually wants to achieve the goal that I'm.

230
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:51,093
Speaker 0: assuming they're trying to achieve any goal I come up with it runs counter because the people who want to buy a Japanese game are the only people Who actually will buy a game and if they put DRM on it and prevent, you know They have region locking.

231
00:15:51,755 --> 00:16:03,710
Speaker 1: those people really have two options pirate or not buy or buy two 3ds Japanese one and an English or because just by a Japanese one because isn't any game is gonna be in both.

232
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,069
Speaker 1: So if you can read both languages, what American game do you need?

233
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:10,529
Speaker 0: Ah, but then you run into trouble of trying to lend games to people.

234
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:20,006
Speaker 1: Nintendo has always had a history and actually It's sort of good and sort of bad right ever since the NES even earlier.

235
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,169
Speaker 1: I guess there is nothing earlier.

236
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:22,594
Speaker 1: Game and watch.

237
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:23,457
Speaker 0: Yeah game and watch.

238
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:24,862
Speaker 0: Are there Hanafuda cards?

239
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:32,230
Speaker 1: Nintendo has always always Attempted to make their games impossible to pirate, right?

240
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,216
Speaker 1: That's why the n64 used cartridges and that's why you know The like the GameCube.

241
00:16:38,256 --> 00:16:41,870
Speaker 1: the discs were tiny and on the Wii, I think the disc spin backwards.

242
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,879
Speaker 0: Let's go back in time, but they don't do it.

243
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,904
Speaker 0: Let's go back in time.

244
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:54,345
Speaker 0: Imagine a world Where when Sony and square said hey, we want to use CD Nintendo said hells.

245
00:16:54,366 --> 00:16:58,978
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, if they hadn't failed There would be no PlayStation.

246
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,224
Speaker 1: Nintendo would still be the king.

247
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:01,270
Speaker 1: there might not even be an Xbox.

248
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:02,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, there might not have been an.

249
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:10,430
Speaker 0: I think there would have been an Xbox anyway But I don't think it would have been as big of a success Console the only console game in town to be Nintendo because there would have been no PlayStation.

250
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,419
Speaker 1: It would just been Nintendo Nintendo Nintendo.

251
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:17,878
Speaker 0: It's not like Neo Geo was gonna go anyway But it was an arcade game in your house.

252
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:18,762
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:17:18,944 --> 00:17:20,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

254
00:17:21,112 --> 00:17:28,383
Speaker 0: Of course Nintendo is also right along these lines, you know The cafe project cafe the Wii successor is gonna have HD.

255
00:17:28,604 --> 00:17:30,590
Speaker 0: So I guess they've decided you gotta have that.

256
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to.

257
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:33,225
Speaker 1: now they got that one wrong.

258
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:38,436
Speaker 0: I still say no I think in when the Wii came out it was fine to not have HD Yeah, but that was.

259
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:40,990
Speaker 1: that was true at that exact moment in time.

260
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:52,517
Speaker 1: But what they did not anticipate was that both halfway through the Wii's lifetime It would be unacceptable and which means that you know, it's sort of like, okay when the Wii came out We've life spent.

261
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:54,549
Speaker 0: they'd already sold all the wheeze.

262
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:56,055
Speaker 0: Who care course?

263
00:17:56,155 --> 00:18:00,229
Speaker 0: and the people who bought them after that point are not the people who care about HD.

264
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:03,257
Speaker 0: Those were you know moms who heard about this.

265
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:05,403
Speaker 1: we spot as a result, right?

266
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:06,606
Speaker 1: It's killing.

267
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:18,522
Speaker 1: the lack of HD Caught forced them to not get a bunch of the cross-platform games, right that are on Platform games don't sell well on the Nintendo console.

268
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,590
Speaker 1: Oh, but maybe they would have.

269
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:27,555
Speaker 0: You know, I think one of the only ones that sold better on the Nintendo was a Soulcalibur 2 maybe No, that was the GameCube.

270
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:27,916
Speaker 0: Yeah.

271
00:18:27,936 --> 00:18:28,439
Speaker 0: Thank you.

272
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:31,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on the Wii, I mean what what?

273
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:35,390
Speaker 1: Well, I mean you could have gotten you know Street Fighter on the Wii or you could have gotten, you know.

274
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,003
Speaker 0: But even if the weed been HD, it would have been powerful enough to do the game.

275
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,148
Speaker 1: Anyway, why not?

276
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,390
Speaker 0: Because the Wii wasn't that powerful.

277
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,550
Speaker 1: I'm saying is that if the Wii was HD obviously would have been more power had they made it more powerful.

278
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,214
Speaker 0: It would have been more than $200 It's also true.

279
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:49,218
Speaker 0: and then they're brilliant.

280
00:18:49,258 --> 00:19:00,090
Speaker 0: plan of selling just wheeze and one game would not have succeeded Mmm, but they're not gonna have a hard drive and they're having a relatively small amount of splash space supposedly in project cafe.

281
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,624
Speaker 0: So they're definitely committed to.

282
00:19:02,664 --> 00:19:07,464
Speaker 1: it's all rumors, though You don't know that my true this is but even so that definitely makes a lot of sense.

283
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:08,347
Speaker 0: This is from tatilo.

284
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,643
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, I'll trust him on this.

285
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:17,382
Speaker 0: All right But basically and we'll see what happens at e3 when they you know and you and they're actually going to reveal all this stuff.

286
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:28,407
Speaker 0: but Nintendo is pretty committed to only selling little games and retro games at high prices Online and they're really gonna focus on you buying discs.

287
00:19:28,889 --> 00:19:31,141
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean they've always done that right is they?

288
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,829
Speaker 1: they do everything they can they don't want to do.

289
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,310
Speaker 1: They don't do DRM in the way that Apple does DRM where you encrypt something and have a key.

290
00:19:37,732 --> 00:19:48,010
Speaker 1: They do DRM where they physically make their technology Non-standard so and in and not interoperable to make it physically difficult to pirate the game.

291
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:55,233
Speaker 0: You couldn't on the PlayStation just you know, it was just a CD but you couldn't just copy it Wouldn't work.

292
00:19:55,856 --> 00:19:56,237
Speaker 1: That's true.

293
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:59,170
Speaker 0: You had to mod the PlayStation to play a copy game.

294
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:05,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but I mean it's like, you know, it's much more difficult to do these kinds of things on.

295
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:06,214
Speaker 1: you know The GameCube right?

296
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:09,910
Speaker 1: I mean people to put mod chips in the Wii because you know you we discs.

297
00:20:10,332 --> 00:20:11,538
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you could pirate.

298
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:21,790
Speaker 0: we did games put them on an SD card Be any easier to pirate a game on the Xbox despite slightly more standard media because the Xbox is far more complicated.

299
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:29,602
Speaker 0: it's not like the old days when I took a chip a relatively simple chip that I bought overseas and Soldered it into the breadboard of my PlayStation.

300
00:20:29,803 --> 00:20:38,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way the Xbox Catches you right is that they go the route that Nintendo doesn't go which is a lot more internet control.

301
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:47,456
Speaker 1: the Xbox live you know, so if you start partying things on your Xbox the Xbox live cuts you off and your Xbox is now basically worthless because Online actually works.

302
00:20:47,677 --> 00:20:49,164
Speaker 1: Nintendo doesn't have working online.

303
00:20:49,184 --> 00:20:50,289
Speaker 1: So they can't threaten you with that.

304
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:52,768
Speaker 0: Why don't they have working online?

305
00:20:52,889 --> 00:20:55,984
Speaker 1: Oh Nope they're retarded.

306
00:20:56,368 --> 00:21:03,660
Speaker 0: so I'm downgrading personally my forecast of Nintendo's success in the future Mine was already downgraded.

307
00:21:03,942 --> 00:21:05,690
Speaker 0: I was at like a three out of five.

308
00:21:05,871 --> 00:21:12,755
Speaker 0: I was at a wait until they release a game I want and now I'm mad, you know, hope they release a game I want okay.

309
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,907
Speaker 1: So what if they come out with 3d advanced or so 3ds?

310
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,548
Speaker 0: I would wait till it came out and see what people said and try it somewhere before I'd buy it.

311
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:21,236
Speaker 1: But you'd buy a 3d.

312
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,770
Speaker 1: what if it was the only game that ever came out for 3ds, but it was great.

313
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,759
Speaker 1: Would you buy a 3ds and the game just for that?

314
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,101
Speaker 0: for that?

315
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:27,126
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

316
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,601
Speaker 0: I Really need a new advanced wars game, right?

317
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:33,615
Speaker 0: Like it's it's pretty bad I think.

318
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,384
Speaker 1: you know, I think we've got to work now.

319
00:21:35,404 --> 00:21:36,430
Speaker 0: You want to play some advanced wars?

320
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,529
Speaker 1: No, I think what we got to do is we have to work on making I think you were talking about with the couch TV.

321
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, well get this easy online advanced wars.

322
00:21:43,922 --> 00:21:45,226
Speaker 1: ish clone nobody needs to buy it.

323
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,492
Speaker 1: You know what?

324
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:46,977
Speaker 0: I'm doing all.

325
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:52,230
Speaker 0: next week my c++ Two-week boot camp got pushed back to like July because I was apparently the only student.

326
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:58,450
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, but I got a week-long like hardcore become a Python badass boot camp and I get to skip work all week.

327
00:21:58,832 --> 00:21:59,234
Speaker 1: All right.

328
00:21:59,274 --> 00:21:59,697
Speaker 1: How about that?

329
00:21:59,757 --> 00:22:01,507
Speaker 0: Yeah, so right after that, let's get cracking.

330
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,052
Speaker 1: All right We get it.

331
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,297
Speaker 1: We get to design the thing first.

332
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:04,679
Speaker 0: Yeah.

333
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,767
Speaker 0: I already got some ideas to infantry.

334
00:22:06,787 --> 00:22:14,240
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I'll make up I'll make a proof of concept with just two inventories and then once we have that foundation Then we can design all the units and all that crap.

335
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,736
Speaker 0: and with the design I will use because we're you know Pecs dev is coming up.

336
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:19,706
Speaker 0: We'll talk about in the meta, but you know what?

337
00:22:19,726 --> 00:22:20,490
Speaker 0: We'll talk about in the meta.

338
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,173
Speaker 0: What do you got in the news?

339
00:22:21,656 --> 00:22:22,781
Speaker 1: What do I don't have a news?

340
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:28,220
Speaker 1: Oh, I do have a geek bite though So you may remember a long time ago is the thing of the day.

341
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,790
Speaker 1: the codex of a chemical engineering is a flash game.

342
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:34,001
Speaker 0: It's basically a game that tricks you into writing code.

343
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,124
Speaker 1: It's a programming game.

344
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,830
Speaker 1: That doesn't look like a programming game, right?

345
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,553
Speaker 1: It's flash.

346
00:22:37,593 --> 00:22:39,099
Speaker 1: If you haven't played that you should go and play.

347
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:39,722
Speaker 0: it's great.

348
00:22:40,244 --> 00:22:41,429
Speaker 0: There's a non programmers.

349
00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:41,750
Speaker 0: It's great.

350
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,170
Speaker 1: Yes, the guy who made it Zach from Zach Tronics industries is basically a gaming design genius.

351
00:22:48,652 --> 00:22:49,858
Speaker 0: We should get him on the show.

352
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:50,240
Speaker 1: Sure.

353
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,561
Speaker 1: Come on.

354
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:51,345
Speaker 0: I will make it happen.

355
00:22:51,727 --> 00:22:54,740
Speaker 1: He's a genius Like oh my god, he's genius.

356
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:04,761
Speaker 1: Anyway, he made a game Couple months ago called space chem right and he came out and I was like, oh look at that It's another game from the Zach Tronic that genius guy on Steam.

357
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,765
Speaker 0: I bought it side unseen.

358
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:06,989
Speaker 0: I haven't played it yet, right?

359
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,894
Speaker 1: It's $15 on Steam because or 15 euros Yeah, which is a ripoff.

360
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:18,050
Speaker 1: but last week it was 750 on sale, which is when I bought it and that was a good price.

361
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:24,250
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'd buy it for 15, but it's basically codex level chemical engineering on double crack.

362
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:30,350
Speaker 1: It is oh my god the most amazing and basically the way this game what this game is about actually has a story.

363
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:36,648
Speaker 1: You're in space and you need to do chemistry, you know, it was really hard to not.

364
00:23:36,688 --> 00:23:36,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

365
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,044
Speaker 1: Yeah basically, you know, it's.

366
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:52,110
Speaker 1: it's like Codex of a chemical engineering where you had to make you know machines that will take apart Elements and put them together into other elements, but he's instead of using alchemy like mercury and such he's using actual chemistry.

367
00:23:52,211 --> 00:23:54,810
Speaker 1: So here's a carbon with four hydrogens attached to it.

368
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,553
Speaker 1: It's a methane.

369
00:23:55,854 --> 00:24:06,636
Speaker 1: remove the hydrogens and then put them over here and put the carbon in the hydrogen over there You know and then make a carbon monoxide and an acetylene something over here and it's like oh my god How am I gonna do this?

370
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,087
Speaker 1: and then somehow you manage to do it?

371
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:13,710
Speaker 1: But you actually get to make multiple machines and link them together with pipes.

372
00:24:14,192 --> 00:24:17,510
Speaker 1: So it's it's even more like programming because you can actually sort of write functions.

373
00:24:17,952 --> 00:24:24,330
Speaker 1: You know each machine being you know a function and then you know and at the same time He also added the synchronized command.

374
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:32,230
Speaker 1: So you've actually you know I think if I remember correctly in codex civil chemical engineering all you did was write a program down the left-hand side.

375
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:40,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this one you actually on any given machine You have a red and a blue sort of worker that each have their own programs.

376
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,543
Speaker 1: You can have actually two programs running together just to make the machine work.

377
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,028
Speaker 0: Oh shit multi-threaded.

378
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:51,191
Speaker 1: and There is a a synchronized, you know command Signaling.

379
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:52,795
Speaker 1: so what if a?

380
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:59,979
Speaker 1: if a machine hits a synchronized command it'll wait there until the other machine hits a synchronized command And then both of them will resume.

381
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:08,490
Speaker 0: moving from that point I mean, it's rare that I can take a game and give you such a direct correlation to a real-life valuable skill.

382
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,774
Speaker 0: I mean war games.

383
00:25:09,814 --> 00:25:15,050
Speaker 0: teach you abstract game theory to a degree, but that doesn't apply directly to your life in an obvious way.

384
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:22,870
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there are some things like I remember this guy wrote this article about how his kid was playing Pokemon cards And at first he was like a waste of money collecting.

385
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:33,750
Speaker 1: But then he noticed that the one thing his kid did learn from the Pokemon trading card game was the ability to do Arithmetic very quickly because you had to be like BAM 20 damage my debt.

386
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,390
Speaker 1: My health is now 80 and now I need three energy to do it, right?

387
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,444
Speaker 0: Oh, but it wasn't obvious in that that was kind of a side effect of the game.

388
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:42,950
Speaker 0: Of course wasn't a math game?

389
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,082
Speaker 0: Yes, of course, but this is the case where I mean what you just described is multi-threaded.

390
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,115
Speaker 1: You play space care.

391
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:54,266
Speaker 1: you like space cam like you really like it.

392
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:55,150
Speaker 1: you can't get enough of it.

393
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:58,870
Speaker 1: You should go into computer science because that's what you'll be doing all day every day.

394
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,190
Speaker 0: And if you hate this game, you really should not be going into computers.

395
00:26:02,411 --> 00:26:05,823
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, which is sucky because everyone needs to know computers.

396
00:26:05,903 --> 00:26:16,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, really, but yeah, so yeah Even if you don't like it You should play space cam anyway so that you can stay up to date with the real world and not fall behind and be like a caveman Luddite.

397
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:27,744
Speaker 0: So things of the day as you all know this weekend is the rapture.

398
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:29,469
Speaker 0: Jesus coming back to kick our asses.

399
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:30,695
Speaker 0: the end Get ready.

400
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,529
Speaker 1: I have prepared many anti-jesus.

401
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,710
Speaker 0: I have pestered the people in Grand Central every day for the past several weeks.

402
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,080
Speaker 0: I every day ask them for their wallet.

403
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:41,868
Speaker 0: I asked him if they want to meet me on the 22nd.

404
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,734
Speaker 0: I asked him if I can have their house.

405
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,296
Speaker 1: Yep.

406
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:48,310
Speaker 1: So I've got some anti-jesus weaponry prepared just in case.

407
00:26:48,992 --> 00:26:49,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we got.

408
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:51,341
Speaker 1: we got some upside-down crosses.

409
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:53,207
Speaker 1: obviously we got some.

410
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:53,709
Speaker 1: we got some.

411
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,965
Speaker 0: you know I feel like Jesus might be more afraid of a right-side-up cross.

412
00:26:57,227 --> 00:26:57,729
Speaker 1: Well, we got.

413
00:26:59,331 --> 00:27:00,158
Speaker 1: Really you think you?

414
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:01,126
Speaker 1: you think he'd rather be.

415
00:27:01,994 --> 00:27:03,649
Speaker 1: Wouldn't it be so much worse if you're upside-down?

416
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,461
Speaker 0: But at the same time he was gotten by her eyesight up.

417
00:27:06,642 --> 00:27:08,210
Speaker 0: one have some bad memories, right?

418
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,130
Speaker 1: So now it'd be like this time we're gonna hang you upside down.

419
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:14,202
Speaker 0: Of course my lookout to say that wouldn't really fit me.

420
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:18,638
Speaker 0: Oh upside down Yeah We got.

421
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:21,312
Speaker 1: we got some Works.

422
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:22,738
Speaker 1: no garlic works on vampires.

423
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,200
Speaker 1: You got vamp.

424
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:25,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta have actual vampires to fight against Jesus.

425
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,494
Speaker 0: Is he not undead?

426
00:27:26,534 --> 00:27:28,763
Speaker 0: and one wouldn't you just turn on dead at like level 30?

427
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:30,971
Speaker 0: I Don't think.

428
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:35,043
Speaker 1: and we have some sharks because Jesus loves fish and sharks eat fish Scott.

429
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,547
Speaker 0: I have a much more powerful weapon.

430
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:37,510
Speaker 0: All right Socrates.

431
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:49,863
Speaker 0: Oh But Anonymous and I now speak on behalf of anonymous here by right now.

432
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,710
Speaker 1: No, you don't because everyone knows who you are.

433
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:55,786
Speaker 0: You're not speaking anonymously On behalf of them, but I'm not a member.

434
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,349
Speaker 1: There's a chain of custody that is broken whatever say what you got to say.

435
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,590
Speaker 0: So Anonymous is once again doing a call to arms and Anyone who's about to say how do you know it's really anonymous if you have to ask that question?

436
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,044
Speaker 0: You don't understand what anonymous is.

437
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:10,529
Speaker 1: That's right.

438
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:24,070
Speaker 0: They've decided to pull a worldwide prank and they're being pretty open about it on the internet because they figure People who are on the internet enough to notice this before it happens are not the people that they're going to target.

439
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,772
Speaker 1: That's correct.

440
00:28:24,952 --> 00:28:28,261
Speaker 0: They're targeting local news and crackpots.

441
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:32,554
Speaker 0: Yep, basically on May 22nd 8 p.m.

Speaker 0: Yes It is this Sunday at 8 o'clock at night.

446
00:28:38,719 --> 00:28:42,476
Speaker 1: Yes, I actually would probably will be home from bar camp But I'll be incredibly tired.

447
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:47,735
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll be able to participate due to physical You know disability.

448
00:28:47,795 --> 00:29:05,175
Speaker 0: but I do wish I would participate because I am or call Your outlet of choice, maybe a local newspaper Maybe a crackpot conspiracy theorist blog, maybe your crazy friend who believes in Ron Paul You know, what are any of those people?

449
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,542
Speaker 0: maybe multiple if you're ambitious?

450
00:29:07,782 --> 00:29:09,307
Speaker 0: Yeah and report that you're.

451
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:17,085
Speaker 0: you've seen a Triangle of eight or so yellow lights in the sky and has everyone see?

452
00:29:17,245 --> 00:29:19,310
Speaker 1: it would be one thing if people started reporting UFOs.

453
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:30,250
Speaker 1: But if everyone all around the whole country starts reporting the same exact UFO I'm going to call local New York one from Skype, you know, New York one is actually.

454
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:32,616
Speaker 1: It's like people don't know this.

455
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:33,479
Speaker 1: it aren't from New York.

456
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:37,302
Speaker 1: New York one is this TV channel that you can only watch on Time Warner I'm pretty sure.

457
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:42,157
Speaker 1: And it's like the most boring Generic news.

458
00:29:42,177 --> 00:29:43,544
Speaker 0: the temperatures 57 degrees, right?

459
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,234
Speaker 1: but the thing is because it's.

460
00:29:46,394 --> 00:29:47,798
Speaker 1: it's because it's so boring.

461
00:29:47,879 --> 00:29:53,740
Speaker 1: it actually kicks the shit out of say the Fox News's and the other all Sensational news is because it's just so.

462
00:29:54,122 --> 00:30:01,810
Speaker 1: it's just normal news like Is in the city today giving a speech about X opposite side of the street parking has been suspended.

463
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,610
Speaker 1: If you're new if you're a New York person, it's actually pretty useful.

464
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:12,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, because no human can on their own know the actual rules of where you can and cannot park.

465
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,001
Speaker 1: Well, it's not you know, but there's a lot of things.

466
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:15,290
Speaker 1: the subway isn't working.

467
00:30:15,411 --> 00:30:17,101
Speaker 1: There has been a you know, there's all sorts of.

468
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:21,502
Speaker 1: when you're in a city like New York There's a whole bunch of news that matters only to New York people.

469
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:26,930
Speaker 1: that doesn't mean anything to the rest of the country at all The rest of the world and New York one is a pretty good way to get that news.

470
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,768
Speaker 0: I'm gonna call them and I'm gonna email some crackpot that Scott Johnson knows.

471
00:30:30,808 --> 00:30:36,233
Speaker 1: probably I would just go down the list of all the all the local TV where you know wherever you live.

472
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:49,721
Speaker 1: go down the list of all your local TV stations get your ABC CBS NBC Fox and Then call your local newspapers, you know and in like, you know Younger and puncher and not an adult who has responsibilities.

473
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:51,085
Speaker 0: I would call the police.

474
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:53,954
Speaker 0: Oh, that's ballsy I would go for it.

475
00:30:54,014 --> 00:30:56,665
Speaker 1: Would you call the 911 or just 9-1-1?

476
00:30:56,946 --> 00:30:57,990
Speaker 0: I'd call the local cops.

477
00:30:58,351 --> 00:30:59,715
Speaker 1: Okay, you can do that.

478
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:08,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I Guess they could get me for something and if I was 17, oh, yeah Yeah, anyway, that's my thing of the day.

479
00:31:09,261 --> 00:31:09,964
Speaker 0: Let's go for it.

Speaker 1: basically, he went and gave this presentation PowerPoint and all he said during the whole thing was chicken and It was actually pretty hilarious is one of the best presentations I ever seen better than any of our panels.

489
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,097
Speaker 0: I have one very important thing to note.

490
00:32:02,718 --> 00:32:03,460
Speaker 0: He took questions.

491
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,890
Speaker 0: He did take questions and only two questions were asked.

00:32:07,632 --> 00:32:11,086
Speaker 1: They were might have seen this already because it has about a million YouTube views.

495
00:32:20,144 --> 00:32:24,982
Speaker 0: That is true and That saddens me immensely.

Speaker 1: You gotta watch this video is great.

497
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:32,890

00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:15,502
Speaker 0: The next big concept we'll be going to that you Tuesday folks will care about will be packs and probably packs dev and Along those lines I do want to say because Scott noticed all the books I got accused me of cheating because I kind of am cheating.

511
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:17,230
Speaker 0: We're up in the ante.

512
00:33:17,571 --> 00:33:25,716
Speaker 0: We're gonna have at least one panel that's going to go way beyond what we've gone to before in terms of game theory Yeah, which means we have to learn it.

513
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really up in the ante.

514
00:33:28,468 --> 00:33:35,242
Speaker 0: on the math I'm actually working on specific actual Mathematical week solutions to some of the board games we've gotten.

00:33:35,322 --> 00:33:37,636
Speaker 1: so when you feel when you finish up one of those books Give me it.

Speaker 1: It's a classic.

519
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,388
Speaker 1: So I don't even read it, but it's a classic.

520
00:33:47,428 --> 00:33:47,909
Speaker 1: so I picked it.

521
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,075
Speaker 1: You know, it's out.

522
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:50,140
Speaker 1: It's the kind of book that's like.

523
00:33:50,401 --> 00:33:52,090
Speaker 1: oh, that's got to be a must read, right?

524
00:33:53,171 --> 00:33:58,169
Speaker 1: Also, I do want to remind people how many t-shirts do we have left like six?

525
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:02,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are still six geek nice t-shirts in a box somewhere around here.

526
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:03,857
Speaker 1: You can buy them.

527
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:05,790
Speaker 1: if you go to front recruit calm and click on shop.

528
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:07,880
Speaker 1: You could buy one of those six t-shirts.

529
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,824
Speaker 1: They could be yours.

530
00:34:09,085 --> 00:34:09,567
Speaker 0: There's not.

531
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:10,371
Speaker 1: on Europa They.

532
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:14,123
Speaker 0: someone ordered a shirt relatively recently and I forgot to ship it to you.

533
00:34:14,204 --> 00:34:15,428
Speaker 0: So you'll get an email from me.

534
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:16,391
Speaker 1: Good job Right.

535
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:19,090
Speaker 1: Yeah rim is the one responsible for all the e-commerce thing.

536
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:24,379
Speaker 1: So if you're from a foreign country and you can't buy one I figured out how to handle that blame rim and they.

537
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:31,203
Speaker 0: I got an email from someone and soon as soon as I figure out The invoicing system I can take international orders by email or phone.

538
00:34:31,223 --> 00:34:33,350
Speaker 1: Well, that'll probably take care of the six remaining shirts.

539
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:37,590
Speaker 0: I think so cuz we have at least six listeners overseas who want shirts and one.

540
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:43,859
Speaker 0: Yeah If you're the dude who didn't get your shirt because you ordered it and I forgot I'm gonna cut the price in like half when I ship it to you.

541
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:51,010
Speaker 0: Yeah Just just put some money in the box cuz we already made all the money a long time ago on those shirts.

542
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,081
Speaker 1: But we are gonna as soon as they run out We're gonna get more merch of some kind.

543
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:56,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got some stickers lined up.

544
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:06,008
Speaker 1: I was actually thinking there there's got to be some place that we can go right that give us like a whole merch Package like shirts and stickers shitty cafe, press.

545
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:08,562
Speaker 0: no I'm not like that to pay to code that we're not.

546
00:35:08,602 --> 00:35:09,829
Speaker 0: we don't sell enough stuff to go to.

547
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:14,350
Speaker 1: No, like, you know like because when people are doing like promotions for the business, right?

548
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:18,125
Speaker 1: They'll have like shirts and pens and stickers and buttons and like a whole.

549
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:19,350
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah a bunch of crap.

550
00:35:19,571 --> 00:35:21,202
Speaker 0: I can get all that stuff from the place.

551
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:22,269
Speaker 0: I ordered the shirts from.

552
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:30,050
Speaker 1: yeah There's got to be a place that offers like a package deal as opposed to having to order each thing separately Like I want to order each thing separately would cost about the same.

553
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think there's no one who offers like a package deal where you don't think about it.

554
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:35,100
Speaker 0: I've done a lot of research on these fronts.

555
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:37,310
Speaker 0: I have really good really cheap suppliers.

556
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,625
Speaker 0: The only reason we don't have more merch is laziness coupled with a lack of artistic ability.

557
00:35:42,806 --> 00:35:43,046
Speaker 1: Yep.

558
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:44,814
Speaker 0: That's really it All right.

559
00:35:44,854 --> 00:35:46,729
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we're gonna work on it.

560
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:57,284
Speaker 0: So this weekend this past weekend we invited number of people over to play a board game from 1959 Mm-hmm board game took called diplomacy a game incredibly famous game.

561
00:35:57,545 --> 00:36:02,548
Speaker 0: I'd always known I would argue It is not famous but infamous is both much like.

562
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:11,858
Speaker 0: well no, it is a game that many people is not obscure will refer to as the friend breaker that I think most gamers have heard of But few have actually ever played.

563
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,150
Speaker 0: it's a game that people talk about playing.

564
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:16,737
Speaker 0: They talk about that friend who played it.

565
00:36:16,998 --> 00:36:20,186
Speaker 0: Maybe they saw a game of it at their local gaming con.

566
00:36:20,206 --> 00:36:29,208
Speaker 0: I have known Maybe ten people in my life including the five people from this weekend who have actually played a game of diplomacy.

567
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:35,950
Speaker 1: to conclusion Yeah, I've never actually played diplomacy before but I knew you know, I had known that it was a game that existed.

568
00:36:36,915 --> 00:36:40,130
Speaker 0: I had played once and I didn't finish that game at our way.

569
00:36:40,311 --> 00:36:45,216
Speaker 1: I knew generally what it was about, but I didn't actually know the rules Specifically until very recently.

570
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:49,489
Speaker 0: so like months the internet said that the game takes about four hours to play.

571
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:53,180
Speaker 0: Wikipedia says the game takes at minimum four hours to play.

572
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,393
Speaker 1: All right, and the box box does not say all right That's weird.

573
00:36:57,413 --> 00:36:58,782
Speaker 1: A box usually gives a time estimate.

574
00:36:58,943 --> 00:37:04,996
Speaker 0: This is a game from It's right now.

575
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:10,618
Speaker 0: it's put out by Wiz ads of the coast used to be Avalon Hill Designed by Allen B. Kalhamer.

576
00:37:10,638 --> 00:37:14,050
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about him and I'm not gonna talk about the history of the game.

577
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,410
Speaker 0: Diplomacy is a game that you've got to really be committed to if you want to play.

578
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,142
Speaker 0: Diplomacy is an asshole game with ass old rules.

579
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:24,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is clear.

580
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:25,650
Speaker 1: You know, it is not elegantly.

581
00:37:26,052 --> 00:37:30,890
Speaker 1: I mean some things about it are clever right, but mostly the game is not elegant.

582
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:38,650
Speaker 1: It has many flaws The rules have many gotchas and errata's and it is not a smooth production and by any means.

583
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:46,863
Speaker 0: Well, it seemed simple until the second round of the game when immediately Everyone just made moves that created this circular clusterfuck.

584
00:37:46,903 --> 00:37:52,061
Speaker 0: that took us like 20 minutes to unravel Yeah, only to determine that the end result was nothing.

585
00:37:52,101 --> 00:37:53,465
Speaker 1: Well, we think it was nothing.

586
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,810
Speaker 1: I still can't get a clarify.

587
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:58,383
Speaker 0: I want to play again by mail, but I want to play again by computer.

588
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,070
Speaker 0: We talked about how diplomacy works.

589
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:01,970
Speaker 0: It's on the surface level.

590
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:09,610
Speaker 0: It is a simulation of a World War one esque conflict like a Franco-Prussian war something something in that era.

591
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:15,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all the players are basically were you know leaders of countries great power dictators great powers.

592
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,275
Speaker 0: So, you know Britain France Austria Turkey Russia turns out.

593
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:23,366
Speaker 0: none of my friends know what the fucking Russian flag looks like except me.

594
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:24,390
Speaker 1: I do now.

595
00:38:24,731 --> 00:38:27,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do now everyone does now everyone.

596
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:29,770
Speaker 0: I was like, alright, you think you know all the old flags, right?

597
00:38:30,153 --> 00:38:31,484
Speaker 0: What's this one France?

598
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,748
Speaker 1: Nope Come on, it's red white and blue.

599
00:38:35,811 --> 00:38:41,650
Speaker 0: Doesn't anyone know that the white is in the middle to symbolize that the royalty was splitting the nation in two?

600
00:38:41,991 --> 00:38:42,493
Speaker 1: No, I won't.

601
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:42,995
Speaker 1: I do now.

602
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:51,305
Speaker 1: but yeah, my problem was that it's like, you know from you know, most of my life The Soviet flag was a flag that was so.

603
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:56,883
Speaker 1: be it flag the Soviet I know because Scott I knew that the Soviet flag was not the Russian flag, but it's just.

604
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,850
Speaker 1: I rarely saw the Russian flag.

605
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, nobody knew Austria or Italy or anything.

606
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:03,870
Speaker 0: it was kind of amazing.

607
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:06,883
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to know flags more than I know them now.

608
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:22,414
Speaker 0: actually if you believe me It is actually a very apt simulation of the diplomacy surrounding World War one because we played for five hours and 28 minutes and at the end of that time It was a five-way draw.

609
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:31,211
Speaker 0: Yep, and everyone was dissatisfied with the result and Basically saying if we played more rounds I would have invaded X.

610
00:39:31,652 --> 00:39:42,080
Speaker 1: Yeah leading directly into World War two Alright, so basically the way the game works and the thing that's clever about it Right is that everyone has units and every unit is worth exactly one.

611
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,873
Speaker 1: It's not like risk where you can get a numbers game like a high.

612
00:39:44,893 --> 00:39:46,822
Speaker 1: I've got 40 attacking your five I win.

613
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,126
Speaker 1: it's you got one.

614
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:53,464
Speaker 0: you can have at most one unit per space and no army has a power Different from one.

615
00:39:53,484 --> 00:39:59,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if I attack Scott in Silesia and he's in Silesia, it's one-on-one.

616
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:00,024
Speaker 0: I bounced back.

617
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:01,169
Speaker 0: nothing happens.

618
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:01,591
Speaker 0: Yep.

619
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,817
Speaker 0: No one gets defeated.

620
00:40:02,877 --> 00:40:04,102
Speaker 0: No one gets destroyed Just nothing.

621
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:12,880
Speaker 1: now what he could do is he could attack with two which would then eject me, but it doesn't kill me It just makes me retreat to a different open country nearby.

622
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,797
Speaker 1: The only way I would die is if there was no open country nearby and I was trapped.

623
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:18,440
Speaker 1: then I would die.

624
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:28,060
Speaker 1: And the thing is you start the game with only what three units and Russia gets for Russia gets force You have barely any units and you control supply centers in your home country.

625
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:42,920
Speaker 0: And if you control one at the end, you know you to every other turn You'll get units so that you all lose units so that you have a number of units equal to the number of supply centers You control but said reinforcements can only come out of where you originally started.

626
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:49,240
Speaker 0: So even if I control 17 of those fuckers, I can only get new units in my home country.

627
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:50,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty.

628
00:40:51,028 --> 00:41:00,319
Speaker 1: basically the game makes it such that Unless you're already dominating like unless I've already taken someone over and now I've got two countries, you know worth of guys.

629
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,009
Speaker 1: My you know the ability.

630
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:11,584
Speaker 1: my ability to influence the game just based on my own decisions of where I'm gonna move my units and what orders I'm gonna give them is Basically nil.

631
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:18,084
Speaker 1: you can't do anything on your own because you have so few units and they're all equally powerful to everyone else's units You can't do anything.

632
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:23,560
Speaker 1: So you can't win the game just by sitting there making decisions like you do in every other board game.

633
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:30,867
Speaker 0: so here's where the game departs radically from what most people expect from a war game because it is really a Negotiation game a diplomacy game.

634
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,695
Speaker 0: Hence the title diplomacy.

635
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:38,275
Speaker 0: Yep one Everybody has your 15 minutes between every turn to talk.

636
00:41:38,857 --> 00:41:39,520
Speaker 0: go walk away.

637
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,087
Speaker 1: You can do it every one.

638
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,177
Speaker 0: go out on the balcony go into the bathroom.

639
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:43,800
Speaker 0: Go outside.

640
00:41:44,221 --> 00:41:45,506
Speaker 0: SMS someone doesn't matter.

641
00:41:45,526 --> 00:41:53,059
Speaker 0: at the end of that time before the end of that time You have to have written down the orders for all your moves and put them in the hat.

642
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:54,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, or box or whatever.

643
00:41:54,426 --> 00:41:58,598
Speaker 0: The orders are all revealed and done simultaneously after the fact.

644
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:04,690
Speaker 0: Now secondary to this There are no Binding agreements in the game.

645
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,800
Speaker 0: The game is a non-cooperative game.

646
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:11,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can make all the agreements in the world, but nothing buying couldn't write up treaties.

647
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:13,092
Speaker 1: You can pretend to have a UN.

648
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,220
Speaker 1: you can do all sorts of stuff.

649
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,260
Speaker 0: We did form a League of Nations and had two meetings in the court in the context of the game.

650
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:25,563
Speaker 0: Yeah to decide the future of Europe after we the the inevitable horrid Stalemate.

651
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:29,698
Speaker 0: Yeah until I eventually betrayed my allies Russia and Turkey.

652
00:42:29,718 --> 00:42:31,899
Speaker 0: Yeah You deserved it.

653
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:36,652
Speaker 1: Turkey I wasn't gonna be ineffectual completely ineffectual.

654
00:42:36,752 --> 00:42:37,695
Speaker 1: I was ineffectual.

655
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:38,398
Speaker 1: I was very good.

656
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:39,060
Speaker 0: No, you weren't you.

657
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:53,024
Speaker 0: But Basically the other big thing about the game aside from the you know Aside from what I just told you is that the only way to really get anywhere is to coordinate your moves Very exactly.

658
00:42:53,325 --> 00:43:06,940
Speaker 1: Yes, for example, let's say I want to attack rim here, right and I'm attacking him from Constantinople to You know Budapest, right and that's the move I'm gonna make and I need some help for my buddy in Russia.

659
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,380
Speaker 1: My buddy in Russia wants to support my attack on Budapest.

660
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:19,440
Speaker 0: He has to have a unit adjacent to the place Scott is going to attack and he has to script not attack But support and then the unit he is supporting and where it is going.

661
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,485
Speaker 1: So on his sheet.

662
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:43,968
Speaker 1: in order for him to actually help me win and attack rim and hurt rim He has to write on his sheet unit in Whatever place he's in supports attack from Constantinople to Budapest that's he has to write that which means he needs to know that I am going to make an attack from Constantinople to Budapest which means I need to tell him that and He needs to.

663
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,380
Speaker 1: so now I'm giving him information.

664
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:52,520
Speaker 1: That means I need to not lie to him and he needs to actually be faithful with our alliance or go through with it.

665
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,175
Speaker 0: He already talked to me and said look I'm really on your side.

666
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:57,280
Speaker 0: Let's eliminate everyone else.

667
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's figure out where is Scott's either going to attack in this place or that place.

668
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,660
Speaker 1: I'll pretend I'm gonna help him.

669
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,709
Speaker 1: We'll figure out which one of those two places is.

670
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,280
Speaker 1: then we'll know to support the defense of that place.

671
00:44:10,621 --> 00:44:14,120
Speaker 0: I'll support an attack to cut off the support and dislodge the supporting unit.

672
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:16,760
Speaker 0: That's causing the attack to bounce back and messing up all your plans.

673
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:24,976
Speaker 1: We have to coordinate all that in the span of the 15 minutes And if you do that were to cut off the support, it'll make it look like that Russia did.

674
00:44:25,056 --> 00:44:26,079
Speaker 1: it was trying to help me

675
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:39,561
Speaker 0: And It's complicated if I'm trying to coordinate this with my ally and my allies trying to fake out Scott I mean you only got 15 minutes and if I go off to talk to him on the balcony all secret Like

676
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:41,129
Speaker 1: Scott's gonna know something's up.

677
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:45,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can just look around the room and you know You've got all all that met all this stuff.

678
00:44:45,211 --> 00:44:46,860
Speaker 1: that's meta in other games, right?

679
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,208
Speaker 1: Like oh, I see how you're holding your cards.

680
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:52,280
Speaker 1: That means you that stuff is meta in most games in diplomacy.

681
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:53,052
Speaker 1: That is the game.

682
00:44:53,133 --> 00:45:01,796
Speaker 0: at one point I wrote down I will betray Scott this turn and I put it in the Hat and I was gonna hand the Hat to the people I needed to communicate this to.

683
00:45:03,143 --> 00:45:07,677
Speaker 0: You know were supposedly on the opposite alliance and that was the best way I could come up with you.

684
00:45:07,697 --> 00:45:11,040
Speaker 0: not let Scott and Richard Know that I was about to betray the ever-living fuck out of them.

685
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, one time so people tried to attempt to hide the Hat.

686
00:45:14,973 --> 00:45:15,916
Speaker 1: that was that was clever.

687
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:17,100
Speaker 0: That was clever and hilarious.

688
00:45:17,262 --> 00:45:18,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't work.

689
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:23,520
Speaker 0: I mean the rules are if you just if you're not back You don't put your orders in all your units hold they just sit there.

690
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my orders were complete went by the time ran out and did just because the Hat wasn't there.

691
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,883
Speaker 1: That does that doesn't mean that you know, yeah, just like punch the guy like yeah, that was the thing I was thinking.

692
00:45:32,923 --> 00:45:35,377
Speaker 1: I was like, why don't we just punch people and tie people down?

693
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:35,819
Speaker 1: and it's like.

694
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:39,054
Speaker 1: well The thing is if you do that, then the game really is just beat doesn't?

695
00:45:39,074 --> 00:45:40,440
Speaker 1: it's not diplomacy more just boxing.

696
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,633
Speaker 0: It's who is the fifth strongest man on Europe Island?

697
00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:50,860
Speaker 1: Yes, you sort of have to be like, alright Nobody can break real laws while playing the game because otherwise it just breaks down and there's no point.

698
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,104
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you're not gonna.

699
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:57,040
Speaker 1: you can't lock someone in a room or knock someone unconscious or drug someone.

700
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,780
Speaker 0: Oh the final important aspect of the game is that at any time any all the players?

701
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:04,426
Speaker 1: No, there's two aspects aspect.

702
00:46:04,446 --> 00:46:11,196
Speaker 0: Number one is at any time any player can quit Yeah, you can quit which is something talked about in our panel.

703
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,020
Speaker 0: losing should be fun.

704
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:16,975
Speaker 0: Within the rules you could games have an ability for a player who's not having fun to just leave.

705
00:46:17,176 --> 00:46:19,366
Speaker 1: you can just leave if it's Too much for you.

706
00:46:19,386 --> 00:46:27,520
Speaker 1: if you're if you're tired of it Maybe you got hosed and you're ineffectual and no one likes you anymore and you don't have it in you to try to make someone.

707
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:30,558
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I'm not powerful enough So no one even wants my help.

708
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:31,964
Speaker 1: Right and this data?

709
00:46:32,105 --> 00:46:37,824
Speaker 1: there's really nothing I can do to help them and I'm so weak that I can't be effectual on my own I might as well quit.

710
00:46:37,884 --> 00:46:48,523
Speaker 0: you can quit gracefully the game allows for it, but you don't want to because The only way to end the game is either one person has to control 18 supply centers you start with three.

711
00:46:48,604 --> 00:46:51,953
Speaker 1: that is basically impossible unless other people just let you.

712
00:46:52,214 --> 00:46:56,880
Speaker 1: or if you have an ally you Roll and you keep playing for a long time.

713
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:05,996
Speaker 1: You could eventually get there but the instruction book even says the official instruction book says if you win that way you were playing it Wrong, or you're playing it right and all your friends is stupid.

714
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:06,760
Speaker 1: That's possible.

715
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:14,240
Speaker 0: So the way to end the game really is a vote among all players who have any number of military units still on the board.

716
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:20,385
Speaker 1: even if you have one unit left on the board you get the same number of votes as everyone else even a Unanimous vote.

717
00:47:20,626 --> 00:47:23,920
Speaker 0: you end the game and everyone who voted shares the draw.

718
00:47:24,484 --> 00:47:26,940
Speaker 0: Everyone who did not vote because they were not on the board loses.

719
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:32,340
Speaker 1: So even if you've got one unit left and some other guy has 17 another guy is seven.

720
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,751
Speaker 1: Basically, everyone has 17 or less and you have one and you all vote.

721
00:47:36,113 --> 00:47:38,823
Speaker 1: you win just as much as those guys with 17.

722
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:46,437
Speaker 0: Now we were playing you understand for the championship belt which is a thing now in the crew dating back to the time of the vision and the bamboo.

723
00:47:46,537 --> 00:47:47,039
Speaker 1: that's correct.

724
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:51,453
Speaker 0: and We ended up taking a picture of all five of us holding the belt.

725
00:47:51,814 --> 00:48:02,583
Speaker 0: and what really happened was Five and a half hours into the game You know, we come down to an alliance of three and an alliance of two and the alliance of two was doing really well But they couldn't.

726
00:48:02,764 --> 00:48:10,018
Speaker 0: they didn't have the momentum to push through and beat the alliance of three Even though they had a huge advantage due to early game stuff.

727
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:21,139
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, we actually you know operation invade Italy probably would have succeeded in significantly damaging the the alliance of two If you hadn't betrayed me on that vital turn, ah, but you could have waited one more turn.

728
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:24,020
Speaker 0: Invade Italy was going very well.

729
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:35,712
Speaker 0: you realize that France's operation invade Austria was about to begin and had I can followed through - I would have taken Italy and Lost Austria thus losing my ability to make new unit.

730
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:40,980
Speaker 0: That's fine and dandy by Turkey Yeah, and then you would have lost an ally and you would have been done.

731
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,960
Speaker 1: No, cuz down it once I once we had Italy we could have then retaken Austria on the next turn.

732
00:48:46,182 --> 00:48:46,928
Speaker 0: I don't think you could have.

733
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:48,139
Speaker 1: you were thinking too short-term.

734
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:57,820
Speaker 0: also, I Was pretty much the most powerful person in my triple alliance because of the nature of the game had significant power.

735
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:06,920
Speaker 0: I just couldn't extend my power In a more centralized place and a more secure border, the only real threat to me was France.

736
00:49:07,201 --> 00:49:10,940
Speaker 1: I had oh, I've actually had more units than you at many points in the game.

737
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:23,858
Speaker 0: My problem was that early on the geography of Turkey made it incredibly difficult to exert my force over great You know what early on in the game when you had more units than me that's when I was allied with you Yeah, and I was okay with that.

738
00:49:24,665 --> 00:49:26,196
Speaker 0: Notice how soon as I had more units than you.

739
00:49:26,237 --> 00:49:26,680
Speaker 0: betrayal.

740
00:49:27,042 --> 00:49:27,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, jerk.

741
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,420
Speaker 0: part of it was that Russia was doing the best possible thing.

742
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:36,160
Speaker 0: It just turned out that Russia and England were very expertly countering each other.

743
00:49:36,522 --> 00:49:38,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're basically at a stalemate.

744
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,720
Speaker 0: Meanwhile Turkey was at a stalemate coming around Greece and I was at a stalemate.

745
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:53,415
Speaker 1: France was incredibly too strong and me and rim had to team up to even hold him back and we were starting to Make a little bit of progress pushing him back But it was so slow and in the process of doing so we almost took Italy.

746
00:49:53,556 --> 00:49:58,550
Speaker 1: if we had one more turn But in order to take that Italy rim was gonna leave his Austria open.

747
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:09,500
Speaker 0: and you realize that the double Alliance the Allies had been constantly offering me Great benefits to turn over power to them and join their Alliance.

748
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:11,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically that was another problem.

749
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,879
Speaker 1: right is that you know?

750
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,066
Speaker 1: England and France teamed up.

751
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:20,080
Speaker 0: a hundred percent had absolutely no betray as they as is the smart thing to do in this game.

752
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were a complete lock together Absolutely, never betrayed each other.

753
00:50:24,266 --> 00:50:28,679
Speaker 1: They left their backs open to each other and not once did they attack each other in the fatigueable.

754
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,617
Speaker 0: now You know why I betrayed you because remember two rounds before that we had our brilliant plan.

755
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:34,440
Speaker 0: It was our last ditch.

756
00:50:34,701 --> 00:50:39,178
Speaker 0: I had that one army that was gonna try to scoot all over the bottom of Europe and pop out behind him.

757
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:41,224
Speaker 0: just conquer like Work.

758
00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:42,559
Speaker 0: yeah, that didn't work.

759
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:48,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, then I betrayed you but they the two of them were an equal counterbalance for the three of us.

760
00:50:49,021 --> 00:51:01,418
Speaker 0: So I decided that if I join them we could roll you and then the game would end and the three of us would share victory, uh-huh Here's where the fundamental problem with the game of diplomacy the to to fundamental problems.

761
00:51:01,578 --> 00:51:05,648
Speaker 0: three fanatical devotion comfy chair problem.

762
00:51:05,708 --> 00:51:13,814
Speaker 0: the one at At minimum Not at minimum at maximum every turn takes 15 minutes plus resolving.

763
00:51:13,914 --> 00:51:15,198
Speaker 0: So about 20 minutes total.

764
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:19,591
Speaker 0: Yep Say I had joined them in their Alliance and it's three.

765
00:51:19,671 --> 00:51:22,680
Speaker 0: on to the three strongest players against the two weakest players.

766
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:39,827
Speaker 0: Victory is assured But it was gonna take us about Four to five turns to actually get into a position to eliminate Turkey and then Russia which would then you could have voted unanimously for a three-way victory Which would have been preferable to a five-way.

767
00:51:39,927 --> 00:51:43,338
Speaker 0: So five turns to take out Turkey two more to finish off Russia.

768
00:51:43,478 --> 00:52:03,676
Speaker 0: seven turns times minutes Because Scott and Richard Russia and Turkey being intelligent rather than quitting if their utility is to share victory would wait 14 minutes and 59 seconds every round to turn in their orders of support support hold.

769
00:52:03,696 --> 00:52:05,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

770
00:52:05,963 --> 00:52:11,840
Speaker 1: And it would have been incredibly difficult because of the geography involved for you to actually break those support hole.

771
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,480
Speaker 1: No, it would have been pretty easy because there weren't enough adjacent territories.

772
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,366
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were.

773
00:52:16,406 --> 00:52:27,310
Speaker 1: you'd have to take them pretty much one or two at a time Yep, so you couldn't take like five in a big sweep no matter how close the problem war weariness is simulated Brilliantly in this game.

774
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:31,689
Speaker 0: hmm war weariness Actually happens because at five and a half hours.

775
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,863
Speaker 0: We were actually literally weary of the war Extremely.

776
00:52:36,003 --> 00:52:44,200
Speaker 0: the people who were winning voted to share victory with Scott Because it wasn't worth another two or three hours of our lives to destroy him.

777
00:52:44,421 --> 00:53:01,495
Speaker 1: I mean it would have been worth it if it was gonna be like, you know If someone who was close to scoring an individual victory on their own Might have been worth it to spend another hour to eliminate all remaining four players could have but to get basically 2/5 more victory divided amongst three people.

778
00:53:01,555 --> 00:53:04,104
Speaker 1: so two fifths divided So two eighths.

779
00:53:04,465 --> 00:53:08,420
Speaker 1: an extra court 25% of I don't know is not a lot of extra victory.

780
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:12,160
Speaker 0: But at the same time this is part of the reason why I think the game is in many ways brilliant.

781
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,614
Speaker 0: It just by us playing played out almost exactly the way World War one played.

782
00:53:17,855 --> 00:53:18,377
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

783
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:19,500
Speaker 0: It fought to a stalemate.

784
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:21,027
Speaker 0: Eventually, everybody gave up.

785
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:32,284
Speaker 0: there was there were some nominal winners and nominal losers But every single nation thought in their minds if I just had the chance to continue the war I would totally win.

786
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:34,333
Speaker 1: World War two is coming up soon.

787
00:53:34,353 --> 00:53:34,976
Speaker 1: Don't worry out.

788
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:35,699
Speaker 1: This is a sequel.

789
00:53:37,241 --> 00:53:38,425
Speaker 1: So the other thing that is.

790
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:39,889
Speaker 0: second problem with the game.

791
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:43,618
Speaker 1: Yep the rules suck are.

792
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:54,654
Speaker 0: just Say it took us about a turn to run into very difficult to resolve situations and in the instruction book They have all these different examples of things that can happen.

793
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:59,254
Speaker 1: that might cause you know Conflicts where you won't know what to do and it tells you what to do if they happen.

794
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:04,512
Speaker 1: the thing that happened Immediately was not in those rules and I was like what the fuck.

795
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:08,260
Speaker 1: there's so many possible Arad is here and ways to handle weird situations.

796
00:54:08,661 --> 00:54:16,519
Speaker 1: How did we so quickly in our first game on the second turn get a weird situation that is not in the book What the fuck and we didn't know what to do.

797
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,451
Speaker 1: So we just sort of you know, sort of figured.

798
00:54:18,532 --> 00:54:27,280
Speaker 1: we should you know Let it be a standstill because it sort of made sense and it probably that may have been very well The correct thing to do in that situation.

799
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:36,434
Speaker 1: But I can't be a hundred percent sure and that drives me crazy in a board game where I'm trying to figure out the rules And I don't have a solid answer puts an asterisk on the whole thing.

800
00:54:36,494 --> 00:54:37,799
Speaker 1: It's like ah, oh my god.

801
00:54:38,553 --> 00:54:42,231
Speaker 0: but To be fair every gamer should play.

802
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:43,215
Speaker 0: if you're a board gamer.

803
00:54:43,496 --> 00:54:44,420
Speaker 0: You should play diplomacy.

804
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,607
Speaker 1: You've got to know if you can find people who play with.

805
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:49,336
Speaker 0: you have got to get friends to play.

806
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:54,099
Speaker 0: get a full seven people Schedule a day and be like we're playing this motherfucking game.

807
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,080
Speaker 1: now A lot of people say it's like the friend killer.

808
00:54:56,461 --> 00:55:02,823
Speaker 1: Someone won't be friends with you blah blah blah and in a way that is you know at first, you know Before I played the game.

809
00:55:02,844 --> 00:55:10,129
Speaker 1: I was like, alright, you know anyone who thinks that obviously is such a shallow person About Illuminati.

810
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:16,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly You know, I thought it was like, okay, you say it as a joke, you know, but it's like I was playing the game.

811
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:19,260
Speaker 1: It was you know at times I was a little bit grumbly.

812
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:22,446
Speaker 0: It's just like uh, you know She always actually like.

813
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:26,765
Speaker 0: I think you felt a little betrayed because no one saw my betrayal coming which well I did I point out.

814
00:55:26,946 --> 00:55:33,560
Speaker 1: actually during that turn while you know I noticed that that was one turn where you had not let me see any part of your order sheet.

815
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:38,476
Speaker 1: Also, you were sort of looking around and poking and not saying much so I was like.

816
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:39,560
Speaker 1: I was guessing I'm like.

817
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:41,065
Speaker 1: Oh, is he gonna betray right now?

818
00:55:41,346 --> 00:55:43,373
Speaker 1: So when you did I wasn't at all surprised.

819
00:55:43,734 --> 00:55:45,380
Speaker 1: I was just sort of like oh he did.

820
00:55:45,605 --> 00:55:47,911
Speaker 1: Yeah Had to happen, but it wasn't that.

821
00:55:47,931 --> 00:55:49,340
Speaker 1: you know, I was grumbly before then.

822
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:56,061
Speaker 1: I just didn't because the game makes you feel grumbly because you're so ineffective all the time that it's not that you know It.

823
00:55:56,081 --> 00:55:58,580
Speaker 0: just prance and britain were terribly effective.

824
00:55:58,720 --> 00:55:59,824
Speaker 0: They were but I was.

825
00:55:59,844 --> 00:56:00,787
Speaker 1: no we weren't.

826
00:56:00,807 --> 00:56:06,010
Speaker 1: so I just the game can put you in an unpleasant mood very easily I would.

827
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:13,299
Speaker 1: I would do think though It's only a friend killer if you're really not friends to begin with yeah, and you're really immature and sad.

828
00:56:14,122 --> 00:56:17,895
Speaker 1: Another thing about the particular game that we played is we only had five people.

829
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:22,450
Speaker 0: because we someone Make it two ponies didn't show up.

830
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,617
Speaker 0: So one of the ponies really should have come.

831
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:26,884
Speaker 0: you would had a good time Yeah, so there are two.

832
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:32,498
Speaker 1: basically it when you don't have six people right only what Germany Italy's empty Italy.

833
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:35,480
Speaker 0: if you play six Players Italy is neutral and all its units.

834
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:36,330
Speaker 1: I think that would have been.

835
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,100
Speaker 1: that would have been okay.

836
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:43,320
Speaker 1: But the major problem was that Germany and Italy were both neutral with a five player game would have been fine.

837
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:53,069
Speaker 1: Except what happened was the unit the unified alliance of France and Britain went straight east and just destroyed Italy and Germany and swept them.

838
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:56,951
Speaker 1: but meanwhile Russia and Austria rim.

839
00:56:57,092 --> 00:56:59,347
Speaker 1: right day I went straight for you.

840
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:12,187
Speaker 1: they went straight for me in the bottom right corner Which made it much easier for France and England to come straight to the right unopposed and there wasn't anything pushing back on them Because nobody was playing as Germany or Italy.

841
00:57:12,668 --> 00:57:17,360
Speaker 1: as a result in over the first two turns they got significantly more power.

842
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,485
Speaker 0: No, they got their power.

843
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:20,795
Speaker 0: They didn't actually take Germany or Italy in that time.

844
00:57:21,076 --> 00:57:21,880
Speaker 0: They took it way later.

845
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:26,545
Speaker 0: They got all their power from taking Africa and Spain Yeah Which were completely empty.

846
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,153
Speaker 1: and you know no one was able to stop the baby.

847
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:31,382
Speaker 0: some pony had been able to get a fleet out There.

848
00:57:31,463 --> 00:57:31,645
Speaker 0: I was.

849
00:57:31,666 --> 00:57:32,800
Speaker 1: I supposed to get a fleet out there?

850
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,509
Speaker 1: I had to use my fleets to defend against you and Russia.

851
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:35,831
Speaker 1: you.

852
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:40,419
Speaker 0: I went down to get my fleet out there and your jackass Attacks from behind kept me from getting out.

853
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:52,250
Speaker 1: You might your attack my text from behind because you know if you just left your back unopened I wouldn't have taken it cuz I'm all honest and not evil, but I need to tell the third time To have my access out through the Adriatic Sea.

854
00:57:52,391 --> 00:57:53,053
Speaker 1: and this is the thing.

855
00:57:53,073 --> 00:57:59,433
Speaker 1: the geography of the game is real Geography is real geography, which makes it incredibly difficult and painful.

856
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:04,166
Speaker 1: quite often, you know and a lot of games Geography is often convenient.

857
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:08,640
Speaker 0: It's like alright you got geography is very convenient if you're Britain.

858
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:11,288
Speaker 1: But no think of a game like Vinci right and Vinci.

859
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:13,534
Speaker 1: the geography is often extremely convenient.

860
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,600
Speaker 1: It rarely causes you trouble, right?

861
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:24,270
Speaker 1: It's always like, you know some is better than others But it's like there's a mountain there when you need it to be a mountain and there's a. you know There's always a good spot right in diplomacy.

862
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:27,159
Speaker 1: There's only one spot and it's awful all the time.

863
00:58:27,822 --> 00:58:28,605
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that bad.

864
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:29,789
Speaker 0: I think it's just more realistic.

865
00:58:30,151 --> 00:58:30,391
Speaker 1: It is.

866
00:58:30,452 --> 00:58:31,476
Speaker 1: It's incredibly realistic.

867
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:39,020
Speaker 1: geography is awful Which is you know, the other games have maps where the geography is, you know designed for a game and is not awful.

868
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:45,457
Speaker 0: So at least in our game somewhat ironically Italy and Germany were partitioned by the greater powers.

869
00:58:46,039 --> 00:58:49,732
Speaker 0: Mmm I just found that kind of beautiful in a way.

870
00:58:49,752 --> 00:58:51,239
Speaker 0: It was really fun.

871
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:54,271
Speaker 0: as Exhausting as it was it was really fun.

872
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:55,700
Speaker 0: And I do want to play it again.

873
00:58:56,303 --> 00:58:57,368
Speaker 1: I think I would only play.

874
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,414
Speaker 0: I want to play what it has to be.

875
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,620
Speaker 1: seven has to be seven.

876
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,110
Speaker 1: I can't play with the five.

877
00:59:01,594 --> 00:59:02,742
Speaker 1: That's not gonna happen again I do.

878
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:04,337
Speaker 0: I want to play it at least one more time.

879
00:59:04,417 --> 00:59:04,680
Speaker 0: also.

880
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:11,860
Speaker 1: Person we do think it's fairest to choose your starting countries randomly, but I really did not like being Turkey.

881
00:59:12,502 --> 00:59:14,350
Speaker 0: I would have rather have been Turkey than Austria.

882
00:59:14,772 --> 00:59:16,640
Speaker 1: You probably also would not like to be Austria.

883
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,332
Speaker 0: I would much rather seven player game.

884
00:59:18,373 --> 00:59:19,320
Speaker 0: I would love to be Austria.

885
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:19,721
Speaker 1: I would.

886
00:59:19,782 --> 00:59:23,838
Speaker 0: I would much rather because I would ally with Germany and Italy and we just go all out.

887
00:59:23,898 --> 00:59:24,380
Speaker 0: That's possible.

888
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:26,380
Speaker 1: I would like to be France or Russia.

889
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:29,015
Speaker 1: If I had it, I wanted to be Russia or Britain.

890
00:59:29,035 --> 00:59:30,363
Speaker 0: to be honest Britain I might.

891
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:30,726
Speaker 1: I might.

892
00:59:30,888 --> 00:59:32,380
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind being you know, we could do this.

893
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,632
Speaker 1: I do sort of feel though that like Britain is just the opposite Turkey.

894
00:59:35,653 --> 00:59:37,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, here's how we do it.

895
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:38,952
Speaker 0: Everybody writes down the country.

896
00:59:38,972 --> 00:59:40,622
Speaker 0: They want to be Secretly.

897
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,385
Speaker 0: we reveal them.

898
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:48,439
Speaker 0: if no one else wrote the country where you want it you get it and then for the people who contend We set up a system where they can't get the one they wanted.

899
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:53,900
Speaker 1: So anyone who wrote down a country that someone else wrote down they have to write down another country.

900
00:59:53,940 --> 01:00:00,002
Speaker 0: They can't be the one they just wrote down two seconds ago Yep, and then we have to have an exception for it comes down to two people Coin.

901
01:00:00,224 --> 01:00:00,445
Speaker 1: Yeah.

902
01:00:00,646 --> 01:00:03,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that would work pretty well actually.

903
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:09,976
Speaker 1: But if it comes down to two people that means it's two free countries Unless they both want the same one, which is maybe unlikely who knows.

904
01:00:10,578 --> 01:00:13,060
Speaker 1: but yeah, definitely I would only play again with seven people.

905
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:13,784
Speaker 0: So what I'm gonna do?

906
01:00:13,804 --> 01:00:16,276
Speaker 1: one probably said there aren't all these easy pickings.

907
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:18,284
Speaker 1: and the worst part I think what made it more frustrating?

908
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:19,308
Speaker 1: or is it being Turkey?

909
01:00:20,171 --> 01:00:22,419
Speaker 1: all the easy pickings were not adjacent to me.

910
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:23,442
Speaker 0: They were.

911
01:00:23,743 --> 01:00:24,986
Speaker 0: if you'd gotten a fleet out.

912
01:00:25,347 --> 01:00:30,500
Speaker 1: No, I had to I would have had to go through you to get to Italy or tunis.

913
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:31,844
Speaker 1: That's not.

914
01:00:31,904 --> 01:00:34,840
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about the easy pickings that were just empty land.

915
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:38,967
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the easy pickings of Italy in Germany were not that easy But they weren't you.

916
01:00:39,027 --> 01:00:41,398
Speaker 1: you were adjacent to them and I couldn't get there.

917
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:41,720
Speaker 1: You know what?

918
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:43,244
Speaker 0: To attack them.

919
01:00:44,088 --> 01:00:50,051
Speaker 0: Well France and UK sure did yeah later After they'd already conquered the entire Western world.

920
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:50,653
Speaker 0: Yeah.

921
01:00:50,954 --> 01:00:52,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, well anyway, yeah.

922
01:00:53,443 --> 01:00:57,176
Speaker 0: But I think what I'm gonna do is I posted a link to the that online diplomacy.

923
01:00:57,217 --> 01:00:58,040
Speaker 0: that looks pretty good.

924
01:00:58,623 --> 01:01:10,960
Speaker 0: So after I sort out a bunch of geek nights work I have to do I'm gonna start up a seven player play by Internet game with like 48 hours for turns or something like something ludicrous.

925
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,620
Speaker 0: It'll be a long-term game where everyone who wants to play can play idly.

926
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,649
Speaker 1: I think that'll work better than what.

927
01:01:16,749 --> 01:01:17,472
Speaker 1: what's that other game?

928
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:19,260
Speaker 1: We played Neptune's pride.

929
01:01:19,481 --> 01:01:22,779
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, is Neptune's pride was a lot of how often do you check it?

930
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,786
Speaker 1: And it was a lot of numbers.

931
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,120
Speaker 0: God Johnson always would brilliantly attack people at like 3 in the morning.

932
01:01:28,562 --> 01:01:30,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that is the one thing about diplomacy right?

933
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:37,440
Speaker 1: is other games You know give you the option to ally or think, you know make deals and things like that.

934
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:37,821
Speaker 1: Right.

935
01:01:37,961 --> 01:01:39,446
Speaker 1: and or trade.

936
01:01:39,647 --> 01:01:43,720
Speaker 1: and you know, like risk or you know, shogun samurai sword shogun.

937
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,925
Speaker 0: Well, remember there's two kinds of games.

938
01:01:44,945 --> 01:01:47,937
Speaker 0: There are cooperative games where deals are a part of the game like dune.

939
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:53,551
Speaker 0: Yep, and Those are not that realistic from a war standpoint.

940
01:01:53,611 --> 01:01:56,580
Speaker 0: They're only realistic if you're doing like a commerce simulation

941
01:01:57,262 --> 01:01:57,382
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

942
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:13,939
Speaker 0: but non cooperative games like risk where there's no way to make a binding deal are More fun and more realistic from certain perspectives, but at the same time Because it's a game and not the real world Everyone's gonna get their ass betrayed in the end.

943
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:16,210
Speaker 1: Well, the thing with Rick the thing is right.

944
01:02:16,231 --> 01:02:23,776
Speaker 1: so dune has binding deals Right, which means that you use the in-game mechanics to enforce your alliances is a cooperative game.

945
01:02:23,796 --> 01:02:25,040
Speaker 1: You don't need to diplomacy.

946
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,020
Speaker 1: You don't need to actually do real diplomacy stuff, right?

947
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,467
Speaker 1: You don't need to because it's in the game.

948
01:02:29,507 --> 01:02:30,331
Speaker 1: the worm comes up.

949
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,020
Speaker 1: You can ally with someone and you're good.

950
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:36,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not really diplomacy if you can prove that what you're doing is what you did.

951
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,326
Speaker 1: Yes at the same time risk.

952
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:45,544
Speaker 1: while you can make deals freeform and risk the same way you do in diplomacy and they're non binding You can enforce.

953
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:48,293
Speaker 1: basically there's a numbers game in risk that beats.

954
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:50,520
Speaker 1: that totally dominates any deals that you make.

955
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:54,800
Speaker 1: So it doesn't merely matter what deals you make in risk because numbers win.

956
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,545
Speaker 1: I got ten friggin units here.

957
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:59,153
Speaker 1: You got one that doesn't deals.

958
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:01,500
Speaker 1: don't matter because I could win just with the game mechanics.

959
01:03:01,683 --> 01:03:02,458
Speaker 1: I don't need to win.

960
01:03:02,881 --> 01:03:15,580
Speaker 0: Well more importantly means that if I want to enforce deals I have to one be a shrewd diplomat and to Have the ability to enforce the deals or punish people who renege on the deals within the context of the game.

961
01:03:15,921 --> 01:03:19,448
Speaker 0: Yes, like if I make a deal with Scott like we are now a double Alliance.

962
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:21,092
Speaker 0: We're going to do X and Scott betrays me.

963
01:03:21,112 --> 01:03:28,220
Speaker 0: I Or convince the rest of the world to help me like sanction him.

964
01:03:28,574 --> 01:03:32,509
Speaker 1: Yeah but in diplomacy Right because every all units are equal.

965
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:36,320
Speaker 1: so you can't win with the game mechanics alone and the deals are non binding.

966
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:44,866
Speaker 1: You actually have to legitimately actually convince people in the real world for real in order to make any progress Which few other games have that?

967
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:56,280
Speaker 0: or you have to not convince them but can but have trick them into thinking That you have convinced that you have to think that you have convinced them when really, you know They're going to betray you and you betray them what basically by any means necessary.

968
01:03:56,441 --> 01:03:58,891
Speaker 1: You need to get them to write orders on their order sheet.

969
01:03:58,911 --> 01:04:01,221
Speaker 1: that are the orders that you want them to write on their order Sheet.

970
01:04:01,282 --> 01:04:09,149
Speaker 0: no matter what that means is and I also know several times Multiple people cocked up complicated orders.

971
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:13,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is actually pretty accurate to real warfare, especially in that era.

972
01:04:13,261 --> 01:04:17,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, Napoleon tells Marat to go somewhere and that's the wrong place.

973
01:04:17,616 --> 01:04:18,860
Speaker 1: Well, I'm the wrong place.

974
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:28,380
Speaker 1: At the same, you know, it's it reminds me a lot of traders of Genoa now just called Genoa Which is a game where you can trade anything for anything, you know.

975
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,780
Speaker 1: There's a lot of games that have trading like settlers, you know encoded in the rules.

976
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:36,116
Speaker 1: But in trades of Genoa, you can trade anything for anything using any means you want.

977
01:04:36,156 --> 01:04:48,958
Speaker 1: you can make futures markets You can you can come up with any scheme you want and do it which is you know sort of like diplomacy where you can diplomacy in any way you want and There's not too many games that actually pull that off very well.

978
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,783
Speaker 1: So diplomacy.

979
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:51,264
Speaker 0: Yep.

980
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:55,958
Speaker 0: It's it's a game that you should play especially if you have an interest in game theory World War one.

981
01:04:55,998 --> 01:04:57,768
Speaker 1: diplomacy Yeah, it's very.

982
01:04:57,808 --> 01:04:59,560
Speaker 1: it's a very important game historically.

983
01:05:00,621 --> 01:05:09,649
Speaker 1: You shouldn't I don't know how if you should, you know invest a whole bunch of your life into it But you should definitely play it once or twice learn about it Know the rules as much as they can be known.

984
01:05:09,749 --> 01:05:11,557
Speaker 0: some people do some people get way into it.

985
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:19,379
Speaker 1: There's some people do Huge Tournaments, but you know, it's important to know, you know the way that you know, Star Wars is important for a film person to know.

986
01:05:26,265 --> 01:05:28,800
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
