1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,231
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020.

2
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:12,672
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,394 --> 00:00:15,499
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,417
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about among us Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:32,098
Speaker 1: So some relatively late-breaking news that we debated talking about on the show Partly because we don't have a second source on this.

6
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:37,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is reported by some tiny website running like WordPress.

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,441
Speaker 0: yeah,

8
00:00:37,742 --> 00:00:38,605
Speaker 1: it was reported

9
00:00:38,706 --> 00:01:01,380
Speaker 0: four days ago, and I only saw it just now on reddit and There's no like proof here, it's just someone writing a convincing story, I don't know what the deal is But if it's true, I guess it's You know worth talking about but I just have almost no confidence that this is true.

10
00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,205
Speaker 1: Yep, so full disclosure.

11
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:13,600
Speaker 1: There's a single source that we do not recognize on this but the news They have broken is that Pac South has dates ready?

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,299
Speaker 1: Alternate dates replacing the original dates, but those dates are in late February so pushing the con out only a little bit.

13
00:01:23,282 --> 00:01:25,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's basically like that.

14
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:35,560
Speaker 0: what they're saying is that Pac South has moved already moved to late February And if for some reason it can't actually happen then they've got some backup dates, and they'll push it back again and again.

15
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:45,712
Speaker 0: But like it's basically that the actual news is they really want to have Pac South In 2021 and they're gonna try to actually have it and not cancel it.

16
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:57,379
Speaker 1: yep now you can read look at this article, but basically Even if Like 2021 like kovat gets better the trajectory is not looking good.

17
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:07,745
Speaker 1: I can't imagine any con happening safely until like August September at the earliest next year barring like Miracles.

18
00:02:08,368 --> 00:02:20,660
Speaker 0: yeah, they're discussing the perhaps two lacks You know Guidelines in Texas you know basically making it legal for it to happen even though it may not be advisable.

19
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:34,384
Speaker 1: I can tell you I sure as hell ain't going about what thing I mean Blonde if there is a Pac South in February of next year there is zero chance that geek nights will attend this packs regardless of not a Things.

20
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:35,328
Speaker 1: they say we will.

21
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:41,934
Speaker 0: we will record a video of a panel that you can play in a room yep But there is no way and I would honestly at the start of which video.

22
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,280
Speaker 0: We will say everyone who's there.

23
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,539
Speaker 0: Why are you risking your lives to see us leave?

24
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:50,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would urge especially because this article talks about how and it seems to link to the Texas stuff.

25
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:56,437
Speaker 1: Texas has these ideas around like a certain capacity limit on large venues.

26
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,280
Speaker 1: that makes it safer.

27
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,088
Speaker 1: That is not safe.

28
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,278
Speaker 1: do not trust, Texas on this?

29
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:04,995
Speaker 1: nope Texas does not have a good track record in regard to kovat.

30
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:08,971
Speaker 1: if you're not paying You don't say I mean frankly.

31
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,734
Speaker 1: I'm already assuming.

32
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:10,980
Speaker 1: There's no packs East next year.

33
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,988
Speaker 1: So if there's no packs East there's definitely no pack South.

34
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:26,260
Speaker 1: if there is a pack South and no packs East and that's do solely to Texas having Dangerous and lax safety rules, then that's just egregious and frankly penny arcade to shut the whole thing down.

35
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,577
Speaker 1: They shouldn't allow the tax out to proceed like contracts.

36
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:31,966
Speaker 1: be damned Mm-hmm.

37
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,595
Speaker 1: because let's be real.

38
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:39,974
Speaker 1: best-case scenario There is a vaccine by the end of 2020 until a huge percentage of the population has it.

39
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,019
Speaker 0: that doesn't seem like that seems.

40
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,480
Speaker 0: that seems an unrealistic.

41
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,539
Speaker 1: if unrealistic scenario then My very difficult lift on top of that already unrealistic scenario.

42
00:03:53,701 --> 00:04:06,740
Speaker 1: So either This will be announced officially in the coming weeks, and then we're going to talk about how GNN has some fucking sources Just or just has local, Texas source.

43
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,129
Speaker 1: There's something up with GNN and we'll talk about that.

44
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:16,714
Speaker 0: and if this is not or anyone would be with basic journalism could have found This out, but they but no one bothered because it's not.

45
00:04:16,896 --> 00:04:29,939
Speaker 1: that could be true because one thing there aren't a lot of journalists on the will pack South happen beat we Don't do a lot of investigative journalism We never really have but we do even less now than we used to like a decade ago.

46
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:47,320
Speaker 1: but The last time this was a topic that got seriously talked about was when people were trying to figure out the dates of things like Paxis to get hotel rooms and Investigative journalism did in fact uncover like a decade's worth of paxi states that have been a hundred percent legit up to this point.

47
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,023
Speaker 1: So you're right.

48
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:49,786
Speaker 1: It could just be that.

49
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,774
Speaker 1: No one thought to look at this.

50
00:04:51,815 --> 00:04:54,918
Speaker 1: cuz packs South hotels Don't sell out like they never sell out.

51
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,443
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean a lot of the time.

52
00:04:56,524 --> 00:05:01,831
Speaker 0: the word investigative journalism simply means there's a question that a lot of people want to know the answer to.

53
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:04,230
Speaker 0: And it's not just.

54
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:15,671
Speaker 0: the answer isn't just out there and Somebody went through the hassle of actually calling someone on the phone who knows the answer and told everyone else the answer Like one year man, like three or four mag fests ago.

55
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:26,196
Speaker 1: I remember I figured out the dates by calling a bunch of hotels and Asking about the mag fest room block acting like I was some business person and they would.

56
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,480
Speaker 1: they transferred me to someone.

57
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,087
Speaker 0: Well, that's not journalism.

58
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:37,520
Speaker 1: That's In the service of journalism, but I will full disclosure.

59
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:41,599
Speaker 1: I booked my hotel for that mag fest before I broke that news.

60
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,108
Speaker 0: Sure, that's only.

61
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,055
Speaker 0: that's just common sense.

62
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:57,840
Speaker 1: Yeah so yeah, we'll see how this goes, but There's no way packed south is happening next year Because if they push it out until the later half of the year it overlaps with other paxis and I just feel like that doesn't.

63
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:14,145
Speaker 0: The point is if this turns out to be true you should add this tiny tiny website geek news now to your follows because almost no one follows it which makes me not trust it, but if Fewer Twitter followers than that Ozzy Mandy's account I stopped updating.

64
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:21,516
Speaker 0: if it turns out to not be true You should block this account and this website so, you know not to accidentally read the fake news that's on it.

65
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:22,720
Speaker 1: Yep, so we'll see.

66
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:26,259
Speaker 1: If any of you are watching a live stream you got to see us do.

67
00:06:26,299 --> 00:06:29,055
Speaker 1: our editorial decision on whether or not we're even gonna talk about this.

68
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:33,697
Speaker 0: I Mean we provided the context that this is, you know, some bullshit website says this.

69
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:37,790
Speaker 1: Yep So in some other news that is more normal news.

70
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:42,742
Speaker 1: If you've been watching twitch, I assume you're on Microblock.

71
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,870
Speaker 1: are you block as a lot of people refer to it.

72
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,560
Speaker 1: ad blocker because you don't want to see ads origin.

73
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,480
Speaker 1: Yeah origin other things called you block are not necessarily says you block and you block origin.

74
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,106
Speaker 0: You only use you black origin.

75
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,712
Speaker 0: do not use regular old you block.

76
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:03,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've talked on Monday episodes about how Untrusted ad blockers are actually very dangerous to you due to the nature of what you do.

77
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:05,019
Speaker 1: They see everything you're looking at.

78
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:11,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can trust me you block origin because it's all open source and everyone's looking at it all the time.

79
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:22,420
Speaker 0: But basically you have to be very careful if you add extra filters to it that are written by untrusted sources Because you know make sure that you trust those right before you go messing around.

80
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:31,140
Speaker 1: Yep, so if you now I don't actually watch a lot of twitch these days I've realized I was thinking about why I didn't notice this till I saw the news and heard you complaining about it.

81
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:41,220
Speaker 1: I pretty much watch VODs after the fact on YouTube where I don't see ads anyway, but Twitch ads are terrifyingly annoying but ad blockers block those ads.

82
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:52,180
Speaker 1: Twitch is not only Attacking the ad blockers to force ads through but the ads they're forcing through are basically PSA like they're trying to specifically?

83
00:07:53,464 --> 00:07:54,900
Speaker 0: That's not exactly what is it?

84
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,542
Speaker 1: They're trying to.

85
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,293
Speaker 1: they're running the ads more often according to this article.

86
00:07:58,615 --> 00:07:59,940
Speaker 1: then normal ads roll.

87
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:03,000
Speaker 0: No, so here's what happened first, right?

88
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,739
Speaker 0: Twitch was doing an experiment with mid roll ads which is the worst thing in the universe.

89
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:17,960
Speaker 0: because Right a man, you know, if you're watching say like live sports or something and there's a this ads There's a lot of them, but they stopped playing the sport to run the ad.

90
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:28,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're watching a stream and like I just an ad is played by twitch and is not instant Initiated by the streamer that you're just missing what's happening.

91
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,178
Speaker 0: You're just missing the action and then it comes back and you missed a minute of whatever was happening or to who knows what.

92
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:33,620
Speaker 0: that's awful.

93
00:08:34,368 --> 00:08:37,562
Speaker 0: They stopped doing that They Have.

94
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:41,760
Speaker 0: what they have been doing is just fighting with ad blockers, right?

95
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,506
Speaker 0: So there are pre-roll ads on twitch.

96
00:08:43,547 --> 00:08:50,465
Speaker 0: if you're not subscribed to a channel and you're not paying for twitch turbo Which is nine bucks a month You see pre-roll ads.

97
00:08:50,485 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaker 0: so you go to a stream and an ad will play and then the ad will be done.

98
00:08:55,764 --> 00:09:11,090
Speaker 0: And then if you see ads after that the only ads you will see after that are ads that are part of the stream itself because the streamer is Showing ads through OBS or the streamer has pressed a button to tell twitch to play an ad to make them some money, right?

99
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:21,146
Speaker 0: So what happened was recent, you know, there have been a few times, you know Once like a couple months ago where it's like hey, I got you block origin, but I'm seeing the pre-roll ad.

100
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:21,627
Speaker 0: what the hell.

101
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,152
Speaker 0: so You?

102
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:36,096
Speaker 0: what you do when that happens is you can wait for an update and just deal with it Or you can go to the you block origin reddit where people are like, hey Here's the rule that you can add to your Steps to remove the ad.

103
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:37,522
Speaker 0: so we did those steps and it worked.

104
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:42,822
Speaker 0: and then just like last week There was another situation ads are back and everyone panics.

105
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:44,830
Speaker 0: So it's like alright do these steps.

106
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:46,817
Speaker 0: And we did those steps.

107
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:56,590
Speaker 0: and what was happening was first We did those steps removed the pre-roll ad but then mid-roll ads started to play, right?

108
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,279
Speaker 0: Which we thought twitch had stopped doing.

109
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,390
Speaker 0: right because it was just like an experiment that failed.

110
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:09,410
Speaker 1: I mean mineral ads are definitely coming everywhere because ad revenue is not doing well And people are desperate to milk that ad money before the whole bubble collapses, right?

111
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:17,832
Speaker 0: So there was so technological battle between the people trying to make an you block origin rule to stop that the ads and twitch itself.

112
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:33,302
Speaker 0: so the current state of things is that if you Go and you you set the best the best thing that they have managed to build to fight twitch ads is Some code that will stop the pre-roll ad entirely.

113
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:38,595
Speaker 0: However, what will happen is every 15 20 minutes or so.

114
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:41,663
Speaker 1: 10 to 20 minutes is what people have researched by studying it.

115
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:44,010
Speaker 0: right twitch will display.

116
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:48,840
Speaker 0: It's not an ad it's this still image with text that says it.

117
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,550
Speaker 0: basically they've detected sort of like cheating detection in a video game.

118
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:58,974
Speaker 0: They've detected that you've messed with the JavaScript on twitch itself And they stop.

119
00:10:59,034 --> 00:10:59,174
Speaker 0: they.

120
00:10:59,194 --> 00:11:00,358
Speaker 0: basically you don't see the stream.

121
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:08,457
Speaker 0: you see this purple page with white text in the video area for like You know 30 seconds to a minute, you know The amount of time a mid-roll ad would take.

122
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,310
Speaker 0: and it's like saying hey you've you know got software or something.

123
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,545
Speaker 0: That's you know, I can read the exact message, but whatever.

124
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:19,726
Speaker 0: but it basically says hey You've done something to mess with the performance of Twitter.

125
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:20,530
Speaker 1: Thanks for watching.

126
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,844
Speaker 1: You may be using a third-party tool or browser extension that is impacting site performance.

127
00:11:25,065 --> 00:11:28,496
Speaker 1: for the best twitch experience head over to Twitch.tv to support the stream.

128
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:29,941
Speaker 0: right exactly.

129
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:37,310
Speaker 0: So they've detected that you're doing some shady biz And they're annoying you to make you stop using adblock, right?

130
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,290
Speaker 0: So, I mean if you go to twitch normally you're gonna see a pre-roll ad and then you're not gonna see anything after that.

131
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,635
Speaker 0: That's just right.

132
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:48,370
Speaker 0: So but if you try to block the pre-roll ad you're gonna get this bullshit.

133
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,165
Speaker 0: So what the tool that's been developed that that's the best we can do.

134
00:11:52,306 --> 00:12:03,735
Speaker 0: as of this recording Blocks the pre-roll ad and then detects when the purple thing appears and auto reloads the page or cuz Just or you can just press ctrl R. So you're gonna.

135
00:12:03,796 --> 00:12:08,522
Speaker 0: if that if you have this set up You're gonna miss like one or two seconds of the stream.

136
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,530
Speaker 0: basically how long it takes you to press ctrl R.

137
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,640
Speaker 1: So here's here's a sort of very interesting point at least for me.

138
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,409
Speaker 1: in my experience and my just preference.

139
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:29,303
Speaker 1: if the choice was see any ad at any point or See a non ad screen that just blocks me for a while every now and then I'd rather see the non ad screen like when I watch up here, but you give me what we don't want to.

140
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:30,169
Speaker 0: we don't want to write.

141
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,665
Speaker 0: But the problem with the non ad screen is not that it's an ad it's not.

142
00:12:33,705 --> 00:12:34,650
Speaker 0: you're missing the stream.

143
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:48,770
Speaker 0: So the other thing that people have done is there are various sites out there you can use which Rather than watching the thing on twitch you actually because you can embed a twitch stream in another site.

144
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:54,390
Speaker 0: Right, so if you watch an embed the embed doesn't have ads it's an embed.

145
00:12:55,434 --> 00:13:00,461
Speaker 0: The problem is if you're watching an embed Then you lose out on all the other twitch stuff.

146
00:13:00,481 --> 00:13:01,705
Speaker 0: You're not in the twitch chat.

147
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:05,274
Speaker 0: You're not you know, you can't Sub you can't?

148
00:13:05,515 --> 00:13:05,776
Speaker 0: you know?

149
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:10,576
Speaker 0: if there's maybe like a crowd control thing going on You can't do that right because you're.

150
00:13:10,676 --> 00:13:19,650
Speaker 0: you're just watching the video itself embedded on another website But you won't see the ad the pre-roll or the mid-roll or any kind of ads ever and you don't even need a block now.

151
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:27,885
Speaker 1: I think we're burying the lead here though, because I think the the real story is that Twitch suddenly got aggressive against ad blocking.

152
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:28,728
Speaker 1: We're pretty early.

153
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,636
Speaker 0: That is Actually going on YouTube's.

154
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,603
Speaker 0: we had block which is now battling.

155
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:35,490
Speaker 0: twitch is battling with with the ad.

156
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,897
Speaker 1: That is not a good sign for twitches.

157
00:13:37,977 --> 00:13:38,980
Speaker 1: financial security.

158
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:42,150
Speaker 0: There is a war going on between twitch and ad blocking.

159
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:50,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, someone like a chief revenue officer someone in twitch is either nervous about their revenue numbers nervous about ad trends.

160
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:59,987
Speaker 1: there's some fiscal reason why twitch is doing this because this kills goodwill with users of twitch with fans of twitch and It doesn't make that much more money.

161
00:14:01,155 --> 00:14:03,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, you know if you think about it, right?

162
00:14:04,212 --> 00:14:08,468
Speaker 0: You know twitch wants to make money also from things like subs, right?

163
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:12,286
Speaker 0: It's like well You know, it's like usually.

164
00:14:12,327 --> 00:14:17,530
Speaker 0: it's like hey I get my free prime sub right and maybe I'll sub someone if I watch them a lot.

165
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:19,570
Speaker 0: But also there's people who gift subs, right?

166
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:25,367
Speaker 0: So yeah, basically if you force ads and that's the only way other than not buying twitch turbo.

167
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:26,210
Speaker 0: You can fuck that nonsense.

168
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:32,447
Speaker 1: So I mean, I've already migrated to watching VODs on YouTube where I don't see ads anyway, right exactly.

169
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:38,953
Speaker 0: So If you're gonna do that, it's like well, I guess I'm only gonna watch twitch channels I'm subscribed to.

170
00:14:38,973 --> 00:14:39,494
Speaker 0: right.

171
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:47,380
Speaker 0: if I can't if I know ad block mechanism will work, which means I'm gonna watch less twitch I'll probably stop subscribing and stop watching twitch altogether.

172
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and now you're losing that actual Five to ten dollars a month.

173
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,490
Speaker 0: for that's you know, I guess some of it's going just the streamers most of it.

174
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,012
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

175
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:05,186
Speaker 1: I'd actually don't know what the split is on the five dreamers get at least as of the journalism on the verge right now in this article from today.

176
00:15:05,568 --> 00:15:11,143
Speaker 1: they get 350 three dollars and fifty cents per thousand 350 for the streamer and 150 for twitch.

177
00:15:11,564 --> 00:15:13,309
Speaker 0: when you find you spend five on a sub.

178
00:15:14,032 --> 00:15:15,519
Speaker 1: No, this is per ad view.

179
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:16,644
Speaker 1: The ad view money is 350 per.

180
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:22,902
Speaker 0: They do not spend five dollars on a sub.

181
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,970
Speaker 0: how much goes to the streamer versus twitch?

182
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't list they don't get.

183
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:27,890
Speaker 0: the streamer doesn't get all five dollars?

184
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:32,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course not because twitch has got to make money and which is sole way to make money.

185
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:32,950
Speaker 1: is all this nonsense?

186
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:37,062
Speaker 0: But that's gonna make me watch twitch less which is gonna make right.

187
00:15:37,162 --> 00:15:43,908
Speaker 0: it's like well if I'm not watching or from blocking ads You're actually making less money here because you have this other revenue stream.

188
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:53,350
Speaker 1: Yeah It's just fascinating because like if this was geek nights Monday what we'd stress time and time again Is that blocking ads is an info information security issue?

189
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:00,515
Speaker 1: Never look at an ad on a device of any kind because ads are the primary vector of malware Mm-hmm reform out.

190
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:01,217
Speaker 1: It's a way bed.

191
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:05,048
Speaker 1: Like you should never let ads on block all head everywhere.

192
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:10,468
Speaker 0: always There is no circumstance in which you should see an ad that you could have blocked.

193
00:16:10,488 --> 00:16:18,841
Speaker 1: Yep And it's interesting because the moral and ethical discussion around that would be that Some people who block ads or who have ads blocked for them.

194
00:16:19,283 --> 00:16:28,441
Speaker 1: A good example is a lot of very old people are sort of tricked by advertising and buy things they wouldn't have already all otherwise bought and Shouldn't have bought.

195
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:32,683
Speaker 1: like that's one Avenue And the other Avenue is I'm never gonna buy anything from an ad.

196
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:33,707
Speaker 1: don't show me an ad.

197
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:37,964
Speaker 1: if you show No, if the ad makes it to me, you've ripped off the advertiser.

198
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:40,709
Speaker 1: if the ad doesn't make it to me You've only ripped off the platform.

199
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:43,166
Speaker 0: There's a lot of times where I'll see.

200
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:47,079
Speaker 0: you know I'll be forced to see an ad somehow and even it there.

201
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:57,399
Speaker 0: even cases where I'm forced to see an ad and I think oh That's actually something I might have bought but you know what because I saw it in an ad fuck you I'm not buying it at a site.

202
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,130
Speaker 1: I have a negative perception of something.

203
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,404
Speaker 1: I said if an ad it's not if I see an ad like on the street as much.

204
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:07,161
Speaker 1: but if an ad makes it Through my carefully curated ad blocking ecosystem.

205
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,769
Speaker 1: That means they're trying to annoy me and I'm done with them.

206
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:11,981
Speaker 0: Yep, I saw like.

207
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:18,813
Speaker 0: I saw an ad for like Like a cast-iron that was that looked as good as the the cruise it won But was cheaper.

208
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:19,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was like.

209
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,390
Speaker 0: I was like, ooh that the ad makes it look good.

210
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:23,221
Speaker 0: But I was like, you know what?

211
00:17:23,403 --> 00:17:26,704
Speaker 0: Hell no You bought an ad and I couldn't block it.

212
00:17:27,027 --> 00:17:27,589
Speaker 0: go fuck yourself.

213
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:33,187
Speaker 1: so keep an eye on twitch and like how well they're doing financially over the next six months.

214
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:40,369
Speaker 1: because this is a Doing fine because Amazon Amazon Amazon just props it up exactly and that's the question of how long will Amazon prop it up.

215
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,834
Speaker 1: What not?

216
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:44,482
Speaker 0: maybe anti-trust mixer mixer went down.

217
00:17:44,603 --> 00:17:46,870
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's really just tracing YouTube.

218
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,967
Speaker 0: You know how Facebook gaming isn't doing anything right shreds.

219
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:54,400
Speaker 1: you say Yeah Well, how's the friend Facebook doing?

220
00:17:55,104 --> 00:17:56,190
Speaker 1: the shreds you send?

221
00:17:57,532 --> 00:17:59,968
Speaker 1: All right, really briefly just a quick geeky bite.

222
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:03,310
Speaker 1: We'll review this game someday in the future when we're desperate for a Tuesday show.

223
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:05,163
Speaker 1: But you know, we play those train games.

224
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:05,949
Speaker 1: We reviewed a bunch of them.

225
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:17,542
Speaker 1: we just played our first game of 18 mechs, which is the railways of Mexico and it's super fun and Very different in some regards from all the train games.

226
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:18,989
Speaker 1: We have played up to this point.

227
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:29,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've played a lot of train games they've had you know this they all have, you know the base similarities But this one had a couple of mechanics that were not present.

228
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:30,812
Speaker 0: in the other ones You played.

229
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:34,110
Speaker 0: so like rule you look at the rule book and it's pretty much like yeah play train game.

230
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,530
Speaker 0: Here's a couple differences, but those couple differences had a large impact on play.

231
00:18:39,353 --> 00:18:41,061
Speaker 0: So there's quite a bit to talk about with them.

232
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:42,810
Speaker 0: There's a. there's a big company merger.

233
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,659
Speaker 0: There's mail money that everyone gets automatically.

234
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,445
Speaker 0: the the villages are free.

235
00:18:47,506 --> 00:18:51,408
Speaker 1: on your train route, you know There's no big diesel that has an unlimited route.

236
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:56,710
Speaker 1: instead You have a weird diesel that goes to fewer stations than the sixth train.

237
00:18:57,131 --> 00:19:01,807
Speaker 0: But double revenue from those like a luxury short-range train is the best train you can get.

238
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:02,148
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:07,430
Speaker 1: Yep So anyway, it's a. it's a different train game from what we've played.

240
00:19:07,751 --> 00:19:17,750
Speaker 1: And what I would say is that if you have played any of the 18xx games We've talked about and you liked them, but you want something that's very different from what you've played up to this point.

241
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:25,030
Speaker 1: I think 18mex is the one you dive into right now because it's the most different from the ones we have already reviewed on geek nights.

242
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,226
Speaker 0: Yeah that we've played.

243
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:37,359
Speaker 1: Yep And but I would definitely not play this one first if you have not played at least 1889 or 1846 This you would.

244
00:19:37,701 --> 00:19:43,490
Speaker 1: there's trouble in this one If you haven't played another train game before and you also won't appreciate the things that are weird.

245
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:54,557
Speaker 1: Like if you play this one and go to those other games You'll actually put yourself in a weird position and probably be worse at train games, I think Yeah, that's really what I have to say about it.

246
00:19:54,638 --> 00:20:02,439
Speaker 1: But the reason I bring it up is that we're all stuck at home because of COVID and 18mex is implemented on 18xx.games.

247
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:04,445
Speaker 1: You can play it legit online with your friends.

248
00:20:04,466 --> 00:20:05,128
Speaker 1: They synchronously.

249
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:09,343
Speaker 0: it just works Mm-hmm, and I will teach you how to play train games for free.

250
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:11,532
Speaker 0: if you want to know how to play train games He's done it.

251
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,137
Speaker 1: They're the listener.

252
00:20:13,218 --> 00:20:17,010
Speaker 1: Well, one of the listener has played a few games with us and it's been a fun time.

253
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,210
Speaker 0: Yeah So I guess other minor geek bite because it's way too much to discuss.

254
00:20:23,492 --> 00:20:25,630
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna try to summarize it quickly.

255
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,648
Speaker 0: But you know Resident Evil has been like this major game series, right and I've never thought of myself as like.

256
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,137
Speaker 0: oh man I love Resident Evil.

257
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,790
Speaker 0: I'm a big Resident Evil fan, but you know what?

258
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:41,108
Speaker 0: I played Resident Evil 4 on the GameCube, right and then I just I think I played five like in one shot.

259
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:43,749
Speaker 1: at some point I feel like I watched you play most of four.

260
00:20:44,832 --> 00:20:45,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

261
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:47,751
Speaker 0: and then I think I played six and seven Like.

262
00:20:47,771 --> 00:20:51,189
Speaker 0: I just played them and forgot about them like but I did beat them, right?

263
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:54,770
Speaker 0: And I had played one but I never beat one.

264
00:20:54,991 --> 00:21:00,490
Speaker 0: So recently since there's all kinds of cheapness on Steam and two and three got remade, right?

265
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,043
Speaker 0: I basically have every Resident Evil game on Steam.

266
00:21:03,063 --> 00:21:04,309
Speaker 0: now every single one the whole thing.

267
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:10,261
Speaker 0: So I went and I actually beat one And I've been streaming these on the geek nights discord that you should come.

268
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:11,464
Speaker 0: Yeah to come see.

269
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:17,439
Speaker 0: and then I just beat two And now I'm playing three and I'm quite a bit of ways into three.

270
00:21:18,061 --> 00:21:20,890
Speaker 0: So there's a lot to say about them, right?

271
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,708
Speaker 0: I'm only playing the remade ones.

272
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:28,710
Speaker 1: I think the most stellar review of them is the fact that you are actually playing remakes of these old games.

273
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:32,384
Speaker 0: I feel like if I remake makes the old ones are so janky.

274
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're basically unplay it.

275
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:42,239
Speaker 0: Like Resident Evil 2 the original PlayStation game had like tank controls like like friggin You know twin stick, right?

276
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,429
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, this one actually newer ones there.

277
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:54,793
Speaker 1: Yes Yes I know a lot of us Ludo types like game people like to talk about how those tank controls are actually a disempowerment fantasy as opposed to an empowerment fantasy Etc, etc.

278
00:21:55,074 --> 00:22:03,590
Speaker 1: at the same time that disempowerment was largely a product of the technology at its time And there are intentional ways to do that better with modern technology.

279
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:08,072
Speaker 0: point is you know Playing them.

280
00:22:08,172 --> 00:22:10,400
Speaker 0: I'm not like, you know, I'm basically like sort of like.

281
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:14,193
Speaker 0: my play style is like rush through them on normal mode Right, you're not.

282
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:17,810
Speaker 1: you're not like looking for every fiddly little thing and like full.

283
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:22,350
Speaker 0: I mean, I liked I collect all the ammo and the health and I try to open up all this stuff, you know.

284
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,117
Speaker 0: But it's like Resident Evil 2.

285
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:25,101
Speaker 0: I missed a lot of stuff.

286
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,024
Speaker 0: and also these games.

287
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,470
Speaker 0: they give you like two characters.

288
00:22:27,591 --> 00:22:29,970
Speaker 0: You're supposed to play it with one character then play it with the other character.

289
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:34,590
Speaker 0: No, no, I play it with one character and then I watch the other characters differences on YouTube, right?

290
00:22:34,911 --> 00:22:36,565
Speaker 0: It's like I'm not playing the game twice.

291
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:45,570
Speaker 1: Yeah These games of the ones I've played they're not like a quest for glory where like the three different characters are radically different experiences.

292
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:53,348
Speaker 0: Some of them they are kind of different but they're not worth at least for me to play an entire game again, right?

293
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,950
Speaker 0: Largely solving, you know the same puzzles fighting the same zombies, right?

294
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,251
Speaker 0: They have.

295
00:23:00,271 --> 00:23:03,589
Speaker 0: they think they have different boss fights and different cutscenes and stuff like that.

296
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,443
Speaker 1: But Oh cutscenes and yeah cutscenes is watch on YouTube.

297
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:13,210
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, Resident Evil's a thing I'll probably talk about more after I play.

298
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,543
Speaker 0: You know I'm gonna beat three and then I'll see if I go and play.

299
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:21,650
Speaker 0: I haven't played for since the GameCube So maybe I'll keep going for I got to catch up to you.

300
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,730
Speaker 1: I gotta start playing these two if I ever have some free time.

301
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:25,353
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean You know the.

302
00:23:25,493 --> 00:23:28,525
Speaker 0: the summary really about Resident Evil is what is Resident Evil?

303
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:40,929
Speaker 0: at least one two and three Four is suddenly like a different kind of game slightly But one two and three is just a combination of the point-and-click adventure game with the puzzling Puzzles in quotes like LucasArts.

304
00:23:41,752 --> 00:23:46,585
Speaker 1: Right find the rooster by to put it into the rooster shaped keyhole that kind of thing exactly.

305
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:55,679
Speaker 0: It's that game combined with third person shooting Combined with your inventory is really scarce.

306
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,083
Speaker 0: You have hardly any bullets.

307
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,650
Speaker 0: Don't use them all don't use all your health because you'll run out.

308
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,352
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

309
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,516
Speaker 0: You barely have anything.

310
00:24:01,576 --> 00:24:05,670
Speaker 1: That's the survival horror like disempowerment fantasy, right?

311
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,639
Speaker 0: It's like you have like 20 bullets, right?

312
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:11,230
Speaker 0: So it's like you can't just go mow down all the zombies They're just gonna get back up anyway.

313
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:18,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, so use use your stuff sparingly and carefully and on the harder modes We're gonna give you even less shit to use.

314
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:18,299
Speaker 0: right.

315
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,370
Speaker 0: and it's those things combined, right?

316
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:24,170
Speaker 0: And so that comp that exact combination.

317
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:30,070
Speaker 0: I don't think all those elements existed well before Resident Evil 1 but that exact combination did not exist.

318
00:24:30,933 --> 00:24:35,770
Speaker 0: So and it still there's not a lot of other games still today that use that exact combination.

319
00:24:41,007 --> 00:24:44,145
Speaker 1: but anyway things of the day.

320
00:24:44,406 --> 00:24:48,819
Speaker 1: so check this out, this is a soccer game or football depending on where you're from.

321
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,449
Speaker 1: and Basically, they've got an AI Camera person.

322
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:54,720
Speaker 1: like they didn't hire a camera person.

323
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:01,300
Speaker 1: The camera has some machine learning algorithm and identifies where the ball is and it like follows the ball.

324
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:05,820
Speaker 1: Kind of like if you had a thing that just automatically followed the puck or followed like whatever the action was in a sport.

325
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:09,053
Speaker 1: Alright get rid of a person you have to pay.

326
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:23,400
Speaker 1: the AI might do a better job except one of the linesmen is bald and That linesman head is very shiny and the camera keeps thinking his head is the ball.

327
00:25:23,884 --> 00:25:25,518
Speaker 0: So you let soccer balls have black.

328
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:32,660
Speaker 1: You know hexagon but from this distance from as far away as it is and also it's a gets a good camera system.

329
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,162
Speaker 1: but like.

330
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:42,639
Speaker 1: it's the difference between like the NHL versus like the KHL in terms of like how well they Like actually have like what level of camera and fidelity and lighting and everything.

331
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:44,947
Speaker 0: KHL is legit pro league it is.

332
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:48,718
Speaker 1: but what camera are they using compared to what the NHL is using in their arena?

333
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,437
Speaker 1: like the actual camera lens sensor that kind of kit.

334
00:25:52,523 --> 00:26:05,640
Speaker 1: So to the camera the the ball is a whitish shiny Circular thing moving around and this guy's head It's also a whitish shiny circular thing because the reflection on his head is so strong.

335
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:11,113
Speaker 1: The Sun is like coming right down at him in this perfect You know some block on his head.

336
00:26:11,313 --> 00:26:11,874
Speaker 1: I hope he does.

337
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:15,233
Speaker 1: I guess eventually we're turned red and the camera would realize it wasn't a ball.

338
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,625
Speaker 1: but it's so funny because if you don't know it's an AI.

339
00:26:19,905 --> 00:26:34,049
Speaker 1: you're watching this game and the camera just will like Turn away and start zooming in on this guy for no reason and then suddenly go Oh shit and go back to the game and then it'll keep drifting back over to this guy Like the cameraman is obsessed with this guy for some reason.

340
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,420
Speaker 1: So if you don't know it's an AI it's actually funnier to watch.

341
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:47,217
Speaker 1: But If you haven't listen to a geek nights Monday, this is exactly the kind of danger We were talking about with facial recognition machine learning.

342
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:59,332
Speaker 0: So we got So on this website XO das dot the - I Ey e dot us the ultimate XO das, right?

343
00:26:59,372 --> 00:27:00,475

Speaker 0: It says everything that's going on here, right?

345
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:15,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, XO das is an attempt to catalog obtain and make playable every game developed for the DOS and PC booter platform Striving to find original media rather than scene rips, right?

346
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:17,742
Speaker 0: This collection?

347
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,749

352
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:42,480

353
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,070
Speaker 0: There are thousands of freeware homebrew and share.

354
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:47,840
Speaker 0: where our games that will continue to be added in future packs.

355

356
00:27:50,167 --> 00:27:50,749
Speaker 0: XO das.

357
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:51,974
Speaker 0: Let's see fan a game.

358
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,023
Speaker 1: There are a lot of gay I start naming.

359
00:27:54,043 --> 00:27:55,287
Speaker 0: start naming some games room.

360
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,735
Speaker 1: I mean fantasy empires is the one.

361
00:27:58,036 --> 00:27:59,140
Speaker 0: All right, I'm waiting for it to load.

362
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,456
Speaker 1: It's yeah, I'm literally looking at the same thing.

363
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:02,000
Speaker 1: It's loading slowly.

364
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:09,877
Speaker 1: But yeah You can get these games to work with DOS box and fuckery.

365
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:15,414
Speaker 1: but Making it easy and accessible like this like putting it in the Empire is 1993 dot zip.

366
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:19,910
Speaker 1: Oh my god I'm gonna stream some fucking fantasy empires.

367
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,656

Speaker 1: I found it.

376
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:29,849
Speaker 0: What else he got?

377
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,051
Speaker 0: 20 odd?

378
00:28:34,611 --> 00:28:36,160
Speaker 1: Kind of think of DOS games that I liked.

379
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,910
Speaker 1: other that I don't already have like tie fighter.

380
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:39,996
Speaker 1: I'm just oh my god.

381
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:40,539
Speaker 1: There are some.

382
00:28:41,363 --> 00:28:45,578
Speaker 1: I haven't heard a half of these The seven thousand DOS games.

383
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,068
Speaker 0: You've definitely not heard of the vast majority of them.

384
00:28:48,128 --> 00:28:52,148
Speaker 0: Yep the point is We back.

385
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,539
Speaker 1: This is our jam, you know, it's not there.

386
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,390
Speaker 1: it is one most all 20 97, you know, I never owned that game.

387
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,336
Speaker 0: There's 1991 does it whoo.

388
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:06,750
Speaker 1: Well, we'll have to see if it comes with the triple tank if anyone paid.

389
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:13,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if this can if these are just the share wares and freewares or if they're the full games.

390
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,063
Speaker 1: But this is kind of a big deal for the same reason that nesticle.

391
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:19,050
Speaker 0: download this while you still can.

392
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:19,753
Speaker 0: They're like.

393
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:21,158
Speaker 1: nesticle was one of the first.

394
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:21,921
Speaker 1: yeah get this torrent.

395
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:36,310
Speaker 1: like stat nesticle was one of the first NES emulators that for a layperson kind of just worked and that really like opened up People being able to explore the NES library in an era when it wasn't super accessible.

396
00:29:36,794 --> 00:29:49,829
Speaker 1: so this is actually a huge victory for game preservation and just for like the experience like how many young people might like the young nerd can just Take this hit a button and play some ancient DOS game.

397
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:54,008
Speaker 1: None of those people are gonna fuck around with DOS box to make that shit work Like I did.

398
00:29:54,911 --> 00:29:58,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, and this torrent is five hundred and twenty seven gigabytes.

399
00:29:58,604 --> 00:29:59,166
Speaker 1: That ain't bad.

400
00:29:59,567 --> 00:30:00,270
Speaker 1: That's not that big.

401
00:30:02,311 --> 00:30:02,993
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited.

402
00:30:03,154 --> 00:30:03,816
Speaker 0: It's not that big.

403
00:30:03,896 --> 00:30:07,689
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's big but I've downloaded bigger torrents in recent memory.

404
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,118
Speaker 1: The store is gonna get downloading ASAP.

405
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:14,003
Speaker 0: for me, okay good.

406
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:16,250
Speaker 1: Well you download it then you download it too and I'll seed you.

407
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:26,490
Speaker 1: Okay In the moment, there's only one meta if you're watching the live stream Are you haven't voted yet and you live in America and you're an adult running out of time?

408
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,075
Speaker 1: Yeah, like go fuck like.

409
00:30:28,095 --> 00:30:31,245
Speaker 1: turn this off right now and go vote like this is it.

410
00:30:31,366 --> 00:30:32,630
Speaker 1: There's no second chances.

411
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:36,206
Speaker 0: I highly doubt there's anyone listening or watching this live.

412
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:36,287
Speaker 0: who?

413
00:30:37,631 --> 00:30:42,350
Speaker 0: Has the illegal ability to vote in the United States of America and has not done so yet?

414
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:48,755
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll say if you are that person if you chose not to vote if you if you didn't vote if you could vote in America stop listening.

415
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:49,256
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:49,718
Speaker 0: Yeah.

417
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:50,120
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

418
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,585
Speaker 1: Like don't be a fan of geek nights.

419
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,367
Speaker 1: Just just delay.

420
00:30:52,408 --> 00:30:56,819
Speaker 0: not only Not only you know, do you need to have voted?

421
00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:00,129
Speaker 0: you need to have voted for Democrats only?

422
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:08,930
Speaker 1: Yep If you're in New York Democrats on the line of a different party like the working families party, that's a weird New York specific thing.

423
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:13,505
Speaker 1: But Joe Biden's name has to be on the thing you did whatever mark you need to do.

424
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:16,660
Speaker 1: if you didn't do that and you Could have get the fuck out of our stream.

425
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,746
Speaker 1: Like I'm not kidding.

426
00:31:17,806 --> 00:31:18,409
Speaker 1: It's not a joke.

427
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,052
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

428
00:31:20,674 --> 00:31:25,830
Speaker 1: But otherwise if you did vote or you're like, oh, you're maybe you're in line to vote on the West Coast or something.

429
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:38,650
Speaker 1: Don't obsess over the results tonight on Tuesday because unless Biden wins, Florida tonight We're not gonna know the answer for real for a few days.

430
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:43,650
Speaker 1: Like if you're just holding f5 on some website, all you're doing is adding stress to yourself.

431
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:50,090
Speaker 1: But you are not actually learning any new information nor are you going to do anything differently with that information?

432
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:57,370
Speaker 1: So my advice to you is if you can just don't worry about the answer to what happened until tomorrow.

433
00:31:57,731 --> 00:31:58,937
Speaker 1: Then you can start stressing about it.

434
00:31:58,997 --> 00:31:59,740
Speaker 1: Like take a night off.

435
00:32:00,584 --> 00:32:05,725
Speaker 1: if you really can't do that Just wait for Florida and if Florida gets called for by you can go to bed.

436
00:32:05,865 --> 00:32:11,449
Speaker 1: if it doesn't get called for Biden You're gonna be stressed and just force yourself to go to sleep because no new information will come out tonight.

437
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all I got.

438
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:16,437
Speaker 1: I hope you vote that.

439
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:17,741
Speaker 1: that's literally all that matters.

440
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:20,869
Speaker 1: So let's get into another game that involves voting.

441
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:23,152
Speaker 1: Among us.

442
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:27,730
Speaker 1: this was a game that came out a while ago didn't get a huge amount of traction.

443
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:37,741
Speaker 1: then coven happened everyone stuck at home and Among us it turns out is like The perfect game to stream with a bunch of friends.

444
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:40,770
Speaker 1: when you're missing your friends and want to hang out online and play a game.

445
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't need to talk about how the game was like it came out.

446
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:49,009
Speaker 0: It was a tiny little unknown game that no one cared about and then became a big deal.

447
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:52,860
Speaker 0: Right because various streamers and other people brought attention to it.

448
00:32:53,261 --> 00:32:54,164
Speaker 0: and such right.

449
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:54,425
Speaker 0: you.

450
00:32:54,525 --> 00:32:58,599
Speaker 0: you already know that story and you can read about That story on the internet somewhere.

451
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:00,185
Speaker 0: Yeah, we got it.

452
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:04,835
Speaker 0: We got to break this game right because Inherently this game is a game.

453
00:33:04,855 --> 00:33:05,699
Speaker 0: We've all played before.

454
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,968
Speaker 0: it's just mafia slash werewolf, right?

455
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,259
Speaker 1: Yep So I think we have.

456
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,975
Speaker 1: we had to have done a show on mafia at some point But basically I'm sure we have.

457
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:16,464
Speaker 1: these are all this the class of game.

458
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:18,450
Speaker 1: We're talking about here our social deduction games.

459
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:24,490
Speaker 1: They usually are along the lines of there's some number of good people and some number of bad people.

460
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:25,677
Speaker 0: The bad no one.

461
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:27,830
Speaker 0: and yeah, the information is hidden.

462
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:39,208
Speaker 0: So good people definitely don't know who the bad people are And bad people may or may not know who the other bad people yep, and generally the good people are trying to figure out who the bad people are and effectively vote them off the island.

463
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,551
Speaker 1: and Meanwhile, the bad people are trying to eliminate all of the good people until they are the majority and then they win Right.

464
00:33:45,592 --> 00:33:51,450
Speaker 0: So the key to winning the game the games all of these games in this category have all sorts of other mechanics going around.

465
00:33:51,814 --> 00:34:02,149
Speaker 0: But the inherent, you know The core is if you can figure out who is who if you discover the secret identities of the other players Then you're going to be able to win, right?

466
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:07,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you cannot successfully discover the secret identities of the other players You are going to lose.

467
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:14,768
Speaker 0: now as the bad guys know who everyone is or at least they usually Know who everyone is and they will they automatically win this.

468
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:18,148
Speaker 0: there They're acting basically as a timer and not so much as a player.

469
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:23,389
Speaker 0: Other than that, they're trying to avoid detection to keep the timer ticking.

470
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:39,942
Speaker 1: now There are two broad categories of these games in terms of if there is an intrinsic to the game Means to discover who the imposters are or the traders are or if the game is purely social deduction Right.

471
00:34:40,603 --> 00:34:43,050
Speaker 0: This has been our gripe with these games for so long.

472
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,695
Speaker 0: Is that you know the default way?

473
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:51,072
Speaker 0: at least most people in our area or at least I think the United States learn to play Mafia slash.

474
00:34:51,112 --> 00:35:04,270
Speaker 0: werewolf is a game where you know you go to sleep you wake up whatever but you have no Actual evidence to base as as a as a sit as in a good person in the game, right?

475
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 0: There is no literal evidence you have on which to base your decisions of who to kill or not kill.

476
00:35:11,311 --> 00:35:16,357
Speaker 0: Right, you're going based on your gut instinct You're going based on what people are saying.

477
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:24,106
Speaker 0: it ends up being a game of charisma of coercion of you know You know, yeah oration, right?

478
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:29,083
Speaker 0: those are the skills that end up mattering and you know other skill really means anything.

479
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:43,079
Speaker 1: and then all groups will end up into a meta where eventually some people in our group, it's myself Scott and our other friend Scott are identified as too dangerous at the game and Tend to just be murdered by everyone early.

480
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:54,430
Speaker 1: So there's some quiet and then everyone can play the game like normal Like the game ends up being a purely social experience now the way we always want to play Mafia is more like the original rules.

481
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:58,222
Speaker 1: There's a few ways that can be handled but one way is yeah.

482
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, the key is a killer key rule.

483
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,377
Speaker 1: Yes The key rule is the different rule.

484
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:06,516
Speaker 1: that makes it more like among us and this is why I'm we're talking about among us among Did.

485
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:09,334
Speaker 1: the thing we've always wanted is The Mafia.

486
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:12,788
Speaker 1: all wake up one by one and they each point at who they want to kill.

487
00:36:12,828 --> 00:36:13,210
Speaker 1: in the night.

488
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:17,670
Speaker 1: They all have to agree on the same person unanimously or no one dies.

489
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:30,390
Speaker 1: Therefore during the daylight when the social deduction is happening the Mafia people have to somehow communicate with each other Without revealing that they are all the Mafia who they're going to kill that next night.

490
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,977
Speaker 1: That's giving you something to latch on to.

491
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,989
Speaker 1: Scott and Scott keep trying to go after me.

492
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:38,030
Speaker 1: They are clearly trying to set up the murder of me tonight.

493
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,267
Speaker 1: if I get murdered tonight Scott's Mafia that kind of shit can work.

494
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:51,990
Speaker 0: or Regardless of what other people are saying you can see with your own eyes that rim keeps winking Right at Sally over there and it's like why does rim keep winking at Sally?

495
00:36:52,070 --> 00:37:12,470
Speaker 0: He's probably Mafia trying to send her secret messages because they can only communicate during the day Provides you with real evidence to grab on to right to make up your own mind without anyone coercing you right or you know seducing you or Influencing you and you can see with your own eyes and smell with your own nose, right?

496
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,256
Speaker 0: Who's good and who's not good?

497
00:37:14,336 --> 00:37:15,883
Speaker 0: and solve the puzzle.

498
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,510
Speaker 0: this real evidence now, right?

499
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:27,972
Speaker 0: So among us is basically proof that the thing that we've been saying all along which is yeah The older way to play is better where you have real evidence Is true.

500
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:31,284
Speaker 0: people are love among us way more than they love regular old mafia.

501
00:37:31,324 --> 00:37:33,130
Speaker 0: Yep, so it's super popular.

502
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:36,001
Speaker 1: So the way among us works mechanically is very simple.

503
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,330
Speaker 1: And this is this is where the magic is in this game.

504
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,153
Speaker 0: It's so simple.

505
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:43,350
Speaker 0: It's basically they made this tiny little crappy phone game with the crappiest UI.

506
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:44,715
Speaker 0: Right that bear.

507
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:49,753
Speaker 0: you basically use one finger to like move around and there's giant buttons for the few actions You can take right.

508
00:37:49,973 --> 00:37:57,256
Speaker 0: and then they've just ported that exact experience with almost no modifications and to the switch to the PC Everything.

509
00:37:57,276 --> 00:37:58,120
Speaker 1: just play it on your phone.

510
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,566
Speaker 1: It's free ons on everything.

511
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:04,084
Speaker 0: It's like I Suggest paying the five dollars to not have any ads.

512
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:04,525
Speaker 0: Yep.

513
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:09,322
Speaker 1: So basically You're these little like bean looking spacemen really straightforward.

514
00:38:09,623 --> 00:38:18,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, the aesthetic is really cute - yep You start on a spaceship or says other maps But you start in the place and there's a bunch of tasks that the crew has to do.

515
00:38:19,365 --> 00:38:25,590
Speaker 1: the crew wins if they complete all the tasks Meanwhile the imposters they don't have to do any tasks.

516
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:34,197
Speaker 1: They win if they outnumber the regular people or they cause sabotage such that the ship explodes Mm-hmm.

517
00:38:34,237 --> 00:38:37,250
Speaker 0: So what this does is in the original mafia, right?

518
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:41,670
Speaker 0: The mafia or werewolves are the timer on the good characters, right?

519
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,670
Speaker 0: All the good characters.

520
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:46,405
Speaker 0: The only thing they have to do is figure out who the bad guys are and get rid of them.

521
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:48,873
Speaker 0: and there's a timer ticking Down until they lose.

522
00:38:49,415 --> 00:38:50,619
Speaker 0: here, right?

523
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:58,183
Speaker 0: You have two independent timers that are competing with each other right the bad guys timer the imposters.

524
00:38:58,243 --> 00:39:06,721
Speaker 0: their timer is we can oh I can only murder someone every 35 seconds 40 seconds Whatever it's set at and there's only one of me or two of us.

525
00:39:07,182 --> 00:39:09,470
Speaker 0: so it will take us this long to kill everybody.

526
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:16,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then if they if they accidentally kill good people during a voting session Well, our timer just goes down even more.

527
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:26,936
Speaker 0: yeah, right and meanwhile the good players now have a timer of their own even if they fail at You know beating the bad guys.

528
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:41,090
Speaker 0: as long as they can keep their timer ahead if they can go around and complete all the tasks Without dying then they can pressure The bad guys the imposters into perhaps doing some messy murders and revealing themselves.

529
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,105
Speaker 0: They're now pressured right.

530
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:46,357
Speaker 0: so Investigation right.

531
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,464
Speaker 0: there are two clocks ticking down.

532
00:39:49,545 --> 00:40:01,230
Speaker 0: whichever one hits zero first wins and You want to make yours faster and the social deduction basically makes huge adjustments to the clocks, right?

533
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,004
Speaker 0: So the clocks are kind of even right but the they're hugely adjusted.

534
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:10,102
Speaker 0: the social deduction still matters the most Because it adjusts the clocks so much.

535
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:16,010
Speaker 0: that like if you're good at tasks Yeah, that won't make up for the fact that you know, you got caught or whatever.

536
00:40:16,251 --> 00:40:17,915
Speaker 1: So here's the real magic.

537
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,870
Speaker 1: the mechanics of this are so simple in terms of the the imposter people they can sabotage.

538
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:23,830
Speaker 1: We'll get to that in a minute.

539
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,687
Speaker 1: But basically when they murder someone there's that cooldown like 30 seconds 40 seconds.

540
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:29,530
Speaker 1: They can't kill anyone else.

541
00:40:29,774 --> 00:40:30,689
Speaker 1: They leave a body behind.

542
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:45,589
Speaker 1: the only way to call the meeting where you decide whether or not to execute someone as Suspected of being an imposter is either to find a body in which case you can immediately report it or Run back to where everyone started and hit an emergency meeting button.

543
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:57,063
Speaker 1: So if Scott murders someone in like electrical and I happen to bumble into electrical and Scott's coming out And there's a body behind him pretty sure Scott's the imposter.

544
00:40:57,083 --> 00:41:02,484
Speaker 1: I Can report that body and get him but then it can get tricky.

545
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,050
Speaker 1: Scott might have been playing something clever.

546
00:41:04,311 --> 00:41:10,009
Speaker 1: Scott might have been set up the imposter might have been in the room had already murdered the person and jumped into the vent.

547
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:13,309
Speaker 1: only Impostors can move through the vents and left Scott to get framed.

548
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:15,233
Speaker 0: It's possible.

549
00:41:15,253 --> 00:41:15,433
Speaker 0: Yeah,

550
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:37,401
Speaker 1: and that these mechanics cause all these avenues of social deduction All these avenues of discovery of the imposters avenues of trickery by the imposters to set someone else up it makes such a broad playing space that I Plays the game a ton of times with our friends and with a bunch of people like I believe played with randos to see how It went down.

551
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:49,090
Speaker 0: At least one interesting thing happens in every game, which is not something you can say about a game like mafia Yeah, and the other thing is that you could be playing, you know, regular old mafia where there's no evidence, right?

552
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,250
Speaker 0: You just might really believe that rim is the bad guy or you want to kill rim, right?

553
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,070
Speaker 0: You see you convince other people to do it and you don't know if you're right or wrong, right?

554
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,470
Speaker 0: You know you you may have a good strong hunch or you may know rim really well or something.

555
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,858
Speaker 0: But here you can witness a murder.

556
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,624
Speaker 0: you saw it, right?

557
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:08,670
Speaker 0: You know who done it a hundred percent There is no doubt whatsoever.

558
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:16,284
Speaker 0: You literally saw it happen and then but you're the only one who saw it happen And now you have to convince the other people of what you saw.

559
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:24,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then The other person who did the murder is probably gonna come up with some other lie saying you did it Right and now you've got it, right?

560
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:31,634
Speaker 0: But you know and that that fact that you really know the truth Makes all the difference in the world.

561
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:42,183
Speaker 1: The game is completely on its head and on top of that the tasks themselves are all Basically WarioWare games of varying difficulty and annoyance.

562
00:42:42,484 --> 00:42:44,650
Speaker 0: They're way simpler than WarioWare games.

563
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:52,159
Speaker 0: They're a little slower than WarioWare games Which is on purpose because basically to do it some of them are just like click a button Literally and some of them actually do a thing.

564
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:57,898
Speaker 1: you'll get a task list and some of the tasks are really short and some of them But here's the key you gotta do them.

565
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:01,890
Speaker 1: you got a standard little bean guy there and do the task.

566
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:08,363
Speaker 1: So like I'll be doing a test that takes a while like the reactor and then it's like space team Yep, and then Scott say walks into the room behind me.

567
00:43:08,785 --> 00:43:09,750
Speaker 1: Do I keep doing the task?

568
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:10,794
Speaker 1: Do I trust Scott?

569
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:12,543
Speaker 1: do I stop doing it and get away from him?

570
00:43:12,845 --> 00:43:13,850
Speaker 1: Like am I worried about this?

571
00:43:14,111 --> 00:43:15,215
Speaker 1: How do I proceed with that?

572
00:43:15,236 --> 00:43:16,762
Speaker 1: It's got just gonna murder me.

573
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,510
Speaker 1: Maybe he's watching me to protect me.

574
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:33,716
Speaker 1: We're like, there's a lot of interaction that happens and because you can't talk during the game except during meeting You have to communicate non-verbally and the only tools you have are moving your little guy around Or stay much.

575
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,445
Speaker 1: Yeah or standing next to something.

576
00:43:35,465 --> 00:43:45,318
Speaker 1: that could be a task But with the exception of a handful of tasks that have an animation where if you see someone do that task You know 100% they're not an imposter.

577
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,090
Speaker 1: some tasks don't have any such thing.

578
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,523
Speaker 1: So I stand next to admin to do the card swiping and so does Scott.

579
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,230
Speaker 1: Scott might just be fucking faking it.

580
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:54,735
Speaker 1: Just stand in there for 10 seconds.

581
00:43:54,795 --> 00:43:56,019
Speaker 0: There is one way to.

582
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,956
Speaker 0: there is one way to tell that is very difficult to do is Alright, we both go stand.

583
00:44:01,996 --> 00:44:03,240
Speaker 0: We both stand near a thing.

584
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,970
Speaker 0: Yep, right you finish the task, right?

585
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,499
Speaker 0: You were standing near the same thing.

586
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,291
Speaker 0: the task should take about the same time Mm-hmm.

587
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:24,845
Speaker 0: There's a green bar at the top of the screen that shows how close all the tasks are to being completed And the good guys will win when it's completely full if someone stands near a task and walks away from it as it as if they Did it and the green bar doesn't move.

588
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:30,550
Speaker 1: Yep But and caveat some tasks are single tasks were like I do the swipe the bar moves.

589
00:44:30,911 --> 00:44:36,169
Speaker 1: Some tasks have multiple steps where if you did the bar won't move until you do the all the steps.

590
00:44:36,892 --> 00:44:37,857
Speaker 0: That's correct.

591
00:44:37,877 --> 00:44:40,970
Speaker 1: So this is where the game isn't just deduction.

592
00:44:41,511 --> 00:44:43,718
Speaker 1: There is a knowledge and skill component of.

593
00:44:43,798 --> 00:44:54,647
Speaker 1: you can actually get better at the game by having better memory by Looking for patterns by noticing things like that by paying attention and by being able to string together a very coherent case.

594
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:59,310
Speaker 1: a lot of Impostors go down by being asked what are the last two tasks you did?

595
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,144
Speaker 1: And if the imposter wasn't doing tasks that won't be front of mind.

596
00:45:03,465 --> 00:45:06,195
Speaker 1: if they try to make something up They might get caught in their lie.

597
00:45:06,476 --> 00:45:09,726
Speaker 1: Like Joey Jojo might be like I was in navigation.

598
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:10,969
Speaker 1: I didn't see you do shit.

599
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:21,389
Speaker 1: And as a result, like you can see like you watch some streamers There are people who are good at this game in the same way that people are good at FPS is.

600
00:45:24,831 --> 00:45:29,385
Speaker 1: So the final big mechanic the sabotage is really fun and clever.

601
00:45:29,806 --> 00:45:31,110
Speaker 1: the imposter can like lock doors.

602
00:45:31,571 --> 00:45:36,650
Speaker 1: So you can like lock someone in a room and then murder them or murder someone and then lock the room.

603
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:42,894
Speaker 1: so it takes a while for anyone to find the body and report it to give you more time to construct an alibi be seen by someone somewhere else.

604
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:48,537
Speaker 1: that kind of thing, but some of the sabotages have game effect like turn down the lights.

605
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,141
Speaker 1: now people can't see.

606
00:45:50,221 --> 00:45:51,505
Speaker 1: it's easier to get away with murders.

607
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:52,608
Speaker 1: turn down comms.

608
00:45:52,848 --> 00:45:54,587
Speaker 1: people can't See their own task list.

609
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,497
Speaker 1: Hit the reactor or oxygen.

610
00:45:57,517 --> 00:46:00,629
Speaker 1: the the crew mates have 30 seconds to fix that or they just lose.

611
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:03,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've sort of there are ways to cheat.

612
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,770
Speaker 0: So if you the task list comms you can screenshot your game when it starts to get to save your task list.

613
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,357
Speaker 0: That's a good move or write it down.

614
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:12,040
Speaker 1: Yep.

615
00:46:12,361 --> 00:46:14,469
Speaker 1: I just remember at this point because I play the game so much.

616
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:17,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean at least at least the main map.

617
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:18,907
Speaker 0: I know the tasks and where they are.

618
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:24,050
Speaker 0: But the you know, you play different maps now, you gotta learn new tasks and they're coming out with a new map soon.

619
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,355
Speaker 0: That's apparently huge.

620
00:46:25,476 --> 00:46:27,604
Speaker 0: I'm excited about that big a big math.

621
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:28,970
Speaker 1: now even better goes.

622
00:46:29,211 --> 00:46:35,144
Speaker 1: There are things you can interact with that aren't tasks But can help you try to find the imposter or help you be the imposter.

623
00:46:35,185 --> 00:46:36,310
Speaker 1: like in the main map.

624
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,196
Speaker 1: Everyone starts with.

625
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,370
Speaker 1: there's admin like in that room.

626
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:44,150
Speaker 1: There's a thing you can do where it'll show you how many of your friends are in each room everywhere.

627
00:46:44,632 --> 00:46:48,750
Speaker 1: So if you're the imposter, you could look and be like, oh, I see that someone's alone and electrical.

628
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:55,779
Speaker 1: Let me just go help myself to them little murderer out of the way or You might be watching that to see.

629
00:46:55,799 --> 00:46:57,727
Speaker 1: Oh, hey, there was someone in electrical.

630
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,558
Speaker 1: Let me go check They're by themselves and try to protect them.

631
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,650
Speaker 1: There's a camera you can go look at like security cameras.

632
00:47:03,851 --> 00:47:06,970
Speaker 1: You might just witness a murder but the security cameras blink red.

633
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:10,150
Speaker 1: So the imposter and the players can see if someone's looking at the cameras.

634
00:47:12,512 --> 00:47:19,488
Speaker 1: But I guess the moral of all that because I'm not gonna explain every one of these special things That you've explained almost every special thing so far.

635
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:37,669
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I haven't gotten into the other maps and like there's a lot more nonsense than the other maps but basically the game adds like four core mechanics on top of mafia all of which are intrinsic and All of those together make this game surprisingly complex and nuanced and fun.

636
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:43,992
Speaker 1: Like this game is way more fun than you might expect for how simple it looks Mmm.

637
00:47:44,132 --> 00:47:46,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's it's you know, that's the thing for it.

638
00:47:46,338 --> 00:47:50,610
Speaker 0: Just a throwaway game right by getting the rules, right?

639
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:57,350
Speaker 0: You know just making that small change You know something it's like oh you got the rules, right?

640
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:59,637
Speaker 0: Suddenly you have an amazing play experience.

641
00:47:59,758 --> 00:48:04,649
Speaker 0: regardless of these all these other problems you've got and especially in coded times The game is social.

642
00:48:04,891 --> 00:48:10,487
Speaker 1: So it's a very good game to just hang out with your friends in a discord while you play right.

643
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:15,690
Speaker 0: low Development cost right just slap together a tiny little thing.

644
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:28,054
Speaker 0: There's other people who are like, you know working on these huge games You know like big 3d stuff and you know all kinds of fanciness and like a million levels and like a million Cosmetic things.

645
00:48:28,094 --> 00:48:31,785
Speaker 0: and who knows right all these people out there like you got MMOs.

646
00:48:31,805 --> 00:48:35,837
Speaker 0: people are making out there Right things cost zillions of dollars.

647
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:39,929
Speaker 1: solid game and with solid mechanics could be the a-plus game of the year.

648
00:48:40,912 --> 00:48:41,274
Speaker 0: That's right.

649
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:44,010
Speaker 0: You know Candy Crush made more money than all of them, right?

650
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:53,250
Speaker 0: so all you got it and it doesn't have to be a Micro transaction kind of thing either right like Candy Crush was right you can make the money and make the sales.

651
00:48:53,872 --> 00:48:56,220
Speaker 0: You just need the good rules right.

652
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,969
Speaker 0: the rules of the game is what's all about.

653
00:48:59,109 --> 00:49:02,199
Speaker 1: Yep so The last little bit.

654
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:11,096
Speaker 1: normally in a game any game One thing that Scott and I are often annoyed by is if someone falls back on the Atari method of there's a million modes Figure out which one is fun.

655
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:13,650
Speaker 1: Like if the game is too customizable in that regard.

656
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:16,729
Speaker 1: Usually that's a sign of they didn't figure out which mode was fun.

657
00:49:17,751 --> 00:49:23,890
Speaker 1: Something Among Us does that is actually very strong in my opinion is it starts the game at a good default.

658
00:49:24,351 --> 00:49:35,041
Speaker 1: But you can tweak a lot of little details like slightly tweak the cooldown time of the kills or the view Distance of the imposter versus the players or how many tasks people have.

659
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:39,284
Speaker 1: so it basically lets you do the thing that Mafia and werewolf do.

660
00:49:39,324 --> 00:49:39,809
Speaker 1: very well.

661
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:45,510
Speaker 1: We're like if the Mafia win every game then you add the Archangel.

662
00:49:45,631 --> 00:49:49,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, add other roles to give the human the non mafia people a better chance.

663
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:55,690
Speaker 0: If the on the one hand right is like when a game gives you all so many options, right?

664
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,509
Speaker 0: There's a lot of games out there that don't give enough options, especially with controls for accessibility and that's a problem.

665
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:02,131
Speaker 1: But

666
00:50:02,673 --> 00:50:18,109
Speaker 0: I think it's also when I see with these many options, especially for the gameplay specifically I often see that as like a designer crutch where it's like Oh, you didn't want to go through the game design play testing effort to figure out what the perfect settings should be.

667
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:21,050
Speaker 0: So you're just saying player do my work for me, right?

668
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:26,417
Speaker 0: Imagine if you got a board game and there's a bunch of pieces and the rule book was like Yeah, start with X dollars.

669
00:50:26,497 --> 00:50:31,968
Speaker 0: figure it out yourself with the best number of dollars to start with and then you know How much does a settlement cost?

670
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:34,530
Speaker 0: Figure out how many resources it should cost.

671
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,594
Speaker 0: We're not quite sure.

672
00:50:35,674 --> 00:50:37,581
Speaker 0: I didn't figure it out that it should be.

673
00:50:37,883 --> 00:50:42,312
Speaker 0: you know, a sheep a grain or whatever, you know Yeah, it's like That's.

674
00:50:42,574 --> 00:50:43,721
Speaker 0: you don't do that right?

675
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:44,143
Speaker 0: You need to.

676
00:50:44,324 --> 00:50:45,310
Speaker 0: you're the game designer.

677
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:52,750
Speaker 0: It's your job to figure out the right answers for what the values should be for the best possible game experience.

678
00:50:54,331 --> 00:51:03,210
Speaker 0: but you know in this case there does need to be some variability because as Players skills change you have different sets of players different number.

679
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,189
Speaker 0: There's so many variables that go in and affect what those best settings should be.

680
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:17,530
Speaker 0: So I think that yeah those You definitely need some sort of user control over the settings because it would basically be impossible to have an automatic thing.

681
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:22,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, right for any any conceivable game, but I do think they went a little bit too far.

682
00:51:23,006 --> 00:51:24,150
Speaker 0: It's like it's too flexible.

683
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:24,291
Speaker 0: I

684
00:51:24,371 --> 00:51:24,894
Speaker 1: know

685
00:51:24,995 --> 00:51:25,075
Speaker 0: I

686
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:38,929
Speaker 1: need that because when we were playing with our group you'll find that your group's meta will evolve semi independently of other groups and You sort of like I could figure out like okay the imposters are winning a bunch of times in the in a

687
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:39,310
Speaker 0: row

688
00:51:39,751 --> 00:51:41,297
Speaker 1: But they're winning mostly by murdering.

689
00:51:41,578 --> 00:51:44,970
Speaker 1: if I increase the cooldown slightly that'll restore balance.

690
00:51:46,154 --> 00:51:54,210
Speaker 0: See, I think that on the one hand Right that sort of reactive method is how I see a lot of game designers with like living games.

691
00:51:54,472 --> 00:52:02,054
Speaker 0: You know games like, you know Multiplayer games go wrong is that they see their current meta and they're like, okay that everyone's playing with that character Let's nerf them.

692
00:52:02,395 --> 00:52:04,486
Speaker 0: All right, everyone's not playing that character enough.

693
00:52:04,526 --> 00:52:05,390
Speaker 0: Let's buff them, right?

694
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:11,494
Speaker 0: It's sort of this reactive design and I think you need to resist that urge and instead Right.

695
00:52:11,514 --> 00:52:14,130
Speaker 0: what you need to do is say well, how do we want people to play?

696
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:21,189
Speaker 0: We want people to play this way and instead do a proactive say well We want people to you know, do this more and do this less.

697
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:28,489
Speaker 0: Right, you know, it's not not even thinking about how they're playing now All right, just think about how we want them the perfect game to go.

698
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:34,126
Speaker 0: What settings do we put for that fear hypothetical perfect game to encourage those behaviors?

699
00:52:34,647 --> 00:52:38,910
Speaker 0: right and not you know So much stick on carrot on the current behavior.

700
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,885
Speaker 1: Well, I would say the like the big brain version of this would be.

701
00:52:44,046 --> 00:52:59,825
Speaker 1: all those fiddly options are fun But if you could figure out like because basically the the real race is how many players in the game are skilled at the game or not like that determines the meta until everyone gets to this like Moderately high level of skill and then the game sort of stabilizes.

702
00:53:00,347 --> 00:53:02,826
Speaker 1: you could almost abstract it all into a slider of.

703
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:06,090
Speaker 1: Do you think you who run the server?

704
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,428
Speaker 1: Do you think the crew mates or the imposters are winning too often and you can?

705
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,930
Speaker 1: Click a button and it basically makes it slightly harder for whichever faction you're trying to make harder for and that would be it.

706
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:19,259
Speaker 1: And it could just roll all those things together soon.

707
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,665
Speaker 0: All right soon they are.

708
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,550
Speaker 0: They're gonna add player accounts where you can make an account.

709
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:31,170
Speaker 0: If you have that you can track data on each player like how fast is Scott at doing tests, right?

710
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,826
Speaker 1: Which maps to Scott win on the most you can also deal with?

711
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:35,349
Speaker 0: how good is?

712
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:36,412
Speaker 1: Griefing?

713
00:53:36,432 --> 00:53:39,590
Speaker 0: how good is Scott at imposter versus not imposter?

714
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:47,959
Speaker 0: When you know and you could with all that data if they actually bother to collect it and analyze it which is really difficult to Do actually but they have so much day.

715
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:57,194
Speaker 0: They could collect so much with all these players You could probably you know, learn like the best settings to get you know The most you would.

716
00:53:57,314 --> 00:54:13,557
Speaker 0: I think you'd want to optimize for the most exciting games right the ones that you know Go deep right don't end too quickly Where you know you get really close to finishing all the tasks and then it's a close call to whether the tasks get finished Or the final person dies, right?

717
00:54:13,758 --> 00:54:16,326
Speaker 0: That's the game you want to optimize for right?

718
00:54:16,366 --> 00:54:17,570
Speaker 0: How do we reach that game?

719
00:54:18,112 --> 00:54:24,876
Speaker 0: All right, if you just optimize for like, you know 50% win rate imposter versus not.

720
00:54:24,937 --> 00:54:30,694
Speaker 0: you might get a bunch of really sad games where either one team or the other it wins quickly Right.

721
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:35,493
Speaker 0: It's like oh, it's 50% win rate imposters and you know It's like.

722
00:54:35,553 --> 00:54:36,659
Speaker 0: no, it's a really boring game.

723
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:37,443
Speaker 1: now, I guess that's where.

724
00:54:37,463 --> 00:54:44,509
Speaker 1: because the game is so simple I find that this is one of those cases where like I personally do appreciate the fiddly level of control.

725
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:47,750
Speaker 1: But part of that is I think I have a very good sense.

726
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:53,888
Speaker 1: I think you do too of like when we play a game of among us what were the deciding factors in that game?

727
00:54:53,908 --> 00:54:59,910
Speaker 1: and We're very good at like figuring out what to tweak to make the game be what we want it to be for our group.

728
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:01,476
Speaker 1: Because the thing is there's two groups.

729
00:55:01,737 --> 00:55:02,941
Speaker 1: There's two types of play in this.

730
00:55:02,981 --> 00:55:06,874
Speaker 1: a lot of people play it with strangers, but We do that.

731
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:11,675
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's popular with strangers, but we play it with like people We are already friends with.

732
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:16,090
Speaker 0: we play it in small groups for a reason would not play with a strange person.

733
00:55:16,151 --> 00:55:16,617
Speaker 0: I do not know.

734
00:55:16,638 --> 00:55:19,217
Speaker 1: so the strange Your games are interesting.

735
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,909
Speaker 1: part of the reason why they're adding on the internet is that?

736
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,376
Speaker 1: There is a common form of griefing.

737
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:33,599
Speaker 1: if you're playing with randos where a lot of people will quit any game where they're not the imposter and just join a different server Mm-hmm that they just really only want to play really just only one.

738
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:36,730
Speaker 1: I mean it is honestly I have more fun being the imposter.

739
00:55:38,876 --> 00:55:43,842
Speaker 0: I don't really care too, but it's like For some reason I'm very good at imposter.

740
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,387
Speaker 0: I win often as imposter.

741
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got it.

742
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:47,074
Speaker 1: I don't Scott's.

743
00:55:47,174 --> 00:55:49,787
Speaker 1: I'm gonna reference this the next time we play a game.

744
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,048
Speaker 1: Scott's good at him But if the imposter seemed like they're doing well, we're just executing Scott.

745
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:55,936
Speaker 0: That's not a bad idea.

746
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, dude.

747
00:55:57,161 --> 00:55:59,108
Speaker 1: It's actually not a bad idea to do that to me either.

748
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,513
Speaker 1: like well I'm like 1%.

749
00:56:00,513 --> 00:56:06,793
Speaker 1: sure it's rim, so let's just kill rim just to get that out of the way and then continue the game Mm-hmm.

750
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:09,115
Speaker 1: So yeah, honestly like so.

751
00:56:09,135 --> 00:56:10,340
Speaker 0: yeah this game looks like.

752
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,002
Speaker 0: you know you might if you're just on the outside looking in and you see Like all these kids are playing this among us and tweeting about it.

753
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:17,710
Speaker 0: You might think you know.

754
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:18,814
Speaker 0: Oh, it's just what you know.

755
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:22,208
Speaker 0: That's just another fortnight or another fall guys, or you know the.

756
00:56:22,248 --> 00:56:22,830
Speaker 0: it's just you know.

757
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:23,534
Speaker 0: It's just some lame.

758
00:56:23,615 --> 00:56:25,546
Speaker 0: Oh current game the kids are playing.

759
00:56:25,627 --> 00:56:29,340
Speaker 0: It's not anything This game is but actually it is.

760
00:56:29,441 --> 00:56:29,541
Speaker 0: it's.

761
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,430
Speaker 0: it's the actual solution.

762
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:36,403
Speaker 0: It's like hey they took the social deduction game And they made they did what we said and they made it not suck.

763
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:39,629
Speaker 0: and it turns out That's really popular you don't say yep.

764
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,558
Speaker 1: and they added right about and then they did it not.

765
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:46,837
Speaker 1: they add enough depth to it to give it a Huge amount of replayability not infinite.

766
00:56:46,878 --> 00:56:47,961
Speaker 1: There is a perfect meta.

767
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:55,909
Speaker 1: eventually like there's a perfect play style, but You'll get a lot for your five bucks before you hit that point with your group of friends.

768
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:59,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I'm sort of getting played out on a little bit right.

769
00:56:59,729 --> 00:57:02,190
Speaker 1: well We haven't done anything like make the game hard yet.

770
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:06,370
Speaker 1: Nor we even played that one map more than a couple times right and they've got new maps.

771
00:57:06,551 --> 00:57:09,970
Speaker 0: They got the new big map coming, so I'll probably go back to it once that big map hits.

772
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:15,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
