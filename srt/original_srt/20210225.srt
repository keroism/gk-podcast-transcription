1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,258
Speaker 0: - It's Thursday, February 25th, 2021, I'm Rem.

2
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,549
Speaker 1: - And I'm Scott.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,170
Speaker 0: - And this is Geek Nights.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,430
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are talking about leftovers.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,028
Speaker 0: If you have any idea for a Thursday show for the love of Satan, tell us.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,827
Speaker 1: - Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:40,780
Speaker 1: - Not only are we low on show ideas for especially Mondays and Thursdays, as usual, we're low on opening bits 'cause we don't go anywhere or do anything.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:50,040
Speaker 0: - Anything that could happen to me is something that primarily happens on the internet, usually because I've read an article or in social media that Scott has also read.

9
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,619
Speaker 1: - And that would be news or thing of day, it wouldn't be opening bit.

10
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,020
Speaker 0: - Exactly, opening would be like, so I was riding my bike, but that's not gonna happen.

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,899
Speaker 1: - It has to be something that, I don't know.

12
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:07,979
Speaker 1: So I guess the only thing I got for an opening bit is that it's becoming, when we first got locked in the house, right?

13
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,257
Speaker 1: You know, I guess I worked in the house all summer, right?

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:25,160
Speaker 1: But for some reason, I didn't have a problem with this particular thing, right?

15
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,434
Speaker 1: But now, as the winter is ending, the Earth moves, right?

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,319
Speaker 0: - Oh, are you having sunlight coming in on your monitor?

17
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,339
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so the sunlight's come in and hitting me in the face at like, you know, earlier in the day.

18
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:44,037
Speaker 1: And it's hard to work, but I can't-- - Close your blinds.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,279
Speaker 1: - They are closed.

20
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,934
Speaker 0: - Then they're not blinds.

21
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,699
Speaker 1: - Well, they're not, you know, they're not, you know, the ones that we haven't-- - You need curtains and blinds.

22
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,560
Speaker 0: There's multiple layers you need in there.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,080
Speaker 1: - But we never had those in this room, in the office room.

24
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,280
Speaker 1: We have them in the bedroom, right?

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:08,220
Speaker 0: We don't have them in this room, and I can't like-- - We got some ones that are, they diffuse the light enough to where no amount of it can generate glare if they're down, but it doesn't block all the light.

26
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,479
Speaker 1: - Your window faces like a building.

27
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,400
Speaker 1: There's no light coming in.

28
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Speaker 0: - No, there is actually, there is a narrow channel, and just as every spring, like around this time of year, that channel where there's an unblocked view all the way past Queensborough Plaza Station, a beam of light would come in, and previously it would hit my monitor directly.

29
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:36,200
Speaker 0: But the way things were shifted around, it kind of goes between our two monitors now, but it is gone if I just close that little blind.

30
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,840
Speaker 1: The point is, is I can't get someone to come install a blind or a curtain.

31
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:43,180
Speaker 1: If I could do that, then I could go to the office.

32
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,313
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no-- - Install it yourself.

33
00:02:45,683 --> 00:02:46,420
Speaker 0: It's real easy.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,960
Speaker 1: - It's not that easy.

35
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,760
Speaker 0: - It's real easy, but I've installed many of them.

36
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,979
Speaker 0: I almost said, "I'll come and help you,".

37
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,599
Speaker 0: but no, that's the whole point, and I can't.

38
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:55,900
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,380
Speaker 1: - In my previous apartment, I installed it on my own, and it was not the greatest.

40
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,399
Speaker 1: It was a little, you know, a little dodgy.

41
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:10,499
Speaker 0: I don't know, maybe I'm better at that, or maybe you have a weird window?

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:21,219
Speaker 1: - I think the problem is, is that a lot of these, you know, in these apartments, right, the space on top of the windows is just like a concrete thing.

43
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,680
Speaker 0: - Ah, I only mount things to the sides on either side of the window, and in this apartment-- - Oh yeah, I used to have a, I had a tension rod.

44
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,480
Speaker 1: I guess I could do the tension rod again, which, no-- - No, not a tension rod.

45
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:38,280
Speaker 0: I put mounting brackets on both edges of the window on the sides, and then I mounted the thing on those brackets.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,900
Speaker 1: - There's already a rolly thing with brackets in that spot.

47
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:45,300
Speaker 1: This is like-- - So put something in front of the rolly thing.

48
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,700
Speaker 0: - Or take the rolly thing down.

49
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,460
Speaker 0: I just tore those rolly things down.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,339
Speaker 0: I tore the shitty things out, and I buried them in the back of a closet, and if we ever move out of this apartment, I'm gonna put 'em back and take my nice curtains with me.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,560
Speaker 1: - Well, that's, you know, that's the story, is that it's hard to work late in the day with the sun.

52
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:15,560
Speaker 0: - It is, it's funny, though, because I have a similar problem of, I've been, I was planning, like literally, right after PAX East, I was going to hire one of those services to have someone come and mount a TV on the wall so I could, like, make more floor space--.

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,398
Speaker 1: - I know a guy, you gotta get my guy.

54
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,576
Speaker 0: - And I was also gonna have them mount that monitor we have in the kitchen on the wall there, so it doesn't have to, like, sit.

55
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,500
Speaker 1: - My guy, my guy Abe, he'll hook you up.

56
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,798
Speaker 0: - That's exactly what I was gonna do.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,120
Speaker 0: Like, I had this plan, these three screens I wanna mount, because I could do that by myself, but fuck if I want to do that by myself.

58
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,080
Speaker 0: And also, unlike a curtain, the consequences of me doing it poorly are far more severe.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you know, and my guy Abe-- - I don't wanna wake up one night to, what was that sound, to discover that my TV is broken?

60
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,457
Speaker 1: - I mean, in my previous apartment, he hung the bike on the wall, and it never fell on me while I was sleeping, right?

61
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:55,239
Speaker 1: And he's hung two TVs on the wall that have not fallen down on any people.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,220
Speaker 0: - Yeah, basically, I wanna mount--.

63
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,160
Speaker 1: - And he hung these two long shelves on the wall in this office here, and they're not moving.

64
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,120
Speaker 0: - I was gonna mount ski racks way up by the ceiling.

65
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,920
Speaker 0: I was like, I got like 10 things, well, I got like seven things I wanna mount.

66
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:16,039
Speaker 0: And literally, I have this to-do box in my Google key that lists, like, mount the things, and it lists these seven things.

67
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:20,660
Speaker 0: And the date when I was gonna do this is the weekend after PAX East.

68
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,580
Speaker 0: So here I am with the old TV still sitting there on the thing.

69
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,740
Speaker 0: And also breaking, that TV's starting to die.

70
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:38,159
Speaker 0: It's getting dimmer and dimmer and dimmer, and whatever LED drives the optical audio out just doesn't light up anymore.

71
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,429
Speaker 1: - Okay.

72
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:40,959
Speaker 0: - Yep.

73
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Speaker 0: So I guess we can get right into news and such.

74
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,980
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, it's the lounge, we can talk about anything.

75
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,340
Speaker 1: - Sure, your lounge.

76
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,086
Speaker 0: - I have got--.

77
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:51,319
Speaker 1: - Let's talk about lounge, let's do a Thursday show on lounges.

78
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,800
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the whole episode about lounges?

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,860
Speaker 0: - I can talk a lot about lounges.

80
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:02,340
Speaker 0: In fact, I have very, I have a lot of opinions on what I like about lounges compared to bars.

81
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,991
Speaker 1: like, a lounge in your house, or a lounge as a place to go?

82
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,780
Speaker 0: - I'm talking about, like, a lounge that you would go to and have drinks in.

83
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,260
Speaker 1: - There's a lot of things that count as lounges.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Speaker 0: - I like loungewear, like leisure clothes.

85
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:15,813
Speaker 0: I like lounges.

86
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,239
Speaker 0: - A lounge chair.

87
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,534
Speaker 0: - Chase lounges in particular.

88
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:17,979
Speaker 1: - Lounging.

89
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,439
Speaker 0: - I like lounging.

90
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:21,678
Speaker 0: What I like the most, I think, an adjacent topic.

91
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,359
Speaker 0: there is sunken conversation pits.

92
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,960
Speaker 1: - What's the etymology of the word lounge, anyway?

93
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,309
Speaker 1: - Lounge, probably.

94
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:28,996
Speaker 1: - Could be French, French?

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,320
Speaker 0: - It's probably Latinic, if I had to guess.

96
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,137
Speaker 0: Oh, look it up right now.

97
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,459
Speaker 0: Lounge, etymology.

98
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,720
Speaker 1: - I'm already good with it.

99
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,080
Speaker 1: Early 16th century.

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,332
Speaker 0: - It's gotta be Latinic.

101
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:38,719
Speaker 0: - Something.

102
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,550
Speaker 0: - To move indolently.

103
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,320
Speaker 0: (laughs) - (laughs) - I'll tell you, if there's a--.

104
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,300
Speaker 1: - Latin, long, longus, long.

105
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,920
Speaker 0: - Lungus, a slow, lazy person.

106
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,040
Speaker 1: - Old French, elongie, lengthen.

107
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:54,079
Speaker 1: So there is some French Latin there.

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,078
Speaker 0: - Yep, lungus, a slow, lazy person, which came from an earlier term, longus, an idle, stupid dreamer.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,295
Speaker 1: - Okay.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,390
Speaker 0: - So, you know, if I'm gonna do something, there's two ways I like to do it, energetically or indolently.

111
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaker 0: (laughs) I guess grudgingly is the third way.

112
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:12,700
Speaker 0: Sometimes I do things grudgingly.

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
Speaker 1: - Anyway, all right, so here's the news.

114
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,279
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on with this news, even though it's a K-pop news, it actually, none of the discussion around this news has to do with actual K-pop, really.

115
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,239
Speaker 0: - All right, I-- - And a lot-- - I skip this and don't understand it, so.

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:41,998
Speaker 1: - And a lot of what it is is, you know, some of the things are, I can't confirm, 'cause obviously, A, I don't speak Korean, B, I've never been to Korea, and C, I gotta take some hearsay from people who claim to on the internet, right?

117
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:43,238
Speaker 1: But here's the deal.

118
00:07:44,962 --> 00:07:49,540
Speaker 1: Going back in K-pop time, right, well, first of all, just some foundational work, right?

119
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:56,539
Speaker 1: If you are a celebrity in the United States, you can commit relatively heinous crimes and maintain a career, right?

120
00:07:57,402 --> 00:07:59,900
Speaker 1: You can be a rapist, you can be a cult leader.

121
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,300
Speaker 0: - You can literally commit murder and lose a civil case.

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,718
Speaker 1: - You can murder people, right.

123
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:11,238
Speaker 1: And it's like, you can, you know, you could like, you know, the first one that always comes to mind for me are people like Mike Tyson, right, you know?

124
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:16,540
Speaker 1: And you can rehabilitate your career and get extra chances that you may or may not deserve.

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:24,539
Speaker 0: - There's a reason why in American lexicon of celebrity, there's the concept of like the apology to her, like that's a thing.

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 1: - And my opinion on that is basically like, yes, people should have second chances, but not until everyone gets a first chance, right?

127
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,099
Speaker 0: - Reconciliation comes after consequences.

128
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,880
Speaker 1: - You give somebody else a second chance, you just denied someone a first chance, right?

129
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,299
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's a limited number of chances.

130
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,780
Speaker 1: So give everyone a first chance, then we can talk about second chances.

131
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,180
Speaker 1: Anyway, in South Korea, the culture is much, much less lenient in these regards.

132
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:07,820
Speaker 1: If you commit or like not even necessarily convicted of a crime in like jail, but like if you just like got in trouble doing something, you know, slightly bad, your career is basically over.

133
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:20,099
Speaker 1: You have to, at minimum, like, you know, extremely apologize and like go into hiding and disappear from the public spotlight for an extended period of time until you believe it is safe to return, right?

134
00:09:21,323 --> 00:09:23,460
Speaker 1: And sometimes this is warranted, right?

135
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,278
Speaker 1: 'Cause people do still commit heinous crimes and then their careers are over, right?

136
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,259
Speaker 1: And that's kind of good.

137
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:33,900
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, people do things that basically shouldn't even be crimes.

138
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,020
Speaker 1: So recently a member of the boy group B2B, right?

139
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,830
Speaker 1: Got caught with weed.

140
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:43,779
Speaker 1: and in South Korea, you think weed is criminalized here, right?

141
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,940
Speaker 0: It's way more criminalized there, right?

142
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:51,520
Speaker 1: Actually got caught doing weed, basically career over permanently, right?

143
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,899
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, meanwhile, if he had just lived in the US, he could weed it up, no problem.

144
00:09:56,461 --> 00:10:00,940
Speaker 0: In fact, if anyone's state he's in, he could do it live on TV and no one could say anything.

145
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:09,036
Speaker 1: Right, so that's, you know, there's a whole, we could go down that road, but regardless, this opens two doors, right?

146
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:14,820
Speaker 1: You know, door A, if a celebrity does something, right?

147
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:22,739
Speaker 1: Then, you know, somebody could, you know, report it and ruin their career and they may or may not deserve that.

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,020
Speaker 1: But also people can falsely, right?

149
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,195
Speaker 1: Accuse celebrities of wrongdoing.

150
00:10:31,943 --> 00:10:40,799
Speaker 1: If, you know, perhaps they're just trolls and they hate that celebrity for whatever reason, you know, some teenager and there's like a band they don't like, they can, you know, accuse them.

151
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:50,240
Speaker 1: And, you know, if they, it might be hard to disprove and you could seriously disrupt somebody's career just by making some accusations.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,160
Speaker 1: Also, they don't have freedom of speech there.

153
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:58,140
Speaker 1: Like you wanna talk about censorship, like their TV is literally censored, right?

154
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:00,259
Speaker 1: The government says, no, you can't show that on TV.

155
00:11:02,063 --> 00:11:06,758
Speaker 1: And also, you can't just comment whatever you want on the internet there, right?

156
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:22,980
Speaker 1: If you comment and you say like false rumors, you spread false rumors on the internet there, you can like get sued and, you know, whoever you spread false rumors about can take you to court and you could be in actual real trouble for doing that, which is good and also bad.

157
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,420
Speaker 1: But that's not even the topic we're going to yet.

158
00:11:26,223 --> 00:11:41,437
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it looks like it's actually a little bit better than like the defamation rules in the UK from skimming this because it does separate defamation upon false claims from true claims, which is complicated and weird and I don't know enough about Korean law and I'm trying to like learn more about this now.

159
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,079
Speaker 1: - There was actually a YouTube video about that particular subject with some lawyers answering questions that I could maybe find the link to again, maybe.

160
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,680
Speaker 1: But this is the topic, right?

161
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,720
Speaker 1: So recently, you know, over time, there have been accusations of various idols, right?

162
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,240
Speaker 1: 'Cause idols are usually people who are, you know, maybe high school age, maybe just college age, right?

163
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,579
Speaker 1: So they're still pretty close to their school days.

164
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:15,840
Speaker 1: And there were at least a few idols who when they were in school, were bullies and shitty people, right?

165
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,260
Speaker 1: Who would harass classmates and abuse classmates to various degrees.

166
00:12:20,461 --> 00:12:24,940
Speaker 1: And they just happened to end up being celebrities after school, right?

167
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:30,820
Speaker 1: And in Korea, you know, bullying is not just like, you know, light teasing, right?

168
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,417
Speaker 1: If someone says bullying, we're talking about like, you know, usually hitting someone, right?

169
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,999
Speaker 1: You know, like really, you know, like demeaning and treating someone like a piece of shit on a regular basis.

170
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,140
Speaker 0: - I mean, like that is how a lot of bullying is here too, but there is a-- - Exactly.

171
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,879
Speaker 0: - But there's definitely, there is a, in Korea in particular, there has been a, there's a lot of news you can read about this.

172
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,699
Speaker 0: Like don't think I'm trying to claim to be an expert on Korea.

173
00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:00,359
Speaker 0: Bullying, especially in the equivalent of high school, is a specific societal problem that's trying to be addressed there.

174
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,880
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's a big problem.

175
00:13:02,163 --> 00:13:15,040
Speaker 1: And there, you know, it's like, I've seen some people who have said that the, who, I haven't seen any data for this and I don't believe it, that, you know, they used to have corporal punishment in schools, right?

176
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,879
Speaker 1: You used to just beat the kids in Korea a lot more recently than you were able to beat the kids in the US.

177
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,139
Speaker 1: I guess maybe, or maybe not, right?

178
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:22,669
Speaker 1: - Yep.

179
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,980
Speaker 0: - It wasn't that long ago that you-- - Fun fact, I was beaten in school 'cause I went to a Catholic school.

180
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:29,279
Speaker 1: - Right, sure.

181
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:37,140
Speaker 1: But there are people who are saying like, yeah, since that went away, kids were, now can bully and the teachers can't do anything about it.

182
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,880
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, I'm pretty sure the kids are probably, I'm pretty sure the kids are bullying before then also.

183
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,660
Speaker 0: - Yep, and also like in America at least, the teachers could do something, they just don't.

184
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,300
Speaker 0: And we've talked about that on Geek Nights before.

185
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,659
Speaker 1: - Right, so that's yet another topic, right?

186
00:13:52,101 --> 00:14:07,420
Speaker 1: But what's happening now is there were a few cases where people, you know, had the victims, right, they had the courage to call out the idols who bullied them accurately and they ruined people's careers, right?

187
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:09,878
Speaker 1: Perhaps deservingly so.

188
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,420
Speaker 1: But now what has happened is there are floodgates.

189
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:27,800
Speaker 1: Like there is, they had to make a mega thread because so many idols have been accused of bullying with varying degrees of, you know, truth or supporting evidence and whatnot, right?

190
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,540
Speaker 1: Basically it's like, well, whose career is over now, right?

191
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,840
Speaker 1: Is it real, is it not?

192
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:34,420
Speaker 1: Is this a troll, right?

193
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,140
Speaker 1: Normally under normal circumstances, you just believe the victims, right?

194
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,100
Speaker 1: That's the default, right?

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,877
Speaker 1: Believe the victims.

196
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,540
Speaker 1: But when you, this is like a special area where it's like, yeah, I wanna believe all the victims, of course.

197
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,140
Speaker 1: But there is such a large culture of anti-fandom, right?

198
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,840
Speaker 1: Where, you know, and there are so many people who have also been shown to be crying wolf, right?

199
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,486
Speaker 1: Like there is.

200
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:06,680
Speaker 1: some people were like, they accused someone of bullying and a whole bunch of people come out and they're like, actually I was in school with that person, you're full of shit, right?

201
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,975
Speaker 1: And so now you can't know, it's harder to believe the victim no matter how much you want to, right?

202
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:21,680
Speaker 1: It's like, even if you keep telling yourself to believe the victim and like, you know, all the wolf crying infects your brain.

203
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,440
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the intersection of celebrity and modern connected fan culture makes this a like perfect storm of difficult situation.

204
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:35,780
Speaker 1: - So now it's like, there's just this flood of constant accusations against various peoples.

205
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,500
Speaker 1: And it's like, well, is this person bad or not?

206
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,519
Speaker 1: I saw one the other day and based on internet, you know, text I read on the internet, which is nothing, right?

207
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,100
Speaker 1: It seemed like it was false.

208
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,539
Speaker 1: And there was another one I read today.

209
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:51,199
Speaker 1: that seems way bad, like it's true, right?

210
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:56,820
Speaker 1: You know, based on the text I read on the internet, which is, right, who knows, right?

211
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:57,680
Speaker 1: I never met these people.

212
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,260
Speaker 1: I don't speak their language, right?

213
00:15:59,641 --> 00:16:11,060
Speaker 1: So now the other interesting thing, and I don't know how true this is, but regardless of whether this is true, part of it is true and it's very interesting.

214
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,800
Speaker 1: So in Korea, they have Naver, which is basically Korean Google, right?

215
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:22,580
Speaker 1: You know, Webtoon, that thing we talk about frequently, Naver runs that, Naver runs a lot of stuff.

216
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,777
Speaker 1: But if you're doing a web search in Korea, you're using Naver, you're not using google.com, right?

217
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:33,759
Speaker 1: And on the Naver homepage, they have, it's not like the Google homepage where it's just a search box.

218
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:40,039
Speaker 1: They list like, here are the top 10 things people are searching for right now, real time search rankings.

219
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:43,679
Speaker 1: And that's kind of a big deal.

220
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,700
Speaker 1: Like people, you'll see celebrities be like, woo, I released my song and I was number five in the real time search rankings, right?

221
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:56,460
Speaker 1: It's like people are paying attention to that thing more than we pay attention to like Twitter trending topic.

222
00:16:56,941 --> 00:17:06,339
Speaker 0: - Yup, I mean Twitter trending topic is ignored unless, the only time I've ever clicked on one is when I can't fathom what is trending around that word.

223
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:20,619
Speaker 1: - So a true thing is that they're actually going to be removing, I don't know the exact details 'cause I can't read the homepage, but one of those trending sections is like gonna get removed from the Naver homepage.

224
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,596
Speaker 1: Like they announced this.

225
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,819
Speaker 1: So someone suggested that it could be possible, right?

226
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:41,380
Speaker 1: That the flood of accusations are coming because once that thing is gone, you won't be able to get the attention on your accusation anymore.

227
00:17:41,642 --> 00:17:45,720
Speaker 1: And people are rushing to make the accusations while that thing is still there.

228
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:51,819
Speaker 1: So I don't know if that part is true, but the part about the trending thing being a big deal there and it being removed soon is true.

229
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:55,900
Speaker 1: But that's just really fascinating, right?

230
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:06,939
Speaker 1: Like imagine if Twitter was like, we're gonna remove Twitter trends next week, what would people do this week in terms of manipulating Twitter trending topics while it was still a thing?

231
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,900
Speaker 1: - I think the differences-- - How would people's behavior change next week after it was gone?

232
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,073
Speaker 0: - I think the difference is generally.

233
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:18,560
Speaker 0: American fan cultures have never been like organized around trying to make things trend.

234
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:34,958
Speaker 0: It's mostly been like bots driving that sort of thing, usually for political purposes or like or K-pop stuff often gets forced that way often from the fans, but I bet nothing would change and nothing would be different because Twitter trends are not the cultural touchstone here that a lot of people seem to think they are.

235
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,360
Speaker 1: - What if the Google homepage showed you the top 10 things people are searching for right now in real time?

236
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,598
Speaker 0: - Yup, I wonder what that would look like.

237
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,200
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I know, there is that other page they have, the Google whatever, Google trends or whatever.

238
00:18:49,281 --> 00:18:51,659
Speaker 1: that shows you stuff, but no one goes there, right?

239
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,199
Speaker 1: Would that change people's behavior?

240
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:14,660
Speaker 0: - This is why this is such a, like there's so many topics here in this news because like that microtopic of like fan culture and like organized fan activism for the intellectual property that they happen to enjoy and how weirdly organized and rabid they're getting about it as time goes on.

241
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,299
Speaker 0: Like there's a whole week of Geek Nights episodes about just that.

242
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:28,076
Speaker 1: - Right, I can just say, all I can say is that A, it's one of those cases, much like GameStop where someone has found a way to push the buttons on their keyboard, right?

243
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,929
Speaker 1: Do nothing, don't have to leave your chair, you can just push buttons on your keyboard and cause real consequences for real people in the real world.

244
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:41,560
Speaker 0: - I mean, we had that news the other week where someone added a bunch of poison to the water supply by just touching buttons on a keyboard.

245
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,200
Speaker 1: - Sure, but that was a more difficult button pushing.

246
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,219
Speaker 0: - Well, apparently it wasn't, but anyway.

247
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,139
Speaker 1: - Well, for someone who has to have some amount of technological prowess, right?

248
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,900
Speaker 1: This is literally like you can tweet and cause problems in the world, right?

249
00:19:55,625 --> 00:20:02,800
Speaker 1: You can sign up for an E-Trade account and push a button and cause GameStop stock to, you know, cause Wall Street to panic, right?

250
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,279
Speaker 0: - Well, it gets down to a fundamental thing.

251
00:20:04,581 --> 00:20:12,740
Speaker 1: - That power of being able to put just, without that much technological knowledge, just being able to touch your phone in a pattern, right?

252
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:22,776
Speaker 1: Just rub the face of your phone and the world changes is so alluring that whenever it's possible, whenever someone finds a way to do that, people will do that.

253
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,540
Speaker 0: - Well, we talked about this, in 2016, we did a panel at a PAX called The Grind.

254
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:40,437
Speaker 0: We're talking about grinding in games, but we talked a lot about the problems that arise in any system, doesn't have to be a game, when the incremental cost of taking an action that has some sort of meaningful effect approaches zero.

255
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:52,459
Speaker 0: Couple that with the way social media lets people organize those basically costless transactions, the costless actions they can take.

256
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:04,459
Speaker 0: It's very, instead of an old day where you would have to hit that button a million times, you can hit a button once and 999,000 other people will each then hit that button once and have the same effect.

257
00:21:05,843 --> 00:21:10,040
Speaker 1: - Yep, well, it is a cyberpunk tale, the likes of which geek nights cannot ignore.

258
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,615
Speaker 1: And that is the news.

259
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,479
Speaker 0: - I'm sure we'll be talking about topics and fallout from this for some time to come.

260
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:30,478
Speaker 0: So if there was ever a news that was a like, where if we brought up the topic or like this came up in conversation, a random listener or Scott or anyone who knows me would say, wow, that's a really rim thing to be talking about right now.

261
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:31,998
Speaker 0: This news will be up there.

262
00:21:32,462 --> 00:21:36,899
Speaker 0: This would be up there with things like, we're talking about how nuclear weapons are made or how to set clocks.

263
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,920
Speaker 1: (laughing) - How to make annoying noises.

264
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,147
Speaker 1: - Wah.

265
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
Speaker 1: - If the clock on the trumpet was set improperly.

266
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:55,540
Speaker 0: - So this, if you're not familiar, Scott, with the mystery and I'm making quote fingers here of Dyatlov Pass, like have you ever heard of that thing?

267
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,438
Speaker 1: - No.

268
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,179
Speaker 0: - Really?

269
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,479
Speaker 1: - Maybe I don't.

270
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,060
Speaker 1: Maybe I do know it and I just don't know the name of it.

271
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,396
Speaker 0: - You might.

272
00:22:02,881 --> 00:22:10,480
Speaker 0: So this is the kind of thing that people tell ghost stories and have conspiracy theories about it, but the thing itself really happened.

273
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,800
Speaker 0: Basically in 1959, and I know a lot about this because it's fucking rim, like it's me, what do you want?

274
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,699
Speaker 0: You'll see why this is up my alley in a minute.

275
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:19,717
Speaker 0: - Uh-huh.

276
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:28,537
Speaker 0: - A bunch of kids like went out on a hike into the wilderness in 1959 in some mountains in Russia and they never came home.

277
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,833
Speaker 0: So people were like, oh, like.

278
00:22:30,873 --> 00:22:33,097
Speaker 0: they sent a search party to go find out like what happened to these kids.

279
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:43,840
Speaker 0: And they eventually found in the Dyatlov Pass, which is an area they were gonna be hiking through, they found their naked, mutilated, radioactive bodies.

280
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,840
Speaker 1: - Okay, I have not heard this story.

281
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Speaker 0: - It was like the biggest news in 1959.

282
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,120
Speaker 0: Like this was a mystery.

283
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,039
Speaker 1: - Well, I wasn't around then, so.

284
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,220
Speaker 0: - But yeah, so in the Soviet Union, like this was a big deal.

285
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,340
Speaker 1: Like it was a mystery.

286
00:22:59,340 --> 00:22:59,728
Speaker 1: - I'd say so.

287
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,220
Speaker 0: - What the fuck happened to these people?

288
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:08,593
Speaker 1: - That's probably, that's an even bigger news than the kids trapped underwater that happened a little, you know, when was that, 100 years ago?

289
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:09,411
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

290
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,420
Speaker 1: - It was Thailand, right?

291
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,320
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I recall.

292
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,460
Speaker 0: - That feels like it was from a different time and it feels like it happened right after Dyatlov Pass.

293
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Speaker 0: - So anyway, this was a real mystery that was solved for, like it is solved and has been solved for a long time from a. this is probably what happened standpoint, but there were so many weird attributes of the story that no scientists could say, yes, 100%, this is what explains like weird part of the--.

294
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,880
Speaker 1: - You can't 100% explain anything.

295
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,233
Speaker 0: - Exactly, solipsism, fuck it.

296
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:46,858
Speaker 0: Drop the mic.

297
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,960
Speaker 0: But conspiracy people and UFO people in the '60s were obsessed with this, so.

298
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,439
Speaker 1: - Of course, why wouldn't you be?

299
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,600
Speaker 0: - And to this day, people are obsessed with this.

300
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:14,080
Speaker 0: There is an article that came out recently like this year where the part of this that was actually unexplained is pretty definitively explained thanks to Disney's Frozen, the movie.

301
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,038
Speaker 0: Literally, no joke.

302
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:19,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, this article is fascinating.

303
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,079
Speaker 0: I can break it down pretty quick 'cause I'm a weird nerd.

304
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:29,200
Speaker 0: So here are the things that were strange about the incident when they found their bodies and I can explain them all with common sense.

305
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,020
Speaker 0: One, the bodies were all naked.

306
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,180
Speaker 0: That makes sense.

307
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,380
Speaker 1: - They were probably fucking in the woods.

308
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:36,220
Speaker 0: there's a thing called paradoxical undressing.

309
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,559
Speaker 0: Humans will just take off their clothes.

310
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,647
Speaker 1: - Okay.

311
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:40,300
Speaker 1: - That's interesting.

312
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,379
Speaker 0: You didn't know that?

313
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Speaker 1: - I knew a lot about hypothermia, but I didn't know that about hypothermia.

314
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,360
Speaker 1: - Okay, so if you are ever-- - Thank you voyage of the Mimi.

315
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:47,722
Speaker 1: - All

316
00:24:47,742 --> 00:25:01,277
Speaker 0: right, my advice to you, Scott, in case this ever comes up, 'cause I think this might've been important that you didn't know this, if you are ever really cold and then with nothing changes, you start to feel too warm and you feel like you should take your clothes off, fucking don't.

317
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,920
Speaker 0: Your body is lying to you because it's broken.

318
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,380
Speaker 0: People who are experiencing hypothermia will literally undress themselves.

319
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,759
Speaker 0: Like it's like, that is a thing.

320
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,640
Speaker 0: So obviously hypothermia, that's why they were naked.

321
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,980
Speaker 0: Two, their eyes were missing.

322
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,588
Speaker 0: Coyotes or something.

323
00:25:18,608 --> 00:25:19,498
Speaker 0: just ate them, like duh.

324
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,899
Speaker 0: That's like animals will go after the eyes first.

325
00:25:22,542 --> 00:25:23,840
Speaker 0: But I can see why that would have been creepy.

326
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,920
Speaker 0: They found these bodies and their eyes were missing and they were naked.

327
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,279
Speaker 1: - Weren't there other animals chewing on other parts?

328
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,460
Speaker 1: - They were like a little bit.

329
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,500
Speaker 1: - When you see bite marks near the eyes or something?

330
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,299
Speaker 0: - There were some bite marks and things too, but like the eyes were missing from literally every body and people were like weirded out by that.

331
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,759
Speaker 0: Also remember, some of these things, only conspiracy nut jobs were weirded out by.

332
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,559
Speaker 0: The Soviet like researchers who like were studying this explained these things pretty straight away.

333
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:57,220
Speaker 0: Mystery three, all the people had suffered severe blunt traumas, like they had been beaten with baseball bats.

334
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,800
Speaker 0: That was unexplained at the time.

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,539
Speaker 1: - Someone beat them.

336
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:07,320
Speaker 0: - One of the theories was they were murdered 'cause they got close to some Soviet like military thing or UFOs or whatever.

337
00:26:07,662 --> 00:26:08,680
Speaker 0: But that's the part they solved.

338
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,079
Speaker 0: That was the one unsolved part.

339
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,619
Speaker 1: That was actually unsolved.

340
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
Speaker 1: - Has "Frozen" solved that part?

341
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,038
Speaker 0: - Science has solved that part with the movie

342
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:15,220
Speaker 0: "Frozen.".

343
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,300
Speaker 1: - "Frozen" solved that part.

344
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,536
Speaker 0: - Yes.

345
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,460
Speaker 0: So part four, the bodies were found scattered across a wide area.

346
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,519
Speaker 0: Like a few of them were found way down in the woods.

347
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,999
Speaker 1: A few of them were found- - They were trying to walk for help and they died in different places.

348
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:38,820
Speaker 0: - Yep, the ones who weren't beaten to death were running to get help, or at least get somewhere like in the trees to then try to make a fire and warm up before they died.

349
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,460
Speaker 0: Some of them were dragging bodies- - Makes common sense.

350
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,678
Speaker 0: - Or trying to rescue the other people who were hurt, et cetera.

351
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,160
Speaker 1: - I'd be surprised if they all died in the same spot.

352
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,699
Speaker 1: Like if you're sitting there with your, I don't know, eight friends and they're all dead, are you just gonna keep sitting there?

353
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:58,039
Speaker 0: It's like- - Yeah, if you find a campfire with eight skeletons sitting around it, that is suspicious as fuck.

354
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,659
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that's way more suspicious than some bodies around.

355
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:08,682
Speaker 0: - All right, the bodies were radioactive, which was a sensible, like.

356
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:13,320
Speaker 0: that seems to be true that the bodies, there was radiation- - It's Soviet Russia, there's uranium just in the woods.

357
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:13,813
Speaker 0: - Nope.

358
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:17,160
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of- - They ate too many bananas, all bananas.

359
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,360
Speaker 0: - There's a lot of nut job conspiracy theories about that.

360
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,260
Speaker 0: The answer is pretty simple.

361
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,597
Speaker 0: This is another thing that anyone who camps would already know.

362
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,860
Speaker 0: Camping lights are radioactive.

363
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,299
Speaker 0: Like there's thorium in them.

364
00:27:27,502 --> 00:27:28,097
Speaker 0: That's how they work.

365
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,248
Speaker 1: - Oh, well in 1950 something, yeah.

366
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,400
Speaker 0: - Even today, you can get camping lights, unless you're- - Not if it's a lithium LED thing.

367
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,280
Speaker 0: - No, but if it's powered by kerosene.

368
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,660
Speaker 1: - Sure, but no, you're not using those.

369
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,144
Speaker 1: 1958, in 1958 you are.

370
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,538
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but even in modern times, there are often use cases for a kerosene lantern because they also provide heat.

371
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:51,260
Speaker 1: - Hmm, maybe.

372
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,040
Speaker 0: - And they're way brighter than LEDs.

373
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:55,000
Speaker 1: Like for how much- - Depends on the LEDs.

374
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,479
Speaker 0: - For how much fuel and weight you have to carry with you.

375
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:06,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, the way camp lanterns work is they don't actually, it's not the fire that is providing the light.

376
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,099
Speaker 0: The fire is actually really small.

377
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:13,400
Speaker 0: There's a metal mantle around it that gets heated up by the fire and then it radiates light.

378
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:19,734
Speaker 0: They use thorium and other nonsense that happens to glow with more visible light and less infrared light.

379
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:21,679
Speaker 0: Like that's that.

380
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,539
Speaker 0: That explains the radiation, but the radiation is also the thing that the UFO nut jobs are all obsessed with.

381
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:33,419
Speaker 0: So this article explains why the bodies looked like someone had taken a baseball bat to them.

382
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,640
Speaker 1: Originally, common sense people assumed- - That's what happens to your flesh when you get frozen?

383
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,420
Speaker 0: - Nope, so common sense people had assumed there must've been an avalanche, they were sleeping in their tents and avalanche happened.

384
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,400
Speaker 0: They were like pushed down the mountain and hurt severely.

385
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,780
Speaker 0: And then they tried to like make a fire, get help, help their friends and slowly- - How long did it take them to find the bodies?

386
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,480
Speaker 0: - Weeks, months.

387
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,200
Speaker 1: - Then you'd still, you'd see evidence of an avalanche, I think.

388
00:29:02,682 --> 00:29:04,400
Speaker 0: - So that's where it gets complicated.

389
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:13,439
Speaker 1: Possibly not because avalanches are not that well understood, especially- - You'd see that up on the mountain there wasn't enough snow and there was too much snow down by the bottom.

390
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,840
Speaker 0: - Avalanches aren't around, there was snow there and now it's down here.

391
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:20,980
Speaker 0: They're more around a surface in layering of snow shifts.

392
00:29:21,681 --> 00:29:25,760
Speaker 0: And if you're not an expert and depending on the terrain, like that is not as straightforward as you would think.

393
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:36,680
Speaker 0: But also all the data we had as of like last year showed that avalanches don't cause that severity of blunt trauma.

394
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:41,920
Speaker 1: Like they don't beat you up- - You just get buried in snow and suffocate and freeze.

395
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,880
Speaker 0: So how come these people looked like they were beaten to death and then some of them froze to death?

396
00:29:48,642 --> 00:29:50,618
Speaker 0: Like one, an avalanche couldn't really cause that.

397
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:54,880
Speaker 0: And two, the terrain they were on shouldn't be able to have an avalanche.

398
00:29:55,823 --> 00:29:58,599
Speaker 0: At least not to the scale that would have been necessary to cause this disaster.

399
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:12,520
Speaker 0: Effectively, the snow that was used, the effects in the movie "Frozen" led to developments to do avalanche simulations that were much more precise and accurate than we had done previously.

400
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:33,640
Speaker 0: And researchers were able to simulate the kinds of conditions in this particular region and determined that in the right conditions, it's rare but not impossible, an avalanche and that type of terrain, which would seem impossible even to experts, could happen suddenly and would cause that kind of blunt trauma specifically.

401
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:47,400
Speaker 0: - They were killed by a freak, like one in a million avalanche because where they happened to camp was a place that by all knowledge of experts at that time and until recently, should not be able to have an avalanche.

402
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:48,840
Speaker 0: They miscalculated.

403
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:54,440
Speaker 0: They just got really unlucky and set up camp in the wrong spot and were murdered by a ridiculous avalanche.

404
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,920
Speaker 1: And this article- - That's a good reason to stay inside in the winter and not go skiing or do anything else stupid in the mountain.

405
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,259
Speaker 1: - So, sorry- - The lesson here is don't ski.

406
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Speaker 0: - Sorry, weird nerds.

407
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:14,680
Speaker 0: It wasn't a natural uranium reactor that formed in this ravine due to the shape of the mountain nor was it UFOs.

408
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,240
Speaker 1: - Don't ski, don't hike, stay inside.

409
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,570
Speaker 0: - But anyway, things of the day.

410
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:33,270
Speaker 0: So a few of you, more than one person and fewer than 10 people have been commenting on my beard over the course of this.

411
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,929
Speaker 0: 'cause I generally don't wear a beard and during quarantine, I've been wearing a beard.

412
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:46,690
Speaker 0: So the annoyance of a beard is that it's actually, assuming you are lucky enough if you want a beard to have the kind of hair that will grow into a nice beard.

413
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:49,021
Speaker 0: 'cause some people just can't grow a beard even if they want one.

414
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,550
Speaker 0: - That's true.

415
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,089
Speaker 0: - Assuming like you're past that point.

416
00:31:52,870 --> 00:32:01,390
Speaker 0: The other problem with a beard is if you just, most people, if you just let a beard grow naturally, you're gonna look like a deranged mountain man eventually.

417
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:02,435
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:08,509
Speaker 0: You might look like someone who knows a lot about posix and eunuchs, like.

419
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:18,187
Speaker 0: - But if you try to trim a beard, it is very easy to fuck it up and then you have to get rid of the whole thing.

420
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:37,770
Speaker 0: Beards are actually like, they're much like much, the reason why people who style hair have to get certifications and get some training is one, for racism that we'll talk about in another episode someday, but two, because it is a skill, like dealing with hair is, and like styling it is really difficult.

421
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,848
Speaker 0: There's a reason why everyone's hair looks like shit right now.

422
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:53,830
Speaker 0: 'cause we can't go get haircuts from people who know what they're doing and it's really hard to do that right at home unless either someone you know is an expert or two, you have a really simple hairstyle that you can achieve without having to have much knowledge or skill.

423
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:00,967
Speaker 0: So I had to learn how to take care of my beard better without just going to a barber to do it.

424
00:33:01,027 --> 00:33:05,429
Speaker 0: for me and of all the videos and things I found, this one's the best.

425
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:17,345
Speaker 0: This is like, this is a 10 minute video that will explain in like very specific detail exactly how to shape a beard if you want to have a beard, kind of like the one that I'm sporting right now.

426
00:33:18,653 --> 00:33:23,230
Speaker 0: And I learned a bunch of tricks and it made it way easier to manage my beard during quarantine.

427
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:29,630
Speaker 1: - My major beard problem was not a problem with the beard itself, it was face skin problems.

428
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:34,110
Speaker 0: - Oh, this talks about that too, about like beard oil, all the different ways to keep face skin.

429
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,429
Speaker 1: - I tried that shit, it didn't work.

430
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:38,668
Speaker 1: It partially worked.

431
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:48,569
Speaker 1: It's much easier to take care of my face skin, it was much easier to shave the beard and rub shit on my face skin than to do.

432
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,890
Speaker 0: - I'll get stuff in like my chest hair area but I'm very lucky in that I don't have any like face skin problems at all.

433
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,470
Speaker 1: - I don't either, if I keep shaving my face and applying things to my face.

434
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:13,489
Speaker 0: - But the one takeaway, if you don't watch this video and you are the kind of person who has a beard but the beard just feels like it looks messy and shitty, it's shaping a beard requires kind of constant upkeep.

435
00:34:13,914 --> 00:34:19,389
Speaker 0: but people who have beards that you might think, oh, they look really good, it's because they're literally doing this like every couple of days.

436
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,648
Speaker 0: You can't just have a beard unless you're really lucky, you actually got to do stuff to it.

437
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:36,188
Speaker 1: - I think the other thing is that, regardless of your shaping, is like you have to start the beard, you do just sort of have to like, let it go until it reaches point X and then you do the shape of the beard.

438
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,929
Speaker 0: - This video actually talks about that, let it go until it hits that point.

439
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:41,770
Speaker 0: 'cause if you try to shape it before then, it's gonna look terrible.

440
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,270
Speaker 1: - Exactly, you just gotta let it go until you have the beard.

441
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,609
Speaker 1: then you can start doing it and then you have to keep doing it.

442
00:34:48,389 --> 00:35:02,390
Speaker 0: - But the main reason I make this my thing of the day is that everything they tell you in this video, you can do at home if you have any sort of clipper and any way to shave yourself, like you don't need specialized equipment or like anything super fancy.

443
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:04,250
Speaker 1: - You need something sharp.

444
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:10,749
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and it's aimed at you doing it to yourself in front of a mirror, it doesn't require another person to help you.

445
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,670
Speaker 1: - That is something that's different about a beard versus hair, right?

446
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,269
Speaker 1: It's all in the front.

447
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:16,369
Speaker 1: Hair, you gotta do the back.

448
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,231
Speaker 0: - It even solved the problem and it was an obvious solution for me that I always have of.

449
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:30,430
Speaker 0: I try to make the two lines like the same size on both sides of my face and then I make one of them too short, I try to make the other one match, I made it too short and then the whole beard's gone.

450
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:33,770
Speaker 0: I have avoided that for months thanks to this video.

451
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,469
Speaker 1: - Oh, good, all right.

452
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:36,769
Speaker 1: So I got a thing of the day here.

453
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:45,990
Speaker 1: All around the world people are playing sports that they shouldn't, but I guess there's nothing I could do to stop them really, so I'll whatever.

454
00:35:46,991 --> 00:35:52,570
Speaker 1: One of the sports, a sport I don't pay attention to often but I have some amount of respect for is rugby.

455
00:35:54,972 --> 00:36:02,670
Speaker 1: And there is a team of rugby players that I didn't know existed called the Kaiviti Silk Tails from Fiji.

456
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:15,469
Speaker 1: They're the Fiji professional rugby team and under normal circumstances they would play and I guess it's the NSWRL, I guess that stands for New South Wales Rugby League I imagine.

457
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,509
Speaker 0: - I'm pretty confident you are correct.

458
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:29,969
Speaker 1: - And the coach of the Kaiviti Silk Tails is a person named Wes Nyguama, I think I'm pronouncing the name correctly because I heard an announcer at a rugby game say it on YouTube.

459
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:34,810
Speaker 1: And he is a famous former rugby player.

460
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:43,529
Speaker 0: - That's always dangerous though because I literally had a teacher in high school when we were learning about Goethe who pronounced it-- - Goeth.

461
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:51,209
Speaker 0: - Goeth and I had another teacher at RIT, a professor who also pronounced it Goeth.

462
00:36:52,210 --> 00:37:11,209
Speaker 1: - Yep, but I know for a fact though that like for example, if you're a hockey announcer you gotta pronounce a lot of names, French Canadian names, European names and I know for a fact that the hockey announcers go and they talk to the players or have someone else do it and they get the correct pronunciations and practice them at least if they're any good at the job.

463
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,149
Speaker 1: So I trust a sports announcer pronunciation more than a teacher pronunciation.

464
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,797
Speaker 1: Anyway, so this team wanted to play in the season.

465
00:37:22,837 --> 00:37:24,890
Speaker 1: that was happening in Australia, right?

466
00:37:25,914 --> 00:37:26,848
Speaker 1: But you know, they're in Fiji.

467
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:30,489
Speaker 1: So what the fuck they gonna do with this pandemic going on?

468
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:31,770
Speaker 1: They got a situation.

469
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:36,910
Speaker 1: The pandemic I guess is less bad down there but it's not non-existent.

470
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,249
Speaker 1: They still got a quarantine and such.

471
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,447
Speaker 1: So the plan was this.

472
00:37:41,211 --> 00:37:42,542
Speaker 1: They would go to Sydney.

473
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:47,907
Speaker 1: I assume they had like a flight or a boat or something just to themselves as guy, right?

474
00:37:48,491 --> 00:37:53,126
Speaker 1: They went to Sydney and they went to this hotel and they stayed in that hotel, right?

475
00:37:53,690 --> 00:38:01,770
Speaker 1: Pretty much with no one else for 14 days and they survived a quarantine for 14 days to prove that they didn't bring any COVID from Fiji.

476
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:08,530
Speaker 1: and then they can go about engaging in their rugby play according to whatever protocols that league has set up, right?

477
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:11,530
Speaker 1: That seems all perfectly normal, right?

478
00:38:11,853 --> 00:38:14,212
Speaker 1: And for 2021.

479
00:38:14,212 --> 00:38:16,490
Speaker 1: So what the hell about this is a thing of the day.

480
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,381
Speaker 1: Here's what it is.

481
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,490
Speaker 1: Before, after they finished their quarantine, right?

482
00:38:22,392 --> 00:38:27,089
Speaker 1: The team, the hotel architecture just happens to be really conducive to this.

483
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,689
Speaker 0: - Oh wow, yeah, you're right.

484
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:29,288
Speaker 0: Look at that.

485
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:47,890
Speaker 1: - The team came out and to thank the hotel staff for taking care of them in their 14 days of isolated quarantine in the Sydney hotel where presumably no one else was staying other than them and the staff and presumably the staff weren't leaving.

486
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:50,730
Speaker 1: 'Cause I guess they must've been quarantined in there with them, right?

487
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,849
Speaker 1: Otherwise it makes no sense.

488
00:38:53,552 --> 00:38:55,369
Speaker 1: The staff could have just brought in some COVID, right?

489
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:58,270
Speaker 1: They sang the staff.

490
00:38:58,351 --> 00:39:00,889
Speaker 1: I'm sure they paid them also, but I hope they did.

491
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:07,368
Speaker 1: But they sang the staff this congratulatory song or thank you song, I guess.

492
00:39:09,095 --> 00:39:12,910
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, let me see your professional sports team sing, right?

493
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:16,789
Speaker 0: - God, I just imagine like trying to hear the Rangers sing something together.

494
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,428
Speaker 0: - Kratty could play the piano at least.

495
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,164
Speaker 1: - They can barely sing like a holiday song to play on the jumbotron.

496
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,009
Speaker 1: How are they gonna sing a thank you song to the hotel staff?

497
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,790
Speaker 1: But yeah, really good singing here.

498
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:31,690
Speaker 1: They could form a little choir on the side.

499
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:33,329
Speaker 1: A little chorus, yeah.

500
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:33,905
Speaker 0: - Cool biz.

501
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,204
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, can't fucking go anywhere.

502
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,867
Speaker 0: So let's get right into it.

503
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,509
Speaker 0: Leftovers, one, it's a food show.

504
00:39:42,952 --> 00:39:44,170
Speaker 0: Somehow we haven't talked about this.

505
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,069
Speaker 0: We got another food show.

506
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,810
Speaker 1: - Yeah, leftovers could refer to a lot of other things that are leftover, but we're talking about food leftovers.

507
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,770
Speaker 0: - Yeah, food leftovers.

508
00:39:51,650 --> 00:40:00,947
Speaker 1: - The common use of the word is when you had some food and then you didn't eat all of it, there's some leftover food and you eat it later or you don't eat it later.

509
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,850
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that latter one's important.

510
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,370
Speaker 0: But there are two distinct classes of leftovers.

511
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,050
Speaker 0: Leftovers you get from a restaurant, like a doggy bag and food you made.

512
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,388
Speaker 1: - Yup, and you made too much.

513
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:28,609
Speaker 0: - But what's interesting about this topic, I think the reason why it actually kind of makes sense to talk about it now is that if I look at my life, my entire childhood, leftovers were really important because as a family, my parents were busy and cooking food was a pain in the ass and we didn't always have time.

514
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:34,930
Speaker 0: Leftovers were a great way to plan meals in such a way that they didn't have to cook as much for a family.

515
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,089
Speaker 0: And then-- - Yeah, my mom would cook.

516
00:40:37,491 --> 00:40:42,350
Speaker 1: She would cook one night and then two days later, we would eat the food from two days previous.

517
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,230
Speaker 1: You know, so she doesn't have to cook again.

518
00:40:44,450 --> 00:41:02,209
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, why should, you know, if you cook, even if a smaller portion or a larger portion doesn't significantly increase or decrease the cooking effort, depending on what you're cooking, obviously, but you know, it's like, you know, if I'm making cookies, for example, right, putting more flour into the mixer doesn't take longer.

519
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:08,970
Speaker 1: I can make more cookies in the same amount of time as long as I don't have to do a second mix, right?

520
00:41:09,492 --> 00:41:19,929
Speaker 0: So then, leftovers became extremely important to me personally when I was at RIT because I was poor as shit and couldn't even afford food.

521
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:27,470
Speaker 0: So making a meal that was big enough to eat like three more times was really important to my survival.

522
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:39,569
Speaker 0: Like I would plan my meals, or like I'd cook that giant beef bolognese like spaghetti thing and you and I would eat it for like three or four days sometimes, get a little dodgy toward that fourth day.

523
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,509
Speaker 1: - Regardless, yeah, that's how it goes.

524
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:55,769
Speaker 0: - And that continued into like our lives in Beacon when we had to commute 'cause we didn't have time, like our whole life was structured around, let's cook few meals that can then be re-eaten on later days so we don't have to cook every single day.

525
00:41:55,992 --> 00:41:58,824
Speaker 0: 'Cause we had to take a train home for an hour and then record gig nights.

526
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:00,749
Speaker 0: 'cause back then we did gig nights four nights a week.

527
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,670
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you get that crock pot going, right?

528
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:06,550
Speaker 1: And that's gonna feed you for like a few days, right?

529
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:16,750
Speaker 1: And the thing is, there's a question of like, when is it, it's sort of an arbitrary distinction of like, when is it leftovers and when is it just meal prep, right?

530
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:37,650
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's what a lot of people, I know a lot of people is like, I've even heard of like families doing this where like they'll do meal prep, like they'll spend, it was a guy I worked with years ago, at least 10 years ago and his family, whole family would like, parents, siblings, on Sunday, they would do meal prep and cook a shit ton of food and like fill their fridge with cooked meals.

531
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:40,589
Speaker 1: And I don't even know if they would eat one of those meals on Sunday.

532
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:44,250
Speaker 1: It would just be, and then the rest of the week, they wouldn't cook anything.

533
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,669
Speaker 1: They would just be eating those, you know, for lunch, dinner, whatever.

534
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:49,810
Speaker 0: - My line, I have two lines there, I think.

535
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,210
Speaker 0: Like when it, by default, everything is food prep.

536
00:42:53,531 --> 00:43:00,970
Speaker 0: It is leftovers if you ate some of it and then you put the rest of it away, like after you ate that.

537
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:07,149
Speaker 0: You get a big casserole out, you're eating a bunch of it, you look at what's left and you package up, put it back in the fridge, leftovers.

538
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:14,450
Speaker 1: - Right, well, the ultimate leftover is when you have a family feast of some kind, a Thanksgiving, a Seder coming up, right?

539
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,210
Speaker 1: Some kind of holiday feast, right?

540
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:23,550
Speaker 1: And you make stuff during those feasts, like a whole damn turkey or a whole big blob of potato.

541
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:24,729
Speaker 0: - Cal and a stuffing.

542
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:27,950
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you make like a pile of food, right?

543
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:36,964
Speaker 1: And then people just sort of serve themselves from that buffet family style and there's gotta be leftover, it's unavoidable, unless you invite way too many families.

544
00:43:37,024 --> 00:43:37,790
Speaker 1: and then, right?

545
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:40,470
Speaker 1: And that's the ultimate leftover.

546
00:43:40,531 --> 00:43:42,189
Speaker 1: 'cause that is the tastiest food.

547
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,790
Speaker 0: - Well, 'cause also it's usually the special food that you don't make that often in your normal life.

548
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:47,167
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah.

549
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,029
Speaker 0: - Like I like stuffing, I don't make stuffing like that often.

550
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,628
Speaker 1: - It's also conducive to reheating.

551
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,590
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

552
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:08,330
Speaker 0: - But where something also becomes leftover is, even if you did the meal prep, if all you really like ate some of it, but maybe you like cut it in half first and put one half in the fridge and ate one half right away.

553
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:14,489
Speaker 0: If the only thing you have to do to it is just reheat it, might also just be considered leftovers.

554
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:23,550
Speaker 0: But if it's like, you've gotta actually do a primary cooking or a primary kitchen thing to it, other than just reheating it, then it might've been more meal prep.

555
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:32,910
Speaker 1: - Right, 'cause like you might make meatballs and then you might sauce up half the meatballs and then just put some bare meatballs in the fridge.

556
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,370
Speaker 1: And those are still, I think, an ingredient, right?

557
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:50,549
Speaker 1: And there's still an ingredient because when you finally go to eat them, hopefully they don't go bad, you might, for example, put them on a bread and make a meatball sub, which wouldn't be a leftover, 'cause the first time you use the original meatballs or some other dish.

558
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:59,203
Speaker 0: - And then, well, basically in terms of my life though, to get back to what I started with, why I think this is an interesting topic.

559
00:44:59,264 --> 00:45:20,809
Speaker 0: right now, as we moved to the city and I didn't have to commute and there's more local grocery stores and I can walk to places and food delivery and everything, I got to the point to where we didn't, leftovers, I liked them, but they weren't that important because we tended to start buying a lot of food to cook fresh and cooking a meal that is enough for both of us.

560
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:28,570
Speaker 0: We didn't generate as many leftovers and there wasn't as much time pressure in my life where I needed to make sure there were leftovers.

561
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:30,666
Speaker 1: - Well, I think that comes to-.

562
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,130
Speaker 0: - And now leftovers are an important part of my life again, 'cause I got to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner in this apartment seven days a week.

563
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,490
Speaker 1: - Yeah, there's a few things going on there, right?

564
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:44,990
Speaker 1: It's like, depending on the number of people you have, if you only got one person, oh, I got hiccups.

565
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:51,910
Speaker 1: If you only got one person, portion sizes in the US are gonna be too much for a meal, right?

566
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:59,229
Speaker 0: So it's really hard to go on- remember that RIT where I'd cook, I'd heat up a can of green beans and eat a ham steak.

567
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:08,650
Speaker 1: - But it's like, even if you go on the internet and you search meals for one, it is really hard to cook a meal for one person, one serving, right?

568
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,330
Speaker 0: - Breakfast is doable, not lunch and dinner as much.

569
00:46:12,371 --> 00:46:23,730
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's like, you could make one sandwich, but it's like you bought ingredients for that sandwich and those ingredients don't, you can't really buy a number of slices of cheese for one sandwich.

570
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,669
Speaker 0: - If you're making sandwiches for one and you buy some ham, you're having ham sandwiches for a week.

571
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,280
Speaker 1: - You go to the deli, you're like, "I want an eighth of a

572
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:31,725
Speaker 1: pound.".

573
00:46:32,493 --> 00:46:34,450
Speaker 1: It's like, you get a quarter or a half.

574
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:43,909
Speaker 0: - When we were at RIT one time in Wegmans, I did actually get an eighth of a pound of sliced ham and an eighth of a pound of cheese because I could not afford to buy more food.

575
00:46:46,177 --> 00:46:47,029
Speaker 0: Those were rough times.

576
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,249
Speaker 1: - Anyway, but yeah, once you get two people, it's like, there's a lot of meals you can cook.

577
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,309
Speaker 1: that are two servings, right?

578
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,609
Speaker 1: If I get a Blue Apron, we're doing the meal boxes, see our previous episode, right?

579
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:00,330
Speaker 1: All those meals are mostly two serving meals.

580
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:05,830
Speaker 1: If there's two people who are home and eating, cooking and then eating, there's no leftover, right?

581
00:47:05,931 --> 00:47:06,888
Speaker 1: It's a two serving meal.

582
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:15,290
Speaker 0: - But it's also very easy to, for two people, double that recipe to four and then have a meal plus that meal again on another day.

583
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:20,390
Speaker 0: But with one person, doubling a meal to two is not nearly as straightforward and easy.

584
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:27,849
Speaker 1: - Yeah, when I was one person, I would cook a Blue Apron and I'd eat half and I'd put half in the fridge, right?

585
00:47:28,892 --> 00:47:31,190
Speaker 1: If you got two people there, that doesn't happen, right?

586
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,850
Speaker 1: You just eat them both, leftover doesn't exist.

587
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:47,330
Speaker 0: - But above that scale, I find the only leftovers that tend to be useful, like when a bunch of people are around, are the one pot or big mush type meals, like a big stew, a big casserole, a big pizza, that kind of thing.

588
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,070
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah, pizza slice leftover.

589
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,224
Speaker 0: - Yeah, that's what I had for lunch today because we ordered pizza last night.

590
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:54,888
Speaker 1: - Ooh, exciting.

591
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:06,250
Speaker 0: - The other kind of leftover, the restaurant one, I don't want to give that short service, we talked about this on "Geek Nights" years ago, but we first went to Australia for our, like that first PAX Australia.

592
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:08,890
Speaker 1: - Australia coming up two times today.

593
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:09,208
Speaker 0: - Right?

594
00:48:09,751 --> 00:48:11,050
Speaker 0: We went to this Mexican restaurant.

595
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,423
Speaker 0: Now, we both know better now, never go to a Mexican restaurant in Australia, holy shit.

596
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:21,630
Speaker 1: - We went there because that was the only place that was open at that time of night, pretty much.

597
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:31,370
Speaker 0: - We went to this Mexican restaurant late at night on like Phillip Island, and we ordered what we thought was a reasonable amount of food, and it was like, it was an inordinate amount of food.

598
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,349
Speaker 0: - Yup, way too much food.

599
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:35,869
Speaker 0: - They brought us like a comical amount of food.

600
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:44,027
Speaker 0: And then we were like, whatever, like we just had, the whole time we were like, well, we'll just wrap this up, take it back to the hotel and like heat up in the microwave and like, cool.

601
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:53,210
Speaker 0: And then at the end of the day, like at the end of the meal, we asked for the check and we're ready to leave, and we asked if we could have a doggy bag, and the waitress is like, no, it's illegal.

602
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,488
Speaker 1: - And I didn't think she said it was illegal, she just said no.

603
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,609
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well, she said no, and she's like, she said we're not allowed to, 'cause that restaurant had a policy.

604
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:08,710
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I don't remember anything about being illegal, but she definitely said no, and definitely did not let us take the food.

605
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:14,266
Speaker 0: - Yup, and we were like, okay, you're just gonna throw all this away, and she's like, yup, and I was like, okay.

606
00:49:15,351 --> 00:49:23,129
Speaker 0: But I encountered this, 'cause I've been to Australia many more times, I've encountered this, I've had restaurants tell me it was illegal straight up, like all sorts of nonsense.

607
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:31,329
Speaker 0: The deal is, a lot of countries other than the US have way better food safety rules, though a lot of countries have worse rules.

608
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:44,430
Speaker 0: Australia actually is a lot more on target about the dangers of takeaway food from restaurants, because a terrifying number of Americans get food poisoning from leftovers, like it's a big problem.

609
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:45,081
Speaker 1: - Really?

610
00:49:45,102 --> 00:49:45,230
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

611
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,710
Speaker 1: - I did not know, this is news to me, how do you get food poisoning from a leftover?

612
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,529
Speaker 0: - By not chilling it fast enough.

613
00:49:51,931 --> 00:49:54,848
Speaker 0: Most people, it sits out on the table for a long time, but they're not home.

614
00:49:55,471 --> 00:50:22,950
Speaker 0: The difference between being at home and being at a restaurant is that most people, when they eat at a restaurant, have to travel a decent distance to get back home, probably dessert and other things, so the food that they are going to take home with them in the doggy bag has been sitting in the danger zone for a significant amount of time, and when they get it home, they're not weird like me, they don't crash cool it before they put it in the fridge, they might let it sit out for a little while, or they put it in the fridge and it takes a long time for it to get to a safe temperature.

615
00:50:23,452 --> 00:50:26,770
Speaker 0: It's real easy to fuck yourself up with leftovers from restaurants.

616
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,188
Speaker 1: - Okay.

617
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:40,490
Speaker 0: - So in Australia, it's like culturally expected that you wouldn't take food home from restaurants, and many restaurants will tell you they won't let you, 'cause they don't trust you to not get food poisoning and then try to come after them for it somehow.

618
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:47,429
Speaker 0: In America, if you try to go after a restaurant, because the leftovers you took home made you sick, you are not gonna win that case.

619
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:54,190
Speaker 1: - No, but you'd have to get sick from the food while you're in the restaurant, and you'd have to prove it was the food's fault and nothing else.

620
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,230
Speaker 0: - And even then, you probably are not gonna be able to get any recompense from that restaurant.

621
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,582
Speaker 1: - Yeah, if you wanna get recompense, you have to get burned by coffee.

622
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:02,026
Speaker 1: that's 1,000 degrees.

623
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,910
Speaker 0: - Yup, which again, that case was justified.

624
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:06,670
Speaker 0: That specific case.

625
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:12,630
Speaker 1: - Exactly, I'm saying, it would have to be something so egregious and obvious, like coffee that's way too hot.

626
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:20,469
Speaker 0: - Yup, because even in the year of our lower 2021, I hear people misrepresent what happened with that McDonald's case.

627
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,101
Speaker 1: - It's easy to do.

628
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:37,330
Speaker 0: - Yup, but honestly, living in the city, just for personal anecdote, living in New York City, leftovers from restaurants are one of my favorite things, 'cause I can get home real quick and I know food safety.

629
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:43,010
Speaker 0: I am confident that I can safely transport those leftovers home and reheat them later.

630
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:57,762
Speaker 1: - I mean, I just put them in the fridge immediately as soon as I get home, and I never really thought about the food safety aspect of it, but I guess it hasn't been a problem because most of the time, even pre-pandemic, the leftovers from restaurants would have been delivered to my house anyway, so I'd

631
00:51:57,843 --> 00:51:58,125
Speaker 0: eat them,

632
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,410
Speaker 1: and then they wouldn't even have time to be in the danger zone traveling home.

633
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,188
Speaker 1: They're already home.

634
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,915
Speaker 0: - Yup, 'cause that's another thing that's changed in my life.

635
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:05,609
Speaker 1: - Just go right in the fridge.

636
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:24,389
Speaker 0: - I don't know about you, but definitely, as I've lived in New York City, which is no more time pressure in my life, but also, at least not from commuting, but also, as I ate at better restaurants and had a little more money, fancier and better places tend to have smaller portions when you eat out, so leftovers are less of a thing,

637
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:25,974
Speaker 1: and

638
00:52:25,994 --> 00:52:31,709
Speaker 0: the kinds of places I get leftovers from are the kinds of leftovers that are very easy to safely reheat.

639
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,728
Speaker 0: We're talking about things like dumplings or a pile of Indian food.

640
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:50,189
Speaker 1: - Yup, well, it's like, they're also, because of the cost of delivery and eating out, I kind of actually want the extra food, so if I order Indian food, I will order samosa, and they give you two samosas.

641
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:55,150
Speaker 1: I'll order some sort of meal that will be dumped onto rice for eating.

642
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,228
Speaker 0: - Which is already usually at least two people's worth of food.

643
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:01,650
Speaker 1: - Right, and then maybe some naan and maybe a mango lassi.

644
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,250
Speaker 1: It's the first time I eat, when I eat the food immediately, I eat one of the samosa, right?

645
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:10,307
Speaker 1: I'll eat some of the stuff on rice, whatever the food I got was, right?

646
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:17,046
Speaker 1: Some sort of curry or who knows what, and then I'll tear the naan in half and eat half of it 'cause it's enormous, right?

647
00:53:17,752 --> 00:53:18,849
Speaker 1: And then I'll drink the whole mango lassi.

648
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:22,835
Speaker 1: And then the second time, it's like, well, I don't

649
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:23,180
Speaker 0: have mango

650
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,661
Speaker 1: lassi anymore, but I have a half a

651
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:27,444
Speaker 0: naan,

652
00:53:27,464 --> 00:53:39,550
Speaker 1: and if I ate all the rice, I could just make more rice in my rice cooker or heat up the old rice, and then I still have the food in a plastic container that I can dump on the rice, and I got another samosa that I can heat up in the toaster oven or the microwave.

653
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,170
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's perfect.

654
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,930
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, it costs a lot of money, but I actually divide it by two, very reasonable.

655
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:48,370
Speaker 0: - Yeah, like same with the pizza.

656
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:55,490
Speaker 0: Like I'll order a whole pizza, though lately in COVID times, 'cause we don't, like can't eat out that often, there's a very limited type of food I can get delivered easily.

657
00:53:56,474 --> 00:54:09,090
Speaker 0: So whenever there's a food like pizza that scratches an itch that I can't easily scratch by going out like I would in pre-COVID times, sometimes we just get into goblin mode and eat the whole pizza, even if we were planning on having leftovers.

658
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,810
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the number of slices I've been eating has been varying.

659
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:17,790
Speaker 1: Like sometimes I'll be eating two, and sometimes I'll be eating four, and the pie we usually get has eight.

660
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:18,787
Speaker 1: - Yep, four.

661
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,109
Speaker 1: - It's a big difference whether I go two or four.

662
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:30,269
Speaker 0: - I find that as I'm getting older, I'm hitting that point of four slices of pizza, if it's too late, is a recipe for heartburn and indigestion.

663
00:54:30,956 --> 00:54:33,390
Speaker 0: 'Cause I am hearing 40.

664
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:34,170
Speaker 1: - Sometimes it happens though.

665
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:37,749
Speaker 0: - Have a little red wine with it, and then yeah, where it's thumbs time.

666
00:54:42,694 --> 00:54:49,230
Speaker 1: But leftovers- - Yeah, I think leftover wise, there are some foods that are like good as leftovers.

667
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,970
Speaker 0: - Oh, we could do like a tearing of leftovers.

668
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,790
Speaker 1: - Yeah, like there's some foods that like they don't reheat well.

669
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:01,730
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, okay, you got some leftover, whatever it is, but it's like, what are you gonna do with it, right?

670
00:55:02,072 --> 00:55:02,806
Speaker 1: It's like, eh.

671
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:04,190
Speaker 0: - Well, that's like the bottom right.

672
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:12,750
Speaker 1: - Sometimes you have some leftover, yeah, you have some food that's leftover, but it's like, how are you gonna reheat that?

673
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:15,205
Speaker 1: It's kinda, you know, what are you gonna...

674
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,850
Speaker 0: - Well, that's the transformative nature.

675
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:22,570
Speaker 0: Like there are foods that you cannot really reheat to be the same thing again, like fried chicken.

676
00:55:23,172 --> 00:55:33,370
Speaker 0: You cannot reheat fried chicken to the same level of like expected quality, but you can use fried chicken to do something in a dish that is not just fried chicken.

677
00:55:34,132 --> 00:55:43,910
Speaker 0: Like I'll scrape the chicken off with a fork and like mix it up into something and cook it like in an omelet or make a sandwich out of it, but I won't try to reheat the fried chicken to then bite into a drumstick.

678
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:55,150
Speaker 1: - Oh, I mean, I will do that, but I just won't expect it to taste and be as crispy as it was originally, but I will use the toaster oven and it will be much crispier than it would have been using microwave.

679
00:55:55,432 --> 00:56:05,870
Speaker 0: - No, but like the S tier, the foods that are the easiest to reheat where the quality is similar to, or if in some cases identical to the original.

680
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:10,310
Speaker 0: Pizza, as long as you do it right, pizza reheats so well, just do not...

681
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:12,149
Speaker 1: - You gotta make a real, real hot oven.

682
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:16,830
Speaker 0: - Make your oven like however hot, unless you know the temperature, my advice is simple.

683
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:25,410
Speaker 0: However hot you think you need your oven to be for pizza to reheat it, just make it hotter than that and put it in for a shorter time than you think is necessary.

684
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:31,109
Speaker 1: - Just watch it and when you see the cheese move, - As soon as the cheese is bubbling a little bit, take it out, it's good to go.

685
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:34,590
Speaker 0: Like 400 degrees, that's pretty good, but you could go hotter.

686
00:56:35,611 --> 00:56:37,090
Speaker 1: - Yeah, 500, nothing wrong with that.

687
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:40,129
Speaker 0: - High temperature, short time, that is the way to do pizza.

688
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:48,190
Speaker 0: The only alternative like way to reheat a pizza, but it's a pain in the ass, is to put it on like a cast iron griddle.

689
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:49,427
Speaker 0: That actually works pretty well too.

690
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:51,769
Speaker 1: - That works too, 'cause it's basically a pizza.

691
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:56,069
Speaker 0: - Microwave turns a leftover pizza into just disgusting poison.

692
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:57,889
Speaker 1: - Yep, pretty much.

693
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,789
Speaker 0: - Like the cheese turns like kind of translucent, it gets like slimy and chewy.

694
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,650
Speaker 0: And so many people make the mistake of doing the load.

695
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:11,630
Speaker 0: A lot of people generally with leftovers will try to do low temperature long time, 'cause it feels like--.

696
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,248
Speaker 1: - No, that's the danger zone that we talked about.

697
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:22,489
Speaker 0: - Yep, not only is it the danger zone, but the bacteria, but too, that feels safe, 'cause like in a sous vide, oh, I can't overcook it.

698
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:26,689
Speaker 0: You can definitely overcook things at a low temperature for a long time.

699
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:27,870
Speaker 0: But it's like a pizza in the oven.

700
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:28,749
Speaker 1: - You can also dry the fuck out.

701
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:32,630
Speaker 0: - At like 300 for an hour, and see what comes out of your oven.

702
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:33,747
Speaker 0: You're not gonna wanna eat that thing.

703
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:36,570
Speaker 1: - It'll be way too dry, way too dry.

704
00:57:37,470 --> 00:57:51,969
Speaker 0: - But like Indian food in particular, but also a lot of like Chinese dishes, like kind of take out delivery Chinese in America at least, the best way to reheat it in my opinion is to put it in a sauce pan with some oil, and again, high temperature, short amount of time.

705
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:53,988
Speaker 1: - It depends, you know.

706
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:59,150
Speaker 0: - Unless it's a saucy thing, like a soupy saucy thing, then just reheat it like you would a sauce.

707
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:03,750
Speaker 1: I never wanna put that stuff in the microwave usually.

708
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:09,730
Speaker 1: - That is the, you know, you hate a microwave for any use, but actually that is the use of a microwave, is that particular thing.

709
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:27,310
Speaker 0: - It depends on what's in the dish, 'cause if the dish has a significant amount of inconsistent thicknesses or ingredients, like an Indian dish that is a sauce with large chunks of chicken in it, the chicken will get dried out even as the sauce gets overcooked in a microwave.

710
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:31,910
Speaker 0: But if it's just like a sog with nothing else in it, the microwave could actually do it pretty well.

711
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,430
Speaker 0: 'cause you don't have these like inconsistent areas.

712
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,829
Speaker 1: - You just gotta do like 30 second mix, 30 second mix if you're really worried about that.

713
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:43,841
Speaker 0: - But that will not solve the problem of if the chunks of chicken meat are too large, they will dry out.

714
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:44,469
Speaker 1: - Bust it up.

715
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,630
Speaker 0: - They also will not get hot enough in the center in a microwave.

716
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:49,229
Speaker 1: - Bust it up in advance.

717
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:54,110
Speaker 0: - Or, but if you don't wanna bust it up, you could just put the whole thing in a sauce pan and let it steam for a while, it'll taste way better.

718
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:57,050
Speaker 1: - Microwaves a lot less work and you don't have to clean a sauce pan.

719
00:58:57,790 --> 00:58:58,770
Speaker 0: - Sauce pan goes in the dishwasher.

720
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,810
Speaker 1: - I usually don't put the pans in the dishwasher.

721
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:03,429
Speaker 0: - Why, they just work?

722
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,090
Speaker 1: - 'Cause there's not enough room in there for all dishes.

723
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,157
Speaker 0: - I got, what, how?

724
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:08,769
Speaker 1: - Gotta run it two times with them.

725
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,649
Speaker 0: - You don't have to run it two times, what the hell?

726
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:11,598
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

727
00:59:11,618 --> 00:59:14,849
Speaker 1: - You don't have to run it one, 'cause not all the things would fit in one shot.

728
00:59:15,591 --> 00:59:16,802
Speaker 1: I'd have to run it once and then--.

729
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:19,250
Speaker 0: - It's one sauce pan.

730
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:23,549
Speaker 1: Just one, just one in the sauce pan.

731
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:28,530
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but that means the dishwasher would fill much more frequently if I was putting large things in it.

732
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,770
Speaker 0: - One sauce pan takes the space of like four cups.

733
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,589
Speaker 1: - It's got that big, long handle on it.

734
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,250
Speaker 1: It takes a long handle.

735
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:36,650
Speaker 0: - I can just put stuff over the handle.

736
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,409
Speaker 0: The handle doesn't actually impede the water at all.

737
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:43,350
Speaker 1: - No, it doesn't impede the water, but it impedes, I can't like put a plate where the handle is.

738
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,589
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but I can put other cups over where that handle is.

739
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:52,990
Speaker 1: - I guess my dishwasher, just the sticks on the racks in the dishwasher are not great for putting large things.

740
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:53,629
Speaker 1: - I might be lucky.

741
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:58,729
Speaker 0: Our dishwasher, like the sticks are really, when we first moved into this apartment, it was a weird layout.

742
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:05,830
Speaker 1: - I mean, you can adjust some of the sticks in our dishwasher, which is handy, but you can't adjust them in a small area.

743
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,170
Speaker 1: It's like you adjust it and you've adjusted half the rack.

744
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:15,490
Speaker 0: - I guess it's a total aside, but I remember when we moved into this apartment, I remember thinking the layout in our dishwasher is weird.

745
01:00:15,551 --> 01:00:21,910
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't like any other dishwasher I'd ever seen or used, like it's just kind of weird, but it seems like it's just better.

746
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,470
Speaker 0: Like it's way easier to cram it full of stuff and everything cleans just fine.

747
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,770
Speaker 1: - I mean, I can cram it full of stuff.

748
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:29,630
Speaker 1: I usually just don't put big old pans in there, you know?

749
01:00:30,411 --> 01:00:32,302
Speaker 1: I just put every plate we own instead.

750
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,790
Speaker 0: - But some things require specific technique to reheat well.

751
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:45,310
Speaker 0: Like if you have just like a biryani and you try to put that in a microwave, it's gonna get dried out and weird.

752
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,330
Speaker 1: - Hmm, you can add a little water.

753
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:57,650
Speaker 0: - Yeah, if you add a little water and put it in a microwave, it will reheat in a very inconsistent way and you'll literally run into like peas that are still cool while there are pieces of rice that are effectively burned.

754
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:01,109
Speaker 1: - And so you got to do 30 seconds in the stir and do 30 seconds to stir it.

755
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:08,610
Speaker 1: - Yeah, what I've found, what I do now-- - Or do like three minutes in the microwave, then the whole thing is so hot, nothing's uneven.

756
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:17,390
Speaker 0: - Nah, I just look online to find professional chefs and their advice for how to reheat different kinds of things and I make a very simple evaluation.

757
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,549
Speaker 0: Is the method they describe too much of a pain in the ass?

758
01:01:21,371 --> 01:01:26,510
Speaker 0: And does the result significantly, is it significantly different from the shitty way I might've done it otherwise?

759
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:28,909
Speaker 0: And that's how I decide how to reheat different things.

760
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:36,850
Speaker 1: - The one thing is that in a fancy restaurant, right, they have those little like, it's sort of like the little broiler that like hangs from the top, right?

761
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,749
Speaker 1: And it's just like, you can just slot something in.

762
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:39,949
Speaker 1: Like I forget what that's called.

763
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:46,410
Speaker 1: It's like a little, it's basically like a little broiler, but it's just got a little slit opening, basically, like a little hatch that opens in the front.

764
01:01:47,451 --> 01:01:50,230
Speaker 1: It's above, it's not below, like with your oven, right?

765
01:01:50,711 --> 01:01:57,910
Speaker 1: And that is a super good way to reheat stuff or keep stuff hot, especially like, you know, like a piece of meat or something.

766
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,009
Speaker 1: It's like, those things are way good, but you don't have one of those.

767
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:04,529
Speaker 0: - Yep, convection ovens are really good for reheating stuff too.

768
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:07,530
Speaker 0: Way better than an oven for many purposes, except pizza.

769
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,750
Speaker 1: - But they could also dry things out, so you can, yeah.

770
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:14,810
Speaker 0: - But you can get away with shorter time in a convection oven for reasons, depending on the dish.

771
01:02:14,950 --> 01:02:19,010
Speaker 0: Like a samosa in a convection oven will reheat pretty well, actually.

772
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:22,849
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that's a good use for it, 'cause it's a fried thing to begin with, right?

773
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:29,529
Speaker 1: it's like a lot of people call the convection oven an air fryer, which I think is, you know, I think that should be illegal to do that.

774
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:30,349
Speaker 0: - I remember being so mad about that.

775
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:36,650
Speaker 0: I just always assumed that air fryers would like mist something with hot oil in some way, just use less oil.

776
01:02:36,992 --> 01:02:38,247
Speaker 0: Then when I learned that it's nothing.

777
01:02:39,312 --> 01:02:40,050
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's nothing.

778
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:49,342
Speaker 1: But if you have an already fried thing, like a samosa, right, or French fries, and you put them into an air fryer, convection oven.

779
01:02:49,363 --> 01:02:49,690
Speaker 0: - They got you.

780
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:50,323
Speaker 1: - Right?

781
01:02:50,711 --> 01:02:51,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got me.

782
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,510
Speaker 1: If you put it into a convection oven, it's like, well, it's already been fried.

783
01:02:54,950 --> 01:03:00,610
Speaker 1: That's gonna actually be a decent way to reheat it and maintain its crispy nature.

784
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:00,965
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

785
01:03:02,053 --> 01:03:18,850
Speaker 0: So in terms of the food safety thing, one thing that I never did when I was younger, but I do now, because I learned a lot more about food safety, is that most leftovers, you actually got to reheat that shit all the way to about 160, or you might take in a significant bacterial load.

786
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,529
Speaker 0: - That is something I never, I used to just heat things until they were warm enough.

787
01:03:24,211 --> 01:03:25,890
Speaker 0: And sometimes I'd even eat things cold.

788
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:33,647
Speaker 0: But now I do, when I read leftovers, I make sure I use a meat thermometer and I actually make sure I got it to a safe temperature long enough to kill whatever might be in it.

789
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:48,329
Speaker 1: Something else is if you, depending on what you're cooking, you might be able to increase the food quality and safety, perhaps as well, by preparing, knowing it's gonna be a leftover.

790
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,149
Speaker 1: So let's say you wanna make a chicken parm.

791
01:03:54,071 --> 01:03:57,689
Speaker 1: So most of the work of the chicken parm is frying the chicken.

792
01:03:58,210 --> 01:03:59,350
Speaker 0: - Fry a few eggs for chicken.

793
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:07,069
Speaker 1: - So you pound out and fry, say like four chicken boobs, and you can only gonna eat one chicken boob.

794
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,669
Speaker 1: And you got three extra chicken boobs.

795
01:04:10,632 --> 01:04:12,328
Speaker 1: So you're only gonna eat one right now.

796
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:17,008
Speaker 1: So put some sauce and melt some cheese on that one right now that you're gonna eat.

797
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,309
Speaker 1: Don't sauce and cheese the other three.

798
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:20,762
Speaker 0: - Yep, same point.

799
01:04:20,782 --> 01:04:21,206
Speaker 1: - Put those in.

800
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,500
Speaker 0: - You wanna make a salad?

801
01:04:22,521 --> 01:04:23,170
Speaker 0: - Put those shit away.

802
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:24,330
Speaker 0: - And have salad leftovers.

803
01:04:24,450 --> 01:04:29,690
Speaker 0: Don't put the croutons in the whole salad 'cause they're gonna turn into just mush if you put that salad in the fridge.

804
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:34,489
Speaker 1: - Exactly, so you make the salad, but you don't put the crouton in there.

805
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:42,230
Speaker 1: That way, you only put the crouton in at the table and you're gonna have a better leftover salad experience.

806
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:42,847
Speaker 1: - Exactly.

807
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:46,690
Speaker 1: - You might not even wanna put dressing in the salad in advance, only put it at the table.

808
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:54,989
Speaker 0: - The other thing that I do now, I learned this when I worked in restaurants, but I started applying it to my own life a few, like several years ago.

809
01:04:55,515 --> 01:05:04,750
Speaker 0: And it's actually helped a lot because if you adequately crash cool something, like a proper leftover, you cooked it, and now you wanna just put the whole thing away.

810
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,990
Speaker 0: Consumer fridges can actually cool things down that quickly.

811
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:18,250
Speaker 0: And in fact, if you put something that's too warm in your fridge, it might make other things that are next to it in your fridge unsafe in a way you don't realize.

812
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:27,561
Speaker 1: - Depends, usually just one little- I mean, it's possible, but it's like, yeah, you put one little container of food in there that is a little bit warm.

813
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:28,250
Speaker 1: - Well, here's the example.

814
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:33,910
Speaker 0: If you have a whole pot of hot soup and you put it in the fridge and it's next to your milk, your milk's probably fucked.

815
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:36,550
Speaker 1: - Yes, that would be a bad situation.

816
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:40,728
Speaker 1: But I think most of the time you're putting in like a little reusable container with some stuff in it, that's fine.

817
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,670
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it's a little bit, 'cause if it's a larger amount of leftovers.

818
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:52,910
Speaker 1: - If you put in a giant, still hot cauldron of chicken soup into the fridge, yeah, you're gonna significantly cause some trouble.

819
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,650
Speaker 0: - But here's the sort of the rocket fuel equation.

820
01:05:56,512 --> 01:06:06,610
Speaker 0: If you let a larger thing, like say you ate half a casserole, you want for the other half in the fridge, if you let it sit out until it's cool enough to safely put in the fridge, it's been in the danger zone too long.

821
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:08,389
Speaker 0: There's too much bacteria growing in there.

822
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:12,529
Speaker 0: But if you put it right in the fridge, it's gonna fuck up your fridge for like four hours.

823
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:18,270
Speaker 0: The way to do it is there's two techniques that I learned from professional chefs.

824
01:06:18,570 --> 01:06:27,830
Speaker 0: One, you take whatever the dish, whatever it's in, like say it's a big pot of soup, dump it out into another pot that is at room temperature.

825
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,009
Speaker 1: - Nope, there's a lot of heat in the pot.

826
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:32,430
Speaker 1: - And you can just get rid of all that heat instantly.

827
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,750
Speaker 0: - And then you just put that second pot right in the fridge.

828
01:06:35,131 --> 01:06:49,009
Speaker 0: Or number two, take that second pot and stick it in a bowl of ice water and let it sit there outside of your fridge for like 10 minutes first to crash cool it, to get it through the danger zone as fast as possible before you put it in the fridge.

829
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:54,130
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I basically never put anything in the fridge in its like original container.

830
01:06:54,291 --> 01:06:57,650
Speaker 1: I always, I have these like reusable glass lock things.

831
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:58,268
Speaker 1: - Yep, yep.

832
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:02,989
Speaker 1: - It's basically just a glass food container with a plastic lid that snaps on.

833
01:07:05,353 --> 01:07:14,669
Speaker 1: They also have a little hole that you can open and close and that's really useful 'cause that way you can just open the hole and put it in the microwave or close the hole and put it in the fridge and whatnot.

834
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:19,810
Speaker 1: Or you can take it with you to eat if you actually go to a work or something.

835
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,110
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of thing.

836
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:34,225
Speaker 0: - Yep, and I guess in terms of like left, the thing that I think everyone does is there'll be a leftover that you like, it's might be safe to eat, but you're not 100% sure.

837
01:07:35,273 --> 01:07:39,408
Speaker 0: So you choose to just not eat it and eat something else instead, but you don't throw it away yet.

838
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:45,930
Speaker 0: And then a couple of days later, well, now it's definitely bad and then you feel a lot better about throwing it out.

839
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:47,190
Speaker 0: I feel like that's a pattern.

840
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:49,288
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we had a recent meal.

841
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:53,430
Speaker 1: It wasn't from, it was the sun basket box, right?

842
01:07:53,571 --> 01:07:58,889
Speaker 1: And the meal came with these two sweet potatoes and they were fucking huge sweet potatoes.

843
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:05,970
Speaker 1: And the way it had me cook the sweet potatoes was a good way, but I think their proportions were way off.

844
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:10,469
Speaker 1: I had to like, you know, it was like, you know, we're mixing honey in there to sweeten them up and stuff.

845
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:14,669
Speaker 1: And I added more honey 'cause they were so big, but it still kind of wasn't enough.

846
01:08:15,794 --> 01:08:18,488
Speaker 1: And we kind of got full and there was still a lot of potato left.

847
01:08:19,154 --> 01:08:27,709
Speaker 1: So I put the sweet potato, you know, back in the fridge, right, in a different container, but it's like, there was no opportunity to just eat some sweet potato.

848
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:30,948
Speaker 0: - Yup, like that's gotta be like a side dish to another whole meal.

849
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:41,749
Speaker 1: - Right, it's like, we would have had to, you know, we were unexpected to have them and there was no plan to make something to go with them, right, and we were eating other things that were planned to eat.

850
01:08:42,371 --> 01:08:45,902
Speaker 1: And so the sweet potato had to go, it outlived its welcome.

851
01:08:45,943 --> 01:08:46,850
Speaker 1: sadly, right?

852
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:59,669
Speaker 0: - My rule now is basically 48 hours, or if I look in the fridge and I wanna eat a leftover, but I balk at all, like, I feel it's like, oh, I wonder if it's actually still safe.

853
01:09:00,331 --> 01:09:09,969
Speaker 0: If my instinct is I don't wanna eat it right now and I choose to eat something else, I assume I should just throw it away 'cause it's gonna be like the banana that never gets turned into banana brew at that point.

854

Speaker 0: So keep an eye out from that.

870

871
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:42,657
Speaker 0: But for now, I will leave you with...

872
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:43,939
Speaker 1: - Oh my God.

873
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:44,930
Speaker 0: - What?

874
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,019
Speaker 1: - Did you just kill him?

875
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:51,379
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I guess I did.

876
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:55,119
Speaker 1: - I mean, that guy's single-handedly killed hundreds of our men.

877
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,559
Speaker 0: - I mean, he was just standing there.

878
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,320
Speaker 1: - I mean, did you punch him hard?

879
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:59,117
Speaker 0: - I guess.

880
01:11:00,002 --> 01:11:01,059
Speaker 0: Just a standard punch.

881
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:03,119
Speaker 1: - I mean, do we still stand guard?

882
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,499
Speaker 1: That guy was the guy.

883
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:05,559
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that was the guy.

884
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,360
Speaker 1: - That was the guy this was all about.

885
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,919
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like there's another guy.

886
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,420
Speaker 1: - I guess we should tell the boss.

887
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,900
Speaker 0: - Yeah, okay, sure.

888
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,517
Speaker 1: - Cool.

889
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:17,800
Speaker 1: - Hey, boss?

890
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:19,279
Speaker 0: - What do you want?

891
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,420
Speaker 0: You should be guarding.

892
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:21,960
Speaker 0: He could show up any minute.

893
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,440
Speaker 0: - That's kind of the thing.

894
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:24,914
Speaker 0: He already was here.

895
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:26,137
Speaker 1: - Well, bring him in.

896
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:26,958
Speaker 1: I want to see him.

897
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,140
Speaker 0: - Well, we already took care of him.

898
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:29,577
Speaker 0: - You what?

899
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:33,480
Speaker 1: - Well, he was just standing there and I punched him and he died.

900
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,780
Speaker 1: - This is same guy who chased us across seven continent.

901
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:37,198
Speaker 0: - Yep.

902
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,659
Speaker 1: - Same guy who took down 30 of our helicopter.

903
01:11:40,223 --> 01:11:47,120
Speaker 1: The guy we shot with RPG and he fall out the plane into ocean attacked by shark on boat and boat explode.

904
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:47,959
Speaker 0: - That's the one.

905
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,520
Speaker 1: - You punched him and he died.

906
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,078
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

907
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:54,840
Speaker 1: - Okay, I guess that's good.
