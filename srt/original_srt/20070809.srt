1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,228
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, August 9th.

2
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,312
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:18,960
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights tonight how to not suck at slack and all.

4
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:25,388
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:32,124
Speaker 0: So rim anything happen today.

6
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:33,730
Speaker 1: a bunch of boring stuff at work.

7
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:38,450
Speaker 1: I could go on in depth about everything that I do at work, but it's really not that interesting.

8
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:42,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got nothing either, so I just do the show.

9
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:47,040
Speaker 1: Guess we don't have any of those wacky stories from our day to talk about today.

10
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,226
Speaker 0: I guess not all right then.

11
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:50,870
Speaker 0: so news time.

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:56,695
Speaker 0: So that Barry Bonds he hit that 756 home run there.

13
00:00:56,936 --> 00:01:00,928
Speaker 0: He's hit more home runs and majorly baseball than any other single person.

14
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:02,850
Speaker 1: all right I can't say that I care at all.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,452
Speaker 1: I barely know who.

16
00:01:03,492 --> 00:01:04,034
Speaker 1: that is no.

17
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:19,945
Speaker 0: some guy named Matt Murphy a college student from Queens caught the ball all right and which is funny because he was in San Diego and went to the game on a whim and I didn't see a Television of course because I did not watch television, but apparently he was making a fool of himself being like.

18
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:21,590
Speaker 0: I'm Matt Murphy from Queens.

19
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,290
Speaker 1: I'm Matt Murphy from Queens.

20
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,416
Speaker 0: Anyway, the story here.

21
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:34,967
Speaker 0: Is that the ball has an estimated value of Half a million dollars, maybe a little more like that.

22
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:40,405
Speaker 0: if I were him I would pretty much at least if you sold it You know yesterday when he when he or two days ago when he caught it.

23
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:41,289
Speaker 0: I'm not exactly sure.

24
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,176
Speaker 1: well I would have done.

25
00:01:42,216 --> 00:01:43,810
Speaker 1: I would have put it on eBay immediately.

26
00:01:44,895 --> 00:02:02,206
Speaker 0: ahem technically according to the laws the United States That's a taxable income right there even if he doesn't sell the ball Even if he just gives the ball back to Barry Bonds even if no matter what he caught the ball Even if he just like handed it to the person next to him.

27
00:02:02,588 --> 00:02:05,555
Speaker 0: right Technically, it's taxable income.

28
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:15,635
Speaker 0: and that immediately puts him into the highest tax bracket and on the ball alone They estimate that he would have to pay $210,000 in tax even if he gave the ball away, huh?

29
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,570
Speaker 0: United States tax system so awesome.

30
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:28,084
Speaker 1: I'm really glad that I have not run into the more intricate issues of the day.

31
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:29,448
Speaker 0: not only that not only that.

32
00:02:29,488 --> 00:02:38,590
Speaker 0: but if he Holds on to the ball for even a day if the ball appreciates in value Technically, he'd have to pay a capital gains tax on the appreciation.

33
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,658
Speaker 1: See the thing is technically don't I have to pay?

34
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:45,772
Speaker 1: I would actually be paying capital gains taxes on all those Nazi coins and Things I have.

35
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:49,322
Speaker 0: I know it's that's the problem with the tax system is have all these?

36
00:02:49,543 --> 00:03:02,581
Speaker 1: yeah granted while there are problems with the u.s Tax system I want to say right now before anyone gets any ideas that all those people for fair tax or flat tax or any F-star tax they're morons and those ideas are stupid.

37
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:04,086
Speaker 0: those ideas are stupid.

38
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,290
Speaker 0: the tax system is bad.

39
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:11,150
Speaker 0: That doesn't mean your equally bad idea equally bad or possibly worse you bad.

40
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,910
Speaker 1: Put that fair tax anywhere near the realm of sanity.

41
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:20,282
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's probably one of the worst ideas a human being has ever had.

42
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:25,382
Speaker 1: the only thing I got is that hobo who shoved a fork In his eye not so bad compared to fair tax.

43
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:39,962
Speaker 0: So this guy though He doesn't have much to worry about because apparently when Mark McGuire, you know hit his home run for his different home run record You know if home runs in a single season Someone from the IRS was like, yeah, you got to pay tax on that.

44
00:03:40,203 --> 00:03:47,345
Speaker 0: and then someone else from the IRS was like No, we're just kidding after politicians, you know made it said.

45
00:03:47,365 --> 00:03:50,174
Speaker 0: Hey, that's pretty stupid right there You know that gives me heart.

46
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:56,396
Speaker 1: at least it proves that there are some politicians who are not some sort of skin spy But are actually human being yep.

47
00:03:56,838 --> 00:04:02,710
Speaker 0: So hopefully if the IRS tries to tax this guy I mean if he does sell the ball, right?

48
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:08,636
Speaker 0: I do believe Personally that he should be taxed on the money He gets for the sale.

49
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,665
Speaker 0: not you know, whatever people say the value is.

50
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:11,930
Speaker 0: so he sells it for a dollar.

51
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,722
Speaker 0: Sure, make him pay, you know, 35 cents in there.

52
00:04:16,123 --> 00:04:24,339
Speaker 1: Honestly what I would probably have done is Said I was keeping the ball sell it to someone under the table for cash Like some collector.

53
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:28,441
Speaker 1: you get another ball to replace it Even if it was far less and then just say I lost it.

54
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,907
Speaker 1: cuz I didn't care about baseball.

55
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:32,977
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, wait a minute wait a minute.

56
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:39,979
Speaker 1: if it depreciated in value or I lost it couldn't I claim some sort of Tax boon as a result.

57
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:40,522
Speaker 0: I don't know.

58
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:45,719
Speaker 0: if you lose something valuable You know what you could do, you know You know how you could get money by losing it.

59
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,057
Speaker 0: if you got insurance on it, and then you lost it Yeah, but then technically it's insurance.

60
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:53,090
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying, which is that there's no way to make money.

61
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:57,450
Speaker 0: There's no way to get money by basically setting money you have on fire.

62
00:04:57,652 --> 00:05:03,470
Speaker 1: There's no way to get more money than on Unless you're a business and you play shady games with the taxes.

63
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:14,269
Speaker 1: I had a friend who explained to me in great detail How the best way to make money off of a business is to every few years lose a whole bunch of money on paper Whether or not you actually lost a bunch of money.

64
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:27,893
Speaker 0: The only way I've seen to successfully make a lot of money and avoid you know with that That sort of scam and avoid insurance fraud would be to say have a contest get some prize insurance Right.

65
00:05:27,993 --> 00:05:29,905
Speaker 0: I'm not going to explain how prize insurance works.

66
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:30,750
Speaker 0: You should figure it out.

67
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,270
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty self-evident.

68
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:32,972
Speaker 0: Get.

69
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:40,278
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to have people in the company or your friends or your family enter the contest because you know They obviously figure that scam out right.

70
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,555
Speaker 0: but if someone else wins the contest and then they're so generous They just give you the money.

71
00:05:44,897 --> 00:05:47,870
Speaker 0: That's a way to get money from insurance without.

72
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:49,830
Speaker 1: Well, they'd still have to give you the money.

73
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,994
Speaker 0: So you have to do all sorts of surreptitious shady things or you just have someone who's really dumb and you're like Yeah, you have to give that money to me.

74
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,460
Speaker 1: Okay, you know a much simpler way is to have the person killed and steal the money.

75
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:09,110
Speaker 0: Yep, but I don't know what's a worse crime Murder or telling someone to murder or hiring a hitman versus insurance fraud?

76
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,038
Speaker 0: What has the worst penalty?

77
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:10,968
Speaker 1: but at the same time?

78
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,652
Speaker 1: The evidence shows time and time again that if someone only commits a single murder their odds of being caught are very low unless they're Stupid.

79
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:19,369
Speaker 0: Oh, what are the odds of getting caught if you commit a single insurance fraud?

80
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,033
Speaker 1: Probably much higher.

81
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:29,500
Speaker 1: the thing is I've noticed that I most of the people you see getting caught with insurance fraud are Not the brightest people and they're not engaged in the.

82
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:31,906
Speaker 1: let's say the Sherlock Holmes is not on the case.

83
00:06:31,926 --> 00:06:35,510
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't think Sherlock Holmes is on any case.

84
00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:37,298
Speaker 1: I think we can simplify this further.

85
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,090
Speaker 1: the best way to make money is to already have money.

86
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:54,830
Speaker 0: yes, and you know, even if Basically, I think what the law does even if you follow the law and pay the tax on the ball It pretty much encourages Anyone who catches the ball who's not already rich to sell it.

87
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,056
Speaker 0: So it pretty much Garrett.

88
00:06:56,096 --> 00:07:06,630
Speaker 0: the tax law in the United States if followed to the letter Basically guarantees that the bought anything valuable that is suddenly created will always end up in the hands of someone who is already rich.

89
00:07:07,473 --> 00:07:11,810
Speaker 1: You know, I did interestingly enough learn not too long ago about how China's tax system works.

90
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:14,824
Speaker 1: How does it work and particularly how Kong Hong Kong works?

91
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,915
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into the details It's kind of complicated.

92
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,830
Speaker 1: what I can say is that people look at the u.s.

93
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:27,473
Speaker 1: You know well we tax the rich more in order to even out and the top x percent of Americans paid like 90 percent of the taxes in China.

94
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:37,643
Speaker 1: in Hong Kong it's that times a million like I think 40 or 50 percent of the people don't pay any tax at all and Then the wealthy pay almost all the tax.

95
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,657
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why they have so many Chinese mafias to avoid.

96
00:07:41,698 --> 00:07:43,446
Speaker 0: paying those tax will not also be rigid.

97
00:07:43,586 --> 00:07:48,649
Speaker 1: as a result Unless you are one of those people who pays those taxes, you can't vote.

98
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,679
Speaker 1: So it's not one vote one person.

99
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:54,530
Speaker 1: It's basically pay taxes get a vote.

100
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,590
Speaker 1: So only basically like doctors lawyers and educators can vote and no one else can.

101
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:28,150
Speaker 1: The thing is there's this big argument in Hong Kong about universal suffrage and mostly it's poor people who want it saying that we should get a vote and A lot of other people are saying that that would ruin the system because if people who don't have to pay the taxes at all And don't have to in any way deal with the consequences of government that spends more money Have control over the government's purse strings that they'll spend more money if people that they don't have it just it wouldn't break.

102
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:39,010
Speaker 1: I Disagree with some of that but at the same time I imagine a world where only people with an IQ above say a hundred and thirty get a vote.

103
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:42,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't know how I feel about that.

104
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:55,650
Speaker 0: It's real tough because we used to have a system in the US where you pretty much had to take a literacy test to vote And it was ruled unconstitutional because it was basically being used right out to keep black people from voting.

105
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,158
Speaker 0: It wasn't a real literacy test.

106
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,205
Speaker 0: it was like black people can't vote.

107
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:01,790
Speaker 0: we're pretending it's a literacy test.

108
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,537
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's bullshit.

109
00:09:03,558 --> 00:09:04,803
Speaker 0: That is quite the bullshit.

110
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:06,370
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the Civil War in the US.

111
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:12,157
Speaker 1: I was with the South on pretty much every issue Except that whole slavery bullshit.

112
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:17,092
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if it hadn't been about slavery yeah war of northern aggression But you know what.

113
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:21,350
Speaker 0: why is it so hard to do a good thing without doing a bad thing?

114
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:26,338
Speaker 1: I mean look we get people who assert their rights Oh, but they're asserting their right to have slaves.

115
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,843
Speaker 1: Oh look States rights.

116
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:32,647
Speaker 1: any time someone asserts States rights It's almost always to do something regressive and stupid.

117
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,902
Speaker 1: Any I mean, but I think we should bring the literacy test back.

118
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:43,870
Speaker 0: if it's a real literacy test And there's no corruption then yes the problem is because there is guaranteed to be horrible corruption.

119
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:50,490
Speaker 1: No The thing is maybe what if the tests were just published ahead of time with all the answers?

120
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:52,519
Speaker 1: Then I mean there's straight-up.

121
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:04,617
Speaker 1: like I had a teacher in school who did this a bunch of times He'd give you like the week before the test Every single question that was gonna be on the test and the answers to every single one of them Clearly and openly and he'd say as much.

122
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,808
Speaker 1: and people still failed those tests and it and at that kid.

123
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:13,950
Speaker 1: in that case While you wouldn't get a lot of people the people who weren't allowed to vote because they didn't get those questions, right?

124
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,277
Speaker 1: I don't think they have any right to be voting.

125
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,550
Speaker 1: I do think I'd say offered in any language.

126
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:28,881
Speaker 0: I do think that an ideal system would have some sort of way to determine to fairly determine That some people's votes count and some people's votes do not.

127
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:38,569
Speaker 0: for example if someone votes for say Joe Schmo and they can't tell you what Joe Schmo's platform is I don't think that their vote for Joe Schmo should count.

128
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:45,352
Speaker 0: however There is no fair way to test them and thus in Reality.

129
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:48,988
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a practical and pragmatic way to implement such as this.

130
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,294
Speaker 1: but Scott I thought it was easy.

131
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:53,367
Speaker 1: All you have to do is only give the vote to white males who own land.

132
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:56,281
Speaker 1: Oh That system works really well, didn't it?

133
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:57,809
Speaker 0: Yeah, so well.

134
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:00,883
Speaker 0: Anyway, speaking of voting I wouldn't even be able to vote.

135
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:02,190
Speaker 0: I'm a white male who doesn't own land.

136
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:04,559
Speaker 1: My family owns a little bit of land.

137
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,530
Speaker 0: You don't own land.

138
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:11,087
Speaker 0: I have a claim to that land but then their vote your dad's vote represents you.

139
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:11,850
Speaker 0: you don't get to vote.

140
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:12,995
Speaker 1: My dad votes the same way.

141
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:13,356
Speaker 1: I do.

142
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:14,160
Speaker 0: That's fine.

143
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,682
Speaker 0: That's fine.

144
00:11:14,863 --> 00:11:15,566
Speaker 0: You did the same.

145
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,860
Speaker 1: you don't get to vote But someday I will when I inherit that land.

146
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,225
Speaker 1: I am the eldest.

147
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:22,769
Speaker 0: if you inherit land I might they might just you know.

148
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,557
Speaker 0: Let the land go and you inherit something.

149
00:11:24,597 --> 00:11:27,950
Speaker 1: else thing is the land will be valuable because it's I won't get into that anyway.

150
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:35,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, the courts ruled on a case that's been around since the year 2000 about so old.

151
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,249
Speaker 1: that's pretty old considering what it was about.

152
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:43,707
Speaker 1: Basically some people set up voteswap2000.com and the way the site worked was.

153
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:50,330
Speaker 1: you could say I Want to vote for Ralph Nader, but I don't want to throw away my vote and let Bush win the elect.

154
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,789
Speaker 0: Oh you tied it in somehow.

155
00:11:52,191 --> 00:12:04,390
Speaker 1: So to the previous news the site was set up where someone who was in a state or a district where their candidate was pretty Much guaranteed to win no matter what could swap votes with someone in a contested area.

156
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:19,198
Speaker 1: So let's say I'd swap my vote because I live in a place where if a non-democratic Person ever won in any time the presidential votes of New York State I can't imagine that happening.

157
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,426
Speaker 1: So my vote doesn't count in this state at all.

158
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,450
Speaker 1: My vote has no effect.

159
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait Elliot Spitzer got what 75 plus percent of the vote.

160
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,405
Speaker 0: He couldn't lose governor.

161
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:28,770
Speaker 0: He couldn't possibly lose.

162
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:35,892
Speaker 1: Yep, so say I mean I know that I don't know whoever the Democratic candidate is going to win New York No matter what in 2008.

163
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:43,210
Speaker 1: But let's say I want Ralph Nader's party or the libertarians or one of those third parties To get my vote not because they're gonna win.

164
00:12:43,270 --> 00:13:01,009
Speaker 1: I know they're not gonna win but in order to get that five percent or whatever of votes that they get federal funding I Can swap my vote with someone in Ohio a swing state so that person will agree to vote for my candidate in, Ohio And in return I will vote for their third party candidate in my state.

165
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:13,703
Speaker 1: Yep, and the site was sent a bunch of letters from the California Secretary of State informing them that their website is illegal and it's corruption and blah blah blah and the site was shut down.

166
00:13:13,783 --> 00:13:17,074
Speaker 1: and then a giant court case started and the court case Is finally over.

167
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,590
Speaker 1: it was ruled that there is nothing wrong whatsoever with vote swapping.

168
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,209
Speaker 1: Anyone who said otherwise is an idiot and that's the end of that.

169
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,269
Speaker 0: Well, I mean what could possibly be wrong with it?

170
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,970
Speaker 0: First of all, there's no way for them to like verify that you actually swapped your vote.

171
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:39,090
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure some people did and some people didn't but there's no way to guarantee It's basically just a bunch of people saying stuff on a website and it doesn't have any real meaning at all.

172
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:43,152
Speaker 1: Well here on the first I'm of the mind that Anyone

173
00:13:43,232 --> 00:13:43,413
Speaker 0: who

174
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:57,256
Speaker 1: votes currently because currently the system is any citizen can vote regardless of my feelings as to literacy and whatever I'm of the mind that if you are letting someone vote you Cannot ever tell them What factors they should consider.

175
00:13:57,638 --> 00:14:03,789
Speaker 1: if someone has the vote and decides to vote for Bill Clinton because they like a saxophone playing I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

176
00:14:04,256 --> 00:14:15,670
Speaker 1: I mean I might disagree but people should be able to vote on whatever factors they want and if someone decides that they want to give their vote to someone else or Just vote randomly flip a coin in the toll, but there's nothing wrong with that.

177
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:17,642
Speaker 0: No, you can vote however you want.

178
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:24,166
Speaker 0: if you can't vote however you want It's not really a free vote and you're forced to decide based on someone else's decision.

179
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:28,026
Speaker 0: You're not really voting You're just doing something someone else told you to.

180
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:32,610
Speaker 1: so frankly I'm fine with people straight up selling their votes five bucks a vote, whatever.

181
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:38,481
Speaker 1: Yeah and the beauty of the system in America is that You cannot get a receipt of who you voted for.

182
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:40,970
Speaker 1: you cannot bring proof out of the booth.

183
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:48,910
Speaker 1: That way while people can do all sorts of things and decide however They want you can't be forced to vote for someone no matter what.

184
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:54,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go into that little booth or you go and do whatever and there's a curtain behind you.

185
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:55,838
Speaker 0: No one knows who you vote for.

186
00:14:55,858 --> 00:14:59,835
Speaker 0: if you don't look and you just vote with your eyes closed You won't know who you voted for.

187
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:00,678
Speaker 0: you'll never know.

188
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:03,950
Speaker 0: It'll be a complete mystery and I should do that.

189
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,625
Speaker 0: There's no way to prove it to yourself for anyone else.

190
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:10,826
Speaker 1: I should walk you to the booth So close my eyes go flicker flicker flicker flicker and pull the lever you should.

191
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:11,288
Speaker 0: it'd be fun.

192
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:11,630
Speaker 0: do it.

193
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,554
Speaker 0: I'm like an off year.

194
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:14,965
Speaker 1: Anyway, I mean this coming one exactly.

195
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:27,422
Speaker 0: so Any sort of you know corruption in the votes usually involves election workers or Having dead people vote or something or bad machines or bad counting.

196
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:30,410
Speaker 1: that was actually like adding in beacon during the last round of elections.

197
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:38,829
Speaker 1: There's this old lady and she was you know showing people in to vote and she kept saying everyone who came up don't forget to vote on the open spaces in this initiative.

198
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,985
Speaker 1: don't forget to vote for the open spaces initiative.

199
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:47,130
Speaker 1: and Finally the like the real election person noticed and walks over just like what you're doing is in violation of federal law.

200
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,290
Speaker 1: I could have you arrested blah blah blah blah blah and scared the living shit out of this old woman.

201
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,195
Speaker 1: Yep, but the thing is the old woman also was kind of indignant Like I should be able to.

202
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:56,104
Speaker 1: it's an important issue and people should vote.

203
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,920
Speaker 1: and yeah Yeah, the sad thing is this thing is a lot.

204
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,469
Speaker 0: The thing is yeah, she was while she was.

205
00:16:03,852 --> 00:16:05,338
Speaker 0: It would be okay if it was like.

206
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:09,456
Speaker 0: hey remember there's a question to vote for at the top, you know Don't just vote for the people.

207
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:10,683
Speaker 0: There's a question also on there.

208
00:16:10,924 --> 00:16:11,809
Speaker 0: Don't forget to look at it.

209
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:18,250
Speaker 1: No I don't even agree with that because now because she is saying that and no other polar is she's skewing the votes by reminding.

210
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,850
Speaker 0: That's the thing is that pretty much that I think you know.

211
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:28,210
Speaker 0: If there's something on the ballot that is off or the people might not notice I don't think there's a problem with them drawing attention to it.

212
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:40,410
Speaker 1: However, there is a problem if they lean slightly in either direction or if the method methodology of the election is broken by The fact that any one election official is doing something different from the other ones.

213
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,088
Speaker 0: That is correct.

214
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:47,787
Speaker 1: Like if if there happens to like say I go into the booth and I just highlight Barack's name while I'm voting.

215
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:56,710
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, I will say I actually despite the fact that I hate the Democratic Party almost as much as I hate the Republican Party.

216
00:16:57,192 --> 00:17:03,242
Speaker 1: I registers the Democrat just so I can vote in the primary for Barack Obama Whatever Barack attack.

217
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:13,242
Speaker 0: Okay, so Basically, I don't give a shit about what you do outside the voting booth in terms of elections at least the United States because if it's corrupt it's corrupt and your vote doesn't matter.

218
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,050
Speaker 0: and if it's not corrupt then it doesn't Matter.

219
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,865
Speaker 0: what you do outside the booth is no one knows that you who you voted for.

220
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,050
Speaker 0: You could just be full of shit.

221
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:21,861
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

222
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:27,309
Speaker 1: So Blah, I am very glad that the courts ruled properly and there's a quote.

223
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:31,346
Speaker 1: They said they violated the appellant's First Amendment rights.

224
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:41,389
Speaker 1: Aha Things of the day.

225
00:17:41,912 --> 00:17:46,770
Speaker 0: So a while ago there's this video on the Internet's of some youth pastor who's you know.

226
00:17:46,951 --> 00:17:50,110
Speaker 0: I mean the guy seems like a nice enough guy, but he's a youth pastor.

227
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:54,154
Speaker 0: So, of course, I'm gonna be anti him because I don't know those Jesus people.

228
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,690
Speaker 1: you didn't seem really that he seemed really like one of those overly excited people exactly.

229
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:00,056
Speaker 1: I don't like those people at all.

230
00:18:00,136 --> 00:18:03,290
Speaker 1: I can't stand their presence because it's such an affected excitement.

231
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:04,957
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't seem like he's bad.

232
00:18:05,037 --> 00:18:07,990
Speaker 0: Like what those evil pastors were like out to get everyone's money.

233
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,866
Speaker 0: He seemed like he was genuinely believing he was just.

234
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:15,550
Speaker 0: you know The excited and sort of crazy kind of that guy is a youth pastor.

235
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,306
Speaker 1: That guy is the g4 TV of Christianity.

236
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:19,527
Speaker 0: pretty much so.

237
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:26,930
Speaker 0: This guy was like talking about lot and something like that and he was talking and waved his unsexing stick.

238
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:27,579
Speaker 0: Exactly.

239
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,682
Speaker 1: He's sexy De-sexing.

240
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:30,043
Speaker 1: All right.

241
00:18:30,063 --> 00:18:33,110
Speaker 1: It was de-sexing stick most unsexily exactly.

242
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:40,670
Speaker 0: So he was waving around his de-sexing stick and basically the guy was talking about lot like pitching tents or pinching tits.

243
00:18:41,112 --> 00:18:45,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, and basically he accidentally said pinching tits and it was a funny video on the internet.

244
00:18:46,132 --> 00:19:16,218
Speaker 0: so some other people saw this video and they said hey, I got an idea and they went pretending to be FCC agents and They went up to him and they went to his church and they put on a whole big thing and they totally fooled him Into thinking that he was gonna have to pay a $50,000 fine at least and that they were gonna have to you know take away the church's nonprofit thingy and the guy was like freaking out and sweating all over the place and He's really got a fire under his ass.

245
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,503
Speaker 0: and it's pretty funny now.

246
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,767
Speaker 1: that in and of itself is funny.

247
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:19,550
Speaker 1: I love a good prank.

248
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:24,610
Speaker 1: It's not quite as good in my mind as it's a good night for flying but it's still a good prank.

249
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:36,916
Speaker 0: No The best part about this particular prank video is they actually show you when they tell the guy that it's a prank And he has like he's reaction is like ah And that's a good that's a good part.

250
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:38,762
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's a good reaction to.

251
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,436
Speaker 1: nothing bothers me more than someone who gets angry After a prank has been pulled on them.

252
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:43,479
Speaker 0: He doesn't get angry.

253
00:19:43,499 --> 00:19:48,657
Speaker 0: He's sort of like he seems like he's containing Any anger that is there.

254
00:19:48,697 --> 00:19:54,679
Speaker 0: like he starts just like rushing the guy and then he just sort of like Jumps around or at the room all wisely.

255
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,050
Speaker 1: and oh, I thought the way you portrayed that I thought that he laughed.

256
00:19:58,152 --> 00:19:58,949
Speaker 1: I thought it was awesome.

257
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,699
Speaker 0: He sort of thought it was awesome sorta guy.

258
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,982
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.

259
00:20:04,142 --> 00:20:05,806
Speaker 1: so he ran around the room.

260
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:13,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was pretty Excited in and had a lot of kinetic energy when they told him see that that was the g4 creeping out.

261
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,838
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I'm saying.

262
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:16,630
Speaker 0: So it's it's it's kind of freaky.

263
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:28,410
Speaker 0: But yeah, you should still watch this because it's funny and is a good prank Especially considering the irony that you know A church person is the kind of person who would tend to agree with the FCC and such.

264
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:34,507
Speaker 0: So having them get burned by the FCC is sort of a way to show them the light that they're wrong.

265
00:20:34,527 --> 00:20:37,984
Speaker 0: Oh See now they show them the light about a religious thing.

266
00:20:38,104 --> 00:20:38,970
Speaker 1: That is that was good.

267
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:44,090
Speaker 1: But the thing that really bothers me is that it's kind of sad that we live in a country right now.

268
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,339
Speaker 1: That is a very viable and credible threat.

269
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,270
Speaker 1: it is indeed that the FCC does have the power to do that sort of thing.

270
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:57,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, they do Okay, well actually in this case, they didn't really I mean have anything against this guy.

271
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,848
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but I mean had he been on the radio or on TV.

272
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,622
Speaker 0: I mean if a radio like radio people did rebroadcast what he said The problem is he's not responsible for that.

273
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:08,507
Speaker 0: the radio people are.

274
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:17,830
Speaker 0: so yeah yeah, but you know, it was easy to trick him into thinking he could get in trouble for it and It's pretty believable, especially since they executed the prank very well.

275
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,510
Speaker 0: They had a very high production value with some good cameras and some good acting and all kinds of good stuff.

276
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:23,951
Speaker 1: I don't know.

277
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,854
Speaker 1: but for whatever reason.

278
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:29,347
Speaker 1: when you said executed I immediately expected you to say him that I don't know why.

279
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:35,195
Speaker 1: oh well Anyway, oh well Luckily, right.

280
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,042
Speaker 1: So this is a video.

281
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:43,459
Speaker 1: Well a movie from 1951 or 52 now 51.

282
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:46,414
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is a video Teaching you.

283
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:51,855
Speaker 1: well nominally teaches you about table manners and all that crap in, you know, classic 1950s way.

284
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:53,944
Speaker 0: but that is not and cover.

285
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,270
Speaker 1: that is not my thing of the day.

286
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:03,570
Speaker 1: The video is merely the vessel for my thing of the day much Much like before when my thing of the day was the om nom nom nom nom nom.

287
00:22:05,986 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 1: So In this video is perhaps the worst sweater that has ever been made in the world.

288
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:12,750
Speaker 1: I how bad is it?

289
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:21,718
Speaker 1: The fact that this video is not in color is probably the only reason that I'm still saying or the reason that you're not blind This is the worst sweater ever.

290
00:22:21,738 --> 00:22:25,710
Speaker 1: I can't stress to you enough how hideous this sweater is.

291
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:29,241
Speaker 1: It's these two mooses around a Christmas tree and it's.

292
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,606
Speaker 0: are you sure they aren't reindeer?

293
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:31,810
Speaker 1: I don't care.

294
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:33,257
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a fire.

295
00:22:33,479 --> 00:22:34,424
Speaker 1: Maybe they're demons.

296
00:22:34,525 --> 00:22:35,369
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.

297
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,708
Speaker 0: And the fact that that was the extent of knitting technology in the 50s.

298
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,613
Speaker 0: What do you want?

299
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:44,670
Speaker 1: the fact that there are two people wearing this identical sweater?

300
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,256
Speaker 1: One of whom is larger than the other.

301
00:22:46,597 --> 00:22:49,690
Speaker 1: thus there were at least two sizes of this sweater.

302
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:55,547
Speaker 1: At least two of them were made one to rule them and in the darkness bind them, right?

303
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:56,330
Speaker 0: Good God.

304
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:58,177
Speaker 1: Oh and the video is kind of funny.

305
00:22:58,217 --> 00:22:59,121
Speaker 1: It's about table manners.

306
00:22:59,201 --> 00:22:59,844
Speaker 1: It's really dumb.

307
00:23:00,426 --> 00:23:01,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty dumb.

308
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:02,650
Speaker 0: I mean table manners.

309
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:13,570
Speaker 0: It's it's kind of funny because the kid comes down from upstairs or wherever and he exhibits bad table manners And then they tell him that he should do better and they then they go to explain how to have better table manners.

310
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:23,723
Speaker 0: but his table manners and his attitude that he has in the beginning of the video where it's supposedly the bad part is like a God compared to like I don't know me.

311
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:28,940
Speaker 0: every day or most You know, it's kind of like watching Happy Days.

312
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,870
Speaker 1: or leave it to Beaver where there's the bad kids like Fonzie.

313
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:39,798
Speaker 1: Fonzie was the most good-natured nice lovable well-mannered person in the world Compared to the average kid today.

314
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:45,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know freaking like a hundred years or now People are gonna look at Mike Tyson and be like, oh what a nice guy.

315
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:52,363
Speaker 1: He's so nice Right, so we should just stop here and not do the rest of the show.

316
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,818
Speaker 0: Ah Good idea Lots of better things to be doing.

317
00:23:56,879 --> 00:24:00,674
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm not gonna try to make that a clever segue any more So than I already attempted.

318
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:04,007
Speaker 1: but tonight we're talking about something that someone requested a while ago.

319
00:24:04,187 --> 00:24:07,099
Speaker 1: yet again You see Scott and I are.

320
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,770
Speaker 1: I mean we slack off, but that doesn't really do it justice.

321
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:12,578
Speaker 1: I would say that we are professional slackers.

322
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:14,745
Speaker 0: I just adjusted my angle of reclining.

323
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:16,590
Speaker 1: I'm reclining back right now.

324
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:23,328
Speaker 1: I got a slightly different angle myself, but pretty much from middle school on Scott I have done very little real work in the world.

325
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:28,830
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I mean in elementary school, they always told me your grades matter so much.

326
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,737
Speaker 0: You won't get into honors classes in middle school.

327
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,532
Speaker 1: Oh, no, and of course my parents are like you don't get all A's You're stupid.

328
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:43,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then in middle school, they were like, well also in elementary school They told me I should take notes and study and I didn't even know what study meant.

329
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:50,524
Speaker 0: Like I knew that study meant somehow that you prepared for a test or an exam But I didn't know what you did to study.

330
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,570
Speaker 0: like I'm like, what do I do?

331
00:24:51,871 --> 00:24:57,010
Speaker 0: I don't know what the physical thing I'm supposed to do is and I always got excellent grades doing nothing.

332
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:59,177
Speaker 0: And I they said take notes.

333
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:05,276
Speaker 0: and at first, you know taking notes meant copy down onto a piece of paper Everything the teacher writes on the overhead.

334
00:25:05,356 --> 00:25:08,567
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I realized pretty much right away that that served no useful purpose.

335
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:13,850
Speaker 0: and then When it you know at first that was like an assignment like you had to do it and it was graded.

336
00:25:14,373 --> 00:25:18,293
Speaker 0: but then later they're just like remember to take notes and I didn't

337
00:25:18,755 --> 00:25:29,990
Speaker 1: the thing that really scattered in high school in all the like AP classes There were a lot of overachievers in the classes who would bring little tape recorders and record every day's lecture while they took notes.

338
00:25:30,692 --> 00:25:31,754
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't get it.

339
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:35,725
Speaker 0: All right, and basically as time went on I didn't do anything.

340
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:39,215
Speaker 0: My grades were just fine I didn't do anything.

341
00:25:39,275 --> 00:25:40,358
Speaker 0: My grades are just fine.

342
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:43,927
Speaker 0: And then eventually I realized grades don't matter that much.

343
00:25:44,007 --> 00:25:44,910
Speaker 0: It's all a lie.

344
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:48,750
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go to college no matter what I'll be fine.

345
00:25:49,031 --> 00:25:52,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, doesn't matter if this I get a C or a B in freakin calculus.

346
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:54,479
Speaker 1: I mean I tried.

347
00:25:54,499 --> 00:26:09,805
Speaker 1: I actually tried right up until about the first quarter of ninth grade in high school my first year of high school the first quarter and I had all A's and I've been doing all my homework and I realized suddenly that like Scott I'm going to college no matter what Nothing's gonna stop me.

348
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:12,857
Speaker 1: Wow, I don't care about any of this.

349
00:26:12,937 --> 00:26:14,402
Speaker 1: and I suddenly stopped doing homework.

350
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:26,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, I basically know When I say I stopped doing homework, I actually told my teachers I'm sorry, but I have a no homework policy and I seriously did not do homework ever I.

351
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:28,770
Speaker 0: my policy was I didn't do anything that wasn't graded.

352
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:33,430
Speaker 0: So if it was, you know do this project or write this essay, there's a grade on it.

353
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,835
Speaker 0: It's an assignment that counts.

354
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:35,317
Speaker 0: I did it.

355
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,907
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I did not do it no matter what.

356
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:38,730
Speaker 1: Well, it really depends.

357
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:43,150
Speaker 1: I mean it started out like that, but then we got even worse in college and a little bit in high school.

358
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:44,348
Speaker 1: It wasn't just that it was more.

359
00:26:44,992 --> 00:26:51,746
Speaker 1: Alright, so that assignment is worth what five percent of my grade, but I can still get an A and not even bother Yeah.

360
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:53,999
Speaker 1: And then it got worse.

361
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,695
Speaker 1: I'd be like, alright That's worth ten percent of my grade.

362
00:26:57,137 --> 00:27:08,637
Speaker 1: if I skip that and I do moderately well in the rest of the class I'm guaranteed a B. All right, if I also skip the first midterm Can I pull off a C?

363
00:27:09,118 --> 00:27:12,189
Speaker 1: Because if I skip the first midterm, I can skip the whole first half of the class.

364
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:16,422
Speaker 1: Amen and it just went downhill from there.

365
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:27,075
Speaker 0: I remember one time in 11th grade 11th grade and I was in my social studies class, which was actually like current events something No, what.

366
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:29,655
Speaker 0: I forget exactly what it was But it was a really cool teacher.

367
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:33,450
Speaker 1: in high school the word social studies class always meant just usually nothing.

368
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:35,722
Speaker 0: It was actually a really cool teacher in a cool class.

369
00:27:35,762 --> 00:27:37,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was one of the better.

370
00:27:37,511 --> 00:27:39,480
Speaker 0: He was actually a libertarian and stuff.

371
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:40,666
Speaker 0: It was cool.

372
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:50,561
Speaker 0: And basically During the class once the guy sitting behind me, you know football guy who was actually not a bad guy He was you know, the teacher goes over to him and says why aren't you taking notes?

373
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:57,649
Speaker 0: And he's like Scott's not taking notes And he's like Scott gets A's you take notes.

374
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:01,453
Speaker 0: That's beautiful.

375
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,398
Speaker 0: That was a fun time.

376
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,770
Speaker 1: See the best was all the classes that had curves.

377
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,019
Speaker 1: I mean, especially like all the AP calculus.

378
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,670
Speaker 1: whatever classes they were graded on a straight-up curve.

379
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:13,448
Speaker 1: whoever did the best in the class got a hundred percent and it just went downhill from there.

380
00:28:13,469 --> 00:28:17,139
Speaker 1: and Homework was worth like twenty five percent of our grade.

381
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:19,748
Speaker 1: So but there's only one class of us.

382
00:28:19,768 --> 00:28:22,319
Speaker 1: so we realized Hey, what if we collaborate then?

383
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,890
Speaker 1: None of us have to do the homework ever and it won't matter.

384
00:28:25,475 --> 00:28:27,189
Speaker 1: So we all stopped doing the homework.

385
00:28:28,113 --> 00:28:36,302
Speaker 1: An unnamed individual secretly did the homework and secretly turned it in all year, but I won't get into that Alright, so basically when it comes to slacking off, especially in school.

386
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:37,988
Speaker 0: You have to determine a few things.

387
00:28:38,028 --> 00:28:38,470
Speaker 0: Yes everyone.

388
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:40,810
Speaker 0: What is the minimum?

389
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:46,647
Speaker 0: Actual work you have to do to get by because you can't do absolutely nothing and get by.

390
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:47,670
Speaker 0: that's never gonna happen.

391
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:59,923
Speaker 1: And also you at least have to show up to like one test at the minimum get by Can vary because it's not just get by on the bare minimum Period it's get by in terms of what are your goals?

392
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:02,350
Speaker 1: What do you want or need to accomplish?

393
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:10,190
Speaker 0: How can you accomplish said goals with minimum efforts and you determine the exact minimum amount of work time?

394
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:23,121
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to spend doing things in order to achieve that What you need to achieve and once you figure that out you spend Exactly that amount of time working and not a second more.

395
00:29:23,422 --> 00:29:39,270
Speaker 1: now schooling particularly pre college schooling So high school middle school elementary school is a very special case because especially in America You're gonna graduate anyway, and the way college admissions work as long as you do well on various standardized tests You're gonna get into college.

396
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:48,301
Speaker 0: Anyway, unless you want to go to Harvard or somewhere like that or Yale really badly You don't need freaking a zillion a.

397
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:55,848
Speaker 1: well even then a high standardized test score But when I say hi, I mean really high will make up for almost any failing for many schools.

398
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:57,637
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, it's it's kind of true.

399
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:58,724
Speaker 1: I mean look at our IT.

400
00:29:58,965 --> 00:30:01,802
Speaker 1: because of my test scores They didn't even look at my high school transcript for all they know.

401
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:03,090
Speaker 1: I never graduated from high school.

402
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:12,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, and like you're freaking like College essays and stuff unless you're applying to be some sort of like literature major They're barely reading that.

403
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:13,583
Speaker 0: you think about its admissions.

404
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,250
Speaker 0: people looking at this stuff not teachers.

405
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:20,970
Speaker 0: They got a pile of things and they're processing them and they're just gonna process them as quick as they can.

406
00:30:21,351 --> 00:30:21,874
Speaker 0: It's like yes.

407
00:30:21,914 --> 00:30:22,296
Speaker 0: No, yes.

408
00:30:22,336 --> 00:30:22,698
Speaker 0: No, yes.

409
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:22,939
Speaker 0: Yes.

410
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,120
Speaker 0: No.

411
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,587
Speaker 0: No, they have like a formula that tells them hat what to say yes, and when to say no.

412
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:35,269
Speaker 0: and Interviews and stuff are mostly ways for them to advertise their school to you and not ways to pick you out from the other people Except they're really small schools.

413
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:39,270
Speaker 1: Actually, that's a very important thing to remember because I know a lot of our listeners are near the end of high school.

414
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:44,570
Speaker 1: The colleges you are looking at before you are a student are not your friends.

415
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,190
Speaker 1: They are trying to sell to you the idea of going to their school.

416
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:51,969
Speaker 1: they don't care directly about you until you are already a student.

417
00:30:51,989 --> 00:31:05,286
Speaker 1: and if a man if a man plays a trumpet for you and Tries to convince you through his trumpet playing that IT is the major that you want to go into You got to step back and think if that's really the way you want to decide on your major.

418
00:31:05,386 --> 00:31:06,370
Speaker 1: because I made that mistake.

419
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:14,198
Speaker 1: Fund but I put up in a. IT is great, but I put up in a. you'll make six figures But that doesn't take any work.

420
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:22,044
Speaker 1: and then the dot-com bust happened like six months later Fooled by the the Pied Piper so to speak.

421
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:43,897
Speaker 1: yes, but anyway Pre-college I mean your goal in high school is either to get a job or go to a trade school go to college whatever and Outside of that nothing you do in high school with rare exception is going to matter your grades in high school once you get accepted To college mean less than nothing Less than nothing

422
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:46,710
Speaker 0: unless you really have to go to Harvard or something really badly

423
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:47,050
Speaker 1: Yeah.

424
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,055
Speaker 1: So in that case

425
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:53,768
Speaker 0: or unless your parents were like stab you for real Not like threaten you and yell at you But like actually stab you

426
00:31:54,378 --> 00:32:10,710
Speaker 1: So well I guess one of the biggest things if you want to be a true slacker that you have to be able to do is figure out your true goals and figure out the true requirements of achieving those goals and Willing and able to cast aside all of the distractions that will not get you to your goal.

427
00:32:11,272 --> 00:32:12,418
Speaker 0: Yes, and you also.

428
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:17,402
Speaker 0: the next thing you have to do is Not worry ever about.

429
00:32:17,422 --> 00:32:22,079
Speaker 0: you have to basically Do enough work so that you won't worry.

430
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:30,323
Speaker 0: if you worry for even a second like oh, maybe I didn't do enough work Maybe I won't achieve my goal if there's any uncertainty you have failed completely.

431
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:32,629
Speaker 1: This is especially true when you were skipping class.

432
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:34,710
Speaker 1: I know a lot of you fry never skipped a class.

433
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,869
Speaker 1: A lot of people never skip a class and Lee or at least rarely skip a class.

434
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:38,592
Speaker 0: But

435
00:32:38,933 --> 00:33:00,256
Speaker 1: I've seen people who would finally get up the testicular fortitude to skip a class And then they spend the whole hour or two that there's you know, they're skipping this class Worrying about the fact that they skip the class and as a result, they don't really get the enjoyment They should have gotten if you were going to skip a class if you were going to forgo Important work.

436
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,485
Speaker 1: if you're going to do anything like that You'd better get everything you can get out of that skipped work.

437
00:33:05,565 --> 00:33:06,690
Speaker 1: or why did you even bother?

438
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:25,384
Speaker 0: If you decide that this homework is not necessary to achieve your goals and you don't do it and you spend all night Worrying about the fact that you didn't do it You should have just done it because you would have spent maybe a half hour doing it instead of you know eight hours worrying and then worrying the entire next day and then still worrying some more.

439
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:29,893
Speaker 0: you didn't get any fun during the time you Saved you just freaking worried I mean.

440
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:37,127
Speaker 1: when I skipped class in high school the first couple times I was a little anxious like they're gonna get me but I never really thought about the specific consequences.

441
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:37,910
Speaker 1: They could lay upon me.

442
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,517
Speaker 1: I just thought skipping class.

443
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:40,260
Speaker 1: You can't do that.

444
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,285
Speaker 1: How are you gonna get away with it?

445
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:50,546
Speaker 1: They'll know it's high school And then one day I just didn't go to English class and then I just another day I went out to Arby's and hung around in the mall for a couple hours.

446
00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:57,470
Speaker 1: one day I just didn't even go to school and I realized that there were no ramifications at all and no one cared.

447
00:33:58,132 --> 00:33:59,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at that.

448
00:33:59,275 --> 00:34:11,649
Speaker 1: granted granted I because of the the attitude that many of the teachers had toward me it turned out later that most of them just assumed that I was in the band or I was doing something important or that I Was excused and they never bothered to check up on it.

449
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:20,425
Speaker 1: So if you're gonna be a professional slacker Not just an amateur slacker you have to go do more than just do the minimum to accomplish your goals.

450
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:27,152
Speaker 1: You also have to Accomplish in the eyes of others a lot more than you were actually Accomplishing.

451
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:36,038
Speaker 0: and this this is why there's some very important rule of slacking and that is the greater your abilities The less you have to do.

452
00:34:36,138 --> 00:34:39,030
Speaker 0: because if you're real let's say I'm really good at my job.

453
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,318
Speaker 0: Right, I can.

454
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:55,554
Speaker 0: if I'm super good at my job I can either find a harder job which in which I will have eight hours of work to do each day or I Can do a lesser job right and since I'm so good at it I can do the whole job in like 10 minutes and Slack the rest of the day.

455
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,279
Speaker 0: a professional slacker.

456
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:04,030
Speaker 0: watch out for these people people who are getting by without doing any work Sort of like Homer Simpson, they are secret geniuses.

457
00:35:04,371 --> 00:35:17,130
Speaker 0: They have awesome abilities and they're using like their immense power to do the bare minimum They have to do to get the job done and the rest of their time They're doing whatever the hell they want and they're not looking like genius.

458
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:20,070
Speaker 1: I mean think of this say I don't know an essay for an English class.

459
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,537
Speaker 1: You have to write an essay right.

460
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:39,365
Speaker 1: think about how much work it takes you to get the a paper Right the a paper the good paper the paper that is as good as it's gonna be not the a plus but the a. now think about how much less work it takes to get the B and Think about how much less work it takes to get to get the C.

461
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:45,910
Speaker 0: now think about how much less work It takes to get the C If you have the ability to write the a in like a half hour.

462
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:49,420
Speaker 0: think about how long it would take you to write the C even better.

463
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:11,629
Speaker 1: if you have done the all the professional slacker things and you've created in the eyes of the people who will be judging you the idea that you are brilliant and Awesome at everything you do then if you do a subpar job and you write the B paper or the C paper There's a good chance They're gonna give you the a anyway because they know what you're capable of or at least they think they know what you're capable of.

464
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,175
Speaker 0: Yes, you a slackers.

465
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:17,290
Speaker 0: next best thing is always figure out loopholes in the system.

466
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:24,310
Speaker 0: If there's a teacher who's not actually grading the papers and just sort of grading based on your name and then not reading them You need to take advantage of that.

467
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,990
Speaker 0: Just put your name on the paper and fill the rest of the page with words.

468
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:32,170
Speaker 0: put some real words at the beginning real words at the end and just gobbledygook all the way in between.

469
00:36:32,471 --> 00:36:33,956
Speaker 1: I've I often in high school.

470
00:36:34,036 --> 00:36:42,986
Speaker 1: I put in the middle of a lot of papers a single nonsense Sentence something about like I don't know cable ties and dogs and plus.

471
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:58,592
Speaker 0: if there is a way there's a situation in which there is work to be done and you can save a significant amount of time by making it look like the work was done when it was not and Nobody and everyone will be fooled by this Fucking.

472
00:36:58,632 --> 00:36:59,496
Speaker 1: do it now.

473
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,182
Speaker 0: remember don't worry that you did it.

474
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,948
Speaker 0: if you worry it won't work.

475
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:03,310
Speaker 1: now.

476
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:13,149
Speaker 1: Remember the key here is that no one will notice because if no one notices and no one could care and it doesn't affect anyone Then the work wasn't worth doing in the first place and you effectively did the work.

477
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,810
Speaker 0: Yeah It was the only work that they really assigned you was make it look like you did the work not to actually do the work

478
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:28,649
Speaker 1: Because in the world of a slacker Everything you do is not the sum of what you actually did But it is the sum of what other people have appraised of what they think you have done.

479
00:37:29,432 --> 00:37:36,774
Speaker 0: It's basically doing the least you can possibly do to get what you want in The least amount of time.

480
00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:41,185
Speaker 1: now the wonderful part of all this is sometimes to be a true slacker.

481
00:37:41,686 --> 00:37:48,290
Speaker 1: You have to put forth Uncountable amounts of effort early on in order to get the massive payoff later.

482
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:53,230
Speaker 1: For example say for the first quarter of your senior year of I don't know AP English class.

483
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,489
Speaker 1: I don't know why I keep using English maybe because I skip that the most.

484
00:37:56,492 --> 00:37:58,578
Speaker 1: You do crazy awesome work.

485
00:37:58,618 --> 00:38:01,565
Speaker 1: you go above and beyond on every possible assignment.

486
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,078
Speaker 1: the teacher now thinks you're the golden child for the rest of the year.

487
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:13,910
Speaker 1: you can do jack shit and you'll still get an A and I did that straight up my senior year to the point that I remember we did a presentation.

488
00:38:14,131 --> 00:38:22,610
Speaker 1: this was like a huge part of our year like we spent months on it and All the quote-unquote smart kids who are also professional slackers with one exception.

489
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:35,273
Speaker 1: We all got ourselves into the same group Mostly by begging and asking despite the fact that they were supposed to be random and we put together Something that I mean it wasn't bad in the I don't know MD Geist way It was just.

490
00:38:36,058 --> 00:38:38,190
Speaker 1: it was something that a C student would put together.

491
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,763
Speaker 1: It was garbage and we got an A just because our names were on it.

492
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:48,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, awesome and Other people in the class knew they could tell but what were they gonna say to the teacher?

493
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:49,759
Speaker 1: What did they possibly have said?

494
00:38:50,101 --> 00:38:51,390
Speaker 1: the teacher was already enamored?

495
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,898
Speaker 1: She had already fallen for our guiles.

496
00:38:52,939 --> 00:38:53,823
Speaker 1: There was no way out.

497
00:38:54,447 --> 00:38:59,201
Speaker 0: Yeah There's not much more to say about slack in really other than think.

498
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,304
Speaker 0: Oh, I know one thing.

499
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:05,278
Speaker 0: another key thing for a slacker is Not to want too much.

500
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:10,420
Speaker 0: remember before I was talking about how yeah You don't need all A's unless you want Harvard.

501
00:39:10,842 --> 00:39:14,396
Speaker 0: the more you want the more work You're gonna have to do to get it.

502
00:39:14,757 --> 00:39:18,410
Speaker 0: the less you want the less work you have to do regardless of your ability.

503
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:24,793
Speaker 0: So if you have a lot of ability and very few wants you don't have to do much Now.

504
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:28,570
Speaker 1: at the same time you can be a professional slacker and still want a lot.

505
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:30,078
Speaker 1: It just means that you go.

506
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:34,986
Speaker 1: you are going to get all of the things that you want With the least effort that you can possibly get.

507
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:35,985
Speaker 1: all of those things Yep.

508
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:40,790
Speaker 0: But if you want too many things that least effort still might be all goddamn day every day.

509
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:54,030
Speaker 1: the other thing you really have to worry about and this is probably the biggest thing is that When you are a professional slacker you have to realize that you're walking now a Razor thin line and that there is now very little room for error in college.

510
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:56,826
Speaker 1: I mean we said I make the determination of all right.

511
00:39:57,268 --> 00:40:00,346
Speaker 1: that Assignment that project that I don't want to do is worth 10% of my grade.

512
00:40:01,551 --> 00:40:04,959
Speaker 1: Alright, I can still get an A if I do everything else perfectly.

513
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:10,849
Speaker 1: now a single screw-up drops you to the B. a single Screw-up, there's no more margin.

514
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:17,651
Speaker 1: It's like when you're car racing the faster you go around that corner the less chance you have to recover if you fuck something up.

515
00:40:17,932 --> 00:40:32,610
Speaker 0: and thus the key to being an excellent slacker of the highest caliber is to Simultaneously walk the razor's edge and not worry about falling in either direction Despite the fact that falling in either direction can happen at any moment.

516
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:34,316
Speaker 0: Wow, I guess we kind of made it's.

517
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:38,210
Speaker 0: it's like you have to not worry when you should be worrying the most.

518
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:48,589
Speaker 1: You have to be like Lancelot in that you have to have a movie where Sean Connery played giant testicles such you know confidence and fortitudes.

519
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,868
Speaker 1: Right, uh we could say more, but frankly I'm kind of lazy, and I don't want to bother me either.

520
00:40:55,249 --> 00:41:02,009
Speaker 0: plus I kind of want to do a geek bite because you know we started this new segment last week And I got a really good one.

521
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:12,633
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother putting music in yet because I still have to figure out what kind of music I want to use for this segment, okay, so I'm gonna do a geek bite about an anime video Podcast.

522
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:13,436
Speaker 1: now notice.

523
00:41:13,456 --> 00:41:14,641
Speaker 1: We're not doing this on Wednesday.

524
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,568
Speaker 1: That's purely entirely by chance.

525
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:29,685
Speaker 0: yep There's an anime video podcast called track shun TV track - Shun like track or shun dot TV now.

526
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:30,629
Speaker 1: I saw it on dig.

527
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:38,068
Speaker 1: That's the only reason I knew about it because while I don't like the dig podcast thing It's still the best podcast thing in the world as far as I can see.

528
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:44,349
Speaker 1: yeah So I use it and I saw that at the bottom with a couple of digs a long time ago And I never really saw it go anywhere.

529
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:45,514
Speaker 0: I'll tell you the story.

530
00:41:46,077 --> 00:42:01,409
Speaker 0: so at Otacon was the first time I heard of this because I saw an advertisement For in the Otacon program and then at our podcasting roundtable panel the guy who does it was like hey I'm that guy who does it and Aaron from the Ninja Consultants was like whoa you're that guy you should be up here blah.

531
00:42:01,631 --> 00:42:02,909
Speaker 0: And I didn't know anything about this guy.

532
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,174
Speaker 0: I don't even know the guy's name And I watched the show.

533
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:07,906
Speaker 1: all I knew was that the last time I looked he had like five digs.

534
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:12,263
Speaker 1: so I thought wow Yeah, anyway, I think currently he has let's see are you gonna look?

535
00:42:12,424 --> 00:42:12,544
Speaker 1: no.

536
00:42:12,584 --> 00:42:13,427
Speaker 0: It's on his page.

537
00:42:13,668 --> 00:42:15,914
Speaker 0: Oh Hold on well.

538
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:18,405
Speaker 1: I don't get the people who put the like the amount of digs.

539
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:19,490
Speaker 1: They've gotten on their own website.

540
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,337
Speaker 0: It's on our website is it?

541
00:42:21,357 --> 00:42:22,482
Speaker 0: it's on the right side.

542
00:42:22,662 --> 00:42:23,787
Speaker 1: I don't actually look at our website.

543
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:24,349
Speaker 1: I don't like that.

544
00:42:25,411 --> 00:42:28,430
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, it's the thing that it lets you dig it when you click on it.

545
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:30,056
Speaker 1: I like the letting you dig it, but I don't.

546
00:42:30,377 --> 00:42:34,645
Speaker 0: I don't like the idea of touting thing is for podcasts on dig right now There's no other way.

547
00:42:35,771 --> 00:42:37,455
Speaker 1: Anyway, well, I still don't like it.

548
00:42:37,937 --> 00:42:41,907
Speaker 1: I'll go on the record saying that but whatever yeah, so it has 55 digs right now.

549
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:54,022
Speaker 0: anyway There was an ad for it in the Otacon program guide and the guy who does it was sitting in the back of the panel Room and he said that he you know does a video podcast.

550
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:54,825
Speaker 0: he does ads.

551
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:57,415
Speaker 0: he said he had like a zillion listeners.

552
00:42:57,778 --> 00:43:07,848
Speaker 0: his website says that He's the most popular anime video podcast on iTunes and it also says he's had over a million downloads something something something uh-huh.

553
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:09,414
Speaker 0: and he has 55 digs.

554
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:14,646
Speaker 0: and He said that he gets paid by his advertisers $500 an episode.

555
00:43:15,771 --> 00:43:18,541
Speaker 0: That's what he said at the podcasters roundtable panel.

556
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:19,565
Speaker 0: We have a recording of it.

557
00:43:19,665 --> 00:43:20,770
Speaker 0: I can go back and listen to it.

558
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:22,142
Speaker 0: It's not like it's also.

559
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:22,949
Speaker 0: you can listen to that.

560
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:27,410
Speaker 0: I think our five central put it up and the Ranger cast also put it up.

561
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,890
Speaker 0: So in either one of those podcasts you can listen to the podcasting roundtable panel.

562
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,530
Speaker 0: So this guy he did this show and I completely forgot about it after Otica.

563
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:41,034
Speaker 0: So Gerald IIM's me today and he says hey this traction thing Have you heard of it?

564
00:43:41,114 --> 00:43:42,320
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it sounds familiar.

565
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,190
Speaker 0: and he says it's that thing from the guy at Oticon.

566
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:45,155
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh that thing.

567
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:47,830
Speaker 0: and I decided on the way home today.

568
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:55,778
Speaker 0: I was gonna download every anime video podcast except for anime podcast net which I watch and I know And I'm gonna watch him on the way home.

569
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,850
Speaker 0: and there were three I downloaded and traction was one of them.

570
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:06,882
Speaker 0: I downloaded episode 50 of traction and I downloaded another episode maybe 48 I don't remember and I watched them on the way home.

571
00:44:06,902 --> 00:44:11,178
Speaker 0: I Expected something bad, you know just cuz.

572
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:12,081
Speaker 0: obviously it's me.

573
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:13,346
Speaker 0: What was I gonna consider?

574
00:44:13,366 --> 00:44:13,587
Speaker 1: this?

575
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:21,614
Speaker 1: I'd say 99% of the podcast I have tried to listen to were god-awful like a solid 99%.

576
00:44:21,614 --> 00:44:33,038
Speaker 0: So this is an anime video podcast I expected bad Right, and I'm about to describe to you the format of this show and I won't need to describe anything else after I describe the Format of the show.

577
00:44:33,158 --> 00:44:34,125
Speaker 0: that's all I need to say.

578
00:44:34,146 --> 00:44:38,085
Speaker 0: you're ready But I don't want rim to say anything until I say.

579
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:39,290
Speaker 0: and that's the end of the episode.

580
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:42,429
Speaker 1: I will not say a word until Scott bids me to.

581
00:44:43,031 --> 00:45:05,959
Speaker 0: okay, the episode opens with the episode intro and The guy who does the show is sitting next to his giant television with his laptop on his lap and He's wearing obvious You know anime merchandise hat and shirt stuff You'll see out for sale at a convention usually and he'll talk for maybe I don't know 30 seconds telling you which three shows He's going to review.

582
00:45:06,962 --> 00:45:12,440
Speaker 0: Then he will show you Five minutes of the first anime he's going to review.

583
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,540
Speaker 0: He'll just show you the anime like here it is and I'll show you like a good five to ten minutes of the first episode.

584
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:32,528
Speaker 0: Then he will come back on screen for maybe Ten to thirty seconds to tell you, you know What Japanese snacks he's eating this episode because he eats three Japanese snacks each show right which is also Merchandise he's trying to sell.

585
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:38,773
Speaker 0: Um, then he'll show you Five to ten minutes more of that same first episode.

586
00:45:38,833 --> 00:45:48,408
Speaker 0: So I watched a show where he reviewed claymore So he showed a good Almost like a good almost half of the first episode of claymore Maybe even more than half of the first episode of claymore.

587
00:45:48,448 --> 00:45:52,000
Speaker 0: just straight up like copied the fansub pasted it into his episode.

588
00:45:52,741 --> 00:45:53,808
Speaker 0: After the episode is over.

589
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:56,542
Speaker 0: He'll come back on screen and he'll say something This is just.

590
00:45:56,662 --> 00:45:59,874
Speaker 0: you know, I'm gonna pretend to do a review in the way.

591
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,340
Speaker 0: He does a review of a show, right?

592
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:02,909
Speaker 0: Let's say he just watched.

593
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:05,802
Speaker 0: I don't know Nakano.

594
00:46:05,922 --> 00:46:07,630
Speaker 0: no, he just he just watched a he.

595
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:10,100
Speaker 0: one of the things I saw him review was a harem show, right?

596
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,195
Speaker 0: So he said up a typical harem show one guy bunch of girls.

597
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:15,782
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, it's.

598
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:20,220
Speaker 0: it's not really any different than any other kind of harem show, but it made me laugh.

599
00:46:20,483 --> 00:46:21,619
Speaker 0: So I'll give this one a track.

600
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:24,420
Speaker 0: That's that's the entirety of one of his reviews.

601
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:34,198
Speaker 0: he pretty much either gives a show a track or a shun which is good or bad and He reviews a show in like five seconds and doesn't say much about it other than like.

602
00:46:34,419 --> 00:46:37,892
Speaker 0: hey This is a robot show and it wasn't as good as that robot show.

603
00:46:37,932 --> 00:46:39,056
Speaker 0: I watched last week shun.

604
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:42,268
Speaker 0: That's the review He gives after reviewing a show.

605
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:49,479
Speaker 0: He shows a j-list ad because j-list is a sponsor and He will you know, he makes the ads that he puts in the show.

606
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,900
Speaker 0: So he made an ad for j-list and he put it in the show.

607
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:52,839
Speaker 0: It's a good minute long.

608
00:46:53,482 --> 00:47:03,414
Speaker 0: then he'll continue talking about j-list for like 10 more 30 more seconds and He will repeat that episode showing and review process two more times.

609
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:30,420
Speaker 0: So you're gonna get three j-list ads three like 30 second intermissions in the middle of the episodes of him saying Japanese snack something something and you're gonna get 10 second reviews at the end of the episodes of him saying track or shun and you're gonna get a j-list ad at the end of each episode and you're gonna get like 20 minutes or like 15 minutes 10 minutes maybe of the first episode of the fan-subbed anime that he watched.

610
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,724
Speaker 1: I gotta say I'm three.

611
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:33,348
Speaker 1: Ah, I gotta talk.

612
00:47:33,689 --> 00:47:39,530
Speaker 0: that is the entirety of every single show This guy makes the end.

613
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:40,675
Speaker 1: What the fuck is?

614
00:47:40,957 --> 00:47:41,419
Speaker 0: who would?

615
00:47:42,702 --> 00:47:49,034
Speaker 0: Imagine if instead of reviewing baka no We just played the audio of baka no for say 20 minutes and then said we liked it.

616
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,177
Speaker 0: Have a good night.

617
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:54,120
Speaker 1: All right I'm gonna let I mean I'm not angry.

618
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:56,779
Speaker 1: There are only two ways I can look at this.

619
00:47:57,402 --> 00:48:04,539
Speaker 1: This guy is either an idiot or a genius and he is either lying or a scumbag.

620
00:48:05,021 --> 00:48:05,422
Speaker 1: Yep.

621
00:48:05,522 --> 00:48:07,668
Speaker 1: Now here are the reasons either.

622
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:21,389
Speaker 1: He's an idiot and he's just a pawn of the advertisers and nothing more or He realizes that advertisers are stupid and he is milking them for all their worth in the true slacker way with minimal effort Possible.

623
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:29,796
Speaker 0: Yep, either Jlist is like hey this tool is basically making a video podcast That is nothing more than an ad for us and he's only doing it for $500 an episode.

624
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:36,157
Speaker 0: This is so much cheaper than paying someone to actually do this job like a video podcast consultant or something.

625
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:37,140
Speaker 0: This is awesome.

626
00:48:38,481 --> 00:48:41,148
Speaker 0: Or this guy's saying oh man, this is so easy.

627
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,694
Speaker 0: Jlist is giving me $500 for an episode for doing shit.

628
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:44,657
Speaker 0: Who cares?

629
00:48:44,737 --> 00:48:44,837
Speaker 0: Whoo?

630
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:47,562
Speaker 1: Now?

631
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:49,676
Speaker 1: and the other thing in terms of how much money he makes.

632
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:59,345
Speaker 1: I Really wouldn't be surprised if he was lying but at the same time I wouldn't because I've talked to advertisers in the past and we've been propositioned a couple times and They really have no clue.

633
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,272
Speaker 1: They really have no idea at all.

634
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:03,680
Speaker 1: They they're just stupid as far as I can see.

635
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I don't understand this show.

636
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:08,140
Speaker 0: I don't know why it's so popular.

637
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:08,643
Speaker 0: Well, I do.

638
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:09,851
Speaker 0: it says on his website.

639
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:11,300
Speaker 0: He has more than a million downloads.

640
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,088
Speaker 0: Wait a minute when he was featured on iTunes.

641
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:14,193
Speaker 1: more than a million downloads.

642
00:49:14,234 --> 00:49:15,560
Speaker 1: We have more than a million downloads.

643
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:16,488
Speaker 0: I know well know.

644
00:49:16,508 --> 00:49:17,518
Speaker 0: how many episodes do we have?

645
00:49:17,518 --> 00:49:20,427
Speaker 0: 400 about times how many fingers.

646
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:28,006
Speaker 1: thing on how he counts the stats because if you like if you count the raw raw raw stats of Total downloads from our libsyn.

647
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,290
Speaker 1: It's almost a million.

648
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he only did 50 episodes.

649
00:49:31,977 --> 00:49:32,177
Speaker 1: Yeah.

650
00:49:32,278 --> 00:49:35,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know Yeah, but even then I just I don't know.

651
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:40,280
Speaker 0: I don't trust his stats too much and even if I either I think it's also mostly because he was featured on iTunes.

652
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,639
Speaker 0: It basically means a million downloads right away.

653
00:49:43,282 --> 00:49:43,422
Speaker 0: Much.

654
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:52,780
Speaker 0: anyone who was reported that they have been featured on iTunes on that front page of the podcasting directory has Always gotten a huge jump in people paying attention to their show.

655
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,573
Speaker 1: The thing is I wonder how many of those people actually continue to watch.

656
00:49:56,653 --> 00:49:59,847
Speaker 0: well judging by his 55 digs Not many of them are dig users.

657
00:50:00,068 --> 00:50:00,229
Speaker 0: Yeah.

658
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:02,139
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is a show like that.

659
00:50:02,421 --> 00:50:03,726
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be perfectly blunt.

660
00:50:04,068 --> 00:50:05,253
Speaker 1: only an idiot would watch it.

661
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:06,759
Speaker 0: I just don't get it.

662
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:22,040
Speaker 1: So either there are a lot of idiots out there both as advertisers and his content watchers or the guy is milking and Exaggerating his initial figures in order to trick advertisers into giving him his only advertisers j-list.

663
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:30,355
Speaker 0: so he's either milking j-list or j-list is milking him or So one of them is taking advantage of the other or they both think they're taking advantage of the other.

664
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:42,340
Speaker 0: and I don't know what's going on here, but You should not waste your time watching track - on TV The anime review video podcast because there's no reviews.

665
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:51,680
Speaker 0: He's just showing you like 10 to 15 minutes of new fans of anime and then saying yes or no to them And that's it and then showing you j-list ads.

666
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,224
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

667
00:50:55,081 --> 00:50:58,940
Speaker 1: I'm reasonably certain that what he is doing may or may not burn foul of the law.

668
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:00,660
Speaker 0: That's what I was thinking as well.

669
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,844
Speaker 0: I forgot to mention it just now but when I watched it on the train He's just showing.

670
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:14,143
Speaker 0: he's basically copying and pasting significant portions of you know basically new fansub to anime Into.

671
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:18,880
Speaker 1: his video podcast sounds like he is stretching the idea of fair use quite to its limit.

672
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:28,037
Speaker 0: yes, not only that but his is show is released under the attribution non-commercial no derivative Creative Commons 2.5 lice.

673
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:38,595
Speaker 0: Really I don't think you can take a copyrighted work like that and put it out under Creative Commons license because people aren't allowed to freely share those fansub.

674
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:44,740
Speaker 0: it's not legal and I mean if it could it is fair use to show something when you're reviewing it.

675
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,038
Speaker 0: However, if you watch Siskel and Ebert or any like, you know movie critic.

676
00:51:49,118 --> 00:51:50,720
Speaker 0: on TV They show a clip from the movie.

677
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:55,398
Speaker 1: However, I think the operative word there is a clip and I wonder what the courts would have to say about shows.

678
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,461
Speaker 0: at least It's got to be 10 minutes I got.

679
00:51:57,501 --> 00:52:02,300
Speaker 0: I'll actually count and figure out the exact minute counts of things, but it's not worth my time.

680
00:52:02,821 --> 00:52:08,936
Speaker 0: But the vast majority of the show I would say in the entirety of the show the up to two episodes.

681
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:13,573
Speaker 0: I watched about Less than five minutes of the show is the guy talking.

682
00:52:13,854 --> 00:52:15,020
Speaker 0: that's not an advertisement.

683
00:52:15,863 --> 00:52:32,240
Speaker 0: There's about less than five minutes maybe five minutes total of advertisements including the guy talking and saying advertisements and the rest of the show is just Fansub to anime straight up like two Really big portions of an the first episode of a show.

684
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:33,503
Speaker 1: You know what?

685
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:35,348
