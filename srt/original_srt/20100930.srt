1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,167
Speaker 1: It's Thursday September 30th.

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:11,870
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,059
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,699
Speaker 1: tonight We have our thoughts with the geek nights book club on the golden apples of the Sun by Ray Bradbury.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,078
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:37,280
Speaker 1: so our work for project st has Been annoying mostly for the fact that the only lights we own are These kind of work lights that are not designed for video work in any way.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,900
Speaker 0: I mean did we buy them because you're trying to save money, and yeah, they were like 20 bucks.

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,505
Speaker 1: They came on the stand.

9
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:43,729
Speaker 1: They're super bright.

10
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:46,880
Speaker 1: They're hotter than the fucking Sun.

11
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,917
Speaker 0: Why don't we just put like something in front of them to you know even you know to make it?

12
00:00:50,977 --> 00:00:57,680
Speaker 1: even we did that Still wasn't good enough Because then they weren't bright enough, and they weren't that good, and they were still fucking hot.

13
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,127
Speaker 0: Maybe we just need a better shield.

14
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:02,999
Speaker 0: I mean any lights you get any be fucking no no LEDs That's true.

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,302
Speaker 1: See the thing is we were trying to save money back then when we bought that and we were first delving into video And then we gave up.

16
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,309
Speaker 1: now that we're smart and serious.

17
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:12,713
Speaker 1: We're doing the Moran strategy.

18
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:18,019
Speaker 1: I'm just buying a real fucking set of lights and Actually, I learned something scary, but I mean LEDs.

19
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:26,268
Speaker 0: I mean while that's well and good with the heat and the electricity usage and such they're also much brighter than those lights Yeah, but there's no professionals using LED.

20
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:28,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do use them all the time really.

21
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,634
Speaker 1: yeah I found some very high-end LED lights.

22
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:31,580
Speaker 1: Here's the trouble.

23
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:46,555
Speaker 1: I was looking on Amazon because I I couldn't find many places to buy Professional video lights online that weren't way overpriced way beyond what we need or Very shady looking sites that I do not trust for one shit mm-hmm.

24
00:01:46,776 --> 00:02:13,956
Speaker 1: so on Amazon I find all these kits like video kit from this one company and like every set of studio lights for photography or video is this one company and they sell like these two light three light four light kits for like two three hundred bucks and A little investigation show that not only are these kits the biggest pieces of shit you've ever seen But you can get professional equipment With the same number of lights that are a lot brighter and a lot better for the same price.

25
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,266
Speaker 1: just not on Amazon Uh-huh, but the only place.

26
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,589
Speaker 0: these aren't sold by Amazon.

27
00:02:18,609 --> 00:02:21,337
Speaker 0: They're sold by other companies that are just selling through Amazon.

28
00:02:21,678 --> 00:02:26,165
Speaker 0: Yeah exactly Yeah, I mean, it's not Amazon isn't trying to rip you off Amazon was.

29
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:31,813
Speaker 1: it's some other guy, but and I so you know doing some research I found exactly what to get.

30
00:02:31,873 --> 00:02:39,991
Speaker 1: for like 300 bucks I can get a pretty professional like video studio setup like everything I'm gonna need and the best part is they're portable.

31
00:02:40,012 --> 00:02:41,700
Speaker 1: they take freaking batteries if we want.

32
00:02:41,941 --> 00:02:43,587
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not like four hours of light.

33
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,780
Speaker 0: Whoa, but yeah, cuz they're LEDs you can get away with it.

34
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,859
Speaker 1: Yeah And they're still way brighter than what we have now and we can use what we have now as a backfill light.

35
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:52,950
Speaker 1: All right, we need to.

36
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,679
Speaker 1: so it's all good.

37
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:59,378
Speaker 1: The only place online so far that I can find this one light that I actually want to buy is B&H.

38
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:03,546
Speaker 0: Ah Bastard in hell.

39
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:08,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I Can't.

40
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:09,834
Speaker 1: B&H has been my bet.

41
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:13,149
Speaker 1: I've never Successfully entered a B&H.

42
00:03:13,371 --> 00:03:13,753
Speaker 0: It's all wait.

43
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,655
Speaker 0: Well, there's only one festival All right, and the thing is people in New York are like such fans of this place, right?

44
00:03:18,675 --> 00:03:19,840
Speaker 0: I went there once.

45
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:24,920
Speaker 0: I've never bought anything there and like You know the good things about it.

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,215
Speaker 0: It's a physical store and it has stuff that no other physical store has in terms of like.

47
00:03:29,295 --> 00:03:30,600
Speaker 0: it has professional equipment.

48
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,052
Speaker 0: You know, if you look around New York City most electronics places are.

49
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:43,225
Speaker 0: they're either Best Buy kind of places where they have consumer stuff right or They are the sort of you know those places the touristy ones.

50
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:45,251
Speaker 0: they just have like a million cameras in the window.

51
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:49,424
Speaker 1: understood those places because I've gone into them several times Before I eventually stopped.

52
00:03:49,785 --> 00:03:52,576
Speaker 1: they never had a deal that was better than Amazon.

53
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:53,800
Speaker 0: I mean, they're not about deals.

54
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,487
Speaker 0: Those are places about being overpriced and to sell the tourists, but they act like check out all this cheap electronics We got.

55
00:03:59,507 --> 00:04:00,320
Speaker 1: we got tons of stuff.

56
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,160
Speaker 0: No, I got tons of overpriced stuff like two years old cameras for twice as much as original price.

57
00:04:05,361 --> 00:04:08,417
Speaker 1: But they the way you talk to the salesman and they act like they've got.

58
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:10,534
Speaker 1: they're like, yeah We got these off a truck this crazy deal.

59
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:11,079
Speaker 1: Check it out.

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, right now but with audio and with other sorts of professional things like.

61
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:22,202
Speaker 1: there's Sam Ash but there's like five or six other places I can go to and I can get all the stuff on Amazon or same-day music or Whatever.

62
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:28,639
Speaker 1: but the stuff I want these particular lights I can only get from B&H and all those shady places.

63
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:36,720
Speaker 0: Well B&H like they actually have everything and their prices They're not as good as internet prices except for this thing because I can't find this thing anywhere.

64
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:42,582
Speaker 1: So I guess that's the best price which is much lower than these shitty kits that are the same thing But worse.

65
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,800
Speaker 0: on Amazon, for example, I went to look at my TV at B&H and I bought it on Amazon for less.

66
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like.

67
00:04:48,066 --> 00:04:51,080
Speaker 1: that's the internet future until everyone does that and then the stores are gone.

68
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:58,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but B&H is like this big weird store that just happens to have everything from consumer to professional level stuff.

69
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:11,979
Speaker 0: And the thing is they make a ton of money because some people still like to go to stores I don't know why and other people like professional TV and radio people and photographers in the city all go there to you know Look at stuff and buy stuff and whatever, you know.

70
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:16,662
Speaker 1: Well part of the reason they go there is that some of this stuff I can't find anywhere else I guess.

71
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:20,520
Speaker 0: but I guess if also if you're a professional you need it now and your company's paying for it.

72
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,920
Speaker 0: So what do you care if it's on the internet for ten bucks less?

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,973
Speaker 1: So I think we've covered all the good things about B&H.

74
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I go to their website today, right?

75
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,420
Speaker 1: I'm at work and I'm like, alright, this is what I'm gonna buy after work.

76
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,366
Speaker 1: I'll just go over there and just buy it.

77
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:35,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, oh wait now even better.

78
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:37,040
Speaker 1: I'll just order from their website.

79
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:44,278
Speaker 1: They sell stuff online to go to the website and there's a pop-up over it That says online ordering is unavailable until Saturday at 8 p.m.

80
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:44,700

82
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:52,587
Speaker 1: sorry for the inconvenience and I forgot about the deal that we haven't talked about yet The real reason why I hate the NH.

83
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,113
Speaker 1: so I was like, oh crap.

84
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,880

Speaker 0: It's on the.

88
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,320
Speaker 0: it's on the other side of Madison Square Garden.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,975
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like 9th Avenue and 34th or something like that.

90
00:06:05,196 --> 00:06:07,342
Speaker 1: I walk over there and Closed.

91
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:11,799
Speaker 1: of course, it's closed and I realized it's been closed for the last week and a half because of suckus.

92
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:16,740
Speaker 1: No, it's suckus suckus or sick coat and right before that it was closed for something else.

93
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,184
Speaker 1: And of course, it's closed every Friday.

94
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:21,835
Speaker 0: You see being a well, it's Friday night and Saturday.

95
00:06:21,956 --> 00:06:23,320
Speaker 1: It's super Jewish.

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,826
Speaker 0: It's owned by like the most religious Jews.

97
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:26,588
Speaker 0: you can imagine.

98
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:30,558
Speaker 1: they bring the online store down for holidays and the physical store.

99
00:06:30,819 --> 00:06:34,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Basically, you know, I think there's nothing right.

100
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,074
Speaker 1: I know I can't go there Friday.

101
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:37,880
Speaker 1: I'm already aware that yeah, they're Jews.

102
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,580
Speaker 1: I can't do business with them on Friday.

103
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:43,695
Speaker 1: I thought I'd be safe Thursday, but Scott your people have so many holidays.

104
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:44,940
Speaker 0: They don't have that many holidays.

105
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:47,375
Speaker 0: Did you know did you see that the thing is when they do have a holiday?

106
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:48,180
Speaker 0: It's many days long.

107
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:49,808
Speaker 1: That depends.

108
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,900
Speaker 1: there's got to be some one day.

109
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:52,727
Speaker 0: No, no, there's not that many.

110
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,611
Speaker 0: most of them are like.

111
00:06:53,812 --> 00:07:03,340
Speaker 0: for example Yom Kippur is a one-day holiday Yeah, but Rosh Hashanah right is a multi-day holiday and the last day of Rosh Hashanah is immediately followed by Yom Kippur.

112
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,433
Speaker 0: So it's actually part of another multi-day holiday thing.

113
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,140
Speaker 1: is I think nerds are gonna.

114
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:10,249
Speaker 1: We have more holidays than the Jews at this point.

115
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:12,780
Speaker 1: I think oh, yeah, I mean talk like a pirate day.

116
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,241
Speaker 0: Well, we got.

117
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:16,030
Speaker 0: actually our problem is we make everything day.

118
00:07:16,111 --> 00:07:20,242
Speaker 0: The Jews are like, yeah, uh-huh day Okay.

119
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:20,805
Speaker 0: Okay.

120
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:21,831
Speaker 0: Yell at the sky week.

121
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:22,756
Speaker 0: That's how you get it.

122
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:27,520
Speaker 1: Yeah to work I had to yell at the sky five years and you know living in Rochester.

123
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, Jews are like, you know what no work every Friday night or Saturday Impossible, you know, it's like they just like crank up the days on purpose.

124
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:41,979
Speaker 1: So I can't get these lights now.

125
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:44,047
Speaker 1: I was gonna have them and shine a mind.

126
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:44,830
Speaker 1: you all were doing the show.

127
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,728

Speaker 1: and yet finally I'm like, all right I'm getting off my ass and I physically and incapable of doing the one thing I tried to do today.

130
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:06,180
Speaker 0: I don't know why I even tried to go there because I can't find anywhere else to get this fucking light.

131
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:06,702
Speaker 0: Here's what you do.

132
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:10,700
Speaker 1: you ready you go and you buy a similar light that I can get in another store.

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,854
Speaker 1: But they don't have the light I want and the similar light is the next step up.

134
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:15,260
Speaker 0: It's eight grand.

135
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:16,126
Speaker 0: Here's what you do.

136
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:18,260
Speaker 0: you go and you find what kind of light bulbs are in there?

137
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:18,781
Speaker 0: No, it's.

138
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,207
Speaker 1: there's no light bulbs an LED.

139
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:21,553
Speaker 0: you buy the center.

140
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:23,240
Speaker 1: No, it's an array of LEDs.

141
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:25,890
Speaker 0: You go buy a huge box full of LEDs.

142
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,003
Speaker 0: Yes, and we can light them up now Why not?

143
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:31,613
Speaker 1: You know how pain in the ass would be to set that up.

144
00:08:31,774 --> 00:08:32,738
Speaker 0: I have soldering iron.

145
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,179
Speaker 0: I can do it.

146
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,386
Speaker 1: You do it then I'll work on something else.

147
00:08:35,408 --> 00:08:39,962
Speaker 0: go figure out what LED we need and buy enough of them and doesn't say What do you mean.

148
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,748
Speaker 1: doesn't say what LED uses.

149
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:46,320
Speaker 0: go buy the brightest white LED you can find and get a whole box full of them.

150
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:55,938
Speaker 1: Yeah and you're gonna solder these in and have the right light balance and the white balance the right temperature color and have them focus that They're diffused properly without needing a screen or a gel or anything.

151
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:56,340
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

152
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,619
Speaker 0: You just put them in a grid on a circuit board.

153
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:01,315
Speaker 1: What do you know exactly what to do to get them correctly?

154
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,260
Speaker 0: we get it one resistor.

155
00:09:02,381 --> 00:09:03,586
Speaker 0: I hate double-a batteries.

156
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:12,195
Speaker 0: you get a resistor on each one and you're gonna make my AC adapters And you're gonna make the poles and the stands and you don't get an AC that you can get.

157
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,319
Speaker 0: you just buy DC there.

158
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:14,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna.

159
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:18,620
Speaker 1: what the fuck am I gonna plug that into my power supply fire?

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,754
Speaker 0: Well, no, you just buy one of these guys and it goes in the wall.

161
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:22,920
Speaker 0: then DC comes out the other end.

162
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott you get on that.

163
00:09:23,964 --> 00:09:24,707
Speaker 1: I'm I have one.

164
00:09:24,928 --> 00:09:27,479
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna wait until they stop doing their holiday BS.

165
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:28,784
Speaker 0: You're actually gonna go there.

166
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:30,993
Speaker 0: Okay, but you won't shop in Paramus.

167
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:34,089
Speaker 1: No, I won't shop in prime But you'll shop at the juice store.

168
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:35,136
Speaker 0: Well, which is far worse.

169
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:35,760
Speaker 1: Here's the secret.

170
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:44,691
Speaker 1: I am very very willing to jump on to protests and things like that When I am protesting something that I would not have engaged in.

171
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:46,597
Speaker 1: Anyway, there is nothing in premise.

172
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,782
Speaker 1: I want or need There's.

173
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,511
Speaker 1: I don't need anything from Scientology.

174
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,998
Speaker 1: So I boycott the shit out of them.

175
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,519
Speaker 1: You're not gonna see me boycott an Amazon for much.

176
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,621
Speaker 0: Yeah Such such a such a high moral Convictions.

177
00:10:05,002 --> 00:10:08,514
Speaker 1: so you got any any news here and it's not really news.

178
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:09,236
Speaker 0: This is article.

179
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,380
Speaker 0: I wanted to discuss, right?

180
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:20,003
Speaker 0: It was in the Sunday book review of the New York Times and the Internet's And he basically talks about how because you always yell at me for like forgetting everything I read in a book.

181
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:21,888
Speaker 0: pretty much it amazing.

182
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:24,536
Speaker 1: It's okay to forget like oh, what did he go to?

183
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:25,720
Speaker 1: the town of Bethlehem?

184
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:26,522
Speaker 1: Nazareth?

185
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:31,356
Speaker 1: it's another thing to forget like the name of the protagonist from a series of books you read.

186
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:36,454
Speaker 0: but the point this guy talks About how you know, he has the guy who's the main character in Locke Lamora.

187
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:37,900
Speaker 0: Locke Lamora, okay?

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,836
Speaker 1: Who's a sidekick?

189
00:10:41,664 --> 00:10:41,916
Speaker 0: Jean?

190
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,751
Speaker 1: Okay, Jean what were the twins names?

191
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:46,238
Speaker 1: You don't remember do you?

192
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:47,861
Speaker 1: The twins?

193
00:10:48,263 --> 00:10:48,945
Speaker 0: what were their names?

194
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:49,547
Speaker 1: the twins?

195
00:10:49,808 --> 00:10:52,897
Speaker 0: Well, they had names the twins someone so and so and so.

196
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:53,640
Speaker 1: yeah the twins.

197
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:54,592
Speaker 0: Yes, you don't remember.

198
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,120
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

199
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,203
Speaker 1: Anyway,

200
00:10:57,243 --> 00:11:21,263
Speaker 0: the point is this guy has this whole article here and he talks about how while he remembers reading books and he remembers moments Of in them and feelings and in these sorts of things he can't like even like a book He just read or a book that had a huge impact on him or like, you know He can't really remember that many specific things like you can't tell you every scene in order You know is the same and I was like, oh man, that's just like me I can't remember shit.

201
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:39,930
Speaker 0: and he went around asking all these people like hey You know, is it okay that you don't remember anything in the book and they're like, yeah, of course It's like everything that you don't remember from all these books still like gets into your subconscious And they all get added together and just sort of like, you know And they change you in some way that you can't.

202
00:11:40,272 --> 00:11:41,640
Speaker 0: I just cuz you don't remember a fact.

203
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,126
Speaker 1: I definitely agree with that.

204
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:48,838
Speaker 1: and also, you know, it's kind of like you have a pointer array in your brain But you might not have the pointers to.

205
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:54,780
Speaker 1: you know The names of these characters or whatever but like on the surface or connected to the name of the book even anymore.

206
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:59,097
Speaker 1: But there's a pointer there somewhere and you might hit it while you're looking for something else.

207
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:03,197
Speaker 0: Yeah There's an interesting little two-page dealing about how you know.

208
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:14,580
Speaker 0: at the same time It's important and good to read books Even though you don't remember anything, you know You might not remember facts or you know details from books like characters names or places or sequences of events.

209
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:20,284
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean that it wasn't worthwhile to read that book, but at the same time No meaning.

210
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:25,220
Speaker 1: I only have this problem with books that I didn't particularly like or they didn't speak to me.

211
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:29,453
Speaker 1: I can go into great goddamn detail about everything in The Prince of Nothing.

212
00:12:29,474 --> 00:12:31,279
Speaker 0: How many times did you read The Prince of Nothing once?

213
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:36,268
Speaker 0: Lord of the Rings, yeah, what about it?

214
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:37,532
Speaker 1: What was the dwarf's name?

215
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:38,916
Speaker 0: Which one though?

216
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:40,059
Speaker 1: the one Gimli?

217
00:12:41,323 --> 00:12:47,762
Speaker 0: Oh Because I was thinking because yeah, I Realized.

218
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,027
Speaker 0: I said Lord of the Rings.

219
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:52,020
Speaker 0: my brain went to the beginning of the story and it always goes to the hobbit.

220
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:00,066
Speaker 0: so I was like, so lumen and lumen and Thorin and It's like a whole pile of dwarves now.

221
00:13:00,106 --> 00:13:00,889
Speaker 0: It's like friggin snow.

222
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,474
Speaker 1: white dwarf fortresses ruined me.

223
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:12,608
Speaker 1: whenever I picture the hobbit now I can't but imagine like Thorin just losing his shit like killing five or sixty other dwarves Walling himself up in a room and crying herself to death.

224
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,150
Speaker 0: That's what happens.

225
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,114
Speaker 1: It's like out of nowhere.

226
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:14,796
Speaker 0: That's what happened.

227
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:15,379
Speaker 0: That's the book.

228
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:28,540
Speaker 1: All right, so you should read this because it's book club appropriate news, so our government Decided that they have to deal with a very serious problem and they actually serious.

229
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,814
Speaker 1: They actually got together and they put together a law a bill.

230
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:34,797
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell.

231
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,060
Speaker 1: is it passed there?

232
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:37,729
Speaker 1: Don't know it's not passed yet.

233
00:13:37,749 --> 00:13:38,332
Speaker 0: It's a federal.

234
00:13:38,352 --> 00:13:39,720
Speaker 0: It's a federal situation.

235
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:48,843
Speaker 1: So it is called the CA LM the commercial advertisement loudness Mitigation acts.

236
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:49,805
Speaker 1: so the coma.

237
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:50,888
Speaker 0: Oh, it's all.

238
00:13:50,928 --> 00:13:56,482
Speaker 0: this is because commercials on TV purposefully make their audio louder than the TV episodes.

239
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:57,406
Speaker 0: so stand out.

240
00:13:57,466 --> 00:14:05,557
Speaker 1: and so here's my my problem here how When did the first television enter American households like the 450s?

241
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:09,059
Speaker 1: When did ads start appearing on TVs?

242
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,062
Speaker 0: Immediately?

243
00:14:10,122 --> 00:14:13,240
Speaker 0: because they would have the people in the show because all the shows are live.

244
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:18,114
Speaker 0: They had the people Stop doing the show and do a product promotion like right in the middle of the show.

245
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:21,697
Speaker 0: like and the news tonight is blah Blah blah blah blah and you should buy Wheaties.

246
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,060
Speaker 0: check it out.

247
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,576
Speaker 0: I got a box of Wheaties from a guy who handed it to me offstage.

248
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,160
Speaker 0: You should buy this.

249
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,120
Speaker 0: Okay back to the news by the meet-a-vegetin.

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,494
Speaker 1: Okay, so to to skip the leading questions.

251
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:31,600
Speaker 1: I was going to keep asking you.

252
00:14:32,361 --> 00:14:35,519
Speaker 1: Commercials have been way louder than everything else for fucking ever.

253
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:38,974
Speaker 0: They didn't raise the volume on the commercials in the 80s.

254
00:14:39,014 --> 00:14:39,677
Speaker 1: They were like that.

255
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:45,143
Speaker 0: That's true All right, so it's not that new but it is 70s 80s 90s 2000s 2010s.

256
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:48,634
Speaker 1: we're now in the era where broadcast television is on the way out.

257
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:53,869
Speaker 1: people are moving to the internet and Congress is like we are gonna deal with this problem.

258
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:54,390
Speaker 1: Now.

259
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:55,694
Speaker 1: We got this shit.

260
00:14:55,935 --> 00:14:57,940
Speaker 1: We're gonna protect you from those buggy whips.

261
00:14:58,801 --> 00:15:00,567
Speaker 1: The buggy whip mitigation act is here.

262
00:15:00,587 --> 00:15:02,674
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a good thing right, but it's still.

263
00:15:02,714 --> 00:15:03,797
Speaker 0: it's fixing a problem.

264
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:04,540
Speaker 0: It's too old.

265
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,939
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean even worse.

266
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:07,585
Speaker 1: Technology already solves this.

267
00:15:07,786 --> 00:15:11,478
Speaker 1: it's trivial to just put a limiter or a lot of TV.

268
00:15:11,518 --> 00:15:13,285
Speaker 0: a lot of TVs Have those

269
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:13,546
Speaker 1: they

270
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:17,924
Speaker 0: have like a button you push and it basically keeps all the sound, you know Even I don't

271
00:15:17,944 --> 00:15:19,089
Speaker 1: have anything else to say about make

272
00:15:19,109 --> 00:15:20,997
Speaker 0: sure the highs aren't too high and lows aren't too low

273
00:15:21,097 --> 00:15:26,340
Speaker 1: other than that Way too little way too late and this is why I'm so fed up with our government that this is their issue.

274
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,243
Speaker 0: It's all old people.

275
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,528
Speaker 0: they need to I'm telling you they need.

276
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:40,440
Speaker 1: every generation gets into power and then tries to solve the problems of The jet of when they were kids and then they seem to forget that kids when they're old Have other problems and they seem to forget that they used to be the same way.

277
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:40,560
Speaker 1: I

278
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:47,837
Speaker 0: think I think I finally because I've been trying to figure out a way right how to get people out of government that are old and I think I finally figured out a way and I think the way

279
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:51,259
Speaker 1: I Came up with so many jokes, but all

280
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,074
Speaker 0: no I finally figured out a reasonable way to get people to get the old people out right.

281
00:15:56,315 --> 00:15:59,184
Speaker 1: just no elevators all stairs No ready for this.

282
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:01,493
Speaker 0: This is the most reasonable idea yet.

283
00:16:01,513 --> 00:16:02,496
Speaker 0: Okay, you ready?

284
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,460
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

285
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:12,339
Speaker 0: I'm sure if you are going to be Logan's right in government like a mayor or a congressperson or whatever You also have to have a job a real job.

286
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:14,519
Speaker 0: So your places are like that.

287
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:20,620
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like if you are not employed if you're retired or if you're homeless or you cannot be a congressperson.

288
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:21,062
Speaker 1: All right.

289
00:16:21,183 --> 00:16:21,645
Speaker 1: All right Scott.

290
00:16:21,686 --> 00:16:24,380
Speaker 0: It has to be something to do in addition to your real work.

291
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:30,820
Speaker 0: I work as a consultant and no you have to have a real job that you actually work at nine to five.

292
00:16:31,142 --> 00:16:34,280
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're discounting lots of perfectly legitimate actual jobs.

293
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:39,708
Speaker 0: It has to be a job where you're actually working like for reals not just a. you know I have a job on paper.

294
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,720
Speaker 0: You have to prove that you are working for real.

295
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,465
Speaker 1: So I think a better.

296
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,820
Speaker 1: you just have to be able to open a childproof pill case.

297
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:53,989
Speaker 0: You See my boy, right if you don't have a real job that is your primary work that you are doing.

298
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:55,033
Speaker 0: and then what you do.

299
00:16:55,053 --> 00:17:06,020
Speaker 0: then when you can have time to legislate if you're Working nine to five because you would also when the young people got in power We would put through the two months three months guaranteed vacation and you would use your vacation to govern.

300
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,749
Speaker 1: So governing only happens three months out of the year.

301
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,819
Speaker 0: if it's young people governing they could get all the governing done in a week.

302
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:17,807
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is what always bothers me like if I were the president of the United States, right They always take all this vacation.

303
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:18,751
Speaker 1: They relax a lot.

304
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:23,071
Speaker 1: I've got it most an Absolute most if everything goes perfectly.

305
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:31,421
Speaker 1: eight years in power Yeah, I would use every goddamn waking second of my life to call everybody on their bullshit 24/7.

306
00:17:31,421 --> 00:17:35,552
Speaker 0: you would be out of power Before you could take a vacation.

307
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:36,779
Speaker 1: I get at least four years.

308
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:40,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, they would impeach you just for being a jerk.

309
00:17:40,883 --> 00:17:45,612
Speaker 0: They could but I Congress as soon as you called the first person on their bullshit everyone.

310
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:49,769
Speaker 0: because how many people in the House of Representatives like 400 Johnson tried to do that.

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:50,613
Speaker 1: They called him on his.

312
00:17:50,674 --> 00:17:51,498

400
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,759
Speaker 1: Doing more poignant and real interviews than anyone in the so-called legitimate press or any of that bullshit, but I'll point out something else.

401
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,999
Speaker 1: Obama was given people shit at the UN and they talk about this here.

402

Speaker 1: He calls out North Korea for enslaving their population in Congo for raping people while they're in the audience listening to his speech.

403
00:22:50,801 --> 00:22:56,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he calls out Israel on the settlement issue and they're not even fucking there.

414
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:34,034
Speaker 0: I know and the luluv is the is the is the frond and you wave the frond and I guess you do something with the fruit And you basically you need to go eat dinner in this little hut in your backyard every night.

Speaker 0: It's totally chill, you know And that's the thing.

Speaker 0: So I'm not shitting you.

428
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,559

Speaker 1: now also along those lines We're gonna be doing way back.

471
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,960
Speaker 1: We did a PAX East survival guide because PAX East was new and this coming year this coming PAX East PAX Boston bitch packs.

472
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:48,229
Speaker 1: It is in an entire.

473
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,334
Speaker 0: It's not bitch packs.

474
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:50,299
Speaker 0: It's bitch in pay.

475
00:26:53,723 --> 00:26:57,657
Speaker 1: It is going to be in yet a different venue because the high knees is way too small.

476
00:26:57,677 --> 00:26:59,981
Speaker 0: this is going to be very Shaky.

477
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:07,040
Speaker 1: so we're going to do a an addendum to our packs a survival guide with updated survival info.

478
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:15,111
Speaker 0: Then you're going to need the survival info because let me tell you this PAX East will be Most dangerous gonna be off the hook most dangerous.

479
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:17,719
Speaker 0: It's you know, you know, you know, it's off the hook.

480
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,248
Speaker 1: Okay, I Don't know what you're going for.

481
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,098
Speaker 0: You don't want a hand when a phone gets off the hook.

482
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:25,340
Speaker 0: It goes.

483
00:27:26,165 --> 00:27:31,840
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, that's what.

484
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,520
Speaker 1: And last but not least by any stretch the New York Comic Con New York anime festival itself is next weekend October 8th 9th and 10th in New York City in the Jacob Gavin Center.

485
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:42,414
Speaker 1: We will be there on Friday night doing a panel from 7 15 to 8 15 p.m.

486
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:47,030
Speaker 1: Anime, you never thought you'd like in room 1 e 1 4.

487
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,590
Speaker 0: also the 10 10 10 burning wheel convention is the same three days but I think it's all filled up.

488
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,199
Speaker 0: so you can't go if you're not already going.

489
00:27:54,219 --> 00:28:00,100
Speaker 1: and Friday night October 8th is board game night and you will not be there, but you should be there.

490
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,339
Speaker 0: I can't think of anything else matter right now.

491
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,433
Speaker 1: So I feel like we should do the entire meta moment in that voice.

492
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,040
Speaker 0: every time I go machine guy doesn't met him.

493
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,612
Speaker 0: Oh my god, like twice micro machine metamoment.

494
00:28:12,753 --> 00:28:14,200
Speaker 1: That guy talks like twice as fast even us.

495
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:16,310
Speaker 0: He's like the most professional fast talk in the world.

496
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what he could.

497
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,480
Speaker 0: totally I don't know.

498
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,192
Speaker 0: But you know, he could do.

499
00:28:19,253 --> 00:28:19,660
Speaker 0: he's dead.

500
00:28:19,821 --> 00:28:22,071
Speaker 0: He could do with the awesomest axe cop cosplay.

501
00:28:22,112 --> 00:28:27,988
Speaker 0: now that I think about oh my god It would be the best axe cop Except maybe like Burt Reynolds or whatever.

502
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,698
Speaker 1: So the book club itself.

503
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,675
Speaker 0: Yes Do we want to talk about the next book club first or do you want to do that after?

504
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:37,265
Speaker 1: Ah, Maybe we should do that first.

505
00:28:37,766 --> 00:28:39,211
Speaker 1: It's a separate thing.

506
00:28:39,492 --> 00:28:40,013
Speaker 0: It's up to you.

507
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:40,896
Speaker 1: It's up to me.

508
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:40,976
Speaker 0: Yes.

509
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:42,040
Speaker 0: It's off to you.

510
00:28:42,342 --> 00:28:44,074
Speaker 1: Okay, I say it's up to you because it was up to me.

511
00:28:44,114 --> 00:28:44,860
Speaker 1: I can do whatever I like.

512
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,760
Speaker 0: Let's try doing the next book club before we do the book club.

513
00:28:47,884 --> 00:29:02,567
Speaker 0: All right and because that way I'm the way I'm thinking the reason I came up with that decision is because then maybe people haven't read the Current book that we're about to talk about, you know the golden apples of the Sun They can get the value out of this episode and just stop instead of having to fast forward If they want to know the next book club,

514
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:05,620
Speaker 1: so I just want to point out this book is all Scott

515
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:06,944
Speaker 0: This book is all me.

516
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:11,420
Speaker 0: All right, so basically, you know lately for the past two or so book clubs.

517
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:15,314
Speaker 0: I've been choosing books with the intent of getting the readers to read.

518
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,960
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm not picking them for me.

519
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,982
Speaker 0: I'm picking them for the people, you know I'm like.

520
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:20,308
Speaker 0: what book will get people to read?

521
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:27,438
Speaker 0: I pick Locke Lamora not because the greatest book in the world Because it was way fun and I'm like people will read something that is fun in fantasy.

522
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:27,980
Speaker 0: They're nerds.

523
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:29,647
Speaker 0: They'll read this, you know, I picked.

524
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:31,133
Speaker 0: what was the book I picked before that?

525
00:29:31,154 --> 00:29:32,459
Speaker 0: I don't remember but I picked something short.

526
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:35,688
Speaker 0: Cuz I was like, this is short.

527
00:29:35,768 --> 00:29:37,939
Speaker 0: they'll read it cuz it's easy and short, right?

528
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:49,883
Speaker 0: So this time I'm like people will read this book because it's such Fan service as in us serving the fans of geek nights or at least a particular portion of the page Still alive.

529
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:51,648
Speaker 1: Oh nice as far as I can tell.

530
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:59,660
Speaker 0: So anyway, this book also was recommended to us in by the Marco Sullivan in the vanilla interview.

531
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:08,653
Speaker 0: But anyway, the book is called World War Z an oral history of the zombie war By Max Brooks, who is the author of the zombie survival guide?

532
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:25,580
Speaker 0: It is a New York Times bestseller And let me tell you I predict that this book will not be so good Even though it is a bestseller and has all these quotes on it from New York Times Book Review and Onion AV Club and Entertainment Weekly and it's a bestseller and all this stuff, right?

533
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:30,976
Speaker 0: I don't I'm not have high expectations, but I'm not judging it cuz I haven't read it.

534
00:30:31,016 --> 00:30:32,937
Speaker 0: I'm just saying the expectations They are low.

535
00:30:33,521 --> 00:30:43,213
Speaker 0: but I think that because it is a zombie book and the zombies are so much loved by the fan base of geek nights and There is constantly asking us for a zombie episode and

536
00:30:43,253 --> 00:30:45,162
Speaker 1: they just never happening by the way They

537
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:48,060
Speaker 0: just can't deal, you know, they can't get enough of this shit.

538
00:30:48,301 --> 00:30:51,431
Speaker 0: Right that this book will be up their alley and you know what?

539
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:54,320
Speaker 0: It's not a sports page and it's not a magazine.

540
00:30:54,741 --> 00:31:02,267
Speaker 0: It's a book and you know what fucking book even though it might be I expect not a good book, you know They're gonna read a book.

541
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,276
Speaker 0: if they if they read this book, they'll be reading a book.

542
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:05,080
Speaker 0: So that's good.

543
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,759
Speaker 0: It's better than not reading a book.

544
00:31:07,121 --> 00:31:24,459
Speaker 0: So hopefully by going with the fan service route I can get the people to read a book and you know what also It sort of goes in line with the fact that more recently I've been you know Branching into the things I'm not good at like playing to Starcraft, you know, and that sort of thing try to do the genre I'm not good with right?

545
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:38,820
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna read the book that I probably would never want to read Almost ever just to show that I am NOT the knocker before trier Right, and then after this book, I think I'm gonna go back to just picking books that are actually good and actually like.

546
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:42,065
Speaker 0: And I'll give up on trying.

547
00:31:42,085 --> 00:31:50,566
Speaker 0: because the people I've tried three different methods to get people to read and if they have not become book Readers after the three methods or ever many methods I've tried They're not gonna.

548
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:53,020
Speaker 0: so I'm gonna go back to good books again after this one.

549
00:31:53,481 --> 00:32:03,635
Speaker 1: So I chose Ray Bradbury's golden apples of the Sun the book we're talking about now Primarily because I'd read some Ray Bradbury, but I hadn't read a lot.

550
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:04,337
Speaker 0: I read Fahrenheit 451.

551
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:05,982
Speaker 1: Yep That's pretty much it.

552
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:10,860
Speaker 1: I hadn't read a lot of his, you know short stories, especially these ultra short stories like Wario.

553
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,602
Speaker 1: We're stories.

554
00:32:11,943 --> 00:32:25,520
Speaker 1: Oh sweet, but I got the impression when I think about it and I look at what people say about science fiction authors I don't think many people Really are able to differentiate between Heinlein Asimov Bradbury all these different people.

555
00:32:26,102 --> 00:32:29,679
Speaker 1: I don't think a lot of people actually know that they had very different styles of writing.

556
00:32:30,642 --> 00:32:50,449
Speaker 0: Well, I mean cuz nobody reads enough, you know, very few people who aren't nerds read enough of all of them to sort of You know figure out the styles and compare them and contrast them, you know Cuz if you read just one book by someone You need to read like at least three or four books by one person to sort of see the commonalities to figure out What are the trademarks of their style except

557
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:50,690
Speaker 1: like.

558
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,700
Speaker 0: if you just see one Mamoru Oshii movie?

559
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,205
Speaker 0: How do you know that?

560
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,550
Speaker 0: that dog is a trend?

561
00:32:55,711 --> 00:32:56,072
Speaker 0: you don't?

562
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,116
Speaker 0: you don't know that.

563
00:32:57,197 --> 00:32:59,509
Speaker 0: but if you watch three You see the dog every time you go.

564
00:32:59,550 --> 00:32:59,993
Speaker 0: I got you.

565
00:33:00,073 --> 00:33:03,311
Speaker 0: Oh, she I see you I see what you did there the first prince of nothing book.

566
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:05,120
Speaker 1: You're like, alright really into rape.

567
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,583
Speaker 1: Second and third book.

568
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:06,904
Speaker 1: Yep.

569
00:33:06,964 --> 00:33:07,666
Speaker 1: That's a trend.

570
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:17,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, so if you just read like, you know one Asimov book one or even like if you read foundation trilogy, it could just been a foundation trilogy thing.

571
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:24,116
Speaker 0: You know if you just read, you know Toki and Lord of the Rings and you don't read is somewhere alien or a Tom Bombadil.

572
00:33:24,157 --> 00:33:27,633
Speaker 0: what the fuck you don't know What's a token thing and what's something he did in just that book.

573
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:33,113
Speaker 1: at the same time I could not Force myself to read the summer really and I tried I read it.

574
00:33:33,334 --> 00:33:36,745
Speaker 1: I just guy got bored Didn't care man.

00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:56,225
Speaker 1: I Was in like third grade.

00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,054
Speaker 0: it's too much poetries and shit.

582
00:33:58,235 --> 00:33:59,280
Speaker 1: Anyway, I like that stuff.

583
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, maybe we should do an animation club once and we'll watch the cartoon hobbit.

584
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:15,572
Speaker 1: No I'll read it first but golden apples of the Sun if you guys didn't know is From a Yeats poem not Keats from Hyperion Yeats.

585
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:16,375
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

586
00:34:16,436 --> 00:34:16,917
Speaker 0: I didn't even.

587
00:34:16,937 --> 00:34:17,478
Speaker 0: I don't even.

588
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,925
Speaker 0: okay You got to educate me about this.

589
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:19,186
Speaker 0: Really?

590
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:19,969
Speaker 1: You didn't know about Yeats.

591
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:24,404
Speaker 0: I knew the name Yeats, but actually I was like You would.

592
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:27,440
Speaker 0: if you would not have clarified just then I would have been like Oh Yeats from my.

593
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:38,757
Speaker 1: Wow, okay, so to be fair, I'm not nearly as culture we see friends with go with Yeah, they directed pessite show.

594
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,292
Speaker 1: Okay, so until about five years ago.

595
00:34:43,312 --> 00:34:46,748
Speaker 1: I heard every time I heard Yeats I thought oh you mean Keats.

596
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:53,121
Speaker 1: and every time I heard Keats I thought oh you mean Yeats and I thought they were the same person because they were kind of similar poetry With the East.

597
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:57,717
Speaker 1: but Yeats is probably one of my favorite poets ever.

598
00:34:57,817 --> 00:34:58,680
Speaker 1: just I really like eats.

599
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Speaker 1: You can learn all about Yeats if you want, but he has a poem a short poem.

600
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:05,289
Speaker 1: The last stanza of it reads though.

601
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:08,620
Speaker 1: I am old with wandering through hollow lands and hilly lands.

602
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:17,250
Speaker 1: I will find out where she has gone and kiss her lip and take her hands and walk along Among long dappled grass and plucked till time and times are done.

603
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,500
Speaker 1: the silver apples of the moon the golden apples of the Sun?

604
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:24,116
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it says golden apples of the Sun.

605
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:24,800
Speaker 1: that's how it ends.

606
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,081
Speaker 1: It's.

607
00:35:25,262 --> 00:35:35,892
Speaker 1: it's very relevant to the last story in the collection of short stories the golden apples of the Sun which Coincidentally is called the golden apples of the Sun Gasp, all right, so you wanna talk about that light.

608
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:37,120
Speaker 0: you want to go through the stories one.

609
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,108
Speaker 0: But actually I want to talk about one thing that's come.

610
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:40,273
Speaker 0: should we do that first or last?

611
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,425
Speaker 0: the things that are common among all The stories get all over the place.

612
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:46,255
Speaker 1: one thing that's what I like is the illustrations in the book.

613
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:47,500
Speaker 1: They're very stark.

614
00:35:47,861 --> 00:35:53,480
Speaker 0: Each story has exactly one illustration and they're pretty good because they sort of let you there at the beginning of the story.

615
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,340
Speaker 0: So you sort of know, you know, because the titles don't usually give away that much.

616
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:05,179
Speaker 0: but if you read the story then the title makes sense afterwards and So the picture at least gives you sort of some idea what that story is gonna be.

617
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:08,356
Speaker 0: You know what the setting is gonna be at least pictures just I don't know.

618
00:36:08,396 --> 00:36:09,080
Speaker 1: I like the style.

619
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:12,915
Speaker 1: They're very stark and thick lined and I don't they remind me of the kind of.

620
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:19,261
Speaker 0: it's the kind of thing that you can print In a cheap old paperback, yeah, I mean this thing originally came out in like 1953.

621
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:25,311
Speaker 1: well, it's old and it's a collection of all Alive, I mean, it's a collection of stories.

622
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,315
Speaker 1: He wrote in the 40s and 50s.

623
00:36:27,922 --> 00:36:34,267
Speaker 1: yeah, damn and it really puts it in perspective kind of like reading snow crash going Yeah, that was pretty crappy.

624
00:36:34,287 --> 00:36:36,275
Speaker 1: and then looking back and seeing what it was written and going.

625
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:43,611
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It's kind of the same way here like oh, yeah when you wrote this World War two Was happening.

626
00:36:43,631 --> 00:36:47,474
Speaker 0: yeah It was then recent memory.

627
00:36:47,595 --> 00:37:05,360
Speaker 0: at the same time Anyway, no The one thing that I noticed in all the stories the one common thing at least was this sort of literary technique He used at least if not in every story in many of them where he wouldn't explicitly Like set the setting or tell you the characters were anything like that.

628
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:11,900
Speaker 0: He would just sort of like there would be a scene and he would just start telling you the verbs like someone was doing something.

629
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:19,529
Speaker 0: And as they would do something and as they would interact you were able to easily unless you're retarded to figure out What was going on?

630
00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:19,832
Speaker 0: Right?

631
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:20,620
Speaker 0: Like there was a story.

632
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:26,872
Speaker 1: You know, they're like the pedestrian guys just walking guys walking looking in houses.

633
00:37:27,293 --> 00:37:28,836
Speaker 1: Everyone else is watching TV.

634
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:31,331
Speaker 1: I See where he's going.

635
00:37:31,837 --> 00:37:36,160
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, or there's the one with the the girls who?

636
00:37:36,923 --> 00:37:39,737
Speaker 0: Their their boyfriend like moved to Mars or whatever.

637
00:37:39,918 --> 00:37:40,380
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah

638
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:57,367
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so it's like they got a letter from the boyfriend and they read it and then they were like, oh You know and it's sort of like you were like, oh the boyfriend's on Mars He didn't say here he could have D could have summed up the whole story literally is These are there are these girls?

639
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,035
Speaker 0: their boyfriend moved to Mars.

640
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:00,140
Speaker 1: That's the whole story.

641
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:03,056
Speaker 1: The story of embroidery is worlds fucked old ladies.

642
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:03,639
Speaker 1: Wait for it.

643
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, old ladies are sitting on the porch embroidering and then nukes go off.

644
00:38:08,154 --> 00:38:08,977
Speaker 0: That's the whole story.

645
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:10,301
Speaker 0: That's all that happens Right.

646
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:15,600
Speaker 0: So how do you extend that to a good quality three or four page short story?

647
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,362
Speaker 0: And basically it.

648
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:17,547
Speaker 0: it he's basically like.

649
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,259
Speaker 0: he doesn't explicitly come out with.

650
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:23,520
Speaker 0: you know It's such the kind of bland language I would use because I can't write for shit.

651
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:32,944
Speaker 0: He's like, you know, he's like, you know, he's like this here's an old lady and she's talking, you know He just has the old ladies just start discussing things, you know And they're just talking to each other.

652
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:37,800
Speaker 1: that one in particular reminded me very much of hills like white elephants.

653
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,125
Speaker 0: What cells like white elephants?

654
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,531
Speaker 1: No, never mind then.

655
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:41,153
Speaker 0: Okay.

656
00:38:41,173 --> 00:38:47,339
Speaker 0: I Want to you know, at least talk about each story at least once a little bit, right?

657
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:48,485
Speaker 0: Well, let's do this.

658
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:50,860
Speaker 0: Which one did you think was the awesomest?

659
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:59,160
Speaker 1: See, it's tricky because I like some for the style and I like some not necessarily for the style or the story itself.

660
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,900
Speaker 1: But for the message of the story, all right.

661
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:12,860
Speaker 1: So why don't you you could give like the best in each cat straight up my the story that I think is the most Relevant or the one that I would probably use in arguments or quote at people the most.

662
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,153
Speaker 0: Oh the one that has the best message hands down is the flying machine.

663
00:39:16,173 --> 00:39:16,936
Speaker 0: I had to agree.

664
00:39:16,976 --> 00:39:17,740
Speaker 0: message wise.

665
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:24,688
Speaker 1: The Emperor is you know, he murders the guy and he's like, all right I've murdered the guy everything's safe.

666
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:25,872
Speaker 1: and then it's just like.

667
00:39:25,993 --> 00:39:27,820
Speaker 1: and then the Emperor regarded the birds.

668
00:39:28,362 --> 00:39:29,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's.

669
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,108
Speaker 1: it's like it doesn't?

670
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:31,112
Speaker 1: does the Emperor get it?

671
00:39:31,634 --> 00:39:33,080
Speaker 1: if he does or if he doesn't he's fucked.

672
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,119
Speaker 1: The Emperor might as well be the RIAA.

673
00:39:37,703 --> 00:39:44,857
Speaker 1: It's such a Perfect story and it's the fact that he wrote this 50 years ago and nobody has learned this lesson today.

674
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:45,940
Speaker 0: I know right.

675
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:49,776
Speaker 0: I mean basically the flying machine is about this this Emperor of China.

676
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:50,580
Speaker 1: You've all read the book.

677
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:51,025
Speaker 1: It's not like.

678
00:39:51,045 --> 00:39:52,440
Speaker 1: we need to explain to you what the stories are.

679
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:53,218
Speaker 0: Oh, hopefully yeah.

680
00:39:53,641 --> 00:40:00,547
Speaker 0: But the point, you know, the whole thing of this guy's invented a flying machine and he's like, oh my god The flying machine obsolete's my great wall.

681
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:04,660
Speaker 0: I need to make sure this technology doesn't get out because then my great wall is fucked.

682
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,765
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

683
00:40:05,785 --> 00:40:06,789
Speaker 0: so I'll kill the guy.

684
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,080
Speaker 0: I'll punish the guy who's using the flying technology.

685
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,654
Speaker 0: It's like dude, the flying technology is out of the bag.

686
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:12,680
Speaker 0: I hate the birds.

687
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:15,419
Speaker 0: Anyone can look at the birds and figure it out.

688
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:17,471
Speaker 0: Great wall is already fucked.

689
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:28,283
Speaker 1: the more deep message I think is simply that any truth can never be hidden because truth like truth about a fundamental universe is Fundamental truth.

690
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:29,286
Speaker 1: It's a tautology.

691
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:34,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it can be derived if it can be deduced it can be deduced It will be.

692
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:37,840
Speaker 0: yes, and you know, it's sort of weird because I'm on the Emperor's side, right?

693
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:45,286
Speaker 0: You can take it as sort of the message of the greater good message, which is like maybe even if you agree with that It's like okay.

694
00:40:45,447 --> 00:40:54,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if we should go for the greater good Right, what you should do is not kill the guy but use him to figure out a way to stop flying.

695
00:40:54,863 --> 00:41:04,535
Speaker 1: Take it from that like when that when back in the day we made PGP and encryption well GPG and all that Munitions and was illegal to export to certain countries.

696
00:41:04,635 --> 00:41:11,678
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Alright, you're saying that there's nobody smart on the bad guy side who can figure out math.

697
00:41:11,958 --> 00:41:21,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, right And it's like Okay, so I don't I won't send the actual software to Europe on a disk or anything But you know what?

698
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,520
Speaker 0: This professor called that professor on the phone and now he knows and they just wrote the same exact software.

699
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:29,180
Speaker 1: It's not like people can't figure it out.

700
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:34,623
Speaker 0: He just looked in the academic journal which is published freely around the world in terms of stories that I found Amusing.

701
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:41,011
Speaker 1: the first one the foghorn was the most amusing I think yeah In terms of just the physics because it had the Cthulhu feeling.

702
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:43,480
Speaker 0: in terms of just the physicality of what happened.

703
00:41:43,561 --> 00:41:43,683
Speaker 0: Right.

704
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:48,753
Speaker 0: I mean it had action, you know this freaking dinosaur comes from out in the bottom of the sea but it smashes lighthouse,

705
00:41:48,793 --> 00:42:00,139
Speaker 1: but it also felt very Cthulhu II and very Interesting and that the scene was very well set and very well described and all it was kind of funny of you know What the thing wants but also very poignant of how sad that is.

706
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you know, it's it's.

707
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:03,560
Speaker 0: it's like all messy.

708
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:15,308
Speaker 0: The One that I actually thought was the most sort of fun to read was the fruit at the bottom of the bowl Where this guy be basically right.

709
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:16,010
Speaker 0: you you.

710
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:19,000
Speaker 0: he does that same trick where he doesn't tell you exactly what happened.

711
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:26,815
Speaker 0: you sort of figure out that he murdered this dude, right and He's like super paranoid that he's left his fingerprints somewhere and he's got a doubly.

712
00:42:26,855 --> 00:42:28,320
Speaker 0: make sure he hadn't leave him somewhere.

713
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,400
Speaker 0: So he like goes around and he's like polishing the whole apart house like every single thing.

714
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,840
Speaker 1: I love how they do not say that he went into the Attic but yet at the end they found him in the Attic.

715
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right.

716
00:42:39,546 --> 00:42:44,192
Speaker 0: He's actually polishing every single thing in the whole house and he's like flashing back to.

717
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:48,439
Speaker 0: he's like that dude knew I was gonna kill him and he Tricked me into touching everything in his house.

718
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:50,323
Speaker 0: And is it like?

719
00:42:50,384 --> 00:42:50,986
Speaker 0: it shows you.

720
00:42:51,006 --> 00:42:59,657
Speaker 0: you know how this guy not only murdered someone but was so Crazy in his mind and you know and so obsessive that he had to like cover up this murder.

721
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:02,540
Speaker 0: and it took him so long To cover it up that he got caught in the morning.

722
00:43:03,084 --> 00:43:05,400
Speaker 1: If he obsessed over that he must have obsessed over others.

723
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,447
Speaker 1: Obsessive kind of personalities Really say it wasn't science fiction.

724
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:13,913
Speaker 1: It was just a really interesting vignette.

725
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:15,540
Speaker 0: No, not all of these were science fiction.

726
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,840
Speaker 0: I don't think he claims that all of them were science fiction either.

727
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:21,636
Speaker 1: I mean the one with the witch and the invisible boy was really funny.

728
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:24,272
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah That was just sort of like a fable almost.

729
00:43:24,453 --> 00:43:29,040
Speaker 0: Yeah of like Was she actually trying to trick him to eat him or not?

730
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,180
Speaker 0: It's like I couldn't you know, or did she really just want his company?

731
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:33,112
Speaker 1: I think she was just a lonely old lady.

732
00:43:33,273 --> 00:43:34,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's lonely old lady.

733
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:42,435
Speaker 0: She tricked this boy into thinking he was invisible to keep him around Right, but then eventually like the invisible boy started, you know, he got.

734
00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:44,200
Speaker 0: he was fooling around with his invisibility.

735
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,284
Speaker 0: She couldn't take it anymore.

736
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:47,893
Speaker 0: So she got rid of him and then she was lonely again.

737
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:49,760
Speaker 1: the April which one was really cute.

738
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:51,668
Speaker 0: I don't know how cute that was.

739
00:43:51,728 --> 00:43:52,953
Speaker 1: I it was me.

740
00:43:52,973 --> 00:43:54,540
Speaker 1: I mean it entered a little message.

741
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,022
Speaker 1: It wasn't.

742
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,473
Speaker 1: it was the departure from the rest of the stories.

743
00:43:57,513 --> 00:43:59,020
Speaker 0: The other one was more whimsical.

744
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:02,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one where What's it called?

745
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:10,032
Speaker 0: Cuz they were weren't there - there was the one where the April which is where she like possesses someone to learn about.

746
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:10,514
Speaker 0: right.

747
00:44:10,554 --> 00:44:15,549
Speaker 0: like cuz she wants to fall in love with some Makes them fall in love and you can talk about.

748
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:18,540
Speaker 1: oh, it's springtime, you know 5th of May.

749
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:24,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then the great fire right that one that one was about getting it on That one was about getting it on right.

750
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:25,530
Speaker 0: is these people?

751
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,919
Speaker 0: they really wanted to get this girl out of the house.

752
00:44:28,422 --> 00:44:31,055
Speaker 0: So, you know, they're like, oh she's got a boyfriend.

753
00:44:31,095 --> 00:44:32,020
Speaker 0: Hopefully they'll get married.

754
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:32,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully.

755
00:44:33,082 --> 00:44:39,658
Speaker 0: but they didn't want to interfere because they might ruin it or embarrass her or something and they failed to notice that she was Getting on with like every boy in town.

756
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:54,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, and only grandma knew what was up because grandma actually went out on the porch and was like saying hi The dinosaur one was not particularly good, but it gets points for being kind of dumb in a fun way.

757
00:44:54,157 --> 00:44:59,283
Speaker 0: the time Safari Forget the time Safari that was just sort of Reading.

758
00:44:59,343 --> 00:45:00,692
Speaker 1: I was like really really?

759
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:03,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it was so You know.

760
00:45:03,043 --> 00:45:06,621
Speaker 0: and then the fact that you know, okay, they they they they messed up history They can't.

761
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:12,189
Speaker 0: I like how the guy came to the few asshole and when they came to the future all they change was like the Political result.

762
00:45:12,249 --> 00:45:17,739
Speaker 1: It's like really The other guy with him is like you fucking asshole.

763
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:22,071
Speaker 0: They were so upset about which guy became president.

764
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:23,798
Speaker 1: Well, there's a bad guy.

765
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:25,670
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually, you know the one.

766
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:26,540
Speaker 0: you know the goal.

767
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,417
Speaker 1: I figured the one you would like the most would be the one about the guy who didn't like to watch TV.

768
00:45:30,658 --> 00:45:34,300
Speaker 0: that yeah I mean that one and just in terms of having something relevant was the TV one.

769
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,400
Speaker 0: But it wasn't really that as good as like say the one that reminded me a civilization the Golden Kite in the Silver Wind.

770
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:42,592
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was me.

771
00:45:42,712 --> 00:45:44,100
Speaker 1: I thought it was gonna be more complex.

772
00:45:44,421 --> 00:45:48,840
Speaker 1: I thought that it was a trick by the advisor to get the one nation to keep rebuilding.

773
00:45:49,001 --> 00:45:50,004
Speaker 0: I thought so too.

774
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:54,220
Speaker 1: retired then they'd invade or it'd be like you must make a wall like the wind.

775
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:58,964
Speaker 1: Because then blah blah blah and then as soon as there's no wall cuz it's like the wind Invasion.

776
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:00,795
Speaker 1: and the fact that that didn't happen took me aback.

777
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:09,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know right I thought it was gonna be one of those trick ones where a guy, you know But instead it was pretty much I made a wall and then you're beat up made a wall to beat my wall.

778
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,792
Speaker 0: Then I you know, those rock-paper-scissors back and forth until they cooperated.

779
00:46:12,973 --> 00:46:14,379
Speaker 0: so it's sort of a prisoner's dilemma.

780
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the moral was assholes.

781
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,296
Speaker 1: if you both write Apple, we're all better off.

782
00:46:19,336 --> 00:46:19,998
Speaker 1: You've read orange.

783
00:46:20,018 --> 00:46:20,480
Speaker 1: We're fucked.

784
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:22,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it cuz that's true.

785
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:24,231
Speaker 0: yeah, and it's pretty much they would.

786
00:46:24,452 --> 00:46:30,819
Speaker 0: one guy would write orange then the other guy right orange again Orange at the bottom of the bowl.

787
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,591
Speaker 1: So, you know why I always use the Apple orange analogy?

788
00:46:33,611 --> 00:46:33,933
Speaker 1: because there's.

789
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:35,600
Speaker 1: there are probably better analogies.

790
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:38,451
Speaker 1: I use that one because that analogy was used in.

791
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:39,515
Speaker 1: I'll choose your own adventure.

792
00:46:39,595 --> 00:46:45,620
Speaker 1: I read in like second grade And that taught me the prisoner's dilemma and that started me on the long road to game there.

793
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:53,068
Speaker 1: I remember when I started reading game theory right like in high school and then at RIT when I got that scary book of game Theory, it was like prisoner's dilemma.

794
00:46:53,088 --> 00:46:54,494
Speaker 1: I was reading and I was like, wait a minute.

795
00:46:55,237 --> 00:46:55,819
Speaker 0: I know this.

796
00:46:56,841 --> 00:47:01,240
Speaker 0: Actually, you know to continue those one story that I sort of disagreed with the message, right?

797
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,635
Speaker 0: The pedestrian was about the guy who didn't watch TV.

798
00:47:04,675 --> 00:47:04,896
Speaker 0: He would.

799
00:47:04,936 --> 00:47:05,720
Speaker 0: he just walked around.

800
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,849
Speaker 1: Oh, I know exactly what you hear.

801
00:47:07,889 --> 00:47:10,159
Speaker 0: pieces, right and everyone else watched TV.

802
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,720
Speaker 0: So he got like arrested for being you know, totally fucked up by the one automatic police car.

803
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,747
Speaker 0: But the murderer was the.

804
00:47:16,848 --> 00:47:22,672
Speaker 0: what was about this guy who just couldn't stand all this technology Everywhere like making noise and he just wanted to see.

805
00:47:22,852 --> 00:47:24,480
Speaker 1: I do agree with the message of that one.

806
00:47:24,903 --> 00:47:27,160
Speaker 1: I do not know because I think you misunderstand the message.

807
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,733
Speaker 1: Here's what I got out of it that guy his Luddite bullshit is crazy.

808
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:33,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he is the bad guy of that story.

809
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:38,009
Speaker 0: Here's my rationale, I think it's not definitely.

810
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:46,659
Speaker 1: I definitely think Ray Bradbury is the kind of guy who would be like No, but at the same time my rationale is the up for this at least my reading of it now.

811
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,076
Speaker 0: What's weird is they wrote this in what year cell phones weren't even on the chart.

812
00:47:51,497 --> 00:47:52,260
Speaker 1: I know this is great.

813
00:47:52,321 --> 00:47:53,760
Speaker 1: Bradbury was a very intelligent.

814
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:54,884
Speaker 1: Well is a very intelligent.

815
00:47:54,985 --> 00:48:00,008
Speaker 0: you think that someone wrote this to complain like an old man wrote this recently to complain about cell phones And I pods and show.

816
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:01,460
Speaker 1: you might as well be complaining about Twitter.

817
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:07,783
Speaker 1: I could probably change some proper nouns and you would not even be able to know that was written, you know Plus years ago.

818
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:08,528
Speaker 0: Yeah 60 years ago.

819
00:48:08,548 --> 00:48:08,870
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

820
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:30,523
Speaker 1: Yeah but the way I read it whether or not Ray Bradbury intended it because if you ignore what his intent may or may not have been and read it it is easy to read this as this dissatisfied guy and the people who identify with him are the ones who haven't adjusted and everyone else has adjusted and is using this technology to their advantage and they just think this guy's crazy because He is crazy.

821
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:31,487
Speaker 0: I don't know.

822
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:36,860
Speaker 0: I tend you know, what I think it is is that in almost any sci-fi Twilight Zone anything like that, right?

823
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:46,043
Speaker 0: You generally have this sort of Society and then you have the one guy and the one guy is always the thing that's right in society is always crazy Right.

824
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:46,425
Speaker 0: It's all.

825
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,371
Speaker 0: it's never there.

826
00:48:47,431 --> 00:48:48,135
Speaker 0: It's almost never.

827
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,940
Speaker 0: the reverse of that You know, it's like look at like brave new world.

828
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,300
Speaker 0: The one guy is like, all right, this brave new world is crazy and everyone else is like odd drugs and feelings.

829
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:57,602
Speaker 0: Fuck yeah You know.

830
00:48:57,662 --> 00:49:04,107
Speaker 0: and it's like you look at like a Twilight Zone and it's like this one guy and then the whole world Explodes except for him of course.

831
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:06,155
Speaker 0: then his glasses break the burbs.

832
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:12,245
Speaker 1: if you ignore the you know Just I watched it again recently if you ignore the last like 30 seconds of the movie is The same kind of thing.

833
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:15,182
Speaker 1: the one guy know that one guy is just crazy Okay.

834
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just seems.

835
00:49:16,326 --> 00:49:18,794
Speaker 0: usually in the vast majority of sci-fi if there's so.

836
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:25,278
Speaker 0: if there's one guy, you know Just like in Jeff Jeff Goldblum pedestrian then he's right.

837
00:49:26,202 --> 00:49:36,340
Speaker 0: You know like in the second story the pedestrian right the pedestrian is the guy who knows what's up and all the other people in Society are the ones who are not good, you know, they always portray society.

838
00:49:36,822 --> 00:49:42,660
Speaker 0: They always put the evil thing or the bad thing onto society and they put the good thing onto the one protagonist character.

839
00:49:43,302 --> 00:49:43,744
Speaker 0: They never.

840
00:49:43,965 --> 00:49:51,600
Speaker 0: they never put the bad things on the protagonist character and the good things on well I guess actually in the murderer they put the good things on this side.

841
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:56,695
Speaker 1: I guess I just saw the story the murderer as being a little more even in the sides.

842
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:58,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't you know.

843
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:07,989
Speaker 0: The thing is mostly because the adjectives that they use to describe all the beeping and the buzzing wristwatches and the machines that were Generally negative and annoying.

844
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,346
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but at the same time No, they didn't spend.

845
00:50:11,366 --> 00:50:14,120
Speaker 0: he didn't spend a lot of time talking about how these things were helping people.

846
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,011
Speaker 0: They spent a lot of time discussing how they were annoying and bother.

847
00:50:17,031 --> 00:50:22,008
Speaker 1: if you read it from a transhumanist perspective Reading that made us feel annoyed.

848
00:50:22,028 --> 00:50:24,115
Speaker 1: It made me feel really annoyed at these talking things.

849
00:50:24,215 --> 00:50:27,208
Speaker 1: I probably would have smashed him, too Because I don't need help.

850
00:50:27,228 --> 00:50:28,395
Speaker 1: we have better ways of doing that.

851
00:50:28,415 --> 00:50:30,082
Speaker 1: I have my phone Yeah the screen.

852
00:50:30,383 --> 00:50:41,739
Speaker 1: but it's more the idea that if you read it from a transhumanist perspective that guy harkens back to our era and People from our era would not deal well with the future era with all these different ways.

853
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,767
Speaker 1: You know this totally different societal framework Maybe and I guess I can.

854
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,900
Speaker 1: the fact that the professor is looking at this guy like wow, he's crazy.

855
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:53,680
Speaker 1: He walks out picks up a new phone a real new thingy and just continues his business like yeah, like whatever.

856
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,448
Speaker 1: I don't care.

857
00:50:54,811 --> 00:50:56,182
Speaker 1: I'll ignore that guy I may.

858
00:50:56,282 --> 00:50:57,065
Speaker 0: actually there was one.

859
00:50:57,086 --> 00:50:59,134
Speaker 0: were there any ones like you just didn't get.

860
00:50:59,154 --> 00:51:01,227
Speaker 0: you were just like because it was one for me That I was just like.

861
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,379
Speaker 1: well golden apples of the Sun.

862
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:05,650
Speaker 0: No, no, no, the one that I was just like wah was the.

863
00:51:06,011 --> 00:51:07,556
Speaker 0: it was the powerhouse one.

864
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:09,223
Speaker 1: I don't know I don't have anything.

865
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:11,190
Speaker 1: I don't remember much about that.

866
00:51:11,311 --> 00:51:11,793
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

867
00:51:11,833 --> 00:51:13,460
Speaker 0: It's like cuz basically the whole story.

868
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:14,367
Speaker 1: I got the book here.

869
00:51:14,387 --> 00:51:15,940
Speaker 1: Let me see if I can jog my memory.

870
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,466
Speaker 0: Basically, they went and they stay wet.

871
00:51:17,546 --> 00:51:20,960
Speaker 0: there was this powerhouse and I thought it was gonna be about getting electrocuted or some shit.

872
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:26,059
Speaker 0: Basically, it was like they they were traveling and they spent a night in this electrical building.

873
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,480
Speaker 1: All right This was a long one.

874
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,900
Speaker 0: It was like five pages and then they left and then she was like, oh, can we come and spend a night here again?

875
00:51:32,341 --> 00:51:38,627
Speaker 1: okay, the best I got out of it was that maybe Demystification makes people less afraid of things.

876
00:51:38,647 --> 00:51:40,595
Speaker 0: It didn't seem like they were afraid.

877
00:51:40,615 --> 00:51:41,498
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

878
00:51:42,361 --> 00:51:43,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just did I read this thing.

879
00:51:43,887 --> 00:51:43,968
Speaker 1: is?

880
00:51:44,028 --> 00:51:49,580
Speaker 1: I read this whole compilation a long time ago So I'm trying to remember details of that story.

881
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:51,145
Speaker 0: I didn't get it.

882
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:51,868
Speaker 0: I don't know.

883
00:51:51,888 --> 00:51:53,232
Speaker 0: Maybe someone can I got all the other ones.

884
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:53,895
Speaker 1: I'll read it again.

885
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:54,155
Speaker 0: Yeah.

886
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,967
Speaker 0: Oh You know, which one was was fun.

887
00:51:57,008 --> 00:51:58,998
Speaker 0: was the the meadow right where the guy?

888
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:00,720
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I really like that one.

889
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,497
Speaker 0: He's trying to save the movie sets from being torn down and about again Ray Bradbury.

890
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:05,140
Speaker 1: It wasn't obvious.

891
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:06,319
Speaker 1: It was movie sets right away.

892
00:52:06,601 --> 00:52:13,163
Speaker 0: No, of course not right but what was really cool was that it's sort of that thing happens that you always want to happen But never does.

893
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:25,565
Speaker 0: in any other story where he basically gets the producer over He actually shows up the producer actually goes and talks to him and the producers actually a reasonable guy and then he's like, okay Well, we'll make good here.

894
00:52:25,987 --> 00:52:29,440
Speaker 1: and they did plus that a good picture with the Dragons and him kind of as the night.

895
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,065
Speaker 1: Look at this picture.

896
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:30,711
Speaker 1: That's a good picture.

897
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:31,276
Speaker 0: I know right.

898
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:31,780
Speaker 0: It's a high quality.

899
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:34,774
Speaker 1: I think it's it's my one of my favorite pictures from the book.

900
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:42,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely One of the better stories in there, I think in terms of you know, just enjoyment and something I'll remember too.

901
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,719
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know if I'll remember the powerhouse.

902
00:52:47,944 --> 00:52:49,440
Speaker 0: What about the baseball one?

903
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,240
Speaker 1: I really like to but it was just a good short story the bit the the baseball one the big black-and-white game.

904
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:56,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, red.

905
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:58,760
Speaker 1: I feel like that's the kind of thing if I was in like fourth grade.

906
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:00,794
Speaker 1: We'd read in class and then talk about.

907
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:06,830
Speaker 0: you should read America gods gold and golems by James Sturm.

908
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:08,476
Speaker 1: Ah, that sounds up my alley.

909
00:53:08,757 --> 00:53:09,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a comic.

910
00:53:10,342 --> 00:53:11,286
Speaker 0: That was the guy I went.

911
00:53:11,367 --> 00:53:15,372
Speaker 0: I bought his market day comic the new the newer one He came out with at the mocha.

912

Speaker 0: He was there remember?

913
00:53:18,323 --> 00:53:21,494
Speaker 1: I was about to say yeah, but then I realized I was remembering something completely different.

914
00:53:21,614 --> 00:53:22,096
Speaker 0: All right.

915
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:24,023
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah He's any.

Speaker 0: if a comic book says James Sturm on it.

917
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:27,360

918
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,324
Speaker 0: You're gonna see you.

919
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:29,247

920
00:53:29,328 --> 00:53:37,035
Speaker 1: the one about letter writing via the great wide world over There is so desperately relevant to old people dealing with the internet today.

921
00:53:37,055 --> 00:53:38,440
Speaker 0: Oh god fuck.

922
00:53:39,563 --> 00:53:41,620
Speaker 1: Like to a degree that was startling.

923
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:42,965
Speaker 0: Well, it's not just old people.

924
00:53:43,005 --> 00:53:46,299
Speaker 0: the internet right and you could take that as a metaphor for so many things.

925
00:53:46,359 --> 00:53:46,620
Speaker 0: today.

926
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,302
Speaker 0: We're just people being behind the times or people being uneducated and unable to you know Get with it.

927
00:53:52,503 --> 00:53:56,860
Speaker 0: or people just being separated from the world as the world passes them by.

Speaker 0: Or you know.

929
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:01,730
Speaker 0: and it's not just you know That's only the stories you get.

930
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:05,459
Speaker 0: if you look at the main character the wife I don't even remember her name, of course, right?

931
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:16,600
Speaker 0: But if you look at say the husband who's just like I who needs that shit, right people who don't even wanna Get with the time Yeah, the wife was the hero for at least wanting to get it and for understanding the other old lady.

932
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,669
Speaker 0: Yes, and it was making it and we're the visiting nephews, right?

Speaker 1: who notice what is what's the biggest problems we have today?

938
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:37,812
Speaker 1: old people click on spam and listen to telemarketers Because they're lonely oftentimes and look at what she does she gets.

939
00:54:37,872 --> 00:54:40,220
Speaker 1: she asks for spam just so she has something to read.

940
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:41,022
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

941
00:54:41,062 --> 00:54:45,355

Speaker 0: she knows she's not literate But she's pretending to be right just so she can pretend.

944
00:54:50,436 --> 00:54:57,018
Speaker 0: she's with the times To say she can feel like she's better than other people and she'll have something to talk about with the next-door neighbor.

945
00:54:57,058 --> 00:55:05,271
Speaker 1: that story though Reminded me how optimistic I am about not necessarily our whole generation But us like you and me and all the people like us.

946
00:55:05,351 --> 00:55:11,112
Speaker 1: when we're gonna old, you know, 70s 80s, maybe 90s retiring I'll never be bored.

947
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:18,105
Speaker 0: when I'm an old man I'll never tell no at the very least right even if I'm grouchy and I hate everything new in the world and I think it's for the devil.

948
00:55:18,125 --> 00:55:30,300
Speaker 0: I still have the hundred two hundred years worth of entertainment media that I have consumed only a small portion of so I could just read comics and Watch movies and and play video games until I'm dead.

949
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:42,040
Speaker 1: Yeah and if I can't play the video games anymore at all and I have to go to like board games or get like robot thing is Ones that take the longest are the ones that need the least manual dexterity like JRPGs and shit.

00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,063
Speaker 0: Are you shiny?

962
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,200
Speaker 0: All right, let's let's talk about the the garbage collector right if you're the garbage collector, right?

963
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:27,340
Speaker 0: I like this story because it in one way it showed like how you can have You know sort of a regular old job like collecting garbage and find some joy and awesomeness in it.

964
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:34,412
Speaker 0: It's sort of just like office space right just be a construction worker, and there are some days I feel like that and then I remember I need rent, and you know those jobs.

965
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:43,740
Speaker 0: Don't pay as much yeah, but anyway At the same time though it brings into this dilemma of you know what if you know suddenly your job?

966
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:45,349
Speaker 0: Isn't what you signed up for?

967
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:47,380
Speaker 1: well that happens to a lot of people.

968
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:53,472
Speaker 1: I mean look at in Vietnam a lot of people who thought they were fighting of war worth fighting And then they ended up you know doing the like.

969
00:56:53,553 --> 00:56:56,880
Speaker 0: I didn't sign up for this shit Yeah, so what do you like?

970
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:59,792
Speaker 0: What would you do if suddenly your work wasn't you say what you signed up for?

971
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:01,740
Speaker 0: would you quit and go away like the garbage?

972
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,219
Speaker 0: Man, or would you get used to the idea?

973
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:12,780
Speaker 1: Well, there's a third way of going with it and trying to change it from within Which usually is a cop-out because usually people who say they're gonna do that never do that or they fail to do that.

974
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:13,363
Speaker 1: I play.

975
00:57:13,383 --> 00:57:14,450
Speaker 1: there's a choose your own adventure.

976
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,919
Speaker 1: You're in a Wild West long time ago.

977
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,600
Speaker 0: Why choose your adventures coming up a lot here?

978
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:23,320
Speaker 1: And there's a bandit gang and there are three choices with the bandit gang one fight the bandits run away.

979
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,603
Speaker 0: Join the bandits.

980
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:25,486
Speaker 1: fight the bandits.

981
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:33,396
Speaker 1: join the bandits for real join the bandits and pretend to be with them and then to betray them later Uh-huh, and if you join them for real you die, okay?

982
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:38,920
Speaker 1: But if you join them and pretend you totally win, okay, at least I think I don't really remember that.

983
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,129
Speaker 0: What if you just try to fight them?

984
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:46,843
Speaker 1: I think you die there, too Yeah, but no I I Don't know.

985
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:48,700
Speaker 1: I've never been in a situation.

986
00:57:48,800 --> 00:58:02,037
Speaker 1: Well, the closest I got was when I worked for a company I worked for before I got to the company I work for now obviously not naming any names here I took moral issue with what I thought that company was doing and I fucking quit.

987
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:04,367
Speaker 0: right quick All right, how about that?

988
00:58:04,487 --> 00:58:08,162
Speaker 1: In fact, I quit finger held high blaze of glory Nice.

989
00:58:08,543 --> 00:58:09,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, so all right.

990
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:10,150
Speaker 0: Let's see.

991
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:10,812
Speaker 0: Let me go down the list.

992
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:11,455
Speaker 0: Make sure we didn't.

993
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:14,185
Speaker 1: I think I've talked about everything That really I did.

994
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:17,456
Speaker 1: like the embroidery one is that was just very just.

995
00:58:18,399 --> 00:58:18,660
Speaker 1: I don't know.

996
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:23,621
Speaker 1: That story was very touching in a way that the rest of them weren't and I was really kind of sad after reading that One.

997
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,354
Speaker 0: let's let's just cover the last few.

998
00:58:25,374 --> 00:58:26,200
Speaker 0: we didn't discuss, right?

999
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,972
Speaker 0: So the Sun in shadow was the one where they're like.

1000
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:29,902
Speaker 0: don't take your photos here Right.

1001
00:58:30,224 --> 00:58:35,340
Speaker 0: and on the one hand it was sort of like, all right I think the people should be able to take photos over the hell they want.

1002
00:58:36,421 --> 00:58:37,928
Speaker 1: See that goddamn note.

1003
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:40,800
Speaker 1: like when I took my bike over the RFK the triborough bridge.

1004
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:43,409
Speaker 1: It was like no photos for will prosecute.

1005
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:44,011
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1006
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:46,460
Speaker 1: So, of course, I took pictures of that and videos all over the place.

1007
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:48,620
Speaker 0: Of course, I mean I have no problem taking photos.

1008
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,536
Speaker 0: But the thing was is I sort of agreed with the.

1009
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:55,193
Speaker 0: you know That this guy wasn't upset with the actual act of photo taking.

1010
00:58:55,234 --> 00:58:56,660
Speaker 0: he was upset with that.

1011
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,057
Speaker 0: The fact that they were taking photos there showed their attitude towards him and his neighborhood and his neighbors.

1012
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,467
Speaker 0: and you know And I was sort of like yeah, you're right.

1013
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,139
Speaker 0: That guy does have the wrong, you know, he's treating you.

1014
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:12,900
Speaker 0: He's treating these people like they're you know a set piece as opposed to treat it.

1015
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,659
Speaker 0: You know, he's not thinking of them as human beings.

1016
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:18,020
Speaker 0: But at the same time he's like, oh look at these quaint villagers.

1017
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:23,097
Speaker 0: They will make an awesome photo background next to my you know, fashion model at the same time.

1018
00:59:23,117 --> 00:59:25,544
Speaker 1: I mean, that's our world now I know right.

1019
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:29,360
Speaker 0: It's like while I'm for taking photos over the hell you want, right?

1020
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:30,444
Speaker 0: I'm you know, it is sort of.

1021
00:59:30,564 --> 00:59:34,060
Speaker 0: I am against that attitude of looking at people as if they are.

1022
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:38,119
Speaker 0: You know not people as if they are, you know set pieces or whatnot.

1023
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:39,606
Speaker 0: And that was alright.

1024
00:59:40,129 --> 00:59:42,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course we can solve that problem.

1025
00:59:42,701 --> 00:59:48,418
Speaker 1: If Google at least the direct problem, they won't know we're taking pictures about pictures of them because Google takes them from space.

1026
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:54,209
Speaker 0: Yep Let's see, oh there was the one where the boy doesn't age.

1027
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,522
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you never read everlasting talk Did you know?

1028
00:59:57,602 --> 01:00:03,299
Speaker 0: but it reminded me of that that recent movie with the the guy who ages backwards the?

1029
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,572
Speaker 0: the one with Robin Williams The I don't very recent one.

1030
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:10,940
Speaker 1: I don't think I saw this movie.

1031
01:00:11,101 --> 01:00:11,663
Speaker 0: I saw it.

1032
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:15,020
Speaker 0: It was it was like popular for for like a couple weeks.

1033
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:19,863
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about everlasting talk, which is a story about a family that just doesn't age Mm-hmm.

1034
01:00:20,725 --> 01:00:29,682
Speaker 0: It was the night was a movie that was also based in a short story and it basically the beginning was full of Excitement, but then the end of the movie was sort of like a bleh Whatever.

1035
01:00:29,702 --> 01:00:31,310
Speaker 0: Oh, I can't I remember the name of this thing.

1036
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,500
Speaker 0: Someone in the form is definitely gonna know it immediately.

1037
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

1038
01:00:35,686 --> 01:00:38,240
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I don't have much else to say other than that.

1039
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,632
Speaker 1: I hope you guys enjoyed this collection of short stories.

1040
01:00:40,652 --> 01:00:42,340
Speaker 0: Well, what about golden apples of the Sun itself?

1041
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,158
Speaker 0: I don't know that one didn't.

1042
01:00:45,661 --> 01:00:47,629
Speaker 1: It didn't strike me other than that.

1043
01:00:47,729 --> 01:00:49,094
Speaker 1: I like the way it was written.

1044
01:00:49,315 --> 01:00:50,460
Speaker 0: really you didn't like.

1045
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:54,679
Speaker 1: I really enjoyed the way it was written and I got a really powerful feeling from it.

1046
01:00:55,342 --> 01:00:57,047
Speaker 0: Oh, I got this really strong message of.

1047
01:00:57,108 --> 01:01:00,740
Speaker 0: it's like you want to do something so awesome, right?

1048
01:01:01,101 --> 01:01:02,900
Speaker 0: It's like you got to put everything on the line.

1049
01:01:03,021 --> 01:01:05,276
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like it was like climbing Mount Everest.

1050
01:01:05,376 --> 01:01:10,040
Speaker 1: almost, you know Same kind of all I can think reading it was we're heading off to Iskandar, right?

1051
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,132
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you know, you're you're climbing Mount Everest.

1052
01:01:13,193 --> 01:01:15,000
Speaker 0: if someone dies you leave them there, you know.

1053
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,595
Speaker 0: You know, there's gonna be dangerous shit, but you know what you have.

1054
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:18,078
Speaker 0: I can do it.

1055
01:01:18,561 --> 01:01:20,273
Speaker 0: You know and like the.

1056
01:01:20,374 --> 01:01:26,660
Speaker 0: it was so awesome Like the one really clever thing where it's like they're going to the Sun to get a scoop of the Sun, right?

1057
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:28,086
Speaker 0: And they go there.

1058
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:30,460
Speaker 0: So of course, they have a spaceship that's wicked cold.

1059
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,969
Speaker 0: They have this ultra cold ship and then there's.

1060
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,860
Speaker 0: so they're in this ultra cold spaceship and the spaceship is ultra cold.

1061
01:01:36,181 --> 01:01:39,480
Speaker 0: So they can survive the Sun but they need to survive in the ultra cold.

1062
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,893
Speaker 0: So they've got protective suits to protect from the cold because they can do that.

1063
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,640
Speaker 0: They can insult they can insulate from that.

1064
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:54,750
Speaker 0: You know, of course, it's not realistic, duh, but whatever right and then the sky suit breaks and he dies from the cold When he's on the Sun.

1065
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:56,419
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, that's so awesome.

1066
01:01:56,861 --> 01:02:00,576
Speaker 1: I guess the part I liked about that story was the whole we're going south.

1067
01:02:00,636 --> 01:02:01,359
Speaker 1: We're going north.

1068
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,913
Speaker 1: Thing I just said the captain is like where are we going north?

1069
01:02:06,575 --> 01:02:07,920
Speaker 1: and all the things like what time is it?

1070
01:02:09,324 --> 01:02:15,172
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is if he was from the southern hemisphere, you'd have to reverse Yeah those directions, but at the same time it was coach like north.

1071
01:02:15,353 --> 01:02:17,100
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter which direction you're going.

1072
01:02:17,724 --> 01:02:19,820
Speaker 0: Well, I mean you're going towards the Sun or away from it.

1073
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

1074
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:27,140
Speaker 1: but no but think about the metaphor towards the Sun converges on a place you can be a destination that is a real destination by.

1075
01:02:27,501 --> 01:02:29,168
Speaker 1: If that is south then north.

1076
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,340
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter which direction you're going because there's no destination.

1077
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,415
Speaker 1: It's every direction everywhere, but here is north.

1078
01:02:35,776 --> 01:02:37,722
Speaker 0: Yep That's cool.

1079
01:02:38,324 --> 01:02:39,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just that's a vibe.

1080
01:02:39,729 --> 01:02:40,693
Speaker 1: I like it when I used to.

1081
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,600
Speaker 0: I also like the idea of fucking scooping the Sun.

1082
01:02:44,286 --> 01:02:52,339
Speaker 1: We know you can't do that But like it's the thing I used to do when I was a kid is I would get in my bike and I would pick A direction and I would go as far in that direction as I possibly could.

1083
01:02:52,359 --> 01:03:00,555
Speaker 0: well At the North Pole everywhere you go is out, you know, yeah as you spin in a circle Yeah, or you take one step south and now you can turn around and go back north.

1084
01:03:00,856 --> 01:03:01,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, East and West again.

1085
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:11,002
Speaker 1: so but I would literally pick a direction because far as I could in that direction and Eventually, I had gone as far as I could in every direction short of running away from home Coming I

1086
01:03:11,022 --> 01:03:13,613
Speaker 0: was gonna say really how's that Pacific Ocean different point

1087
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:14,839
Speaker 1: as in like I'd bike.

1088
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,067
Speaker 1: All right I'm 40 miles away from my house.

1089
01:03:17,308 --> 01:03:19,135
Speaker 1: I have to go back to my sophomore.

1090
01:03:19,275 --> 01:03:26,133
Speaker 1: You know, I'm in high school I have classes tomorrow And it's midnight and I'm in the dark.

1091
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:28,259
Speaker 1: I don't know where I am because I know GPS is back.

1092
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:28,420
Speaker 1: then.

1093
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, what would your GPS do if you're on the Sun?

1094
01:03:33,824 --> 01:03:35,170
Speaker 1: melt I Think we're done here.

1095
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:41,444
Speaker 0: Yeah This is fun doing a whole bunch of short stories because you didn't have to just keep find a whole bunch to say about one Story.

1096
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:43,040
Speaker 0: we could just say a whole bunch.

1097
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:50,500
Speaker 1: You can definitely tell that some stories affected me or Scott Moore because like I'd have a lot to say about one Scott I mean, there are some short story collections out there.

1098
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,963
Speaker 0: We're like every one is like a smash right and there are other ones Like.

1099
01:03:53,983 --> 01:04:00,719
Speaker 1: there's one really awesome one and the rest are kind of yeah The only one that was Ed was the dinosaur one, but it made up for that by being so stupid.

1100
01:04:01,427 --> 01:04:02,053
Speaker 0: What the time?

1101
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:07,729
Speaker 0: Not the lighthouse dinosaur dinosaur was awesome.

1102
01:04:07,769 --> 01:04:08,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1103
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:17,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know I didn't Just for that moment at the end where he's like you fucker, I'm gonna time-traveling dinosaur when it's basically Jurassic Park, right?

1104
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:18,845
Speaker 0: I mean plus time travel.

1105
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:23,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean which is actually weird because Michael Crichton's like he did Jurassic Park and timeline.

1106
01:04:24,362 --> 01:04:27,700
Speaker 0: So he did a time travel and he did a die with with night arrows.

1107
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:32,510
Speaker 1: Anyone remember night arrows?

1108
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:37,120
Speaker 0: I read I read the book and you know I don't remember a single thing from except that there was night.

1109
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:39,772
Speaker 0: They went back to medieval times and there were night arrows.

1110
01:04:39,872 --> 01:04:41,359
Speaker 0: I don't remember the night arrows arrows.

1111
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:44,611
Speaker 1: So night arrows is a shtick from movies.

1112
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,904
Speaker 1: You should say all right remember that We're in the movie.

1113
01:04:47,924 --> 01:04:50,859
Speaker 1: At least I never read the book movie fucking sucks, by the way.

1114
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:54,652
Speaker 1: So they're fighting, you know, the the French and the French are out there.

1115
01:04:55,053 --> 01:04:58,885
Speaker 1: Oh, and they're like, all right We've got to use the bad weapon.

1116
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:03,619
Speaker 1: We're going to use night arrows and everyone's like, oh fuck night arrows.

1117
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,487
Speaker 1: Wow What have we become night arrow?

1118
01:05:05,507 --> 01:05:06,953
Speaker 0: They just fire arrows on fire.

1119
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:08,760
Speaker 1: They're like this died arrows.

1120
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:10,720
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm comfortable using night arrows.

1121
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:12,907
Speaker 1: This is like the worst weapon in the world.

1122
01:05:13,649 --> 01:05:19,952
Speaker 1: and then it cuts to like the French soldiers standing out there and apparently Normal arrows are just arrows that are on fire.

1123
01:05:20,012 --> 01:05:21,940
Speaker 1: so you can see them coming night arrows.

1124
01:05:22,021 --> 01:05:23,379
Speaker 1: They just don't light them on fire.

1125
01:05:23,782 --> 01:05:32,780
Speaker 1: so it cuts to the French soldiers and they're like standing there and Suddenly like arrows fall and like a soldier falls down with an arrow in him and someone's like night arrows.

1126
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,248
Speaker 0: Okay, who did that and thought it was serious?

1127
01:05:42,388 --> 01:05:46,620
Speaker 1: I don't even know if night arrows was a real chivalry thing or not.

1128
01:05:47,341 --> 01:05:48,244
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1129
01:05:48,384 --> 01:05:51,554
Speaker 1: but night air that is one of my favorite episodes of movies.

1130
01:05:51,574 --> 01:06:00,155
Speaker 0: You should see simply syndicated Yeah, but yeah, if you're right, you know, if you like some of the stories in here You should read anything else with Ray Bradbury his name on it.

1131
01:06:00,295 --> 01:06:01,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, right, right.

1132
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:01,944
Speaker 0: You know, I'm really.

1133
01:06:01,964 --> 01:06:03,355
Speaker 0: you know, I read Fahrenheit 451.

1134
01:06:03,355 --> 01:06:03,979
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

1135
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:06,850
Speaker 1: he's very creative and he I feel like I really.

1136
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:19,138
Speaker 0: what I wonder is if he uses that same technique of Revealing the setting like that, you know in other works or if it's just something he did in these set of short stories Like you know, what a one of the books is he written?

1137
01:06:19,158 --> 01:06:21,483
Speaker 0: I Don't even know them.

1138
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:24,011
Speaker 0: That's because I haven't read them and on that note.

1139
01:06:24,412 --> 01:06:26,620
Speaker 1: That was the golden apples of the Sun Ray Bradbury.

1140
01:06:26,741 --> 01:06:32,692
Speaker 0: the next book is Oh at the World War Z Z Z zombie.

1141
01:06:32,973 --> 01:06:34,237
Speaker 0: World War Z zombies.

1142

Speaker 0: You're getting your zombies All right, so shut up is?

1143
01:06:36,427 --> 01:06:40,811
Speaker 1: I swear to God you assholes if this book isn't good Ah, it's probably not gonna be good.

1144
01:06:40,851 --> 01:06:42,420
Speaker 0: But you know what you asked for fucking zombies.

1145
01:06:42,621 --> 01:06:45,893
Speaker 0: You're getting your goddamn zombies so you can shut son of a bitch.

1146
01:06:45,913 --> 01:06:48,442
Speaker 0: from now on you're only getting what I want to give you You're gonna do.

1147
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:54,765
Speaker 1: here's the medicine you asked for you watch out because if we're playing bad medicine again I'm bringing out the fucking sutonius.

1148
01:06:55,247 --> 01:06:56,290
Speaker 0: What the fuck sutonius?

1149
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:57,654
Speaker 1: or maybe the Odyssey?

1150
01:06:57,674 --> 01:06:59,400
Speaker 0: you got to bring out something's Elise.

1151
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:03,113
Speaker 1: All right, you know, hey, but the Odyssey you're saying the Odyssey isn't awesome.

1152
01:07:03,173 --> 01:07:03,815
Speaker 0: It's pretty big.

1153
01:07:03,835 --> 01:07:05,160
Speaker 1: It's not that big.

1154
01:07:05,863 --> 01:07:06,968
Speaker 1: The Odyssey is not that long.

1155
01:07:07,068 --> 01:07:07,349
Speaker 1: Actually.

1156
