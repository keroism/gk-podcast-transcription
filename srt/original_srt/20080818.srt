1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,406
Speaker 0: It's Monday August 18th.

2
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,148
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3

Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:16,525
Speaker 0: We talk about the magnificent Ti-80x.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,131
Speaker 0: Let's do this Well despite the total lack of live at the beach.

6
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:35,195
Speaker 0: geek nights episodes.

7
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,780
Speaker 0: We're back from the week of crazy.

8
00:00:37,422 --> 00:00:38,065
Speaker 1: Oh, that was quite.

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,413
Speaker 1: It was like almost like four separate vacations.

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:45,051
Speaker 1: I got back to work, and it was so weird I forgot how to do my work.

11
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,680
Speaker 0: almost I got back to the house.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,374
Speaker 0: I remember walking in being like oh, yeah, I have a house.

13
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,097
Speaker 1: Well.

14
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:51,900
Speaker 1: I don't have the house.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,500
Speaker 0: I'd live in the house, but it's like I'm walking up the stairs.

16
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,510
Speaker 0: I'm like this kind of weird to be here again.

17
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:58,360
Speaker 0: I kind of felt like I'd never come back here.

18
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,984
Speaker 1: I got home And there was the.

19
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:02,777
Speaker 1: there was stuff that I bought in the dealers room at Kineticon.

20
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:05,479
Speaker 1: that was on my desk And I was like oh yeah, that's mine.

21
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:08,244
Speaker 1: Forgot about that.

22
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:11,780
Speaker 0: I got back to work and the thing is unlike other jobs.

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:22,840
Speaker 0: Or you know like I expected to check my eat my work email at least once because it just happens I mean when I worked at IBM like I checked my IBM email when I worked at the hospital I'd check my hospital email and this job.

24
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,138
Speaker 0: It's so much easier for me to check my work email that it ever has been.

25
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,539
Speaker 0: I mean I have a work as it actually works.

26
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:33,159
Speaker 0: I have my work laptop and my laptop both of which can use the VPN to get in.

27
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,370
Speaker 0: They gave me a Verizon card so I can connect from anywhere.

28
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,397
Speaker 0: I also have the blackberry anywhere.

29
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:39,300
Speaker 1: with Verizon service.

30
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:46,260
Speaker 0: I did not once get a pocket to the point of actually seeing an email from my work my work.

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,240
Speaker 1: I have the push email to the iPhone, so I checked it the tiniest bit, and it was like half spam.

32
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,759
Speaker 1: So I didn't actually check it.

33
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,647
Speaker 1: But I think I did like open it once.

34
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:56,048
Speaker 1: but

35
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:10,960
Speaker 0: I can't believe it because when I when I left IBM for like a week Or two I'd come back and there would be like 2,000 emails in my inbox most of which were critical issues and everything would have gone to hell And I'd I'd have to spend weeks and weeks and weeks just like catching up and fixing things.

36
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:14,740
Speaker 0: And the hospital was the same way like they try to page me and call me the whole time.

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,503
Speaker 0: I was gone of course.

38
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:19,560
Speaker 0: I left my pager at home, so that didn't really help and I never gave him my real phone number.

39
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:21,549
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know this job.

40
00:02:21,589 --> 00:02:28,850
Speaker 0: I get back and I check my work email and One person asked me a question and at the end.

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,455
Speaker 0: He basically said yeah, no rush.

42
00:02:30,475 --> 00:02:31,899
Speaker 0: We can deal with this when you get back.

43
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,479
Speaker 1: Did you actually set the auto away?

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,114
Speaker 0: I did in exchange but no one even people knew I was away and they didn't pull that crap at every.

45
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,485
Speaker 0: it seems like every tech worker has the Problem.

46
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:51,212
Speaker 0: or if you go out of town You come back and like all your co-workers dumped all their work on you because you weren't there to say no I don't really have that problem because there's no one who can dance more.

47
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:52,940
Speaker 0: an IT problem a lot of IT jobs.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,134
Speaker 0: You'll come back and you'll find because you know you get your.

49
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:01,420
Speaker 0: if you're dealing with tickets Especially like there'll be like a million tickets that come in and about half of them are easy.

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:07,960
Speaker 0: You know people like to grab the low-hanging fruit And you'll find that people tend to play hot potato with the issues that take more than a cursory glance.

51
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,500
Speaker 0: And if you're not there to throw the hot potato you'll come back and be buried in potato.

52
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:12,902
Speaker 1: I don't know.

53
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,828
Speaker 1: We don't really play how.

54
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:15,880
Speaker 1: I've never had a job where they play the hot potato.

55
00:03:16,641 --> 00:03:17,343
Speaker 0: Well, you're lucky.

56
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:25,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but I got back to work and there was something I was working on before I left And I guess they wanted it done, but they couldn't find my work.

57
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,684
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

58
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,350
Speaker 1: so they sort of did it without me.

59
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,615
Speaker 1: They started from scratch.

60
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,820
Speaker 1: So my work didn't get used.

61
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:31,599
Speaker 0: Oh, that's great.

62
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,647
Speaker 1: And then I got like most of the.

63
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 1: I made it to-do list because I was like, oh, yeah work and I did most of it.

64
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:39,405
Speaker 0: You know what the scary thing is.

65
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,172
Speaker 0: All right, you know before we go any further.

66
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,060
Speaker 0: Hi all of you new people.

67
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,086
Speaker 1: Are there new people?

68
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:45,951
Speaker 0: it seems to be.

69
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:47,700
Speaker 0: we met a lot of people at these cons.

70
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:48,768
Speaker 1: I hope there's new people.

71
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,219
Speaker 1: if not, what did we just do?

72
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:59,374
Speaker 0: Well the thing I want to say before we go any further as many of you are probably here looking for Oticon coverage or maybe even more Kinetic on coverage or you met us.

73
00:03:59,394 --> 00:03:59,775
Speaker 0: you're looking at.

74
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,460
Speaker 0: you can see the title of the episode.

75
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:05,680
Speaker 0: You know what's coming through what I basically the deal with geek knives, right?

76
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:16,773
Speaker 0: Is that it's four nights a week with four separate shows Mondays which is now our science and techs and Linux and neck beards and all that stuff and With the neck beard joke, it's not funny.

77
00:04:17,095 --> 00:04:17,779
Speaker 0: I think it's hilarious.

78
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,479
Speaker 0: That's not good, especially because I had a neck beard throughout much of college and the entirety of last week.

79
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:23,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a neck beard.

80
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:28,460
Speaker 0: last week I shaved the neck beard off and I forgot how good it feels to shave a neck beard off.

81
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:31,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course, then I lost a lot of my CSH skill.

82
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:32,717
Speaker 1: That's all right.

83
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:33,560
Speaker 1: You don't need that skill.

84
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:39,563
Speaker 0: But if you're here looking for Oticon coverage or the list of you know anime You should see.

85
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:43,879
Speaker 0: or all the things we said we'd tell you guys from the con or all the people we say we've shout outs to.

86
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:49,628
Speaker 0: Tuesday night is gaming talk about gaming Wednesday night anime manga comics.

87
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:53,660
Speaker 0: our coverage of Oticon 2008 will be this week on a Wednesday.

88
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:55,205
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's.

89
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:57,840
Speaker 0: and also for people who complained.

90
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:02,480
Speaker 0: Well one person complained that our kinetic on coverage was mostly us talking about ourselves.

91
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,908
Speaker 0: There's a there's very specific reason for that.

92
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,218
Speaker 0: We didn't do anything at the con except do our thing.

93
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:13,720
Speaker 0: Yeah Fortunately for you at Oticon we were actually press and we actually have a lot to talk about.

94
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,760
Speaker 1: We do because we spend much of Oticon conning as opposed to running thing.

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,830
Speaker 1: Well, no, we did run a whole bunch of things.

96
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,880
Speaker 0: We also can we also kind of plenty.

97
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:30,725
Speaker 1: another thing a lot of the people that I met a lot of the listeners I met at Oticon and Connecticut such a Surprising number of them.

98
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:32,573
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say the majority of them.

99
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:34,040
Speaker 1: We're not in the forums.

100
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:44,140
Speaker 0: Oh even further if I realize something, you know looking at people in the forum and one guy quit our show again He's quit our show a bunch of times, but he's like, yeah I'm done with geek dice now blah blah.

101
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:50,860
Speaker 0: And I noticed that a lot of people it seems like a lot of the people in our forum do not listen to geek nights.

102
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:57,746
Speaker 0: but yet Everyone we made outside like we go to a con we meet like 50 or so people are all like, oh my god I listen to geek nights.

103
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,919
Speaker 0: None of them are in the forums.

104
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:06,748
Speaker 0: So how come the people who are our biggest fans are not in the forums and the people who don't even listen to the show Are hanging out in the forums.

105
00:06:06,808 --> 00:06:07,251
Speaker 0: I don't get it.

106
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:08,035
Speaker 1: I don't get it either.

107
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:09,040
Speaker 1: So we need to fix this.

108
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,309
Speaker 1: So check this out people.

109
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:21,080
Speaker 1: if you listen to this show You probably have a lot in common with other people who listen to this show and enjoy the show and you probably Want to talk to them and you know what I talked to them.

110
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,553
Speaker 1: I met them in person and they were all pretty smart especially you.

111
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:25,557
Speaker 0: you know that guy.

112
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:29,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, you are I told was cool and you were better than all our other listeners, right?

113
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:38,247
Speaker 1: That guy so our girl you should probably go to front recruit calm and on the left It says discussion for him until we're gonna.

114
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:42,300
Speaker 1: we're gonna fake update the website sooner or later and that won't beat on the left anymore.

115
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,620
Speaker 0: But night's is perpetually on the cusp of change.

116
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,220
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of big change coming and the website is gonna be the first roll of that.

117
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:50,051
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we don't say dates for anything.

118
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,540
Speaker 1: that way we'll have no broken promises.

119
00:06:51,761 --> 00:07:04,737
Speaker 0: But the one thing you should know if you join our for if you're sick of you know The internet and places on the internet where people talk about things I recommend you check out the geek nights forums because the ignite forums do not allow idiots to exist.

120
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:19,444
Speaker 1: Yes, so you should probably go to the forums and where you can for free on the internet talk as much or as little as you like to other people who you share things with and It's a good idea.

121
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:19,967
Speaker 1: So go there.

122
00:07:20,348 --> 00:07:21,634
Speaker 0: That was a real lame promotion.

123
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:22,397
Speaker 1: That's all right.

124
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,364
Speaker 0: All right, check it out It's not fortune.

125
00:07:24,465 --> 00:07:28,820
Speaker 0: All right, if you're on the internet a lot everything in the world except fortune is not fortune.

126
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,974
Speaker 1: A lot of my poop is not fortune.

127
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:36,980
Speaker 0: It's close Right, but I just wanted to get that out of the way.

128
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,040
Speaker 0: So in case you guys are like, oh my god, those geek nice guys did a great anime panel.

129
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,171
Speaker 0: I want to listen to their anime show and we're here talking about neckbeards.

130
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:47,643
Speaker 0: Well that this is why come back on Wednesday night That's enough of that.

131
00:07:48,165 --> 00:07:51,275
Speaker 0: So anyway, what were we talking about?

132
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,957
Speaker 1: What's in the news?

133
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:52,860
Speaker 1: I get you want me to go.

134
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:53,807
Speaker 0: I think you can go.

135
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:54,775
Speaker 0: check this out right.

136
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:55,077
Speaker 0: check in.

137
00:07:55,803 --> 00:08:10,812
Speaker 1: It's been this big problem where you know we have these open source licenses right for software programs and other things also like Creative Commons for this show and They're interesting in that what they do is they pretty much cuz in the United States.

138
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:16,327
Speaker 1: by default you get copyright full-on 100% rights reserved, right?

139
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:27,940
Speaker 1: So the idea of these open source licenses is to say hey look I'm gonna keep the copyright on this thing But only some or most of the rights will be reserved, right?

140
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:47,720
Speaker 1: So you say for example, well our Creative Commons license says, you know what you can copy this You can give it to your friends you can You know remix it a bit you can do all these things but your remixes have to also be Creative Commons and You can't go selling it, you know.

141
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:52,642
Speaker 1: So you can't be taking an episode of geek nights put it on a CD and sell for ten bucks and I'll do that Right.

142
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,640
Speaker 1: So basically we're not reserving all the rights.

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,342
Speaker 1: We're telling where.

144
00:08:56,924 --> 00:09:01,297
Speaker 1: we have a legal document which says only these rights are being reserved and these ones aren't.

145
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:10,233
Speaker 1: now There's a lot of other licenses the GPL notably You know the MIT license the BSD license like yada yada yada.

146
00:09:10,313 --> 00:09:12,220
Speaker 0: Don't forget all the weird licenses.

147
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:18,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Apache license Mozilla whatever right the Aladdin whatever that there's like don't use that one anymore.

148
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:30,840
Speaker 0: I actually had to write an explanation of that life because there's one piece of software That we really needed at IBM because it did something really useful and nothing else did it and it was only covered under that license.

149
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:36,176
Speaker 0: So I had to basically explain to IBM why we couldn't use it because that license was really really dumb.

150
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:36,658
Speaker 0: Yep.

151
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 1: Anyway The Problem with all these licenses is that they've never really been tested in court like people always talk about.

152
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:56,100
Speaker 1: Oh look links is used Linux in their routers But they didn't put the source code to their routers on the Internet's as a GPL violation, but they fixed it.

153
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,300
Speaker 1: They you know, they put their service code on the Internet's but there wasn't any court issue.

154
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,968
Speaker 0: No Here's the fundamental problem is look at this.

155
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:08,868
Speaker 0: our court system is designed to where you prove damages and then you know You get some sort of restitution.

156
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,900
Speaker 0: But how do you prove the damages if you're giving it away for free?

157
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,180
Speaker 0: Anyway, I mean I have something and I give it away for free.

158
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:19,700
Speaker 0: So then someone else takes it makes money off of it or does something that I didn't approve in my copyright licensing, whatever.

159
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:22,271
Speaker 0: So how does the court determine?

160
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,980
Speaker 0: because usually what the court to do is say?

161
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,623
Speaker 0: All right You were stealing that software and that person sells the software for hard $400 a license and you stole five Licenses.

162
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,440
Speaker 0: you owe four hundred times five dollars back to them plus interest whatever.

163
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 0: What do you do when you're giving away from free especially when it's a judge?

164
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:42,662
Speaker 0: He doesn't really understand the technological issues and lawyers don't really care and you have a jury who has no idea if there's even a Jury involved.

165
00:10:42,682 --> 00:10:45,352
Speaker 0: So how do you what sort of restitution?

166
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:46,496
Speaker 0: you're giving it away for free?

167
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:52,077
Speaker 0: So, alright I hereby give you 500 licenses times the cost you were giving it out of zero.

168
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:54,444
Speaker 1: yeah, and it's not.

169
00:10:54,525 --> 00:11:09,060
Speaker 1: it's mostly what it is is you have this license and You say you basically say well, you know what if you do this It's not copyright infringement as it normally would be but if you do this other thing then it still is copyright infringement.

170
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,267
Speaker 1: Then you go to court.

171
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:23,018
Speaker 1: No one's ever actually gone to court against someone who is you know Say distributing GPL software without also distributing the source code and said hey you're infringing on my copyright Give me money.

172
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:25,068
Speaker 1: No one's ever tried that right.

173
00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:31,698
Speaker 1: and still no one's ever tried that or at least no one's ever tried That without having some sort of settlement, you know, there's never been a decision.

174
00:11:31,718 --> 00:11:34,244
Speaker 1: So People are very going.

175
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:37,072
Speaker 1: Oh, you know, they really don't want to go to court.

176
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:42,410
Speaker 1: because if you go to court and you lose That is basically end of the road for the GPL.

177
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:42,972
Speaker 1: Goodbye.

178
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:44,980
Speaker 1: All the open source software is in big trouble.

179
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,339
Speaker 1: The whole thing's gonna fall apart.

180
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,446
Speaker 1: So they'd rather just keep things the way they are Then test it out.

181
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,580
Speaker 1: or you know, it'd be good if they tested it out in court and they won.

182
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,443
Speaker 1: That'd be all good.

183
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:59,340
Speaker 1: But you know better to not test it than to lose.

184
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,666
Speaker 0: Well, there's a bunch.

185
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:06,559
Speaker 0: I mean even if we test it what I mean It could go either way in terms of how the courts deal with it.

186
00:12:06,806 --> 00:12:14,069
Speaker 0: Yeah Because no one in the chain really kind of understands the purpose of this software let alone How to actually I mean what art.

187
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,415
Speaker 0: so the license cost was zero.

188
00:12:15,455 --> 00:12:16,660
Speaker 0: do we do punitive damages?

189
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,470
Speaker 0: Is that the only way to have a deterrent?

190
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:24,879
Speaker 1: Maybe the maybe Just be copyright infringement and then it'll be up to the judge I guess to figure out.

191
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,800
Speaker 1: you know I'm not a lawyer, but probably the judge would figure out some way.

192
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,287
Speaker 1: You know, I mean when someone the RA when you copyright infringe on music They have some method of figuring out a man.

193
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,660
Speaker 0: that is usually something along the lines of how much they sell it for.

194
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:37,562
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:12:37,783 --> 00:12:37,964
Speaker 1: Yeah.

196
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:41,073
Speaker 1: Well, it's actually a billion times what they sell it for.

197
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:44,170
Speaker 0: that's because you obviously pirated a billion time I know right.

198
00:12:44,475 --> 00:13:05,750
Speaker 1: But anyway So the news is is that one of the open source licenses the artistic license Which is used for Perl and some other things mostly CPAN things which are Perl modules was tested by a US Federal Court of Appeals circuit court, I think and They said artistic license all good.

199
00:13:06,312 --> 00:13:08,419
Speaker 1: So this is like oh man is that you know?

200
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:17,648
Speaker 1: Based on that ruling, you know barring I guess farther up courts say the Supreme Court reversing it Which I don't think is too likely.

201
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:19,658
Speaker 1: This isn't really seem like a Supreme Court issue.

202
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:26,940
Speaker 1: Open source licenses and such and Creative Commons and all these sorts of things are legally the real deal.

203
00:13:27,944 --> 00:13:28,918
Speaker 1: That's good news.

204
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:35,779
Speaker 1: This is accompanied by bad news, which is not obvious to the you know to the average person.

205
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,008
Speaker 0: But the doll is evil that's bad.

206
00:13:40,088 --> 00:13:41,272
Speaker 0: but it comes with a free Frogger.

207
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,034
Speaker 0: that's good.

208
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,751
Speaker 1: the Frogger is also cursed That's bad.

209
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:47,099
Speaker 1: All right Here's the bad news.

210
00:13:48,003 --> 00:14:00,088
Speaker 1: If some license I just slap on a piece of software like that is upheld by the law, you know And I can you know do that then Other EULA's have a much stronger ground.

211
00:14:00,289 --> 00:14:01,372
Speaker 1: Well in courts.

212
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:07,140
Speaker 0: There's a really I mean it depends in a lot of ways But we are most specifically right.

213
00:14:08,082 --> 00:14:12,140
Speaker 1: Look at the those people the size star company where they're making max.

214
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,554
Speaker 1: Basically, they make you know normal PCs and they put OS X on them the old.

215
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:22,407
Speaker 1: they haven't really committed a crime except for Copyright infringement of the Mac OS.

216
00:14:22,467 --> 00:14:23,630
Speaker 1: but not really.

217
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:33,440
Speaker 1: but you know because they I guess they buy a license for each computer But because they have violated the you know terms that are in the agreement that Apple gave them.

218
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:40,168
Speaker 1: You know what defines what Apple considers, you know Acceptable use of their software and what isn't.

219
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:41,332
Speaker 1: so that's a very.

220
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:49,180
Speaker 1: that's a case that is very close Legally to sort of like these open source case, but yet we'd rather have that one go the other way.

221
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,734
Speaker 0: No, here's why we don't because we die doesn't matter.

222
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:54,928
Speaker 0: either way with EULA's There are only two possible cases really.

223
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:06,131
Speaker 0: either EULA's are found to not really be enforceable which means we as techies win a thousand times over or EULA's are found to be legally binding.

224
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:09,966
Speaker 0: There's no way around them in which case Real quickly.

225
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:20,909
Speaker 0: They're going to be a lot of problems with people making software that has absolutely insane licenses attached to it like Apple OS X which says you can only still install it.

226
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:25,604
Speaker 0: I'm imagining spyware that if you install it you agree to never uninstall it Huh?

227
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,339
Speaker 1: Yes, I guess stuff like that.

228
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:29,588
Speaker 0: But I guess I expect that.

229
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:38,340
Speaker 0: I wholeheartedly expect that and if that happens Then there'll be such an outcry and a backlash against the enforceability of EULA's that will win in the end anyway.

230
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:46,360
Speaker 1: But see that if there's no EULA enforcement Then the default of everything is super copyrighted comes into play and we can't open source things.

231
00:15:46,865 --> 00:15:50,380
Speaker 0: But if that's the case Then it'll win because things will be open source anyway.

232
00:15:50,521 --> 00:15:53,619
Speaker 0: The only drawback will be the companies will take open source stuff and try to use it.

233
00:15:54,261 --> 00:16:00,140
Speaker 0: But at the same time I could see the war escalating to where open source people just start subtly sabotaging those uses.

234
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:05,538
Speaker 1: Well, I think for legal reasons businesses would pretty much had to abandon open source and open source would die.

235
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:07,024
Speaker 1: and it'd be necessarily.

236
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:13,860
Speaker 0: they can keep contributing to open source because it's useful to them because the bottom line to any Software is if it is useful to a corporation.

237
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,080
Speaker 1: That's the thing that Microsoft is always trying to scare people about like oh the legality of open source.

238
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,067
Speaker 1: You know, if you use it, you'll be screwed.

239
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:21,733
Speaker 1: You'll be copyrighted infringers.

240
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,800
Speaker 1: If you use it, don't go there.

241
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:33,219
Speaker 1: So if EULA's are not there then suddenly all open source software Becomes fully copyrighted software and these people can't be using it.

242
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,180
Speaker 0: Well, then it becomes the case of you.

243
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,600
Speaker 0: I just have to agree to the license like bad an extra step ad steps.

244
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,868
Speaker 0: You actually have to agree to a license before you use it in some sort of verifiable way as opposed to the shrink About the shrink wrap.

245
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:49,205
Speaker 1: This is just about light software license in general I know and they're so.

246
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:52,600
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter how it's accepted within with a signature or anything.

247
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:55,818
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is in the end it probably will be because EULA's.

248
00:16:56,461 --> 00:16:59,500
Speaker 0: There's kind of this implicit idea that no one reads them or understands them.

249
00:16:59,901 --> 00:17:06,884
Speaker 0: but if software is made available with there's absolutely no way to get it without reading it first and That's true.

250
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,440
Speaker 1: But that's a completely separate issue from what's going on here.

251
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,512
Speaker 1: This is just the question of software licenses in general.

252
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:16,048
Speaker 1: regardless of how you agree to them Do they mean anything at all?

253
00:17:16,388 --> 00:17:18,076
Speaker 1: and the court has said yes.

254
00:17:18,196 --> 00:17:21,413
Speaker 1: Yes, they do So we'll see what comes of this.

255
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:27,500
Speaker 1: but in the meantime The experts tend to agree and I'll trust Larry lesson because he's the expert.

256
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,991
Speaker 1: He says this is awesome because it means all these open source licenses.

257
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,395
Speaker 1: are they mean something?

258
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:33,840
Speaker 1: they're the real deal and they count.

259
00:17:34,241 --> 00:17:48,400
Speaker 1: so if some company decides to use Linux in their TiVo or whatever and Doesn't do what the GPL says to do There's a good chance we can beat them in court with this previous ruling used as you know prior whatever.

260
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:58,280
Speaker 0: So, you know what the issue here is that it seems like if they're if the licenses aren't enforceable Then things can still be in the public domain and can still be given away free.

261
00:17:58,802 --> 00:18:02,858
Speaker 0: And if they're not enforceable then companies can use it anyway, because no one has any recourse against them.

262
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:08,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are enforceable then the open source part of it works and the companies can still use it.

263
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:13,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't foresee any situation where companies could not continue to use open source.

264
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:16,244
Speaker 0: There is What situation.

265
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:23,833
Speaker 1: but if they decided that open source licenses right that it was copyright infringement Even if you you know, they don't count right?

266
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,100
Speaker 1: They're not legal whatever.

267
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:26,859
Speaker 0: I don't think that was really an option though.

268
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:35,390
Speaker 1: if they decided they don't count right then all open source software would be 100% fully copyright of the person who it's copyright to.

269
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,087
Speaker 0: but there's the other part of in that specific case if Someone is giving it away for free.

270
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:41,955
Speaker 0: And even if the license is super strict.

271
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:42,859
Speaker 0: Well, how do you enforce it?

272
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:44,424
Speaker 0: What are the damages?

273
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:46,551
Speaker 0: if it was free the damages would be zero.

274
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:49,540
Speaker 1: no, but you know because you could technically be sued.

275
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:52,305
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter what the damages are If you know.

276
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:57,460
Speaker 1: it said if you could technically be sued Companies won't do anything that puts them in a position where they can be sued.

277
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:12,440
Speaker 0: I just I don't feel like that was really the issue because if someone gives something away under a license Then it seems like the issue is more that if the license isn't enforceable Then the person who gave it away with the open source license would not be able to exercise other rights that they had properly.

278
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:20,107
Speaker 1: No, it's pretty much if the the open source license is not about enforcing things It's about removing existing enforcement.

279
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:22,816
Speaker 1: The default enforcement is full copyright.

280
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,204
Speaker 1: the open source license Gets rid.

281
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:29,500
Speaker 1: it says I'm going to get rid of things that I already have but here's the opposite.

282
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,285
Speaker 0: What other lies?

283
00:19:30,306 --> 00:19:31,192
Speaker 0: because there's the problem.

284
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:42,720
Speaker 0: if because there's the other A lot of court cases been were court cases that have almost happened but didn't deal with the idea that alright I released my software under an open source license And if it is valid then that's fine.

285
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,352
Speaker 0: But then the license basically is tantamount to public domain.

286
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:50,346
Speaker 0: if it can't be enforced or if you can't get down Oh, it's the license doesn't count.

287
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:53,820
Speaker 1: then you weren't able to give up the rights that the license is giving up.

288
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,724
Speaker 1: No, it's full copy.

289
00:19:54,744 --> 00:19:56,974
Speaker 0: There's a whole other issue where the license does count.

290
00:19:57,015 --> 00:19:59,760
Speaker 0: you can give up the rights But by giving it away for free.

291
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,602
Speaker 0: there's the other issue.

292
00:20:00,622 --> 00:20:06,399
Speaker 0: if you can't actually enforce the rights you did reserve which people have run into because what's the deterrent?

293
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:17,580
Speaker 0: if the Damages you have caught that have caused to you by someone stealing and reusing your free software are zero There's no incentive not to just violate your non-commercial clause or violate whatever clause you've got.

294
00:20:17,961 --> 00:20:19,927
Speaker 0: I can remember the brouhaha where a lot of people had the.

295
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:24,280
Speaker 0: you cannot use our software for military or weapons of mass destruction.

296
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:28,423
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if someone has that sort of license Then that's kind of.

297
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:37,300
Speaker 0: there's this third issue of the licenses are valid but not enforceable and that is the fear of a lot of Open-source people because a lot of open-source people have bugs up their butts.

298
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:42,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, it turned out I guess in a really good way in this case.

299
00:20:42,761 --> 00:20:47,117
Speaker 1: So continue to open source license things with less fear than before.

300
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:58,879
Speaker 0: in fact As inside to all you podcasters out there seems like a lot of people who make content Don't actually attach some sort of license to it Which as a result means that technically no one's allowed to do anything with what you made?

301
00:20:59,282 --> 00:21:03,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much, you know if you I mean technically speaking right.

302
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,450
Speaker 1: if you make an mp3 and you put it on your website and You don't license it in any way.

303
00:21:10,832 --> 00:21:15,307
Speaker 1: You have full copyright in which Technically speaking not a lawyer again.

304
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:20,872
Speaker 1: if they just download it from your website and listen to it They're infringing on the copyright because you didn't give them.

305
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,440
Speaker 0: it's already been shown in core.

306
00:21:22,561 --> 00:21:25,880
Speaker 0: There's been a lot of cases where they really can't go after people for downloading.

307
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,380
Speaker 0: They can only get them for uploading because if something was made available There's a reasonable expectation in a lot of cases that it was actually available.

308
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:33,244
Speaker 1: Oh, that's okay.

309
00:21:33,264 --> 00:21:36,700
Speaker 0: then because notice how the RIA only really goes after people who are uploading.

310
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:38,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

311
00:21:38,304 --> 00:21:39,408
Speaker 1: But I mean they can't.

312
00:21:39,468 --> 00:21:42,619
Speaker 1: you know, someone can't come get your podcast then share it with their friend.

313
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,504
Speaker 0: now They can't.

314
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:44,655
Speaker 1: so you have to.

315
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:57,318
Speaker 0: you know There are the exceptions for fair use and private viewing and all that right, but then again legally You really wouldn't be able to play a podcast That doesn't have a license associated with it in a bar because there's too many people and that's a public performance,

316
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:57,780
Speaker 1: right?

317
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,680
Speaker 1: So even if you don't want to be all hippie open-source something you should find some legal license.

318
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,860
Speaker 1: There are plenty of them to choose from to apply to the media that you create.

319
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:11,567
Speaker 0: Most restrictive Creative Commons license.

320
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:12,088
Speaker 0: There you go.

321
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:12,669
Speaker 1: Yeah.

322
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,551
Speaker 0: All right.

323
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:15,216
Speaker 0: But anyway that that's all boring.

324
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:16,799
Speaker 0: and there's much more important news here.

325
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,689
Speaker 0: Seattle's five million dollar toilets failed and now they're gone.

326
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,635
Speaker 0: and they they Seattle lost a ton of money.

327
00:22:22,655 --> 00:22:22,715
Speaker 0: man.

328
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:24,280
Speaker 1: five million dollar toilets.

329
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,546
Speaker 1: Really somewhere they made a gold or platinum.

330
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:28,392
Speaker 0: There's a problem in America.

331
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:28,813
Speaker 0: I don't know.

332
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:36,300
Speaker 0: We have a lot of overseas listeners where As time has gone on there are basically no places for people to pee in public.

333
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:39,876
Speaker 0: If you're out on the street somewhere and you have to pee you're done.

334
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:40,840
Speaker 0: you pee in the bushes.

335
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:41,945
Speaker 0: You're a sex offender.

336
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:45,300
Speaker 0: Most stores won't let you use the bathroom if you're not a customer.

337
00:22:45,522 --> 00:22:47,616
Speaker 0: No, most stores just won't let you use the bathroom period.

338
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:48,160
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

339
00:22:48,381 --> 00:23:00,680
Speaker 0: And if like food restaurants will often let you use a bathroom But you usually have to be a customer So you have to go in and buy like a Starbucks like a coffee and then you can go and pee But like a department store half the time won't let you use the bathroom?

340
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:05,094
Speaker 1: Yeah The only places you can really go to the bathroom in public are gas stations.

341
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,960
Speaker 1: gas stations will always let you go to the bathroom.

342
00:23:07,921 --> 00:23:10,556
Speaker 0: I've run into bad gas stations that wouldn't let me go to the bathroom.

343
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,140
Speaker 0: They was locked.

344
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:13,491
Speaker 0: They wouldn't give me the key unless I bought something.

345
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:14,838
Speaker 1: Ah, it's really bad.

346
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:17,006
Speaker 1: Yes Let you.

347
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,217
Speaker 0: I actually got into a Mexican standoff for the gas station.

348
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:22,088
Speaker 0: like I was in high school I was gonna pee.

349
00:23:22,189 --> 00:23:23,198
Speaker 1: you're gonna pee in the gas station.

350
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:26,800
Speaker 1: That would have been a much better Mexican standoff.

351
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:33,970
Speaker 0: No, basically He was like you have to buy something or you can't use the toilet to which I said I would like to buy this five cent stick of gum.

352
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:42,259
Speaker 0: and he said all right, and I said with my credit card Mmm, and he stood there and he realized that he was going to cost him money to let me pee.

353
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,907
Speaker 1: You should have made American Express.

354
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:45,314
Speaker 1: the fee for him will be double.

355
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:46,660
Speaker 0: I don't have an American Express.

356
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,951
Speaker 0: That's why I got one.

357
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:48,677
Speaker 1: so I could do that.

358
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:56,720
Speaker 1: Because you realize if you the reason credit card companies make money is not just from stupid people collecting interest.

359
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,651
Speaker 1: It's mostly for merchants fees.

360
00:23:59,074 --> 00:24:05,696
Speaker 1: if you open up a store Let's say I own Scott's grocery store right and someone comes in uses their American Express card.

361
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:07,020
Speaker 1: Well, they use a MasterCard.

362
00:24:07,942 --> 00:24:11,520
Speaker 1: Let's say they buy $100 of stuff and they use their MasterCard.

363
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:14,091
Speaker 1: I have to give MasterCard me the grocery store.

364
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:15,658
Speaker 1: I have to give MasterCard like a buck.

365
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,506
Speaker 1: fifty It's or something like that.

366
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,720
Speaker 1: But if these American Express I might have to give them five bucks.

367
00:24:21,421 --> 00:24:25,112
Speaker 1: Alright, so you actually it costs you money when someone uses a card.

368
00:24:25,133 --> 00:24:26,096
Speaker 1: if they paying cash.

369
00:24:26,457 --> 00:24:28,418
Speaker 1: It doesn't cost me anything I get the full price.

370
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,452
Speaker 1: So stores hate it when you use a credit card.

371
00:24:32,653 --> 00:24:34,480
Speaker 1: They really hate it when you use American Express.

372
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,680
Speaker 1: That's why a lot of people don't even accept American Express because it just caused them so much to take it from you.

373
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,954
Speaker 0: Granted larger retailers get better deals and it's actually really complex.

374
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,380
Speaker 0: We're not gonna get into the exact prices.

375
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:47,720
Speaker 1: This is why the guy didn't want rim device ticket.

376
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:59,889
Speaker 0: If and this is the secret that if a store accepts credit cards They have to let you purchase with the credit card any amount of a store ever has a sign that says $10 minimum $5 minimum $20 minimum.

377
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,759
Speaker 0: Basically, they're not allowed to do that.

378
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,757
Speaker 0: Well, I think to their merchant agreement with Visa or MasterCard or wherever they did it with exactly do.

379
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:17,707
Speaker 0: then All you have to do is call the number on your credit card and tell them what that which store it was and that they Wouldn't let you buy something with a minimum.

380
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:22,871
Speaker 0: or they had a sign up saying there was a minimum and they will come down on That store like you wouldn't believe.

381
00:25:22,951 --> 00:25:24,200
Speaker 0: they are basically destroyed.

382
00:25:24,301 --> 00:25:27,760
Speaker 1: It's not against the law for them to say $10 minima to put it, you know.

383
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,686
Speaker 1: But if they refuse to accept your credit card as payment Just turn your credit card over.

384
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:39,969
Speaker 1: call that number while you're standing there and say I'm in such-and-such store You know, they will not accept my credit card.

385
00:25:40,009 --> 00:25:41,835
Speaker 1: They're claiming there is a $10 minimum.

386
00:25:41,855 --> 00:25:49,460
Speaker 1: bla bla bla bla bla and Either that store will get like huge fines or they'll be taken a court or they'll be forced to not you know.

387
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:54,569
Speaker 1: at the very least they'll be Severely reprimanded and forced to remove their minimum thing.

388
00:25:54,930 --> 00:26:02,559
Speaker 1: or if they don't cave in and you know to what the their agreement was They won't be allowed to accept MasterCard Visa, whatever anymore.

389
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:07,660
Speaker 0: Thus tip number 485 for people who like to be jerks in public yes, but anyway.

390
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:21,260
Speaker 0: so I had to stand off and he looks at me and he I could see he still didn't want to let me pee and He I think he was considering not letting me pee anyway, and you know, I kind of stood there like I'm gonna pee I want to pee and a credit card.

391
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,415
Speaker 0: I got this gum and eventually he said just use the bathroom and he gave me the key Mmm, and then after I peed I bought a Red Bull.

392
00:26:28,797 --> 00:26:33,791
Speaker 1: Yeah It was Red Bull in those days, well, it was actually it wasn't.

393
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:36,159
Speaker 0: it was the Red Bull back then it was that whoop-ass.

394
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,289
Speaker 0: In fact, it was that can of whoop-ass.

395
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:39,951
Speaker 1: Was it?

396
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,460
Speaker 1: I thought you bought the can of whoop-ass at like a con.

397
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,653
Speaker 0: No, I bought the can of whoop-ass halfway to Saginaw.

398
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:48,125
Speaker 0: Uh-huh All right.

399
00:26:48,185 --> 00:26:50,800
Speaker 1: I realized just recently the whoop-ass is made by Joan soda.

400
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:53,872
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the people who make like the Thanksgiving soda.

401
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:58,345
Speaker 0: tell you one thing that whoop-ass tasted like balls But it's never been.

402
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:59,047
Speaker 1: it's not open.

403
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,340
Speaker 0: I opened it and drank it a long time ago, it's an empty can.

404
00:27:02,842 --> 00:27:04,810
Speaker 0: Oh, I opened the can of whoop-ass.

405
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:07,039
Speaker 1: Did you know long ago?

406
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,386
Speaker 1: All right rim likes to open the ass.

407
00:27:09,446 --> 00:27:10,008
Speaker 0: It was my last.

408
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:10,951
Speaker 0: can I opened it.

409
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:11,453
Speaker 0: It's done.

410
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,219
Speaker 0: Anyway, so these toilets, right?

411
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:19,018
Speaker 0: Basically, the city was like we want public toilets, but homeless people will live in them.

412
00:27:19,218 --> 00:27:19,740
Speaker 1: exactly.

413
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:28,620
Speaker 1: This is a big problem in the US is that there are a lot of situations where we can't have nice things in public Because hobos will use them especially in cities.

414
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,326
Speaker 1: I mean small towns can usually have them.

415
00:27:30,367 --> 00:27:41,968
Speaker 1: but in a city like in New York, right you install benches Bums will sleep on them and normal people, you know, and there's everyday people won't be able to sit on that though Prostitutes were using them.

416
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:44,299
Speaker 0: people were living in and people are shooting up drugs in them.

417
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:47,479
Speaker 0: They were people would just walk in and like destroy them.

418
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:52,513
Speaker 1: Yep So, I mean it's really hard to have nice public facilities like always envious.

419
00:27:52,574 --> 00:27:57,640
Speaker 1: if I go to Canada even just to Niagara Falls Right on the border of New York and Canada, right?

420
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,934
Speaker 1: You go to you know, New York Niagara Falls kind of Blair.

421
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:03,300
Speaker 1: go to Canada Niagara Falls.

422
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,920
Speaker 1: There's like really really well maintained parks and everything is pretty and clean and it's right in the same geographic location.

423
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:14,079
Speaker 1: There's just one piece of water and a bridge in between but anyway cool the city.

424
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:20,120
Speaker 0: But the city canceled its contract this spring after the commodes became filthy hideouts for drug use and prostitution.

425
00:28:21,577 --> 00:28:25,360
Speaker 0: Now They were 12 million dollars because they were self-cleaning.

426
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:27,211
Speaker 1: Whoo self-cleaning tools like.

427
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:28,580
Speaker 1: I need one of those in the house.

428
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:38,385
Speaker 0: But you know and I wondered like alright why I can come up with ways to make a self-cleaning public toilet that prevents drug use Prostitution and hobos living in them.

429
00:28:39,188 --> 00:28:43,080
Speaker 0: I would have them open the door after like 10 minutes if someone's in.

430
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,300
Speaker 1: What if I had diarrhea?

431
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,797
Speaker 0: Well, you know what the door is gonna open and then you can close it again after a minute and you're gonna have to deal with that.

432
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:57,005
Speaker 0: Maybe 20 minutes to Every every instead of having it wash like after someone's in there Every hour.

433
00:28:57,306 --> 00:29:02,898
Speaker 0: if like if no one's in there, it'll just wash and if someone's in there It'll give them 20 minutes and then it'll just wash.

434
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,407
Speaker 1: Well, it should give like a wash warning.

435
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,033
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it'll say in 20 minutes.

436
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:07,935
Speaker 0: You're gonna get wet.

437
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:09,340
Speaker 1: But what if I have diarrhea?

438
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,262
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

439
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:11,608
Speaker 0: You've got a tough.

440
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:14,180
Speaker 1: This is serious problems with your with your strategy.

441
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,613
Speaker 0: You know what, you know what needs of the many greater than needs the few.

442
00:29:17,653 --> 00:29:25,600
Speaker 0: Star Trek taught me that no One guy with diarrhea is much less important to me than hundreds of people who need to pee every single day.

443
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,250
Speaker 1: You say that until you're the diary again.

444
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,356
Speaker 0: I'm never that guy.

445
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:28,940
Speaker 1: I'm that guy.

446
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,969
Speaker 0: But anyway someone pointed out something interesting.

447
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:37,800
Speaker 0: because well one they were so expensive because they were self-cleaning.

448
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:45,124
Speaker 0: It would have been cheaper to hire like two or three janitors per thing 20 all year round.

449
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:51,000
Speaker 0: you can have janitors going to these things every hour to making sure there's no hobos in them and washing them.

450
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a problem in that in the u.s.

451
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,340
Speaker 1: You know minimum wage is going up, but it's still pretty low.

452
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:05,705
Speaker 1: It's cheaper to hire people to do menial labor than to automate very, you know, unless it's you know Extremely mass-produced.

453
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:10,440
Speaker 0: I have a feeling as a result that the city just basically took a wash on these.

454
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:14,860
Speaker 0: Perhaps they there was some shadiness because they spent way too much money.

455
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:18,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then I wondered, you know, like why did they spend so much money?

456
00:30:19,336 --> 00:30:20,520
Speaker 0: Why does this work in France?

457
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:22,660
Speaker 0: Why do they work just fine in Paris and not here?

458
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,624
Speaker 0: What is the difference?

459
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:26,880
Speaker 0: and someone on slash that actually pointed out something very interesting?

460
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,662
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

461
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:29,393
Speaker 0: They had to be handicapped accessible.

462
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:36,236
Speaker 0: as a result They were very very large and very comfortable for people to do stuff inside of them.

463
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:38,382
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm in Paris.

464
00:30:38,824 --> 00:30:41,796
Speaker 0: they're not handicapped acceptable accessible at all.

465
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:42,760
Speaker 0: They're tiny.

466
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:46,260
Speaker 0: They're just big enough to do your business and get in and out if you're in a wheelchair.

467
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,802
Speaker 0: You're screwed.

468
00:30:46,842 --> 00:30:48,429
Speaker 0: now the way they get around.

469
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:54,220
Speaker 0: that is instead of America where you have the American You know the disabilities act that requires everything to be handicapped accessible.

470
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:58,707
Speaker 0: They have normal ones all over the place But then also all over the place.

471
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:05,959
Speaker 0: apparently they have special handicapped accessible outdoor restrooms That you can't get into without a handicapped card.

472
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:16,939
Speaker 0: Oh and if you if you ever pry if you're handicapped if you have a disability the government gives you a card that Opens up all these handicapped accessible things like public toilets, huh?

473
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,100
Speaker 0: The odds of a handicapped accessible toilet being used by hobos and prostitutes is greatly reduced as a result.

474
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:27,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean they would have to get the card somehow.

475
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:31,340
Speaker 1: But then again, I see a lot of like hobos and wheelchairs.

476
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:37,617
Speaker 0: They could probably get the card But at the same time that's still a small percentage of a hobos overall and I think they would.

477
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:38,480
Speaker 0: they would work a lot better.

478
00:31:38,821 --> 00:31:47,129
Speaker 0: Maybe I guess I just I feel like there there has to be a solution to the fact that I often have to pee in Public and I have oftentimes.

479
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:55,180
Speaker 0: in fact on more than one occasion I peed somewhere near a train station in Yonkers because there was nowhere else to pee.

480
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:58,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, they really had to do something about that.

481
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:03,857
Speaker 0: in fact I pee outside a lot just in case anyone wondered Perhaps you may have seen me.

482
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:13,051
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's get right into things of the day now.

483
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,680
Speaker 0: You might have seen what we're talking about.

484
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:19,140
Speaker 0: I'm sad we went so long on the non main bit bits because I'm really excited about this.

485
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
Speaker 0: This is something that I've spent a lot of time on but me too.

486
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:45,149
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is directly related to this and it is a nostalgia video of a ton of games From a ton of different TI calculators over the years and it shows like games on the TI 82 to the TI 92 plus the 83 plus the 89 All these different games, you know Mario 1 on the TI whatever Alien strike aspirin.

487
00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:46,474
Speaker 0: remember that drug wars game.

488
00:32:47,036 --> 00:32:47,860
Speaker 1: I love drug wars.

489
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:50,369
Speaker 0: It was quite a nostalgia trip.

490
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:51,072
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

491
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:52,840
Speaker 1: All right, so check this out.

492
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:55,430
Speaker 1: I was complaining a little while ago right?

493
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:04,020
Speaker 1: that if you want ringtones for your iPhone or whatever You got to pay money like a dollar to then you got it first You're gonna buy a song on iTunes then you got to pay a dollar to turn into ringtone.

494
00:33:04,542 --> 00:33:10,440
Speaker 1: But if you have the new version of garage bad, not the version we have, you know that we can't upgrade without paying money.

495
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:19,259
Speaker 1: But the old the new version that comes leopard you can turn pretty much any mp3 or any audio you can make Into an iPhone ringtone with garage band for free.

496
00:33:20,341 --> 00:33:22,469
Speaker 1: But if you use Windows what the fuck you supposed to do?

497
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:25,139
Speaker 1: Well, someone made a program called I ringer.

498
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,095
Speaker 1: it Convert songs into iPhone ringtones.

499
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:32,307
Speaker 1: It just works day to day All right.

500
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:39,992
Speaker 1: So for the main bit Back in the day, you know when I was in high school Right when rim was also in high school.

501
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:44,063
Speaker 1: He's the same age as me I'm a little older not much.

502
00:33:44,143 --> 00:33:45,986
Speaker 1: We didn't have iPods.

503
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:48,068
Speaker 1: They didn't really exist so much.

504
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:56,194
Speaker 0: and we didn't have Cellphones cuz they were you know, well, I had one but it's not like the cell phones you used It's not like now.

505
00:33:56,435 --> 00:34:04,748
Speaker 1: it was basically a non-functional brick and we had game boys But they're in me, you know, maybe even GBA is getting you know later on.

506
00:34:04,869 --> 00:34:06,550
Speaker 0: but no I didn't have a GBA Game Boy Color.

507
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:07,453
Speaker 1: I had but I didn't.

508
00:34:07,533 --> 00:34:12,270
Speaker 0: I had a Game Boy and a game gear and you know what it didn't matter because you realize back.

509
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:18,949
Speaker 0: Then you kids I don't know some high schools are probably still like this if I brought my Game Boy to school They would take that shit away.

510
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,534
Speaker 1: so You have that shit.

511
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:24,927
Speaker 0: They took away my Walkman my cassette Walkman Wow.

512
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:25,869
Speaker 1: Okay, we had Discman.

513
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,974
Speaker 1: actually They didn't take them away.

514
00:34:26,994 --> 00:34:29,484
Speaker 0: I had a cassette Walkman when I was I think a junior.

515
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:30,730
Speaker 0: I bought a disc Walkman.

516
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:40,205
Speaker 1: yeah, they never took any of my music players away, but but even so Discman were pretty rough and Really portable, you know laptops.

517
00:34:40,226 --> 00:34:40,768
Speaker 1: Give me a break.

518
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,018
Speaker 0: There was one kid.

519
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,664
Speaker 0: He had like a 486 laptop.

520
00:34:44,771 --> 00:34:46,802
Speaker 0: It was gigantic and he brought it to school.

521
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:47,967
Speaker 1: battery lasted for 30 minutes.

522
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:53,710
Speaker 0: I remember he'd bring it on the bus and he'd like play games on it for like 10 minutes and then the battery would die.

523
00:34:53,813 --> 00:34:58,230
Speaker 1: Yeah So there wasn't so much portable computing going on.

524
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:03,104
Speaker 1: It's pretty much get home use your desktop get to go to the computer lab use the machines there.

525
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:05,010
Speaker 1: There's no wireless internets.

526
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:06,768
Speaker 1: It was all wired internet.

527
00:35:06,808 --> 00:35:09,880
Speaker 1: So Not too much options for computing.

528
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:26,497
Speaker 1: the only computing device that you had Was calculator and in high school You know when you started learning more better maths like stuff beyond geometry like say trigonometry or calculus is They required Graphing calculator.

529
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,570
Speaker 0: I'm sure I mean we have a lot of high school listeners.

530
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:32,204
Speaker 0: I'm sure you all own whatever the current TI calculator is.

531
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the.

532
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,475
Speaker 0: it's that thing You're gonna spend a lot.

533
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,530
Speaker 0: your parents are gonna spend a lot of money on in high school.

534
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:37,677
Speaker 0: You're gonna use it.

535
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:39,590
Speaker 0: really not that much money like a hundred bucks.

536
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna use it once or twice in college and then you're gonna lose it.

537
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,354
Speaker 1: I never use money.

538
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:47,350
Speaker 1: god, I guess I did use someone's 89 in college a couple times.

539
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:47,591
Speaker 1: I

540
00:35:47,731 --> 00:36:00,846
Speaker 0: used it in college because I was forced to take a stupid math class that I didn't want to take in my senior year Because they said yeah You need a math credit because we decided suddenly that we're not gonna give you full credit for your calculus C test.

541
00:36:01,066 --> 00:36:01,568
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

542
00:36:02,109 --> 00:36:06,770
Speaker 1: so Everyone was sort of forced to buy these things as a class requirement.

543
00:36:07,695 --> 00:36:12,823
Speaker 1: And I don't know if you want to go over the history of DTI Into that because I sort of know it.

544
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:14,090
Speaker 1: see the real important thing.

545
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,117
Speaker 1: I'll just to sum it up.

546
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:35,535
Speaker 1: TI made some you know Fancy calculators and then they actually listen to what teachers had to say and they designed the calculators such To match what teachers taught and then they backed it up by providing teaching Materials on top of that and then teaching tools on top of that and they basically created this huge Educational platform.

547
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:39,670
Speaker 1: on top of their calculators they had overhead displays that work with the calculators.

548
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:40,853
Speaker 1: They had a sign.

549
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:46,470
Speaker 1: they had sensors like thingies for science class and physics and chemistry that work with the calculators.

550
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,959
Speaker 0: Thanks didn't work for shit though.

551
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:49,005
Speaker 1: Those things work pretty great.

552
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:49,750
Speaker 1: ours were great.

553
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:51,980
Speaker 1: Now we even work with the graphing programs.

554
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,944
Speaker 0: ours didn't work at all.

555
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,210
Speaker 0: Of course worked awesomely.

556
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:54,774
Speaker 0: We didn't really.

557
00:36:54,835 --> 00:36:56,609
Speaker 0: I mean we didn't use them and I mean they didn't work.

558
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:00,990
Speaker 0: So we actually had real equipment that we use like we just use big oscilloscopes to do everything.

559
00:37:01,573 --> 00:37:03,605
Speaker 1: So we actually had you know the sensors.

560
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:04,410
Speaker 1: we had actually worked.

561
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,465
Speaker 1: You mostly used them like the temperature sensor and that sort of stuff.

562
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:08,410
Speaker 0: We just had thermometers.

563
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,914
Speaker 1: yeah, we actually.

564
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:30,332
Speaker 1: it was cool because you'd plug it in and then a graph would show up on your calculator and then you plug The calculator to the computer and it would transfer the graph to the computer And then you'd print it out and put it on your report and then you get an A. Anyway, so they built this huge platform on top of these calculators and in my school the calculator They told everyone to buy was the TI 83.

565
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,195
Speaker 0: Ah, you're the suck.

566
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,684
Speaker 0: our school required in 85 or you couldn't do anything.

567
00:37:33,864 --> 00:37:35,514
Speaker 0: our school told everyone to buy the 80.

568
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:43,490
Speaker 0: No they told if you were on the track of not going to college or if you were on the track of Not making it to calculus in high school.

569
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:47,890
Speaker 0: Then they told you to buy the 83 and and basically had to buy the 83 in middle school.

570
00:37:48,496 --> 00:37:52,664
Speaker 0: But if you were in the high school Then you were on any sort of other track like the Cal track.

571
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:53,970
Speaker 0: you're gonna take any of the real classes.

572
00:37:54,532 --> 00:38:00,090
Speaker 0: You had to buy an 85 or when the 86 was out you could buy an 86 because it was similarly functional.

573
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,095
Speaker 0: It's basically the same thing.

574
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,985
Speaker 1: They didn't you know, we didn't have.

575
00:38:03,045 --> 00:38:03,910
Speaker 1: our school was like that.

576
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:12,910
Speaker 1: They basically told everyone to buy the 83. now The 83 was a calculator that TI actually made after the 85 and what it was weaker though wasn't as good.

577
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,934
Speaker 1: Yes, it was weaker.

578
00:38:13,954 --> 00:38:22,330
Speaker 1: The idea was the teachers looked at the 85 and they said that has a lot of stuff We're not gonna use and a lot of the stuff we will use isn't polished enough.

579
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:30,798
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like it was like the Apple and where they reduced functionality and reduced other features But streamlined what they did keep.

580
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:32,584
Speaker 1: yes, it was basically algebra.

581
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:35,960
Speaker 1: teachers love the 83. thus That's what they told everyone to get.

582
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:36,302
Speaker 0: Yeah.

583
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:37,188
Speaker 0: See the thing is algebra.

584
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,620
Speaker 0: I mean most people took algebra in eighth grade.

585
00:38:39,701 --> 00:38:40,264
Speaker 0: when our school.

586
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:42,332
Speaker 0: so get to high school You need the real.

587
00:38:42,413 --> 00:38:47,710
Speaker 1: well those algebra 2 and geometry and trigonometry and for all those things the 83 was still the business.

588
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:52,227
Speaker 0: The thing is the 83 couldn't do anything geometry wise that the 85 couldn't do better, right?

589
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:57,990
Speaker 1: So If I was a smart kid, and I went and I looked at these calculators and said, you know, what?

590
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,542
Speaker 1: Why should I get that 83 that everyone else is getting?

591
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:02,487
Speaker 1: I'm a nerdy kid.

592
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:03,190
Speaker 1: I know better.

593
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:08,310
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get the 86 which has three or four times more memory than any of these other calculators.

594
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:10,470
Speaker 0: 86 and the 85 are basically the same.

595
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:18,701
Speaker 0: I mean the 86 had an updated OS and it had more memory but that was somewhat misleading because it had More really shit slow memory.

596
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,710
Speaker 1: It actually wasn't slower memory.

597
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:28,911
Speaker 0: No, it was the same kind of memory But it actually had two different memory banks that had a fast memory and kind of a slower storage memory and it would swap Them.

598
00:39:29,112 --> 00:39:32,110
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't the problem of swapping was the problem.

599
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,658
Speaker 1: It couldn't address the same number of memories.

600
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:35,400
Speaker 1: So I had to flip.

601
00:39:36,002 --> 00:39:43,670
Speaker 0: the TI 85 also had these secondary memories But but the TI 85 could access its memory on average a lot faster and they both had the same speed processor.

602
00:39:43,931 --> 00:39:57,470
Speaker 1: Yep, though like most of these calculators all had the same z80 processors which are actually part of the reason that there is so much awesome things you can do with these calculators because z80 Processors if you want to learn some assemblies z80 is the business.

603
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:08,406
Speaker 1: it's real simple and pretty much run-of-the-mill and you can program all sorts of shit for it and Once you learn that you're ready for some jobs in the world of assembly programming.

604
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:09,470
Speaker 1: I'm getting many chips.

605
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:12,384
Speaker 0: I remember when I actually when I actually bought my 85 the 86 was not out.

606
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:17,630
Speaker 0: yet No one had an 86. an 86 came out and everyone got him in there.

607
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:26,598
Speaker 0: And the thing is people had 86 is actually ran into a lot of trouble because certain graphing functions just because the way the memory Was addressed like especially if you were doing difficube.

608
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:29,627
Speaker 0: We're way slower and you just couldn't do it.

609
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:30,229
Speaker 0: Basically.

610
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:36,777
Speaker 1: Well I didn't have problems with that because I mostly use my 86 for Programming and games.

611
00:40:36,817 --> 00:40:39,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is I never did the assembly programming because I never had the link.

612
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,063
Speaker 1: I did a little bit but it was.

613
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:41,790
Speaker 1: it's not easy.

614
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:42,936
Speaker 0: But here's the thing now.

615
00:40:43,036 --> 00:40:45,227
Speaker 0: you kids can't get away with this these days for the most part.

616
00:40:45,287 --> 00:40:49,078
Speaker 0: but back then Teachers in high schools did not understand.

617
00:40:49,139 --> 00:40:52,510
Speaker 0: you realize that the calculator was a multi-purpose device.

618
00:40:52,611 --> 00:40:54,589
Speaker 0: They thought it was a calculator or nothing more.

619
00:40:55,156 --> 00:41:03,276
Speaker 0: so a lot of times kids would like in French class just whip out their calculator and start poking at it during a test and Most teachers didn't think anything of that.

620
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:06,809
Speaker 0: They didn't even conceive that the calculator could be used to cheat.

621
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:14,429
Speaker 0: Meanwhile Rim here wrote French dictionary and gave it to everyone in the school for a small fee.

622
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:20,110
Speaker 0: Aha, it even had copy protection because it you know, it said you don't made by rim blah blah blah.

623
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:21,374
Speaker 0: Here's my website.

624
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,068
Speaker 0: And if anyone tried to change that page it gave wrong answers.

625
00:41:25,088 --> 00:41:26,677
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, here's the thing.

626
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,450
Speaker 1: because in my school, right?

627
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:36,750
Speaker 1: We bought the graph link Which is basically a serial parallel cable went from the computer to the calculator and we were loading up the programs big time.

628
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,178
Speaker 0: Oh see the way our school worked is.

629
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:40,290
Speaker 1: we actually had cross calculator links.

630
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:45,330
Speaker 1: So you'd send you one guy would get all the stuff from the internet and then transfer it to other people.

631
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:46,210
Speaker 0: That was how we did it.

632
00:41:46,250 --> 00:42:00,410
Speaker 0: But remember the only way to get the assembly things on if you didn't have the computer link you basically had to get someone else to load up all the stuff like the OS and the menu and Then he would basically wipe out your calculator and give you over the cross link an image of his calculator.

633
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:02,060
Speaker 1: No, we didn't have to do it that way.

634
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,811
Speaker 1: We could just at least with the 86.

635
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:04,514
Speaker 1: We didn't have to do that.

636
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:05,981
Speaker 1: we find over the program.

637
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:06,464
Speaker 0: you could do.

638
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:12,236
Speaker 0: you could just send over the programs But to get the menu to show up in the way where you could hide it from a teacher You had to give the image.

639
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:13,425
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a hide from a teacher.

640
00:42:13,465 --> 00:42:15,373
Speaker 1: Yes now Here's the thing.

641
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:16,758
Speaker 1: Some of the teachers are smart.

642
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:22,021
Speaker 1: I had teachers that knew the calculators are loaded with Tetris Yep, I remember in difficult class one day.

643
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,770
Speaker 0: The teacher was like in high school.

644
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,320
Speaker 0: He was like, alright You can use the calculator on this test because we had to.

645
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:36,866
Speaker 0: we always broke up the test into the hardcore math test And the kind of theory knowledge test like it was a multiple-choice essay test about math.

646
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:42,063
Speaker 0: and on that test He'd said you can't use a calculator unless you let me wipe out your calculator.

647
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:46,548
Speaker 0: and you know when you want to wipe out a calculator There's the menu you go through and it takes you to a special thing.

648
00:42:47,312 --> 00:43:00,286
Speaker 1: Well, we all wrote a program that you'd run that looked exactly like that menu Exactly that actually download a program like that and it basically the program Fooled the teacher into thinking you had to raise the calculator.

649
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:05,066
Speaker 1: like the one teacher I remember walked around the room and said show me the screen that says memory erased.

650
00:43:05,106 --> 00:43:05,909
Speaker 1: and we all showed it.

651
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:08,016
Speaker 1: and Then I used the program.

652
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,567
Speaker 1: I wrote which factored polynomials and so do my friends.

653
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:11,250
Speaker 1: and we all got A's.

654
00:43:11,531 --> 00:43:13,958
Speaker 0: We all wrote the program the factored polynomials.

655
00:43:14,038 --> 00:43:16,145
Speaker 1: Everyone wrote the polynomial factoring program.

656
00:43:16,326 --> 00:43:17,730
Speaker 0: Actually mine was multifunction.

657
00:43:17,912 --> 00:43:18,779
Speaker 0: I could do a lot more.

658
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:29,085
Speaker 1: I wrote a really complex one Ax to the something power plus BX plus C and you just put a the something power the B and the C and then it Tells you the number and you just go.

659
00:43:29,166 --> 00:43:34,596
Speaker 0: There you go Yep, but see here's there's the real gist of this and kids can still do this today But it's it.

660
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,110
Speaker 0: it's kind of a lost art.

661
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,396
Speaker 0: I mean it's people still do it.

662
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:43,690
Speaker 0: but it's a lost art because teachers are more tech savvy and Like if you have an iPhone you can just use the calculator for a lot of things.

663
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,410
Speaker 0: But at the same time these calculators are very purpose-built.

664
00:43:47,832 --> 00:44:01,830
Speaker 0: And while you can do a lot of this math like the differential equations and the Radial graphing and the complex graphing and all these sorts of things With a computer all these other things the calculator does it really well and it's really built to do that.

665
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:06,384
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean try doing that stuff like try doing that graphing on your computer.

666
00:44:06,404 --> 00:44:07,607
Speaker 1: What software you gonna use?

667
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:09,928
Speaker 1: MATLAB Which cost a zillion dollars?

668
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:32,990
Speaker 1: Excel, I don't know the the graph thing that's built into your Apple OS X There aren't really, you know, if you want to do a lot of these basic Mathematic functions, I guess the sort of ones that are above standard calculator and above scientific calculator But below like wicked crazy mathematical model of amazingness

669
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:33,658
Speaker 0: Well, you know what I would

670
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:33,799
Speaker 1: use.

671
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,541
Speaker 1: graphing calculator Does it better than a lot of the software that you can get.

672
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:39,750
Speaker 0: I would use new calc and you can do a lot.

673
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,419
Speaker 0: It's really powerful and you can do a lot with it.

674
00:44:41,439 --> 00:44:46,801
Speaker 0: I actually use it use BC also Yeah, but it just in terms of quickness and access.

675
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:52,878
Speaker 0: the calculator especially like the TI 85 86 is So well designed for that purpose.

676
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:58,718
Speaker 0: The 89 is actually not as good for some of the lower-level math But it's a lot better for the very high level.

677
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:06,430
Speaker 1: Well, here's what happened is the 85 was sort of like the Original in a way and then you know, the algebra teacher said it's too much.

678
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,569
Speaker 1: They went the 82 the 83 that was down for them, right?

679
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:15,192
Speaker 1: But the calculus people the next step up they wanted the 89 the 92.

680
00:45:15,192 --> 00:45:16,118
Speaker 0: Well, the 89 can.

681
00:45:16,138 --> 00:45:20,079
Speaker 0: that's how come the big fat one Big fat one.

682
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:21,230
Speaker 0: Oh the 89 was the big fat.

683
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,220
Speaker 1: No, the 92 is the big fat one of.

684
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,261
Speaker 1: the 89 was the same size as all the others But it had a lot of the 92 functionality.

685
00:45:27,663 --> 00:45:27,924
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

686
00:45:27,985 --> 00:45:28,930
Speaker 1: I'm a hundred percent sure.

687
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,521
Speaker 0: I thought it was the other way around.

688
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:31,610
Speaker 1: the 92 is the big fat one.

689
00:45:31,731 --> 00:45:33,029
Speaker 1: That was like almost like a laptop.

690
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,973
Speaker 0: There were people who went to a special about these special classes out of my high school and I skipped on him because I realized They were a scam.

691
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:42,225
Speaker 0: but basically they had to have the full-on calculator.

692
00:45:42,245 --> 00:45:43,470
Speaker 0: the 85 wouldn't cut it now.

693
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,303
Speaker 1: But the 89 came out, you know too late.

694
00:45:46,363 --> 00:45:47,870
Speaker 1: I guess they had the 89 when you were at RIT.

695
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:53,325
Speaker 0: I used it for I borrowed someones and use it on a couple tests borrowed mine I bought it cuz I had a bunch of money and I was like, ooh 89.

696
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,050
Speaker 0: I'll do crazy math.

697
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,342
Speaker 1: Yeah, the 89 had a lot of the calculus like it could derive like.

698
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,195
Speaker 1: it didn't just derive like, you know You know give you the number.

699
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:03,359
Speaker 1: It derived.

700
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:11,610
Speaker 0: Well, now you type in a thing and there it is Symbolically, yes, it does symbolic logic as opposed to simply numeric logic.

701
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,570
Speaker 1: Yes, it could do symbolic equation solve and it did it with pretty print like better almost as good as course.

702
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:25,682
Speaker 0: here is the problem with those calculators and a lot of kids who try to use them to be fancy, but basically they could solve anything that you could solve trivially.

703
00:46:25,743 --> 00:46:29,781
Speaker 0: if you knew even basic calculus and The things that you had trouble solving.

704
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:31,170
Speaker 0: they also had trouble solving.

705
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:37,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, they would sit there for a long time and then they would come up with something But it wouldn't help you actually get the right answer.

706
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:39,077
Speaker 1: You'd still need to do work to honestly kids.

707
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:45,639
Speaker 0: if you're in high school now by an 85 or an 86 Probably 85 and 86 are not available anymore.

708
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,584
Speaker 0: You can get them trivially on a heavy Bay.

709
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,248
Speaker 1: I guess you can really.

710
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:54,319
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, oh man I remember the the trials of battery charging like cuz.

711
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:56,746
Speaker 1: basically rail vac made these rechargeable triple a.

712
00:46:56,826 --> 00:46:59,869
Speaker 0: everyone who've used rechargeable batteries My school had problems all the time.

713
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,475
Speaker 0: I just bought double A's.

714
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:04,204
Speaker 1: people were constantly basically the school.

715
00:47:04,224 --> 00:47:08,457
Speaker 1: I guess when they bought the Calculators gave everyone these batteries.

716
00:47:08,517 --> 00:47:09,580
Speaker 0: school about calculators.

717
00:47:09,881 --> 00:47:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had to buy the calculator or you basically were screwed.

718
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,865
Speaker 0: Well, you could buy it through the school, but the school wasn't any cheaper.

719
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:16,850
Speaker 0: They just go into the store.

720
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:17,493
Speaker 1: No wasn't.

721
00:47:17,554 --> 00:47:20,590
Speaker 1: but at the school got all these chargers and all these batteries.

722
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:26,448
Speaker 1: everyone was using chargers and batteries all the time and you'd be like coming to math class and put their batteries in the charger.

723
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:30,261
Speaker 1: and I just sort of asked and teacher gave me the charger.

724
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:31,425
Speaker 1: So I died.

725
00:47:31,445 --> 00:47:32,870
Speaker 1: I had like three sets of batteries.

726
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,275
Speaker 0: Batteries sucked.

727
00:47:35,617 --> 00:47:36,723
Speaker 0: I would put double A's in there.

728
00:47:36,743 --> 00:47:37,910
Speaker 0: They'd last for like a charge.

729
00:47:38,192 --> 00:47:41,030
Speaker 1: Basically the batteries didn't last for crap at all.

730
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,847
Speaker 1: That's why people were recharging them constantly and they'd have like power strips and all the math classes and everything.

731
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:49,090
Speaker 0: and wow Actually, I like my high school was kind of funny.

732
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:56,064
Speaker 0: The policy was if your calculator ran out of batteries during a test you're done Deal with it, that's rough.

733
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,133
Speaker 1: That's rough Of course I can.

734
00:47:58,173 --> 00:48:02,426
Speaker 0: I was actually really infamous at my high school because I wrote all these crazy programs like.

735
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:03,610
Speaker 0: I wrote this thing.

736
00:48:04,032 --> 00:48:07,710
Speaker 0: That was this crazy menu program that had every physics equation ever.

737
00:48:08,332 --> 00:48:30,629
Speaker 0: And the thing is it did Euler's method instead of the kind of kinematic thing that a lot of physics teachers teach now Which I. I'm of the mind that Euler's method teaches better physics fundamentals and better algebraic fundamentals, but I digress Mm-hmm, but I wrote this program that you would kind of say what kind of problem you're trying to solve and it had all the fundamental equations for everything in it and it was massive.

738
00:48:30,649 --> 00:48:40,349
Speaker 0: and It got passed around and passed around and passed around to the point that eventually the school Banned my program from class

739
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,152
Speaker 1: Because

740
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:49,798
Speaker 0: the like the math the physics classes were all dead theory tests and they had doing tests and in the theory tests They wanted people to use calculators.

741
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:56,370
Speaker 0: They didn't want them to have the equations available Mm-hmm, so because they wanted you to kind of know the fundamental.

742
00:48:56,431 --> 00:49:04,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a big problem in that You know, I could understand, you know, if I download say a program all the equations in it What does that really get me?

743
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,470
Speaker 1: Well, it saves me from having to memorize the equations and it saves me for doing the busy work.

744
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:12,544
Speaker 1: But if I don't understand what's going on, it's still not gonna help me.

745
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:13,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kind of will.

746
00:49:14,373 --> 00:49:19,821
Speaker 1: I mean, here's the thing and if I wrote the program Then that proves I understand it.

747
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:21,289
Speaker 1: So what's the point of making me guess?

748
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:25,330
Speaker 0: Because everyone else just got the program for me and didn't make the program.

749
00:49:25,471 --> 00:49:32,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like even though even though I wrote the polynomial factoring program They still didn't like it and I just really never understood that it's a big one.

750
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:37,230
Speaker 1: Look, I wrote this you just give me an A and not let make me stay in the stupid class.

751
00:49:37,663 --> 00:49:39,154
Speaker 0: Yep But the thing was the.

752
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:43,368
Speaker 0: the theory tests were designed such that you could figure them out trivially.

753
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:45,035
Speaker 0: if you were smart You just had to sit there.

754
00:49:45,055 --> 00:49:51,463
Speaker 0: if you knew the theory you could derive the equations from thin air But I had the equations in my calculator because I was done with that.

755
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:52,970
Speaker 0: I'd already derived all the equations.

756
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:53,433
Speaker 0: Yep.

757
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:54,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

758
00:49:54,278 --> 00:49:56,229
Speaker 0: then I wrote the masking program that hit it.

759
00:49:56,571 --> 00:50:02,730
Speaker 0: But then I told the physics teacher how to detect my masking program in return for him letting me use my own program.

760
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:07,770
Speaker 0: That was the best of the best days in my life because I remember there's this huge test.

761
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:10,346
Speaker 0: It was like this midterm and it accounted for like 30% of our grade.

762
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,023
Speaker 0: It was a curve and everyone came into class and was.

763
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:18,430
Speaker 0: he goes he goes around and you know He does the check and everyone's calculator and he goes to mine.

764
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:33,010
Speaker 0: He goes and goes and when he hit the first person who was using my masking program He hit the escape key and he says well insert name here I see you have rims program and the look of horror on his face.

765
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:35,199
Speaker 0: Were you trying to hide this for me?

766
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:37,829
Speaker 0: Uh, no, I don't know how it got there.

767
00:50:38,252 --> 00:50:41,329
Speaker 0: Well, uh, I see that you're running rim mask.

768
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:43,708
Speaker 0: Where'd you get this?

769
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:52,095
Speaker 0: And then he looks around the room and he could tell because half the class sitting there going what he he he and half the class Is going oh shit.

770
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:52,398
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

771
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:53,729
Speaker 0: Oh shit type type type type type type.

772
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,820
Speaker 0: Almost everyone in the class failed that test.

773
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,629
Speaker 0: it was one of the great was one of my triumphs.

774
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:08,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I imagine that nowadays, you know They probably newer calculators like I've seen like stuff like the ti-83 plus silver platinum edition and crazy shit.

775
00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:15,930
Speaker 1: and You know, I'm pretty sure the people in the schools are still using TI graphing calculators and there's still the bomb.

776
00:51:16,372 --> 00:51:20,510
Speaker 1: But you probably don't care about running games on them anymore cuz they have DS's and iPhones and iPods.

777
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,983
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand how important those games were to us back then.

778
00:51:24,063 --> 00:51:25,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, because again, it's the golden ticket.

779
00:51:26,031 --> 00:51:28,550
Speaker 0: No one knew what your calculator was doing except for smart people.

780
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:34,770
Speaker 0: Yes, so in you know math class the teacher looks around and he thinks oh wow, everyone's really trying hard on their homework.

781
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:40,650
Speaker 0: No, I was totally playing pong with the link cable with the guy behind me every day.

782
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:45,449
Speaker 1: Yep, so you people have the calculators and aren't having enough fun with them.

783
00:51:45,891 --> 00:51:47,619
Speaker 1: You should go to ti calc org.

784
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:50,030
Speaker 1: that is pretty much the site and the site.

785
00:51:50,131 --> 00:51:52,221
Speaker 1: I just went to it for the first time in a long time.

786
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,950
Speaker 1: It is still updating.

787
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,112
Speaker 1: Hardcore.

788
00:51:55,152 --> 00:51:57,861
Speaker 1: the community is still rocking the house if you have a chance.

789
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,550
Speaker 1: site hasn't changed since I was in high school.

790
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,576
Speaker 1: This is like a 10 year old website here.

791
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:09,897
Speaker 1: If you have a ti-85 still I highly recommend you 80 anything No, or 90 and 85 specifically.

792
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:12,063
Speaker 0: it is trivial to overclock it.

793
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,390
Speaker 1: Oh, it's trivial to overclock a lot of these things.

794
00:52:14,413 --> 00:52:17,719
Speaker 0: Yeah The 85 more so and you can get a solid 4x.

795
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:30,170
Speaker 0: and I'll tell you one thing if you have an 85 that is overclocked And you were still if you're an engineer you're doing any sort of math On a daily basis that thing is gonna be your lifeblood once again, because it is so fast.

796
00:52:30,912 --> 00:52:32,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know they didn't.

797
00:52:32,137 --> 00:52:35,410
Speaker 1: oh, they didn't clock a lot of these things as fast as they could go for whatever reason.

798
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:42,510
Speaker 1: But I've seen like overclocked 86. is that like they claimed like 200 X and it they're pretty fast.

799
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:43,696
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's 200 X.

800
00:52:43,716 --> 00:52:45,566
Speaker 0: Well now those people had some cooling.

801
00:52:45,606 --> 00:52:46,290
Speaker 0: that was unjustifiable.

802
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:51,090
Speaker 1: But basically it's like hey take out this resistor and suddenly everything's fast.

803
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:54,544
Speaker 0: The key is make sure you do the mod that has the switch so you can on overclock it.

804
00:52:54,584 --> 00:52:56,311
Speaker 1: cuz all the how-tos are NT.

805
00:52:56,351 --> 00:53:02,010
Speaker 0: I caught that or yeah, but some of those programs especially some of the older games will not work with an overclock day.

806
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:02,634
Speaker 1: Well, they will.

807
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:04,970
Speaker 1: they just be stupidly fast and those broken.

808
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is it started out like a lot of these programs.

809
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,970
Speaker 1: just be like Tetris, you know text-based game.

810
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,816
Speaker 1: That's written in the basic not the assembly.

811
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:15,625
Speaker 0: Yeah drug wars drug wars was like the most popular game.

812
00:53:15,646 --> 00:53:23,995
Speaker 1: drug wars is pretty good But later on it was like Megaman Zelda Wolfenstein 3d.

813
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:26,850
Speaker 1: it was getting hardcore wicked hardcore.

814
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,692
Speaker 0: It's good times Yeah and the thing is there.

815
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:37,177
Speaker 0: there was this culture of the people who were smarter than the teachers and were in the know were Hacking these things like no tomorrow.

816
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:47,290
Speaker 0: I learned more from hacking my ti-85 and Cleverly cheating on tests that I ever would have learned with any other tool and I feel like some of that is lost on kids.

817
00:53:47,672 --> 00:53:51,990
Speaker 1: But at the same time I definitely feel like the generation before us, right?

818
00:53:52,150 --> 00:54:06,710
Speaker 1: those were like the Steve Jobs's and the Bill Gates's who had like Altair's and they had like, you know, they built the original Apple and they were hacking on these things like, you know Right in basic, you know all this stuff right then, you know, it kept going like that.

819
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:14,637
Speaker 1: But our generation we used the Apple twos early on and then later on we had the graphing calculator And we were using.

820
00:54:14,678 --> 00:54:16,370
Speaker 1: we were playing PC games on DOS.

821
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:19,790
Speaker 1: We had to fuck with DOS to get the PC games to work now.

822
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,330
Speaker 1: And that's how we were forced to learn, you know about computers.

823
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:29,046
Speaker 1: And I feel like the generations that came after us where they didn't care about their calculators.

824
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,090
Speaker 1: They were just calculators.

825
00:54:30,331 --> 00:54:33,098
Speaker 1: They had Windows 95 and it just worked.

826
00:54:33,378 --> 00:54:34,461
Speaker 1: games just worked.

827
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:36,707
Speaker 1: You know, they didn't grow up using a computer.

828
00:54:36,727 --> 00:54:39,474
Speaker 1: They never use a Computing device.

829
00:54:39,554 --> 00:54:45,878
Speaker 1: there were forced to use any sort of electronic device where they had to program It had to fiddle with it had to get down and dirty.

830
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:55,070
Speaker 1: and you can tell by looking at What those people of the different generations are doing on the internet their computing knowledge levels.

831
00:54:55,311 --> 00:54:57,098
Speaker 0: However, don't get us wrong.

832
00:54:57,539 --> 00:54:58,041
Speaker 0: We're not.

833
00:54:58,322 --> 00:55:00,310
Speaker 0: I would never say we have to go back to those days.

834
00:55:01,194 --> 00:55:03,826
Speaker 0: No, those days really sucked and it's much better now.

835
00:55:03,986 --> 00:55:04,810
Speaker 1: It is much better now.

836
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:16,142
Speaker 1: Look at the enrollments for you know CS as a major in college over time and you'll see that People who are forced, you know to use these things their generations.

837
00:55:16,182 --> 00:55:17,245
Speaker 0: They're still enrolling.

838
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,010
Speaker 0: the difference is they're failing.

839
00:55:21,075 --> 00:55:22,466
Speaker 1: I mean now enrollment is still down.

840
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:23,050
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

841
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:28,982
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but it's down in a lot of the tech fields for a lot of reasons But except for IT, but even then is gonna go down.

842
00:55:29,002 --> 00:55:31,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know.

843
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:42,905
Speaker 0: I feel like we need to foster a culture of Hacking and messing with technology which is because actually I see where this is coming back in The mod scene for like the DS using those are whatever chips.

844
00:55:43,347 --> 00:55:44,070
Speaker 1: Yeah some of that.

845
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:44,694
Speaker 1: There's a little bit.

846
00:55:44,715 --> 00:55:45,500
Speaker 1: that really though.

847
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:47,674
Speaker 1: That's a lot of drag-and-drop There's not a lot of.

848
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:48,698
Speaker 1: only the people are.

849
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:54,638
Speaker 1: actually most of the kids are just using they're not writing Different from what we did with the calculators.

850
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:55,823
Speaker 0: look back at the high schools.

851
00:55:56,064 --> 00:56:08,843
Speaker 0: there were like in my clean my high school You know we have like a thousand kids right and there were maybe 30 or 40 people who are writing all these programs and hacking them and Everyone else would go to these people and be like oh my god.

852
00:56:08,883 --> 00:56:10,027
Speaker 0: Can I have that game you got?

853
00:56:10,388 --> 00:56:17,310
Speaker 0: oh my god Can I have that physics program you wrote and they had no idea how they worked and they didn't know anything And they just they kind of just used it.

854
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:17,631
Speaker 0: It was it.

855
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:25,090
Speaker 0: I feel like it's the same way now and the kids who were hacking stuff today are the kids who are going To succeed at computer science and IT tomorrow.

856
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:31,669
Speaker 1: I think that something that we could do you know short of doing my you know true belief, which is that you know?

857
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,674
Speaker 1: Computing should be the fifth.

858
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:35,119
Speaker 1: You know basic subject.

859
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:36,223
Speaker 1: You know in all schools.

860
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:43,934
Speaker 1: It's elementary school to high school you know is Not just computer Technology in general.

861
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:47,846
Speaker 0: yeah, if we see schools should teach kids how to use online banking.

862
00:56:48,087 --> 00:56:48,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, how to type.

863
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,856
Speaker 0: well No elementary schools use how to type.

864
00:56:51,257 --> 00:56:54,729
Speaker 0: high schools should teach how to use Linux and Windows and Mac and everything.

865
00:56:54,809 --> 00:56:57,902
Speaker 1: yeah But we should have some sort of rule.

866
00:56:58,183 --> 00:57:03,363
Speaker 1: I mean where there's only one Technological device allowed in school, and this is it.

867
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:12,622
Speaker 1: and design it in such a way because right now A lot of the schools are like get a graphing calculator You know, but you can bring your iPod to school your phone and whatever and you know.

868
00:57:12,642 --> 00:57:15,390
Speaker 1: they'll maybe have real computers in the classroom.

869
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:16,454
Speaker 1: So I guess is good.

870
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,864
Speaker 1: You know or they'll have give everyone real laptops.

871
00:57:18,924 --> 00:57:22,359
Speaker 1: Maybe like Apple laptops We had to make some sort of laptop.

872
00:57:22,379 --> 00:57:26,738
Speaker 1: That's actually sort of down and dirty Where you kind of had to program it?

873
00:57:26,778 --> 00:57:29,510
Speaker 1: Maybe it runs like squeak and small talk or something?

874
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:29,952
Speaker 1: I don't know.

875
00:57:30,174 --> 00:57:32,248
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things that could run that do exist.

876
00:57:32,269 --> 00:57:43,070
Speaker 1: and You know instead of kids playing with Like stupid educational programming kindergarten give them logo like we had where you're forced to sort of program something a little bit.

877
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the the release.

878
00:57:44,656 --> 00:57:53,449
Speaker 0: your time when I've my first computer classes when they'd say like today's a free day The only thing you could play with was logo, and you would have to be clever if you wanted to have fun.

879
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:54,475
Speaker 1: Yep, in fact.

880
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:55,743
Speaker 0: You know what it seems like in general.

881
00:57:55,783 --> 00:58:05,501
Speaker 0: That's the idea is Instead of lockdown zero tolerance because if I pulled even half the shit today in high school Then I pulled when I was in high school.

882
00:58:05,561 --> 00:58:07,150
Speaker 0: I would have been expelled easily.

883
00:58:07,471 --> 00:58:11,145
Speaker 0: I mean I broke into the computers and fussed with things.

884
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:12,370
Speaker 0: I looked at my grades.

885
00:58:12,671 --> 00:58:16,082
Speaker 0: I showed my teacher how I could have changed my grades that I. but I didn't.

886
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:24,293
Speaker 0: I wrote programs that would like shut down all The computers during class and we'd laugh about it nowadays done jail Things have changed.

887
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:33,545
Speaker 0: I feel like you need to lock down to the point that Kids who are clever will get around the lockdown and instead of being malicious.

888
00:58:33,846 --> 00:58:43,362
Speaker 0: They'll be creative and funny Especially if you give them their own devices like you give everyone Some sort of lat like a cross between a laptop and a ti-85 some sort of.

889
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:47,798
Speaker 0: it's locked down just because it's complicated But yet it's still usable.

890
00:58:48,301 --> 00:58:52,169
Speaker 0: and if a kid pays attention in class They'll be able to do all their lessons and they'll learn.

891
00:58:52,832 --> 00:58:59,600
Speaker 0: but the kid who already learned the lesson and is bored will start fussing with it because he can't get there's nothing else to fucks with and he's bored.

892
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:14,510
Speaker 0: and by fostering this climate of the 10% of kids who are bored and clever will be so bored that they'll fucks with it and They'll learn more as a result is probably the best way to get an education to people who are smarter than their school.

893
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:28,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and this is actually a major problem when you look at a lot of technology We have today people like oh, you know, they're like, oh we don't need open source, you know I'm happy with my non open iPhone, you know, and well the iPhone.

894
00:59:28,651 --> 00:59:39,420
Speaker 1: Not only is the iPhone locked down to where you can't do anything that you you know Can't program for it without a kit and money and all that jazz But it can't program for itself.

895
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:45,761
Speaker 1: something very important about computing is Devices that have the ability to program themselves.

896
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:55,828
Speaker 1: You can't write an iPhone program on the iPhone You know, you need to be able to see 86. any TI calculator can write programs for itself while you're using it.

897
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't need to plug it into a basic handle.

898
00:59:58,899 --> 00:59:59,581
Speaker 0: It's like basic.

899
00:59:59,863 --> 01:00:01,167
Speaker 0: It's it's basically basic.

900
01:00:01,328 --> 01:00:06,384
Speaker 0: it is CI basic, but if you were smarter it had a bunch of functions you could use.

901
01:00:06,424 --> 01:00:07,387
Speaker 0: that did stuff.

902
01:00:07,588 --> 01:00:10,477
Speaker 1: Yep, but It's it's the divide.

903
01:00:10,498 --> 01:00:21,384
Speaker 1: the only way for people to actually learn Programming I think right is essentially for devices is there has to be a device that can program itself live.

904
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:23,074
Speaker 1: You know if it's.

905
01:00:23,355 --> 01:00:31,800
Speaker 1: you know, if you need a computer to program something and transfer it over, you know That's a necessary technology in the world But it's not something that people can learn with.

906
01:00:31,921 --> 01:00:32,383
Speaker 0: Oh granted.

907
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:40,330
Speaker 1: I need to have a device that they use Understand that device and then use that device on itself, but granted not everyone needs to be a programmer.

908
01:00:41,254 --> 01:00:45,430
Speaker 0: It's more the idea that give kids tools that can do their educational job in school.

909
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:50,587
Speaker 0: I'm forget consumer technology because at the same time I want my consumer technology to just fucking work.

910
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:51,350
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

911
01:00:51,450 --> 01:01:02,623
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when it comes to to educational stuff school It should be usable for the things that are being taught But extensible for the clever kids and you can apply this to non technology.

912
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:04,510
Speaker 0: look at in English class, right?

913
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:09,110
Speaker 0: You have the default assignment, you know read Hamlet and we'll do Hamlet.

914
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:21,854
Speaker 0: but for the kids who are bored set it up to where if they want they can choose to read something different and only offer this to the kids who kind of show promise and the kids were obviously bored or Only all like.

915
01:01:22,116 --> 01:01:22,981
Speaker 0: give kids the choice.

916
01:01:23,001 --> 01:01:24,630
Speaker 0: be like you finish your homework in class.

917
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,486
Speaker 0: Let's say if there's time left over you can't bring your calculator into class.

918
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,729
Speaker 0: You can't bring your phone You can't bring other classes homework or anything.

919
01:01:33,393 --> 01:01:41,870
Speaker 0: But there's a whole bunch of Greek literature in the back of the room and if you're bored Go on back there and if you read something and write a paper on it extra credit.

920
01:01:42,633 --> 01:01:44,059
Speaker 0: Yes, that's the sort of thing that you know.

921
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:48,640
Speaker 0: parochial school was terrible in a lot of ways But that was how it was set up when I was a kid.

922
01:01:48,982 --> 01:02:00,470
Speaker 0: if you finish your assignment in class All the extra free time the only thing you could do was either twiddle your thumbs like a moron or go to the back of the room and there would be classics to read and stuff to do.

923
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:10,209
Speaker 0: And if you were bored enough and smart enough and clever enough and you went back there and did these things You learned a hell of a lot more than that teacher was ever going to present to you.

924
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah And you need to offer these opportunities to kids who were bored without holding kids who aren't that clever or who aren't interested in that subject Without hopefully holding them to this high unattainable standard.

925
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:29,250
Speaker 0: I mean a kid who is good, you know They're a writer and they're creative and they want to draw and read and write but they're never gonna be a programmer.

926
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:31,196
Speaker 0: You don't force them to be a programmer.

927
01:02:31,357 --> 01:02:35,390
Speaker 0: You don't force them to learn TI basic in order to pass algebra one.

928
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:41,210
Speaker 0: Give them the device and then you kind of offer this room for expansion for kids who care in that field.

929
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:42,955
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is the same thing in every field.

930
01:02:43,035 --> 01:02:56,730
Speaker 1: This is why the TI calculator is such a beautiful educational device in that Primarily it is used for teaching the maths and it does teach the maths and if you are not clever It cannot be used for things other than math, right?

931
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,177
Speaker 1: But it has these other things it can do.

932
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:03,090
Speaker 1: it can do a lot of things and teachers never teach you about those things.

933
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:05,050
Speaker 1: They never tell you about those things.

934
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:16,370
Speaker 1: But kids who are bored and sit there and poke at their calculators because there's nothing else, you know to keep their attention We'll learn things on their own just playing where the device teaches itself.

935
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:21,623
Speaker 1: It is because it's so well designed and that is how technology helps in the classroom.

936
01:03:21,663 --> 01:03:27,140
Speaker 1: not having video screens instead of you know Chalkboard that doesn't really do that much every kid.

937
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:28,384
Speaker 0: a laptop doesn't help.

938
01:03:28,565 --> 01:03:29,810
Speaker 1: It doesn't help that much either.

939
01:03:30,271 --> 01:03:34,704
Speaker 1: You know, it's all about having devices that are designed in this clever awesome way.

940
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:40,389
Speaker 1: and if I have kids I'm probably gonna give them the TI calculator as well before high school when they're told to get them.

941
01:03:40,911 --> 01:03:43,039
Speaker 0: Yep, like here's one example or real quick.

942
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,983
Speaker 0: Let's look at the laptop.

943
01:03:44,023 --> 01:03:45,228
Speaker 0: typing like nowadays.

944
01:03:45,268 --> 01:03:45,810
Speaker 0: you type things.

945
01:03:45,951 --> 01:03:57,229
Speaker 0: I actually have trouble writing anything long But the way I learned how to write very well was that in high school We were forced to write essays extemporaneously in class with a pen.

946
01:03:58,092 --> 01:03:59,417
Speaker 0: Not even let's use a pencil.

947
01:03:59,437 --> 01:04:08,533
Speaker 0: you write it with a pen and then the next day they'd give it back to you and with corrections and you would have to rewrite it and write a better essay again in pen and Every like we'd have.

948
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,978
Speaker 0: these assignments were for a whole week.

949
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:11,825
Speaker 0: You'd write one essay every day.

950
01:04:11,866 --> 01:04:12,970
Speaker 0: You'd rewrite it better now.

951
01:04:14,394 --> 01:04:30,650
Speaker 0: No, that was an archaic horrible way to do things, but it worked back then I think like one way you could apply the principle to the future would be to have kids write essays But in a word processor that has change tracking enabled and not able to be turned off.

952
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:45,265
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm the idea that it you know, someone just writes the way they do normally, you know type type type erase type But it keeps this kind of record of the changes you have made and then force people to go through the changes They made and consider why they changed and what they changed.

953
01:04:45,325 --> 01:04:49,765
Speaker 0: and you know You got to be creative with using technology and then kids will learn a lot more.

954
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:53,866
Speaker 1: Yep Bats it's cool how the device teaches itself.

955
01:04:54,268 --> 01:04:55,694
Speaker 0: Yes I mean look like people.

956
01:04:55,714 --> 01:04:57,260
Speaker 0: the big deal with Bill Gates.

957
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:59,469
Speaker 0: that one of the he did at a pretty young age is.

958
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:01,458
Speaker 0: he wrote A basic compiler in basic.

959
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,916
Speaker 0: Yep, and that might sound dumb But that's that's kind of one of the tests of.

960
01:05:06,398 --> 01:05:07,421
Speaker 0: are you a good programmer?

961
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:09,930
Speaker 0: write a compiler in the language to compile itself?

962
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:14,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you can do that You've proven that you'll learn a lot along the way.

963
01:05:14,663 --> 01:05:24,092
Speaker 1: if you've never done something like that before Well by the time you've done that you've already learned most of what you need, you know, yes Yeah, TI calculators are the awesome you should.

964
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:25,718
Speaker 1: if you're ever been to high school you probably had.

965
01:05:25,738 --> 01:05:33,748
Speaker 1: you have you either in high school and using it right now or You're out of high school and you have it in a bucket somewhere that you haven't used it in a long time.

966
01:05:33,768 --> 01:05:34,069
Speaker 1: like me.

967
01:05:34,832 --> 01:05:35,394
Speaker 1: Pull it out.

968
01:05:35,575 --> 01:05:37,883
Speaker 1: go get yourself a USB to TI cable.

969
01:05:38,325 --> 01:05:39,570
Speaker 1: go to TI count org.

970
01:05:40,091 --> 01:05:49,684
Speaker 1: Have yourself some fun because there's been a lot of development since you've last checked and if you're in high school Hack that thing hack it to all hell.

971
01:05:49,765 --> 01:05:50,770
Speaker 0: see what you can do with it.

972
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:53,941
Speaker 0: Try to get away with cheating in every class you can.

973
01:05:54,021 --> 01:05:56,390
Speaker 1: yeah, put away your iPods and your cell phones.

974
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:58,187
Speaker 1: The TI is where your attention should be.

975
01:06:04,772 --> 01:06:07,362
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

976
01:06:07,382 --> 01:06:09,510
