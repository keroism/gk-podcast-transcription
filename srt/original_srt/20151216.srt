1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,280
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 16th, 2015.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,203
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:15,750
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,589
Speaker 0: Miyazaki's castle in the sky, Lapita that we somehow never reviewed in all these years.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,127
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:36,670
Speaker 0: There was a time not that long ago when new episodes of attack on Titan were coming and I was kind of pumped to see the next one because I really wanted to know what all the secrets were like.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,922
Speaker 0: I really the show was not that great.

8
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:40,490
Speaker 1: There's a terrible secret of space.

9
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I really what's in the castle with the king?

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,909
Speaker 0: I really needed to know the answers to all those secrets and I kept watching the show and I and it had.

11
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:48,090
Speaker 0: you know.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,125
Speaker 0: The show's not bad like the air like the flying around and the plot.

13
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,270
Speaker 1: I read a lot of the manga.

14
00:00:52,351 --> 00:01:03,490
Speaker 1: I have a lot of the manga and they reveal these secrets and It's like there aren't a lot of secrets left But they don't tell you like about that fucking door house or whatever with the guy's dad.

15
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,998
Speaker 1: It's like they don't tell you the real secret.

16
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:05,764
Speaker 1: It's like geez.

17
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:06,186
Speaker 1: What the hell?

18
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:06,810
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

19
00:01:07,194 --> 00:01:08,549
Speaker 1: So I doesn't make a lot of sense.

20
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:16,184
Speaker 0: I went out there and I found Summaries and I read every possible spoiler of attack on Titan that could possibly be found.

21
00:01:16,224 --> 00:01:17,548
Speaker 1: it really Peters out a lot.

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,848
Speaker 1: Ah Based on everything I know about they don't keep up the mystery of the secret of space.

23
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:35,909
Speaker 0: very well If the rate of things being revealed from the first anime is an indication The entirety of what I know that happens after the anime will take about nine years to make it out in anime form.

24
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:40,726
Speaker 0: I Also knowing what the answers are like I just don't care anymore.

25
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:41,490
Speaker 1: I never care.

26
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:45,229
Speaker 0: If a new attack on Titan anime happens.

27
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:48,730
Speaker 0: I might watch it eventually but I'm not gonna watch it until it's all out.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,382
Speaker 1: Anyone wants a whole lot of volumes of attack on Titan manga.

29
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:51,784
Speaker 1: I have them.

30
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't read the mom I couldn't.

31
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:55,450
Speaker 0: the manga was not great.

32
00:01:56,253 --> 00:02:01,794
Speaker 0: I would rather just read a Wikipedia or like a Wikipedia page that tells me the plot then read the manga It's like in order.

33
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:04,045
Speaker 0: one anime is best to Wikia.

34
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:10,108
Speaker 0: three the manga For your annoying friend who knows more about it because they read the manga and you didn't.

35
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:20,335
Speaker 1: also There's a whole bunch of spin-off mangas about like one or two volumes each one to see what the deal was all bad, but seriously, I'm not gonna spoil it for you guys, but The things you don't know.

36
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:22,945
Speaker 0: there's some things that you probably think are gonna be really cool.

37
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:27,382
Speaker 0: They are not that cool Fact some of them pretty dumb.

38
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:32,206
Speaker 1: the dumb king really, you know The secret of what it's like cuz the king is like this mysterious character.

39
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:33,090
Speaker 1: Like who is the king?

40
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,173
Speaker 1: How did they become king?

41
00:02:34,213 --> 00:02:37,123
Speaker 1: and it right the truth of who the king is and whatnot.

42
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:39,390
Speaker 1: that pretty much was like the final straw.

43
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:54,110
Speaker 0: I guess what really bothers me in retrospect is that there are things that happen in the show that based on the world You are presented with Everyone who witnessed those events should treat that like the most damning crazy revelation in history.

44
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,187
Speaker 0: It'd be like if Bigfoot literally just crashed through our window and said hello.

45
00:02:57,227 --> 00:02:59,976
Speaker 0: right now Like that's how people should be reacting.

46
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:05,309
Speaker 0: and yet almost no one reacts to those events in the show at all.

47
00:03:06,313 --> 00:03:13,622
Speaker 0: So it's hard to gauge what the actual plot is Or the history or anything unless you just read spoilers or know it all.

48
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,528
Speaker 0: I just kind of petered out on that.

49
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,117
Speaker 1: show Doesn't have a lot of staying power.

50
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:18,600
Speaker 0: Nope.

51
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:19,564
Speaker 1: You never did.

52
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:23,947
Speaker 0: we said that from the beginning Yep, and now it's kind of confirmed at least for me now that I know everything.

53
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:24,510
Speaker 0: it was confirmed.

54
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,485
Speaker 0: So it's it's Wednesday got any news.

55
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:33,202
Speaker 1: Yes, so Faku your boys the masters of American hentai good dudes.

56
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:45,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, they they are going to launch a Kickstarter and this Kickstarter is Because they want to license and publish in English some mangas some hentai mangas.

57
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:52,821
Speaker 1: All right, including La blue girl the most famous hentai Perhaps the one that most anime fans have not actually seen.

58
00:03:53,002 --> 00:04:00,119
Speaker 1: but everyone talked about demon beast invasion Which I know nothing about but has a cool name Adventure kid, which doesn't have a cool name.

59
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,850
Speaker 1: It might makes me think of an adventure island with the kid on the skateboard.

60
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,221
Speaker 0: I was about to say that sounds like I'm pretty sure it's hentai.

61
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:13,355
Speaker 1: Yep, and most importantly Took a doji legend of the overfeed the number one Violent.

62
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:16,209
Speaker 0: I feel like that anime bad anime.

63
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:25,209
Speaker 1: So the manga was published in six volumes by CPM a long time ago like ten years ago But apparently it was censored and things were removed.

64
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:32,710
Speaker 1: Fak is gonna give the uncut full real-deal legit release that does not exist in English in a legal way currently.

65
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:46,634
Speaker 0: It is weird how pervasive the legend of the overfeed is in American and British Anime fan culture like most people I know have not actually seen it but Everyone has heard of it.

66
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:50,243
Speaker 0: It's the default joke answer when anyone asks anyone.

67
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:52,509
Speaker 0: Hey, what anime should I show my mom?

68
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:54,067
Speaker 1: apocalypse zero.

69
00:04:55,672 --> 00:05:01,798
Speaker 1: But they're actually working like they're legit like they're working together with Toshio Maeda Who's the guy who made legend of the overfeed?

70
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,130
Speaker 1: So this isn't like, you know some unofficial deal.

71
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:07,403
Speaker 1: This is like the most legit that it can be.

72
00:05:07,443 --> 00:05:10,557
Speaker 1: So when this Kickstarter appears I might even kick.

73
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:15,934
Speaker 1: I haven't read or watched a hentai and like Ever I have some.

74
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:21,190
Speaker 0: maybe I have a bunch of the old Steve Bennett stuff that was given to me at a convention long ago.

75
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:26,415
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, I'll buy a copy of legend of the overfeed in English Piece of anime history.

76
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

77
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,606
Speaker 0: He's a manga history, I guess nothing wrong with that.

78
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:30,749
Speaker 0: I don't know.

79
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:38,097
Speaker 0: actually in Japan if Anyone particularly remembers legend of the overfeed Imagine not.

80
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:38,762
Speaker 0: I feel like it's.

81
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:52,309
Speaker 0: maybe I could be wrong But I imagine not because I know like there's a bunch of British anime fans way back told us that basically in the UK That was a lot of people from our generation like their introduction to anime and anime was like Japanese porn.

82
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,250
Speaker 1: Cartoons just happened to be like the first tent I had that someone brought over.

83
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had like a lotos war is not really that good But that was one of the first anime on TV.

84
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,710
Speaker 0: It might have been the first anime on DVD in the US.

85
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,075
Speaker 0: So a lot of people buy.

86
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:11,930
Speaker 1: I think the first anime DVD was if I'm not mistaken the legend not Lodos war OVA DVD.

87
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:29,849
Speaker 0: I'm almost certain that is the case because I remember being a kid Trying to convince my parents to buy one of the like eight hundred to a thousand dollar DVD players that were fancy and new Because I saw that the box set of lotos war was like 90 bucks on DVD And that shit was way more than 90 bucks if you bought all those VHS.

88
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:40,284
Speaker 1: I remember all those VHS tapes like all the red VHS tapes that were lined up in a big row of lotos TV and like Every even even you know, not nerdy stores and it was just like whoa.

89
00:06:40,324 --> 00:06:40,786
Speaker 1: What is that?

90
00:06:40,806 --> 00:06:42,170
Speaker 1: It's some fantasy anime thing.

91
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:43,658
Speaker 1: Well, I can't afford all that.

92
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a high school kid.

93
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:52,630
Speaker 0: a lot of anime I would have watched younger than I didn't because I saw how many VHS tapes there were at 2499 a pop for two to four episodes.

94
00:06:53,672 --> 00:07:06,710
Speaker 0: so in less Exciting news Funimation all-around good anime company Apparently has found a sinking ship and is desperately swimming out toward it to make camp.

95
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:13,710
Speaker 0: For whatever reason Funimation is launching an anime focused cable TV network.

96
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,574
Speaker 1: But we already had.

97
00:07:14,694 --> 00:07:16,843
Speaker 1: they already tried the anime network and it failed.

98
00:07:16,923 --> 00:07:20,659
Speaker 1: and they came an on-demand Network, which I don't even know why.

99
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:21,804
Speaker 1: who still watches that?

100
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,090
Speaker 0: or anime network in today?

101
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,670
Speaker 1: It's making some kind of money because it still exists.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,986
Speaker 0: It's a 480i resolution video on-demand service that basically I can't imagine.

103
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:37,223
Speaker 1: anyone who would use the anime network Unless they don't have internet must be making more money than it cost to run it.

104
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,370
Speaker 1: So cuz it still exists, right?

105
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, but why would you go back and try to do the full network again?

106
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:46,270
Speaker 0: I mean anime itself.

107
00:07:46,471 --> 00:07:51,810
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a self-sustaining ecosystem of pure anime like anime fans.

108
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,358
Speaker 0: This is for you and only you are.

109
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:58,852
Speaker 1: they gonna like just show anime or they also gonna produce new shows that are anime Related.

110
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,417
Speaker 0: looks like they're just gonna license anime.

111
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:08,929
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell they're not gonna make shows like quote from a tonight Or quote from the seat Mike the COO of Funimation anime world order TV.

112
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:20,850
Speaker 0: We're committed to making it easy to discover and connect with anime and our new cable channel will provide the best in anime entertainment that Fans have come to expect I mean to Nami can't even sustain can only sustain like a little bit of anime each week.

113
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:26,750
Speaker 0: This will not make it easy to discover and connect with anime because Hulu already exists let alone crunchyroll.

114
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:39,977
Speaker 1: So and also I guess if you're somewhere with the TV on and you're flipping through the channels You'll be able to put on this and it will be less bad than what the young people don't pay for cable anymore And they're not good this Anime to old people.

115
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,549
Speaker 0: but they won't because old people won't go to the anime network.

116
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:51,116
Speaker 0: The only way to get people who don't already know about Hulu and crunchyroll to be able to see anime is to put anime on The networks they already watch.

117
00:08:51,136 --> 00:08:56,497
Speaker 1: I mean the Hasbro channel with the ponies couldn't even hold, you know hold Yeah, the hub did not succeed either.

118
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,684
Speaker 1: So why would this succeed?

119
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,252
Speaker 0: I know if I was gonna do this What are they thinking?

120
00:09:02,315 --> 00:09:06,666
Speaker 0: I would make and a cartoon network that actually showed nothing but cartoons.

121
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,510
Speaker 1: I would.

122
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,432
Speaker 0: that's what I would do.

123
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:20,628
Speaker 0: it would that we would have the pony all the Hasbro type stuff and Anime and other animation and I'd hire like anime world order and make them just do a fucking morning show about animation.

124
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:23,930
Speaker 0: I hire a bunch of Warner Brothers shit.

125
00:09:24,412 --> 00:09:28,505
Speaker 1: if I had Disney everything I've had a TV network.

126
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,532
Speaker 1: I would run it like a completely normal TV network.

127
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:32,740
Speaker 1: only my news would be real fucking news.

128
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:39,500
Speaker 1: You know all the people that all the personalities that appeared on my network would you know give people the real deal not some bullshit.

129
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:51,977
Speaker 1: You know watered down for TV nonsense and I'd show what I thought were the best shows being produced that I could get Regardless of whether they were what country they were from or you know what type of show.

130
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:53,304
Speaker 0: that's just what amazes me Like what.

131
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:54,939
Speaker 0: there's so many things wrong with this one.

132
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:57,489
Speaker 0: It's cable TV, which is dying like.

133
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,580
Speaker 0: we almost talked about that on Monday, but we didn't because it's so obvious.

134
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,987
Speaker 0: So they're going to a sinking medium.

135
00:10:03,047 --> 00:10:04,531
Speaker 1: I don't know what like what is there?

136
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:06,577
Speaker 1: did they say what their strategy is?

137
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:12,920
Speaker 0: No, okay Renewed focus on delivering fans the best selection of anime content in the market.

138
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:17,160
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean, yeah, I guess you'll have the best selection of anime in the cable TV market.

139
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,700
Speaker 0: Sure go nuts, but so but it's bad.

140
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:30,778
Speaker 0: It's weird because they're going to network like well network cable TV, but it's also weird because it's anime exclusive Which defeats any of the benefits you get from being on network cable TV?

141
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,423
Speaker 0: So Whatever.

142
00:10:33,483 --> 00:10:37,400
Speaker 0: I just I don't understand how the anime industry even exists in America.

143
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:47,060
Speaker 1: Sometimes they should spend their money like just on PR so that they get the same amount of coverage You know equal to their popularity in you know, the regular existing media.

144
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:49,866
Speaker 1: Yeah Just hire PR people with that money.

145
00:10:49,907 --> 00:10:50,228
Speaker 1: don't hire

146
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:58,978
Speaker 0: PR people and get like shows that have mass appeal like just show redline On a network that shows other crazy movies like show aliens and then redline

147
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:04,080
Speaker 1: just market You know paint that money from marketing some market to people who aren't anime fans to grow the pie.

148
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,860
Speaker 0: So yeah, this is just kind of weird.

149
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,525
Speaker 0: They haven't even announced any details.

150
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:16,614
Speaker 0: funimation plans to announce further details on the funimation channels relaunch soon So I guess we'll be able to say more then.

151
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,841
Speaker 0: even worse You know what?

152
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,709
Speaker 0: This article says that what they said quote.

153
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:26,296
Speaker 0: while we finalize the new channel for launch next year I encourage viewers to subscribe to our streaming service now at funimation comm.

154
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,439
Speaker 0: so Why would I subscribe to one if I had the other?

155
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,648
Speaker 1: Why would you have cable if you have it?

156
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:39,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, why would I have cable full stop if you have internet?

157
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,975
Speaker 0: Okay, so interestingly enough just because I'm on there could be a place on where you can.

158
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:50,220
Speaker 0: you can't get really fast internet But you can still get cable comic book calm which is where I'm gonna link to for this because that's just the article I had.

159
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,089
Speaker 0: There's four comments on the article.

160
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,340
Speaker 0: The first one is broadcast one piece and I'll subscribe.

161
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:59,420
Speaker 0: Okay, the next one is I wish there'd be a network devoted to comic book programming.

162
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:03,032
Speaker 0: Okay, the third one is an ass spam ad.

163
00:12:03,052 --> 00:12:06,596
Speaker 0: All right, and the fourth one is Saying what we just said.

164
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,709
Speaker 0: Okay, and also said something about to Nami.

165
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,515
Speaker 0: prove that no one cares of watching anime on TV.

166
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:16,332
Speaker 1: Well that says more about the Community of comic book calm than it says about.

167
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:29,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, yep Oh the guy who wants us to brought them to broadcast one piece has a luffy avatar in his Count that he made on comic book calm to respond to articles like this one.

168
00:12:30,396 --> 00:12:31,760
Speaker 0: Who runs comic book calm?

169
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,540
Speaker 1: Someone who got a really good domain name and is just trying to me.

170
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,164
Speaker 0: I'm just like I know it's much money with.

171
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,133
Speaker 0: so it's got TV movies comics games.

172
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,640
Speaker 1: It's just a generic content scrapie site.

173
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,347
Speaker 1: It's probably not where that article came from.

174
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,713
Speaker 1: It's yeah original content.

175
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:48,702
Speaker 0: This is just interesting Whatever.

176
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:49,345
Speaker 1: It's interesting.

177
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,650
Speaker 1: There's a content scrapie site.

178
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:51,372
Speaker 1: Welcome to internet.

179
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:52,416
Speaker 1: There's like 10 million of them.

180
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:53,400
Speaker 0: There's fascinating.

181
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,420
Speaker 0: It's like when you explore a rundown city somewhere in the middle of Detroit like yeah, you know, there's rundown cities.

182
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,938
Speaker 0: But it's interesting to actually walk down some alleys and see what's back there.

183
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,509
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

184
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:17,889
Speaker 0: As you know I generally take a dim view of the sort of hyper live streams that people do about video games the whole markiplier or whatever.

185
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,690
Speaker 0: but This live stream is actually worth watching.

186
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:25,550
Speaker 0: So this is a dude in Japan.

187
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:30,770
Speaker 0: It's a Japanese guy who just live streams minecraft stuff in the usual fashion.

188
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,086
Speaker 0: But this particular video is him kind of.

189
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:34,850
Speaker 0: as an aside.

190
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:51,649
Speaker 0: he has this weird sort of like permanent match lighter that is not a use is trying to use it and over the course of these 11 minutes and 42 seconds he manages to start multiple fires and Burn his entire house down.

191
00:13:52,473 --> 00:13:53,680
Speaker 0: Live on the internet.

192
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,524
Speaker 1: don't smoke kids.

193
00:13:55,006 --> 00:14:09,959
Speaker 0: What makes this particularly funny but also tragic is the way that this happens because he had like Seven opportunities to prevent this from occurring and there is a beautiful moment When he starts a fire.

194
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:15,809
Speaker 0: in the process of trying to put that fire out He starts a second fire behind himself that he does not notice.

195
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:26,110
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, he has this plug-in I guess where anyone who messages him from his live stream this Hatsune Miku sounding voice will read the message out loud.

196
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:32,367
Speaker 0: so The at one point the fire starts behind him and then you hear this anime will go.

197
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:32,447
Speaker 0: Wha?

198
00:14:35,848 --> 00:14:37,042
Speaker 0: I Suggest you watch the whole thing.

199
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:38,213
Speaker 0: Don't skip ahead It's not.

200
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:46,322
Speaker 1: if it wasn't for the vocaloid reading the chat out loud Video wouldn't be any good But I'd really watch the whole thing because you will.

201
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:52,130
Speaker 0: there are many Chekhov's guns just waiting to fire Like the fact that he never tips the ashes out of his cigarette.

202
00:14:52,311 --> 00:15:00,949
Speaker 0: so the ashes are getting longer and longer and longer the whole time and The video is just depressing and amazing and everything all together at once.

203
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:05,210
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm sure everyone saw this on the internet the other day.

204
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,165
Speaker 1: But anyway, I just let you know in case you missed it.

205
00:15:08,205 --> 00:15:09,170
Speaker 1: You're living under a rock.

206
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:14,130
Speaker 1: So id software, you know, they made Wolfenstein 3d then doom then quake then garbage.

207
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:26,956
Speaker 1: You know, there was John Carmack and John Romero the two John's right the important dudes who you know There's a lot of other important people there, but mostly the important dudes Those are the most well-known people.

208
00:15:26,977 --> 00:15:39,690
Speaker 1: - yeah, and before they made the Wolfenstein 3d They made another game called commander keen and commander keen Was notable because it was just an MS-DOS platforming game and it's pretty good the series if you ever want to play it.

209
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,049
Speaker 0: It was often installed on like PCs in schools so you could kind of just play it.

210
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:52,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was one of the first if not the first PC game that had full all directions smooth scrolling.

211
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,056
Speaker 1: now That's a big deal because on those primitive.

212
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:55,822
Speaker 1: Well now we consider them primitive.

213
00:15:55,882 --> 00:16:00,355
Speaker 1: on those old computers even like 386 is Scrolling smoothly.

214
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,306
Speaker 1: It was not an easy thing to do.

215
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:05,925
Speaker 1: even on the NES Which was sort of designed for it was sort of tricky to do.

216
00:16:06,106 --> 00:16:06,347
Speaker 1: right.

217
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,254
Speaker 1: the Atari I don't think even could do it.

218
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:09,478
Speaker 1: I guess pitfall right.

219
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:11,425
Speaker 1: people didn't scroll one screen at a time.

220
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't even scroll but anyway.

221
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:22,050
Speaker 1: So apparently before they made commander keen, you know, but they had developed the smooth scrolling already.

222
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:26,769
Speaker 1: They sent to Nintendo a demo they made when they weren't even called id software.

223
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:35,089
Speaker 1: yet They were called ideas from the deep which I guess became id later for ideas deep, you know Whatever They made a demo.

224
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:40,650
Speaker 1: It was pretty much just a direct copy of Mario 3 as best they could for the PC and they send it to Nintendo.

225
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:54,868
Speaker 1: We're like, hey, let us make a PC version of Mario 3 and Nintendo's like, yeah We're not interested in putting Nintendo games in anything but Nintendo Which shows you how far game at least game wise the console NES was ahead of PC.

226
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,817
Speaker 1: Of course NES couldn't do anything else.

227
00:16:57,078 --> 00:17:07,036
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the NES was ahead of every Entertainment system in the world when it came out right even though it came out contemporarily to the Atari 7800.

228
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:13,101
Speaker 1: also consider that you know the mario 3. in the cartridge There was a lot more advanced chips than we're in say the mario 1 cartridge.

229
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:13,683
Speaker 1: Yep.

230
00:17:14,084 --> 00:17:14,566
Speaker 0: That is true.

231
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:25,236
Speaker 1: But anyway the So here he released just the other day in honor of the anniversary of something Um Commander Kean's 25th anniversary.

232
00:17:25,256 --> 00:17:29,570
Speaker 1: He uploaded video footage of that mario 3 that they made all those years ago.

233
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:36,390
Speaker 1: So it's like a historic, you know video of game, you know, very important game history video here for you to watch.

234
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,714
Speaker 0: you know, there's gonna be already.

235
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 0: there will be a future when kids will go to a museum because their parents make them and In the museum be one of those corners.

236
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:50,530
Speaker 0: They play it like a short film on a loop and that film will be this game and a little history of like.

237
00:17:50,791 --> 00:18:01,276
Speaker 1: Nintendo was a company that made game and the big NES Comparison next to it showing you how the MS-DOS computer was so primitive compared to the what the NES could do But also explaining the reasons.

238
00:18:01,377 --> 00:18:04,848
Speaker 1: and you know, the NES couldn't couldn't run Mac or your -.

239
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:09,507
Speaker 0: yeah Yes, any s could kind of share.

240
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:13,384
Speaker 0: yeah In the moment book club to be determined.

241
00:18:13,504 --> 00:18:14,750
Speaker 0: The old book club is the wheel of time.

242
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:21,029
Speaker 0: We have two panels about three panels that pack south two of which we can announce Atari game design designing game rules.

243
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:22,814
Speaker 0: We're gonna be at magfest.

244
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:27,010
Speaker 0: I'm like seven panels and everything else is coming up after the holidays.

245
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:36,378
Speaker 1: I actually remember having some Capcom games for DOS back in the day Super Street Fighter 2 and also Megaman X And they were both super legit.

246
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:38,424
Speaker 1: Like just the same as the real deal.

247
00:18:38,665 --> 00:18:49,969
Speaker 0: I remember in elementary school 486 in elementary school having a Megaman that ran on the PC at the school that someone had installed But it didn't work very well.

248
00:18:50,532 --> 00:18:53,443
Speaker 1: No one can make a man X for DOS was basically totally legit.

249
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,170
Speaker 1: Megaman X as far as I remember now.

250
00:18:55,511 --> 00:19:03,863
Speaker 0: So every year the IFC shows pretty much all the the Ghibli movies Just on in a movie theater in New York City.

251
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,310
Speaker 1: That's what you get when you live in New York City.

252
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,603
Speaker 0: So every year every year we pick like two or three of them.

253
00:19:08,623 --> 00:19:10,049
Speaker 0: Just go see him because why not?

254
00:19:10,611 --> 00:19:11,657
Speaker 0: It's great to see these movies.

255
00:19:11,677 --> 00:19:12,361
Speaker 1: No, I haven't.

256
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:12,944
Speaker 1: I didn't see.

257
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,970
Speaker 1: I mean I didn't do it last year.

258
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:17,618
Speaker 1: I haven't done it before ever.

259
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,527
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen I've seen new ones.

260
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:20,210
Speaker 1: when they come out.

261
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,797
Speaker 0: I'd I do it every year.

262
00:19:21,817 --> 00:19:22,781
Speaker 0: You don't always come with me.

263
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:23,846
Speaker 1: What did you see last year?

264
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:24,710
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

265
00:19:25,872 --> 00:19:26,836
Speaker 0: No, I think we went to see my.

266
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,881
Speaker 0: we saw Mononoke again.

267
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:29,730
Speaker 0: Okay, because I really like that one.

268
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,649
Speaker 1: But anyway, I saw the news story that this is happening and I and then I realized you know what?

269
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,718
Speaker 1: Haven't seen love to in like.

270
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:37,630
Speaker 1: I saw it once and I hardly remember it.

271
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:52,283
Speaker 1: All I remembered was there's a castle in the sky is a cool robot as a magic girl with a necklace with a Jimmy there's some mining town there's a kid who's the main character and There's the bad pirate people who are also funny and good pirate people.

272
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:54,350
Speaker 1: and that's all I remembered and that was all accurate.

273
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:58,180
Speaker 1: but Upon watching it again, which we did yesterday.

274
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,452
Speaker 1: I forgot 90% of this movie So I'm real glad I watched it again to remember that other 90%.

275
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:17,269
Speaker 0: I remembered pretty much everything that happens in the movie But what I did not remember was how much backstory there was told purely in the backgrounds of the movie.

276
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,562
Speaker 0: Like that I did not remember this movie

277
00:20:20,602 --> 00:20:32,330
Speaker 1: and the very opening credits of the movie There's basically these background images that don't really move They're just backgrounds behind the credits and they tell you the whole history of like humanity in this world of LAPTA and what happened and how?

278
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,043
Speaker 1: They polluted the earth and then they to escape the polluted earth.

279
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:47,130
Speaker 1: with their advanced industrial technology they made floating cities in the sky like covering the whole earth and floating cities and buildings and then They am play gods and all the dollars happened, right?

280
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,530
Speaker 1: All of them were destroyed and they had to return to the earth.

281
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,636
Speaker 1: But the pollution was mostly gone, but not completely by then because you don't see like, you know Super many trees on the ground.

282
00:20:56,677 --> 00:21:00,910
Speaker 0: you see some well, you know, it might not necessarily be that they're also in a mining area.

283
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:15,226
Speaker 0: It is equally easy to say that that was just a class stratification of society built up the god People with their empire living up in the sky with the technology War and me and play God and the city's crashed down and try gun style.

284
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:24,029
Speaker 1: people have to rebuild society but it's been 700 years and people have basically forgotten about that that there ever was this sky society.

285
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,135
Speaker 1: and You know, it's almost.

286
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,080
Speaker 1: it's a legend, right?

287
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,170
Speaker 1: It's like a myth that like oh, yeah is a floating city.

288
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,196
Speaker 1: Haha, not really.

289
00:21:30,296 --> 00:21:32,610
Speaker 1: No only a few people believe in that most people don't.

290
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:41,831
Speaker 0: So in terms of the movie itself though, I mean, it's a 1986 Ghibli I have a feeling 1986 looks better than most animes from 1990 to 2000.

291
00:21:41,831 --> 00:21:45,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, this movie is beautiful and holds up what.

292
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,956
Speaker 0: the only thing that does not hold up having watched it again in the theater Soundtrack is not great.

293
00:21:51,037 --> 00:21:52,061
Speaker 1: You don't like the soundtrack.

294
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,090
Speaker 0: I like half the soundtrack.

295
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:57,630
Speaker 1: So the thing with the soundtrack is that it's you know, it's the same as Joe Hisaishi.

296
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,297
Speaker 1: Whatever who does all the Ghibli?

297
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, most the vast majority of the Ghibli music, right?

298
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:04,922
Speaker 1: And you know, it's really catchy.

299
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:17,181
Speaker 1: some of the songs I should the main song But the thing is is that for better or worse it really Seems like Nobuo Matsu did the music.

300
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:19,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's real.

301
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:19,770
Speaker 1: the plot.

302
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:21,277
Speaker 1: Also, it's very fun.

303
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:30,769
Speaker 1: Like you could it's almost like they took a Final Fantasy plot You know really squished it down to fit in 90 minutes and took out a lot of like the side characters and stuff.

304
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:37,770
Speaker 1: and You know, just put it on the screen and it a lot of the music and scenes feel like Final Fantasy.

305
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:48,790
Speaker 1: very much more specific criticism like that bad guy is basically kefka and The girl is like, you know, what's her face from the magic girl you meet at the beginning?

306
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,635
Speaker 0: You don't remember any of those characters names.

307
00:22:50,655 --> 00:22:50,916
Speaker 0: Do you?

308
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:53,043
Speaker 1: well, I'd rename them all Tara.

309
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:53,605
Speaker 1: Okay.

310
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,856
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the girls basically Tara You know, whatever.

311
00:22:57,337 --> 00:23:14,444
Speaker 0: so my specific issue is that half the soundtrack is orchestral or vocal or normal instruments and sounds like a score like a musical score and the other half is Synthesizers going doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

312
00:23:14,464 --> 00:23:18,047
Speaker 1: I kind of like that sound but yes, it's not the better It's a lower quality sound.

313
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:23,530
Speaker 1: now I can make an argument and it's that's why it's also contributes to the Final Fantasy sounding nature of it.

314
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:36,458
Speaker 0: I can make an argument as to why the soundtrack has this very stark dichotomy because the Soundscape kind of does something similar, but I cannot say that Joe hishaishi Did that on purpose.

315
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:56,441
Speaker 0: the argument I would make if I was in like AP video and film and was trying to write a short essay on it is that all the motifs around the precursor technology and Lop to itself and the triant like all that stuff is refined and elegant and uses normal instruments and is normal orchestral music.

316
00:23:57,885 --> 00:24:12,210
Speaker 0: all the fighting and Industrial and like current society sounds are all those sort of grading synthesizer unrefined Sort of like not there yet like they're unrefined and raw and industrializing.

317
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:14,550
Speaker 0: That's the best I could come up with.

318
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:14,651
Speaker 0: I

319
00:24:14,691 --> 00:24:16,542
Speaker 1: wasn't paying attention to know if that's actually true or

320
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:35,010
Speaker 0: soundtrack is very rough When like the normal people are fighting and doing their thing and the soundtrack is very smooth only went and smooth and elegant only either when Lop is coming up or When the spirit of humanity and the like very simple non confrontational background scenes are happening.

321
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:37,009
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's true or not.

322
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,919
Speaker 1: I had to like watch it again and like with notes to figure that out.

323
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,599
Speaker 0: all the machines make very odd Sounds as well Like the sounds that the machine like the flying machines make are.

324
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,766
Speaker 0: just you have to watch the movie like they're.

325
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,170
Speaker 0: they're odd sound effects.

326
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:55,480
Speaker 0: yeah, of course the wind rises does something very similar.

327
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,290
Speaker 0: the sounds that the planes make are very Very weird as I think we talked about when we did the review of that movie.

328
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:06,170
Speaker 1: You know, I mean in general it's still a really great jibbly movie.

329
00:25:06,511 --> 00:25:13,382
Speaker 1: You know the plot isn't complicated and it's really straightforward and but I really love you know Terrible secret of space like is there a lot of it?

330
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:14,206
Speaker 1: obviously there is.

331
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:14,950
Speaker 1: they're gonna go there.

332
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,510
Speaker 1: Oh, they went there, but like it's not one of those things were like they go there at the end and they leave it being mysterious.

333
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:27,255
Speaker 1: It's like they get there and then they spend a lot of time there before the movies over and you pretty much learn everything There is to learn about it.

334
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:29,766
Speaker 1: You know, they reveal the full secret of space.

335
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:30,810
Speaker 1: They show you everything.

336
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:39,117
Speaker 0: The movie has a very epic feel to it And I think part of that is because it is a full two hours plus But I mean it as the only.

337
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,910
Speaker 1: that's sort of weird though because it escalates too quickly, right?

338
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:51,773
Speaker 1: It's like girl falls out of the sky meets the main character kid And then it just takes off like through the roof and it the progression is a little bit Exponential

339
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:52,315
Speaker 0: I think to

340
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:56,392
Speaker 1: the point where it's a little hard to believe suddenly like really that quickly you're see.

341
00:25:56,632 --> 00:26:07,290
Speaker 0: I would make a counter-argument that the the story of La Pita and I think the movie is Moderately unique because there aren't that many films that do this to the extent that La Pita did anime or otherwise.

342
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,722
Speaker 0: There is a huge epic like Tolkien.

343
00:26:10,882 --> 00:26:36,584
Speaker 0: ask volumes of this giant multi-generational Wheel of Time nonsense epic story and That whole story is told to you through Individual things that you see in the background of this movie Like little bits like the miners are all mining in this place in the beginning and then as the camera zooms back you realize that Hey They're in the middle of all these Abandoned mines from the old days like all the.

344
00:26:36,684 --> 00:26:39,260
Speaker 0: all these buildings are abandoned These are old mines.

345
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,490
Speaker 0: and then you get the impression Oh, they're mining there because they assume these old mines had something in them and they can't find anything.

346
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,497
Speaker 0: There's nothing valuable.

347
00:26:46,537 --> 00:26:48,329
Speaker 0: so they don't understand why these mines are there.

348
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:51,663
Speaker 0: But then you learn from the old dude that there is stuff there.

349
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,390
Speaker 0: The volisite is everywhere.

350
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:56,783
Speaker 1: They just don't recognize it or know how to use it exactly.

351
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:01,749
Speaker 1: even people back in the olden days though Who weren't La Pita might have known what it was and didn't know how to you know.

352
00:27:02,573 --> 00:27:11,546
Speaker 0: And if you just watch in the background you see like civilization is like Clinging to the edges of all these old abandoned things and sort of even after 700 years.

353
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:12,770
Speaker 1: They've figured out a bunch, right?

354
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,737
Speaker 1: They can fly again and they do all it but they haven't figured out Nearly close to everything that used to exist.

355
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:20,081
Speaker 1: and that's always the best.

356
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:23,030
Speaker 1: the fantasy world where is the existing freaker zero?

357
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,718
Speaker 0: It's like the lock Lamora thing Which is especially highlighted when they get to La Pita.

358
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,774
Speaker 0: and then there's the scenes in the end where the weapon systems get activated and then it's like.

359
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:40,017
Speaker 0: it's like a player of games where yes, the lot the La Putin technology is So far beyond.

360
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:50,174
Speaker 1: I mean it takes down that battlecruiser in like the battle So is presented as like the biggest scariest most dangerous thing that the you know, existing human society is Military technology.

361
00:27:50,234 --> 00:27:51,679
Speaker 1: and it isn't even like.

362
00:27:51,699 --> 00:27:53,084
Speaker 1: it's not even like a contest.

363
00:27:53,144 --> 00:27:54,670
Speaker 1: It's just like robots boom done.

364
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,589
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like and you know there isn't even Suspense as to whether it's gonna be a contest because the power of lava is so great.

365
00:28:01,232 --> 00:28:04,502
Speaker 0: He drops the nuke and he's like, oh, yeah, I can nuke too.

366
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:10,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one robot that they captured That's like broken that wakes up and oh that destroys like the whole castle.

367
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:15,925
Speaker 1: It's missing a hand and a foot and it destroys the entire castle on its own.

368
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:24,270
Speaker 0: and it's barely even trying And you know holding back in a lot of media of having like really seeing that tech disconnect right there.

369
00:28:24,772 --> 00:28:31,402
Speaker 0: But that is the client like the pinnacle of this huge story That's just told through little background bits little things.

370
00:28:31,462 --> 00:28:38,910
Speaker 0: The main character the girl says little Insights you get from old people in the books and the sky and the guy who should be king and all that nonsense.

371
00:28:39,192 --> 00:28:44,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the actual story of the movie Starts in media res kind of like giant robo.

372
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:44,651
Speaker 0: I mean.

373
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:50,530
Speaker 0: it starts with the girl was already kidnapped and you don't know who the bad guys are and then there's a chase and All that stuff happens right away.

374
00:28:50,610 --> 00:29:00,909
Speaker 0: So it starts in the middle of that epic story and it basically shows you the end of that epic story Like the very end when the last castle in the sky falls down.

375
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:07,767
Speaker 1: Spoilers, I guess What else is there to say about this besides?

376
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:08,670
Speaker 1: yeah, you should watch it.

377
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:16,634
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm curious actually in the forum like how many of you you know your anime fans I assume if you listen to geek knives, but If you guys actually seen this movie, yeah I don't want.

378
00:29:16,674 --> 00:29:18,712
Speaker 1: it's not the best jibbly movie But it's like the.

379
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:23,590
Speaker 1: I think in terms of bestness to least watchness the thing has like the worst ratio easily.

380
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,830
Speaker 0: I mean my opinion of this movie now that I've seen it again recently is a way higher than it was before.

381
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,801
Speaker 1: I remember really loving the hell out of it before.

382
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:34,110
Speaker 1: so my opinion my opinion level didn't really change.

383
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:35,989
Speaker 1: I just forgot most of what happened in it.

384
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:41,237
Speaker 0: But if you never like it like trust me when you watch this movie Pay more.

385
00:29:41,318 --> 00:29:43,129
Speaker 1: you really need anyone to sell you this.

386
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:51,450
Speaker 0: No I'm just saying pay more attention to the backgrounds than the action because the backgrounds tell this really interesting story.

387
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:57,190
Speaker 0: But in terms of the action I This movie does something that Ghibli's did in the old days.

388
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:04,784
Speaker 0: They don't seem to do as much now, but it has this sort of like really light-hearted Like all in good fun violence.

389
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:05,830
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

390
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:11,904
Speaker 1: So in the early part of the movie There's tons and tons of crazy action going on that lots of violence.

391
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:13,830
Speaker 1: the main character the kid almost dies.

392
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,583
Speaker 1: The opening scene is violent.

393
00:30:16,603 --> 00:30:24,450
Speaker 1: this girl just falls off of you know Skyship and airship right and there's all kinds of guns and shooting right away But not as you know.

394
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:29,570
Speaker 1: These pirates come and board the airship trying to kidnap her and steal the Jimmy firing cannons at each other.

395
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,550
Speaker 1: He's the evil men in black or she or you assume her evil men in black as they kidnapped the girl to begin with.

396
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,514
Speaker 1: They're shooting at the pirates.

397
00:30:35,555 --> 00:30:38,870
Speaker 1: You're not sure which ones are good or bad, but the girls trying to escape everyone.

398
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:44,390
Speaker 1: So you figure they're both bad right and they're shooting at each other, but no one gets hurt or dies.

399
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:50,545
Speaker 1: Really it's you know in not in a permanent way and the movie continues to sort of keep that thing going.

400
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:56,370
Speaker 1: where people are like Do you know is avoiding what would normally be certain death?

401
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,785
Speaker 0: Like you know kid almost falls off a cliff just because he's fucking around like a time.

402
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:03,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, like Looney Tunes level We're like they're on a train.

403
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,578
Speaker 1: It's going really fast.

404
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:11,044
Speaker 1: The train tracks are collapsing right behind the train, but they're not falling You know, they almost fall off things like ten times.

405
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:16,927
Speaker 1: they managed to grab on Realistically and survive like a whole bunch of times like no one's getting hurt.

406
00:31:16,987 --> 00:31:17,630
Speaker 1: No one's dying.

407
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,095
Speaker 1: There's tons of fighting going on.

408
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:24,773
Speaker 1: the best fight whole town breaks out into a huge brawl when the pirate Take turns.

409
00:31:24,854 --> 00:31:28,367
Speaker 0: punching each other in the stomach is one of my favorite scenes in this movie.

410
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,270
Speaker 1: It's such a good scene.

411
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:30,430
Speaker 0: I should make a gif out of that.

412
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:34,486
Speaker 1: like no one no one gets permanently injured or dead or anything from any of this.

413
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:49,606
Speaker 0: and then Later in the movie suddenly, they're like they stop and they're like, well people are dying now But they animate it the same way except before They'd show like GI Joe like literally every soldier running out of a thing before it blows up.

414
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,400
Speaker 0: and then at the end of the movie they show Everyone died.

415
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:54,368
Speaker 1: Well, I just like boop.

416
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:03,898
Speaker 1: well I think what it is that if I'm not mistaken, you know all the only violence that kills people is Violence from lava to technology.

417
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,690
Speaker 1: I don't think human technology kills anyone in this movie, right?

418
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:10,500
Speaker 0: Well that violence of the lava technology it also.

419
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,667
Speaker 0: it follows the men in sunglasses.

420
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:14,639
Speaker 0: the men in black there's like like there.

421
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:22,958
Speaker 0: there's a certain level of Humanity in the normal people in the town and in the pirates but there isn't humanity in the men in black.

422
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,168
Speaker 0: one of them's a labootin or whatever and the other ones are just toadies.

423
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,810
Speaker 0: but The when they're involved there is real danger.

424
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:37,690
Speaker 0: There's like this cold risk of death this other alien thing that is not present in the rest of society.

425
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,032
Speaker 0: They can.

426
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:41,169
Speaker 1: they're apparently important enough to boss the army around and mess with the army.

427
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:46,930
Speaker 1: But and the army is way powerful, but the army is also portrayed as being way stupid because their general is like a doof.

428
00:32:47,752 --> 00:32:48,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy is pretty doofy.

429
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course They'd probably better off it.

430
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,703
Speaker 0: He had won than if the other guy had won.

431
00:32:54,346 --> 00:32:54,988
Speaker 1: He was just looting.

432
00:32:55,028 --> 00:32:55,350
Speaker 1: He wasn't.

433
00:32:58,665 --> 00:33:01,157
Speaker 0: I Mean you're an anime fan.

434
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,729
Speaker 0: If you haven't seen this movie, you should a hundred percent go see it.

435
00:33:04,031 --> 00:33:07,084
Speaker 1: I mean what pseudo Ghibli movie is not must-see anime.

436
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:13,535
Speaker 1: Ah Ocean why don't we do Studio Ghibli ranking?

437
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:14,658
Speaker 0: we should just sit down.

438
00:33:14,698 --> 00:33:17,065
Speaker 0: We'll both sit and try now do right now.

439
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:18,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me pull up the list.

440
00:33:19,412 --> 00:33:20,600
Speaker 0: All right, we both got the list up.

441
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,129
Speaker 0: So I've seen almost all of these.

442
00:33:22,431 --> 00:33:24,930
Speaker 1: I mean, we're mostly covering the major ones, right?

443
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:26,136
Speaker 1: I mean, we don't.

444
00:33:26,217 --> 00:33:28,549
Speaker 1: I guess I haven't seen only yesterday.

445
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:30,215
Speaker 0: Let's see.

446
00:33:30,296 --> 00:33:32,150
Speaker 1: This is the first one.

447
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,812
Speaker 1: It was the first one Love.

448
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:38,900
Speaker 1: it is the first Studio Ghibli full-length.

449
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,406
Speaker 0: I was like only yesterday.

450
00:33:40,426 --> 00:33:41,029
Speaker 0: Is it the first one?

451
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:42,012
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It's the first one.

452
00:33:42,112 --> 00:33:44,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least on the list of films.

453
00:33:44,339 --> 00:33:45,342
Speaker 1: It's the first one.

454
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:47,830
Speaker 0: I like La Pita a lot.

455
00:33:48,258 --> 00:33:48,728
Speaker 1: It's way up.

456
00:33:48,991 --> 00:33:54,090
Speaker 0: It's hard to say though because I would have ranked La Pita much lower based on having seen it once a long time ago.

457
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,524
Speaker 0: But now that I just saw it, I don't think it might.

458
00:33:56,544 --> 00:33:59,216
Speaker 1: it's ranking is changing But I noticed a lot of things.

459
00:33:59,698 --> 00:34:04,398
Speaker 0: I probably would have put it below Kiki's before but now I put it Significantly above Kiki's.

460
00:34:04,438 --> 00:34:06,430
Speaker 0: but I have not seen Kiki's in a long time either.

461
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:08,697
Speaker 1: I seen Kiki's recently enough to remember.

462
00:34:08,717 --> 00:34:11,770
Speaker 1: I think it might be equal that they're probably next to each other.

463
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:17,090
Speaker 0: It's hard to say because Scott, you know precursor technology is my jam to a deep degree.

464
00:34:17,351 --> 00:34:21,070
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just evaluating the quality of the movie not my personal taste.

465
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:28,578
Speaker 0: So quality from like a cinematic like movie structure Spirited away might have to just win.

466
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:36,649
Speaker 1: that way is definitely I mean easy number one spirited away Is it if you're going from a purely like technical storytelling as an easy number one for me?

467
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen it the most.

468
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:41,004
Speaker 0: also, you know, the wind rises has.

469
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:42,750
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that one.

470
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:52,668
Speaker 0: I enjoyed deeply because it is so different from every other Miyazaki movie and is a very uncomfortable movie to watch very uncomfortable.

471
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,893
Speaker 0: Earthsea has to be the bottom.

472
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:55,878
Speaker 1: Earthsea is the bottom.

473
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,986
Speaker 0: That movie was so awful.

474
00:34:58,006 --> 00:34:59,110
Speaker 1: So Spirited Away is number one.

475
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:03,541
Speaker 1: Number two is a tough fight between Whisper of the Heart and Grave of the Fireflies.

476
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:04,063
Speaker 0: I don't know.

477
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,430
Speaker 0: I like Whispers of the Heart a lot.

478
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,270
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's necessarily the greatest movie.

479
00:35:07,451 --> 00:35:09,521
Speaker 0: I like it a lot for a lot of reasons.

480
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:16,333
Speaker 0: Whisper of the Heart is so good But I also really like Porco Rosso despite the fact that it is flawed in a lot of ways Right.

481
00:35:16,354 --> 00:35:20,309
Speaker 1: I mean, I like Porco Rosso a lot But that's gonna be a little bit lower than some of these other ones.

482
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:20,772
Speaker 0: Why though?

483
00:35:20,812 --> 00:35:23,205
Speaker 0: because quality chart from a like does rim like it.

484
00:35:23,426 --> 00:35:25,074
Speaker 0: it might be higher But from a like.

485
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:30,314
Speaker 0: Porco Rosso's story has a few issues and leaves a few threads not Sufficiently tied off in my.

486
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,240
Speaker 1: well, it doesn't make it a worse movie or anything.

487
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:41,150
Speaker 1: I might actually put Mononoke number two, though Mononoke's Mononoke is in the mix and in like the three slot with the castle in the sky.

488
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,516
Speaker 0: Mononoke also has the complex narrative.

489
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:44,558
Speaker 1: The Totoro and the Kiki.

490
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:52,155
Speaker 0: Multiple characters and multiple sort of like competing factions that are all good and bad Simultaneously.

491
00:35:52,195 --> 00:35:53,424
Speaker 0: like it's there is no.

492
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:54,210
Speaker 0: those are good guys.

493
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,133
Speaker 0: These are bad guys.

494
00:35:55,213 --> 00:36:04,570
Speaker 1: Lapida, Totoro, Kiki and Mononoke are like this four Fecta that are like all really equal And it's hard to separate them and they're all in like the three slot area.

495
00:36:05,172 --> 00:36:05,754
Speaker 1: I would put.

496
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,080
Speaker 1: those are like the solid.

497
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:16,890
Speaker 1: what you expect from Ghibli movie You know Totally good way awesome, but I can't really find any way to like put one above the other.

498
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,470
Speaker 0: I think I put Wind Rises and Grave of the Fireflies in the same category.

499
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,520
Speaker 1: Well, I mean they're you know more serious subject matter.

500
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean Grave of the Fireflies is so good.

501
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:28,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen Wind Rises.

502
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:32,709
Speaker 0: Wind Rises is also very good, but it's artistic in a different way.

503
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,030
Speaker 0: Mmm, you need to see it and then we could talk about that more.

504
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:38,716
Speaker 0: The cat returns is just fun.

505
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, cat returns isn't that good.

506
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,956
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not bad It's good, but it's not.

507
00:36:43,338 --> 00:36:45,974
Speaker 1: it's not at the level of the foursome I just mentioned.

508
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,850
Speaker 0: would you put the cat returns at the same level as like Ponyo or Arrietty?

509
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:56,549
Speaker 1: I Think it might be just slightly under those just due to production value and such.

510
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,408
Speaker 0: Nah, you know, but Arrietty had way high production values and was good but flawed in a lot of ways.

511
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,803
Speaker 1: Ponyo Arrietty, you know house moving castle pretty similar.

512
00:37:06,843 --> 00:37:16,637
Speaker 0: house moving castle might be a little bit better Yeah, but at the same time house moving castle ignoring books or any other media about it Not necessarily the best narrative.

513
00:37:16,918 --> 00:37:22,653
Speaker 1: No, I think Porco Rosso goes in between the four-factor and the Ponyos and the Earthseas Right.

514
00:37:22,914 --> 00:37:28,255
Speaker 1: It's sort of like right under the four-factor and then I Guess what's what are we missing here?

515
00:37:28,295 --> 00:37:31,405
Speaker 0: So I have not seen Kaguya unfortunately, so I can't.

516
00:37:31,586 --> 00:37:32,670
Speaker 1: Kaguya is really good.

517
00:37:34,372 --> 00:37:42,990
Speaker 1: It might be better than the Arriettys and the Ponyos But underneath the Porco Rosso's I need to see it because everyone's going nuts about it.

518
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,296
Speaker 0: But I saw song of the sea.

519
00:37:44,497 --> 00:37:54,630
Speaker 1: the problem with princess Kaguya is that it's so good But the pacing of it is a bit slow towards the second half and it drags a bit and that really brings the whole thing down.

520
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,641
Speaker 1: But you know the art and the story is so good.

521
00:37:57,681 --> 00:38:06,538
Speaker 0: You know what from a filmmaking perspective I think when Marnie was there actually needs to be pretty high on the list because that might be like tied with the Porco Rosso's.

522
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:17,143
Speaker 0: when Marnie was there set a really interesting level of tension and it but it wasn't like a Hitchcock movie tension, but I like it.

523
00:38:17,263 --> 00:38:23,070
Speaker 0: I had this sense of dread throughout a lot of the movie because It misdirects you in a lot of ways as to what it's actually about.

524
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:27,070
Speaker 1: And I also had a slight pacing issue of slowness, but not as bad as Kaguya did.

525
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:34,330
Speaker 0: Well the slowness and Marnie I think is also intentional to heighten the tension where you can't quite figure out what's going on.

526
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:41,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I would definitely put Marnie above, you know, the the castle the Ponyo the Ariete.

527
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,414
Speaker 0: yeah, I just Marnie was just a very well-constructed movie and Seeing it to the end.

528
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:52,538
Speaker 0: It reminds me of a lot of the old great just live-action movies I like from the 40s and 50s.

529
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,386
Speaker 1: I didn't see Poppy Hill.

530
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:57,913
Speaker 1: I Didn't see Ocean waves.

531
00:38:58,053 --> 00:38:58,775
Speaker 0: I saw Poppy Hill.

532
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,200
Speaker 0: Poppy Hill was pretty good, but it wasn't great.

533
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,063
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it.

534
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,266
Speaker 1: I haven't seen my neighbors.

535
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,548
Speaker 0: the Yamada's Poppy Hill was.

536
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:08,078
Speaker 0: It has this moment where you think oh, that's the twist.

537
00:39:08,158 --> 00:39:11,990
Speaker 0: Okay, and then oh, that's not the twist double twist.

538
00:39:13,291 --> 00:39:15,501
Speaker 1: And you think are there any that I didn't see only yesterday?

539
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,370
Speaker 1: Is there anything else we didn't comment on?

540
00:39:18,532 --> 00:39:19,522
Speaker 1: There's just about all of them.

541
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:28,970
Speaker 1: Yeah So yeah, yeah, if you haven't seen Lava to go see it I mean pretty much every I mean even though you know, we were just ranking them from best to worst.

542
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:34,470
Speaker 1: They're pretty much all worth watching one exception except for the Earthsea one.

543
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,099
Speaker 1: so Don't watch the Earthsea one.

544
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:38,744
Speaker 1: watch every other.

545
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:39,470
Speaker 1: one of these things.

546
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, even the ones I haven't seen I can pretty confident that they're worth what?

547
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,240
