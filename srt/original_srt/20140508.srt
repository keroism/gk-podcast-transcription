1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,278
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 5th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:10,479
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:13,446
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:19,709
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, talking about adventure time in continuance with a guest.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,738
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,399
Speaker 0: So it was really warm today.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,359
Speaker 1: It was warm today.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,560
Speaker 0: I was thinking about biking to work.

9
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,139
Speaker 1: I bike to work every day all week.

10
00:00:35,422 --> 00:00:37,299
Speaker 0: You don't have to go home after this show, do you?

11
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:40,299
Speaker 0: If I had biked to work, I would have to bike now.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,980
Speaker 0: And I'm leaving right from your place.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,818
Speaker 0: So it's nice out.

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,288
Speaker 0: And you know what?

15
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:43,819
Speaker 0: It's gonna rain.

16
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,416
Speaker 1: Scott, I note this now.

17
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:52,669
Speaker 1: For all the years you've been living here, if you look at the forecast and it's like 1% chance of rain, you're like, "Not biking!

18
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:53,054
Speaker 1: Not

19
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:53,378
Speaker 1: biking!".

20
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:58,080
Speaker 0: I now have more accurate weather reporting thanks to pimping Yahoo weather.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,319
Speaker 0: The Yahoo weather app tells you the hour.

22
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,479
Speaker 1: Scott, so does the built-in Android app.

23
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,578
Speaker 0: Fine, it tells you when the rain will begin.

24
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,700
Speaker 0: Look at this timeline.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,280
Speaker 0: Alright, when is the rain gonna begin?

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,380
Speaker 0: Scott, it said the rain will start at 8 and right now it's 7.20.

27
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,042
Speaker 1: Yes, you know what?

28
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:18,880
Speaker 1: At 8, there is only a 20% chance of rain in Long Island City and Astoria.

29
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:20,619
Speaker 0: That's not what mine said.

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,940
Speaker 1: That's what mine said.

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,970
Speaker 0: Mine said like 90% tonight.

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,769
Speaker 1: Also, you're a little baby.

33
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:26,412
Speaker 1: It's some rain.

34
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:27,680
Speaker 1: Just suck it the fuck up.

35
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,459
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna ruin my clothing by biking in rain.

36
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:33,860
Speaker 0: But anyway, this Sunday is gonna be amazing.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:34,967
Speaker 1: Yeah.

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,679
Speaker 0: This Sunday I'm gonna bike all day.

39
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:41,200
Speaker 1: So I was biking home and I was a little late to do the show.

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,560
Speaker 1: Partly because with my Google Glass on biking, which by the way, the Strava app on Glass is pretty great.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get to install it and set it up.

42
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't just use the phone for GPS.

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,540
Speaker 1: It's all in the Glass 100%.

44
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,540
Speaker 1: Basically, you just tap and say start biking and it just immediately starts counting down and it shows you your speed.

45
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,340
Speaker 1: While you're biking and your time and all this stuff, it's great.

46
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:04,100
Speaker 1: And you can still do other Glass stuff while it's running.

47
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,150
Speaker 1: So I'm biking.

48
00:02:05,373 --> 00:02:05,736
Speaker 1: I'm biking.

49
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:06,100
Speaker 1: I'm biking.

50
00:02:06,483 --> 00:02:07,799
Speaker 1: And I witnessed a car accident.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,759
Speaker 1: So I immediately turned on the video and took a bunch of pictures.

52
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,698
Speaker 0: What kind of car accident?

53
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,240
Speaker 1: So a Time Warner van just fucking smashed into this parked car and ripped the bummer.

54
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,100
Speaker 0: So the car was parked and a Time Warner van just drove right into it?

55
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,663
Speaker 1: Just like turned into it.

56
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,314
Speaker 1: Just like crunch, crackle, crackle.

57
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:24,260
Speaker 0: Huge noise.

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Speaker 0: So it turned around a corner and just went right into it?

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,160
Speaker 1: No, it just like tried to park and just fucking derped, I guess.

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,816
Speaker 0: Oh, so it was trying to park and he stepped on the gas.

61
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:31,140
Speaker 0: too much?

62
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:33,040
Speaker 1: Yep, and he turned in too quick at speed.

63
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,800
Speaker 1: And they get out of the car and they're kind of looking around.

64
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,460
Speaker 1: And I decided, because I was videoing, I just go right over there and I look at his license plate.

65
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:44,939
Speaker 1: So I have a good picture of it and I look at his face.

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,739
Speaker 0: Detective Rim is on the case.

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,820
Speaker 1: Well, because I do not like the fact that a lot of people do egregious shit in New York City or in just cities in general.

68
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,491
Speaker 0: And get away with it.

69
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:54,860
Speaker 0: Injustice.

70
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,239
Speaker 1: I did not want them to get away with it.

71
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:02,520
Speaker 1: So on the off chance that they were going to flee the scene, I wanted to make sure I had video of that.

72
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:06,398
Speaker 1: And then I waited like 15 minutes, the owner came down, "Look at the fuck, my

73
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:06,739
Speaker 1: car!".

74
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:13,120
Speaker 1: And then I exchanged contact info and I sent him all the pictures and video that I had and gave him a little deposition.

75
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,477
Speaker 1: So he's good to go.

76
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,732
Speaker 1: So that's what I did.

77
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:17,419
Speaker 1: That was fun.

78
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,180
Speaker 1: I was kind of, maybe it's wrong, I was hoping a little bit to see some sort of confrontation just so I'd have a better video.

79
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,759
Speaker 0: So you could upload something to YouTube and get views.

80
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:27,510
Speaker 1: Yeah.

81
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:28,709
Speaker 0: That's right.

82
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,500
Speaker 0: Get some Reddit karma.

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,578
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I wonder if the fact that I was standing there and people were talking to me like, "Oh my god, is that Google Glass?

84
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:35,778
Speaker 1: What's

85
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:35,919
Speaker 1: up?"

86
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Speaker 1: That the fact that I was standing there and I was videoing everything.

87
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,240
Speaker 1: I think if a conversation would have happened otherwise, it wouldn't because everyone was afraid of the camera.

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:48,840
Speaker 0: Anyway.

89
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:52,072
Speaker 0: So, the news action.

90
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:53,760
Speaker 0: There's not a whole lot of news going on right now.

91
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:57,660
Speaker 0: I'm sure there will be in a couple months, the San Diego Comic-Con, whatever.

92
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:00,119
Speaker 0: But, at least comic animation news.

93
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,258
Speaker 0: But check this out.

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:10,140
Speaker 0: Drops of God, awesome manga that we love that got stopped publishing in English because I guess the Japanese company wasn't happy with how much it sold in the US.

95
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, Japanese company, seriously, find an American vigner wine-brewed seller.

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,736
Speaker 0: And then you made verticals skip a bunch of volumes, which no one cared.

97
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,692
Speaker 0: That's the reason we...

98
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:25,679
Speaker 1: You needed to cross-market that shit in... To kind of take Kazuo Koike's golf manga and put it in Golf Digest.

99
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,180
Speaker 1: Take this thing, release it in floppies in wine stores.

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,220
Speaker 0: So, I'm going to have to find some scanlations somewhere to finish reading this thing because I've got to know what the drops of God are.

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,760
Speaker 1: So, Scott, when I was in France, I went to several wine tastings and I tasted a wide variety of Grand Cru.

102
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:39,784
Speaker 0: Okay.

103
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 0: Did they taste like God dropped them?

104
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:42,198
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

105
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:46,351
Speaker 0: If they were in a different bottle, would you... And I just said, "Here's some

106
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:46,635
Speaker 0: wine.".

107
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:51,500
Speaker 1: So, the taste, because this was like a proper tasting, so I wasn't drunk or anything.

108
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:56,720
Speaker 1: And unlike other tastings I've been to, later I was drunk.

109
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,720
Speaker 1: But I did take tasting notes and I used that Vivino app that I use to take pictures of some of the bottles and everything.

110
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,900
Speaker 1: What was interesting is in America, when I go to expensive or fancy wine tastings, they tend to tell you all the stuff about the wine and then have you drink it.

111
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:14,820
Speaker 1: In France, they make you drink the wine without telling you shit.

112
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,579
Speaker 0: Do they mix in shitty wines?

113
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,640
Speaker 1: Not all the wines were good.

114
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,559
Speaker 1: Then, they ask you what you think of it.

115
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,379
Speaker 1: They ask you what you taste.

116
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,979
Speaker 1: Then, they explain what the deal is with the wine.

117
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,999
Speaker 0: Oh, how about that?

118
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,940
Speaker 0: And you didn't get to see the bottle until after.

119
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,480
Speaker 1: So, the sommelier is not coloring my perception of the wine.

120
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:33,882
Speaker 0: Oh.

121
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:36,220
Speaker 1: And the best wine...

122
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,959
Speaker 0: Well, other than the fact that a sommelier gave it to you is coloring it.

123
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but some of the wines were kind of cheap and not that good.

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,759
Speaker 0: Well, but the wines that you said that you liked happened to be the expensive ones.

125
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,136
Speaker 1: The wines I liked the most were, every Grand Cru, my notes were, "This is the best

126
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:50,477
Speaker 1: wine.".

127
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:52,229
Speaker 1: Like, "This one stands

128
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:52,472
Speaker 1: out.".

129
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:54,580
Speaker 0: What made them stand out?

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,180
Speaker 1: They were like the flavor.

131
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,086
Speaker 1: Most wine, I guess...

132
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,580
Speaker 0: This isn't really winning you any drops of God contest.

133
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,090
Speaker 1: No, but I'm not great at differentiating wine.

134
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,398
Speaker 0: I don't feel like I'm at a Queen concert right now.

135
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:13,620
Speaker 1: So, in fact, there are studies that show that people who don't pay attention and study wine, a lot of times, they can't tell the difference between red and white wine if you blindfold them.

136
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:19,000
Speaker 1: But when I drink wine, I like this wine, don't like that wine, like these kinds of wines.

137
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,700
Speaker 1: I like Chianti's and Colorettes more than I like, Merlot's, that kind of thing.

138
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:31,500
Speaker 1: But the differences, like the Grand Cru's, the flavors I tasted are flavors I just don't taste in the wine that I have at home.

139
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:32,335
Speaker 1: Ah.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 1: Like, there were flavors and notes that just aren't there that actually stood out.

141
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:38,987
Speaker 0: What flavor?

142
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:39,311
Speaker 0: is that?

143
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,080
Speaker 0: Is it a good flavor?

144
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,519
Speaker 1: So, one of them had this like really sort of like almost cherry flavor in there.

145
00:06:45,702 --> 00:06:48,660
Speaker 1: But usually when I get that kind of cherry flavor in a wine that I would buy.

146
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,059
Speaker 0: Did someone dump sugar in it?

147
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,309
Speaker 1: It's also really oaky.

148
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:52,540
Speaker 1: Like it'll be oaky.

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,820
Speaker 0: Because it was in an oak barrel.

150
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,401
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,620
Speaker 1: So, this stuff, like the cherry was there.

152
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,700
Speaker 0: Oh, cherry oak, I get it.

153
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,660
Speaker 1: The cherry was there without the oak and I've never tasted that before.

154
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,580
Speaker 0: Ah, so it's an oak barrel.

155
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,910
Speaker 1: And in my tasting note, I was like, "Tastes like

156
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,412
Speaker 1: cherry?".

157
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:09,100
Speaker 1: Really tastes like cherry, period.

158
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,454
Speaker 1: And then the sommelier was like, "You may have noticed notes of cherry.

159
00:07:12,514 --> 00:07:13,439
Speaker 1: That is what makes this wine

160
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:13,740
Speaker 1: distinct.".

161
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,556
Speaker 1: And I was like, "I fucking got this now,

162
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:15,980
Speaker 1: bitches.".

163
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,743
Speaker 0: It's a test.

164
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,092
Speaker 0: You're trying to beat everyone else there.

165
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:21,360
Speaker 0: You can't help but turn it into a contest.

166
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,242
Speaker 0: No, you know what it was?

167
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:29,380
Speaker 1: I just, I like wine a lot and it's really vindicating to say, like to think I taste something.

168
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,296
Speaker 1: And then the expert is like, "Yes, that is what you

169
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:31,639
Speaker 1: tasted.".

170
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:36,034
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, the manga in Japan is coming to an end.

171
00:07:36,054 --> 00:07:37,980
Speaker 0: So, as soon as that happens, I guess it's in June.

172
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,980
Speaker 1: Just get a scandulation pack of the whole thing?

173
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,095
Speaker 0: That's fucking a right.

174
00:07:42,002 --> 00:07:43,752
Speaker 1: Yeah, gonna find out what the drops of God are.

175
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:44,556
Speaker 1: Don't read Wikipedia.

176
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:45,220
Speaker 1: It spoils shit.

177
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,660
Speaker 0: 100% gonna check out all them drops and not actually drink any of them.

178
00:07:49,880 --> 00:08:00,040
Speaker 1: See, if someone were smart, I would take that manga, take all the kinds of wines and specific vineyards and everything that are mentioned in it and set up crazy cross promotions.

179
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:06,640
Speaker 0: I would go and find one bottle of each of the apostles and the drops of God and sell it in a package.

180
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,589
Speaker 1: For like 10 or 15 grand.

181
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,699
Speaker 0: Right, one bottle of each, drops of God.

182
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,239
Speaker 1: Well, except for the ones that you can't get.

183
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:13,599
Speaker 0: I would get them.

184
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,479
Speaker 1: You can't get them all.

185
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,479
Speaker 0: It would be part of the package.

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,560
Speaker 0: In fact, so what I learned in Paris is that a lot of the great wine- I'm still pretty sure the actual drops of God are gonna be something like water or the wine you make yourself at home with your own feet.

187
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,800
Speaker 1: So a lot of the best wine I had in Paris, other than like the Grand Cru crazy stuff, was just fucking grocery store wine that cost like a euro.

188
00:08:32,941 --> 00:08:39,240
Speaker 1: A lot of the best wines, they're really great and they don't export it because it's like the cheap wine people drink every day with dinner.

189
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:41,852
Speaker 1: So that wine can't be like hundreds of dollars.

190
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:43,380
Speaker 1: So it's cheap, made locally.

191
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:49,000
Speaker 1: It's not worth exporting and the demand internally is constant and high.

192
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:52,039
Speaker 1: So all the cheapo grocery store wine is just really, really good.

193
00:08:52,962 --> 00:08:55,140
Speaker 1: Like here, cheapo grocery store wine tastes like shit.

194
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like why does the-?

195
00:08:57,345 --> 00:09:02,120
Speaker 0: there's no law of the universe that says the best grapes have to be the most rare grapes, right?

196
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:10,420
Speaker 0: It's like, what if I have the rare grape plant and the rare land, you know, the best grape plant, the best land, but I have a fuck ton of it.

197
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,760
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, they're just- the best wine on earth happens to be a fuck ton of it.

198
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a lot of the Grand Cru are like, this particular part of one vineyard just tastes different for reasons.

199
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,559
Speaker 1: So only that counts.

200
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,940
Speaker 1: So they can only make so many barrels of that.

201
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,080
Speaker 0: Right, but what if there's like a million acres that taste like that?

202
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:28,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you know what?

203
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:32,274
Speaker 1: That's the kind of wine that everyone in France drinks with dinner every day.

204
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,040
Speaker 1: that never gets exported outside of France.

205
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,940
Speaker 1: Apparently people in Britain will like drive to France, fill their car with wine, and drive back to Britain.

206
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:43,720
Speaker 0: Isn't there people like in the channel checking you?

207
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:45,272
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get caught.

208
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,040
Speaker 1: was what I was told.

209
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:46,920
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

210
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:56,860
Speaker 1: So in other brief news, if you live in New York, Atlanta, Cambridge, Baltimore, Alexandria, Columbus, a bunch of other cities, Ghost in the Shell arrives.

211
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,748
Speaker 0: It's not even a movie.

212
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:00,220
Speaker 0: It's like OAV movie things.

213
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:02,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of like Stand Alone Complex was.

214
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,140
Speaker 1: That was like pay-per-view originally.

215
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,280
Speaker 0: Well, Stand Alone Complex, Solid State Society was OAV.

216
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the first two are just being screened in movie theaters and you can buy tickets.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,300
Speaker 0: But I kind of wanted to wait until they were all done before I watched them.

218
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,860
Speaker 1: I did, but at the same time I kind of really want to see more Ghost in the Shell.

219
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:19,700
Speaker 0: In a movie theater.

220
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,620
Speaker 1: Because I like Silver Spoon, I like Jo-Up Petal.

221
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,620
Speaker 0: Did you watch Silver Spoon?

222
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,379
Speaker 1: I didn't finish the first season.

223
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,119
Speaker 1: Okay, I finished the whole thing.

224
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:37,720
Speaker 1: But shows that give me that feels, that fuck yeah feels, Kill La Kill did that, Ghost in the Shell did that.

225
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,979
Speaker 0: Who knows if Arise will do that.

226
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:40,420
Speaker 1: I have a feeling it will.

227
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,499
Speaker 0: You're willing to pay to find out?

228
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:42,740
Speaker 1: I'm willing to pay to find out.

229
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Speaker 0: Similarly, other situations, Gundam Unicorn UC is almost done, the last episode.

230
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:48,975
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

231
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,566
Speaker 0: Which means then that's another one.

232
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:51,552
Speaker 0: I watched none of that.

233
00:10:51,572 --> 00:10:52,980
Speaker 0: I'm going to watch all of as soon as it's complete.

234
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,020
Speaker 1: Maybe we should watch it together and just do straight up episodes on it.

235
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,514
Speaker 0: We could do that.

236
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:01,420
Speaker 0: And then I guess those Evangelion movies at some point.

237
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:01,858
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

238
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:02,580
Speaker 0: Will be all done.

239
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,620
Speaker 1: I'm waiting until they're all, all, all done.

240
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm waiting for, you know, 10.1010, you will not watch this again.

241
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,238
Speaker 0: We cannot remake.

242
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:20,024
Speaker 0: 8, 10, 9, 10, 10, 10.

243
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:20,517
Speaker 0: End of Anno.

244
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,379
Speaker 0: It's just a video of his funeral.

245
00:11:25,222 --> 00:11:26,359
Speaker 0: He died of smoking too much.

246
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,520
Speaker 1: Maybe what we should do is when they're finally done, let's just marathon the whole goddamn thing.

247
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:30,999
Speaker 0: That's right.

248
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,310
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

249
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,930
Speaker 1: There's a movie, you know, we're talking about anime, it's anime day.

250
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:47,650
Speaker 1: The first anime I ever saw when I was in fourth grade.

251
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,590
Speaker 0: How many times are you going to talk?

252
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,930
Speaker 1: And my little brother was too.

253
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,219
Speaker 1: So my brother was so much lately.

254
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,050
Speaker 0: Maybe we should watch it and do a show on it.

255
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,587
Speaker 1: I kind of want to.

256
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,896
Speaker 1: So that's what I think of.

257
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,410
Speaker 1: the day is when my little brother was six and I was eight.

258
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,670
Speaker 1: My parents made us watch vampire hundred D the dub, that dub, the dub that I watched.

259
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,270
Speaker 1: The first anime I ever saw in its entirety is just on YouTube.

260
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:09,006
Speaker 0: Yeah.

261
00:12:09,692 --> 00:12:19,210
Speaker 1: So, uh, if you want to see what a very young rim and his young brother watched and decided anime was our fucking thing, it was this.

262
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,290
Speaker 1: When I was eight, this was the greatest thing I had ever seen in my entire life.

263
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,330
Speaker 1: I dressed up as D for Halloween.

264
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,908
Speaker 1: Nobody fucking knew what that was.

265
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:30,330
Speaker 1: Except my mom and my dad, my brother.

266
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,629
Speaker 0: Let's get a picture of that on the internet.

267
00:12:32,555 --> 00:12:33,709
Speaker 1: I should try to find a picture of that.

268
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,590
Speaker 0: Anyway, so my thing of the day.

269
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:40,530
Speaker 0: I don't know how many of you are familiar with the on beastie boys, right?

270
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:41,168
Speaker 0: Better be.

271
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,759
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:45,370
Speaker 0: Uh, you may also know that MCA, right?

273
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,409
Speaker 0: Adam passed away with two years ago.

274
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:48,405
Speaker 0: Something like that.

275
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,877
Speaker 0: Yeah.

276
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,690
Speaker 0: On May the fourth, which is I guess inconvenient.

277
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:55,410
Speaker 0: I would not want to die on a day associated with the silly star Wars holiday.

278
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:00,544
Speaker 1: I'd much rather die on yell at the sky day, international day of Slayer, something like that.

279
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:06,990
Speaker 0: But anyway, around that time every year, uh, they have an event known as MCA day to celebrate him.

280
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,274
Speaker 0: And I hope one day that I am celebrated so that my, the anniversary of my death is a day.

281
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:22,497
Speaker 0: But anyway, he was known in his life, you know, not just for the music he created, but he was a huge, like.

282
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,070
Speaker 0: his thing was free Tibet, right?

283
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,868
Speaker 0: That was his thing.

284
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:28,450
Speaker 0: The way that free the internet is our thing, right?

285
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:34,110
Speaker 0: He was actually, you know, a Tibetan Buddhist himself and you know, he was friends, all these Tibetan Buddhist people.

286
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,229
Speaker 0: That was his, his jam.

287
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,290
Speaker 0: So on MCA day, some Tibetan Buddhist monks honored him with some awesome breakdancing.

288
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,370
Speaker 1: They honored him in the way that he should be honored.

289
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:45,969
Speaker 0: That is right.

290
00:13:46,412 --> 00:13:48,250
Speaker 0: So that's just fucking awesome.

291
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,430
Speaker 0: And it's awesome shit that happens in New York.

292
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:51,629
Speaker 0: So watch this goddamn video.

293
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,100
Speaker 0: Oh man.

294
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,709
Speaker 1: In the meta moment forums, we got them.

295
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:55,630
Speaker 1: They're rocking.

00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:56,669
Speaker 1: They're awesome.

Speaker 1: If you don't use good spelling and grammar, we'll fucking ban you.

298
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,409
Speaker 1: That's how awesome they are.

299
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:00,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,110
Speaker 0: We have IRC channel.

309
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,766
Speaker 1: You know, if you young kids don't realize we've been doing geek nights for almost 10 years.

310
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:32,750
Speaker 1: For many years, we did four fucking episodes a week.

311
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:38,769
Speaker 0: If you spread our shit, maybe one day we'll just get lucky and hit that pot of gold and we can just do this all the time.

312
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:39,150
Speaker 0: Yeah.

313
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,030
Speaker 1: You want us to make 12 episodes a week?

314
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:41,302
Speaker 1: Sure.

315
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,449
Speaker 1: You want us to make video games?

316
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:42,806
Speaker 1: Yeah.

317
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:43,337
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,350
Speaker 0: We can do all kinds of stuff if maybe someone with a lot of money likes us someday.

319
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,750
Speaker 0: The book club selection is Canicle for Leibowitz.

320
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,930
Speaker 0: You should buy that and read it because I've seen it mentioned in like so many places.

321
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,949
Speaker 0: I have to check it out.

322
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

323
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,750
Speaker 1: Also, you should look at the rest of the geek nights book club.

324
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,769
Speaker 1: We've done a bunch of books.

325
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:07,610
Speaker 1: They're not all awesome, but they're all worth reading for one reason or another, except the King Killer Chronicle.

326
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,989
Speaker 1: Don't read that one.

327
00:15:11,273 --> 00:15:15,030
Speaker 1: I cannot express to you how rustled my fucking jimmies are about that book.

328
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,226
Speaker 0: You just can't get over it.

329
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,630
Speaker 1: It did rustle me and it continues to rustle me.

330
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,390
Speaker 0: You should make your next selection something so bad.

331
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,929
Speaker 1: That it'll wash it out?

332
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,369
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott.

333
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:26,749
Speaker 1: Atlas Shrugged.

334
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:27,786
Speaker 0: Go for it.

335
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,090
Speaker 1: Have you read Atlas Shrugged?

336
00:15:29,322 --> 00:15:29,388
Speaker 0: No.

337
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:32,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Atlas Shrugged is worse.

338
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:33,589
Speaker 1: Maybe.

339
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,421
Speaker 1: I don't know.

340
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,342
Speaker 0: Ulysses.

341
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,929
Speaker 1: I'll read Ulysses.

342
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:37,423
Speaker 0: No.

343
00:15:37,932 --> 00:15:38,528
Speaker 1: No, you won't.

344
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,468
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that.

345
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,650
Speaker 1: You're going to break the book club?

346
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,192
Speaker 1: Ain't?

347
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,308
Speaker 0: no one got time for that.

348
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:44,548
Speaker 1: Ethan Frome.

349
00:15:45,294 --> 00:15:46,008
Speaker 0: I already read that.

350
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:47,469
Speaker 1: I've actually never read it.

351
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,009
Speaker 0: Guy rides a sled down a hill, dies.

352
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:49,488
Speaker 0: The end.

353
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:50,350
Speaker 1: He doesn't die.

354
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:50,929
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

355
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,270
Speaker 1: He doesn't die.

356
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,290
Speaker 1: That's the point.

357
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,530
Speaker 0: I read it in like, I don't know, sixth grade.

358
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,350
Speaker 0: What the fuck do I remember?

359
00:15:56,794 --> 00:15:57,929
Speaker 0: I can't even remember Adventure Time.

360
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,869
Speaker 0: I watched it last year.

361
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:02,069
Speaker 1: That he wants to commit suicide on a sled and fucks that up.

362
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,909
Speaker 1: And it makes everything worse.

363
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,089
Speaker 0: And you're the one who hasn't read the book?

364
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:05,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,830
Speaker 1: I read excerpts from it for class in like high school.

366
00:16:10,861 --> 00:16:11,030
Speaker 0: Okay.

367
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:11,528
Speaker 0: Anyway.

368
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,370
Speaker 1: Adventure Time.

369
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,270
Speaker 1: So we've been watching Adventure Time for a long time, as you guys know.

370
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we already did an episode on it.

371
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:21,230
Speaker 0: So why would we talk about it again?

372
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:28,670
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we could turn into Anime Pulse and just review every episode of every show we watch as it comes out and not talk about anything else.

373
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,808
Speaker 0: That's someone else's job.

374
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,490
Speaker 1: Anime Pulse's job, apparently.

375
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,997
Speaker 0: Sure.

376
00:16:33,191 --> 00:16:39,550
Speaker 1: But no, I think Adventure Time warrants a little more discussion since a lot, the show's done a lot since we first watched it.

377
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:45,809
Speaker 1: And while our reviews were pretty on point, what we didn't do is kind of talk about where it's going and all that kind of stuff.

378
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:47,550
Speaker 1: Kind of like an ongoing review.

379
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,289
Speaker 1: I mean, it's hard to say, oh, we've reviewed, you know, Space Dandy because there's only one season.

380
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,050
Speaker 1: There might be more stuff.

381
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,689
Speaker 1: Imagine if Space Dandy had 50 seasons.

382
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,930
Speaker 0: It's sort of impossible.

383
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,990
Speaker 0: How do you review something?

384
00:16:57,111 --> 00:17:01,809
Speaker 0: It's like when something is a single item, it's easy to review, but when it goes on forever, how do you even do that?

385
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,089
Speaker 1: Well, you do it by, I guess, story arc you could review.

386
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,046
Speaker 1: You could do it by...

387
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,689
Speaker 0: You got to break it into some sort of item.

388
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:07,244
Speaker 1: Yep.

389
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:13,150
Speaker 0: But anyway, since there's so much freaking Adventure Time and I only watched every episode once and my memory is awful, right?

390
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,249
Speaker 0: We called our friend Adventure Time expert Judith to come and help us talk about Adventure Time.

391
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:18,869
Speaker 0: Hello.

392
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,230
Speaker 1: Judith is pretty much the most expert at Adventure Time that we know.

393
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:23,069
Speaker 0: Also Pokemon.

394
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:23,477
Speaker 1: Yeah.

395
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,829
Speaker 1: In fact, I think I scheduled her to do an Adventure Time panel at Kineticon.

396
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:28,148
Speaker 0: Oh, how about that?

397
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,750
Speaker 1: It was either that or one of the 19 Ask a Homestuck panels that got submitted.

398
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:41,370
Speaker 0: So are you telling me that Kineticon, a relatively smaller convention in Hartford, Connecticut, where no one ever wants to go, has a better Adventure Time panel than every other convention ever?

399
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:43,330
Speaker 1: It might have the best one that's ever happened.

400
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:44,029
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

401
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:44,850
Speaker 0: No pressure.

402
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:46,570
Speaker 1: Don't worry.

403
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,310
Speaker 1: We'll just video it and livestream it on the internet.

404
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:48,889
Speaker 1: Oh, alright.

405
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:49,989
Speaker 1: That's fine.

406
00:17:51,652 --> 00:17:56,048
Speaker 1: So the only thing I'll warn you guys about is kind of good to spoil stuff, because we're just going to talk about the show.

407
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,670
Speaker 1: So if you really care about spoilers in Adventure Time, I would suggest watching Adventure Time.

408
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,409
Speaker 1: The episodes are not long.

409
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,869
Speaker 0: The number of episodes, it doesn't take long to watch all of it.

410
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,370
Speaker 1: Well, I remember when I thought, oh, I'll watch Adventure Time.

411
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,469
Speaker 1: Everyone's talking about it.

412
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,489
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm left out by not watching it.

413
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,868
Speaker 1: And then I saw there's like a bajillion episodes, and that was back when there were only like three seasons.

414
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,175
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:24,250
Speaker 0: Alright, so should we begin with the recent events that are on everyone's mind?

416
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,110
Speaker 1: So Finn finally lost his fucking arm.

417
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,769
Speaker 0: Saw that coming so far away.

418
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:29,209
Speaker 2: Everybody did though.

419
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,249
Speaker 1: Did everyone.

420
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,110
Speaker 1: The internet did not seem to see that coming.

421
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,889
Speaker 2: It was only foreshadowed like hell.

422
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:36,490
Speaker 1: Two smart people.

423
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,269
Speaker 1: It was Chekhov's arm.

424
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:44,390
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember when I noticed that it wasn't until the alternate reality world.

425
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,630
Speaker 0: Where you had the metal arm and the farm and shit.

426
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:47,929
Speaker 1: And then was it Puhoy?

427
00:18:48,071 --> 00:18:51,769
Speaker 1: Was that the episode where you met the cloud people and had sex with them and then made cloud babies?

428
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:52,888
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he got a pillow arm.

429
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:53,850
Speaker 1: Yep.

430
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:56,708
Speaker 1: And that was when I noticed that there was a trend of...

431
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:57,687
Speaker 0: I forgot all about that.

432
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,628
Speaker 1: You forgot about that?

433
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,389
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

434
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,610
Speaker 1: I watched that episode a couple of times because I'd keep seeing the title and be like, "Puhoy?

435
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:03,705
Speaker 1: The fuck was that

436
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:03,950
Speaker 1: episode?".

437
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,610
Speaker 0: I'll have to go back and rewatch that one.

438
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:08,950
Speaker 1: Do you remember why it's called Puhoy?

439
00:19:09,275 --> 00:19:09,528
Speaker 0: No.

440
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,770
Speaker 1: That's just what cloud people... Or cloud people.

441
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,929
Speaker 1: That's what pillow people say.

442
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,490
Speaker 0: Oh, pillow people.

443
00:19:14,891 --> 00:19:17,870
Speaker 0: Oh, now I don't remember even more than just cloud people.

444
00:19:18,394 --> 00:19:20,270
Speaker 1: I kept saying cloud people because there are cloud people.

445
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:21,450
Speaker 1: We saw one.

446
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:22,307
Speaker 0: Is it just me?

447
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:26,930
Speaker 0: People always talk about how Adventure Time is one of those shows that's on multiple levels.

448
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,290
Speaker 0: The adult sees this and the kid sees that, right?

449
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,942
Speaker 0: But it feels like, especially that newest episode, The Tower, it's 100% adult.

450
00:19:35,815 --> 00:19:36,910
Speaker 1: Not just the newest episode.

451
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,890
Speaker 1: The latter half of this season has been pretty much since Finn blew it with Flame Princess.

452
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:49,070
Speaker 0: What does a kid get out of watching The Tower or the episode with Prismo and whatnot?

453
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:53,190
Speaker 2: I kind of agree with you on that one, especially since the start of season six.

454
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,603
Speaker 2: I was watching it and thinking, "This is not for

455
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:56,026
Speaker 2: children.".

456
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:57,694
Speaker 1: Could we say that?

457
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:03,449
Speaker 1: maybe, as you've noticed, Finn is aging at about the rate that the show is coming out, so he's getting older.

458
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,830
Speaker 0: But no one else is because everyone else is magical?

459
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,090
Speaker 1: It's Oz World.

460
00:20:07,691 --> 00:20:09,189
Speaker 1: Ozma of Oz does not age.

461
00:20:10,221 --> 00:20:10,410
Speaker 0: Sure.

462
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,388
Speaker 1: Just like Peebs.

463
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,529
Speaker 1: People don't age in that world.

464
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,370
Speaker 1: So Finn's getting older.

465
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,010
Speaker 1: Maybe the audience is just getting older at the same rate?

466
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,810
Speaker 0: But everyone else has an excuse for not aging, right?

467
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:25,690
Speaker 0: It's like Jake is a magical dog guy and Princess Bubblegum is made of gum, but Finn is a human.

468
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,770
Speaker 1: With apparently ultra psychic powers.

469
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,130
Speaker 0: He's not a hot dog princess or a lumpy space princess.

470
00:20:32,053 --> 00:20:32,890
Speaker 1: So thus he's aging.

471
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one else is aging because everyone else is a talking pig or some shit.

472
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:38,250
Speaker 2: Jake's getting older.

473
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:40,430
Speaker 2: It's just harder to see because he's not going through puberty.

474
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,449
Speaker 2: He apparently already did.

475
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's like 30.

476
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,189
Speaker 2: He's gaining a lot of weight.

477
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,510
Speaker 0: Jake's supposed to be way older than Finn, though, right?

478
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,508
Speaker 0: He's like a middle aged dude.

479
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:49,570
Speaker 1: That might just be of mind because of dog years.

480
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,389
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.

481
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,706
Speaker 1: I pretty much always assume that.

482
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,610
Speaker 0: So Jonathan was actually kind of young, is that what you're saying?

483
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,427
Speaker 1: Well, Jonathan, I think he died in like his late 40s.

484
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,270
Speaker 2: You mean Joshua?

485
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:03,510
Speaker 0: Joshua, right?

486
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:04,510
Speaker 1: Okay.

487
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,984
Speaker 1: Way to go.

488
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:06,782
Speaker 2: I told you my memory's awful.

489
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,425
Speaker 0: That's why we needed you here.

490
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:11,950
Speaker 1: But so we don't need an excuse.

491
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,350
Speaker 1: That's why Finn's aging.

492
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,670
Speaker 1: So maybe just the target demographic of the show is aging with Finn.

493
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,889
Speaker 1: I mean, a 14 year old could learn about revenge.

494
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,109
Speaker 0: So the show is what, five, six years old?

495
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:25,649
Speaker 2: Something like that.

496
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,489
Speaker 0: Something like that?

497
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:26,770
Speaker 0: Okay.

498
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,589
Speaker 2: Don't ask me numbers.

499
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:30,969
Speaker 0: I'll actually look it up because that is somewhat interesting.

500
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,550
Speaker 1: The pilot was in 2007.

501
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,882
Speaker 1: The first season was in 2010.

502
00:21:34,882 --> 00:21:35,070
Speaker 0: All right.

503
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,550
Speaker 0: So the actual show, because you know, the only people who saw that pilot were people like us, right?

504
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,029
Speaker 0: On the YouTube.

505
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,530
Speaker 1: I remember we watched that on YouTube.

506
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,510
Speaker 1: It was one of the first videos we saw on YouTube.

507
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:44,530
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah.

508
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,050
Speaker 0: So, okay.

509
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,549
Speaker 0: So it was like four or five years old.

510
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,529
Speaker 0: So I guess how old would like an eight year old would start watching it.

511
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,110
Speaker 0: And now they're 13.

512
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,330
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it was 10 to 12 year olds even at the beginning.

513
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:54,270
Speaker 0: Maybe.

514
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,629
Speaker 0: But you know, I guess that can make sense.

515
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,650
Speaker 1: Finn was not eight years old in season one.

516
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,830
Speaker 0: Like a four or five year old wasn't watching it, right?

517
00:22:00,032 --> 00:22:00,951
Speaker 0: In 2010.

518
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:01,306
Speaker 0: Yeah.

519
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,702
Speaker 1: The demographic seemed to be 10 year olds and 30 year olds.

520
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:07,110
Speaker 0: All right.

521
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,689
Speaker 0: It's like, I guess that can make sense to the people who are now in their young teens who started watching it then, even though it's only been a handful of years.

522
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:30,946
Speaker 1: But partly I've, I've kind of noticed, I don't know if you guys agree, but the show every season has had a, an arc where the very, after the first season where the beginning is just resolving the previous season stuff and it's super serious, then it's a bunch of unrelated funny stuff and then all the Chekhov guns build up and then they all blow up at the end of the season and suddenly it gets all adult again.

523
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,510
Speaker 0: Pony does the same thing.

524
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,489
Speaker 0: They put their plot episodes at the beginning and the end.

525
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,550
Speaker 1: Don't use that word with those people anymore.

526
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,550
Speaker 0: For the season premiere and the season finales.

527
00:22:40,252 --> 00:22:42,409
Speaker 0: And then all the middle episodes are just fillers.

528
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,990
Speaker 1: Not the same way that the Chekhov's gun in Pony is like Chekhov party poppers.

529
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:53,130
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that, I'm just saying this, the same model of, you know, because they have seasons of shows, right?

530
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,046
Speaker 0: They put all the big episodes as season premieres and finales cause.

531
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:56,730
Speaker 0: that's the big deal.

532
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:57,868
Speaker 0: Even South Park doesn't.

533
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:59,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least the US shows.

534
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,330
Speaker 2: Yeah, but if we're talking about like a range of darkness, then I would say adventure time.

535
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,070
Speaker 2: season six and five had extremely dark starts.

536
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:08,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely.

537
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,229
Speaker 1: Of course then again, well let's see.

538
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,930
Speaker 1: So season two ended with heat signature and the flame princess stuff.

539
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,128
Speaker 0: That's that long ago?

540
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,140
Speaker 0: Whoa.

541
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,369
Speaker 1: Mortal recoil, mortal folly.

542
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:21,949
Speaker 2: That was the end of season two.

543
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,139
Speaker 0: That feels way more recent than the mortal.

544
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,189
Speaker 2: real recoil stuff was the end of season two.

545
00:23:27,413 --> 00:23:30,230
Speaker 2: I believe flame princess's introduction was the end of season three.

546
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:30,908
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

547
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:31,588
Speaker 0: Let's see.

548
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,227
Speaker 0: I was going to say.

549
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,110
Speaker 1: Yep, incendium, incendium as opposed to heat signature.

550
00:23:35,751 --> 00:23:37,642
Speaker 1: It feels like flame princess came in way later, right?

551
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,838
Speaker 1: But I think when the show first hit his real dark notes that were obvious was the whole alternate reality.

552
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,270
Speaker 1: fin wakes up as a human after making the wish.

553
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,909
Speaker 1: Like that shit was kind of creepy.

554
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,270
Speaker 2: That was the most blatantly dark, but there were some darker seeds before that for sure.

555
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,150
Speaker 1: There were, but they could be written off by a child.

556
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:56,790
Speaker 1: True.

557
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,150
Speaker 1: Like a child could just kind of go, whatever, not notice.

558
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,669
Speaker 1: Like you could kind of write those off as the, those elements that are in children's movies that are kind of just brushed aside before the end happens.

559
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,670
Speaker 2: You always had this safe, fantastical adventure time world to retreat to.

560
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,329
Speaker 2: It would always go back to the status quo.

561
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:17,110
Speaker 2: And even though it did, after the season five premiere, there was still kind of an uncomfortable feeling leftover.

562
00:24:17,694 --> 00:24:17,926
Speaker 1: Yeah.

563
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,207
Speaker 1: Cause it kind of showed you this other world and what could have been, and it was just horrible.

564
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,630
Speaker 1: Like really, really horrible.

565
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,990
Speaker 1: And you start to realize that Jake's not the most responsible person.

566
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:30,890
Speaker 2: That was kind of obvious.

567
00:24:32,532 --> 00:24:36,410
Speaker 1: I just remember when he's watching the video of what's going on in Finn's alternate reality.

568
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,849
Speaker 1: He's kind of like, yeah, he's got this whatevs.

569
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,530
Speaker 0: I think Jake is just sort of like, it's really inconsistent and all over the place.

570
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,848
Speaker 0: Like if you watch the episode just now, right?

571
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,330
Speaker 0: The tower, he was relatively stable and you know, in control other than supporting Finn's crazy idea to build the tower.

572
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,870
Speaker 1: Are you thinking of the episode where they're in, they're trapped in the sand kingdom?

573
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,990
Speaker 2: Oh, he was that guy in that episode.

574
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,189
Speaker 1: He's just a that guy fuck up in that episode.

575
00:24:59,590 --> 00:24:59,710
Speaker 0: Right.

576
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:07,870
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, sometimes it'll be like an adult and other times he will totally be the most dangerous possible person to be around.

577
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,790
Speaker 2: Sometimes he'll give terrible advice, but with the utmost of confidence and young Finn will be like, oh yeah, yeah, let's just do that.

578
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:15,830
Speaker 1: Listen to your Mellenhart.

579
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,309
Speaker 1: Mellenhart's telling me to kill my dad.

580
00:25:17,832 --> 00:25:19,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not your Mellenhart.

581
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:19,855
Speaker 0: See?

582
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,269
Speaker 0: That's the responsible Jake.

583
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,990
Speaker 1: Except I think that was his Mellenhart.

584
00:25:24,175 --> 00:25:24,510
Speaker 0: Probably.

585
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:42,190
Speaker 1: But it really, the moment the show got it, I don't want to say it got sexual, but kind of do because it was honestly that episode that led up to you blew it man with flame princess because there is no way to cast that episode as anything other than puberty.

586
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,090
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.

587
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:51,349
Speaker 0: I mean those dreams, the one where he's wriggling around in his little, uh, his pants are on fire and he loves it.

588
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:51,850
Speaker 1: Yep.

589
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:52,870
Speaker 1: This feels great.

590
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:58,486
Speaker 1: And then he's trying to recreate that feeling and then in doing so he pushes away the only girl who ever probably loved him.

591
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:00,328
Speaker 1: You blew it, man.

592
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,789
Speaker 1: Granted, I think the cosmic owl was being kind of a dick there.

593
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:03,784
Speaker 1: Could've just told him.

594
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,590
Speaker 0: And then when you know, it's cosmic owl is weird too.

595
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:16,250
Speaker 0: It's like he seems so mysterious, but now that you've seen some mysterious and then he's just like hanging out in like the hot tub at Prismo's place and it's like, his job seems to be to, uh, there's drama going on here.

596
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:16,746
Speaker 1: I'm out of here.

597
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,278
Speaker 1: See ya.

598
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,430
Speaker 0: I mean, princess Luna is more responsible than my cosmic owl.

599
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:27,402
Speaker 1: All Luna does is just watch everyone's dreams and then she helps them out and intervene in them.

600
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,170
Speaker 0: She's doing the cosmic owl's job right.

601
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:30,610
Speaker 0: That's what the cosmic owl should be doing.

602
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,350
Speaker 2: That's really creepy.

603
00:26:31,932 --> 00:26:33,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, but she is.

604
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:38,530
Speaker 1: I mean, she's straight up watching people's dreams and then she doesn't even stop Sweetie Belle from doing her bullshit.

605
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,606
Speaker 1: She lets her do it and then she tells her wrong.

606
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:40,969
Speaker 0: show guys.

607
00:26:41,732 --> 00:26:44,048
Speaker 0: I know it's my fault, but seriously, it always is.

608
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:54,468
Speaker 1: But from that moment, I mean, if we look at the list of episodes in season five and six, especially season six, I mean, let's see, we've got, oh my God, there's a lot of episodes in season five.

609
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,289
Speaker 1: So Finn, the human Jake, the dog, that was, that was kind of serious.

610
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:02,149
Speaker 1: Uh, Pahoy had those elements.

611
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:08,026
Speaker 1: Simon and Marcy, there's been a lot of those episodes lately and they just go full on in now.

612
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:09,370
Speaker 1: They don't dance around.

613
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,330
Speaker 1: They don't leave anything ambiguous.

614
00:27:10,411 --> 00:27:12,529
Speaker 1: They're like, let's explore this world some more.

615
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:16,209
Speaker 1: Oh, look at this exact flashback of what happened back then.

616
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:18,549
Speaker 2: What else is there to hide now?

617
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,166
Speaker 2: We know what happened, kind of mostly true, but notice how.

618
00:27:22,186 --> 00:27:23,750
Speaker 1: in the old days they'd hinted these things.

619
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,929
Speaker 1: They'd give you vignettes, they'd give you little flashes and ideas, but then they sort of transitioned into this.

620
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:36,130
Speaker 1: Let's just have a long running flashback that tells all and kind of assume that all the other characters now couldn't keep up those hints forever.

621
00:27:36,484 --> 00:27:36,610
Speaker 0: Right?

622
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:43,790
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing that I'm seeing now is they're facing all the Chekhov's guns are firing and all the, they're all empty, like there's nothing else to fire.

623
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:49,289
Speaker 0: What are they going to possibly add more to other than just rolling the things that they've already got forward?

624
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:49,849
Speaker 2: I don't know.

625
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,206
Speaker 2: Flame Princess is still a powder keg.

626
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,003
Speaker 0: Sure.

627
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:53,129
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

628
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,808
Speaker 1: And they haven't really resolved any of that, even though honestly it fins the state up until now.

629
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,830
Speaker 1: I think Cinnamon Bun's a better person for her to be with, a little more stable and adult.

630
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,670
Speaker 2: I seriously don't think that's romantic though.

631
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:05,186
Speaker 1: No.

632
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:05,749
Speaker 1: No.

633
00:28:06,313 --> 00:28:07,250
Speaker 2: If that's what you're implying.

634
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:15,269
Speaker 1: How would that possibly, that'd be, it's like, yeah, yeah, because that's any less plausible than a human boy and fire.

635
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:19,929
Speaker 0: It's at least got more merit than a flammable big good.

636
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,630
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean, the world is mostly candy people and monsters.

637
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:28,887
Speaker 0: It's this area of ooh.

638
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,109
Speaker 1: Most of the world is monsters then.

639
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,970
Speaker 0: But I mean, there's other dimensions, right?

640
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,110
Speaker 0: It's like, where, you know, the hell place where Marceline's dad lives.

641
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,290
Speaker 2: There's infinite dimensions.

642
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,669
Speaker 2: They established that a long time ago.

643
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,346
Speaker 0: That's true.

644
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,589
Speaker 0: When is that established?

645
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,350
Speaker 2: The first time Prisma was introduced.

646
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,930
Speaker 0: Oh, he says there's infinity dimensions.

647
00:28:44,151 --> 00:28:48,990
Speaker 2: The little keeper guy introduces them to that in this really, really fast spoken monologue.

648
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,390
Speaker 1: With the whole Enchiridion thing.

649
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,669
Speaker 2: You have to listen to it a lot.

650
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:52,937
Speaker 1: I take it.

651
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:53,910
Speaker 1: you've watched that part.

652
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:54,548
Speaker 0: I've listened to it once.

653
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:55,070
Speaker 0: Over an hour.

654
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,730
Speaker 1: I've watched those episodes a bunch of times.

655
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,988
Speaker 2: I've watched it like three or four times.

656
00:28:59,276 --> 00:28:59,426
Speaker 0: Okay.

657
00:28:59,955 --> 00:29:00,549
Speaker 2: It's 11 minutes long.

658
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,508
Speaker 0: I'll just trust you then.

659
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,509
Speaker 0: Because I have no choice but not to do so.

660
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,490
Speaker 1: But we had like the two part Lemon Hopper, which seemed to just be about internet libertarians.

661
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,830
Speaker 0: I love that at Lemon Hope.

662
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:15,329
Speaker 1: At the wedding, we learned just how creepy tree trunks really is.

663
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,069
Speaker 0: For some reason, the whole lemon situation, when it first appeared, it's just like, shut up lemons.

664
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:24,269
Speaker 0: Never appear again in this show.

665
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,269
Speaker 1: I love lemons.

666
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,790
Speaker 0: It's just like, why isn't this a lemon episode?

667
00:29:28,472 --> 00:29:30,170
Speaker 2: I love lemon grab after his first appearance.

668
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,090
Speaker 2: He was hilarious.

669
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,950
Speaker 0: I meant the first appearance of any lemons whatsoever.

670
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,389
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, you were the same way with LSP.

671
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:36,850
Speaker 1: You were like, oh my God, I hate this character.

672
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,129
Speaker 0: No, LSP from the beginning was like, oh my God.

673
00:29:45,214 --> 00:29:46,910
Speaker 1: I remember I was using LSP as an example.

674
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:47,689
Speaker 1: We were at a con.

675
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,589
Speaker 1: It was like an anime Boston.

676
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,950
Speaker 1: You weren't watching Adventure Time yet.

677
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,750
Speaker 1: And I was like, you saw an LSP and you were like, what's that thing?

678
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:54,330
Speaker 1: It's really cute.

679
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,221
Speaker 1: And I was like, you're going to watch Adventure Time someday and you're going to really hate what that thing is.

680
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,170
Speaker 0: It's definitely not cute, but it's still the best thing.

681
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,950
Speaker 1: But they've left Betty unresolved, Flame Princess unresolved.

682
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,270
Speaker 1: Rattleballs is out there.

683
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:08,990
Speaker 1: He could do something.

684
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:09,983
Speaker 0: Sure.

685
00:30:10,131 --> 00:30:13,410
Speaker 0: So it's like the Chekhov's guns are just characters that happen to exist.

686
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,310
Speaker 0: That's like saying that in The Simpsons, Moe is a Chekhov's gun because he hasn't been.

687
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,689
Speaker 1: These are characters that exist, interacted with the main characters and have still unresolved issues.

688
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,549
Speaker 2: I thought Rattleballs was going to be the one to provide Finn with a new arm since his arm kind of looks like the one that Finn has been depicted with.

689
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,929
Speaker 0: Look who's looking at the details there.

690
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:38,970
Speaker 1: While that might be true, every reality where Finn has lost his arm, he has gotten a different arm.

691
00:30:39,051 --> 00:30:41,910
Speaker 1: I don't think he can get the same kind of arm in two places.

692
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,970
Speaker 2: I'm not going to confirm or deny that.

693
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,647
Speaker 2: I have no idea.

694
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:47,930
Speaker 1: That's just my theory.

695
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:50,590
Speaker 1: I feel like every version of Finn has a different arm.

696
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,590
Speaker 2: Well, Rattleballs was thrown into the mix for a reason.

697
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:55,110
Speaker 2: Maybe they haven't come up with it yet, but definitely for a reason.

698
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,730
Speaker 0: Let's talk about this arm though, right?

699
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:59,810
Speaker 0: So he had the leaf sword, the grass sword, right?

700
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:05,849
Speaker 1: Well, that episode alone, that episode had all appearances of being a throwaway episode and got serious real quick.

701
00:31:06,117 --> 00:31:06,307
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:31:06,911 --> 00:31:10,269
Speaker 0: With my favorite character, choose Goose, who needs to show up more often.

703
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,430
Speaker 1: I thought LSP was your favorite character.

704
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:13,247
Speaker 0: Also choose Goose.

705
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,710
Speaker 2: LSP is better.

706
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:17,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he gets the leaf arm, right?

707
00:31:17,532 --> 00:31:17,929
Speaker 0: The sword.

708
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:19,007
Speaker 0: Then he's cool with it.

709
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,419
Speaker 0: Yep.

710
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:19,810
Speaker 0: Right?

711
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:23,749
Speaker 0: Then it basically, when he needs to use it, it devours his whole arm and pops off.

712
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,070
Speaker 0: And then the magic goop, right?

713
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:30,850
Speaker 0: That I guess that goop was keeping people alive and stable and unaging for long periods.

714
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,048
Speaker 1: Well, that goop is a perfect heal-all.

715
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,793
Speaker 1: It heals anything 100%.

716
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:34,050
Speaker 1: Yeah.

717
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:34,410
Speaker 0: Right.

718
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,790
Speaker 0: So it healed his arm into this flower.

719
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,130
Speaker 1: Well, it healed it back into the flower.

720
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,930
Speaker 1: So that means that his arm's essence was replaced by that cursed plant.

721
00:31:42,138 --> 00:31:42,290
Speaker 0: Sure.

722
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,545
Speaker 0: Now, if he gets more goop somehow, would the flower grow even more?

723
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,430
Speaker 0: or is that the max for that flower?

724
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,970
Speaker 1: I think it's going to grow back into a flower.

725
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,170
Speaker 2: It looked like the goop healed the sword and not the human arm.

726
00:31:52,815 --> 00:31:53,269
Speaker 0: That's right.

727
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,330
Speaker 1: So the sword should grow back into a proper sword, I guess.

728
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,370
Speaker 0: Is he going to maybe have a plant arm eventually if it keeps growing?

729
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,050
Speaker 0: Is he giving it enough water and sunlight?

730
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:01,828
Speaker 0: You know.

731
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:03,770
Speaker 2: Well, where would he give water?

732
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,488
Speaker 2: Just sweat on it?

733
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:05,129
Speaker 0: I guess.

734
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:05,565
Speaker 0: I don't know.

735
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:06,770
Speaker 1: Dip it in water occasionally?

736
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,469
Speaker 0: Drink the water?

737
00:32:07,831 --> 00:32:09,250
Speaker 0: It's got roots probably in his upper arm.

738
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:09,710
Speaker 2: It's magic.

739
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,729
Speaker 2: It probably doesn't need any of that.

740
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,189
Speaker 0: Why doesn't he go ask some wizards about it or some shit?

741
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:14,150
Speaker 1: You know, it's kind of a aside.

742
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,005
Speaker 1: You know what that arm reminded me of a lot?

743
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,468
Speaker 1: And I thought about this.

744
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:17,986
Speaker 1: Dajan.

745
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:25,970
Speaker 1: That whole episode with the cursed arm reminded me of Dajan and the feather just because that arm is kind of wicked powerful.

746
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:28,689
Speaker 0: Well, now it's not.

747
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:29,726
Speaker 0: Or maybe it still is.

748
00:32:30,036 --> 00:32:30,270
Speaker 0: Nah.

749
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:30,667
Speaker 0: Right.

750
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,950
Speaker 1: But actually.

751
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:45,390
Speaker 1: So the mechanical arm he had in his previous life as that awesome thief girl is similar to the arm he had in the alternate reality where he becomes the Ice King and fights Jake the Lich.

752
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:46,463
Speaker 2: Yeah.

753
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,509
Speaker 2: I thought all of his mechanical arms at least looked a little bit smaller.

754
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:58,550
Speaker 1: But they are distinctly different in that the human, Finn the human arm has two bits and two bits and a sort of like and the joint is different.

755
00:32:58,914 --> 00:33:00,210
Speaker 1: But the grabbers the same.

756
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,970
Speaker 0: It's a. it's a metal arm of the grabber.

757
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,209
Speaker 0: Go find a picture of Rattleballs and let's check his arms out.

758
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:05,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm looking at Rattleballs.

759
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,509
Speaker 1: I think Rattleballs had a hand.

760
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,207
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.

761
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,246
Speaker 1: I'm not looking it up.

762
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:18,004
Speaker 1: But when Finn saw the flash forward future of him on the train, his arm is just his fucking whip.

763
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,850
Speaker 2: Wasn't his arm all decked out?

764
00:33:21,512 --> 00:33:23,129
Speaker 1: It was all decked out, but it's a decked out whip.

765
00:33:24,632 --> 00:33:26,970
Speaker 1: It's like a. it's like a weird arm with a hook.

766
00:33:27,411 --> 00:33:32,904
Speaker 1: And then on the end of the hook is a whip and then the other arm's got a semi-permanent looking gauntlet.

767
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:33,927
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

768
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,109
Speaker 1: But oh, it's just a pillow.

769
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,782
Speaker 1: So why don't you

770
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:57,349
Speaker 0: make a list of like all the plot episodes of Adventure Time so you can like breeze, you know, not because you should only watch the plot episodes, but because if you've already watched the whole show but you need to refresh yourself because you only watched it once like me, you can refresh quickly and not have to rewatch, you know, the episodes that aren't.

771
00:33:58,322 --> 00:33:58,704
Speaker 1: Well, is it?

772
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,540
Speaker 1: is it plot episodes or gun episodes?

773
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:11,920
Speaker 0: Any episode will count if it is an episode that affects either is, you know, a direct main plot episode like the two that started this season or the end of the season.

774
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:12,222
Speaker 0: Right.

775
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:14,520
Speaker 0: Or one that has some sort of effect.

776
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:14,781
Speaker 0: Right.

777
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,684
Speaker 0: Because like the one where he gets the grass sword doesn't you know, it seems like a one off.

778
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:18,844
Speaker 0: Right.

779
00:34:18,864 --> 00:34:19,851
Speaker 0: And that's the thing they do.

780
00:34:19,951 --> 00:34:22,985
Speaker 0: is even their one off episodic episodes don't?

781
00:34:23,768 --> 00:34:25,353
Speaker 0: it's like they have some sort of like.

782
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:27,924
Speaker 0: they leave a mark on the universe in some way.

783
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:28,425
Speaker 0: Right.

784
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:34,039
Speaker 0: By like creating a character or creating an item or changing a character or changing a place or a thing.

785
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:35,245
Speaker 0: Right.

786
00:34:35,264 --> 00:34:37,860
Speaker 0: Or or the nature of a character's relationship.

787
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:44,045
Speaker 0: And then they bring that back and it stays that way in all future episodes until it's changed again.

788
00:34:44,186 --> 00:34:45,500
Speaker 2: You mean the show has continuity?

789
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,062
Speaker 0: Yeah.

790
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,632
Speaker 0: All right.

791
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,853
Speaker 1: Rattleballs just has a fucking hand, but it's not.

792
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:52,732
Speaker 0: you know, there are a lot of things that have continuity.

793
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:53,300
Speaker 0: Right.

794
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,041
Speaker 0: Like Marvel Comics or whatever, but they don't necessarily modify the continuity all the time.

795
00:34:59,544 --> 00:34:59,805
Speaker 0: Right.

796
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:06,959
Speaker 1: It's like almost every adventure type episode does something or at least it has an element that is probably intended to be used in the future if they want to.

797
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:07,582
Speaker 0: Right.

798
00:35:08,385 --> 00:35:14,619
Speaker 0: Whereas other things that have continuity will still have just episodic shit that doesn't affect the continuity in any way.

799
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:15,603
Speaker 0: Right.

800
00:35:15,643 --> 00:35:18,640
Speaker 0: Like, OK, these are is a bunch of filler that doesn't affect anything.

801
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:19,167
Speaker 0: Right.

802
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,079
Speaker 0: Like one piece movies.

803
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:32,000
Speaker 1: Well, I think the difference is Adventure Time does it much more subtly and aptly than ponies has lately and that ponies will zoom all the way in on the thing and be like, hey, guys, hey, guys, hey, guys, look at this.

804
00:35:32,261 --> 00:35:33,169
Speaker 1: Look right here.

805
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:34,419
Speaker 1: This is the plot.

806
00:35:35,881 --> 00:35:39,881
Speaker 1: And Adventure Time is like just gets a cursed sword and then it becomes his arm at the end.

807
00:35:40,566 --> 00:35:41,250
Speaker 0: And then it's still.

808
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,780
Speaker 0: it's actually still there the next episode.

809
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,305
Speaker 0: Oh, my gosh.

810
00:35:43,325 --> 00:35:44,660
Speaker 1: But then some other things aren't still there.

811
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,604
Speaker 0: What other show does that?

812
00:35:46,046 --> 00:35:50,889
Speaker 1: So in the preview for the next episode, he just has two human arms.

813
00:35:50,909 --> 00:35:51,600
Speaker 1: Just point that out.

814
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,326
Speaker 1: I saw it.

815
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,660
Speaker 1: I saw pictures from it.

816
00:35:53,961 --> 00:35:57,178
Speaker 1: I think it's just because that episode was directed and put together before.

817
00:35:58,141 --> 00:35:59,175
Speaker 2: Is that the food chain episode?

818
00:35:59,297 --> 00:35:59,480
Speaker 2: Yes.

819
00:35:59,700 --> 00:35:59,962
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

820
00:36:00,002 --> 00:36:00,525
Speaker 2: That's probably why.

821
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:03,300
Speaker 1: So are they going to do deal with that in some way?

822
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:04,050
Speaker 0: Who knows?

823
00:36:04,132 --> 00:36:04,499
Speaker 0: I don't know.

824
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,323
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

825
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:08,460
Speaker 0: How about this Masaki Yuasa episode?

826
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,546
Speaker 0: If you that's the episode.

827
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,380
Speaker 0: I thought I didn't think that was the next one.

828
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,568
Speaker 0: I thought that one still a ways out.

829
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,380
Speaker 1: It's coming up soon anyway.

830
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:17,140
Speaker 1: At any point, at any rate, he has two arms.

831
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,479
Speaker 0: But that episode and the preview for it, you know, who's there?

832
00:36:21,261 --> 00:36:21,626
Speaker 1: LSP?

833
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:22,578
Speaker 0: Magic Man.

834
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,000
Speaker 1: I like Magic Man a lot.

835
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:27,433
Speaker 0: I don't like Magic Man.

836
00:36:27,453 --> 00:36:27,879
Speaker 0: He's a jerk.

837
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:36,902
Speaker 1: So do you think the show is going to keep getting more and more adult, like for real adult?

838
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:38,209
Speaker 1: Like, is it going to be dealing with like?

839
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:42,420
Speaker 1: really will it deal with more serious issues that it already has in the next season?

840
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:51,922
Speaker 2: I think it might have to dip back into the subtlety after a while, because, you know, they they can push the boundaries being as popular as they are, a massively popular cartoon.

841
00:36:52,304 --> 00:37:01,919
Speaker 2: But if they push it too far and stay too adult for too long, Cartoon Network is going to take issue because it's very, very important to them to keep that 8 to 12 little boy demographic watching the show.

842
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:08,098
Speaker 2: And if they start, you know, losing interest because we're just dealing with grief and relationship issues and.

843
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:13,601
Speaker 0: Or maybe they'll get interest, you know, when I was eight to 12, I wouldn't want to watch this.

844
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:17,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think when I when I was eight to 12, I'd already seen Vampire Hunter D.

845
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:18,566
Speaker 0: Right.

846
00:37:18,686 --> 00:37:21,039
Speaker 2: Not everybody had the same eight to 12 foot as you guys.

847
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:22,024
Speaker 1: They should have.

848
00:37:22,084 --> 00:37:24,640
Speaker 0: They can get all the money from the smart kids, not the dumb kids.

849
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:26,940
Speaker 1: It's like Donald Duck in Math Magic Land.

850
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:27,727
Speaker 2: Right.

851
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:28,580
Speaker 2: Money from the smart kids.

852
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,120
Speaker 1: I think I think one easy thing they can do to move forward is resolve the fucking shit with Flame Princess and have Finn get over his grief.

853
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,760
Speaker 0: Well, no, is they can start to combine different things.

854
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,121
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:42,340
Speaker 1: So it's like you don't see me like Finn's arm and Finn's dead.

856
00:37:43,001 --> 00:37:48,124
Speaker 0: No, like, you know, there are parts of the plot that sort of go together like Finn's arm and Finn's dead.

857
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:50,700
Speaker 0: But there are other things that don't really go together.

858
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:54,680
Speaker 0: Like, how about Flame Princess plus Lemon Hope?

859
00:37:55,222 --> 00:37:55,443
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:37:55,604 --> 00:37:57,720
Speaker 0: It's like those things don't even touch each other whatsoever.

861
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,502
Speaker 0: What if they did?

862
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:03,100
Speaker 1: That's the most is like goes with Lenny on a trip episode.

863
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:03,791
Speaker 0: Exactly.

864
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:04,320
Speaker 0: Right.

865
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,600
Speaker 1: You've got to have 10 seasons before you start that shit.

866
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,102
Speaker 1: Minimum.

867
00:38:07,223 --> 00:38:10,220
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there's a whole lot of territory of that nature.

868
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,360
Speaker 2: They already know what's going to happen to Lemon Hope.

869
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

870
00:38:14,117 --> 00:38:14,300
Speaker 1: Right.

871
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,540
Speaker 1: We'll probably never see him again.

872
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:16,791
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of time.

873
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:17,279
Speaker 0: There's no need.

874
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:18,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's resolved.

875
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,119
Speaker 2: He's just off hippying for the rest of his life.

876
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,224
Speaker 1: Granted, the only real takeaway from Lemon Hope is, one, libertarianism is a failed philosophy.

877
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,440
Speaker 1: Two, there's no such thing as fate and destiny.

878
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,760
Speaker 1: Three, Peeves could have planned that better.

879
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:32,492
Speaker 2: Oh, come on.

880
00:38:32,553 --> 00:38:33,099
Speaker 2: Come on.

881
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,379
Speaker 2: You don't even know what happened.

882
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, we have a good idea of what happened.

883
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,899
Speaker 2: It looked like a war.

884
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,820
Speaker 1: Actually, it reminded me a lot of the end of a book from a series.

885
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,800
Speaker 1: I shouldn't say what it is because it might spoil things.

886
00:38:46,561 --> 00:38:55,919
Speaker 1: At the end of this book, it ends and you get an epilogue that takes place like 50,000 years later and it just kind of offhandedly reveals pretty much everything.

887
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,860
Speaker 2: Man, that episode left me feeling drained.

888
00:38:59,362 --> 00:39:03,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, that last scene, that was just so I loved it.

889
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,166
Speaker 1: But geez, well, there was.

890
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:09,046
Speaker 1: I mean, if you've seen Brazil, I have not that episode, that whole Lemon Hope.

891
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:15,440
Speaker 1: that one Brazil's really good, but it's also really long and allegorical and at times boring.

892
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,958
Speaker 0: I see where you go with this.

893
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:18,960
Speaker 0: But Brazil is the Lemon Kingdom.

894
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,359
Speaker 1: The Lemon Hope stuff was a straight up reference to Brazil.

895
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:27,497
Speaker 1: OK, with the wings and all that stuff, with Lemon Hope, it's 100 percent.

896
00:39:29,103 --> 00:39:30,200
Speaker 2: I do want to see that movie.

897
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:33,080
Speaker 2: You should watch that movie when I have several hours to put aside.

898
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,920
Speaker 1: Just make sure you watch the correct version.

899
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,160
Speaker 1: If you watch the wrong version, you'll know because it has a happy ending.

900
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:38,720
Speaker 2: Oh, which version is on Netflix?

901
00:39:39,361 --> 00:39:39,714
Speaker 1: I don't know.

902
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:41,865
Speaker 1: I really don't know.

903
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:43,900
Speaker 1: Just if you see a happy ending, you fucked up.

904
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,866
Speaker 1: That's all I can say.

905
00:39:45,732 --> 00:39:46,820
Speaker 1: It does not end happily.

906
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:50,858
Speaker 2: One important thing to note, the storyboard for the episode Lemon Hope.

907
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,720
Speaker 2: at the very end, when they're showing the ruined city, they put a note there that said it was not bombed.

908
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,560
Speaker 2: It's abandoned.

909
00:39:57,946 --> 00:40:00,300
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I mean, you could tell that watching it, right?

910
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,600
Speaker 1: But it's interesting that they made that that was intentional, that they wanted to make it clear that these people left, this kingdom failed.

911
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,679
Speaker 0: Well, clearly, we're going to get an episode at some point.

912
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,363
Speaker 0: Or move down.

913
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:12,900
Speaker 1: Maybe they reintegrate with the candy people.

914
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,680
Speaker 0: Where the Lemons leave the, you know, abandon the event, the Lemon Kingdom.

915
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,020
Speaker 1: Well, I kind of like that more if they don't tell you how that resolved itself.

916
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:24,034
Speaker 2: The Lemon stuff?

917
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:24,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

918
00:40:24,781 --> 00:40:26,340
Speaker 2: But that would mean we wouldn't see Lemon Grab again.

919
00:40:26,441 --> 00:40:26,844
Speaker 2: We have to.

920
00:40:27,106 --> 00:40:28,679
Speaker 1: We could keep seeing Lemon Grab because...

921
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,459
Speaker 0: What else is he going to do?

922
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,659
Speaker 1: That could have resolved itself 500 years down the road.

923
00:40:33,582 --> 00:40:35,000
Speaker 2: He's going to come back and scream some more.

924
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,807
Speaker 2: That's all I need.

925
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:37,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's acceptable.

926
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:38,699
Speaker 1: Is it now?

927
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:48,480
Speaker 1: What we need is the episode where, like, LSP goes on an exchange program to cast a Lemon Grab to try and make diplomatic relations.

928
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,880
Speaker 0: That's another kind of combo, right?

929
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,300
Speaker 0: It's some Lemon Grab plus Marceline.

930
00:40:51,481 --> 00:40:58,894
Speaker 1: Well, they did have that episode where it was Lemon Grab, Tree Trunks, The Little Worm, Shelby, Ice King.

931
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,758
Speaker 0: I loved that episode.

932
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,600
Speaker 0: Sesame Street.

933
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,428
Speaker 1: That episode was...

934
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:08,070
Speaker 2: What does that noise mean?

935
00:41:08,711 --> 00:41:10,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, the episode where the armor is so...

936
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,549
Speaker 1: That's season one, that armor.

937
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,349
Speaker 1: Chews Goose's armor.

938
00:41:13,711 --> 00:41:15,229
Speaker 2: Oh, I only saw that one once, actually.

939
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:16,530
Speaker 0: That's one of my favorite episodes.

940
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:17,419
Speaker 0: It's so... Really?

941
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:18,224
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

942
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,830
Speaker 1: Scott just really likes Chews Goose.

943
00:41:20,913 --> 00:41:22,749
Speaker 1: Like, really likes Chews Goose.

944
00:41:23,893 --> 00:41:37,310
Speaker 1: Well... But I expected the show, because up until now, every time they've introduced some of these big plotty things, they ratchet down the tension within five or six episodes tops.

945
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:43,789
Speaker 1: But since the Flame Princess incident, like, they've just left that hanging and they've referenced it.

946
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:48,309
Speaker 1: And every time they've referenced it or gone back toward it, they've just ratcheted it up more.

947
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:53,290
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the only way they resolved it this time was to give Finn even greater grief than losing his girlfriend.

948
00:41:53,711 --> 00:42:03,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like any episode you watch, even if it doesn't even mention it at all, it's like, they'll be like, for like a second, you know, Finn will be like, "Hmm," or something.

949
00:42:03,792 --> 00:42:05,309
Speaker 0: And you just can't not think about it.

950
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,267
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like if someone hadn't seen those earlier episodes, they wouldn't think that.

951
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:12,909
Speaker 0: But it's just like just seeing the characters there.

952
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:17,990
Speaker 0: You think about all the things that they're carrying because you're carrying them because you saw that shit.

953
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,290
Speaker 1: And they haven't unburdened us.

954
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,430
Speaker 0: Even if they don't mention it or show it or anything.

955
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:23,550
Speaker 1: Like Billy's bucket list, like that episode.

956
00:42:24,273 --> 00:42:30,490
Speaker 1: I mean, one, they introduced what's-your-name, Billy's ex-girlfriend, Canyon, who's kind of awesome in a big way.

957
00:42:31,251 --> 00:42:43,829
Speaker 1: And just now we had, like he was talking to that Cloud girl and they keep introducing him to female characters in the same manner that they originally introduced him to Flame Princess, in the sense that it's just sort of this character that's there.

958
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,129
Speaker 0: That's how Marceline showed up.

959
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're all just passing by.

960
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,930
Speaker 1: And every time you see Finn just continuing to not deal with his issues.

961
00:42:52,011 --> 00:42:56,150
Speaker 2: Most of the characters Finn has met, encountered, or helped since the beginning has been female.

962
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,985
Speaker 1: That is true.

963
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,510
Speaker 2: I don't know if the intention behind that has changed since the beginning and it's slowly evolving.

964
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,710
Speaker 2: I think that is the case because it was just like rescue stuff in the beginning.

965
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:11,370
Speaker 1: And they, well, they used to make a lot of jokes about how all the princesses really want to marry Finn.

966
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,410
Speaker 0: Well, I even saw that in the tower.

967
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,950
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, all these princesses bought you all these gloves, fake arms, Finn.

968
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,509
Speaker 1: So they reference that again, meaning maybe they're leading up to something again.

969
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:27,209
Speaker 0: I think there was an episode on the list of upcoming episodes that it was something princess.

970
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,510
Speaker 1: Sad face, food chain, princess day.

971
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:30,629
Speaker 0: There you go.

972
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,390
Speaker 1: That one's written.

973
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,690
Speaker 1: Oh, that's, uh, so, uh, try to look at who did it.

974
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,570
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll learn something about all these similar crowns.

975
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,149
Speaker 0: All the princesses wear some shit.

976
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:42,710
Speaker 1: Well, we learned about that with the Enchiridion stuff way back.

977
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:44,348
Speaker 1: What else more are they going to do?

978
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:52,710
Speaker 1: So I think the loudest I laughed in all of Adventure Time was when LSP's Crystal just bounced off the Enchiridion and wasn't involved.

979
00:43:54,052 --> 00:43:56,029
Speaker 1: I laughed out loud so hard.

980
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,549
Speaker 1: Like, I think back to that moment as being something that I really enjoy.

981
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,889
Speaker 2: One of the moments that squicked me out the most from the show was when they were pulling it out of her head.

982
00:44:08,453 --> 00:44:08,614
Speaker 0: Right.

983
00:44:08,634 --> 00:44:10,089
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, we know.

984
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,850
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's quick.

985
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:12,890
Speaker 1: Me out is anytime True Trunks is talking.

986
00:44:13,091 --> 00:44:13,232
Speaker 1: Right.

987
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:16,969
Speaker 0: We know that much about the Enchiridion, but it's like, where did the Enchiridion come from?

988
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:17,819
Speaker 0: Who created it?

989
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:18,589
Speaker 0: Why did Billy have it?

990
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:19,369
Speaker 0: Who wrote that shit, right?

991
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:24,109
Speaker 0: It's like, we know this post-apocalyptic stuff we know at least enough about.

992
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:25,131
Speaker 0: Right.

993
00:44:25,152 --> 00:44:30,550
Speaker 0: Like, how other than radiation did you get from the post-apocalypse to the magical world?

994
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,870
Speaker 0: You know, where did these specific magic things come from?

995
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:33,828
Speaker 0: Like, where did the Lich come from?

996
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:44,550
Speaker 1: Well, the Lich was, I mean, either that bomb blowing up in that place released something that was always there or that bomb itself was special in some way.

997
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's stuff like that, right?

998
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,349
Speaker 2: That bomb seemed to be the thing that released not only destruction, but also magic into the world.

999
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:50,892
Speaker 1: Yep.

1000
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:52,410
Speaker 1: But with magic comes the Lich.

1001
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,230
Speaker 0: Yes.

1002
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:53,681
Speaker 0: Sure.

1003
00:44:54,351 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 2: Because a world where the Lich never existed is one where the bomb never went off.

1004
00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:59,090
Speaker 0: But what about the rest of the universe?

1005
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,969
Speaker 0: Like, the shit on Mars and whatnot and other dimensions and...

1006
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,180
Speaker 1: That's something they have not addressed very well.

1007
00:45:04,381 --> 00:45:14,250
Speaker 1: is the rest of the cosmos, because that was much more sinister and mysterious all the way up through when the Prismo stuff happened, and now it's getting increasingly humorous.

1008
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,550
Speaker 0: They've run out of room on ooze that are reaching into space more frequently.

1009
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:26,810
Speaker 1: Like, the space stuff is being more and more prominent, which is interesting, but at the same time, it removes the sort of ominousness of the fact that there is an outside world.

1010
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:33,635
Speaker 1: Like, the fact that everything that we'd seen up to this point could have been undone by Prismo in one wish is not as ominous.

1011
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:37,990
Speaker 1: now that there's basically Green Lantern space stuff happening and space is dead.

1012
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:38,932
Speaker 1: Space is dead.

1013
00:45:38,992 --> 00:45:40,076
Speaker 1: Finn's dead in space.

1014
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:43,349
Speaker 1: The space Hitler is out doing his thing and, like, wherever he is...

1015
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:44,710
Speaker 0: You gotta assume he's space Hitler.

1016
00:45:45,316 --> 00:45:46,470
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure he's space Hitler.

1017
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:49,210
Speaker 0: But think about all those other space Hitlers that were also released.

1018
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,350
Speaker 1: No, those are space Goibels.

1019
00:45:51,134 --> 00:45:51,324
Speaker 1: Okay.

1020
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,374
Speaker 1: They're not Hitler.

1021
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,890
Speaker 1: They're not... He's the leader of the space Hitlers already.

1022
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:57,010
Speaker 1: He became their leader in, what, eight seconds?

1023
00:45:57,917 --> 00:45:58,107
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1024
00:45:59,315 --> 00:45:59,769
Speaker 2: Maybe less.

1025
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:02,535
Speaker 1: I wonder if he was always their leader.

1026
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:06,250
Speaker 1: I wonder if everyone on that place was arrested with him.

1027
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,310
Speaker 2: They're not going to revisit that again for a while.

1028
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,350
Speaker 2: They're going to treat it the same way they did with the Lich Stuff.

1029
00:46:12,912 --> 00:46:14,198
Speaker 1: Which I think is fine.

1030
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,790
Speaker 1: I'm more interested in resolving Finn's emotional baggage.

1031
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:31,310
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe they're going to work on, you know, I would put "resolve" in quotes because that's a lot of shit to get over, but they're going to work on building us back up to some fun episodes, not just, like, one interspersed with all these depressing ones like we've been getting.

1032
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:31,791
Speaker 1: Yep.

1033
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:40,146
Speaker 1: Well, James 2 was the most back to old Adventure Time we've seen, I think, because it had all those scenes where Finn and Jake are just like, "Yeah, we're going to sit this one

1034
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:40,350
Speaker 1: out.".

1035
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:40,848
Speaker 1: That was funny.

1036
00:46:41,232 --> 00:46:43,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're just in the background the whole time giggling and not getting involved.

1037
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:45,950
Speaker 2: And they got PB to chill for a little bit, too.

1038
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:53,130
Speaker 1: That's my favorite scene when they're all up there laughing and you see the Banana Guard and the James both trying to work it out, can't quite get there.

1039
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:57,023
Speaker 2: Yeah, PB's sitting out there being like, "Yeah, I made those idiots.

1040
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:58,289
Speaker 2: God damn

1041
00:46:58,330 --> 00:46:58,370
Speaker 2: it.".

1042
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:04,504
Speaker 0: Those are definitely some of my favorite episodes, the ones where it's just Adventure Time, like the one where she's like, "Finn goes in the dungeon,

1043
00:47:04,545 --> 00:47:04,686
Speaker 0: woooo!".

1044
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:06,649
Speaker 0: That's the whole episode, right?

1045
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:11,148
Speaker 0: Or even the one where the armor is, "It's about questing, adventuring, and...".

1046
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:17,929
Speaker 1: Most of those episodes from season four-ish onward have had moments of issues.

1047
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,069
Speaker 0: Or even like Infinity Train.

1048
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:29,430
Speaker 1: But it's interesting because the more I watch the show, the more I want to see those issues and see that stuff be addressed.

1049
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:33,090
Speaker 1: Yet, as you kind of pointed out, that's the opposite of what young kids want to see.

1050
00:47:33,652 --> 00:47:33,959
Speaker 0: Maybe.

1051
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:34,409
Speaker 0: Who knows?

1052
00:47:35,131 --> 00:47:37,890
Speaker 2: Maybe they're trying to Harry Potter it and have it actually grow with its audience.

1053
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:43,189
Speaker 2: But there will be a time when most of that audience will just stop watching Cartoon Network because they suck.

1054
00:47:43,951 --> 00:47:46,209
Speaker 1: I think most of the people who watch Adventure Time pirate it.

1055
00:47:48,111 --> 00:47:54,870
Speaker 1: I mean, every Tuesday when I go to watch the episode, I'll just note that the Pirate Bay has a lot of people seeing Adventure Time.

1056
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,430
Speaker 0: There is sort of a thing happening.

1057
00:47:57,751 --> 00:47:59,370
Speaker 0: My coworker, he has a baby.

1058
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:02,250
Speaker 0: The baby's maybe not even one or whatever.

1059
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:05,390
Speaker 0: But he watches Adventure Time with the baby.

1060
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,389
Speaker 0: And he says the closing song puts the baby to sleep.

1061
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:08,408
Speaker 0: The one with the bees.

1062
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

1063
00:48:11,451 --> 00:48:21,070
Speaker 0: So it's like, you're gonna see people with babies who want adults, 20, 30 year olds who make babies watch Adventure Time with their kids.

1064
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:21,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1065
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,630
Speaker 1: But they can, you know what?

1066
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,168
Speaker 1: They can do a thing like newspaper comics too.

1067
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,170
Speaker 0: More so than the other shows.

1068
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,950
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like other shows appeal to adults as well.

1069
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:30,790
Speaker 0: Powerpuff Girls, Ponies, whatever.

1070
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:38,750
Speaker 0: But I think Adventure Time more so is one that people will actually watch together and spread to younger folk, right?

1071
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:43,270
Speaker 0: And especially with having it available on many, many formats.

1072
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:49,670
Speaker 0: It's like if you have my parents' cable, you can just watch every episode on demand up to like the newest one.

1073
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,470
Speaker 2: Yeah, Adventure Time is going for staying power.

1074
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,850
Speaker 2: I mean, they pretty much already have that.

1075
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,550
Speaker 0: So people can definitely start at the beginning with ease, even if they're not pirates.

1076
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:57,509
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I was getting at.

1077
00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:04,070
Speaker 1: The beauty of Adventure Time is that because it had, I mean, the show really, really evolved season to season.

1078
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:07,930
Speaker 1: Like season one is vastly different from seasons three and four.

1079
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,650
Speaker 0: So is any long running show, Simpsons, Flintstones?

1080
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,410
Speaker 2: No, this is a really stark difference.

1081
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,178
Speaker 1: And Sailor Moon episode 199, not that different.

1082
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:17,489
Speaker 2: Not the best example though.

1083
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm talking about long running American shows.

1084
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,450
Speaker 1: Okay, so long running American shows.

1085
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,869
Speaker 1: Like Ponies, pretty much the same so far.

1086
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:28,590
Speaker 2: Powerpuff Girls still, status quo is God.

1087
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:29,109
Speaker 1: Yep.

1088
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,150
Speaker 1: Nothing ever affects the Powerpuff Girls universe.

1089
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,830
Speaker 0: I didn't even know that show was still going.

1090
00:49:34,332 --> 00:49:35,110
Speaker 2: It's been remade.

1091
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:36,150
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1092
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,670
Speaker 1: But because the archives exist is the kind of show that like we'll watch.

1093
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:48,458
Speaker 1: And then if we add babies, we could start again from season one and we know where it's going.

1094
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:50,550
Speaker 1: so we can just kind of watch it as the kid grows up.

1095
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,370
Speaker 0: I don't know, Judith, do you actually watch it on real TV?

1096
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:54,109
Speaker 0: No, I don't have real TV.

1097
00:49:54,870 --> 00:50:00,390
Speaker 0: Okay, but I heard from someone who had real TV that what happens is the episodes are only like half an episode slot, right?

1098
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,490
Speaker 0: That what they'll do is when you go to watch the new Adventure Time, if it's not a two-parter, right?

1099
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:09,559
Speaker 0: In the first half of the 30-minute slot, they'll show the old episode.

1100
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,590
Speaker 0: that's relevant to the new episode, right?

1101
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,729
Speaker 0: So that you know what the hell's going on.

1102
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,330
Speaker 2: Typically, yeah.

1103
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,590
Speaker 2: Anytime I've caught it on cable, that's what they've been doing.

1104
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:16,483
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like...

1105
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:17,629
Speaker 1: Ponies does the same thing.

1106
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:24,870
Speaker 0: Right, so if you're starting out and that's part of what... It's weird how they cram so much into these short episodes.

1107
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, more happens in these short Adventure Time episodes than in like an hour of a lot of shows I like.

1108
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:36,090
Speaker 0: It's like they really use like... There'll be scenes or shots that are like less than a second that say like 10 million things, right?

1109
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,610
Speaker 0: That no other show can pull that off really, right now at least.

1110
00:50:39,351 --> 00:50:46,090
Speaker 0: But you know, that first slot, they'll be like, "Oh, okay, so this episode's gonna be about Flame Princess again.

1111
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:49,108
Speaker 0: We're gonna show the last appearance of Flame Princess in the first

1112
00:50:49,148 --> 00:50:49,390
Speaker 0: slot.".

1113
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:54,030
Speaker 2: Some people analyze which episodes are paired with the new ones to foreshadow things.

1114
00:50:55,212 --> 00:51:00,970
Speaker 2: When Betty premiered, it was paired with I Remember You, which is a pretty obvious connection, but they were laying it on thick.

1115
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,986
Speaker 0: But it's like they couldn't do that if the episode was full 20, 30 minutes long.

1116
00:51:05,170 --> 00:51:09,588
Speaker 0: You wouldn't have, you know, there wouldn't be a time slot for it unless they made it an hour long thing, you know.

1117
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:20,510
Speaker 1: Of course, at the same time, technology, if this was just internet distribution, you could just have every episode has the paired episodes that are relevant to this episode.

1118
00:51:22,275 --> 00:51:22,890
Speaker 1: Just kind of there.

1119
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:23,989
Speaker 1: Watch it if you want to or not.

1120
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:32,390
Speaker 0: Make a website that is every Adventure Time episode, not necessarily in order, right, but with arrows pointing to the ones that, you know, come off of it, right?

1121
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,369
Speaker 1: Just make a web.

1122
00:51:34,131 --> 00:51:36,810
Speaker 0: And then, you know, a website where you can, like, search the episode.

1123
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:39,110
Speaker 0: So it could be like, "Show me every episode with Chews Goose.

1124
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,530
Speaker 0: Show me every episode with Lumpy Space Princess.

1125
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:43,966
Speaker 0: Show me every episode with Hot Dog

1126
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:44,369
Speaker 0: Princess.".

1127
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:46,290
Speaker 2: I think there's only like three episodes with Chews Goose.

1128
00:51:46,912 --> 00:51:47,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not that common.

1129
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:50,530
Speaker 0: He's in at least five or six episodes.

1130
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,950
Speaker 1: It's probably a pain in the ass to write.

1131
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:53,849
Speaker 1: It's probably why Zecora doesn't say that much either.

1132
00:51:56,594 --> 00:51:57,529
Speaker 0: He's in the video games.

1133
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,649
Speaker 1: I like in the comic, Flame Princess tricks the fake Chews Goose by getting him to say the word purple and then he just spazzes out.

1134
00:52:05,937 --> 00:52:06,589
Speaker 2: I remember that.

1135
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,030
Speaker 1: Of course, the comic continuity.

1136
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,089
Speaker 1: Flame Princess and Finn are just dating and everything's cool.

1137
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,050
Speaker 0: So does the comic even count?

1138
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,490
Speaker 2: There's several different comics.

1139
00:52:13,771 --> 00:52:14,289
Speaker 2: None of them count.

1140
00:52:15,151 --> 00:52:18,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, the comics are all very different in timbre and tone, too.

1141
00:52:19,390 --> 00:52:20,470
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on who's the writer.

1142
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:25,190
Speaker 0: They haven't had like just one set of people writing the whole thing from start to finish, right?

1143
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,490
Speaker 1: Well, Adventure Time is not that way either.

1144
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,050
Speaker 1: There is a wide cast of people who write in storyboard.

1145
00:52:30,774 --> 00:52:31,630
Speaker 0: That is sort of interesting.

1146
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,770
Speaker 0: One thing that really interests me is you look at the list of Adventure Time episodes.

1147
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,210
Speaker 1: I mean, look, Episode 79, Hot to the Touch.

1148
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,009
Speaker 1: Cole Sanchez, Rebecca Sugar.

1149
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,588
Speaker 1: The next episode, Five Short Gravels.

1150
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,610
Speaker 1: Tim Herpich, Skylar Page, and Cole Sanchez.

1151
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:45,450
Speaker 0: Right, but those episodes have nothing to do with each other.

1152
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,590
Speaker 0: Look at the first two episodes of this season, which are pretty much tied together as one episode.

1153
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:51,230
Speaker 0: Different writers.

1154
00:52:52,412 --> 00:52:55,330
Speaker 0: These people must have some kind of communication going on.

1155
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:56,910
Speaker 2: They all work in the same studio.

1156
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,548
Speaker 0: They're all on the same page all the time.

1157
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,370
Speaker 1: You know there's a continuity Bible.

1158
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,908
Speaker 0: Right, but like other people who can't seem to pull it off when they have different writers like that.

1159
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:08,090
Speaker 2: And they all have a discussion before they finalize the storyboard.

1160
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,009
Speaker 2: Like everybody meets and discusses the script.

1161
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:15,370
Speaker 0: How come other shows don't have all their writers so tight with each other like that?

1162
00:53:15,471 --> 00:53:15,989
Speaker 2: Because they suck more.

1163
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:17,388
Speaker 0: I guess that's true.

1164
00:53:17,872 --> 00:53:22,049
Speaker 1: I might come out of the fact that how Adventure Time started and came to be.

1165
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:30,050
Speaker 1: A group of friends who trusted each other bring other professional people who they trust in and they give each other a lot of leeway.

1166
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,050
Speaker 1: Which you don't see with other things.

1167
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,595
Speaker 1: It's like South Park.

1168
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:37,510
Speaker 1: has that going to a degree that they only bring people in who they trust.

1169
00:53:38,212 --> 00:53:38,890
Speaker 1: A hundred percent.

1170
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,409
Speaker 0: The South Park didn't bring people in?

1171
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:42,769
Speaker 1: Well they brought people in until they had enough people.

1172
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,389
Speaker 1: But there's nobody on their crew.

1173
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:47,510
Speaker 0: Most of their people are animators.

1174
00:53:48,131 --> 00:53:50,830
Speaker 1: Yeah but I'm saying the people in their crew are people they trust a hundred percent.

1175
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:52,990
Speaker 1: Like this guy's gonna get the comment right.

1176
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,845
Speaker 0: People who work 24 hours a day for six weeks a year and then the rest of the year take off.

1177
00:53:58,131 --> 00:54:01,109
Speaker 1: I kind of really want that production schedule in my life.

1178
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:06,810
Speaker 0: Just we'll make geek nights for like six months out of the year and the other six months do nothing.

1179
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:07,430
Speaker 1: Like Penny Arcade.

1180
00:54:08,934 --> 00:54:14,067
Speaker 1: The four paxes should be on four weekends in a row and then they don't do anything the rest of the year.

1181
00:54:16,361 --> 00:54:16,590
Speaker 0: Sure.

1182
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:24,490
Speaker 0: Microhoolik just goes and draws all the comics for the whole year and I'm in a month and the rest of the year doesn't do anything.

1183
00:54:28,336 --> 00:54:29,289
Speaker 1: But Adventure Time?

1184
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:37,128
Speaker 1: I think it still is my consistently most favorite cartoon that I'm watching or have watched in recent memory.

1185
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:39,624
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's my favorite.

1186
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:40,989
Speaker 1: I really like ponies.

1187
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:44,370
Speaker 0: But because it's so long and it just doesn't stop, right?

1188
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,575
Speaker 0: It's like all other.

1189
00:54:45,836 --> 00:54:49,430
Speaker 0: regardless of how much I like Adventure Time relative to say something like Kill la Kill.

1190
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:50,949
Speaker 0: It's like, well, Kill la Kill's over.

1191
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:51,326
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1192
00:54:51,611 --> 00:54:53,690
Speaker 0: So even if I like that more, it's gone.

1193
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:56,930
Speaker 0: And, you know, Adventure Time, at least for now, looks like it ain't going anywhere.

1194
00:54:57,551 --> 00:55:09,469
Speaker 0: So it just by the fact that it'll just always be there, regardless of how much you like it, it will have a stronger emotional bond to you simply because time makes the heart grow fonder, I guess.

1195
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,109
Speaker 2: Sometimes.

1196
00:55:11,633 --> 00:55:14,370
Speaker 2: Adventure Time is my American cartoon favorite hands down.

1197
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:15,388
Speaker 2: It beats out ponies like.

1198
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:15,949
Speaker 0: Wow.

1199
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:16,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

1200
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,510
Speaker 0: He's beaten ponies now.

1201
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,650
Speaker 1: There was a time where, for me, ponies would have beaten Adventure Time.

1202
00:55:21,872 --> 00:55:23,030
Speaker 1: But that time is long gone.

1203
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:24,089
Speaker 0: In the middle of season one.

1204
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:27,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe through season two of ponies.

1205
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:28,629
Speaker 0: Not really, no.

1206
00:55:29,011 --> 00:55:30,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, season two of ponies.

1207
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,410
Speaker 1: Because what was contemporary Adventure Time at that point that you were watching?

1208
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,469
Speaker 0: I didn't watch any Adventure Time.

1209
00:55:36,671 --> 00:55:39,765
Speaker 1: But also the time between seasons is pretty short.

1210
00:55:39,785 --> 00:55:40,830
Speaker 1: with Adventure Time, I've noticed.

1211
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:45,070
Speaker 1: Compared to, say, Archer, which just stops for a long time before it starts up again.

1212
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,489
Speaker 0: Also, the Adventure Time season has so many episodes.

1213
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,730
Speaker 2: Season five, I think it played for like a year or a year and a half.

1214
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:53,930
Speaker 0: How do they even count when the season?

1215
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,570
Speaker 0: Aren't they supposed to start and stop seasons at the same time as every other show starts?

1216
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:01,290
Speaker 2: Season five was a little weird because it was split into season 5.1 and 5.2.

1217
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,430
Speaker 2: And it's twice the length of any other season.

1218
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,570
Speaker 0: The first 5.1, 5 and 5.26.

1219
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,049
Speaker 0: Who knows?

1220
00:56:07,591 --> 00:56:08,990
Speaker 1: They have stupid reasons for this stuff.

1221
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:14,270
Speaker 1: I was reading a long article about how Hasbro does its seasons and when they do a half season or a whole season of ponies.

1222
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:16,450
Speaker 1: And it depends on these marketing metrics.

1223
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:18,130
Speaker 1: It's all this complicated crap.

1224
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:26,270
Speaker 0: I've been noticing the live action shows that I don't watch, but my co-workers are talking about how what they'll do is like, okay, this is the last season of Mad Men.

1225
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:33,390
Speaker 0: Instead of just making it the last season, they'll just take it and cut it in half to make two seasons to make the show last another year or whatever, right?

1226
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:39,229
Speaker 0: Even though they won't make any more episodes, they'll just take that last season and cut it in half just to drag the show a little bit more.

1227
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:39,942
Speaker 0: It's like, why?

1228
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,969
Speaker 0: Does it really, you know, just to keep it in people's mindshare for another 12 months or whatever.

1229
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:47,710
Speaker 0: I don't know what these people are thinking.

1230
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:51,410
Speaker 1: So let's try to predict what's going to happen in the rest of the season.

1231
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,230
Speaker 0: Right, because our obvious prediction of arms getting off, well, it happened, right?

1232
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,570
Speaker 1: So where is this going?

1233
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:57,870
Speaker 1: Judith, where's adventure time going?

1234
00:56:57,970 --> 00:56:59,430
Speaker 2: Pin's gotta find a replacement.

1235
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:00,686
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

1236
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:02,370
Speaker 1: Arm or girlfriend?

1237
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:04,190
Speaker 2: I don't know about girlfriend.

1238
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:07,689
Speaker 2: Flame Princess has got to be addressed again for sure.

1239
00:57:08,611 --> 00:57:09,590
Speaker 2: I don't know where that's going.

1240
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:19,570
Speaker 2: At first I thought that her kingdom was going to fall apart because her policy for just honesty seemed so naive and doomed that I thought that the kingdom was going to have like an internal war or something.

1241
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,590
Speaker 2: But that doesn't, well, that didn't work.

1242
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,589
Speaker 1: I think it helps that all the subjects of the flame kingdom are actually really derpy.

1243
00:57:26,451 --> 00:57:27,890
Speaker 1: They're not the brightest.

1244
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,090
Speaker 0: Not even Flame King.

1245
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,189
Speaker 0: Flame King's derpy too.

1246
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:32,570
Speaker 1: Flame King is really bad at conspiracies.

1247
00:57:32,872 --> 00:57:35,126
Speaker 0: Even his Boba Fett guy is dumb as shit.

1248
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:37,489
Speaker 1: That guy was totally a Boba Fett though.

1249
00:57:37,952 --> 00:57:39,230
Speaker 0: I don't remember his name.

1250
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,650
Speaker 0: Every time he was on screen, I'm like, that's the Flame King's Boba Fett.

1251
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,550
Speaker 2: It's really hard to predict adventure time though.

1252
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,290
Speaker 2: I typically don't try to unless I find something extremely obvious.

1253
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,230
Speaker 1: Like I can predict the really broad strokes, but that's as far as I've gotten.

1254
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,549
Speaker 1: All my specifics have pretty much been wrong unilaterally.

1255
00:58:00,036 --> 00:58:00,463
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

1256
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:11,250
Speaker 0: Well, the one, the only thing that like is, is strong in my memory of like a loose end is the episode where Marceline and the doll or whatever, and the witch took the shit away.

1257
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:11,620
Speaker 0: Right.

1258
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,690
Speaker 0: It's like that witch is coming back hardcore.

1259
00:58:14,181 --> 00:58:14,330
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1260
00:58:15,015 --> 00:58:16,030
Speaker 2: She said she was coming back.

1261
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:16,590
Speaker 0: That's right.

1262
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,650
Speaker 0: That's, that's, that's the thing that's been looming.

1263
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:27,810
Speaker 1: And in the Betty episode, sort of like intentionally forgotten and un, in the Betty episode, we saw specifically why objects like that are so powerful.

1264
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:29,690
Speaker 1: Think about what that means.

1265
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:38,829
Speaker 1: This is an object that has power over either Princess Bubblegum or her legacy for as long as that shirt has been existing and treasured.

1266
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,570
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

1267
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:49,530
Speaker 1: Which means theoretically the Sky Witch could mess with the origin of the Candy Kingdom in the same way that Ice King messed with his own backstory.

1268
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:57,530
Speaker 2: Except she doesn't because the Candy Kingdom continues to grow and expand until it's eventually abandoned within the span of a thousand years from the point that we're watching.

1269
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:01,130
Speaker 1: Well, abandoned, moved, was it just the Lemon Kingdom?

1270
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:03,790
Speaker 0: Maybe there were just some people who really liked fucking candy.

1271
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,850
Speaker 2: That wasn't the Lemon Kingdom.

1272
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:05,810
Speaker 2: That was the Candy Kingdom.

1273
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,650
Speaker 2: You could see the castle in the middle.

1274
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:09,370
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you're right.

1275
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:09,830
Speaker 1: You're right.

1276
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:12,109
Speaker 0: Maybe if you just really liked candy and ate it.

1277
00:59:12,391 --> 00:59:12,787
Speaker 1: You know what?

1278
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:17,810
Speaker 1: Maybe that's just that deer came back and kidnapped everyone again.

1279
00:59:18,312 --> 00:59:18,466
Speaker 0: Yes.

1280
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:21,630
Speaker 0: That's the kind of, that's the kind of thing that deer was basically just this joke.

1281
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,281
Speaker 0: That would be the lamest thing.

1282
00:59:23,321 --> 00:59:24,490
Speaker 2: that that deer died, by the way.

1283
00:59:25,052 --> 00:59:25,448
Speaker 0: Oh, did it?

1284
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:25,730
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1285
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,410
Speaker 2: Magic Man turned him into a telescope.

1286
00:59:28,194 --> 00:59:28,850
Speaker 1: He's not dead then.

1287
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:29,690
Speaker 1: He's just a telescope.

1288
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:30,127
Speaker 1: He's dead.

1289
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:30,930
Speaker 2: Confirmed.

1290
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,929
Speaker 2: Word of God.

1291
00:59:33,292 --> 00:59:36,190
Speaker 1: I do not believe in word of God when it comes to analyzing shows.

1292
00:59:37,374 --> 00:59:38,330
Speaker 0: What is this word of God?

1293
00:59:38,552 --> 00:59:38,890
Speaker 2: I don't know.

1294
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,210
Speaker 2: Somebody asked if that was the same deer who got turned into a telescope and is it now dead?

1295
00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:44,910
Speaker 2: I think they asked at one of the panels at a convention.

1296
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

1297
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:48,510
Speaker 0: I was talking about the deer in the tower episode that we just saw.

1298
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:49,208
Speaker 2: Oh, that deer?

1299
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,310
Speaker 2: Maybe that was his father.

1300
00:59:52,592 --> 00:59:53,410
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why he's alone.

1301
00:59:55,771 --> 00:59:57,230
Speaker 1: But that deer is just a telescope.

1302
00:59:57,514 --> 00:59:58,610
Speaker 1: So it's dead temporarily.

1303
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,889
Speaker 1: We could turn it back into a deer.

1304
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,288
Speaker 2: Nobody's ever going to find that deer again.

1305
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:04,030
Speaker 2: Magic Man isn't anyway.

1306
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,247
Speaker 1: Magic Man.

1307
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,790
Speaker 0: Who's the, who's the, the other thing is who's the shitty magician guy?

1308
01:00:10,495 --> 01:00:10,890
Speaker 0: The shitty wizard.

1309
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,070
Speaker 1: What, Avrica Daniel?

1310
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:12,583
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1311
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,166
Speaker 0: There's something up with him too.

1312
01:00:14,673 --> 01:00:15,730
Speaker 1: He kind of got resolved.

1313
01:00:16,270 --> 01:00:19,210
Speaker 2: Kind of, but he's just like Ice King's bestie for a while and then he ditched.

1314
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:20,250
Speaker 1: That's about it.

1315
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:20,621
Speaker 1: Yup.

1316
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:22,470
Speaker 0: There's something.

1317
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,130
Speaker 0: The fact that they even brought him back at all, right?

1318
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,330
Speaker 0: Beyond his one episode.

1319
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:36,790
Speaker 1: I got to say, since they've kind of just spilled Ice King's entire load, it's really hard to watch any scene with Ice King without just being really depressed about Alzheimer's.

1320
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:38,498
Speaker 0: I'm kind of, I'm kind of glad that there's.

1321
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:42,150
Speaker 0: no, we haven't even seen Ice King since then because I don't like Ice King.

1322
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:42,830
Speaker 0: I never liked Ice King.

1323
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,370
Speaker 1: Well, Finn just fucked up his house apparently in the episode we just watched.

1324
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,630
Speaker 0: That's happened like 10 million times.

1325
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:48,029
Speaker 1: I know.

1326
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:49,290
Speaker 0: He just makes a new one with his ice powers.

1327
01:00:49,330 --> 01:00:56,490
Speaker 2: One thing I can predict is Betty's presence in Ooo means that the Ice King will eventually become cured and returned to being Simon.

1328
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:57,687
Speaker 2: Otherwise they wouldn't have kept her there.

1329
01:00:58,711 --> 01:01:01,429
Speaker 1: Or, well, they could do something really tragic with that.

1330
01:01:02,516 --> 01:01:02,667
Speaker 2: What?

1331
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:04,448
Speaker 0: What would that be?

1332
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:11,550
Speaker 1: Maybe she finds a way to give him succor and peace and there is no cure.

1333
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:12,749
Speaker 1: And maybe that's the moral.

1334
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,410
Speaker 2: Maybe that would be super dark.

1335
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be.

1336
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:28,050
Speaker 1: But it's weird because as an adult who likes media and has seen a lot of movies, I'm almost as I get older, I'm drawn more and more towards shocking, dark, severe endings to things.

1337
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:31,590
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I'm almost pleasantly surprised when that doesn't happen.

1338
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,470
Speaker 2: That would be killing a major character.

1339
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:34,728
Speaker 2: I don't know if they could get away with that.

1340
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:40,510
Speaker 1: But at the same time, they can't use him for his original purpose anymore.

1341
01:01:41,350 --> 01:01:42,490
Speaker 2: Being creepy and sad.

1342
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:49,590
Speaker 1: Creep, but creepy, sad and hilariously stealing princesses is now just creepy and sad when it happens.

1343
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:52,810
Speaker 2: That's probably why they're giving him some time, because they can't do anything.

1344
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:55,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how do they bring him back without it being depressing?

1345
01:01:55,610 --> 01:02:01,828
Speaker 1: Any time he steals a princess now, it's, oh, Ice King with Alzheimer's stole a princess because he's fucked up.

1346
01:02:02,392 --> 01:02:03,010
Speaker 1: How tragic.

1347
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:03,949
Speaker 2: Bet he's still out there.

1348
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,010
Speaker 2: Maybe maybe she'll come back if she's watching over him.

1349
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,749
Speaker 2: Maybe she'll stop him from doing that shit.

1350
01:02:08,371 --> 01:02:14,387
Speaker 0: Maybe they can somehow get him to where, you know, like you basically they can have their cake and eat it, too.

1351
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,910
Speaker 0: Like, oh, he knows he's Simon, but he's still a kooky ice king.

1352
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:18,728
Speaker 0: Right.

1353
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:21,890
Speaker 0: Like he gets his memory back and he's somewhere in the middle.

1354
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:22,370
Speaker 0: Right.

1355
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:26,230
Speaker 0: But he's still kooky and he's still, you know, likes ninjas.

1356
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:28,769
Speaker 1: But then he takes the mad scientist role away from peeps.

1357
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:31,030
Speaker 2: He's not a mad scientist.

1358
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:32,990
Speaker 1: That's what he would become if he had some memories.

1359
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,069
Speaker 2: And he believes in all the kind of stuff that she doesn't.

1360
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,790
Speaker 2: So he would be on the opposite end of the spectrum.

1361
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:37,670
Speaker 1: She believes in magic.

1362
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,109
Speaker 1: She's just pissed off that it works.

1363
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,470
Speaker 2: She thinks magic is science or she denies that magic is anything but science.

1364
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, which she's probably right about.

1365
01:02:45,291 --> 01:02:46,949
Speaker 1: But at the same time, her science isn't quite there yet.

1366
01:02:48,232 --> 01:02:51,190
Speaker 1: I love how dismissive Jake is of her time travel.

1367
01:02:53,031 --> 01:02:54,048
Speaker 2: He was just like the viewer.

1368
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:56,989
Speaker 1: All right.

1369
01:02:57,150 --> 01:02:59,310
Speaker 1: Of course, granted, that episode, you know, we're talking about dark.

1370
01:02:59,552 --> 01:03:01,209
Speaker 1: That episode was fucked up.

1371
01:03:01,394 --> 01:03:01,624
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.

1372
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,929
Speaker 1: LSP murdered that dude.

1373
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,450
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he he got sent to another dimension.

1374
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,450
Speaker 2: He might as well be dead.

1375
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:08,724
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1376
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:15,469
Speaker 1: But when they first present that, oh, the time travel have that outside cool thing where you see that alternate world.

1377
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,377
Speaker 1: Then that episode is just.

1378
01:03:17,578 --> 01:03:21,590
Speaker 1: she killed him by cutting him in half and then sent the rest of the body to join the dead half.

1379
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:26,110
Speaker 2: Yeah, that episode premiered just around the end of season five.

1380
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:30,170
Speaker 2: And we thought it was going to be like a little breath of fresh air between all the tragic stuff.

1381
01:03:30,310 --> 01:03:30,805
Speaker 2: It wasn't.

1382
01:03:31,075 --> 01:03:31,250
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1383
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,530
Speaker 1: But look at the last major LSP episode we had.

1384
01:03:33,814 --> 01:03:34,450
Speaker 1: It was similarly.

1385
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:37,341
Speaker 0: I mean, the end, the more she's trying to get in the wedding and she's hiding in the woods.

1386
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:39,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just, wow, she's fucked up.

1387
01:03:39,911 --> 01:03:43,230
Speaker 1: And then the episode before that was her and the pizza guy.

1388
01:03:43,391 --> 01:03:46,990
Speaker 1: And the moral was Finn and Jake being like, oh, it's just LSP is emotional bullshit.

1389
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:49,370
Speaker 0: That's something they could resolve if they wanted to.

1390
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,250
Speaker 0: They could resolve bread.

1391
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,729
Speaker 0: They could be like, here's bread.

1392
01:03:52,292 --> 01:03:53,150
Speaker 2: Oh, who cares about bread?

1393
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:53,708
Speaker 0: I care about bread.

1394
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:54,546
Speaker 1: You want to end it?

1395
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:55,723
Speaker 0: He's probably so lumpy.

1396
01:03:57,011 --> 01:04:03,010
Speaker 2: Yeah, that that episode with LSP and Johnny, the guy who she not killed, that was actually storyboarded by Penn Ward himself.

1397
01:04:03,958 --> 01:04:04,190
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1398
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,088
Speaker 0: Twisted fucker.

1399
01:04:05,331 --> 01:04:06,349
Speaker 0: Doesn't he do the LSP voice?

1400
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:07,069
Speaker 0: Yes, he does.

1401
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,368
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1402
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:10,110
Speaker 2: So that one ended with Princess Bubblegum drinking.

1403
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:11,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did.

1404
01:04:12,611 --> 01:04:17,350
Speaker 1: Princess Bubblegum also is increasingly not a happy person.

1405
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,089
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's going to crack one day.

1406
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,909
Speaker 1: Yeah, because she's been a lot happier in older seasons.

1407
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,710
Speaker 1: She still had issues, still working on stuff, but she was a lot more good natured and easygoing.

1408
01:04:26,811 --> 01:04:30,110
Speaker 1: And now she seems to pretty much always be harried or angry.

1409
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:34,449
Speaker 2: They're evolving her character into something much more, I would say darker, but really much more neutral.

1410
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:38,669
Speaker 2: Just a character who believes the ends justify the means.

1411
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:41,422
Speaker 1: And of course, at the same time, the show has done nothing.

1412
01:04:41,482 --> 01:04:42,790
Speaker 1: but tell me that she is right.

1413
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:43,724
Speaker 2: I know.

1414
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:51,390
Speaker 2: I know they make us question her morally because she does things that make us very uncomfortable as people, but it doesn't prove her wrong ever.

1415
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:51,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1416
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:53,350
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, let's go all the way back.

1417
01:04:53,450 --> 01:05:04,269
Speaker 1: So, James, ignoring James 2, where he found out that James is just fucked up in his own way, the way that episode played out, it's pretty obvious that she brought him along to be cannon fodder.

1418
01:05:04,851 --> 01:05:07,730
Speaker 1: So it wasn't just that he died and he was expendable, so she made the choice.

1419
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:14,929
Speaker 1: She brought him to be expendable and then had to basically knock Finn out so she could expend him without him stopping her.

1420
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:15,933
Speaker 0: Well, that's her move.

1421
01:05:15,973 --> 01:05:27,770
Speaker 0: is that she's basically so much smarter than everybody and knows it, She knows it, but she can't possibly like, even if she's talking to banana guards, it's like, even if she's talking to Finn, she can't just say anything smart.

1422
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:30,349
Speaker 0: Imagine being so smart and literally everyone is dumb.

1423
01:05:30,831 --> 01:05:38,769
Speaker 1: Like, imagine if you were the only not crazy conservative person trying to explain to Finn or to Jake why Flame Princess is dangerous.

1424
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:40,508
Speaker 2: You just stop.

1425
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:42,410
Speaker 0: So imagine how frustrating that is.

1426
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:45,290
Speaker 0: Like you were literally the only intelligent person there is.

1427
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,688
Speaker 1: So why doesn't she just go talk to Prismo?

1428
01:05:47,941 --> 01:05:48,230
Speaker 1: I guess.

1429
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:49,187
Speaker 1: Well, I guess now she can't.

1430
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:50,337
Speaker 0: Well, that's why she hangs with.

1431
01:05:50,357 --> 01:05:53,289
Speaker 0: Marceline is like the only thing even close to being smart because she's so old.

1432
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:55,028
Speaker 1: Marceline is always kind of a bitch to her.

1433
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:55,609
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1434
01:05:55,871 --> 01:05:56,569
Speaker 2: Oh, they're getting better.

1435
01:05:56,997 --> 01:05:57,349
Speaker 1: They are.

1436
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:00,090
Speaker 2: Last time they hung out, it was really actually pretty friendly.

1437
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:06,130
Speaker 1: I miss Marceline not being pissed off and sad and just causing trouble for people.

1438
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:11,369
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're evolving her character into more of a good guy instead of this chaotic neutral thing.

1439
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:15,210
Speaker 1: She was always chaotic neutral with good tendencies, even from the beginning.

1440
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:23,550
Speaker 1: All of her pranks were funny and chaotic, but they weren't just chaotic neutral because she actually did prevent real harm from coming.

1441
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:25,847
Speaker 0: I think the very first Marceline episode ever, right?

1442
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:30,230
Speaker 0: At that point, I don't think she was meant to be this long recurring character, right?

1443
01:06:30,493 --> 01:06:31,629
Speaker 2: She killed Jake in her first.

1444
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:32,007
Speaker 2: Right.

1445
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:36,090
Speaker 0: In that very first episode, she knew she wouldn't kill one kind of character.

1446
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:40,628
Speaker 0: And then when they decided to make her recurring, they switched it up right in that second appearance.

1447
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,790
Speaker 0: They're like, oh, OK, she's just fooling around.

1448
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,729
Speaker 0: She's not actually just a one off bad guy monster of the week.

1449
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:56,469
Speaker 1: I just I miss episodes like when Finn needs help with his relationship stuff and she gives him the worst possible relationship advice in the world.

1450
01:06:57,493 --> 01:06:58,829
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's because she was jealous.

1451
01:06:59,191 --> 01:07:05,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, even in that episode, look at the way she reacted to Finn asking her to go.

1452
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:11,550
Speaker 1: She's got a lot more issues than just her issues with Peeves and her issues with Simon.

1453
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,049
Speaker 2: He has a thousand years of issues.

1454
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:13,983
Speaker 1: Yep.

1455
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:15,709
Speaker 1: Daddy issues.

1456
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:17,490
Speaker 0: French fry issues.

1457
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:19,689
Speaker 2: Who knows how many exes she's had.

1458
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1459
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:24,689
Speaker 1: Granted, we the only one we've seen is the douchebag guy.

1460
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:25,870
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1461
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:27,009
Speaker 0: The guy, the band guy.

1462
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:28,549
Speaker 1: We haven't seen any of the other ones.

1463
01:07:29,172 --> 01:07:29,775
Speaker 1: But we've.

1464
01:07:30,016 --> 01:07:33,150
Speaker 1: we've seen like Peeves was dating that one candy guy at one point.

1465
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:37,090
Speaker 2: Yeah, she probably made him just saying, yeah, almost definitely.

1466
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:40,088
Speaker 1: It's possible that two other candy people made him the natural way.

1467
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:43,550
Speaker 0: That would be really that that is a thing that happens, right?

1468
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:44,749
Speaker 0: Like there's those candy orphans.

1469
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,229
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is the thing that happens.

1470
01:07:46,633 --> 01:07:48,208
Speaker 2: He was there really early on, though.

1471
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:52,850
Speaker 2: I kind of when she was still building stuff, I kind of get the feeling she thought I should have a boyfriend.

1472
01:07:53,413 --> 01:07:54,210
Speaker 2: What should I do about that?

1473
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:59,329
Speaker 1: Or maybe she made a bunch of them and then one of them was just kind of and she just put up with him.

1474
01:08:00,372 --> 01:08:06,030
Speaker 1: I get the impression that anyone she has dated over this whole time, she's just kind of put up with like the kind of there.

1475
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:12,990
Speaker 2: Do you remember in Lemonhope that that guy who helped Lemonhope out of flannel boxing day, I mean, Princess Bubblegum in disguise.

1476
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:13,430
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1477
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:22,268
Speaker 2: You remember when he he she was talking about romance and he was like, it's been so long and he starts dropping the paddle he was using.

1478
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:24,950
Speaker 1: I forgot all about that.

1479
01:08:25,050 --> 01:08:26,528
Speaker 2: I cracked up so hard at that.

1480
01:08:27,215 --> 01:08:28,890
Speaker 1: So is she thinking back to Marceline or?

1481
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:30,709
Speaker 2: That's what I like to think, but who knows?

1482
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:34,950
Speaker 0: All right.

1483
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:37,509
Speaker 0: Let's end with something lighter, right?

1484
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:39,569
Speaker 0: So what?

1485
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:41,386
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1486
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:42,102
Speaker 0: Something lighter.

1487
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:43,270
Speaker 1: Something lighter.

1488
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:44,359
Speaker 1: Okay.

1489
01:08:45,750 --> 01:08:47,850
Speaker 2: Scott, what do you like most about Chews Goose?

1490
01:08:48,554 --> 01:08:49,629
Speaker 0: What do I like most about Chews Goose?

1491
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:50,040
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1492
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:51,189
Speaker 0: His neck.

1493
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,850
Speaker 2: I want to see some Scott X Chews Goose fan fiction.

1494
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:55,988
Speaker 1: Guys, get on this.

1495
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:56,488
Speaker 0: Make it.

1496
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:59,010
Speaker 0: Also, I like his his his equipment.

1497
01:08:59,390 --> 01:08:59,648
Speaker 0: It's very.

1498
01:09:00,711 --> 01:09:01,729
Speaker 1: You just like making that noise.

1499
01:09:02,033 --> 01:09:02,930
Speaker 0: I like making that noise.

1500
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:03,394
Speaker 0: And I like.

1501
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:04,908
Speaker 0: I like inventories.

1502
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:10,488
Speaker 0: Hook me up with that plus two armors and that plus five swords.

1503
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:15,229
Speaker 0: For whatever reason, I really like Chews Goose will never give you the cursed shit.

1504
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:20,010
Speaker 1: I think Flame Princess is actually my favorite non-main character.

1505
01:09:20,774 --> 01:09:21,430
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's your type.

1506
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:22,584
Speaker 1: Yeah, she kind of is.

1507
01:09:23,457 --> 01:09:23,707
Speaker 0: All right.

1508
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:24,307
Speaker 0: Favorite princess.

1509
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:25,569
Speaker 1: Favorite princess.

1510
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:27,970
Speaker 1: But she's not a princess.

1511
01:09:28,171 --> 01:09:28,830
Speaker 1: That's just her surname.

1512
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,069
Speaker 1: That was that was explicitly stated.

1513
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:35,450
Speaker 2: Yes, God, you got to think harder.

1514
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:36,950
Speaker 1: You've got to pick a princess princess.

1515
01:09:38,732 --> 01:09:40,810
Speaker 2: We'll just say Scott's favorite is Princess Princess Princess.

1516
01:09:40,950 --> 01:09:41,206
Speaker 2: Yeah.

1517
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:42,948
Speaker 0: Is there such a princess?

1518
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:43,341
Speaker 1: Yes.

1519
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:46,050
Speaker 1: She's three princesses like mashed together.

1520
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:46,729
Speaker 1: She's horrifying.

1521
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:47,988
Speaker 0: I don't remember that one at all.

1522
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:51,970
Speaker 0: Well, I guess LSP isn't a princess either.

1523
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:52,260
Speaker 0: Nope.

1524
01:09:52,698 --> 01:09:52,830
Speaker 0: Right.

1525
01:09:53,872 --> 01:09:55,430
Speaker 1: Because Princess means something in this world.

1526
01:09:56,597 --> 01:09:58,270
Speaker 1: We know that because of the Enchiridion.

1527
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,788
Speaker 2: So we know that a little bit because of the video game, too.

1528
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:02,749
Speaker 0: Does video game count?

1529
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,130
Speaker 1: I know scenes count, but fuck the rest of that game.

1530
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:06,889
Speaker 2: Fuck that game.

1531
01:10:07,211 --> 01:10:08,930
Speaker 0: All the games are more than one of them.

1532
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:10,489
Speaker 1: Those games are the worst.

1533
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,930
Speaker 2: I gave up on it and just watched the rest of the season on YouTube.

1534
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,389
Speaker 1: I can't believe you even bought it.

1535
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,488
Speaker 2: I was trying to be a good fan.

1536
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:16,770
Speaker 0: No, the first one.

1537
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:17,788
Speaker 0: So don't reward them.

1538
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:23,630
Speaker 1: That would be like if the creators of Cowboy Bebop came to America and just shit on their individual fans one by one.

1539
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:25,650
Speaker 2: Some people have to learn their own lessons, Ram.

1540
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,730
Speaker 2: That's the path to adulthood.

1541
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:31,387
Speaker 1: Except if Finn was allowed to learn his own lessons, he would have died like 15 times.

1542
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,889
Speaker 0: Well, we need your favorite princess also.

1543
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,690
Speaker 1: And it can't be Marceline.

1544
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,570
Speaker 1: She's not a princess either.

1545
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:37,728
Speaker 2: My favorite princess is Peebs.

1546
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:38,288
Speaker 0: Really?

1547
01:10:38,616 --> 01:10:38,704
Speaker 0: Yes.

1548
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,288
Speaker 0: Sorry.

1549
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:40,115
Speaker 1: Okay.

1550
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:42,250
Speaker 1: She's the most interesting character on that show.

1551
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:43,229
Speaker 2: What are you all groaning for?

1552
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,369
Speaker 1: I guess in Tenchi Muyo, you're like Iyeka the most.

1553
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,630
Speaker 2: That is not even a remotely...

1554
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,690
Speaker 0: That's like having Sailor Moon be your favorite Sailor Scout.

1555
01:10:50,596 --> 01:10:51,028
Speaker 2: No, no.

1556
01:10:52,973 --> 01:10:53,970
Speaker 1: Who's your favorite Sailor Scout?

1557
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:54,925
Speaker 1: It's Michiru, isn't it?

1558
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:56,589
Speaker 0: The green one.

1559
01:10:57,130 --> 01:10:57,608
Speaker 0: Just because green.

1560
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:59,148
Speaker 2: No, I like Sailor Uranus.

1561
01:10:59,954 --> 01:11:00,726
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

1562
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,769
Speaker 0: Because butt jokes.

1563
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:02,558
Speaker 2: Yes.

1564
01:11:03,572 --> 01:11:04,889
Speaker 1: Yes, that is exactly why.

1565
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:08,430
Speaker 2: No, Princess Bubblegum is the most complex character on that show.

1566
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,710
Speaker 2: You're not going to convince me of otherwise in this short conversation.

1567
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:14,890
Speaker 2: And just because she appears more than any other princess doesn't mean that my decision is lazy.

1568
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:16,008
Speaker 1: No, I can see that.

1569
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:16,810
Speaker 1: I can see that.

1570
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:19,490
Speaker 1: I like her a lot, but for whatever reason, I like Flame Princess more.

1571
01:11:20,178 --> 01:11:20,869
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatever reason.

1572
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:22,268
Speaker 1: I really don't know why.

1573
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:24,490
Speaker 1: I couldn't really... I'd have to think about it a lot.

1574
01:11:24,711 --> 01:11:26,389
Speaker 2: That's the second most lazy answer, by the way.

1575
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:32,690
Speaker 1: If I had to pick a non-lazy answer, I kind of like Slime Princess as well.

1576
01:11:33,415 --> 01:11:33,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1577
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:36,590
Speaker 1: Because one, she just seems pretty rational and funny.

1578
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:40,870
Speaker 2: And because Maria Bamford's doing her sexy voice for Slime Princess.

1579
01:11:44,032 --> 01:11:49,886
Speaker 1: I also liked at the end of that episode the way they handled the knot attraction between the two of them.

1580
01:11:52,486 --> 01:11:52,710
Speaker 0: All right.

1581
01:11:53,093 --> 01:11:54,009
Speaker 1: No love for Hot Dog Princess.

1582
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:55,830
Speaker 2: I like her design.

1583
01:11:56,290 --> 01:12:00,807
Speaker 0: Hot Dogs, like the theme of Hot Dog Princess is probably the best, but she's just sort of...

1584
01:12:01,070 --> 01:12:04,230
Speaker 1: Wildberry Princess with her stocks of murdered meat.

1585
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:04,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

1586
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,590
Speaker 1: I love how she just is really into meat and slaughtering.

1587
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:10,610
Speaker 0: Maybe the Library Turtle Princess is acceptable.

1588
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:11,749
Speaker 1: Turtle Princess, really?

1589
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:13,068
Speaker 0: Hey, girl.

1590
01:12:13,855 --> 01:12:14,404
Speaker 0: Hey, girl.

1591
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:16,028
Speaker 1: Hey, girl.

1592
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:17,730
Speaker 1: That was my ringtone for a while.

1593
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:18,968
Speaker 0: That's not a bad ringtone.

1594
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,670
Speaker 1: But now I've changed it to Don't Lose Your Way.

1595
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:21,829
Speaker 0: That's a good ringtone, too.

1596
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:22,988
Speaker 1: I might never change it again.

1597
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:25,310
Speaker 1: Because then I'll lose my way.

1598
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,609
Speaker 0: I should change mine to UY Shock.

1599
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:29,770
Speaker 1: It's also my alarm in the morning.

1600
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:30,324
Speaker 0: Great.

1601
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:32,030
Speaker 2: That's a great idea.

1602
01:12:32,453 --> 01:12:32,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1603
01:12:33,171 --> 01:12:33,648
Speaker 1: I have two.

1604
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,470
Speaker 1: I have one that's just Don't Lose Your Way.

1605
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:36,930
Speaker 0: I'm still using the Tribes 2 song.

1606
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:39,008
Speaker 1: It starts right up with the "Don't lose your

1607
01:12:39,069 --> 01:12:39,230
Speaker 1: way.".

1608
01:12:40,173 --> 01:12:40,970
Speaker 1: That's the ringtone.

1609
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:42,554
Speaker 1: The alarm.

1610
01:12:42,635 --> 01:12:45,870
Speaker 1: one plays the song slowly fading in, fading in, fading in, fading in.

1611
01:12:46,893 --> 01:12:47,347
Speaker 0: Don't lose.

1612
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,085
Speaker 1: So I have time to stop it.

1613
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,408
Speaker 2: Wow, I would fly out of bed and right into the dresser.

1614
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:54,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought I would do that.

1615
01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:55,129
Speaker 1: You know what happens?

1616
01:12:55,431 --> 01:12:56,610
Speaker 1: I listen to the song for a while.

1617
01:12:56,690 --> 01:12:57,189
Speaker 1: I turn it off.

1618
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:57,950
Speaker 1: I fall back asleep.

1619
01:12:58,050 --> 01:12:58,990
Speaker 1: I wake up a half hour later.

1620
01:12:59,090 --> 01:12:59,547
Speaker 1: I'm late to work.

1621
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:00,170
Speaker 2: Oh, you suck.

1622
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,489
Speaker 1: I'm just... I can't get out of bed.

1623
01:13:04,616 --> 01:13:05,630
Speaker 1: Is there a sleepy princess?

1624
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:06,770
Speaker 1: I guess that would be the pillow princess.

1625
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:07,770
Speaker 1: But that's alternate universe.

1626
01:13:08,011 --> 01:13:08,590
Speaker 0: That's Prismo.

1627
01:13:11,075 --> 01:13:11,610
Speaker 1: Rest in peace.

1628
01:13:11,991 --> 01:13:12,583
Speaker 1: Oh, Prismo.

1629
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,850
Speaker 1: Is it just me or was the Lich creepy as fuck in that episode?

1630
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:17,509
Speaker 2: He's always creepy as fuck, but yeah.

1631
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:19,350
Speaker 1: He was extra creepy in that episode.

1632
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,750
Speaker 0: I think ever since he donned the skin of Billy, it's been more creepy.

1633
01:13:23,810 --> 01:13:24,870
Speaker 2: He was creeping out Death.

1634
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:26,646
Speaker 1: I love that scene where Death is like,

1635
01:13:26,686 --> 01:13:26,868
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

1636
01:13:28,732 --> 01:13:29,789
Speaker 1: Also, Death might be...

1637
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:31,570
Speaker 0: Couldn't Death just kill him because he's Death?

1638
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:35,210
Speaker 1: Death's powers seem to be surprisingly limited.

1639
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:40,610
Speaker 0: And what's Death... Like, is the dimension that Death lives in the same place where Marceline's dad lives?

1640
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:41,026
Speaker 1: God, no.

1641
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:41,255
Speaker 2: No.

1642
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:42,330
Speaker 0: No, okay.

1643
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:43,989
Speaker 1: That's pretty well established, I think.

1644
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:50,690
Speaker 1: Marceline's dimension... Well, Marceline's dad's dimension is the nightosphere is pretty much sequestered off from everywhere.

1645
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:52,350
Speaker 0: So the nightosphere is not the same as Hell?

1646
01:13:52,634 --> 01:13:52,746
Speaker 2: No.

1647
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:53,350
Speaker 0: Okay.

1648
01:13:53,631 --> 01:13:56,470
Speaker 2: It's kind of like Hell, but I don't know if that's where dead people go.

1649
01:13:56,731 --> 01:13:57,329
Speaker 0: It's its own thing.

1650
01:13:57,631 --> 01:13:58,509
Speaker 0: We haven't seen any Heavens.

1651
01:13:58,630 --> 01:13:59,404
Speaker 0: We've just seen two Hells.

1652
01:14:00,272 --> 01:14:01,149
Speaker 1: Bad places to go.

1653
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:06,650
Speaker 1: I guess your options are get sent to a Hell or get reincarnated as basically the same person.

1654
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:14,750
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1655
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,890
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1658
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:32,990
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
