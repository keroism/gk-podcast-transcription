1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,725
Speaker 1: It's Monday, June 3rd, 2013.

2
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:12,129
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,533
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,633 --> 00:00:14,737
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:15,900
Speaker 1: Tonight, testing.

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,893
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,063
Speaker 1: Was that better?

8
00:00:30,223 --> 00:00:31,206
Speaker 0: Was that a better opening?

9
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:34,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't say a bunch of extra words for no reason.

10
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:40,180
Speaker 1: Tonight on Geek Nights, test-driven development, development testing, unit test, quality assurance.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,694
Speaker 0: We're already past that part, so you can say whatever as many words as you want.

12
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:45,155
Speaker 0: Now it's.

13
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:50,870
Speaker 0: the opening bit has no word limit, so it's all good.

14
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,193
Speaker 1: No word limit, eh?

15
00:00:52,213 --> 00:00:55,584
Speaker 0: So a time limit, not a word limit.

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,610
Speaker 0: So get micro machines guy in here.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,092
Speaker 0: He'll show you.

18
00:00:58,394 --> 00:00:58,896
Speaker 1: I'll say this.

19
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:00,685
Speaker 1: I wonder if we could get him on Geek Nights.

20
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:01,530
Speaker 0: Is he dead?

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,998
Speaker 1: He's probably, I can't imagine he's still alive.

22
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,603
Speaker 0: I'll look it up.

23
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:06,065
Speaker 0: You talk.

24
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:14,554
Speaker 1: So I enjoyed because I do not enjoy the Game of Thrones books, but I do enjoy the story of Game of Thrones to a degree.

25
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:21,302
Speaker 1: Kind of like how I think the Harry Potter books are written for imbeciles, but I really like the story of Harry Potter.

26
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,287
Speaker 1: I just can't read those books.

27
00:01:22,307 --> 00:01:22,649
Speaker 1: I don't know.

28
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:28,894
Speaker 0: I can't read them either, but I kind of like a few of the, you know, like that bother, bother, bother thing.

29
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:29,316
Speaker 1: Exactly.

30
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:29,959
Speaker 0: That was okay.

31
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,547
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, but that's the fan stuff.

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:32,050
Speaker 0: Yeah.

33
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:33,818
Speaker 1: The fan stuff is here.

34
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,933
Speaker 0: I mean, that could have been any, it didn't have to be Harry Potter, right?

35
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:38,125
Speaker 0: Anything with bother, bother, bother would have been funny.

36
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:38,669
Speaker 1: Basically.

37
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:39,733
Speaker 1: That's just fan fiction.

38
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:40,496
Speaker 1: What you like there.

39
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:44,531
Speaker 0: Well, it's really just that one, but then it's really not.

40
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:48,310
Speaker 0: even the whole thing is just, you know what you could have been any character.

41
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,992
Speaker 0: It could be like any puppet going bother, just saying that, but it's like badger, badger, mushroom, mushroom.

42
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:56,082
Speaker 1: It was still fan fiction, I suppose.

43
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:59,234
Speaker 1: Anyway, but no, I just, I like the story.

44
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:00,259
Speaker 1: I just don't like her writing.

45
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:00,983
Speaker 1: It's the Game of Thrones.

46
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:01,486
Speaker 1: Same thing.

47
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:11,506
Speaker 1: And if maybe if I'd never read the Prince of Nothing and any other sort of serious gritty fantasy, I might have more tolerance for the Game of Thrones, but I have no tolerance for it.

48
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:15,740
Speaker 0: Game of Thrones that's popular and not in the name of the wind.

49
00:02:16,462 --> 00:02:17,385
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

50
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,015
Speaker 0: Imagine if that was the TV series.

51
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,522
Speaker 1: You didn't, you didn't read that second book.

52
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:22,286
Speaker 0: I own it though.

53
00:02:22,306 --> 00:02:23,792
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a mistake.

54
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:31,099
Speaker 1: You want to read about a lot of sex with Kung Fu Ninja masters who have very liberal attitudes on sex.

55
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,603
Speaker 0: No, cause as soon as I finished the book I'm reading now, I'm going to go back to reading the comics that are piling up everywhere.

56
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:41,707
Speaker 1: But uh, I got, you know, I saw the title of the upcoming episode of Game of Thrones.

57
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,414
Speaker 1: I've only watched season one of the show.

58
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:46,947
Speaker 0: I watched episode zero, not any episodes.

59
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:47,590
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

60
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,164
Speaker 1: It's one of those things where the board game I enjoy.

61
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:51,149
Speaker 1: I played the board game too.

62
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:52,314
Speaker 1: It's no K game.

63
00:02:52,414 --> 00:03:00,065
Speaker 0: I've heard some and I've heard comments about gay and I basically have just gleaned a small amount of knowledge about it from sources.

64
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:04,264
Speaker 1: You came to, when we got here and we started the show, you were like, so what the fuck happened?

65
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:05,228
Speaker 0: Right.

66
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:06,856
Speaker 0: Cause basically the internet exploded today.

67
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:07,358
Speaker 0: Right.

68
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,513
Speaker 0: And everyone's talking about, Oh my God, Game of Thrones last night.

69
00:03:10,553 --> 00:03:18,517
Speaker 0: Crazy shit went down and they're freaking out and they're talking about this red wedding and I couldn't really find anyone actually describing what happened because everyone's so fucking spoiler averse.

70
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,280
Speaker 0: Right.

71
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,048
Speaker 0: And I'm like, okay, red weddings.

72
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,033
Speaker 0: It must've been a wedding.

73
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,263
Speaker 0: I'm based on what I know about the show.

74
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:32,324
Speaker 0: There must've been a wedding and a lot of, you know, someone was killed at it or maybe a bunch of people were killed at it or the bride was killed or there's killing going on at this wedding.

75
00:03:32,786 --> 00:03:36,805
Speaker 0: Perhaps I'm guessing cause I know in the show it's a medieval world with houses.

76
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:37,850
Speaker 0: I know that from the board game.

77
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:41,670
Speaker 0: Perhaps this was a wedding between two houses and perhaps the third house did not like it.

78
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,273
Speaker 0: I'm guessing.

79
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:46,916
Speaker 0: And then I also know there's the other thing I know about the show is that there are dragons and a midgets.

80
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,709
Speaker 0: So perhaps the dragons ate the midget at the wedding.

81
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:57,337
Speaker 1: So if you ever do watch the show and I wouldn't recommend reading the novels, the midget is probably your favorite character.

82
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,557
Speaker 0: I wish the show, I know what I know of the midget is from your game of thrones.

83
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:02,999
Speaker 1: Yes.

84
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:06,030
Speaker 1: The thing is the actual speech he gives in that video.

85
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,044
Speaker 0: You showed me that also is basically the same as the coonies.

86
00:04:09,104 --> 00:04:09,285
Speaker 0: Right.

87
00:04:09,305 --> 00:04:10,270
Speaker 0: You showed me that also.

88
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:18,601
Speaker 1: So I knew what the red wedding was because I much like with Harry Potter, I read all the spoilers for the books because I don't want to read the books.

89
00:04:18,642 --> 00:04:19,365
Speaker 0: So you found them.

90
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:20,952
Speaker 0: So tell me what the red one.

91
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,629
Speaker 1: I read the spoilers for the books when the book came out and that shit happened.

92
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,238
Speaker 0: Oh, tell me what their fucking red wedding is.

93
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:37,008
Speaker 1: So I won't spoil it for our listeners, but basically you're right in a sense, but basically the show, once you know, like there's a thing called a red wedding and this houses, I mean, the show is known and the books are known for two things.

94
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:41,602
Speaker 1: One, they will kill main characters out of nowhere.

95
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:42,746
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

96
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,035
Speaker 0: But they have replacement characters already standing there.

97
00:04:45,055 --> 00:04:50,704
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the books have more replacement characters than they will ever need because the books, I mean, too many characters.

98
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:57,917
Speaker 0: One thing, if you have like a main character and they meet someone and then you kill the main character and the someone they met is now the character, I'll put it this way.

99
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:02,700
Speaker 0: If you do a situation where it's like main character dies, let's go look at the other side of the world.

100
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,309
Speaker 0: Here's new people you've never met before.

101
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:07,302
Speaker 0: It's like, fuck that you might as well just ended and started a new book.

102
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:10,898
Speaker 1: You will not like the game of Thrones books then they do it that way.

103
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:18,107
Speaker 1: The game of Thrones books have all these threads that are way far apart from each other that barely interact and are leading towards some end.

104
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:23,323
Speaker 1: But because he's not our Scott backer, I have no faith that that end is anything interesting.

105
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:24,426
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

106
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,133
Speaker 1: But I'll put it this way.

107
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:28,609
Speaker 1: I'll put it in Prince of Nothing terms because it's worth noting, right?

108
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:34,313
Speaker 0: If there was a Prince of Nothing TV show and there was like a circum fiction episode, you wouldn't see people freaking out like this.

109
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,985
Speaker 0: How crazy could it be that people speak out so much?

110
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,251
Speaker 1: This is what I'm getting at.

111
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:43,990
Speaker 1: No one who has read the Prince of Nothing would even blink at what happened in this episode.

112
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,840
Speaker 1: They would be like, wow, that was relatively tame.

113
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:53,624
Speaker 1: And the thousands of people who died was actually a relatively small amount of tragedy, all things considered.

114
00:05:53,844 --> 00:05:55,149
Speaker 0: Oh wait, thousands died.

115
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,964
Speaker 0: So was it like as a gift to the people getting married?

116
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:01,675
Speaker 0: He's like, here, I have slaughtered entire city for you.

117
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:02,016
Speaker 1: Yeah.

118
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:17,113
Speaker 1: Well, so what it would be like, uh, so the first season of game of Thrones, like a TV show basically ends with the equivalent of if in the middle of like the second book, like toward the end of it, maybe of the Prince of Nothing, uh, Nair, Confus and Kellis killed each other.

119
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:17,815
Speaker 0: Nice.

120
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,499
Speaker 1: Like out of nowhere.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,638
Speaker 1: And then like Confus, they ended up actually having a son and that kid was now King, like some bullshit like that.

122
00:06:25,658 --> 00:06:26,541
Speaker 0: Okay.

123
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:41,238
Speaker 1: This one is basically would be like if the entire Holy Wars leaders were invited to a party with all of their personal guards and then all of them were murdered, including the guards, everyone, every single one of them, all the rulers, everyone.

124
00:06:41,258 --> 00:06:43,347
Speaker 1: No, just by other assholes with swords.

125
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,953
Speaker 1: There aren't really wizards yet.

126
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:49,714
Speaker 0: There are dragons, but how are you going to kill that many bad-ass dudes with just guys with swords?

127
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,470
Speaker 1: Well, that's kind of what the whole plot is, but basically forget all that.

128
00:06:52,570 --> 00:07:01,165
Speaker 1: The details are irrelevant because if you go read the stupid game of Thrones Wiki, you're going to learn a lot about what was served at the dinner prior to what happened to fuck people.

129
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,375
Speaker 0: But, uh, at least was at least good food.

130
00:07:03,395 --> 00:07:18,171
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, it was good food and you would appreciate the plot that was done, but basically the reason people are freaking out is because this for the fifth or sixth time, the show killed a main character that no one expected to die because they're not reading the books.

131
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:28,061
Speaker 1: And more importantly, so many important characters were killed and it was so sudden and out of nowhere and related to a thread they'd all probably forgotten about it.

132
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:33,060
Speaker 1: It'd be like, if in the Simpsons suddenly Homer and Mars just got killed.

133
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,945
Speaker 1: Okay.

134
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:34,447
Speaker 1: All right.

135
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,839
Speaker 1: And now the show's about Bart and Lisa moving into a foster home forever.

136
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,003
Speaker 1: Great.

137
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:45,486
Speaker 1: I think just the only people who freaked out are the people who've never read good or surprising fiction before.

138
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,349
Speaker 1: Yeah.

139
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:50,265
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're watching TV, that shit doesn't happen on TV or movies really.

140
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:54,223
Speaker 0: You know, then again, sometimes at the very end, but very rarely in the middle.

141
00:07:54,344 --> 00:07:56,535
Speaker 1: So Scott said, yeah, I mean, look at Escaflowne, right?

142
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,404
Speaker 1: There are moments in the anime Escaflowne.

143
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:01,099
Speaker 0: If you watch the anime, that shit's not going to freak you out at all.

144
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:06,344
Speaker 0: You're like, oh yeah, anime and people dying freaking Fullmetal Alchemist, like generic anime has shit like that.

145
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:11,746
Speaker 1: But that stuff almost always happens at the end or at like a season finale and shows like that.

146
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,288
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

147
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:16,682
Speaker 1: So I think American TV watching audiences, you're like whatever.

148
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:17,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:23,227
Speaker 1: They're one unaccustomed to the death of prominent characters, especially characters played by big name actors.

150
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:26,578
Speaker 1: They're very unaccustomed to major plot.

151
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:28,644
Speaker 0: They know the person's contract ran out.

152
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:29,728
Speaker 1: Yeah.

153
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:31,293
Speaker 1: The nerds know that these are all.

154
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,284
Speaker 1: the normal water cooler types are flipping out about this.

155
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:46,365
Speaker 1: I posit everyone who flipped out about this, like was visibly shocked and going crazy on the internet has never read the Prince of nothing has never read books, has never watched real shows.

156
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:47,188
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:59,190
Speaker 1: Then again, I mean way back when I was watching Ava for the first time, had Twitter been available and had we all watched it at the same time, I think there would have been a lot of tweeting about it, but

158
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:06,102
Speaker 0: what episode of Ava would you be like, huh?

159
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:12,518
Speaker 1: Maybe the episode is, you know, every episode of Ava is when you find out about colonial bullshit.

160
00:09:13,522 --> 00:09:16,595
Speaker 1: Like when you find that out for reals, I sort of knew that was coming.

161
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:20,149
Speaker 0: That's so heavily foreshadowed and implied all over the place.

162
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:22,714
Speaker 0: She's all injured.

163
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,080
Speaker 0: And then suddenly she's not injured.

164
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

165
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:24,883
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:25,365
Speaker 0: Yeah.

167
00:09:25,727 --> 00:09:27,373
Speaker 0: It's like, okay.

168
00:09:27,714 --> 00:09:27,934
Speaker 0: Yeah.

169
00:09:27,954 --> 00:09:28,576
Speaker 1: Game of Thrones.

170
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:29,900
Speaker 0: Not all the time.

171
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,789
Speaker 1: Not the greatest with the foreshadowing.

172
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,585
Speaker 1: it's there, but usually it's just exposition while a button is bouncing around on screen.

173
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:37,128
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

174
00:09:37,148 --> 00:09:38,791
Speaker 0: So anyway, news.

175
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,336
Speaker 0: So it's just a quick news.

176
00:09:40,516 --> 00:09:45,470
Speaker 0: Zynga lays off 520 employees, closes, closes several offices.

177
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,819
Speaker 0: Now everyone's like, Oh my God, people are out of work.

178
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,502
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

179
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,570
Speaker 0: You are not doing good work.

180
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,734
Speaker 0: You may be a good person.

181
00:09:51,754 --> 00:10:02,650
Speaker 0: I'm maybe slightly sorry for you if you were the employee, but you agreed Zynga took their money and participated in doing what I consider to be immoral labor.

182
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,886
Speaker 0: Like as you were making things that are in and of themselves immoral.

183
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:11,850
Speaker 0: Now at the same time, I have really not too much sympathy and yeah, I hope you go out of business completely.

184
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:14,502
Speaker 1: You know, free speech is fine to make terrible games like that.

185
00:10:14,523 --> 00:10:15,909
Speaker 1: It's fine to do what they do.

186
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:16,811
Speaker 0: Yeah.

187
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:19,763
Speaker 0: I think it's, I just personally, I'll put it this way.

188
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:22,434
Speaker 1: I put the people who lost their jobs in this situation.

189
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:28,556
Speaker 1: I feel for them about the same that I feel for someone struggling to get by who took a job making telemarketing calls.

190
00:10:29,017 --> 00:10:29,258
Speaker 0: Yeah.

191
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,682
Speaker 1: About the same level.

192
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,649
Speaker 1: Oh, Zynga.

193
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,495
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess there's stock collapse.

194
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:45,513
Speaker 0: So it's interesting to me how, you know, I'm so that, you know, the free to play thing is obviously not working in a sense, but in another sense, it's, it's, it's weird.

195
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:52,800
Speaker 0: They just announced like Plants for Zombies 2 is going to be super free to play with pay money to get, I guess, more plants and shit.

196
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,261
Speaker 0: I don't know.

197
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:56,573
Speaker 1: Well, free to play does and work.

198
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,360
Speaker 1: I think there's two things going on.

199
00:10:59,043 --> 00:11:02,175
Speaker 1: All the things I would say about that are more video game news.

200
00:11:02,456 --> 00:11:02,757
Speaker 0: I know.

201
00:11:02,918 --> 00:11:11,132
Speaker 0: So to summarize them, but you know, the tech industry considers Zynga to be a tech company because they make their, you know, I mean, they don't really make games.

202
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:11,755
Speaker 0: That's what I was gonna say.

203
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,102
Speaker 1: They make games in the same way.

204
00:11:13,143 --> 00:11:15,031
Speaker 1: that patty cake is a game, right?

205
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:20,452
Speaker 0: Plants for Zombies 1 was a game and it's questionable whether Plants for Zombies 2 will be.

206
00:11:20,593 --> 00:11:33,476
Speaker 1: one thing that I think happened here is that normal people who are not super hardcore gamers who just pay attention to this stuff have noticed that the games their kids are playing on the cell phones are asking for money.

207
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:34,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

208
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:44,233
Speaker 1: I've talked to numerous parents in the last month who've said something like, man, I was playing X game and then it wanted me to give it a dollar to buy a thing in the game.

209
00:11:44,293 --> 00:11:45,177
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

210
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,849
Speaker 1: Like they finally noticed that that's what's going on.

211
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,576
Speaker 0: I think it took you so long.

212
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:51,345
Speaker 0: It's only made, I don't know, five years.

213
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:55,382
Speaker 1: Because I think it's because it's, this is what I was getting at with part two.

214
00:11:55,824 --> 00:12:02,630
Speaker 1: It's similar to what happened during the video game crash in the eighties when the Atari and all those shitware games were out.

215
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:10,395
Speaker 1: There's so much shitware out now in terms of gaming, just like before the shitware is the shittest tier of shit.

216
00:12:11,077 --> 00:12:17,156
Speaker 1: And it'd be like if you're playing ET on the 2,600 when you fall in the pit, you got to give it your credit card to get out of the pit.

217
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,206
Speaker 1: So it's two factors.

218
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:23,377
Speaker 1: It's shitware and you have to pay money for that shitware.

219
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:29,721
Speaker 0: I think that's what YouTube video or ET falls in the pit and he tries to use his neck to get up.

220
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:35,672
Speaker 0: And then he, when he reaches the top, he sort of runs out of energy and he falls down and it says, pay, pay a dollar to get more neck energy.

221
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:38,648
Speaker 1: You make that I won't, but I could, I think that's what's going on.

222
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:40,997
Speaker 1: I think they're saturating the market with free to play.

223
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:45,574
Speaker 1: Free to play has already been a bad word among a lot of people in our circles.

224
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:52,860
Speaker 1: It's becoming a bad word in all their circles too, because if you go to some app store, which free to play game do you buy?

225
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,145
Speaker 1: It's Russian roulette.

226
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:57,982
Speaker 1: 90% of them are going to ask for five bucks to get past the first screen.

227
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:01,899
Speaker 0: I think they really need to start labeling their games as this one is pay to win.

228
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,963
Speaker 0: This one is not right.

229
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,750
Speaker 0: Cause Dota 2 is not pay to win.

230
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,518
Speaker 0: You can only buy really cosmetic shit.

231
00:13:06,538 --> 00:13:07,020
Speaker 0: That's cool.

232
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,909
Speaker 0: Even though I might not like Dota itself.

233
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:13,428
Speaker 1: The games, the shitware games that people are noticing that the most are the games that you don't.

234
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,558
Speaker 1: technically they're single player for one.

235
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:19,134
Speaker 1: They may be social, but they're really just, they're like the Simpsons game.

236
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:19,777
Speaker 1: You just sit there.

237
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:20,701
Speaker 1: Shit happens.

238
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:25,840
Speaker 1: But like the Simpsons game, you could just wait and they charge you money to not wait.

239
00:13:26,462 --> 00:13:36,754
Speaker 1: I think poor kids whose parents won't let them unlimitedly charge the cell phone anymore are just waiting or not playing as opposed to paying for speed up.

240
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,923
Speaker 0: But there are also games, right?

241
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,312
Speaker 0: Where just the numbers are depending on the game you're playing.

242
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,959
Speaker 0: Like sometimes just waiting doesn't really matter, right?

243
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:55,679
Speaker 0: Like keep playing it like crazy and it'll work and you don't really have to wait that long to get powerups to get a high score, right?

244
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,362
Speaker 0: To show you.

245
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:15,416
Speaker 0: And there's really no sort of end game you're going towards like in a Simpsons or a Farmville, but there are other games where it's like, yeah, you can just wait, but assuming you have the highest efficiency possible and you sit here, do sitting, poking this thing 24 seven, if you want all these things, you will have to wait like 13 years.

246
00:14:15,436 --> 00:14:18,064
Speaker 0: by then we'll have new things that you don't have.

247
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:23,257
Speaker 1: So I think the moral is you and me need to take candy box and monetize it.

248
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,460
Speaker 0: Sure.

249
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,412
Speaker 1: Pay a dollar to increase your lollipop rate for X.

250
00:14:30,294 --> 00:14:30,475
Speaker 0: Yeah.

251
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,221
Speaker 0: For anyone who doesn't know JavaScript.

252
00:14:33,384 --> 00:14:39,804
Speaker 1: The thing is we didn't really review the, you don't need to know JavaScript to win candy box because there's one other option.

253
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:43,757
Speaker 1: Just wait a day to eat the motherfucking marshmallow.

254
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,450
Speaker 1: If you just wait a day, you'll have enough to do everything.

255
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,037
Speaker 1: You don't have to do it.

256
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:50,383
Speaker 1: You don't even have to cheat.

257
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,497
Speaker 1: You just have to have the discipline to not click on it right the fuck now.

258
00:14:53,838 --> 00:14:56,048
Speaker 1: Progress quest, at least world progress.

259
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:59,645
Speaker 1: Quest problem is that you, there's no button to claim to put money in.

260
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:02,881
Speaker 0: We should just take progress quest, fork it and have a dollar to get a level.

261
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,047
Speaker 1: Totally dollar quest.

262
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:04,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

263
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,557
Speaker 0: She doesn't make a website dollar.

264
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:15,532
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a website dollar quest because that guy made cow clicker and that sort of started out as that joke and it ended up actually becoming popular.

265
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:18,061
Speaker 1: If you accept Bitcoins, then we're on right.

266
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:22,137
Speaker 0: Let's make, you know, just dollar quest and see what happens.

267
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:22,438
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,989
Speaker 1: I got to have leaderboards, get some art in there.

269
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,093
Speaker 1: So, uh, don't be creepy is the headline that pretty much everyone used for this Google glass.

270
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:43,704
Speaker 1: The, the guidelines for writing apps real bad have been updated in a way that bothers me, but not for all the reasons you might think to quotes.

271
00:15:44,366 --> 00:15:55,647
Speaker 1: You will not use the camera or microphone to cross reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user, including use cases such as facial recognition and voice prints.

272
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,515
Speaker 1: Applications that do this will not be approved at this time.

273
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:19,323
Speaker 1: Now we know exactly why Google made that change because people are freaked because now, no, because Congress is currently investigating them and asked them a number of ridiculous questions about the capabilities of this technology and Congress is full of fuddy duddy.

274
00:16:19,343 --> 00:16:27,290
Speaker 1: So Google needed to be able to say, no, it cannot do that to Congress and it will not be a lie if it can later do that.

275
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:32,963
Speaker 1: So I understand why Google did this wall.

276
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:35,730
Speaker 1: The actual thing that they did is bullshit.

277
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:36,250
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,876
Speaker 1: There is a, it's the same reason.

279
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:44,721
Speaker 1: the obviously atheist political candidate will go to church for the few months before the election.

280
00:16:45,284 --> 00:16:47,473
Speaker 1: I can look at that guy and be like, I know what you're doing.

281
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,122
Speaker 0: It's sort of, it's sort of weird, right?

282
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:53,463
Speaker 0: I feel like sometimes like I'm the only geek, you know, it was like, you look at like the EFF, right?

283
00:16:53,483 --> 00:16:56,276
Speaker 0: And that's like the geek political action organization.

284
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:56,537
Speaker 0: Right.

285
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,444
Speaker 0: And a lot of the things they stand for, it's like, yeah, it's like new bill in Congress, unlocking technology.

286
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:01,645
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:17:01,665 --> 00:17:02,148
Speaker 0: I like that.

288
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:02,430
Speaker 0: Right.

289
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,464
Speaker 0: President foreshadows new intervent surveillance proposal, you know?

290
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:06,786
Speaker 0: Okay.

291
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,352
Speaker 0: Governments, you know, fifth amendment.

292
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:08,714
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,095
Speaker 0: Okay.

294
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:10,761
Speaker 0: You know, no DRM.

295
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

296
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:11,825
Speaker 0: I like that too.

297
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:14,255
Speaker 0: But they always do like this privacy stuff.

298
00:17:14,435 --> 00:17:18,011
Speaker 0: Then like they would be against, you know, glass, like looking up people.

299
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,839
Speaker 0: And I'd be like, no, fuck that.

300
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,542
Speaker 1: Now here's the thing.

301
00:17:20,784 --> 00:17:24,801
Speaker 1: Let's go back, back up all the way to the ideological point from my perspective.

302
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:25,626
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

303
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:27,532
Speaker 1: I do what I want with my technology.

304
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:35,979
Speaker 1: If you're about privacy of databases or accessing information that other people have made available in certain ways, that's fine.

305
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:46,176
Speaker 1: But if I have a device and I have my facial recognition software, that just means that if they ban it from normal people, only nerds will have those.

306
00:17:46,196 --> 00:17:48,045
Speaker 0: That's the Linux situation, right?

307
00:17:48,065 --> 00:17:53,023
Speaker 0: That's a free software is all about is you can't tell me what bits to run on my technologies.

308
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:53,986
Speaker 0: Right.

309
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:58,324
Speaker 0: I actually made a tweet that I thought was funny when people were discussing this.

310
00:17:58,364 --> 00:17:58,626
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:02,663
Speaker 0: And it was sort of like, you know, I think it was people were concerned, right?

312
00:18:02,683 --> 00:18:09,172
Speaker 0: That if they wore glass in public, that people would be like freaked out by them or react to them in a positive or indoor negative way.

313
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:09,573
Speaker 0: Right.

314
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:13,809
Speaker 0: And I'm sort of like, well, imagine Spiderman swinging down the street.

315
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:14,070
Speaker 0: Right.

316
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,657
Speaker 0: And you read a Spiderman comic, right?

317
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:17,546
Speaker 0: Like a basic generic Spiderman comic.

318
00:18:17,606 --> 00:18:18,611
Speaker 0: He swings down the street.

319
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:22,264
Speaker 0: Some people are like, yeah, go Spiderman saving the day.

320
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:22,967
Speaker 0: All right.

321
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:29,996
Speaker 0: And some people are like reading the Daily Bugle that J. Jonah Samuelson edited that says evil Spiderman terrorizes town.

322
00:18:30,036 --> 00:18:32,849
Speaker 0: And they're like, fuck you, Spiderman terrorizing our town.

323
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:34,296
Speaker 0: That's what wearing Google Glass is like.

324
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,281
Speaker 0: It's like you're Spiderman.

325
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,772
Speaker 0: And some people are like, Glass, you're awesome.

326
00:18:38,053 --> 00:18:43,590
Speaker 0: And some people are like, get away from me, you privacy face database look up person.

327
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,741
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty easy to use it as a sort of friend sorter that people who cannot deal with wearing Google Glass, I really just won't see often.

328
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:51,183
Speaker 0: Right.

329
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:56,829
Speaker 0: But it's like, that's like, that makes me want to wear the Google Glass because it's like a instant idiot filter.

330
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,817
Speaker 0: It's like I'm becoming a superhero.

331
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:03,676
Speaker 0: And if you are afraid of superheroes and don't want to become one yourself, fuck you.

332
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,924
Speaker 0: stay in your old 20th century.

333
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:10,480
Speaker 0: Now what's really interesting in my world is that this sort of time machine and go back.

334
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:15,877
Speaker 1: It's a lot of the older nerds that goes in the show are very.

335
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:25,910
Speaker 1: They say they're like very techno, whatever, and like we're on the bleeding edge of technology, but then they always will back away from that cliff as they get older.

336
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,801
Speaker 1: They'll always be like, ah, maybe it did go too far.

337
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,346
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't foresee this.

338
00:19:30,668 --> 00:19:31,772
Speaker 1: How do you get that way?

339
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:38,417
Speaker 1: How do you go from being on the bleeding edge when you're 17 to being afraid of everything that came out after you turn 30?

340
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,581
Speaker 0: There must be.

341
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,077
Speaker 0: There might be a biological thing towards conservatism when you get old.

342
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:45,732
Speaker 1: I think there is, but I don't think it's that you become conservative.

343
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:48,222
Speaker 1: I think that you, you stop at a point.

344
00:19:48,262 --> 00:19:48,382
Speaker 1: Yeah.

345
00:19:48,724 --> 00:19:54,063
Speaker 0: I can definitely say it's not from reading sci-fis that warn about and play gods.

346
00:19:54,123 --> 00:19:55,669
Speaker 0: Cause I've read fucking all of those.

347
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:56,030
Speaker 0: I know.

348
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,471
Speaker 0: Right.

349
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:57,917
Speaker 0: And I am like, yup.

350
00:19:57,998 --> 00:20:00,850
Speaker 0: I read like a hundred sci-fi books that said you and play gods.

351
00:20:01,571 --> 00:20:03,738
Speaker 0: I am play gods.

352
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,042
Speaker 0: Let's go see what happens.

353
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:09,496
Speaker 1: Simultaneously want immortal robot body and have seen a bunch of galaxy express.

354
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:10,098
Speaker 1: three, nine.

355
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:16,177
Speaker 0: I also would like robot body, but less so, but I'm not completely against robot body.

356
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,265
Speaker 0: And I've seen all of galaxies.

357
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:24,663
Speaker 0: I've seen almost every show that, uh, what's his name?

358
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:26,490
Speaker 0: I can't remember his name right now.

359
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:31,742
Speaker 0: Seen almost every show he's done ever.

360
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:35,239
Speaker 1: I was wondering, cause the fact you didn't bring the name to the tip of your tongue.

361
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,155
Speaker 1: I wondered if you were going to refer to someone else.

362
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,166
Speaker 0: It's just hard to, you know, sometimes, you know, it slips the brain.

363
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,833
Speaker 0: That's why I need Google glass.

364
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,020
Speaker 0: It would have shown up a media.

365
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:49,343
Speaker 0: But like, I would have been like Google glass, you know, director of galaxy express three, nine technology.

366
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:49,624
Speaker 1: It's like.

367
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:53,180
Speaker 1: most people are still mostly afraid of the surveillance capabilities of glass.

368
00:20:53,401 --> 00:21:02,515
Speaker 1: Like the other thing you can't do is turn the display off when it's recording one, I want it to record 24 seven battery is the only thing that will stop that from happening.

369
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:10,949
Speaker 0: I already record my commute 20, you know, every single one GoPro, the only thing that stops me is storage space that my NAS isn't even half full yet though.

370
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:28,008
Speaker 1: And the, but the people who are afraid of that, the, but it's like, they're afraid of the most simple direct, like immediate term use case and have no vision of anything even a millimeter beyond that in terms of advancements, the dash cam thing we already have for like 200 bucks.

371
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,675
Speaker 1: You can buy a camera that you can hide in your hand.

372
00:21:30,695 --> 00:21:31,758
Speaker 0: People just use GoPros.

373
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:37,998
Speaker 1: No, surveil everyone around you all the time.

374
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:43,939
Speaker 1: If you want glass actually is the worst possible way to do that because everyone knows you're wearing glass.

375
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:44,681
Speaker 0: Yeah.

376
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:52,023
Speaker 1: But if I have a device and I'm collecting data, I can do what I want with that data for me.

377
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,655
Speaker 1: And there's pretty much nothing that will stop me.

378
00:21:55,675 --> 00:22:01,374
Speaker 0: Uh, somebody, if you go into a secured place or they search your body before you go in.

379
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:07,079
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, as when I get glass, what I'll probably do is just not eat at restaurants that don't allow it in.

380
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,118
Speaker 1: And the only times I'll take it off or when I go to like a courthouse shower.

381
00:22:11,138 --> 00:22:13,127
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I won't wear it in the shower.

382
00:22:13,147 --> 00:22:15,115
Speaker 1: Cause it's probably not super waterproof.

383
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:15,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

384
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,484
Speaker 0: If it runs out, I had to recharge it.

385
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:17,926
Speaker 0: Yeah.

386
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:24,670
Speaker 1: The battery doesn't last that long yet either, but yeah, but yeah, it just, it's, it's funny how many people are happy.

387
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:25,573
Speaker 1: That doesn't matter.

388
00:22:25,593 --> 00:22:28,205
Speaker 0: soon enough glass will just be a replacement eyeball.

389
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:30,173
Speaker 0: And when I get cataracts, I'll just get those.

390
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:30,696
Speaker 0: Yeah.

391
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:42,690
Speaker 1: But there's so many things we can talk about here, but it really just comes down to the fact that I'm amazed at how many people are so afraid of this, but the things that they're afraid of are the least revolutionary things it can do.

392
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,349
Speaker 0: Because anyone who has revolutionary thinking would be someone who is in favor of it.

393
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:54,373
Speaker 0: Anyone who's against it is going to be a backwards technological person who is not forward thinking and futuristic.

394
00:22:55,536 --> 00:23:04,672
Speaker 1: I mean, the basic use case of glass, the first thing anyone smart thought of was, wow, I could recognize people in places automatically and have that data available all the time.

395
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:17,544
Speaker 0: See, I think we need some sort of intermediary system before we get to the, you know, to that, what we need is sort of like a, your phone, basically broadcast your identity and then other people's phones, sort of like the DS street pass.

396
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:29,070
Speaker 0: So like I can maybe hold up my phone and look at the screen and the camera is looking at everybody in the subway car and like over each person that'll have information that can like tap on the people to get their thing.

397
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:31,380
Speaker 0: They're broadcasting it from their phone, right?

398
00:23:31,782 --> 00:23:35,015
Speaker 1: You know, that's shades of the end of the first season of Dora, right?

399
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:37,444
Speaker 0: We need something like that to start out with.

400
00:23:37,846 --> 00:23:40,299
Speaker 0: Uh, and you could, you know, I would, that'd be totally awesome, right?

401
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,982
Speaker 0: Like imagine if I'm standing on the subway, just listening to music, waiting to get to my stop, right?

402
00:23:44,284 --> 00:23:52,477
Speaker 0: Someone holds her phone up and looks at me and it's like Scott Rubin, geek nights, podcast nerd, nerd, nerd, geek, geek, geek, listening to this music right now.

403
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:55,348
Speaker 0: So maybe this is the music that's on his iPhone.

404
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:56,633
Speaker 0: Do you want to listen to any of it?

405
00:23:56,673 --> 00:23:57,135
Speaker 0: Tap here.

406
00:23:57,356 --> 00:23:58,019
Speaker 0: Here's the movies.

407
00:23:58,582 --> 00:23:59,425
Speaker 0: Here are YouTube videos.

408
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,430
Speaker 0: Tap them to play them.

409
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,413
Speaker 1: Is that the app?

410
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:07,536
Speaker 1: If the privacy stuff is going to prevent the sort of built in first rounds of features, do we, or not?

411
00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:11,350
Speaker 1: we, the Royal we did the smart nerds just make it an opt in system.

412
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:23,821
Speaker 1: So everyone who's in has this automatic connection to everyone else who's in and maybe you even set like, you know, people who don't know, aren't on my friends list can see X, Y, and Z and people are on my list can also see that picture of my penis.

413
00:24:24,484 --> 00:24:24,644
Speaker 0: Yeah.

414
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:29,839
Speaker 0: But you know, it's just a, it's just a way to, you know, broadcast sort of your, uh, exactly.

415
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:41,181
Speaker 1: But like physical space, we don't even need the facial recognition to do a lot of the things we want to do, because why can't I aim the camera at a restaurant and it'll be like right there.

416
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:44,474
Speaker 0: It chose me all the info about the restaurant that I just looked at in the camera.

417
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:44,895
Speaker 0: Yup.

418
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:46,800
Speaker 0: Cause the restaurant's broadcasting profile.

419
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:56,411
Speaker 1: Couldn't reference and immediately present personal information, identifying anyone other than the user.

420
00:24:56,792 --> 00:24:58,117
Speaker 1: What if I delay it by a second?

421
00:24:59,021 --> 00:24:59,302
Speaker 0: Okay.

422
00:24:59,583 --> 00:24:59,804
Speaker 1: Yeah.

423
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,490
Speaker 1: Google probably just say like, yeah, whatever.

424
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:12,353
Speaker 1: Not let me in anyway, but anyone who is happy about this news is stupid because either they think that this will stop us or they are afraid of this.

425
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:28,029
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day, this is good candidate for a Monday rather than a Tuesday.

426
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:36,753
Speaker 1: You all may know the famous, famously bad, notorious old game called ET, the extra terrestrial on the Atari 2,600.

427
00:25:36,753 --> 00:25:37,154
Speaker 1: The game is bad.

428
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,683
Speaker 1: Not going to say it's not bad, but it isn't really significantly worse than most other games on the 2,600.

429
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:47,889
Speaker 0: coming around to my position.

430
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,345
Speaker 0: I've always had that position because I mean, people like, Oh my God, ET is the worst.

431
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:55,202
Speaker 0: And I'm like, look, ET is not a good game, but ET is not even close to the worst.

432
00:25:55,263 --> 00:26:02,210
Speaker 1: People who freak out about how bad ET is, or the same people who freak out about how bad Castlevania 2 is like, yes, you were right.

433
00:26:02,511 --> 00:26:07,506
Speaker 1: Those games are both bad, but not for any of the reasons you say they're bad.

434
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:18,220
Speaker 1: ET is an Atari 2,600 game and programming for something like that way different from the kind of programming most of you have probably ever done.

435
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:23,054
Speaker 1: You can't just change anything easily.

436
00:26:23,074 --> 00:26:25,946
Speaker 1: It's already written and say you want to like, let's change the code.

437
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:28,120
Speaker 1: Let's make him green instead of blue or something.

438
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,749
Speaker 1: You can't even do the kinds of things you would do in an NES rom.

439
00:26:32,852 --> 00:26:44,964
Speaker 1: So this is an extremely detailed breakdown of the actual code in this game and the hex values to change to make the game objectively better.

440
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:45,848
Speaker 0: Yeah.

441
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:52,598
Speaker 0: I mean, ET, you know, for all its badness and that's, you know, sort of just part of the game, there's badness that doesn't have to be part of the game.

442
00:26:52,638 --> 00:26:57,544
Speaker 0: Like you, when ET walks near the holes in the ground, you'll fall in when it doesn't look like you should have fall down.

443
00:26:57,585 --> 00:27:03,352
Speaker 1: But the reason for that, well, you won't fall in when it looks like you should have, but this article gets into good reasons as to why.

444
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:08,172
Speaker 1: that is because the way you coded stuff, there weren't frame buffers or anything.

445
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:10,944
Speaker 1: You would just manually draw the entire screen.

446
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:16,967
Speaker 1: And if you wanted to detect a collision, you would basically draw the screen and check for pixels to be overlapping.

447
00:27:17,248 --> 00:27:17,449
Speaker 0: Yep.

448
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,676
Speaker 1: Like that level of bullshit.

449
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:35,911
Speaker 1: There's a great moment when you scroll down in this thing where in order to free up enough bits, to be able to add a slightly more complex behavior to a function somewhere, he did that by reducing the granularity of the graphics on one of the dudes that walks around.

450
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:36,794
Speaker 0: Did the FBI guy?

451
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:37,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:43,760
Speaker 1: By reducing his graphical load, he freed up a bunch of bits that he could then use to put function stuff in.

453
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:45,649
Speaker 0: This is real programming people.

454
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:45,911
Speaker 1: Yeah.

455
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:51,697
Speaker 1: This is the kind of stuff that if you, if you're in college right now, you should try to learn something like this.

456
00:27:51,717 --> 00:27:52,440
Speaker 0: It was so weird.

457
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:01,679
Speaker 0: Cause like when I was in college, I was actually like, I didn't a hundred percent in my brain, consciously understand like the assembly stuff, but I got like A's in all those classes.

458
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:07,424
Speaker 0: And I remember going to the lab with all like the VT one hundreds, you know, hooked up to who knows what machines, right?

459
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,492
Speaker 0: Writing like VAX assembly or some shit.

460
00:28:10,114 --> 00:28:14,914
Speaker 0: And I'm sitting in the lab and everyone else is doing the lab and our project is due, you know, next day or something.

461
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:18,389
Speaker 0: And I finish and I walk up and get out and everyone else is still sitting there.

462
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:22,484
Speaker 0: And I'm like, Whoa, I thought I was not good.

463
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:23,771
Speaker 0: I didn't really understand what I did.

464
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,220
Speaker 0: I just sort of hammered it till it worked.

465
00:28:26,503 --> 00:28:30,119
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess I have sort of like this weird, like I'm good at it, but I don't know.

466
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,931
Speaker 0: Or, you know, I don't know if I could do it now.

467
00:28:31,972 --> 00:28:32,818
Speaker 0: I need a book or something.

468
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,322
Speaker 1: They're there here.

469
00:28:34,363 --> 00:28:36,891
Speaker 1: I'll read you a sentence here.

470
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:41,888
Speaker 1: Where are we going to find an extra four bytes in an Atari cartridge?

471
00:28:41,908 --> 00:28:43,012
Speaker 0: You're lucky to have one bite.

472
00:28:43,052 --> 00:28:45,360
Speaker 1: Four bites is a big deal in this thing.

473
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,847
Speaker 1: This is a great article.

474
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,740
Speaker 0: I mean, there's only a few thousand bytes in the fricking cartridge.

475
00:28:50,121 --> 00:28:52,673
Speaker 1: What's cool is that this is that he actually did it.

476
00:28:52,713 --> 00:28:53,779
Speaker 1: I mean, this is working code.

477
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,869
Speaker 1: You can download the bin where he made his changes.

478
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:57,880
Speaker 1: You can just look at the code, just a bunch of hacks.

479
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,940
Speaker 0: You get one of those flashable Atari cartridges and play it on our Atari.

480
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:02,926
Speaker 1: That would be kind of epic.

481
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:03,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

482
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:05,637
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is pretty cool.

483
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:06,400
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

484
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,562
Speaker 0: Oh, so this guy, uh, he sort of made this like 3d animations, but it's more like a kinetic sculpture, right?

485
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:19,804
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, we tend to think kinetic sculptures is like a physical sculpture that moves in real life.

486
00:29:20,065 --> 00:29:20,285
Speaker 0: Right.

487
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:28,034
Speaker 0: But what if you made a sculpture in 3d digitally on a computer and he just moved the camera around the sculpture, right?

488
00:29:28,054 --> 00:29:28,858
Speaker 0: To sort of look at it.

489
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:31,549
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, it's like a virtual sculpture.

490
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:34,480
Speaker 0: The same way a JPEG is a virtual painting in the art museum.

491
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:34,963
Speaker 0: Right.

492
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:38,120
Speaker 0: So the thing that's interesting is the way he generated these sculptures.

493
00:29:38,841 --> 00:29:45,019
Speaker 0: is he took sort of like the, the street fighter characters, like guile, Ken, right?

494
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,583
Speaker 0: Were you Blanca Chunley?

495
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:55,030
Speaker 0: And he turned them into sort of like a pile of particles and then made them move and do their moves, leaving a trail behind them.

496
00:29:55,111 --> 00:30:04,826
Speaker 0: And then sort of that trail is like painting into the three dimensional space, like using a three dimensional object, the street fighter fighter as a brush, right?

497
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:08,378
Speaker 0: To paint a three dimensional sculpture as it moves.

498
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:09,100
Speaker 0: Pretty cool.

499
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,287
Speaker 0: Uh, it's a Vimeo staff pick.

500
00:30:11,347 --> 00:30:13,133
Speaker 0: Ooh, I guess that means it's good.

501
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:17,851
Speaker 0: If you like street fighter, if you like arts, three D's, you'll like this videos.

502
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:19,177
Speaker 1: It is pretty cool.

503
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:19,860
Speaker 0: It's cool.

504
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,770
Speaker 1: In the moment, the book club book is player of games.

505
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,537
Speaker 0: Even started reading it.

506
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:28,694
Speaker 1: Whenever my jury duty starts, I will probably read all of it doesn't happen.

507
00:30:29,256 --> 00:30:30,502
Speaker 1: Uh, then I'll make time to read it.

508
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:31,125
Speaker 1: Cause I have to read it.

509
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,659
Speaker 0: It's been a while here since this has been selected.

510
00:30:33,739 --> 00:30:34,663
Speaker 1: I've been busy with stuff.

511
00:30:35,045 --> 00:30:35,266
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

512
00:30:35,286 --> 00:30:39,583
Speaker 1: You're going to be able to keep clear what happens in that book versus the other books.

513
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:40,387
Speaker 0: Yeah.

514
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,049
Speaker 0: Pretty easily.

515
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:41,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

516
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:46,614
Speaker 0: They're, they're so not even, it's not like, you know, some Prince of nothing or like a Lord of the rings.

517
00:30:46,634 --> 00:30:48,625
Speaker 0: where it's like, when did one end and when did the one begin?

518
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:50,319
Speaker 0: They're completely separate books, separate characters.

519
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:51,364
Speaker 0: They're just in the same universe.

520
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,935
Speaker 0: So there's no question at all.

521
00:30:53,975 --> 00:30:54,598
Speaker 1: I'll read it soon.

522
00:30:54,718 --> 00:30:54,879
Speaker 1: Yeah.

523
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,687
Speaker 1: Where going to be a kinetic con, do it?

524
00:30:56,707 --> 00:30:58,475
Speaker 1: a bunch of panels running panels.

525
00:30:58,736 --> 00:31:03,995
Speaker 1: We're going to be at Pax Australia doing a new updated beyond dungeons and dragons.

526
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,443
Speaker 0: I guess those Australians don't know about indie RPGs.

527
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,789
Speaker 1: I think the wombat theater.

528
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:10,079
Speaker 0: I don't know what sound of wombat makes.

529
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,031
Speaker 1: I can't really describe the sound of wombat makes.

530
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,198
Speaker 0: We can go on YouTube and find out.

531
00:31:15,218 --> 00:31:15,620
Speaker 0: We can.

532
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,325
Speaker 0: Anyway, does it even make a sound?

533
00:31:17,567 --> 00:31:18,592
Speaker 1: I'm assuming it makes a sound.

534
00:31:18,632 --> 00:31:20,681
Speaker 1: Most animals make some form of sound.

535
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:21,424
Speaker 0: Some don't.

536
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:23,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, but many do anyway.

537
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:28,166
Speaker 1: Anyway, other metas that we got a forum, we got video, we got stuff.

538
00:31:28,366 --> 00:31:39,547
Speaker 0: You should come onto the internet and Facebooks and Twitters and Google pluses and YouTube and all those places and look for front row crew and geek nights and find our shit and look for us.

539
00:31:39,969 --> 00:31:40,170
Speaker 1: Yep.

540
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,227
Speaker 1: If you're at a convention that you think we should be at, don't tell us, tell the convention.

541
00:31:44,327 --> 00:31:44,789
Speaker 0: That's right.

542
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:50,465
Speaker 1: And yeah, the next, I mean, beyond that, we got what packs dev packs prime.

543
00:31:50,485 --> 00:31:51,086
Speaker 0: I don't know.

544
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:53,191
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to magfest.

545
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:53,451
Speaker 1: Okay.

546
00:31:53,471 --> 00:32:01,729
Speaker 0: So today's show is about testing, right?

547
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:06,265
Speaker 0: Specifically software testing, which has become a huge topic as of late, right?

548
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:15,254
Speaker 1: So it's been a huge topic as of late for a couple of years, because in the gaming industry, people try to get into the gaming industry by being QA testers.

549
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:20,733
Speaker 0: That's related to testing that are all sorted together, right?

550
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:22,662
Speaker 0: There's the fundamental, like, what is testing?

551
00:32:22,963 --> 00:32:23,686
Speaker 0: Should you do it?

552
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:32,642
Speaker 0: There's QA, there's unit testing, there's functional testing, there's test driven development, user acceptance testing, which is very distinct for quality assurance testing.

553
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:35,315
Speaker 0: And there's the, there's the technological process.

554
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:42,300
Speaker 0: And then there's the, you know, sort of job and industry of QA testing, which is the big game industry issue, right?

555
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,660
Speaker 0: These people slaving away, you know, having web comics made about them and stuff like that.

556
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:49,987
Speaker 0: So I guess we just started the beginning, right?

557
00:32:50,028 --> 00:32:53,278
Speaker 0: So software testing fundamentally, right?

558
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:57,913
Speaker 0: The core idea is that a computer is input processing output, right?

559
00:32:58,415 --> 00:33:15,581
Speaker 0: So what you do when you want to confirm that a software, this code that is doing the processing is correct, is you, you write by hand quotes by hand, a tape, an input tape, you run it through the process and you get the output tape.

560
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:20,016
Speaker 0: Then you have another output tape that you also wrote by hand.

561
00:33:20,177 --> 00:33:21,542
Speaker 0: That's basically the right answer.

562
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:25,033
Speaker 0: And you compare the output tapes and see if they match.

563
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:30,473
Speaker 0: If they don't match either you were wrong in the output tape, you wrote by hand or the program is wrong.

564
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:36,677
Speaker 0: And you just keep running through different input tapes and match them up to the appropriate output tapes.

565
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,102
Speaker 0: And they should all match.

566
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,931
Speaker 0: And if they all match, then you're good.

567
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:50,200
Speaker 1: Now, obviously it's basically impossible for modern complex software to have a set of input and output tapes that covers every use case.

568
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:50,480
Speaker 0: Yes.

569
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,693
Speaker 0: It's not possible to cover every conceivable input, right?

570
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:55,922
Speaker 0: It's like, cause there's infinite inputs.

571
00:33:55,942 --> 00:34:00,359
Speaker 1: Did someone click on element A then B with a 1.8 millisecond pause?

572
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,361
Speaker 0: Right.

573
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:04,451
Speaker 0: A 1.87 millisecond pause, right?

574
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:05,273
Speaker 0: Stuff like that.

575
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:08,585
Speaker 0: You can't test every possible iteration, but you can test enough.

576
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:11,802
Speaker 0: For example, let's say there's a box that someone can type into, right?

577
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:31,809
Speaker 0: Well, obviously there's infinity different things they can type into the box, but you can have them type in letters, numbers, letters with spaces, letters with weird characters, letters, numbers, and weird characters, mixing capitals and lower cases, you know, a bunch of enough different combinations of things can be typed into the box that you're satisfied that the box is working properly, right?

578
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,282
Speaker 0: With pretty much almost anything that's going to happen, right?

579
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:39,215
Speaker 0: And what really you're not going for is every possible input.

580
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:48,007
Speaker 0: What you're going for when you're testing is what's called coverage, which is, is every line of code in your program being executed at some point, right?

581
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:51,705
Speaker 0: Because let's say I have a program and the program's like, take in an input.

582
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,650
Speaker 0: If it's all numbers, do this.

583
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:55,096
Speaker 0: If it's all letters, do that.

584
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,645
Speaker 0: And if it's neither, then do the third thing.

585
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:59,513
Speaker 0: So there's three possible things it can do, right?

586
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:03,451
Speaker 0: So if I only test it with letters, that's two thirds of my code.

587
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:06,023
Speaker 0: That's not being tested because those two things never happen.

588
00:35:06,063 --> 00:35:10,042
Speaker 1: And say you don't test it for three versions and something breaks and no one notices, right?

589
00:35:10,283 --> 00:35:26,783
Speaker 0: When my tests need to, I need to have enough tests that all three of the possible cases of the software will happen at least a few times in, you know, different tests so that I know all the different parts of the code are working because the tests touch all the parts of the code, right?

590
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:27,787
Speaker 0: And that's you want it.

591
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:33,251
Speaker 0: The goal is, quote, 100 percent coverage, which is sort of not achievable, but, you know, you can go for it.

592
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:40,139
Speaker 1: Well, there's a there's a. there's a sort of more useful metric of 100 percent functional coverage, meaning you cover every.

593
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:43,993
Speaker 1: I mean, this is mostly for software that has some user interface, right?

594
00:35:44,013 --> 00:35:47,565
Speaker 0: So this is the unit testing and the functional testing.

595
00:35:48,067 --> 00:35:52,562
Speaker 0: unit testing is you're basically testing the bits of code with other code.

596
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:57,487
Speaker 0: Like you have a function and you have another piece of code and all that piece of code does is like a test code.

597
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:58,933
Speaker 0: But it's kind of just calls the function.

598
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:04,734
Speaker 0: who QA is the QA, but then a functional test is from the front end.

599
00:36:04,754 --> 00:36:06,540
Speaker 0: It's like someone playing the video game.

600
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:08,606
Speaker 0: that is functional testing, right?

601
00:36:08,647 --> 00:36:20,208
Speaker 0: But somebody who is basically manually executing the draw character function with different inputs or a usually that's automated, like another program will run and poke at your code.

602
00:36:20,248 --> 00:36:23,841
Speaker 0: That's unit testing is just code executing one part of the code.

603
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:31,219
Speaker 1: Let's go let's start from like the closest to the code and all the levels like, you know, it's like dev test and then there's unit testing and then QA and then UAT.

604
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,026
Speaker 1: Like what is what should be?

605
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:38,167
Speaker 0: some of those are technological processes and some of them are sort of like organizational.

606
00:36:38,207 --> 00:36:43,793
Speaker 1: But if we're going to do that, I guess we should start with TDD because I guess the test comes before the code in that case.

607
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:44,034
Speaker 0: Right.

608
00:36:44,054 --> 00:36:45,320
Speaker 0: Well, that's the rage lately.

609
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,032
Speaker 0: There's a whole clan test driven develop, right?

610
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:53,737
Speaker 0: There's tons of people on the Internet's in the dev program and communities who are really pushing test driven development.

611
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:54,943
Speaker 0: They've been pushing it for years.

612
00:36:55,264 --> 00:37:05,343
Speaker 0: And what the idea of test driven development is that you're going to write a program, you write a test first, then you write the program, then you run the test to make sure the test works.

613
00:37:05,363 --> 00:37:06,870
Speaker 0: And then, you know, you've written the program.

614
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:14,579
Speaker 1: An analogy would be in like if I'm designing like a function and want something we're doing and I design like the GUI for it.

615
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:21,995
Speaker 1: And then the only documentation I write is what the output should be for every input, no code or anything.

616
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:25,605
Speaker 0: I an adding function.

617
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:25,886
Speaker 0: Right.

618
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:29,020
Speaker 0: So I say, well, if the inputs are one and one, the output should be two.

619
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,169
Speaker 0: If the inputs are one and two, the output should be three.

620
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:31,912
Speaker 0: The inputs are three.

621
00:37:31,932 --> 00:37:35,669
Speaker 1: I make a list of inputs and a list of outputs that I guarantee.

622
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:37,015
Speaker 0: I do all that first.

623
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:45,666
Speaker 0: Then I when I go to write the adding function, I'm like def add input one input to, you know, input one, you know, return input one plus input two.

624
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:47,213
Speaker 0: And then I can run all those tests.

625
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,603
Speaker 0: And if they all have thumbs up, then I know.

626
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:52,918
Speaker 0: I know that the code I wrote matches what I was intending to do.

627
00:37:52,978 --> 00:38:05,419
Speaker 1: I'll admit, I feel like what usually happens in places that follow that to any reasonably strict degree is junior developers not seeing the forest for the trees and writing to some test.

628
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:11,783
Speaker 1: And you have all these little compartmentalized pieces of code that may not be the most efficient overall architecture.

629
00:38:12,385 --> 00:38:21,254
Speaker 1: And I think it's used primarily by people who either hire a lot of developers fresh out of college because they're used to the like, did your project pass the test?

630
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:25,169
Speaker 1: Like that kind of cycle where you guys are right.

631
00:38:25,189 --> 00:38:26,656
Speaker 1: You guys would keep submitting your code.

632
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,222
Speaker 1: And then finally, you were Alex.

633
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:29,549
Speaker 1: I want to be like, oh, I passed.

634
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,334
Speaker 1: Now we can play games.

635
00:38:30,655 --> 00:38:30,836
Speaker 0: Yep.

636
00:38:31,379 --> 00:38:33,569
Speaker 0: See, it is the case I make for testing, right?

637
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,216
Speaker 0: Testing is not in and of itself bad.

638
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:35,879
Speaker 1: Testing is.

639
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:36,824
Speaker 0: there's a lot of ways.

640
00:38:36,844 --> 00:38:39,034
Speaker 1: Testing is more important than the development, right?

641
00:38:39,155 --> 00:38:42,612
Speaker 0: Even test driven development has cases where you need, you should use it right.

642
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,000
Speaker 0: And it pretty much comes down to this.

643
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:50,539
Speaker 0: Number one, let's say you're like a consultant and you're making a software for someone and you're going to give it to them and they're going to maintain it, but they might mess it up.

644
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:52,466
Speaker 0: You deliver tests with that.

645
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:57,884
Speaker 0: And that way, you know, you deliver that your program with tests, automated tests.

646
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:02,525
Speaker 0: And then if they call you up for support later and say it's not working, you tell them to run the test.

647
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:05,400
Speaker 0: And if the tests fail, you can say you fucked it up.

648
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,251
Speaker 0: When we gave it to you, all those tests were working.

649
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:07,512
Speaker 0: Yep.

650
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:07,854
Speaker 1: Right.

651
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:18,036
Speaker 1: It's also very useful if you have projects that can be broken down into relatively small chunks that you're giving to different people who might even be siloed from each other, like Apple products.

652
00:39:18,096 --> 00:39:18,357
Speaker 1: Yeah.

653
00:39:18,518 --> 00:39:20,023
Speaker 1: Or like if you outsource.

654
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:20,424
Speaker 0: Yep.

655
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:30,280
Speaker 1: Another thing you need, you basically need to reasonably know that when the code comes out of wherever you gave it to, it at least does what it says it's supposed to do.

656
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,346
Speaker 1: It might not be fast.

657
00:39:31,406 --> 00:39:32,814
Speaker 1: It might not be great, but you know, it works.

658
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,804
Speaker 1: So you don't waste time seeing if it worked.

659
00:39:35,185 --> 00:39:37,515
Speaker 1: You don't have to do code review at that early stage.

660
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:42,856
Speaker 0: Another thing is if you're certain kinds of code are really good at being tested.

661
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:43,137
Speaker 0: Right.

662
00:39:43,177 --> 00:39:46,551
Speaker 0: So if you're writing, I guess I'll stick in my pocket calculator example.

663
00:39:46,591 --> 00:39:46,752
Speaker 0: Right.

664
00:39:46,812 --> 00:39:49,947
Speaker 0: It's really easy to write tests for a pocket calculator.

665
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,373
Speaker 0: It's it's so straightforward.

666
00:39:51,614 --> 00:39:55,650
Speaker 0: The input tapes are small and the output tapes are small and it's easy to write a lot of them.

667
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:59,144
Speaker 0: So, you know, testing that is very easy.

668
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:02,982
Speaker 0: And it's also you don't want to get wrong because, you know, that's it's pretty important.

669
00:40:03,042 --> 00:40:04,005
Speaker 0: Right.

670
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:08,883
Speaker 0: Or what if you were making, say, I don't know, a medical device like an X-ray machine.

671
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:09,384
Speaker 0: Yeah.

672
00:40:09,685 --> 00:40:14,180
Speaker 0: I read some really fucking, you know, serious tests on that X-ray machines.

673
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,540
Speaker 1: You don't fucking kill anybody in radiation machines due to bugs that were not caught in.

674
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,945
Speaker 1: QA have killed people.

675
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:21,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

676
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:23,254
Speaker 0: Airplanes have bugs.

677
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,624
Speaker 0: You know, what was that thing with the batteries and the whatever?

678
00:40:25,644 --> 00:40:26,428
Speaker 0: Yeah.

679
00:40:26,448 --> 00:40:27,613
Speaker 0: That's what you want is the name.

680
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:31,470
Speaker 1: There was that one radiation machine that basically dosed a ton of people with crazy death.

681
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:32,073
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:35,308
Speaker 1: Because the code had a bug and it left a filter open that shouldn't have been open.

683
00:40:35,409 --> 00:40:37,077
Speaker 0: Anything that's super important like that.

684
00:40:37,097 --> 00:40:44,312
Speaker 1: Tests are mandatory, super testing, probably more testing than coding because I'm more on the business side and the operational side of all this.

685
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,622
Speaker 1: But I'm also like the product manager, at least my company.

686
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:49,492
Speaker 1: I make a distinction.

687
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:57,026
Speaker 1: Basically we have at the developer level, you know, you have a separation of duties like developers themselves are responsible for a certain degree of the testing.

688
00:40:57,629 --> 00:41:00,843
Speaker 1: And then the development team as a whole is responsible for like one layer up.

689
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:03,673
Speaker 1: And then there's other teams for higher level testing.

690
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:11,186
Speaker 1: So for me, dev testing is like I'm sitting there, they're sitting there, their ID, they write whatever code they poke at and make sure it just works.

691
00:41:11,246 --> 00:41:19,075
Speaker 0: If they have a local bill, what developer does their code, just write something, presses control, save and says, Eric submission.

692
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,562
Speaker 0: And they didn't even run it once.

693
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:21,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see that.

694
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:22,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

695
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,177
Speaker 0: That's someone who should just be fired immediately.

696
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:25,503
Speaker 1: I've seen that in my life.

697
00:41:25,544 --> 00:41:26,247
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.

698
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:36,438
Speaker 1: I've never actually seen that in my life, actually, but if not so much in my current company, but at a certain other company I worked for, but at our company, right over the build server, we have this poster, it's the Dos Equis guy.

699
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:41,017
Speaker 1: And it's like, I don't always test my code, but when I do, it's in production.

700
00:41:41,037 --> 00:41:44,651
Speaker 0: It's like, seriously, you write some code, you press run to see if it runs.

701
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:45,815
Speaker 0: That's how it goes.

702
00:41:45,956 --> 00:41:54,874
Speaker 1: I mean, that's kind of like most people when they're writing code, especially if you're not like, I don't know, some sort of savant, you write the code and you hit run because it doesn't work the first time.

703
00:41:55,116 --> 00:41:57,105
Speaker 0: Lately it's been getting more and more often.

704
00:41:57,125 --> 00:41:59,155
Speaker 0: I press run and it just works every time.

705
00:41:59,195 --> 00:41:59,416
Speaker 1: Yeah.

706
00:41:59,456 --> 00:42:02,045
Speaker 0: That's a good feeling when it happens too much.

707
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:02,648
Speaker 0: It's frightening.

708
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:04,477
Speaker 1: But I consider that to be dev testing.

709
00:42:04,578 --> 00:42:08,270
Speaker 1: And I believe in unit testing is sort of one step beyond that.

710
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,156
Speaker 0: Unit testing is an automation.

711
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:12,986
Speaker 1: You formalize automated testing of code.

712
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:14,973
Speaker 1: So someone commits some code.

713
00:42:15,334 --> 00:42:17,904
Speaker 1: Well, then maybe you're using Jenkins, like that kind of environment.

714
00:42:17,924 --> 00:42:20,416
Speaker 1: So a build gets made, the build finishes.

715
00:42:20,517 --> 00:42:25,839
Speaker 1: And in the course of the build, all these unit tests run against the current code base to see if anything broke.

716
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,703
Speaker 1: that worked before.

717
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:31,605
Speaker 0: There's tons of software packages out there for testing different languages, different platforms.

718
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:37,591
Speaker 0: And Jenkins is what's known as continuous integration, which is basically you keep writing code.

719
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:43,315
Speaker 0: And every time someone submits code, it integrates the code and builds it and tests it constantly as you're working.

720
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:43,777
Speaker 0: Right.

721
00:42:43,817 --> 00:42:47,430
Speaker 0: Some people even do constant deploy where you constantly integrate.

722
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,059
Speaker 0: And if the build gets a thumbs up, it deploys.

723
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,999
Speaker 0: So you're basically constantly as you're writing code, everything is updating all the time.

724
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:57,532
Speaker 0: And that can work depending on what your project is.

725
00:42:57,612 --> 00:43:03,093
Speaker 1: Now, you can back off of that a little bit and you can use the same kind of tools to people commit code.

726
00:43:03,675 --> 00:43:06,607
Speaker 1: Occasionally someone does a manual build to see if everything's good.

727
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:09,540
Speaker 1: And then they use that build for all further testing.

728
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:13,780
Speaker 1: That way you're not testing something that someone fixed a minute later and no one talked to anybody.

729
00:43:15,043 --> 00:43:15,184
Speaker 1: Yep.

730
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,352
Speaker 1: Beyond that, I don't like developers to have to do testing.

731
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:18,196
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:43:18,557 --> 00:43:21,586
Speaker 1: Beyond that level, you should have a separate QA team.

733
00:43:22,087 --> 00:43:25,075
Speaker 1: that ideally does not exist.

734
00:43:25,516 --> 00:43:27,220
Speaker 1: code like next to the developers.

735
00:43:27,481 --> 00:43:27,642
Speaker 0: Right.

736
00:43:27,662 --> 00:43:39,709
Speaker 0: Because if there's somebody who is capable of testing something and most human beings who can use a computer are capable of functional testing, which is why one of the reasons for the industry problem of QA people not being paid enough.

737
00:43:40,171 --> 00:43:40,392
Speaker 0: Right.

738
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:45,774
Speaker 0: Is that people are capable of doing it, but few are capable or willing of doing it well.

739
00:43:46,035 --> 00:43:46,236
Speaker 0: Right.

740
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:48,725
Speaker 0: But as long as they do it, it seems like a lot of people don't care.

741
00:43:48,745 --> 00:43:55,530
Speaker 1: So basically if the guy who wrote the code is also one testing it, he wrote the code.

742
00:43:55,611 --> 00:44:05,023
Speaker 1: It's like if I draw the picture and then I critique the picture, it's easy for me to not see the obvious flaw or feel like I don't have to test it that thoroughly because I know it works.

743
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:05,826
Speaker 1: I wrote it right.

744
00:44:05,967 --> 00:44:13,997
Speaker 0: Also at the same time, a developer you assume is capable of writing more code and a tester you assume is not capable of writing more code.

745
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:21,448
Speaker 0: Therefore, if you can get the developer to just test it enough that they're not wasting the QA person's time with something that's obviously broken.

746
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,071
Speaker 0: Right.

747
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:33,323
Speaker 0: They hand it off to someone else to test it thoroughly while they, you know, you increase efficiency because now the developer is writing something else now or maybe fixing bugs or something that was just tested the previous thing they wrote.

748
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:43,536
Speaker 1: The most common problems in the industry of development seems to be either QA doesn't catch stuff or development doesn't test wasting QA's time.

749
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,548
Speaker 1: Those seem to be the primary bottlenecks in QA world.

750
00:44:46,588 --> 00:44:46,789
Speaker 0: Yeah.

751
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:47,875
Speaker 0: Ignoring really ignore it.

752
00:44:47,895 --> 00:44:50,265
Speaker 0: We're not going to discuss all the issues that are obvious.

753
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:54,985
Speaker 0: like QA people and you know, developers being overpaid, underpaid and overworked and such.

754
00:44:55,005 --> 00:44:55,769
Speaker 0: That's all awful.

755
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:58,683
Speaker 0: And you should just quit if anyone's doing that to you and find a real job.

756
00:44:58,703 --> 00:45:03,020
Speaker 1: The key is that QA needs to be separate from development in the very least.

757
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:07,760
Speaker 1: If you're a really small shop, if it's just me and Scott, if I write the code, Scott should QA.

758
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,171
Speaker 0: If you just have two developers test each other's shit.

759
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:10,814
Speaker 0: Right.

760
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,366
Speaker 1: And I guess if you just have two, you could do pair programming.

761
00:45:13,446 --> 00:45:14,250
Speaker 0: No, that's fine.

762
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,443
Speaker 0: And then remember the automated tests are like another person.

763
00:45:17,504 --> 00:45:17,805
Speaker 0: Right.

764
00:45:17,865 --> 00:45:22,263
Speaker 0: So as long as, you know, you've got, you know, any some sort of automated testing that's going to check.

765
00:45:22,283 --> 00:45:23,628
Speaker 0: that shit is the thing.

766
00:45:23,689 --> 00:45:23,930
Speaker 0: Right.

767
00:45:24,773 --> 00:45:30,438
Speaker 0: I actually sort of disagree with a lot of these people on the Internet that are like, you know, testing is the best.

768
00:45:30,459 --> 00:45:31,824
Speaker 0: You need to have tests for everything.

769
00:45:31,884 --> 00:45:32,085
Speaker 0: Right.

770
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:33,270
Speaker 1: It's like test.

771
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:33,611
Speaker 1: Yes.

772
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,374
Speaker 1: Unit tests.

773
00:45:34,435 --> 00:45:35,017
Speaker 1: Maybe not.

774
00:45:35,117 --> 00:45:35,278
Speaker 0: Right.

775
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:37,866
Speaker 0: These people, the test driven development people.

776
00:45:38,127 --> 00:45:38,348
Speaker 0: Right.

777
00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:44,759
Speaker 0: Especially they want like, you know, write tests from the beginning and write tests for everything all the time and every project.

778
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:49,358
Speaker 0: And I'm like, dude, I'm writing just like a fucking website here for like a restaurant.

779
00:45:49,378 --> 00:45:49,840
Speaker 0: Who knows what?

780
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:50,101
Speaker 0: right.

781
00:45:50,141 --> 00:45:51,266
Speaker 0: Pretend a restaurant website.

782
00:45:51,628 --> 00:45:52,552
Speaker 0: A restaurant was smart.

783
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:55,022
Speaker 0: Didn't want an ugly old fashioned website.

784
00:45:55,042 --> 00:45:56,991
Speaker 0: Wanted a modern website that's actually usable.

785
00:45:57,011 --> 00:45:58,880
Speaker 0: And they hired me to make it right.

786
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,187
Speaker 0: I'm not writing tests for that shit.

787
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:03,456
Speaker 0: It's a fucking restaurant website.

788
00:46:03,476 --> 00:46:04,620
Speaker 0: Are you serious?

789
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,865
Speaker 0: It's not the end of the world.

790
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:07,814
Speaker 0: The X-ray machine is going to kill people.

791
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:08,557
Speaker 0: Right.

792
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:11,912
Speaker 0: And the amount of time it would take me to write tests to actually cover that.

793
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:13,097
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

794
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:17,255
Speaker 0: I could finish the restaurant website in like an hour, but at the same time, it was a bug.

795
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:17,577
Speaker 0: Okay.

796
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:19,946
Speaker 0: They'll find out later and I'll fix it in like two seconds.

797
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:31,308
Speaker 1: But at the same time, if you completely push unit testing and dev testing out of the way and just write the code, you're going to keep reinventing the wheel and revisiting issues over and over again.

798
00:46:31,328 --> 00:46:38,736
Speaker 1: Or if there is a thing that's prone to breaking, cause it's complex writing the, a bunch of unit tests for that area.

799
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,482
Speaker 1: That's highly prone to regression.

800
00:46:40,723 --> 00:46:50,884
Speaker 1: Once we'll save you a ton of time in the long run, but maybe you don't need unit tests for the basic stuff, but I'm saying there's nothing complex or dangerous or essential in a restaurant website.

801
00:46:50,925 --> 00:46:51,106
Speaker 0: Right.

802
00:46:51,427 --> 00:46:55,629
Speaker 0: And these people, these testing people, they're so crazy about testing and so passionate about it.

803
00:46:55,669 --> 00:46:59,407
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, they're not a mission for like the testing army in my industry.

804
00:46:59,769 --> 00:47:09,286
Speaker 1: And then when I worked in the hospitals before, I would really like those kinds of people doing my QA because there are a lot bigger consequences like with money and with health.

805
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:09,587
Speaker 0: Yeah.

806
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:10,371
Speaker 0: Kind of important.

807
00:47:10,612 --> 00:47:10,913
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:47:11,174 --> 00:47:13,706
Speaker 0: It's the same people who are like, you got to use Postgres.

809
00:47:13,746 --> 00:47:14,209
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

810
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:15,012
Speaker 0: Using my SQL.

811
00:47:15,053 --> 00:47:15,776
Speaker 0: Are you insane?

812
00:47:16,078 --> 00:47:20,674
Speaker 0: And I'm like, it's a shitty website with just like some blog photos and shit on it.

813
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:22,059
Speaker 0: Who gives a crap?

814
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,665
Speaker 0: if it's my SQL that works.

815
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:24,046
Speaker 0: Right.

816
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:24,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

817
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,823
Speaker 0: If I had a bank and someone's using my SQL, they'd be fired immediately.

818
00:47:28,843 --> 00:47:29,505
Speaker 0: Right.

819
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:30,268
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

820
00:47:30,629 --> 00:47:34,303
Speaker 0: But if I'm just running some crappy website, I don't need Postgres.

821
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:38,920
Speaker 0: It's just more work for no, you know, why would I do more work for something so simple?

822
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:44,097
Speaker 0: That'd be like hiring F1 engineers, you know, to fix my Chevy to go to work with.

823
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,289
Speaker 0: It's like, no, the lazy mechanic guy around the corner can do that.

824
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:50,441
Speaker 1: So QA, the, you know, the, the separated testing.

825
00:47:50,642 --> 00:47:54,934
Speaker 1: really, you need people who understand what it is that they're testing.

826
00:47:55,917 --> 00:48:12,404
Speaker 1: Now you don't necessarily need those people to be the ones doing the actual test, especially if it's sort of mechanical Turk humans are doing the testing because often it's cheaper to hire 10 dudes and have them click through and follow a script than it is to have one developer write the unit test equivalent of that.

827
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:28,244
Speaker 1: But you need at least the person who's managing all that to know the product or know the code and understand what is likely to cause a problem and what isn't because you can't give equal weight to testing everything in a large project or testing will take longer than you're already.

828
00:48:28,324 --> 00:48:29,811
Speaker 1: zero budget for it will allow.

829
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:38,684
Speaker 1: That's kind of the separate problem that no one in the world seems to give quality assurance and testing respect nearly enough time or respect.

830
00:48:38,864 --> 00:48:41,694
Speaker 1: The only thing that shit on more than QA is documentation.

831
00:48:41,855 --> 00:48:43,300
Speaker 0: That's true for sure.

832
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:48,882
Speaker 0: The other thing is that a lot of people, they really want to make all the testing automated, right?

833
00:48:48,922 --> 00:48:51,291
Speaker 0: Like everything, even functional testing automated.

834
00:48:51,352 --> 00:48:51,592
Speaker 0: Right.

835
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:58,984
Speaker 0: And to a certain extent, there are tools like you can use this selenium things like test websites that like click on your website for you and stuff.

836
00:48:59,064 --> 00:48:59,245
Speaker 0: Right.

837
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:07,152
Speaker 0: I only see value personally in automating unit testing when the inputs and the outputs are relatively simple.

838
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:07,593
Speaker 0: Right.

839
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:16,947
Speaker 0: When the inputs and outputs are complex, just testing for like a direct match, which is all an automated test can do is not really, you know, help.

840
00:49:17,047 --> 00:49:21,485
Speaker 0: It's first of all, those tests are really hard and time consuming to make, even with tools that help you.

841
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:26,402
Speaker 0: And second of all, they you need really need a human to interpret, right?

842
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:29,334
Speaker 0: The incredibly complex inputs and outputs, right?

843
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:31,986
Speaker 0: The input isn't just like the numbers one and two because you're testing it out.

844
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:34,138
Speaker 1: This is where you want to be semi-automatic.

845
00:49:34,399 --> 00:49:36,692
Speaker 1: make tools that allow like, say you have a complex system.

846
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:40,351
Speaker 1: We have to stage in a bunch of data and then a user does something with it.

847
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:43,645
Speaker 1: Automate in the testing environment, the staging of that data.

848
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:44,509
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

849
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:44,770
Speaker 0: Right.

850
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:47,180
Speaker 1: Maybe even automate the testing on the other side.

851
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:58,846
Speaker 1: if the person is going to follow a script, but the person doing like using the GUI, clicking on things while he's doing the same things, he'll notice if, yes, this worked, but the button turned gray.

852
00:49:58,926 --> 00:50:06,616
Speaker 0: And this is why most of the testing horror stories come from the video game industry because video games, especially 3D ones, have highly complex inputs.

853
00:50:06,957 --> 00:50:10,612
Speaker 0: And the outputs are also highly complex and just can't be compared directly.

854
00:50:10,653 --> 00:50:12,259
Speaker 0: They need to be human interpreted.

855
00:50:12,299 --> 00:50:19,125
Speaker 0: Like if your game is a racing game, it's like, you know, okay, I turn left and it's like, yeah, what are you going to do?

856
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:24,664
Speaker 0: Check the, the 1920 by 1080 screen to match the pixels against a pre another, a picture.

857
00:50:24,926 --> 00:50:27,799
Speaker 1: Now you might say, why don't you just trust the code to test itself?

858
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:29,085
Speaker 1: And it gives you the inputs and outputs.

859
00:50:29,788 --> 00:50:31,053
Speaker 1: That's like trusting.

860
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:33,645
Speaker 1: That's like trusting the security guard to not rob the bank.

861
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:34,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

862
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:36,921
Speaker 1: He probably won't because there's all these other structures in place.

863
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:39,430
Speaker 1: Imagine a world where security guards are untouchable.

864
00:50:40,314 --> 00:50:46,956
Speaker 1: Imagine a world where, you know, I wrote the code that tells you what you're seeing and the code is wrong.

865
00:50:47,236 --> 00:50:49,524
Speaker 1: The code probably thinks it's doing the right thing.

866
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:53,620
Speaker 1: Not that the code is sentient, but it's data stream might be consistent.

867
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:00,188
Speaker 1: It might make sense and be providing the technically correct outputs that don't actually work in the actual use case.

868
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:04,667
Speaker 0: If you want to learn some computer science, you can look up this interesting thing called the halting problem.

869
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:11,332
Speaker 0: And it's basically, this question is, can you write a program that can tell if another program is in an infinite loop?

870
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:14,626
Speaker 1: So spoilers, I guess, you know what guys go look up the answer.

871
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:15,188
Speaker 0: Yeah.

872
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:17,119
Speaker 0: Go read the Wikipedia page about halting problem.

873
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:21,793
Speaker 0: And you'll see some of the problems with, uh, you know, testing.

874
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:26,208
Speaker 1: I remember one time at RIT, we were going to, we wanted to go to like bill graze or something.

875
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:34,060
Speaker 1: And you submitted some, so hungry, even though you submitted some projects to the computer science, whatever server for test.

876
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:36,432
Speaker 1: And it just didn't like, it was running.

877
00:51:36,472 --> 00:51:37,497
Speaker 1: It was like, ah, I guess it failed.

878
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:38,100
Speaker 1: And you gave up.

879
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,064
Speaker 1: You're like, I guess I'll fail.

880
00:51:39,084 --> 00:51:40,490
Speaker 1: And we all went out to eat.

881
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:47,515
Speaker 1: We went back to our dorm rooms and I remember you noticing that the test had finished and it's just taken a long time.

882
00:51:47,535 --> 00:51:47,595
Speaker 1: Yep.

883
00:51:47,836 --> 00:51:50,425
Speaker 0: Everyone is trying to submit their shit at once.

884
00:51:50,826 --> 00:51:51,047
Speaker 1: Yep.

885
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,322
Speaker 1: But yeah, there's no way to know if Scott's code is an infinite loop.

886
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:56,143
Speaker 1: Yeah.

887
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:56,605
Speaker 1: Spoilers.

888
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:59,692
Speaker 1: You can guess.

889
00:52:00,012 --> 00:52:09,461
Speaker 1: maybe you have a test where if this thing takes longer than an hour, let's assume that it got into a loop, drop a stack, and then say the build failed.

890
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:18,460
Speaker 1: So beyond that user acceptance testing UAT, there is a difference between QA and UAT.

891
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:25,662
Speaker 1: A QA person will sit there and follow a very strict script of test this, this way, test this, this way.

892
00:52:26,063 --> 00:52:29,655
Speaker 1: They're basically just doing a complex human version of unit testing.

893
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:37,532
Speaker 1: And maybe you'll like, first they'll test all the changes that the developers made to this new version of something to make sure those things work the way they should.

894
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:40,669
Speaker 1: And then they'll test everything else to make sure it also works the way it should.

895
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:40,950
Speaker 0: Right.

896
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:43,201
Speaker 0: That's the big thing a lot of people miss, right?

897
00:52:43,262 --> 00:52:44,748
Speaker 0: Is the regression test, right?

898
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:47,780
Speaker 0: It's like, let's say I update the homepage of the website.

899
00:52:48,162 --> 00:52:50,415
Speaker 0: So everyone's testing the homepage to make sure it works.

900
00:52:50,435 --> 00:52:55,115
Speaker 0: You're testing the homepage, but nobody went and tested like, I don't know, the about page.

901
00:52:55,476 --> 00:52:59,151
Speaker 0: And you know what happened when I was messing with the homepage and updating it, I got it right.

902
00:52:59,734 --> 00:53:02,225
Speaker 0: But I messed up the about page because I changed something.

903
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,215
Speaker 1: That's why it's called regression tests.

904
00:53:04,275 --> 00:53:07,553
Speaker 1: If you're looking to see if your functionality has regressed, gone backwards.

905
00:53:07,573 --> 00:53:08,960
Speaker 0: We did a thing on the about page.

906
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,215
Speaker 0: We fixed a problem there, but now that problem got unfixed by something else.

907
00:53:13,476 --> 00:53:16,449
Speaker 0: But we wrote a test for that when we fixed it in the first place.

908
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,096
Speaker 0: And now that test is failing.

909
00:53:18,116 --> 00:53:19,865
Speaker 0: And we say, aha, I remember when we wrote that test.

910
00:53:19,925 --> 00:53:20,669
Speaker 0: It was because of this.

911
00:53:20,971 --> 00:53:22,640
Speaker 0: And we know exactly where in the code to look.

912
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:25,591
Speaker 0: because aha, we fixed that before and it got unfixed.

913
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,635
Speaker 0: Let's fix it again.

914
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,125
Speaker 0: Cause we re broke it when we updated the homepage.

915
00:53:29,145 --> 00:53:33,320
Speaker 1: Now, these things are the only things QA should be testing.

916
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:48,895
Speaker 1: You QA might give guidance, might have opinions on things, but user acceptance testing is where the people you're delivering the code to, or, you know, Matt, whoever it is, who's making the higher level decisions uses it as a user to see if it works in the way that they expect.

917
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:54,092
Speaker 1: So a QA bug would be something like when you click on the sync button, it just doesn't work.

918
00:53:55,036 --> 00:54:01,740
Speaker 1: But a UAT bug would be, I can't get all of the data for my report to display on the screen at the same time.

919
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,268
Speaker 0: That could be just, you don't know what you're doing.

920
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:08,210
Speaker 1: It could be, that could be, but then that's still an issue you were raised.

921
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:11,201
Speaker 1: Cause that's the situation of, is it because the documentation is bad?

922
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:12,326
Speaker 1: Is it because they're stupid?

923
00:54:12,588 --> 00:54:14,637
Speaker 1: Is it because the interface is not intuitive?

924
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:16,783
Speaker 0: It's almost always yeah.

925
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:27,818
Speaker 1: But even then, if you're selling, if you're selling to P to problem, if you're selling to the person on the chair interfacing with the keyboard, you got to fix it somehow.

926
00:54:27,858 --> 00:54:30,228
Speaker 0: So they give you their money exactly to open the wallet.

927
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:31,653
Speaker 0: You have to still fix the bed.

928
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:34,343
Speaker 1: But QA is internally making sure the thing is good.

929
00:54:34,724 --> 00:54:39,539
Speaker 1: UAT is, Hey, customer, here's the beta of the next version.

930
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:40,743
Speaker 1: Make sure it works for you.

931
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:47,228
Speaker 1: Make sure this, you know, this build of natural selection too, you can still be gorge and do all your gorgeous things.

932
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:48,352
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

933
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:49,075
Speaker 0: All the fades.

934
00:54:49,295 --> 00:54:50,500
Speaker 0: This happened in NS two ones.

935
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,413
Speaker 0: All the fades could just get blink even though blink wasn't research yet.

936
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:54,880
Speaker 0: That was pretty awesome.

937
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:56,707
Speaker 0: That was an awesome build.

938
00:54:56,747 --> 00:55:00,105
Speaker 0: Everyone was playing just blinking everywhere and the aliens were kicking everyone's ass.

939
00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:03,504
Speaker 1: I imagine the first server where someone noticed that and they were like, guys, I'll go fade.

940
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:04,347
Speaker 1: I'll fade.

941
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:04,950
Speaker 1: I'll fade.

942
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:10,690
Speaker 0: It wasn't quite that bad, but yeah, it was, it was a problem for a whole build, but that's UAT.

943
00:55:10,871 --> 00:55:13,620
Speaker 1: user acceptance testing is what UAT stands for.

944
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,652
Speaker 1: It is distinct from QA and distinct from dev testing.

945
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:19,564
Speaker 0: So there's this whole crazy world of testing that goes on.

946
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:21,914
Speaker 0: It has so many fucking different aspects to it.

947
00:55:22,516 --> 00:55:26,110
Speaker 1: We could talk for hours about just like QA best practices.

948
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,877
Speaker 1: Like how do you test different kinds of things?

949
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:28,198
Speaker 0: Right.

950
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:36,527
Speaker 0: But I think the fundamental thing here is that, you know, personally, I feel that there's a huge push from testing coming from the programming community.

951
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:40,200
Speaker 0: And I think that a lot of that pushing is correct.

952
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:56,078
Speaker 0: Obviously I want my, you know, surgery machine to be tested incredibly thoroughly and the spaceship and who knows what else, but I do not want, I think it's a waste of time to test something like a restaurant website or, you know, a simple flash game or something.

953
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:59,555
Speaker 0: Cause it's like, you know, seriously, the amount of time is going to take you to write tests.

954
00:56:00,037 --> 00:56:05,280
Speaker 0: You could have just, you know, fix the bugs after when you release it or what you have to do a cause benefit analysis.

955
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:11,324
Speaker 1: You have to decide how much will it hurt me if the thing that I'm building doesn't work when I give it to someone.

956
00:56:11,425 --> 00:56:18,100
Speaker 0: I can tell you in that a hundred percent of the work that I have done personally in the real world, writing tests would have taken longer than doing it.

957
00:56:19,821 --> 00:56:30,944
Speaker 1: I'll tell you this writing the script to test something like writing the list of here are the things to test and the basic idea of how to test them takes longer than writing the code for the things you want to test.

958
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:31,426
Speaker 0: Exactly.

959
00:56:31,466 --> 00:56:33,736
Speaker 0: So I would get half as much, you know, things done.

960
00:56:34,278 --> 00:56:36,005
Speaker 0: And the thing is it's weird, right?

961
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,812
Speaker 0: The stuff is not too complicated.

962
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:40,924
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's like, yeah, I sit around not doing much.

963
00:56:41,004 --> 00:56:49,696
Speaker 0: I could have, you know, write some tests in that free time maybe, or if I wanted to, but I don't need to cause my shit's working even without those tests.

964
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:50,037
Speaker 1: Yup.

965
00:56:50,639 --> 00:57:08,161
Speaker 1: But I guess I see that push and I'll take advantage of it because on the other side for large software projects, I like enterprise software and just a lot of even games, bugs just are everywhere because people don't test or they test really inefficiently a lot, especially in the video game industry.

966
00:57:08,202 --> 00:57:16,399
Speaker 1: There's this kind of, you know, the, the people who want to get in the video game industry, why they basically end up being testers because that's the job that they can do.

967
00:57:17,362 --> 00:57:17,883
Speaker 0: If

968
00:57:18,024 --> 00:57:18,104
Speaker 1: you

969
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:20,191
Speaker 0: don't have programming or art skills or anything,

970
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:34,500
Speaker 1: but the people who can direct that testing, the people who would run the whole like QA farm for a game probably could also either write the code or design the system in the first place and they'll make way more money doing that.

971
00:57:34,861 --> 00:57:44,410
Speaker 1: So it's hard to keep good people managing testing and the people who are actually doing the testing rightfully or wrongfully are not valued by the company.

972
00:57:45,654 --> 00:57:50,533
Speaker 0: Especially since it's pretty much a matter of, yeah, there's people desperate scabs basically.

973
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:54,770
Speaker 0: There's not a union, but you know, there's other people who want that job or willing to do it.

974
00:57:55,252 --> 00:58:10,898
Speaker 1: And so if you say jump, I'll say how many times this has been geek nights with rim and Scott special thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

975
00:58:10,938 --> 00:58:11,259
