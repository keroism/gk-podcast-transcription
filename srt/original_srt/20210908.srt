Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:16,790
Speaker 1: We are talking about the Superman.

5
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:20,047
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,462 --> 00:00:24,386
Speaker 0: Well who designed it?

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:24,848
Speaker 0: who does not?

8
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:26,094
Speaker 0: who designed these fucking knees?

9
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:27,380
Speaker 0: what garbage yeah?

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,819
Speaker 1: Hey, if you're talking about the knees I have some concerns around the upper and lower back while we're at it.

11
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:35,848
Speaker 0: Why are we standing?

12
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:40,079
Speaker 0: if we just didn't stand up straight we'd be all right Yeah, but standing up straight does have some benefits.

13
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:41,904
Speaker 0: Reaching high shit.

14
00:00:42,145 --> 00:00:43,751
Speaker 0: all right you can just reach.

15
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,880
Speaker 0: stand up straight when you got to reach high shit, then go back down.

16
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:47,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, why you got to stay up there?

17
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:56,992
Speaker 1: So years ago I was having a problem with my left knee Biking which had been a problem that occurred off and on my entire life.

18
00:00:57,052 --> 00:00:57,875
Speaker 1: like it would come and go.

19
00:00:57,895 --> 00:01:07,312
Speaker 0: and yeah lots of people Have biking knee problems, and we usually say either gear too high gear too low seat too high seat too low right always something like that Back.

20
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:19,579
Speaker 1: I did originally fix that problem by going to a bike shop and sitting down with an expert who sized my bike to the right height and Watch me pedal and then fucked with it, and then like and he was like okay You probably won't have any knee problems again.

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:36,460
Speaker 1: And if you do then raise it up a half a centimeter or down a half a centimeter and see if it goes away Like from this and it disappeared like no knee problems, but then I started biking a lot And Especially last summer over COVID like I started biking centuries like pretty regularly.

22
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:42,272
Speaker 1: That's a hundred miles if you're not like bike people just call it a century for Reasons you can imagine like.

23
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:43,560
Speaker 1: it's a nice way to say it.

24
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,051
Speaker 0: But a lot of people a lot of people try to be like a bike to metric century.

25
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:55,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Biked a Gregorian century anyway, so uh my knee problems came and went.

26
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:59,459
Speaker 1: but eventually I got to a point where I was having a slightly different knee problem.

27
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,480
Speaker 1: and Physical therapists, there's two different ways to go with that particular knee problem.

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:24,179
Speaker 1: It's the problem where like the front inner part of your knee or the top of the patella hurts and basically they either say You've got to put less pressure on your down strokes or in running do shorter strides because it's caused primarily by Stressing that upper part of the patella like the pressure of striking the ground or pushing hard with the pedal.

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:37,860
Speaker 1: so Mm-hmm, but it can also be caused if your muscles are imbalanced and that is often the case with people who cycle But don't do any other sports or people who run but don't do any other sports.

30
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:43,693
Speaker 1: basically anyone who does One very narrow type of sport is at risk for these kinds of knee issues.

31
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:50,520
Speaker 1: if you do that sport a lot because you'll over Develop the specific muscles that do those things and the rest of your muscles are weak.

32
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,049
Speaker 1: So eventually those muscles get too strong and start pulling.

33
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,197
Speaker 0: I don't understand how that happens cuz I'm pretty sure it's like.

34
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:58,108
Speaker 0: doesn't cycling use Every single leg.

35
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,657
Speaker 0: Oh, no, not even what other leg muscle is there.

36
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:07,240
Speaker 1: so I Solved this problem and I did talk to doctors like this was advice.

37
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:23,151
Speaker 1: But this advice and I got I cannot stress this enough does not apply to you or any random person Unless you talk to a doctor because this is only a concern for people who have extremely overdeveloped muscles, but basically Instead of slowing down or changing my biking because my form was good.

38
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:37,580
Speaker 1: I started running a lot more and Weight training a lot more I ramped up all the other leg Exercises I do and that actually made all my knee problems go away a hundred percent of them just gone.

39
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,276
Speaker 1: My knees just feel great all the time.

40
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:55,880
Speaker 1: so what happened to me when we did our century last weekend is The knee problem came back a little bit and I looked at my Strava history and I realized something I Was running the same amount I'd been running but I was actually biking a lot more than I had been previously.

41
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,800
Speaker 1: So it's not just bike a lot but also do some running.

42
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:07,080
Speaker 1: It's if I bike more I have to increase the other exercises by a proportionate amount or the problem will come back.

43
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:15,420
Speaker 1: so the experiment I did was Increasing my running while taking a break from biking and then starting the biking again.

44
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:18,637
Speaker 1: And so far it seems like increasing the running has made all problems go away.

45
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:29,636
Speaker 0: So I don't have any knee pains, but what I do have is this has been this way for Many years is you know, I'll wake up in the morning, right?

46
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:30,580
Speaker 0: I'll start biking.

47
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:45,897
Speaker 0: It's like when I first start biking like the immediate start like I'm rolling and rolling like less than a block distance Like my kneecaps will be like, oh we're doing something and they'll go like click click and they're like snap into place And then that's it.

48
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:53,120
Speaker 0: It's like if you know if I wake up and I didn't do anything Or even if like, you know, even if I start biking a little later than the early morning, right?

49
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,040
Speaker 0: It's like the start of biking.

50
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,980
Speaker 0: But you know, it's like my leg is like not in bike mode and then it like you can feel my knees are like what?

51
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:07,616
Speaker 0: Click There's a noticeable Clicking of some kind and then they're like, okay, you can bike forever.

52
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:08,139
Speaker 0: now, we're done.

53
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:12,476
Speaker 0: It's like there's some sort of mode shift or gear change in the knee zone.

54
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:18,395
Speaker 1: So it is Likely, but again, I would recommend you talk to a physical therapist or your doctor at some point.

55
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:19,018
Speaker 0: that doesn't hurt.

56
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:19,540
Speaker 0: It's not from.

57
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:35,081
Speaker 1: It could be causing a minor cartilage damage or joint damage before it clicks and It could potentially be prevented entirely if you cross-trained a little though I know you probably don't want to cross-train a little Hmm.

58
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,933
Speaker 0: I did find I think we talked about this last time right.

59
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:43,308
Speaker 0: the one exercise other than biking That's actually fun is jump rope.

60
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,863
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah jump also swimming, but swimming is a lot harder Oh my.

61
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:54,589
Speaker 1: so the other thing I noticed was I Just because between went we went to the shore for that private beach house And I also went to that lake house for a family thing.

62
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,440
Speaker 1: So I had two weeks of swimming almost every day.

63
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,354
Speaker 1: Oh Did that put me in like preternaturally a book like good shape?

64
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:06,540
Speaker 0: I but not if it's not like lap swimming.

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,088
Speaker 0: It's just you know hanging out in the water.

66
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:08,992
Speaker 1: No, I was swimming.

67
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,500
Speaker 1: you weren't hanging out with me in the water.

68
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,306
Speaker 1: I was swimming back and forth in the waves.

69
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,772
Speaker 1: Like I was doing laughs in the water.

70
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:15,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was.

71
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:20,509
Speaker 1: But I actually lost three pounds on that Wildwood trip.

72
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:24,280
Speaker 1: Hmm, and I think it was solely from all that swimming.

73
00:06:26,443 --> 00:06:29,769
Speaker 0: Anyway Got some anime something's hard to do you gotta.

74
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:30,511
Speaker 1: oh, yes.

75
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,774
Speaker 1: So the thing is I'll run 13 miles.

76
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:38,215
Speaker 1: No problem I'll bike a hundred miles and just be a little sore at the end swimming like 40 yards.

77
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:41,091
Speaker 0: I'm fucking done I well not that I'm talking about.

78
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,220
Speaker 0: you have to have money to swim.

79
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,142
Speaker 1: It's it's hard, but even if you have money swimming is just so much harder than any other exercise I do Like.

80
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:49,864
Speaker 1: as much.

81
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:54,820
Speaker 1: as athletic as I am I cannot swim that far effectively without being completely exhausted.

82
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,027
Speaker 0: I mean Olympic people don't swim that far either.

83
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:00,720
Speaker 0: No, it's like hundred meter five foot, you know, how many meters right?

84
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:01,262
Speaker 0: It's not.

85
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:03,933
Speaker 0: it's not like I swim 60 miles like I'm biking 60.

86
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,064
Speaker 0: Yeah What's the long.

87
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:10,540
Speaker 0: I don't know what the what's the longest swimming event in the Olympics in the Olympics?

88
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,637
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I had a boss who would swim the English Channel for fun like every now and then.

89
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,204
Speaker 0: yeah They do it slowly.

90
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:17,449
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, super slow.

91
00:07:17,489 --> 00:07:19,357
Speaker 1: Like he was really into like ocean swimming.

92
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:22,567
Speaker 0: marathon Swimming is only ten kilometers in open water.

93
00:07:22,828 --> 00:07:26,097
Speaker 1: Okay, that ten swimming ten kilometers terrifies me.

94
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:28,429
Speaker 1: running ten kilometers I wouldn't even break a sweat.

95
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:29,600
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

96
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,057
Speaker 0: Is that people in general even you know endurance long-distance swimming people don't swim that far.

97
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:40,570
Speaker 1: In fact, it takes me about 40 40 ish minutes to run ten kilometers.

98
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:41,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not.

99
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:44,840
Speaker 0: I mean that they would be like, you know How long is the fish walking race, right?

100
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:50,151
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like two inches and then you can who can flop right.

101
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,640
Speaker 0: flop flop flop flop flop and then yeah.

102
00:07:53,141 --> 00:08:03,460
Speaker 1: So in some animation anime news, I'll start with a geek bite on that Harley Quinn show Which I'm gonna say is fantastic, but with some caveats, it's not for everyone.

103
00:08:04,245 --> 00:08:05,292
Speaker 0: Which what is it on?

104
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:13,400
Speaker 1: Uh So I I must admit that I don't know because I am watching it on my NAS.

105
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:17,509
Speaker 1: Okay, and I click buttons and it appears on my NAS.

106
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,893
Speaker 1: Oh, it's on HBO max.

107
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:19,214
Speaker 1: Okay.

108
00:08:20,036 --> 00:08:21,320
Speaker 0: Oh, I have HBO max now.

109
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:26,160
Speaker 1: Oh, uh, so it looks like it was somewhere else but is officially moved to HBO max permanently.

110
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,829
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna can't?

111
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,820
Speaker 0: I'm gonna cancel Netflix soon ish.

112
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Speaker 0: But HBO max right now has the most stuff that I want to see and I want to watch the wizard city.

113
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:37,597
Speaker 0: So I just got it.

114
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:42,279
Speaker 0: You know Instead of canceling and then signing up I signed up and then I'll cancel like in a week.

115
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:50,895
Speaker 1: HBO max is honestly killing it in terms of getting the catalog of stuff that at least me and Scott Personally want to watch at least at this moment.

116
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:51,940
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'll burn.

117
00:08:52,702 --> 00:08:52,762
Speaker 0: The

118
00:08:52,802 --> 00:09:33,075
Speaker 1: problem is the cycle is Netflix has a bunch of stuff that I already finished and the further seasons of those things are not out yet Mmm, but Harley Quinn, I think you might actually like honestly like I think you might enjoy it What I would say having watched a whole bunch of it I've loved the entire first season which I won't spoil anything, but the difference between Harley Quinn then considered compared to say like betas as a superhero supervillain DC Universe show is That Harley Quinn surprised me at a lot of points by just killing a major character Making a radical change to the DC Universe just doing something nutso and then the next episode.

119
00:09:33,476 --> 00:09:34,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the universe.

120
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:40,614
Speaker 1: now It's just not so like Superman's gone, you know, it's some non Canon cartoons.

121
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:41,200
Speaker 0: they can just do it.

122
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,300
Speaker 1: That's what makes it good.

123
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:50,990
Speaker 1: The fact that this show doesn't give a shit about the Canon of the rest of DC is Actually, the only thing that made me like it.

124
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:56,256
Speaker 0: I think like that is though, you know, there's like, you know There's like 10 bajillion DC and Marvel things just like that.

125
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,080
Speaker 0: They do that all the time.

126
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,747
Speaker 0: Alternate that table steaks.

127
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,920
Speaker 1: what I like about this one is that it's it's learned.

128
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:14,480
Speaker 1: The show seems to have learned and informed itself from other Superhero or superhero adjacent things that were popular or that did well or that at least tickled my personal fancy.

129
00:10:15,063 --> 00:10:22,960
Speaker 1: I'm confident that the people who write this show are Extreme fans of the venture brothers because they seem to have used it as their style guide.

130
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,728
Speaker 0: You didn't even bother to look up who they were.

131
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:30,330
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm just talking about it from a perspective of What the show is like and whether or not you will like it.

132
00:10:30,872 --> 00:10:33,625
Speaker 1: are you the listener will like it because I want to a Review later.

133
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:41,018
Speaker 1: I'll do it with Emily if you don't ever watch it, but Basically, it's from the perspective of the villains like it's Harley Quinn.

134
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:41,520
Speaker 1: It's her show.

135
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,220
Speaker 1: She's the main character, but it's set as they're kind of just millennial dipshits doing their thing.

136
00:10:46,882 --> 00:10:48,951
Speaker 1: But they are still just super villains.

137
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,900
Speaker 1: and all the super villains are there in the universe.

138
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,472
Speaker 1: Like Lex Luthor is there Superman's just there.

139
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:54,899
Speaker 1: Batman shows up all the time.

140
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:06,259
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say it's a deconstruction because that is a term that a lot of weaves are Really misusing lately to the point that I almost don't want to use it for a while and hope they forget about it.

141
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:14,380
Speaker 1: But what it is is it it is making fun of the DC Universe more so than earnestly exploring the DC Universe.

142
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:26,007
Speaker 1: Yet by making fun of the DC Universe It is a more earnest exploration of these characters than most DC things have ever been in my opinion Caveat I don't like that many DC things.

143
00:11:26,068 --> 00:11:28,255
Speaker 1: So take that with a grain of salt if you're a DC fan.

144
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:36,680
Speaker 0: I Look up the people who made this show and there isn't too much interesting things about them and nothing they have credits for is interesting.

145
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:40,756
Speaker 1: So it does have an all-star voice acting cast and I will say that.

146
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:43,496
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah the voice actors I know I can see who they are, but I'm not like.

147
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:43,839
Speaker 0: I was like.

148
00:11:45,842 --> 00:11:46,163
Speaker 1: There was like.

149
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,070
Speaker 1: there was a character the first episode I was like.

150
00:11:48,692 --> 00:11:50,940
Speaker 1: that is that Jason fucking Alexander.

151
00:11:51,081 --> 00:12:01,620
Speaker 1: It was it was him it is and the funniest thing is it's basically him playing himself But it's him playing himself as in it's George Costanza as this character effectively.

152
00:12:02,362 --> 00:12:08,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, the person who wrote it is is Justin Halpern Patrick Schumacher and Dean Laurie.

153
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like.

154
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:13,566
Speaker 0: I look I click on Justin Halpern on Wikipedia and it's like, okay Who is Justin Halpern?

155
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:16,920
Speaker 0: a full-time writer for Maxim magazine online?

156
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:18,743
Speaker 0: It's like.

157
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:19,967
Speaker 1: well see that's why.

158
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:27,111
Speaker 0: so it's like show this show the way it's Completed the book shit My dad says the way it's like.

159
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:28,820
Speaker 0: and also a TV show named shit.

160
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,170
Speaker 0: My dad says it's like his second book.

161
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,280
Speaker 0: I suck at girls like who the hell is this guy?

162
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,781
Speaker 0: Why do I?

163
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:34,183
Speaker 1: so?

164
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:48,139
Speaker 1: the way that she was put together is that it's probably a lot more like The Simpsons in that the team is what made it and it's very hard to point at any one person who is responsible for Like the show being good or bad or whatever.

165
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:50,628
Speaker 1: Like there's a writer's room.

166
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:51,954
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of editors.

167
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,060
Speaker 1: I think the editors have a lot.

168
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:59,696
Speaker 0: It seems like it seemed if you look at the Wikipedia It's pretty much this guy and his two and his his friends his two friends wrote did.

169
00:12:59,817 --> 00:13:06,360
Speaker 1: most of the are pretty much Responsible for the show, but there's a team of four editors who as far as I can tell have a heavy influence on the show.

170
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:09,532
Speaker 1: But basically the voice acting is top-notch.

171
00:13:09,793 --> 00:13:11,299
Speaker 1: The show is extremely funny.

172
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:22,143
Speaker 1: It is true to the villains and it takes it does a lot and it really Breaks the rest of the DC Universe and it is a serial plot that just advances Like.

173
00:13:22,865 --> 00:13:27,180
Speaker 1: I really don't want to spoil anything other than there's a point where the bad guys win and then Gotham's just fucked.

174
00:13:27,961 --> 00:13:31,996
Speaker 1: Here's what Gotham's like if Batman's gone and Superman's gone and guess what?

175
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:32,980
Speaker 1: It sucks.

176
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,400
Speaker 1: Hey, I find this show funny enough to where I'm basically watching it as fast as I can.

177
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:40,970
Speaker 1: I really look forward to watching the third season.

178
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:57,670
Speaker 1: I've only watched the first two seasons so far and If you enjoy the venture brothers and you're worried that you won't get a lot more of it This is not as funny or good as the venture brothers But it is very much along the same lines Just not as polished as the venture brothers like.

179
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:08,064
Speaker 1: it's almost the same kind of story just using DC intellectual property instead of a homegrown intellectual property and the editing and the writing is just not as Polished as the venture brothers.

180
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:10,231
Speaker 1: So you need more venture brothers.

181
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:10,933
Speaker 1: This is your show.

182
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:17,650
Speaker 1: if you don't like the DC Universe this might be your DC show to watch and I really enjoy it.

183
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:29,378
Speaker 1: It is also full disclosure Extremely violence and the violence is juxtaposed by the fact that no one in the show Canonically cares at all about that violence.

184
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,125
Speaker 0: hmm Also, it's an HBO.

185
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,574
Speaker 0: So it has to either be violent or sexy or both.

186
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:36,076
Speaker 0: Right?

187
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:42,840
Speaker 0: Yep, or it has to be Which usually involves violent sex in both.

188
00:14:43,261 --> 00:14:44,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, but HBO do.

189
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,293
Speaker 1: it's also they like.

190
00:14:46,675 --> 00:14:52,199
Speaker 1: King Shark is not a character I ever expected to have anything interesting going on with and yet he's one of the best characters in this show.

191
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,030
Speaker 0: Well, that's the Suicide Squad.

192
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,775
Speaker 0: Yeah the shark.

193
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:55,359
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:59,728
Speaker 1: So in some other news There's more Lupin coming.

195
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:01,820
Speaker 1: I think we might have mentioned this briefly at some point.

196
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:19,105
Speaker 0: They seem to now be in this groove, you know where they're regular, you know It's like there was a few Lupin TV series and then there was a long break where there was just you know And specials here and there and then you know, there was the Fujiko Mina whatever but seems like you know recently ish And I had didn't look it up.

197
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,210
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly what year.

198
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,285
Speaker 0: it's probably longer ago than my memory tells me We should go.

199
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,200
Speaker 1: Mina came out when we were living in Beacon.

200
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:39,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but it's like it seems like you know in the past few years which again I'm not gonna try to guess what year because I'm probably gonna guess wrong and it's probably longer ago than I think.

201
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:41,140
Speaker 0: but they came out with Lupin series.

202
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:42,784
Speaker 0: Four five, I think.

203
00:15:42,824 --> 00:15:48,480
Speaker 0: four and I think there's a gap between three and four was like very large in years wise.

204
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:54,660
Speaker 0: But since four, I think it's like four five six is the new one six, I think or seven.

205
00:15:54,902 --> 00:15:58,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lupin the third part six six.

206
00:15:58,805 --> 00:16:11,952
Speaker 0: so I think it's like four or five six, they're like boom boom boom and I haven't seen them but all the indications are that they're all you know High-level well, very good Lupin pretty much of them.

207
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:15,537
Speaker 0: every once I just have to figure out where they are So I can watch them.

208
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,087
Speaker 1: I probably will starting with would you go Mina?

209
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:26,137
Speaker 1: pretty much every Lupin thing that's come out since then has been a top-tier Lupin and a top-tier just animated thing.

210
00:16:26,197 --> 00:16:26,700
Speaker 1: to be honest.

211
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:36,355
Speaker 0: It feels like there was some sort of turning point where like the loop someone was looking at the Lupin status quo and they're like Okay, Lupin is just sort of in this rut of doing his thing over and over right?

212
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,800
Speaker 0: Let's we got a choice.

213
00:16:37,861 --> 00:16:45,637
Speaker 0: We can either put a kid put a sock in it be like, all right That's enough or we can you know Give it another go and it seems like they gave it another go and it's working out and they're just.

214
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:51,339
Speaker 0: you know We're right like you're a Lupin fan Fueled the Lupin and it's still going at full speed.

215
00:16:51,641 --> 00:17:04,064
Speaker 1: But the other thing interesting now I just got clear because I see him credited as a writer but also as a guest writer like it's not and maybe as a producer role, but Mamoru she is.

216
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:07,755
Speaker 1: this is attached to Lupin the third part six in this article.

217
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:09,419
Speaker 1: He is credited as a writer.

218
00:17:10,642 --> 00:17:12,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think he's working on it to some extent.

219
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,295
Speaker 1: Yep, but okay.

220
00:17:14,335 --> 00:17:15,520
Speaker 1: He is a guest writer.

221
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,688
Speaker 1: It looks like there's some other guest writers.

222
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,940
Speaker 1: So like there's a mystery novelist who's popular?

223
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,132
Speaker 0: Taku Ashibi there might be one episode per person.

224
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:27,183
Speaker 1: kind of deal might be something like that, which honestly Intrigues me.

225
00:17:27,284 --> 00:17:27,987
Speaker 1: that's exciting.

226
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:31,340
Speaker 0: do a little do a little upon anthology series in season six here.

227
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:39,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a note in this anime news network article that oh, she was at some point in the past involved in a Unnamed Lupin the third film.

228
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,154
Speaker 1: that never like it never got made.

229
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,519
Speaker 1: It just got canned for some reason.

230
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:46,859
Speaker 1: and The thing I'm most excited about is if oh, she's doing anything.

231
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:56,654
Speaker 1: in my personal opinion everything oh, she is interacted with this animated has been good and everything goes Well.

232
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:02,127
Speaker 1: At least has been interesting to me.

233
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:12,105
Speaker 1: anything he's been associated with that has been live-action has been a fart noise generally, I Don't know what he's done.

234
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:14,055
Speaker 1: recently I kind of ignored him for several.

235
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:15,020
Speaker 0: Oh, she is not.

236
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:22,512
Speaker 0: Oh, she is interesting in that he is not someone who's like You know putting out solid gold every season out.

237
00:18:22,552 --> 00:18:24,540
Speaker 0: that is not the hand of Midas, right?

238
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,208
Speaker 0: The Midas touch where it's like everything he produces amazing.

239
00:18:27,749 --> 00:18:30,437
Speaker 0: He has this touch where everything he produces is Mamoru.

240
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:32,918
Speaker 0: She's yeah I think you can tell that he made it

241
00:18:34,942 --> 00:18:36,026
Speaker 1: That I thought

242
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:51,913
Speaker 0: even if he makes something that's a stinker right which is not infrequent You watch it and if you like the Mamoru Oh, she flavor It's sort of like Okay, this isn't great, but I can still taste the Mamoru.

243
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:52,756
Speaker 0: Oh, she spice.

244
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,920
Speaker 0: How often can you taste that?

245
00:18:54,021 --> 00:18:54,968
Speaker 0: I like that spice.

246
00:18:55,613 --> 00:19:02,520
Speaker 0: up to a point Yeah, but you took that spice and just slapped it on a sad piece of chicken breast or whatever.

247
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the thing he was like, I don't know.

248
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:09,580
Speaker 1: the stuff He was best at were old animated shows in my opinion.

249
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:11,226
Speaker 0: But again, he does.

250
00:19:11,266 --> 00:19:14,699
Speaker 0: I think he he has this thing where he just doesn't want to.

251
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,480
Speaker 1: You know, you look at someone like you like if guy Richie was like, you know, what?

252
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,009
Speaker 1: I don't really like making heist movies.

253
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,995
Speaker 1: I'm gonna make a right.

254
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:21,800
Speaker 1: I'm all rom-coms.

255
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:23,124
Speaker 0: You see certain people.

256
00:19:23,165 --> 00:19:30,636
Speaker 0: they have a thing that they're good at and it's like they just keep doing that thing and people are like Hey, you're so one-note and it's like I'm really good at playing that note.

257
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:31,380
Speaker 0: It's making me money.

258
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,123
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

259
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:33,108
Speaker 0: and you look at Mamoru.

260
00:19:33,168 --> 00:19:35,980
Speaker 0: Oh, she and it's like ghost in the shell Pat LeBourg.

261
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,666
Speaker 0: It's like whoa, just make like a hunt.

262
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:40,196
Speaker 0: make make more of those until the end of time, please.

263
00:19:40,216 --> 00:19:42,564
Speaker 0: and he's like nah That's I'm tired of that.

264
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,953
Speaker 0: It's like no just make ten more Pat LeBourg's please.

265
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:47,678
Speaker 0: That's all the kind of anime.

266
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:48,160
Speaker 0: I want to see.

267
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:53,839
Speaker 0: Oh, I promise if you make more I won't watch any other anime, so I'll just watch only those.

268
00:19:55,082 --> 00:19:55,828
Speaker 0: No, I wasn't do it.

269
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,180
Speaker 0: He goes and make some other nonsense.

270
00:19:57,244 --> 00:20:04,974
Speaker 1: Yeah So basically your takeaway is if you haven't been watching Lupin stuff since before the the Fujiko mean a show me Help me figure out where we can watch.

271
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:08,130
Speaker 0: Yeah My thing is a funimation.

272
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,220
Speaker 1: Maybe I mean the last Lupin thing We both watched and reviewed on geek nights was the 3d CG one, which was also fantastic.

273
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:16,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty good that was.

274
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,873
Speaker 1: that was a. that was an upper-tier Lupin Irrespective of how it was made or anything else around it and I did enjoy that.

275
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:30,821
Speaker 1: it got it aged into Lupin lore a little bit, but it didn't take it too far Lupin.

276
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:34,812
Speaker 0: the third part for English dub is on Prime.

277
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:37,038
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's a sub though.

278
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:44,935
Speaker 1: Nah And in some other news the of the final with a big asterisk next to it.

279
00:20:44,996 --> 00:20:49,748
Speaker 1: adventure time or at least the final Adventure time distant lands wizard city did come out.

280
00:20:49,808 --> 00:20:52,275
Speaker 0: there might be more distant lands, but this is the final.

281
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:53,318
Speaker 0: I'd already announced.

282
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,880
Speaker 1: distant lands Yeah, and there's that Fiona and cake thing come.

283
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:07,319
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure as I posited way back that they might just trickle out adventure time content forever As well, I mean as long as people still watch it and care about it.

284
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,432
Speaker 0: Yes They'll still keep making it to some extent.

285
00:21:09,493 --> 00:21:10,640
Speaker 0: But yeah, I watch the wizard city.

286
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:23,400
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say anything about the wizard city, except something happens in it that made me Specifically very won't upset other people necessarily, but it made me specifically very very upset and unhappy.

287
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:27,294
Speaker 0: But then do not miss the post credit scene.

288
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:30,949
Speaker 0: There is a very brief We're talking seconds long, right?

289
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:31,873
Speaker 0: Just a few seconds.

290
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,319
Speaker 0: post credit scene.

291
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,329
Speaker 0: essential post credit scene redeemed Redeemed all and erased all unhappiness.

292
00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:43,240
Speaker 1: So that's like the opposite of the alien 9. post credit scene.

293
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:45,453
Speaker 0: Do not miss the post credit scene.

294
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:49,159
Speaker 0: It is Maybe even the best part of the wizard city.

295
00:21:51,942 --> 00:22:01,419
Speaker 1: I'm just glad that they in the show like in the universe of adventure time Tried to do everything they could to let peppermint butler become what he was before the thing happened.

296
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,392
Speaker 1: Mmm, I like that just as a character note on the over.

297
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:06,813
Speaker 0: watch it.

298
00:22:07,054 --> 00:22:07,937
Speaker 1: No, I didn't watch it yet.

299
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:08,739
Speaker 1: Okay?

300
00:22:09,981 --> 00:22:11,908
Speaker 0: Well, you should watch it before you say things like that.

301
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:14,800
Speaker 1: Ah, I mean sending him to wizard school.

302
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,242
Speaker 1: That's just.

303
00:22:15,282 --> 00:22:17,732
Speaker 1: that's as good as you're gonna do in terms of you should.

304
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:19,539
Speaker 0: you should watch it before you say things like.

305
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,327
Speaker 0: that Is all I'm saying.

306
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:21,400
Speaker 0: cuz you're way off.

307
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:30,520
Speaker 0: I was I was thinking the same thing you were thinking when I read the description, but the nature of peppermint butler's Status is not what you were thinking.

308
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,260
Speaker 0: It is which is I I thought the same as you based on the how he ended up the last time we saw him.

309
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:42,830
Speaker 0: But our thinking was wrong or at least they made our thinking wrong With what they have done in wizard city.

310
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,559
Speaker 1: So interesting that imply anyway.

311
00:22:45,141 --> 00:22:49,795
Speaker 1: Well, we'll review it fully probably after we review those Evangelion movies now that they're all out.

312
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:50,718
Speaker 0: Yep.

313
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:51,380
Speaker 0: I saw them all.

314
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,352
Speaker 1: Yep, all I've seen all of them pretty.

315
00:22:53,392 --> 00:22:54,599
Speaker 0: maybe I'll watch them all again.

316
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:58,159
Speaker 1: I I have an urge to watch the original show again.

317
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:02,180
Speaker 1: That's one of them the shows I've seen the most times of any anime show.

318
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,083
Speaker 0: Well, you should.

319
00:23:03,184 --> 00:23:06,236
Speaker 0: I would recommend if you're gonna do that nothing wrong with doing that.

320
00:23:06,316 --> 00:23:13,040
Speaker 0: I might do that too, but The Movies the rebuild movies, right?

321
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,980
Speaker 0: Regardless of how good that even if they whether you think they stink or whether you think they're better than the TV show doesn't matter.

322
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:33,612
Speaker 0: In my opinion one interesting feature of them is that by their existence they original TV show is better Because these rebuild things just I just are there.

323
00:23:34,094 --> 00:23:43,549
Speaker 0: so you should watch them first Because then when you if you go back and watch the TV show again It will just be better than it was the last time you saw it.

324
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:53,370
Speaker 1: Thing is that that original event I still remember the first time I saw the original Evangelion and I stand by it being one of the best animated things ever made.

325
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,829
Speaker 0: Well, it'll be even better if you watch the rebuild movies Even if you hate them.

326
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:03,965
Speaker 0: even if you hate the rebuild movies if you just watch them and then go back to the TV show the TV show will be better than otherwise be.

327
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:15,561
Speaker 1: So in one little brief news We knew from Ken and from basically what anyone who has seen this movie has said so far That Bell Mamoru hosted his latest stuff.

328
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,450
Speaker 1: Opus is gonna be fantastic.

329
00:24:17,872 --> 00:24:19,979
Speaker 1: But we have yet another piece of evidence gonna be.

330
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,421
Speaker 0: it's out.

331
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:22,850
Speaker 1: So it is is yes, but we have not seen it yet.

332
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:27,470
Speaker 1: No, it's not clear when or how we'll see it since I don't think we're going to theaters anytime soon.

333
00:24:27,651 --> 00:24:29,279
Speaker 0: It's gonna be in theaters here soon.

334
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:38,350
Speaker 0: I think tickets went on sale maybe today even To go see it at the Walter Reed theater, which is where we last saw Satoshi khan in person over by Lincoln Center.

335
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:44,550
Speaker 0: but Yeah, I'm not gonna go to some movie theater and risk my life for a movie no matter how good the movie is.

336
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:45,996
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna die to see it.

337
00:24:46,076 --> 00:24:46,538
Speaker 0: Literally.

338
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, right only metaphorically am I dying to see it?

339
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,735
Speaker 1: So so it's been.

340
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,290
Speaker 0: we're gonna have to wait until it is safe to see it in a theater or at home.

341
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:59,744
Speaker 1: So it's been in Japanese theaters for eight weeks now and yep in its eighth week.

342
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:01,870
Speaker 1: It is still the number two movie.

343
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:03,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's not like.

344
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,169
Speaker 0: I don't know what movies have come along to try to unseat it.

345
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:11,225
Speaker 0: But you know still being the number two movie after eight weeks is pretty, you know significant.

346
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:14,038
Speaker 1: that's not common Generally granted.

347
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:26,846
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot about how Jeff like To see if it's getting up there, you know in terms of like your name levels of Because last I looked at stats for American theaters generally American.

348
00:25:26,906 --> 00:25:30,828
Speaker 1: in America movies Disappear after a couple weeks like even if they're great.

349
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I think your name is basically the current like bar.

350
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,966
Speaker 0: right for an anime movie in Japan.

351
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:38,049
Speaker 0: that you're the high bar.

352
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,889
Speaker 0: I don't you see how close it gets to that bar to judge.

353
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,337
Speaker 0: You know how well it's doing.

354
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:45,804
Speaker 0: spirited away was the previous bar, but your name broke it.

355
00:25:45,824 --> 00:25:50,215
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I am Very excited to see that movie.

356
00:25:50,255 --> 00:26:00,334
Speaker 0: However, and whenever I see it, but not gonna and also, you know not having seen Belle Obviously, but having seen your name and knowing what I know about Belle I think I will.

357
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:07,990
Speaker 0: my guess is that I will like Belle more than your name Regardless of whether Belle beats it out at the box office at some point in the future.

358
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,487
Speaker 1: So some other little news.

359
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,610
Speaker 1: Keiichi Ararai has What a new manga coming, right?

360
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:24,918
Speaker 0: so Keiichi Ararai is the person who brought us Nichijou and Helvetica standard and the two mangas that come.

361
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:35,390
Speaker 0: yeah those two mangas combined made the Nichijou TV show and Then we did an episode on the manga city, which I'm still reading and I only ever read the first volume.

362
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,061
Speaker 1: I should borrow that from you and read the rest.

363
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,470
Speaker 0: city is almost done.

364
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,580
Speaker 0: I think it is done, but there's 13 volumes.

365
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,604
Speaker 0: I have 11 of them.

366
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:44,390
Speaker 0: So I'm waiting for two more maybe.

367
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:47,045
Speaker 0: And that's the end of city like it's gonna end.

368
00:26:47,145 --> 00:26:47,246
Speaker 0: end.

369
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:53,450
Speaker 0: And they put out a mysterious announcement, which is not so mysterious.

370
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:59,855
Speaker 0: It's clearly the new manga that is being started by Keiichi Ararai coming very soon But we know nothing about it.

371
00:26:59,915 --> 00:27:00,477
Speaker 0: Other than that.

372
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:02,182
Speaker 0: Yes, they're making a new manga.

373
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:04,228
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna be all over that.

374
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:14,871
Speaker 0: So hey Your eyeballs on the comic order form for the remaining volumes of city in English and the first volume of whatever the hell's coming Next

375
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,628
Speaker 1: kind of figure out where I can watch Nichijou cuz it hasn't been on crunchyroll for a long time and I can't actually

376
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:23,853
Speaker 0: find animation Pirate Bay.

377
00:27:24,254 --> 00:27:24,815
Speaker 1: I just googled.

378
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,018
Speaker 1: Where can I watch Nichijou?

379
00:27:26,118 --> 00:27:26,619
Speaker 1: legally?

380
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:32,579
Speaker 1: and Crunchyroll is still the top result despite the fact that it has been on crunchyroll for years.

381
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:38,068
Speaker 0: Streaming is what I'm gonna type in Nichijou my ordinary life watch on crunchyroll.

382
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:39,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not there.

383
00:27:39,752 --> 00:27:41,296
Speaker 1: obvious might be on Funimation.

384
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:42,720
Speaker 0: where to watch Nichijou?

385
00:27:42,921 --> 00:27:43,771
Speaker 1: It's on Funimation.

386
00:27:43,791 --> 00:27:44,358
Speaker 1: I found it there.

387
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:48,019
Speaker 1: Okay, you gotta pay for the premium Funimation to watch it.

388
00:27:49,181 --> 00:27:49,502
Speaker 0: Okay.

389
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:50,163
Speaker 1: All right.

390
00:27:50,203 --> 00:27:50,624
Speaker 1: There we go.

391
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,526
Speaker 1: But anyway things Of the day.

392
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:14,100
Speaker 1: so, uh, this is a very short Twitter video but it is just someone used a deep fake algorithm to Replace an actor in the famous movie pretty woman with Willem Dafoe instead.

393
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:27,160
Speaker 1: It's not the character you expected to be and or maybe it is I mean I assume if you if you know me then you a hundred percent assume that this is replacing Julia Roberts and not Richard Gere like.

394
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,216
Speaker 1: But this movie not worth watching in a modern era.

395
00:28:32,236 --> 00:28:33,180
Speaker 1: a lot of problems in it.

396
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,754
Speaker 1: I would say I haven't seen it since I was in like high school.

397
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:36,900
Speaker 0: I never saw it.

398
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,386
Speaker 0: I just but you couldn't not know.

399
00:28:38,446 --> 00:28:41,538
Speaker 1: it existed in 1990 when I was a little kid like in the 90s.

400
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,713
Speaker 1: the one thing I took away from this movie was why is George Costanza in it?

401
00:28:46,074 --> 00:28:47,660
Speaker 0: because I didn't even know he was in it.

402
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,243
Speaker 0: Cuz I never saw.

403
00:28:48,264 --> 00:28:55,735
Speaker 1: I only ever saw the poster and I knew the song Alexander in anything except Seinfeld and duck man up to that point.

404
00:28:56,537 --> 00:29:04,736
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but You know, it's like I. you couldn't escape knowing that the movie existed, but I never saw it Not even I think even parts of it.

405
00:29:05,402 --> 00:29:07,419
Speaker 0: So I can't even tell you one scene.

406
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:11,500
Speaker 0: But this I assume the two I assume the two famous people kiss the end.

407
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:20,700
Speaker 1: Replacing an actor with another actor via deep fakes is a what I would consider a fully approved use case for deep fake technology.

408
00:29:21,444 --> 00:29:22,781
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we see you know This is the.

409
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:24,608
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's been done before.

410
00:29:24,728 --> 00:29:32,278
Speaker 0: but this is the first time that I've actually heard of Verified instance of someone going through and doing the whole fucking movie, right?

411
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:35,110
Speaker 1: It's like usually Actually do the entire movie.

412
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,659
Speaker 1: They did a bunch of scenes together.

413
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:45,960
Speaker 0: Okay, well the whole movie would probably Honestly, this is enough because I was gonna say I was like, oh someone did the whole movie why that's sort of unnecessary.

414
00:29:46,141 --> 00:29:47,388
Speaker 0: No one's actually gonna watch that.

415
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:50,544
Speaker 0: you can get your point across with just a few scenes Right, I guess.

416
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:51,990
Speaker 0: Okay, they did just to do a few.

417
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:56,448
Speaker 1: see I feel like if they did the whole movie I might watch it, but that's me.

418
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:58,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, why I'm MV.

419
00:29:58,675 --> 00:30:00,000
Speaker 0: Did they do you think the voice also?

420
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,700
Speaker 1: No, it's just really Roberts voice which actually works and makes it funnier.

421
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:07,660
Speaker 0: It could work, but it would also be funnier to to do the voice.

422
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:12,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it would be equally funny but differently funny if it was also Willem Dafoe's voice.

423
00:30:13,722 --> 00:30:14,799
Speaker 1: Mmm, somebody got.

424
00:30:16,762 --> 00:30:22,760
Speaker 0: So, yeah, you know everyone these days, you know, even though I guess it's it's already out of style.

425
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:28,040
Speaker 0: Right given the rate at which you know fashion and music trendiness moves.

426
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:37,486
Speaker 0: You know, we love that vaporwave type style and that vaporwave type style is usually embodied in 90s computer interfaces.

427
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:46,320
Speaker 0: Yeah and VHS and cassette tapes right and the art style they're upon.

428
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:49,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, so here's a website that I didn't know about.

429
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:50,060
Speaker 0: I don't know how old it is.

430
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,300
Speaker 0: It could be really old and I just didn't discover it till recently or maybe this possible.

431
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:55,910
Speaker 0: This is a thing of the day so long ago.

432
00:30:55,951 --> 00:31:17,660
Speaker 0: I don't remember but it's tape deck org and all it is is a website that collects JPEGs of blank cassette tapes Of all brands, you know makes models so that you can peruse them Right and you can search by brand running time the material of the tape and color.

433
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,487
Speaker 0: Alright, and you can.

434
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,600
Speaker 0: maybe there was a particular kind of tape that you had.

435
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:32,198
Speaker 0: I learned from this that the blank cassette tapes that I had were Sony HF 90s with the yellow red orange Stripe on the sticker that were clear and see-through.

436
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:39,639
Speaker 0: And also I learned that the most stylish possible cassette tape is the Memorex DBS.

437
00:31:40,443 --> 00:31:41,448
Speaker 0: So and you can just go in.

438
00:31:41,469 --> 00:31:43,620
Speaker 0: you know cassette tapes are not like rare even blank ones.

439
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,592
Speaker 0: You can just go on eBay and buy some you know cassette tapes if you want.

440
00:31:46,632 --> 00:31:48,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's far from complete.

441
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:54,320
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things missing from this still like Obviously because there's a lot of different cassettes out there.

442
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,479
Speaker 0: There's a lot but if you have some you can submit them.

443
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,071
Speaker 0: If there's any that you didn't you know don't have any sure.

444
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,080
Speaker 1: I got rid of every cassette tape I ever owned.

445
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,028
Speaker 0: I don't think I have any left anywhere.

446
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:14,500
Speaker 0: Not least not here, but if you For some reason want to be nostalgic and use cassette tapes There are still some record labels producing them in limited quantities for new releases and things like that.

447
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,446
Speaker 1: You can also just make your own.

448
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,810
Speaker 1: just record whatever you want.

449
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:18,773
Speaker 1: on to cassettes.

450
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can buy some blank ones on eBay.

451
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,391
Speaker 0: I looked on eBay for the Memorex DBS ones that look better.

452
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:28,818
Speaker 0: the cooler the high the good styling ones Yeah, and there was like it was like three pack completely sealed 12 bucks.

453
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,167
Speaker 1: They're like whatever plus late-stage like the like once you got the the fancy metal tapes like the good tapes at the end of the run of cassettes.

454
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:44,017
Speaker 1: they are So much better than even the best possible vinyl, and yeah, they're about CD quality.

455
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:48,491
Speaker 0: actually yeah They're not they're not bad But you know based on how I don't know if they denature over time.

456
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,539
Speaker 0: even if they're blank or anything they definitely do.

457
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:56,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing I want to warn people of is that if you're gonna get a kiss you got to get a cassette player.

458
00:32:57,402 --> 00:33:00,311
Speaker 0: You got to make sure your heads on the cassette player are clean.

459
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:02,357
Speaker 0: all right that everything's all you that you're.

460
00:33:02,417 --> 00:33:06,630
Speaker 0: you know everything's well Lubricated so it spins at the right speed of the motor and everything.

461
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:12,650
Speaker 1: you also have to make sure your cassette deck supports the specific Formulation of the tape you're using.

462
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:24,815
Speaker 0: there's different types of cassettes And the most important thing if you're gonna get into cassette tape usage for some nostalgic reason Doby and our noise reduction is an essential feature.

463
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:32,040
Speaker 0: you need to make sure Right that all you have all those ducks in a row regarding noise reduction or else it just gonna sell garbage.

464
00:33:32,381 --> 00:33:33,426
Speaker 1: It's a little more complicated.

465
00:33:33,466 --> 00:33:40,560
Speaker 1: you had the tape has a particular kind of noise reduction And then the deck has a way to use that noise reduction if those are not.

466
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,825
Speaker 0: What I'm saying though is a lot.

467
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:48,251
Speaker 0: if you go out and try to buy like a tape deck these days a lot of them just like don't have the Dolby noise reduction.

468
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:53,229
Speaker 0: that is the most common and standard noise reduction and Everything's gonna sound like ass.

469
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:53,873
Speaker 0: you want to buy.

470
00:33:53,913 --> 00:33:54,839
Speaker 0: maybe buy an old one.

471
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:59,853
Speaker 0: If you can't like buy like a really high quality one That's old like the same thing I do for cameras.

472
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,739
Speaker 0: right we're like I buy.

473
00:34:01,242 --> 00:34:12,335
Speaker 0: You know the most like what camera was an absolute fucking professional using in 1990. it's like yeah, it's a really old film camera, but guess what it was top of the line then.

474
00:34:12,757 --> 00:34:14,684
Speaker 0: so it's still really good I'm gonna link to.

475
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:30,639
Speaker 0: I'll put a third thing of the day in there instead of buying a Shitty cassette deck made in the year 2021 going by like the ultra rich person hi-fi cassette deck from 1990 when Pretty Woman was in movie theaters, and that'll be way better.

476
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:37,080
Speaker 1: So I'll link to a third thing of the day that might be relevant if this peaked your fancy.

477
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,380
Speaker 1: It's a techmoan video.

478
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:48,491
Speaker 1: I don't use them as in the day because I've used them much in the past but this is about a half hour long and it will tell you the full deal on all the different kinds of tapes and the Dolby and everything.

479
00:34:48,612 --> 00:34:55,840
Speaker 1: and if you watch this video You will know More than you need to know about tapes and you will be able to do whatever you want to do with tapes with no problems.

480
00:34:56,281 --> 00:34:58,408
Speaker 0: This video is much like much like vinyl.

481
00:34:58,508 --> 00:35:02,620
Speaker 0: don't go down the tape road because you think it's gonna sound better because it's not.

482
00:35:02,821 --> 00:35:03,805
Speaker 0: It's just for fun.

483
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:07,500
Speaker 0: That's the reason to go down the tape road and also the aesthetics of the tape are cool.

484
00:35:08,002 --> 00:35:09,167
Speaker 1: So all right.

485
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:12,520
Speaker 1: so in the meta moment the geeks book club book is the tale of Genji.

486
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,266
Speaker 1: I have not read.

487
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,582
Speaker 1: I read some yesterday Oh, I didn't read any in the last week, but I did read a bunch up until the previous geek nights Mmm.

488
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:21,166
Speaker 1: Yep.

489
00:35:21,227 --> 00:35:25,839
Speaker 0: It's the first novel read it the first novel ever in the history of humans.

490
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:28,510
Speaker 1: So, uh, it's pretty good.

491
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:30,200
Speaker 1: I said this a bunch of times.

492
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,938
Speaker 1: I'll just say it one more time if you're reading it with us We're gonna finish it in the next month or two because we're actually reading it now.

493
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:46,894
Speaker 1: but do not like try to get too precious about knowing exactly what happened and Exactly who everyone is and when we actually have an episode on this.

494
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:52,214
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say so much stuff That's like, you know, oh that is gonna be so many realizations and wrongnesses.

495
00:35:52,314 --> 00:35:53,398
Speaker 0: It's gonna be like, yeah.

496
00:35:53,458 --> 00:36:01,960
Speaker 1: Oh my god I I usually frame things by like Who is what kind of person was Genji trying to have sex with in that chapter?

497
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,789
Speaker 1: And that is how I remember like what that chapter was.

498
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,535
Speaker 0: Oh that person from that chapter.

499
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:07,860
Speaker 0: was that person from a different show?

500
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,382
Speaker 1: I lose track.

501
00:36:08,422 --> 00:36:12,075
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the say I booked the book now calls them something different.

502
00:36:12,196 --> 00:36:13,159
Speaker 1: that I'm pretty sure.

503
00:36:14,457 --> 00:36:18,560
Speaker 1: I Am thinking that the same person is multiple people in a few of these instances.

504
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:23,414
Speaker 0: Or yeah, or there's you know, yeah, but vice versa.

505
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,076
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

506
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:25,180
Speaker 1: I picked the next book club book.

507
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:26,571
Speaker 1: It'll probably be a pretty quick read.

508
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:27,639
Speaker 1: I'm pretty excited to read it.

509
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:37,494
Speaker 0: I am excited to make up when we are eventually done with this to make up for the debacle Which is partially pandemic induced debacle of taking several years to read one book.

510
00:36:38,075 --> 00:36:38,957
Speaker 0: I am going.

511
00:36:39,037 --> 00:36:40,020
Speaker 0: I've already decided.

512
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:52,197
Speaker 0: For the foreseeable future all Selected books will be of the nature that will end quickly Right the kind that you know will want to read and won't be that long and such.

513
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:56,162
Speaker 0: so yep Otherwise our let me one book in three years But then we'll.

514
00:36:56,563 --> 00:37:03,290
Speaker 0: basically what I'll do is I'll we'll read so many books so fast until the book rate Evens out again.

515
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:09,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Otherwise our most recent packs panel Atari game design is just on YouTube.

516
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:10,133
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

517
00:37:10,755 --> 00:37:12,400
Speaker 1: packs West happened this past weekend.

518
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:23,220
Speaker 1: We were not there, but as the listener pointed out in the last stream I at least have been to since 2008 every packs that Gabe has also been to.

519
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:31,680
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz he stopped going to the packs Australia's and he also didn't go to this one and he's done As a measuring stick for anything.

520
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:35,379
Speaker 1: Measuring stick for that one very specific metric.

521
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:39,071
Speaker 1: Beyond that check out our forum our live stream.

522
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:39,894
Speaker 1: There's a chat there.

523
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,520
Speaker 1: There's all this different stuff.

524
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:46,673
Speaker 1: just type geek nights into the internet, and you'll find all our crap and I'll get right into it with soups.

525
00:37:48,762 --> 00:37:53,670
Speaker 1: So full disclosure I'm not a big fan of really DC anything like.

526
00:37:54,252 --> 00:37:58,800
Speaker 1: I like Batman and Batman adjacent things And I appreciate Superman.

527
00:37:58,941 --> 00:38:12,992
Speaker 1: I've seen a bunch of Superman things much like Superman like spider-man is one of those characters that just Everyone like in America, everyone knows Superman's deal, even if they have never read a comic book in their life Just like everyone knows spider-man's deal.

528
00:38:13,013 --> 00:38:19,035
Speaker 0: I Think the thing with Superman is that the actual story of Superman, right?

529
00:38:19,356 --> 00:38:22,105
Speaker 0: It's a story of Immigration, right?

530
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:26,020
Speaker 0: It's a story of you know, even though he's a white dude, right?

531
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,004
Speaker 0: He's like an alien.

532
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,450
Speaker 0: come to earth, right?

533
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:35,533
Speaker 0: It's a story of you know You know like a guy who's you know, so powerful, right?

534
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,058
Speaker 0: It's like but yet is good, right?

535
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,595
Speaker 0: You get this are like this, you know benevolent God situation going on right?

536
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:44,464
Speaker 0: It's like there's so many angles You know.

537
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,500
Speaker 0: you could talk about them for like a hundred years, right?

538
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,555
Speaker 0: You could talk about the people, you know, Simon Schuster made Superman right.

539
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:50,580
Speaker 0: all this stuff going on.

540
00:38:52,776 --> 00:39:04,720
Speaker 0: But The actual most that I have read or watched Actual Superman media right end up not actually going down those roads.

541
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,227
Speaker 1: Yep, that is my main complaint with Superman is that most Superman stories don't tell the stories.

542
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:17,260
Speaker 1: I am interested in about an Individual very powerful person who wants to do good in a cruel and evil world.

543
00:39:18,262 --> 00:39:36,315
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, you know you see, you know, some of them do right, you know some of them do but it's like when I was a kid the Superman that I actually I think probably still to this day the Superman that I have consumed the most is That Lois and Clark Superman TV show because we my family watched that.

544
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:39,086
Speaker 0: it was on like 8 o'clock Like I forget what day.

545
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:39,890
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

546
00:39:39,951 --> 00:39:40,956
Speaker 1: We watched that too.

547
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:41,378
Speaker 1: I liked it.

548
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:46,480
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, I mean, I remember it being okay, but it was pretty much just.

549
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:56,189
Speaker 0: You know 90s TV level, you know Sikkami kind of show right?

550
00:39:56,289 --> 00:39:57,052
Speaker 0: It didn't dart.

551
00:39:57,092 --> 00:39:59,620
Speaker 0: It didn't dig deep on any plots, right?

552
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,051
Speaker 0: It was like, oh no, there's some danger.

553
00:40:02,071 --> 00:40:10,667
Speaker 1: He fights it Which to be fair like a lot of Batman media like even B test which I love was also like that.

554
00:40:10,687 --> 00:40:19,255
Speaker 1: it just had a lot of style and occasional very brilliant episodes and like Did more but it didn't really interrogate the Batman in the way that I like.

555
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:20,539
Speaker 1: the Batman interrogated, right?

556
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,943
Speaker 0: But eat that's true.

557
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:27,040
Speaker 0: But you know while the Batman has much to interrogate Superman has way more to interrogate.

558
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, anybody see I am a living God among humans.

559
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,845
Speaker 1: I hide my identity, but I'm still just one, dude I can't just fix the world.

560
00:40:36,546 --> 00:40:41,679
Speaker 0: this journalism aspect that goes on in Superman, right only so often gets explored.

561
00:40:43,486 --> 00:40:44,716
Speaker 0: You know just so much going on there.

562
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:55,172
Speaker 0: but when it does get explored right when there is a Take on Superman right that actually goes down those roads.

563
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:58,020
Speaker 0: It's like it's like so good, right?

564
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,682
Speaker 0: I mean we already.

565
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:03,780
Speaker 0: we've already did an episode super long ago about you know, Frank Miller's got his issues.

566
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,848
Speaker 0: But in the Dark Knight Returns, it's like there's like even though Superman is like this shiny You know sun is shining good guy.

567
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,240
Speaker 0: It's like there's like this absolute terror, right?

568
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:24,540
Speaker 0: It's almost like a Lovecraftian terror Like if Superman is coming because it's like it's like God is coming like you're gonna get Moses gonna see the fucking burning bush Yeah, holy shit.

569
00:41:24,601 --> 00:41:31,362
Speaker 0: And then it's just like, you know There's something going on and it's like you see how you see like a blur and like the bad guys are gone Right.

570
00:41:31,402 --> 00:41:32,085
Speaker 0: It's like the end.

571
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:33,793
Speaker 0: It's like he just took care of it like that.

572
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:35,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's none of that.

573
00:41:36,422 --> 00:41:37,005
Speaker 1: Plays with that.

574
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:37,970
Speaker 1: there's a couple episode.

575
00:41:37,991 --> 00:41:38,493
Speaker 1: We're like super.

576
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:44,354
Speaker 1: if Superman shows up It's just over like whatever was happening is over when Superman shows up.

577
00:41:45,117 --> 00:41:46,100
Speaker 0: That's how it's supposed to be.

578
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,702
Speaker 0: There are too many.

579
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:54,900
Speaker 0: you watch most Superman stuff like the old the super old public domain Superman cartoons and it's like, you know I guess that was when he couldn't even fly this way.

580
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,693
Speaker 0: He could only jump and stuff really high.

581
00:41:56,773 --> 00:42:04,780
Speaker 0: but he just you know He's punching out like bank robbers and mad scientists like it's like one punch to Superman and their head explodes, bro.

582
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,611
Speaker 0: It's like they never flies to the moon or some shit.

583
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:19,567
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't beat up dudes like spider-man does Right, it's it's led, you know Saitama level here right when you get involved with yeah You can't be punching other human beings.

584
00:42:19,888 --> 00:42:21,233
Speaker 0: They'll just indeed build their good.

585
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:22,818
Speaker 0: They'll be ribs all over the place.

586
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:27,410
Speaker 0: Yeah Rib tips or whatever.

587
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:32,545
Speaker 1: the other super that I actually saw way more of is the old black and white TV show because it was On late at night.

588
00:42:33,511 --> 00:42:34,216
Speaker 0: I never watched that.

589
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:49,379
Speaker 1: I watched a lot of that show and the only episode I have specific memories of because they were they were almost all almost every one of that old show like the episodes were just here's a very particular very zoomed in tiny problem that Superman is trying to solve.

590
00:42:49,399 --> 00:43:04,904
Speaker 1: and the one I remember is some dude committed some crime and He locked himself in an extremely like thick safe until the statute of limitations would run out and Superman couldn't get in.

591
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:06,769
Speaker 0: so man can get in.

592
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:07,351
Speaker 0: so that's no.

593
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,657
Speaker 1: so the plot was Superman couldn't get in.

594
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:12,888
Speaker 1: it was too much for even Superman to get in.

595
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,828
Speaker 1: so he learned some technique to Change the atoms in his own body.

596
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,737
Speaker 1: Thanks to his superpowers in the Sun to walk through walls.

597
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:29,379
Speaker 1: So he starts walking through the wall of this giant safe to get in to arrest this dude.

598
00:43:29,399 --> 00:43:36,082
Speaker 1: and The dude psychs him out by being like yeah, but what if you don't Rematerialize?

599
00:43:36,443 --> 00:43:38,252
Speaker 1: is this is real dangerous what you're doing.

600
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:43,609
Speaker 1: So Superman gives up and Superman then solves this problem with his.

601
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:45,435
Speaker 1: in that show massive intellect.

602
00:43:45,595 --> 00:43:45,956
Speaker 0: wouldn't.

603
00:43:46,017 --> 00:43:48,230
Speaker 0: wouldn't the guy Suffocate in the safe.

604
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:49,441
Speaker 1: Oh, he had a way to get air There.

605
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:49,943
Speaker 1: was they like they?

606
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:52,878
Speaker 1: this was this very much make just pump gas in there.

607
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:56,060
Speaker 1: Uh Superman wasn't evil enough to do something like that.

608
00:43:57,003 --> 00:43:58,649
Speaker 1: In the end they just fucked.

609
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,760
Speaker 1: they made the clock inside the safe move a little faster.

610
00:44:02,081 --> 00:44:05,678
Speaker 1: So he came out five minutes before the 20 years was up and then Superman just arrested him.

611
00:44:06,982 --> 00:44:07,687
Speaker 0: That's oh my god.

612
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:08,432
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

613
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:09,560
Speaker 1: That's what that show was like.

614
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:12,439
Speaker 0: That's awful.

615
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,585
Speaker 0: In some ways it's clear.

616
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:22,767
Speaker 0: in some ways it's clever right but in other ways it's like, you know That's the.

617
00:44:22,908 --> 00:44:24,380
Speaker 0: you got Superman right there.

618
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:27,030
Speaker 0: Don't need to miss the app you have and you what.

619
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,155
Speaker 0: Superman has nothing to do with that.

620
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:30,042
Speaker 0: if you saw it's an Indiana Jones Situation.

621
00:44:30,062 --> 00:44:30,323
Speaker 0: we're like.

622
00:44:30,685 --> 00:44:32,533
Speaker 0: he contributed nothing to the solution.

623
00:44:33,216 --> 00:44:38,490
Speaker 0: He came up with the idea See, I guess maybe there were.

624
00:44:38,872 --> 00:44:41,180
Speaker 1: there was another one where I remember he had to use this.

625
00:44:41,502 --> 00:44:45,387
Speaker 1: He had to use his heat vision to save the day but he was still Clark Kent.

626
00:44:45,788 --> 00:44:47,716
Speaker 1: so he couldn't do it because it would melt his glasses.

627
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:48,399
Speaker 1: every would know.

628
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:52,380
Speaker 1: and In the end his he almost solved everything with a clever idea.

629
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:00,550
Speaker 1: The clever idea was he removed the lenses from his frames to be able to do the thing without melting them though for the one Time he needed to do it the end.

630
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:00,992
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

631
00:45:01,595 --> 00:45:01,937
Speaker 0: Okay.

632
00:45:02,138 --> 00:45:03,945
Speaker 0: Yeah That's the other right.

633
00:45:03,965 --> 00:45:07,980
Speaker 0: So that's I think that's also, you know, where some of the corniness comes from right?

634
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,808
Speaker 0: It's like you have this good aspect of.

635
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:18,840
Speaker 0: you know, he was raised by humans Right and you had is that connection to humanity right parents even though they're not his real parents his biological parents.

636
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,253
Speaker 0: They're his real parents not biological right his biological parents and from whatever alien.

637
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:25,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, Krypton, whatever, right?

638
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,859
Speaker 0: So you have the adoption story, right?

639
00:45:29,361 --> 00:45:38,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, you get a found family story around that like the connections he makes cuz he doesn't have any biological family left anywhere in the Universe.

640
00:45:38,942 --> 00:45:39,385
Speaker 0: and I don't know.

641
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,319
Speaker 0: Clark Kent was the original secret identity, but it effectively set the the template for everyone else's secret identity who came later.

642
00:45:50,344 --> 00:45:52,818
Speaker 0: It was modeled after the Superman secret identity.

643
00:45:53,401 --> 00:46:05,849
Speaker 0: So and but the thing is that actual no matter how good an interpretation of Superman you're watching The secret identity part if it's in play because sometimes it's not in play if you're watching super friends It's like he's just always Superman.

644
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,648
Speaker 1: He doesn't or just no can't in that Can't off on his own and then separately.

645
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:16,352
Speaker 1: just he's in the Justice League base Just talking to people sometimes like he's just right.

646
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:20,285
Speaker 1: He's just one of the x-men effectively Yeah, it's like.

647
00:46:20,827 --> 00:46:23,099
Speaker 0: why do you even need the super friends if Superman is there?

648
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:25,794
Speaker 0: Why do you still have any of these twins?

649
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:26,500
Speaker 0: What are they contribute?

650
00:46:28,582 --> 00:46:29,125
Speaker 0: The flash.

651
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,413
Speaker 0: what's what's the point of the flash?

652
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:34,911
Speaker 0: Superman can go fast and He's like the Superman is the flash plus more things.

653
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:36,820
Speaker 0: Why do you why is the flash should just retire?

654
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:46,620
Speaker 1: I guess because of all those aspects like the wholesome nature like he grew up in a humble Family and he learned to connect with humans, but also he's a living God on this earth.

655
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:52,460
Speaker 1: But his powers are very limited within the bounds of like what other superheroes can do in the expanded DC Universe.

656
00:46:53,104 --> 00:46:59,968
Speaker 1: I like the stories where Superman is the only super thing Mmm, like or like like.

657
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:00,590
Speaker 1: imagine.

658
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:06,679
Speaker 1: Superman versus famine is a way more interesting story than Superman versus I don't know doomsday.

659
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:13,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean you think the number one Superman villain is Lex Luthor right who I don't know.

660
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:14,740
Speaker 0: I'll guess over time.

661
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,685
Speaker 0: You know if you read certain comics has superpowers, but at least nominally Lex lit the basic.

662
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:23,674
Speaker 0: Lex Luthor is Justin is just you know, Ellen Musk right?

663
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,460
Speaker 0: Ellen Musk is literally Lex Luthor.

664
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,208
Speaker 0: It's a rich dude who's up to no good.

665
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:32,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, just want you know, it's just evil, you know and runs a business.

666
00:47:32,722 --> 00:47:37,480
Speaker 0: So it's really, you know Superman versus you know industry and capitalism, right?

667
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:37,881
Speaker 0: That's the.

668
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:46,616
Speaker 0: and metaphorically the story there is really good But the way it plays off it's like if there was a Superman and those an Ellen Musk.

669
00:47:46,977 --> 00:47:49,129
Speaker 0: Superman could just The end.

670
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:49,532
Speaker 0: right.

671
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:50,297
Speaker 0: why it's like.

672
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:55,557
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, it took a while before the you know, Lex Luthor found out about kryptonite.

673
00:47:55,617 --> 00:48:00,474
Speaker 0: somehow Superman could just taken care of it at any time before that the end.

674
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:01,960
Speaker 0: Why did why did this happen?

675
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:03,385
Speaker 0: Makes no sense.

676
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:04,832
Speaker 0: It's just silly.

677
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:05,655
Speaker 0: so it was like this.

678
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:12,159
Speaker 0: these metaphors Right because of the structure of the story and the personality and whatnot.

679
00:48:13,001 --> 00:48:25,879
Speaker 0: The the good metaphors and the good stories told the Superman can't escape those sort of corny Ham-fisted plot holes and various things when they try to keep the story down to earth, right?

680
00:48:27,958 --> 00:48:32,466
Speaker 0: and So depending on which Superman you read a lot of times It's like, you know, it's.

681
00:48:32,646 --> 00:48:36,903
Speaker 0: it's hard to digest as someone with it with a brain from the year 2020.

682
00:48:36,903 --> 00:48:43,701
Speaker 1: There is well one of the later Superman cartoons one of the more recent ones there is that they do do a really good take on Lex Luthor and they cuz like.

683
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:52,676
Speaker 1: the long roundabout story is basically that Lex Luthor is so Fucked up in evil and Ellen Muskie that he cannot.

684
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:58,417
Speaker 1: his main thing Is that he thinks Superman is an evil threat and always.

685
00:48:58,437 --> 00:49:02,471
Speaker 0: that's always been true Similar to JJ and Jamison, y'all spider-man only.

686
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:06,279
Speaker 0: but JJ isn't actually evil He's just sort of like, you know.

687
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:08,847
Speaker 1: But that show resolves that like.

688
00:49:08,887 --> 00:49:20,919
Speaker 1: the big plot of that show is eventually something happens and Lex Luthor Gets Superman's powers for a little while and I think there's been some comics where you know, Luther gets magic or other.

689
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:23,528
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm pretty sure but I don't cry.

690
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:26,600
Speaker 0: sometimes he swears like sometimes he wears like some sort of you know mech suit.

691
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,433
Speaker 0: He's almost like an Iron Man situation, which is also very Ellen Muskie thing.

692
00:49:30,473 --> 00:49:35,217
Speaker 1: I don't like Batman I don't know which Superman thing.

693
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:35,640
Speaker 0: I don't know

694
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,831
Speaker 1: Because I've never read Superman comics

695
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:45,521
Speaker 0: but it's gonna be some, you know There's gonna be some listener who knows the real deal is gonna be like, oh my god, you're so wrong about this but I'll

696
00:49:45,541 --> 00:49:54,054
Speaker 1: link to it because there's really good scene where Lex Luthor like sees everything and realizes that Superman was actually earnestly a good guy.

697
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:59,835
Speaker 0: Hmm well there is you know, that's another good angle to put on Superman.

698
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:11,830
Speaker 0: that is not often put is Even though he's a good guy right if you believe in Democracy and you believe in you know human self-determination.

699
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,929
Speaker 0: Right Mistakes right.

700
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:25,340
Speaker 0: even if Superman exists Right even for him to do good is Still tyrannical, right?

701
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,337
Speaker 0: It's like there is no.

702
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:37,120
Speaker 0: It's like even if you have a government and you vote for a president and everyone's there's an army and the army obeys the president's Orders, it's like even a Superman is just chilling at home in Kansas.

703
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:42,700
Speaker 0: Everyone is effectively, you know in principle obeying Superman's orders.

704
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:47,680
Speaker 0: Right, because if you weren't obeying his orders, he could just take the army and throw into the Sun.

705
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:56,170
Speaker 0: So the fact that he doesn't do that or he hasn't done that means you are obeying him Even if he hasn't even opened his mouth, right just in principle.

706
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:59,500
Speaker 0: the fact that he right so by his existence.

707
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:02,224
Speaker 0: It's like there is no democracy There is no freedom.

708
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:09,439
Speaker 0: as long as he's just there as if he's standing there doing nothing You all your freedom is in principle lost.

709
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:14,372
Speaker 0: So if you believe in freedom, even if you trust Superman is a good person, you know.

710
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:28,160
Speaker 0: If you believe in freedom as a principle because you're a libertarian or something You therefore must advocate for his destruction or exile or something to keep him in check.

711
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,740
Speaker 0: You're not the government like like the president has to have kryptonite or something.

712
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:48,431
Speaker 1: Well, I see that if you are not some libertarian dipshit and you actually believe in a bork nuanced concept of freedom Then freedom from becomes equally important as to freedom to write and freedom from Lex Luthor Or freedom from poverty.

713
00:51:48,753 --> 00:52:00,465
Speaker 1: the Superman would be Morally justified in taking extreme actions to end poverty because unlike any human there is no consequence He could suffer and no risk He would have to take.

714
00:52:00,967 --> 00:52:05,940
Speaker 1: the risk would be to all the people around him or him making a poor decision But he's not risking anything himself.

715
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,103
Speaker 0: Yeah there.

716
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:12,480
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't read or heard of a Superman story where he does anything like that.

717
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:13,999
Speaker 0: It's like he's from a farm.

718
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,203
Speaker 0: It's like he could.

719
00:52:15,444 --> 00:52:20,316
Speaker 0: Superman could fly into space go to a planet where no one lives.

720
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:26,998
Speaker 0: That is it like arable Plant enough food for like everyone forever and personally deliver it and end all.

721
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:28,988
Speaker 0: and you know He could and you could see like, you know what?

722
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:30,879
Speaker 0: We don't need any more shipping boats or airplanes.

723
00:52:31,261 --> 00:52:32,910
Speaker 0: I'm going to personally ship everything.

724
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:34,619
Speaker 0: It'll take me five minutes every morning.

725
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:38,853
Speaker 0: Right to ship all goods on earth with no climate change consequences.

726
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,860
Speaker 0: No fossil fuels or anything, right?

727
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:45,775
Speaker 0: Everyone who needs anything shipped just put an order in the supercomputer and I'll do it tomorrow.

728
00:52:46,016 --> 00:52:46,778
Speaker 0: every you know at 9 a.m.

729
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,289
Speaker 0: Whatever right, but he never does anything fucking like that.

730
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,600
Speaker 0: All right, maybe someone wrote that story, but I haven't seen it.

731
00:52:53,680 --> 00:53:03,056
Speaker 0: But that's a far cry from the original Superman who could just jump really high and punch really hard Sure, but yeah, I guess I guess the flying Superman has to come into play for that.

732
00:53:03,076 --> 00:53:04,200
Speaker 0: The original Superman didn't fly.

733
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, there's there's a. the thing is the.

734
00:53:06,347 --> 00:53:10,380
Speaker 1: how powerful Superman is is a wide varies a lot.

735
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:17,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, it literally ranges from I can jump high and punch things - I'm a literal living God composed primarily of energy.

736
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:22,340
Speaker 0: at this point Well, I think you know at some points it's like in different stories different universes.

737
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:29,760
Speaker 0: His power is different and also within a single universe his power will wax and wane over course of events, right?

738
00:53:30,842 --> 00:53:34,400
Speaker 0: And it's also, you know the connect, you know, they'll always have some sort of explanation, right?

739
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,989
Speaker 0: It's like oh, he's got to be near the Sun.

740
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,497
Speaker 0: So he'll go to some other planet.

741
00:53:37,537 --> 00:53:38,040
Speaker 0: He'll be weaker.

742
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,267
Speaker 0: They're different.

743
00:53:39,308 --> 00:53:41,340
Speaker 1: so I guess he just has to be near any yellow Sun.

744
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,406
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them out there right.

745
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:44,718
Speaker 0: and then kryptonite which is just really corny.

746
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:48,035
Speaker 0: It's like he's near a particular rock.

747
00:53:48,075 --> 00:53:48,417
Speaker 0: Therefore.

748
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:48,820
Speaker 0: He's weak.

749
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,624
Speaker 0: It's like what it's.

750
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:52,880
Speaker 0: you know, I'm sure they explained how the kryptonite works at some point, but I don't care.

751
00:53:52,940 --> 00:54:00,480
Speaker 0: It's really, you know, I guess kryptonite became a coined term which in and of itself means like, you know a weakness.

752
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:04,558
Speaker 0: It's like you could be like, oh, that's my kryptonite and that's really my Contribution.

753
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:18,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good contribution to the lexicon of the English language, but as a plot device, it's like really it's like you just needed something Something gives like you couldn't think of anything else, you know, and it's stuck, right?

754
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,270
Speaker 0: It's still we're stuck with as Superman's.

755
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:29,579
Speaker 1: now the other kind of story I enjoy quite a bit is when they Superman is basically just a modern-day Herakles too powerful for his own good.

756
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:38,338
Speaker 1: and Even if he does if he does the right thing or the wrong thing The consequences of anything he does are just bigger than what a normal person would do.

757
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:49,178
Speaker 1: yet He is not powerful enough to always do the right thing or make a big change so that die like this if you haven't read all the stories of Herakles or Hercules?

758
00:54:49,298 --> 00:54:57,980
Speaker 1: if you're If you don't know what you're talking about He fucks up a lot and it's more a tragic story than a hero story.

759
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,700
Speaker 0: Well, yes, there's a lot of Superman story.

760
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,222
Speaker 0: I think it's just.

761
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:03,589
Speaker 0: that's just not Superman, but it's all.

762
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:10,079
Speaker 0: the superheroes have this sort of same story But Superman more so because his power level is greater.

763
00:55:10,622 --> 00:55:14,720
Speaker 0: All right, and you know, he came earlier in that it's like, okay, you're Superman.

764
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:18,095
Speaker 0: Someone's falling off a building the old classic right.

765
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,019
Speaker 0: Superman's gonna catch him.

766
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:25,447
Speaker 0: if Superman doesn't catch him then Isn't that equivalent?

767
00:55:25,487 --> 00:55:29,385
Speaker 0: Superman could have caught him at basically no cost Because you're Superman.

768
00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:37,513
Speaker 0: if Superman lets him at the ground or is too busy or whatever That's equivalent to Superman throwing them off the building, right?

769
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:38,216
Speaker 0: It's like you make.

770
00:55:38,236 --> 00:55:39,560
Speaker 0: you made that happen effectively.

771
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,740
Speaker 0: You could have stopped it and chose not to that edges into your trolley.

772
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,703
Speaker 0: Your power is.

773
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:45,548
Speaker 0: your power is so high.

774
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,677
Speaker 0: you were responsible for catching them and didn't right.

775
00:55:48,778 --> 00:56:02,972
Speaker 0: you killed, you know It's like and that moral, you know, Superman being a good person would feel right responsible for that You know and other superheroes would probably have the same thing When you have more so much more power, but

776
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:08,210
Speaker 1: if you want to explore that idea, that's literally just the trolley problem You're better off just watching The Good Place than a Superman story,

777
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:08,913
Speaker 0: right?

778
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:13,307
Speaker 0: But Superman, you know, so old Relative to the other superheroes, right?

779
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:13,890
Speaker 0: You got to remember.

780
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,560
Speaker 0: it's like there were the history of comics.

781
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:21,737
Speaker 0: It's like comics were romance stories horror stories, mostly Westerns, right some sci-fi stuff.

782
00:56:21,857 --> 00:56:32,080
Speaker 0: and then you get here Stuff Yeah, then you had you know, the comics code coming in and being like no no No, all this stuff is too inappropriate for the children's right?

783
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:41,233
Speaker 0: We can't be having that, you know cracking down in the comics and then it's like yeah There were superhero stories around but Superman action comics number one.

784
00:56:41,273 --> 00:56:43,940
Speaker 0: It's like when that come came out, right?

785
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,106
Speaker 0: That's like okay.

786
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:45,951
Speaker 0: We got something.

787
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:51,660
Speaker 0: it obeys the comics code It's appropriate for the children and it's a smash hit right, you know?

788
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,974
Speaker 0: Because we don't have our you know Westerns and whatnot anymore which are not appropriate for the kids or at least not like.

789
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,387
Speaker 0: we use not the Westerns like we used to Have and that started.

790
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,437
Speaker 0: all the other superheroes stuff came after that right?

791
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:04,340
Speaker 0: There's no Superman.

792
00:57:04,762 --> 00:57:05,968
Speaker 0: Spider-man wasn't until the 60s.

793
00:57:06,068 --> 00:57:16,541
Speaker 0: Yeah way after Superman Batman was years later - everyone came after super one was what 1938.

794
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:18,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's old shit.

795
00:57:18,709 --> 00:57:21,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pre World War two.

796
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:23,982
Speaker 0: Yep Really old.

797
00:57:24,684 --> 00:57:26,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, Captain America was coming to punch Nazis.

798
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:27,951
Speaker 0: It's like Superman.

799
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,457
Speaker 0: there weren't even Nazis when there was a Superman.

800
00:57:30,618 --> 00:57:32,444
Speaker 0: Yeah He was.

801
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:35,879
Speaker 0: he was doing his super biz before then just fighting mad scientists and whatnot.

802
00:57:36,281 --> 00:57:44,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever, you know and I won't uh, I won't belabor this point But one of my favorite portrayals of Superman still is in the Frank Miller Batman dark.

803
00:57:44,997 --> 00:57:47,525
Speaker 0: We talked about that already But we did.

804
00:57:47,565 --> 00:58:05,679
Speaker 1: the episode we did on that comic is worth listening to if you're interested in this conversation because we talked about Superman a lot in that episode because Superman despite how few appearances he has in that comic is Like is such an overbearing presence when he appears on the page.

805
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:19,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the last thing is so, you know, not everyone, you know You can like tell a Superman story legally because you got to have the license He's still owned even though certain things are so old the public domain like the old cartoons.

806
00:58:19,501 --> 00:58:23,460
Speaker 0: You can't just go making a Superman comic on your own and sell it for money, right?

807
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:37,920
Speaker 0: But a lot of you know, the Superman's powers flying strength, you know laser eyeball, right freeze breath Those all became like the template for other superheroes because you just gave him the same powers or almost the same powers, right?

808
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:43,460
Speaker 0: It's like oh, you know, you got a bunch of heroes flying around together right punching real hard or a super strength, whatever.

809
00:58:45,043 --> 00:59:01,458
Speaker 0: So what you have seen is even if Superman himself doesn't officially Tell the kinds of stories that I would like to see from Superman at least often enough You do see a lot of times other people writing superhero stories with a superhero.

810
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:04,147
Speaker 0: That is Effectively fucking Superman.

811
00:59:04,348 --> 00:59:06,776
Speaker 0: right they fly they punch hard.

812
00:59:06,956 --> 00:59:08,100
Speaker 0: They're basically invincible.

813
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:15,680
Speaker 0: They just have a big like are on their chest maybe Yeah, or something like that and they just tell a story that could have been a Superman story.

814
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:16,583
Speaker 0: But isn't?

815
00:59:16,683 --> 00:59:18,229
Speaker 0: it's in some other person

816
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:30,926
Speaker 1: that is actually the legacy of Superman that I am the most Invested in the people who take the long shadow of Superman and tell the story of a Superman themselves Not the canonical Superman, you

817
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,660
Speaker 0: know, I mean people do that with Superman to miniseries alternate universes and whatnot.

818
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:46,784
Speaker 0: But one one that comes to mind that I like a lot which isn't the greatest But I have it and I've read it all is there was a series called rising stars and in it There's a bunch of superheroes.

819
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:48,869
Speaker 0: But one of them is Superman.

820
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,752
Speaker 0: ish, right?

821
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:55,599
Speaker 0: It's sort of Superman Captain America ish type of character and spoilers for rising stars.

822
00:59:57,002 --> 01:00:04,700
Speaker 0: He goes around the whole world and just takes Like all the nuclear weapons on earth from every country just yoinks him and throws him and gets rid of him.

823
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:05,563
Speaker 0: It's just like fuck.

824
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:06,266
Speaker 0: That's it.

825
01:00:06,346 --> 01:00:07,732
Speaker 0: I forced nuclear dearmament.

826
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:08,575
Speaker 0: right deal with it.

827
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:09,338
Speaker 0: Um, what are you gonna?

828
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:09,820
Speaker 0: just stop me?

829
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,318
Speaker 0: You know, I can't stop me with the nuke.

830
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:16,075
Speaker 0: I'm effectively scary and he just fucking does it and it's like.

831
01:00:16,437 --> 01:00:18,044
Speaker 0: that's the shit I love to see.

832
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:20,976
Speaker 0: right that sort of stuff that you know.

833
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:25,198
Speaker 0: Superman Occasionally does stuff like that but not often enough.

834
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:27,627
Speaker 1: Harley Quinn actually does it there.

835
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:33,909
Speaker 1: Superman take is interesting too because when he shows up he not only is all-powerful But he also like doesn't show up when he should.

836
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,659
Speaker 0: and well, that's that's what Saitama does.

837
01:00:36,679 --> 01:00:42,599
Speaker 1: Yeah But he's very much portrayed as I like, you know, you could be doing a lot more buddy.

838
01:00:43,721 --> 01:00:48,480
Speaker 0: Listen, well, I think the other well, it depends on which DC, you know, if you're going DC Universe stuff, right?

839
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,434
Speaker 0: It's like a lot of times Superman is dealing with even bigger problems in outer space.

840
01:00:52,534 --> 01:00:53,236
Speaker 0: Hmm, right?

841
01:00:53,598 --> 01:00:56,126
Speaker 0: It's like yeah There's people falling off buildings.

842
01:00:56,166 --> 01:01:04,247
Speaker 0: There's a there's a mad scientist doing a crime or you know, see the you know Something like that, but it's like bro Asteroid is gonna like hit the earth.

843
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:06,640
Speaker 0: Superman is you know, he can't just do that instantly.

844
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:13,380
Speaker 0: Okay, it takes him at least a little time to go fly out there push the asteroid right onto some different orbit.

845
01:01:13,442 --> 01:01:14,221
Speaker 1: I guess so It's.

846
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:20,660
Speaker 1: I've never really read or engaged with much Superman not doing like very mundane earth stuff.

847
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:30,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you read, you know, a lot of that like crisis infinite earths Like he's just doing outer space dealing with all kinds of outer space like time shit, right?

848
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:39,339
Speaker 0: Making sure the fabric of the universe doesn't fall apart right, you know dealing with that sort of god-tier, you know threats Right cuz who else is gonna do it?

849
01:01:41,342 --> 01:01:46,740
Speaker 0: Batman is not dealing with that shit Even though they end up in DC finding some way for him to help with that kind of stuff.

850
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:53,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of DC Universe stuff is predicated on the concept of how do we cram Batman in here?

851
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:55,603
Speaker 1: So this will sell Sometimes.

852
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:56,714
Speaker 0: but you know, it's like.

853
01:01:56,734 --> 01:02:02,099
Speaker 0: yeah The flash just runs fast, even though sometimes they find a way that for the flash to help with it, too.

854
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:08,266
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know what other DC, you know, I guess there's like plastic man I was like, you know, we're Harley Quinn.

855
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:11,217
Speaker 0: Harley Quinn isn't gonna stop the space-time riff from ending the unit.

856
01:02:11,278 --> 01:02:15,370
Speaker 1: Oh in fact Spoilers Gotham gets fucking destroyed at the end of the first season.

857
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:15,872
Speaker 1: Let's just like

858
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:17,639
Speaker 0: if one of the you know

859
01:02:19,982 --> 01:02:22,699
Speaker 1: Cool now I get to hang out in a wrecked city fuck y'all, right

860
01:02:23,502 --> 01:02:33,798
Speaker 0: If there's some DC villain going around not like the Joker but like Darkseid or some nonsense like yeah Only Superman's gonna be on the level to do anything about that.

861
01:02:33,818 --> 01:02:43,285
Speaker 1: Yeah So I'm gonna read a lot because the other thing about Superman's personality is all that the attributes we have talked about Really did come later.

862
01:02:44,088 --> 01:02:47,900
Speaker 1: in the earliest days Superman was quote rough and aggressive.

863
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:52,662
Speaker 1: He often used excessive force and terror against criminals and on occasions Yeah, he was just.

864
01:02:52,742 --> 01:02:56,195
Speaker 0: it was like a you know, like a mean Dick Tracy kind of like you.

865
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:59,878
Speaker 1: look at the early concept designs And he's this kind of just jolly looking dude.

866
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,645
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just was really strong.

867
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:03,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one.

868
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:08,420
Speaker 1: he was bulletproof and the comics code actually forced the change in his personality.

869
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:16,220
Speaker 1: hmm So you only had a couple years of mean killing Superman and then he turned into the boy the Blue Wonder Boy Scout.

870
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:19,700
Speaker 0: I mean you only had a little while of gun Batman.

871
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,348
Speaker 0: Yeah And it was just a detective.

872
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:30,380
Speaker 0: and then and then all the way in the future Batman's got a kryptonite gun But no regular yeah, then the the censors turned him into corny old Adam West Batman.

873
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the cod the Silver Age Batman is a lot like that.

874
01:03:34,092 --> 01:03:35,115
Speaker 0: Adam West TV show.

875
01:03:35,155 --> 01:03:36,520
Speaker 0: all corny, right?

876
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:43,667
Speaker 0: It's all this, you know wacky and whatever you see like those really silly like memes made with up like, you know Cutouts from a Batman comic.

877
01:03:43,707 --> 01:03:46,120
Speaker 0: that's what it's from Silver Age Batman for sure.

878
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:55,020
Speaker 1: I appreciate this moment where uh Harley Quinn literally challenges Batman or father Superman to a fight and in response is just he laughs slightly and then he leaves.

879
01:03:56,621 --> 01:03:59,950
Speaker 0: Mmm, and you know Silver Age Superman comics, right?

880
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:01,655
Speaker 0: We're sort of like equally silly.

881
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:06,578
Speaker 0: you ever see those ones where it's like You know, like what's it called?

882
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:12,100
Speaker 0: This where it's like, oh, you know, it comes it there's like all those comedic ones that come.

883
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,071
Speaker 0: I can't find any of them on the internet right now.

884
01:04:14,132 --> 01:04:18,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Read a lot of those Because they're corny.

885
01:04:18,286 --> 01:04:22,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why you just see them as memes on you know, the internet, right?

886
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:24,547
Speaker 0: Yeah here Oh, like, you know, here we go Superman.

887
01:04:24,808 --> 01:04:26,314
Speaker 0: How can here we go Superman?

888
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:34,340
Speaker 0: it from July number 218 it cost 15 cents right and on the comic you've got a shocked Superman.

889
01:04:34,902 --> 01:04:41,360
Speaker 0: You've got a woman who says who's pointing at a little superboy who's flying and the woman says how can you deny?

890
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,425
Speaker 0: I'm your wife Superman.

891
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:45,060
Speaker 0: You signed our marriage certificate and there's your super son.

892
01:04:45,181 --> 01:04:48,599
Speaker 0: Why did you leave us see daddy me fly just like you?

893
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,447
Speaker 0: Featuring Superman's secret past right?

894
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:54,077
Speaker 0: It's like that's Silver Age biz right there.

895
01:04:54,097 --> 01:04:54,839
Speaker 0: That is not.

896
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:56,959
Speaker 1: Well, what do you get into like crypto?

897
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:09,419
Speaker 0: All that stuff that is all Silver Age stuff that you know, that's what happens when you're an old superhero No matter what you are No matter what your story is.

898
01:05:10,122 --> 01:05:15,800
Speaker 0: Any superhero that was around in those days went through those that corny storytelling trend of the Silver Age.

899
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:24,268
Speaker 0: It's like this dude's a god and you're threatening him with like, you know some daytime talk show Who's the who's the baby daddy shit?

900
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:24,951
Speaker 0: It's like what.

901
01:05:25,433 --> 01:05:27,140
Speaker 0: but on another why does he even care?

902
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:30,800
Speaker 1: You can argue that that is a lot like like look at old Greek gods again.

903
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:43,280
Speaker 1: It's just a ridiculous talk show drama nonsense baby mama drama constantly Mm-hmm, and the gods care a lot about this for some reason Yep, so maybe Superman cared a lot about it in that era.

904
01:05:43,762 --> 01:05:52,195
Speaker 1: I think we don't have to worry about the the poison pill of Trying to make a canonically consistent Superman because trying to make can it's not possible.

905
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:57,440
Speaker 1: trying to make cannons out of any Large thing is just an exercise in like nerd futility.

906
01:06:00,907 --> 01:06:12,040
Speaker 0: So, yeah, yeah, you know I do like the it's you know Because of those core features of the story that are good You know to explore and it's like you could explore them endlessly.

907
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:13,886
Speaker 0: Right this you meant.

908
01:06:13,926 --> 01:06:18,519
Speaker 0: it it's possible to keep Superman like around and relevant even to this day.

909
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:23,019
Speaker 0: But I you know, I think it's simply the company that owns it.

910
01:06:23,561 --> 01:06:30,040
Speaker 0: Right not wanting to like, you know go down those roads because they're too, you know serious and heavy biz.

911
01:06:30,966 --> 01:06:32,939
Speaker 0: To go down those roads is why?

912
01:06:33,682 --> 01:06:39,156
Speaker 0: You know, you don't see you know, the like DC movies killing it the way the Marvel movies are killing it.

913
01:06:39,517 --> 01:06:42,266
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm You know cuz Marvel has always.

914
01:06:42,286 --> 01:06:49,974
Speaker 0: you know, there are the godlike figures in Marvel are all in outer space pretty much You don't have to write and they're usually a threat.

915
01:06:49,994 --> 01:06:51,300
Speaker 0: They're not usually your main hero.

916
01:06:51,562 --> 01:06:57,820
Speaker 1: Your main heroes are always people in New York who just live there And for a lot of reasons, they kind of just keep the x-men off to the side.

917
01:06:59,022 --> 01:07:02,817
Speaker 0: But even the x-men are just you know, they're mutants but they're they're still human they're now.

918
01:07:02,837 --> 01:07:03,440
Speaker 1: they're not God.

919
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,963
Speaker 1: Cyclops could be taken out by a bullet if someone was careful Right.

920
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:09,309
Speaker 0: I mean almost every.

921
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:12,122
Speaker 0: if Superman came to the Marvel Universe It's like who.

922
01:07:12,283 --> 01:07:15,494
Speaker 0: anyone who lives on earth is pretty much not gonna fuck with them, right?

923
01:07:15,976 --> 01:07:17,060
Speaker 0: Is there any Marvel?

924
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,394
Speaker 0: I would are some but not any major not any major ones.

925
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:29,419
Speaker 0: You know, we're taking out any of the psychic characters Maybe but you know Thor level right is a Thor level character That's true.

926
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:38,193
Speaker 0: But you know what keeps Thor right from being Superman in the Marvel Universe is that you know There's other gods in Asgard right?

927
01:07:38,294 --> 01:07:39,199
Speaker 0: It's like Odin's there.

928
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:40,682
Speaker 0: It's like.

929
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:44,573
Speaker 0: it's not like Thor is the number one dude, right Superman is.

930
01:07:44,613 --> 01:07:47,080
Speaker 0: that is the top dog right in the DC Universe.

931
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:47,341
Speaker 0: There's.

932
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,567
Speaker 0: no it's not like there's some other.

933
01:07:49,868 --> 01:07:51,994
Speaker 0: there are but there aren't.

934
01:07:52,154 --> 01:08:00,280
Speaker 0: effectively there's not like name one Name someone who's more who's more important some decent only if you're someone who's not a DC Comics nerd name one.

935
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a better way to put it.

936
01:08:02,307 --> 01:08:06,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah name one name one that someone on the street knows who they are.

937
01:08:07,164 --> 01:08:18,800
Speaker 1: I think the important thing to just take away from Superman is just that There's so much media that you don't need to think about like oh I like Superman or I don't like Superman or just Superman is a kind of story.

938
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:31,399
Speaker 1: It's almost like a modern folklore that is so pervasive in the end in our storytelling today that the echoes of Superman are in All this other media and the echoes of Superman in just how we talk about things.

939
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:36,930
Speaker 1: Like you said using the word kryptonite That is the most fascinating thing about Superman far more.

940
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,720
Speaker 1: So than most of the stories told about him specifically.

941
01:08:41,203 --> 01:08:56,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, even somebody who's like, you know Never in their whole life watched or read or any Superman thing ever Right, even some kid right who's just just in elementary school will know what you mean if you say something something's kryptonite.

942
01:08:57,118 --> 01:09:04,305
Speaker 0: Yeah So Everyone sees the S in that shape thing, you know It's might as well be a coke.

943
01:09:04,365 --> 01:09:08,359
Speaker 1: there are exactly two cool S's and everyone in America has seen both of them.

944
