Speaker 1: Well, I suppose we're back after the I don't know how many days hiatus over the holiday.

00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:42,632
Speaker 1: you've missed two shows Yeah, but that's fine because now we have plenty of Mondays to make up for it and We yeah.

10
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,960
Speaker 1: You see you might have thought oh, they'll definitely do a show on New Year's Day.

11
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,834
Speaker 1: They they already skipped a day for the New Year's holiday.

12
00:00:49,854 --> 00:00:51,000
Speaker 1: They're not gonna skip another day.

13
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:51,563
Speaker 1: You know what?

14
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:54,260
Speaker 1: We had more people in our house than our house can hold.

15
00:00:55,762 --> 00:00:57,812
Speaker 0: We had it all about that, but we did.

16
00:00:57,852 --> 00:00:59,701
Speaker 0: we were nearing maximum capacity We had.

17
00:00:59,802 --> 00:01:05,590
Speaker 1: we couldn't have had any more people and still have had enough room to do anything We could have done.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,898
Speaker 0: it just depends on what we were gonna do.

19
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,420
Speaker 1: Oh if we all want to sit around quietly sipping tea and watching Jane Eyre then yes, there was plenty of room.

20
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:19,115
Speaker 0: yes, exactly, but for playing Wii Sports or Playing guitar hero mostly Wii Sports playing regular tycoon.

21
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:24,556
Speaker 0: There was not enough room Yeah for those of you who don't know there was barely enough room to play.

22
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:32,220
Speaker 1: like San Juan We had our annual not quite a bacchanal like some of our other friends tend to throw but definitely a giant party.

23
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:34,300
Speaker 0: It is quite the party.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,039
Speaker 1: Yeah We're not gonna talk about the party today because there's quite a bit to say and I imagine we will get to that Thursday or possibly next Tuesday.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,339
Speaker 0: Mmm, that sounds good.

26
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,229
Speaker 1: Well, we got some party topics.

27
00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:49,832
Speaker 0: since a lot of people don't seem to know how to throw a party I bet you a lot of people don't even know what a party is.

28
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:54,800
Speaker 0: people think a party is like those You know what you see on television and all those like teens You know what?

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:02,118
Speaker 1: Those are the same people who thought that high school was going to be exactly like Saved by the Bell and they were gonna have Adventures just like Zach Morris did.

30
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,951
Speaker 1: Okay, we're just gonna jump right back in business as usual.

31
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:08,554
Speaker 1: none of that.

32
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:09,919
Speaker 1: happy new year BS.

33
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:15,840
Speaker 0: No, because it's just an arbitrary changing of clocks and calendars to a new number.

34
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 1: Well, see that's the nice erudite explanation.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:25,044
Speaker 1: The actual truth is that we're exhausted and some bunch of our friends are still here and we're gonna go play some board games as Soon as we're done with this show.

36
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:25,968
Speaker 0: take that.

37
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:32,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, we care more about playing board games and we care about doing this And yet we still not managed to get four of these out a week.

38
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:33,700
Speaker 0: I don't know how that happened.

39
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:34,544
Speaker 1: You know, really?

40
00:02:34,584 --> 00:02:35,006
Speaker 1: I don't either.

41
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,800
Speaker 0: No, I guess we did really care more about playing board games.

42
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,092
Speaker 0: We just wouldn't do it today and we'd go play board games.

43
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could stop right now.

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:03:01,998
Speaker 1: So right into the news and actually very much related to the holiday season and somewhat tangentially related to video gaming You know being gaming day a lot of people got HD TVs and HD TV Paraphernalia over the Christmas and New Year's break.

45
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,643
Speaker 1: a lot of people.

46
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:11,160
Speaker 1: sales were very very brisk because prices have come down a lot and people seem to think that they know about this Stuff or that you know, now it's now's the time to buy it.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,783
Speaker 1: It's mainstream.

48
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:22,740
Speaker 1: and now according to this in several articles Many of the retailers that sold these products and many of the companies that make these products are being flooded with complaints from people who?

49
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:31,306
Speaker 1: Are realizing that the HD TV they brought home doesn't look nearly as good in their house as it did In Circuit City or at Best Buy.

50
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:36,480
Speaker 0: Well, there are many reasons for that but chief among them is people don't add hookup HD TVs.

51
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I've talked about a news guy.

52
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:50,900
Speaker 1: This is like six months ago where based on telephone surveys less than half of all people who own HD TVs Actually see HD TV content either because it's not available or they don't have their HD TV even hooked up, right?

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:04:00,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now a lot of new people bought TVs and remember the last generation of TVs before Component and all these different digital things and everything.

54
00:04:00,711 --> 00:04:03,340
Speaker 1: you had either coaxial or the little RCA dealies.

55
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:07,280
Speaker 1: Yep, you just plugged them in color for color worked automatically.

56
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:12,660
Speaker 1: No, every TV worked with every piece of equipment and it worked perfectly and there was nothing you could mess up.

57
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:16,860
Speaker 0: And then you know whenever they came out with a new connector, they just got rid of the old one.

58
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,839
Speaker 0: You know, we used to have those UHF VHF prongs.

59
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,371
Speaker 0: Then we got rid of those and replaced it with coax.

60
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,540
Speaker 0: then we got rid of coax replaced it with RCA.

61
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:28,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like every TV always had the current connector and the previous connect.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,191
Speaker 0: But then as soon as we got as video we still have as video and we still have Component and we still have HSD PA which is the new one.

63
00:04:36,613 --> 00:04:38,640
Speaker 0: So it gets really confusing for people.

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,919
Speaker 0: They just see all these plugs and they don't know how to hook their own shit up, which it really isn't that hard.

65
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,589
Speaker 1: Well, I have a sad anecdote.

66
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:53,797
Speaker 1: when I was well, actually it was the freshman year after Well after the summer after our freshman year of college I went back to Michigan.

67
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:54,700
Speaker 1: I lived there for the summer.

68
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,730
Speaker 1: That was the last time I lived in Michigan.

69
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:03,020
Speaker 1: a bunch of my high school friends Realized midway through the summer that I was around and tried to get in touch with me.

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,199
Speaker 1: I ended up going to a gathering at one of their houses.

71
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:07,689
Speaker 1: They decided oh, let's watch a movie.

72
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:11,366
Speaker 1: and then they call me into the room and you know I expect we're gonna watch a movie.

73
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:12,512
Speaker 1: and they say rim.

74
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:13,195
Speaker 1: Can you help us?

75
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:15,685
Speaker 1: We don't know how to Make this work.

76
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:18,420
Speaker 1: We've never gotten this thing to work before now.

77
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,138
Speaker 1: When they said this thing I expected to see some like early adopter crazy HDTV set up or something weird.

78
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:34,920
Speaker 1: I discovered a normal TV with RCA holes in the front and a DVD player with RCA holes in the back and an RCA cable.

79
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,929
Speaker 1: Okay, and I was like, what's the problem?

80
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,716
Speaker 1: And they said well, we don't know how to hook this up.

81
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:40,539
Speaker 1: It won't work.

82
00:05:41,682 --> 00:05:48,714
Speaker 1: so I plugged in the RCA cables and I hit play and I think the comment one of them made was something to the effect of see.

83
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:50,160
Speaker 1: that's why he went to tech school.

84
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,087
Speaker 1: He knows this shit.

85
00:05:51,692 --> 00:06:05,197
Speaker 0: Yeah So the thing is is Really if I was the manufacturer of televisions or HD televisions or anything I would definitely try to get rid of.

86
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:13,865
Speaker 0: you know some of the older inputs and I would try to discourage people who make DVD players and you know game consoles and such from using Older connectors.

87
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:20,397
Speaker 0: I mean sure the Wii doesn't do HD So it doesn't really, you know RCA is just fine for it.

88
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:21,000
Speaker 0: But you know what?

89
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,520
Speaker 0: There's no reason they couldn't send their lower resolution stuff over a nice component cable and it wouldn't really make it that much more expensive.

90
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:33,096
Speaker 1: Except a lot of people don't even have component capabilities.

91
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:37,739
Speaker 0: I know I mean Americans TV has component but it's not HD.

92
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:47,108
Speaker 1: The fact that DVD took off as well and as quickly and as amazingly as it did is kind of a big deal because no Technology has really taken off like that.

93
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:58,431
Speaker 1: Well, no consumer technology since then and people have this expectation that televisions and video game consoles and Things that allow them to watch movies are appliances.

94
00:06:58,712 --> 00:06:59,595
Speaker 1: They're not computers.

95
00:06:59,615 --> 00:07:00,338
Speaker 1: They're not complex.

96
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:01,000
Speaker 1: They're not difficult.

97
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:01,863
Speaker 1: They just work.

98
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:07,702
Speaker 1: you plug them in you hit play and that is so not true with HD and people just aren't ready for that At all.

99
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:18,240
Speaker 1: No, and the manuals are terrible HD manuals I mean, they're not written technically well for someone like us, but they're not written dumb down enough for people who aren't like us.

100
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:28,412
Speaker 0: I think a big part of the problem is if you look at the manual for any DVD player or television or anything like that It always gives you little diagrams Like if you have this set up plug them in like this.

101
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:30,200
Speaker 0: if you have this set up plug them in like this.

102
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,379
Speaker 0: You know and there's a bunch of different things.

103
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:38,740
Speaker 0: The problem is a lot of people have these home theaters now Especially people who are buying big-screen HDTVs.

104
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:48,940
Speaker 0: They have these home theaters that have a whole bunch of components and the way it says to hook them up in the book is Not necessarily, you know, your TV book says one thing your receiver book says another thing.

105
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,222
Speaker 0: you're you know, your DVD book says another thing and you don't know which one to listen to and It's it.

106
00:07:55,683 --> 00:08:05,920
Speaker 0: people who don't understand input and output and the separation of audio and video Which isn't really that complicated when someone tells it to you are gonna have a problem.

107
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:24,020
Speaker 1: Well, I get the feeling to bring this background to video games right away that part of the ill will towards the PlayStation 3 that is probably going to be coming out a lot more in the weeks to come as people get their hands on ps3 since according To the internet as a whole there are a lot of places where ps3s are just on the shelves

108
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,678
Speaker 0: Supposedly haven't seen it.

109
00:08:25,981 --> 00:08:34,556
Speaker 1: I imagine they're not places like New York City or LA but they're places like I don't know Podunk, Iowa where they got the one ps3 and no one can afford it.

110
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:41,840
Speaker 1: or yeah Or they've got the three in the Walmart in an area where just no one wants a ps3 Or people don't even think that they could get one there.

111
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:45,518
Speaker 1: Well, there's also the fact that there's a million of them on eBay going for pretty much retail.

112
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:55,539
Speaker 1: Yep Yep, but people, you know They get a ps3 and they get a brand new HD TV and they hook it all up And it doesn't look so hot because they're not actually using the HD properly.

113
00:08:57,484 --> 00:09:00,240
Speaker 0: So 60 has the same problem and that seems to be working.

114
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,252
Speaker 1: Okay, but the thing is the Xbox 360 while it is HD and all that.

115
00:09:04,773 --> 00:09:08,163
Speaker 1: They didn't market it so much like oh HD.

116
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:09,647
Speaker 1: this is the best possible.

117
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,248
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

118
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:18,190
Speaker 1: They marketed it more as Xbox Live online gaming video games Yeah, and I think Sony really shot himself in the foot on this.

119
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:24,952
Speaker 0: I think it's mostly gonna be ill will like continued against the Electronics retailers like Best Buy and Circuit City.

120
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:26,380
Speaker 1: See Circuit City's starting to cash in.

121
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,960
Speaker 1: They're starting to and a couple other retailers are picking up.

122
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:34,300
Speaker 0: Well, they what they did is Best Buy bought the geek squad, right, but that's mostly to handle computer problems.

123
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:38,576
Speaker 0: Circuit City bought what's it called something dog or whatever.

124
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,118
Speaker 0: It's called.

125
00:09:39,138 --> 00:09:41,007
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, the point is they're starting to.

126
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:45,499
Speaker 1: you know, buy an HD TV and hey for 50 bucks We'll send someone over to hook it up right for you.

127
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,105
Speaker 0: Yeah That's a good idea.

128
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,792
Speaker 0: and it also sells them extra cables.

129
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,426
Speaker 0: because you go over there and you say oh you need this game on This cable.

130
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,581
Speaker 0: Yep hundred bucks Yeah You need.

131
00:09:53,621 --> 00:10:03,636
Speaker 1: you need the clearly superior monster digital cable as opposed to the clearly inferior yet electronically identical non-monster digital cable.

132
00:10:03,797 --> 00:10:05,462
Speaker 1: exactly All right.

133
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:06,044
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

134
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:09,216
Speaker 0: All right, so I got two sort of related stories.

135
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:14,070
Speaker 0: the first one Apparently there's a Sonic the Hedgehog game for the 360.

136
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,039
Speaker 0: I didn't know that But this guy put up a video of a bug in the game where he basically sits there loading for 20 minutes.

137
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,965
Speaker 1: Does this happen often?

138
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:29,715
Speaker 0: I don't know but it there's a problem in the game and It's everyone's going.

139
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,565
Speaker 0: OMG What are you doing with that gun?

140
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:35,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got a. I'm a little distracted here.

141
00:10:35,816 --> 00:10:37,000
Speaker 1: I'll let you all in on the secret.

142
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:38,846
Speaker 1: Our friends I don't.

143
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:53,719
Speaker 1: Conrad got us as a gift a sack of potatoes And then as we're puzzling over the sack of potatoes the other gifts they gave us were potato guns And I've been fiddling with it and shooting little spuds on my carpet for the last five minutes, but I'm gonna have to clean up.

144
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:56,039
Speaker 1: So anyway, come with your news.

145
00:10:56,334 --> 00:10:58,041
Speaker 0: well there's also a Bubble.

146
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:05,859
Speaker 0: bobble DS has this famous bug in it where F's you get to a certain boss and the boss never appears and you're stuck There forever and you can't beat the game.

147
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:07,996
Speaker 1: yeah, that's just fantastic.

148
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:16,707
Speaker 0: and Apparently the recent release I'm glad I didn't pay for it of military madness on the Wii and the virtual console.

149
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:20,036
Speaker 0: It's an old turbo graphics game is a little broken.

150
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:22,301
Speaker 1: how broken I Can't.

151
00:11:22,422 --> 00:11:22,703
Speaker 0: no one.

152
00:11:22,844 --> 00:11:26,040
Speaker 0: I can't exactly say how broken it is because I haven't found the article.

153
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,186
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't buy it yet.

154
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:27,428
Speaker 1: Then.

155
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:28,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was planning.

156
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:40,320
Speaker 0: it says, you know But here the article I'm gonna link to is this one that talks about dungeon explore Which is a game they were supposed to release on the Wii virtual console on Monday, which they didn't.

157
00:11:42,174 --> 00:11:48,796
Speaker 0: but Apparently dungeon explorer if you haven't noticed is not available on your virtual console on Monday.

158
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,160
Speaker 0: It's not available now either.

159
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:53,910
Speaker 0: Apparently they're having some trouble getting that game to work properly.

160
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,520
Speaker 1: at least they recognize there's a problem and they didn't put it out.

161
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:04,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I've noticed a market increase in the amount of bugginess in console game releases.

162
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:06,109
Speaker 1: You know that worries me.

163
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:09,784
Speaker 1: I mean PC games went through the same evolution Early PC games.

164
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:15,840
Speaker 1: you didn't release a PC game with a bug because getting a patch onto a PC game was pretty much impossible.

165
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:16,660
Speaker 1: No one had the internet.

166
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:24,823
Speaker 0: Yeah If someone had a video game magazine Then they could get the CD in it which might have the patch on it for the game They were playing.

167
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:26,168
Speaker 0: so that was rare.

168
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:29,420
Speaker 1: like games were tested to hell and while bugs still occurred.

169
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,120
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm not gonna pretend that was some mystical age of gaming where there weren't bugs.

170
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:34,804
Speaker 0: No, come on.

171
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,140
Speaker 0: Even Mario 1 has a bug with the minus world.

172
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,440
Speaker 0: It's not really a bug but you know.

173
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,438
Speaker 1: But the bugs in games back then tended to be obscure difficult to invoke and not terribly annoying.

174
00:12:47,022 --> 00:12:56,203
Speaker 1: Then as the game industry started not doing so well Well, actually no it started when the game industry was doing really well and people started rushing games out just to you know capitalize on the profits.

175
00:12:56,705 --> 00:13:01,460
Speaker 1: and then the industry started collapsing and people started rushing games out to get them out cheaper and recoup their losses.

176
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,629
Speaker 1: and They stopped testing games so much.

177
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:07,545
Speaker 1: and then as the internet got faster they started saying Oh, well, we can just patch the games.

178
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:13,426
Speaker 1: and now pretty much any PC game that gets released isn't actually a game release It's basically a public beta.

179
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:16,840
Speaker 1: and then you expect hundreds of megabytes of patches over the next six months.

180
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:22,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, and all these online games, you know, I can understand Downloadable extra content.

181
00:13:22,206 --> 00:13:23,189
Speaker 0: I have no problem with that.

182
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,513
Speaker 0: You know, hey everyone.

183
00:13:24,714 --> 00:13:25,496
Speaker 0: Here's a new level.

184
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:26,800
Speaker 0: Hey, here's a new mod.

185
00:13:27,085 --> 00:13:27,818
Speaker 0: That's all cool.

186
00:13:28,403 --> 00:13:37,600
Speaker 0: But when there's patches that you know, or maybe you know You just it's an online multiplayer game and you want to change the rules like counter-strike decided to change the weapon price system.

187
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:52,320
Speaker 0: You know, I can understand that a little bit too, but when you have severe Can't play the game problems Like there's a loading screen for 20 minutes or the boss doesn't appear and not even that is a PC game.

188
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,931
Speaker 1: All right, just put the patch out and it just will automatically.

189
00:13:54,991 --> 00:13:59,848
Speaker 1: but when it comes to console games there's always been kind of this a console game.

190
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:10,138
Speaker 1: part of the reason that they've been successful and the reason that they eventually superseded PC gaming at least so far now has been that console games just work because it's not easy to patch them.

191
00:14:10,479 --> 00:14:22,029
Speaker 1: if you put Out a Nintendo cartridge or I don't know a PlayStation 1 game and it was broken you either had to recall that mofo or Basically piss off all of your customers forever.

192
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:23,092
Speaker 0: and it's happened before.

193
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,540
Speaker 0: there were some PlayStation games with just broken discs.

194
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:28,380
Speaker 0: That didn't work and everyone sent the discs back and got new ones.

195
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was a rare occurrence and when it did it was a huge deal.

196
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,580
Speaker 0: It was a huge deal.

197
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:41,499
Speaker 0: But now that consoles have I mean even that really really bad mountain bike game for the Super Nintendo Didn't have bugs in it other than the fact that it existed.

198
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:47,259
Speaker 1: If you I mean I would consider the basic gameplay mechanic of that game to be a bug.

199
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,039
Speaker 0: Yes However, it worked as intended by the developers.

200
00:14:53,645 --> 00:14:58,839
Speaker 0: We can only assume Assume that was what they intended to create.

201
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:01,007
Speaker 1: Well, they created a monster.

202
00:15:01,127 --> 00:15:04,700
Speaker 1: I did indeed but console games are supposed to just work.

203
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,325
Speaker 1: I mean computers.

204
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:10,559
Speaker 1: while it'd be nice if they just work that's not something that we can expect for a long time to come.

205
00:15:11,181 --> 00:15:15,920
Speaker 1: HDTVs don't just work for stupid reasons, but console games have always just worked.

206
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:16,864
Speaker 1: That's the point.

207
00:15:17,346 --> 00:15:30,460
Speaker 1: if console games because of the fact that consoles can get updated online Start not working and requiring patches like, you know, PC games have needed for the last five to ten years I don't think it's gonna end well for the console gaming industry.

208
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:31,564
Speaker 0: Here's another thing.

209
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:48,480
Speaker 0: when it comes to like the Xbox Live arcade or the Wii virtual Console or you know these or like a lot of games on Steam where it's a cheap downloadable game You know, basically what they're selling me, but mostly the virtual console is selling me is like here You could emulate this game, but that's kind of hard.

210
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,920
Speaker 0: I mean, it's it's not, you know, it's not a large amount of effort, but it is tricky and it won't be perfect.

211
00:15:54,482 --> 00:16:00,420
Speaker 0: Here is perfect exact emulation of an old game for a slightly overpriced amount of money.

212
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:07,019
Speaker 0: If that has bugs in it, and it doesn't work perfectly Then I might as well emulate it because that was the same effort either way.

213
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:12,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I got to say we got the mario 1 on the virtual console and it feels really good.

214
00:16:13,403 --> 00:16:15,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I've been playing Mars ever since.

215
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,220
Speaker 0: let's see I haven't played mario 1 in an actual NES in a long time.

216
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,300
Speaker 1: We tried to about four months ago and we discovered that every NES we own is broken.

217
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:30,768
Speaker 0: Yeah so I used to play Mario on an NES then I played it on a Game Boy Color and then I played it emulated on A computer for like the longest time.

218
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:33,080
Speaker 0: and just now I played Nintendo.

219
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:45,266
Speaker 0: I mark Super Mario Brothers 1 on the Wii virtual console and Even on the best emulator on Windows on the fastest computer with the best Everything and the best gamepad.

220
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,932
Speaker 0: the one on the Wii is still better.

221
00:16:47,052 --> 00:16:49,300
Speaker 0: That's the best mario 1 I've ever played.

222
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,162
Speaker 0: It's even better than Mario all-stars in the Super Nintendo.

223
00:16:52,863 --> 00:17:00,949
Speaker 0: So it was worth $5.

224
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:01,590
Speaker 1: things of the day.

225
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:04,157
Speaker 0: How can you be so?

226
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:05,843
Speaker 0: I'm tired.

227
00:17:06,285 --> 00:17:06,566
Speaker 1: What are you?

228
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:10,460
Speaker 1: so I'm absolutely freaking exhausted, but I can still keep up the NIG.

229
00:17:11,941 --> 00:17:14,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that because of Red Bull or something like that?

230
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,093
Speaker 1: Well had some Red Bull but that was like two and a half hours ago.

231
00:17:17,113 --> 00:17:20,098
Speaker 0: It's still doing something Red Bull.

232
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:25,126
Speaker 1: I'm totally wasted Except you don't drink alcohol either.

233
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:28,840
Speaker 1: I'm spent, you know, you actually got a pretty decent night's sleep.

234
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,643
Speaker 0: No, not really.

235
00:17:29,683 --> 00:17:34,240
Speaker 0: I got woken up at like 8 by what people want me to drive them to the choo-choo.

236
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,895
Speaker 1: Oh, do you mean the thing that we'd planned on you doing?

237
00:17:36,915 --> 00:17:41,498
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but I you know, my body wanted to sleep longer and it didn't.

238
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:43,826
Speaker 1: yeah I figure I'll get a good night's sleep Bob.

239
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,636
Speaker 1: this we get maybe next weekend.

240
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:47,559
Speaker 0: No, not.

241
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,269
Speaker 1: next week We got to clean the house up.

242
00:17:49,954 --> 00:17:50,680
Speaker 0: That's all you know.

243
00:17:51,482 --> 00:18:03,648
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'll get right into this being video game day as I keep saying since we're getting a lot of new listeners and not everyone seems to be aware of the Fact that we have four different nights where we talk about four different topics and geekery Yeah,

244
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:03,972
Speaker 0: so

245
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:04,660
Speaker 1: I'm saying it again

246
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,137
Speaker 0: Do not be aware Come on

247
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,519
Speaker 1: because people don't listen to that closer but at the end where we explain everything or they don't notice the fact that I'm dig.

248
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:13,368
Speaker 1: there's Five feeds like anime.

249
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:15,700
Speaker 1: world order is sandwiched between two geek night speeds.

250
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:22,220
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't listen to the end of the show then you don't deserve to know about our other days of the show.

251
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:29,514
Speaker 1: yeah, however, we're not gonna pull any chicanery and have Stingers at the end after the music to trick people into listening to it.

252
00:18:29,835 --> 00:18:30,960
Speaker 1: No other than that one time.

253
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:38,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is a video of something that I desire more than just about anything on earth at the moment.

254
00:18:38,962 --> 00:18:40,273
Speaker 1: Why are you aware for the Wii?

255
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:43,238
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Why are you aware for the Wii?

256
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,427
Speaker 1: Exists it is out there.

257
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:50,650
Speaker 1: people in Japan not only are playing it right now But have been playing it for some pretty sure everyone.

258
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:52,780
Speaker 0: but North America has it but I could be wrong.

259
00:18:53,046 --> 00:18:53,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

260
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,518
Speaker 1: There are people here who probably imported it and imported a Wii from Japan and are playing it there might be.

261
00:18:58,578 --> 00:18:59,850
Speaker 0: this has got to be At least one guy now.

262
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,150
Speaker 1: WarioWare, I mean we know how the game works.

263
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,375
Speaker 1: WarioWare micro games.

264
00:19:04,415 --> 00:19:15,382
Speaker 1: That's not a big deal But here is a long video that one shows you a butt ton of all these micro games And I gotta say they all look fantastic Mm-hmm.

265
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,109
Speaker 0: I like how it shows you.

266
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,191
Speaker 0: right before you play a mini game it for like a second It shows you this is how you hold the wiimote for this game.

267
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,939
Speaker 0: This is how you hold the wiimote for this game.

268
00:19:24,441 --> 00:19:30,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, that allows them at least in my eyes to do a lot more with the micro games without making the game just stupid and Angrifying.

269
00:19:31,235 --> 00:19:39,570
Speaker 1: Yeah But there's an interesting mode that none of us out here in Gaijin land knew about until the weekend when we saw this video.

270
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,260
Speaker 1: there is in fact a 12 player mode in WarioWare.

271
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:54,499
Speaker 1: It is single elimination 12 up to 12 people pass around one wiimote and they play micro games and if you ever mess up a micro game Your little angel character falls to his death or something.

272
00:19:54,901 --> 00:20:04,080
Speaker 0: so now this is the best thing ever because if you don't know the first WarioWare was a game a GBA game and it Was one player and it was just waste your time playing little micro games and it was okay.

273
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:16,815
Speaker 0: Then they released the same exact thing for the GameCube, but they tacked on some multiplayer and some you know, not much else You can even you could even play it with a Game Boy Advance by connecting it to your GameCube with the cable.

274
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:24,320
Speaker 1: that multiplayer Catapulted WarioWare from pretty cool and distracting to one of the best party games ever.

275
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,319
Speaker 0: Yep, then they came out with what WarioWare twisted and WarioWare touched.

276
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:35,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, touch can die in a fire great concept but the lack of multiplayer the the crippling Warioware touched is for the DS.

277
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,524
Speaker 1: It's really fun.

278
00:20:36,544 --> 00:20:39,379
Speaker 1: If you find it for less than five bucks, you know, someone who has it just take it.

279
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,040
Speaker 0: Warioware twisted is a GBA one that has like a thing where you can tilt your GBA back and forth in some of the games.

280
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:48,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really don't want to play that in the DS.

281
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,312
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

282
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,420
Speaker 0: You'll be totally backwards actually if you did.

283
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:53,259
Speaker 1: Yeah But just check out this video.

284
00:20:53,722 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 1: If you have the same cravings for Warioware that I have and you'll not only get a touch of it But you'll see this 12 player mode that at least as far as we're concerned is necessary.

285
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,380
Speaker 1: I mean over the weekend, we didn't have any video games that were more than four player.

286
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:14,067
Speaker 0: It's like we're sitting around we've got like 20 people in the house and we've got a Wii and we're like, alright Let's have some fun with this Wii.

287
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:16,580
Speaker 0: The only fun we could really have is Wii Sports.

288
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,245
Speaker 0: I mean excite truck.

289
00:21:18,285 --> 00:21:19,850
Speaker 0: the multiplayer is kind of bleh.

290
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:22,760
Speaker 1: Well, the multiplayer is really fun in excite truck, but still two-player.

291
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,291
Speaker 1: Two-player guitar heroes is great.

292
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:27,120
Speaker 0: two-player guitar heroes is great.

293
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,667
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of play but two-player there's not.

294
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,493
Speaker 1: and monkey ball ass.

295
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:32,716
Speaker 0: monkey ball is crap.

296
00:21:33,057 --> 00:21:34,020
Speaker 1: and sports was fun.

297
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,312
Speaker 1: But if the problem was alright, we say hey who wants to play Wii bowling?

298
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:39,500
Speaker 1: and I don't know ten people raise their hands.

299
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:40,786
Speaker 0: So what are you gonna do?

300
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,740
Speaker 1: You're gonna make people sit there and watch everyone else have fun.

301
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like okay Warioware.

302
00:21:46,447 --> 00:21:49,154
Speaker 0: the Wii is like the ultimate party machine.

303
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:49,896
Speaker 0: Everyone knows it.

304
00:21:49,937 --> 00:21:50,799
Speaker 0: That's what it was made for.

305
00:21:51,321 --> 00:21:53,360
Speaker 0: Why weren't there the party games at launch?

306
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,523
Speaker 0: We need these party games.

307
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,047
Speaker 0: bring Warioware out soon.

308
00:21:56,108 --> 00:22:02,248
Speaker 0: Warioware can hold us over until we get Smash Brothers Mario Party Mario Tennis, whatever.

309
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:05,380
Speaker 1: I mean bring it a when we break the GameCube out.

310
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,840
Speaker 1: Well before the Wii came out we broke the GameCube out at parties.

311
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,865
Speaker 1: It was pretty much just.

312
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:11,577
Speaker 1: Warioware is the game we would break out occasionally.

313
00:22:11,597 --> 00:22:15,931
Speaker 1: Mario Tennis Yep, and Smash Brothers and soccer Mario Party less occasionally.

314
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:16,954
Speaker 0: Mario Soccer is really good.

315
00:22:16,974 --> 00:22:22,833
Speaker 0: There's gonna be Mario Soccer Wii the What's it called Mario Strikers, uh, I forget what they call it.

316
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:23,676
Speaker 1: I'm all about that.

317
00:22:23,716 --> 00:22:26,225
Speaker 0: I gotta say yeah We saw videos of it.

318
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,649
Speaker 0: This guy could be coming out sometime.

319
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:30,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Wii is not gonna disappoint on the party front.

320
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,280
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of the Japanese letting us have these things before we storm that island and take him.

321
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, Reggie promised there wouldn't be a drought.

322
00:22:37,991 --> 00:22:39,980
Speaker 0: We'll see how much he keeps up on his promise.

323
00:22:40,261 --> 00:22:45,741
Speaker 1: Well considering that I'm already content with ice hockey and Mario 1.

324
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, Metal Slug by the way awesome, but also two-player.

325
00:22:49,051 --> 00:22:58,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually we'll just give an allusion that next week Instead of talking about reviewing a specific game or something We're gonna talk and we're gonna do it today, but a little tired here.

326
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:02,780
Speaker 1: Don't want to have to think too much and the game we're gonna review is real easy to talk about without thinking.

327
00:23:03,622 --> 00:23:23,640
Speaker 1: But we want to talk about the logistics of if you're throwing a party about geeks and you know geeks tend to have computers and Video game consoles and a lot of interest in those things if you've got a lot of people in your house for a party or Even if you're running an event somewhere How do you juggle having games available without ruining the vibe of the party and getting that situation where one guy's playing like?

328
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,830
Speaker 1: DDR in the middle of your living room and the other 28 people are standing around in a circle Watching him and slowly drinking themselves into a stupor.

329
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,312
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

330
00:23:31,753 --> 00:23:33,360
Speaker 0: All right, but anyway my thing of the day.

331
00:23:33,842 --> 00:23:34,887
Speaker 0: I found this game today.

332
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:40,022
Speaker 0: It got a lot of links from all kinds of people called Samorost 2.

333
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:49,879
Speaker 0: Yes, there was a Samorost 1 which is a very similar game that I all just found but Let me name some of the reasons that Samorost 2 was all over the internet.

334
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:57,020
Speaker 0: today It has been nominated in the best web browser game and excellence in visual art category for 2000 independent games festival.

335
00:23:57,503 --> 00:23:58,973
Speaker 0: Flash-forward film festival 2006 winner.

336
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:08,037
Speaker 0: soul net festival 2006 winner four out of four point five out of five stars by adventure gamers, etc.

337
00:24:08,057 --> 00:24:08,418
Speaker 0: Etc.

338
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:12,839
Speaker 0: All right This is an award-winning amazing flash game.

339
00:24:13,663 --> 00:24:16,673
Speaker 1: If I describe it in two words, the first word would be slow.

340
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:18,138
Speaker 1: The second word would be artsy.

341
00:24:18,379 --> 00:24:30,180
Speaker 0: Yes It's basically this really artsy kind of cute looking outer-space alien guy and He's on sort of like these asteroid, but it's like a tree.

342
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:30,823
Speaker 0: It's like.

343
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:34,660
Speaker 0: it's really weird because you're in outer space and there's things floating around.

344
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:46,112
Speaker 0: They look like asteroids But they're made of wood and there's like stuff growing on them and things living on them and they have little rocket ships that are Pretty cool and it's one of those click adventure games or what you.

345
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:50,287
Speaker 0: you just have to click at stuff in the right order In order to get to the next screen.

346
00:24:50,307 --> 00:24:53,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not like, you know, your your scum adventure games.

347
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,770
Speaker 0: No where you have to choose, you know, look at that.

348
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:57,940
Speaker 0: pick that up use it on that person.

349
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,089
Speaker 0: No, it's click on the things in the right order, you know and think like the right number of time.

350
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:09,400
Speaker 1: for anyone is old enough to remember all the a lot of those Multimedia adventure games that came out during the multimedia PC era.

351
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:13,724
Speaker 0: Well, it's a lot like that grow game that a lot of people play Where you just had to.

352
00:25:13,905 --> 00:25:18,392
Speaker 0: there's like eight things to choose from and you click them all in the right order to get the biggest Possible planet.

353
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:18,697
Speaker 0: Yep.

354
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:26,656
Speaker 0: Yep It's sort of like you go to a screen and you on that screen you click on things in the right order to get to The next screen and watch as the art scene is continued.

355
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:33,389
Speaker 1: when I was a kid We called games like that hover games because all you did was move the mouse around and the icon the cursor would change Whenever there's something you could click on.

356
00:25:33,731 --> 00:25:35,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you basically click on everything.

357
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,070
Speaker 0: That's how you find what to click on.

358
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:43,418
Speaker 0: but it is much more difficult to find What to click on, you know, what order to click on them and how many times.

359
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:45,167
Speaker 1: yes Don't click in the wrong order.

360
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:49,348
Speaker 0: or and also it's difficult to find, you know You check the whole screen for stuff to click on.

361
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:54,951
Speaker 0: then something else might be able to be clicked on After you click on one thing and that'll mess you up.

362
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:55,654
Speaker 1: Yep.

363
00:25:55,694 --> 00:25:57,180
Speaker 1: So the rest of the world said it's good.

364
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,911
Speaker 1: We didn't play it enough to say it's good.

365
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:02,817
Speaker 0: I played it for a minute or two And I think it could definitely occupy a day at work.

366
00:26:06,102 --> 00:26:08,440
Speaker 0: Right, it's got a little bit of slow loading action going on though.

367
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:10,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might just be because it's super popular right now.

368
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:12,633
Speaker 0: I think it could be so.

369
00:26:13,134 --> 00:26:28,459
Speaker 1: during our party one of our friends you see we had pretty much with few exceptions the entire front row crew in our house and one of the people brought guitar heroes to And one yes and one we really don't play one so much.

370
00:26:28,802 --> 00:26:31,440
Speaker 1: Well thing is we knew guitar heroes was popular.

371
00:26:32,002 --> 00:26:39,992
Speaker 1: Everyone loved it and we never actually got a chance to play it every time we went to for all the longest time It would be there there'd be people playing it.

372
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,440
Speaker 1: We didn't be guests of the con.

373
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,792
Speaker 1: We could have just cut to the front of the line and played if we wanted to.

374
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:44,656
Speaker 0: but I was.

375
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:46,530
Speaker 0: I was never saying Uh, that's again.

376
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:47,479
Speaker 0: I don't want to play.

377
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:52,940
Speaker 0: It was just never I'd ever wanted it to play it so badly that I would play it.

378
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:54,184
Speaker 0: I had to wait it.

379
00:26:54,244 --> 00:27:02,238
Speaker 0: basically though the amount of resistance required for me to actually play the game Was more than the effort I was willing to put into it until recently.

380
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:05,040
Speaker 1: Yep I mean it was an uber con for about two years in a row.

381
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I didn't have.

382
00:27:06,267 --> 00:27:08,600
Speaker 0: if I had a ps2 I probably would have gotten it, you know.

383
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:17,339
Speaker 0: but to buy the system and To buy the game and the controller is like way more effort that I'm gonna put in for one game.

384
00:27:18,205 --> 00:27:25,320
Speaker 0: Unless someone puts the game in my face I wasn't gonna play it, but even though friends that it was great and played it constantly and got really good at it.

385
00:27:25,662 --> 00:27:26,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I didn't disagree.

386
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:34,440
Speaker 0: I mean, I know be money games I like be money games and that's made by red octane, which they're basically the American masters of be money.

387
00:27:34,983 --> 00:27:43,416
Speaker 0: I trusted them and you know, I could imagine it would be fun to Pretend you're a rock star rocking out with a guitar, you know to real awesome music.

388
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:45,019
Speaker 0: good stuff Yep.

389
00:27:45,423 --> 00:27:51,820
Speaker 1: So after having finally played it on two separate occasions We can say with certainty that guitar heroes is fucking fantastic.

390
00:27:53,021 --> 00:27:55,810
Speaker 0: Oh man, guitar hero is an awesome game.

391
00:27:55,871 --> 00:28:00,566
Speaker 0: If you have a ps2 and you don't have guitar hero Why do you even have a ps2?

392
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:01,851
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's really no point.

393
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:02,613
Speaker 0: It did.

394
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:03,838
Speaker 0: There's no there's no purpose.

395
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:04,500
Speaker 1: now.

396
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:06,539
Speaker 1: I don't think it would be enough for me to buy.

397
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,479
Speaker 1: I mean guitar heroes alone would not be reason for me to buy a slim ps2.

398
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:15,697
Speaker 1: No, however, we also want to play Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts 2 press a press.

399
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,189
Speaker 0: I don't know if I really want to play Kingdom Hearts 2, but I know I want to play Kingdom Hearts 1 Yes, and I want to play Okami real badly.

400
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, people send the good stuff about that one.

401
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:26,380
Speaker 0: It seems like a Zelda type game.

402
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,263
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

403
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:30,492
Speaker 1: you brought around feeding animals and it looks really cute.

404
00:28:30,673 --> 00:28:32,398
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also really badass.

405
00:28:32,418 --> 00:28:32,859
Speaker 1: Mmm.

406
00:28:33,583 --> 00:28:35,678
Speaker 1: So now there's enough reasons to buy a ps2.

407
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:40,760
Speaker 0: I'm gonna wait for the price to drop one more time I think and for all the games I've got to go out of style.

408
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean as much as I love guitar heroes, and I want to play all these other games.

409
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,377
Speaker 1: I Haven't even gotten past the first little bit of Zelda because I just haven't had time to play it.

410
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:55,341
Speaker 0: Yep There's no way I'm going out to buy a system and more games when I've got a system and games to play that I haven't Been.

411
00:28:55,924 --> 00:28:58,900
Speaker 1: but I cannot recommend guitar heroes enough.

412
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:13,979
Speaker 1: I mean, especially a lot of people would probably like games like DDR But they're either in a kind of house where you can't really play it or you're in an apartment where you can't jump around A lot or I don't know you're fat or you're not very athletic and you can't dance around very much.

413
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:19,340
Speaker 1: Guitar heroes gives you all the fun that DDR gives you without the workout.

414
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:22,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, another thing is a lot of people, you know who would normally like DDR.

415
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:28,560
Speaker 0: I know some people like this where you know, they're like, ah DDR and you know somewhere in there.

416
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,298
Speaker 0: So, you know they would like it if they actually tried it.

417
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,638
Speaker 0: But they won't try it because you look stupid you they don't like the music etc, etc, etc.

418
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,726
Speaker 1: Like Pete for way way back.

419
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:41,433
Speaker 1: We're trying to give his feet to play DDR with us.

420
00:29:41,494 --> 00:29:48,376
Speaker 1: I was like now no, it's dumb No, no, no, and then one day he finally plays it with us at the arcade and he's like, you know what?

421
00:29:48,396 --> 00:29:49,560
Speaker 1: This is pretty cool.

422
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:51,399
Speaker 1: Thanks for ruining my life.

423
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:58,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Guitar hero has all that but it's not hard to convince people to try it because they go.

424
00:29:58,842 --> 00:30:02,696
Speaker 0: Oh, you want me to fucking rock out to some songs that I already know that are awesome.

425
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:03,600
Speaker 0: sure thing.

426
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:04,241
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the.

427
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:15,560
Speaker 1: that's probably the greatest point of success in guitar heroes and guitar heroes to is that they read octane Knew their audience and they picked the exact music that the audience they were aiming for wanted in a game.

428
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,644
Speaker 0: Well, they also they.

429
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:23,146
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's music that I could think of a billion songs that they would have probably would have tried to Get but just to cause too much money to ya.

430
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:23,367
Speaker 0: Yeah.

431
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:27,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, but despite that the music they got is definitely the music I want.

432
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:34,864
Speaker 0: yeah, another great thing about guitar here that it is like I discover all kinds of new music in it, you know It's like.

433
00:30:34,904 --> 00:30:40,430
Speaker 0: sure there's the songs that I already know that are in there, you know And those are pretty cool to play them a couple times.

434
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:46,835
Speaker 0: I played war pig like four times Yeah, but you go in there and you see like, uh, what the hell's this song.

435
00:30:47,116 --> 00:30:48,260
Speaker 0: less talk more rock.

436
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,584
Speaker 0: That's a fucking awesome song.

437
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:50,968
Speaker 0: or this song Freya.

438
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:52,192
Speaker 0: That's a freaking awesome song.

439
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,740
Speaker 0: Who is who are these people playing this song?

440
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,406
Speaker 0: Oh, that's who those people are.

441
00:30:56,687 --> 00:31:00,039
Speaker 0: Let me go and visit their website, you know, and that's pretty cool, too.

442
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:07,380
Speaker 0: Considering I'm not discovering new music Guitar heroes my number one source of discovering new music recently.

443
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:09,203
Speaker 0: How's that?

444
00:31:09,624 --> 00:31:24,671
Speaker 1: also one thing this game does well that other attempts in similar games have done very poorly and DDR Does it well, but for some reason I see people having trouble with DDR's curve, but the learning curve of guitar heroes is perfect Mmm and it's I mean an individual mode.

445
00:31:24,972 --> 00:31:29,270
Speaker 1: you you make between easy and what difficult Yep, and you like medium.

446
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,040
Speaker 1: There's always there's different levels of difficulty.

447
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:33,792
Speaker 0: It's easy medium hard and extreme.

448
00:31:34,214 --> 00:31:47,694
Speaker 1: now if you put it on easy It's really really really easy, but it's not stupid easy like beginner on DDR where it's just useless Yeah, and DDR like the lowest setting is so easy that it's not fun.

449
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:54,817
Speaker 0: It's like left left, right, right Like you learn how to play the game, but it's not fun at all.

450
00:31:54,837 --> 00:31:56,744
Speaker 0: It's just Boringly easy.

451
00:31:56,764 --> 00:32:03,342
Speaker 1: Yeah beginner mode in DDR doesn't give touch teach you anything that the opening screen doesn't already teach you Yep.

452
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,153
Speaker 0: Now the thing is the rate.

453
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:07,303
Speaker 0: basically in DDR.

454
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,196
Speaker 0: the trick mode however Which is the second difficulty is too difficult for someone who's never played before.

455
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:14,360
Speaker 0: they just get on and play.

456
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,148
Speaker 0: you know and like.

457
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:21,809
Speaker 0: I couldn't play trick mode until I had played the Somewhat boring basic mode for like days.

458
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:23,233
Speaker 1: Well, you mean beginner?

459
00:32:23,494 --> 00:32:24,316
Speaker 1: Yeah.

460
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:25,720
Speaker 1: Yeah basic not beginner beginners.

461
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:27,274
Speaker 1: One arrow per song.

462
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:27,839
Speaker 0: That's right.

463
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:35,842
Speaker 0: But you know guitar hero There are five buttons on the on the guitar and the strummy thing and the whammy bar Which isn't.

464
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:38,938
Speaker 0: you don't really need to use the whammy bar ever, but it's good to use it.

465
00:32:39,483 --> 00:32:40,598
Speaker 1: It's also fun to use it.

466
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,269
Speaker 0: It is to beat the beginner mode.

467
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:50,113
Speaker 0: this easy mode in guitar hero uses three Buttons and there's not a lot of strumming to do so.

468
00:32:50,173 --> 00:32:59,300
Speaker 0: it's really really really easy But there's enough action that it's actually fun to play even if you're like the master of guitar hero.

469
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:04,140
Speaker 0: Playing easy mode is kind of fun because you still feel like you're playing the song.

470
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:20,056
Speaker 1: See, I think one of the reasons that people have so much trouble with learning DDR right away Is that the feedback you get for doing well or doing poorly is not obvious to non gamers and you don't feel Like if you start failing a song this health bar just starts going down and you just get flustered and

471
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:21,019
Speaker 0: quit and people go boo

472
00:33:21,862 --> 00:33:30,285
Speaker 1: Boo, but in this game, there's so much feedback if you miss a note you the song whatever part you were playing Doesn't get played.

473
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:32,212
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's I guess that's cuz.

474
00:33:32,232 --> 00:33:34,238
Speaker 0: DDR is a dancing game and not it.

475
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:44,624
Speaker 1: The feedback is so intuitive that people who even people aren't gamers if they hit the wrong note in the middle of I don't know Led Zeppelin song

476
00:33:44,744 --> 00:33:49,620
Speaker 0: which is there are no Led Zeppelin songs and guitar hero regretfully, which is it which is the only problem with the game.

477
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want stairway in there so badly.

478
00:33:52,249 --> 00:34:00,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as an example and you're doing stairway, let's say and You're playing that opening a little bit and you mess up and you just hear a bad note.

479
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,653
Speaker 0: And then yeah, there's what stairway up like doo doo doo doo doo.

480
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,460
Speaker 0: Sorry, so that we've five notes, right?

481
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,367
Speaker 0: Let's say you don't hit the third note.

482
00:34:07,709 --> 00:34:09,094
Speaker 0: You won't hear doo doo.

483
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:10,199
Speaker 0: You won't hear stairway.

484
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:17,637
Speaker 0: You'll hear doo doo doo doo and you go Oh shit, and like if you just stop if you just stand there you turn on guitar.

485
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:22,420
Speaker 0: here you say, alright I'm gonna do that song and you start playing but you don't do anything.

486
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,367
Speaker 0: You just stand there with your hands in your pockets.

487
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:25,833
Speaker 0: You won't hear shit.

488
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:27,539
Speaker 0: It'll just be quiet and then you'll fail.

489
00:34:28,141 --> 00:34:36,605
Speaker 0: It's pretty without that feature without the fact that you are playing the song and unless you hit all the notes You will not hear the whole song.

490
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,974
Speaker 0: you every note you miss will be missed.

491
00:34:39,395 --> 00:34:40,780
Speaker 0: guitar here wouldn't be half as good.

492
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,099
Speaker 0: That's what makes that game.

493
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:52,940
Speaker 1: Yep Also - because now once you figure the game out and you start playing well You hear the song while you're playing and you feel like you're playing the song and it really feels good.

494
00:34:53,621 --> 00:34:53,922
Speaker 0: That's

495
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:59,199
Speaker 1: like board games for if you even if you're doing something even on an easy easy easy mode You feel like you're playing that song

496
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:07,120
Speaker 0: I'm telling you without that single thing Just that that's half the fun of the whole game is is the fact that you feel like you're playing it.

497
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:08,266
Speaker 0: You know DDR.

498
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,539
Speaker 0: you don't really feel like you're dancing.

499
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:25,069
Speaker 0: You feel like you're playing DDR But guitar hero really makes you feel as well as can be done without some wicked Futuristic ghost in the shell shit that you're a rock star Rocking out on stage.

500
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:28,611
Speaker 1: and I I mean I'm at the point now I can play medium Scott and I both.

501
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:29,637
Speaker 1: we can just play medium songs.

502
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:32,437
Speaker 0: hands down I can play the hard songs that are at the top.

503
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:35,296
Speaker 0: Yeah But the hard songs down near the bottom.

504
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:35,779
Speaker 0: I just die.

505
00:35:36,161 --> 00:35:39,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course then all our friends who've been playing this game for the last few years.

506
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:40,820
Speaker 1: It can are really really good at it.

507
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them are really good.

508
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,842
Speaker 0: If I own the game, I'll become really really good I'm pretty sure.

509
00:35:45,303 --> 00:35:48,472
Speaker 0: but yeah, the easy mode is you know, there's three.

510
00:35:48,552 --> 00:35:53,768
Speaker 0: you only have to use three buttons the top three buttons and You know, but there's still.

511
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,839
Speaker 0: you're still feel like you're playing the song.

512
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way they'll do it like say in easy mode.

513
00:35:58,395 --> 00:35:59,260
Speaker 1: You only have the three buttons.

514
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,844
Speaker 1: So you're playing some guitar solo.

515
00:36:01,366 --> 00:36:03,071
Speaker 1: It'll kind of approximate.

516
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:06,180
Speaker 1: like the notes don't correspond directly to the guitar.

517
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,464
Speaker 0: I can play a lot of notes.

518
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:10,153
Speaker 0: It's only five buttons on this thing.

519
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:12,120
Speaker 0: You cannot play every note a guitar can play.

520
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,580
Speaker 1: So what it'll do is it'll approximate like if the next note or set of notes was going up or higher You'll hit a higher note or a lower note on the thing and it's all relative.

521
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:24,340
Speaker 1: So the same button might play a different note at different parts of the song.

522
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:32,434
Speaker 1: But because it moves relative to the music you still feel like you're playing the song and as you get harder difficulty It just matches the song closer.

523
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:36,691
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It's also a lot of tricks in guitar here that are very forgiving.

524
00:36:36,772 --> 00:36:39,220
Speaker 0: Like let's say the song is green green green.

525
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,364
Speaker 0: What's the next color?

526
00:36:40,424 --> 00:36:41,748
Speaker 0: red red red red?

527
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,792
Speaker 0: You can play.

528
00:36:42,812 --> 00:36:45,240
Speaker 0: you hold down the green button you strum three times.

529
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:52,120
Speaker 0: Then you know the thing you would think in your brain would be just hold down the red button and strum three times.

530
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:57,899
Speaker 0: But actually if you hold down green and red because green is above red It doesn't make a difference whether you hold it down or not.

531
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:05,058
Speaker 0: You could hold green three times then hold and just add the red to it and go three times and stay.

532
00:37:05,118 --> 00:37:05,680
Speaker 0: it's you know.

533
00:37:05,981 --> 00:37:10,900
Speaker 0: And unless there's a chord that'll work as long as you can hold down any button above.

534
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,520
Speaker 0: So let's say it's orange orange orange orange.

535
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:18,458
Speaker 0: You can hold down all five buttons and go strum strum strum strum and that'll hit it.

536
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,510
Speaker 1: Yep, and right along with that.

537
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:26,340
Speaker 1: I mean since it's not DDR It's more like a guitar the strumming mechanism is what triggers it not the frets.

538
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:30,080
Speaker 1: So you can just dick around on the frets all the time as long as you're not doing it when you're strumming.

539
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you can play ahead of time and it just it feels like you're playing a guitar.

540
00:37:34,403 --> 00:37:43,640
Speaker 0: The game also kind of only punishes you if you strum when there's no notes Or if you strum the wrong notes and or if you notes come by and they didn't get strummed.

541
00:37:43,821 --> 00:37:46,115
Speaker 0: That's the three ways that you can mess up now.

542
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:52,510
Speaker 1: because we're tired We'll crack out this a little bit short but suffice to say Guitar heroes is freaking fantastic for all the reasons.

543
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,557
Speaker 1: We mentioned it has good music in it.

544
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:55,580
Speaker 1: It's a great game.

545
00:37:56,042 --> 00:38:00,179
Speaker 1: It's a good game to have around when you're having a party and what else could I really say about it?

546
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,560
Speaker 0: Well, I think there's a couple informational things.

547
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:10,300
Speaker 0: the first thing is that the guitar this the guitar that comes with guitar hero 2 is Significantly better than the guitar that comes with guitar here.

548
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:13,880
Speaker 1: There is no reason to get the guitar hero 1 guitar if you can avoid it.

549
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:23,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, because there's a. basically if you lift the guitar vertically, you know, it does it activates the star mode Which is sort of necessary and helpful in the game.

550
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:28,559
Speaker 0: the guitar hero 1 guitar You got kind of had to shake it about pretty hard to make it do that.

551
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,208
Speaker 0: The guitar hero 2 guitar.

552
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:32,480
Speaker 0: you just lift it up and it activates the star mode.

553
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:38,860
Speaker 0: Also, the whammy bar the guitar hero 2 guitar has a different amount of feedback on it, but that's not a big deal.

554
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:40,107
Speaker 1: It feels a lot better though.

555
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:40,710
Speaker 0: I don't know.

556
00:38:40,791 --> 00:38:42,259
Speaker 0: I didn't really notice the difference with that.

557
00:38:43,621 --> 00:39:07,060
Speaker 0: The other thing guitar hero 2. it's like some of the songs and guitar hero 1, you know you really wish they were in guitar hero 2. obviously they can't fit them on the disc, but And guitar hero 2 has much much better Multiplayer so much better that the guitar hero 1 multiplayer is basically useless Which is kind of sad because you want to play some guitar hero 1 songs in the good guitar hero 2 multiplayer.

558
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you can play competitively you can play cooperatively There's all sorts of stuff.

559
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:16,863
Speaker 1: co-op mode is the one that gets played most breaks it up also into like lead and rhythm or lead And bass.

560
00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:29,339
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and they're all different and I actually really enjoy playing bass Yep, but yeah, the co-op mode is definitely where the action is, you know The playing the versus mode isn't really that fun because everyone knows who's better than who else.

561
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:32,695
Speaker 0: so You know who's gonna win isn't gonna change too often.

562
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:39,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, well just like in DDR I mean none of us at least and most of the people we know ever bothered actually competing with each other on DDR.

563
00:39:40,302 --> 00:39:42,653
Speaker 1: We just would both play DDR next to each other for fun.

564
00:39:42,955 --> 00:39:45,706
Speaker 0: Yep, and What else is difference?

565
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:49,180
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah guitar hero 2 is has is significantly harder.

566
00:39:49,341 --> 00:40:08,161
Speaker 0: Well, it's not harder all across the board But if you're looking for the extended difficulty if you're the master of guitar hero 1 there is stuff waiting for you in guitar hero 2. so if you're looking to you know Build up the skills and become the master beat all of guitar hero 1 and then go to guitar hero 2 and then you will Master that as well.
