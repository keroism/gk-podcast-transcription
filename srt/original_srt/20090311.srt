1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,762
Speaker 2: It's Wednesday, March 11th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,810
Speaker 2: Tonight, Urasawa's Pluto.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,950
Speaker 2: So I'm walking back to our work from Brian Park.

5
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:45,530
Speaker 2: I was outside taking a long lunch, enjoying myself, and taking a break, and I suddenly hear a noise so distinct and so full of memories from earlier in my life that I had to stop.

6
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,810
Speaker 2: Now, there was no tribes 2 turret coming out of the ground to get me.

7
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:52,235
Speaker 2: But what happened?

8
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,424
Speaker 2: I'm walking and I hear this sound and I had to stop.

9
00:00:54,564 --> 00:01:00,584
Speaker 2: I stopped dead in my tracks because I knew at that moment that an angel was descending to destroy the earth.

10
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:06,440
Speaker 2: You know that industrial like from Ava that they play in like every episode.

11
00:01:06,842 --> 00:01:08,930
Speaker 2: It's that periodic like tamping.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,430
Speaker 2: It's like this generic industrial noise, but Ava had a very specific one.

13
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:22,220
Speaker 2: I heard that exact noise, and I'm like alright, and I look around because maybe I'll find out what that sound was like what pulley they did or what they recorded.

14
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,976
Speaker 1: Someone was watching Ava on a laptop with a little speaker.

15
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:32,226
Speaker 2: It looks like they had guys hammering something into an I-beam about ten stories up on the skyscraper.

16
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:32,929
Speaker 2: I was walking by.

17
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,859
Speaker 2: So I heard the Ava noise, but that's I don't know.

18
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,010
Speaker 2: That's the most relevant anime related anecdote I've got.

19
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:42,178
Speaker 1: I don't even know what noise you're talking about.

20
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:42,841
Speaker 2: You really don't?

21
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,487
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe if it was cicadas.

22
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:45,190
Speaker 1: I'd be like ah.

23
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,363
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't the cicadas.

24
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:50,649
Speaker 2: It was like the generic banging industrial noise from Ava.

25
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:51,811
Speaker 2: They use it.

26
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:54,463
Speaker 2: It seems like they use that noise a lot more later in the series.

27
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:55,306
Speaker 1: The thing is right.

28
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:58,197
Speaker 1: whenever I watch like an anime, and they have the cicada noise.

29
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:01,950
Speaker 1: I'm like okay, but like my grandma lived in Queens.

30
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,821
Speaker 1: You know if I would like sleep over there in the summer.

31
00:02:04,841 --> 00:02:06,990
Speaker 1: I would hear the cicadas in the morning.

32
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,716
Speaker 1: They didn't sound like that at all.

33
00:02:08,735 --> 00:02:11,250
Speaker 1: So I don't know if it's a Japanese cicadas sound different.

34
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,194
Speaker 1: That's what I was going to say.

35
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:14,041
Speaker 1: It's probably a different kind.

36
00:02:14,383 --> 00:02:17,395
Speaker 2: In fact the cicadas where I grew up don't sound like the cicadas here.

37
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:18,078
Speaker 1: Really?

38
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,910
Speaker 2: I mean, maybe it wasn't cicadas, but yeah.

39
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,259
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's any right here.

40
00:02:22,279 --> 00:02:23,889
Speaker 1: I know there's some in Queens.

41
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,787
Speaker 2: Yeah, I haven't really heard them in Beacon that much now that I think about it.

42
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,599
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess the room of goth is empty.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,750
Speaker 1: Instead here I hear I hear thought birds.

44
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,502
Speaker 2: You know if you ever climb Breakneck Ridge, there's a lot of them out there.

45
00:02:38,004 --> 00:02:39,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, thought bird what you gonna do?

46
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:45,130
Speaker 2: All right, so it's anime day, manga day, comic day, news day.

47
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:47,478
Speaker 1: Oh, there's some good news going down.

48
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,090
Speaker 2: Good as in interesting or good as in actually good.

49
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:55,550
Speaker 2: Because the anime industry has not been, shall we say, replete with good news.

50
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,365
Speaker 1: This is pretty good news if you're smart.

51
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,530
Speaker 1: This is excellent news.

52
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:02,569
Speaker 1: I don't know if you're gonna be able to handle this news.

53
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,577
Speaker 2: Well, it can't be that Sanctuary, Eagle and every manga I've ever liked is being re-released and I'm getting a copy for free.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,467
Speaker 1: But close.

55
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:12,090
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

56
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,458
Speaker 1: Pokemon is originally...

57
00:03:16,538 --> 00:03:16,959
Speaker 2: Oh, snap!

58
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:20,590
Speaker 2: I'm gonna get to read about red again and yellow.

59
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,282
Speaker 1: So Pokemon was originally a Game Boy game.

60
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:26,530
Speaker 1: That was the first Pokemon thing ever, right?

61
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,735
Speaker 1: Because there's a lot of Pokemon stuff.

62
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:31,690
Speaker 1: There's an anime, there's toys, there's video games, right?

63
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,470
Speaker 1: The Game Boy games, Red and Blue or Red and Green or whatever, were the original.

64
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,090
Speaker 1: That was the first Pokemon thing there ever was.

65
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,750
Speaker 2: Now what's scary is that one, that was both a long time ago and at the same time, not that long ago.

66
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,672
Speaker 1: I know, right?

67
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:52,250
Speaker 1: It's like I was already sort of too old for Pokemon when it appeared and yet it's still around.

68
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:04,610
Speaker 2: Well, the other thing that amazes me is that if you ask people how long they've been fans of Pokemon, especially people in our age group, people feel like it's hard to remember when Pokemon appeared.

69
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,370
Speaker 2: You feel as though it's always been there.

70
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,072
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about it, right?

71
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:13,310
Speaker 1: There have been all these sort of like, you know, there are always fads for kids, right?

72
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,762
Speaker 1: You know, like, "Oh, we're all into, you know, micro-machines.

73
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,868
Speaker 1: Our micro-machines are gone

74
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:17,947
Speaker 1: now.".

75
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,129
Speaker 2: Or Centurions.

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,512
Speaker 1: "He-mans are gone.

77
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,783
Speaker 1: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and things like that.

78
00:04:22,944 --> 00:04:24,330
Speaker 1: Transformers are only for nerds.

79
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,201
Speaker 1: Regular kids don't like those anymore.

80
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:26,624
Speaker 1: so much,

81
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:26,866
Speaker 1: right?".

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,870
Speaker 1: But Barbie and Hot Wheels are sort of the always there since like the '50s or even earlier than that, right?

83
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,310
Speaker 2: I think Pokemon is going to be there.

84
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,630
Speaker 1: Wasn't Barbie's anniversary just like somewhat recently?

85
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:37,916
Speaker 1: Yeah.

86
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,258
Speaker 1: But Pokemon has sort of beat them all.

87
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:48,010
Speaker 1: It's Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Pokemon I think is the other one that's just going to last forever.

88
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,993
Speaker 2: I mean, I remember- Like infinity.

89
00:04:50,053 --> 00:04:54,030
Speaker 1: Like your great, great grandchildren will still have Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Pokemon.

90
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:05,073
Speaker 1: They may be Sesame Street also, but everything else, well, you know, He-Man, Ninja Turtles, Transformers, you know, I guess Lego, but Lego is not really- Yeah.

91
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,870
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

92
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:08,729
Speaker 2: It's real easy to hold 10 Lego.

93
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:11,730
Speaker 1: But anyway.

94
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,491
Speaker 2: Alright, so we're going to get to read about red and yellow and- So, yes.

95
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,701
Speaker 1: The original Pokemon was a Game Boy game.

96
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:22,189
Speaker 1: However, there was a Pokemon manga.

97
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:29,850
Speaker 1: Well, actually, there were many Pokemon mangas, but there was one Pokemon manga in particular.

98
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:38,450
Speaker 1: It was called Pokemon, well, Pocket to Monster Special in Japan, but in the United States, it's Pokemon Adventures.

99
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:54,130
Speaker 1: Now, Pokemon Adventures was released in English a long time ago by Viz, and it was sort of like in these comic book sized books, but they had cardboard covers as opposed to sort of flimsy covers, and they were flat bound as opposed to staple bound.

100
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,796
Speaker 2: Well, Luke had them back at RIT.

101
00:05:55,816 --> 00:05:58,610
Speaker 2: That's the only reason I was able to read them was that he owned like all of these things.

102
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,580
Speaker 1: There were a whole bunch of them, and it was a little bit expensive to get them.

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,370
Speaker 1: They really felt like kids coloring books more than like manga.

104
00:06:05,351 --> 00:06:11,890
Speaker 1: But you could get them, and they're hard to get now, that particular format, but this manga was released in English.

105
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:22,250
Speaker 1: Viz, in like two or three months, is going to re-release this manga under the Viz kids line in sort of the normal format.

106
00:06:24,312 --> 00:06:26,082
Speaker 1: This is going to be like $7 cover price for a volume.

107
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:28,530
Speaker 1: This is some serious business.

108
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,210
Speaker 1: So I'm going to pay like $5.

109
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,450
Speaker 2: Because, I mean, you know about Ash Ketchum and the Pokemon rap?

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,672
Speaker 2: Who?

111
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:35,630
Speaker 2: What are you talking about?

112
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:38,680
Speaker 2: And Team Rocket blast away again.

113
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:41,570
Speaker 2: That is like this bastard child of Pokemon.

114
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,073
Speaker 1: I want to read to you a quote.

115
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:50,470
Speaker 1: This is a quote from Satoshi Tajiri, who is the original creator of all Pokemon, right?

116
00:06:51,051 --> 00:07:00,327
Speaker 1: And he says about this, this is what he has to say about this manga, quote, "This is the comic that most resembles the world I was trying to

117
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:00,808
Speaker 1: convey.".

118
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:01,970
Speaker 1: End quote.

119
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,970
Speaker 2: Now, it's actually a pretty good, I mean, it's a kid's manga, but it's good.

120
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,610
Speaker 1: Even if you don't like Pokemon, you don't care about Pokemon at all, you think it's kid's crap, you know, whatever.

121
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,097
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

122
00:07:16,217 --> 00:07:19,030
Speaker 1: This manga, this is the serious business.

123
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:20,917
Speaker 1: This is the real deal.

124
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,770
Speaker 1: This is not, you know, about catching them all, all right?

125
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,130
Speaker 1: This is not about cutesy monsters and, you know, battles of powering up and shit.

126
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,409
Speaker 2: Granted, it's still not Shadow Star.

127
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,349
Speaker 1: No, it's not Shadow Star either.

128
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,050
Speaker 1: But, I mean, look, there is stuff that happens in this manga.

129
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,570
Speaker 1: I mean, there was a scene where someone's hand got chopped off by a dangerous Pokemon, you know?

130
00:07:41,334 --> 00:07:43,309
Speaker 1: I think that was the most hardcore moment in the whole thing.

131
00:07:44,232 --> 00:07:49,930
Speaker 1: But, yeah, ignore all those other Pokemon things, like Mystery Dungeon manga, fuck that shit.

132
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,850
Speaker 1: You know, Diamond and Pearl manga, fuck that shit, right?

133
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,350
Speaker 1: Pokemon Adventures, when this hits, you gotta pick that up.

134
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,950
Speaker 1: And it's mad, mad cheap, so you have no excuse.

135
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:15,570
Speaker 2: It's just, Ash is such a pale imitation of Red, and then they, I mean, I'm not gonna spoil this, but they pull a big change-up up when you're reading this, and stuff happens that you might not have expected.

136
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, it nominally is the same story as the original Pokemon, you know, game.

137
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,510
Speaker 1: You know, Pokemon Red, you know, the very, very original one.

138
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:30,290
Speaker 1: It's nominally that story, but it's also not that story.

139
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:35,950
Speaker 1: So don't think that you already know everything that's gonna go down, because you do not.

140
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:42,049
Speaker 2: But, moving right along, as you all know, we're gonna be attending Anime Boston for the first time this year.

141
00:08:42,732 --> 00:08:45,349
Speaker 2: May 22nd through 24th, I think, yeah, that sounds about right.

142
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,830
Speaker 2: We're gonna be there, doing a bunch of panels, being guests, hanging out.

143
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:53,430
Speaker 2: We'll be around, I'll be hanging out in bars in Boston the whole weekend, so.

144
00:08:54,411 --> 00:09:01,230
Speaker 2: If you wanna see us, come to Anime Boston, it's a good con, it'll be our first time there, but they just announced the musical guest of Anime Boston.

145
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:09,249
Speaker 2: And this is the kind of thing where, had we not been going to Anime Boston in a geek night's capacity, I might have been tempted to just go.

146
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:14,310
Speaker 2: The musical guest is going to be Kalafina and Yuki Kajira.

147
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,890
Speaker 2: If you don't know who that is, Noir, Dot Hack Sign, the music to those animes.

148
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,130
Speaker 1: Basically all the terrible animes with amazing music.

149
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,230
Speaker 2: Yeah, so if you wanna hear amazing music without having to deal with the terrible anime that they were associated with.

150
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,180
Speaker 1: Does it actually mean performance?

151
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,170
Speaker 1: It's not just an appearance?

152
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,270
Speaker 2: Actually, let me read this whole article, cause I got home kinda late.

153
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,650
Speaker 2: But yeah, the singing trio's gonna be there, and the composer.

154
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:36,787
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

155
00:09:38,294 --> 00:09:39,388
Speaker 2: I'm pretty excited about this.

156
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could be pretty hot right there.

157
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,850
Speaker 2: Especially since I didn't get to go to the concert at Otacon, because we were doing a panel during it.

158
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,330
Speaker 1: Well, we went to one of the concerts, but not the other one.

159
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,390
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we went to THE concert at Otacon.

160
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,770
Speaker 2: You know, Lark, way back, so I guess it's all good.

161
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went to a bunch of those THE concerts.

162
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,150
Speaker 2: Yeah, but nothing's really topped Lark yet.

163
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,006
Speaker 1: No, we missed those Eurobeat girls.

164
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:03,500
Speaker 1: In '02.

165
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:05,350
Speaker 2: Oh my god.

166
00:10:05,631 --> 00:10:06,007
Speaker 1: Seven years ago.

167
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,648
Speaker 2: We've been going- SEVEN YEARS!

168
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:09,606
Speaker 2: Okay.

169
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:20,830
Speaker 2: But that aside, I just wanna point out, this is kind of a mini news, but it looks like... I don't know what's going on on Cartoon Network, but Naruto... Looks like they're dropping it, as far as I can tell.

170
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,788
Speaker 1: Didn't they drop Toonami?

171
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:28,110
Speaker 2: It looks like things are really changing up, and it looks like anime is getting shorter and shorter of a shrift.

172
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:33,430
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Naruto, you can watch for free on the internets, legitimately, at all these places.

173
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,370
Speaker 1: Like, you know, the day after it's out in Japan.

174
00:10:36,932 --> 00:10:38,710
Speaker 2: Yup, and subtitled, no less.

175
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know why Cartoon Network could even bother to continue to show it.

176
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:51,218
Speaker 1: I mean, really, they should only put Naruto on, unlike, you know, the kids' afternoon cartoon pro- Oh wait, everyone eliminated.

177
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:54,510
Speaker 1: the kids got home from school afternoon cartoon block.

178
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now instead they keep trying to put shows like- They don't even have Saturday morning or Sunday morning cartoons anymore.

179
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,770
Speaker 2: They keep trying to put shows like this on, like, Adult Swim, where anyone who's gonna be watching Adult Swim is just gonna go online anyway.

180
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:18,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what really happened to Adult Swim is that you sort of had this competition between bringing awesome shows, you know, from around the world to, you know, to people, you know, regardless of who made them.

181
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:24,590
Speaker 1: With the simultaneous Cartoon Network's own productions sort of having to compete with that.

182
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,350
Speaker 1: And they had to sort of pick, are they gonna go with these animes, are they gonna go with, you know, the stuff they make?

183
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:34,290
Speaker 1: And they decided to go with the stuff they make, rather than, you know, like the robot chickens and that sort of stuff.

184
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:41,330
Speaker 2: For a lot of reasons, and I don't want to get into it, but it's interesting how this fight is, it's all just kind of falling apart.

185
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:51,050
Speaker 2: I think anime- Remember when Nickelodeon used to be awesome?

186
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:56,890
Speaker 1: Well, I think Nickelodeon had sort of the same problem MTV did, in which it just completely lost its identity, right?

187
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,919
Speaker 1: MTV used to be music videos.

188
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,507
Speaker 1: Now it's like game shows all day, isn't it?

189
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:01,150
Speaker 1: I think.

190
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:02,710
Speaker 1: Game shows and reality shows.

191
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,732
Speaker 1: That's what I hear, right?

192
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:09,550
Speaker 1: So, Nickelodeon was originally, like, you know, awesome, just like kids crazy shit all day.

193
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,077
Speaker 1: I mean, remember.

194
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:10,548
Speaker 1: Remember.

195
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,190
Speaker 1: Then they had the Nicktoons and they were rocking the house.

196
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,250
Speaker 2: You can't do that on television.

197
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,910
Speaker 1: Well, actually, Nickelodeon, I don't think, man, I think that was originally a Canadian show.

198
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,287
Speaker 2: No, but they got it, and they put it on, and that's the same thing as anime.

199
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:31,910
Speaker 1: No, but Nick Nickelodeon also made lots of good stuff, too, like Clarissa Explains It All, and Snick was alright, remember that?

200
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:32,668
Speaker 1: I remember that.

201
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,930
Speaker 1: And, you know, all the other Nicktoons, the Ren & Stimpies and all that stuff, and Doug and Rugrats, they made all those.

202
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,666
Speaker 2: Of course, we definitely have to clarify the old Nickelodeon Ren & Stimpy, because as we learned later- It's still good.

203
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,150
Speaker 2: It wasn't a great show, but it had its moments.

204
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,088
Speaker 1: It had a lot of moments.

205
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, because you turn the page, and then you wash your hands, and then you turn the page, and then you wash your hands.

206
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:04,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, but, you know, it's like these networks lost their identities, and Cartoon Network also seems to be losing its identity, right?

207
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:12,870
Speaker 1: It used to be about cartoons all day long, and now I heard that they were, like, showed this, like, a live-action Spider-Man movie instead of Toonami when Toonami was over.

208
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,544
Speaker 1: It's like, "Whoa,

209
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:15,028
Speaker 1: really?".

210
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,610
Speaker 1: And now they have, like, Boomerang.

211
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:18,610
Speaker 1: That's all these networks are doing.

212
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,790
Speaker 1: Like, MTV made MTV2, where they put the music videos, right?

213
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,830
Speaker 2: But then watch, MTV2 is gonna start having the reality shows.

214
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:34,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, then Nickelodeon makes, like, another channel to put the cartoons on, and then, you know, Disney Channel makes another channel where they stick all the cartoons, and Cartoon Network makes Boomerang, where they put all the cartoons.

215
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,530
Speaker 1: It's like, "Yeah, we lost our identity on our main network.

216
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:43,709
Speaker 1: Let's make another network where we put the stuff that the original network was supposed to be," you know?

217
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:56,210
Speaker 1: And it's like, I really think that there's room now for someone to come out with an actual, a new TV network that actually has good kids programming, you know?

218
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:59,130
Speaker 1: And you sort of follow the same Nickelodeon formula, right?

219
00:13:59,511 --> 00:14:04,790
Speaker 1: You need to have, like, two good shows, like, at, like, six in the morning before the kids go to school, right?

220
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,770
Speaker 1: You can watch them while you eat breakfast.

221
00:14:07,212 --> 00:14:10,908
Speaker 1: Then you show shows for preschoolers, like, all day, right?

222
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,030
Speaker 1: And the kids who set to stay home from school watch it anyway.

223
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,350
Speaker 2: Yep, then you got the two-hour block, right, when the kids get home.

224
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,730
Speaker 1: No, you need the four-hour block when you get home before dinner, right?

225
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:26,830
Speaker 2: Well, demographic-wise, I mean, look, usually there's the staggered thing where elementary school kids get home first, then middle school, so you start with the show.

226
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,550
Speaker 2: Like, remember Cartoon Network, like, you'd start with Sailor Moon, and then the Dragon Ball.

227
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:39,730
Speaker 1: And then they went into Sailor Moon, and then they went into Voltron, and then, you know, and then it was, like, by four o'clock, you were in Batman.

228
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:45,070
Speaker 1: But then, like, from five to something, right, when people are eating dinner, you show Looney Tunes.

229
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,321
Speaker 1: That way, you know, it's, like, Looney Tunes stops to eat dinner.

230
00:14:48,341 --> 00:14:49,625
Speaker 1: You come back, another one started.

231
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,070
Speaker 1: You're somewhere in there, right?

232
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,556
Speaker 2: And then, Nick at Night.

233
00:14:52,636 --> 00:14:54,103
Speaker 2: Nick at Night was a brilliant idea.

234
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:55,027
Speaker 2: I don't know if they still do it.

235
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:55,730
Speaker 2: Do they still show it?

236
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,590
Speaker 1: It has its own network, I think, again.

237
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,768
Speaker 2: But that doesn't work.

238
00:14:59,350 --> 00:14:59,548
Speaker 2: No shit.

239
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:00,292
Speaker 2: I don't know.

240
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,982
Speaker 2: There's something wrong.

241
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:05,330
Speaker 2: If you're watching Dragnet, and the sun is still up.

242
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:06,329
Speaker 1: I know, right?

243
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:17,550
Speaker 1: That is a show for 4 a.m But what I would do is I would probably put, like, you know, the old cartoons on all night, you know, or I would just put, like, the hardcore shit on all night.

244
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:18,047
Speaker 2: Or both.

245
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,530
Speaker 1: Like, Mazinger and shit.

246
00:15:19,691 --> 00:15:20,330
Speaker 2: Late at night, yeah.

247
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,530
Speaker 1: Fist of the North Star, Bustin' Off Heads.

248
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,430
Speaker 2: Have the original Astro Boy, and then, like, Mazinger, and then, like, I don't know.

249
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be like, going to Guy would be all night long.

250
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,310
Speaker 1: That would be my network.

251
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,014
Speaker 1: Maybe we should do that.

252
00:15:31,034 --> 00:15:34,590
Speaker 1: Be like, what would be on your, you know, schedule your TV network.

253
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:46,410
Speaker 1: You can choose any show that has ever existed, you know, from all the shows in the history of television in any country in the world that have ever existed, you know, schedule, you know, your programming day.

254
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,234
Speaker 1: Let's make a game about it.

255
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:50,110
Speaker 2: I'll make a thread in the forum, and we'll pick a winner next Wednesday.

256
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:51,862
Speaker 2: You're not winning a prize.

257
00:15:51,882 --> 00:15:52,468
Speaker 2: I've given up on that.

258
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:58,230
Speaker 1: Actually, what we have to do here, you have to invent, like, a whole TV network, give it a name, you know, the whole, you have to just do the whole thing.

259
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,469
Speaker 2: Yep, we'll put the details.

260
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,393
Speaker 1: Maybe you even have to do the whole week.

261
00:16:00,614 --> 00:16:03,907
Speaker 1: Why not the whole, you know, or I guess weekday, Saturday, and Sunday.

262
00:16:03,927 --> 00:16:04,710
Speaker 1: You need three schedules.

263
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:06,965
Speaker 2: Yep, we'll put the details in the forum.

264
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:07,469
Speaker 2: Check it out.

265
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,120
Speaker 2: So, things of the day.

266
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:26,596
Speaker 2: I'm trying to avoid doing an anime thing, because I feel like I gotta break from the routine and have stuff that's cross-interest on the things of the day, so there's always something for you.

267
00:16:26,616 --> 00:16:40,520
Speaker 2: Otherwise... Well, I have three saved up, but the problem is two of them are good AMVs that people forgot about, and I feel like I gotta really save those for, like, bottom of the barrel.

268
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:52,018
Speaker 2: And the third one, I just want to save, so... A while ago, I think I talked about this, I didn't make it a thing of the day, but there's something about the lyrics to songs from the 80s and 90s.

269
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:53,720
Speaker 1: They're really bad?

270
00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,414
Speaker 2: Yeah, like, really good songs, but if you actually listen to the lyrics, it's not even that they're bad or asinine.

271
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,077
Speaker 0: They're terrible!

272
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:03,400
Speaker 2: Like, they're painful!

273
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:04,652
Speaker 1: Yep.

274
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:12,888
Speaker 2: But imagine if you took old songs like "White Wedding" or "Take On Me" and just changed the lyrics.

275
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:21,240
Speaker 2: Do the song exactly the same, but change the lyrics to just say, literally, what is going on in the associated music video to the song.

276
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,007
Speaker 1: Oh my god, if you did that, what if you did that, like, sledgehammer?

277
00:17:24,027 --> 00:17:26,794
Speaker 1: You'd be like, "Bunch of shit movin' around!

278
00:17:26,993 --> 00:17:28,077
Speaker 1: Bunch of shit movin'

279
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:28,438
Speaker 1: around!".

280
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,206
Speaker 1: "Oh, weird imagery!

281
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:32,028
Speaker 1: Weird imagery!

282
00:17:32,108 --> 00:17:34,516
Speaker 1: Playing with the special effects on the video machine!

283
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:35,499
Speaker 1: Playing with the special

284
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:35,900
Speaker 1: effects!".

285
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,197
Speaker 2: Of all these, pretty much the best one, 'cause there's a guy doing a ton of this stuff, the best one is "White

286
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:42,558
Speaker 2: Wedding.".

287
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:48,811
Speaker 2: I found this so hilarious, it was painful.

288
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,060
Speaker 2: Because it's time for a cool glove, and that room is dangerous.

289
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:55,117
Speaker 1: Cool glove.

290
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,838
Speaker 2: Seriously, check this out.

291
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,799
Speaker 1: Did you know that there is some sort of Blue Mountain Dew now?

292
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:02,600
Speaker 1: What?

293
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,553
Speaker 1: There's an ad for it on the webpage.

294
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:05,480
Speaker 1: that is my thing of the day.

295
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,380
Speaker 1: Well, there's a Red Bull Cola that actually- It's like Mountain Dew Voltage, it's like a bright blue.

296
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,480
Speaker 2: That can't be good.

297
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:12,940
Speaker 1: It's kinda scary looking, anyway.

298
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,280
Speaker 2: Well, there's a Red Bull Cola.

299
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,140
Speaker 1: The thing of the day, which just happens to be on this page with the Mountain Dew ad that's not blocked, 'cause it's like the background of the site, it's one of those.

300
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,039
Speaker 2: Ah, I hate those.

301
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

302
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:25,269
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what this is, is, I don't know, do you remember?

303
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,620
Speaker 1: a while back, someone drew, like, the sort of the Watchmen Peanuts character mashup?

304
00:18:31,102 --> 00:18:32,312
Speaker 2: Oh, I know what you're using.

305
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:33,300
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was pretty good.

306
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:33,940
Speaker 1: Oh, you saw this?

307
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:34,478
Speaker 2: I saw this.

308
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:44,398
Speaker 2: Somebody basically drew two pages of Sin City, but it's- Oh, I thought you were gonna do, someone animated the Watchmen as though it were a 90s cartoon.

309
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:45,665
Speaker 1: No, screw that.

310
00:18:45,705 --> 00:18:46,412
Speaker 1: That was stupid, heck.

311
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,140
Speaker 1: I don't like that, heck.

312
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:47,618
Speaker 1: I liked it.

313
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,399
Speaker 1: No, I thought it was dumb.

314
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,920
Speaker 1: This, someone drew, was basically two pages of Sin City, but it's Schulz City.

315
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,438
Speaker 1: That yellow shirt, it's such and such.

316
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:57,819
Speaker 2: Not bad.

317
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:08,120
Speaker 2: But tonight, surprisingly, we're actually talking about something relatively new, as in we only have one volume of it, so it's kind of a preview, as opposed to the usual review.

318
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,108
Speaker 0: It's actually- It's new, and it's old.

319
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:13,380
Speaker 0: It's that dichotomy there.

320
00:19:13,961 --> 00:19:22,020
Speaker 1: It's old, and it's super, it's old, because it was only released here recently, even though it came out in Japan a while ago.

321
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's based on something- It's based on something even older.

322
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:30,040
Speaker 0: Old, old, incredibly old television show and manga.

323
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Speaker 2: We've also got an Emily here, but it is Takashi, oops, sorry, I was reading the co-authored line.

324
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:43,900
Speaker 2: Anyway, it's Pluto, Urasawa's Pluto, which is based on two episodes, well, a story arc from Astro Boy.

325
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:54,400
Speaker 1: Right, I'm pretty sure it was a story arc in the original manga, and I'm pretty sure it was a story arc that was in the original 60s anime, and I definitely know that the story arc was re-.

326
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:04,240
Speaker 1: You know, it's basically every time they make a new iteration of Astro Boy, right, the 80s anime, and I don't know about the 2004 anime, but they retold this story, right?

327
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:18,520
Speaker 0: Wasn't there a blurb in the back of the manga about, like, written by the guy who's saying they were doing that series of episodes for the most recent Astro Boy television show when he was reading this manga?

328
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,519
Speaker 1: Maybe, I don't know, I didn't read it.

329
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,580
Speaker 2: Oh, Scott, there's a long interview in the back.

330
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got a lot of stuff about the authors and, you know, notes by the translators and stuff, kind of giving some backstory.

331
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:42,680
Speaker 0: So, the interesting thing about this is they have both seen these episodes, but I haven't watched the Astro Boy episodes that it makes reference to, so we're kind of coming at it from different angles here.

332
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:51,520
Speaker 1: Well, I think that was sort of the point, is that, like, I saw those two episodes of Astro Boy, like, coincidentally, because we just happened to be watching the show, right?

333
00:20:51,901 --> 00:21:01,520
Speaker 1: And it was, like, this two-part story, so I knew it was a big deal, and so we watched those, and then, coincidentally, Pluto just happened to show up, and I didn't even know.

334
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:12,700
Speaker 1: I knew Pluto was a retelling of some Astro Boy stuff, but I didn't realize it was that until I realized the robot's name was Pluto, because in the '80s, any dub of the '80s anime, they call him Bluton.

335
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,062
Speaker 0: Oh!

336
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,040
Speaker 2: Or Bruton, or something.

337
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:16,940
Speaker 1: Bruton, like he's a brute.

338
00:21:17,343 --> 00:21:18,695
Speaker 1: But I'm like, "Huh, that must be

339
00:21:18,756 --> 00:21:19,099
Speaker 1: Pluto.".

340
00:21:19,341 --> 00:21:22,976
Speaker 1: And then, when the manga, like, happened to show up, like, a week later, I was like, "Oh,

341
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:23,438
Speaker 1: shit!".

342
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:31,440
Speaker 0: But I don't know why they call them Bruton, because in the manga, they're talking about, like, Pluto, god of death, and it makes so much more sense.

343
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the dub is very, very simplifying.

344
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:46,970
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was because the anime was much more simplified, or if the original... You know, I mean, this is odd, the Naoki Urasawa interpretation is obviously a lot more complicated and deep than the original.

345
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,029
Speaker 2: Well, the original...

346
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:54,050
Speaker 1: Tezuka, as great as he was, you know, Astro Boy was not... Well, it was just a substory, you know?

347
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,470
Speaker 2: If you put out that much manga, not everything's a winner.

348
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,046
Speaker 1: Well, no.

349
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,447
Speaker 1: I mean, I have some bad Tezuka, if you want.

350
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:05,230
Speaker 2: Yes, but, like, episodes of Astro Boy, or story arcs of Astro Boy, come and go.

351
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:13,590
Speaker 0: You cannot blame that fan-fiction, blackjack, everybody-shows-up, cross-universes episode on Tezuka.

352
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,224
Speaker 2: I can't blame that on Tezuka.

353
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:15,590
Speaker 2: Here's why.

354
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:16,490
Speaker 2: No, I can't blame that.

355
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:16,946
Speaker 2: Here's why.

356
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:17,643
Speaker 2: He was alive.

357
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,190
Speaker 2: No, I blame it on him, because Princess Knight never really ended.

358
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,301
Speaker 2: So, that was the end.

359
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:25,429
Speaker 2: Someone had to do it.

360
00:22:25,951 --> 00:22:28,128
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, that's, like, the worst ending ever, though.

361
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:28,771
Speaker 1: It is.

362
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:32,910
Speaker 1: No, but actually, you know, I have read a lot of older Tezuka.

363
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:39,690
Speaker 1: Like, some of the stuff Dark Horse has put out, like, Lost World, or even Tezuka's Metropolis, right?

364
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,590
Speaker 1: Or Next World.

365
00:22:42,192 --> 00:22:43,729
Speaker 1: Next World is pretty bad.

366
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:45,869
Speaker 1: It's not good.

367
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:50,370
Speaker 1: They could have chosen a lot better Tezukas to bring over than Next World, all right?

368
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,750
Speaker 1: And I guess it was an early work, and it has historical significance, but, you know, it's not... I mean, and Astro Boy, the original manga, like, some of it's good.

369
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,689
Speaker 1: Like, the one with, you know, the X-shaped aliens holding the lasers, you know, that one's good, but...

370
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,310
Speaker 2: Well, that's, like, the best episode of the '80s Astro Boy.

371
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,209
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but, I mean, some of them, not so good.

372
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:18,349
Speaker 0: Well, you figure, especially prolific geniuses, they have really, really strong work, and some of their work, in comparison, is a little weaker.

373
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:21,550
Speaker 1: Well, I think with Tezuka, it's mostly the early work is no good, you know?

374
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,290
Speaker 1: It's like, he just happened to get published before he was God.

375
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:26,550
Speaker 1: It was like he was still demigod, but they started publishing.

376
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,810
Speaker 1: They didn't wait till it was hatched.

377
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,374
Speaker 0: Then you should look at it.

378
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:42,630
Speaker 0: See, you have this thing where, like, you just want to do stuff perfectly right away, and this is, like, a perfect example of why that theory never works, because even Tezuka had to start somewhere.

379
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:54,164
Speaker 0: Like, he was obviously very talented, even at the get-go, but you do see a maturation in any artist's work, and so you should look to him for guidance when you're all like, "I want to make videos perfect,".

380
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:56,230
Speaker 0: right, from the first day.

381
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:04,950
Speaker 0: So, anyway, I really enjoyed the manga, even without the background information there.

382
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,570
Speaker 2: Well, it definitely had a lot of -- I guess I had more impact, because Scott knew what it was, and he gave it to me.

383
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,950
Speaker 2: He walks in, and he's like, "Rim, read this," and I'm like, "Okay," and I add it to my pile of things I've got to read.

384
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,154
Speaker 2: He's like, "No, read

385
00:24:16,174 --> 00:24:16,214
Speaker 2: it.".

386
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:21,450
Speaker 2: So I'm like, "All right, all right," and I flip through it, and page six, I see Mont Blanc, the word.

387
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,106
Speaker 2: I think, "Huh, Mont Blanc, yeah, that was that robot in that

388
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:24,468
Speaker 2: S-word.".

389
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:25,450
Speaker 0: Oh, that was sad.

390
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:28,315
Speaker 2: And then I read page seven, "All right, there's a murder

391
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:28,675
Speaker 2: mystery.".

392
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:32,262
Speaker 2: Page eight, "Oh, Mont Blanc.

393
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,188
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what that

394
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:35,248
Speaker 1: is.".

395
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:50,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I thought it was kind of interesting, because it's really -- the artist who draws it, the guy who did this adaptation, is the same guy who did Monster and Master Keaton and everything.

396
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:51,779
Speaker 1: Did he draw it?

397
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,550
Speaker 1: I mean, I know he drew Monster.

398
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:54,856
Speaker 0: It's obvious.

399
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:55,840
Speaker 0: Look at the style.

400
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:59,387
Speaker 1: The style's really, really -- Isn't there someone else's name on the cover?

401
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,850
Speaker 2: Takashi Nagasaki is the co-author, and there's also Makoto Tezuka supervised.

402
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,977
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's kind of a collaboration.

403
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:16,830
Speaker 0: I assume that he was the primary creative force behind this retelling.

404
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,210
Speaker 1: I'm also pretty sure he is the primary creative force.

405
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,074
Speaker 2: In the back, there's a little timeline.

406
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:26,808
Speaker 2: It's like, "1928, Osamu Tezuka, the genius who would eventually become known as the god of manga, is

407
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:27,108
Speaker 2: born.".

408
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:33,789
Speaker 2: "1951, Tezuka creates a narrative set in a futurist society about a boy robot whose machine body houses a

409
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:33,950
Speaker 2: soul.".

410
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:34,830
Speaker 1: You don't need to read the whole thing.

411
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,050
Speaker 2: You sound so angry.

412
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,290
Speaker 2: There's only three items in this timeline.

413
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:38,986
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.

414
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,715
Speaker 2: "Children throughout Japan go wild over the story.

415
00:25:41,715 --> 00:25:48,009
Speaker 2: 2003, Naoki Urasawa challenges himself to create the ultimate tribute to the god of

416
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:48,570
Speaker 2: manga.".

417
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,001
Speaker 0: You did trailer voice there.

418
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,167
Speaker 0: It was kind of silly.

419
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,417
Speaker 1: I've only read one volume of it.

420
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,341
Speaker 1: How many volumes are there?

421
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:58,050
Speaker 1: Is it going to be three or four or something like that?

422
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,150
Speaker 0: We can check at the Kinokuniya.

423
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,210
Speaker 2: Considering the burn rate of characters, there can't be that many.

424
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,733
Speaker 1: I think it's seven volumes.

425
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:04,897
Speaker 1: It says right here.

426
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:09,770
Speaker 1: At least there's seven volumes, I guess, according to Wikipedia.

427
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,002
Speaker 0: That seems about right.

428
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:14,304
Speaker 0: It's so sad.

429
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:19,390
Speaker 0: The interesting thing is there's a lot of secondary references.

430
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,290
Speaker 0: There was the one where he makes the... What was the robot who played piano's name?

431
00:26:27,393 --> 00:26:28,490
Speaker 1: The one with all the arms.

432
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,850
Speaker 0: The guy who composed the music.

433
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:31,648
Speaker 2: North number two.

434
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:36,264
Speaker 0: He composed for the movie The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.

435
00:26:36,364 --> 00:26:37,950
Speaker 0: Isn't that a Heinlein story?

436
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,222
Speaker 0: I was like, dude.

437
00:26:40,343 --> 00:26:41,530
Speaker 0: There was a lot of stuff like that.

438
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:54,409
Speaker 0: The funny thing is, I know you're going to laugh at me for this, but I couldn't help seeing Robby's wife as anything other than a really dark depiction of the maid from the Jetsons.

439
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did actually.

440
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:58,690
Speaker 0: I remember.

441
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:02,629
Speaker 1: She definitely reminded me of Rosie the Robot.

442
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:11,410
Speaker 0: There was a boy, and they adopted a dog before he was born, and one day the dog died, and the boy cried, and I was like, oh my god, it's the Jetsons.

443
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,470
Speaker 1: And the dog was Rastro?

444
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,081
Speaker 0: I couldn't stop thinking about that.

445
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,750
Speaker 0: I would be like, that would be so horrible.

446
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:29,301
Speaker 2: Actually, what got me the most was that because of that robot's mechanical design, she always has this smile on her face, but because of the context, it was really jarring.

447
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:32,830
Speaker 2: It really stood out, and it made that scene a thousand times sadder.

448
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:46,458
Speaker 0: When you see her standing, it's like her face betrays no emotion, but her posture, and that scene where they're both standing, the detective comes to tell her her husband's passed away.

449
00:27:46,478 --> 00:28:03,110
Speaker 0: Her husband's also a robot, and he was a patrolman with the police force, and they're standing silently in the kitchen, and she's making him a pot of tea, and it's the way it's framed, and also the way they're standing.

450
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:13,590
Speaker 0: You can just see the sadness, like no expression, no anything on her face, but it's very sad, very touching scene.

451
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:33,699
Speaker 2: Sadly, having watched the Astro Boy episodes, this is really good, but at the same time, there's a little bit of... I keep thinking back and either laughing or having extra insights into it, because I guess most people in Japan who would read this already know the story of Pluto, because they've seen Astro Boy.

452
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,310
Speaker 2: I guess Mickey Mouse didn't have some dark story arc, so we don't have anything to compare it to.

453
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:42,840
Speaker 2: But we watched the 80s Astro Boy, and it's pretty much very simple.

454
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:53,630
Speaker 2: It's just a two-parter where there's a robot named Bruton or Pluto, and he's a jerk, and he's going to go around and kill all the strongest robots in the world because he's a jerk.

455
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:59,850
Speaker 1: Well, it's mostly because his creator wants to prove that Pluto is the strongest robot in the world.

456
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,550
Speaker 1: In order to do that, he has to go and destroy all the other strongest robots in the world thereby.

457
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:09,167
Speaker 2: I mean, the name of this two-part story is called "The Greatest Robot on

458
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:09,428
Speaker 2: Earth."

459
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:20,461
Speaker 2: And it starts with this long, open-y bit where they're basically showing you all the best robots in the world, and it's like, "Number one, Montblanc, he's awesome and helps kids.

460
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:21,947
Speaker 2: Number two, Astro

461
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:22,530
Speaker 2: Boy!".

462
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:30,000
Speaker 2: And it just goes through, and it's kind of like the Dune board game where they give you every one, and it's like, there's no way anyone could beat that robot.

463
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,650
Speaker 2: It's like the most powerful robot in the world.

464
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,889
Speaker 1: Especially the wrestling robot.

465
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,550
Speaker 2: Ah, the wrestling robot.

466
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,999
Speaker 1: The wrestling robot is just so big and so powerful.

467
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:39,570
Speaker 1: It's like, well, there's no trouble with that one.

468
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:50,090
Speaker 2: So, Pluto or Bluton or Bruton goes around murdering all of them, and the thing is, they gave him the most disdainful voice I have ever heard.

469
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:51,996
Speaker 1: At least in the '80s dub.

470
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:54,527
Speaker 1: He's just like, he's almost like...

471
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:02,686
Speaker 2: "I don't want to fight you, Astro, but I have to because I'm going to be the strongest robot in the world, and I was built this way, and what's it to

472
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:02,847
Speaker 2: you?".

473
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,098
Speaker 0: So he kind of scoffs at everybody?

474
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:05,721
Speaker 0: That's it?

475
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:07,449
Speaker 1: He's like, "Oh, oh, oh,

476
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:07,690
Speaker 1: whatever.".

477
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,870
Speaker 1: It's weird because he's not, he doesn't come across, you know, it's Astro Boy, right?

478
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,250
Speaker 1: So the guy isn't blatantly evil, like, "I'm going to kill you all," right?

479
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,084
Speaker 1: He's just sort of like, you know, "This is what I have to do.

480
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:20,128
Speaker 1: He's a tragic

481
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:20,550
Speaker 1: villain.".

482
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,990
Speaker 1: You sort of feel for him, even though he's doing all these terrible things, basically killing everybody.

483
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:33,588
Speaker 2: There's actually this really funny scene where he kidnaps Uran, and they're like together, and he's holding on to her to like, "Astro, if you want her to be okay, you'll have to fight

484
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:33,929
Speaker 2: me.".

485
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,075
Speaker 2: And Astro's like, "I don't want to fight

486
00:30:35,176 --> 00:30:35,257
Speaker 2: you.".

487
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:36,504
Speaker 2: He's like, "Well, you're going to have

488
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:36,785
Speaker 2: to.".

489
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,925
Speaker 2: And Uran looks him in the eye, and he looks at her, and they're both like,

490
00:30:40,945 --> 00:30:41,066
Speaker 2: "Eh.".

491
00:30:43,352 --> 00:30:44,360
Speaker 0: I like Uran.

492
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,810
Speaker 0: She's pretty tough.

493
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:46,806
Speaker 0: She's precocious.

494
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:48,876
Speaker 0: She gets really cranky.

495
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:58,870
Speaker 0: It's like, Astro Boy is always really, you know, sometimes he'll get angry, and sometimes he'll get sad, but for the most part, he's a very well-behaved, like, he's very good.

496
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:02,250
Speaker 0: Whereas Uran is very naughty, a lot.

497
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:04,409
Speaker 0: She'll misbehave.

498
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:06,562
Speaker 1: Uran isn't in the manga yet.

499
00:31:06,723 --> 00:31:07,549
Speaker 1: I don't know if she will be.

500
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I assume so, right?

501
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:11,379
Speaker 1: Maybe.

502
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,650
Speaker 1: She was in those two episodes.

503
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:21,270
Speaker 2: And her and Bruton formed this kind of slightly-like, slightly-dislike relationship.

504
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was sort of weird in that way.

505
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:35,109
Speaker 0: But the thing with the manga, like I said, I haven't had a chance to see, like, how the anime portrays Mont Blanc, and, like, all that kind of stuff.

506
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,050
Speaker 1: It barely portrays him at all.

507
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,848
Speaker 0: I know, it's like, it probably shows a picture, it's like, "He's really strong and tough, and he works in the mountains of

508
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:41,290
Speaker 0: Switzerland.".

509
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,109
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

510
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,551
Speaker 0: You know?

511
00:31:42,952 --> 00:31:48,230
Speaker 0: But here, it's like, when he dies, it's like a huge thing.

512
00:31:49,974 --> 00:32:08,770
Speaker 0: Imagine if your national hero, like, somebody who had saved people from avalanches and helped children and composed poems, and just really part of your national identity, not just as an individual, but, like, as a greater-than-life, like, Paul Bunyan hero kind of person, I guess.

513
00:32:11,198 --> 00:32:12,929
Speaker 2: And they really milk it.

514
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:16,969
Speaker 1: They really, really make it into an emotional scene.

515
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:21,070
Speaker 2: Not only did he do all these things, but he also stopped the terrorists.

516
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:25,370
Speaker 1: The manga is pretty much all about milking it, right?

517
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:42,510
Speaker 1: He basically, you know, Tezuka's original story, you know, is a whole story in and of itself, and it's all right, but if you treat that as, like, a framework, right, and you just fill in all the blanks, you know, just, like, flesh everything out as much as it can be fleshed out, you know?

518
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:54,630
Speaker 1: If there was a character who was in there for, like, a minute, you know, tell their whole story like they're a whole big deal, and then, you know, like, if there's just, like, a fight, you know, just, like, stretch that out, you know, so much.

519
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:21,229
Speaker 1: And that's, I think, what Pluto does, is he takes, you know, this original, you know, Tezuka story of Astro Boy, and he stretches it all out, and he moves the perspective from Astro Boy over to the detective, and you just, you get, like, all these details filled in, and he just pretty much, it seems so far, at least in Volume 1, the story goes in the exact same direction, I don't know if he's gonna, you know, he could change it up, I haven't read the later volumes, he might do something different with the ending or whatever, but...

520
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,930
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there's just so much more here, I mean, the whole bit with Brau 1589...

521
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:32,308
Speaker 0: I was gonna ask, do they have that Robo-Hannibal Lecter in the... If that's what he is, he's scaring himself!

522
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,069
Speaker 0: The Robo-Hannibal Lecter!

523
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,495
Speaker 0: Shall we exchange memory chips?

524
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,610
Speaker 0: I killed a human once, would you like to know what's going through my mind?

525
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:50,670
Speaker 1: The Robo-Hannibal Lecter is not in the 80s anime, at least, but the robot with all the arms definitely is in the 80s anime.

526
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,969
Speaker 0: The one who plays piano?

527
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,250
Speaker 2: Yeah, you don't get anything about the piano, you pretty much just find out he gets killed.

528
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:01,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, you find out he's, like, the servant of a rich old guy, and then he goes to fight with his crazy arms and such, and that's it.

529
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,425
Speaker 1: That's all you get.

530
00:34:03,951 --> 00:34:12,940
Speaker 0: But it takes all these robots who are basically, like, cameos and just there for cannon fodder for Bruton or whatever they call them.

531
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,489
Speaker 1: It's called Pluto.

532
00:34:15,114 --> 00:34:16,030
Speaker 0: We'll call him Pluto.

533
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:16,570
Speaker 0: How about Bluto?

534
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,507
Speaker 0: And they basically make them...

535
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:20,489
Speaker 1: I am what I am.

536
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,929
Speaker 0: Grounded characters with, like, a story of their own.

537
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:30,870
Speaker 0: Each robot has their own story and has their own sad things and happy things.

538
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:42,208
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, really, if you think about it, you could do this sort of thing with, like, a lot of different... You know, how many anime out there are just literally, like, you know, "Haha, you are, you know, I am the robot that is

539
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:42,630
Speaker 1: red.".

540
00:34:42,871 --> 00:34:44,810
Speaker 2: I am the fifth strongest robot on Robot Island.

541
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:45,130
Speaker 0: You know what?

542
00:34:45,492 --> 00:34:52,570
Speaker 0: I've always wanted to do, like, a show where it's like a giant robot show, right?

543
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:57,350
Speaker 0: Where there's huge mega robots fighting each other, but it's not told from the perspective of the pilot.

544
00:34:57,752 --> 00:35:00,789
Speaker 0: It's told from the perspective of a civilian during the war.

545
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:06,990
Speaker 0: And, like, you know, 'cause there's, like, you see these robots fighting with each other and they get thrown into an apartment building.

546
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:12,028
Speaker 0: I'm like, "There are people in that apartment building, sitting on somebody's grandma

547
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:12,289
Speaker 0: there.".

548
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,549
Speaker 1: You know, this is terrible.

549
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,430
Speaker 1: Well, Macross did that a lot, actually.

550
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:20,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, there are some... And, actually, Gundam does it a little bit, but the main characters...

551
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:27,310
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on the Gundam.

552
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna mention that one, really.

553
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,190
Speaker 1: That was, like, gave it the most human parts.

554
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,590
Speaker 2: God, that's one of my favorite Gundams.

555
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:34,489
Speaker 1: That's a really good one.

556
00:35:35,531 --> 00:35:36,730
Speaker 1: But, like, a G-Gundam, right?

557
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,370
Speaker 0: Well, G-Gundam is a... There's no human story in G-Gundam.

558
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,308
Speaker 1: But imagine, like, if you took G-Gundam...

559
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:43,650
Speaker 0: It's not about the horror of war.

560
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,530
Speaker 1: Well, imagine, though, you could do the same thing Pluto does to this Astro Boy story and do it to G-Gundam, right?

561
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:58,270
Speaker 1: You could, like, tell, like, the horrible story of, like, you know, the pilot of the Windmill Gundam and, like, this whole... You could make up something, you know, and fill in all those blanks.

562
00:35:58,392 --> 00:35:59,570
Speaker 0: He's from the Netherlands.

563
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,930
Speaker 1: And, you know, they could have you really care about that Windmill Gundam pilot, you know?

564
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:09,630
Speaker 0: Well, you know, Wicked and stuff like that, that's essentially the same idea.

565
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,830
Speaker 0: It's, like, take an antagonist or take a side character and make the story about them instead.

566
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,310
Speaker 0: Just completely reverse the perspective on it.

567
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:21,460
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, really, if any shallow story, right?

568
00:36:25,711 --> 00:36:26,918
Speaker 1: It's just the deep story.

569
00:36:26,938 --> 00:36:28,829
Speaker 1: He has a lot more flesh in between.

570
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,944
Speaker 2: Well, you can do the "just the facts" treatment.

571
00:36:30,965 --> 00:36:31,450
Speaker 2: I mean, look at Pluto.

572
00:36:31,871 --> 00:36:38,170
Speaker 2: He takes just the facts, lays them out in a line, and then writes a whole story that just hits all the facts and doesn't mess with them.

573
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,350
Speaker 0: Man, I like the big reveal in the beginning.

574
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:44,450
Speaker 0: 'Cause you don't know in the beginning about the Inspector.

575
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,570
Speaker 0: And then there's a reveal, and you're like...

576
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,530
Speaker 1: Oh, the fact that he's a robot?

577
00:36:47,858 --> 00:36:47,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

578
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually, that was even more powerful having seen the anime.

579
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,230
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's like, I'm just reading, and I think this guy's just a detective.

580
00:36:56,111 --> 00:37:02,308
Speaker 1: And then as soon as you find out that he's a robot and he's made of a special alloy, having seen the anime, I'm like, "Oh, shit!

581
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:02,969
Speaker 1: Oh,

582
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,130
Speaker 1: shit!".

583
00:37:03,293 --> 00:37:03,908
Speaker 0: It's that guy?

584
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:06,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not just some detective.

585
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:07,216
Speaker 0: Yeah.

586
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:15,950
Speaker 0: But the way they reveal he's a robot actually surprised me, 'cause I wasn't expecting it to go down like that.

587
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:17,137
Speaker 0: I was like, "What?

588
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:17,440
Speaker 0: What?".

589
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,198
Speaker 0: But it's kinda neat.

590
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,890
Speaker 0: What was the other thing I wanted to talk about?

591
00:37:27,474 --> 00:37:30,809
Speaker 0: Oh, talk about how they portray Astro Boy for like two seconds.

592
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,330
Speaker 1: Well, he's only on the last page.

593
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:40,170
Speaker 2: Well, this is definitely the Urasawa touch, because you build up and build up, and everyone reading this would know this is an Astro Boy story.

594
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:44,730
Speaker 2: And of course, that means that you know things about the main character and how this is gonna go already.

595
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,442
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I was wondering if Astro Boy was even going to appear.

596
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:49,290
Speaker 1: Like, would he even be in the manga, actually?

597
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:52,150
Speaker 1: Or would it be just one of those things where, like, you know, he's off in the distance?

598
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,479
Speaker 1: 'Cause, you know, Pluto was in it, but he was always off in the distance.

599
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:56,261
Speaker 1: You never saw him.

600
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:59,530
Speaker 1: You only, you know, he was like a force of nature as opposed to a character.

601
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,403
Speaker 2: You know anyone in Japan, anyone who knows the story of reading this is thinking, "Where's Astro Boy?

602
00:38:03,423 --> 00:38:04,186
Speaker 2: Where's Astro Boy?

603
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:04,748
Speaker 2: Where's Astro

604
00:38:04,788 --> 00:38:04,948
Speaker 2: Boy?".

605
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,948
Speaker 2: And the fact that he reveals Astro Boy like, "Oh, Astro Boy at the

606
00:38:10,008 --> 00:38:10,088
Speaker 2: end.".

607
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,339
Speaker 1: Well, it's just, you know, the volume one.

608
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:14,530
Speaker 1: I think they could have chosen any number of chapters.

609
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:17,300
Speaker 2: Yes, but that unit still ends.

610
00:38:17,741 --> 00:38:20,109
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure that unit ends with, "Astro Boy, oh my

611
00:38:20,129 --> 00:38:20,290
Speaker 2: god.".

612
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,350
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but I mean, imagine if you were reading this serialized and, you know, big shounen, whatever it was, right?

613
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,588
Speaker 2: Yep, so one of those big shounen things.

614
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:28,557
Speaker 1: You get it one week, you read it.

615
00:38:28,638 --> 00:38:29,763
Speaker 1: You get another week, you read it.

616
00:38:29,804 --> 00:38:30,989
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a monthly, I don't know.

617
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,126
Speaker 1: And then suddenly, one of the months on the final page, it's like, "Astro

618
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:34,247
Speaker 1: Boy."

619
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:36,310
Speaker 1: That would be pretty sweet.

620
00:38:36,411 --> 00:38:37,442
Speaker 1: It's like, "Aren't you,

621
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:37,544
Speaker 1: Adam?".

622
00:38:37,564 --> 00:38:38,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, the end.

623
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,690
Speaker 2: One thing I've noticed, though, I've been reading, I'm reading two Urasauas at the same time.

624
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:43,689
Speaker 0: Which other one?

625
00:38:43,892 --> 00:38:45,550
Speaker 2: Well, I'm actually reading Monster.

626
00:38:47,172 --> 00:38:48,355
Speaker 0: Is it better than the anime?

627
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:53,590
Speaker 0: Because I know you like the anime, but you were a little bit, like, I don't know.

628
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:55,590
Speaker 0: You kind of soured on it after a while.

629
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,850
Speaker 2: I felt like the anime had some pacing issues, and the manga does not seem to have them.

630
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:06,530
Speaker 2: But it's weird, but he draws women's eyes the same way, and all of his women look vaguely evil.

631
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:08,168
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way they have, they sort of...

632
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,522
Speaker 2: They're either evil or tired.

633
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:10,350
Speaker 2: There's no middle ground.

634
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're right.

635
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,150
Speaker 1: I see exactly what you're saying.

636
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:18,750
Speaker 1: It seems like all the old ladies are always tired, and all the sort of, you know, younger ladies are always, like, evil.

637
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,490
Speaker 1: Because their eyes are sort of, like, pointed.

638
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,388
Speaker 1: Slanted a little bit.

639
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like they got points on one side, but they're sort of round on the other side.

640
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,510
Speaker 1: They're always at an angle.

641
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:28,702
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have, like, these triangle mouths.

642
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:29,609
Speaker 1: They're like, "Oh, oh, oh,

643
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:29,750
Speaker 1: oh.".

644
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,944
Speaker 0: That's weird, because I totally didn't see that.

645
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:34,050
Speaker 0: I'll have to look at it again.

646
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:35,049
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, look at this.

647
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,009
Speaker 1: I'll show it to you after the show.

648
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:37,229
Speaker 0: And the men have really big noses.

649
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,030
Speaker 0: Like, I was describing this to Alex as we were walking home from work.

650
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,008
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Yeah, Scott lent me this really cool

651
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:43,190
Speaker 0: comic.".

652
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:50,289
Speaker 0: And I was describing the idea to him, and he said, "Okay, who's the artist

653
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:50,530
Speaker 0: again?".

654
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,626
Speaker 0: And I said, "Oh, you know, the guy who did Master Keaton.

655
00:39:53,706 --> 00:39:54,088
Speaker 0: Really big

656
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:54,490
Speaker 0: noses.".

657
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:56,605
Speaker 0: He was like, "I know exactly who you're talking

658
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:56,928
Speaker 0: about.".

659
00:39:57,454 --> 00:39:58,188
Speaker 2: Oh, Master Keaton.

660
00:39:58,452 --> 00:39:58,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

661
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,029
Speaker 0: Yeah.

662
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,710
Speaker 0: But it's all over the world.

663
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:08,570
Speaker 1: It's weird, because his style, like, isn't a very, sort of, stereotypical anime style.

664
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:09,610
Speaker 0: No, I like it a lot.

665
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,030
Speaker 1: But it's much more closer to, like, the sanctuary kind of style.

666
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:15,903
Speaker 1: Well, he does faces.

667
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:20,950
Speaker 2: There'll be these iconic shots throughout of really good faces.

668
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,970
Speaker 2: And every character has a very distinct face.

669
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:23,928
Speaker 1: You know what?

670
00:40:24,533 --> 00:40:27,070
Speaker 0: It's also nice to see a manga.

671
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:36,710
Speaker 0: Like, I've got to critique, not every shoujo manga, but a lot of shoujo manga, just have generic old man and generic old lady.

672
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:37,676
Speaker 0: And also generic teenagers.

673
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,450
Speaker 0: But, like, since they're focused on the teenagers, at least there's a little more variation.

674
00:40:45,131 --> 00:40:49,747
Speaker 0: The work of this artist is really nice because he draws caricatures.

675
00:40:51,170 --> 00:41:00,810
Speaker 0: And it's kind of something that is a mark of a good artist when he's got, you know, you can recognize the different people by their faces.

676
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, he always, you know, that's the thing.

677
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,670
Speaker 1: He has lots of different hairstyles, lots of different body types.

678
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,549
Speaker 0: But like the nose and the facial features and the eyes and stuff like that.

679
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, like all, you know, you always recognize someone when they reappear.

680
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:19,430
Speaker 1: Because in Monster, there's a lot of characters that come and go and people are dying and entering the story, right?

681
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:24,490
Speaker 1: But it's like you'll see someone and you'll see them again like a couple chapters later on, like, a couple pages, but you'll know who they are.

682
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,010
Speaker 1: You've seen them before, you know?

683
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:34,850
Speaker 1: And that actually, that helps out the storytelling a lot because, you know, if it was more poorly drawn and it was harder to tell the characters apart, right?

684
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:40,850
Speaker 1: There are scenes in Monster, right, where it's like they'll introduce a character and they'll introduce them as a bad guy, right?

685
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:45,889
Speaker 1: And then later, like that bad guy would be pretending to be a good guy somewhere, you know?

686
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:49,810
Speaker 1: And like all he'll do is have a panel of like that person opening a door.

687
00:41:49,952 --> 00:41:51,009
Speaker 1: It's like you'll see their face.

688
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:52,607
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, shit, it's that guy.

689
00:41:53,316 --> 00:41:53,788
Speaker 1: You know?

690
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,749
Speaker 1: And that wouldn't work if you couldn't tell it was that guy.

691
00:41:57,095 --> 00:41:57,306
Speaker 1: Yeah.

692
00:41:57,631 --> 00:42:00,069
Speaker 1: You know, so it helps out a lot to be able to draw that.

693
00:42:00,089 --> 00:42:00,250
Speaker 1: well.

694
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,930
Speaker 1: You know, you couldn't, XKCD couldn't tell that story.

695
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:09,890
Speaker 1: XKCD would need, you know, a narration or a bubble saying, "I am that guy," or something, you know, Stan Lee-like.

696
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:17,466
Speaker 0: Remember that it was a pretty good comic, but it suffered from that problem, was that spy comic?

697
00:42:18,357 --> 00:42:18,850
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

698
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,270
Speaker 0: I had such trouble telling the different people apart.

699
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:28,370
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, it really was important to the narrative, like who's doing what.

700
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:32,570
Speaker 0: But then if you, the art would make you very confused on that point.

701
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,890
Speaker 0: So, um, well.

702
00:42:37,871 --> 00:42:43,470
Speaker 1: Do you think you want to like read all the manga and then like see what the original story was?

703
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,830
Speaker 1: Or do you want to like see the original story?

704
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,849
Speaker 2: The thing is, because we're talking about it, like the way we talk about it, I think if you're smart, it's pretty obvious how this is going to end.

705
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:53,464
Speaker 2: Yeah.

706
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:54,250
Speaker 2: Yeah.

707
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:55,469
Speaker 2: Pretty much straight up.

708
00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:13,070
Speaker 1: I was just, you know, I was just really interested in what their, you know, because, you know, my enjoyment of it was like incredibly, you know, usually when you see something and then you see an adaptation of it, obviously your experience of the adaptation is colored by what you experienced with, you know, the original or whatever order you happen to consume them in.

709
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:16,230
Speaker 1: You know, that's why people are asking like, "Oh, I've never read Watchmen.

710
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,121
Speaker 1: Should I watch the movie

711
00:43:17,182 --> 00:43:17,568
Speaker 1: first?".

712
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:19,763
Speaker 1: Or, you know, "I've never read Akira.

713
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:20,387
Speaker 1: Should I watch it

714
00:43:20,428 --> 00:43:20,750
Speaker 1: first?".

715
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:25,650
Speaker 0: It's different in this case because it's not a straight up adaptation.

716
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:36,450
Speaker 0: It's like Wicked or like those books where he is not telling the direct story.

717
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:39,830
Speaker 0: He's making a new story with references to the old story.

718
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:52,910
Speaker 2: And in this case especially because it's something that, I mean, Astro Boy was so iconic and so loved and so known that I feel like in the end, you should probably watch the 80s Astro Boy take or just enough to know what the story already is before you read it.

719
00:43:52,930 --> 00:44:04,365
Speaker 2: because I feel like the majority of people who have read this, up until the American release at least, would have already known how it was going to end and already knew the story, remembered it from their childhood, and now are reading it going, "Oh, I remember Mont

720
00:44:04,385 --> 00:44:04,828
Speaker 2: Blanc.".

721
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:07,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I agree with you on that point.

722
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,910
Speaker 0: I think I'll probably watch the episodes before I read it anymore.

723
00:44:09,991 --> 00:44:11,070
Speaker 2: It's on Netflix on demand.

724
00:44:11,711 --> 00:44:15,970
Speaker 0: Still, I didn't watch and I still thought it was a damn good comic.

725
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,230
Speaker 0: Very, very good.

726
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:27,109
Speaker 1: I mean, while it's not a straight up adaptation, though, the knowledge of what happened in the original story heavily colored my enjoyment of it.

727
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:36,008
Speaker 1: So I was unsure if I would have-- because a lot of the thrills came, like the moment where I knew the detective was a robot and remembered him from the anime was huge.

728
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,109
Speaker 1: And it's like if I hadn't remembered him from the anime, would it have been as huge?

729
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:41,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, because there were the two revelations.

730
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,861
Speaker 2: There was the, "Oh, it's that guy.

731
00:44:44,565 --> 00:44:44,626
Speaker 2: Oh.".

732
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,982
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was tough.

733
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:54,389
Speaker 2: I think pretty much we can safely say this is one of those-- if you're a manga fan or an anime fan, just buy it.

734
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:55,605
Speaker 2: Don't even worry about it.

735
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:55,910
Speaker 2: You'll like it.

736
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got to buy this stuff.

737
00:44:57,583 --> 00:44:58,410
Speaker 1: I mean, come on.

738
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:03,850
Speaker 1: If there's going to be a manga you're going to buy, it's going to be this, and I guess 20th Century Boys just started coming out.

739
00:45:04,372 --> 00:45:05,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have yet to read that.

740
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,810
Speaker 0: Scott lent it to me, but I haven't gotten around to it.

741
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:09,628
Speaker 0: Scott's talking it up.

742
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,830
Speaker 0: Still beating Chrono Trigger.

743
00:45:12,092 --> 00:45:13,965
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, Urasawa, right?

744
00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:14,509
Speaker 1: He did this.

745
00:45:15,471 --> 00:45:27,210
Speaker 0: So 20th Century Boys is as good or better, so what are you going to-- I remember like six years ago going into Kinokunya and seeing that there, and I was like I had no idea what it was about.

746
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,640
Speaker 0: I was like, "Is it historical?

747
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:31,166
Speaker 0: Is it science fiction?

748
00:45:31,287 --> 00:45:31,608
Speaker 0: Is it

749
00:45:31,668 --> 00:45:31,929
Speaker 0: this?".

750
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,209
Speaker 0: You know, and it intrigued me.

751
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:35,350
Speaker 1: I didn't really know who it was either until I read it.

752
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,254
Speaker 0: I wanted to buy it really badly, and so now almost a decade after-- Plus, the horns.

753
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,805
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you don't know.

754
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:45,390
Speaker 1: That's right.

755
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,409
Speaker 1: The horns have not appeared in Pluto at all.

756
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,790
Speaker 2: Well, they're referenced constantly.

757
00:45:50,411 --> 00:45:51,417
Speaker 1: They're on the cover.

758
00:45:51,437 --> 00:45:53,410
Speaker 2: He sticks horns in that guy's head.

759
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:58,430
Speaker 1: He leaves horns on Mont Blanc's head, but-- But the horns are big in the anime, real big.

760
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:05,185
Speaker 0: Do you think he's going to be like crazier because the way he killed them was kind of crazy?

761
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:11,310
Speaker 0: It was more like a serial killer than like, "Oh, well, it's my duty.

762
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:12,283
Speaker 0: Gotta go beat this

763
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:12,569
Speaker 0: guy.".

764
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:15,810
Speaker 2: Of course, I wonder more importantly if the volcano is going to erupt.

765
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:17,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I don't know.

766
00:46:17,256 --> 00:46:19,170
Speaker 1: The thing is I don't know if it will go that far.

767
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,110
Speaker 1: Will the manga end before that point, or will it keep going?

768
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,270
Speaker 2: Yeah, this manga could end before Pluto gets beaten.

769
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean, this is not a spoiler.

770
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,050
Speaker 1: I mean, it's an Astro Boy story, right?

771
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:36,602
Speaker 1: In the original Astro Boy story, the finale, of course, is Astro Boy fighting Pluto to the end, right?

772
00:46:38,111 --> 00:46:46,230
Speaker 1: So I wonder if the manga will go all that way and show you this Astro Boy fight, or if it's going to end sometime before or after that even.

773
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,508
Speaker 1: How far is he going to take it?

774
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,259
Speaker 1: Is he going to do a prologue?

775
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,688
Speaker 1: Is he going to cut it short?

776
00:46:54,514 --> 00:46:56,630
Speaker 1: It's up in the air, and I'm going to be interested.

777
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:03,170
Speaker 1: Seven volumes, he's got to go somewhere because he's already through two of the seven strongest robots in the world in volume one.

778
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:05,269
Speaker 2: I'll definitely be reading all of it.

779
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:05,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

780
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:14,610
