00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:39,777
Speaker 0: I'm not getting my dick out.

10
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:52,606
Speaker 0: We'll talk about getting dicks out later, so I'm biking to work right and the most ridiculous Stereotypical hipster fixie bike dude I have ever seen to the point of those ultra tall ones.

11
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,128
Speaker 0: so now now well It was not a penny far thing.

12
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,758
Speaker 0: It was just this guy wearing a knit ad.

13
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:05,199
Speaker 0: he looked like such a bike hipster at this huge leather Messenger bag and this huge chain.

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,610
Speaker 0: the messenger bag had a full-size bike pump sticking out of it.

15
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:19,890
Speaker 0: it's an actual fixie fixed gear not single gear and He's biking like a maniac down the road in Queens like a maniac and he's doing that thing.

16
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:28,141
Speaker 0: I don't know if you've noticed this, but those ultra biker dudes a lot of times They like to touch stuff while they're biking Really like they'll bike and they like.

17
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:34,589
Speaker 0: they come up behind a car and they whip Around the car and they reach out and like slap the back of the car as they ride by it.

18
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,730
Speaker 1: Why would you touch someone's car for no reason?

19
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,519
Speaker 0: I don't know, but I've seen the hipster.

20
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,310
Speaker 0: you fixie bike guys do it all the time Okay?

21
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:48,890
Speaker 0: or like they come up to the Pulaski bridge and they bike up to it and they just like Grab the paint grab the cement right as they go past it and they grab the rail.

22
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:57,179
Speaker 0: They just touch shit all the time and he's also biking in that really aggressive way where he's standing up the whole time and doing And doing that pumpity pump back and forth.

23
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,463
Speaker 1: was it a fixie or one speed?

24
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,106
Speaker 0: it was a fixie.

25
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:02,954
Speaker 0: like I said, okay But he's jumping with it too Like you would a BMX.

26
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:11,090
Speaker 0: like he gets to a corner and he like jumps the bike into the loose slight corner He's taking and it's just he's being a douchebag and he runs red lights.

27
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:17,093
Speaker 0: He almost hits me because I was stopped in the bike lane at a red light and he like whipped his way around me and He touched the.

28
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,247
Speaker 0: there was a pole like a light pole and he touched it as he went by it and turned around.

29
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:25,110
Speaker 0: and he's doing all this bullshit Crashed hurt himself.

30
00:02:25,374 --> 00:02:28,742
Speaker 0: so I Just laughed and kind of let him do his thing.

31
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:33,505
Speaker 0: and then every you know I kept passing him because I'm way faster than anyone.

32
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,587
Speaker 0: on one of those bikes I was just actually stopping for red lights.

33
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:38,728
Speaker 1: So it happens a lot to me, too.

34
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:39,331
Speaker 1: so

35
00:02:39,372 --> 00:02:46,949
Speaker 0: he gets on the Pulaski and he gets stuck behind slow people that he can't easily get around and he's really antsy and he keeps sliding his bike back and forth and like

36
00:02:47,712 --> 00:02:48,455
Speaker 1: Fell off the bridge

37
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:58,570
Speaker 0: and then he just fucking like crabs a guy like on the shoulder It's like yo, bro, and like slides past everyone with his bike and this is rocketing down and this really gets in everyone's business.

38
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:06,180
Speaker 0: okay, so I get down to the end of the bridge and I catch up to him again because fixies are slow and I'm watching him and he.

39
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:07,408
Speaker 0: we get to the bike lanes.

40
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:10,945
Speaker 1: in Brooklyn I was speeding down a hill on a big hill with a fixie.

41
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:12,030
Speaker 1: How did he stop at the bottom?

42
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,685
Speaker 0: Because well he stopped because there was actual traffic at the base of the bridge.

43
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,210
Speaker 1: Did he have a break on this fixie?

44
00:03:20,072 --> 00:03:20,455
Speaker 0: I don't know.

45
00:03:20,516 --> 00:03:24,238
Speaker 0: I guess I think he had one of those ghetto little front brakes But I might have done his bullshit slow down.

46
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:32,349
Speaker 1: I saw a dude with a fixie and only a rear brake and I was like What the fuck dude anyway, so anyway that the operative part of the story is that he gets going.

47
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,302
Speaker 0: now I'm waiting for the comeuppance and there's a bike lane.

48
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:37,170
Speaker 0: Mmm, but he's not in the bike lane.

49
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:41,184
Speaker 0: He's riding in the street next to the bike lane for no goddamn reason.

50
00:03:41,344 --> 00:03:42,850
Speaker 0: Okay blocking traffic.

51
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:58,906
Speaker 0: So there's cars lined up behind him because he's going way slow and he's in the middle of the lane biking as fast as he can and like going left and right and left and right like Woodley Woodley Woodley Woodley Woodley and People are just passing him in the bike lane and the cars are honking and he's being a douchebag.

52
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:07,308
Speaker 0: and then out of nowhere he does his Woodley to the left and comes down and His front tire just snaps off.

53
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:17,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, and he goes too much Woodley and he goes tumbling and his messenger bag lands on the ground and explodes In just garbage everywhere.

54
00:04:17,236 --> 00:04:20,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the bike goes flying and he goes rolling and he's laying there.

55
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:25,742
Speaker 0: So I Bike up next to him and I slow down.

56
00:04:25,783 --> 00:04:33,830
Speaker 0: I'm like you okay, bro And he is obviously not okay like not like he's not gonna die, but he was not in a good way.

57
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:35,645
Speaker 0: And he's like, yeah, man, I'm fine.

58
00:04:39,532 --> 00:04:42,264
Speaker 0: And I look and the car that had been stuck behind him.

59
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,630
Speaker 0: who watched all this firsthand?

60
00:04:44,073 --> 00:04:45,444
Speaker 0: The guy is laughing so hard.

61
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:46,270
Speaker 0: He can't even breathe.

62
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:58,593
Speaker 0: the guy is just like holding on like he's holding out of the wheel and he's just got his head up in the air like It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen in my life Instant justice.

63
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,539

127
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:37,880
Speaker 0: well thing is I still like that concept of my little pony But I am dubious that the upcoming season will be worth watching my rear-view mirror and I see sharks.

128
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, that have been jumped over.

129
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:46,187

Speaker 0: You see a car going at high speed toward a brick wall.

133
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,567
Speaker 0: Then you know, it's gonna hit the brick wall.

134
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,576
Speaker 0: You don't look away because it's gonna happen.

135
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:00,960

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,563
Speaker 0: He's got to see it.

137
00:09:01,603 --> 00:09:03,573

147
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,419
Speaker 1: I've been using my elgato and streaming playing video games.

148
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:33,984
Speaker 1: How about that?

149
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,920
Speaker 0: What if we should stream live the the making of one of our route 10 episodes?

150
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:47,119
Speaker 0: Whatever people will be really sad to see that the making of is identical to What they actually get because we don't actually edit that shit anyway anyway.

151
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:57,409
Speaker 1: So in the news in the news news something happened that I feel like has happened before But perhaps see okay.

152
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,207
Speaker 1: Anyway Miyazaki retired even at a price conference Retired right.

153
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:07,969
Speaker 1: so I see this and I'm like Brett Favre right He's done this before.

154
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:11,410
Speaker 1: he is not really retiring but I'm

155
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:12,460
Speaker 0: sort of maybe

156
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:25,029
Speaker 1: Convinced he actually is because he had a big press conference about it as opposed to just sort of saying he's doing it, right Yeah, and also if you look at it, it's like yeah He hasn't really done anything super great in a while, right?

157
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:28,360
Speaker 1: He wants to go out while he still hasn't made anything awful.

158
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,094
Speaker 0: I'm still convinced that what he was attempting to do.

159
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:41,498
Speaker 0: Well, not necessarily attempting I think a tiny part of him to be perfectly honest was hoping that he would eventually die in the middle of his last work.

160
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:46,635
Speaker 0: Because you notice whenever there's like look at Satoshi con everything he did.

161
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:51,791
Speaker 1: He's really trying to get lung cancer pretty But seriously look at so she got.

162
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:56,288
Speaker 0: everything he did was gold, right But the last thing he was working on that didn't get finished.

163
00:10:56,528 --> 00:11:02,398
Speaker 0: has this mystique because the people who recognize his gold are desperate for anything more.

164
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,900
Speaker 1: Anything you will see plenty of lost works of Miyazaki.

165
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:13,712
Speaker 0: Right, I would love to see a director like this like work with his animators and Secretly create a movie that no one knew about.

166
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:15,179
Speaker 0: that's only released after his death.

167
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:18,268
Speaker 0: Sure, like it's hidden somewhere in 20 years later.

168
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,013
Speaker 0: Someone calls it people do this.

169
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:21,176
Speaker 1: It's called fake Van.

170
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:21,838
Speaker 1: Gogh's.

171
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,500
Speaker 1: they have them.

172
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:26,537
Speaker 0: So we should we make should we get people to make fake Miyazaki's did?

173
00:11:26,577 --> 00:11:27,240
Speaker 1: good luck with that.

174
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,493
Speaker 1: It's a lot harder than making a Van.

175
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:28,735
Speaker 1: Gogh.

176
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,624
Speaker 0: Hahahaha We'll see what happens.

177
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:37,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, girl girl did better with his uh more recent girl.

178
00:11:39,481 --> 00:11:42,317
Speaker 0: Make good anime girl run tournament.

179
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:43,683
Speaker 0: good I don't know.

180
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:47,120
Speaker 0: is this his second work was better than the first work that he made?

181
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:50,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, also, I know seems to be getting in on that biz.

182
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,199
Speaker 0: We'll see that that is still a rumor.

183
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:55,259
Speaker 1: at best It's still you know.

184
00:11:56,281 --> 00:12:04,646
Speaker 0: Though if it were going to happen the rumor is that Anno would like to or has a line toward making a Sequel to Nausicaa.

185
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:06,579
Speaker 1: Okay, you need more manga to do that.

186
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:15,140
Speaker 0: If I. well the thing is them the anime Really covers pretty the first volume of the manga and actually has a pretty different tone from the overall model.

187
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:17,510
Speaker 1: It also adds an ending that sort of isn't in.

188
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:21,005
Speaker 0: yeah, because the end of that manga is yeah We got a long way to go here.

189
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:30,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if I were Anno I would not in any way make it a sequel to Miyazaki's the you know the Ghibli one.

190
00:12:30,256 --> 00:12:35,458
Speaker 0: instead I would just make it a separate set of movies that follows the manga more whole set of them.

191
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:36,743
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, that'd be cool.

192
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:37,566
Speaker 0: That would be really cool.

193
00:12:37,646 --> 00:12:38,409
Speaker 1: Actually that shit.

194
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,878
Speaker 0: I feel like Anno could pull it off the series.

195
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,869
Speaker 1: Yeah Now should get TV follows the manga.

196
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would watch the fuck out of it.

197
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,771
Speaker 1: I think everyone would save anime.

198
00:12:47,811 --> 00:12:48,999
Speaker 1: everyone watch the fuck out of it.

199
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,949
Speaker 0: That's the kind of thing that could cause a girl of course attack on me.

200
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:58,196
Speaker 0: that could be an a anime that could do For anime what Akira did for anime.

201
00:12:58,437 --> 00:13:03,153
Speaker 0: Yep Because a lot of people are talking about an anime Renaissance.

202
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:12,900
Speaker 0: recently because of attack on Titan and Well, the thing is it's true, but that's misleading attack on Titan got Existing anime fans excited about anime again.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,134
Speaker 1: It did not get new people in anime and I think you know what the Nausicaa TV could do.

204
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:18,880
Speaker 1: obviously all speculation, right?

205
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,251
Speaker 1: But it's like you look people who aren't anime fans hardcore.

206
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 1: They're just say watch anime like my mom or something.

207
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, they only really watch anime movies and really only you know, the Miyazakis and maybe the Satoshi Kans.

208
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:35,472
Speaker 1: There's one step me on goes to the shells of the Akira's.

209
00:13:35,492 --> 00:13:37,240
Speaker 0: there is one to be out of the normal people who?

210
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,440
Speaker 0: They watch the movies and they have seen like one anime series like a cowboy beaver.

211
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,146
Speaker 0: Yeah They've seen like cowboy bop or put.

212
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,933
Speaker 1: the TV series are pretty much nerds.

213
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,323
Speaker 1: only what TV series is accessible Like.

214
00:13:48,343 --> 00:13:50,940
Speaker 1: do all them, you know the moms who watch Miyazaki movies.

215
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,589
Speaker 1: What TV series do they watch in America?

216
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:56,820
Speaker 0: Because if you say the world says I saw him sure, right?

217
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:05,794
Speaker 1: But if there was Miyazaki TV series like Nausicaa TV Boom suddenly anime TV series becomes a thing for all those people.

218
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:07,519
Speaker 1: if you write and it wouldn't be hard.

219
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,227
Speaker 1: Yep Yeah, wouldn't be hard.

220
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:18,239
Speaker 0: but attack on Titan is Energizing anime fandom and a lot of people I see who were really into anime and just weren't watching a lot.

221
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:26,270
Speaker 1: recently Suddenly with attack on Titan they started watching anime as it's got the people who were anime fans who haven't watched anime in a while To watch an anime?

222
00:14:26,392 --> 00:14:27,079
Speaker 0: I suspect it.

223
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,120
Speaker 0: I think it also got a lot of people who previously were not using crunchyroll to start using crunchyroll.

224
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,470
Speaker 1: I got me I was using crunchyroll now.

225
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,338
Speaker 1: I temporarily paid money to crunchyroll.

226
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:47,340
Speaker 0: exactly I think a lot of people are paying for crunchyroll now And I think a lot of these people when attack on Titan stops gonna stop paying for crunchyroll No, I think they're gonna start watching some of the other anime that's on there.

227
00:14:48,961 --> 00:14:55,765
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of good shit going on right now sure, but I'm not gonna keep paying like I watch it for free All the shows.

228
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, but all those shows.

229
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:58,600
Speaker 1: I could just watch them for free.

230
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,717
Speaker 1: And the only reason I need to pay is because you know simulcast.

231
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:04,424
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think you get.

232
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,180
Speaker 1: there has to be another show that I want to simulcast as badly as attack on time.

233
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,135
Speaker 0: I don't think you get full quality if you don't pay on all of them.

234
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,080
Speaker 1: That's a shame

235
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:15,017
Speaker 0: I'm not sure because we've had to pay account forever, so it's kind

236
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:15,138
Speaker 1: of

237
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:26,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean seriously There's a ton of other pretty good stuff lately and there's been good shows that have come out for a while But nothing is energized anime fandom until attack on Titan.

238
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,026
Speaker 0: It's doing what Fullmetal Alchemist did.

239
00:15:28,046 --> 00:15:28,648
Speaker 1: Madoka did.

240
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:33,025
Speaker 0: Madoka did but I not as much Madoka energized.

241
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:33,828
Speaker 1: Even though it's better.

242
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:37,505
Speaker 0: I think Madoka energized a smaller Harder core.

243
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,519
Speaker 0: Madoka energized people like us.

244
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:41,446
Speaker 0: We were like oh fuck anime.

245
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:43,191
Speaker 1: Everyone, all the attack on Titan.

246
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:47,583
Speaker 1: people who are excited about anime suddenly Watch Madoka.

247
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:48,426
Speaker 1: You've got time.

248
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:52,680
Speaker 1: There isn't gonna be a new frickin attack on Titan episode for like a week or something.

249
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,260
Speaker 0: Yes, and if you have time to watch Madoka Yeah.

250
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,624
Speaker 0: And attack on Titan people.

251
00:15:56,885 --> 00:16:01,882
Speaker 0: if you what you want a show with ridiculous cliffhangers where you start watching and then you have to watch Everything.

252
00:16:01,902 --> 00:16:03,287
Speaker 0: that's Madoka.

253
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,459
Speaker 0: and you know what if you watch Madoka and you still need a show like that?

254
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:06,961
Speaker 1: Ava.

255
00:16:07,282 --> 00:16:07,925
Speaker 0: Escaflowne.

256
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:08,386
Speaker 0: and Ava.

257
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:11,076
Speaker 0: Escaflowne is not the best show ever, but you know what?

258
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:12,100
Speaker 0: It's got that cliffhanger.

259
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,534
Speaker 0: You're gonna watch one episode then you're gonna watch 23 and then you're gonna watch 26.

260
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:24,293
Speaker 0: Yep So I don't really have a news but Scott Briefly talked about a new comic called Trillium.

274
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:17,099
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize what was going on till I got to the middle and you start from the other side.

275
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,308
Speaker 0: Then you read his different comic.

276
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:19,175

Speaker 0: Well, they're neck and neck but we have such.

290
00:18:10,908 --> 00:18:12,573

Speaker 0: okay, I'm gonna give the summary.

295
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,267
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is so far as we know there is.

296
00:18:25,308 --> 00:18:26,410
Speaker 1: which side did you read first?

297
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,909
Speaker 1: Indiana Jones side of the space.

298
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,800
Speaker 0: I read the space side first.

299
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,300
Speaker 0: I read the space side first by chance cuz I also chose to do it by chance.

300
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,700
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that it was flipped before I read it.

301
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,640
Speaker 1: I just picked it up and started reading and then I was like, oh there's another side.

302
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:48,615
Speaker 0: I knew it was flipped and what I did is I looked at it and I was like Random, so I just flipped a coin and it was tails.

303
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,060
Speaker 0: So I read the space one.

304
00:18:50,120 --> 00:19:02,233
Speaker 1: So in the space side, there's some girl who's a space space anthropologist in a in a Really really future society and she needs to go and get this plant to get.

305
00:19:02,413 --> 00:19:06,225
Speaker 1: keep her people alive from some horrible disease or something Yep, but she's an anthropologist.

306
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:09,517
Speaker 0: It's the typical sort of she has to talk to the aliens.

307
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,480
Speaker 0: you talk to the aliens.

308
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:11,529
Speaker 0: We need their bullshit.

309
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, the military is like no We're gonna go get it.

310
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,648
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you can't convince that an alien sent her on a quest to basically prove her worth on the other hand on earth At least it looks like earth.

311
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:21,253
Speaker 0: It's like the 20s.

312
00:19:21,273 --> 00:19:25,610
Speaker 1: There's some Archaeologist investigating Mayan ruins Aztec ruins.

313
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:25,831
Speaker 0: Yep.

314
00:19:25,851 --> 00:19:28,018
Speaker 0: He's a world war one veteran as far as I found, you know.

315
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:34,548
Speaker 1: He's investigating the ancient hidden ruins Legend of the hidden temple in that very British sort of ho.

316
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:38,639
Speaker 0: ho off into the jungle with fifth helmets hurrah and they meet.

317
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,139
Speaker 1: Yeah issue one.

318
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:42,343
Speaker 0: Yeah The two comics.

319
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:44,811
Speaker 0: you read one it ends at a point where they meet.

320
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:45,815
Speaker 0: you read the other one.

321
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:50,960
Speaker 0: it ends at the exact same Point from the other perspective and it's wonder if the next issue is gonna be flipped.

322
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,611
Speaker 1: Probably not and I wonder how it's gonna look in the trade.

323
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:55,097
Speaker 0: There's spoilers.

324
00:19:55,137 --> 00:19:55,498
Speaker 0: Whatever.

325
00:19:55,538 --> 00:19:55,900
Speaker 0: It's one.

326
00:19:56,805 --> 00:20:09,520
Speaker 0: What really was interesting is I read the space one first I get to the end of it and I'm really invested in this character because there's a pretty big thing going on that the body She sees inside of that temple man and what they were wearing.

327
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:16,715
Speaker 0: And then suddenly this guy with a machete covered in blood is just like yo, I'm like what?

328
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,340
Speaker 0: who's this guy with a machete?

329
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,142
Speaker 0: Me no trust.

330
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:24,520
Speaker 0: and then I read the other one and it is I perfectly understand why his machete is covered in blood.

331
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:39,643
Speaker 0: duh, but now I see both from his perspective how threatening she looks and from her perspective how Threatening he looks in a way that could not have been done in a different format Comics.

332
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,400
Speaker 1: Yeah best you can't do this shit in some movie.

333
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:45,926
Speaker 0: Just have a movie that you.

334
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:52,278
Speaker 1: you watch one movie in the left eye and one in the right eye at the same time And then once here's the way you do it you release the movie to theaters, right?

335
00:20:52,278 --> 00:21:01,577
Speaker 1: 50% of theaters watch movie a and 50% watch movie B, but they have the same title and then everyone's like oh fuck There's a second movie and then you have to go back and watch the second one.

336
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:05,929
Speaker 1: Yeah If you get the first one again shit, what could be like clue?

337
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,091
Speaker 0: it could be like clue.

338
00:21:07,693 --> 00:21:09,958
Speaker 0: that would be the best anyway.

339
00:21:10,439 --> 00:21:19,393
Speaker 0: anyway things of the day Speaking of dicks being out.

340
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:20,220
Speaker 0: This is a video.

341
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:29,769
Speaker 0: It's a pretty well done video and basically it's the top 10 scenes that people would pause and rewind a movie for In other words Easter eggs.

342
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,745
Speaker 0: Yeah, or like you notice something weird Like did that munchkin just hang himself?

343
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:35,029
Speaker 0: what pause rewind?

344
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,660
Speaker 0: or was that a ghost in the background of three men and a baby?

345
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,644
Speaker 1: Did that guy have his dick out?

346
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:41,125
Speaker 1: Yes.

347
00:21:41,345 --> 00:21:41,646
Speaker 1: Yes.

348
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:42,188
Speaker 1: He did.

349
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:44,714
Speaker 1: but was a dick in that movie?

350
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:48,023
Speaker 1: an exposed male Peanut credit.

351
00:21:48,043 --> 00:21:53,080
Speaker 0: what it doesn't have is the scene in back to the future where the kid flips the camera off and points at his dick.

352
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,620
Speaker 0: But what's interesting is that this video is great for modern times and this is the reason I make it a thing of the day.

353
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:05,360
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, I heard the rumor of a munchkin being hanged in the background.

354
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:10,060
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh fuck so I did and the movie is on your TV is blurry as fuck.

355
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was looking for UFOs with your camera.

356
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,040
Speaker 0: We had an expensive goddamn VCR.

357
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:19,760
Speaker 0: So I was doing this tracking frame by frame and I'm like that kind of looks like someone hanging themselves.

358
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:21,024
Speaker 0: I really can't.

359
00:22:21,044 --> 00:22:35,120
Speaker 0: we're like my brother and I are like drawing pictures of it and tracing over the TV and If you watch the HD version it is obvious It's a bird like so obvious and a lot of these are like that like the three men and a baby thing.

360
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,152
Speaker 0: I remember when I pause that since we've had HD cameras.

361
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:40,280
Speaker 1: There's a lot less talk about aliens.

362
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:46,478
Speaker 1: Yeah, UFOs except among the crazy separate CG generated ones that people have made as hoaxes.

363
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:49,404
Speaker 0: Yep I want to see a lot more hoaxes like that though.

364
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:54,356
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's my video That's my thing of the day.

365
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,690
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I got my thing of the day.

366
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:01,149
Speaker 1: So you all are aware if you go to YouTube to the cartoon hangover, there is a TV show.

367
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,224
Speaker 0: Bravest Warriors is like my fifth favorite thing in the world right now.

368
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,728
Speaker 1: I like Bravest Warriors a lot.

369
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:14,357
Speaker 1: I see comic book and there's a lot of people cosplaying and cat bug got really popular.

370
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:19,597
Speaker 0: if I had to rate things that are on right now or recently that I like that are Visual media.

371
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:22,628
Speaker 0: It's pretty much adventure time.

372
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:35,970
Speaker 0: Bravest Warriors Venture brothers, even though the season recently ended Archer even though we're waiting for the new season my little pony Even though the sharks the sharks might be circling anyway, but being puppycat is right up there.

373
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, so being puppycat is the other thing that is on cartoon hangover.

374
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:41,790
Speaker 1: People seem to like it more than Bravest Warriors.

375
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:42,633
Speaker 1: They're heathens.

376
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,679
Speaker 1: Not that being puppycat isn't great.

377
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,187
Speaker 0: I like being puppycat more than Bravest Warriors.

378
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:48,170
Speaker 1: It is pretty awesome.

379
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,990
Speaker 1: However, it's just not Bravest Warriors.

380
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,037
Speaker 0: 90% of why I like being puppycat more is the voice acting the vocaloid.

381
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,455
Speaker 1: No, the main girl the main girl.

382
00:24:00,596 --> 00:24:04,007
Speaker 0: I love the way she talks and 9% is her actual dialogue.

383
00:24:05,471 --> 00:24:07,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much all that show has I'm sure sure.

384
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,785
Speaker 0: glad there was nothing sharp on my couch.

385
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:20,590
Speaker 1: Use the sword as a sword All right, so You should watch both those things but beginning tomorrow or perhaps today.

386
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,694
Speaker 1: Wait, there's a third thing.

387
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:25,710
Speaker 1: It says coming this Thursday and they posted it yesterday and today is Thursday.

388
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:27,335
Speaker 1: So this could be posted anytime today.

389
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:29,241
Speaker 1: They have a trailer though, which is what I'm gonna link to.

390
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:33,232
Speaker 1: the trailer is for a third show Dr.

391
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:35,638
Speaker 1: Lollipop the unicorn doctor.

392
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:39,588
Speaker 0: this appears to be from what Scott showed me the greatest.

393
00:24:39,709 --> 00:24:49,286
Speaker 0: Dr McNinja little pony the bee and puppycat time It combines our Lee the things I like about all these domicile dobutsu.

394
00:24:49,888 --> 00:24:51,789
Speaker 0: Oh my god There it is domicile dobutsu.

395
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,653
Speaker 1: Anyway, so

396
00:24:52,673 --> 00:24:56,568
Speaker 0: because you know that assistant raccoon looking guy in the background is gonna be the best

397
00:24:56,709 --> 00:25:12,210
Speaker 1: the thing I want to point out about this is like at PAX There was a lot of like cat bug Bravest Warriors going on and not just because we love fine with selling it right people were doing it and I find it really awesome that this is like hey, this is just a TV show that just posted on YouTube.

398
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,242
Speaker 1: There's no friggin, you know, it's not in a TV network.

399
00:25:15,302 --> 00:25:16,105
Speaker 1: It's not doing anything.

400
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:22,109
Speaker 1: and Bravest Warriors It's appropriate for all ages, but it you know, it does things that would not be allowed on TV.

401
00:25:22,852 --> 00:25:24,177
Speaker 1: Straight up right?

402
00:25:24,237 --> 00:25:27,970
Speaker 1: It would be very different if it was actually on Cartoon Network or Nickelodeon or some shit.

403
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:41,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, yet you see almost as much of it as you see Adventure time around like it's around because The afford for basically for people YouTube is finally TV.

404
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:49,050
Speaker 0: No YouTube is only TV for people for nerds my people and people under the age of 14 people go to pegs and young people.

405
00:25:49,211 --> 00:25:54,693
Speaker 0: Yeah for very young people and for nerds it YouTube replaced TV a while ago But we're so we're passing.

406
00:25:54,734 --> 00:25:57,522
Speaker 1: now we're finally seeing full production value.

407
00:25:57,562 --> 00:26:00,070
Speaker 1: TV shows just on YouTube free.

408
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,980
Speaker 1: We've seen them like on Netflix, you know streaming.

409
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:06,112
Speaker 1: but this is on YouTube free real TV show not.

410
00:26:06,393 --> 00:26:07,640
Speaker 1: some guy made it at his home.

411
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,249
Speaker 1: TV show and animation.

412
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:11,375
Speaker 1: and There's not too many of those.

413
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,951
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's definitely not too many of those, you know, there are something I'm not saying.

414
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:19,625
Speaker 1: these are the first ones is the first ones where people are buying merch all over.

415
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,150
Speaker 1: the convention is what I'm saying.

416
00:26:22,391 --> 00:26:25,240
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment book club book is Stasi land.

417
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:26,805
Speaker 1: Haven't even read page one.

418

00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:46,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, how far did you go?

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,815
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I'm at the place where they're inside the planet that they were Looking for the.

428
00:26:52,076 --> 00:27:00,199
Speaker 0: you know, the mind somewhere pretty much the whole rest of the book is that they're in the train tunnels looking for Stuff, you know that trains gonna move duh.

429
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:10,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Chekhov's fucking train Chekhov's train Chekhov's uranium pile Chekhov's everything Chekhov's mind Chekhov's shape-changing ability.

00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at all our stuff on the internet.

433
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:19,942
Speaker 0: meta moment that was it.

00:27:20,283 --> 00:27:22,449
Speaker 0: oh do you have any other meta?

435
00:27:24,298 --> 00:27:24,610
Speaker 0: Nothing.

Speaker 0: burning con is coming.

438
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,464
Speaker 0: It's got 10 tech like I think some of it.

439
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:35,616
Speaker 1: because he's I'm still not I gotta figure that out still right because Apparently there's a special.

440
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:39,305
Speaker 1: I would normally under no circumstances skip burning con once a year.

441
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:42,094
Speaker 1: burning con for netrunner tournament Which is twice a month.

442
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,650
Speaker 1: Never would I do that, right, but it is not sold out yet.

443
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:55,813
Speaker 1: Oh, it is a special special netrunner tournament where the fantasy flight people are coming and doing all sorts of fancy stuff And this is could be a once-ever Situation.

444
00:27:56,274 --> 00:28:00,705
Speaker 1: but they're doing one at the strat on Saturday and they're doing another one somewhere in Brooklyn.

445
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:02,730
Speaker 1: That's hard to get to on Sunday.

446
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:04,309
Speaker 1: So it's like huh?

447
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:27,430
Speaker 1: I could skip the Sunday burning con and go to some weird store in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn somehow or I could skip like the first two sessions a burning con on Saturday and Go to the strat which is not a weird place with the people I know and maybe I'd still probably be able to make It to the night session of burning con on Saturday and then go to burning con Sunday.

448
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,520
Speaker 1: We got to see how it goes down.

449
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,970
Speaker 1: I got to figure it out.

450
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:32,914
Speaker 0: We'll see you by air.

451
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:33,457
Speaker 0: We got.

452
00:28:33,718 --> 00:28:36,530
Speaker 0: we got videos on the internet videos of our lectures from a million conventions.

453
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:39,017
Speaker 0: We're gonna be at magfest doing the same bullshit.

454
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:39,759
Speaker 0: We do every year.

455
00:28:40,161 --> 00:28:51,286
Speaker 0: Maybe some new bullshit that we're not gonna talk about because We're trying we're putting we're trying to put together something really magical something magical But we actually can't talk about it until we get a little further into the.

456
00:28:51,326 --> 00:28:52,412
Speaker 1: I don't want it The only.

457
00:28:52,593 --> 00:28:54,829
Speaker 1: normally I just talk about everything but it might not happen.

458
00:28:55,512 --> 00:28:57,298
Speaker 1: But the thing is I don't want to.

459
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:00,790
Speaker 1: if I say something we you know, somebody else might be upset.

460
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:02,574
Speaker 0: It's also weird.

461
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:07,190
Speaker 0: It's we have to make a lot of things line up for this to work the way we want it to work.

462
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:21,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't want people to maybe start spreading this but I will say if this happens The upcoming magfest will be the most magical magfest ever because not only will the magic happen Machine supremacy is gonna be performing there.

463
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:25,448
Speaker 1: They better not schedule any of our stuff during the machine supremacy tournament a concert.

464
00:29:27,171 --> 00:29:31,547
Speaker 1: I'm God, I will email it because if they do I'm just skipping my own shit.

465
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:39,270
Speaker 1: Yeah Over a decade to go to this concert to just have to do a panel which I can do which I do ten times a year.

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,738
Speaker 0: So Aladdin Yeah, I played that game on the Genesis.

470
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,870
Speaker 0: great game on the gen is actually a pretty good game really good mostly because that was one of the earlier games that had that Lion King and the Genesis is also really because they had that rid.

471
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:00,725
Speaker 0: They were just mediocre platformers really, but they had that ridiculous animation.

472
00:30:00,946 --> 00:30:02,290
Speaker 1: How about that Aladdin tiger LCD?

473
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,053
Speaker 1: That was a good one.

474
00:30:03,455 --> 00:30:05,770
Speaker 0: tiger LCDs were all without exception.

475
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,154
Speaker 0: Bullshit Aladdin.

Speaker 0: They were all terrible good one.

478
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,358
Speaker 0: Every one of them was terrible.

479
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:12,982
Speaker 0: They're original.

480
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:14,450
Speaker 1: The one was just lights and it was football.

481
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:14,872
Speaker 1: That wasn't.

482
00:30:14,893 --> 00:30:16,462
Speaker 1: even I don't even know tiger made that.

483
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:20,660
Speaker 0: that was good as like the first one I had I had of an ancient one from like the 70s.

484
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,025
Speaker 0: That's baseball good.

485
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:22,827
Speaker 0: It's not tiger.

486
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,510
Speaker 1: I like those ones.

487
00:30:23,751 --> 00:30:27,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, except there was a glitch now with the pac-man one that looks like a little arcade machine.

488
00:30:27,831 --> 00:30:31,906
Speaker 0: So in mine, it actually had a controller was to player right and a controller stuck out.

489
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:33,070
Speaker 0: you took turns pitching and batting.

490
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:48,120
Speaker 0: There was a way to hit the buttons in such a fashion as pitcher to where it was impossible to hit the pitch Nice, and my little brother would cry because he couldn't figure it out and I was an asshole and never told him Okay, so there we go.

491
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:54,759
Speaker 0: But no Aladdin the Disney film 21 years old.

492
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were born when Aladdin came out.

493
00:30:58,717 --> 00:31:00,883
Speaker 1: you can drink have a beer Aladdin.

494
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:04,682
Speaker 0: and yet when I thought oh Let's do a show on Aladdin.

495
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:07,387
Speaker 0: I Didn't feel like it was that long ago.

496
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:15,829
Speaker 1: If it was way long ago, yeah But yeah when I was a kid Aladdin was a big deal because basically Disney movies had.

497
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:22,802
Speaker 1: you know There was this time period when I was young when Disney was like on And then they sort of came back like Little Mermaid boom and they sort of.

498
00:31:23,103 --> 00:31:27,558
Speaker 1: there was that period where every single summer There was an animated Disney movie.

499
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:32,315
Speaker 1: That was super high production value and awesome and it was just boom boom Boom hit hit hit.

500
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:33,058
Speaker 1: right.

501
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,670
Speaker 1: and Aladdin was I mean the Little Mermaid?

502
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,230
Speaker 1: I didn't care about too much but Aladdin I cared about a lot.

503
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,950
Speaker 1: We had a VHS tape and we wore that thing the fuck out.

504
00:31:41,713 --> 00:31:50,413
Speaker 0: Well 92 saw Aladdin the Mighty Ducks Newsies the Muppet Christmas Carol and people say it was honey I blew up the kid.

505
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:57,090
Speaker 1: all the same year people say right like oh you you know movies aren't any worse than they used to be.

506
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,594
Speaker 1: It's just your perception.

507
00:31:58,755 --> 00:32:03,970
Speaker 1: No go look in the 90s pretty much every year had multiple all-time great.

508
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was 1992. go back one more year.

509
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,127
Speaker 0: You also get Beauty and the Beast White Fang Rocketeer Rocketeer and wild hearts can't be broke.

510
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,150
Speaker 1: Well that one fuck that one.

511
00:32:13,451 --> 00:32:17,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about horses and girls even know what the hell that is.

512
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:18,050
Speaker 0: girls and horses.

513
00:32:18,157 --> 00:32:20,858
Speaker 1: Yeah It's not a memorable one not rated very highly.

514
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:22,543
Speaker 1: go on Google and type in like.

515
00:32:22,543 --> 00:32:25,614
Speaker 1: 1992 movies 1993 movies 1994 movies.

516
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:34,510
Speaker 1: you'll just see greats greats greats and just as you keep going there is a gradual decline Starting around the early 2000 just like oh, there's less and less greats every year.

517
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,797
Speaker 1: Where did they go?

518
00:32:35,857 --> 00:32:37,707
Speaker 1: and it's all superhero movies and sequels.

519
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,728
Speaker 1: now the end.

520
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:42,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, there was a big dearth.

521
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,404
Speaker 0: I mean Oliver and company was the last movie that was big.

522
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,770
Speaker 0: that came out before the Little Mermaid.

523
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, then it was Little Mermaid rescuers down under Beauty and the Beast Aladdin Lion King.

524
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:58,950
Speaker 1: Then after Lion King they kept trying to keep it going but but it was hard and I think around Tarzan was the last one.

525
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:12,782
Speaker 0: Well when Pocahontas came out I remember because I was in middle school, and I was like really you're gonna make Pocahontas and The main love interest isn't even the guy she married in the real world Really, and then when it was hunchback.

526
00:33:12,822 --> 00:33:17,778
Speaker 0: I was like fuck this table Didn't watch Disney movies for a long time?

527
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:24,514
Speaker 1: no at least as a kid, but Aladdin was still Magical literally and figuratively Right.

528
00:33:24,856 --> 00:33:27,770
Speaker 1: so first of all Aladdin was way cool, right.

529
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,079
Speaker 1: It was all kind of action II with the magic carpet.

530
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,048
Speaker 0: You know I remember watching Aladdin over and over again as a kid.

531
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:34,569
Speaker 0: yeah.

532
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,163
Speaker 1: Secondly Robin Williams genie you can't you can't ignore that.

533
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,067
Speaker 1: that's like 90% of the movie.

534
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, how can we not?

535
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:42,136
Speaker 1: you can't.

536
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:44,285
Speaker 1: that's like the first thing and I feel like it.

537
00:33:44,345 --> 00:33:46,388
Speaker 0: funny still good It worries me.

538
00:33:46,872 --> 00:33:54,610
Speaker 0: I think that that was the first Disney movie to do That level of pop culture reference to that degree.

539
00:33:56,392 --> 00:34:01,230
Speaker 1: But notice the pop culture references were two things that were way old.

540
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,038
Speaker 1: They didn't do any references to things that were contemporary.

541
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,204
Speaker 0: is contemporary bullshit exactly?

542
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:10,828
Speaker 0: Aladdin would be like referencing I don't know Bugs Bunny today exactly.

543
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:15,429
Speaker 1: so Aladdin all its references are really old so it comes off like a Looney Tunes.

544
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:18,306
Speaker 1: It doesn't come off like a Shrek or it's you know if you made a.

545
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:23,241
Speaker 0: you know Looney Tunes were not References to old things when they were happening.

546
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:25,389
Speaker 1: no they weren't but it works now.

547
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:28,681
Speaker 1: So when Shrek is way old is it gonna look like Looney Tunes.

548
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,527
Speaker 0: No because Shrek movies are bullshit.

549
00:34:30,628 --> 00:34:31,210
Speaker 1: That's right.

550
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,016
Speaker 1: And Aladdin doesn't have that many.

551
00:34:34,036 --> 00:34:36,583
Speaker 1: Aladdin isn't heavy on the pop culture references.

552
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:37,748
Speaker 1: It just has a few up.

553
00:34:38,612 --> 00:34:41,989
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say it's heavy on them because there's a lot of other stuff going on.

554
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,697
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it is they.

555
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:48,790
Speaker 0: they're a significant portion of the humorous dialogue.

556
00:34:49,232 --> 00:34:49,936
Speaker 1: Some amount of it.

557
00:34:50,076 --> 00:34:52,469
Speaker 1: it says it's just gonna genie does impressions a lot.

558
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,978
Speaker 1: That's the biggest part of that you know.

559
00:34:53,998 --> 00:34:58,590
Speaker 1: and there's also some other Some jokes in one-liners here that refer to things.

560
00:34:58,831 --> 00:34:59,816
Speaker 0: I think it was also just that.

561
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,249
Speaker 0: in general a lot of the cast was pretty big.

562
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:06,750
Speaker 0: So there was a. you know this is kind of from the era when Billy Crystal was still a big deal.

563
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:19,642
Speaker 0: he wasn't in this movie, but people like that were doing voice acting for movies and Now there's nostalgia for a lot of those kinds of actors because they're not in the cut those kinds of things as much anymore Mmm.

564
00:35:19,663 --> 00:35:20,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know.

565
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:25,586
Speaker 1: Aladdin has what a lot you know pretty much the right mix of all the things right.

566
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,950
Speaker 1: It's got the pile of comedy.

567
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,363
Speaker 1: It's got less of the mushy mushy stuff that you know.

568
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:33,570
Speaker 1: say Beauty the Beast would have more of you're gonna.

569
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:34,236
Speaker 0: What is this 1992?

570
00:35:34,236 --> 00:35:34,559
Speaker 0: That's right?

571
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,252
Speaker 0: Wish he was.

572
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:36,976
Speaker 1: how old was I?

573
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:39,590
Speaker 1: when I watch this I'm trying to go back into the past.

574
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:47,605
Speaker 0: Yeah when I was the I'm right Jack my only impression of the mushy mushy stuff in Beauty and the Beast was that the beast was Way cooler as a beast and was kind of lame when he turned back into a person.

575
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:55,270
Speaker 1: 100% true Yep, 100% right, but the other thing Aladdin really had is that the bad guys?

576
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,838
Speaker 1: Were actually somewhat likable and interesting.

577
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:06,529
Speaker 1: Jafar is one of my favorite Disney villains ever right, and he's got you know Iago sidekick I'm the bird from Aladdin.

578
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:15,370
Speaker 1: You kidding me all right so but you look at say Beauty and the Beast right, and it's what that Gaston guy.

579
00:36:15,651 --> 00:36:15,912
Speaker 1: It's like.

580
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:16,714
Speaker 1: no one likes him.

581
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:17,437
Speaker 1: He's just a jerk.

582
00:36:17,818 --> 00:36:23,770
Speaker 1: there was someone at Kinetic on cosplaying is there was good great cosplay But it's like he's just an asshole.

583
00:36:24,672 --> 00:36:26,261
Speaker 1: It was the bad guy in Little Mermaid.

584
00:36:26,663 --> 00:36:27,729
Speaker 1: there really isn't one.

585
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:32,150
Speaker 0: Gaston wasn't the bad guy in Beauty and the Beast Beauty the Beast was much more complicated.

586
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:32,993
Speaker 0: There wasn't course.

587
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:34,920
Speaker 0: the bad guy was the Beast himself.

588
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:39,690
Speaker 0: He was his own bad guy, but villains villains are.

589
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,398
Speaker 1: What makes awesomeness right?

590
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:45,948
Speaker 0: What makes awesome Disney animated Star Wars Luke Skywalker?

591
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:46,549
Speaker 1: No?

592
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:47,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, Darth Vader.

Speaker 0: Obi-wan also yes.

595
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:54,848
Speaker 1: Han Solo also yes, but not as yes as Darth Vader.

00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:55,470
Speaker 0: 3po not so much.

00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:56,635
Speaker 1: What was the number?

598
00:36:56,816 --> 00:36:58,624
Speaker 1: there are many reasons why episode 1 is shit.

599
00:36:58,905 --> 00:36:59,890
Speaker 1: the number one reason?

600
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:03,413
Speaker 1: Episode 1 is shit cuz Darth Maul was shit Right.

601
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:06,884
Speaker 1: if it should have been if there's more mall that would have saved half that movie.

602
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,550
Speaker 0: Darth Maul should have been a square boss.

603
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,755
Speaker 1: That's exactly should have been.

604
00:37:09,815 --> 00:37:10,338
Speaker 1: so he was.

605
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,110
Speaker 1: they had all the character design the double lightsaber.

606
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,820
Speaker 1: They could have made him the next Darth Vader instead.

607
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:17,928
Speaker 1: no one gives a fuck about Darth Maul.

608
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:18,490
Speaker 1: fuck him.

609
00:37:19,074 --> 00:37:20,950
Speaker 0: I gave a fuck until I saw that movie.

610
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:27,810
Speaker 0: But Jafar and Iago way awesome Jafar wins for one reason one primary Jafar is a lot like rezo.

611
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:35,510
Speaker 0: He's so thin and his face is so tall and his mouth is sometimes so tiny and sometimes bigger than his head.

612
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:38,958
Speaker 0: That is why I like Jafar also.

613
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:40,785
Speaker 0: He's evil, and he's smart.

614
00:37:40,805 --> 00:37:41,507
Speaker 0: look at his plot.

615
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:41,788
Speaker 0: He's like.

616
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:42,752
Speaker 0: I'm doing this I'm doing this.

617
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:45,102
Speaker 0: I'm doing this and it basically does it.

618
00:37:45,243 --> 00:37:49,359
Speaker 0: It's just he gets the lamp, and he's like yeah What now I wish I'm the most powerful wizard ever.

619
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:50,644
Speaker 0: fuck y'all that's right.

620
00:37:50,704 --> 00:37:52,310
Speaker 1: boom goes the dynamite.

621
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,153
Speaker 1: What you gonna?

622
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:53,214
Speaker 1: Do?

623
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:54,398
Speaker 1: what are you gonna?

624
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:54,599
Speaker 1: Do?

625
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:55,924
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a Disney movie, otherwise.

626
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:56,988
Speaker 1: I would not have lost.

627
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,876
Speaker 1: yep uh Let's see what else.

628
00:38:00,916 --> 00:38:02,204
Speaker 1: What's not good about Aladdin.

629
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:09,479
Speaker 1: Uh well Culturalism yeah that I didn't recognize it But now is so blatantly obvious.

630
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:18,402
Speaker 0: the thing is it's it doesn't bother me for the reasons You'd expect because when the movie came out American culture really was completely tone-deaf to that kind of thing.

631
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:20,430
Speaker 0: no one's no one even noticed.

632
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,500
Speaker 0: No in general pop culture and but look it's like you know.

633
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,235
Speaker 1: if we did had made progress by that point right it wasn't song Of the south.

634
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:28,609
Speaker 1: we've learned that lesson up.

635
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,813
Speaker 1: We just didn't learn.

636
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:37,993
Speaker 0: what bothers me is not the things people complain about about this movie in a general sense with Arabic or Persian culture.

637
00:38:38,474 --> 00:38:50,268
Speaker 0: what bothers me about it is that the characters themselves do not act in any way like the archetypes of Those actual kinds of stories and do not draw at all from that culture except to the most superficial manner.

638
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:53,396
Speaker 0: yeah Aladdin is not an Aladdin.

639
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:56,845
Speaker 0: He's not a character from that world in that era at that time.

640
00:38:56,945 --> 00:39:02,759
Speaker 0: Aladdin is a 90s American Stereotypical snotty boy, that's right.

641
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,104
Speaker 0: He is a Bart Simpson.

642
00:39:04,165 --> 00:39:05,290
Speaker 0: He is a Zach Morris.

643
00:39:05,711 --> 00:39:07,980
Speaker 1: Totally is way more Zach Morris than a Bart Simpson.

644
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's an earlier Bart Simpson, but yes Jack What are they?

645
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:12,015
Speaker 0: they're the.

646
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:13,379
Speaker 0: they're the cool slacker kid.

647
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,370
Speaker 0: yep the they're they're they're sticking their.

648
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,716
Speaker 1: No one likes Aladdin.

649
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,439
Speaker 1: everyone like this.

650
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:21,187
Speaker 1: it's all about sidekicks in this movie.

651
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:24,759
Speaker 1: right Iago Genie carpet Apu the monkey.

652
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,749
Speaker 0: yep right even the tiger a tiger tiger, right?

653
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,724
Speaker 1: It's all about the sidekicks all the all the main characters.

654
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:31,730
Speaker 1: Sultan sucks.

655
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:45,030
Speaker 0: I like the Sultan right in fact for even though it's for Aladdin and Jasmine, so I don't know why but for whatever reason Every time I picture the Emperor in the Prince of Nothing I picture him is looking like the Sultan from Aladdin.

656
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,073
Speaker 0: Yes, what?

657
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:47,197
Speaker 0: what?

658
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:48,582
Speaker 0: because that makes everything.

659
00:39:48,662 --> 00:39:54,020
Speaker 1: I think of him looking like evil Julius Caesar Who's got like some sort of wilting disease except that he's old.

660
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,969
Speaker 1: so I know you're talking about the cinemas, or are you talking about?

661
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,421
Speaker 1: This deal whatever?

662
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:04,415
Speaker 1: yeah Not zinnim is Serious.

663
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,484
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm talking about serious right anyway.

664
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:07,428
Speaker 1: No not canvas.

665
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:14,350
Speaker 0: no No canvas is like a perfect Adonis of a stupid people with their ex named ex like six religion sins.

666
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:15,433
Speaker 1: Yeah, I picked.

667
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:17,118
Speaker 1: your confidence is like Alexander the Great.

668
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:22,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, which is picturing this his uncle as being the Sultan from Aladdin.

669
00:40:24,913 --> 00:40:39,249
Speaker 0: That's just how I picture him great But yeah, but my problem is just that the characters act from 90s Western culture perspectives despite the fact that they are superficially Persian.

670
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:39,891
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

671
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:46,852
Speaker 0: that is the part that bothers me not the the lyrics of that opening song or anything else and the stereotype of the evil Vizier.

672
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:47,274
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

673
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,623
Speaker 0: in the real world viziers are 99% evil.

674
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:57,877
Speaker 1: yeah No, I'm more bothered by the stereotype of the guy at the beginning like it was like the little the like the the Bedouin You know merchant ghosting in his song.

675
00:40:58,298 --> 00:40:58,820
Speaker 1: Yeah.

676
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:58,981
Speaker 1: No.

677
00:40:59,021 --> 00:40:59,362
Speaker 1: He's like.

678
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,486
Speaker 1: Oh check this lamp.

679
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:01,630
Speaker 1: Let me tell you this story.

680
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,319
Speaker 1: Oh, I am all stereotypical.

681
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:08,829
Speaker 0: I might as well be in punch-out Yeah, but he bothered me less than the fact that Aladdin just looked like.

682
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,330
Speaker 1: so Yeah, I mean he bothers me as much as soda pop in ski vodka drink.

683
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:13,776
Speaker 0: Right it's.

684
00:41:13,997 --> 00:41:14,984
Speaker 1: it's the same amount of.

685
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:18,955
Speaker 1: you know nationalistic Stereotype you know racist bullshit.

686
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:24,770
Speaker 0: Yep if anything what this movie taught us between this and the Lion King is that Disney hates uncles.

687
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:28,769
Speaker 0: Sure uncles and viziers are the worst possible people.

688
00:41:31,674 --> 00:41:32,929
Speaker 1: So it's got some songs.

689
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,456
Speaker 1: Musical like a Disney movie is but I think what puts it ahead of other Disney movies is that Multiples of the songs are good.

690
00:41:40,516 --> 00:41:43,686
Speaker 1: like I would listen to that if I came up on mp3 player.

691
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:44,869
Speaker 1: I would not push next.

692
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:49,970
Speaker 0: You know it's funny because I have a digital piano like with weighted keys like it's a full-on piano.

693
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:55,312
Speaker 0: It's the kind of thing you'd use on a stage in a concert if you didn't want to have a real piano for a lot Of reasons.

694
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:58,303
Speaker 0: a professional electronic piano, but it's old.

695
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,170
Speaker 0: it costs a lot of money.

696
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,138
Speaker 0: But we got it in the 90s.

697
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,257
Speaker 0: so it holds up pretty well today, but for its time It was good technology.

698
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,349
Speaker 0: it has MIDI capabilities And it was pre-loaded with a bunch of songs to kind of show off how what it can do.

699
00:42:12,632 --> 00:42:16,390
Speaker 0: Two of those songs are from Aladdin nice nice.

700
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:21,046
Speaker 0: So that really shows you the widespread idness of Aladdin getting in everyone's business.

701
00:42:21,066 --> 00:42:23,429
Speaker 1: like other Disney movies You know even the musical ones.

702
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:23,771
Speaker 1: It's like.

703
00:42:23,852 --> 00:42:27,570
Speaker 1: maybe they have one song you like or maybe they have zero.

704
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:34,859
Speaker 0: There is a song from from another Disney movie that is better than any song in Aladdin Which is be prepared in The Lion King.

705
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,862
Speaker 1: that one's okay?

706
00:42:35,922 --> 00:42:38,670
Speaker 0: That's that might be my favorite Disney song ever.

707
00:42:40,693 --> 00:42:41,258
Speaker 1: Jungle Book.

708
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,370
Speaker 1: it's hard to beat Alright Robin Hood you and your Robin Hood.

709
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:52,205
Speaker 0: I really like that Robin Hood.

710
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:52,850
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it.

711
00:42:52,972 --> 00:42:58,786
Speaker 0: I I have not seen that Robin Hood since I was a little kid.

712
00:42:59,007 --> 00:42:59,909
Speaker 0: I kind of want to see it again.

713
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:04,348
Speaker 1: Anyway, and also Dumbo tough tough to beat whoa.

714
00:43:04,388 --> 00:43:04,810
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

715
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:12,001
Speaker 0: There's a. I just learned something crazy about that Robin Hood that I got to remember to look up later What it had an alternate ending.

716
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:13,990
Speaker 0: that's way different cool?

717
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:15,997
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of words.

718
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:16,781
Speaker 0: I gotta read those later.

719
00:43:16,821 --> 00:43:16,902
Speaker 0: Okay.

720
00:43:16,942 --> 00:43:25,790
Speaker 0: I didn't know that anyway anyway, uh I Wonder if we watch this now if we would find the genie at any point fun.

721
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:30,488
Speaker 1: Well, I I think I'd find it funny when I was a kid, but I'd memorize.

722
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,070
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

723
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,273
Speaker 0: It's all jokes like that those.

724
00:43:34,314 --> 00:43:36,580
Speaker 0: just the thing is those jokes feel likely.

725
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:45,168
Speaker 0: those kinds of jokes that kind of delivery is cliche in Animated kids movies today, but back then it kind of made the cliche.

726
00:43:45,188 --> 00:43:45,288
Speaker 1: yep.

727
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:53,207
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like when you read old Heinlein you're like What is this super stereotypical sci-fi bullshit, it's like no that was the first story to do that.

728
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:59,997
Speaker 1: shut up shut up Yeah, I think I still find it funny mostly because when I was a kid I watched it so many times.

729
00:44:00,078 --> 00:44:13,210
Speaker 1: it lost funniness simply because I 100% memorized everything and now I've forgotten as much of it over the course of 20-something years that It's probably some of it will come back to me like oh, I remember that lols.

730
00:44:13,431 --> 00:44:16,727
Speaker 0: I remember being annoyed at his wishes because he was just dumb.

731
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,601
Speaker 1: but that okay Yeah, I forgot to mention, but the real Aladdin was dealt.

732
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:29,450
Speaker 1: the real Aladdin the real Aladdin The story of Aladdin was equally done with his way No, but I think that what bothered me not so much was what he used the wishes on Aladdin because Aladdin is already done.

733
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:38,070
Speaker 1: It's the manner mostly of the second wish right where he's just sort of like drowning and the genie shakes him And that makes his head nod and he's like okay, and that counts as a witch.

734
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,777
Speaker 0: It's like fuck you, but he would have died.

735
00:44:39,797 --> 00:44:41,122
Speaker 1: that doesn't count as a wish.

736
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:45,709
Speaker 1: you could pick him up nope He did all sorts of other stuff for him without making a wish.

737
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:52,270
Speaker 0: See if I were him I would have wished to have all the powers of a genie without any of the restrictions of a genie.

738
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,338
Speaker 1: But it's like he wished to be a prince.

739
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:57,630
Speaker 1: He's like okay, but he gets all this other shit to go along with it.

740
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:04,985
Speaker 1: It's like where the hell that come from that's all the yakuza amount of being a prince Yeah, and it gets like free travel to places like prismo only.

741
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:06,330
Speaker 0: It's the reverse of a monkey spa.

742
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:14,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, he basically gave him way too much stuff for free and then you know he gave him the the freebie to like you know Get him out of the desert or whatever.

743
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:15,699
Speaker 0: Why didn't he?

744
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,027
Speaker 0: just well because princes don't come from tombs.

745
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:22,819
Speaker 1: no remember He was like oh that you know there's a. he tricked him in early in the movie And he like.

746
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:28,270
Speaker 1: he's like oh, you know a man I'd like to gather this desert or whatever or out of the cave and he tricked him and they went to an oasis.

747
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:30,530
Speaker 1: Right and they didn't cost him a wish for that.

748
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:33,142
Speaker 1: So why did it cost him a wish to go out of the bottom of the ocean?

749
00:45:33,424 --> 00:45:40,123
Speaker 1: the genie is clearly capable Basically if you can't off girth the rules of just kind of a dip.

750
00:45:40,163 --> 00:45:42,350
Speaker 0: maybe the genie has inscrutable rules.

751
00:45:43,071 --> 00:45:46,184
Speaker 1: Because he is the genie was not sticking to the letter of the law.

752
00:45:46,304 --> 00:45:47,530
Speaker 1: a rules lawyer would affect that.

753
00:45:48,673 --> 00:45:54,954
Speaker 0: The rules are incomprehensible to mere mortals, and he is acting on a different plane that we cannot apprehend sure Notice?

754
00:45:55,094 --> 00:45:58,410
Speaker 0: I said apprehend and not comprehend right whatever?

755
00:45:59,474 --> 00:46:00,565
Speaker 0: It could be something like that.

756
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:08,393
Speaker 0: Hmm, but Aladdin should just wish to be an all-powerful wizard, and then done all the rest of it himself also.

757
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:22,544
Speaker 0: a Part of the moral of the story is if you want to get with a girl You need to totally fake it until to trick her into going with you And then you can apologize later for that and still get all you did.

758
00:46:22,684 --> 00:46:29,429
Speaker 1: all you did wrong was just lie about Being a prince, and then she totally saw through it because he's a doof and it didn't matter.

759
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:33,361
Speaker 1: But that the only thing she was mad about was the fact that he lied.

760
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:40,383
Speaker 1: yep the end, but it's like If she was you know as intelligent as she you know acts right.

761
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,667
Speaker 1: she acts like she's really smart.

762
00:46:41,807 --> 00:46:42,810
Speaker 1: you believe that she's smart.

763
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:48,330
Speaker 1: But if she's so smart she like oh He obviously has to do this because he doesn't realize I don't care.

764
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:52,049
Speaker 1: So if I just said that I don't care he would have been like oh, okay good.

765
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:56,452
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm just Aladdin, but she didn't say that It's like.

766
00:46:56,553 --> 00:46:57,597
Speaker 1: obviously he has to lie.

767
00:46:57,638 --> 00:46:58,702
Speaker 1: you couldn't get in the palace.

768
00:46:58,762 --> 00:47:00,430
Speaker 1: otherwise what the fuck was he supposed to do?

769
00:47:01,811 --> 00:47:06,775
Speaker 0: Wish to be an all-powerful wizard and just appear in the palace be like yo It's me Aladdin.

770
00:47:06,795 --> 00:47:07,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, seriously.

771
00:47:07,881 --> 00:47:08,564
Speaker 1: She didn't be like.

772
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:09,750
Speaker 1: oh, it's you Aladdin.

773
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:12,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, I slowly saw through your thing.

774
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:16,919
Speaker 1: You don't have to be lying anymore because whatevs I like you even though whatever, but she didn't say that.

775
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,930
Speaker 1: so really it's they're both dumbasses.

776
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:21,354
Speaker 0: Did you ever watch the sequel?

777
00:47:21,976 --> 00:47:22,358
Speaker 1: okay?

778
00:47:22,398 --> 00:47:23,481
Speaker 0: So sequels.

779
00:47:23,942 --> 00:47:26,370
Speaker 1: I watched the second and third movie.

780
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:27,674
Speaker 0: I watched the second.

781
00:47:27,955 --> 00:47:30,222
Speaker 0: I got it on a VHS tape from a supermarket.

782
00:47:30,462 --> 00:47:31,726
Speaker 1: the return of Jafar.

783
00:47:31,846 --> 00:47:34,416
Speaker 1: people do not like But I like.

784
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,681
Speaker 0: here's my problem with.

785
00:47:35,742 --> 00:47:38,974
Speaker 0: I like the genie's powers Severely diminished.

786
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:39,799
Speaker 0: you come bullshit.

787
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:40,302
Speaker 0: Yes.

788
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,610
Speaker 0: I don't even matter anymore.

789
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:47,470
Speaker 1: But the second one has one good song in it which right for a direct-to-video.

790
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,343
Speaker 1: That's pretty damn good right there right to pull off with that movie.

791
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:53,090
Speaker 1: the second movie did with a direct-to-video.

792
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:54,536
Speaker 1: I like it.

793
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:55,804
Speaker 1: I saw it less times.

794
00:47:55,844 --> 00:47:56,690
Speaker 1: We did have it on tape.

795
00:47:56,911 --> 00:47:57,956
Speaker 1: I couldn't had it on anything else.

796
00:47:58,037 --> 00:48:00,630
Speaker 1: yeah, and I saw it less times and less reason might have it.

797
00:48:00,691 --> 00:48:01,562
Speaker 0: You got a laserdisc.

798
00:48:01,928 --> 00:48:08,026
Speaker 1: no But that second one I liked third one was basically the same as the Aladdin TV show.

799
00:48:08,326 --> 00:48:08,948
Speaker 1: take it or leave it.

800
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:12,770
Speaker 0: Huh apparently Robin Williams originally didn't want to play the genie.

801
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,620
Speaker 1: Really, what did he want to do?

802
00:48:15,841 --> 00:48:17,870
Speaker 0: they created a reel of his stand-up?

803
00:48:18,511 --> 00:48:23,111
Speaker 0: And they animated it with the genie and then they just forced him to watch it and he laughed so hard He's letting.

804
00:48:23,131 --> 00:48:24,094
Speaker 0: he agreed to do the project.

805
00:48:24,294 --> 00:48:25,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, could you not?

806
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:27,965
Speaker 0: yeah, I wonder if that's available.

807
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,590
Speaker 0: What do I can find that real?

808
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:32,297
Speaker 0: But yeah, I did not like.

809
00:48:32,337 --> 00:48:33,785
Speaker 1: that would be the most amazing thing.

810
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:36,194
Speaker 0: if you could find it on YouTube I'm gonna type for it right now.

811
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,257
Speaker 1: I've been like Robin.

812
00:48:37,277 --> 00:48:39,022
Speaker 0: Did you watch the TV show?

813
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,610
Speaker 1: I watched some episodes of the TV show.

814
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,888
Speaker 1: It's not that good It's terrible.

815
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,010
Speaker 1: It looks like those are just clips from the movie.

816
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't find it with.

817
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:58,005
Speaker 1: I might have to do a little more research to find it sure But yet the story behind the TV show I read this whole article about.

818
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:06,210
Speaker 1: I think I might have made it thing of the day News once or something but basically there was an article that I'm not gonna search for now that talked about why Disney Afternoon died and basically it was cuz.

819
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:15,944
Speaker 1: Executives at Disney kept switching around and the there's some executives at Disney that really valued the high quality Animation on TV and that was the era of the Disney Afternoon.

820
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:25,309
Speaker 1: and the executives switched Right sometime in those early 90s around the Aladdin, you know times and those executives are like hey We just want to make a lot of monies.

821
00:49:25,711 --> 00:49:34,233
Speaker 1: Let's take our hot movie properties turn them into TV shows and use that and that way we can sell the same movie and TV merch and Monies.

822
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:36,942
Speaker 1: and who cares about if it's any good and it wasn't any good.

823
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:37,685
Speaker 0: No good.

824
00:49:38,247 --> 00:49:39,994
Speaker 1: Not where you know DuckTales.

825
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to watch.

826
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:42,989
Speaker 1: it does a torrent for every DuckTales.

827
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:49,150
Speaker 1: You're downloading that shit - nobody's serving or downloading the torrent of every Aladdin TV episode.

828
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,104
Speaker 1: I shouldn't say that because someone probably is but DuckTales torrents probably got mad seeds.

829
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:54,870
Speaker 1: Yo mad seeds.

830
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,810
Speaker 0: So Maybe we should watch the movie again and we can do a little follow-up to see if it holds up.

831
00:50:01,253 --> 00:50:01,957
Speaker 1: I bet it does.

832
00:50:01,977 --> 00:50:02,803
Speaker 0: I'll bet it does too.

833
00:50:02,823 --> 00:50:06,520
Speaker 0: I Really want to watch the furry Robin Hood again.

834
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,410
Speaker 0: now all you how about the Aristocats?

835
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:11,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's okay.

836
00:50:11,835 --> 00:50:13,661
Speaker 0: I remember really liking the Aristocats as a kid.

837
00:50:14,062 --> 00:50:17,854
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of them are not you know bad It's all.

838
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:19,299
Speaker 1: these movies are pretty good.

839
00:50:19,339 --> 00:50:22,289
