1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,569
Speaker 0: It's Monday, June 5th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:09,710
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,264
Speaker 1: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,680
Speaker 0: - And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,197
Speaker 0: Tonight we're talking about technology adoption and where that line is.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,715
Speaker 0: Mostly for us.

7
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,178
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:24,739
Speaker 0: Ah, do I have an opening event?

9
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:26,420
Speaker 0: Anything happen?

10
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,817
Speaker 1: I mean, I can, but it's not...

11
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,138
Speaker 0: Ah, we went biking.

12
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,143
Speaker 0: Ahh.

13
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:36,959
Speaker 0: Biking home from work the other week.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,100
Speaker 0: A crazy guy just threatened to kill me kind of randomly and I just got away from him.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,420
Speaker 1: Why does this happen to you, whereas I biked to work so many times?

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,260
Speaker 0: It was the weirdest, like, it was the weirdest thing that ever happened.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,160
Speaker 0: No altercation, this wasn't even like a car honks and I flip him off.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,179
Speaker 0: It was like I'm sitting in the bike lane on a city bike, like, in an actual separated bike lane just waiting at a light.

19
00:00:57,021 --> 00:01:00,300
Speaker 0: And I hear a person talking and I'm just not thinking, I'm ignoring them.

20
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:06,279
Speaker 0: And then I realize that the person's talking to me and it's a dude just in a car that's in the lane next to me.

21
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,319
Speaker 0: Just, the car has no license plates on it at all.

22
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:19,340
Speaker 0: And the dude is like looking at me through his closed front window, but the rear window is open and he's just like talking at me and gesticulating.

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,939
Speaker 0: And then he's like, pay attention to me when I'm talking to you.

24
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:27,840
Speaker 0: So I look at him and then he just starts saying, you fucking bikes got to get off the road.

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,100
Speaker 0: You're going to get people killed and just starts going off on a weird rent.

26
00:01:31,502 --> 00:01:37,940
Speaker 0: And I tried to bike away and he started to follow me like through the red light, right at, right at, uh, like near the UN.

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,340
Speaker 0: So I just got out my phone and pretended to call the police and he booked it.

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,099
Speaker 0: And that was the end of that.

29
00:01:45,143 --> 00:01:49,920
Speaker 0: It was just, it was weird because I didn't, I just heard a voice and I didn't think anything of it.

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,360
Speaker 0: And then the guy was getting increasingly agitated that I wasn't looking at him.

31
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:57,360
Speaker 0: The no license plate thing was the cream of the crop.

32
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,740
Speaker 0: So I figured I could just like the, the pretend to call the police.

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,739
Speaker 1: This is why we need Spider-Man.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,193
Speaker 0: Yeah.

35
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:06,120
Speaker 0: That's the exact kind of thing Spider-Man could deal with effectively.

36
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,440
Speaker 1: Spider-Man could deal with that so perfectly.

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,940
Speaker 1: That guy would be hanging by a web, right?

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,119
Speaker 1: Spider-Man would throw his car in the East river.

39
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:17,237
Speaker 1: Spider-Man's strong enough to pick up a car.

40
00:02:20,162 --> 00:02:23,260
Speaker 1: He can take the dude, even if the dude has a gun or whatever.

41
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:24,738
Speaker 1: No problem.

42
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:32,180
Speaker 0: Uh, that was the most, that was the most exciting thing that happened to me other than just like biking normally.

43
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,199
Speaker 1: If I find a genie, I'm going to wish to be Spider-Man.

44
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,980
Speaker 1: We don't need to be Superman.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,499
Speaker 1: We can keep it easier than that.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,298
Speaker 0: Which Spider-Man?

47
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:40,999
Speaker 1: Regular Spider-Man.

48
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,379
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it could be Scott Spider-Man like whole new Spider-Man.

49
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,211
Speaker 1: As long as you're strong enough to pick up a car and you get web shooters.

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,839
Speaker 1: What else do you need?

52
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:53,300
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a couple other things you need.

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,198
Speaker 1: You need Spidey sense.

54
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:55,480
Speaker 0: You need Spidey sense.

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,220
Speaker 0: Like you need, but those are, that's just part of his powers.

56
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,140
Speaker 1: Those three things.

57
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,699
Speaker 1: That's all you got.

58
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,220
Speaker 0: I'd argue there's two more things, but both of these, well, one of these might just be another Spider-Man power.

59
00:03:04,381 --> 00:03:08,600
Speaker 0: And the other one I think is the plot of this overall into the Spider-Verse world.

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,680
Speaker 0: You need S tier wise cracking skills.

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,579
Speaker 0: You have to be able to wise crack in any situation at all times and never stop.

62
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,340
Speaker 0: Not all the time.

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,016
Speaker 0: Able to do it.

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,260
Speaker 0: A few Spider-Men.

65
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:23,379
Speaker 1: Deadpool does it all the time.

66
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,099
Speaker 1: Spider-Man only does it at the beginning of the comic book.

67
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,378
Speaker 1: And then he doesn't do it at the opening scene where he catches some normal bad guys when he does it.

68
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:36,840
Speaker 1: And then maybe when he fights the mainville and he does it a little bit, but then he's serious the time.

69
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:46,194
Speaker 0: I guess you got to be able to wise crack in any moment if you need to, because occasionally there's a Spider-Man where the wise, it's really just, you have to be able to say, you know, it's like.

70
00:03:46,761 --> 00:04:01,754
Speaker 1: The wise cracking is mostly for the entertainment of the reader, but if you're an actual Spider-Man in the real world, you just need to be able to say something to make the opponent angry and, you know, flustered, combobulated.

71
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,977
Speaker 0: So the listener has a question for you.

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,180
Speaker 0: Would Spider-Scott work on Fridays?

73
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,740
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, with great power, great responsibility, right?

74
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,560
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't have a very important job, so why?

75
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,839
Speaker 1: But if I'm from Spider-Man, well, first of all, right.

76
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:35,540
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if somebody dies on Friday and I'm Spider-Man and I could have saved them with no effort and they die because I didn't want to work that day and I wasn't fighting a super villain or something more important that was going to kill more people.

77
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:36,356
Speaker 1: Right.

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,299
Speaker 1: Then in a way, I killed them so that you can't have that.

79
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,740
Speaker 0: And the other important thing is Spider-Man always has to try to save both people.

80
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:47,599
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, you got to try.

81
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:48,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to try.

82
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,024
Speaker 0: That's the.

83
00:04:49,146 --> 00:04:49,899
Speaker 0: I think that depends.

84
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:50,839
Speaker 1: Depends what's going on.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,740
Speaker 0: So, you know, I feel like Spider-Man always tries and I feel like that's where Spider-Verse is going.

86
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,520
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's, uh, you know, I haven't done a Monday show in a hot minute because a bunch of reasons and we're back and it turns out today is Apple Day.

87
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:05,920
Speaker 0: And also there's a ton of tech news.

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,398
Speaker 1: So we're only going to talk about two things.

89
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,599
Speaker 1: Everything was timed well for us.

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,219
Speaker 1: Not like some other times where there's been big tech news on Tuesdays.

91
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:14,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got big tech.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,116
Speaker 1: I think it's because it's a WW.

93
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,160
Speaker 1: I think there's always, if I look historically, I don't remember.

94
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:25,218
Speaker 1: But I, you know, cause I only really remember that like the iPhones are always in September, October for back to school.

95
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,580
Speaker 1: But, and the WWDC is in the summer.

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:36,479
Speaker 1: I don't remember exactly when, but I get the feeling WWDC probably is always on Monday because it's a conference for all the devs and they start and do a whole week.

97
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:41,600
Speaker 1: So I bet if we look historically, WWDC has been kind to our Monday shows.

98
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,459
Speaker 0: Of course, I also have this feeling that I remember us always saying, man, why couldn't this have been yesterday?

99
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:58,416
Speaker 1: But was that just because I mean, it could be that I'm just guessing wrong because I didn't actually look up when these things happened, but I'm betting that those are all not WWDCs.

100
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,300
Speaker 1: Those are all other, you know, tech announcements on other days, right?

101
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,640
Speaker 0: Anyway, so there's a bunch of really long show.

102
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:10,219
Speaker 1: Let's, let's talk about all that.

103
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,200
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of minor Apple updates, which, you know, always happens.

104
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:21,820
Speaker 0: Like the one that actually stood out to me, stood out to me was that they're removing the hay from hay Siri.

105
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:24,019
Speaker 1: And really?

106
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,396
Speaker 1: Okay.

107
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,220
Speaker 1: I don't think that it's not that significant.

108
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,619
Speaker 1: Who cares?

109
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,779
Speaker 0: In that Siri, when I do have it enabled, likes to chime in.

110
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:32,340
Speaker 1: I never have it enabled.

111
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:33,398
Speaker 0: I tried it out.

112
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,380
Speaker 0: And what I found is that Siri likes to chime in and try to answer.

113
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,000
Speaker 1: I don't think I've used it since the day Siri launched.

114
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:40,819
Speaker 1: Whenever, whatever day that was.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,255
Speaker 0: But it does that a lot.

116
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:48,279
Speaker 0: And I see other people who have it enabled all the time, like at work or it'll just chime in all the time.

117
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:53,620
Speaker 0: So I feel like removing part of the wake you up thing is not the best idea.

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,200
Speaker 0: Cause I don't think they've got a technological advancement that enables this.

119
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,740
Speaker 0: I think it's just ease of use.

120
00:06:58,901 --> 00:07:00,240
Speaker 1: It's just a UI change basis.

121
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,119
Speaker 1: It's just a UI change.

122
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:01,453
Speaker 0: Yup.

123
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:09,980
Speaker 0: But it's a UI that is a new type of sort of trigger UI to cause an audio interaction.

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,640
Speaker 1: But really, I just think.

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,540
Speaker 1: I don't see this as any different as like, oh, they changed where the icons are, right?

126
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,520
Speaker 1: It's just because it's an audio interface instead of a visual interface.

127
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,740
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it seems different, but.

128
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,718
Speaker 0: I bet we'll see people having it activate more often and complaining about it.

129
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:28,280
Speaker 1: Meh, I just never had it on since the day it launched.

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,239
Speaker 1: I tested it once.

131
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,220
Speaker 1: I turned it off and I have never turned it on again.

132
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:43,200
Speaker 1: I guess the only of the minor Apple news is number one, the next iPad OS is cutting off the first gen iPad pro, which I had, but no longer have.

133
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,159
Speaker 1: I think it was Emily's mom has it or something.

134
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:46,799
Speaker 0: I forget where that ended up.

135
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:47,631
Speaker 1: Yeah.

136
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:49,419
Speaker 1: But I have the third gen one.

137
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:55,620
Speaker 1: So I assume I've got two years left on the third gen iPad pro, which does not have an M CPU in it.

138
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,340
Speaker 1: It's got the old a whatever.

139
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:12,720
Speaker 1: So I think I've got two years left of the iPad pro and I could still, I could see, you know, the plan I've been thinking is that, you know, when, cause right now I got the iPad and also the, you know, desktop computer, right?

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,900
Speaker 1: I could see a world still in which Apple either, you know, I get a, some Mac book or they make a Mac book that flips over or something.

141
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:22,660
Speaker 1: Right.

142
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:31,279
Speaker 1: And I use that to replace both my iPad and my desktop, but only my desktop for my everyday computing biz.

143
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,460
Speaker 1: And then I go out and get a tiny computer.

144
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,178
Speaker 1: That's basically just a GPU in a box.

145
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:36,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,898
Speaker 0: The dedicated play steam games box.

147
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,120
Speaker 1: Exactly.

148
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,578
Speaker 1: Anything, anything I need the GPU for.

149
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:42,974
Speaker 1: Right.

150
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,713
Speaker 1: I can remote desktop or steam stream or even KVM to use that box that has an Nvidia something in it.

151
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,240
Speaker 1: Right.

152
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,740
Speaker 1: And then do everything else on some sort of, you know, iPad Mac book pro something, something.

153
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:58,100
Speaker 1: Right.

154
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,099
Speaker 1: And I think that's where I'm personally headed.

155
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:00,516
Speaker 0: Yup.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,100
Speaker 0: It's tough cause I bought a surface laptop three pretty much when they came out.

157
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,460
Speaker 0: I got the top spec one and it's still totally fine.

158
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:18,480
Speaker 0: So I can't imagine buying a new laptop or tablet or anything at least for the next four or five years at this point.

159
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,140
Speaker 0: So I'm just waiting.

160
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:25,619
Speaker 1: I'm thinking, yeah, I mean, well, two years from now, I assume I'm going to get cut off from iPad iOS updates and I think so I'll have to do something.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,120
Speaker 1: Right.

162
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:26,518
Speaker 0: Yup.

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,510
Speaker 1: So, and the iPad is my primary computing device.

164
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:33,420
Speaker 1: when I'm, I guess, I guess I have that phone and desktop, right?

165
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:37,940
Speaker 0: When I'm traveling, I use my laptop just as my primary device.

166
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,420
Speaker 0: Like when I'm sitting down typing stuff, homework, anything.

167
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:47,640
Speaker 0: But the only thing I use that laptop for seriously is geek nights panels.

168
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:48,694
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,120
Speaker 1: But I'm saying like, I use my iPad a lot seriously.

170
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,479
Speaker 1: So, but I could save money basically by sort of combining it, you know, and you, you know, anyway.

171
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 1: Uh, the other thing that I think re people really glossed over, but I thought was really cool was, you know, and the Apple watch, they got these new watch, the new watch face.

172
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:11,759
Speaker 1: They showed this Snoopy one.

173
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,920
Speaker 1: Did you see that?

174
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,778
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't see that part.

175
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,220
Speaker 1: They got a new Snoopy watch face.

176
00:10:16,401 --> 00:10:20,879
Speaker 1: That is like the most dynamic like watch face I've seen.

177
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:26,518
Speaker 1: Like they were having it like, oh, if it's raining, then Snoopy and Woodstock will be all sad getting rained on.

178
00:10:26,801 --> 00:10:32,620
Speaker 1: And like, you know, he'll, he'll like be sitting there on his typewriter during your work hours.

179
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,920
Speaker 1: And like, he throws a crumpled up paper and it lands on the watch hands.

180
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:42,371
Speaker 1: And it's like, anytime you look at your watch, like there would be some like something fun, you know, happening.

181
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:43,579
Speaker 1: Right.

182
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,360
Speaker 1: And, uh, I mean, I don't think there's any other watch in history that does to that level.

183
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:49,700
Speaker 1: Right.

184
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,480
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, kids watches just have a character with two arms.

185
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,859
Speaker 0: All the faces I got today, just if I look at it, one thing happens when I look at it.

186
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:57,726
Speaker 1: Yeah.

187
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:08,800
Speaker 1: It's like, so that's, I mean, I probably won't use that watch face, but it's still, I just thought that was really fascinating sort of a new idea that hadn't been done.

188
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:15,300
Speaker 0: They did add that Apple password and passkey sharing among Apple devices.

189
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:23,240
Speaker 0: So like I could share a password for a thing with you or someone in my family, but keep it end to end encrypted so you don't know my password.

190
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,280
Speaker 1: I mean, one password does that.

191
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,720
Speaker 1: I mean, Apple did a few things that are basically competing with existing products.

192
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,160
Speaker 1: Like they have a new journaling app and stuff like that.

193
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:31,620
Speaker 1: But

194
00:11:31,641 --> 00:11:41,323
Speaker 0: the password one's interesting because while I could see myself using that in a few limited circumstances, uh, mostly like I sell their separate accounts and separate logins for everything,

195
00:11:41,584 --> 00:11:42,529
Speaker 1: but the handful

196
00:11:42,549 --> 00:11:50,399
Speaker 0: of things that are shared for some reason, either because the service doesn't support it, you know, there's some reasons, uh, we don't access any of that stuff on Apple devices.

197
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,480
Speaker 1: So that's why I use one password.

198
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:05,499
Speaker 1: Uh, but yeah, the, um, I think that what's good, you know, people, some people like they jumped to conclusions, like panicking, like, Oh no, all the journaling apps are going to die because everyone will use the Apple journal app.

199
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,178
Speaker 1: Oh no.

200
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,440
Speaker 1: One password is under threat because Apple, everyone would just use Apple pass keys and key chain and this instead.

201
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,550
Speaker 1: Right.

202
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,360
Speaker 1: It's like, but if you look in the app store notes was on the first iPhone.

203
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:18,439
Speaker 1: It's that that's how old the notes app is.

204
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:22,140
Speaker 1: Look how many note taking apps are in the app store and how well they do.

205
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,878
Speaker 1: Because no matter what Apple does, people are not completely satisfied with the Apple official app.

206
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:35,199
Speaker 1: They is, you know, so my PowerPoint is still alive and hasn't been defeated by, uh, whatever it's called.

207
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,900
Speaker 0: The keynote keynote.

208
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,417
Speaker 1: Yeah.

209
00:12:38,721 --> 00:12:41,100
Speaker 1: Even though I would use keynote if I, if I had a Mac, right.

210
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:48,260
Speaker 0: You know, I wouldn't because honestly, Google is perfect for what we do and it's easy and keynotes real fancy though.

211
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,740
Speaker 1: Like you could, it's, you can make something more if you use keynote and go in on it, you can make something that's more impressive, right?

212
00:12:56,341 --> 00:13:01,020
Speaker 1: Then you can with any of PowerPoint or Google, uh, slides.

213
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:01,598
Speaker 1: True.

214
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 1: That's, that's the value of it really.

215
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,579
Speaker 1: I mean, they make the app.

216
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Speaker 1: Well, they don't, I guess they don't do them that way anymore.

217
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,360
Speaker 1: Now they do videos, but when they did them in the theater, they used keynote for those, right?

218
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,619
Speaker 1: It's like they were dog food and that.

219
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,800
Speaker 1: So it's like, anyway, all right, let's talk about the Apple vision thing.

220
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,900
Speaker 1: So for many years, there were rumors and rumors and rumors.

221
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,200
Speaker 1: Apple was going to do some kind of goggles kind of AR something, something, right?

222
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,440
Speaker 1: No details, really.

223
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:29,320
Speaker 1: Just lots of rumors.

224
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,080
Speaker 1: They were going to do it right.

225
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,158
Speaker 1: Rumor, rumor, rumor.

226
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,339
Speaker 1: Then recently everyone's like, this is it.

227
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,479
Speaker 1: This is where they're actually gonna, it's coming out.

228
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:50,679
Speaker 1: And there were all sorts of whispers of like, you know, drama behind the scenes of like, people thought it wasn't going to go, but they pushed, you know, Tim Apple pushed it through and other people were like, I don't know about this, but turns out it was true.

229
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:51,280
Speaker 0: Yup.

230
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:03,939
Speaker 0: But the, I guess the most important thing is that there was a disconnect in my mind up until this was announced between my knowledge of what VR and AR is capable of at retail price points.

231
00:14:04,642 --> 00:14:09,240
Speaker 0: And like what the state of the art is for consumer versus prosumer versus professional.

232
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:18,020
Speaker 0: And based on what people were claiming the Apple one could do, I could not see that fitting into those price points.

233
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,191
Speaker 1: I didn't see any claims.

234
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,440
Speaker 1: At least I didn't read any of the claims.

235
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,159
Speaker 0: Oh, speculation is all I saw.

236
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,560
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't read literally anything.

237
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,260
Speaker 1: If there was people speculating or claims or rumors of what it actually did, I never read any of those.

238
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,900
Speaker 1: All I read in before today was Apple is going to make some kind of eyeball apple on your face.

239
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,660
Speaker 0: But I knew all I knew focused on AR and overlays, and that's not easy or cheap to do.

240
00:14:44,102 --> 00:14:46,960
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of reasons why there hasn't been much like that before.

241
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:51,160
Speaker 0: And the answer was that it costs thirty five hundred dollars.

242
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,059
Speaker 0: That's how it has that level of technology.

243
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,520
Speaker 1: You're jumping right to the thirty five hundred dollars, the exact opposite of what they do in the keynote, which is save the thirty five hundred dollars.

244
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:05,679
Speaker 0: Let's bring that up front, because I want you to be disincentivized and know that you're not going to buy it before you hear about how cool it might be.

245
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,179
Speaker 1: So forget forget what it does.

246
00:15:09,941 --> 00:15:12,800
Speaker 1: For anything to cost thirty five hundred dollars.

247
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,599
Speaker 0: That's a game.

248
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,519
Speaker 0: That is a top tier gaming workstation all in.

249
00:15:17,153 --> 00:15:17,320
Speaker 1: Right.

250
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,580
Speaker 1: The things that I have that cost that much money.

251
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:21,480
Speaker 1: Right.

252
00:15:21,941 --> 00:15:25,560
Speaker 1: Even the cameras like fancy cameras I have are not that much money.

253
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,259
Speaker 1: They're like half that at most.

254
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:27,592
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,699
Speaker 1: Not even half that.

256
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:29,060
Speaker 1: Right.

257
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:32,140
Speaker 1: So it's like my computer isn't even that much money.

258
00:15:32,381 --> 00:15:37,880
Speaker 1: And maybe if you include all the monitors and all the other ancillary equipment, you know, it's like, no, I don't.

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,519
Speaker 1: What do I have that is on its own?

260
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,660
Speaker 1: My workstation thirty five hundred dollars.

261
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,200
Speaker 0: My workstation without monitors when I built it was about thirty five hundred dollars.

262
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,760
Speaker 1: But I never I've never bought a computer that expensive.

263
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,799
Speaker 1: You may recall it's like two K at most.

264
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,798
Speaker 0: I built that thing during the Intel sixth generation and it is still my primary workstation because I overbuilt it.

265
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:05,500
Speaker 1: Just a few months ago when I went on Newegg and I priced out a new computer, it wasn't thirty five hundred dollars.

266
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,540
Speaker 1: Well, nine hundred dollars.

267
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,040
Speaker 1: Newest Intel CPUs and Nvidia 40X something.

268
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,949
Speaker 0: Well, part of it was because nine hundred dollars of that was a relatively early, super fast M.2 PCIE anyway.

269
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,560
Speaker 0: That was a terrible.

270
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:21,160
Speaker 1: I don't think I own anything that's thirty five hundred dollars.

271
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:21,369
Speaker 1: Right.

272
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,439
Speaker 1: So therefore, maybe a piece of furniture like was the couch that I don't even think the couch was.

273
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,379
Speaker 0: I think our digital piano, the full like the couch.

274
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:30,418
Speaker 1: Might have been too fast.

275
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,119
Speaker 0: That digital piano cost around three thousand in the 90s when we got it.

276
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,299
Speaker 1: I still have a couch cost.

277
00:16:37,992 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 1: Right.

278
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:44,119
Speaker 1: But let's say let's pretend that I did have a thirty five hundred dollar couch, even though I don't think it is.

279
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:46,358
Speaker 1: Is it this one?

280
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:55,080
Speaker 0: No, well, couches, a good couch has a lot of value in your day to day life and will last you basically forever.

281
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,100
Speaker 0: This is the first iteration, first gen of something from Apple.

282
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:10,299
Speaker 0: Think about the first gens of things and how much they advanced in later generations in the history of Apple.

283
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,420
Speaker 1: No, the couch was seventeen hundred, so not even half.

284
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,739
Speaker 1: So in order for me to buy anything, no matter what it does.

285
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,098
Speaker 1: It could be fucking unless it makes money like it's the hand of Midas that I would buy the right for.

286
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:46,640
Speaker 1: It has to be something that I use more than my couch, use more than my mattress, use more than my desktop, use more than the chair I'm sitting in right now that I cost me one thousand dollars and I bought it over a decade ago, more than my bicycle, which was less than three thousand dollars.

287
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,960
Speaker 1: I think, you know, it was less than thirty five hundred because it was on sale.

288
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:51,340
Speaker 1: I think the retail was thirty five.

289
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:51,617
Speaker 1: Right.

290
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,139
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, well, I don't have to use this thing.

291
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,380
Speaker 1: Constantly for it to be worth that much money.

292
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:04,319
Speaker 1: And no matter what it does, I am not going to be wearing something like that on my face like eight hours a day every day.

293
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,200
Speaker 0: A valve index all in assuming you have a workstation to plug it into is only a thousand dollars, including like the beacons and everything.

294
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,106
Speaker 1: So it's like there is my life.

295
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:20,080
Speaker 0: fully featured valve indexes or a valve index headset is like only five hundred bucks.

296
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:26,978
Speaker 1: So there is nothing in my life that I have currently valued at being worth paying that much money for.

297
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:34,356
Speaker 1: So there is no way I'm going to buy this, no matter how, even if it matches everything it's purported to do.

298
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:37,640
Speaker 1: It's not and I'm not rich, so it's not happening.

299
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:38,019
Speaker 1: Right.

300
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:39,999
Speaker 1: OK, so let's talk about what the hell it does.

301
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:46,559
Speaker 1: I went before I knew anything about what it did, only that there were rumored AR goggles of some kind.

302
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,118
Speaker 0: And people seem to be really confusing if it was AR or VR.

303
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,320
Speaker 0: And it looks like it's trying to do a little bit of both.

304
00:18:52,580 --> 00:19:00,335
Speaker 1: I think I think it's pretty much AR, but people are just saying VR because people don't care.

305
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,360
Speaker 0: Well, it is doing both in that it has two primary modes that are dynamic.

306
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:09,379
Speaker 0: If you're in an immersive app, then it fully immerses you in it like VR.

307
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can block out the world with it because you're it's not.

308
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,720
Speaker 1: you're not seeing out into the world at all.

309
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:16,939
Speaker 1: It is completely blocking.

310
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,480
Speaker 1: There is no optical viewfinder, right?

311
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,723
Speaker 0: It's it.

312
00:19:21,105 --> 00:19:22,230
Speaker 1: it's you're all you're only.

313
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,900
Speaker 1: your only vision of the outside world is through cameras.

314
00:19:25,662 --> 00:19:34,380
Speaker 1: And then it's basically taking a recording of your face and has outward facing video screens so other people can see like a simulation of your eyes.

315
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:38,717
Speaker 1: They're not seeing your real eyes, but it looks like you got it.

316
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:48,280
Speaker 0: It's got a cool UX, actually, like I do like this one UX element in that it'll show your eyes to people if you can see the world through it because you're using overlays.

317
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,340
Speaker 0: But if you're in an app, it'll blank your eyes out.

318
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,779
Speaker 0: So anyone looking at you knows that you can't see them, that you're doing something else.

319
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,258
Speaker 1: But it's like going into it.

320
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:00,960
Speaker 1: I was like this if they actually come out with something like this, right?

321
00:20:01,101 --> 00:20:07,667
Speaker 1: It's just going to be something that rich people buy to show off and don't actually use that much sharper image.

322
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:19,338
Speaker 1: type nerds by Apple fanboys who are loaded might buy it and companies might buy it for demonstrations and installations and showing off and demos and things like that.

323
00:20:20,061 --> 00:20:30,396
Speaker 1: There might be some industrial applications or Apple partners that buy it so that they can then get their company highlighted on the Apple keynotes like, "Oh, check out what cool company X is doing with our

324
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:30,680
Speaker 1: product.".

325
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:31,659
Speaker 1: They always do that.

326
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,360
Speaker 1: But I don't think anyone else is going to be a customer of it.

327
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,460
Speaker 1: And I still think that that's the case.

328
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:43,578
Speaker 0: Well, I think where they've set the price point, they'll be the people who performatively have it to show it off.

329
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:59,099
Speaker 0: But I think they're really... My guess at their actual strategy is the only people they actually really want to buy this are either influencers who will just make it look cool to set the stage for people being excited about future versions of it.

330
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,560
Speaker 1: They want developers to buy it for sure because it's WWDC, right?

331
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,868
Speaker 1: Where they decided to show it off?

332
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 1: because they want people to make software for it, to come up with ideas for it that Apple didn't have.

333
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:18,800
Speaker 0: Their actual target demographic for who would buy this headset is almost entirely industrial and operational companies.

334
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,556
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing...

335
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,300
Speaker 1: There are already competitors in that space with products like the Microsoft Holo lens or whatever.

336
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,400
Speaker 0: And the only thing I can see different based on what we know about it so far, because I haven't released every detail about it.

337
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,159
Speaker 0: We're going based on what WWDC said.

338
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:44,659
Speaker 0: It seems like it is a material advancement in capabilities from all the existing AR headsets that are available to purchase.

339
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,100
Speaker 1: Based on what they said.

340
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,139
Speaker 1: Who knows what the reality is?

341
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:56,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my plan is I want to, when I can, without waiting in a line, I want to try it out at an Apple store.

342
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone is.

343
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,959
Speaker 0: Because this is the kind of thing that I am very interested in.

344
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,679
Speaker 0: AR is such a killer app.

345
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:11,813
Speaker 0: But that said, I ain't dropping thirty five hundred bucks on something as excited as I am.

346
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,038
Speaker 1: I can afford to and I'm not going to.

347
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:16,258
Speaker 1: There's not a zero percent chance.

348
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,120
Speaker 1: If I'm going to drop thirty five hundred, I'll just buy MacBooks, right?

349
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,659
Speaker 1: It's like just get MacBooks.

350
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:20,981
Speaker 1: Because

351
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:35,656
Speaker 0: I've had the experience in VR, like regular old like consumer VR in an index of just using the desktop apps where I'm sitting at my desk, I put on the headset and I have several monitors and things all around me in free space that I can spin around and look at.

352
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:39,200
Speaker 0: And I've found that useful in some situations and interesting.

353
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:42,026
Speaker 0: But that is not.

354
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:50,220
Speaker 0: that was not materially better with that level of technology, especially that level of comfort than just having a smaller number of physical monitors in my real space.

355
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:50,820
Speaker 1: Right.

356
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,339
Speaker 1: So here's the thing, though, despite the insane price and despite going into it, thinking that's just some ridiculous product I'll never need.

357
00:22:58,421 --> 00:22:59,613
Speaker 1: They did sell me right.

358
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,179
Speaker 1: They were showing the use cases for it.

359
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,119
Speaker 1: Like here's why you might want this.

360
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:08,013
Speaker 1: And I was actually sold on two use cases where I could see.

361
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:15,200
Speaker 1: those are viable use cases that show me why this product actually makes sense as a real thing that someone might need.

362
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:25,720
Speaker 1: So the first use case is, effectively speaking, this is like ten monitors and a home theater in a very small package.

363
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:36,900
Speaker 1: So if you are, say, somebody who at home does work with like several monitors, but you also travel a lot and when you travel, maybe you've got the biggest MacBook.

364
00:23:37,364 --> 00:23:37,640
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,539
Speaker 1: That's still just one screen.

366
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,959
Speaker 1: Maybe you've got the iPad next to it to do the double screen thing that you can do.

367
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:46,260
Speaker 1: It's like that's still two screens.

368
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:52,660
Speaker 1: This is smaller than that kind of and is like enormous screen, effectively speaking.

369
00:23:53,262 --> 00:24:02,920
Speaker 1: So if you're someone who does multi screen work and you travel, this lets you be very productive as you would be at home on the road.

370
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:06,359
Speaker 1: And that's that's a value proposition that makes sense.

371
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,639
Speaker 0: Similarly, we were talking about this before the show.

372
00:24:09,101 --> 00:24:13,980
Speaker 0: You live in a tiny crappy place, a tiny space, tiny little closet.

373
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,320
Speaker 1: You're like a bender live in a closet or some shit.

374
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:16,659
Speaker 1: Right.

375
00:24:17,083 --> 00:24:18,120
Speaker 1: You can't possibly fit.

376
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,598
Speaker 1: You got maybe got a tiny little TV.

377
00:24:19,881 --> 00:24:22,940
Speaker 1: If you have anything at all, you can't fit a whole computer desk in.

378
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,737
Speaker 1: You're in there.

379
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:24,499
Speaker 1: Right.

380
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:33,760
Speaker 0: But you want to have the experience of a home theater and a big this plus a lazy boy would not be the worst way to go if you're alone in a small space.

381
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,196
Speaker 0: Yeah.

382
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,860
Speaker 1: I mean, if you think like if you're talking about the price, they actually say this in the keynote and it's not I don't I can't disagree.

383
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,300
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, listen, this is thirty five hundred.

384
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:55,400
Speaker 1: But for the price of a home theater and a computer and a bunch of monitors and speakers, and et cetera, et cetera, this is actually less than the price of all those things combined.

385
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:56,358
Speaker 1: Now live in it.

386
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:14,499
Speaker 1: If you live in a tiny space and you want all those things and would use them frequently combined and you buy this and don't buy those other things at all, you're no worse off because you're basically spent the same close money and you saved a lot of space in your apartment and you can now save money on rent.

387
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,779
Speaker 1: You're living in a smaller place.

388
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:25,720
Speaker 0: On one hand, you could buy for the price of this thing seven index headsets, which are high resolution VR that can do a lot of what this does.

389
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,140
Speaker 0: You can watch a movie at pretty high resolution comfortably.

390
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:35,200
Speaker 0: It has similar specs, but I'm we're waiting to see the full specs on this thing in detail.

391
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:54,276
Speaker 0: But based on what they've said, it looks like because of the more limited scope of what this device is intending to do, mostly that it seems to be very good at overlaying a 2D plane or a curved effectively 2D plane with content on it, as opposed to doing a full 3D rendered world of like gaming VR.

392
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:05,591
Speaker 0: It would probably be orders of magnitude more quality for similar computing and battery and all and weight and waste than like a valve index,

393
00:26:06,093 --> 00:26:12,612
Speaker 1: especially the feature that lets your MacBook, if you have one, if you somehow can afford this and a MacBook

394
00:26:12,812 --> 00:26:13,213
Speaker 0: show up as a screen

395
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:16,979
Speaker 1: among your screens.

396
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,820
Speaker 1: And that's like you're really getting the productivity going on that way.

397
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:30,042
Speaker 0: But especially because this part of the price point seems to be that they can, because of what I described, have that high resolution experience in a headset that looks like it's not heavy

398
00:26:30,062 --> 00:26:34,980
Speaker 1: and it is tiny because the battery is the end of a cable and only last two hours.

399
00:26:35,902 --> 00:26:37,812
Speaker 1: So which you're going to be using this?

400
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:39,540
Speaker 1: plugged in at home or plugged in at work.

401
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,118
Speaker 1: You're not used.

402
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:40,740
Speaker 1: Right.

403
00:26:41,342 --> 00:26:41,936
Speaker 0: I mean, we'll see.

404
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:50,020
Speaker 1: But also notice that the battery you can detach the cable, which means you could buy a bunch of extra batteries for your long flight.

405
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that was a problem with Google Glass.

406
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:55,920
Speaker 0: Not that that's more like an auxiliary screen as opposed to AR.

407
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:57,411
Speaker 0: But, you know, we had Google Glass.

408
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaker 0: we wore for a couple of years.

409
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:05,260
Speaker 0: I recently went through my archive of every photo I took with it, and it was a shockingly cool flashback of what my life was like back then.

410
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:06,200
Speaker 0: But I digress.

411
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,859
Speaker 0: Its main problem was that it only had a battery in it.

412
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:19,360
Speaker 0: So there wasn't a good way to plug a battery into it and put it like in your pocket to keep it going without a really ugly USB cable.

413
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,979
Speaker 0: And because of the way it was designed, it would overheat if you did that at all these problems.

414
00:27:23,681 --> 00:27:27,820
Speaker 0: I think having the battery external on a wire is a really good idea.

415
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:29,819
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's just the best they could do.

416
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,100
Speaker 1: I think it's a problem.

417
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,840
Speaker 0: Well, it's better to it's kind of like you don't you want to wait.

418
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,159
Speaker 1: Obviously, you don't want it.

419
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaker 1: Yes, you obviously don't want it on your head, right?

420
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:41,240
Speaker 1: It's the best they could do given the circumstances.

421
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,480
Speaker 1: But it's basically just like because of the circumstances, it's just not good enough, right?

422
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,380
Speaker 0: I think that's fine.

423
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,299
Speaker 0: That I have no complaint about that little cable.

424
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:52,420
Speaker 1: Well, at the back, I think it's not so much the cable.

425
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,860
Speaker 1: I think it's more that you got this whole fucking battery that's bigger than a phone.

426
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:56,759
Speaker 0: I can see a picture of it.

427
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,800
Speaker 0: It's smaller than my phone.

428
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,680
Speaker 1: Just stick it in your back pocket.

429
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,280
Speaker 1: You're good to go.

430
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,800
Speaker 1: Oh, and the video, it looked like it was like the size of like three phones, the battery.

431
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:11,820
Speaker 0: I think there's different versions because I'm looking at some photos and the photo I've got right now, it looks like my small anchor, not the tiny lipstick one, but like the old black anchor.

432
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,520
Speaker 1: We'll have to see how big that battery is.

433
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,500
Speaker 1: I thought it was a large.

434
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:16,419
Speaker 0: I imagine they might have multiple sizes.

435
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:20,280
Speaker 1: And the battery that I saw looked bigger than like the biggest iPhone.

436
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:26,060
Speaker 0: Now, the question really is going to be, is that just a battery or is that also the wireless?

437
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,578
Speaker 0: Did they confirm that?

438
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,791
Speaker 1: Yes, the thing that you attach is just a battery because the alternative is to plug into the wall.

439
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:33,760
Speaker 1: OK, everything is in the headset.

440
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:37,900
Speaker 1: All the chips, all the radios, all the cameras, they're all in your face, in the face part.

441
00:28:40,083 --> 00:29:01,843
Speaker 1: So the other thing, the other use case they sold me on, right, was the when they showed a person on the airplane, like turning the knob to sort of turn off the air and go to just basically effectively VR, but basically block out the world and put in like a fake, you know, landscape around everything, basically the wallpaper, because I basically I saw that as like.

442
00:29:01,904 --> 00:29:03,700
Speaker 1: that's like noise canceling headphones.

443
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,199
Speaker 1: And you don't want to hear anything else.

444
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:05,840
Speaker 1: Right.

445
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,639
Speaker 1: Other than what you want to be listening to, only this is like noise canceling for your eyes.

446
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,565
Speaker 1: I don't want to see any.

447
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,840
Speaker 1: I want to want to close my eyes and see nothing.

448
00:29:14,412 --> 00:29:14,518
Speaker 1: Right.

449
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,720
Speaker 1: I don't want to go to sleep with a sleep mask, but I don't want to see anything at all.

450
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:21,159
Speaker 1: I don't want to see the people next to me.

451
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,759
Speaker 1: I don't want to see what's going on in this plane.

452
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:31,900
Speaker 1: I just but I want to see what I'm working on only noise canceling for the eyes, which we had a show on augmented reality in like twenty thirteen.

453
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,598
Speaker 1: We took it to the next level.

454
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,106
Speaker 1: Ed Block, IRL

455
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:46,505
Speaker 0: Ed Block, which I'm pretty sure we talked about in twenty thirteen on the show, because imagine if you could just replace every ad that ever appeared in your real life, walking down the street with

456
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:51,480
Speaker 1: all the billboards, all the flyers, all ads on TVs that are in a restaurant.

457
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,059
Speaker 1: There's a TV and your goggles like block the TV during the ad.

458
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:56,760
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,946
Speaker 1: And then you're you're.

460
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:06,060
Speaker 1: the noise canceling blocks the audio from the ad, even though that everyone else who isn't wearing it still sees it because they're in the restaurant.

461
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:13,377
Speaker 0: That is a killer app that we're a ways from because this is not based on everything we know about it.

462
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:16,620
Speaker 0: The walk around with AR in your daily life.

463
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:17,949
Speaker 0: This is the task.

464
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,640
Speaker 0: oriented augmented reality.

465
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:30,140
Speaker 1: Now, the one that they sold on me a little bit right was when the guy was like watching sports on TV and they had all this extra stuff around the edge of the screen.

466
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:37,520
Speaker 1: Because like when I watch a hockey, I might have like a discord open or chatting with people about it and I might have some stats websites open.

467
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,679
Speaker 0: If I could pop discord, just be floating like above the TV.

468
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:41,580
Speaker 1: Right.

469
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:57,640
Speaker 1: If I could just look at the TV the whole time and see all that stuff or better yet, go to a live sporting event and be able to keep my eyes on the action and see that stuff around without having to look at a phone, take my phone out and look away from the game.

470
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,240
Speaker 1: There's something there, but I don't think it's not as compelling as the other two things I mentioned.

471
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,320
Speaker 0: Or I would argue it's hyper compelling, but in a future state of AR hardware.

472
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:10,917
Speaker 1: Yeah.

473
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:18,739
Speaker 1: Now, the thing that I was absolutely the opposite of sold on was when like they showed the dude taking photos of like his kids with it.

474
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:19,460
Speaker 1: Right.

475
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:27,339
Speaker 1: And it's like, and I was like, notice how every person he's taking a photo of all the memories, right?

476
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,718
Speaker 1: Are photos of people who are not wearing these stupid glasses, right?

477
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:35,300
Speaker 1: Only the person who's taking the photos is wearing these.

478
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,359
Speaker 1: Like he's in the kitchen and he takes photos of his kids over there.

479
00:31:38,803 --> 00:31:40,398
Speaker 1: It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

480
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:41,020
Speaker 1: Right.

481
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:51,099
Speaker 1: If you want to be honest, you got to have the kids wearing these and the whole family wearing these and then take the photos of your family and you have a memory of everyone wearing these stupid fucking apple goggles.

482
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,160
Speaker 1: And that obviously they didn't do that because that doesn't sell.

483
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:54,460
Speaker 1: Right.

484
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,540
Speaker 1: That's a that's too obviously dystopian.

485
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:03,979
Speaker 0: Well, especially because what's funny is lesser tech like those snap glasses that kind of failed or Google Glass.

486
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:07,580
Speaker 0: If you want to just be able to take photos, that was a killer app.

487
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,615
Speaker 0: Like the photo taking of Google Glass was way more useful than most of what the rest of it did.

488
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:20,240
Speaker 1: But yeah, so I don't, you know, I don't think this is something that you're going to be wearing around the house just your whole daily life.

489
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:34,319
Speaker 1: You wear it when it's like time to sit in the home theater being productive or when there's a special circumstance like, you know, this is a time where this is going to enhance the activity I am about to participate in.

490
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,179
Speaker 1: Therefore, I will apply it.

491
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,820
Speaker 0: The phrase is task oriented, augmented reality that you're not going to be wearing this thing.

492
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,937
Speaker 1: They have not shown me any legitimate case where I think it's.

493
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:52,320
Speaker 1: I think it's actively bad to be wearing this when doing anything for which it is not very well.

494
00:32:52,421 --> 00:32:53,140
Speaker 0: Say I had one.

495
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:53,997
Speaker 0: You know where I might wear it?

496
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,520
Speaker 0: Biking to like have nice direction.

497
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,800
Speaker 1: I would not wear it while biking.

498
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,400
Speaker 1: The battery dies in two hours.

499
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,719
Speaker 1: Once that battery dies, you see black and you die.

500
00:33:03,011 --> 00:33:03,200
Speaker 1: Right.

501
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:04,236
Speaker 1: Hell no.

502
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,099
Speaker 0: I would plug that into a bigger battery.

503
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:10,660
Speaker 1: I guess if your bike ride is like 30 minutes.

504
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,605
Speaker 1: But I don't think this is.

505
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:16,739
Speaker 1: that's a terrible idea, especially since they said they were they bragged about reducing lag.

506
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:19,460
Speaker 1: The lag is still probably more than zero.

507
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,640
Speaker 0: I would wear it as the head of panels at a convention, sitting in panel ops doing my doing my thing.

508
00:33:25,281 --> 00:33:26,879
Speaker 0: Maybe I could see myself doing that.

509
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:35,279
Speaker 0: I could see myself wearing it like watching a movie with friends remotely, especially if I could see if you're talking about jobs.

510
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:36,000
Speaker 1: Right.

511
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:39,260
Speaker 1: I could see, you know, somebody who's at an information booth.

512
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:39,580
Speaker 1: Right.

513
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:46,880
Speaker 1: You could greet the customers, you could see them and talk to them and bring up information and answer their questions without looking away.

514
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,019
Speaker 0: You know, who'd be wearing this a plus at a five star hotel, the concierge.

515
00:33:51,774 --> 00:33:51,920
Speaker 1: Right.

516
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:57,300
Speaker 1: A teacher or a professor could wear this right while they're teaching a class.

517
00:33:57,811 --> 00:33:58,020
Speaker 1: Right.

518
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:08,338
Speaker 1: Because then they wouldn't have to like go in futz with their thing and change the slides or they wouldn't have to have a separate monitor to see the slides if they had any or things like that.

519
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,040
Speaker 0: Remember, the student, they can look up answers to things students are asking in real time.

520
00:34:14,101 --> 00:34:15,337
Speaker 0: They don't admit that they don't know.

521
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:16,320
Speaker 1: Right.

522
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:21,060
Speaker 1: I mean, that's there are cases like that where it becomes a value.

523
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,679
Speaker 1: But for a person, I guess I only see this first version of goodbye.

524
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,558
Speaker 1: Rich company has a use for it.

525
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:46,458
Speaker 1: Or you live in a really tiny space and somehow even those thirty five hundred dollars, it makes economic sense because it's still cheaper than a bigger space, a home theater and a computer and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

526
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:54,835
Speaker 0: And while, you know, I don't regret buying in and like using Google Glass for one thousand dollars, I'm saying I don't regret a half.

527
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,639
Speaker 1: This is Google Glass for you and all your friends.

528
00:34:58,321 --> 00:34:59,539
Speaker 0: I don't regret that.

529
00:34:59,881 --> 00:35:03,440
Speaker 0: But that price point ended up being like about how much value I got.

530
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,220
Speaker 0: Like I don't regret spending that much money.

531
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,699
Speaker 1: You used Google Glass a lot.

532
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,419
Speaker 0: I don't even know this is I'm not going to get seven valve index headsets worth of value out of this thing.

533
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:13,701
Speaker 0: I don't.

534
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:17,440
Speaker 1: when I had the Google Glass, I wore I got I woke up, took a shower, I put it on.

535
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,919
Speaker 1: I didn't take it off till the end of the day.

536
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:19,109
Speaker 0: Yeah.

537
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:19,532
Speaker 1: Right.

538
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,219
Speaker 1: This is not that level of usage.

539
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:22,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

540
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,957
Speaker 0: But, you know, what will this look till twenty twenty four?

541
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:27,720
Speaker 1: Right.

542
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,038
Speaker 1: What will this look like?

543
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,058
Speaker 1: Right.

544
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,000
Speaker 1: In twenty thirty.

545
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:32,958
Speaker 1: That's when.

546
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Speaker 1: Is there going to be Apple Vision Mini?

547
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,244
Speaker 1: Right.

548
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,998
Speaker 1: What is that going to look like?

549
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,560
Speaker 1: And I think that's when we might start considering, you know, maybe getting it if you have.

550
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,359
Speaker 0: You know, I'm going to link to the episode on augmented reality we did into the 2013 because what the hell we said then.

551
00:35:51,560 --> 00:36:01,900
Speaker 0: Pretty sure the future state of augmented reality has always been the same idea and just the hardware cannot achieve that yet, nor can software in our current world.

552
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:03,220
Speaker 0: So it's kind of moot like.

553
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:11,679
Speaker 0: But when we get there, augmented reality is existentially and foundationally shattering to how humans interact.

554
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,520
Speaker 0: But that's a ways off because the hardware is not there.

555
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:15,700
Speaker 0: A.I.

556
00:36:15,761 --> 00:36:17,459
Speaker 0: is going to mess this up way before we get to that.

557
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,260
Speaker 1: I think the most dystopian thing about this was not the eyeball thing.

558
00:36:23,787 --> 00:36:24,040
Speaker 1: Right.

559
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,120
Speaker 1: Where, like, you're not seeing the person's real eyes when you look at them.

560
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,980
Speaker 0: I want to put like non-human eyes in there.

561
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,998
Speaker 0: Like a little robot eyes.

562
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:38,820
Speaker 1: The thing is that basically they said that when you set it up for the first time, you sort of aim it at your face so it can see your eyes and record them and whatnot.

563
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,280
Speaker 1: But also when you set it up for the first time, it captures your whole face.

564
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,379
Speaker 1: Because let's say you FaceTime someone while wearing this.

565
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,500
Speaker 1: Well, there isn't like a Web camera aimed at your face.

566
00:36:50,823 --> 00:36:51,074
Speaker 0: Right.

567
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,278
Speaker 0: It's basically going to make up sort of automatic right to.

568
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,360
Speaker 1: And even if there was a Web camera aimed at your face, what would it see?

569
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,960
Speaker 1: It would see a person wearing stupid fucking goggles.

570
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:01,400
Speaker 1: Right.

571
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,280
Speaker 1: So that's just not going to work for FaceTime.

572
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,105
Speaker 1: Instead, when you set it up and it captures your eyes, it captures your face and they create basically a virtual.

573
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:15,439
Speaker 0: you sort of like a live member is an automated Vtuber of your actual face.

574
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:20,939
Speaker 0: But it's also if someone somehow steals that data, that's everything you need to make deep fakes.

575
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:21,919
Speaker 1: Sure.

576
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:32,740
Speaker 1: But it basically it basically deep fakes you so that if you FaceTime with this, people can sort of see a virtual you instead of the real you while you're talking to them with FaceTime.

577
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,300
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, you see the real them because they're using normal Web camera.

578
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,598
Speaker 1: They didn't spend thirty five hundred dollars.

579
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,380
Speaker 1: So that was like, I think, a negative thing.

580
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,020
Speaker 1: It's like if you're going to FaceTime, you do not want to use this.

581
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,100
Speaker 1: Like even if you own one, it's like FaceTime.

582
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:48,279
Speaker 1: Take that thing off and get your iPhone out.

583
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:55,400
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, they actually showed using it for completely separate corporate presentations, stuff like that completely separately.

584
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:58,100
Speaker 1: They showed they added FaceTime to Apple TV.

585
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,480
Speaker 1: That looked great, actually.

586
00:37:59,740 --> 00:37:59,996
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

587
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,039
Speaker 1: Just have to you just have to use your iPhone camera or something because the Apple TV doesn't have a camera.

588
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:05,437
Speaker 1: Right.

589
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,660
Speaker 1: But that actually looked terrific.

590
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:14,620
Speaker 1: Like it's like that kind of makes me think like, you know, you know, maybe Apple TV isn't the worst idea.

591
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,340
Speaker 1: Even, you know, HDPC is still way better.

592
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:21,879
Speaker 1: But it's like my HDPC isn't Apple, so I can't FaceTime that.

593
00:38:22,783 --> 00:38:26,540
Speaker 1: But Apple, you know, Apple TV, I can't run ROMs or Steam with it.

594
00:38:27,603 --> 00:38:35,480
Speaker 0: So one other news that we probably won't dwell on too long, because this is the tip of another long iceberg conversation I'm going to read.

595
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:37,854
Speaker 0: This is a post in the Apollo app.

596
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:39,500
Speaker 0: Reddit.

597
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,719
Speaker 0: It's very short.

598
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,679
Speaker 0: The top part had a call with Reddit to discuss pricing.

599
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,639
Speaker 0: Bad news for third party apps.

600
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:52,820
Speaker 0: They're announced pricing is close to Twitter's pricing, and Apollo would have to pay Reddit 20 million dollars a year to keep running.

601
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,680
Speaker 1: So if you don't know, Reddit is a popular website.

602
00:38:56,861 --> 00:39:03,000
Speaker 1: That's, you know, a lot of people say a lot of different things about it, but it's basically, you know, forums.

603
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,414
Speaker 1: Right.

604
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,900
Speaker 1: That are all separate, mostly.

605
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:05,519
Speaker 1: Right.

606
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:09,780
Speaker 1: So each, you know, people say, oh, Reddit's full of shitty people.

607
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,760
Speaker 1: But actually, that's like saying, you know, PHP BB is full of shitty people.

608
00:39:15,221 --> 00:39:18,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, Counter Strike is full of shitty people like, yes, that's true.

609
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,380
Speaker 0: But also that's missing the point about public spaces and people.

610
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:29,200
Speaker 1: But Reddit, I think, is currently like in terms of the, you know, the platforms online.

611
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:33,299
Speaker 1: I think it's like, you know, in my opinion, at least it's like the best one right now.

612
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:39,640
Speaker 0: If I'm trying to learn to figure something out, I will go to a Reddit way before I'll go to a fandom wiki.

613
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:43,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use it more than a lot of the other ones because I have been very choosy.

614
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:58,439
Speaker 1: I unsubscribe from all subreddits except for a very, very few that are extremely relevant to my interests, like the one for the neighborhood I live in that is very active with cool people and has lots of good info.

615
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:58,797
Speaker 1: Right.

616
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,590
Speaker 1: New York City biking like.

617
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,880
Speaker 1: that's the specificness.

618
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,300
Speaker 0: I'm in a micro group there that is just people who live in Queens who play Euchre.

619
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,360
Speaker 1: Right.

620
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,185
Speaker 1: So it's like that's.

621
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:20,400
Speaker 1: Reddit is valuable, but the user interface of Reddit, despite the fact that Reddit has like less ads and less it doesn't have no ads is less ads and less BS than a lot of the competitors.

622
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:23,608
Speaker 1: The UI basically they had an original UI.

623
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:27,920
Speaker 1: that is OK, but it's so old web and tiny text.

624
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:34,980
Speaker 1: It's not, you know, I know people like it because they're old school and used to it, but not a fan of that because it's so, you know, it's old and hard to use.

625
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:39,320
Speaker 1: And they got a new one, which is a little bit better, but also worse in a lot of ways.

626
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,600
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:42,600
Speaker 1: Because it's slow and janky and but it's it just looks nicer.

628
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:43,219
Speaker 1: Right.

629
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:45,059
Speaker 1: But it's more modern, I guess.

630
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,300
Speaker 1: So people love third party apps.

631
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:56,700
Speaker 1: Use the Reddit API, get a better UI because the official UI is a garbage and third party apps just broadly like forget Reddit are very much.

632
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,342
Speaker 0: They're not.

633
00:40:57,382 --> 00:41:02,258
Speaker 0: they don't follow the World Wide Web ethos like there's a lot like this breaks down pretty quick.

634
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:14,699
Speaker 0: But the World Wide Web, one of its key components was that information is made available and you can render it however you want in the client and you shouldn't care how anyone renders your content.

635
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:16,145
Speaker 0: And there are.

636
00:41:16,305 --> 00:41:19,220
Speaker 1: there are standards that browsers are supposed to follow.

637
00:41:19,541 --> 00:41:27,340
Speaker 0: But if someone wants to change that, it's like if I want to always see thing in Comic Sans, like, sure, if I want to block ads from your website, sure.

638
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:36,140
Speaker 0: But third party apps serve the same purpose because somebody is going to want to use Reddit differently and it should be in that same ethos.

639
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:44,800
Speaker 0: Anyone should be able to interact with that public service where someone has an account and render the data they get out of it this any way they want.

640
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:54,320
Speaker 1: But when this topic comes up, accessibility also always comes up because a lot of websites are not and other Web services are not super accessible in their default forms.

641
00:41:54,821 --> 00:42:05,660
Speaker 1: And a lot of third party apps either exist because they are better than the default in terms of accessibility or that's like a side effect, like they happen to be better UI.

642
00:42:05,801 --> 00:42:06,959
Speaker 1: That's why they have customers.

643
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:10,660
Speaker 1: Therefore, they're also better UX and more accessible.

644
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:19,032
Speaker 1: And so now they become necessary for people who have accessibility issues in order to access the service in a good way.

645
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:31,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this leads to because if an objective way to make any user experience both more accessible and a better user experience is to not have ads in it.

646
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:32,613
Speaker 1: Yeah.

647
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:35,800
Speaker 1: So basically, Apollo is the best and I use it.

648
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,572
Speaker 1: I paid for it.

649
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,820
Speaker 1: Third party app for Reddit for your phone or your tablet or whatever you got.

650
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,183
Speaker 1: And it's.

651
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:49,199
Speaker 1: it's not perfect, but it's a lot better than any of the official Reddit app or Reddit website.

652
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,119
Speaker 1: And I like it a lot so much that I paid for it.

653
00:42:53,623 --> 00:42:55,760
Speaker 1: But Reddit is decided, well, we're losing money.

654
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:56,337
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,359
Speaker 1: That guy is making money selling his app.

656
00:42:58,882 --> 00:43:03,280
Speaker 1: We're losing money because everyone who uses that app to go to our service is using our bandwidth.

657
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,080
Speaker 1: Right.

658
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,620
Speaker 1: Getting our content costing us money, but they're not seeing our ads.

659
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:12,998
Speaker 1: So we're going to charge them money to hit our API and they're going to charge so much to that.

660
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,719
Speaker 1: Basically, their financial model no longer makes sense because nobody's going to pay that much to use Apollo.

661
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,213
Speaker 0: CNBC is reporting on this and they have.

662
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:22,260
Speaker 0: they have the money line.

663
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:34,300
Speaker 0: One sentence at the end of the article with the digital ad market facing a slowdown and Reddit now 18 months removed from the notification of its confidential IPO filing, the company may be facing pressure to bolster its revenue.

664
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:39,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Reddit, if you don't know, was originally like a standalone company.

665
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,800
Speaker 1: The guy who founded it, I met one time.

666
00:43:41,981 --> 00:43:44,080
Speaker 1: He was a Silicon Valley dude.

667
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:50,560
Speaker 1: He was a weird dude, but somehow he ended up marrying Serena Williams and making babies.

668
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,296
Speaker 1: That was I thought that was the worst.

669
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, they seem to be happily married.

670
00:43:56,402 --> 00:43:57,397
Speaker 1: So great, great for them.

671
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,340
Speaker 1: But so that dude isn't there anymore.

672
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,080
Speaker 1: Reddit got bought by Conde Nast, the magazine company.

673
00:44:05,861 --> 00:44:12,237
Speaker 1: But then basically there's this other holding company that like owns Conde Nast and several other things.

674
00:44:12,962 --> 00:44:16,059
Speaker 1: Reddit got broken off of Conde Nast and moved up.

675
00:44:16,361 --> 00:44:20,840
Speaker 1: So now it's at basically the same level as Conde Nast owned by the same holding company.

676
00:44:21,741 --> 00:44:23,107
Speaker 1: And so it's.

677
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,440
Speaker 1: I don't know how you can IPO when you're a wholly owned subsidiary.

678
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:29,460
Speaker 1: Does that mean you're no longer owned by the subsidiary?

679
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,620
Speaker 1: They're effectively selling the company to the public.

680
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:32,619
Speaker 1: Is that how that works?

681
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,419
Speaker 0: I'm not familiar with the details of how this one went down.

682
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:37,297
Speaker 1: I don't know.

683
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,798
Speaker 1: But there's been rumors that they're going to IPO, but they haven't.

684
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,539
Speaker 1: So who knows yet, at least.

685
00:44:45,081 --> 00:44:54,400
Speaker 1: But yeah, Reddit is, you know, doing very well in one sense and that it's sort of picking up a lot of steam from all these other Internet platforms doing poorly.

686
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:03,560
Speaker 1: I mean, that's how I came to it in the first place was when, like, Dig and a lot of other things failed, you know, and I sort of had to, you know, I gave up and went to Reddit instead.

687
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,980
Speaker 0: Well, the fundamental problem that we talk about a lot and always comes back to capitalism.

688
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:09,698
Speaker 0: None of these things make money.

689
00:45:10,413 --> 00:45:10,518
Speaker 1: No.

690
00:45:11,262 --> 00:45:23,382
Speaker 0: And actually, the CNBC reporting on Reddit specifically points out that Reddit makes the bulk of its money from advertising and it has never been able to significantly monetize its users.

691
00:45:23,623 --> 00:45:29,900
Speaker 0: compared to even Facebook and Pinterest, which have done like they've captured a lot more money per user.

692
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:38,079
Speaker 0: Reddit cannot capture money from users, partly because I think a lot of people who use Reddit heavily are the kinds of people who are aggressively block ads.

693
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:44,420
Speaker 1: Well, I think also the people who are using Reddit are the people who are there for a like specific thing.

694
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,679
Speaker 1: They're not doom scrolling.

695
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:46,288
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,520
Speaker 1: Like, you know, you can't just throw some other shit at them.

697
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,439
Speaker 1: That's not what they're looking like.

698
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,572
Speaker 0: I go to the Astoria even if it's not as I read every recent post, maybe like and that's it.

699
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,179
Speaker 0: Then I'm done for the day.

700
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:57,780
Speaker 1: Exactly.

701
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,418
Speaker 1: Maybe the people go to Reddit and, you know, they search for a specific thing, find it, and that they're done.

702
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:14,047
Speaker 0: Notice how if you Google for stuff, a lot of times the Google auto suggestion will just add a Reddit to the end of a question because people are trying to find a Reddit that answers it compared to you

703
00:46:14,067 --> 00:46:17,726
Speaker 1: don't know how to go to site colon Reddit dot com or they don't know how to go to Reddit first and then

704
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,620
Speaker 0: also some of the other searches in Google.

705
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:27,457
Speaker 0: Total aside that I discovered this on YouTube, Google and YouTube have quietly removed some of the operators that used to work.

706
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:28,980
Speaker 1: Interesting.

707
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,780
Speaker 0: Like Minus has stopped working in YouTube searches.

708
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:33,240
Speaker 1: Really?

709
00:46:33,482 --> 00:46:34,160
Speaker 0: But not in Google search.

710
00:46:34,465 --> 00:46:35,279
Speaker 1: I'll have to test that.

711
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:37,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never had that problem.

712
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,999
Speaker 0: I thought, well, I haven't used Minus on YouTube in a while.

713
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I don't.

714
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,920
Speaker 1: Minus is not something I use on YouTube generally.

715
00:46:45,642 --> 00:46:48,040
Speaker 1: But yeah, Reddit is in trouble.

716
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:57,360
Speaker 1: And if they actually go through with this and ruin the third party apps, they might be in more trouble because the one thing that's actually keeping Reddit afloat is that they don't pay moderators anything.

717
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:06,300
Speaker 1: Every subreddit is something that someone makes for free and people, whoever starts the subreddit, has to moderate it themselves or get moderators.

718
00:47:06,964 --> 00:47:08,999
Speaker 1: And those moderators are all working for free.

719
00:47:09,512 --> 00:47:09,760
Speaker 1: Right.

720
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:15,800
Speaker 1: Unless somehow someone has a subreddit and they somehow make money and then they can pay their moderators.

721
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:17,120
Speaker 1: But Reddit isn't paying anybody.

722
00:47:18,464 --> 00:47:24,340
Speaker 1: So even though they probably should, because moderators work harder than YouTube creators and YouTube pays YouTube creators somehow.

723
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:33,278
Speaker 0: So regardless, all those moderators, YouTube creators, somehow 99 percent of them make dozens of dollars a year.

724
00:47:34,082 --> 00:47:35,460
Speaker 1: But Reddit moderators make zero dollars.

725
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:40,320
Speaker 1: But the Reddit moderators are like, they're the most ready.

726
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:41,020
Speaker 1: Right.

727
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,079
Speaker 1: They're like, you already don't pay us.

728
00:47:43,622 --> 00:47:46,580
Speaker 1: And now you're going to try to ruin Apollo and make Reddit even worse.

729
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,135
Speaker 1: Screw you.

730
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:47,780
Speaker 1: Right.

731
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:49,179
Speaker 1: You won't exist without us.

732
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:53,320
Speaker 1: And they are a bunch of major, major subreddits are going to just go dark.

733
00:47:53,992 --> 00:47:54,200
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,579
Speaker 1: They're like, these subreddits are still ours.

735
00:47:56,992 --> 00:47:57,180
Speaker 1: Right.

736
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,899
Speaker 1: We we moderate them so we can turn them off.

737
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,277
Speaker 1: Yep.

738
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:00,637
Speaker 0: Right.

739
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:05,179
Speaker 0: The tricky part is nobody has a place to go except rolling their own.

740
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:06,476
Speaker 1: Sure.

741
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,044
Speaker 1: But the point is, is that they can still put a lot of pressure on Reddit by making Reddit's website like.

742
00:48:12,326 --> 00:48:14,380
Speaker 1: Reddit doesn't have enough control of its own website.

743
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,760
Speaker 1: Like it could be made useless by its users.

744
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:17,800
Speaker 0: Well, right.

745
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:18,940
Speaker 1: Turning off like Twitter.

746
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:24,680
Speaker 0: Twitter is getting like like getting worse and worse because people who make content are just leaving it slowly and steadily.

747
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,822
Speaker 1: So I guess there's a blackout on Reddit and we'll see if that pressures them to change the.

748
00:48:30,863 --> 00:48:31,899
Speaker 0: here is my worry.

749
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:37,700
Speaker 0: If that pressure is successful, Reddit can't make money and will eventually go away anyway.

750
00:48:38,222 --> 00:48:46,800
Speaker 0: If that pressure is not successful, Reddit will get worse and still won't make money and will still go away eventually because we're still skipping the fundamental point.

751
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:49,079
Speaker 0: None of these fucking websites make money.

752
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,188
Speaker 1: I think Reddit could be.

753
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:55,840
Speaker 1: I mean, well, it cannot be capitalist successful, right?

754
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,460
Speaker 0: If it's trying to IPO or I think Reddit could run at a break even.

755
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:01,740
Speaker 0: I think Twitter could have run at a break even.

756
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,074
Speaker 1: I think Reddit could be run profitably.

757
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:06,407
Speaker 1: Yes.

758
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,579
Speaker 1: Not not vastly, but profit.

759
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:15,120
Speaker 0: When I say break even, I mean it can pay for its expenses and maybe it generates a little extra.

760
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,800
Speaker 1: If Wikipedia and archive.org can carry on, Reddit can carry on if its only goal is to carry on.

761
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,999
Speaker 0: Name a third one that carries on.

762
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,280
Speaker 0: Like that's the problem.

763
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:29,960
Speaker 0: Wikipedia, not many, not big ones.

764
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:35,300
Speaker 0: Wikipedia, partly because it's the only game in town for that.

765
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:39,040
Speaker 0: And also because it has a lot of institutional donation like.

766
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:45,640
Speaker 0: But Wikipedia somehow convinced all of society, except extreme right wing, not jobs, that it is a net good for the world.

767
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:52,399
Speaker 0: A lot of people earnestly believe in the mission of Wikipedia, probably orders of magnitude more than even know what Reddit is.

768
00:49:53,241 --> 00:49:57,140
Speaker 1: I think the people who are the Reddit people, the people who use Apollo, right?

769
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:05,918
Speaker 1: If Reddit were somehow the ownership of Reddit was moved to either a non-profit or at least some group public benefit company, something like that.

770
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:10,100
Speaker 1: Anything that didn't care about making a lot of money, they just cared about maintaining Reddit.

771
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:14,000
Speaker 1: First of all, the first party apps and the website would stop sucking.

772
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:14,272
Speaker 1: Yep.

773
00:50:14,583 --> 00:50:14,820
Speaker 1: Right.

774
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:16,719
Speaker 1: And so you wouldn't need the third party apps.

775
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:25,300
Speaker 1: And second of all, they would be able, if they managed to do that, then they would be able to garner the massive donations like Wikipedia does.

776
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,355
Speaker 1: I think you're right float.

777
00:50:27,181 --> 00:50:36,280
Speaker 0: So that's they can even make the case of, look, if we can get enough donations to keep this human resource alive, then we will stop selling ads forever.

778
00:50:37,153 --> 00:50:37,300
Speaker 1: Yep.

779
00:50:37,481 --> 00:50:42,340
Speaker 1: I think, you know, we just need the ownership of Reddit to change hands to the right party.

780
00:50:43,801 --> 00:50:49,260
Speaker 1: But the problem, just like with sort of like how Flickr Flickr went to the, you know, Flickr is not doing well numbers wise.

781
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:49,408
Speaker 1: Right.

782
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,219
Speaker 1: But it was, you know, it's now owned by SmugMug, I think.

783
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,797
Speaker 1: And it is being well.

784
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,960
Speaker 0: Flickr now sells a product that its users pay for and I still pay for it.

785
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:00,100
Speaker 0: And it's a fine product.

786
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:04,920
Speaker 1: It's like people have forgotten Flickr, but Flickr is well taken care of.

787
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:05,240
Speaker 1: Right.

788
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:06,040
Speaker 1: It's there.

789
00:51:06,182 --> 00:51:07,100
Speaker 1: It's not going anywhere.

790
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:12,240
Speaker 1: So I think Reddit, if in the right hands, it could be well taken care of.

791
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:12,980
Speaker 0: Oh, absolutely.

792
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,580
Speaker 1: It's not its current hands.

793
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:25,858
Speaker 0: Reddit and Twitter and things like it, no social media network, no popular website could ever pay back the people who threw their money at it in the first place, expecting it to give them money back.

794
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:29,880
Speaker 1: Unless the amount of money they gave in the first place is very small.

795
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:35,260
Speaker 0: Which I don't think that's the case, considering things have never made fucking money at any point.

796
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,880
Speaker 1: What did Condé pay to buy Reddit?

797
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:42,340
Speaker 0: But anyway, we've gone on almost an hour.

798
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,720
Speaker 0: This is what happens when we don't do shows for a while.

799
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:45,799
Speaker 1: Get giant news.

800
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,078
Speaker 0: We also get pent up.

801
00:51:47,745 --> 00:51:49,299
Speaker 0: You know, we have hung out a lot.

802
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,079
Speaker 0: Covid is still winding down.

803
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:53,339
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

804
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,916
Speaker 0: So this real short video, 54 seconds.

805
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,424
Speaker 0: This is a you know, there's.

806
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:07,859
Speaker 0: you're probably familiar with water, toilet and whole toilet, like the two primary kinds of toilets, either just a hole or a hole with some water in it.

807
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,058
Speaker 0: But did you know there's a third chemical toilet that's out there?

808
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:13,138
Speaker 0: There's the toilet with acid in it.

809
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:16,280
Speaker 0: There is another kind of toilet many of you might not be familiar with.

810
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,680
Speaker 0: This is the fire toilet.

811
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,020
Speaker 0: You poop in this toilet and it incinerates your poop into a fine white ash.

812
00:52:25,121 --> 00:52:27,880
Speaker 0: No smell, no sound, just ash.

813
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,639
Speaker 0: And you dump the ash out every month or two.

814
00:52:30,001 --> 00:52:32,799
Speaker 0: And this video in 54 seconds shows you how this thing works.

815
00:52:33,023 --> 00:52:33,899
Speaker 0: And it is pretty cool.

816
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,780
Speaker 0: My solution is don't live in a place where you need to use the fire toilet.

817
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:39,920
Speaker 1: That's correct.

818
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,259
Speaker 1: And we don't need to have the fire.

819
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,260
Speaker 0: I mean, this is from Svalbard, Svalbard.

820
00:52:44,401 --> 00:52:46,560
Speaker 0: So this is basically like North Hebra.

821
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,079
Speaker 0: If you're playing Tears of the Kingdom right now, don't live there.

822
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:52,279
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, live on like the edge of North Hebra hanging off that cliff.

823
00:52:53,621 --> 00:53:12,540
Speaker 1: So when people talk about writing programs in assembly language, usually they're talking about writing programs for like an embedded device, a microcontroller, an old computer, you know, like an NES game or just, you know, if it's if it's for a modern computer, they're talking about writing something that like prints some text or does something really small.

824
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:13,180
Speaker 1: Right.

825
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:22,040
Speaker 1: The idea of trying to write like a, you know, imagine trying to write like a modern application, like fucking Discord or YouTube or something in assembly.

826
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:23,119
Speaker 1: It's like that's not happening.

827
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:23,780
Speaker 1: Right.

828
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:25,412
Speaker 1: But here this is.

829
00:53:25,432 --> 00:53:26,380
Speaker 1: I've never seen this before.

830
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,179
Speaker 1: Someone is this thing of the day.

831
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:35,940
Speaker 1: Someone has a whole tutorial right with all the code of how to write a GUI app in assembly.

832
00:53:36,003 --> 00:53:36,378
Speaker 1: Right.

833
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:38,660
Speaker 1: They're not writing the whole operating system from nothing.

834
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:39,940
Speaker 1: This doesn't run on bare metal.

835
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:48,680
Speaker 1: It's you already have a Linux computer with X 11 and you're going to write a program that actually opens a window and puts text in the window.

836
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:51,280
Speaker 1: But you're going to write that program in assembly.

837
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:52,969
Speaker 1: And that's pretty impressive.

838
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:54,539
Speaker 1: that they were able to do that, I think.

839
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:58,080
Speaker 1: And I think there's a lot to learn if you go through this exercise.

840
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,419
Speaker 1: So that's pretty cool.

841
00:53:59,820 --> 00:53:59,908
Speaker 0: Yeah.

842
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,280
Speaker 0: In the moment, the gig nights book club book was the satanic versus.

843
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:05,480
Speaker 0: We're done to the episode.

844
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:05,897
Speaker 0: Great book.

845
00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:06,537
Speaker 0: You should read it.

846
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:14,139
Speaker 0: The new one is the book recommended by everyone's favorite person, Biggles Dickles Wolfwood that made the rounds.

847
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,459
Speaker 0: This is how you lose the time war.

848
00:54:16,642 --> 00:54:17,438
Speaker 0: That's the title, I think.

849
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,320
Speaker 1: That's correct.

850
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:20,219
Speaker 1: The book is very short.

851
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:25,720
Speaker 1: It's like 200 pages and it has two authors, which is might break our website a bit.

852
00:54:28,562 --> 00:54:31,620
Speaker 1: The two authors, I hope I can pronounce their names correctly.

853
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,770
Speaker 1: I think one of them is Max Gladstone.

854
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:36,298
Speaker 1: Easy name.

855
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,940
Speaker 1: The other person is Amal El Motar, I guess.

856
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:41,578
Speaker 1: Sorry.

857
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:43,900
Speaker 1: I should look up how to say your name.

858
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,120
Speaker 1: I will for the next episode.

859
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,780
Speaker 1: You'll probably never hear this anyway.

860
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,260
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

861
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,699
Speaker 0: It's a short book, but just in fairness and because it's a book club to give you time to read it.

862
00:54:53,803 --> 00:54:56,680
Speaker 0: We'll go a month instead of just doing it the next Thursday episode.

863
00:54:56,901 --> 00:55:04,880
Speaker 0: So that would mean on Thursday the 29th, unless something comes up, we'll do the book club episode on this book because it's like 200 pages from what I can tell.

864
00:55:06,207 --> 00:55:08,540
Speaker 1: And just so you know something about it.

865
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,819
Speaker 1: Hugo Award winner, best novella.

866
00:55:11,701 --> 00:55:14,079
Speaker 1: Nebula and Locus Award winner, best novella.

867
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,040
Speaker 1: One of NPR's best books of 2019.

868
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,400
Speaker 1: And the summary is basically there are two secret agents, right?

869
00:55:23,242 --> 00:55:26,060
Speaker 1: One of them is from the cyber world, right?

870
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:28,780
Speaker 1: Where there's like a singularity cyber brain, right?

871
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,886
Speaker 1: And the other one is from also sort of a world that's a singularity, but it's obviously.

872
00:55:34,986 --> 00:55:41,620
Speaker 1: it's the garden, the tree world, you know, that the elf singularity with trees and plants and flowers, right?

873
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:52,720
Speaker 1: And they're against each other and they're both time-traveling rapidly and basically writing letters to one of them starts writing a letter to the other one.

874
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:54,960
Speaker 1: And then they don't stop writing letters back and forth.

875
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:56,839
Speaker 1: So I guess there's a, there's a word for it.

876
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,200
Speaker 1: What's it?

877
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,860
Speaker 1: Episto something, um, a story that's told through letters that are written.

878
00:56:03,102 --> 00:56:04,319
Speaker 0: Story told through epistles.

879
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:05,527
Speaker 1: Yeah.

880
00:56:06,784 --> 00:56:08,900
Speaker 1: How you lose the time.

881
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,212
Speaker 1: It's a word.

882
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,019
Speaker 1: That's a new word.

883
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,799
Speaker 1: I just learned because of this book, uh, an epistolary novella.

884
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,180
Speaker 1: Epistolary means a story written as a series of letters.

885
00:56:19,441 --> 00:56:22,400
Speaker 1: So, uh, that's, that's what you're getting to one.

886
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:32,400
Speaker 1: You're getting a bunch of letters written between these two time-traveling secret agents who are living in different societies that are fighting a war against each other.

887
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,697
Speaker 1: Through space and time.

888
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,273
Speaker 0: All right.

889
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:37,960
Speaker 0: So let's get into it.

890
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:42,400
Speaker 0: We kind of, because we went long, we don't have to go too long on this, but we did sort of already cover this.

891
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:45,219
Speaker 0: Like we got into this topic talking about that apple thing.

892
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:49,700
Speaker 1: So topics for a lot of Mondays these days, we look at the news.

893
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:50,014
Speaker 1: Yup.

894
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:59,000
Speaker 0: But it really kind of like, it's more a, how do we, and then how could, or maybe should you decide when to adopt a technology?

895
00:56:59,161 --> 00:57:01,148
Speaker 0: Like where are the bright lines on?

896
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:12,938
Speaker 0: like, this is a technology I must adopt immediately at any cost versus this is a technology I not only will not adopt, but I will aggressively fight against other people adopting it.

897
00:57:13,786 --> 00:57:14,756
Speaker 1: Oh, that's even further.

898
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:18,380
Speaker 1: Not just avoiding it, but preventing other people from using it.

899
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,520
Speaker 0: Well, like, you know, here's an example, uh, I'll give some examples of technology adoption.

900
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:22,617
Speaker 0: Cryptocurrency.

901
00:57:23,142 --> 00:57:27,500
Speaker 0: I have spent my professional career since the dawn of it.

902
00:57:27,621 --> 00:57:33,460
Speaker 0: I spent about two months on a committee to look at this new technology when blockchain appeared to determine if it had any value.

903
00:57:33,821 --> 00:57:40,180
Speaker 0: And I determined with this working group that it had no value of any kind, that it was basically likely worthless.

904
00:57:40,861 --> 00:57:49,019
Speaker 0: And now, uh, following that thread, I have continued to actively and aggressively try to prevent its adoption wherever I have the power to do so.

905
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:49,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

906
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,840
Speaker 1: Well, I see that's a technology that is actively harmful to the world at large.

907
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:54,885
Speaker 1: So for the world, it's.

908
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:55,850
Speaker 1: it's harmful to the world.

909
00:57:58,262 --> 00:58:02,360
Speaker 1: Then it's also harmful to me because I live in the world and everyone I love and know and care about.

910
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:04,119
Speaker 1: So therefore, yes, try to destroy it.

911
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:04,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

912
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:21,280
Speaker 0: But then another completely different example, let's say VR technology, forget even the Apple thing, regular old VR, the kind we know about from oculus and rifts and gaming and all that, where it's progressing steadily and it almost hits these series of milestones.

913
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:29,197
Speaker 0: where every time it hits a milestone, a larger group of people decide that it is above their line and they adopt it.

914
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,420
Speaker 0: Scott's line is way higher than mine.

915
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,759
Speaker 0: My line is way higher than several other people we know.

916
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:44,580
Speaker 0: We know some people who adopted VR, like when the original rift was announced, like before there was even any hardware through Scott, where you're still waiting for.

917
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,676
Speaker 0: It's so tiny, you don't know you're wearing it and it's fully immersive in all possible ways.

918
00:58:50,264 --> 00:58:51,039
Speaker 1: Maybe not even then.

919
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,239
Speaker 1: I still have to have a need for it.

920
00:58:54,103 --> 00:58:57,100
Speaker 0: Well, there's a difference we need and want as well because those lines.

921
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:57,780
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, want.

922
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:58,724
Speaker 1: But it's like.

923
00:58:58,765 --> 00:59:01,139
Speaker 1: that's the no matter whether it's technology or not.

924
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:01,700
Speaker 1: Right.

925
00:59:02,241 --> 00:59:04,719
Speaker 1: The question I always ask myself is, am I going to use it?

926
00:59:04,966 --> 00:59:05,199
Speaker 1: Right.

927
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,180
Speaker 1: You know, and we talked about the bowling balls many times already.

928
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:08,392
Speaker 1: Right.

929
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:11,700
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm going to buy anything, it's am I going to use it?

930
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,620
Speaker 1: And I don't judge things by their price.

931
00:59:15,221 --> 00:59:19,100
Speaker 1: I judge things by their price divided by their use.

932
00:59:19,201 --> 00:59:19,372
Speaker 1: Right.

933
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:30,540
Speaker 1: If I buy something for 10 bucks and I like I say by T-shirt for 10 bucks and I wear it once, like I actually feel kind of bad, even though it was just 10 bucks, because like that's 10 bucks to wear the shirt one time.

934
00:59:30,582 --> 00:59:30,669
Speaker 1: Yeah.

935
00:59:30,903 --> 00:59:31,120
Speaker 1: Right.

936
00:59:31,561 --> 00:59:41,539
Speaker 1: But if I buy a fancy T-shirt for 50 bucks, but I wear it like every week for years, it's like I don't feel bad about that at all.

937
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:41,752
Speaker 1: Yeah.

938
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:42,008
Speaker 1: Right.

939
00:59:42,301 --> 00:59:46,478
Speaker 1: So whenever I'm going to spend money on something, I don't look at the price as a raw number.

940
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,300
Speaker 1: I imagine, am I actually going to use it live?

941
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,000
Speaker 1: Am I going to get the value out of it, you know, compared to the price?

942
00:59:55,642 --> 00:59:58,920
Speaker 1: And then that's how I judge whether it's going to happen.

943
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,169
Speaker 0: And that value can be different.

944
01:00:00,189 --> 01:00:01,358
Speaker 0: things like, you know, forget VR.

945
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,260
Speaker 0: Talk about because the Nintendo Switch Breath of the Wild came out.

946
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:18,520
Speaker 0: We always used to talk about how don't buy a video game console just because of one exclusive game, because that implies that you're basically paying the price of the console plus the price of the game just to play the game.

947
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:26,920
Speaker 0: The console has to be judged for you by the collection of games you'll play on it relative to alternative ways to play that collection of games.

948
01:00:27,281 --> 01:00:30,700
Speaker 0: And there are very few exclusive games in the modern world on consoles.

949
01:00:31,301 --> 01:00:40,680
Speaker 0: But for Nintendo, like Tears of the Kingdom, I would say right now for me, the two Zelda games alone would have been worth the price of entry to buy a Nintendo Switch.

950
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:48,400
Speaker 0: It'd be close, but I would have bought a Nintendo Switch to play these two games, even if no other game existed for it.

951
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,740
Speaker 0: I think that would have happened.

952
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:54,260
Speaker 0: It would have been close on my line, but that would have been an OK line.

953
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:10,459
Speaker 0: So let's see, in terms of like cell phones, we kind of we wanted cell phones before cell phones existed like I wanted a cell phone when I was a little kid and wireless phones appeared like the wireless phones you could have in your house.

954
01:01:10,784 --> 01:01:11,700
Speaker 0: But not have a cord.

955
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:13,406
Speaker 0: We wanted one.

956
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:15,140
Speaker 0: so bad, but they were so expensive.

957
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,317
Speaker 0: Our family couldn't afford one when they first came out.

958
01:01:17,881 --> 01:01:18,778
Speaker 1: Other people had them.

959
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:19,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

960
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:25,680
Speaker 1: And we just still didn't get one because like, you know, why it wasn't it wasn't super necessary.

961
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:28,960
Speaker 0: I mean, it would have been very useful to us, you know, with big house.

962
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:32,676
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, it'd be nice, but it's like we just didn't get one for like.

963
01:01:32,696 --> 01:01:38,779
Speaker 0: a way, you know, our sole reason was money, because that's sort of one of the big factors there of the value divided by money.

964
01:01:39,181 --> 01:01:49,199
Speaker 0: But even if the value is high, let's say I would use, I don't know, a helicopter to go from here to skiing like I could just helicopter to ski.

965
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:58,400
Speaker 0: The value that would provide me personally, ignoring the externalities of the harm that causes to environment, because that's a different discussion, would be enormous.

966
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:16,320
Speaker 0: I would ski so much it would be ridiculous, but it doesn't matter how much value I get out of it, because the dollar amount it would cost to leverage that technology in my life would be so astronomical that there's no universe where I could reasonably afford that.

967
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:25,840
Speaker 0: So even even almost infinite value is destroyed if you do not have that capital to reasonably purchase and interact with said technology.

968
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:33,480
Speaker 0: Case in point, these apple glasses, they're so expensive that I can imagine if they were a thousand dollars.

969
01:02:33,621 --> 01:02:37,579
Speaker 1: Thought they were going to be more expensive, but the price is still too high.

970
01:02:39,261 --> 01:02:42,160
Speaker 0: Seven seven indexes worth of cost.

971
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:46,740
Speaker 0: You can buy seven valve indexes or one apple augmented reality.

972
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,480
Speaker 1: You could buy a MacBook and have lots of cash.

973
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,620
Speaker 0: It's like that old penny arcade.

974
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:51,039
Speaker 0: We're like, oh, I bought an iPod.

975
01:02:51,264 --> 01:02:51,899
Speaker 0: It doesn't skip.

976
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,957
Speaker 0: And Tyco is like, yeah, I have a CD player and I cushion it with four hundred dollars of cash.

977
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,886
Speaker 1: Yep, you could buy.

978
01:02:59,906 --> 01:03:05,280
Speaker 1: you could buy ten eleven Nintendo switches and have money left over.

979
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:13,999
Speaker 0: So VR is one of the few areas where Scott and I our lines are actually a little bit different because we generally kind of adopt things at about the same time.

980
01:03:14,441 --> 01:03:16,349
Speaker 0: We have similar access to resources.

981
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:26,176
Speaker 0: like we tend to have similar opinions about those technology, but I adopted VR a couple of I'd say three generations before Scott will even consider adopting VR.

982
01:03:27,302 --> 01:03:28,450
Speaker 1: I just I wouldn't use it.

983
01:03:28,954 --> 01:03:29,660
Speaker 1: when would I use it?

984
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:43,059
Speaker 0: And I think there's a. there's a. that's a component of this that a lot of people overlook because a lot of people look at a piece of technology like these glasses and they think, what would I use it for from the context of a consumer, a gamer, et cetera.

985
01:03:43,561 --> 01:04:00,720
Speaker 0: But let's say Scott and I, we're going to try to make apps like we're going to try to monetize in some fashion, then owning dev kits, owning the technology to make something even if we wouldn't use that thing all the time is suddenly a much better value proposition because it's almost like a tool of your trade.

986
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,482
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's not adopting a technology that's that's purchasing capital for your business.

987
01:04:05,863 --> 01:04:13,546
Speaker 0: But for example, I was interested enough in VR to where I bought a relatively early VR equipment like.

988
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:26,775
Speaker 0: I bought the Oculus Rift and now I have a valve index specifically not so much because I wanted to play specific games because even now in the year twenty twenty three, there are less than ten a tier VR games like.

989
01:04:26,815 --> 01:04:28,600
Speaker 0: there aren't that many series.

990
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:32,479
Speaker 1: I saw I saw a super hot VR speed run as GDQ.

991
01:04:32,862 --> 01:04:34,259
Speaker 1: It took him like no time at all.

992
01:04:34,702 --> 01:04:39,616
Speaker 1: And it was really fascinating because that's a game where you're like you stop to make the bad guys stop.

993
01:04:39,677 --> 01:04:39,800
Speaker 1: Right.

994
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:41,038
Speaker 1: And you move to make the bad guys.

995
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:41,644
Speaker 0: You're good.

996
01:04:41,685 --> 01:04:42,519
Speaker 0: You don't have to stop.

997
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:46,516
Speaker 1: But that's the point is that to do a speed run, you you have to.

998
01:04:46,536 --> 01:04:51,380
Speaker 1: basically he's like constantly flailing his arms even when nothing's happening to make sure the game keeps going.

999
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:52,311
Speaker 1: It's like a big.

1000
01:04:52,331 --> 01:04:53,080
Speaker 1: it's like a workout.

1001
01:04:53,402 --> 01:04:53,826
Speaker 1: He's lucky.

1002
01:04:53,846 --> 01:04:55,200
Speaker 1: it was mercifully short.

1003
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,220
Speaker 0: And that game is absolutely phenomenal.

1004
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,280
Speaker 0: It is one of the best per minute of time I spent playing.

1005
01:05:02,741 --> 01:05:05,680
Speaker 0: It is one of the best video games I have ever played.

1006
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,300
Speaker 1: But apparently you can do it in fifteen minutes.

1007
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:08,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're good at it.

1008
01:05:09,263 --> 01:05:10,720
Speaker 0: But play it play it from the beginning.

1009
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:18,720
Speaker 0: Like you want to judge Breath of the Wild by the twenty three minute speed run link running naked and screaming straight at Gannon with a stick.

1010
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:41,440
Speaker 0: But I guess while it is one of the best video game experiences I have ever had, if you're seeking VR to play that game and every other VR game that's at that level of quality, all of them combined are not even close to being worth the amount of dollars you would have to spend to have the VR to experience that in the first place.

1011
01:05:41,641 --> 01:05:44,880
Speaker 0: Yet you'd better have a lot more you want to do with VR.

1012
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:51,980
Speaker 0: So I found that the line for me was one, interacting with people online in spaces like VRChat because they're so early.

1013
01:05:52,641 --> 01:05:56,860
Speaker 0: I almost want to personally do my own primary research about them.

1014
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,980
Speaker 0: And two, in terms of experiences, I want to make VR experiences.

1015
01:06:02,403 --> 01:06:05,160
Speaker 0: So I wanted to interact with the technology as it evolved.

1016
01:06:05,525 --> 01:06:06,518
Speaker 0: And I'm willing to pay for that.

1017
01:06:06,942 --> 01:06:09,120
Speaker 0: But that is the value I'm getting out of VR.

1018
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:14,900
Speaker 0: The games I play is maybe five percent of the actual value I've gotten out of VR.

1019
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,420
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, our friend Penny just entered VR a second ago, just popped up instead.

1020
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,251
Speaker 1: But I mean, like, are you using?

1021
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:21,440
Speaker 1: you paid all the money for the VR?

1022
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:22,197
Speaker 1: Are you using it?

1023
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:23,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually am.

1024
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:24,100
Speaker 0: I use it pretty regularly.

1025
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,579
Speaker 1: How often do you use it?

1026
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:29,900
Speaker 0: Until I got sick and it got warm out, like during covid, a couple of times a week.

1027
01:06:30,685 --> 01:06:31,739
Speaker 1: Like, all right, there you go.

1028
01:06:31,961 --> 01:06:32,189
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1029
01:06:32,252 --> 01:06:32,438
Speaker 1: Right.

1030
01:06:32,821 --> 01:06:34,420
Speaker 1: That's probably more than I used my switch.

1031
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,440
Speaker 1: But again, it caught, you know, the valve in.

1032
01:06:37,282 --> 01:06:39,059
Speaker 0: But here's the problem.

1033
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:55,018
Speaker 0: A couple of times a week when the weather's not nice, which is a problem, because now not only is the weather nice, but we're coming out, we're entering the long tail of covid winding down, meaning I'm doing a lot of stuff again and I'm doing stuff at the times I would normally be hanging out or playing with VR.

1034
01:06:55,863 --> 01:06:57,380
Speaker 0: So that's a different problem.

1035
01:06:57,601 --> 01:07:00,600
Speaker 0: But I've definitely gotten the value I wanted out of that index.

1036
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,679
Speaker 0: But I'm not going to buy like an index to anytime soon.

1037
01:07:05,002 --> 01:07:08,680
Speaker 1: I think the the tough question is, if you ask yourself, are you going to use something?

1038
01:07:09,102 --> 01:07:12,640
Speaker 1: but something is, you know, new, it's a new technology.

1039
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,284
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1040
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:15,279
Speaker 1: And it's like you have to sort of you.

1041
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:20,309
Speaker 1: can you know, when you watch an Apple keynote, you can imagine the scenarios they present to you.

1042
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:20,431
Speaker 1: Right.

1043
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:27,279
Speaker 1: But then you have to sort of figure out like, well, those aren't things that anyone can do in life right now.

1044
01:07:27,822 --> 01:07:28,023
Speaker 1: Right.

1045
01:07:28,063 --> 01:07:31,239
Speaker 1: Because this technology is not available to the public right now.

1046
01:07:31,983 --> 01:07:34,940
Speaker 1: If I acquire that technology, will I change?

1047
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,020
Speaker 1: Will my life change or will I intentionally change my life?

1048
01:07:38,562 --> 01:07:47,400
Speaker 1: So those scenarios they are presenting to me or some that I've imagined that they didn't imagine are actually now occurring in my life.

1049
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:58,060
Speaker 0: And that requires a degree of self-awareness and introspection that many people cannot achieve or cannot achieve without great difficulty, because it is easy like that.

1050
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,280
Speaker 0: The Apple thing could block ads in real life.

1051
01:08:00,523 --> 01:08:01,110
Speaker 0: Sign me up.

1052
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:01,920
Speaker 0: But guess what?

1053
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,978
Speaker 0: It doesn't do that yet.

1054
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,820
Speaker 0: And it likely won't do that at any point or or something simpler.

1055
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:11,180
Speaker 1: It's like they show a feature like, you know, FaceTime.

1056
01:08:11,482 --> 01:08:11,764
Speaker 1: Right.

1057
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:14,200
Speaker 1: And it's like, OK, video chatting with people.

1058
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:14,762
Speaker 1: Right.

1059
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:18,318
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, if I don't have an iPhone right now.

1060
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:19,745
Speaker 1: Right.

1061
01:08:20,912 --> 01:08:22,260
Speaker 1: And I've never video chat, never.

1062
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:29,260
Speaker 1: And I know video chat existed before FaceTime, but let's pretend that there's never been video chat before.

1063
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,680
Speaker 1: And someone's trying to sell you a video chat machine.

1064
01:08:33,201 --> 01:08:33,462
Speaker 1: Right.

1065
01:08:33,946 --> 01:08:36,078
Speaker 1: And you're thinking like, will I use that?

1066
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:37,586
Speaker 1: Right.

1067
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:39,720
Speaker 0: Young, naive rim would have said, fuck, yeah, video phone.

1068
01:08:39,781 --> 01:08:40,328
Speaker 0: It's the future.

1069
01:08:40,674 --> 01:08:41,100
Speaker 0: Old rim.

1070
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:42,939
Speaker 0: I never want to be on video chat.

1071
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,899
Speaker 0: Even when I'm talking to friends, I want it to be audio only because the video.

1072
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:46,502
Speaker 1: Right.

1073
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,819
Speaker 1: It's like, well, will people I know also buy it?

1074
01:08:50,381 --> 01:08:51,898
Speaker 1: Will they video chat with me?

1075
01:08:52,763 --> 01:08:53,109
Speaker 1: How?

1076
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:53,314
Speaker 1: Right.

1077
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:58,544
Speaker 1: It's like right now, what do I do in my life right now in terms of chatting with people right now?

1078
01:08:58,725 --> 01:09:01,220
Speaker 1: I'm texting and phone calling.

1079
01:09:01,844 --> 01:09:02,760
Speaker 1: Am I going to do this?

1080
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:03,720
Speaker 1: When am I going to do it?

1081
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:04,880
Speaker 1: Who am I going to do it with?

1082
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:12,658
Speaker 1: And you sort of have to imagine this different life, you know, a different you of the future and what your behaviors are going to be.

1083
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,442
Speaker 1: Right.

1084
01:09:13,542 --> 01:09:17,639
Speaker 1: And it's like I've had Apple devices capable of FaceTime for a very long time.

1085
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:20,559
Speaker 1: I've FaceTimed maybe a handful of times.

1086
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,022
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1087
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:24,019
Speaker 0: I'd say, you know, when I use video chat at work because we're required to.

1088
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:37,858
Speaker 0: And when we do geek nights and rarely, mostly during covid, when a large event happened and we were also desperate that we all joined a big old discord call and half of us had our cameras on.

1089
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:42,660
Speaker 0: And even then, the cameras were such a cacophony that they kind of weren't worthwhile.

1090
01:09:43,621 --> 01:09:47,340
Speaker 1: Now, maybe you look at your own life and you say, you know, I got these parents.

1091
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,519
Speaker 1: They are family lives in another country.

1092
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,099
Speaker 1: I emigrated somewhere.

1093
01:09:51,746 --> 01:09:53,058
Speaker 1: I only see them once a year.

1094
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:58,580
Speaker 1: You know, we talk on the phone, but I only get to hear them.

1095
01:09:59,003 --> 01:10:00,059
Speaker 1: It would be nice to see them.

1096
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,559
Speaker 1: I have, you know, I have like young relatives that are like probably grown up a whole bunch or probably wouldn't even recognize them.

1097
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:06,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1098
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:07,400
Speaker 1: Right.

1099
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:11,300
Speaker 1: But they still they sell iPhones in that country and they say iPhones in this country.

1100
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,079
Speaker 1: And my relatives probably couldn't get Zoom or anything to work.

1101
01:10:15,422 --> 01:10:15,705
Speaker 1: Right.

1102
01:10:15,766 --> 01:10:17,120
Speaker 1: This will work easily.

1103
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:17,983
Speaker 1: Right.

1104
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,280
Speaker 1: This is worth investing in.

1105
01:10:20,361 --> 01:10:21,239
Speaker 1: It's going to get used.

1106
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,284
Speaker 1: It'll actually change my.

1107
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:28,479
Speaker 1: you can imagine the scenario because based on what your life circumstances are, how your life will be improved.

1108
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:29,422
Speaker 1: Right.

1109
01:10:29,823 --> 01:10:47,179
Speaker 1: And so, yeah, that's actually probably worth a lot of money to you, even if you don't use it that often, even if you only video chat once a month or something like that, that probably becomes worth it to a person with that story versus a person who everyone they know lives in the same town and they hang out every night.

1110
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:50,780
Speaker 1: And or they don't have any friends.

1111
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:51,539
Speaker 1: They're antisocial.

1112
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,739
Speaker 1: I live in a cave.

1113
01:10:55,863 --> 01:11:02,280
Speaker 0: So I guess much like the scout policy of don't buy a game on Steam unless you're going to play it immediately when it as soon as the transaction is complete.

1114
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,079
Speaker 1: Love that great policy.

1115
01:11:04,321 --> 01:11:04,980
Speaker 1: It's still working.

1116
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:05,740
Speaker 1: I highly recommend.

1117
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:12,919
Speaker 0: I've been following it on Steam for a few years now and it has been shockingly effective at preventing me from buying games I'm not going to play.

1118
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:14,052
Speaker 1: Yep.

1119
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,280
Speaker 1: I've saved quite a bit thanks to that policy.

1120
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:26,915
Speaker 0: But I also when I have bought a game, even if I don't play it a lot, occasionally I've bought a game to play to see how it is partly to see if I should tell anyone else to use it, just like with VR.

1121
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:32,995
Speaker 0: I didn't just go into VR like blindly after watching Oculus people talk about how great it is.

1122
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:46,859
Speaker 0: I like went and got like demos from the company in that booth at PAX, like behind the scenes and like looked at it and tried it and read the specs and understand exactly what the limitations were and what I was getting into.

1123
01:11:47,181 --> 01:11:49,500
Speaker 0: So I didn't go in with unrealistic expectations.

1124
01:11:49,620 --> 01:12:04,059
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of people just generally in the world, but especially nerds, like you kind of alluded to earlier, they'll get excited about the possibilities of a technology or a thing, but they won't actually think about the reality of what that thing is.

1125
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:10,019
Speaker 0: And they like to preorder before, like I don't preorder anything anymore except Zelda games.

1126
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:11,939
Speaker 1: I preorder something.

1127
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,820
Speaker 0: I just nothing I preorder anymore.

1128
01:12:14,473 --> 01:12:14,560
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1129
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,880
Speaker 1: People imagine or they they're with what the ad has sold them.

1130
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,252
Speaker 1: Right.

1131
01:12:20,021 --> 01:12:22,820
Speaker 1: Or, you know, the vision in their head does not match reality.

1132
01:12:23,021 --> 01:12:27,960
Speaker 1: And so they end up making purchases and then the things that they bought just end up sitting there.

1133
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,360
Speaker 1: They were aspirational purchases.

1134
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:35,900
Speaker 0: Last time I preordered a game that wasn't a Zelda game was, oh my God, it was Team Fortress.

1135
01:12:36,762 --> 01:12:40,520
Speaker 0: And the day it came out, I regretted that I had spent that money.

1136
01:12:41,403 --> 01:12:45,720
Speaker 0: And had I waited a day, I might have just not like bothered with it.

1137
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,360
Speaker 1: I think this happens the most with exercise equipment.

1138
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,520
Speaker 1: People buy exercise equipment and they don't actually use it.

1139
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:55,940
Speaker 1: That's a very frequent occurrence, you know, for obvious reasons.

1140
01:12:56,284 --> 01:12:56,480
Speaker 0: Yup.

1141
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:03,940
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1142
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:09,060
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1143
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,480
Speaker 1: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1144
01:13:14,721 --> 01:13:17,400
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1145
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:22,140
Speaker 0: SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1146
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,656
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1147
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:29,899
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1148
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,100
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1149
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:36,336
Speaker 0: And the Geek Nights Patreon Patreon is above that $5 tier.

1150
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,660
Speaker 0: So I say your name over and over again every episode.

1151
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:48,339
Speaker 0: And I do stress, if you don't have those dollars, you can give as little as a dollar and you still get access to that RSS feed.

1152
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:54,900
Speaker 0: And we are using the money on the website redesign, but we have plenty of it.

1153
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:57,139
Speaker 0: So we don't need a lot more now.

1154
01:13:57,621 --> 01:14:02,178
Speaker 0: So what I'd say is Geek Nights is going to, for the foreseeable future, continue on its current thing.

1155
01:14:02,681 --> 01:14:07,279
Speaker 0: We're going to be doing more content again around panels and convention stuff.

1156
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:08,980
Speaker 0: now that, you know, we're in a long tail of COVID.

1157
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:17,679
Speaker 0: So expect us to get back to our sort of free 2020 levels of content creation, plus a few new things we are working on, like those are still coming along.

1158
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:21,100
Speaker 0: But at the same time, don't feel like you have to give to the Patreon.

1159
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:28,380
Speaker 0: I particularly expect that you'll want to do it if you want access to its feed and all that kind of stuff around there, or if you like me saying your name.

1160
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:30,559
Speaker 0: But anyway, just wanted to get that out there.

1162
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:48,799
Speaker 0: I leave you tonight.

1163
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:57,119
Speaker 0: Now that, you know, despite the fact that we said we were going to reimagine Wednesdays, we have a lot of Wednesday episodes queued up.

1164
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:00,499
Speaker 0: We're talking about Spider-Man, Into the Spider-Verse 2 next time.

1165
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,500
Speaker 0: So, that has nothing to do with what I leave you with, which is simply...
