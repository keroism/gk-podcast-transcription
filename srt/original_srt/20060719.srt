1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,091
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 19th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,036
Speaker 1: We talk about comics with 100 bullets.

3
00:00:16,397 --> 00:00:19,658
Speaker 1: also instead of a news We've got a double geek back about Kinetic on.

4
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:22,597
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:31,536
Speaker 1: Well, we actually are going to do a double geek back today since after the Kinetic on coverage We got not one, but two good and interesting emails about it.

6
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,279
Speaker 0: Oh It looks like this geek bag segment has really taken off.

7
00:00:35,601 --> 00:00:40,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, well considering that we got a lot of audio feedback before that we never actually answered on the show.

8
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,438
Speaker 1: We just sent emails back.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, you know I guess when you get emails you like to respond to them But eventually you just kind of have to resist the urge.

10
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:58,895
Speaker 1: yep, so keep in mind if we don't respond to your email It's probably because we're just going to force ourselves to talk about it on the show instead of answering you personally.

11
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:10,519
Speaker 0: and if we do respond Your chances of being on the show or maybe like 50/50 and then in the distant future if we have a hajillion listeners at some Point then we're probably not going to respond to anybody.

12
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,785
Speaker 0: That's what the forums are for.

13
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:13,929
Speaker 1: We'll start paying Mr.

14
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:15,957
Speaker 1: Period and he'll filter all the email for us.

15
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:22,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right Yeah, only you know all the emails go to him and then forward us the ones that are worth reading.

16
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,330
Speaker 1: Watch He'll only forward us the ones that have perfect grammar and spelling.

17
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,177
Speaker 1: We'll get like one email a year.

18
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:32,391
Speaker 1: That'd be awesome All right, anyway, we are first geek back and they're both about Kineticon.

19
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,136
Speaker 1: now is from Michael Moore.

20
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,680
Speaker 1: not not Michael Moore.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,060
Speaker 1: I was gonna say yeah, apparently he gets people make fun of him all the time for that.

22
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,456
Speaker 1: But no, it's Michael Moore of abstract gender a webcomic.

23
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:41,919
Speaker 1: Okay?

24
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:46,865
Speaker 1: Hey, I met you guys at Kineticon when I went over to talk to Yuko on Saturday Not sure if you remember me.

25
00:01:47,045 --> 00:01:51,660
Speaker 1: Well, we do but I'm a webcomic artist and was in the uber webcomics panel.

26
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,174
Speaker 1: I've actually been doing it for the last three years.

27
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:57,451
Speaker 1: of the three I was in this is probably number two.

28
00:01:57,672 --> 00:02:05,999
Speaker 1: last year's was probably the worst But I do think that a lot of the criticisms of the con were pretty dead-on and your ideas for the webcomic panel would Have made it a lot better.

29
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:11,076
Speaker 1: I've been listening to the recent podcast about the con and the last two years has been in the convention center.

30
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:21,950
Speaker 1: the first year I went It was at a college nearby and I think it was the Hartford College or something It's University of Hartford because when it was there one year I was Doing like a summer.

31
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,240
Speaker 0: I was a counselor at a summer camp.

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,460
Speaker 0: That was there also and I remember being at camp that Friday playing kickball and there was like an Inuyasha cosplayer running around outside.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I didn't actually go to the con that year.

34
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,480
Speaker 0: I just went home that night because I was tired of taking care of bratty kids all day.

35
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:39,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mike obviously isn't a native since he didn't know all that.

36
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:41,133
Speaker 1: But anyway, actually no he says.

37
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:54,979
Speaker 1: but anyway when it was prob When it was there It was a 24-hour con and that was really cool and as nice and shiny as the Convention Center is the college probably would work Better for the con since back then they had tons of rooms like each video game had its own room.

38
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,295
Speaker 1: DDR had two rooms and it ran 24 hours a day.

39
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:02,200
Speaker 1: But I guess the problem with the college is that there weren't any big areas to do main events.

40
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:06,780
Speaker 1: I do sort of feel like this year they may have been the worst one is so far panel wise.

41
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:12,740
Speaker 1: But that may be just me because there used to be all sorts of meet-and-greet panels with all the webcomic people's usually doubled up.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,202
Speaker 1: Blah blah blah.

43
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:13,745
Speaker 1: now.

44
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,920
Speaker 1: I'll note me actually that there were a bunch of meet-and-greet panels.

45
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,480
Speaker 1: We didn't actually go to any of them because most of them were on Sunday.

46
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:24,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, also he's totally right about University Department for not having too many big rooms.

47
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:33,038
Speaker 0: I mean, I know a bunch of the buildings there and it's really they don't have like giant auditoriums or big wide-open rooms at all that I know of.

48
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:37,473
Speaker 0: you know Maybe the gymnasium and then they have some outside fields that you could use.

49
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:39,580
Speaker 0: but if there's bad weather your cons ruined.

50
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:45,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, he just goes on for a while to talk about how much he likes geek nights And hopefully you'll see us at Otacon and check out our panels and all that.

51
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,672
Speaker 0: Well, he's definitely gonna see us at Otacon.

52
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:49,448
Speaker 0: Everyone's gonna see us there Except for the blind people.

53
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,036
Speaker 0: The blind people will not see us at Otacon.

54
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,523
Speaker 1: They'd better hear us That's right.

55
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,507
Speaker 1: If they're blind and deaf.

56
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:54,853
Speaker 1: Well, we'll poke him.

57
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:55,355
Speaker 1: Yep.

58
00:03:55,617 --> 00:04:02,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, and anyway Since he said he may or may not plug us That was Michael Moore of abstract gender abstractgender.com.

59
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:07,139
Speaker 0: if you want to read his webcomic Which I have never read and therefore cannot form an opinion about yep

60
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:17,567
Speaker 1: I guess all I really have to say is that I do think that Kineticon hopefully will do something to make the uber webcomics panel as Good as it apparently was in days of yore.

61
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:22,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's it's one thing if something is always sucked And then they can't make it better.

62
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:30,559
Speaker 0: It's like, okay Well, you know, you can't really say anything, but if someone had a good thing going and they failed to maintain it It's just kind of sad

63
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:42,516
Speaker 1: yeah, but actually the second email which I rushed through the first one because this geek back is much longer much more thorough and Also much more official probably answers that question in better detail.

64
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:48,728
Speaker 1: This is from Brianna Ben the vice chairperson of Kineticon, holy crap.

65
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:54,051
Speaker 1: They apparently she listened to our Show on Kineticon and they had quite a bit to say.

66
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,460
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm gonna read the entire thing.

67
00:04:57,782 --> 00:04:59,616
Speaker 0: Can we break it down point by point?

68
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:08,705
Speaker 1: Yep I'll break it down Starting with the webcomics in the dealers room because I remember we talked that all the big webcomics were in the dealers room and the small Ones were in the artists colony.

69
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:12,060
Speaker 1: Yep quote bigger comics get a bit better treatment.

70
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:13,505
Speaker 1: They do more for the convention.

71
00:05:13,906 --> 00:05:17,820
Speaker 1: They may get a free table in the artist colony or the dealers room based on their popularity.

72
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,680
Speaker 1: Additionally anyone can buy a table in either location.

73
00:05:21,142 --> 00:05:24,920
Speaker 1: Bigger comics usually have a bit more money and buy a table in the dealers room smaller people.

74
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,440
Speaker 1: We feel some people feel we are unfair to the smaller comic, but they miss the boat entirely.

75
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,769
Speaker 1: We help foster the growth of any and all webcomics.

76
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,400
Speaker 1: But yeah, the bigger names are gonna have a bigger presence now.

77
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:39,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really weren't complaining that the big names were in the dealers room as opposed the artists alley.

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,900
Speaker 1: It's more that it did seem to detract from the artist alley.

79
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:45,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that was my main problem with.

80
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:57,740
Speaker 0: it is like, you know Usually like at Otakon you go to the artists alley right and the artists alley is anything that's not Dealing the old and the only webcomic I could think of that was in the dealers room at Otakon was mega Tokyo and that's cuz.

81
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:06,040
Speaker 1: He was mostly dealing his merchandise and his stuff true But yet at a katsu khan there were many many webcomic artists in the dealers room.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,460
Speaker 1: I think it depends a lot on the Khan.

83
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,664
Speaker 0: I think it does too.

84
00:06:09,724 --> 00:06:15,582
Speaker 0: But yeah, the only problem with that is that the artist alley is kind of you know marginalized Yep.

85
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:21,018
Speaker 1: Now in terms of the parking lot quote, we hate the parking lot, but we can't restructure the damn thing.

86
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,160
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a I can't complain.

87
00:06:23,762 --> 00:06:26,669
Speaker 0: Kinetic on has nothing to do with its sucky parking lot.

88
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:29,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's completely the Convention Center's sucky parking lot.

89
00:06:29,977 --> 00:06:35,478
Speaker 1: now in regards to food Quote I am told that there will be a mall with a food court built across the street from the CCC.

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Speaker 1: Hallelujah, it really sucks about the no outside for food rule.

91
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,297
Speaker 1: They don't even let us bring in food for our staff members guests or volunteers.

92
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,068
Speaker 1: assets We recommend.

93
00:06:45,088 --> 00:06:46,478
Speaker 0: if you want to have a pizza party can't?

94
00:06:47,161 --> 00:06:52,420
Speaker 1: We recommend the arch street tavern across the street where food costs roughly the same, but it is much better quality.

95
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:53,898
Speaker 0: I didn't know it was there.

96
00:06:54,461 --> 00:06:57,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean anything like in the con book or anywhere.

97
00:06:57,532 --> 00:06:59,880
Speaker 0: that said if you want to eat go to the art street tavern.

98
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:00,743
Speaker 1: I don't know.

99
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:05,105
Speaker 0: I don't think so cuz I know Otakon and a little book gives you a guide to like food in the area Doesn't it?

100
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,139
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, it does.

101
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:14,224
Speaker 1: Yeah They do an extensive thing and actually I would really recommend that Kinetic on at least have one small section in the convo detailing The nearest food.

102
00:07:14,264 --> 00:07:15,107
Speaker 1: that isn't terrible.

103
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:16,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't just get.

104
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:21,407
Speaker 0: was there a map of the surrounding area or actually This idea is kind of crazy.

105
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:24,660
Speaker 1: I came up with this just now so it's not fully thought out now.

106
00:07:24,941 --> 00:07:32,640
Speaker 1: Obviously the reason that the Convention Center doesn't allow outside food So they can make a bunch of money from you know, ripping people off with crappy food.

107
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:40,893
Speaker 1: Every Convention Center does it and the reason they charge so much money is pretty commonly known that Business travelers don't care how much money it costs.

108
00:07:40,913 --> 00:07:42,099
Speaker 1: their company picks it all up.

109
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:55,254
Speaker 1: So it's kind of a scam for Convention Centers to make a bunch of money off of businesses doesn't really work so well for anime cons and honestly Otakon is really the only con that has the Money and the clout to tell the Convention Center.

110
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:55,977
Speaker 1: Hey, that doesn't work.

111
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:56,720
Speaker 1: do something different.

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:05,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is the first year where they're really trying to muscle them over into doing something different with the food Yep, which apparently was helped a lot by the fact that a different person is in charge of the food.

113
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:11,927
Speaker 0: now Yeah But I mean seriously if you let's say you were a business and you were taking out a room or two in the Convention Center for like a big meeting or something.

114
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:14,478
Speaker 0: You could get your own caterer if you want.

115
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:14,779
Speaker 0: they can't.

116
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:15,703
Speaker 1: no No, you can't.

117
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:19,640
Speaker 0: I mean like their way you can pay to get your own caterer in there.

118
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:24,659
Speaker 1: Usually most Convention Centers require you to get any and all food through them.

119
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:30,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean they there's food that you can get through them other than oh, yeah, but it's horribly expensive.

120
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:30,900
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

121
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,395
Speaker 1: But anyway, here's a crazy idea now.

122
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:49,860
Speaker 1: obviously you couldn't do this on the grounds of the Convention Center doi, but Depending on the actual city's laws It might be possible to get a permit to have some sort of food vending just outside the Convention Center and sponsor it by the con.

123
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:55,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, this is the problem of non People without badges taking advantage.

124
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:55,671
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

125
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:56,534
Speaker 1: No you charge money.

126
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:57,900
Speaker 1: You just charge a reasonable amount.

127
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:02,125
Speaker 1: I haven't thought it through it all and I'm gonna think about this because even if it was Wouldn't work for Kineticon.

128
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,660
Speaker 1: There are probably a lot of other cons where they could pull something off like that.

129
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:08,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, a hotel con you can get catering.

130
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:08,977
Speaker 0: I know.

131
00:09:08,997 --> 00:09:09,078
Speaker 0: yeah.

132
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:16,949
Speaker 1: Well anime central used to always have a green room that was full of Entire meals for free for anyone who went to the con.

133
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also a college con you can do it out on the lawn.

134
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:25,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really depends on the the specific geographic area.

135
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,900
Speaker 0: Like let's say I was Otakon right and I wasn't as big as I was Taking up the entire Convention Center.

136
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:35,275
Speaker 0: Yeah And let's say I just used like one or two rooms in the Convention Center in Baltimore.

137
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:45,940
Speaker 0: what I could what I would do To get food is take out one room in a nearby hotel For the food and then if people wanted food they could just walk over a little bridge to like the Sheraton or something where?

138
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,603
Speaker 0: We have food.

139
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll think about this more because there's got to be a way.

140
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:58,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there's that Marriott attached to the Convention Center, right if you took out one room in the Marriott And in Connecticut and put food in there would that work?

141
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,851
Speaker 0: I mean that you can cater whoever you want to the Marriott right.

142
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,524
Speaker 1: see I actually don't know all the details I'm not sure.

143
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's something to check up on.

144
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:11,300
Speaker 1: yeah I mean there's also the liability of serving food and all the trouble around that of course of course.

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 1: But again, I mean we can't blame Connecticut for the food situation because obviously the CCC is being very heavy-handed.

146
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:24,709
Speaker 0: Well every Convention Center with its unions and its big fat hand yeah Heaviness 50 bucks to get a power cable.

147
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,898
Speaker 0: Yeah, big B's Convention Center.

148
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:39,432
Speaker 1: fist All right on an expert quote FYI Otacon now cost $60 pre-reg and they only take pre-reg now, okay It's $50 if you pre-reg before July 7.

149
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:42,649
Speaker 0: July 7 too late It's $60 now.

150
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,417
Speaker 1: over 14,000 people pre-registered for Otacon back when it was $50 this year.

151
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:57,700
Speaker 1: Yep, so less than half of the attendees will pay the full $60 price To go on anime next and anime Boston cost the same amount as Connecticut.

152
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:01,857
Speaker 1: Connecticut does not have the same number in attendance yet, so it gets smaller income.

153
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:07,360
Speaker 1: however We believe that we provide programming that equals or in some way exceeds that of these other conventions.

154
00:11:07,721 --> 00:11:12,415
Speaker 0: I see I have to disagree on that last point saying that they're programming equals or exceeds.

155
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:19,928
Speaker 0: I mean anime next head Rintaro and Murayama and Japanese guests, and you know it was.

156
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:23,702
Speaker 0: it's like one level above Connecticut in programming It's.

157
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:26,140
Speaker 0: it's hard to deny that anime Boston as well.

158
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,037
Speaker 0: You know I mean the American voice actors who usually go to every single convention weren't at Connecticut.

159
00:11:32,137 --> 00:11:33,763
Speaker 1: a few of them were yeah But not many.

160
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:38,199
Speaker 0: It's usually you get like the same like ten people can I kind of had maybe like two or three.

161
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:46,199
Speaker 0: yeah, you know it if If you just look at the guests and you look at the fact that you know a lot of panels were thrown together.

162
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:50,200
Speaker 0: and right You can't I just can't agree with that last statement.

163
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:52,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the gaming helped a lot But I mean

164
00:11:52,862 --> 00:11:58,947
Speaker 0: the gaming did help a lot considering that a gaming convention of almost that caliber It kind of evens it out

165
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:06,600
Speaker 1: even an amazement which I don't remember actually But I'm pretty sure it was either less than or at the very most it cost the same as Connecticut.

166
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:09,552
Speaker 1: Yet their programming was absolutely amazing.

167
00:12:09,873 --> 00:12:11,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, who is that guy you hung out with there?

168
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:18,685
Speaker 1: Oh, they had a Kira Kamiya and just a pile of awesome Japanese guests they also had in Amazing panels.

169
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:22,420
Speaker 1: I mean the panels were well done and well researched like a off the top of my head.

170
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:29,709
Speaker 1: There was a geisha panel And it was run by an actual teacher who had studied this and done like a thesis on it And she really knew her stuff.

171
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,259
Speaker 1: and she put on an amazing lecture.

172
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:34,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, see and almost every panel was of that quality.

173
00:12:35,175 --> 00:12:47,947
Speaker 1: while here at a Connecticut I mean not to Snipe but we've the only panel we went to was someone who was forced to do the panel at the last minute and Looking at the list of panels none of them even seemed Interesting or exciting you know.

174
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:51,137
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess it's just that the con does feel a bit overpriced to us.

175
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:56,296
Speaker 0: still yeah It's not overpriced in terms of just comparing the price to other conventions.

176
00:12:56,878 --> 00:13:07,390
Speaker 0: It's comparing the price to You know when you consider what's at the convention and the fact that you know hey your con has less people Maybe it's because of the price.

177
00:13:07,491 --> 00:13:09,480
Speaker 0: Maybe if you lowered the price you would get more people.

178
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:21,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I just think like Otacon and the amount of programming Otacon has I honestly would pay upwards of $150 for a weekend of Otacon without Otacon is really a deal It's it's sort of a.

179
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:23,252
Speaker 0: it's like a big steal for all the fans.

180
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:26,162
Speaker 0: You know but other cons are not Alright.

181
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:35,029
Speaker 1: now moving on here the no $5 dollar bill issue quote because the Convention Center requested an additional $20,000 up front this year.

182
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,480
Speaker 1: we did not have extra cash on hand to get lots of fives.

183
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:42,400
Speaker 1: We had to borrow roughly six thousand dollars from family and friends in order to meet the initial pre-con costs.

184
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:44,248
Speaker 1: We had foresight, but no money.

185
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,140
Speaker 1: research save kinetic on for more information on that.

186
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:47,964
Speaker 0: Oh, that's right.

187
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:49,051
Speaker 0: save kinetic on.

188
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:57,920
Speaker 1: was that thing that Well all the webcomic artists got together and raised a bunch of money to save kinetic on from bankruptcy after last year's debacle.

189
00:13:58,382 --> 00:14:01,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like the Convention Center requested an additional 20,000 again.

190
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:09,767
Speaker 0: We I think we talked about this before was that either kinetic on failed to read their contract properly and they didn't.

191
00:14:09,887 --> 00:14:15,404
Speaker 0: they should have known that they would have cost more money and therefore probably shouldn't have had it at the Convention Center.

192
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:20,580
Speaker 0: or if the Convention Center did something that was against the contract kinetic on should have gotten a lawyer.

193
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:22,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean honestly.

194
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,577
Speaker 1: I really not have called a lawyer that minute.

195
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:28,819
Speaker 0: normally I would say false dichotomy You know saying it was either this or that.

196
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:38,931
Speaker 0: But when I you know research save kinetic on and I look at what the situation was from the available public information Those are the only two things I can conclude is that

197
00:14:39,493 --> 00:14:44,680
Speaker 1: I'd really lean toward it being the latter Just because of other things I've read and heard about the Convention Center.

198
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:47,337
Speaker 1: But even then I really would have called a lawyer and fought it.

199
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:49,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

200
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway get back on the point.

201
00:14:52,673 --> 00:14:57,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can see the Convention Center asking for the additional 120,000 especially after what happened last year.

202
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:57,608
Speaker 1: Yep.

203
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,783
Speaker 1: Yeah, and as for the fives, uh, I don't know I can.

204
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:03,330
Speaker 1: I guess I would have set up something.

205
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,464
Speaker 1: in the very least you could have had a bunch of people You know ready.

206
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:11,040
Speaker 1: or maybe Friday night take all the money you've got from the con all the cash on hand.

207
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:17,299
Speaker 1: Take it to the bank first thing in the morning Saturday Exchange it for fives and then come back and then you were good to go.

208
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:23,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz on Friday a lot of the people showing up were probably pre reg type people who have already paid, you know.

209
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:25,200
Speaker 1: And then yeah, just set up runners, you know.

210
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,440
Speaker 1: Send people to the bank Constantly getting fives as long as you need him because it's not like they had a bunch of fives and ran out.

211
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,514
Speaker 1: It was that we were some of the first people to register and they didn't have any already.

212
00:15:34,816 --> 00:15:35,057
Speaker 0: Yep.

213
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:35,479
Speaker 0: Yep.

214
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,840
Speaker 1: Yep But yeah, there's not much you can do if you're already short on money.

215
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,600
Speaker 1: I really think the economy better off being outside of the Convention Center for a couple more years.

216
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:51,413
Speaker 1: Then they'd have a lot more money to spend on all these other niceties and then when they jump to the Convention Center They'll have enough people to just pay for it not even worry about it.

217
00:15:51,434 --> 00:16:05,475
Speaker 0: I really You know without knowing any of the finances or accounting or the convention at all I have to say that if you have less attendees Then you know anime next anime Boston and other area conventions you had.

218
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:08,224
Speaker 0: you're charging just as much money You have.

219
00:16:08,665 --> 00:16:12,600
Speaker 0: you know less, you know, you're not at the same level of programming.

220
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:17,843
Speaker 0: You really shouldn't be in a more expensive Venue plus.

221
00:16:17,883 --> 00:16:22,980
Speaker 1: honestly, I think it would really foster the convention experience at least for a few more years to have it in a hotel.

222
00:16:23,242 --> 00:16:33,311
Speaker 1: because I mean like our previous geek back said Going 24 hours in a con like this is huge because most of the people who go are webcomic people who just want to hang out all night with their webcomic friends.

223
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:40,015
Speaker 0: and also your gaming is really strong and if your Gaming can go 24 hours as opposed to people having to stop and pick it up again.

224
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 0: That's also huge.

225
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:55,740
Speaker 1: I mean if you if you wait in a hotel until you get to the point where the hotel is too small and then you jump Everyone's gonna follow you I can guarantee it because at that point that means that more people want to go to the con than Could fit and you have to go to a bigger venue.

226
00:16:56,202 --> 00:17:00,719
Speaker 1: I just don't think that Connecticut is big enough to need to be in a big venue and I really think it's overpriced.

227
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:00,920
Speaker 1: for what?

228
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,282
Speaker 1: You get?

229
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,260
Speaker 0: yeah, there are big hotel.

230
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:06,675
Speaker 0: There have to be big hotels in the capital of Connecticut, which is Hartford.

231
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:10,319
Speaker 1: or of course I mean, there's always the option of moving to somewhere else in Connecticut.

232
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure there's some places in New Haven they could go to.

233
00:17:13,811 --> 00:17:15,960
Speaker 1: I mean Otacon wasn't in Baltimore for a while.

234
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:21,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know there there are lots of other cities in Connecticut, I think Stanford has some places you could be in.

235
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:28,420
Speaker 0: you know the Hartford, Connecticut isn't the only city in Connecticut that's big enough to handle an anime convention of this size.

236
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:34,380
Speaker 1: Alright now regarding the crappy bags quote all conventions this year have been really hit as far as bag sponsors.

237
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:39,917
Speaker 1: The anime companies are really hurting with the closing of Suncoast and other retailers and providing bags is often a $10,000 investment for them.

238
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:45,640
Speaker 1: Even anime Boston had to run around to local stores like Newbury comics to try to get enough bags.

239
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:49,414
Speaker 1: We often supplement our bag supply with the extras of anime Boston.

240
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:50,940
Speaker 1: We had pretty much no bag.

241
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:54,080
Speaker 1: So it was either bum sum from the Best Buy or have no bags.

242
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:58,995
Speaker 1: We decided that having crappy bags is better than no bags for the use in the dealers room.

243
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:00,540
Speaker 1: since not all dealers have bags.

244
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:03,310
Speaker 1: We didn't fill in with goodies because we weren't provided with much.

245
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,595
Speaker 1: see the sponsors blur.

246
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,980
Speaker 1: now I can see that I mean that makes perfect sense.

247
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:14,746
Speaker 1: And my only thing I would say is that I wouldn't have put the program guide in the bag and given it out because that Honestly just look kind of cheap.

248
00:18:15,147 --> 00:18:18,600
Speaker 1: I would have had the bags available at the entrance to the dealers room.

249
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:26,245
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean just usually you get a bag at at registration because it's filled with all sorts of free Advertising.

250
00:18:26,325 --> 00:18:30,125
Speaker 0: shit if it's only has the program guide in it Why are you giving me a bag?

251
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:34,520
Speaker 0: the bag is to hold other advertising in with the program guide.

252
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:39,295
Speaker 1: But in terms of the whole anime industry bit Brianna is pretty much dead on.

253
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:40,720
Speaker 1: the anime industry in the u.s.

254
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,359
Speaker 1: At least for the past few years has been hitting some hard times.

255
00:18:44,982 --> 00:18:47,469
Speaker 0: It's what the way I've heard it explained.

256
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,994
Speaker 0: I don't remember where I heard this.

257
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:51,040
Speaker 0: possibly anime world order again.

258
00:18:52,003 --> 00:18:53,348
Speaker 0: Is that you know?

259
00:18:53,428 --> 00:18:56,560
Speaker 0: media play was like the bit and Suncoast and all you know?

260
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,524
Speaker 0: What was music land?

261
00:18:57,645 --> 00:19:00,860
Speaker 0: that whole company was the big anime purchaser?

262
00:19:01,202 --> 00:19:01,463
Speaker 0: You know.

263
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:03,934
Speaker 0: and whether people were buying anime from them.

264
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:05,240
Speaker 0: It didn't matter.

265
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,251
Speaker 0: It was the fact that they were buying anime from the anime companies.

266
00:19:08,452 --> 00:19:19,080
Speaker 0: therefore the anime companies made a lot of money as media play existed and The belief of those companies with that anime is the way you're gonna make big bucks because you can get DVDs and charge them.

267
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:21,704
Speaker 0: You know full price MSRP and they're gonna.

268
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:36,489
Speaker 0: they're gonna sell and you're not gonna have to compete with the best buy or anyone and start selling your DVDs At like 15 bucks 13 bucks, you know to get one lower than the other store down the street with the blockbuster hits Especially since CDs aren't selling that well anymore either.

269
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the game stops and EVs are killing them on video games.

270
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:53,340
Speaker 0: and I think what's happened is there's been a shift in the DVD industry away from Anime being what's gonna make you the big bucks to TV on DVD being what's gonna make you the big bucks selling.

271
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:04,260
Speaker 0: you know seasons of this seasons of that, you know, and Therefore these the stores like Best Buy and everyone are buying less anime and media play no longer exists.

272
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:10,420
Speaker 0: So there's not too many retailers buying up more lots and lots of stuff.

273
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:16,120
Speaker 0: So the anime companies are only selling clothes are selling a number of DVDs closer to what?

274
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,218
Speaker 0: Actual fans are buying from them and you know, not what retailers are buying.

275
00:20:21,238 --> 00:20:26,760
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I mean, it's also the fact that there haven't been many big properties in the last few years.

276
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:33,558
Speaker 1: I mean Fullmetal Alchemist was huge But because most a lot of people watched it on, you know download bit torrent whatnot?

277
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:44,280
Speaker 1: Cartoon Network Yeah that too and now that the economy is kind of down a lot of people who would normally buy You know every box set that comes out that either don't have enough money or there aren't so many they're interested in.

278
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,699
Speaker 1: I mean of all the anime I've bought recently It's mostly really really old stuff that I've always wanted and now's the time to buy it because there's nothing new to buy.

279
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:52,783
Speaker 0: Yep.

280
00:20:52,943 --> 00:20:53,164
Speaker 0: Yep.

281
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:53,425
Speaker 0: Yep.

282
00:20:53,505 --> 00:21:05,972
Speaker 0: And the other thing is like the companies that are killing on anime, you know the which is like Cartoon Network and WB shows anime right and and all those guys Those guys never sponsor any cons.

283
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:16,672
Speaker 0: It's the visits and the You know the Tokyo pops and the edvs that are then in Funimation Of course that needs to sell this stuff and they're not doing as well.

284
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:17,415
Speaker 1: Yep.

285
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,000
Speaker 1: So there's really nothing you can do about that.

286
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:27,349
Speaker 0: yeah, Funimation is killing this is begun this and Tokyo pop are killing on the manga, but ADV not doing what he used to do.

287
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,273
Speaker 1: All right now.

288
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:33,540
Speaker 1: in regards to the program book quote It seems that you ask us somehow to have descriptions of the programming in the schedule.

289
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:35,290
Speaker 1: I'm not sure how this would be possible.

290
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:41,060
Speaker 1: in regards to the pocket schedule We greatly want to have it but the cost would be the equivalent of the rest of our entire program book.

291
00:21:41,382 --> 00:21:45,449
Speaker 1: We really want to have this but it will be a while before Finances are forgiving enough to allow it.

292
00:21:45,811 --> 00:21:53,279
Speaker 1: in regards to the full color program book I normally veto all suggestions that involve spending money, but I was out ruled on this issue.

293
00:21:53,701 --> 00:22:02,579
Speaker 1: Additionally, we believe that a full color program book would look better to sponsors for the next year Thereby, hopefully improving our financial standing allowing for a pocket program schedule, etc.

294
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:11,874
Speaker 1: Honestly if you hadn't spent the money on the full color book you probably could have gotten the pocket schedule instead or the $5 bills.

295
00:22:14,161 --> 00:22:14,744
Speaker 1: Well, that's enough.

296
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:16,211
Speaker 1: There wouldn't have been enough money for the $5 bill.

297
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:17,417
Speaker 0: It would have been some $5 bills.

298
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:22,478
Speaker 1: I guess for me the pocket schedule doesn't have to be anything fancy like a lot of other cons do it could have.

299
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:27,780
Speaker 0: it could Have been an eight and a half by eleven piece of paper, you know, just a slightly thicker piece of paper.

300
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:34,460
Speaker 1: I mean that I would have been happy with like two pieces of eight and a half by eleven paper stapled together With just a densely printed schedule.

301
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:36,868
Speaker 0: What did anime next had they had like?

302
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,820
Speaker 0: it was sort of like a. it was like a two pieces of paper But it was sort of like a legal piece of paper folded in half, right?

303
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was real wide.

304
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,131
Speaker 1: you could fold it and it was.

305
00:22:45,171 --> 00:22:49,569
Speaker 0: it had the entire schedule on it Yeah, and only it was only like shitty color.

306
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:50,973
Speaker 0: It wasn't like color color.

307
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:53,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would've con puts theirs in black and white.

308
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,003
Speaker 0: They don't care.

309
00:22:54,425 --> 00:22:59,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, you really could have had I'm sure you could have had some sort of pocket schedule And I really think the con should look into it.

310
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,956
Speaker 0: Just don't try to put too much into the pocket schedule think you know.

311
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:08,758
Speaker 1: do it light I mean, it should really just look like a spreadsheet out of Microsoft Office and nothing more.

312
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:12,450
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, just you know tidied up a little don't put those dotted lines all over the.

313
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:18,750
Speaker 0: make it easy to read and simple and full Of the most important information you can fit on a page.

314
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:19,312
Speaker 1: now.

315
00:23:19,352 --> 00:23:23,982
Speaker 1: in regards to the making it look nice for sponsors I don't have much to say about that that's really.

316
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:31,029
Speaker 1: I'm glad to see that kinetic on is at least forward thinking as to how they're going to be solvent in the Future and that's one way to go about it.

317
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:33,700
Speaker 1: I haven't really thought about that issue too deeply.

318
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:38,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was is looking good for sponsors, but they had a bunch of sponsors.

319
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:39,500
Speaker 0: What were they doing?

320
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,787
Speaker 1: Well, we can get to that with the next bit.

321
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:44,659
Speaker 1: Okay quote spot regarding sponsors.

322
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,400
Speaker 1: quote None of our sponsors actually gave us money.

323
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:53,760
Speaker 1: We decided to give various companies the full treatment so that they get a taste of what sponsoring with us in the future gives them.

324
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:57,535
Speaker 1: Best Buy provided us with loader frats flat-screen TVs funny girls.

325
00:23:57,595 --> 00:23:58,840
Speaker 1: gave us some cool prize support.

326
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,199
Speaker 1: Funimation was supposed to give us some goodies which didn't happen yada yada yada.

327
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:07,382
Speaker 1: We basically wanted to pimp out a couple companies in order to show companies that Advertise.

328
00:24:07,643 --> 00:24:13,519
Speaker 1: show companies the advertising we can provide in hopes of gaining further support from these companies and other companies next year.

329
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,949
Speaker 0: Mmm On the one hand it's kind of good.

330
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:31,440
Speaker 0: It's like hey, you know, no if those companies, you know We're thinking poorly of kinetic on it didn't want to sponsor it because they thought it wasn't worth their time You were able to prove to them that it, you know, possibly was worth their time and you know, that's a good thing.

331
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:39,255
Speaker 0: but on the other hand, you know if you give it away for free and Maybe they didn't get what they wanted now when you try to charge for it.

332
00:24:39,295 --> 00:24:41,754
Speaker 0: Maybe they'd like no screw you It's a tough call.

333
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:42,641
Speaker 1: now I don't.

334
00:24:42,923 --> 00:24:46,699
Speaker 1: I think it's actually a good thing because I'm not sure how it'll turn out.

335
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:54,200
Speaker 1: But like I said in the previous bit I'm very glad to see the con at least considering options and thinking long term as opposed to short term.

336
00:24:54,641 --> 00:25:01,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still would you know, I wouldn't have an official sponsor of a con without them, you know doing something It's like hey you sponsored the con.

337
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:04,278
Speaker 0: We put your logo on things and you don't do anything.

338
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:06,309
Speaker 0: for us It's like okay, but why not?

339
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,294
Speaker 1: I mean worst case.

340
00:25:07,435 --> 00:25:08,962
Speaker 1: they didn't lose anything That's true.

341
00:25:09,163 --> 00:25:15,960
Speaker 1: And if the company decides not to go with them next year, they still haven't lost anything Yeah, but they also haven't gained anything that they greatly needed.

342
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,331
Speaker 1: So if you didn't lose anything then who cares if you didn't gain anything?

343
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,194
Speaker 1: you're even you might.

344
00:25:20,234 --> 00:25:24,393
Speaker 0: if if the worst case area The question is could they have gained something?

345
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:25,559
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

346
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,295
Speaker 0: Well, if they let's say they didn't make sponsorship free could they have gotten sponsors to pay?

347
00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:31,118
Speaker 0: why bother?

348
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,518
Speaker 1: They obviously were solvent without that this year anyway, and a comment has already had a lot of financial trouble.

349
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:42,393
Speaker 1: suddenly Approaching a bunch of sponsors and wanting money probably isn't gonna go over so well.

350
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,198
Speaker 1: this way they can show that one.

351
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:48,791
Speaker 1: they were solvent Without sponsors - they had treat sponsors very well in the future.

352
00:25:49,533 --> 00:25:52,020
Speaker 1: I think I think it was a fairly good decision on their part.

353
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:59,796
Speaker 1: I mean the fact is the con was in a very tricky situation Monetarily anyway, and there's really no easy way out of the situation.

354
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:00,177
Speaker 1: They're in.

355
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:06,278
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, even though honestly, I think if they move to a hotel this situation would be greatly mitigated.

356
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:07,984
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Mm-hmm.

357
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,008
Speaker 0: I'm just 50/50 on.

358
00:26:09,048 --> 00:26:09,751
Speaker 0: it's like it could be.

359
00:26:09,771 --> 00:26:12,119
Speaker 0: this could be that you know.

360
00:26:12,681 --> 00:26:12,842
Speaker 0: Like.

361
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:23,340
Speaker 0: if someone like it would be like if what do we give away free ads on geek nights and then be like Yeah, now you can see how many people visit you and then will they actually pay us if we ask for money later?

362
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,565
Speaker 0: You know, yeah It's just the share where.

363
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:30,240
Speaker 0: lesson, you know, if you give someone share where for free how many times they actually buy it?

364
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:30,862
Speaker 0: Not so many.

365
00:26:31,264 --> 00:26:32,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, but who cares?

366
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:33,171
Speaker 1: they didn't lose anything.

367
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:38,144
Speaker 0: Yeah until they hack your share where the I'm just being silly.

368
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:43,260
Speaker 1: I mean one that the closest thing to hacking the convention were the $1 Geek Squad shirts.

369
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,172
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.

370
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:47,520
Speaker 0: No, not really back.

371
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:52,420
Speaker 1: I saw a couple of people who claim that they were cosplaying as Best Buy guys, which was moderately funny.

372
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course Geek Squad is terrible.

373
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:54,709
Speaker 0: Talk about that later.

374
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the email goes on for a while.

375
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:10,578
Speaker 1: you know bother other little points, but I'm really happy that Brianna took the time to respond to us and I'm glad that we could give our response in Kind to the response because once again Connecticut wasn't a bad con by any means and it has a lot of potential.

376
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:11,501
Speaker 0: Yep Yep.

377
00:27:11,542 --> 00:27:14,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just yet to be fulfilled potential.

378
00:27:14,538 --> 00:27:22,513
Speaker 1: Yep I will see what happens next year because I think especially now that they've got a successful year under their belt That next year will go a lot smoother.

379
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:29,864
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I think what we'll do is we'll just wait for friends who are there on Friday, you know, give us a call Tell us what's going down.

380
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:31,530
Speaker 1: I might go for the whole weekend.

381
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:31,892
Speaker 1: We'll see.

382
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,136
Speaker 0: We'll see cuz I'll.

383
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:33,879
Speaker 1: probably I'm gonna see.

384
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:42,080
Speaker 1: maybe I'll see about doing the geek nights panel there or Taking over the anime club panel because they obviously are hurting for someone to do it and we do it everywhere else already.

385
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:46,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they're doing something like that, you know any con that I'll actually how we have a panel or something.

386
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,808
Speaker 1: I'll have to go to any con a because I could get you a panel at a con You wouldn't want to go to okay.

387
00:27:51,848 --> 00:27:54,238
Speaker 0: Well, I would just go do the panel and go home.

388
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,978
Speaker 0: All right, what kind are you gonna do?

389
00:28:00,686 --> 00:28:13,995
Speaker 1: Oh You have no idea things of the day, oh my Minds real quick.

390
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:19,878
Speaker 1: now a lot of people in the forums have been asking and someone's Reminded me outside of the forums that a while ago.

391
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:21,886
Speaker 1: I talked about an anime music video.

392
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:25,567
Speaker 1: That was really good and I said I'd post a link and I never did.

393
00:28:26,492 --> 00:28:28,830
Speaker 1: So I didn't have a great thing of the day for today.

394
00:28:28,912 --> 00:28:29,447
Speaker 1: So here we go.

395
00:28:29,671 --> 00:28:33,950
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is that anime music video that I neglected to post talk about a cop-out.

396
00:28:34,491 --> 00:28:35,233
Speaker 1: Yeah, what do you want?

397
00:28:35,374 --> 00:28:38,164
Speaker 1: Actually it works because it's a really good AMV.

398
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:39,610
Speaker 0: It is a pretty good AMV.

399
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,887
Speaker 0: I think a lot of the appeal has to do with the song which is a really good song.

400
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:49,779
Speaker 0: That's really good lyrically and Young punk kids won't know the song.

401
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:52,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I barely knew the song.

402
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, the song is one of those songs has a funny name and I forget the name off.

403
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,162
Speaker 1: It's something and terminus, but everyone knows it as the 2525 song.

404
00:28:58,182 --> 00:29:07,030
Speaker 1: Yep You know people who don't know about it, yeah, so all of us new punk kids have heard the song exactly now.

405
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:12,150
Speaker 1: The thing is the video didn't actually win anything normal at Otacon.

406
00:29:12,612 --> 00:29:14,982
Speaker 1: No one voted for it, but it was so bad.

407
00:29:15,082 --> 00:29:16,146
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone voted.

408
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:16,990
Speaker 1: Well, not enough people.

409
00:29:17,074 --> 00:29:24,370
Speaker 1: Yeah It was so badass that the people in charge of the AMV contest at Otacon gave it an award like the judges pick or something.

410
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:32,309
Speaker 0: It was like the editors choice equivalent and it was probably the best music video of the whole con At least for us, you know the kind of music videos that we like.

411
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:41,205
Speaker 1: yeah, it really does seem to say something that the kinds of music videos that a lot of younger fans like are the Naruto people fighting with each other?

412
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:46,670
Speaker 1: funny But not so much funny even just you know fighting scenes and quick cuts and action.

413
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:48,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's all about the beat mix.

414
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:52,900
Speaker 0: if the beat of the video matches the beat of the audio Then you got a good video.

415
00:29:53,262 --> 00:30:01,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, but back in the day It seems like the popular videos were the really really funny ones or else the really really serious.

416
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:06,012
Speaker 0: Well, it's not so much the funny but the clever It's all.

417
00:30:06,052 --> 00:30:07,336
Speaker 0: it was all about the cleverness.

418
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:11,168
Speaker 0: like aha you were funny in a clever way cuz it's easy to just.

419
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:17,390
Speaker 0: I mean That's if I took a funny anime an anime that's already hilarious and then I made an AMV of it.

420
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,017
Speaker 0: It's not hard to be funny.

421
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:21,047
Speaker 0: still it's hard to be cleverly funny.

422
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:27,670
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, it's like if you hear the song crawling by Linkin Park and you think yeah, that sounds a lot like Shinji.

423
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:30,624
Speaker 1: I'll do an Ava music video to that anime.

424
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not clever.

425
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:33,194
Speaker 1: Everyone thought that.

426
00:30:33,254 --> 00:30:39,855
Speaker 0: you know, we should do is we should take Nana and make an AMV but only when they have funny faces Only funny faces.

427
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:41,541
Speaker 1: We just need the right song for that.

428
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,930
Speaker 0: Does anyone know any good songs about funny faces?

429
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,574
Speaker 1: Hmm.

430
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's think on that.

431
00:30:48,051 --> 00:30:56,306
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you don't like anime music videos if you like anime music videos, whatever I highly recommend you download this video and watch it.

432
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,329
Speaker 1: if you don't like him It'll probably change your mind.

433
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:05,559
Speaker 1: If you do like him, this might show you a kind of video that isn't so well known these days And not frequently made these days.

434
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:09,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, and whoever made it mad props to you We don't know who you are.

435
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:10,117
Speaker 0: We can't give you.

436
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:10,940
Speaker 1: well, we do know.

437
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:13,250
Speaker 1: I'm linking to his anime music video page.

438
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:13,876
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

439
00:31:13,896 --> 00:31:15,329
Speaker 0: I was gonna say how to know who it was.

440
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:21,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only that but he wrote a long thing about why he picked what anime he picked and how he put it all together.

441
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,178
Speaker 1: And now this is the second version of this video.

442
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:24,303
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

443
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:24,624
Speaker 0: Yeah.

444
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:25,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like stuff like that.

445
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like.

446
00:31:26,974 --> 00:31:28,822
Speaker 1: I like meta information about anything.

447
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,450
Speaker 0: I like it's sort of like a DVD extra.

448
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:32,014
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

449
00:31:32,435 --> 00:31:33,919
Speaker 0: My thing today is real short.

450
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,941
Speaker 0: It's a real short.

451
00:31:35,001 --> 00:31:38,310
Speaker 0: It's a tiny tiny clip of video from Japanese TV.

452
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:52,310
Speaker 0: I don't know what show I don't know what but there's some cops Japanese cops and then There's Darth Vader and that's it and you'll see the joke when you watch it, but it's it's a pretty nice.

453
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:56,390
Speaker 0: it's a good quick joke of Japanese police and Darth Vader.

454
00:31:56,511 --> 00:32:08,789
Speaker 1: I mean it's set up just like the beginning of episode 4 where you know There's the door and the people waiting and then Darth Vader bus in But then it's just Darth Vader and then something funny happens and that's it.

455
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,727
Speaker 0: It's a real quick and it should make you laugh which is why it's a good pick.

456
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:14,510
Speaker 1: we can't ruin it.

457
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,197
Speaker 1: It's just too funny.

458
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:26,990
Speaker 1: No, no, not gonna ruin it Alright, so today because we went long in the first bit talking about Kineticon and all that which I'm sure we're gonna talk about More in the future too because probably next year when there's another Kineticon.

459
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:39,154
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only that but I really want to talk to the staffers and the people at Kineticon to at least Give more detailed advice and I mean Kineticon is a good con and I really wanted to succeed and maybe we can get more Information out of them.

460
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:43,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in return, I'm sure we could get more people to go to Kineticon.

461
00:32:43,473 --> 00:32:45,409
Speaker 0: Maybe we could convince them to go to a hotel.

462
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:51,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean think of this if we brought the whole front row crew to Kineticon, that would be a significant chunk.

463
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:55,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be a significant portion of the convention population.

464
00:32:55,247 --> 00:33:00,970
Speaker 0: Wow Yeah, we'll have to think on that like the front row crew could probably like conquer the game room.

465
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:10,265
Speaker 1: All right, all right, so we instead of talking at length about Arcadia of my youth Which we're instead going to talk about next week.

466
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:15,190
Speaker 0: Yep We're gonna talk about a comic because we hardly ever talk about comics.

467
00:33:15,391 --> 00:33:25,310
Speaker 1: Not only that but even though it's listed right there anime manga comics Wednesdays Yep, and two people have actually asked us to you know lean toward comics a little bit because we've been neglecting them.

468
00:33:25,892 --> 00:33:31,630
Speaker 0: The main reason we neglect them is because I read enough of them and rim doesn't read enough of them.

469
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,887
Speaker 0: So if I talk about them, it's pretty much just me talking and rim going.

470
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:35,108
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

471
00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:36,695
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, let's see what I've been reading lately.

472
00:33:36,736 --> 00:33:43,059
Speaker 1: I mean Scott Pilgrim, which a lot of people call it a manga though It's not it's comic but I mean it's in trade form.

473
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,865
Speaker 1: So it doesn't.

474
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,128
Speaker 0: it's a digest.

475
00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:50,301
Speaker 1: It's not A comic the way most people think of the word comic.

476
00:33:50,502 --> 00:33:51,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

477
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:51,866
Speaker 0: It's all.

478
00:33:52,387 --> 00:33:53,250
Speaker 0: as far as I'm concerned.

479
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,718
Speaker 0: They are all works of graphic literature.

480
00:33:55,858 --> 00:34:03,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I do the publishing format matters not as so much I think it's just that we don't read so many traditional comics and I don't read any.

481
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:11,594
Speaker 1: I mean the one I read just now Right before the show that we're gonna talk about is the first non Scott Pilgrim comic I've read since.

482
00:34:11,895 --> 00:34:18,900
Speaker 1: I tried to read that captain Marvell thing Yeah, and I couldn't finish that I couldn't deal with it.

483
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:23,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think now that they've canceled Marvel team up They're really like the.

484
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:26,083
Speaker 0: I'm not getting any superhero comics really like.

485
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:27,789
Speaker 0: there's almost none except for old ones.

486
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:39,563
Speaker 0: Well that one I'm trying to get all the old great ones that I've missed without, you know getting any of the Common crap, you know, I'm kind of interested in that fables kind of one about x-men.

487
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:40,786
Speaker 1: It's like the x-men.

488
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:42,110
Speaker 0: Oh x-men fairy tales.

489
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,581
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I'm actually really interested.

490
00:34:44,621 --> 00:34:48,498
Speaker 0: but that's not really a superhero comic That's a fairy tale comic that just happens to.

491
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,929
Speaker 0: you know, they put a little bit of x-men hints in there.

492
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what it is fanboys by.

493
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:55,344
Speaker 1: it's like those awesome posters.

494
00:34:55,404 --> 00:34:56,830
Speaker 1: We see an artist allies at cons.

495
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:02,250
Speaker 1: That's like a character from one anime, but they're dressed up as a character from another anime.

496
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:05,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually it's the guy who I'll talk about it.

497
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:07,930
Speaker 0: we could read it and then talk about it when it's done.

498
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:11,170
Speaker 0: Yep, there's only gonna be four issues long and I've already got two of them.

499
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:18,969
Speaker 1: So yeah, and the other thing I was reading that I really liked was x-makina But Scott Johnson borrowed all of it and now I can't read it until he gives it back.

500
00:35:19,471 --> 00:35:20,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's still going on.

501
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:23,164
Speaker 0: So there'll be more volumes in the coming months.

502
00:35:23,465 --> 00:35:24,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I really like it.

503
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:25,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's really good.

504
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:34,095
Speaker 0: All right, but today we decided to talk about the first trade of a hundred bullets now which is a Comic from vertigo.

505
00:35:34,296 --> 00:35:38,010
Speaker 1: Scott and a couple other people had told me about this before and I just hadn't gotten around to it.

506
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,929
Speaker 1: So because we wanted to do a somewhat short episode Scott ripped it out of his room and I read it just now.

507
00:35:43,792 --> 00:35:45,296
Speaker 0: And this I read it earlier today.

508
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:45,878
Speaker 1: Now.

509
00:35:45,918 --> 00:35:47,683
Speaker 1: The thing is everyone who had told me about it.

510
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:49,910
Speaker 1: The concept sounds really awesome.

511
00:35:50,031 --> 00:35:52,410
Speaker 1: I mean the concept is just all right.

512
00:35:53,453 --> 00:36:12,790
Speaker 1: Say there's this magic government whatever where you can give someone a gun with a hundred bullets in it and Those bullets are marked in such a way that if anyone Investigates the shooting or anything that happens with this gun or this ammo as soon as they find these bullets The investigation is dropped all records of it are deleted.

513
00:36:12,932 --> 00:36:14,009
Speaker 1: It's as though it never happened.

514
00:36:14,331 --> 00:36:19,087
Speaker 0: Basically, if someone comes up to you and gives you the gun and says here's a gun.

515
00:36:19,107 --> 00:36:22,970
Speaker 0: Here's a hundred bullets Do what you want your that you're above the law.

516
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:29,130
Speaker 0: You can just go around killing people and you won't get in trouble and nothing will happen to you and you won't go to prison.

517
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:39,768
Speaker 0: If cops come and harass you then they'll let you go real quick and yeah Yeah, a total carte blanche to kill whoever you want to kill without consequences of law.

518
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:45,730
Speaker 0: But who knows about other consequences of you know, but there won't be any legal governmental consequences.

519
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:52,610
Speaker 1: Now at its root this sounds like an awesome Concept for a comic or a novel or a movie or anything.

520
00:36:52,851 --> 00:37:00,412
Speaker 0: I've noticed there are like a lot of the comics I'm picking up like a lot of the ones where I just pick up the Number one are like these awesome Concepts.

521
00:37:00,432 --> 00:37:07,942
Speaker 0: like some guy comes up with this crazy idea that wouldn't work in a movie or a TV show or anything But in a comic you can do any crazy idea you want.

522
00:37:08,023 --> 00:37:08,565
Speaker 1: What was that one?

523
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:09,128
Speaker 1: We saw at?

524
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,632
Speaker 1: Otacon.

525
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:11,716
Speaker 1: I think it was two years ago.

526
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:15,690
Speaker 1: It was a rhinoceros who was a hitman, but everyone else was just a human.

527
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,521
Speaker 1: But for some reason this guy was a rhinoceros.

528
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:18,125
Speaker 0: Yeah.

529
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:18,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty good.

530
00:37:19,051 --> 00:37:22,873
Speaker 1: I forget who it was or what it was, but that kind of thing Yeah, exactly.

531
00:37:22,953 --> 00:37:30,156
Speaker 0: So, you know when you come up if you come up with a really great premise for a story Comics are always the great place to go.

532
00:37:30,176 --> 00:37:35,130
Speaker 0: I mean the American comic industry has really just become R&D for the movie industry.

533
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:36,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know it's like they.

534
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:38,119
Speaker 0: they make some spider-man comics.

535
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,249
Speaker 0: They figured out what works and then they make a spider-man movie, you know.

536
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:50,010
Speaker 0: so this has a really great premise, but Still I don't know if I'm gonna buy any more than the first one.

537
00:37:50,231 --> 00:37:52,908
Speaker 1: I was really really underwhelmed by this.

538
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was moderately underwhelmed.

539
00:37:55,998 --> 00:38:00,010
Speaker 0: Like I I think the problem was I had a really high expectation and it wasn't met.

540
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,382
Speaker 1: Yeah, well to me it was that one.

541
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:09,368
Speaker 1: you have the concept right, you know The hundred bullets above the law and that's why my expectation was high because the premise was quality.

542
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:14,630
Speaker 1: yet The actual premise is almost hardly even looked at least in the first story.

543
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:24,382
Speaker 1: The very first story is very long in this book and yet the vast majority of it Majority of it is completely unrelated to the 100 bullets.

544
00:38:24,663 --> 00:38:26,890
Speaker 1: It's just these ghetto thugs yelling at each other.

545
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:36,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really feels like I'm watching some police show on you know Primetime TV like a CSI or any of those cops.

546
00:38:36,443 --> 00:38:42,369
Speaker 0: Well not cops, but you know any of those shows Those police shows that are on TV that I don't watch because I don't have TV.

547
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:54,590
Speaker 1: I mean girl in prison gets out of prison Given the gun turns out that some cops were the ones who killed her Husband and child and then there's a slight twist ending which is kind of actually okay.

548
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,590
Speaker 1: But the bulk of it is just her hanging out with all her different homies and they're all talking to each other in and out.

549
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,250
Speaker 1: The the accents and the speaking are very much represented in the writing which made it very difficult to read for me.

550
00:39:07,773 --> 00:39:09,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, it also made it hard for me to read.

551
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:15,070
Speaker 0: You know, I pretty much just like skipped over a whole lot of it cuz you know half it wasn't even important.

552
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:18,023
Speaker 0: It was just like set up and too much set up.

553
00:39:18,304 --> 00:39:19,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't even useful set up.

554
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:20,855
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of a lot of it.

555
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:30,082
Speaker 1: It was just people talking to each other about stupid crap I don't care about to the point that I just skipped it all and then like I'd flip flip flip flip All right, they stopped talking the guns back.

556
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:30,707
Speaker 1: What's going on?

557
00:39:30,948 --> 00:39:35,930
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, I think the first story is actually like three issues of comic book long.

558
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:39,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was real long which just dragged it out and I lost.

559
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:39,883
Speaker 1: I kept.

560
00:39:39,983 --> 00:39:44,749
Speaker 1: I lost interest to the point that I was Just kind of hoping in every scene that she would shoot him and get it over with.

561
00:39:45,151 --> 00:39:46,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really could have fit it in.

562
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:49,087
Speaker 0: like, you know a fewer issues.

563
00:39:49,127 --> 00:39:49,890
Speaker 0: I mean the first story.

564
00:39:51,011 --> 00:39:52,700
Speaker 1: Well, the second one was a little better.

565
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:54,550
Speaker 1: It went more with the concept.

566
00:39:55,011 --> 00:40:02,430
Speaker 1: Yep, like the except that again, it didn't really go anywhere and it was even aside from the implausibility of the gun thing.

567
00:40:02,652 --> 00:40:04,190
Speaker 1: It was even less plausible.

568
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:08,141
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like when they got to the computer stuff.

569
00:40:08,181 --> 00:40:10,470
Speaker 0: I was like just why what's going on?

570
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:11,937
Speaker 0: That's yeah, it makes no sense.

571
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,390
Speaker 1: I mean it was like hackers computing.

572
00:40:15,051 --> 00:40:39,517
Speaker 0: basically, the story is there's a guy and He's a bartender I think and he used to be an awesome restaurant guy but his career was ruined and his whole life was ruined when he was framed of being a child pornographer and Basically, you know the guy comes and gives him the gun and you know, he says here's the gun here's the bullets You know, you won't get in trouble.

573
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:43,150
Speaker 0: his evidence to prove that this is the person who did it, you know.

574
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,268
Speaker 0: And then that person, you know, just kind of miraculously shows up.

575
00:40:47,373 --> 00:40:54,850
Speaker 1: Now the thing is the story was good except that it totally petered out at the end Like when you find out the reason she framed him.

576
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,190
Speaker 1: It was just such a letdown like it was the most anticlimactic thing.

577
00:40:59,692 --> 00:41:05,162
Speaker 0: The first story had that kind of twist at the end Which is like the only good part of that story.

578
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:10,389
Speaker 0: the second story Just if it would have had a twist like the first one it would have been great.

579
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:16,110
Speaker 1: But it didn't have a twist so much as it had that unrelated thing with the people shooting at each other in the helicopter.

580
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what that was.

581
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:29,563
Speaker 1: that has to be set up for yet another story or something random or I mean it felt Like in Watchmen where they had like the parallel like two people would be talking But then they wouldn't show the two people.

582
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:33,601
Speaker 1: they'd show an Unrelated scene like something going on in the street.

583
00:41:33,641 --> 00:41:40,970
Speaker 1: that was actually parallel to the conversation But this was just like random and completely unrelated and crazy.

584
00:41:41,652 --> 00:41:47,530
Speaker 0: See, you know, I look at this comic and there's actually like three things going on, right?

585
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:55,030
Speaker 0: There's number one in any individual story arc There's the story of you know, whoever got the gun and what their situation is, right?

586
00:41:55,737 --> 00:41:56,829
Speaker 0: And I care about that.

587
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,718
Speaker 0: But the problem is is that story isn't?

588
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:04,150
Speaker 0: you know, there's two of them in here and they're both not the greatest stories.

589
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:05,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty mad.

590
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're kind of average.

591
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:12,570
Speaker 1: now There's also the story of because they seem to be following the thread of why is this gun here?

592
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,229
Speaker 1: Why is this person giving it out?

593
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,171
Speaker 1: He has yet.

594
00:42:15,592 --> 00:42:23,428
Speaker 0: the other two things are the story of the guy who's giving the gun out and Then the story of the gun itself and you know what's happening with it.

595
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:27,850
Speaker 1: now Don't get the impression that I'm saying that these stories are meh.

596
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:33,070
Speaker 0: I want to hear more about the guy with the gun because I really don't want to hear about the guy with the gun.

597
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,970
Speaker 1: I was hoping that the whatever the gun was would never be explained and like you wouldn't even care about it.

598
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:51,830
Speaker 1: I expected a whole bunch of unrelated stories with how people would deal with this responsibility and how people would deal with this gun and if they went into a plot about oh Well, the guy with the gun did it because he wants to do this and this and get these people.

599
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:53,000
Speaker 1: I just I don't care about that.

600
00:42:53,122 --> 00:42:53,888
Speaker 0: Well, see I do.

601
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:58,830
Speaker 1: The guy if the story were that if the story was just that I'd be cool with it.

602
00:42:58,990 --> 00:42:59,252
Speaker 1: Well, the

603
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:13,014
Speaker 0: thing is is I think it feels to me I don't know cuz I haven't read anymore that the story is going to eventually like later on You're like as you go on you'll find out more and more about the guy with the gun, but the guy with the gun I'd like him.

604
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:14,099
Speaker 0: I don't want to know about him.

605
00:43:14,139 --> 00:43:19,296
Speaker 0: I want him to be like a faceless g-man, you know It's the gun itself.

606
00:43:19,637 --> 00:43:23,690
Speaker 0: I'd like to always be you know, wondering what its story was like.

607
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:24,673
Speaker 0: Hey, how come?

608
00:43:25,054 --> 00:43:36,590
Speaker 0: you know, you can do this and not get caught and you know who exactly way up is doing something You know, I'd like, you know, I don't want to actually find it out, but I want to want to find it out all the time.

609
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:47,037
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I guess the story like this if this concept either has to be all the individual stories of people with the gun or The mystery of where the gun came from.

610
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,906
Speaker 0: I think it feel I don't know if it's going to.

611
00:43:49,926 --> 00:44:02,670
Speaker 0: I Know I don't know but it feels like it's going to start out being stories of people with the gun and eventually Be you know, the other one like it's gonna do both except the second story.

612
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:03,195
Speaker 1: That's a lie.

613
00:44:03,216 --> 00:44:05,473
Speaker 0: That's how my instinct tells me although I have no evidence.

614
00:44:05,493 --> 00:44:11,271
Speaker 1: the second story almost right away goes into like the person who was the Recipient.

615
00:44:11,432 --> 00:44:20,620
Speaker 1: the person who was the recipient of the gun loses and the person he was supposed to kill Then goes off on this thing Like she's gonna be some sort of recurring character like they.

616
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:23,189
Speaker 1: they set it up to where she kind of knows what's going on.

617
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:25,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, you see that's the kind of.

618
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:25,698
Speaker 0: that's how come.

619
00:44:25,738 --> 00:44:34,367
Speaker 0: I have the feeling that the story will evolve, you know They'll keep showing you individual stories of people who get the gun and along the way you'll get more.

620
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:38,523
Speaker 0: you'll learn more and more And more about the gun itself and the guy who's giving it out.

621
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:39,969
Speaker 0: and that's you know.

622
00:44:40,731 --> 00:44:41,734
Speaker 0: That's what comics do.

623
00:44:41,754 --> 00:44:54,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just it was really kind of unimpressive and it feels like the concept is solid But it follows the wrong Characters for the wrong amounts of time and focuses on the things that I don't care about.

624
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:56,162
Speaker 1: Well not even going into the stuff.

625
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 1: I want to see.

626
00:44:56,706 --> 00:45:04,929
Speaker 0: Yep What I think I'd like to do is look up and see if the same guy right is writing this book like all of it.

627
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:10,169
Speaker 0: What would be really cool is if they just said hey anyone who wants to?

628
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:20,010
Speaker 0: or any you know get a whole bunch of different people to write stories about Someone who gets a gun with a hundred bullets that are untraceable and that way you'd see a whole bunch of different stuff.

629
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,781
Speaker 0: Because you know the stories that this guy's writing, you know aren't.

630
00:45:24,203 --> 00:45:28,144
Speaker 0: they're not the greatest in the world to be honest Just the pacing's off.

631
00:45:28,204 --> 00:45:28,829
Speaker 1: Everything's off.

632
00:45:29,151 --> 00:45:33,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, if they got someone else to write, you know stories on the same premise that could be really cool.

633
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:40,782
Speaker 0: Like maybe they you know get ten guys together and say okay everyone, right, you know 36 page comic about.

634
00:45:41,064 --> 00:45:41,889
Speaker 0: you know this premise.

635
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:42,974
Speaker 1: Well, this would be good.

636
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:46,489
Speaker 1: in is like remember when Yuko and Brian were in that compilation of.

637
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:48,761
Speaker 1: you know Here is a setting or here is a thing.

638
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:50,571
Speaker 1: everyone writes stories around it Mm-hmm.

639
00:45:50,732 --> 00:45:52,076
Speaker 1: Just have a compilation book.

640
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:55,428
Speaker 1: the book is hundred bullets and then everyone has their story in it.

641
00:45:55,969 --> 00:46:02,050
Speaker 0: Yep I think this is another also a victim of you know, the publishing in the United States.

642
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:10,190
Speaker 0: This thing is actually coming out in comic book issues Every month and then this is like the first I don't know how many issues.

643
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:15,750
Speaker 1: If I'd picked up the first or first one or two issues, I never would have bought another one.

644
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,386
Speaker 1: I would have put it right back down because it just felt like it wasn't going anywhere.

645
00:46:18,527 --> 00:46:20,635
Speaker 0: Yep You know, it's really.

646
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:25,490
Speaker 0: if this was it's like one trade, you know, just we're going to make a book.

647
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:27,015
Speaker 0: Here is the whole thing at once.

648
00:46:27,537 --> 00:46:30,167
Speaker 0: there, you know, ten different stories about this gun.

649
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:33,425
Speaker 0: the end I mean, here's that something I would have bought.

650
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:34,290
Speaker 1: here's how it feels.

651
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,119
Speaker 1: Imagine you're going to see the matrix, right?

652
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:39,898
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and they reveal that he's in the matrix No spoiler spoiler whatever.

653
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:42,251
Speaker 1: and then you know He's.

654
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:58,183
Speaker 1: he's learning about this matrix thing and then for a half hour in the movie it shows him just like walking around in the matrix talking to people or Just like not none of the plot or anything just something completely unrelated that you don't care about.

655
00:46:58,223 --> 00:47:00,770
Speaker 1: like show him masturbating in the bathroom.

656
00:47:01,615 --> 00:47:09,490
Speaker 0: It's like they show you characters Like having you know, the moral dilemma like oh look this guy has a moral dilemma.

657
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:20,830
Speaker 0: He's got a gun and can kill people but at the same time You know, he won't get away with it But he's gonna feel bad and he is killing someone and all that jazz, but they don't actually explore it.

658
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,640
Speaker 0: They just put people in the situation.

659
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:27,223
Speaker 0: You see the person in the situation You see what they do, but you don't act.

660
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:27,786
Speaker 0: you know this.

661
00:47:27,826 --> 00:47:31,842
Speaker 0: they're not really Exploring any of the morals or anything like that.

662
00:47:31,863 --> 00:47:33,290
Speaker 0: They're just putting them on show.

663
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:37,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a very superficial treatment of what could be a very interesting idea.

664
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, they could have gone a lot deeper like show the guy going like, oh, what do I do?

665
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,511
Speaker 0: blah-blah-blah, I Don't know.

666
00:47:45,376 --> 00:47:46,642
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I'll read anymore.

667
00:47:46,883 --> 00:47:48,230
Speaker 0: No, I don't think I'm gonna get any more either.

668
00:47:49,371 --> 00:47:51,980
Speaker 0: But yeah, so we talked about comics.

669
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,750
Speaker 0: all you people who want us to talk about comics more Yep, if you really want us to talk about comics suggest something.

670
00:47:57,891 --> 00:48:01,850
Speaker 0: Oh, there actually was that one single comic story at the end that was tacked on.

671
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:08,627
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even read that the one with the old lady Basically, yeah, I flipped through it and I realized that it wasn't related to what I was reading.

672
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:09,110
Speaker 1: So I stopped.

673
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:09,952
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was it.

674
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:10,514
Speaker 0: basically it's.

675
00:48:10,634 --> 00:48:21,750
Speaker 0: it's a one comic story about this old lady who apparently had the gun a long time ago and She killed someone and she comes in to confess and they're like, there's nothing about that.

676
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,564
Speaker 0: So yeah, you just go on huh?

677
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:29,111
Speaker 0: And then at the end like some other guy is given the gun or something and it's you know It's.

678
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:31,843
Speaker 0: it's just like a little tiny twist story on its own.

679
00:48:32,325 --> 00:48:40,541
Speaker 1: So you just again even there It sounds like the story's just focused on the things I don't care about and completely skip everything I actually want to read a story about yeah.

680
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:41,023
Speaker 0: Yeah.

681
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:42,711
Speaker 0: Oh It's just.

682
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:49,650
Speaker 0: you know, someone comes up with a good premise and then they don't you know Execute it and use it in a in the correct way.

683
00:48:50,631 --> 00:48:54,390
Speaker 1: Well, at least the correct way to get rim and Scott to read it exactly exactly.

684
00:48:54,992 --> 00:48:58,464
Speaker 1: So if anyone has read this and disagrees, I don't know you could send us a geek back.

685
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:02,869
Speaker 0: Yeah, geek backs are cool You know, maybe we could talk about more comics later.

686
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:05,504
Speaker 0: Try to find something that doesn't.

687
00:49:05,706 --> 00:49:16,770
Speaker 0: it's awesome You know, it seems like a lot of comics that are just based on a premise only Seem to like not always turn out to be the greatest things in the world.

688
00:49:17,151 --> 00:49:21,970
Speaker 1: Well, like Teen Boat was a really funny idea, but I can't see myself reading much more of that.

689
00:49:22,312 --> 00:49:27,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, I read you know, two Two issues a Teen Boat and it was funny.

690
00:49:27,818 --> 00:49:29,383
Speaker 0: Haha Tina turns into a boat.

691
00:49:29,423 --> 00:49:30,206
Speaker 0: Haha pirates.

692
00:49:30,346 --> 00:49:34,975
Speaker 0: Okay, it's not funny anymore But it's an ongoing Series and you know, he's.

693
00:49:35,396 --> 00:49:39,369
Speaker 0: I guess the guy is making more Teen Boat I guess and you figure out you know you go through.

694
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:46,830
Speaker 0: It's just the because comics in America keep you know, they shoot for ongoing stuff.

695
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:53,230
Speaker 0: Things end up that way, you know where even if it's you know, the premise is only good for a cut.

696
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,569
Speaker 0: You know a short bit.

697
00:49:54,871 --> 00:49:59,665
Speaker 0: They just keep going with it and they write it in such a way that it can keep going somewhere.

698
00:49:59,685 --> 00:50:00,889
Speaker 0: I don't know.

699
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:06,626
Speaker 0: It'd be much better if just each issue of this comic was one story a good story.

700
00:50:06,646 --> 00:50:19,390
Speaker 0: That was interesting You didn't you know, you had the same premise of a guy gets a hundred bullets and a gun and you know You won't get in trouble, but you never explain why or how or who's giving it to him or anything like that.

701
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:28,508
Speaker 0: you just there it is is you don't need an explanation and Then each issue is just a story and then if somehow it gets cancelled you just stop making issues and it's like you.

702
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:31,212
Speaker 0: never you Know it doesn't matter All right.

703
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:39,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway next week we'll probably review Arcadia of my youth Which we finally got around to watching hooray.

704
00:50:39,379 --> 00:50:42,890
Speaker 0: Maybe we can watch a lot more that Harlock action in the future.

705
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:44,650
Speaker 1: We'll also have another geek back.

706
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:55,141
Speaker 1: it's old and we haven't gotten around to it a while but one of our listeners went to anime Expo and we have his thoughts on the Relative level of awesome that that con is.

707
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:58,153
Speaker 0: we're gonna have to go to that con eventually You know what?

708
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:03,030
Speaker 1: I have absolutely no desire to other than from a purely journalistic perspective.

709
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:07,670
Speaker 1: I have never heard anyone say good things about that con and at least anyone that I would trust.

710
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:11,390
Speaker 0: It's sort of just like, you know, the San Diego Comic Con of anime.

00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:14,041
Speaker 0: it's just all the whole anime industry is there.
