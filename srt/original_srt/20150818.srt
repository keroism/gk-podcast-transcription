1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,471
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday August 18th 2015.

2
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:15,880
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek guys tonight.

3
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:20,634
Speaker 1: Somehow we've never done a show on dance dance revolution.

4
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:21,376
Speaker 0: We sort of have.

5
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:22,500
Speaker 1: so here we go.

6
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:24,978
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,636
Speaker 1: Well in 2006 you were correct.

8
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:35,480
Speaker 1: We did a show where we reviewed games that we played on the Wildwood boardwalk.

9
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:39,292
Speaker 0: Actually saw two such shows in the in the archives there.

10
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:46,993
Speaker 1: now which one or the other one cuz that one I found we specifically reviewed time crisis for DDR supernova and some other game.

11
00:00:47,335 --> 00:00:47,676
Speaker 0: there weren't.

12
00:00:47,696 --> 00:00:49,564
Speaker 0: there were two in there But they were pretty much like.

13
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:56,385
Speaker 0: none of them were dedicated DDR shows where he talked about nothing, but DDR and I feel like There's much to say about DDR.

14
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:58,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact we did a. we did a panel.

15
00:00:58,652 --> 00:01:01,300
Speaker 1: I on DDR at a PAX a long time ago.

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,342
Speaker 1: It was one of our like, you know, we do three Mentioned.

17
00:01:04,382 --> 00:01:05,325
Speaker 0: it wasn't about.

18
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 1: well, it was games our mind control where we've talked about rhythm games.

19
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:16,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, and as I recall when we did the panel I realized that I had like another hour's worth of stuff to say about DDR.

20
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:20,774
Speaker 1: Sure But yeah, so we're an amazing wedding in a giant ball.

21
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:28,431
Speaker 1: non-wedding law due to crazy Inside joke circumstances, but we're out in the woods in this giant house.

22
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:32,000
Speaker 1: That is pretty much the house from phantasmagoria.

23
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:32,925
Speaker 1: Mmm.

24
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,446
Speaker 1: Well, here's what I'd say.

25
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:35,707
Speaker 1: They're

26
00:01:35,747 --> 00:01:39,000
Speaker 0: much smaller than any sort of Resident Evil video game type house

27
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,382
Speaker 1: That is true but seventh

28
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,469
Speaker 0: guest maniac mansion type of the rooms

29
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:57,096
Speaker 1: that it had and the layout of those rooms and Several specific features are so deeply reminiscent of the stuff in phantasmagoria that when I saw them as a kid and as an adult watching that let's play of it.

30
00:01:57,116 --> 00:02:00,046
Speaker 1: I Couldn't believe they'd exist.

31
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:04,280
Speaker 1: Like I couldn't imagine like a house that was physical and real that had a structure like that in them.

32
00:02:04,422 --> 00:02:06,403
Speaker 0: Go to old houses yeah, but never.

33
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:16,475
Speaker 1: I never seen that giant fish radiator on top of the stove the the like heater in the upstairs or the What used to be a stage for what I presume was a bordello.

34
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:17,620
Speaker 1: that is now a linen cloth.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:30,176
Speaker 0: you're just gonna presume the most awesome thing obviously, but This is because you I mean obviously you didn't live in a rural area Old houses like that before but there's a lot of old manor houses all over Detroit.

36
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:35,320
Speaker 0: if you go to summer camp Right every summer camp has like this sent the house at the center of it.

37
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:48,779
Speaker 0: That's like the camp's house right where like, you know the cafeteria is usually in there or this hall or whatever camp to halo had that offices those sorts of things right and Those center houses at summer camps are always that kind of house.

38
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,651
Speaker 1: It was mostly the stage because that was like there is a row.

39
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:54,994
Speaker 0: the no longer at stage.

40
00:02:55,435 --> 00:03:02,180
Speaker 1: the stage with the weird like Unfitting wall in front of it to turn it into something else stage wasn't there anymore is just the wall with the door in it.

41
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,660
Speaker 1: Yep, but that exact thing is in phantasmagoria and there is a stage behind it and there's a murder machine back there.

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,231
Speaker 1: There wasn't a murder machine in this one.

43
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:11,340
Speaker 1: There was just a linen closet.

44
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:14,928
Speaker 0: So I also found the attic stairs behind that.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,289
Speaker 1: but at this wedding we had a very important Group of people together.

46
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,839
Speaker 1: We had the original four people.

47
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:28,797
Speaker 1: That the four it was me Scott our friends Pete and Alex when we found team in our friends hot bull.

48
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:31,724
Speaker 0: Yep Scott is hot lion.

49
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:35,714
Speaker 1: Yeah bull is clearly superior because once again bull is the winner.

50
00:03:35,734 --> 00:03:41,660
Speaker 0: archers King Archer didn't win The only one human second place only one with human intelligence the Archer.

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,359
Speaker 1: However, I think if you had just an archer versus just a bull and the Bulls goal was to fuck up the archer.

52
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:50,846
Speaker 1: I think the bull would win.

53
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:53,380
Speaker 0: dude people kill bulls without even the bow.

54
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,953
Speaker 0: They just stab the arrows right into the bow.

55
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,843
Speaker 1: You try that their hand Let's hand you.

56
00:03:58,024 --> 00:04:01,220
Speaker 0: so if you got a bow, it's gonna be way easier because the bull even can't get even close to you.

57
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I've seen like I've seen horrible videos of bullfights.

58
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,963
Speaker 1: They'll get like 15 hours into that bowl and this isn't even slowed down Because they didn't get.

59
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,234
Speaker 0: if you got a bow you can shoot the arrow so hard.

60
00:04:10,254 --> 00:04:11,862
Speaker 0: it can go right through the skull in The brain.

61
00:04:12,084 --> 00:04:12,968
Speaker 1: No, probably not.

62
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:15,120
Speaker 1: I actually are good at aiming with that kind of bow.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 1: Plus this is a Mesopotamish bull our bull and a Mesopotamish bow.

64
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,459
Speaker 0: That means the bow is mad weak compared to a Spanish one.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,095
Speaker 0: But yeah to match the weakness of the bow.

66
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:32,065
Speaker 1: so it evens out Now that bull is probably just as badass as a modern bull who says Animals gonna be mad weak.

67
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:36,480
Speaker 0: It's not gonna eat like sure Mesopotamish bowls like modern corn and shit.

68
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:41,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, that Mesopotamish bull is probably fucking dangerous and that Mesopotamish bow is probably some BS.

69
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:44,193
Speaker 0: Also, I could just drown that motherfucker in the Tigris.

70
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:47,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the Euphrates But anyway, it's right there.

71
00:04:47,822 --> 00:05:00,039
Speaker 1: I think we did a show on this but we you know how we found Tiggers and Euphrates and everything, but it remains after so many years to the point that it was forgotten and re-released recently.

72
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,187
Speaker 1: Tiggers and Euphrates might be our favorite.

73
00:05:02,207 --> 00:05:05,200
Speaker 0: It just went out of print and then the license was bought by a different guy.

74
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,526
Speaker 1: It was pretty widely forgotten though.

75
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:07,490
Speaker 1: There was a lot of packs.

76
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,680
Speaker 0: The new printing is by the way worse than the old printing.

77
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:13,280
Speaker 1: It's better in a few ways and worse in the majority of ways, right?

78
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,299
Speaker 0: But I mean, it's still perfectly playable.

79
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:24,559
Speaker 1: Like it amazes me that you know I am very fickle in my taste in games and that I pretty much Will read the rules to a game and be done with it before I finish reading them.

80
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:43,808
Speaker 1: But Tiggers and Euphrates has somehow remained my favorite tabletop German style game ever and remain So to this day despite constant play, but we had the alumni together probably some of the most expert players of this game in the world and we played a game that

81
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:44,189
Speaker 0: we know

82
00:05:44,290 --> 00:06:02,580
Speaker 1: that we haven't played in a long time and So sublime is the feeling of playing a game with three other people who have just as much experience expertise and knowledge as in a game as you and Literally just sitting down setting it up without saying a word and playing a super intense fast game.

83
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:07,594
Speaker 1: Game took like an hour and I won pretty pretty handily.

84
00:06:07,675 --> 00:06:09,560
Speaker 0: You went on that with three tie breaks.

85
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:10,664
Speaker 1: Yes with Alex.

86
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,551
Speaker 0: That is not handily.

87
00:06:12,651 --> 00:06:15,040
Speaker 0: Handily is like I have a wide margin.

88
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:20,900
Speaker 1: I was on the third tie break with Alex You and Pete not really contenders.

89
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,828
Speaker 0: I got into a really bad situation.

90
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:29,160
Speaker 0: you did where I was able to devastate opponents But I was and I was able to get my leaders back on the board.

91
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,400
Speaker 0: But the particular arrangement of my leaders back on the board put them in the kingdoms that did not have the matching monuments.

92
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:37,547
Speaker 0: I was not able.

93
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,118
Speaker 0: so while I was able to hold position I was not able to hold the correct position.

94
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:48,499
Speaker 0: You know, there was no way to move because you can't swap leaders and at the beginning of the game I had a fistful of red tiles.

95
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:57,480
Speaker 0: So I used it to my advantage and put pressure early and then later in the game I had no red tiles to speak of and I only internal conflicts were available.

96
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:05,255
Speaker 0: So that was partly because a lot there was a lot of my Catastrophes had already been spent because that's how I got into that position.

97
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:20,276
Speaker 1: in the first place was by early Attack, then it was interesting because it was a game where you see like three gigantic kingdoms with literally a one square channel separating them across half the board and There was a wall of catastrophes.

98
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:33,633
Speaker 1: at one point It was a great game But I'm pretty sure the only reason I won the sole reason is in that third round Where I did that internal conflict with five red tiles and took Pete's Kingdom.

99
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:44,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much the leader that I put in that spot Did not move and sat there for literally the entire game was never contested and never in account.

100
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,714
Speaker 0: It wasn't possible for me to care anyone to contest that.

101
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:46,915
Speaker 0: yeah,

102
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:58,740
Speaker 1: cuz I walled it off so you couldn't even do an internal and No one want to do an external because it was by then like green points that pretty much won me the game that Single conflict in the beginning and the fact that no one

103
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:03,016
Speaker 0: You're discounting all the things that led up to your ability to make that conflict.

104
00:08:03,076 --> 00:08:05,587
Speaker 1: Yeah in the third turn I had five red tiles in my hand, right?

105
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:08,419
Speaker 1: But you know how I had five red tiles in my hand.

106
00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:16,880
Speaker 1: I started with four red tiles in my hand I played the bare minimum of them and then the next to turn the next turn I played two non red tiles.

107
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,134
Speaker 1: Basically, it was the fourth or fifth turn actually not the third turn.

108
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:23,505
Speaker 1: thinking back to the game anyway T&E is a great game.

109
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:24,187
Speaker 1: Sure.

110
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,332
Speaker 1: You got any gaming news?

111
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,460
Speaker 0: So this company?

112
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 0: I read a news this morning about a company that just launched called fig.

113
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:35,520
Speaker 0: It's named after like some hall like Figueroa Hall or something.

114
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,940
Speaker 0: That's a place that people hang out after e3 for parties or eating or something.

115
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:51,368
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what the deal is But anyway, what this company does is basically Kickstarter for games Except you get to actually invest in the game somehow and actually get a return on your investment for reals.

116
00:08:51,429 --> 00:09:03,900
Speaker 0: not just you mean you can still do the Kickstarter thing where you Back the game and get t-shirts or goodies or whatever like normal But you can also back and real invest for reals without having to be accredited or anything.

117
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,820
Speaker 1: So I am really excited if this works, but also it is a complicated thing to do legally.

118
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:15,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, this seems some kind of shady kind of whoa kind of what's going on here.

119
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,418
Speaker 1: it's a game changer.

120
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:19,920
Speaker 0: if it works though Sure much investigation has to be done into this.

121
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:30,890
Speaker 0: I would not give them even one penny until we are a hundred percent sure that this is legit and for reals, but Shortly after reading the news about the creation of this thing.

122
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,760
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I learned something just now, you know how this works.

123
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:34,785
Speaker 0: There's a new law.

124
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the Obama thing the JOBS Act, right?

125
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, they made it.

126
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,859
Speaker 0: the what you need to do for accredited investing has changed.

127
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,740
Speaker 0: so That was what allowed us to exist.

128
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:55,479
Speaker 0: But anyway, a very important person announced shortly after these news articles went up that they are working there and that person is Heels who used to be the person who ran programming at PAX.

129
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:59,057
Speaker 1: I think I would describe his job as impresario of PAX.

130
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:00,425
Speaker 0: sure Well, not anymore.

131
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:02,174
Speaker 0: His job is now something something.

132
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:15,380
Speaker 0: We don't know at fig Yeah, so the fact that he is working there a person that we know a lends it some credibility and B means we can get a lot of information about this place because we know a person who works there.

133
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:19,408
Speaker 1: So we are Like we know people at oculus.

134
00:10:19,428 --> 00:10:20,312
Speaker 1: They don't tell a shit.

135
00:10:20,332 --> 00:10:25,255
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, it doesn't matter Is that we're going to get the lowdown on this deal?

136
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:28,958
Speaker 0: So And also we know a lot about games.

137
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,108
Speaker 0: We if there's any legit.

138
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:32,771
Speaker 1: you don't realize.

139
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,340
Speaker 0: there are two possibilities fuck stop trade.

140
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:39,776
Speaker 0: Yeah possibility one This is a total bad thing.

141
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:50,300
Speaker 0: fuck them And we're gonna tell you is you won't get ruined by it or B. We're all gonna make money, bro Yeah, cuz uh, I actually kind of we will all work together to make money.

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:58,177
Speaker 1: I kind of recently liquidated all my Amazon and take to interactive stock just because they were way high and I figured might as well take some.

143
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:00,749
Speaker 0: I don't want to sell anything cuz I'd have to pay taxes up.

144
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:09,256
Speaker 1: So you got to do a wash - you got to sell something that you're losing money on and then buy it back at a low price later.

145
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:12,776
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's.

146
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,042
Speaker 1: so here's the example I own up.

147
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:15,610
Speaker 1: this is depending on where you live.

148
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,735
Speaker 1: This may or may not be illegal.

149
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:17,157
Speaker 1: It depends.

150
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:17,799
Speaker 1: There's a lot of.

151
00:11:18,141 --> 00:11:19,929
Speaker 1: do not take stock advice from me.

152
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:25,630
Speaker 1: But theoretically what you can do in some situations is say I got stocks making a ton of money like it's up.

153
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:29,622
Speaker 0: You bought it at 50 and now it's $200, but I had another stock.

154
00:11:29,703 --> 00:11:32,033
Speaker 1: I bought a 200. that's now at 50.

155
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:32,839
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so.

156
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:41,847
Speaker 0: sell them both Alright, so now I've got the same amount of money I started with and then buy back the stock that lost money the cheap one.

157
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,248
Speaker 0: That's at 50 now.

158
00:11:43,051 --> 00:11:47,368
Speaker 1: So now you realized a big gain and a big loss and they cancel each other out.

159
00:11:47,388 --> 00:11:47,609
Speaker 1: Okay?

160
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,329
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

161
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,630
Speaker 0: So why even if you're selling the one at 50 and then buying it right back why even do that?

162
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,790
Speaker 0: Why not just sell the big one and buy the cheap one?

163
00:11:54,991 --> 00:11:55,372
Speaker 0: Why would you?

164
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:55,774
Speaker 0: why?

165
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:59,448
Speaker 0: what's the point of selling the cheap one and buying back the same exact shares you just sold?

166
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,390
Speaker 1: well because they're Two separate transactions you sell the big one and you have to pay taxes on that.

167
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,098
Speaker 1: Yes, but the way these taxes work is.

168
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:09,650
Speaker 1: you pay taxes on everything you gained - everything you lost that year.

169
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:15,087
Speaker 0: Oh, so if you sell the cheap one and buy it right back you still had losses because you sold.

170
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:18,597
Speaker 1: yes now Some places have laws.

171
00:12:18,658 --> 00:12:23,056
Speaker 0: the problem is you you just didn't make any fucking money though Except you did.

172
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,301
Speaker 0: because now you have twice.

173
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:28,299
Speaker 1: you were gonna hold on you because this is assuming You were gonna hold on to that stock.

174
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,550
Speaker 1: that's down knowing that it's eventually gonna go back up.

175
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,410
Speaker 0: So now you have double the shares of the two or many more of the shares of the cheap one.

176
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:45,990
Speaker 1: You basically make all the money from the big stock that did well You are still gambling Hoping that the cheap one that is currently cheap goes back up and pretty much I only invest in things again.

177
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,238
Speaker 1: Do not take stock advice for me.

178
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,144
Speaker 1: I'm not there.

179
00:12:48,426 --> 00:12:53,130
Speaker 1: all that stuff I pretty much only I'm like, I'm what you call a contra investor.

180
00:12:53,271 --> 00:13:02,390
Speaker 1: I invest in things that have dropped for reasons that I think are stupid Like when there is that big breaks like when I made a lot of money like way back and like started investing.

181
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:15,930
Speaker 1: I bought Toyota when the stock collapsed after that like the accelerator scandal where like the cars would accelerate and kill people Because I was confident that was solely caused by old people in floor mats pretty much and turned out.

182
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,360
Speaker 1: I was right and the stock came back and I made a boatload of money.

183
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:27,893
Speaker 0: and then I invested all that money in Hasbro because Ponies or like the earnings of some company are down this quarter just because so the stock they didn't meet estimates of the stock market Punishes them.

184
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,944
Speaker 0: but it's like that company's doing just fine.

185
00:13:29,984 --> 00:13:31,070
Speaker 0: In fact, they're doing great.

186
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,450
Speaker 0: They've got all these good business plans and there this product is gonna be very successful.

187
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:38,390
Speaker 1: I that they've talked about like oh take to a game company.

188
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:45,070
Speaker 0: I just went down because maybe the stock market in general went down and some bullshit financial nonsense got his good example.

189
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,115
Speaker 1: Oh take twos way down.

190
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:48,165
Speaker 1: Oh, look, no big games came out this year.

191
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:49,150
Speaker 1: What's come out next year?

192
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,176
Speaker 1: Oh the new Grand Theft Auto stock.

Speaker 1: people don't know shit about this by stock.

00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:55,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's worked out real.

195
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,326
Speaker 0: Well, you know you're buying it far enough in advance cuz you're going long-term.

196
00:13:58,346 --> 00:13:59,110
Speaker 0: They're going short-term.

Speaker 0: They're only looking at what's like the next month.

198
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,209
Speaker 0: They don't want to hold anything for more than like a day.

199
00:14:03,431 --> 00:14:12,828
Speaker 1: All right, so but yeah, basically Looking at this if this is legit and real I know a fuck ton more about games than I do about stocks.

Speaker 1: yes dagger guy, okay?

263
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that dagger is obviously cursed like a hundred percent.

264
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:32,900
Speaker 1: that dagger is cursed.

265
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,871
Speaker 1: It's like every time they talk about him.

266
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:36,775
Speaker 0: It's not a secret.

267
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,680
Speaker 1: They pretty much tell you It's like just an asterisk next to his name.

268
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,559
Speaker 1: It's like he who carries the cursed dagger and he's gonna fucking stab someone with it suddenly.

269
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,307
Speaker 1: Meanwhile why didn't they keep that dagger?

270
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:49,400
Speaker 1: that the one assassin had the one that had like the flame blade?

271
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:51,575
Speaker 0: Maybe it's even more curse in the stable.

272
00:18:51,595 --> 00:18:52,139
Speaker 0: I don't know.

273
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:53,867
Speaker 1: I don't know seems like a powerful weapon.

274
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,474
Speaker 0: also didn't it set on fire or something?

275
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:56,780
Speaker 1: well the blade was hot.

276
00:18:57,001 --> 00:18:57,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

277
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:58,980
Speaker 1: I don't know if it does that all the time.

278
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,973
Speaker 1: Maybe they don't know that power were to turn it off or what?

279
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:02,643
Speaker 0: I don't know, but anyway That's the end of that.

280
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:06,600
Speaker 0: there's not really much to say because we're too preoccupied with packs and the meta times.

281
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,932
Speaker 0: So let us move on to you show.

282
00:19:09,012 --> 00:19:14,710
Speaker 1: so on November 21st 1998 a momentous thing happened that I did not know about dance.

283
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:23,181
Speaker 1: dance revolution was released in Japan and We did not discover dance dance revolution until the year 2000.

284
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:25,380
Speaker 0: this is not entirely true.

285
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:35,095
Speaker 0: I knew that there was a game called dance dance revolution and perhaps 99 or even earlier 2000 and I knew that it was a game that involved dancing on four arrows.

286
00:19:35,115 --> 00:19:38,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I think I'd heard of it And I thought it was.

287
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:42,979
Speaker 0: you know, not knowing anything other than that about it I thought it was stupid, but you know what?

288
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,320
Speaker 0: I thought like Pokemon was some stupid kids game before I ever played it.

289
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:50,970
Speaker 0: So, you know, yeah It's just like oh Nintendo's got a new franchise.

290
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,054
Speaker 0: It's some kids garbage.

291
00:19:52,095 --> 00:19:52,557
Speaker 0: What have yep?

292
00:19:53,481 --> 00:19:55,820
Speaker 1: So dance dance revolution was this thing that we kind of ignored.

293
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,654
Speaker 0: I was like in middle school or high school or something in the US like that.

294
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,160
Speaker 1: shit was not available.

295
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:06,533
Speaker 0: No well they did release a US dance machine that just said dance dance revolution on it.

296
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:11,531
Speaker 0: that had what was one player and Included a very limited crappy song selection.

297
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:32,100
Speaker 1: It had like 12 or something songs on it Did because licensing reasons and also I'm pretty sure that came out later and I never encountered it until 2001 when I went to Cedar Point and there was a single US mix dance dance revolution machine at the front of an arcade and I spent an entire evening playing it.

298
00:20:32,461 --> 00:20:32,581
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

299
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:39,160
Speaker 1: So if you've never played DDR, it's that game with four arrows and you just dance to music on those four arrows.

300
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,060
Speaker 0: Now this seems really freaking stupid, right?

301
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:46,480
Speaker 0: A lot of people say things such as that's not real dancing, right?

302
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,896
Speaker 1: It's counter-strikes not real shooting, right?

303
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:51,989
Speaker 0: Exactly It also is just.

304
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:57,253
Speaker 0: you know at the time when it came out It's like so you step on the four arrows and it's just like what.

305
00:20:57,774 --> 00:20:58,577
Speaker 1: and there had been.

306
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:01,340
Speaker 0: when I saw it I was like that is the dumbest thing I've ever seen.

307
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,444
Speaker 0: Why are you guys playing this?

308
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:09,520
Speaker 1: and there had been rhythm games before in various forms that I just always thought were stupid Like I'd always thought those kinds of games were stupid.

309
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:13,457
Speaker 1: They were just like mole whack-a-mole just music based whack-a-mole.

310
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:14,060
Speaker 1: They're always dumb.

311
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,708
Speaker 0: I mean the arcades always had the spider stomping game.

312
00:21:16,748 --> 00:21:18,192
Speaker 0: What's the difference exactly?

313
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:22,989
Speaker 1: So and to cut the anecdote short We're at RIT and the anime club.

314
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:28,251
Speaker 1: in the gaming clubs like event There's like this overnight thing had set up.

315
00:21:28,432 --> 00:21:29,737
Speaker 0: I don't think gaming club existed yet.

316
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:33,408
Speaker 0: Yeah, did Our way, okay, not EGS.

317
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:34,712
Speaker 1: Okay, I came way later.

318
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:42,307
Speaker 1: In fact video games used to be mostly the purview of Our way, I thought it was Springfest or social night or whatever.

319
00:21:42,327 --> 00:21:43,753
Speaker 1: It was one of those things remember we always.

320
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:44,275
Speaker 0: I think it was.

321
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:50,160
Speaker 0: it was a purely anime club Event because the anime club had purview over things that were Japanese including Japanese video games.

322
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,620
Speaker 0: So they had things such as card captor Sakura Tetris.

323
00:21:53,661 --> 00:22:00,940
Speaker 1: Yeah But that that is also why when our wag had DDR the anime club would set the TV up for it.

324
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:02,575
Speaker 1: Sure, like weird.

325
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:08,133
Speaker 0: All right Because the people in the anime club were the people who owned modded or Japanese Playstations.

326
00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:10,626
Speaker 1: Yep So they said at a time

327
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:13,014
Speaker 0: when the PlayStation new was brand fucking new and

328
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:21,669
Speaker 1: Scott and I were walking past it and we just kind of made fun of it and I thought it was stupid and kind of made fun of the people playing it and left and then Scott went and played a big D&D game.

329
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:29,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, as I recall I was playing a big D&D and I decided well I'll play this thing Whatever cuz everyone was way into it and we were poo poo in it and rim went to play it.

330
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:44,320
Speaker 1: So fast forward like four hours Scott comes back from D&D I'm still playing it and I'm like Scott you gotta you gotta get over here And I'm like, I'm pretty sure that's the stupidest thing ever seen but I must not knock if I have not tried.

331
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:52,933
Speaker 1: I like four hours later me and Scott are both playing it and then I like I immediately got a Ps1 and modded it to play this game.

332
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:56,950
Speaker 1: I ordered pads and We didn't play in DDR ever since.

333
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:01,560
Speaker 0: so usually if people ask me What the best game period ever is, right?

334
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:16,747
Speaker 0: I usually say something like Super Metroid or Mega Man 2 or Zelda 1 or Zelda 3 And I don't know if I really want to change my Super Metroid answer But I'm leaning more and more Towards saying DDR.

335
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:17,852
Speaker 1: and what was that panel?

336
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:23,840
Speaker 1: at a PAX where the audience was like Adding and removing games from a top 10 like most important games ever list?

337
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,893
Speaker 0: yeah, and the smart guy made spy party added DDR to the list and me and rim were like And the rest of the audience was like what?

338
00:23:30,195 --> 00:23:30,920
Speaker 0: right anyway.

339
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:38,599
Speaker 0: So let me talk about DDR as the best game ever because DDR The reason I think it might be the best game ever.

340
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:43,999
Speaker 0: Is that anything that you would say is a thing like think about the list of things that make a game good.

341
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,288
Speaker 0: DDR has all of them right.

342
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:51,000
Speaker 0: Super Metroid is not right one of the best games there is of all time.

343
00:23:51,263 --> 00:24:02,198
Speaker 0: It's so high up the list It can't possibly be lower than top five on the list of anyone who's not a moron But it doesn't have everything Right, so, okay.

344
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:05,920
Speaker 0: No So let's think about the things that make a game really good.

345
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,187
Speaker 1: So competition you can have it.

346
00:24:08,227 --> 00:24:12,200
Speaker 1: you can play against another person in some direct fashion.

347
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:15,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, Super Metroid has that with like a speedrun, but mostly not.

348
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:21,197
Speaker 0: so, you know DDR You compete against the person next to you can compete against them in many different ways.

349
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:26,037
Speaker 0: score Can you even beat this song that I beat on this difficulty level?

350
00:24:26,077 --> 00:24:26,620
Speaker 0: No, you can't.

351
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:30,110
Speaker 0: Right grade maybe yeah style like.

352
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:33,320
Speaker 0: oh the people are cheering for me and not for you, right?

353
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,324
Speaker 1: There's that battle mode.

354
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:36,046
Speaker 1: that was kind of dumb.

355
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:36,768
Speaker 1: It was okay.

356
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:37,109
Speaker 0: Sure.

357
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,416
Speaker 0: So DDR has real competition.

358
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,680
Speaker 0: that like is legit.

359
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:46,911
Speaker 0: DDR also has Music and atmosphere and you know immersion and all the.

360
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:49,420
Speaker 0: you know that you think about it, you know games that have like stories.

361
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,371
Speaker 0: You know like half-life where you like get involved in it, right?

362
00:24:52,411 --> 00:24:54,580
Speaker 0: Okay, so DDR doesn't have a narrative story.

363
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:56,508
Speaker 0: It has an even better story.

364
00:24:56,568 --> 00:25:02,192
Speaker 0: DDR has a story in the way that NFL football or NHL ice hockey.

365
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:08,600
Speaker 1: has a story maybe rock band Sort of maybe right going up through the ranks as a rock star.

366
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,696
Speaker 0: It's like you get up on the DDR pad right and there's lights and there's sounds.

367
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:17,476
Speaker 0: right pumping Right, you feel like you're in the club, right?

368
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,516
Speaker 0: You get this whole immersion thing going on and then you get the story of.

369
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:27,100
Speaker 0: you know Rim was dancing that one time at the beach and those girls were asking him.

370
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:36,139
Speaker 0: You know those people behind were taking pictures or you know He beat the ridiculously hard song and the other person passed out.

371
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:41,220
Speaker 1: DDR is one of those games that people just playing it or you can draw a crowd.

372
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:52,260
Speaker 0: You went to that, you know that time that you went to You know that DJ eight ball pretended he was hurt In a crazy performance with involving the cane on the dancepad.

373
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,137
Speaker 1: We used to go searching for in the era before YouTube videos of DDR championships.

374
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,135
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would download videos.

375
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,302
Speaker 1: Still have that video of DJ eight ball Right.

376
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:05,447
Speaker 0: So DDR has his story.

377
00:26:05,507 --> 00:26:05,748
Speaker 0: It has.

378
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:10,639
Speaker 0: you know music obviously are you know, the the whole you know the.

379
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:13,450
Speaker 0: the Aesthetic aspect of it is full power.

380
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:14,655
Speaker 1: Well, so look at design, right?

381
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:21,940
Speaker 1: It's a rhythm game and These things were not well-designed up until this point like in fact, the original DDR was not well-designed.

382
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,407
Speaker 1: It took until the third or really the fourth or it was fourth mix because third still had flat arrows Exactly.

383
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:34,840
Speaker 0: fourth - sorry I mean they added features after the fourth mix, but they perfected the core of DDR in the fourth mix.

384
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,546
Speaker 0: That's where DDR became real.

385
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:40,160
Speaker 1: So the thing that matters the most is that there's a ranking system.

386
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,822
Speaker 1: Well two things.

387
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:45,219
Speaker 1: there is a ranking system a number of feet that is like a metric of how difficult the song is.

388
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:51,063
Speaker 1: Those numbers are one of the best designed ranking difficulty systems I've ever seen.

389
00:26:51,123 --> 00:27:03,860
Speaker 1: because I can I could look at a DDR song and say that's a five that's a six Yeah And that it's like rock climbing or skiing like the grades are very well-defined and mean very specific things to an expert.

390
00:27:04,342 --> 00:27:09,660
Speaker 1: So there's a very clear progression for a player and you always feel like you're progressing.

391
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:14,016
Speaker 1: And the upper end of that the upper limit of that is above 99% of players abilities.

392
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,647
Speaker 1: So you'll never hit the end.

393
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:17,249
Speaker 0: Yep.

394
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,779
Speaker 1: Like there are very few people who can hit the end of DDR.

395
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:27,038
Speaker 1: So also but the other thing the design of the game itself the way it teaches you how to play.

396
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:48,080
Speaker 1: the arrows Have a color like they're cycling color But they cycle in time with the music through these colors so that they are You know yellowish or purplish or whatever color depending on whether or not they'll be on a quarter note eighth note sixteenth note Whatever when you're supposed to step on them, so it kind of trains your brain.

397
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:49,284
Speaker 1: So you play it a lot.

398
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:53,740
Speaker 1: your brain just sees arrows and your feet just move and there is literally no thought whatsoever.

399
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's it.

400
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,145
Speaker 0: There might be like a pattern.

401
00:27:56,165 --> 00:28:04,220
Speaker 0: you're trying to figure out and you figure it out eventually and you do a little bit of conscious Thought and then once you've you know muscle memorized that you're done because DDR is also a sport.

402
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, right the first time I beat like a fast hard song and I did dropout.

403
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:14,254
Speaker 1: I fucking almost passed out Literally fell off the pad and collapsed and laid there heaving.

404
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:24,900
Speaker 0: you practice and you know You build your skills and your muscles and your muscle memory Right in the same way that you learn to throw a baseball or swim the breaststroke or anything like that.

405
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:29,818
Speaker 1: Yep Like people who are better than you and there's like this culture of no man dance it like dance that pattern like this.

406
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:36,174
Speaker 1: or now Yeah, like there's the point where you learn to twist your hips Instead of trying to step on all the things with the same foot.

407
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:40,340
Speaker 0: DDR has a community You know that has grown and shrunk over the years.

408
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:43,480
Speaker 0: But you know, it is it just naturally the way it is made.

409
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,604
Speaker 0: it builds a community.

410
00:28:44,704 --> 00:28:57,620
Speaker 0: even just there could be a community around a single machine or as DDR as a whole or Even around like just aspects of DDR like they'll be the you know People who make you know notes in step mania for other songs that aren't official.

411
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:07,560
Speaker 0: There's a community for that is you know, there's a community for you know People who are trying to just you know compete and see who can do the hardest songs in the most perfect score.

412
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:12,020
Speaker 1: I used to hang out on the DDR freak forums and I was a regular poster as well.

413
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,099
Speaker 0: Yeah a community for people who build DDR pads because buying them kind of sucks, especially now.

414
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:21,600
Speaker 1: Well considering red octane is gone, which is the only people who make good DDR pads, right?

415
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:30,829
Speaker 0: DDR also has an important aspect which many other games do not have especially not competitive games Is that it offers the ability for self-expression.

416
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:35,411
Speaker 0: if you look at a game like, you know, minecraft and minecraft You can have self-expression right?

417
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:36,560
Speaker 0: You're creating this work of art.

418
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,860
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of competition in minecraft in magic the gathering you can have self-expression.

419
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,690
Speaker 0: You sort of make your deck as an expression of yourself any sort of customizable game.

420
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:51,658
Speaker 0: netrunner offers that to write the self-expression and the competition but they don't offer the sport.

421
00:29:51,678 --> 00:29:57,600
Speaker 0: or You know the immersion with the sound pumping and the graphics and the in the crew, right?

422
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:04,444
Speaker 1: You know like those subtle moments where you turn your back on the screen and dancing facing the crowd and wink at some girl Who's watching like that's.

423
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:05,267
Speaker 1: that's fun stuff.

424
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,640
Speaker 0: DDR offers all the things at once.

425
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,054
Speaker 0: It is the only game that has ever done this that I know.

426
00:30:12,074 --> 00:30:13,380
Speaker 1: we don't get back to your competition thing.

427
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:21,991
Speaker 1: This is a game where a beginner and an expert can play against each other on the same machine Side by side at the same time with no problem and totally.

428
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:22,673
Speaker 1: both have fun.

429
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:26,990
Speaker 1: because I think we talked about this in that packs Panel - if you get two scores when you dance.

430
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,300
Speaker 1: now some things have changed between all the versions.

431
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:32,571
Speaker 1: But say I'm doing a maniac song.

432
00:30:32,611 --> 00:30:35,987
Speaker 1: it's someone we know hasn't played much is doing a basic song But we do the same song.

433
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,500
Speaker 1: we dance next to each other.

434
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,406
Speaker 1: I just have more arrows.

435
00:30:39,988 --> 00:30:43,840
Speaker 0: you get a less score will be higher because your combos are probably bigger from having more arrows.

436
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,200
Speaker 1: But the letter grades are based on how well you do relative to that level, right?

437
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:54,180
Speaker 0: If they hit every arrow perfectly and you mess up a bit You'll probably get an A and they'll get an S and they'd be like I did better.

438
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
Speaker 0: It is a you know built-in handicap like bowling in golf.

439
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:03,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game puts prominent focus on the rent like the score relative to what you are attempting in your ability.

440
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:12,264
Speaker 1: But it also gives you the like absolute score where my score is multiple orders of magnitude above yours just because you know I had a lot more arrows to hit.

441
00:31:12,826 --> 00:31:16,700
Speaker 0: and even for just something that's a rhythm game where you stomp on some plastic.

442
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:22,737
Speaker 0: right, it still has this sort of mystery and aura of secrets.

443
00:31:22,877 --> 00:31:29,439
Speaker 0: and and you know Excitement that you get from like, you know, you play Zelda 1 and you find like, you know a secret.

444
00:31:29,459 --> 00:31:32,980
Speaker 0: or You open up that eighth dungeon and the music is different.

445
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,867
Speaker 0: DDR has that too.

446
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:45,120
Speaker 0: even in the arcade songs unlock or There's different modes or if you hold down buttons You can open up the menu and get access to different settings.

447
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,301
Speaker 0: And

448
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:57,173
Speaker 1: you'd see this you just weird like when I go to a machine like when when I was when we were younger and there'd be the people like the community in the arcade and we do a song and then they get up there and Then like Scott said they like hold some buttons down and different shit would happen.

449
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:58,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, they get these weird menus.

450
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:00,360
Speaker 1: We didn't know what that was at the time.

451
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,800
Speaker 1: So we'd like watch them and then try and try to figure out what they were doing.

452
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:11,100
Speaker 0: It's like there's a lot, you know, you buy DDR at home and it's like who's that mysterious character when it still had characters?

453
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,304
Speaker 0: Boldo, right?

454
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,817
Speaker 0: It's like then you unlock the cowgirl and DDR fifth mix.

455
00:32:14,878 --> 00:32:15,300
Speaker 0: It's like whoa.

456
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,559
Speaker 0: It's like crazy shit goes down.

457
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the game I feel like it's peak in the u.s.

458
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,420
Speaker 0: Was around like early first first half of two thousand two thousand two thousand five.

459
00:32:28,641 --> 00:32:31,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, like two thousand two three was I think the biggest cuz.

460
00:32:31,114 --> 00:32:32,160
Speaker 0: that's when because it started.

461
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:39,136
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much Every hour after 2005 2006. that's when it was fading and around that time.

462
00:32:39,156 --> 00:32:39,959
Speaker 0: It's about five years.

463
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,160
Speaker 0: ish.

464
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,340
Speaker 0: The thing is DDR was so big if you meet someone right and it's like people really aren't playing DDR a lot now.

465
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,545
Speaker 0: They still are but not a lot.

466
00:32:48,887 --> 00:32:51,478
Speaker 0: but you bring DDR up and if there's a person who played it.

467
00:32:52,281 --> 00:33:00,246
Speaker 0: I'm I'm constantly shocked about how often DDR will come up and a person that we didn't know play DDR be like Oh DDR yeah.

468
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:01,571
Speaker 0: Oh, I played that.

469
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:02,655
Speaker 0: let's play right now.

470
00:33:02,675 --> 00:33:03,217
Speaker 0: We've got it.

471
00:33:03,237 --> 00:33:03,940
Speaker 0: Let's throw down.

472
00:33:04,181 --> 00:33:08,634
Speaker 1: We have repeatedly busted out the pads and a bunch of strangers start playing DDR together.

473
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:11,264
Speaker 0: and people they still got it Just like a bicycle.

474
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:14,679
Speaker 0: They don't have a full power, but they can pedal they can get up the hill.

475
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:15,743
Speaker 1: Helps that.

476
00:33:15,984 --> 00:33:22,164
Speaker 1: most of the music in DDR especially like fourth mix fifth mix six mix era is the kind of dance music I like anyway.

477
00:33:22,184 --> 00:33:24,596
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I guess there are people who don't like that music.

478
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,384
Speaker 1: music is taste But well, then they can do.

479
00:33:26,404 --> 00:33:30,900
Speaker 0: DDR has the kind of music that I will listen to even when not playing DDR.

480
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:35,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, that kind of like 90s dance pop like you're talking about best music in video games ever.

481
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:36,557
Speaker 0: It's like Mega Man 2 DDR.

482
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:39,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, Symphony of the Night is up there too.

483
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,938
Speaker 0: Sure, but it's pretty much Mega Man 2 DDR.

484
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:46,348
Speaker 0: Yeah Like the music in DDR is that good?

485
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,318
Speaker 0: I mean obviously it varies by which mix you're playing.

486
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,780
Speaker 0: right, you know It just keeps coming out with new mixes, but we played mostly in the fourth fourth plus fifth mix era.

487
00:33:55,062 --> 00:33:58,020
Speaker 0: Yep, you know and I mean that doesn't mean that the other mixes are no good.

488
00:33:58,101 --> 00:34:04,020
Speaker 0: We just haven't played them a total ton They but whenever I do go up to one and play it I can always find a good song in there.

489
00:34:04,382 --> 00:34:08,125
Speaker 0: And I'm sure if I actually played those newer mixes a whole bunch I'd find a lot of good songs.

490
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,440
Speaker 1: only trouble is they change the foot ranking system in the newer mixes.

491
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,677
Speaker 0: Good you just got to get used to it, but I don't know it at all.

492
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,630
Speaker 0: I just have trouble just a matter of not knowing.

493
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,016
Speaker 0: it's not a matter of less quality.

494
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:24,418
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, you can kind of tell what era someone came from by what they call the different difficulties.

495
00:34:25,841 --> 00:34:31,800
Speaker 1: Because remember it was basic trick maniac and then light standard heavy and then they changed it again in the X series.

496
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,045
Speaker 1: I don't know what it's called anymore.

497
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:36,719
Speaker 1: There was oni mode for a while when we used to play at that bowling alley.

498
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:41,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember the bowling at RIT that dodgy.

499
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:44,591
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone in that bowling alley liked the fact that we were there.

500
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:58,395
Speaker 1: bunch of young rowdy kids on a DDR machine surrounded by like sad 40 year olds on a league night went to that bowling alley for Bowling class as did I. I got pretty good at bowling when I took that class.

501
00:34:58,435 --> 00:35:04,242
Speaker 1: just cuz I bowled every week Yeah, then after I stopped taking the class my score went back down to sub 100.

502
00:35:04,242 --> 00:35:08,280
Speaker 0: Well, maybe if we live somewhere that at a combination laundromat bowling alley we could get better at bowling.

503
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I was I was doing like a 190 pretty like.

504
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:19,169
Speaker 1: on average I get about 180 190 without any trouble Which not great, but not terrible Wow, anyway, so yeah DDR.

505
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:31,312
Speaker 0: by any measure of things that make a game good DDR ranks very highly across the board whereas other amazing games Even if they rank amazingly, they don't do everything.

506
00:35:31,372 --> 00:35:33,480
Speaker 0: DDR is like the all-encompassing game.

507
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,183
Speaker 0: It does it all.

508
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:38,178
Speaker 1: I know a lot about the internals of old systems like how they upgraded.

509
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:46,742
Speaker 1: like, you know The arcade machine would be upgraded version to version and then like there are different versions of the hardware and these laser discs you put In and all that.

510
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:55,632
Speaker 1: but you can read a website if you care about that stuff, but the important thing The pure and true form of this game is the arcade machine.

511
00:35:55,893 --> 00:36:00,440
Speaker 1: all other forms while good are inferior in many many ways.

512
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:12,148
Speaker 1: Those pads of well-maintained in the arcade are so Perfectly sensitive like you can just stand on an arrow and shift your weight to get it to register at the right timing Like it's kind of nuts.

513
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, how well it works.

514
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:19,230
Speaker 0: You know if you play at home I mean the railing you're not supposed to hold the railing.

515
00:36:19,371 --> 00:36:23,998
Speaker 0: the railing is to keep you from falling off onto the people behind You watching you or perhaps to do a trick.

516
00:36:24,381 --> 00:36:32,614
Speaker 0: Yes, or perhaps you fall off the bar trying to do a trick and while you should not hold on to it the lack Of its presence at your home is a deficiency.

517
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:35,263
Speaker 1: also like, you know Arcade is the best.

518
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:42,248
Speaker 1: the next step down is a custom or cobalt blue hard pad Which just aren't as sturdy like.

519
00:36:42,288 --> 00:36:44,216
Speaker 1: I kind of want to see if I can buy can I?

520
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,738
Speaker 1: just I haven't thought about doing it Cuz they're heavy.

521
00:36:46,282 --> 00:36:52,987
Speaker 1: I kind of want to buy an arcade pad replacement and use an Arduino or something to hook it up and use it With USB.

522
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:54,133
Speaker 0: you go for it.

523
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,300
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about doing that.

524
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,660
Speaker 1: That's a big project though because those things are huge like bigger than my cape the table in our kitchen.

525
00:37:01,222 --> 00:37:04,195
Speaker 0: It's just really I've been looking for like, you know old DDR machines.

526
00:37:04,235 --> 00:37:05,360
Speaker 0: It's not easy to find them.

527
00:37:05,561 --> 00:37:08,720
Speaker 1: I found one like a couple months ago for about four or five thousand dollars.

528
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,048
Speaker 1: It was a fourth mix machine with.

529
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,839
Speaker 1: it looked like was in pretty good condition, too.

530
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,526
Speaker 1: But where am I gonna put it?

531
00:37:13,646 --> 00:37:15,072
Speaker 1: Scott's house the other Scott?

532
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:16,477
Speaker 0: No, Johnson.

533
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:21,360
Speaker 1: Yes He hinted that he might be willing to host a DDR machine if we bought it.

534
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,290
Speaker 0: Maybe why don't we rent one for a party?

535
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:25,100
Speaker 1: I don't even know who I'd write.

536
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,367
Speaker 1: What do are those companies that will rent?

537
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:28,811
Speaker 1: arcade machines still exist?

538
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:31,419
Speaker 0: Well, whoever who lends them to kinetic on a magfest.

539
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:31,900
Speaker 1: I don't know.

540
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:38,520
Speaker 1: Well, I know one group that does but I think they're not easy to rent for like just us and just one machine.

541
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:40,651
Speaker 1: They like to bring the whole experience as far as I can tell.

542
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,440
Speaker 0: I'm sure we can work something out.

543
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:46,989
Speaker 1: I made a hard DDR pad a long time ago Okay, and then I broke it and then I threw it away.

544
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:50,768
Speaker 1: but like I spent like a month building this thing It was kind of awesome.

545
00:37:50,788 --> 00:38:03,159
Speaker 1: Like I learned a lot about electrical stuff I used the board from a soft pad that it died to actually make it because that was basically a PlayStation one controller with a bunch of things I could solder like wires into.

546
00:38:03,966 --> 00:38:05,399
Speaker 0: You know, it's you know.

547
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:14,752
Speaker 0: If you think about the impact DDR had in its day right and on the lives of anyone who played it It might have been like the greatest life impacting game.

548
00:38:14,812 --> 00:38:15,314
Speaker 0: it's like sure.

549
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,823
Speaker 0: I probably spent more hours playing I don't know.

550
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,267
Speaker 0: maybe counter-strike might be tied.

551
00:38:19,428 --> 00:38:20,671
Speaker 0: who even knows at this point.

552
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:32,506
Speaker 0: Yeah and tribes with my tribes, but it's like DDR probably influenced and had a bigger effect on my life than any other game and I think a lot of people who were into DDR can Say the same thing.

553
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:38,533
Speaker 1: and partly because it's physical It's a different kind of skill from games like counter-strike.

554
00:38:38,794 --> 00:38:43,532
Speaker 1: You can pretty much just start Physical but but the difference is you can like.

555
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:48,992
Speaker 1: when I started playing counter-strike again when go came out I was not good like not at all.

556
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:51,120
Speaker 1: I'm still not great, but I'm not terrible anymore.

557
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,795
Speaker 1: but you can't just pick up DDR and kind of remember how to play.

558
00:38:54,835 --> 00:39:07,404
Speaker 1: then you're good to go again, I highly recommend like anyone buy The bootleg equivalent of the old red octane ignition pad the like inch thick foam core Whatever

559
00:39:07,424 --> 00:39:09,073
Speaker 0: GDR pet you can get and you that's

560
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:19,500
Speaker 1: the thin plastic ones Require a lot of nuance to work properly and I found that people who play on those Have a lot of trouble when they try to play on the arcade or a better pad.

561
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:24,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless you do crazy things like we did where we literally duct tape them to the floor semi-permanently.

562
00:39:26,221 --> 00:39:34,750
Speaker 0: There's also some DDR ish games that came out to this pump which is more popular in Korea I think which is the same thing as DDR.

563
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:41,694
Speaker 0: only instead of four arrows that are orthogonal It has five places to step one big one in the middle and four in the corners.

564
00:39:42,497 --> 00:39:43,440
Speaker 0: It's not as good.

565
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:44,988
Speaker 0: It has a few good songs.

566
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,978
Speaker 0: It's just not as good as well.

567
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,384
Speaker 1: The difference is the.

568
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:54,629
Speaker 1: the format was actually probably better in a lot of ways for like dance moves in terms of the five arrows having one of the middle.

569
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,117
Speaker 1: well the four arrows plus the middle.

570
00:39:56,258 --> 00:40:11,297
Speaker 1: but The people who made pump were not as good at making arrows that match the song and the pump songs were all kind of samey DDR at a wide variety and it took him a while like until fourth mix the arrows did not match.

571
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:22,090
Speaker 1: the song is very well No But from fourth mix on whoever it was he was designing those arrows had like they had come up with a Theoretical underpinning and the like.

572
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,623
Speaker 1: it's very telling when you play some fan made arrows Versus official ones.

573
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:28,913
Speaker 1: the official ones are professionally and expertly made.

574
00:40:28,953 --> 00:40:31,440
Speaker 1: they fit the music so perfectly.

575
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,039
Speaker 1: It's kind of amazing.

576
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:39,860
Speaker 0: And then there was in the groove which was this weird thing where it was sort of a illegal bootleg deal.

577
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,275
Speaker 1: But imagine step mania on an arcade machine, right?

578
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,386
Speaker 0: But it's like it was.

579
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:46,298
Speaker 0: it was like they made this game was just a clone of DDR.

580
00:40:46,782 --> 00:40:47,952
Speaker 0: They thought they could get away with it.

581
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:50,746
Speaker 0: I don't think they did But they had songs.

582
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,997
Speaker 0: they're like machine supremacy songs are in there.

583
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,532
Speaker 0: well cuz they Harmonics involved in this.

584
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

585
00:40:56,942 --> 00:41:10,620
Speaker 1: all I remember is when cuz that Wildwood there were a bunch of real DDR machines and a bunch of those and In my purely anecdotal experience the douchebag set of DDR players mostly played that and everyone cool play the real DDR machines.

586
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:20,960
Speaker 1: But those machines like they had harder modes and seemed to focus on like the super hardcore hit every arrow Like I'm going to master this game to the exclusion of all their game sets.

587
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:24,517
Speaker 1: And they kind of disappeared and they weren't as good in a lot of ways.

588
00:41:24,538 --> 00:41:25,522
Speaker 0: now You got a real lot.

589
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:30,540
Speaker 0: people might not know but DDR is actually just one of a series of games Konami made.

590
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:37,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, my Metal Gear con I'm in the B money series be money stands for is short way of saying beat mania be money beat man.

591
00:41:37,841 --> 00:41:39,937
Speaker 0: You know Japan likes to shorten things like that, right?

592
00:41:41,382 --> 00:41:46,540
Speaker 0: so The first game in the be money series was beat mania.

593
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,360
Speaker 0: That's the game with the little turntable and the buttons, right?

594
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:59,690
Speaker 0: And then there were also many other games in the series like para para paradise The guitar one which got copied into a guitar freaks.

595
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:03,500
Speaker 0: Yeah was the guitar one that was then ripped off to make guitar hero.

596
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:06,849
Speaker 1: None of them are as good as DD at DDR.

597
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:09,600
Speaker 0: pretty much every regard of all of those games.

598
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,120
Speaker 0: You know pop and music whatever and there's a whole bunch of new ones now these days.

599
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,259
Speaker 0: They got fancy digital crazy things and whatnot.

600
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:18,240
Speaker 0: We wave your hands around and touch screens and they're all insane.

601
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,131
Speaker 1: Well, I feel like most rhythm games today turned into.

602
00:42:21,452 --> 00:42:22,436
Speaker 1: here's a touchpad.

603
00:42:22,476 --> 00:42:27,529
Speaker 0: make swiping motions right of all of the be money and be money style games.

604
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:28,491
Speaker 0: only.

605
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:33,907
Speaker 0: DDR is a revolution none of the other ones a Dance dance revolution.

606
00:42:34,188 --> 00:42:38,671
Speaker 1: Yes, seriously, if you have never played DDR Ask your friends.

607
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:44,780
Speaker 1: if you're all gamers There's probably someone you know who's into DDR and just doesn't talk about it.

608
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:49,296
Speaker 0: Look for someone who was in high school or college in the early 2000s someone in their late 20s to mid 30s.

609
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,587
Speaker 1: They probably played DDR.

610
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:57,180
Speaker 1: And if you see him one in the arcade just play it like just go for it go nuts.

611
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:00,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, do not do not look at DDR and say man.

612
00:43:00,551 --> 00:43:01,293
Speaker 0: That is stupid.

613
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:02,076
Speaker 0: Right?

614
00:43:02,136 --> 00:43:03,139
Speaker 0: Just keep playing it.

615
00:43:03,802 --> 00:43:04,304
Speaker 1: I was there.

616
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:07,840
Speaker 1: we said that we felt that we knew it was stupid.

617
00:43:08,282 --> 00:43:08,763
Speaker 0: I know a lot.

618
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:12,759
Speaker 0: I even I still know some people who are like a verse, you know, they're like anti DDR.

619
00:43:13,201 --> 00:43:14,305
Speaker 0: They don't you know, they're not into it.

620
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:15,710
Speaker 0: It's just just let it go.

621
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:16,694
Speaker 0: Just do it.

622
00:43:16,754 --> 00:43:19,866
Speaker 1: Anyway, I Kind of want to play some DDR now.

623
00:43:20,007 --> 00:43:21,091
Speaker 0: I always want to play D here.

624
00:43:21,272 --> 00:43:23,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Pat got you ready for packs.

625
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,323
