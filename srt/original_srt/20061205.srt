1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,909
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday December 5th.

2
00:00:11,371 --> 00:00:13,740
Speaker 0: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,342 --> 00:00:21,333
Speaker 1: Tonight having finally rejoined the ranks of regular role players with the new D&D campaign We talked a bit about our experiences.

4
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:28,892
Speaker 1: coming back to the old game Let's do this Hot damn, I actually kind of did some work today.

5
00:00:29,213 --> 00:00:32,746
Speaker 1: That's unbelievable as in work That wasn't just paperwork or BS or whatever.

6
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:37,298
Speaker 1: I put I set up about a hundred thousand dollars worth of 48 port switches.

7
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:42,631
Speaker 0: I read a book today, but not the whole book about half the book.

8
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:43,794
Speaker 1: and what book?

9
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,560
Speaker 0: the second lensman book.

10
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:46,936
Speaker 1: Now you're still reading those.

11
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:48,465
Speaker 0: I see I only read the first one.

12
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,800
Speaker 0: before that I you know read comics and now I'm back to reading the second one.

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,557
Speaker 0: So anyway tomorrow I might actually do work cuz someone's coming to the office.

14
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,626
Speaker 1: Holy crap What are they gonna be doing there?

15
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:00,193
Speaker 1: They there for you or they just there?

16
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:03,707
Speaker 1: they're just there permanently No, so what are they there for?

17
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:08,848
Speaker 0: it's like the CEO and you know since it's holiday season He doesn't go into the city or whatever.

18
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:10,314
Speaker 0: So he's just gonna be coming.

19
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:13,345
Speaker 0: Yes to make like a conference call She's gonna come in and use the phone.

20
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:18,100
Speaker 1: Well, you should be dressed really nice and look like no not really now.

21
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:18,946
Speaker 1: Why not?

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,680
Speaker 0: because it's not necessary.

23
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,966
Speaker 1: Maybe you should schmooze a little bit.

24
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:25,436
Speaker 0: You realize the last time this guy showed up at the office.

25
00:01:25,456 --> 00:01:28,399
Speaker 1: He was in his pajamas All right, then forget that we still schmooze.

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, I make nice.

27
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:31,827
Speaker 0: Make sure I don't go.

28
00:01:31,847 --> 00:01:33,652
Speaker 0: Hey fuck quad go away.

29
00:01:33,812 --> 00:01:35,758
Speaker 1: Make sure the DDR pad is invisible.

30
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:37,673
Speaker 0: Yeah It doesn't matter.

31
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:37,959
Speaker 0: No one.

32
00:01:38,822 --> 00:01:40,955
Speaker 0: People have been there before while it's been sitting out.

33
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,015
Speaker 1: They don't ask They're like the fuck is this?

34
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:47,372
Speaker 0: Well, it's leaning up against the wall when I'm not using it.

35
00:01:47,412 --> 00:01:49,140
Speaker 0: So they don't really notice it.

36
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,249
Speaker 1: They probably don't know what it is.

37
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:51,520
Speaker 0: I don't know whatever.

38
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:55,719
Speaker 1: I remember trying when I worked at IBM trying to explain to people what DDR was.

39
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:57,846
Speaker 0: Well, it's funny.

40
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,515
Speaker 0: you should say that because my thing of the day is DDR related.

41
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:01,398
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

42
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, really Well, we'll have to get to that.

43
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:06,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will but first we haven't done this in a while.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,089
Speaker 1: But I'd like to do a geek back.

45
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:09,276
Speaker 1: We got some.

46
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,908
Speaker 1: oh shit I mean we get a lot of email.

47
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:13,274
Speaker 1: and to all of you who email us.

48
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:14,620
Speaker 1: Yes, we read your emails.

49
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:20,903
Speaker 1: We don't read them on the show because I'm sorry, but most of them are uninteresting or just saying something like hey You guys are awesome.

50
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:24,638
Speaker 1: I'm reading this one for a particular reason that may become apparent in short order.

51
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:31,960
Speaker 1: All right Hey guys I recently downloaded all the episodes of your podcast geek nights and I wanted to tell you that it is awesome.

52
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,963
Speaker 1: Exclamation point.

53
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:33,966
Speaker 0: you're correct.

54
00:02:34,247 --> 00:02:38,340
Speaker 1: You guys are hilarious and take away the boredom of my classes in my high school.

55
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,889
Speaker 0: Maybe you shouldn't be listening during class.

56
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,700
Speaker 1: I was about to say good job listening to stuff in class.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,679
Speaker 1: You probably wouldn't be learning anything there anyway.

58
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:51,060
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know how well is the punctuation and spelling and grammar of the email?

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,626
Speaker 1: It's mostly impeccable other than in the post script Which I just noticed.

60
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:59,798
Speaker 1: the post script is an all lowercase, but everything else is pretty good.

61
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:00,320
Speaker 0: Okay?

62
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,876
Speaker 0: Well, don't listen in English class, maybe a few times.

63
00:03:03,178 --> 00:03:06,150
Speaker 1: Yeah You see at least you know.

64
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:12,480
Speaker 1: back when we were in high school There really weren't mp3 players or portable gaming devices that weren't gigantic.

65
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,611
Speaker 0: Well, there was a Discman.

66
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:14,419
Speaker 0: was the best you could do?

67
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:21,597
Speaker 0: Yeah But they were still kind of big and you couldn't be too surreptitious man or a Gameboy color I think and that was like senior year of high school.

68
00:03:21,738 --> 00:03:24,232
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh Gameboy Pocket actually was you could do.

69
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:25,780
Speaker 0: that was the best you could possibly get.

70
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:29,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now I could sit there with a Gameboy micro and an iPod Nano.

71
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:30,663
Speaker 0: Hell.

72
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:48,756
Speaker 0: you can sit there with an iPod shuffle and some wireless like in-ear earbuds Right Bluetooth or some shit or you could have like a cell phone set on vibrate with a2dp Bluetooth stereo earbuds and yeah, yeah damn anyway you continue.

73
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:51,714
Speaker 1: so whenever I'm bored I just pop in earbud up.

74
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:56,413
Speaker 1: There we go Should have said an earbud from my iPod and turn on geek nights.

75
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,617
Speaker 1: Keep up the great work guys.

76
00:03:57,878 --> 00:03:58,240
Speaker 1: Cheers.

77
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:02,807
Speaker 1: Oh, by the way, just for the fun of it Can you spelled with a lowercase.

78
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:06,140
Speaker 1: you guys mentioned my name on the upcoming podcast?

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,780
Speaker 1: I don't know about what but maybe just say hey this guy wanted to be mentioned on the podcast.

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,823
Speaker 1: So here you go.

81
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,168
Speaker 1: I would appreciate it.

82
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:15,031
Speaker 1: It would be really cool.

83
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:15,893
Speaker 1: exclamation point.

84
00:04:16,154 --> 00:04:16,475
Speaker 1: Thanks.

85
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:20,339
Speaker 0: Oh, all right now You see why we don't do geek back so much.

86
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:27,520
Speaker 0: but Seriously, we like to get lots of emails and we like to get odios and all those sorts of things.

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
Speaker 0: You know, it seems like a lot of other podcasts even ones that have fewer listeners than we do get a lot more feedback.

88
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,083
Speaker 0: That doesn't?

89
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,006
Speaker 0: that's not really true.

90
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:41,245
Speaker 0: What's true is they just read the feedback on the air and thus Provoke more feedback.

91
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:41,667
Speaker 1: Yes.

92
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:52,680
Speaker 1: I mean when we did geek backs every day, we got probably double the email Yeah, and I'll basically tell you this most of the email we get if you don't ask a question or something.

93
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:53,563
Speaker 1: We read it.

94
00:04:53,624 --> 00:04:57,900
Speaker 1: we appreciate it, but we're not gonna respond cuz what do you say to a declaratory statement?

95
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,508
Speaker 0: Yeah, you send us an email and go you're awesome.

96
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:01,733
Speaker 0: What am I gonna?

97
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:02,557
Speaker 0: All right.

98
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:03,360
Speaker 0: Thanks, whatever.

99
00:05:03,381 --> 00:05:10,903
Speaker 1: Yeah And most of the people who ask us questions we tend to just email them back because it's usually something that really wouldn't be Appropriate on the show.

100
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,468
Speaker 1: I mean no one cares where.

101
00:05:12,508 --> 00:05:25,120
Speaker 0: if we tell some guy what anime they should watch some night Yeah, but we like to get more emails So don't hesitate to communicate with us or send us voicemails or whatever just because it won't be heard on the show.

102
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:31,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, however, if you want to be heard on the show your best bet is to send us an audio Yep, which we get none of.

103
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:32,195
Speaker 1: yeah.

104
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:32,717
Speaker 1: Yeah.

105
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:44,480
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean we got audio feedback a long time ago but we haven't in a while and I wonder why cuz I've seen that a Lot of podcasts don't get so much audio feedback and I wonder if people are just nervous about doing it or don't know how.

106
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:53,720
Speaker 0: I think it's the once we if we play It's like we had to get a few and then we have to play them and then that provokes more P. It's sort of like this, you know tidal wave kind of thing.

107
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 0: So we just need a few that we can play and then once you play some everyone else will go.

108
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:07,845
Speaker 1: Ooh, I got it in their own will start asking for things like we'll ask a question some Monday and then the next Monday We'll play a relevant way.

109
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:08,607
Speaker 1: We could do this.

110
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:10,532
Speaker 0: This sounds like a good idea.

111
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:12,517
Speaker 0: We could start some sort of new segment, right?

112
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:20,540
Speaker 0: Where we Put up like a question or a topic and you have to send in like a voicemail with a very short response.

113
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,034
Speaker 0: Relatively we don't want like 20-minute diatribes here, right?

114
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:25,379
Speaker 0: This is not your show.

115
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:29,380
Speaker 0: And then we'll play like you can't do 10 diatribe.

116
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,427
Speaker 0: We'll play the good ones and maybe we'll respond.

117
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:32,912
Speaker 0: a little pun them if they're stupid.

118
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:35,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess I'll ask right now.

119
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,346
Speaker 0: Oh, you got a question.

120
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a question.

121
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:38,739
Speaker 0: I didn't even start thinking one yet.

122
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:42,140
Speaker 1: Why don't you guys send us audio feedback?

123
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,386
Speaker 1: All right, I'll simplify it.

124
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:58,426
Speaker 1: whoever sends us it has to be less than 10 seconds, I'll put a constraint on here 30 seconds 30 seconds, whoever sends us the funniest bit of audio that you created on your own It'll be played on the show.

125
00:06:58,466 --> 00:07:07,120
Speaker 0: We'll give you mad props and we won't bleep out your name Alright, so for those of you who don't know how the wiimote works it uses Bluetooth.

126
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:14,302
Speaker 0: so that means that any and all data that goes between the wiimote and the we is Bluetooth.

127
00:07:14,803 --> 00:07:22,775
Speaker 1: yeah now a lot of people think that the sensor bar does something and we talked about this before but it's really just a Dumb piece of equipment with LEDs in it.

128
00:07:23,218 --> 00:07:29,097
Speaker 0: Yep So all that really matters is the wiimote and well a lot of other things besides the.

129
00:07:29,117 --> 00:07:30,060
Speaker 0: we use Bluetooth.

130
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:37,843
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like the wave bird that uses some proprietary wireless protocol or the DS where it uses Wi-Fi But it's all encrypted.

131
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,248
Speaker 0: so you can't do anything about it.

132
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,096
Speaker 0: You know, this is hey, there's a potential.

133
00:07:42,156 --> 00:07:43,460
Speaker 0: we can use this with a computer.

134
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:54,059
Speaker 1: So since we have or even like a Palm Pilot since we have the we sitting there right next to our Mac The first thing we thought about a day after we got the we was huh?

135
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,680
Speaker 1: These are Bluetooth, right and we tried to use them with the Mac and it showed up.

136
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,893
Speaker 0: The Mac said I see a Bluetooth device there and Scott went.

137
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:04,380
Speaker 1: Oh, this is gonna be great.

138
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:10,545
Speaker 0: But then what I didn't think I was gonna get much further and I was right when I actually tried to use it I was unsuccessful, you know the.

139
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:15,755
Speaker 0: even though the Mac recognized it as a Bluetooth device It did not a handle it at all.

140
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:28,313
Speaker 0: But however people have figured out how it works mostly and they've written drivers for Windows and Mac and You can now use your remotes with your Windows and Macintosh computers.

141
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:29,858
Speaker 0: Probably Linux computers real soon.

142
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,558
Speaker 1: now Don't think that this is super awesome yet.

143
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:49,759
Speaker 0: It's not super awesome yet because they have learned how to get data from the accelerometers So they can tell when you tilt your remote in any direction and they have learned how to get data from the button so you can push the different buttons except for the power button, of course and The computer will know when you push the buttons.

144
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,329
Speaker 0: the computer is not yet.

145
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:58,368
Speaker 0: they have not yet figured out how to get the driver to understand the Sensor bar pointing device functionality.

146
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:03,707
Speaker 0: So without that I mean, it's not really a good mouse Which is what you want to use it for?

147
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:05,497
Speaker 0: is a mouse for a TV computer.

148
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,712
Speaker 1: Yeah It's I mean it.

149
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,475
Speaker 1: once they get this working I'm sure someone will though.

150
00:09:10,617 --> 00:09:27,078
Speaker 1: frankly I think it would be an interesting idea if after this remote and nunchuck shortage is over, you know sometime next year if Nintendo got some developers and released official drivers for their remotes to be used on computers as generic peripherals.

151
00:09:27,682 --> 00:09:33,799
Speaker 0: See, I don't know if it's really necessary though for them to do that because oh no no No, it would just generate a lot of good press.

152
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:43,839
Speaker 0: I mean it it's it takes a lot of effort for them to do something like that You know and Nintendo hates to do stuff for computers because computers are not a homogeneous platform.

153
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:44,000
Speaker 0: Yeah

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,300
Speaker 1: Well, I see the one reason they might not want to is that if people start pirating Wii games And they can use the remote on the computer

155
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:59,911
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean of that if people already have their own homemade drivers to use the remote on a computer that covers 99% of the market for that sort of thing.

156
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:00,715
Speaker 1: Well, then you know what you do.

157
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:13,359
Speaker 1: you uh Make the people who are currently developing these on their own Call them like official and give them the data to do it But don't pay them anything and then when they finish it release it under your name.

158
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, considering it's it's already gotten so far.

159
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:23,600
Speaker 0: It's not really necessary Yeah, but I'm sure the people that rather have them work more on getting out more Wii channels and virtual console games.

160
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:30,940
Speaker 1: Well, you've seen all the the rumors and various grumblings on the internet that everything we care about is gonna be live by Christmas.

161
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:32,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, supposedly.

162
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:33,106
Speaker 0: I also.

163
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:39,745
Speaker 0: there was a magazine that had a blurb that was like OMG something is coming to the virtual console That's gonna change everything.

164
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,387
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

165
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,033
Speaker 1: I can't imagine what that would be.

166
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,077
Speaker 1: I don't know.

167
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:43,980
Speaker 1: I got ideas.

168
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:52,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you read the actual blurb, you know, you could get a hint that it's probably Earthbound or something like that, but who knows?

169
00:10:52,997 --> 00:11:04,548
Speaker 0: anyway I've linked to the page with the Macintosh Darwin Darwin remote Driver and program for you to use.

170
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:07,399
Speaker 0: if you have a Mac and if you have a Windows you can find it on your own.

171
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:11,896
Speaker 0: Eventually, this will hopefully support pointing and then it will be awesome.

172
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:22,932
Speaker 1: So natural selection a mod for half-life has got to be one of the Most innovative and greatest first-person shooters of the modern era.

173
00:11:23,213 --> 00:11:25,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably I mean, it's a little old hat.

174
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:25,600
Speaker 1: now.

175
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,643
Speaker 1: Technology is old.

176
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:27,626
Speaker 1: the mod is old.

177
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:32,120
Speaker 1: It doesn't look very shiny compared to anything new coming out doesn't have a lot of players anymore.

178
00:11:32,502 --> 00:11:34,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, though the people still plan are very dedicated.

179
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:35,179
Speaker 0: They're awesome.

180
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:39,409
Speaker 1: I mean in its heyday It was one of the big greats of gaming.

181
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:47,961
Speaker 1: it still very few games have come to even close in my eyes To replicating or even matching the sheer level of fun and amazingness That was.

182
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:55,319
Speaker 0: natural selection and natural selection is a half-life 1 mod that didn't come out until like right before Half-life 2 came out.

183
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:03,693
Speaker 0: It was like half-life 1 was almost dead half-life 2 was coming soon and here comes a brand new Half-life 1 mod that knocks your socks off.

184
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:04,498
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell?

185
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:08,600
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean once it came out and was stable it exploded in popularity.

186
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:17,660
Speaker 1: Now natural selection 2 for the half-life 2, you know source engine has been in the works for a long time.

187
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've had some issues with that.

188
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,020
Speaker 0: They keep changing what their plans are and you know all kinds of stuff.

189
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,902
Speaker 0: They even made a sudoku game and they sold it in order to make money to develop natural selection - but they are working On it.

190
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:37,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the good news is that not only they're still working on it But they seem to have kept sight of the true vision of what NS is.

191
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:48,470
Speaker 1: a lot of times when people make a mod like action quake was a really good thing and then they tried to make action quake like the next version for Quake 3 and it just kind of was crap.

192
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:51,780
Speaker 1: weapons factory at the same thing weapons factory for quake 2 was awesome.

193
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,428
Speaker 1: They tried to make a new version.

194
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,720
Speaker 1: They got all the right things wrong.

195
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,311
Speaker 1: No, they got all the wrong things right and the right things wrong.

196
00:12:58,713 --> 00:12:58,914
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:12:59,336 --> 00:12:59,677
Speaker 1: Yeah.

198
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:02,356
Speaker 1: Yeah That kind of makes sense.

199
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:10,000
Speaker 1: Natural selection the team behind it unknown worlds entertainment really seemed to know what made natural selection good.

200
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,218
Speaker 0: What's that guy's name?

201
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,590
Speaker 0: Flaira, isn't that the head guy?

202
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,273
Speaker 1: I think so.

203
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:14,796
Speaker 1: He's one of them.

204
00:13:14,897 --> 00:13:17,186
Speaker 1: He's awesome Yeah But they really like.

205
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:19,900
Speaker 1: they the things they would change and the things they would work on.

206
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:38,294
Speaker 1: They knew what the people playing natural selection wanted and more importantly They knew what they really wanted because a lot of times fan communities will ask for things that they think they want but they don't really and if the developer listens to them you get the tribes to Situation where they take one of the best games ever made and run it straight into the fucking ground.

207
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:43,027
Speaker 0: Here's a good example, right in in tribes two people wanted.

208
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:50,595
Speaker 0: they wanted like to automatically get in the vehicles and other crap like that and They wanted what was that other stupid thing?

209
00:13:50,615 --> 00:13:52,287
Speaker 1: Oh god I forget.

210
00:13:52,449 --> 00:14:03,752
Speaker 0: they wanted to like Change some weapon or something and they did and it totally ruined the game and changed everything, you know Meanwhile in natural selection, what are those little guys that you had in the early versions?

211
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:04,855
Speaker 0: that you the know?

212
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:09,730
Speaker 0: the creatures the babblers The babblers in the early versions of natural selection.

213
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,040
Speaker 0: One of the alien abilities is these babblers and they were hilarious.

214
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:16,079
Speaker 1: Yes, they were one of my favorite things in NS.

215
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:24,609
Speaker 1: basically you could spawn little tiny aliens that were kind of like skulks that would run off and attack Marines but They weren't that bright and they were kind of buggy.

216
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:30,388
Speaker 1: and there were situations where you'd send off a babbler It would get stuck in you and then kill you.

217
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:33,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, or it would attack your own hive until it killed it.

218
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:40,440
Speaker 0: Yep, you know and everybody took the babblers out of the game and everyone said oh man bring back the babblers.

219
00:14:40,882 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: Babblers and people today's probably still talk about the babblers that used to be a natural selection.

220
00:14:45,963 --> 00:14:52,518
Speaker 0: But they even though a lot of people say they want them back These guys know that they really don't make a good game and they've kept them out.

221
00:14:53,415 --> 00:15:06,406
Speaker 1: Yep Now recently that they've really have opened their kimono in their own core their own words to release one of the cool things They're working on as part of natural selection - they call it dynamic Infestation.

222
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:14,512
Speaker 1: now in natural selection you know areas of the map that were near hive locations or areas where the aliens tended to start or be powerful through.

223
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:18,785
Speaker 1: much of a game had a very Alien esque vibe to them.

224
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:32,499
Speaker 1: there was organic shit growing all over the walls and weird sounds and weird plants and like throbbing pulsing Geiger looking kind of things all over the place and that kind of tapered off as you got to the more civilized areas where the Marines would start.

225
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:35,108
Speaker 1: Now this was entirely static.

226
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:42,149
Speaker 1: no matter who was winning no matter what was going on nothing changed other than you know A hive appearing or a gorge building an offense tower somewhere.

227
00:15:42,771 --> 00:16:00,980
Speaker 1: in natural selection - they've come up with a method of having this infestation kind of grow organically and naturally procedurally in real time While the game is progressing based on how well the aliens are doing how widespread they are What areas they occupy and possibly what buildings they have built?

228
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:07,818
Speaker 0: Wow, so if the Marines take over the whole map and the game's over there isn't gonna be any yellow alien gunk around?

229
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:08,840
Speaker 0: most likely Yeah.

230
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:17,104
Speaker 0: And if the aliens like start encroaching on like a new area of the map like yellow shit will start growing everywhere and go blurbity blurbity Blurbity blurbity.

231
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:18,691
Speaker 1: now they haven't figured out.

232
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:23,040
Speaker 1: I mean they figured out how to do it and It's if you've read the article is really kind of cool.

233
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:31,039
Speaker 1: They talk a lot about it But they haven't figured out exactly how to use it yet because one it adds a lot of nice ambience to the game And I think it'd be really cool on its own.

234
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:35,100
Speaker 1: But I can also see this having significant gameplay factors.

235
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:46,900
Speaker 1: They haven't said anything but I imagine maybe like skulks or lurks are a little camouflaged in alien infested areas Or maybe the more infested an area is the more resistant aliens are to damage.

236
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,725
Speaker 0: Well, they did say.

237
00:16:47,947 --> 00:17:07,398
Speaker 0: one gameplay factor was that you know Let's say you have a room with some computers in it or something right and the infestation Room then like the computers that get all infested and stop working and like the lights will go out in that room and then if The Marines come and clean it up then you know The computers will start working again and the lights will turn back on and shit like that.

238
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, the possibilities are endless and I am all about this.

239
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:13,957
Speaker 1: and one astute person on dig made a quote.

240
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:20,273
Speaker 1: I'll paraphrase if Dynamic infestation can somehow be fought with flamethrowers.

241
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:22,040
Speaker 1: I think I'm going to wet myself.

242
00:17:23,203 --> 00:17:24,108
Speaker 0: That sounds good to me.

243
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:25,560
Speaker 1: I want to see a flamethrower.

244
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,545
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

245
00:17:27,665 --> 00:17:34,555
Speaker 0: and as doesn't really have a flamethrower yet The flamethrower is a key weapon in alien aliens alien three, etc.

246
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:34,956
Speaker 0: Etc.

247
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:35,639
Speaker 1: Well, I could see them.

248
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:43,440
Speaker 1: using it like a flamethrower would probably be good against infestation and gorgeous and structures and be absolutely useless against anything else.

249
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:49,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think oh no Fade is gonna be phased by flame.

250
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:50,960
Speaker 1: You can't kill 10 fade.

251
00:17:52,662 --> 00:18:03,468
Speaker 1: Oh Man I'm having natural selection flashbacks because Scott and I would always play in the same room next to each other sometimes on the same team sometimes not.

252
00:18:03,488 --> 00:18:16,379
Speaker 1: it didn't matter because we never really cheated or anything, but I Remember there would be times where I'd be walking around my little machine gun and Scott be walking around somewhere else and suddenly he yells Fade fuck and then he dies and then I go oh then I die.

253
00:18:18,036 --> 00:18:27,750
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, Oh knows Things of the day.

254
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:33,103
Speaker 1: You can't have think 10 10 things of the day.

255
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:37,241
Speaker 0: we've had like 200 400 something things of the dance.

256
00:18:37,523 --> 00:18:39,532
Speaker 1: We can't have 10.

257
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:45,890
Speaker 1: All right, then more than 10 is just as not 10 is less than 10 is I suppose that's technically correct?

258
00:18:46,371 --> 00:18:51,565
Speaker 1: Anyway, my thing of the day now when I was a kid, but play video games.

259
00:18:52,207 --> 00:19:02,232
Speaker 1: I would often be Fascinated by glitches or bonus areas or strange things or busted stuff in video games like in Castlevania.

260
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:08,456
Speaker 1: one time Castlevania 2 my favorite Castlevania game with the possible exception of Castlevania DS I was wandering around.

261
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,921
Speaker 1: I ended up glitching the game.

262
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,165
Speaker 0: Yes - comes out this week.

263
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:13,548
Speaker 1: I'm well aware All right.

264
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:17,250
Speaker 1: So much for my money situation in my free time situation.

265
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:33,452
Speaker 1: But anyway and I would I discovered an area that I shouldn't have been able to get to near the top of one of the Manners and in this area there was nothing but dead bodies hanging from the ceiling and a really creepy lake that you really couldn't get Past.

266
00:19:33,512 --> 00:19:38,490
Speaker 0: if it's on top of a manor, how can a dead body hang from the ceiling if it's a sky?

267
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:48,730
Speaker 1: Well, no like the top level of the manor okay in a place that you shouldn't have been able to get to and it went on forever and There were all sorts of things where you could holy water in the wrong place and fall into a spot.

268
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,110
Speaker 1: You shouldn't have gotten to where there's creepy shit down there.

269
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:55,634
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of games have this stuff and when I was a kid, it used to be kind of this Mr.

270
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,809
Speaker 0: Don't seem to have it anymore.

271
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:01,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, now games have things like Princess Peach's mysterious third eye.

272
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:04,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, it pretty much stopped with the the SNES.

273
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:10,484
Speaker 0: I mean The SNES really didn't have any glitchy action like that on the GameCube.

274
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:12,150
Speaker 0: There was a little bit of glitchy.

275
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,358
Speaker 0: I mean not the GameCube the N64.

276
00:20:14,598 --> 00:20:20,310
Speaker 0: there was a little bit of glitchy action going on in some games, but Nowadays, no, it just doesn't really happen anymore.

277
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:35,249
Speaker 1: well if you ever wondered why the glitches in old NES games are Often so much more interesting or strange or inexplicable than the glitches you get now Which generally seem to be resigned to deleting your save data or preventing you from beating the game?

278
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:58,570
Speaker 1: back in the day games were designed very differently for a number of reasons and My thing of the day is a cool little bit written by snow, bro explaining exactly how Metroid works how the level data was saved how it was accessed and why all the different kinds of glitches you could run into and Strange areas you could gain access to existed.

279
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:12,990
Speaker 0: It's actually really interesting because it shows you you know nowadays if you want to program something your computer is is so powerful that you Just write an object-oriented program And you don't have to really think about a lot of things that used to cause programmers trouble.

280
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:15,750
Speaker 0: But back in the day you had very few resources.

281
00:21:15,951 --> 00:21:21,949
Speaker 0: You had to do all sorts of tricks and think really hard about how to get the most out of very little.

282
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,330
Speaker 0: you know.

283
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,505
Speaker 0: It's sort of like oh, I want to make a car.

284
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:28,202
Speaker 0: well good thing I have this car factory with robots in it you know.

285
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:30,230
Speaker 0: but back in the day was I want to make a car.

286
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:30,893
Speaker 0: Oh great.

287
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:34,569
Speaker 0: I've got ten popsicle sticks and somehow you managed to make a car.

288
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:35,950
Speaker 0: This is a good.

289
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,484
Speaker 0: This is a good thing to show you just how kind of thinking that they use to make that happen.

290
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:49,724
Speaker 1: and it's non technical enough To where you could easily even if you don't know much about programming or computers Understand where they're going with this at least grasp the basics.

291
00:21:49,785 --> 00:21:50,609
Speaker 1: It's a really good read.

292
00:21:52,752 --> 00:21:54,078
Speaker 0: So is a combination.

293
00:21:54,198 --> 00:22:03,530
Speaker 0: my thing of the day is it's sort of like a news actually But one thing I hate and one thing I love have combined and therefore I must inform the world.

294
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:04,948
Speaker 0: What do I hate?

295
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:05,932
Speaker 1: Ninjas?

296
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:08,219
Speaker 0: well, no yeah, I don't hate ninja.

297
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:08,460
Speaker 0: Well.

298
00:22:09,242 --> 00:22:10,747
Speaker 0: I'm just I'm just a pirate fan.

299
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:17,570
Speaker 0: I'm not really anti ninja Yeah, but I really really don't like Burger King or any other fast food for that matter.

300
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,970
Speaker 0: I eat it as not often as possible for many reasons.

301
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:27,812
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were forced at sitcom to eat some Wendy's one night because there was nothing else open Anywhere.

302
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:31,924
Speaker 0: yeah before that the time I ate fast food was like months and months and months.

303
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:34,754
Speaker 0: before that I did an Arby's once and That they you know.

304
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:36,121
Speaker 0: before then I don't even remember.

305
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:40,320
Speaker 1: see I frequently eat at White Castle But I consider that to be a whole different brand of food.

306
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,481
Speaker 1: Well.

307
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:41,525
Speaker 0: You're crazy anyway.

308
00:22:42,007 --> 00:22:44,878
Speaker 0: Burger King I don't know if it's right now or real soon.

309
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,990
Speaker 0: It's gonna have dance dance revolution toys.

310
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:52,930
Speaker 0: Yes, you heard right if you go to Burger King you can get DDR toys.

311
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:57,881
Speaker 0: Some of them look pretty stupid But some of them look pretty awesome.

312
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:15,985
Speaker 1: if I were a betting man I would bet that the primary reason Burger King is doing this is to stave off any Question of lawsuits by fat people against them in the future because they will be able to look point back at things like this and say Look we promoted health at every opportunity.

313
00:23:16,246 --> 00:23:17,110
Speaker 1: It's not our fault.

314
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,010
Speaker 1: You didn't read the menu with all the caloric information that we put on the wall.

315
00:23:21,331 --> 00:23:21,954
Speaker 1: It's not our fault.

316
00:23:21,994 --> 00:23:23,279
Speaker 1: He ate a thousand french fries.

317
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:24,966
Speaker 1: We told people to play DDR.

318
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,729
Speaker 0: if they don't It could be something like that.

319
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:41,970
Speaker 0: I mean if you go to the website for the official website of the DDR Burger King You know one of the links is fitness And you know they tell you hey DDR helps you stay fit play it blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

320
00:23:42,793 --> 00:23:45,988
Speaker 0: Drink water before after before during and after playing DDR.

321
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:48,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty funny.

322
00:23:49,393 --> 00:23:54,572
Speaker 0: But one of the toys I think the best toy is a little is Baldo or Whatever.

323
00:23:54,592 --> 00:24:00,129
Speaker 0: you want to call him the afro guy and you can like push buttons to make him dance a little bit.

324
00:24:00,893 --> 00:24:03,049
Speaker 1: Maybe you might have to go to Burger King just to get one of these.

325
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:13,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only other toy that seems to be worth getting is not really a toy, but a CD full of DDR screen savers wallpapers and Stickers and such stickers.

326
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:16,050
Speaker 0: you say yes stickers of arrows, huh?

327
00:24:17,452 --> 00:24:18,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty cool.

328
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,670
Speaker 0: I might actually go to a Burger King walk in and just say I want the toy.

329
00:24:22,731 --> 00:24:24,398
Speaker 1: So this weekend this past weekend.

330
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:27,190
Speaker 1: We did something that we haven't done in a long time.

331
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,889
Speaker 1: We played Dungeons and Dragons.

332
00:24:30,712 --> 00:24:40,269
Speaker 1: See we used to play it on a very regular basis in college and before then at least I used to play it on an even More regular basis in high school and even before then in middle school.

333
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:49,709
Speaker 1: I didn't play it that early, but I've been playing it Yeah, and we hadn't ever since we moved out of our IT and pretty much when I graduated and left.

334
00:24:49,729 --> 00:25:06,549
Speaker 1: I Really miss D&D a lot and I missed it pretty much non-stop until due to sheer force of will we have convinced most of our friends for one reason or another to move into our general vicinity and Now we can get together on a regular basis and play Dungeons and Dragons again.

335
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:15,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, D&D is one of those things where you really want to do it and when you actually do it It's kind of special just because it takes preparation.

336
00:25:15,371 --> 00:25:18,590
Speaker 0: Like if you have four people together, you can just whip out a board game and play.

337
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:23,665
Speaker 0: But if you have four people and you want to play D&D, oh, well, you have to have characters prepared.

338
00:25:23,705 --> 00:25:25,290
Speaker 0: the DM has to prepare.

339
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:27,217
Speaker 0: It's like this big.

340
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:30,830
Speaker 0: it's a whole lot of trouble to do but it's like this huge reward.

341
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:34,463
Speaker 0: So it you don't do it often and when you do, it's awesome

342
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:47,650
Speaker 1: except in college when you play constantly yeah, yeah, but pretty much being in the real world with jobs and such and Especially early on when our friends were still in college or moved all over the place and didn't live near us right away It was hard to play.

343
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:54,447
Speaker 1: So now I mean everyone lives close enough to hang out on weekends and like Alex actually lives right here Like right down the street a bit.

344
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:57,358
Speaker 1: But playing D&D now serves two purposes.

345
00:25:57,418 --> 00:26:01,270
Speaker 1: before we played D&D just as a thing to do we all lived in the same place.

346
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,970
Speaker 1: We just would go over to mine and Scott's apartment to play D&D every weekend.

347
00:26:06,613 --> 00:26:09,829
Speaker 1: Now we play D&D and it's also in addition to playing D&D.

348
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,264
Speaker 1: It's a gathering of friends and a party all rolled into one.

349
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:14,530
Speaker 1: It's like triple threat.

350
00:26:15,315 --> 00:26:24,141
Speaker 0: It's like if you're gonna do this big old D&D game Well, everyone's gonna come over and give it everything they've got, you know, you can't let it go to waste or else What's the point?

351
00:26:24,447 --> 00:26:36,806
Speaker 1: Yep I mean I think our eventual plan will be and most people will show up Friday night and we'll start partying and hanging out Saturday all day we'll play D&D and then Sunday we'll muck about for the rest of the day.

352
00:26:36,826 --> 00:26:44,318
Speaker 1: Oh, right Though I gotta say it was really interesting to be playing D&D again I mean after having not played for so long.

353
00:26:44,458 --> 00:26:57,828
Speaker 1: a few people expressed that they wondered if they were out of touch or if they Remembered how it went or if they would still enjoy it and I think the overwhelming consensus was that yes It is equally awesome to all the D&D we've ever played before if not better.

354
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:03,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is I didn't really prepare as much as everyone else did we noticed.

355
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:07,605
Speaker 1: Yeah Scott made a con man partly because I told him to make a con man.

356
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,750
Speaker 1: He didn't have anything better to do.

357
00:27:08,951 --> 00:27:09,780
Speaker 0: It was a good idea.

358
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:10,689
Speaker 1: It was a good idea.

359
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:19,710
Speaker 1: But then right away he tries to con some people and the con starts out pretty good And then he totally bollocks it up and almost got executed.

360
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:30,569
Speaker 0: you know, I think that one of the problem twice one of the fundamental problems the Dungeons & Dragons and and any RPG in which you have Very powerful characters or anything like that.

361
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:41,487
Speaker 0: You know is your character knows more than you usually is Stronger than you has more powers than you and some of that you can handle and some of it you can't.

362
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:42,570
Speaker 0: usually the knowing.

363
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:54,970
Speaker 1: See now that's easily mitigated because what you do in that situation, especially if you have a profession or craft or knowledge Skill related or if you have a reason to say my character would know this.

364
00:27:55,474 --> 00:28:06,558
Speaker 1: I just don't like say, you know Your character would know the name of the capital city of the nation you're in but you don't personally know it because you didn't bother reading the wiki or the Manual before you started playing.

365
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,810
Speaker 1: it's perfectly within the realm just as the DM.

366
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,716
Speaker 1: What's the name of the blah?

367
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:11,560
Speaker 1: I should know this.

368
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:17,470
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah or with a knowledge skill It's well you make a knowledge roll and you'll find out whether or not you knew that or not.

369
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,850
Speaker 1: And if you knew it then you get all the information out of character and you can use it as you wish in character.

370
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,710
Speaker 0: Yep, however, it does disrupt the game a little bit when you're like me and you didn't read any of it.

371
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,450
Speaker 0: You're just constantly asking and confirming the DM like every two seconds.

372
00:28:30,591 --> 00:28:35,128
Speaker 0: It's much better if you study it and actually know it and then can roleplay it much better.

373
00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:36,092
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, that's all.

374
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:49,250
Speaker 1: my philosophy has always been to learn the entirety of whatever campaign setting I'm working in at least insofar as my character would know and to pointedly not read about things I don't know about or wouldn't know about to make it easier to roleplay.

375
00:28:49,972 --> 00:29:03,085
Speaker 1: I mean I played mostly most of the D&D I've ever played in the Forgotten Realms setting just because Everyone knew it well to the point that people could just name off geography or they knew who major people were.

376
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:13,290
Speaker 1: they understood the gods and the pantheon in the world and the political situation and The DM and the players both did not have to bother with no fleshing any of that out because it was already there.

377
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:18,570
Speaker 1: We didn't have to focus on learning, you know, what this nation is like or what these things are like.

378
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,469
Speaker 1: We just played our characters in the world as though it was a world our characters lived in.

379
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:30,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's kind of scary to see that you know more about this fantasy world than the real world except I don't I know a lot more about the real world.

380
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:32,795
Speaker 1: No, there are people.

381
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,180
Speaker 1: there are people got that.

382
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like I don't want to be one of those people.

383
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:42,090
Speaker 0: So I end up like not knowing anything about fantasy world, but you don't know anything about the real world either.

384
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:43,257
Speaker 0: I know plenty of stuff.

385
00:29:43,277 --> 00:29:46,809
Speaker 1: I Got some old examples.

386
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:51,650
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, but I mean your con was ludicrous.

387
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:53,416
Speaker 1: He basically shang.

388
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,924
Speaker 0: I don't think the thing I really messed up was two numbers.

389
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:05,810
Speaker 0: if I would have changed the number 200 silver to some other number I mean, oh and if I would have changed the number free to some other number my con would have worked great.

390
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:11,517
Speaker 1: well, the problem was when you said 200 silver and Everyone in the room 11 people go.

391
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,066
Speaker 1: what the fuck's wrong with you Scott.

392
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:19,406
Speaker 1: out of character I think it would have been acceptable to say should I have picked a different number?

393
00:30:19,427 --> 00:30:22,517
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you know hindsight is 20 20.

394
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:26,890
Speaker 1: remember now that because one thing that's really influenced our style of D&D play.

395
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:48,070
Speaker 1: well two things have influenced our style of play now but the most important thing is that Many of us have played burning wheel or at least know about burning wheel and we have integrated Many of the concepts and ideas both of burning wheel and of Luke Crane himself and just his opinions on how gaming should be done Into D&D and it seems very easy in Dungeons & Dragons.

396
00:30:48,211 --> 00:30:58,769
Speaker 1: One of the things along with this is to have the in character conversation and the out of character metagaming Simultaneous in order to make the actual scenario the characters are playing out work.

397
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:03,890
Speaker 1: It's well, I think it's perfectly okay to step out of character and confirm details as you go.

398
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,549
Speaker 1: So the plot just makes sense.

399
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:14,030
Speaker 1: Yeah Because playing it out is one thing but once the moment is done and you've moved on to something else People don't think back and remember the metagame stuff.

400
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:21,389
Speaker 1: They think back and remember what actually happened in game and all the meta stuff kind of fades away And all you're left with is the memory of the story.

401
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:43,184
Speaker 0: I think what I learned in the most recent D&D playing is that to have awesome role-playing see at first I was trying to take the advice of make a guy who screws up Yeah, I was trying to like not do well like at one point like I could have tried to do something to get out of a situation but I just said I screw it let it go.

402
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:46,358
Speaker 0: Let's go down the shitter You know and it worked out.

403
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:51,640
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess I'm still alive But yeah due to a deus ex machina.

404
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but eventually like not succeeding at anything.

405
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:58,710
Speaker 0: It kind of got me in a rut and I'm like, okay, this really isn't going well.

406
00:32:00,572 --> 00:32:13,324
Speaker 0: So then, you know Alex, I think he learned one thing from Luke Crane is at one point he was like I was just like and he He must have remembered what Luke Crane said and he said what do you want?

407
00:32:13,826 --> 00:32:15,691
Speaker 0: and I'm like, oh shit Oh, it was.

408
00:32:15,711 --> 00:32:23,810
Speaker 1: there was a situation where Scott's character and Scojo's and Jess's characters were arguing about something and Scojo and Jess had a very clear goal.

409
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:34,450
Speaker 1: they intended to talk to Scott this con man in order to get in on the black market in this area and Scott was role-playing very well, but for what he was doing.

410
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,095
Speaker 1: but you didn't.

411
00:32:35,237 --> 00:32:46,930
Speaker 1: you didn't really have a Motivation like there was no specific goal and as a result the conversation was continuing and the characters were talking in character But it wasn't going anywhere and resolution was nowhere in sight.

412
00:32:47,451 --> 00:32:50,179
Speaker 1: So Alex implemented the alright state.

413
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,282
Speaker 1: what you're after.

414
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:52,505
Speaker 1: What is your goal?

415
00:32:52,866 --> 00:32:54,290
Speaker 1: do things to achieve that goal?

416
00:32:54,551 --> 00:32:57,206
Speaker 1: And if everyone does that the situation will resolve itself quickly.

417
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:07,890
Speaker 0: Yep I think what I'm gonna do for now on is just whenever I'm playing first of all I'm gonna prepare some for next time and second of all when I'm playing I'm just gonna constantly think what do I want?

418
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:08,652
Speaker 0: What do I want?

419
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:14,236
Speaker 0: What do I whenever I have a turn whenever it's my turn to act or say something Whatever it is that I want.

420
00:33:14,277 --> 00:33:16,587
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go for a hundred percent and see what happens.

421
00:33:17,009 --> 00:33:26,403
Speaker 1: Yep That's something I really got to try to do better too since it's been a while since I've role-played and I'm playing a character That I think is somewhat different from what I usually play.

422
00:33:26,744 --> 00:33:27,206
Speaker 0: No kidding.

423
00:33:27,226 --> 00:33:36,556
Speaker 0: Let's see not elf Not a fob Not aloof, yeah Not whimsical.

424
00:33:36,857 --> 00:33:43,210
Speaker 1: Yep, kind of nice not feminine In fact, he's the epitome of Roman masculinity.

425
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:50,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, except I wrote his history But I didn't really flesh out his motivation very much and I still am not sure about his beliefs.

426
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,883
Speaker 1: We'll talk about beliefs in a minute.

427
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:52,146
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

428
00:33:52,671 --> 00:34:00,770
Speaker 1: So now that we've played one session I think everyone is going to kind of rework their characters subtly in order to make the game more cohesive.

429
00:34:01,332 --> 00:34:10,389
Speaker 1: I mean everyone realize well this part of my character works and this part doesn't but if I make this Aspect this way then it'll fit better with this party and then things will progress better and all sorts of stuff.

430
00:34:10,952 --> 00:34:12,638
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I see no problem with.

431
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:13,862
Speaker 0: I mean it's our game.

432
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:14,666
Speaker 0: We're playing.

433
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:15,710
Speaker 0: we could do whatever we want.

434
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:19,909
Speaker 0: So who's to say I can't change this and that and the other thing if it makes the game better?

435
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:26,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean a lot of thing people are hesitant to do is to like do certain things because you know It is a. it's like it.

436
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:29,750
Speaker 0: it's weird because like if you're in Puerto Rico you play in Puerto Rico.

437
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,440
Speaker 0: You can't just be like, oh, I'll change this.

438
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:32,185
Speaker 0: everyone agrees.

439
00:34:32,225 --> 00:34:33,050
Speaker 0: It makes the game better.

440
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,384
Speaker 0: Well, though you can't really do that because the game has rules and you don't want to go against them.

441
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:37,308
Speaker 0: put in D&D.

442
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:41,228
Speaker 0: It's not a game of winning and losing so, you know or any other RPG.

443
00:34:41,451 --> 00:34:52,418
Speaker 0: So do whatever the hell you want as long as you know It's not just you saying my fireball should do 10 deep 12s of damage not 46 and everyone else going.

444
00:34:52,478 --> 00:34:55,501
Speaker 0: no You go for it.

445
00:34:55,581 --> 00:34:56,789
Speaker 0: change whatever you want.

446
00:34:57,311 --> 00:35:03,609
Speaker 1: Now we considered using burning wheel to play this game and we're beginning to feel like we could.

447
00:35:03,629 --> 00:35:04,593
Speaker 1: well Here's the thing.

448
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:11,530
Speaker 1: burning wheel is great and I really like it and I want to use it But not everyone is intimately aware of the details of it yet.

449
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:22,110
Speaker 1: And if we use burning wheel for the this specific game We would spend at least because we're only playing once a month here in order to ensure that everyone can travel to make every game.

450
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:32,322
Speaker 1: Yeah we would at least for the first several months be bogged down a lot by not everyone knowing all the rules and Confusion and all sorts of things that are going to be fun.

451
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:34,450
Speaker 1: and we're going to do this with burning wheel anyway.

452
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:38,765
Speaker 1: But I don't want that to detract from the purity of the the actual campaign.

453
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,176
Speaker 1: because I want to play D&D I want to roleplay a lot.

454
00:35:41,377 --> 00:35:43,348
Speaker 1: I don't want anything to get in my way of that right now.

455
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:48,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we should do is like slowly transition from one to the other.

456
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,313
Speaker 1: well see the reason I would say we shouldn't is that to Burning wheel.

457
00:35:51,333 --> 00:36:02,281
Speaker 1: the one thing it doesn't do very well is the D&D style of high magic Super-powerful people wandering about creating mischief.

458
00:36:02,722 --> 00:36:02,983
Speaker 0: Nope.

459
00:36:03,063 --> 00:36:05,550
Speaker 0: It doesn't do that because there's basically no high magic.

460
00:36:05,751 --> 00:36:08,365
Speaker 1: It's much more a. I think it's a better system.

461
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:11,898
Speaker 1: It just doesn't suit Straight up D&D in a magical world.

462
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:27,889
Speaker 1: So I think D&D especially since everyone knows D&D and more importantly because Alex has implemented several reforms both from some from Internal sources and from burning wheel that I think are making our D&D experience a lot better than it are otherwise would be.

463
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:30,057
Speaker 1: I Think D&D is a good fit for this game.

464
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,484
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so.

465
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:32,570
Speaker 0: It's working out.

466
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:37,767
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean we started off with a doing really good stuff and then everyone sort of faded.

467
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:41,390
Speaker 0: after a few hours You know the the steam really kind of died down.

468
00:36:41,537 --> 00:36:50,644
Speaker 1: Yeah Part of it was that it was Sunday and that everyone kind of realized that they needed to tweak their characters a little bit Mm-hmm, and it was the first time playing in a while and some people weren't.

469
00:36:50,684 --> 00:36:53,789
Speaker 1: I mean some people haven't played a lot of D&D In the group and they're still kind of getting the hang of it.

470
00:36:54,272 --> 00:37:01,063
Speaker 0: It's weird like back in the day used to just be able to play D&D Non-stop forever as long as I kept getting food now.

471
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,070
Speaker 0: It's like I can't play it that long.

472
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:15,185
Speaker 1: I think we'll be able to once the game gets going once everyone really is in character and really knows exactly What their characters about and once everyone knows everyone else's characters on a first name basis.

473
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was where it's like.

474
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:17,805
Speaker 0: What's his name again?

475
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,009
Speaker 0: What's that guy's name again?

476
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,161
Speaker 1: That's always what happens in a in a D&D campaign.

477
00:37:22,221 --> 00:37:23,566
Speaker 1: for the first several sessions.

478
00:37:23,606 --> 00:37:25,514
Speaker 1: until everything kind of clicks Everyone gets used to it.

479
00:37:25,654 --> 00:37:28,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also really there's a lot of players in this game.

480
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:31,818
Speaker 1: Yeah It's the largest long-term D&D game I've ever been in.

481
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,447
Speaker 0: We'll see if everyone sticks with it.

482
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:39,025
Speaker 1: so far No one seems disinterested and everyone is very excited about.

483
00:37:39,045 --> 00:37:40,270
Speaker 0: yeah, that was not my prediction.

484
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,928
Speaker 0: My prediction is you know, everyone would show up early on and then people would kind of fade away.

485
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:45,330
Speaker 0: We'll see.

486
00:37:45,913 --> 00:37:51,703
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even though people faded away near the end of the session One of the first things off everyone's lips was that was great.

487
00:37:52,225 --> 00:37:53,310
Speaker 1: Let's schedule the next one.

488
00:37:53,755 --> 00:37:54,888
Speaker 1: I want to do this next time.

489
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:58,040
Speaker 1: Mmm, I guess what we should do before we close cuz.

490
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,784
Speaker 1: I don't want to go super long in this episode by any stretch and Actually, we've already gone fairly long.

491
00:38:02,804 --> 00:38:03,449
Speaker 1: We can go longer.

492
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:04,876
Speaker 1: Dungeons & Dragons.

493
00:38:04,896 --> 00:38:08,170
Speaker 1: we've complained a lot about how third edition is kind of an annoying system.

494
00:38:08,732 --> 00:38:20,810
Speaker 1: We have mitigated this significantly and I think we should go over the things we have Implemented in this game that seemed that at least seemed to be or hopefully will make D&D a better role-playing experience.

495
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,777
Speaker 1: All right, I mean first.

496
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:26,410
Speaker 1: Alex implemented burning wheel style beliefs, which is key.

497
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:28,150
Speaker 0: Well, it's not like you know.

498
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,470
Speaker 0: Your beliefs are actually a game element with rules about them like it isn't burning wheel.

499
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,153
Speaker 0: but he had.

500
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:41,870
Speaker 0: he just told everyone write down what your beliefs are and You know, we'll take them into consideration for like XP's and all that.

501
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:42,954
Speaker 1: Well, no more so than that.

502
00:38:43,295 --> 00:38:44,258
Speaker 1: He did the loot crane thing.

503
00:38:44,398 --> 00:38:56,068
Speaker 1: one you have beliefs - there is an in-game reward Either for following them or for changing them or for going against them in dramatic fashion - there are in-game mechanics - in.

504
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,084
Speaker 1: additionally additionally encourage you to follow or break beliefs in dramatic ways.

505
00:39:01,445 --> 00:39:03,513
Speaker 1: in that Alex will give you Magic.

506
00:39:03,553 --> 00:39:07,310
Speaker 1: d6 is kind of like Arthur in rare occasions when you pull off something cool.

507
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,570
Speaker 1: Mmm, I think those two things together are really gonna make the game a lot more focused.

508
00:39:12,012 --> 00:39:14,305
Speaker 1: It's like you said when you didn't have any motivation for the character.

509
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:15,290
Speaker 1: It gives us motivation.

510
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:17,396
Speaker 1: It reminds us why we're playing.

511
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:18,861
Speaker 1: what does my character want?

512
00:39:19,402 --> 00:39:21,950
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I'm gonna try to get that or that's something stupid.

513
00:39:22,051 --> 00:39:22,980
Speaker 1: I don't want that anymore.

514
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:23,788
Speaker 1: I want something else.

515
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:31,890
Speaker 0: Yeah It seems like D&D without like saying what your characters beliefs are and all that is sort of like everyone's beliefs are.

516
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:38,450
Speaker 0: Get this show on the road Let's go to where the DM is pointing us and let's hop on the choo-choo train to beat the bad guy.

517
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,823
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's the kind of D&D that I really dislike.

518
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:42,405
Speaker 1: I really like.

519
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:43,128
Speaker 0: I used to like it.

520
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:46,559
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I like it as a one-off, you know, here's the plot.

521
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,750
Speaker 1: follow it, but I'm much more of the in a campaign.

522
00:39:49,810 --> 00:40:05,269
Speaker 0: I'm much more like the idea of let's go here because my character would want to La yeah, the problem I have though is when my character wants to do something that is It's nothing to do with the other players and would basically take me out of the game.

523
00:40:06,234 --> 00:40:29,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then again reform number two if a character Concludes either by achieving whatever they were after to where it would no longer be Useful or relevant or make sense for them to stay in the game or if they complete as in they die You can just make a new character with all the experience that the previous one had Introduce them into the plot as a new character and keep going.

524
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:37,527
Speaker 1: so you won't be forced to keep playing a character Whose motivation is gone who has completed what he wanted to do or had a very good reason to leave.

525
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:39,816
Speaker 0: I Like that a lot cuz.

526
00:40:39,876 --> 00:40:48,690
Speaker 0: then when you look at the game, you know as you know Just the story with characters in it and take away the ties to real people out there.

527
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:56,589
Speaker 0: It makes a lot more sense because a lot of times you play D&D and it's like, alright every character Every player has to go from the beginning to the end.

528
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:01,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, even Scott Johnson played in a game way back where that same thing happened.

529
00:41:01,146 --> 00:41:05,582
Speaker 1: his character won Saved everything rescued the artifact saved the girl.

530
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:06,224
Speaker 1: It was over.

531
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:09,918
Speaker 1: He was ready to go home But the game kept going.

532
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,142
Speaker 1: so he kept playing the character, but it was just a hollow Unfulfilling experience from that point forward because the character was done.

533
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:16,946
Speaker 1: There was nothing left.

534
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:17,509
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

535
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:21,110
Speaker 1: And actually I remember in high school one of the games we played.

536
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:26,576
Speaker 1: that was very much how we play the first game and you know everyone had their character and it went on and The game completed.

537
00:41:26,636 --> 00:41:34,504
Speaker 1: it ended a character won a character died everything was done and then we decided we picked one of the characters and that kept.

538
00:41:34,545 --> 00:41:42,130
Speaker 1: the player kept playing that character and None of the other characters would have any reason to stick around because it ended up being a fight between members of the party.

539
00:41:42,891 --> 00:42:03,651
Speaker 1: Everyone else made new characters and the game just continued and we basically decided that the campaign the world the story would just follow This one character and every time, you know a plot arc ended or a character ended all the other players would just make a new character or bring back a Character who had a reason to be back and play that and we had a story instead of a hack-and-slash Mm-hmm.

540
00:42:03,912 --> 00:42:08,910
Speaker 1: I really like that and I think Alex is making that an official game mechanic is going to be huge.

541
00:42:09,352 --> 00:42:12,068
Speaker 0: I won't that's good because I don't know how long of my character is gonna last.

542
00:42:12,108 --> 00:42:16,384
Speaker 0: Yeah Plus I will probably have a better idea of a good character once the game is going along.

543
00:42:16,525 --> 00:42:19,288
Speaker 1: and now if you have a character Who's willing to die for something?

544
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:26,134
Speaker 1: You're actually willing to die for that in dramatic fashion because you don't lose anything and D&D usually like oh shit I don't want to die.

545
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,690
Speaker 0: then I had to be raised dead for five thousand golds.

546
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:35,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course he also has the nice thing if he kind of got rid of raising dead pretty much It's almost impossible to bring someone back from the dead.

547
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, well when you're level three, yeah.

548
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:41,546
Speaker 1: Yeah it is Yeah, but in general he said that the characters die they die.

549
00:42:41,566 --> 00:42:46,203
Speaker 1: That's good, too I like that but but I like it because we've implemented these other things.

550
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:46,805
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

551
00:42:47,507 --> 00:43:07,883
Speaker 1: And one thing he's added We haven't had gotten to try it in a large scale but we tried it in the small scale was an idea of making combat go quickly by Counting down the initiative numbers from the top to the bottom and when the number of your initiative comes up you immediately have to act And you can't really talk to other players out of character or in character during combat.

552
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:10,630
Speaker 1: Combat is quick brutal decisive and deadly.

553
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:15,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think that counting is really necessary in third ed because your initiative doesn't change around around.

554
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:25,889
Speaker 0: however forcing people to hurry up if there is a combat and just do something do something do something is much better because Here's obvious reasons.

555
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:27,577
Speaker 1: well I just realized this.

556
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:34,434
Speaker 1: here's why you keep the counting in One as a just as hearing that count go in the background Even when you're not acting.

557
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:38,850
Speaker 1: it adds a sense of urgency to the characters who aren't playing and it keeps you focused.

558
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:49,578
Speaker 1: But more importantly and you can actually you can skip the count whenever this isn't happening but whenever someone say delays action or Readies an action or anything like that.

559
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:54,900
Speaker 1: Then you count down and then the person just chimes in at the number and says I do my thing.

560
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:59,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, well if they if someone says they're gonna delay or ready then you can do that.

561
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,918
Speaker 0: But if no one's delaying or readying you might as well just go to the next person.

562
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:13,336
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, Alex actually figured that out on his own when he did the demo where he started he'd be 20 19 18 and then after the game started going he realized and he started going like he knew.

563
00:44:13,597 --> 00:44:21,262
Speaker 1: when people's numbers worse He was like 20 negative 1.

564
00:44:21,262 --> 00:44:33,364
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz they the whole goal is to make the combat take less time and be more exciting and less of a tactical analysis paralysis board game Analysis paralysis.

565
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:39,560
Speaker 0: so, you know counting down more quickly with skipping all the useless numbers just only helps that goal.

566
00:44:39,741 --> 00:44:43,540
Speaker 1: Yes, and we have once again, we haven't tried this in the full game yet.

567
00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:53,140
Speaker 1: It's actually something that we used religiously when I played D&D in middle school in high school and I just kind of forgot about it and combat took forever in college.

568
00:44:53,643 --> 00:44:56,179
Speaker 1: And once I showed everyone this it seemed to work really well.

569
00:44:56,622 --> 00:45:02,648
Speaker 1: Maybe I should mention it to the Dragons landing and see if they have any Insight into initiative and counting and all that.

570
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:03,531
Speaker 0: I don't know.

571
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:05,177
Speaker 0: I gotta email them about something else.

572
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:08,229
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, I don't think we should go on much longer.

573
00:45:08,249 --> 00:45:17,636
Speaker 1: I all I can say is that we will have multiple Episodes on Dungeons & Dragons and role-playing in the coming months as we play D&D again on a regular basis.
