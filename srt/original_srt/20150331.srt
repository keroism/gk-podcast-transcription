1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,959
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday March 31st 2015.

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,489
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,921
Speaker 1: tonight We're talking about the xcom board game.

4
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:25,589
Speaker 1: now that we've played it more than once protect humanity from poorly written rules.

5
00:00:27,592 --> 00:00:28,628
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:33,430
Speaker 1: I'm actually kind of glad that con seasons over for a while.

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,287
Speaker 0: I'm actually not over for a while the convention this weekend, and it's the last one.

8
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:37,830
Speaker 0: That's right.

9
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:38,413
Speaker 1: I've been.

10
00:00:38,434 --> 00:00:39,239
Speaker 1: that is good.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,070
Speaker 1: I've been living out of hotels.

12
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,780
Speaker 1: I am because outside of geek nights.

13
00:00:44,282 --> 00:00:48,515
Speaker 1: I've been going to a bunch of other conventions All over the world.

14
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:53,939
Speaker 1: I've been to London like three times once you go to some conventions there I did and I heard a lot of it.

15
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,466
Speaker 1: They weren't that nerdy though.

16
00:00:55,486 --> 00:00:57,378
Speaker 1: in a couple weeks I'm going to Mumbai.

17
00:00:57,843 --> 00:00:59,594
Speaker 1: great there I'm on a panel.

18
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:03,608
Speaker 1: both of the panels about like FPGA and NTP and PTP and FPGAs.

19
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,300
Speaker 1: oh yeah That's a big deal in my industry.

20
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:12,423
Speaker 1: you want you want to talk about FPGAs Using FPGAs and no we're not because they're stupid wastes of money.

21
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:14,990
Speaker 0: That's but it's like who's even programming them.

22
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,237
Speaker 1: You want to learn about that shit?

23
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:18,341
Speaker 1: We can talk all day.

24
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,364
Speaker 0: That's a Monday show.

25
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,789
Speaker 0: we ever done a Monday show on FPGA?

26
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,254
Speaker 1: Oh, and I feel like we should do.

27
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,061
Speaker 0: you know what FPGA stands for.

28
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,767
Speaker 0: I feel programmable gate.

29
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,297
Speaker 1: I forget the array.

30
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,650
Speaker 0: yeah array field programmable gate array.

31
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:38,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, I actually I didn't think that anyone outside of like Electronics you know like testing.

32
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:44,842
Speaker 1: so Scott You know my job like we like one of the things we sell is like fix engines like middleware for like financial You write it in Java.

33
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:50,527
Speaker 0: Yeah How does that have to do with an FPGA that is as far away from FPGAs as possible?

34
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:50,587
Speaker 0: so?

35
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,993
Speaker 1: Basically what you would do?

36
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:58,210
Speaker 0: we don't offer this because it's literally worth someone selling like a JVM in an FPGA.

37
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,889
Speaker 1: No, no, no, so you realize not everyone writes this stuff in Java.

38
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:13,668
Speaker 1: So there there's another company that claims to have one of these things that we do, but they've implemented it in FPGA to get below the 20 micro second like latency round-trip time.

39
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,350
Speaker 0: That's ridiculous.

40
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:21,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can get it down to like 14 and they're perfectly controlled situations under incredible expense and time.

41
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,845
Speaker 0: so I mean But I mean let's talk about it on the Monday show

42
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:33,012
Speaker 1: the Monday show, but yeah Scott I'm on this panel and I'm basically going to say my opinion on FPGAs because I don't think they're worthwhile And

43
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,500
Speaker 0: how much you have to pay someone to program them.

44
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:43,190
Speaker 1: so basically hire like two or three people who are at least as good As you and let them spend a year, and you'll have something that will garbage.

45
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,807
Speaker 1: no It'll work perfectly, but the thing it's supposed to do is itself obsolete.

46
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:53,387
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we do do stuff with like solar flare like network cards like Morse or like CUDA cores like.

47
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:53,949
Speaker 1: that's another thing.

48
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,773
Speaker 0: well Yeah, why not?

49
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:55,777
Speaker 0: That's we got a normal.

50
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,525
Speaker 1: We got a Monday show topic.

51
00:02:57,906 --> 00:03:04,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, finally So yeah, I'm on a panel about that shit, and I'm also giving a lecture, and I can't believe they're letting me do this.

52
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:28,447
Speaker 1: It's called and don't forgive me for the long title, but this is just how those conventions are How the video game industry has left the financials in the dust technologically Again panel title whatever, but basically for an hour I'm gonna talk about like how video games are programmed way better than everything in the financial world, but they're not.

53
00:03:28,568 --> 00:03:29,230
Speaker 1: yeah, they are.

54
00:03:30,413 --> 00:03:31,281
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are.

55
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,530
Speaker 0: But I mean video games are programmed awfully.

56
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:38,203
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott you wanna you want to swap tell you what.

57
00:03:38,243 --> 00:03:39,750
Speaker 1: I'll sit at your desk for a day.

58
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,215
Speaker 1: You sit at mine.

59
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:44,266
Speaker 1: You can see the inside of my world, and I'll see the.

60
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:50,530
Speaker 0: I don't make video games Yeah, so you're telling me like the code that you guys are making is worse than dwarf fortress.

61
00:03:50,871 --> 00:04:00,875
Speaker 1: I'm saying the technology environment that the majority of the world's like markets exist within is Scarily out of date.

62
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:01,839
Speaker 0: Oh, it's like old bus.

63
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:09,466
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're using old like busted jolly architected And I just I'm using like the latest Ubuntu new versions open source stuff.

64
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,370
Speaker 1: Yeah like right now There's a trend and you're using CentOS whatever.

65
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:17,834
Speaker 1: I bumped into some people out in the industry who were like oh, man We're gonna get in on this.

66
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,884
Speaker 1: like no SQL bandwagon.

67
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,310
Speaker 1: no, that's the bleeding edge.

68
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,249
Speaker 1: And we're like well one that was the bleeding edge a long time ago.

69
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,660
Speaker 0: now It's like the don't use that just use Postgres.

70
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,502
Speaker 0: Postgres is king.

71
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,809
Speaker 1: there are cases if you don't need relation it anyway.

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,034
Speaker 0: Most grass does.

73
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:36,010
Speaker 0: the non-relational stuff now - it's yeah, they do it pretty much just crushed everybody.

74
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:42,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway I just don't use it because my skills easier And I don't need to crush everybody with database because I don't do data.

75
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:48,664
Speaker 1: really I think we're I think we're scaring people away from The Tuesday, okay, so yeah, but I was I think I can over the weekend.

76
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,429
Speaker 0: You know you're bringing up the animes mr.

77
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,102
Speaker 1: Tuesday, it was just not an anime con.

78
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:53,866
Speaker 0: Okay.

79
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:54,670
Speaker 1: It's never been.

80
00:04:55,051 --> 00:05:00,170
Speaker 0: It's only has it really Japanese name and was formed from the the corpses of two anime con.

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,810
Speaker 1: No, it was formed actually from the corpses of some sci-fi cons that had anime and gaming.

82
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,129
Speaker 1: Apparently so it was never ever.

83
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,656
Speaker 0: One of those cons that was.

84
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:11,961
Speaker 0: it was formed from the corpse of.

85
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,210
Speaker 0: was a con run by an anime society?

86
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:17,200
Speaker 1: Yes, but it was pretty much always a multi-genre con.

87
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,886
Speaker 1: It's basically like baby kinetic on sure.

88
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:23,830
Speaker 1: so yeah There's a lot of gaming going on and what was interesting is that the people in the gaming area?

89
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:37,990
Speaker 1: During the day we're more our age and the people everywhere else were like 14 and under panel went super well and all that stuff, but played some games at this con and They were games that we've already talked about a little bit on gig nights.

90
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,843
Speaker 1: But now I've played them enough to actually give a for real review.

91
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,412
Speaker 1: Okay, Navigator is Legit.

92
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:45,920
Speaker 0: you played Navigator played Navigator or Rondold.

93
00:05:46,201 --> 00:05:47,365
Speaker 1: we played Rondell's.

94
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,750
Speaker 1: I rondeled my Navigator.

95
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:50,650
Speaker 0: Did you run through your never go to Japan?

96
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,986
Speaker 1: Actually the game ended before we got to Nagasaki.

97
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:54,710
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

98
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:55,249
Speaker 0: Okay.

99
00:05:55,791 --> 00:06:07,750
Speaker 1: So now that I've played Navigator no in the fucking deal with three other people who are pro at Navigator The game is very similar to Hans the Teutonica.

100
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:13,590
Speaker 1: Okay, because the game it's not like Puerto Rico where you like build your machine and go through the world.

101
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:15,439
Speaker 1: This is a game of every turn.

102
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,932
Speaker 1: you're reacting to everybody else Mm-hmm.

103
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:21,970
Speaker 0: so he moved his boat forward which means he passed over those things.

104
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,877
Speaker 0: I better go grab or let's see.

105
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:33,770
Speaker 1: Chris is like he's giving it like he might take the next prestige I need like the next privilege But it'll take him at least two turns unless he burns some ships to get around that rondell.

106
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,473
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

107
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,498
Speaker 0: is that's the rondell?

108
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:42,810
Speaker 0: is it really makes it because you'll be sitting there and you're like all right I can take that thing right there real easy and that leaves that open.

109
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:47,230
Speaker 0: Oh, but the person who goes after me their rondell is open.

110
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,177
Speaker 0: They can just go and take that easily.

111
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:57,950
Speaker 0: if I'll take the thing and even though that'll leave the other thing open Their rondell is nowhere near what they need to go get it and I'll be able to get that too.

112
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,574
Speaker 0: Cuz my rondell will be in position.

113
00:06:59,674 --> 00:07:00,757
Speaker 1: It was real close.

114
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:08,719
Speaker 1: a player basically gave the game to Chris by giving him one like ridiculous trader Like turn one merchant turn because they shifted the market.

115
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,610
Speaker 0: basically they shifted the market today sell goods or produce too many.

116
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:22,113
Speaker 1: They shifted the market to what was literally the most ridiculous possible outcome for one young Chris Reimer Mm-hmm.

117
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:25,226
Speaker 1: He made so much money that turn that that was the moment.

118
00:07:25,266 --> 00:07:26,009
Speaker 1: He won the game.

119
00:07:26,472 --> 00:07:31,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're gonna shift the market you have to make sure no one's in rondell position But you're always in rondell position for market.

120
00:07:32,004 --> 00:07:32,890
Speaker 0: There's two of them on there.

121
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,501
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I played the strategy of basically I won like one set.

122
00:07:38,002 --> 00:07:41,615
Speaker 1: I went around the rondell as slow as Possible.

123
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,391
Speaker 0: you went up one one one one one I did.

124
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:47,609
Speaker 1: I did a couple of twos but I went super fucking slow to do like have this perfect combo.

125
00:07:47,629 --> 00:08:00,013
Speaker 1: and I didn't do that until I had the navigator Denying everyone else the navigator as long as possible and then suddenly using it and surging as big as possible double Navigator.

126
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,123
Speaker 1: and by doing this I held out.

127
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:05,917
Speaker 1: so I was right in front of privilege Right when the next era started like.

128
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:09,910
Speaker 1: it was a beauty to behold but in the end I lost because of that one merchant turn.

129
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:13,062
Speaker 1: But yeah, navador is a great game rondell's.

130
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,830
Speaker 0: It's probably the hottest rondell game right now.

131
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:20,130
Speaker 1: I definitely think I cannot name a better rondell game that I have played enough to make that judgment.

132
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,721
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've only played or let Bora once or twice now.

133
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:24,528
Speaker 0: I've only played antique II once.

134
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:28,060
Speaker 0: yeah I would not miss the same guy who made antique II who loves rondell's.

135
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:29,646
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, Matt Gertz.

136
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,890
Speaker 0: I'd maybe click on that.

137
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,554
Speaker 1: It's Matt Gertz.

138
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:39,008
Speaker 0: I've been pretty sure he did antique a yes and TK That's also an TK - you might as well consider navigator to be the newest bestest proper.

139
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:47,250
Speaker 1: Yeah So if you already own hundreds of tonica, don't bother buying navigator unless you can get it for less than a hundred bucks.

140
00:08:48,210 --> 00:09:00,010
Speaker 1: but Navigator it's like it'll scratch that Hanza style itch But it'll scratch that sort of like Puerto Rico itch a little bit because of the market and kind of the way things go.

141
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,157
Speaker 0: Well, let's let's get rondell's going.

142
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:07,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the other game I played enough to finally judge is red seven Which we also talked about before.

143
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played that at PAX East.

144
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,117
Speaker 1: It's fun, but I'm done with it.

145
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:14,550
Speaker 0: It didn't seem like a game with tons of replay value.

146
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,016
Speaker 0: It just seemed like a really clever.

147
00:09:16,096 --> 00:09:19,609
Speaker 1: It is the same level of replay value as no, thanks.

148
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,530
Speaker 0: No, thanks has a lot of replay.

149
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,549
Speaker 1: Exactly totally fun to bust out like play a couple games of it and then play a real game.

150
00:09:28,427 --> 00:09:38,581
Speaker 1: but I find increasingly that I Have very few decisions I can make like there's only one decision that determines the outcome of the game and the rest of it is Just card counting or luck.

151
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:39,909
Speaker 1: and it's like there is no.

152
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,709
Speaker 0: I mean even when I played I knew it was all luck.

153
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:47,310
Speaker 0: But the fun of the game is not in you like whether you win or lose is pretty much.

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,329
Speaker 0: Do you have the cards to win or lose but you it's on your turn?

155
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,530
Speaker 0: Figuring out is there even a way that I cannot lose this turn exactly?

156
00:09:57,711 --> 00:10:03,010
Speaker 0: So it's a. it's basically a puzzle game and it's just you know, if who gets to solve the most puzzles?

157
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:18,466
Speaker 1: I don't know this and no thanks both have this like they're very similar in the sense that the Decisions you're making and the puzzles you're solving turn by turn are fun And the game is so quick both to teach and to play.

158
00:10:18,486 --> 00:10:28,170
Speaker 1: you don't really give a shit Yeah that you have a great time and then you're done and you played a few more times and then you move on to a bigger Game, so it's a great game to play but it's not a great game.

159
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:34,130
Speaker 1: That's the way I would say that Yeah, so I don't think I'll buy it because I already own no thanks.

160
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:40,870
Speaker 1: But and almost everyone else we know bought red seven and owns it so we pretty much don't have to rely on ourselves having it.

161
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,469
Speaker 1: You know, wait, wait, what?

162
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,276
Speaker 1: Alright board game geek.

Speaker 1: a prank It's not a prank.

208
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:15,349
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was a prank.

209
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:16,774
Speaker 0: to elevate it to prank.

210
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:23,063
Speaker 0: You would have to like You know somehow trick the person into Falling.

211
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:24,991
Speaker 0: I can't figure out a way to do the fish up the butt.

212
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:29,546
Speaker 1: But for example, I didn't say up the butt Anyway, it's up you putting Scott.

213
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:34,300
Speaker 1: you make it like a construction paper outline of a fish and you tape it to someone's butt Jesus.

214
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:36,087
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not a prank.

215
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:37,815
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was a price.

216
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:38,157
Speaker 0: That's not.

217
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,719
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not a name I guess make me a prank but it's not an April Fool's.

218
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:49,185
Speaker 0: Anyway anyway, for example, here's the example right someone what you know The old bucket on top of the door trick.

219
00:13:49,365 --> 00:13:50,108
Speaker 1: that's not a prank.

220
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:53,318
Speaker 0: I'm just saying assuming you do that all you're doing.

221
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:54,000
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

222
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,083
Speaker 1: The April fish.

223
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:57,768
Speaker 1: I'm reading Wikipedia.

224
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:01,679
Speaker 1: in Italy France Belgium and Belgium speaking areas of Switzerland.

225
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,119
Speaker 1: in Canada April 1st tradition is known as the April fish.

226
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:09,191
Speaker 1: This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back.

227
00:14:09,773 --> 00:14:11,760
Speaker 1: I always knew it as the but without being noticed.

228
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,664
Speaker 1: That's all they do.

229
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,934
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe we should do that.

230
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:15,858
Speaker 1: Let's move on to that.

231
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:16,320
Speaker 0: That's cute.

232
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:19,237
Speaker 1: That's just get a little fish on someone's butt and hope it stays there all day.

233
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:19,699
Speaker 1: Like that's it.

234
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:21,320
Speaker 1: It's like a modern Baron.

235
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:27,499
Speaker 0: But if you if someone walks in the door and the water falls on them That's just hurting someone either with the bucket or with the water.

236
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:41,240
Speaker 0: Well pranks pranks are by definition hurting someone a little bit, but let's say let's say that you You know tamper with somebody's sink and they go to wash their hands and they get sprayed with water.

237
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:46,840
Speaker 0: Right, it's like well they triggered the you know, or you gave them a reason to wash their hands.

238
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,880
Speaker 1: So you're using the Rick roll rule of they have to ask for it, right?

239
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,931
Speaker 0: It's like you have to somehow fool them or trick them into doing the thing.

240
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:58,080
Speaker 0: and then it's like like for example the gum.

241
00:14:58,582 --> 00:14:59,626
Speaker 0: Hey, would you like some gum?

242
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:01,755
Speaker 0: and they take the gum stick and it snaps them on the finger.

243
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:02,780
Speaker 0: That's a fool.

244
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,146
Speaker 1: See, I I don't know.

245
00:15:04,247 --> 00:15:04,608
Speaker 1: I disagree.

246
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,155
Speaker 1: I think more of my not a good one.

247
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:08,748
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's a good one I'm saying the best any cows.

248
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:13,028
Speaker 1: We're just convincing someone of something That was not true.

249
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:14,575
Speaker 1: That was like the.

250
00:15:14,856 --> 00:15:15,600
Speaker 1: it's kind of like a path.

251
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,102
Speaker 1: It's like the.

252
00:15:16,182 --> 00:15:20,360
Speaker 1: more outrageous the thing is if you pull it off and get them to believe it.

253
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:24,820
Speaker 0: The payout is so much great, but you got them to believe that you were giving them gum.

254
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,957
Speaker 0: It's still that counts as at least as a fool, even though it's garbage.

255
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:31,798
Speaker 1: Yeah That's like going for one victory point.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,599
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

257
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,775
Speaker 0: But at least it's a victory point and not a negative point that should go in the fire.

258
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,441
Speaker 1: true true true That's what I'm saying.

259
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,923
Speaker 1: So, uh, yeah, I'm not gonna do any pranks tomorrow.

260
00:15:40,143 --> 00:15:49,128
Speaker 1: No, no, but anyway things of the day.

261
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:55,791
Speaker 1: So I I'm not gonna ever do this again because I linked to one of these guys videos before but I have to link to This one.

Speaker 1: This video is titled Mario dies.

267
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:13,239

268
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,450
Speaker 1: there's a moment when you're gonna be thinking something you're gonna be thinking.

Speaker 1: Please pick four, please pick four and at that moment the person who is describing this video to you will be saying what you are Thinking.

295
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:45,650
Speaker 0: but this one is thematic Passover thematic and that gives it the extra bonus points that moment.

296
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 0: I could probably accept two more thematic Rube Goldberg machines before it's been played out.

297
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's true.

298
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:57,950
Speaker 0: and Passover great theme for a Rube Goldberg because no one's ever done that one before it's a typical.

299
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,957
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things you can I guarantee.

300
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:04,392
Speaker 0: this is probably the only Passover themed Rude Goldberg machine to exist in the history Of humanity.

301
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,038
Speaker 0: I'm willing to bet money on that.

302
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,809
Speaker 1: The best moment in this thing is let my people go.

303
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:11,516
Speaker 0: I really like the.

304
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:14,769
Speaker 0: the frogs and the other bugs are funny and the burning bush.

305
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,441
Speaker 1: No, there are a bunch of Passover Rube Goldberg machines.

306
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,364
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

307
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:20,287
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

308
00:18:20,348 --> 00:18:21,070
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

309
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,825
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, wait, a lot of these are just that same video ripped off.

Speaker 1: Okay.

311
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,339
Speaker 1: Wait a minute I'll have to do a little more research.

312
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,767
Speaker 1: Okay, here's that.

313
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:32,819

Speaker 1: I'm watching it.

318
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:39,383
Speaker 0: I don't see any theme.

319
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,527

369
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,296
Speaker 1: It's been a long time since we've done that panel.

370
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,540
Speaker 1: So as thank icon I did it.

371
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,542
Speaker 1: Ippatsu Kiki Musume is a fucking gold mine.

372
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:00,465
Speaker 0: Yes amazing.

373
00:21:00,947 --> 00:21:06,086
Speaker 1: No one Literally, no one in the room and the room was full had ever seen it.

374
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:07,190
Speaker 0: Yeah or heard of it.

375
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,485
Speaker 1: They even like friends of ours had never heard of it.

376
00:21:10,546 --> 00:21:11,390
Speaker 1: It's been too long.

377
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,400
Speaker 0: It's been that has one that has been too long.

378
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,170
Speaker 0: We should probably find some different episodes of it.

379
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,410
Speaker 0: I think I have quite a few of mine.

380
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,761
Speaker 1: You know what drive I'm gonna be.

381
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:18,789
Speaker 1: I've watched a lot of it.

382
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:19,955
Speaker 0: The first one is the best.

383
00:21:19,975 --> 00:21:21,281
Speaker 1: the first one is literally the best.

384
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:23,070
Speaker 0: steps where she's all she can't move her body.

385
00:21:24,272 --> 00:21:24,935
Speaker 0: And the sauna.

386
00:21:24,955 --> 00:21:25,819
Speaker 0: she can't open the door.

387
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:28,129
Speaker 1: Let's check her body water content now.

388
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:34,076
Speaker 0: Oh, I think in the later ones like she's trying to boil crabs and like she's upset too Just to put her hand in the boiling water.

389
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,750
Speaker 1: She falls into the boiling water and then the crabs start attacking her.

390
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:44,186
Speaker 1: On Saturday night, we're doing the narrator's are really the best analyzing anime utana.

391
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:51,919
Speaker 1: All right, that's all you yeah, and we're doing foreign anime openers, which is Rearranged and better than we've ever done it before.

392
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:52,963
Speaker 0: such an easy panel.

393
00:21:53,264 --> 00:22:02,199
Speaker 0: Yep, and then Sunday morning We're just getting the fuck home eating breakfast secret breakfast secret breakfast rain to New York secret breakfast two days So you can come to the train to New York panel.

394
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,243
Speaker 0: I highly recommend it.

395
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:05,232
Speaker 0: the best panel ahead of me From 11 a.m.

396
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:05,434
Speaker 1: To 2 p.m.

397
00:22:08,091 --> 00:22:14,289
Speaker 1: Ish if you come on the Acela back to New York, we will entertain you for like five minutes and then just take a nap.

398
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:18,323
Speaker 0: We can play some advanced wars with rim your.

399
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,569
Speaker 1: do you want to play advanced wars with me?

400
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,006
Speaker 0: No, but that's the person who gets on the train can?

401
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:22,550
Speaker 1: they won't?

402
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,430
Speaker 0: They're willing to buy an Acela ticket.

403
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:36,495
Speaker 1: So, yeah, we played the xcom tabletop game for real And we live-streamed it.

404
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:37,077
Speaker 0: Yep.

405
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:40,409
Speaker 0: So this game if you don't know xcom, I hope you know what xcom is.

406
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:43,170
Speaker 0: I hope you know anyway, so there's an xcom board game.

407
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:48,690
Speaker 1: It's a co-op game with four players based on the recent reboot of the xcom video game.

408
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,037
Speaker 0: Yes, you fight against the aliens you're all on a team sort of like pandemic.

409
00:22:53,198 --> 00:23:06,564
Speaker 0: only it's real time and we played a demo of it at PAX Prime and we now have the real deal and we played that and live-streamed it and It hasn't really changed that much since the version we played at PAX Prime.

410
00:23:06,744 --> 00:23:08,590
Speaker 1: However, it was fun.

411
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,153
Speaker 1: Like don't worry.

412
00:23:09,193 --> 00:23:09,676
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk.

413
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:11,870
Speaker 1: we say a lot of negative things, but in the end it is fun.

414
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:26,217
Speaker 1: We're going to play it a bunch more yeah, but a Lot of negatives that were not apparent when someone who is an expert at the game from fantasy flight runs it for you became Strikingly apparent in actual play.

415
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:26,579
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

416
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,830
Speaker 1: The games got some pretty serious issues.

417
00:23:30,171 --> 00:23:35,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the fundamental idea of the game is you're all four people you're running xcom.

418
00:23:36,013 --> 00:23:37,381
Speaker 1: Wait, each one of us is four people.

419
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:46,279
Speaker 0: Yes, okay you're running xcom defending the earth against aliens because that's what xcom do and Each person has a unique job.

420
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:48,349
Speaker 0: This is the first thing that makes it better than pandemic.

421
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,796
Speaker 0: Unique jobs.

422
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:52,350
Speaker 0: each person is responsible for one thing and one thing only.

423
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:59,689
Speaker 0: usually two or three responsibilities per person and Thus, you know, you can't really be doing everyone's job.

424
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,559
Speaker 0: I mean you can play two player.

425
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,704
Speaker 0: where you do two jobs each.

426
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:03,910
Speaker 0: you can do three player, right?

427
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, but and in baby Like in baby mode you can talk a lot more words.

428
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:15,990
Speaker 1: You're playing for real like if I'm the military guy and I spend time talking to the science officer.

429
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:18,630
Speaker 1: That time matters a lot, right?

430
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:24,404
Speaker 0: So in there are other, you know The real time factor is the other thing that separates it from pandemic and pandemic.

431
00:24:24,424 --> 00:24:32,472
Speaker 0: you can sit around for 20 minutes Discussing the best possible move and thus really it's only a one-player game and not a co-op game Xcom.

432
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:39,289
Speaker 0: even if you wanted to share all the information and even if you discussed everything You don't have time to and you don't even it.

433
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:50,366
Speaker 0: You don't have the brainpower within that time to figure out what the best thing everyone should do is and you don't even know all The information yet because the real timeness doesn't come from like an mp3 the way space alert does.

434
00:24:50,807 --> 00:24:51,710
Speaker 0: it comes from an app?

435
00:24:52,211 --> 00:24:54,989
Speaker 0: So you have to finish doing one thing before you go to the next thing.

436
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:57,978
Speaker 0: So it's like decide where to put your interceptors.

437
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:05,761
Speaker 0: Okay, then it's like oh by the way, here's where the UFOs are fuck Yep, they went somewhere where we didn't go.

438
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:06,905
Speaker 1: Hey, can I move a guy?

439
00:25:06,985 --> 00:25:08,270
Speaker 1: No, you tap that science already.

440
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,329
Speaker 0: Well, I got a times up times up.

441
00:25:10,952 --> 00:25:11,794
Speaker 1: So what's real?

442
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:16,470
Speaker 1: basically what's really interesting about this is that in the end the game comes down to two phases.

443
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:20,964
Speaker 1: There's the push your luck phase the press your luck phase and the resource allocation phase.

444
00:25:21,425 --> 00:25:22,970
Speaker 1: only the latter is real-time.

445
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,450
Speaker 0: Yes, so you do real-time resource allocating and then you resolve slowly and carefully.

446
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:35,550
Speaker 1: So the parts of the game that would be really fiddly like should I attack with these troops or these troops in this?

447
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,875
Speaker 1: Particular encounter.

448
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:39,830
Speaker 1: there's no time limit on that because that wouldn't have been fun.

449
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,617
Speaker 1: You'd be like to have a time limit on that.

450
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,867
Speaker 1: the fiddly stuff doesn't have time limits.

451
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 1: the like Broad strokes the where are we focusing has an extreme time limit?

452
00:25:49,931 --> 00:25:55,590
Speaker 1: It's a game where you have to have three friends and you all have to trust each other to not be stupid.

453
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:57,477
Speaker 0: Four friends if you can't yourself.

454
00:25:57,838 --> 00:25:59,184
Speaker 1: Well, are you your own friend?

455
00:25:59,425 --> 00:25:59,746
Speaker 0: I don't know.

456
00:26:00,368 --> 00:26:02,298
Speaker 1: in this game A lot of times you're your own worst enemy.

457
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:02,761
Speaker 1: Yes.

458
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:03,545
Speaker 0: Yes indeed.

459
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:07,430
Speaker 0: So Is the problems with the game, right?

460
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:13,350
Speaker 0: So problem number one is that you have these cards that give you abilities and as the science gets research you get more cards.

461
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:18,023
Speaker 1: Wait Scott, this card says use during an encounter.

462
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:20,049
Speaker 1: Does that mean any encounter or just a?

463
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:25,910
Speaker 1: Every science card had like some level of ambiguity that required us to pause the game and look it up.

464
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:26,192
Speaker 1: It's

465
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:43,989
Speaker 0: very clear that some cards Are only used during the time phase because they have a picture of a clock on them and some are only used during the resolution Phase because they have two cubes on them, but what's not clear is Exactly the wording on them is not specific enough that you don't know if you can always do it.

466
00:26:44,551 --> 00:26:59,670
Speaker 0: Also another problem with them is that it's because the ones that you use during the time phase Because you're under time pressure It's very easy to forget that they exist and to remember all of them that are yeah You say that because you're the reason we died.

467
00:27:00,294 --> 00:27:07,990
Speaker 0: also, there are Other players who can only really pay attention to their own biz because it's so fast.

468
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:13,650
Speaker 0: They might have cards to use during the time phase that would be best used on you.

469
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:17,309
Speaker 0: Just likewise you might have cards for the time phase best used on them.

470
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,909
Speaker 0: So you actually to get the most efficient use out of them?

471
00:27:21,351 --> 00:27:28,329
Speaker 0: You would actually have to pay attention to the other person's timed action and say I'm using this time thing to help you Oh my god during the time phase.

472
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:41,288
Speaker 0: But how can you even pay attention to that while you're too busy Thinking about your own shit and then to also remember a card ability you have and also remember to use it on someone else Because you paid attention to what they're doing during the time phase?

473
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:48,750
Speaker 1: result Is that the concept is great because you feel it said you feel like you're in the situation room and Evangelion or XCOM.

474
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:50,057
Speaker 1: Yes, your dad will.

475
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,309
Speaker 1: XCOM and Evangelion are basically the same thing.

476
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,805
Speaker 1: Sort of yeah, so you're down there.

477
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:59,058
Speaker 0: Don't make babies XCOM yeah.

478
00:27:59,098 --> 00:27:59,863
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

479
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:00,889
Speaker 1: technically you can.

480
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:07,350
Speaker 0: For now Room of golf isn't closed or whatever.

481
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,903
Speaker 1: Yeah The problem the only problems with the game the only problems come down to fantasy.

482
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:14,671
Speaker 1: flight wrote the words on the cards and they're bad At that.

483
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:16,737
Speaker 0: they're bad at that netrunner and every other game also

484
00:28:17,158 --> 00:28:31,309
Speaker 1: and the instructions only exist within the app making it actually Really hard to look up rules on the fly and making it extremely likely that anyone you ever play this game with Only one person will have ever read the rules.

485
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:32,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the rule.

486
00:28:32,957 --> 00:28:36,050
Speaker 0: in the in the box there are rules, but it's just a quick start sheet.

487
00:28:36,554 --> 00:28:43,890
Speaker 0: All the actual rules are in the app Which means if you want to do a rules look up you have to like pause go into some options menu.

488
00:28:44,031 --> 00:28:47,144
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to peruse the rules in there.

489
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,610
Speaker 0: It's just really bad.

490
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,770
Speaker 0: They should have been less cheap because fantasy fights also very cheap.

491
00:28:52,171 --> 00:29:03,219
Speaker 0: And in addition to putting the rules in the app also printed the full rules out Even though one good thing about putting the rules in the app is that as the app if you have rules updates You can do app updates.

492
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,249
Speaker 0: Yes, which is cool.

493
00:29:04,692 --> 00:29:13,509
Speaker 0: So I'm all in favor of putting the rules in the app to begin with But that can't be the only place the rules are in the very least some cheat sheets or something, right?

494
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:17,610
Speaker 0: I mean People are gonna have an iPad or tablet to play this game.

495
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,910
Speaker 0: You can always just use a laptop with the web browser or you could use your iPhone.

496
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:26,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can use any pretty much any electronic device as access to the app They made.

497
00:29:26,772 --> 00:29:30,548
Speaker 0: it is, you know cross-platform as possible with the web version.

498
00:29:30,609 --> 00:29:38,319
Speaker 0: even so you could go to the rules on the web actually if you wanted to but People are just gonna be there with the one tablet.

499
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,307
Speaker 0: They're not gonna have four tablets.

500
00:29:40,748 --> 00:29:41,070
Speaker 0: Okay?

501
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:43,709
Speaker 0: You should have printed out a rule book in there.

502
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:58,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, so as a result The only way to experience this game in its fullest is to play it and but fail at it and have to keep pausing and Looking shit up like three or four times until you like get the game and remember all the sort of errata.

503
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,850
Speaker 0: Right, but all four people get the game.

504
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,607
Speaker 0: Yes, as soon as you switch out a player well fuck all.

505
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,110
Speaker 0: we got it.

506
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:14,170
Speaker 0: You know, you need four people who have been through it who are ex-com hardened veterans elites Yep, and know the deal and then you can start to get the most out of this game.

507
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:21,367
Speaker 0: so people know what cards are to the point at which they can just say the name of the card like I use X and People know what that is.

508
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:33,309
Speaker 0: then you can start to actually be good enough to save the world from aliens because the even on easy mode the app is Ruthless, so only buy this game if you have a group of four people.

509
00:30:34,113 --> 00:30:42,608
Speaker 1: you really want the full set who is willing to play this game repeatedly and Actually get good at it Yep or at least competent at it.

510
00:30:43,071 --> 00:30:51,549
Speaker 1: once you get to that level you can play this with other people who are competent at conventions or you can be the guy who Runs the game for other people and teaches it to them.

511
00:30:52,071 --> 00:31:01,349
Speaker 1: But seriously the game is not a game until everyone knows the rules and you figured out all the like kind of poorly written details of the cards.

512
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:05,841
Speaker 1: So once you get past that the game is really fun.

513
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:21,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you know, it's what pandemics I mean, it's not the great co-op like Hanabi is but it definitely beats all those other garbage co-ops like pandemic and shadows over Camelot and it has this interesting like the kinds of decisions you're making the brain feel of them.

514
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:25,115
Speaker 1: the way the pressure is is Actually very realistic.

515
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:40,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's not like it's sort of weird in that they found a way To you look at a game like space alert where it's also real-time decision-making But you're basically programming on your turn in space alert, which is kind of a lot to do in real time.

516
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:53,552
Speaker 0: Yeah And it's sort of tricky annoying tricky like it's like I'm making real Game decisions like as difficult as game decisions I would make in any other euro game, but I'm time pressured and that's just sort of frustrating here.

517
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:57,282
Speaker 0: the time pressure combined with actually what is easy decisions.

518
00:31:57,642 --> 00:32:03,790
Speaker 0: if you had all the time in the world to decide on things in Xcom especially during the time it would be so baby game.

519
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:09,350
Speaker 0: It would be like oh obviously put the interceptors there because we can move one later if we have to.

520
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,064
Speaker 0: That's where we get the most use out of them.

521
00:32:12,326 --> 00:32:20,289
Speaker 1: Imagine World War two as a war if you zoomed out and had all the time in the world to think about it.

522
00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:24,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you're making your decisions of where to send the armies and what day is d-day.

523
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:29,370
Speaker 0: Yep But it's like the decisions you make in Xcom are like just you have you know.

524
00:32:29,511 --> 00:32:30,257
Speaker 0: How much money do you have?

525
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:31,710
Speaker 0: we can put about four interceptors?

526
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,336
Speaker 0: Where do you put them?

527
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,710
Speaker 0: the place with the most UFOs?

528
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,609
Speaker 0: Really simple decision that gets really intense when you've all got about six seconds to make it.

529
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,612
Speaker 1: Yep, you'll have.

530
00:32:40,632 --> 00:32:42,357
Speaker 1: you'll have conversations like calm.

531
00:32:42,517 --> 00:32:44,562
Speaker 1: how much money can I spend on interceptors?

532
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:52,672
Speaker 1: and you've already spent five seconds saying that Yeah So the it's a real-world problem-solving like emergent Strategy.

533
00:32:52,712 --> 00:33:00,749
Speaker 1: if you have to be able to very quickly figure out is the information that I have worth telling anyone because the time matters?

534
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,882
Speaker 1: Is it worth it to ask for permission or to do a thing?

535
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:06,930
Speaker 1: Do I even want to interact with people?

536
00:33:07,831 --> 00:33:13,830
Speaker 1: It's you have to make these like really real decisions really quickly based on possibly limited information.

537
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,038
Speaker 0: The other thing is that there's certain things on.

538
00:33:16,058 --> 00:33:21,688
Speaker 0: basically there's a lot of different areas of the board where things are happening Quite like shadows over Camelot.

539
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,750
Speaker 0: All right You got the UFOs coming down that you have to get rid of or else they cause panic.

540
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:33,304
Speaker 0: You've got the base that's under attack that you have to defend or else your base will be destroyed and you need to beat those Missions right and there's missions.

541
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:35,949
Speaker 0: the mission Doesn't actually pressure you.

542
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:41,330
Speaker 0: You know the way that the base being destroyed or the UFOs can end your game when you have to push back against them.

543
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,923
Speaker 0: The mission like you can do.

544
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,486
Speaker 0: the mission or not It's up to you.

545
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:52,810
Speaker 0: But if you want to have any chance of actually defending the base or your reducing panic in the continents When you beat a mission you get the rewards.

546
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:58,730
Speaker 0: You need those rewards or you will not have enough stuff to protect the world elsewhere.

547
00:33:59,352 --> 00:34:06,550
Speaker 0: So the mission does pressure you once you realize that that is true and it's very very difficult to do all these things at once.

548
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:10,330
Speaker 1: What's also very interesting is that the players are fully autonomous.

549
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:13,542
Speaker 1: So I could just deploy all my interceptors.

550
00:34:13,623 --> 00:34:15,449
Speaker 1: I could just be BAM and send them all out there.

551
00:34:15,571 --> 00:34:19,310
Speaker 0: I can do whatever and then at the end of the turn it's like how much money did we spend too much?

552
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,212
Speaker 0: Well, we're fucked.

553
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:23,121
Speaker 1: yeah, yep, so it the game.

554
00:34:23,482 --> 00:34:26,530
Speaker 1: the players all interact with each other in different ways.

555
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:30,270
Speaker 1: So like the calm I feel like I'm gonna specialize in like one or two roles.

556
00:34:30,351 --> 00:34:33,170
Speaker 1: I think everyone's gonna specialize in like a couple of roles.

557
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:40,065
Speaker 0: It might be boring to always do one role But it's still good to like play one or two of them a whole bunch to get good at them.

558
00:34:40,085 --> 00:34:52,737
Speaker 0: because like the science person They need to learn all those cards because if like the first few times they play They're gonna spend a lot of time reading the cards and that's gonna hose you if you get to the point where you've memorized Most of the cards that's gonna save you so

559
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:53,039
Speaker 1: much

560
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:57,552
Speaker 0: time and improve the decision-making on the science side Tremendously.

561
00:34:57,653 --> 00:35:10,930
Speaker 1: science has probably one of the hardest roles in the sense that you have to synthesize Quickly the entire state of the game to figure out what technology you're looking at from your choices Will help now and is necessary.

562
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:17,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like this you have to figure out how much like how much you should take from everybody else to make that happen.

563
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,252
Speaker 1: Right.

564
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:21,196
Speaker 1: This one will work and Come give me three dollars.

565
00:35:21,657 --> 00:35:29,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we only have four dollars left to spend and like the base is under attack, dude Yeah, but it's like the decision you make is so simple.

566
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,690
Speaker 0: It's like pick a card and choose zero one two or three scientists to work on it.

567
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:37,642
Speaker 0: So if you had even a minute to think about that, it would be brain-dead.

568
00:35:37,682 --> 00:35:40,110
Speaker 0: simple, but you have about five to ten seconds.

569
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:43,600
Speaker 0: So and you just drew the cards and you're still reading them.

570
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:45,426
Speaker 1: So, you know what I kind of want.

571
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:46,670
Speaker 1: I've been thinking about this.

572
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:57,168
Speaker 1: Imagine using this idea for similar other kinds of games like imagine a game where you're all either Gundam pilots or on the bridge of a Gundam.

573
00:35:57,308 --> 00:36:02,023
Speaker 0: sure Yeah, any sort of real-time battle situation involving multiple people.

574
00:36:02,484 --> 00:36:04,390
Speaker 0: you could you know have the same basic.

575
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:07,341
Speaker 0: You know structure and the app would totally help you out.

576
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:08,585
Speaker 0: Also exactly.

577
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,817
Speaker 0: It's like alright, I'm in the Gundam That's my job.

578
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:16,674
Speaker 0: You're firing the guns you're in another Gundam and The fire ones.

579
00:36:16,755 --> 00:36:19,589
Speaker 1: one person's firing the low and greens and one person's moving the ship.

580
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, one person's actually directing all the Gundam pilots, but doesn't do anything else.

581
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:28,063
Speaker 0: But so the app is like, you know char just shot at your whatever.

582
00:36:28,163 --> 00:36:30,049
Speaker 0: Oh my god move left and do this.

583
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:31,835
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, now this happened.

584
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:32,638
Speaker 0: Oh my god do this.

585
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,963
Speaker 0: You have five seconds.

586
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:35,629
Speaker 0: Otherwise another bad thing will happen to you.

587
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:46,084
Speaker 1: It's interesting to me that you know in all the time people have been trying to make games like this Xcom actually did do it first like it has flaws, but the flaws are just purely implementation.

588
00:36:46,124 --> 00:36:48,050
Speaker 1: The concept is so rock-solid.

589
00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:49,314
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean you look at thing.

590
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:55,986
Speaker 0: people are like dying to get things going like Artemis bridge simulator and It's like that's a big setup with a bunch of computers.

591
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,940
Speaker 1: Yeah Software they had it at Zenk icon actually.

592
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have it a lot of places.

593
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're trying to get it at Connecticut.

594
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:01,877
Speaker 0: Sure, why not?

595
00:37:02,443 --> 00:37:03,190
Speaker 0: It's really popular.

596
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:10,070
Speaker 0: But it's like you can get basically the same experience with this Xcom game for way less money and effort.

597
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:14,730
Speaker 0: Yes one tablet and four people and practice.

598
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:24,347
Speaker 1: So watch out for I hope this pushes co-op tabletop games In a vastly different trajectory from where they've been up to this point.

599
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:30,230
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I just sort of wish there was like an app only mode, you know, it's like the tabletop part.

600
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,290
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like nice to play a tabletop game.

601
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,409
Speaker 0: But seriously, you could have just made this like a four tablet or four 3ds game.

602
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:38,787
Speaker 0: You know, it's four people sit there with the tablets and do it.

603
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,916
Speaker 0: But why is this?

604
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:41,790
Speaker 1: could not if you're gonna have resolution in the screen?

605
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:46,949
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's sort of clever and forward-thinking to combine the app with the tabletop part.

606
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:51,822
Speaker 0: But really it's like if you have software you don't need the tabletop part.

607
00:37:51,862 --> 00:37:53,788
Speaker 0: We could just go full software.

608
00:37:53,808 --> 00:38:00,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, well Part of it is that unless you had a very large tablet It is.

609
00:38:00,893 --> 00:38:02,258
Speaker 0: it is quite a large interface.

610
00:38:02,298 --> 00:38:02,700
Speaker 0: that's true.

611
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:05,150
Speaker 1: big board all that stuff.

612
00:38:05,611 --> 00:38:08,841
Speaker 1: There's a very non trivial UX problem there.

613
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:12,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's somewhat true because there's kind of like member an eclipse.

614
00:38:12,151 --> 00:38:30,765
Speaker 1: We talked about how the idea that Eclipse and a big game of Eclipse Because you have to do so much in so many decisions and so much like fiddly stuff You'll often pay attention to the things that are near you and you won't pay attention to the colonies like oh Yeah, Pete and chair like having a war out there But I don't have time to pay attention to that.

615
00:38:30,785 --> 00:38:31,148
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

616
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,990
Speaker 1: So the physicality does add something that would be difficult to do currently with current tablet technology.

617
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:41,149
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be difficult if you had say everyone has a tablet and the something on the TV.

618
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:44,090
Speaker 0: But again, that's might as well be Artemis bridge simulator exactly.

619
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:50,832
Speaker 1: Yeah This is a game because it's the because of the way it's set up that you can feasibly check out from a tabletop Library.

620
00:38:50,872 --> 00:38:54,670
Speaker 1: at a convention someone whips out their iPhone or iPad and then you just play.

621
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, any literally any.

622
00:38:56,097 --> 00:39:01,362
Speaker 0: you could just use a laptop with internet and go to the website You don't even need and I you know iPad is best.

623
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:03,090
Speaker 0: I guess probably the big iPad is best.

624
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,054
Speaker 0: I was using iPad mini.

625
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:08,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, but any device will get it done and the app part is free.

626
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,823
Speaker 0: It's just the you know, so you actually if you don't want to buy this game.

627
00:39:12,264 --> 00:39:19,935
Speaker 0: You can just go get the free app straight from the Apple Store the Google Play Store or whatever and read the full rules in the app and to do the tutorial in the app.

628
00:39:20,848 --> 00:39:26,073
Speaker 0: and You know just get the board game, which is just the pieces pretty much in a box, you know There's nothing else in there.

629
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:29,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you know decide after checking out the app if you.

630
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:30,910
Speaker 0: so that's actually pretty cool.

631
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,865
Speaker 0: It's almost like there's a demo of the board game in a way for free.

632
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is this game It's.

633
00:39:36,411 --> 00:39:40,083
Speaker 1: it's shocking how much new ground this game is breaking into.

634
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:42,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, having an xcom theme doesn't hurt either.

635
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,777
Speaker 1: So it doesn't xcom also, it's just.

636
00:39:44,857 --> 00:39:45,298
Speaker 1: I'm very.

637
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:51,485
Speaker 1: I can't express you how happy I am that there is a game property Of course, I guess based on another game.

638
00:39:51,526 --> 00:39:56,519
Speaker 0: in this case Yes, like a tabletop game A licensed game that isn't garbage.

639
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:56,880
Speaker 0: Yes.

640
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:59,310
Speaker 1: I mean we all remember the Adventure Time games.

641
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,600
Speaker 0: Well, they have Star Wars games that are good Fantasy Flight.

642
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think Fantasy Flight people don't realize this, right?

643
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,870
Speaker 0: Okay, so licensed games are usually most of the time not good, right?

644
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:33,834
Speaker 0: But Fantasy Flight games the thing that they do because they're not perfect in by any means but the one thing that they do is they make licensed games and And Not the way Cryptozoic does it where we'll take any license like people who want games made out of their properties are Lining up at Fantasy Flight to say please make a game with our you know, you know intellectual property.

645
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:38,594
Speaker 0: and Fantasy Flight most of the time says no They pretty much.

646
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:43,970
Speaker 0: that's why they're doing things like fucking Star Wars like the biggest IP you could possibly have.

647
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:44,998
Speaker 1: You know, it's interesting.

648
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:46,509
Speaker 0: They're not doing all these others, right?

649
00:40:46,831 --> 00:40:47,294
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

650
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,450
Speaker 1: you say that because you know my other job like I'm a product manager, right?

651
00:40:50,670 --> 00:41:03,890
Speaker 1: Like I'm going all the other like London Conventions things and what I've noticed over the years like doing this kind of work Is that the people who say yes quickly and to most things are the worst at doing those things.

652
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:09,881
Speaker 0: It's like the people who bid really low on every government contract Exactly, like the fact like I've got I've made.

653
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,409
Speaker 1: I've gotten more deals by telling people no than telling people.

654
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:16,342
Speaker 1: Yes Mm-hmm, and that seems to be true in every industry.

655
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:18,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, except government contracts, right?

656
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:20,578
Speaker 0: So Fantasy Flight says no, but they end up doing.

657
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:21,582
Speaker 0: they do Star Wars.

658
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:22,767
Speaker 0: They do Warhammer, right?

659
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,553
Speaker 1: We were real close.

660
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:29,190
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson was holding the Star Wars capital ships game like a starter set for it.

661
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:32,866
Speaker 0: My friend Chris who played X come with has it and he's like, what are you doing Monday?

662
00:41:32,987 --> 00:41:41,596
Speaker 0: And I'm like Busy, he's like we do Tuesday busy Wednesday busy Thursday packing for Friday, and he's like, I hate you Why he wants to play it.

663
00:41:41,777 --> 00:41:42,459
Speaker 1: I want to play it.

664
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,443
Speaker 0: All right.

665
00:41:43,463 --> 00:41:44,367
Speaker 0: Well, it's a two people game.

666
00:41:44,628 --> 00:41:47,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I'm thinking about buying it.

667
00:41:47,278 --> 00:41:48,763
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's just a core set.

668
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:50,690
Speaker 0: now that would be like buying netrunner at the start.

669
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this I might play because ship capital ships with momentum.

670
00:41:55,828 --> 00:42:02,698
Speaker 0: I Problem is is that even though there will be people in New York to play it with not that many not as many as regular Xcom or net run it doesn't had this note.

671
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,250
Speaker 0: You're not gonna find a lot of places with tables to play it on.

672
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you realize that's the same reason why I didn't buy pitch car?

673
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:14,732
Speaker 1: Actually, no, the only reason I didn't buy pitch cars because you get the full set is $300.

674
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,214
Speaker 0: Yeah rim.

675
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,465
Speaker 0: Let's just buy a house in this like a cabin in the sticks.

676
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,412
Speaker 0: Yep, and Use it.

677
00:42:20,814 --> 00:42:23,664
Speaker 0: use it for our partying and keep all the large games there.

678
00:42:23,785 --> 00:42:25,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was Scott?

679
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,436
Speaker 1: Remember the banana stand?

680
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:26,920
Speaker 1: fuck that.

681
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,007
Speaker 1: here's what we do Kevin.

682
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:29,736
Speaker 0: in the sticks We get everyone.

683
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,907
Speaker 1: we know who is in our exact situation.

684
00:42:31,948 --> 00:42:36,490
Speaker 1: in New York We all collectively buy a cabin like in the fucking Poconos somewhere.

685
00:42:36,711 --> 00:42:39,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it is just a board game Mecca.

686
00:42:39,939 --> 00:42:43,850
Speaker 1: sure that's actually probably cheaper than getting a storage unit in Manhattan.

687
00:42:44,253 --> 00:42:46,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's issues like tax insurance.

688
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,559
Speaker 1: Now those are Scott being electricity.

689
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,130
Speaker 1: I've looked into those things making sure it doesn't fall apart.

690
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:54,089
Speaker 0: We show up as squirrels living in there.

691
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,910
Speaker 1: uh, I Think those things are all manageable because remember why I was just in Lancaster for Zenk icon.

692
00:43:01,532 --> 00:43:08,530
Speaker 1: You forget how cheap everything is if you get even like 60 miles in any direction from where we are now way cheap.

693
00:43:09,193 --> 00:43:17,245
Speaker 1: I mean, I went to that farmers market and I bought what felt like a Ridiculous amount of high quality food and I had spent less than $20 on that.

694
00:43:17,265 --> 00:43:27,184
Speaker 1: Yep I got a beer and I handed the guy a 20 and he gave me a 10 back in my change Along with a five and a quarter.

695
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:27,667
Speaker 1: Whoa.

696
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:35,789
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah hahaha All right, see you guys at Anime Boston, please come play games with us.
