1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,052
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 27th 2015.

2
00:00:13,052 --> 00:00:13,553
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:15,921
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:18,870
Speaker 0: It's a tech news roundup mostly about Google.

5
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,408
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,282 --> 00:00:28,046
Speaker 0: And yeah, I know it's weird.

7
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,191
Speaker 0: We're doing a Monday show.

8
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:30,880
Speaker 0: This is the first time in a long long time.

9
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:31,566
Speaker 0: It's not broken.

10
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:39,520
Speaker 0: It's not supposed to be a Monday week Yes, but I was in London and Mumbai last week and I'm gonna be in Hong Kong next week, and I'm busy tomorrow.

11
00:00:39,944 --> 00:00:41,217
Speaker 0: so it was now or never.

12
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:43,666
Speaker 0: I Promise we'll be back in a normal schedule.

13
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,613
Speaker 1: We can do a Thursday show on Thursday.

14
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:45,833
Speaker 1: Yeah,

15
00:00:45,853 --> 00:01:16,808
Speaker 0: we can but after next week I'll be back from Hong Kong and I have no significant travel until Connecticut, but anyway, so a while ago I was talking about what phone I should buy and it was all speculative and I had to make the decision because When I got to London after Mumbai I landed I had a whole day of meetings the next day like all over the city And I hang my jacket up and I sit down I turn on my laptop and I start typing and doing like sending emails And then I hear a little chh Like glass shattering.

16
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,840
Speaker 0: Okay, that's weird.

17
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:24,529
Speaker 0: So I kind of look around the room and I'm like, you know when you hear weird noise I'm like looking and I kind of ignore it.

18
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:31,820
Speaker 0: and then later I go to get my phone Out of my jacket and the screen had literally exploded from air pressure or something.

19
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:33,935
Speaker 0: I mean that phone was a nexus.

20
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:40,700
Speaker 0: for that I brought to Australia like the previous Australia trip and I've beaten the shit out of that phone.

21
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,737
Speaker 0: I've dropped it a million times and it's just been invincible.

22
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:57,299
Speaker 0: I Imagine like there was some fault or some like micro fracture that had been there from all this collected damage and then flying a whole Bunch in a row and then like being in London and the temperatures and whatever just finally caused it to give up the ghost.

23
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,020
Speaker 0: so Let me tell you it is that was lit.

24
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:11,915
Speaker 0: there was the first time in a long long long time that I did not have a Smartphone in a situation where I expected to have a smartphone.

25
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,200
Speaker 1: Oh, it really sucks, doesn't it?

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what anyone who says like oh you should try the disconnected life like leave your smartphone at home like, you know fuck that.

27
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:23,646
Speaker 0: smartphones are a Necessary sense for the modern era.

28
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:30,079
Speaker 0: the the life that we led before we had always connected smartphones Was a disastrous life.

29
00:02:31,076 --> 00:02:32,689
Speaker 0: I Mean I had to like.

30
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:40,701
Speaker 0: the worst thing is I had all these meetings So suddenly I'd like go to Google Maps and like figure out where all the meetings were and how to get to them in Advance.

31
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:50,377
Speaker 0: that took like an hour when I could have just walked out the door the next day not giving a fuck And then I went to go to bed and I reached my phone to set an alarm.

32
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:51,220
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

33
00:02:51,601 --> 00:03:01,855
Speaker 0: So now I have to like figure out how to use this like jank ass Non-smart like radio phone in the room to get an alarm in the morning.

34
00:03:02,196 --> 00:03:03,760
Speaker 0: and you know what that UX was so bad.

35
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:11,634
Speaker 0: I was so Unconfident in my ability to do this that I set a test alarm For five minutes from them just to make sure the fucking thing worked.

36
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:12,860
Speaker 0: I didn't oversleep through my meeting.

37
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:13,868
Speaker 1: I would have done the same thing.

38
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,084
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Not having that phone?

39
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:21,660
Speaker 0: and the thing is everyone always says like oh not having the smartphone like you'll pay attention more.

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,308
Speaker 0: You won't be distracted by your phone at no point.

41
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,932
Speaker 0: Did I miss the phones?

42
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,397
Speaker 0: like Twitter garbage.

43
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,225
Speaker 0: that stuff's like Pleasant but not important.

44
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:39,759
Speaker 0: I missed maps getting phone calls getting emails and texts Looking things up like the stuff I actually use in my daily life.

45
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:45,136
Speaker 0: So yeah, I had to decide and I did in fact buy a new phone.

46
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:52,793
Speaker 0: I bought a used refurbished Nexus 5 Because literally it is still the best non iPhone money can buy.

47
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,800
Speaker 1: I why did you just get an iPhone?

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm kind of wait cuz I want to wait till September.

49
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,198
Speaker 1: but September it's gonna be like the iPhone 6s.

50
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,211
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like you're gonna be on the bad schedule.

51
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,216
Speaker 1: I'm on the good schedule.

52
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:05,160
Speaker 1: I get the major upgrade.

53
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:09,457
Speaker 0: I want to wait till September to see what happens because there might be a Sony like z4 z5 compact.

54
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:19,632
Speaker 0: so I I was very close to saying fuck it and trying the z3 Xperia compact because It was only they.

55
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:20,839
Speaker 0: the price has dropped so much.

56
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,861
Speaker 0: It was only like 80 bucks more than a used Nexus 4 or use Nexus 5 Like.

57
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:28,090
Speaker 0: it's not that expensive of a phone anymore.

58
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:36,255
Speaker 0: and hardware wise it is literally I think the best phone hardware on the market other than it doesn't have the best phone.

59
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:37,899
Speaker 0: that's reserved for the iPhone 6 plus.

60
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:52,078
Speaker 0: But despite the 5.0 Android update being available It still ships with 4/4 and I just could not trust that I would actually be able to get the upgrade.

61
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:55,039
Speaker 1: so fuck it Why don't you go get that one plus phone?

62
00:04:56,868 --> 00:05:06,107
Speaker 0: You know, honestly I just bought the cheapest phone that was gonna keep doing to hold out till September and see what the lay of the land is because Nexus's are so popular.

63
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:14,162
Speaker 0: if I fix my Nexus 4 screen I can still sell it for a lot of money like people really like the old Nexus 4 and 5.

64
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:15,489
Speaker 0: So I'm confident.

65
00:05:15,911 --> 00:05:25,160
Speaker 0: if some awesome phone comes out to September I can just resell this Nexus 5 for a reasonable amount of money And basically I'm paying like 50 bucks to rent a phone for half a year.

66
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:34,224
Speaker 1: It is surprising to me how it's like it used to be where the only kind of things you would repair would be purely mechanical things like cars or You know computers.

67
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:38,697
Speaker 1: desktop computers like laptops were mostly unrepairable except for some parts.

68
00:05:39,178 --> 00:05:43,440
Speaker 1: right TVs You didn't really repair once they became LCDs instead of CRTs.

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:56,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm cheap like people stopped repairing things But with phones like I'm seeing the comeback of repairing and a lot of people are making Repairs to phone self-included that are quite successful and inexpensive.

70
00:05:57,662 --> 00:06:04,149
Speaker 0: One phones break more often - they break in it like the majority of breakages are within a Fine band like

71
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:05,659
Speaker 1: it's such heavy usage that they break

72
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:16,099
Speaker 0: How many fucking million things can go wrong like you drop a laptop like just roll the dice on like You know crit to center torso crit to left torso.

73
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:27,683
Speaker 0: But with a phone like most of the time screen shattered it's replaceable Back's shattered.

74
00:06:27,743 --> 00:06:29,108
Speaker 0: It's replaceable battery breaks.

75
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,433
Speaker 0: It's replaceable motherboard.

76
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:30,954
Speaker 0: Well, fuck it.

77
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:31,456
Speaker 0: It's done.

78
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:34,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Enough of like.

79
00:06:34,225 --> 00:06:41,640
Speaker 0: there's such a narrow band of things that break and most of those things are fixable Unlike more complex technology like a laptop that just has a lot more.

80
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:47,800
Speaker 1: Mostly just the fact that it's so small and tight and cramped that it's not like a computer is also complex.

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,380
Speaker 1: But a desktop you can open it up and really get a lot of air and space to move around in there.

82
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:58,268
Speaker 1: A human being can work on it, but I don't fix a laptop because like you open it up It's like well not getting back together.

83
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:04,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if I spill coffee in my keyboard I just buy a new keyboard and plug it into the USB port you spill coffee in your laptop.

84
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:06,509
Speaker 0: That's like a $400 like keyboard.

85
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:08,356
Speaker 1: really what if you spill coffee on that mixer there?

86
00:07:08,376 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 1: It's like how you gonna fix it?

87
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,426
Speaker 0: I would just cry right though.

88
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,914
Speaker 0: Actually that mixer is eminently repairable.

89
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,620
Speaker 0: It comes with a full schematic.

90
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:18,760
Speaker 1: Full one sure, but it's still a huge pain in the ass.

91
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,120
Speaker 0: But the only digital part is in this top right corner here, so all the rest of this shit?

92
00:07:23,384 --> 00:07:24,160
Speaker 1: Oh, it's just analog bit.

93
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,519
Speaker 0: I could probably just like wash it with solvent let it dry and then it would just work again.

94
00:07:29,861 --> 00:07:37,699
Speaker 0: Maybe like I've repaired that kind of equipment many times in my life and like bits are much easier to fix Yeah, and most audio is analog.

95
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:43,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so yeah, but otherwise like you know we just did our episode FPGA.

96
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:56,046
Speaker 0: so I was on a panel talking about FPGAs with like a bunch of big like a guy from solar flare was on the panel and a guy from like one of the Indian Stock Exchange is and My cursory research was apparently correct.

97
00:07:56,107 --> 00:08:00,639
Speaker 0: everyone seems to agree that like Intel Phi and like Nvidia CUDA Tesla stuff is the future.

98
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,996
Speaker 0: and FPGAs I realized something that I didn't think about because the solar flag.

99
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:07,121
Speaker 0: I brought this up FPGAs.

100
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:12,552
Speaker 0: people like to say oh like they're they're faster They're not they're just more efficient clock speed.

101
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,320
Speaker 0: wise FPGAs are slow as shit.

102
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:15,380
Speaker 1: Yeah No Yeah.

103
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:23,304
Speaker 0: But a lot of people seem to gloss over that when they talk about the power of FPGAs and this guy like basically laid the Smackdown.

104
00:08:23,344 --> 00:08:26,236
Speaker 1: the clock speed doesn't you know equate to real performance.

105
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,120
Speaker 1: We've known that forever.

106
00:08:27,402 --> 00:08:37,280
Speaker 0: Well except you know like a Pentium 4 Overclocked like 5 gigahertz for a lot of the things that my industry does is Actually better than modern multi core chips if your software is written for that.

107
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:48,911
Speaker 0: Which is most because a lot of these things are just bytes in process bytes out like network card in process network card out and Those calculations are not parallel because they can't be mmm.

108
00:08:49,734 --> 00:08:51,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you ever see a parallel network card.

109
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:52,671
Speaker 1: It's called two network cards.

110
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:55,285
Speaker 0: Yeah They're fancy network card.

111
00:08:55,325 --> 00:09:00,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's two network cards on one piece of circuit, but I'm saying like the financial calculation, but anyway I digress.

112
00:09:03,282 --> 00:09:05,720
Speaker 0: So the only other thing I got that was kind of interesting is tech wise.

113
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:14,728
Speaker 0: you know Scott and I use a lot of technology to make our video shows like all this other stuff and even geek nights, but We have to do everything ourselves.

114
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:17,720
Speaker 0: It's just us guys like we don't have anyone else.

115
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,527
Speaker 0: So for one of the first times in my life.

116
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:33,113
Speaker 0: I showed up at a video shoot where professionals met me Set up all the shit and literally all I had to do like it all and in time I showed up they gave me a briefing on.

117
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:34,621
Speaker 0: here's what we're going to ask You.

118
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,153
Speaker 0: give us at most two to three minute answers for each one of.

119
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,158
Speaker 1: look at this camera.

120
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,526
Speaker 0: Yes There will be two cameras.

121
00:09:40,767 --> 00:09:42,514
Speaker 0: They stood me where I had to stand.

122
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:43,820
Speaker 0: They told me where to look.

123
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,060
Speaker 0: They told me how to like hold my posture.

124
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,600
Speaker 0: They told me when to start and stop and then when I was done talking.

125
00:09:50,082 --> 00:09:51,349
Speaker 0: Then I said was that good enough?

126
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:52,475
Speaker 0: and they said yes, it's fine.

127
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:57,735
Speaker 0: We shook hands I walked away and someone else put that shit into Premiere and edited together.

128
00:09:57,955 --> 00:10:00,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the video, you know They didn't use Final Cut.

129
00:10:00,971 --> 00:10:02,319
Speaker 0: I know they used Premiere because I talked to them.

130
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:04,900
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz I was like, oh you got this kind of microphone.

131
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:06,667
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, yeah Well, cuz this other kind of microphone.

132
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:11,009
Speaker 0: and I was like I see you're just using DSLRs as your studio cameras.

133
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:15,146
Speaker 0: and it was like, yeah, there's literally no reason why You're not making movies.

134
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, making some crappy video for a website.

135
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:24,314
Speaker 0: So yeah technology is great But as much as Scott and I are like like the whole point of geek nights is Renaissance.

136
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:40,420
Speaker 0: geeks like know about everything When you start to do a lot of stuff you've got to find friends who are experts at the things that you don't have time to be experts at because you literally Cannot be an expert at everything and do everything efficiently unless you don't have a job.

137
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:43,032
Speaker 1: I was trying to use After Effects the other day.

138
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't for shit.

139
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:51,260
Speaker 1: I actually sort of I'm beginning to understand like the fundamentals of how it works But I still can't make anything that looks good.

140
00:10:51,682 --> 00:11:01,120
Speaker 1: I made I even found a tutorial on YouTube and copied it exactly Like step by step like the exact numbers and everything that guy was doing and mine didn't look the same.

141
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:11,490
Speaker 0: I made a motion graphic But in After Effects that would have like a lower third like kind of come in and then fade out like and I could like use That but it took me so long.

142
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 0: It was easier to just like do that with premieres animations.

143
00:11:15,828 --> 00:11:17,972
Speaker 0: so But yeah, yep.

144
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:29,959
Speaker 0: So anyway things of the day.

145
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:34,100
Speaker 0: So I got a thing of the day called the button but it's not the reddit button.

146
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,836
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with the reddit button, which miraculously is still going.

147
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:39,358
Speaker 0: Okay.

148
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,193
Speaker 0: Good God I convinced Emily to push the button - okay.

149
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,760
Speaker 0: She was like I was talking about the body.

150
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,787
Speaker 0: She was like should I push it?

151
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:53,020
Speaker 0: and I was like It's like when the when the dad or the mom has the kid and the kids like should I play these German board games?

152
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,386
Speaker 0: And you're like, yes I miss come.

153
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:56,733
Speaker 0: Emily was like should I push the button?

154
00:11:56,753 --> 00:11:59,865
Speaker 0: and I was like, all right Here is how to push the button.

155
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:08,560
Speaker 0: But now this is a video, you know, the peasant box moral conundrum Like here's a button like a box with a button on it.

156
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,753
Speaker 0: If you push the button a peasant somewhere in the world dies and you get a million dollars.

157
00:12:13,395 --> 00:12:13,656
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

158
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:15,000
Speaker 0: Would you push the button?

159
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,405
Speaker 0: So that questions of a day.

160
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:17,626
Speaker 1: it is.

161
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:18,167
Speaker 1: Yeah.

162
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:18,448
Speaker 0: Yeah.

163
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,636
Speaker 1: No feeling this has my mood.

164
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:27,040
Speaker 0: this video is The best exploration of that question I have ever seen.

165
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:28,833
Speaker 0: You should just watch it.

166
00:12:28,893 --> 00:12:29,780
Speaker 0: It's two minutes long.

167
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:31,850
Speaker 0: I don't want to just watch this video.

168
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:41,920
Speaker 0: and then before you watch it Just think to yourself would you press the press the peasant box button and then watch this video and see if you jive with our protagonists?

169
00:12:42,841 --> 00:12:48,240
Speaker 0: There's a moment where he exclaims solved because he solved the button and then he acts on his solution.

170
00:12:49,082 --> 00:12:52,072
Speaker 1: It's beautiful use of the money to buy a thing that resurrects pendants.

171
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,420
Speaker 0: just watch the video anyway.

172
00:12:56,062 --> 00:13:06,857
Speaker 1: so I have a highbrow thing of the day as a scientist here and He's upset about I mean, it seems like pedantry at first like he's complaining sort of.

173
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:07,820
Speaker 1: he's not complaining, right?

174
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,159
Speaker 1: He's a well-spoken science II kind of guy, right?

175
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:20,500
Speaker 1: Science man, yeah He's complaining about like what the word intelligence means what the word stupidity means what ignorance means, right?

176
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:28,186
Speaker 1: It's like the differences between them and about how you know our models of you know, what, you know make someone Intelligent right?

177
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:35,130
Speaker 1: He's like, you know, it brings up a lot of interesting topics like, you know Well, like IQ tests are biased toward like more affluent people.

178
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,377
Speaker 1: obviously that's like the obvious parts, right?

179
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:43,880
Speaker 1: But he talks about like How come a scientist is intelligent but an athlete is skilled, right?

180
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:52,671
Speaker 1: We're trying to create a monopoly on, you know intelligence for people who you know Sit and think and do maths and science, but he's like no the athlete has.

181
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,100
Speaker 1: intelligence is just you know intelligence of the body.

182
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:58,790
Speaker 0: Think about machine intelligence.

183
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:07,216
Speaker 0: watch some football player, you know soccer and Then watch robots trying to do that like robots can't figure that shit out.

184
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:10,409
Speaker 1: So yeah, it's just a guy Scientist guy, what's his name?

185
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,112
Speaker 1: It's in the link.

186
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:14,725
Speaker 0: I can't look at the link because I'm Installing my phone right now.

187
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:22,983
Speaker 1: David crack our maybe at least that's the name in the URL Androids updating to 444 and then to 50.

188
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:23,244
Speaker 0: You know what?

189
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,052
Speaker 0: The saddest thing is right before that phone broke.

190
00:14:25,634 --> 00:14:31,637
Speaker 0: I had just upgraded it to 5.1. even a phone as ancient as the Nexus 4 got Android 5.1.

191
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:37,400
Speaker 1: But anyway, yeah His name is David crack our the systems theorist explains what's wrong with standard models of intelligence.

192
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:41,971
Speaker 1: He answers questions as thought-provoking as what is genius?

193
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:45,460
Speaker 1: Why do you use the word intelligence to describe gifted athletes?

194
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,335
Speaker 1: Do you worry as some people do the super smart machines will come to dominate the human species?

195
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:51,740
Speaker 0: No, I hope that day happens.

196
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:56,198
Speaker 1: Why do we need the science of complexity to tackle the most difficult questions all kinds of?

197
00:14:59,302 --> 00:15:01,718
Speaker 0: That last one was particularly funny, yeah.

198
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:10,033
Speaker 1: So, yeah this guy You know It's typical sort of highbrow philosophy science guy and his videos were.

199
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:12,660
Speaker 1: it was interesting to hear his answers to these questions.

200
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:19,099
Speaker 0: Okay, so my thing of the day the first one of the first comments on YouTube is my brother died because of him.

201
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:21,389
Speaker 0: Okay, that's clever.

202
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,626
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, so It's a tech news roundup.

203
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:25,912
Speaker 0: But first the meta moment.

204
00:15:25,952 --> 00:15:27,580
Speaker 0: the book club book is still water ship down.

205
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:28,985
Speaker 1: I read more of it.

206
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:31,554
Speaker 0: Ooh, so are they still at the cult rabbits?

207
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:33,320
Speaker 0: No, so they got past that.

208
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:34,908
Speaker 1: They ran away from the cult rabbits.

209
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,340
Speaker 0: Oh, so now they run into the fascist rabbits.

210
00:15:37,722 --> 00:15:41,360
Speaker 1: No, the rabbits that they used to know back in the day came and visited them.

211
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,370
Speaker 0: Oh and it turns out that Fiverr was right.

212
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,233
Speaker 0: shit went down.

213
00:15:45,313 --> 00:15:47,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't see any fascist rabbits yet.

214
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,209
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they're basically their biggest concern.

215
00:15:50,229 --> 00:15:52,136
Speaker 0: They're gonna be like wow, we fucking did it.

216
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:53,480
Speaker 0: Everything's great.

217
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:55,927
Speaker 0: There's no girl rabbits here.

218
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:56,971
Speaker 0: we're literally.

219
00:15:57,051 --> 00:15:59,080
Speaker 1: I realized that like a couple chapters ago.

220
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:01,430
Speaker 0: They realize it as soon as they have time to rest.

221
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,515
Speaker 0: They're like, ah shit.

222
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,058
Speaker 0: Ah Shit, and then their next plan is how do we get some ladies to come?

223
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,105
Speaker 1: Tell them how awesome it is.

224
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:13,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they have two plans and it's kind of This is where the book starts to get really good.

225
00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:16,586
Speaker 1: Okay Whatever you say.

226
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:17,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good book.

227
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:18,216
Speaker 1: Okay.

228
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:18,799
Speaker 0: I really liked it.

229
00:16:19,141 --> 00:16:22,500
Speaker 0: I liked it about as much as I like The Hobbit you like going out to get girl rabbits.

230
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe depends on that's the good part.

231
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,840
Speaker 0: depends on the girl rabbit.

232
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:27,663
Speaker 0: It's the good part.

233
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,274
Speaker 0: some good stuff goes down with the girl rabbit stuff.

234
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:30,877
Speaker 0: Okay.

235
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:34,471
Speaker 0: Yeah So, uh, we haven't picked the next book club book yet.

236
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:34,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have.

237
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:36,679
Speaker 0: well Scott has but he won't tell us what it is.

238
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,125
Speaker 1: Okay, finish this one first.

239
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

240
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,515
Speaker 0: I'm reading a lot of books.

241
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:41,419
Speaker 1: I'm gonna finish it soon.

242
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,815
Speaker 0: We have no conventions until Connecticut.

243
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:48,069
Speaker 0: Thank Jesus I needed time off from conventions.

244
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:56,160
Speaker 0: if you want us to appear at a convention We're looking for another anime convention maybe because we only do basically one a year.

245
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:57,845
Speaker 1: So send money.

246
00:16:58,146 --> 00:16:59,310
Speaker 0: we made a bunch of like.

247
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,535
Speaker 0: we kept making like.

248
00:17:00,575 --> 00:17:07,280
Speaker 0: we have awesome anime panels But we basically do them at anime Boston and Connecticut and maybe Zenkai Khan.

249
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:09,749
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, we write a panel for our packs.

250
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,536
Speaker 0: We do it at like seven conventions.

251
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:24,440
Speaker 0: So Feeling salty about putting all this work into these awesome panels just to do like once or twice Mm-hmm, but at the same time you've got to be a real anime con like at least 10 or 15 thousand people.

252
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:26,058
Speaker 1: So it's only a few of those.

253
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:36,916
Speaker 1: Yeah We're talking at least Thousands of people right and the closer to us it is the smaller it can be and the more money you give us the smaller You know what as long as a few hundred people will show up like in the panel rooms.

254
00:17:37,298 --> 00:17:37,880
Speaker 0: That's enough.

255
00:17:38,021 --> 00:17:44,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you have games that we can play when we're not doing panels, that's good, too Yeah, and if there's good food near you, that's also good.

256
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, and don't be SDCC because I just really don't ever ever want to go to SDCC.

257
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,138
Speaker 0: Yeah or soccer account.

258
00:17:51,158 --> 00:17:54,938
Speaker 0: Sorry guys Sorry guys, not going to - con either.

259
00:17:57,101 --> 00:18:00,130
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it is a tech news round.

260
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:01,254
Speaker 1: last time we did this.

261
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:06,395
Speaker 1: it might seem like we're lazy doing this But in fact the last time we did it was in May of 2014 a year ago.

262
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,789
Speaker 0: Wow, that clock rings every year about.

263
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,763
Speaker 1: this clock seems to ring about once a year I'm sure.

264
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:19,797
Speaker 1: if you search for tech news roundup on our site It seems as if it's an annual thing about this time because it must be a confluence of.

265
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:25,408
Speaker 0: I wonder if like a lot of News comes around this time at least old with our dearth of ideas We have a suit.

266
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,359
Speaker 1: the dearth of ideas right now is worse than ever.

267
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:34,999
Speaker 0: But when we have a dearth like that, sometimes we'll come up with like basically if there's no news Then we'll come up with some bullshit idea.

268
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,720
Speaker 0: But if there's a ton of news we go.

269
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,060
Speaker 0: Oh, duh tech news roundup and there was like there was more news than we have time to talk about Whatever.

270
00:18:43,045 --> 00:18:53,857
Speaker 0: So first things first Google is involved in a lot of these but Google is being sued Because the by who by I can't tell.

271
00:18:53,878 --> 00:19:01,103
Speaker 0: okay But the problem that is being described is that the median age of employees at Google is 29.

272
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:04,983
Speaker 0: Thus clearly age discrimination Maybe.

273
00:19:05,003 --> 00:19:08,501
Speaker 0: now what's funny is I did actually interview at Google recently Like.

274
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:12,460
Speaker 0: I went through that whole process because some recruiters just wouldn't shut up and kept bothering me.

275
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:17,678
Speaker 0: So I like I went to like the phone screening and I went in and spent like this whole day with all.

276
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,957
Speaker 1: they bother me A bunch too and they keep bothering me occasionally and every time they bother me.

277
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,038
Speaker 1: I'm like yo Like I really don't want to work a lot.

278
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:27,290
Speaker 1: How's that gonna be?

279
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:34,074
Speaker 0: and they're like, oh Okay, nevermind Wow Scott here because the people I talked to were like that's pretty much fine.

280
00:19:34,134 --> 00:19:42,660
Speaker 0: We're a hundred percent results focused and The kind of job it would have been was actually like very much like these people don't seem to show up too early.

281
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:46,300
Speaker 1: How do you what exact words you use to tell them that you don't want to work?

282
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,139
Speaker 0: I pretty much said I'm not even actually looking for work right now.

283
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:51,243
Speaker 1: I came

284
00:19:51,323 --> 00:20:00,660
Speaker 0: in because your recruiters kept bothering me and I might be able to do a show about this, by the way I have all these other jobs that I have to be able to keep doing that have significant time like

285
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,470
Speaker 1: See what I tell them is I say basically.

286
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,072
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:20:04,112 --> 00:20:06,219
Speaker 1: Look, I don't give a shit about what your company does.

288
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:09,379
Speaker 1: I really will never care about anything that you do.

289
00:20:10,002 --> 00:20:14,660
Speaker 1: I'm really only interested in leaving where I am now if it is a significant life upgrade.

290
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,994
Speaker 1: Those are the words that I use and people are like, well, maybe we are.

291
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:24,820
Speaker 1: some people are like, oh, okay Never mind, and some people are like, oh, well, maybe we are a significant life upgrade like Pandora called me and Pandora.

292
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:26,988
Speaker 1: Actually, that's a good backup plan.

293
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:31,848
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and they were like, yeah, you know, you know We just work whatever hours.

294
00:20:31,968 --> 00:20:33,997
Speaker 1: the guy told me like yeah, his daughter was sick.

295
00:20:34,037 --> 00:20:42,548
Speaker 1: He just left work No problem, you know for many days because they're totally cool like that and they pay enough and everyone in the office is cool And I'm like that all sounds great.

296
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:43,914
Speaker 1: That's perfectly fine.

297
00:20:43,954 --> 00:20:45,420
Speaker 1: But that's exactly what I have now.

298
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,825
Speaker 1: That's not an upgrade an upgrade.

299
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:49,775
Speaker 1: an upgrade would be I work three days a week every week no matter what.

300
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:59,280
Speaker 1: and if I'm sick You know, and he's like, oh I see I'm like, but you know what if my company like falls apart or something I'm totally gonna call you because that sounds like a horizontal move.

301
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's the thing is like I'm looking.

302
00:21:01,446 --> 00:21:03,232
Speaker 0: I'm like up if the ship is sinking.

303
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:09,660
Speaker 0: move horizontally to another ship if the ship is Not sinking only get on a helicopter or a space rocket, right?

304
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:12,912
Speaker 1: It's like I'm looking, you know, everyone who calls me none of them.

305
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:16,669
Speaker 1: when I say significant life upgrade They don't have a significant life upgrade.

306
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:17,695
Speaker 0: I should start using that term.

307
00:21:17,835 --> 00:21:34,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway If the median age is 29 I'm already like way older than the average Google employee and more importantly in the interviews The majority of the people I talked to were way younger than me and they were interviewing me To be them

308
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:38,620
Speaker 1: because anyone who's noticed people who are old tend to leave Google, right?

309
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,331
Speaker 1: It's like they're really appealing to.

310
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,644
Speaker 1: you know, if I just came straight out of college I would have run to Google like.

311
00:21:44,664 --> 00:21:45,245
Speaker 1: yes, please.

312
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,493
Speaker 1: Oh my god, let my college life continue.

313
00:21:47,593 --> 00:21:52,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but now that I'm old It's like Google.

314
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:59,248
Speaker 1: I don't even want to work for you unless you give me like a double life upgrade cuz seriously Seriously well, well, that's the thing is like.

315
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:06,960
Speaker 1: is it actually discrimination or is it's just that they've structured their company in such a way That old people don't want to work there except for these ones that are suing?

316
00:22:07,262 --> 00:22:10,320
Speaker 0: So the interesting thing is everyone I talked to like I was real candid.

317
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,045
Speaker 0: I was like look here's the deal.

318
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:17,442
Speaker 0: and they were pretty candid too and it seems like their biggest focus as a company is Retention.

319
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:21,100
Speaker 0: like they will do anything to get people to stay working there, right?

320
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:26,395
Speaker 1: Since they lost their deal with Facebook not to poach no poaching policy is gone.

321
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:35,268
Speaker 0: They've got a retention abilities Yep, I don't know that's a separate that we should do a show on like tech industry poaching non-compete stuff Mm-hmm, cuz we've never talked about that.

322
00:22:35,308 --> 00:22:36,454
Speaker 0: Oh dad law show.

323
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:41,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a Thursday Anyway, but anyway, they but I so not to get derailed onto that right now.

324
00:22:42,504 --> 00:22:44,080
Speaker 0: But you know, it's good.

325
00:22:44,281 --> 00:23:04,599
Speaker 0: I interview a lot of people too and it's really hard For me to fall on either side of this issue because I do know older developers who were smart But at the same time and all my experience an older developer who knows like modern technology will be hired in a second Way before a younger developer with similar skills.

326
00:23:04,932 --> 00:23:12,400
Speaker 0: Yep Because like a lot of like there may be aspects of the industry that I don't bump into where the younger we're in, New York.

327
00:23:12,481 --> 00:23:14,800
Speaker 1: This is the California attitude that goes on here, right?

328
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,800
Speaker 1: Silicon Valley types the people that I can't stand the ones that are calling me that I'm asking for a significant life up.

329
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I want him to fuck up.

330
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:26,400
Speaker 0: people say like Silicon Valley is the big start-up land But New York is an equally big start-up land.

331
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,497
Speaker 1: It's just the startups in New York are at least some of them, you know are more reasonable.

332
00:23:31,517 --> 00:23:32,500
Speaker 1: They're real companies.

333
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,340
Speaker 0: They make real things and they pay money instead of dreams and lottery.

334
00:23:36,661 --> 00:23:42,060
Speaker 1: And usually the thing is in Silicon Valley the companies that people are starting up are technology companies, right?

335
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,345
Speaker 1: They put technology first.

336
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:44,490
Speaker 1: It's like what is their company?

337
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:46,820
Speaker 1: Our company is to make this software, right?

338
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,650
Speaker 1: That is what we do in New York.

339
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,419
Speaker 1: Most of the companies that are in New York We have a real business doing a real thing.

340
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:58,936
Speaker 1: But we need people who are computer people because we're a company we have fucking computers.

341
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,120
Speaker 1: We need computer people, right?

342
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, I work at Broadway.com.

343
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:02,050
Speaker 1: What the fuck do we do?

344
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,640
Speaker 1: We sell tickets, right?

345
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,340
Speaker 1: It's a real business that makes real money, but we have a website.

346
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,647
Speaker 1: Obviously, yeah, it needs working on.

347
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:12,352
Speaker 1: you know, it's like rim.

348
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:17,467
Speaker 1: you work at a financial company you do financial stuff Which is somewhat of a real business.

349
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:21,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could argue about that, but it's more real business than Twitter.

350
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:24,820
Speaker 0: You know what it is because we don't we sell software and we sell services.

351
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:28,840
Speaker 0: We sell a thing and we just use technology to make those things, right?

352
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,422
Speaker 1: It's like you could.

353
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:30,826
Speaker 1: a lot of people I know in New York.

354
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:44,516
Speaker 1: They work for like, you know a TV station or Bloomberg or You know some real company that does a real business That makes real money and then that because it's a cut they have technology.

355
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:48,710
Speaker 1: we work the New York Times They do technology at the New York Times, which is a real business.

356
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but yeah, but it is not a real business.

357
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,419
Speaker 0: So that's my point.

358
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:10,568
Speaker 0: Is that like if I'm interviewing and there's an older person a younger person and they have equivalent experience then it comes down like attitude And personality and everything while there probably are some predatory practices like trying to hire young single people Who they know will work for less Yes or more or be willing to stay

359
00:25:10,588 --> 00:25:11,752
Speaker 1: late spend more hours

360
00:25:11,892 --> 00:25:12,294
Speaker 0: because like

361
00:25:12,474 --> 00:25:13,036
Speaker 1: care more

362
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:24,080
Speaker 0: I have noticed that Everyone I've ever interacted with in finance and just in tech in general who is married with kids Takes way more time off like a lot more time off.

363
00:25:24,225 --> 00:25:25,303
Speaker 1: Yeah I can dare.

364
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:30,926
Speaker 1: in my office right to my right is a person who is an intern with us and now graduated college and that Works for us.

365
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:33,703
Speaker 1: that person is Eager beaver.

366
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:42,479
Speaker 1: no to my left is a person who's married as a kid as a kid on the way You know, not really much, you know, pretty much our age, right?

367
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,425
Speaker 1: Not in the office today.

368
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:45,169
Speaker 0: Yep.

369
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:46,959
Speaker 1: It is a hundred percent true.

370
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,308
Speaker 0: No, do you know how many people like work from home today?

371
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:52,340
Speaker 0: because of like today the office was like a barren wasteland.

372
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, many people were not there today.

373
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,840
Speaker 0: But at the same time those people get about the same amount of work done.

374
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:02,866
Speaker 1: I've found Gets about the same matter.

375
00:26:02,886 --> 00:26:03,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the thing.

376
00:26:03,649 --> 00:26:04,694
Speaker 0: Like I tell I like.

377
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,020
Speaker 0: I've never been the eager beaver.

378
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:13,246
Speaker 0: I've acted like the old guy with family except I just go home play video games or like, you know Like do my laundry or whatever.

379
00:26:13,266 --> 00:26:17,779
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't really do work most of the day in like the last hour I just did a few things.

380
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:22,108
Speaker 1: It's like I do a lot of things in a very short amount of time and I'm just spending a lot of time at work Doing nothing.

381
00:26:22,352 --> 00:26:22,575
Speaker 1: Yeah

382
00:26:23,702 --> 00:26:42,237
Speaker 0: So it's hard to say with this because in my experience a lot of the older people that I'd like interact with that aren't Skilled like they're worthless employees like they don't know anything about modern code Like I couldn't imagine hiring them but a young person who was that ignorant of modern practices.

383
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:43,220
Speaker 0: I would also not hire.

384
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:49,415
Speaker 1: well, I think the thing is I Want to hire the old people to get them to do stuff that they know.

385
00:26:49,435 --> 00:26:52,480
Speaker 1: it's like hey, yeah I need these Linux servers administered.

386
00:26:52,684 --> 00:26:53,298
Speaker 1: Please do that.

387
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:59,280
Speaker 1: But a trend I notice in the tech industry is this DevOps thing that suddenly became all right.

388
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,224
Speaker 0: Don't get me fight.

389
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,340
Speaker 0: Let's do a Monday show on that fucking word suddenly became a fucking word.

390
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,897
Speaker 1: It basically means don't have system administrators just have the developers.

391
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:08,680
Speaker 1: do all that work.

392
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:13,374
Speaker 1: All your shits in the cloud anyway, you don't have computers lying around.

393
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,860
Speaker 0: there's an argument around that.

394
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,887
Speaker 0: But the way I would put it is your ops.

395
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,460
Speaker 0: people should also all know how to write code and be smart about tech.

396
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:30,356
Speaker 1: They shouldn't just be like system administration certificate certification anyway, but yeah the and that's killing the jobs that a lot of those older type people did.

397
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:36,433
Speaker 1: who you know is Administers some Unix for us, you know trying to like get you know Cuz they can write.

398
00:27:36,677 --> 00:27:42,400
Speaker 1: you know The kind of code that they write when you're older developer is not modern and only some of them have kept up their skills.

399
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,604
Speaker 1: So here's a problem.

400
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:46,092
Speaker 0: No one young knows how to administer a Linux server for shit.

401
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:47,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely true.

402
00:27:48,018 --> 00:27:50,870
Speaker 1: They don't know anything Yeah, and they don't know Unix at all.

403
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:52,720
Speaker 1: the intern guy he can't even Unix.

404
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:58,197
Speaker 0: Yeah Like no one can like I when I like everyone I to interview like barely knows like.

405
00:27:58,217 --> 00:27:59,160
Speaker 0: they can't script.

406
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,488
Speaker 0: They don't know bash.

407
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,400
Speaker 0: they can use like VI and edit text files.

408
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,091
Speaker 1: I'm like only me and the IT guys.

409
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:07,360
Speaker 1: the two IT guys are the only ones who know how to Unix.

410
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,284
Speaker 1: But here's the problem.

411
00:28:08,344 --> 00:28:11,077
Speaker 1: other people can't Unix people my age like 30s.

412
00:28:12,601 --> 00:28:16,180
Speaker 0: We do not want to be Linux system administrators anymore.

413
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,160
Speaker 0: Like I don't want to do that job because while I'm really good at it, I don't like doing it.

414
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,880
Speaker 1: It's not I don't want to do it, but I'm very upset if it's not done, right?

415
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,619
Speaker 1: Yep, so I can't leave it to anyone fucking else.

416
00:28:27,901 --> 00:28:32,217
Speaker 0: You realize whenever someone asks me like for help like like hey the QA servers acting funny.

417
00:28:32,237 --> 00:28:32,860
Speaker 0: Can you look at it?

418
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:40,574
Speaker 0: I usually say no because if I say yes, I see how it's set up and I spend a day fixing it Yep, and then once I touch it, it's mine.

419
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,471
Speaker 0: So yep There's a few servers in the company that are mine.

420
00:28:43,531 --> 00:28:45,886
Speaker 1: now as soon as it's not yours You know what happens.

421
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:50,727
Speaker 1: the clock's gonna be off Five minutes that fucking clock.

422
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:54,639
Speaker 1: It's always actually had a wrong clock the other day and I went to your tumbler and I fixed it.

423
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I'm telling you this shit's easy.

424
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:58,259
Speaker 0: And you know what?

425
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,203
Speaker 0: Why can't people just?

426
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:01,368
Speaker 0: why can't I hurt people like you?

427
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,154
Speaker 0: Just alright, you can hire me.

428
00:29:03,195 --> 00:29:04,680
Speaker 1: Give me a significant life upgrade.

429
00:29:05,005 --> 00:29:05,898
Speaker 0: I'll give you more money.

430
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:13,120
Speaker 1: That's not a significant life upgrade unless it's enough money to buy a luxury condo in the Queen's area.

431
00:29:14,422 --> 00:29:15,287
Speaker 1: Is it that much money?

432
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:18,060
Speaker 1: so yeah anyway, I guess it's not that much money.

433
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:22,639
Speaker 0: So I don't have a luxury condo in the Queen's area and you're not gonna make more than me.

434
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:23,722
Speaker 1: Yeah I need to me.

435
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:35,060
Speaker 1: I need a basically a signing bonus for the down payment and then a salary that can pay the monthly and My existing salary on top of that, but I see there is a real problem here because I don't want to stay on this news forever.

436
00:29:35,161 --> 00:29:37,313
Speaker 0: But like, you know the point I was getting at.

437
00:29:37,354 --> 00:29:38,299
Speaker 0: we kept getting distracted.

438
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:42,292
Speaker 0: The older like older people like me and Scott.

439
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,340
Speaker 0: we're above the median age of Google.

440
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,760
Speaker 0: We're super good at the things that like people need done.

441
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:53,300
Speaker 0: But at the same time a lot of the things we're good at are not things we want to do as jobs.

442
00:29:53,842 --> 00:30:02,160
Speaker 0: So even if someone like if someone like me we're looking for work I would might not even apply to like Linux system administrator jobs.

443
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:11,058
Speaker 0: So you're gonna end up hiring Younger people who learn it because no one no one who's older is willing to do the job at the salary You're willing to pay.

444
00:30:11,654 --> 00:30:23,660
Speaker 0: Yep I expect a bigger salary being old as do most people in my third in the 30s like that's like that is the peak time of You expect a lot of money because like you've made that money for a long time and you've been always getting raises.

445
00:30:23,961 --> 00:30:27,934
Speaker 1: Are you gonna someone gonna sue the farm for like, you know racial discrimination?

446
00:30:27,954 --> 00:30:29,600
Speaker 1: They only hire immigrants.

447
00:30:30,182 --> 00:30:32,549
Speaker 1: It's like well, I mean, it's not.

448
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:36,360
Speaker 0: they're paying minimum wage to do literally back-breaking labor, right?

449
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,305
Speaker 1: It's not that Americans and other people have you know from other countries don't want to do the work They don't want to do it.

450
00:30:42,345 --> 00:30:43,972
Speaker 1: They don't want to do it at that salary.

451
00:30:43,992 --> 00:30:51,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, and only those people will See also my actual increasing Worry about h1 B's.

452
00:30:51,726 --> 00:31:02,360
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of are just a big scam for American companies to not pay To get indentured servants to do IT for them locally because that's always what they've been.

453
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:04,366
Speaker 1: That is always what those have been.

454
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:08,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they're very rarely are they actually to get someone.

455
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,704
Speaker 1: cuz it's a big country Why would we?

456
00:31:09,986 --> 00:31:12,160
Speaker 1: we have someone in this country somewhere who can do what you need?

457
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,819
Speaker 1: You don't need to hire someone from a tiny country.

458
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:19,277
Speaker 0: In fact as much as I complain like a lot of people like I just interview or like other people I know interview like just Don't know shit.

459
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:29,618
Speaker 0: It's usually because the salaries like if you double what you're willing to pay You'll find someone who can do that job the next day in New York at least.

460
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:29,999
Speaker 1: yeah.

461
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:34,072
Speaker 1: So yeah, all right, let's move on to more tech news about Google.

462
00:31:34,092 --> 00:31:34,794
Speaker 0: So I watch.

463
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,280
Speaker 0: let's skip Google come back to Google.

464
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:37,645
Speaker 1: All right guy watches out.

465
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:38,407
Speaker 0: Yeah.

466
00:31:38,668 --> 00:31:40,715
Speaker 1: So here's the thing about the I watch the watch itself.

467
00:31:40,795 --> 00:31:42,080
Speaker 1: There's nothing really to say about it.

468
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:42,643
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

469
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:44,879
Speaker 0: I think the pebble is gonna be better for like what I do.

470
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:52,353
Speaker 1: Yeah for normal person the pebbles probably but anyway the thing that's interesting about the I watch is the buying of it at least for me, right.

471
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,787
Speaker 1: so Apple usually does.

472
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:59,692
Speaker 1: the way they do their pre-orders is you can pre-order online Or you can go to an Apple store and wait in line.

473
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:00,857
Speaker 1: They got rid of the Apple store.

474
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,304
Speaker 1: wait in line You can't.

475
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:03,348
Speaker 0: you have to go online now.

476
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:04,312
Speaker 0: Yeah, which good.

477
00:32:04,332 --> 00:32:05,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously, that's good.

478
00:32:07,002 --> 00:32:12,940
Speaker 1: The thing is they made X number of Apple watches that we don't know yet and they pre-ordered that many online.

479
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:16,834
Speaker 1: Now that they've already pre-ordered all of those that they're making in that first shipment.

480
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:18,480
Speaker 1: You can't pre-order one now.

481
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:21,124
Speaker 1: They're sort of sold out Now.

482
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:25,320
Speaker 1: there are many reasons they might want to do this, but I frankly do not understand at all.

483
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:28,757
Speaker 1: Why don't you just take money from everyone who wants one now?

484
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,123
Speaker 1: Regardless of how many that is maybe a billion people on earth want an Apple watch and it cost $500.

485
00:32:35,123 --> 00:32:37,259
Speaker 1: All right, take the five hundred billion dollars.

486
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:42,336
Speaker 1: Yeah Regardless of how many watches you've already made or can make soon because people don't think like people.

487
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:44,980
Speaker 0: when I pre-order something I got to just assume the money is gone.

488
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:54,400
Speaker 1: Anyway, just take their fucking money regardless of how many watches you have and then as you make watches Mail them out to people based on who was first in line and the person who clicked on it last.

489
00:32:54,862 --> 00:32:56,893
Speaker 1: They might get their watch next year, but fuck them.

490
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,179
Speaker 1: Hold on to their money until then.

491
00:32:58,782 --> 00:33:03,940
Speaker 1: Why are you like making them reload pages every time you make more watches and keep clicking and do this?

492
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,547
Speaker 0: And no, I can think of a lot of reasons.

493
00:33:05,808 --> 00:33:06,773
Speaker 0: There are bad reasons.

494
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:08,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can imagine bad reasons.

495
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,882
Speaker 0: I can think.

496
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:18,086
Speaker 1: I can list a ton of like smart business wise but bad for humans reasons Sure, but I mean if I ever have a business that pre-orders anything I'm going to do it that way where it's like.

497
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:24,389
Speaker 1: we will take as many pre-orders as people will pre-order up to infinity and But as we make them we will send them out.

498
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,340
Speaker 0: what I would do is a long time on the pre-order.

499
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:36,018
Speaker 0: I would definitely set it up where it'll show you like your rough ETA like if you pre-order now And you know what if you want to cancel while you're waiting, I'll give you a fucking money back.

500
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:36,763
Speaker 1: I don't care I'm Apple.

501
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:37,631
Speaker 1: I got I got money.

502
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,803
Speaker 1: I don't care Right.

503
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:42,240
Speaker 1: Why don't you just do it that way to save everyone the hassle?

504
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:43,203
Speaker 1: Not that I want you.

505
00:33:43,263 --> 00:33:48,439
Speaker 0: and then you take all this pre-order money and you invest it in short-term like money money thing.

506
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:50,667
Speaker 1: Yeah Now here's another.

507
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:57,020
Speaker 1: the only other thing I'd say about Apple watch is If you don't want pebble watch if you're a big Apple person, you have a Mac and an iPhone.

508
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,464
Speaker 1: You're probably better off with Apple watch.

509
00:33:58,545 --> 00:34:01,032
Speaker 1: definitely get Apple watch 2.0.

510
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:04,202
Speaker 1: Look at every Apple product that has ever been made Right.

511
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,569
Speaker 1: Look at say the iPhone one.

512
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:07,532
Speaker 1: Not good.

513
00:34:08,152 --> 00:34:11,764
Speaker 1: Not a good deal, but the iPhone 3g Not bad.

514
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:14,271
Speaker 1: even today, I mean it's like all right.

515
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,320
Speaker 0: All right iPhone 3g is still better than a lot of feature phones.

516
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,543
Speaker 1: It's a huge the judge.

517
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:26,728
Speaker 1: and if you compare every iPhone to the generations of iPhone that are next to it adjacent The iPhone 3 iPhone 1 to iPhone 3g was the biggest jump.

518
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,253
Speaker 1: All right think about iMac.

519
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:35,288
Speaker 1: the first iMac the colored fruity thing Oh, yeah, and the second iMac Big ass jump right.

520
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,016
Speaker 1: since then I guess there were a couple other big-ass jumps.

521
00:34:38,036 --> 00:34:45,239
Speaker 0: So the iMac's pretty old Yeah, but like we've still got one of those second gen iMacs Yeah, and like it still works and it's still like a pretty good computer, right?

522
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,123
Speaker 1: iPod right.

523
00:34:47,164 --> 00:34:49,291
Speaker 1: first iPod with a physically spinning wheel.

524
00:34:49,311 --> 00:34:53,882
Speaker 1: Yeah, then they made the jump to the not physically spinning wheel Right.

525
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:55,326
Speaker 0: I'm here put in start comparison.

526
00:34:55,346 --> 00:34:58,795
Speaker 0: The first iPod was what like four hundred something dollars, right?

527
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:08,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could buy a Basically a CD player that would read mp3s off of a CD For like a hundred bucks, yep.

528
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:17,132
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you look at Apple history product hip history of Apple products The second gen is usually the biggest jump in awesomeness.

529
00:35:17,413 --> 00:35:19,300
Speaker 1: Look at the first iPad is huge.

530
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:21,790
Speaker 1: Second iPad perfectly fine today.

531
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:36,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the same as all right, so I Would recommend the Apple iWatch 2 that's gonna come out next year or the year after is gonna be So insanely better than the iWatch 1. it's gonna be way thin and way awesome.

532
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:37,257
Speaker 1: right just get that.

533
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:38,260
Speaker 1: it's gonna be great.

534
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,822
Speaker 0: Well, it depends.

535
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,488
Speaker 0: There's one different one.

536
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,291
Speaker 1: Not a good deal.

537
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,680
Speaker 0: There's one factor here the collectability factor.

538
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,064
Speaker 1: I have to check out.

539
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:45,345
Speaker 1: cool.

540
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:48,134
Speaker 0: Yeah, how much money can you get for an iPod one?

541
00:35:48,636 --> 00:35:49,037
Speaker 0: Good point.

542
00:35:49,218 --> 00:35:52,991
Speaker 0: Yeah Android the first and for Samsung phone Nexus 4.

543
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:53,372
Speaker 0: Yeah.

544
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:55,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, so even to Google Glass.

545
00:35:56,321 --> 00:36:09,879
Speaker 0: But I guess the factor is the thing that the fundamental thing limiting these devices is wireless communication protocols for like local high bandwidth that is like power of vision and battery technology.

546
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:18,828
Speaker 0: until battery technology has a Fundamental and significant game-changing shift the watches cannot get much better than they are now.

547
00:36:18,848 --> 00:36:19,489
Speaker 0: Hmm.

548
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,840
Speaker 0: So You might just have to wait until there's battery news.

549
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:32,450
Speaker 1: maybe I mean the Apple iWatch last all day Apparently and you can plug it in just easily as the pebble the current pebble lasts more than all day.

550
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:35,984
Speaker 1: The pebble time is supposedly gonna last for fucking ever.

551
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:37,590
Speaker 0: So oh my god.

552
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, the new pebble and I got the metal one, which is one millimeter thicker.

553
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:42,675
Speaker 0: Well, because it looks nicer.

554
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:46,786
Speaker 0: Okay, but they claim 10 to 14 days of light use.

555
00:36:46,887 --> 00:36:47,308
Speaker 1: I believe it.

556
00:36:47,428 --> 00:36:51,190
Speaker 0: Yeah I wish it wasn't a millimeter thicker, but that's the iWatch news.

557
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,594
Speaker 0: yeah, so we'll see.

558
00:36:52,614 --> 00:36:53,195
Speaker 0: I do the.

559
00:36:53,235 --> 00:37:08,948
Speaker 0: I will say one thing if you are really invested in like because you're invested in this idea like This kind of technology because I have to say Google Glass or like a smart watch of any kind is a Significant life improvement even if it is not a game changer.

560
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:11,965
Speaker 1: I mean just not having to take your phone out of your pocket.

561
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:15,790
Speaker 1: your phone goes If you don't have a watch or a Google Glass or anything.

562
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,670
Speaker 1: You're taking that phone out to see what that was because that could have been a call from mom.

563
00:37:20,194 --> 00:37:21,910
Speaker 1: It could have been a really important email.

564
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:28,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell me about a base that you're gonna wait or it could have just been like, you know The sports news like Mets game starting right?

565
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,450
Speaker 1: So you got to manage your notifications heavily.

566
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:35,258
Speaker 1: But even though the watch you can turn on more notifications You don't turn on too many.

567
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:36,609
Speaker 1: is that your wrist is shaking all the time?

568
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:42,298
Speaker 1: You can turn on more and then you see on the notification on the watch and you go Oh, I better take my phone out.

569
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,830
Speaker 1: This is important or don't have to take my phone out.

570
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:54,970
Speaker 1: that's just the Mets starting and It's the greatest totally worth it Especially since an old pebble watch is actually the current one way cheap and the next one not really expensive either.

571
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,935
Speaker 1: Apple watch for the people with money Alright, so Comcast.

572
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:05,690
Speaker 0: it's kind of brief news, but the Comcast Time Warner merger failed in disaster.

573
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,043
Speaker 0: We won again.

574
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:10,290
Speaker 1: we won on the net neutrality.

575
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:13,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, we won on this FTC FCC getting it done.

576
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,466
Speaker 1: mad props rest of government.

577
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,994
Speaker 0: You're still fucking up then I'm not we're not gonna talk about.

578
00:38:18,014 --> 00:38:25,300
Speaker 0: I mean you can read the stories on why it failed and what it came down to was Basically, the regulators were looking at it.

579
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,845
Speaker 0: So they were like, oh, well now we're fucked.

580
00:38:27,327 --> 00:38:34,230
Speaker 1: Yeah and to Everyone realized cost us more money to fight and fail because probably gonna fail is not even bother.

581
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:38,630
Speaker 0: They only probably even considered the merger thinking that lobbying pull a fast.

582
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:41,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was gonna make sure that no one looked into this too closely.

583
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:50,226
Speaker 0: I don't think they expected the angry public to turn into the government actually looking at it and actually starting to evaluate it.

584
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:55,678
Speaker 0: and Like um guests started to look That NBC Comcast no problem.

585
00:38:55,698 --> 00:38:58,007
Speaker 1: They're like, oh well that we slipped that one by.

586
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:58,830
Speaker 0: let's do it again.

587
00:38:59,151 --> 00:39:01,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should probably undo that previous one.

588
00:39:01,283 --> 00:39:02,550
Speaker 1: In fact, we should undo a lot.

589
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:06,664
Speaker 1: Yeah should probably break apart Verizon and Verizon wireless should.

590
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:07,968
Speaker 1: probably a lot of things need breaking.

591
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:10,662
Speaker 0: Yep So this is just great.

592
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,270
Speaker 0: Like this is a tech victory.

593
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:29,796
Speaker 0: It's kind of unprecedented a streak of the US government doing the smart thing in technology mostly due to public outrage Pay it when when there is public outrage to be had in the tech sector Do it like?

594
00:39:30,137 --> 00:39:33,030
Speaker 0: send those letters send those emails like it sounds dumb.

595
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:38,430
Speaker 0: But when the FCC got those like millions and millions millions of emails, they really didn't have much of a choice.

596
00:39:38,597 --> 00:39:48,786
Speaker 1: Yeah like Congress can't easily Like fuck with these things when there's well The reason that the reason that it was able to work in that case is because those emails are public.

597
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:54,190
Speaker 1: when you email your Congress Person, you don't know like let's say our Congress person is gonna do something bad.

598
00:39:54,310 --> 00:40:03,770
Speaker 1: So we all everyone in Queens in our area here and I guess also Includes the east side of Manhattan we email that Congress person and we're like don't do this evil thing.

599
00:40:03,871 --> 00:40:06,370
Speaker 1: Let's say every single person in the whole district said this letter.

600
00:40:06,872 --> 00:40:18,779
Speaker 1: They're probably gonna listen to us because they're gonna vote against them if they don't do it, but They could say they could just go straight on TV or whatever and say my constituents are really supporting me in this And I'm gonna do it.

601
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:20,369
Speaker 1: and you have no idea.

602
00:40:21,231 --> 00:40:27,315
Speaker 1: We're all sitting there believing that we're the only one in the district that sent them a letter saying no that everyone else told them Yes, or who knows what.

603
00:40:27,375 --> 00:40:30,610
Speaker 0: but if you go to the executive side and go after the FCC, right?

604
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 1: Like hey guys, hey guys, hey guys All those comments are public and anyone can see.

605
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:42,550
Speaker 1: hey the FCC just isn't gonna do this net neutrality thing Even though so many millions of people just told them do that's fucked up.

606
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:46,690
Speaker 0: Yeah More importantly the FCC can take action based on that without Congress's approval.

607
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,440
Speaker 1: Usually so far because that's what the law says.

608
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,584
Speaker 1: Congress can undo the law.

609
00:40:50,604 --> 00:40:52,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then what happened?

610
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:52,992
Speaker 1: It's actually they're.

611
00:40:53,052 --> 00:40:55,582
Speaker 1: they're doing it with Congress's approval sort of.

612
00:40:55,622 --> 00:40:56,385
Speaker 1: is this an old kind?

613
00:40:56,405 --> 00:41:01,970
Speaker 1: the Republicans are trying to like The approval of an old Congress that wrote a lawyer cut me off.

614
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,195
Speaker 0: Here's what I'm getting at.

615
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:12,144
Speaker 0: if you lobby the FCC with public outrage the FCC will often now apparently do it and then basically they dare.

616
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,089
Speaker 0: they have to dare Congress to undo it.

617
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,464
Speaker 0: an Individual congressman even if their party line is against the thing that got done.

618
00:41:20,126 --> 00:41:36,689
Speaker 0: if they come out publicly Against what the FCC did Then they come out publicly against Widespread public consensus and that it looks real bad for reelection Even if their constituents are nominally against the thing.

619
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:41,001
Speaker 0: Anyway, so we just said we want to break all these people up.

620
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:43,289
Speaker 0: So the EU is once again trying to break Google up.

621
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:47,079
Speaker 0: Massive massive massive antitrust case against Google.

622
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:54,369
Speaker 1: Well while I don't think that breaking up Google is necessarily The worst idea I don't think it's a good idea.

623
00:41:54,610 --> 00:42:00,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know, maybe maybe not but this particular case is really bullshit.

624
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, this one is not the right way to be going.

625
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:03,090
Speaker 1: euro.

626
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,990
Speaker 0: Yeah Europe has done this many times in the past.

627
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,057
Speaker 0: Europe is like you're.

628
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:18,470
Speaker 1: I'm glad that nothing I do is under the purview of European law Right, so specifically what they're upset about is sort of androids monopoly, which is strange because they got iPhone.

629
00:42:19,316 --> 00:42:21,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, the iPhone is ridiculously popular.

630
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,838
Speaker 1: I don't understand why they think Android has a monopoly.

631
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:27,630
Speaker 0: first of all also Android is open like you can just use it.

632
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,530
Speaker 0: That's like saying Linux has a monopoly.

633
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:37,690
Speaker 1: But apparently what some of this case is based on is actually the previous case that Google thankfully won Against Oracle, right?

634
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:46,290
Speaker 1: so remember when Oracle was going after Google because Android was all Java II and And Oracle bought Sun and then went after Google on the Java front.

635
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:51,110
Speaker 1: They were like, oh you're using Java without paying us money in your androids and they lost which is good.

636
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:52,634
Speaker 1: We won that one, right?

637
00:42:52,775 --> 00:42:54,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but during that case.

638
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:10,789
Speaker 1: there were some documents supposedly uncovered to where Google said things to various phone manufacturers such as if you want to use Android you got to be using Google stuff like you know Chrome and Gmail's and all that kind of Google wallets and what you know, all the kind of Google stuff.

639
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,955
Speaker 1: and That's a no-no You can't be doing that.

640
00:43:13,975 --> 00:43:16,004
Speaker 1: that that was the same thing that Microsoft did where they were.

641
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:18,614
Speaker 1: like you want to use Windows get a glitter Internet Explorer on there.

642
00:43:19,216 --> 00:43:22,729
Speaker 1: So, you know, that's sort of like evidence like, you know Europe wants to be like.

643
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:28,076
Speaker 1: hey You can't tell these phone man makers if they want to use Android They got to be googly and Google's like.

644
00:43:28,477 --> 00:43:30,162
Speaker 1: well, it's you're obviously right.

645
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:31,927
Speaker 1: You can use Android and not be googly.

646
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:43,672
Speaker 1: Nothing's stopping you Yeah, and but they're still pushing with this case and I guess there are a few European companies Complaining about Google as they always do like they're trying to make Google do all these Changes.

647
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:46,644
Speaker 1: Yep, but like most of the time I don't know why Google puts up with it.

648
00:43:46,845 --> 00:43:50,921
Speaker 1: if I was Google I would just be like Immediately as soon as they said anything to you.

649
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:52,610
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even send an ultimatum.

650
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:54,824
Speaker 1: I just just cut off all the Google in Europe.

651
00:43:54,965 --> 00:44:01,860
Speaker 1: So alright Everyone in Europe was Gmail suddenly lost all their for email.

652
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,666
Speaker 1: It's like oh, that's too bad.

653
00:44:03,846 --> 00:44:05,914
Speaker 1: YouTube just gone in Europe Just like it's just off.

654
00:44:06,576 --> 00:44:10,010
Speaker 1: No one in Europe can see YouTube, you know, but it's like we're just so fucked, right?

655
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:12,009
Speaker 1: It's just like stop suing us.

656
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:17,090
Speaker 1: We do exactly what we say and we'll put it back on and I guess you could just immediately basically come.

657
00:44:17,411 --> 00:44:19,780
Speaker 0: We'd be super mad if some other companies did this.

658
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,269
Speaker 0: what it comes down to is that breaking a monopolies?

659
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,316
Speaker 1: The whole thing would be mad.

660
00:44:24,336 --> 00:44:25,441
Speaker 1: No the whole intent.

661
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:26,044
Speaker 1: Give me a scenario.

662
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:26,727
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be mad.

663
00:44:27,068 --> 00:44:29,949
Speaker 0: well So what if it was?

664
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:31,556
Speaker 0: Microsoft?

665
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:36,168
Speaker 0: okay trying to Prevent trying to think of a really good example here.

666
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:48,989
Speaker 0: Because here you're trying to say what if Microsoft use their power to say yeah Linux should be illegal like you're not allowed to install Linux and they just said we'll just fucking pull out of the u.s Unless you make Linux illegal.

667
00:44:49,972 --> 00:44:50,716
Speaker 1: All right, pull out.

668
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,085
Speaker 0: Okay, so they do good.

669
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:55,720
Speaker 0: and So yeah, so now they're in Europe and that's fine.

670
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,530
Speaker 0: You think Google can do the same thing in the other direction?

671
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,514
Speaker 0: Yeah, I probably know they can.

672
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:00,136
Speaker 1: why not?

673
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,179
Speaker 0: the world is too global.

674
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:01,961
Speaker 0: It's too interconnected.

675
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:03,405
Speaker 0: You're hyperbole is silly.

676
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:07,789
Speaker 0: It's fucking but Both like a lot like especially in the search stuff.

677
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:12,569
Speaker 0: everyone I've ever seen who complains about Google search being a monopoly.

678
00:45:12,589 --> 00:45:14,895
Speaker 0: is Some SEO bullshit?

679
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:18,187
Speaker 0: or someone who's mad because they're bullshit doesn't float to the top of Google.

680
00:45:18,488 --> 00:45:24,908
Speaker 0: you search for Anything on any search engine in the world and you get all these spam garbage like e-commerce sites.

681
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:28,322
Speaker 0: on Google You actually get what you want and that does it if you're.

682
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:31,199
Speaker 0: if the monopoly is not causing harm Don't break it up.

683
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:36,610
Speaker 0: if it's uh Causing harm like some of the old JP Morgan stuff break it up.

684
00:45:37,671 --> 00:45:39,560
Speaker 0: Don't break up monopolies just because they're monopoly.

685
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,590
Speaker 0: break them up because they suck or they're doing evil.

686
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:46,190
Speaker 0: But in this case, I don't really think anything Google's doing here is particularly wrong.

687
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:47,813
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.

688
00:45:48,014 --> 00:45:49,642
Speaker 1: I don't understand what they're complaining about.

689
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:50,264
Speaker 0: They're Europe.

690
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:51,510
Speaker 0: That's just a new Google.

691
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,386
Speaker 1: I mean it made more sense in the Microsoft case in the 90s because Windows was way more monopoly.

692
00:45:56,466 --> 00:45:59,752
Speaker 0: Yeah, then Android is Um Plus.

693
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:00,936
Speaker 0: what Santagen mod?

694
00:46:01,157 --> 00:46:02,542
Speaker 0: They just made a deal with Microsoft.

695
00:46:02,582 --> 00:46:04,449
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the Microsoft store in the Microsoft.

696
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:04,670
Speaker 0: shit.

697
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:07,053
Speaker 0: Yeah, Santagen mod You can run that on a phone.

698
00:46:07,394 --> 00:46:13,510
Speaker 0: a company could sell a handset with Santagen mod windows as a legit phone?

699
00:46:13,952 --> 00:46:15,559
Speaker 0: Sure, that would be totally okay.

700
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:17,086
Speaker 0: So how is this a monopoly again?

701
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:17,870
Speaker 1: I don't understand.

702
00:46:18,432 --> 00:46:27,170
Speaker 1: it seems like they just really hate Google because it's like an American company that has a lot of power over them and Nothing to compete with it will ever come out of Europe.

703
00:46:27,231 --> 00:46:38,930
Speaker 1: But Google is you know Perhaps really big and sort of monopolistic and it would be sort of interesting if I was gonna break up Google what I would do If I was like the Justice Department or whatever as I would say look, here's what you got to do.

704
00:46:39,512 --> 00:46:41,598
Speaker 1: It wouldn't be like those typical breakups where it's like.

705
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:43,444
Speaker 1: All right, Google Apps is one company.

706
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:44,748
Speaker 1: Google searches one company.

707
00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:45,130
Speaker 1: good, right?

708
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:46,607
Speaker 1: I would say here's what you're gonna do.

709
00:46:47,291 --> 00:47:01,206
Speaker 1: You are going to set up a whole nother infrastructure with the Google search on it and have two companies that start in the exact Same position with the same search engine and we're gonna split the search employees between the two companies and now they're gonna go And now they're gonna compete.

710
00:47:01,732 --> 00:47:09,587
Speaker 1: So now there's two amazing search engines and we actually have a choice But neither of them suck and they're competing and now we're gonna see what happens.

711
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:18,687
Speaker 0: that's gonna be awesome Right, if you just say well searches if I were Google and you did that I'd say fuck you and shut down Gmail in the entire country until you give up.

712
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:19,450
Speaker 1: All right.

713
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,879
Speaker 0: So you think you know you'd be okay with that.

714
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,746
Speaker 0: sure YouTube just disappears.

715
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,803
Speaker 1: all those employees You're gonna be looking for work at Bing real quick.

716
00:47:27,904 --> 00:47:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah Now you think you've been could possibly be good enough to replace YouTube.

717
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:37,461
Speaker 1: if and Google search if the Google search and YouTube employees went Over there, they would fix that shit.

718
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:47,785
Speaker 0: So maybe so ESPN has sued Verizon to stop them from having non-sports TV bundles.

719
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:52,508
Speaker 0: Yeah I Don't care who wins.

720
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:56,947
Speaker 0: Because in because there's a ton of other like lawsuits and slap fights in the table.

721
00:47:56,987 --> 00:47:57,309
Speaker 0: industry.

729
00:48:25,671 --> 00:48:26,774
Speaker 0: Fuck the cable companies.

Speaker 1: Oh, oh, is that is that Genghis Khan over there?

00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:40,030
Speaker 0: Hey Genghis going at it go Oh shit means like just don't throw anything over my walls and you are welcome to go right past.

Speaker 0: Well, in fact, we'll throw food for you.

736
00:48:41,557 --> 00:48:42,099
Speaker 0: Just go nuts.

737
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,562
Speaker 0: Have fun.

738
00:48:42,622 --> 00:48:46,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, I found a new religion of popcorn Popcorn over here.

739
00:48:46,873 --> 00:48:49,059
Speaker 0: cuz seriously fuck these guys.

740
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:50,823
Speaker 0: I just want to watch stuff on TV.

741
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:52,548
Speaker 0: The nails are in the coffins.

742
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:59,900
Speaker 0: HBO all that Cartoon Network stuff that's hard to watch is just on Hulu now like Everything's going internet.

743
00:49:00,445 --> 00:49:01,090
Speaker 0: Fuck these guys.

744
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:06,490
Speaker 1: So I've talked about this before but I'm gonna say it again people who don't know right the math of how this works.

745
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:12,750
Speaker 1: So you might be thinking well, why don't cable companies just let you choose exactly the channels that you want, right?

746
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,539
Speaker 1: I want ESPN and I want current Cartoon Network Comedy Central.

747
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:16,242
Speaker 1: I want three channels.

748
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:16,904
Speaker 1: Give those to me.

749
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:18,730
Speaker 1: I'll pay for those, right?

750
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:25,470
Speaker 1: Well, here's the reason why that would cost you Not really much more than the 50 60 bucks a month that they're charging anyway.

751
00:49:26,012 --> 00:49:30,770
Speaker 1: And the reason for that is you're basically subsidizing the same way that insurance works, right?

752
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:37,910
Speaker 1: They give ESPN is the example here X dollars for every customer that they have because everyone has ESPN.

753
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:42,329
Speaker 1: So they give them two dollars a customer or something and that adds up to a shit ton of money.

754
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:48,064
Speaker 1: A very small percentage of those customers actually are watching the ESPN, right only?

755
00:49:48,125 --> 00:49:50,190
Speaker 1: maybe you know million customers.

756
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,109
Speaker 1: Well, you know how many people are sports fans, right?

757
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,930
Speaker 1: How many people do you know have pay for cable but don't watch ESPN at all?

758
00:49:56,110 --> 00:50:00,210
Speaker 1: They might even be sports fans and not watch ESPN because they like hockey and ESPN doesn't have hockey.

759
00:50:00,975 --> 00:50:03,050
Speaker 1: So they just watch NBC Sports.

760
00:50:03,813 --> 00:50:13,669
Speaker 1: so you have this channel that they're paying two bucks a month for that they're not watching and That adds up to a shit ton if you have only had the people who actually watch the channel pay for it.

761
00:50:14,613 --> 00:50:18,210
Speaker 1: If they all paid two bucks a month, obviously ESPN's make it a way less money.

762
00:50:18,531 --> 00:50:20,259
Speaker 1: They're not gonna be able to have ESPN.

763
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:21,906
Speaker 1: ESPN costs a lot of money to run.

764
00:50:21,947 --> 00:50:22,690
Speaker 1: you gotta have cameras.

765
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:30,290
Speaker 1: You got to go to all these sports events trucks broadcast equipment talent on the net, you know It's a really expensive business endeavor to have ESPN.

766
00:50:31,372 --> 00:50:33,603
Speaker 1: They need that large amount of money even to just happen.

767
00:50:33,623 --> 00:50:34,869
Speaker 1: They're not really raking it in.

768
00:50:35,251 --> 00:50:36,917
Speaker 1: You know, it's part of Disney, but it's still.

769
00:50:36,937 --> 00:50:39,867
Speaker 1: they're not, you know immensely profitable, right?

770
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:45,503
Speaker 1: So They'd have to charge if they only people who watched it paid for it.

771
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:49,881
Speaker 1: they have to charge those people 20 30 bucks a month something ridiculous.

772
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:57,450
Speaker 1: and no one's paying 30 bucks a month just for ESPN Even if they want it, even if they were an ESPN fan, they're not paying $30 a month just for that.

773
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,903
Speaker 1: You know what $30 a month gets you.

774
00:50:58,964 --> 00:50:59,307
Speaker 1: are you insane?

775
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:02,478
Speaker 1: Right, and I'm gonna pay that for one time never mind like.

776
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:06,750
Speaker 0: forget about all the other channels with all their ads and all their bullshit.

777
00:51:07,111 --> 00:51:17,149
Speaker 0: That literally only exists because they're subsidized by the rest and they have like this closed-loop Revenue stream of fake advertising and people who have the channel but may not be watching it.

778
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:22,210
Speaker 1: There are also a lot of channels on there that like wouldn't be profitable just on their own.

779
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:33,803
Speaker 1: They don't they just they get like pennies per Subscriber or sometimes they're even paying the cable network to be on there or just on there for free So that the cable that we can say we have X billion channels.

780
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:35,730
Speaker 0: There's an entire ecosystem.

781
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:43,173
Speaker 0: I think the majority of television stations, you know in quotes in the US the vast majority will Disappear.

782
00:51:43,414 --> 00:51:45,542
Speaker 0: those companies and everyone involved will be bad.

783
00:51:45,743 --> 00:51:47,570
Speaker 1: less and less people have cable.

784
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:59,748
Speaker 1: Most of these channels are just going to completely vanish Right more and more and it's gonna even if some cable company is like yeah If you get us you can have all 30 channels because all these other ones are gone.

785
00:51:59,768 --> 00:52:06,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, and It's pretty much gonna be direct people to content makers and channels are gonna die, which is great.

786
00:52:07,352 --> 00:52:10,770
Speaker 1: YouTube is basically the channel now, which oh another monopoly for Google.

787
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,195
Speaker 0: Yeah The thing is not like.

788
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:15,402
Speaker 0: even like we try streaming stuff to twitch.

789
00:52:15,783 --> 00:52:22,507
Speaker 1: streaming to Google just works like a billion times better Twitch is you know, I mean twitch is the thing that twitch does better than Google.

790
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:24,993
Speaker 0: the Comments like every.

791
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:30,496
Speaker 1: no is the fact that you can have this sort of one URL that people can check anytime and it goes On and off.

792
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,287
Speaker 1: true with YouTube You're actually creating like a new YouTube video and it's not like people can just watch your chat.

793
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:40,190
Speaker 1: your one URL to see if you're on or off.

794
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:40,929
Speaker 1: it's just.

795
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:41,633
Speaker 1: You know.

796
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:46,755
Speaker 1: when you make a new one you have to sort of announce it and people have to go to it and it's not That same kind of thing.

797
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,524
Speaker 1: where it's like, oh it's got streaming now.

798
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:49,490
Speaker 1: Let me go check.

799
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,456
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's what YouTube needs to add.

800
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:54,285
Speaker 1: is they need to give you a URL like youtube.com.

801
00:52:54,325 --> 00:52:55,328
Speaker 1: slash blah blah blah.

802
00:52:55,368 --> 00:53:02,802
Speaker 1: slash your name Slash live or if you go there if you happen to be streaming something live at that time There it is and then just set it up to run.

803
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:04,290
Speaker 0: basically quote unquote reruns.

804
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:09,948
Speaker 1: It's not like you can have two live events at a time And if you can you just pick which one goes in the channel or they're all there.

805
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:16,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever, you know something so that people can just sort of subscribe to you and you know Beyond there.

806
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:19,019
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that's the only thing.

807
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:23,859
Speaker 0: that's which last but not least probably the most important and interesting tech news But not a lot of people are talking about it.

808
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:32,462
Speaker 0: just recently There's been a move toward Automation and farms with robots that was previously infeasible.

809
00:53:32,522 --> 00:53:33,345
Speaker 0: not technologically.

810
00:53:33,405 --> 00:53:38,643
Speaker 0: arms mostly robots and big machines No, but there's a lot of things that are manual processes like picking strawberries.

811
00:53:38,663 --> 00:53:40,168
Speaker 1: Yeah machine can't really do that.

812
00:53:40,208 --> 00:53:41,574
Speaker 0: very well Well, they can.

813
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:42,479
Speaker 0: it's just they're expensive.

814
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:44,850
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even realize they had a machine that could do that.

815
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:45,800
Speaker 0: Like there's a machine here.

816
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,749
Speaker 0: It's called the agro bot.

817
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:49,294
Speaker 0: It costs like a hundred grand and it does it great Really.

818
00:53:49,414 --> 00:53:49,977
Speaker 0: and there's other miss.

819
00:53:49,997 --> 00:53:51,786
Speaker 1: I'd like to see that machine in a YouTube video.

820
00:53:51,806 --> 00:53:52,550
Speaker 1: make it a thing of the day.

821
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:53,548
Speaker 0: I'm linking to it.

822
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:56,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at this thing.

823
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:57,730
Speaker 1: Does it really pick strawberries?

824
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:03,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, a person drives it and it picks strawberries gingerly one by one from every one of these plants under the leaves.

825
00:54:04,432 --> 00:54:09,670
Speaker 0: This is the kind of work that Previously was done primarily by undocumented illegal immigrants.

826
00:54:09,891 --> 00:54:10,596
Speaker 1: Well, I thought they were.

827
00:54:10,616 --> 00:54:12,810
Speaker 1: there's a special program to bring in agriculture.

828
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:18,770
Speaker 0: Then we moved up to doing it legally but paying these people, you know, basically garbage.

829
00:54:18,851 --> 00:54:19,012
Speaker 0: They're.

830
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,750
Speaker 1: basically I paid at least minimum wage.

831
00:54:22,611 --> 00:54:24,260
Speaker 1: I didn't say it wasn't garbage.

832
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:25,910
Speaker 1: I thought it but it's not illegal wages.

833
00:54:26,151 --> 00:54:34,649
Speaker 0: But if the the comment like the reason like robots don't just run McDonald's the reason we still need all these unskilled laborers Is that this kind of work?

834
00:54:35,311 --> 00:54:42,650
Speaker 0: Until very recently it was always cheaper to hire a whole bunch of migrant workers than to buy one robot.

835
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:56,178
Speaker 0: Now because the cost of that labor has gone up due to a combination of stricter immigration More wage pressure minimum wage is going up in places and robot technology getting a little bit cheaper It's now cheaper.

836
00:54:56,278 --> 00:55:00,156
Speaker 0: So all these jobs are literally Rapidly disappearing.

837
00:55:00,377 --> 00:55:03,350
Speaker 0: nice all the micro all the jobs nice and not nice.

838
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:09,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, all these jobs that were below the line of like, you know, the companies would say well Americans don't want to do these jobs.

839
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,514
Speaker 0: Well, that's not true.

840
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:15,907
Speaker 0: The answer was Americans don't want to do these jobs at the ridiculously pathetic wages.

841
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:16,750
Speaker 0: You're willing to pay.

842
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:22,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you took the money you spent on that robot $100,000 a year and gave that to a person they would do it.

843
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:27,010
Speaker 0: But you need like a hundred of those people because it really sucks to pick strawberries.

844
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:28,396
Speaker 1: How many machines do you need?

845
00:55:28,717 --> 00:55:29,881
Speaker 0: Have you ever picked strawberries?

846
00:55:30,464 --> 00:55:32,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I only picked like a little bucket.

847
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:33,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, try to pick like a hundred buckets.

848
00:55:34,472 --> 00:55:36,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I had to spend all day doing it.

849
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:39,630
Speaker 1: No, you go to the farm for like an hour and you pick one nice bucket and you go buy some cider.

850
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:40,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get a little.

851
00:55:40,615 --> 00:55:43,310
Speaker 0: you're going around thinking like the best the best individual strawberry.

852
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,896
Speaker 1: You don't pick all of them right.

853
00:55:45,097 --> 00:55:48,469
Speaker 0: you ate a half a buckets worth just while you're walking and then you pooped like crazy.

854
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:54,178
Speaker 0: And so it goes Barf blueberries, uh-huh.

855
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:55,689
Speaker 0: Keep an eye on this.

856
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:58,790
Speaker 0: We're hitting a huge turning point.

857
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:03,436
Speaker 0: You know robot cars are gonna be another turning point because as people don't like to talk about.
