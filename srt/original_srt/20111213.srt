1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,358
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, December 13th, 2011.

2
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:10,679
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:13,394
Speaker 1: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:14,990
Speaker 1: - And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,250
Speaker 1: Tonight, Eminent Domain, the board game.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:23,940
Speaker 1: - Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:24,350
Speaker 0: - Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,480
Speaker 1: I've said this before, and I'll probably say it a lot in the course of my life.

9
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,169
Speaker 0: That you have a ton of opening bits?

10
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,561
Speaker 0: I'm gonna count the pounds of opening bits and see if they add up to 2,000.

11
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:40,698
Speaker 1: What I'm gonna say is that, to quote Ghostbusters, "I love this

12
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:41,079
Speaker 1: town.".

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,366
Speaker 0: - Okay.

14
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,320
Speaker 1: - I mean, let's see, what did we do?

15
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:45,360
Speaker 1: On Saturday, we went to the Nostalgia Train.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,155
Speaker 1: We rode a subway car from the '30s.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,900
Speaker 0: No, it's the Vintage Train, not the Nostalgia Train.

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,360
Speaker 1: It was called the Nostalgia Train on the MTA website, Scott.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,220
Speaker 0: It was called the Vintage Train on the MTA website.

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go, 'cause they called it the Nostalgia Train.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,859
Speaker 1: They even made a big deal about, "Go shopping on the Nostalgia

22
00:00:57,879 --> 00:00:58,020
Speaker 1: Train.".

23
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,339
Speaker 1: There was an ad on the MTA site saying, "Come ride the Nostalgia

24
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:02,480
Speaker 1: Train.".

25
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,640
Speaker 1: Christmas shopping.

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,877
Speaker 0: This says, "Take a ride on a vintage

27
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:09,358
Speaker 0: train.".

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,655
Speaker 0: - Yes, it's called-- - "Take a ride on a vintage

29
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,100
Speaker 0: subway.".

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:12,990
Speaker 0: - Yes, a vintage subway.

31
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:13,600
Speaker 0: - The vintage train runs.

32
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,160
Speaker 1: The program is called the Nostalgia Train, because that's what they do every year.

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,600
Speaker 1: That's the program where they make the train ready and run it every year.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,852
Speaker 1: In fact, there's multiple news articles that say, quote, "MTA brings back the Nostalgia Train.

35
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,639
Speaker 0: Come ride the Vintage

36
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:30,960
Speaker 0: Train.".

37
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:44,380
Speaker 0: On the official page, right, not only is "Vintage Train" in the URL, it says the word "Vintage Train" one, two, three, over six times, and it only says the word "Nostalgia" once on this entire page.

38
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,537
Speaker 1: Ah, but the graphical ads say "The Nostalgia

39
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:46,800
Speaker 1: Train."

40
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:51,778
Speaker 1: Not on the official mta.info/metrocard/promo/vintagetrain/index.html.

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,760
Speaker 1: Regardless, we rode a subway train from the '30s onward, and it was actually surprisingly similar to my current experience.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,956
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be kinda cool, like, "Oh, worth

43
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:01,339
Speaker 0: doing.".

44
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,259
Speaker 0: It was actually way awesome.

45
00:02:03,903 --> 00:02:04,834
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna be like, "All

46
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:04,996
Speaker 0: right.".

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,020
Speaker 1: I was mostly pleased with the number of people who were completely and utterly dumbfounded as it pulled up, and they were afraid to get on it.

48
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the weird part.

49
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:15,190
Speaker 0: It's like, if I saw that train pull up, I'd be like, "I don't care where the fuck this is

50
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:15,412
Speaker 0: going.".

51
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:19,295
Speaker 0: 'Cause I was like, "I'm hoping it'd go into, like,

52
00:02:19,436 --> 00:02:19,999
Speaker 0: Andromeda.".

53
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,836
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was like, "Oh, please,

54
00:02:21,877 --> 00:02:22,059
Speaker 1: baby.".

55
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:22,840
Speaker 1: Machine body?

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,656
Speaker 1: Please.

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,617
Speaker 1: I mean, even the garbage trains, I'm like, "Huh, I wonder where this'll take

58
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:27,678
Speaker 1: me.".

59
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not getting on the garbage train.

60
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:32,100
Speaker 1: When they're empty, I wanna get on one, just see where it goes.

61
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:35,400
Speaker 1: Granted, it might go, you know, the opposite of Andromeda is Garbage Planet.

62
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:41,720
Speaker 0: You gotta stop at Garbage Planet on the way to, you know, whatever you wanna go to, La Metal or whatever.

63
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:47,776
Speaker 1: You know, the doors are mostly the same, so, you know, I asked the conductor, because they were just loving the shit out of this, they were yelling, "All

64
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:48,239
Speaker 1: aboard!".

65
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,420
Speaker 0: Well, of course, they only give, like, the ultra-train nerdy conductors on that thing.

66
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,679
Speaker 0: You know, they don't put the regular old M2 guys.

67
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,058
Speaker 1: So I ask him, I'm like, "What if I try to hold this door

68
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:56,300
Speaker 1: open?".

69
00:02:56,361 --> 00:02:57,695
Speaker 1: And he's like, "You will break your

70
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:57,998
Speaker 1: hand.".

71
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:58,679
Speaker 0: That's right.

72
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,656
Speaker 1: "90 pounds of force from each

73
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:01,039
Speaker 1: door."

74
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:01,440
Speaker 1: I wish.

75
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:02,737
Speaker 1: "And there's nothing to stop

76
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:02,839
Speaker 1: it.".

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,980
Speaker 0: And the new subway cars, right?

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,880
Speaker 0: The little rubber bits in between the doors, where they bump into each other.

79
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:09,840
Speaker 0: You know, they got a little flex to 'em.

80
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,040
Speaker 0: I touched the rubber bits on the old doors.

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,340
Speaker 0: They're basically rock hard, solid rubber that, like, you know, a car tire.

82
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,620
Speaker 1: I kinda wanna go back to that, 'cause then people wouldn't be able to hold the fuckin' doors open.

83
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,543
Speaker 0: I know, right?

84
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:22,592
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Oh, you got stuck in the door.

85
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:23,134
Speaker 0: You're dead.

86
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:23,938
Speaker 0: Sorry.".

87
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,247
Speaker 1: Not dead.

88
00:03:26,308 --> 00:03:27,339
Speaker 1: It wouldn't kill ya.

89
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,939
Speaker 0: It would if the train started fuckin' movin'.

90
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,777
Speaker 1: No, the MTA guy was like, "Yeah, we'd reopen it, but your wrist would be

91
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:34,139
Speaker 1: broken.".

92
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,120
Speaker 1: A lot of ankles got broken back in the day.

93
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,596
Speaker 1: Nice.

94
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:41,839
Speaker 1: But on Friday, Nerd NYC Board Game Night, we rocked it up.

95
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,460
Speaker 1: On Thursday, we were at Nerd Night, like we talked about in all the meta moments, doing a lecture.

96
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:49,079
Speaker 1: A 20-minute version of Losing Should Be Fun.

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,639
Speaker 0: Which is pretty, actually, you know, I said all last time, like, "Hey, don't pay the money to go to Nerd Night to see

98
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:54,840
Speaker 0: us.".

99
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:55,424
Speaker 0: And you know what?

100
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,411
Speaker 0: I was correct.

101
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:57,540
Speaker 0: You shouldn't have paid to see us.

102
00:03:57,661 --> 00:03:58,838
Speaker 0: But there were two other things there.

103
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,657
Speaker 0: Well worth paying for.

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy's lecture on, uh, molluscs.

105
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,659
Speaker 1: Cephalopods are a subset of molluscs.

106
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,288
Speaker 0: Yes, but it wasn't on.

107
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:10,360
Speaker 0: The topic did not cover all of molluscs.

108
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,859
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it didn't.

109
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,380
Speaker 0: His talk was specific to cephalopods.

110
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,109
Speaker 1: But he was pretty awesome, and I talked to him.

111
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,140
Speaker 1: We're gonna try to get him to Kineticon.

112
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:16,658
Speaker 1: Nice.

113
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,380
Speaker 1: 'Cause the dude's never been to a con, but all his friends are.

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,180
Speaker 0: The other dude who went after us did this thing using, like, dials, like they use for political stuff, but to evaluate OKCupid profiles.

115
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:33,800
Speaker 1: I was dubious when he started, but then I realized that dial-based humor is one of the finest forms of humor.

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,880
Speaker 0: We need to get those dials ASAP.

117
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,128
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I'm working on getting those dials.

118
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,920
Speaker 1: I want to do something with them at Kineticon, at PAX, and anywhere.

119
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,900
Speaker 0: We're gonna rock the dials.

120
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,694
Speaker 1: Oh my god, we're gonna have panels that are just like, "Yeah, dials!

121
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:44,398
Speaker 0: Turn

122
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:44,538
Speaker 0: 'em!".

123
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,598
Speaker 0: We need to make a board game, video game, everything.

124
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,754
Speaker 0: But seriously, we had no idea- Ooh, in fact, we should make an app for your phone.

125
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:51,580
Speaker 0: that is just the dial.

126
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:52,980
Speaker 1: Oh, that'd be perfect.

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,639
Speaker 0: Yup, if it doesn't already exist.

128
00:04:54,941 --> 00:05:00,819
Speaker 1: So we had no idea what this thing was gonna be like, but basically, you know, we get to this club, and it was really rockin'.

129
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,799
Speaker 1: Like, there were a ton of classy, nerdy people there having cocktails.

130
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly attractive ladies.

131
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:07,580
Speaker 1: Mostly.

132
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Speaker 1: Hanging out, everyone's cool, everyone's smart, everyone's debating and talking, except for the one rowdy table.

133
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:25,180
Speaker 0: Well, I think upstairs on the left were actual OKCupid employees who came, 'cause they must've heard about it, and then there was another rowdy table of people who worked at the same company as the guy who was doing OKCupid talk, but he did not work for OKCupid.

134
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:25,940
Speaker 0: Yup.

135
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,320
Speaker 1: But, uh, so we get in, and one, the main reason I was impressed, we were actually on the list.

136
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:33,847
Speaker 0: Yeah.

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,580
Speaker 1: I cannot tell you how many people invite us to things, and don't put us on whatever fuckin' list they've got.

138
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,337
Speaker 0: Even MagFest, the first year we went.

139
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,460
Speaker 0: And both of us were on the list, and we were actually correctly on the list.

140
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,540
Speaker 0: It wasn't, it didn't list, like, something else, or, you know, just the word Geek Nights, or anything dumb like that.

141
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Speaker 1: Everyone was smart, everyone was cool, and the place smelled like chlorine.

142
00:05:52,782 --> 00:05:53,899
Speaker 1: I'm like, what's up with this?

143
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:54,720
Speaker 1: What's that smell?

144
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:01,240
Speaker 1: Then I realized that all the tables are on little islands, and there's a little, like, bridge over just a floor of water.

145
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:02,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a pretty cool space.

146
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,740
Speaker 1: It's also apparently pretty easy to get that space, so, uh, Relatively.

147
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,480
Speaker 1: Look forward to a Geek Nights themed event there in the near future.

148
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,020
Speaker 0: Well, we need to, I think you can only get that space as long as you have at least a hundred people, and those people wanna drink.

149
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:16,839
Speaker 1: I'm well aware.

150
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,818
Speaker 0: Then you can get that space pretty easily.

151
00:06:19,262 --> 00:06:20,257
Speaker 1: I think I will get that space.

152
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,620
Speaker 0: On a, on a, on a weeknight.

153
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:30,399
Speaker 1: Much like how Luke Crane was able to double his power by combining with Vincent Baker for Burning Apocalypse, Geek Nights could team up with some people to do a thing.

154
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,339
Speaker 0: Get a hundred people to get drunk?

155
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:33,878
Speaker 1: I think we could get a hundred people.

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,579
Speaker 0: On a weekday night in New York?

157
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:36,240
Speaker 1: Yeah.

158
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,067
Speaker 0: Alright.

159
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,879
Speaker 1: Because remember, the real reason to live in New York is not for the stuff that happens on the weekend, because everyone's life revolves on the weekends.

160
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:52,439
Speaker 1: The whole point of living here is that stuff happens on the weekdays, usually the more awesome stuff, and if you live here, it's really the only way to do that stuff.

161
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:53,038
Speaker 0: Yep.

162
00:06:53,662 --> 00:07:01,460
Speaker 0: Or to be so rich that- If you don't live in the city, then if you try to do a weekday event after work, even if you work here, going home sucks balls.

163
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,025
Speaker 1: Like you can tell, like all the

164
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:03,949
Speaker 0: people who run like

165
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:16,480
Speaker 1: clubs or night, you know, restaurants, like nice places, they complain mostly about the weekend crowd, because it's all the commuters and the out of towners, but the real quote unquote, no true Scotsman city culture is Monday through Thursday.

166
00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:17,110
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

167
00:07:17,581 --> 00:07:18,740
Speaker 1: So yeah, the city's awesome.

168
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:19,259
Speaker 0: Alright.

169
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,773
Speaker 1: Got any news?

170
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:21,899
Speaker 0: I do have news.

171
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:22,497
Speaker 1: How do you?

172
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,020
Speaker 0: You know how we always fantasize or, you know, complain about the lack of unfulfilled potential and all these people are making crappy games?

173
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,360
Speaker 1: I believe we even did a panel that was little more than us ranting for an hour.

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't they make a Pokemon MMO?

175
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Speaker 0: Why don't they make a this?

176
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,840
Speaker 1: Why don't they make TIE Fighter 2?

177
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,635
Speaker 1: Why don't they make Tribes 2 too?

178
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,720
Speaker 1: Why don't they just remake fucking Rampart plus Minecraft?

179
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,696
Speaker 0: Well, none of those have been made, but somebody has made something.

180
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,660
Speaker 0: that is the awesome.

181
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:49,380
Speaker 0: Ahem.

182
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,520
Speaker 0: I present to you Bandai Namco Mobile Suit Gundam Online.

183
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,320
Speaker 0: What this is, it is a Gundam game, video game, obviously.

184
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,998
Speaker 0: It is online, obviously.

185
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:02,316
Speaker 0: Is it an MMO?

186
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,157
Speaker 0: No, it is not an MMO.

187
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,600
Speaker 0: It's simply Gundam Battle.

188
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,966
Speaker 0: 52 versus 52.

189
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:09,238
Speaker 0: Go.

190
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:11,160
Speaker 0: All in the same map.

191
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,260
Speaker 0: 52 Gundams against 52 Gundams.

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,960
Speaker 0: Zeon versus, you know, regular guys.

193
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:16,820
Speaker 0: Earth Federation.

194
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:20,400
Speaker 1: The real question is exactly what the controls are like.

195
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,815
Speaker 1: Because that Gundam pod I played in Japan was Gundam.

196
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,460
Speaker 0: Look at these screenshots.

197
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,600
Speaker 0: As in, I would slide sideways.

198
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,340
Speaker 0: Do these screenshots look like your Gundam pod game?

199
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,580
Speaker 1: They... Those look almost exactly like the Gundam pod game.

200
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,080
Speaker 0: I guess it's the home version of the Gundam pod game.

201
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,260
Speaker 0: 52 versus 52.

202
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,640
Speaker 1: There is one other thing it's going to lack.

203
00:08:40,902 --> 00:08:43,740
Speaker 0: But wasn't the Gundam pod game, I imagine it was first person, right?

204
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,519
Speaker 0: It was first person.

205
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,120
Speaker 0: This seems to be third person, more like a little virtual on.

206
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:51,200
Speaker 1: It was first person in the Gundam and you had the two giant joysticks.

207
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,839
Speaker 0: Well, this seems to just be the home version.

208
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,998
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm excited about it because...

209
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,760
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's going to be hard to play if you're not in Japan.

210
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:00,780
Speaker 0: And don't speak Japanese.

211
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,919
Speaker 1: Every big game that's come out since Counter Strike has pissed me off.

212
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, mostly Counter Strike Go is the only thing I'm really holding on to.

213
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,820
Speaker 0: Everything else, take it or leave it.

214
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,000
Speaker 1: Also, Scott, I found something.

215
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,960
Speaker 1: There's a parallel MTA website.

216
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,838
Speaker 1: MTEditInfo/nyct/service/events/nostalgiatrain.htm.

217
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:25,834
Speaker 0: Uh oh.

218
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,700
Speaker 1: That goes to basically the same site?

219
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:30,300
Speaker 1: Anyway.

220
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:35,100
Speaker 1: So, I want to talk about this game a little bit because I think we geek-bit it.

221
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,760
Speaker 1: I don't know if I even linked to it because we had so little to say about it.

222
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:41,960
Speaker 1: Gabe and Tycho, if any arcade, were pretty surprisingly excited about Burnout Crash.

223
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,920
Speaker 1: I remember the other Burnouts being pretty fun to hang out and crash a car for four hours with friends.

224
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,520
Speaker 0: And since it was an Xbox arcade game, I downloaded the free demo.

225
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,300
Speaker 0: Because you can download a free demo of anything that's on Xbox.

226
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,579
Speaker 1: It's an average 99 cent iPhone game that they're charging 10 bucks for.

227
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is, it's not even as good as other one dollar iPhone games.

228
00:10:03,483 --> 00:10:04,500
Speaker 0: It's not as good as Angry Birds.

229
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,660
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure out, was I missing something?

230
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,039
Speaker 0: Like, we played it and we're like, what?

231
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,520
Speaker 0: People were going crazy over this game and how good it was.

232
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,280
Speaker 0: And I was like, why is this game good again?

233
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:14,519
Speaker 1: I mean, seriously, you don't even drive the car.

234
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:18,358
Speaker 1: You kind of steer it shittily and slowly into the intersection once.

235
00:10:19,421 --> 00:10:21,240
Speaker 0: And then you press a button to make it explode.

236
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,320
Speaker 1: Periodically.

237
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:28,120
Speaker 0: Then you wait, and then you make the car explode again and move it while it's exploding and flying through the air from the explosion.

238
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,420
Speaker 0: And then wait, and then explode it again.

239
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,820
Speaker 0: And that's all you do, is explode the car over and over again every time you push the button.

240
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,640
Speaker 1: There was so little to it that I was utterly dumbfounded.

241
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,720
Speaker 1: I did a lot of research to figure out if maybe I was missing something.

242
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:47,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was sure I had to be missing something or I was in the wrong mode because everyone loved the fuck out of this.

243
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,660
Speaker 1: But apparently, everyone doesn't love the fuck out of it because the reviews are actually pretty scathing.

244
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,240
Speaker 1: And pretty much everyone but Gabe and Tycho and a handful of people agree that it's not good at all.

245
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:01,415
Speaker 0: It's weird, though.

246
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:07,800
Speaker 1: It's not good for what it is in terms of being a console game that costs ten dollars.

247
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,480
Speaker 0: Even if it was a dollar on the iPhone, like I said, there are other better dollar iPhone games.

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,339
Speaker 0: There's other better free iPhone games.

249
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,640
Speaker 1: I mean, the whole point of Burnout was not the high score.

250
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,160
Speaker 1: It was seeing the crazy bullshit that happened and being the cause of it.

251
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,100
Speaker 0: But to go crazy bullshit, you need to drive and crash and then drive again.

252
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,540
Speaker 0: This, you drive a little bit and then you don't drive anymore.

253
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:26,765
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even call it driving.

254
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,416
Speaker 1: You steer a tank slowly into an intersection.

255
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,820
Speaker 0: See, what I would like to see would be more like some of the modes they had in the original Burnout.

256
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,738
Speaker 0: And just simplify them and streamline them and make them a little more arcade-y.

257
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:41,107
Speaker 0: So it's like, make the driving really easy.

258
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:44,500
Speaker 0: Give me sort of a twisty road to drive down.

259
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,085
Speaker 0: Give me some missiles to shoot.

260
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:53,720
Speaker 0: And after I shoot all my missiles at different things, Spy Hunter style, I crash into something and then we add up the score from the whole thing and then I can drive again.

261
00:11:54,522 --> 00:11:56,049
Speaker 0: You know, that would be kind of cool.

262
00:11:56,069 --> 00:11:57,496
Speaker 0: Or maybe some multiplayer.

263
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:57,898
Speaker 0: I don't know.

264
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,060
Speaker 1: Never mind the fact that, you know, I'm not one to complain.

265
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,140
Speaker 0: I'm talking about for an Xbox arcade game, not for the phone.

266
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,040
Speaker 1: I'm not one to complain about the metaphor of a game usually, at least not in this context.

267
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,467
Speaker 1: Maybe in a lecture or something.

268
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,060
Speaker 1: But the metaphor of the game is bullshit.

269
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,112
Speaker 1: Like, it doesn't make any sense.

270
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:17,340
Speaker 1: And I just, I don't get this game.

271
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,919
Speaker 0: I do want to say one positive thing about the game.

272
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:22,276
Speaker 0: It has some style, especially in the music.

273
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:22,558
Speaker 0: Dr.

274
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:22,679
Speaker 0: Beat.

275
00:12:23,422 --> 00:12:25,288
Speaker 1: Oh, it's got great style.

276
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:29,300
Speaker 1: For a 99 cent iPhone game, it's pretty fucking great.

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,894
Speaker 0: It actually has pretty good style for a $10 game.

278
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,799
Speaker 0: But I'm not going to pay $10 for style when I can just go to YouTube and get style for free.

279
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,640
Speaker 1: So I got one more little geek bite here because we played a game at the annual front row crew bacchanal in Philly called Beowulf.

280
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,360
Speaker 1: Which, unsurprisingly, was a literal retelling of the story of Beowulf.

281
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, you literally go event by event through the story of Beowulf and you have to play each event until you get to the end.

282
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,780
Speaker 0: Until you see at the end who, which player was the Beowulfiest.

283
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,330
Speaker 1: I'm not going to review it really because we played it once.

284
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:06,780
Speaker 1: I haven't really fully formed my opinion on it yet.

285
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,747
Speaker 1: I kind of liked it.

286
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,199
Speaker 1: But here's the deal.

287
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:17,820
Speaker 1: It has all the trappings of one of those crappy co-op games like Shadows Over Camelot or Battlestar Galactica.

288
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,739
Speaker 0: But it's not a co-op game.

289
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,407
Speaker 1: Well yeah, you could have let me finish.

290
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,250
Speaker 1: I was building up to that.

291
00:13:21,712 --> 00:13:22,294
Speaker 1: That reveal.

292
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:23,680
Speaker 1: I guess you spoiled it.

293
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:25,806
Speaker 1: It has all the trappings of that.

294
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:30,100
Speaker 1: Like the same kinds of cards and the same kinds of interactions and putting cards up.

295
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:41,920
Speaker 1: But you're all straight up in competition with one another and it's basically a bid to see who gets fucked game.

296
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,580
Speaker 1: Every round you bid and somebody gets fucked and hopefully it's not you but it's almost always you.

297
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:51,031
Speaker 0: So basically you're going to have to get fucked sometimes.

298
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:53,400
Speaker 0: so get fucked in the round where getting fucked isn't so bad.

299
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,939
Speaker 1: But then again everyone's thinking that so it doesn't work so well.

300
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,520
Speaker 0: Well then if everyone really bids low maybe you can win big in that round.

301
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,409
Speaker 0: It's like well if I lose this round it's not so bad.

302
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,120
Speaker 0: but wait that means everyone's going to be thinking that they're going to bid nothing.

303
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,680
Speaker 0: I could bid one and take a huge prize in this round.

304
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,820
Speaker 1: So the game devolved into random bullshit at the end but much like that horse racing game we played that one time.

305
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,388
Speaker 0: Did I win?

306
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:17,040
Speaker 0: I don't think I won.

307
00:14:17,383 --> 00:14:19,060
Speaker 1: It devolved, I think Chase won.

308
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,129
Speaker 0: I think so.

309
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,800
Speaker 0: I won something.

310
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:23,379
Speaker 0: Oh I won eminent domain which we're going to talk about.

311
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:23,720
Speaker 1: Yeah you did.

312
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,807
Speaker 1: But the game devolved into random bullshit at the end.

313
00:14:27,229 --> 00:14:31,260
Speaker 1: but the random bullshit was surprisingly awesome and suspenseful.

314
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,099
Speaker 1: Because basically if you run out of cards to bid with you can risk it.

315
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,155
Speaker 1: And there's a mechanic where if you fail at the risk you're fucked.

316
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:40,280
Speaker 1: You take a wound and you're out.

317
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,791
Speaker 0: It's basically I need one more card to stay in this game.

318
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:46,400
Speaker 0: Draw two and if you get the card you need you stay in.

319
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:50,560
Speaker 0: And everyone runs out of cards and everyone just basically draws cards.

320
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,754
Speaker 1: We went around like 20 times at the end of the game.

321
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,020
Speaker 1: Like it was off the fucking hook.

322
00:14:55,482 --> 00:15:00,600
Speaker 0: It's like I had the most cards just in my hand available so I pushed it way up.

323
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,440
Speaker 0: And people kept risking it and managed to stay in the game even though I had outbid them from my hand.

324
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,012
Speaker 1: This game had a great, as a result it had a great vibe where you build like "Ah!

325
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,035
Speaker 1: Ah shit son!

326
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:11,516
Speaker 1: Ah!

327
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:11,978
Speaker 1: Ah!

328
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:12,379
Speaker 1: Ah!"

329
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:23,700
Speaker 1: And then someone would draw like two doubles and you'd see the person who had legitimately gotten that far with the hand they'd built and nurtured throughout the entire game against the guy pulling the random bullshit.

330
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,327
Speaker 1: Look at you yell

331
00:15:25,488 --> 00:15:25,790
Speaker 1: "Fuck!"

332
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,460
Speaker 1: and throw their hand down in disgust.

333
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:32,660
Speaker 1: But I don't know if this is a good game but I will say this.

334
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:40,800
Speaker 1: If you have a friend who knows the story of Beowulf like our friend Peter Olsen does and tells you the story as you play.

335
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:42,340
Speaker 1: This game is amazing.

336
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,394
Speaker 0: Pete's also had a really good interpretation.

337
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:46,420
Speaker 0: It was very modern.

338
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:50,640
Speaker 1: It was a great interpretation of Beowulf and that added a lot to the game.

339
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,560
Speaker 1: I don't think I would have enjoyed it if I had just straight up played it like a board game.

340
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:58,218
Speaker 0: Yeah that's why I was getting a little bleh and that's why I was like "Pete, what is this

341
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:58,459
Speaker 0: thing?".

342
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,760
Speaker 1: Now Scott, do you know who designed this game?

343
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:01,925
Speaker 0: Nope.

344
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,640
Speaker 0: Rainer Canisian?

345
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,708
Speaker 0: Rainer Canisian!

346
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,299
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't him.

347
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,488
Speaker 0: He does those kinds of games.

348
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:08,039
Speaker 0: He did the Lord of the Rings game.

349
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:12,660
Speaker 1: I don't know if I can recommend this game or not but it's out there.

350
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,053
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a show in it later.

351
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:14,539
Speaker 0: Maybe a video.

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,240
Speaker 1: We've got to play it at least one or two more times.

353
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,280
Speaker 1: It did give us a good idea for another spin-off show like RFE though.

354
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:28,240
Speaker 1: We know how to do the show where Pete tries to tell the story of Beowulf and we interrupt him with perhaps the stupidest questions humans have ever asked.

355
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,660
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter because it still worked despite our stupid questions.

356
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,468
Speaker 1: It worked really well actually.

357
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,940
Speaker 1: Partly because Beowulf doesn't take shit from anyone.

358
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,839
Speaker 0: That's right.

359
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,118
Speaker 1: Scott would ask, "So why didn't he just fucking kill that

360
00:16:39,138 --> 00:16:39,319
Speaker 1: guy?".

361
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,468
Speaker 1: And Pete would be like, "Hold on.

362
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,059
Speaker 0: So Beowulf killed all of

363
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,240
Speaker 0: them.".

364
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,394
Speaker 0: "Why didn't he just hang out in the Denmark meat hall all the time after he rescued it?

365
00:16:46,414 --> 00:16:47,699
Speaker 0: Why would he go back to stupid Sweden?

366
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:47,819
Speaker 0: It's

367
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:48,080
Speaker 0: colder.".

368
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,813
Speaker 1: So things of the day.

369
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:06,770
Speaker 1: If you have ever been to, in the last, I don't know, thirty to forty years, a strip club or a burlesque club or a gentleman's club or anything like that.

370
00:17:07,571 --> 00:17:10,401
Speaker 1: They are scary, seedy dens of losers.

371
00:17:10,421 --> 00:17:13,390
Speaker 1: They're pretty much some of the worst places you can go.

372
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:17,210
Speaker 0: There have been some nerdy burlesques in the city which are relatively popular.

373
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,209
Speaker 1: Ah, but that's what I'm getting to.

374
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,727
Speaker 0: I'm personally not the biggest fan, but there are at least three of them, I think, if not more.

375
00:17:24,747 --> 00:17:24,948
Speaker 0: This is D21.

376
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,910
Speaker 0: Many of our friends participate in them and enjoy them a great deal.

377
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,329
Speaker 1: In fact, a friend of ours invited us to see one of them this weekend that she's in.

378
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:42,850
Speaker 1: But anyway, so there's been a resurgence of burlesque, one, among nerds, like cosplay burlesque and all that, that is kind of harking back to my thing of the day.

379
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:56,830
Speaker 1: Because back in the day, burlesque was surprisingly classy and, while being somewhat titillating, because these pictures are my thing of the day, pretty goddamn titillating.

380
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:02,550
Speaker 1: One, they were adult women, which is, I guess, surprising compared to the modern era of taste in porn.

381
00:18:02,992 --> 00:18:06,490
Speaker 1: And two, one of these pictures perhaps sums everything up to me.

382
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,130
Speaker 1: It tells me that one, humans really haven't changed that much in the last hundred years.

383
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:18,790
Speaker 1: But two, it tells me that the culture around pornography and mainstream gentlemen's clubs has changed a lot.

384
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,285
Speaker 1: This is a picture from behind of D-Lite.

385
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,138
Speaker 1: D-Lite.

386
00:18:26,158 --> 00:18:28,329
Speaker 1: She is a female impersonator.

387
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:30,629
Speaker 1: She looks like a woman from the back.

388
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:37,747
Speaker 1: And she's dancing before an audience, it looks like straight up out of, I don't know, 1950s Americana.

389
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,570
Speaker 1: And the audience is half women, and they're giggling and talking to each other, and the men are kind of laughing.

390
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,070
Speaker 1: The audience reactions are pretty amazing.

391
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,330
Speaker 1: If we could go back to this era of burlesque, I would be a very happy man.

392
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,890
Speaker 0: Where going to a burlesque was like going to a regular movie theater, and there'd be a packed house.

393
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,790
Speaker 0: But remember, in those days it was much more boring, and you couldn't get internet porn.

394
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:06,710
Speaker 1: But dude, this is like 40 year old women with their friends giggling at the female impersonator.

395
00:19:07,211 --> 00:19:08,768
Speaker 0: Here's the thing you understand, right?

396
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,910
Speaker 0: First they invented VHS porn, and they invented porno mags, which meant you could take them home in private.

397
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:17,970
Speaker 0: And then they invented internet porn, so you didn't have to go to the porn store.

398
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:25,449
Speaker 0: Before all those inventions, when say a porno mag would get banned because it was the olden days, right?

399
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:31,769
Speaker 0: You had to go to a place, and everyone would have to go to the place at the same time, because the show was at the same time.

400
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:36,547
Speaker 0: So everyone would go to the place, and you would go, and you would see everyone there, and you'd be like,

401
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:36,908
Speaker 0: "Yeah!".

402
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:41,509
Speaker 0: But now, because we can keep it private, people do.

403
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:43,770
Speaker 1: That's my hypothesis anyway.

404
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,413
Speaker 1: What's the old joke?

405
00:19:44,473 --> 00:19:48,469
Speaker 1: It's something like Catholics don't recognize the legitimacy of the Eastern Orthodoxy.

406
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:51,850
Speaker 1: Eastern Orthodox people don't recognize the legitimacy of the Pope.

407
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,903
Speaker 1: Protestants don't recognize the legitimacy of Catholicism.

408
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,229
Speaker 1: And Southern Baptists don't recognize each other in the liquor store.

409
00:20:02,693 --> 00:20:03,749
Speaker 1: Something along those lines.

410
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,410
Speaker 1: I don't know, I look forward to this resurgence growing, and I kind of like this geeky, because it seems like steampunk culture.

411
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,410
Speaker 0: Well then do Mormons not recognize each other at Starbucks?

412
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:18,310
Speaker 1: I feel like the steampunk, anime, cosplay cultures are starting to overlap.

413
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,390
Speaker 0: Jews don't recognize each other at the barbecue?

414
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:24,430
Speaker 1: With this kind of resurgence of classical burlesque?

415
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:28,470
Speaker 1: And I hope that the next thing to come back is vaudeville!

416
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:30,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

417
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:32,829
Speaker 1: Maybe Gershwin-style reviews?

418
00:20:33,894 --> 00:20:35,010
Speaker 0: You can go see one right now if you want.

419
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,045
Speaker 1: I can actually, I'm thinking about it.

420
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:36,330
Speaker 1: Anyway.

421
00:20:38,101 --> 00:20:38,270
Speaker 1: Anyway.

422
00:20:39,052 --> 00:20:39,558
Speaker 0: Anyway what?

423
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:40,328
Speaker 0: Oh, Things of the Day?

424
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,459
Speaker 0: Yeah!

425
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,108
Speaker 0: Alright, anyone you might remember, I did a Thing of the Day some many months ago.

426
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:48,649
Speaker 0: With the girls.

427
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,129
Speaker 0: And it was very catchy, and I infected many people.

428
00:20:54,374 --> 00:20:56,309
Speaker 1: Is this what, your second favorite thing right now?

429
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

430
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:00,507
Speaker 0: So recently, right?

431
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,030
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong, I'm not making fun.

432
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:08,710
Speaker 1: I am with Scott on these girls, but same as with ponies, I'm not at the level of Scott.

433
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:10,536
Speaker 1: I'm close!

434
00:21:10,556 --> 00:21:11,462
Speaker 1: I'm like 85% there.

435
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:18,990
Speaker 0: So basically the deal is, it's not that I'm actually, I don't like them that much.

436
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,969
Speaker 0: Like I'm a fan, but I kinda like it.

437
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:25,329
Speaker 0: But it's more that I'm just so fascinated by it.

438
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,086
Speaker 0: It's like, this is company SM Entertainment, and they manufactured these musical groups.

439
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,850
Speaker 0: But the musical groups don't, they can sing and dance, but they don't write music or create anything.

440
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:41,290
Speaker 0: And it's almost like Hatsune Miku, it's like the reverse of Hatsune Miku.

441
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:47,610
Speaker 0: Imagine a distant future where people can't even remember that people would actually sing because computers do all the singing.

442
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,630
Speaker 0: So somebody takes a person and trains them like an Olympic gymnast from when they're zero to do singing and dancing.

443
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,809
Speaker 0: And people are like amazed because they've only ever seen virtual idols.

444
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,608
Speaker 0: And something is a real one.

445
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:03,867
Speaker 0: So this company put together nine girls, it's Girls Generation, SNSD.

446
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:10,150
Speaker 0: And they recently had some new songs and new albums, so they're exploding again.

447
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:15,150
Speaker 0: And they were in Madison Square Garden, they came to New York, and they're sort of taking over the world.

448
00:22:15,371 --> 00:22:24,398
Speaker 0: And the reason I thought of them again, because I hadn't thought about them in months since they were my thing of the day previously, was that I'm sitting there and I'm like, huh,

449
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:24,739
Speaker 1: every

450
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:30,110
Speaker 0: time I think something's cool, after like six to twelve months, it becomes even more cooler.

451
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,039
Speaker 0: Like I was into ponies before everyone else.

452
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,610
Speaker 0: I was into DDR before everyone else.

453
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,870
Speaker 1: I want to point out, we were into ponies pretty early.

454
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,049
Speaker 0: I know, that's what I'm saying.

455
00:22:40,775 --> 00:22:41,670
Speaker 0: Not before everyone.

456
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,489
Speaker 1: Much of the first season, a surprising percentage of it.

457
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,456
Speaker 0: About half.

458
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:47,570
Speaker 0: We were halfway through season one.

459
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,130
Speaker 1: And we got into it afterward because so many people were like, you gotta watch this.

460
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,079
Speaker 1: And we were like, really?

461
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:53,221
Speaker 0: Really?

462
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:56,890
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, we were into it pretty early compared to most.

463
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,030
Speaker 0: Before the exponential explosion.

464
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:02,210
Speaker 0: Before it was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, right?

465
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,510
Speaker 0: We were into DDR before it was in early arcades.

466
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,990
Speaker 1: So Scott, are you saying that SND is going to be the next big thing?

467
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:07,461
Speaker 0: It's SNSD.

468
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:14,370
Speaker 0: I'm saying that I was trying to think, what is there that I liked that is going to be big?

469
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,150
Speaker 0: And I was like, the girls.

470
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,501
Speaker 1: The girls, Jerry.

471
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:18,130
Speaker 1: The girls.

472
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:19,834
Speaker 0: And I was right.

473
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:23,949
Speaker 0: If you go look at their stock in the Korean exchange, it's pretty much LA.

474
00:23:24,994 --> 00:23:25,419
Speaker 0: A log.

475
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,209
Speaker 0: It just goes whoop.

476
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,170
Speaker 1: If I had known that I could invest in them when Scott first pointed them out, I would have.

477
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,079
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if you can.

479
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,770
Speaker 0: I think you'd have to go to the Korean exchange.

480
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,250
Speaker 1: No, if there's an ADR, I can.

481
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,078
Speaker 0: I couldn't find an ADR for it.

482
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:40,630
Speaker 0: I looked a little bit, but I don't know how to search for that thing anyway.

483
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:47,070
Speaker 0: So, yeah, they've got a new song and a new everything and it's pretty catchy and, you know, the usual.

484
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:48,168
Speaker 0: That's how it goes.

485
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,353
Speaker 0: And so here they are.

486
00:23:51,373 --> 00:23:59,190
Speaker 0: This video, which my thing of the day is, is from a thing called MAMA, which is the Mnet Something Music Awards, which is basically Korean Grammys.

487
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:00,209
Speaker 0: That's all you have to know about it.

488
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:02,870
Speaker 0: For some reason, the Korean Grammys were in Singapore.

489
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:08,530
Speaker 0: And for some reason, in 2010, the red line will also be there.

490
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,632
Speaker 0: Right.

491
00:24:09,632 --> 00:24:17,430
Speaker 0: 2010, the company, SM Entertainment, that does all these these girls and guys and whatever, was boycotting the MAMA for some reason.

492
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:17,934
Speaker 0: I don't know.

493
00:24:17,954 --> 00:24:18,923
Speaker 0: It's on Wikipedia.

494
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:19,710
Speaker 0: You can learn it yourself.

495
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:21,566
Speaker 0: But in 2011, they went and they went hardcore.

496
00:24:23,352 --> 00:24:25,550
Speaker 0: So they did some crazy remix.

497
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:34,330
Speaker 0: And the thing that I find most interesting is not only, you know, does the girls mess up, which is pretty fascinating, because it's sort of like watching the Olympic gymnast fall off the balance beam.

498
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,233
Speaker 1: It was pretty fascinating.

499
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,164
Speaker 1: when Scott shows me this video and he's like, wait, wait, wait, that one's going to mess up.

500
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:38,445
Speaker 1: Ready?

501
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,670
Speaker 1: One, two, bam.

502
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,324
Speaker 0: Because it's like, you know, Olympic gymnast falling off the balance beam.

503
00:24:43,365 --> 00:24:44,370
Speaker 0: It doesn't happen that often.

504
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:49,110
Speaker 1: Well, in our lifetime, we're going to see the complete Sharon Apple and it won't even matter anymore.

505
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:49,573
Speaker 0: I know.

506
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:50,849
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying is the prelude.

507
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:00,010
Speaker 0: So but not only do they do a remix and stuff, but for some reason, the Korean Grammys are like this crazy concert that normal people go to.

508
00:25:00,491 --> 00:25:02,500
Speaker 0: You know, if you can't go to the Grammy Awards in the

509
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:02,842
Speaker 0: U.S.,

510
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:04,107
Speaker 0: you can't just buy a fucking ticket.

511
00:25:04,549 --> 00:25:04,790
Speaker 0: Right?

512
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:08,390
Speaker 0: It's all famous people from the bottom to the top inside of a theater.

513
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:14,350
Speaker 0: This is outside at an arena with the long stage, like for a real concert where they can, you know, march out into the crowd.

514
00:25:14,792 --> 00:25:16,930
Speaker 0: And most of the people there are just screaming fans.

515
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:28,250
Speaker 0: And I think if I was in charge of the MPAA or not the RAA, whatever, you know, the recording academy, I would definitely make the Grammys an outdoor concert.

516
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,045
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

517
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,390
Speaker 0: And not a theater, you know, clappy high school award night.

518
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,470
Speaker 1: Recording academy.

519
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,534
Speaker 0: Whatever it is.

520
00:25:34,554 --> 00:25:35,843
Speaker 0: I don't know.

521
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:36,910
Speaker 0: Who gives out the Grammy Awards?

522
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,230
Speaker 0: The assholes.

523
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,130
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the Book Club book is a double book.

524
00:25:45,574 --> 00:25:46,189
Speaker 1: Double book.

525
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,289
Speaker 1: Two books by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

526
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:50,270
Speaker 0: I think it's Egyptéry.

527
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,250
Speaker 1: I said it this time because I have an anecdote.

528
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,805
Speaker 1: I started reading, like I started Wind, Sand, and Stars a while ago, but then I kind of stopped.

529
00:25:57,825 --> 00:25:59,010
Speaker 1: I was busy, so I picked it up again.

530
00:25:59,431 --> 00:26:01,470
Speaker 1: I've been blowing through it because it's fucking brilliant.

531
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,174
Speaker 0: No kidding.

532
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,969
Speaker 0: I'm not picking shit here.

533
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:10,010
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say whether or not it's more or less brilliant than The Little Prince because that's what our show is for.

535
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:11,499
Speaker 1: But I will say this.

536
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,609
Speaker 1: I had it in my pocket, right?

537
00:26:13,173 --> 00:26:14,630
Speaker 1: And I was standing in the elevator in my building.

538
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:17,049
Speaker 1: The top was sticking out.

539
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,289
Speaker 0: There was a French guy on the...

540
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,838
Speaker 1: No, and it was just the guy's name.

541
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:20,883
Speaker 1: The author's name.

542
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:22,150
Speaker 1: It wasn't the name of the book or anything.

543
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:28,664
Speaker 1: And a girl in the elevator looks and says, "Oh, I would guess it was The Little Prince, but that is far too thick.

544
00:26:28,825 --> 00:26:30,088
Speaker 1: Is it perhaps Wind, Sand, and

545
00:26:30,128 --> 00:26:30,489
Speaker 1: Stars?".

546
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,135
Speaker 1: And I said, "Why,

547
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:32,498
Speaker 1: yes.".

548
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:34,610
Speaker 1: And we started talking and it was great.

549
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,290
Speaker 0: How come girls like that don't bother me in the elevator?

550
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,930
Speaker 1: So, I was on the subway on the way home just now from my midtown.

551
00:26:43,012 --> 00:26:45,761
Speaker 1: I was reading it and someone interrupts me and says, "Excuse me.

552
00:26:45,822 --> 00:26:47,387
Speaker 1: Is that the same guy who wrote The Little

553
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:47,688
Speaker 1: Prince?".

554
00:26:48,492 --> 00:26:49,639
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Why, yes it is.

555
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,968
Speaker 1: You should read this if you like The Little

556
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,210
Speaker 1: Prince.".

557
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,930
Speaker 1: And he just went on about how The Little Prince was, like, transformative to his life.

558
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,558
Speaker 0: Well, it is.

559
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,330
Speaker 0: That's the point.

560
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:05,710
Speaker 1: This is a pretty damn good book, so if you needed no further reason to read it, carry it around with you because girls may hit on you.

561
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,317
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

562
00:27:06,338 --> 00:27:06,929
Speaker 0: I'm doing that now.

563
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:10,148
Speaker 0: Other meta moments.

564
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,030
Speaker 0: Magfest, baby!

565
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:15,290
Speaker 1: I gotta practice that shit.

566
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:17,250
Speaker 0: That's right, but don't kill the voice, though.

567
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:25,210
Speaker 1: And it is confirmed, so I think I'm going to say, I don't know if it's on the website yet, but we are doing three panels at Magfest.

568
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,030
Speaker 0: Most likely.

569
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,273
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's confirmed.

570
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:29,419
Speaker 1: We are doing one, our own lecture.

571
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,830
Speaker 1: Remember Beyond Dungeons and Dragons, the first big lecture we did?

572
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,730
Speaker 0: Advanced Beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

573
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,652
Speaker 1: Second edition.

574
00:27:34,672 --> 00:27:41,830
Speaker 1: We're basically completely redoing that panel again because our bag of tricks is, like, brand new to these babies at Magfest.

575
00:27:41,934 --> 00:27:42,370
Speaker 1: That's right.

576
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:53,230
Speaker 1: We are going to be on The Moneymaking Game with two other very intelligent people who are probably going to poke amazing holes in any argument we even attempt to make.

577
00:27:54,051 --> 00:28:00,370
Speaker 1: And we are going to be on Gamer Motivations with a similar group of very intelligent people in the gaming industry.

578
00:28:00,771 --> 00:28:03,689
Speaker 1: I feel like we're going to get hosed, but I think it'll be fun.

579
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:07,690
Speaker 0: Most of the time, we're going to be playing fucking games.

580
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,385
Speaker 0: So if you go to Magfest, don't even come to our stupid panels.

581
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:11,270
Speaker 0: Just go to the arcade.

582
00:28:12,035 --> 00:28:12,650
Speaker 0: And play games.

583
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:20,430
Speaker 1: Many of you met us at PAX or Kineticon, and if you want to hang out with us at a con, those are the worst possible cons to try to talk to us.

584
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,870
Speaker 0: I think my goal at Magfest is to beat ice cold beer.

585
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:27,490
Speaker 1: You're going to do that?

586
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,678
Speaker 0: I'm just going to stand there, because you get to play all night, right?

587
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:35,210
Speaker 0: So once night rolls around, I'm going to go over to that, and I'm just going to drink the ice cold beer.

588
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,353
Speaker 1: I will trade you then.

589
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:42,550
Speaker 1: My goal is to beat any of the challenges beyond the easiest ones in that challenge arena.

590
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,030
Speaker 0: I did the Carmen Sandiego one, so it has to be one that has a rating of at least hard.

591
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,870
Speaker 1: Oh no, I did the Bionic Commando one next to you.

592
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,045
Speaker 0: That's like if I did the Mega Man one.

593
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,509
Speaker 0: That's bullshit.

594
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,410
Speaker 1: Scott, the Carmen Sandiego one was trivial.

595
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:01,402
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that the Carmen Sandiego one wouldn't count.

596
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,090
Speaker 0: You have to do one that we both agree counts.

597
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,492
Speaker 0: Yes.

598
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:08,050
Speaker 1: I feel like we should bring the belt and pass it back and forth all con.

599
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,210
Speaker 0: Why don't we just keep scoring a logbook?

600
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,674
Speaker 1: Seriously, go to Magfest.

601
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:15,340
Speaker 1: Pre-reg ends in like three days.

602
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,579
Speaker 0: And check us out on all the internet places.

603
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,450
Speaker 0: Frontroadcrew.com, Facebook, Google+, Twitter.

604
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,572
Speaker 1: I will link to it.

605
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:32,450
Speaker 1: Visit the Geek Nights from YouTube account, because I've added a whole ton of videos, including most recently a bunch of footage from both the Penny Arcade Expo and Burning Apocalypse Con.

606
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:37,410
Speaker 0: We're going to make some awesome videos at Magfest, perhaps of ice cold beer, perhaps of me beating ice cold beer.

607
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,069
Speaker 1: Oh, you believe me, we're going to have video from Magfest, because I've got nothing better to do.

608
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:44,029
Speaker 1: Except play games.

609
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:48,170
Speaker 1: Alright Scott, we're going to do the show, we're going to keep listening to the girls.

610
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:54,850
Speaker 1: You realize, kids, every time I have paused this recording to do anything, the girls have come out.

611
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,600
Speaker 0: No, I've played other things before.

612
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,229
Speaker 0: There was only just this one time.

613
00:29:59,512 --> 00:30:00,578
Speaker 1: So Eminent Domain.

614
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,749
Speaker 1: I literally had never heard of it.

615
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:09,130
Speaker 0: It's okay for the government to take your property, as long as they're using it for good, and it's like a slum or something.

616
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,509
Speaker 1: I never heard of it until a guy showed it to me.

617
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,110
Speaker 1: So we're at Nerd NYC, board game night, doing what we usually do, playing some games.

618
00:30:16,931 --> 00:30:19,069
Speaker 1: And we played some Marrakesh, which is always fun.

619
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,066
Speaker 0: Carpets, baby.

620
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,329
Speaker 0: Have we done a show about carpets?

621
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:23,739
Speaker 1: I don't recall.

622
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,303
Speaker 1: I think so.

623
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:25,190
Speaker 1: Anyway.

624
00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,005
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Hey, you want to play Eminent Domain?

625
00:30:28,086 --> 00:30:28,448
Speaker 1: I brought a

626
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:28,810
Speaker 1: copy.".

627
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,570
Speaker 0: And I said, "That's a game I've never heard of, so yes, I do want to play

628
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,630
Speaker 0: it.".

629
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,658
Speaker 1: No, we didn't say yes yet.

630
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:33,747
Speaker 1: We were like, "What kind of game is

631
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:33,848
Speaker 1: it?".

632
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:39,910
Speaker 0: Pretty much any time someone says a game that I haven't played yet, as a suggestion, I'm basically saying yes.

633
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:41,290
Speaker 0: But I'll question them out beforehand.

634
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,750
Speaker 1: So here's how I would describe this game to someone who knows board games.

635
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:53,581
Speaker 1: It is basically Race for the Galaxy went and had sex with... What's the old game?

636
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,288
Speaker 1: he said it was?

637
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:57,150
Speaker 0: Rome Somethin' Somethin' that he couldn't remember the name of?

638
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rome Somethin' has the same mechanics.

639
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:02,929
Speaker 1: But it's basically Race for the Galaxy had sex with Dominion.

640
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:03,530
Speaker 0: Right.

641
00:31:03,651 --> 00:31:10,510
Speaker 0: It's a typical card deck building game, but it's also like Puerto Rico Race for the Galaxy with the roll-taking mechanism.

642
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:18,450
Speaker 1: But it also steals from this old Rome game where... Imagine if in Puerto Rico, someone picked a role, like the builder.

643
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:24,210
Speaker 1: I could either build or descent, and if I descent, I get to take a coin instead, but I don't get to build.

644
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:30,130
Speaker 0: So the mechanic in Puerto Rico is I take builder, I build, and because I took the builder, I build better.

645
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,270
Speaker 0: Everyone else just builds, and if they don't build, they don't do anything.

646
00:31:35,091 --> 00:31:40,670
Speaker 0: In this game, if you choose a particular role on your turn, then you do it better.

647
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:46,830
Speaker 0: Everyone else can do it, or if they don't do it, can draw a card in descent.

648
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,249
Speaker 0: So it's like everyone always gets something, no matter what.

649
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:54,410
Speaker 0: And the roles, unlike some of the other games, aren't exclusive.

650
00:31:55,691 --> 00:31:59,270
Speaker 0: Everyone can just keep researching over and over again and never do anything else but research.

651
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:00,789
Speaker 0: It'd be dumb, but you could.

652
00:32:02,632 --> 00:32:06,410
Speaker 1: Before we get into the details of it, it has a really interesting mechanic.

653
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,469
Speaker 1: Unlike in Race for the Galaxy, where you build your hand up, but you only really do stuff on your turn.

654
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,069
Speaker 1: Or Dominion, where you throw your whole hand away every turn.

655
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:18,530
Speaker 1: One, you can discard any number of cards at the end of your turn and draw back up to five.

656
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:27,310
Speaker 1: But two, you get cards pretty much constantly throughout the game, because on anyone else's turn, you can piggyback on their action or descent.

657
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,810
Speaker 1: And you piggyback on the action by playing cards that have the same action symbol.

658
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:42,190
Speaker 1: So as a result, it has a really good sort of catch-up mechanic, in that if you're not able to do stuff because everyone else is playing in a different optimal pattern...

659
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,809
Speaker 0: You're drawing a ton of fucking cards.

660
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,130
Speaker 1: So on your turn now, you start with like ten cards in your hand, you do whatever the hell you want.

661
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,630
Speaker 0: You have to be down to five at the end of your turn.

662
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,990
Speaker 0: And you can actually go below five at the end of your turn.

663
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,910
Speaker 0: You can discard as many as you want, but you don't have to discard all of them.

664
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,570
Speaker 0: Just discard as many as you want down to five or less, and then you get to draw back up to five.

665
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:12,050
Speaker 0: So it's really easy to go through your deck, and it's hard to clog it up, especially since it's really easy to use research cards to get rid of cards and get them out of the game.

666
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,870
Speaker 1: Now it's not customizable like Dominion.

667
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:17,790
Speaker 1: You're not making your set of cards to be out there.

668
00:33:18,671 --> 00:33:20,929
Speaker 1: You lay them all out, and there's a ton of them.

669
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:29,490
Speaker 1: And while they're all unique, they pretty much come down to a very small number of types, and then each one has a slight twist from there.

670
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:32,828
Speaker 1: But it's not nearly the problem set I thought it would be.

671
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,602
Speaker 1: I mean, at first he pulls the game out, and I'm like, "What do you mean?

672
00:33:35,622 --> 00:33:37,010
Speaker 1: there's like a hundred unique cards?

673
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,387
Speaker 1: This is bullshit, I have to have my eyes on

674
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:38,569
Speaker 1: this?".

675
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:39,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, how am I supposed to learn all these freaking cards?

676
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,830
Speaker 1: No, they're all like improved research, improved colonization.

677
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is, most of the cards are not even accessible to you.

678
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:56,190
Speaker 0: Like if your starting planet is a Saturn-type planet, then you're pretty much limited to only like three cards that you can get early in the game.

679
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,330
Speaker 0: And most of the cards in the game you'll never be able to even try to get.

680
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:03,030
Speaker 0: The game will be over before you have a chance for those.

681
00:34:03,452 --> 00:34:05,890
Speaker 0: So you don't even have to worry about them, at least not in your first playthrough.

682
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,668
Speaker 0: So you can start playing as a noob.

683
00:34:08,051 --> 00:34:10,806
Speaker 0: You don't need to read all the cards like you do in Dominion, where you have ten cards.

684
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:11,370
Speaker 0: you have to learn.

685
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:16,748
Speaker 0: You can just read like three cards that are the ones that are going to be available to you, and worry about the other ones later.

686
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:28,190
Speaker 1: Now the big part of that is that if your friends have played Dominion before, or any Dominion-like, and they've played either Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico, you almost don't have any rules to teach them.

687
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,469
Speaker 1: This game is so straightforward.

688
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,489
Speaker 0: Another thing I like about this game is that it comes with all these little plastic spaceships.

689
00:34:37,512 --> 00:34:41,850
Speaker 0: So it's like usually in a game, like Dominion, the way to get stuff in Dominion is with money.

690
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:45,469
Speaker 0: So it's like you gotta find a way to make money to get stuff to get victory points.

691
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:46,609
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much the chain.

692
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,610
Speaker 0: It's like no matter what you need, you need money in buys.

693
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,481
Speaker 0: In this game, you just need victory points.

694
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:04,030
Speaker 0: And the two ways to get victory points, the big ones anyway, are to get more planets colonized, or to build, to produce goods and trade them.

695
00:35:04,991 --> 00:35:10,770
Speaker 0: So what you can do is you can either get a few planets, and use those planets to produce and trade, and produce and trade, and produce and trade.

696
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,688
Speaker 1: Which is what I did.

697
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:14,850
Speaker 0: Or you can just try to get a ton of fucking planets.

698
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:18,210
Speaker 0: Or you can try to do both those things in some combination.

699
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,750
Speaker 0: Because those are pretty much the only ways to get a lot of victory points.

700
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:21,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, now that's the big thing.

701
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:25,550
Speaker 1: It removes the situation that many of these kinds of games have.

702
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:29,470
Speaker 1: It's funny how Race for the Galaxy and Dominion both have this problem.

703
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,269
Speaker 1: Not really a problem, but a sort of endgame, the DPT.

704
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,150
Speaker 1: Dutchy Panic Time.

705
00:35:34,691 --> 00:35:47,210
Speaker 1: Where you know the game is wrapping up, so rather than continuing to crank your machine, or go for a big score, you basically start buying cards that you don't need just because they're worth like one or two victory points at the end of the game.

706
00:35:47,911 --> 00:35:50,830
Speaker 1: All the cards that do stuff in this game are worth bupkis.

707
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:51,471
Speaker 0: Yup.

708
00:35:51,894 --> 00:35:54,030
Speaker 0: The only thing that's worth anything are those three things.

709
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,450
Speaker 0: And what's kind of nice is that a lot of games I've played have multiple different strategies.

710
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,250
Speaker 0: You can go for this, you can go for that, and all of those things will give you victory points.

711
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:10,610
Speaker 0: But if you look, a lot of games, for example Kalis, some paths are so much more efficient than others.

712
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:12,541
Speaker 0: Castle is the most efficient.

713
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:13,830
Speaker 0: There are other ways.

714
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:19,830
Speaker 0: You can try to do the jeweler, and the jeweler could win, but it's so much harder to make that jeweler happen.

715
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,269
Speaker 0: It's got a totally different curve.

716
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,510
Speaker 0: This game has three pretty much equal curves on three different victory paths.

717
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:33,930
Speaker 0: So you just pick one of those paths, or some mix of them, and you can legitimately get a bunch of victory points.

718
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,010
Speaker 0: Which means a lot of people can get a lot of victory points.

719
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:42,290
Speaker 0: So it doesn't come down to who picks which path as much as it comes down to who does their path more efficiently.

720
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,916
Speaker 1: Now you also can't cock block.

721
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:47,250
Speaker 1: There's no direct attack, and there's no real indirect attack.

722
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is sort of slightly annoying.

723
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,210
Speaker 1: No, because instead it's an additive game instead of a subtractive game.

724
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,822
Speaker 1: I mean, I like Agricola.

725
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,850
Speaker 1: In fact, I love Agricola.

726
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:57,990
Speaker 0: I kind of like dicking people, though, and I miss the ability to dick.

727
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,497
Speaker 1: I'm also... here's the thing.

728
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:04,109
Speaker 1: I like direct dicking games, but...

729
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,390
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how you swing.

730
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,910
Speaker 1: The direct dicking games have a sort of fundamental gang up on the leader problem.

731
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,948
Speaker 0: Gang it up, huh?

732
00:37:12,911 --> 00:37:18,910
Speaker 1: And you can see why, as you look through the years, direct dicking was replaced by subtractive dicking.

733
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,278
Speaker 0: Looking through the years.

734
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,024
Speaker 0: Lemon party, huh?

735
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,970
Speaker 1: It's not where I'll attack Scott and take his sheep.

736
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:32,150
Speaker 1: Instead, it's where I will go on the space that I know Scott had to go on so he can't get the sheep that he needed.

737
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:32,848
Speaker 0: With my sheep?

738
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,990
Speaker 1: The indirect dicking.

739
00:37:34,931 --> 00:37:36,409
Speaker 0: Directly dicking my sheep where I had to go?

740
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:39,596
Speaker 1: Instead, it's the opposite of dicking.

741
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:53,010
Speaker 1: It's the positive flow, where instead of trying to figure out what the other guy wants to do and denying it to him, you figure out what you want to do, you figure out what he wants to do, and you try to chart a path where he can't ride on your coattails.

742
00:37:54,713 --> 00:38:00,990
Speaker 1: So, I know he's trying to build up his military, so I'm not going to play a military action that lets him ride on.

743
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:06,370
Speaker 1: I'm going to use actions to do my military, I'll let him use the rolls, and I'll ride on his coattails instead.

744
00:38:07,157 --> 00:38:07,770
Speaker 0: You like to ride?

745
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:16,909
Speaker 1: No, I said actions, because there's one other major mechanic, and this is kind of the coup for this game, that put it from "this is pretty cool" to "I bought it on Amazon as soon as I got

746
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:17,089
Speaker 1: home.".

747
00:38:17,494 --> 00:38:18,070
Speaker 0: Also, it's cheap.

748
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:18,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like $20-$25.

749
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,018
Speaker 1: Awesome.

750
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,690
Speaker 0: Great price.

751
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:30,790
Speaker 1: Now, supposedly it was a Kickstarter game, and there's an expansion, there's bits for the expansion in the box, but the game does not come with...

752
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,430
Speaker 0: I think the expansion was a Kickstarter bonus.

753
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:40,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's goods, like types of goods, on the planets in the game, but in the game we played, those don't mean anything.

754
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:48,190
Speaker 1: But I believe they mean something with the expansion, I wasn't 100% clear on that, we have to play it again once it arrives, which might be tomorrow.

755
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:59,730
Speaker 1: But, you don't just have rolls, every card has a roll, or an action, and on your turn, you play an action, which is just you, and then you play a roll.

756
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:10,150
Speaker 0: Right, you don't have to do the action, and a lot of times, there's no reason to do the same thing as an action and a roll, because the roll encompasses the action.

757
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,210
Speaker 0: So the action is always going to be different than the roll.

758
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:24,630
Speaker 1: It gets rid of the situation like in Dominion, where the number of action cards is such a highly controlled and highly game-deterministic mechanic of the cards that are face-up.

759
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:32,730
Speaker 0: And the thing is, you know the game is good, because you always are just so frustrated that if only I could do the roll and then the action, I would be set, but you can't.

760
00:39:33,611 --> 00:39:34,263
Speaker 1: It's the Java situation.

761
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:38,030
Speaker 0: You have to do the roll and let it go around the table, then do the action.

762
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:46,109
Speaker 1: I mean, imagine if T&E, how many times do you think, "Oh my god, if only I could take three actions in Java, if only I had one more action

763
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:46,429
Speaker 1: point.".

764
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:53,330
Speaker 1: Those games, I imagine the way they balance them is they just have a bunch of Germans sit around, and they play the game with, say, 20 action points.

765
00:39:53,731 --> 00:40:01,950
Speaker 1: Then they play again with 19, 18, 17, 16, and as soon as a fistfight breaks out, they stop putting the number down, and that's the game.

766
00:40:03,741 --> 00:40:04,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, it's really good.

767
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,270
Speaker 0: So the other thing I like about the game is that you have to colonize these planets.

768
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,270
Speaker 0: So you use one of the actions, what was it?

769
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,409
Speaker 0: There's colonize?

770
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,344
Speaker 0: No, what was the green one?

771
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,790
Speaker 1: Oh, so you have to explore.

772
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,970
Speaker 0: The exploring one gets you planets, but they're face-down in front of you.

773
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,449
Speaker 0: So you get planets in front of you.

774
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:31,470
Speaker 0: Then you want to flip the planets over to actually activate them, so that once they're activated, they can produce goods, they can give you bonuses like making your hand bigger, and they give you victory points once they're flipped over.

775
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,350
Speaker 0: But, there's two different ways to flip them over.

776
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:41,030
Speaker 0: You can flip them over with ships and attacking them with the military, or you can flip them over with colonization, which is basically diplomacy.

777
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:42,533
Speaker 1: Now this is the huge thing.

778
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:50,430
Speaker 1: Basically, the game has two completely independent currency streams, and all the planets cost different amounts for either one.

779
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,427
Speaker 0: It's like if in Dominion, it was like, you can buy this for five golds or three potions.

780
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,745
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, well I can either do potions or I can do money, and I don't have to do both.

781
00:41:01,785 --> 00:41:03,230
Speaker 0: Doing both actually is kind of dumb.

782
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:23,910
Speaker 1: My plan, and actually it was working pretty well, is I focused on colonizing, but instead of trashing, because that's a trash mechanic, instead of trashing my military cards, whenever I had them, I rode on people's coattails and built up a small reserve of ships to then, hopefully, snipe up a quick planet near the end of the game.

783
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,494
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's actually tough, right?

784
00:41:25,514 --> 00:41:31,590
Speaker 0: Because I'm sitting there thinking, well, I don't want to keep picking colonize and military, because then I'm helping everybody, right?

785
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,096
Speaker 0: I just want to keep picking one that no one else is picking, so it only helps me.

786
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:41,930
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'll pick military, I'll go all the way with the ships, no one else will pick ships, and thus when I pick ships for me, it won't help anyone else.

787
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:42,591
Speaker 0: So I did that.

788
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:46,819
Speaker 0: But, it's like when other people pick colonize, I was dicked.

789
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,730
Speaker 0: So it's like, well I kind of want to pick colonize sometimes, but I don't want to pick it a lot, because that helps other people.

790
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:59,261
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, you want to go, you want to apple and you want to orange, and you're not quite sure what the right balance is.

791
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,284
Speaker 0: So it's like, I did like 75% military, 25% colonizing.

792
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,393
Speaker 1: Granted, it's telling.

793
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:09,529
Speaker 0: Because the colonizing just sort of came in for free when other people picked it, so I'm like, well...

794
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:20,810
Speaker 1: It's funny, we were playing kind of mirror strategies, like we were on the opposite side of these kind of, opposite side of the coin mechanics, and Scott won, and I was basically, he beat me by like one point.

795
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:21,973
Speaker 0: I beat you by two points.

796
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:28,490
Speaker 1: Well because you had that bullshit luck of the card, the exact card you needed, basically I was guaranteed to win.

797
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,596
Speaker 0: The card that I bought, with my research.

798
00:42:31,737 --> 00:42:38,030
Speaker 1: Unless Scott had one card that he had bought in the course of the game in his hand by the time it was his turn on the last round.

799
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 1: So I forced it, and then he had the card, so he won.

800
00:42:42,582 --> 00:42:44,708
Speaker 1: But yeah, Scott was first place, I was second place.

801
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,230
Speaker 0: That's right.

802
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,355
Speaker 1: It was a good game, I want to play it again.

803
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:47,481
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was very good.

804
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:49,149
Speaker 1: I won Marrakesh though, so fuck you.

805
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:50,513
Speaker 0: The random game?

806
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:51,636
Speaker 1: It wasn't that random.

807
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:56,930
Speaker 0: This game, actually, this game has no randomness of the planet stack.

808
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:01,780
Speaker 0: And it has randomness of the draw of your deck.

809
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,762
Speaker 1: Yes, your deck's draw.

810
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,527
Speaker 1: But not your deck's odds.

811
00:43:04,968 --> 00:43:05,830
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

812
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:14,510
Speaker 0: So, very little randomness in this game, but if you like Race of the Galaxy, if you like Dominion, if you like Puerto Rico, if you like any deck building, or any of those sorts of games.

813
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,617
Speaker 1: It's surprisingly great, especially considering it's at most $25.

814
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:18,358
Speaker 1: It's $32.04 on Amazon.

815
00:43:18,378 --> 00:43:24,310
Speaker 1: I just bought it on Amazon for $23.

816
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:27,901
Speaker 0: Well, I see it on eminent domain for $32.04 on Amazon.

817
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:30,629
Speaker 1: Interesting, maybe people were buying it, I don't know.

818
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:30,769
Speaker 0: Maybe.

819
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,354
Speaker 0: 7 Wonders is $35.58.

820
00:43:33,354 --> 00:43:34,697
Speaker 0: That's a good price.

821
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:35,118
Speaker 0: That is.

822
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,468
Speaker 1: One interesting thing, we played it with 4, that felt right, it's 2-4 players.

823
00:43:42,031 --> 00:43:42,752
Speaker 0: Oh.

824
00:43:42,772 --> 00:43:45,996
Speaker 1: And everyone agrees it's best with 3 players.

825
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:47,038
Speaker 0: Interesting.

826
00:43:47,098 --> 00:43:53,487
Speaker 1: Which, think about it, all the 3 player games that have the fundamental breakdown have either indirect dicking or direct dicking.

827
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,810
Speaker 1: that allows the Apple Apple Orange.

828
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,076
Speaker 0: I can actually see it being best with 3, right?

829
00:43:58,097 --> 00:44:01,708
Speaker 0: Because you've got the military, you've got the colonizing, and you've got the producing.

830
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:12,650
Speaker 1: You've also now got to choose between 2 different strats, like every time you take an action you have 2 players to look at, and most likely any action you do will benefit one or the other.

831
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:18,630
Speaker 0: But there's 3 pretty much paths to victory points, so with 4 players, 2 people have to pick the same one.

832
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,290
Speaker 1: Yep, and I had to share the same one with the experienced player who brought the game, who was sitting to my rights.

833
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:31,070
Speaker 0: Right, so those 2 people are pretty much going to be sort of dragged down, or maybe they'll be dragged up by Appling with each other, it's a tough call.

834
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:31,430
Speaker 1: No.

835
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:32,173
Speaker 0: Right?

836
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:32,675
Speaker 0: No.

837
00:44:33,097 --> 00:44:36,530
Speaker 0: And then the other 2 people basically, right, so it's like, well, you know, with 3 players...

838
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,195
Speaker 1: I was not dragged up by him, he bought things I needed.

839
00:44:39,455 --> 00:44:48,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, with 3 players, everyone can pick their own path and see who does their path most efficiently, but 2 players is going to be a whole bunch of stuff that goes undone.

840
00:44:48,691 --> 00:44:55,868
Speaker 1: But I feel like this elegantly gets around the 3 player problem by having, it has like the positive counter example to digging.

841
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,560
Speaker 0: You can't gang up on people because it has no digging.

842
00:44:58,701 --> 00:44:58,962
Speaker 0: Yes.

843
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:00,290
Speaker 0: So 3 players is just fine.

844
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,206
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
