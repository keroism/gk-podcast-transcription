1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,377
Speaker 0: It's Monday January 21st.

2
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:13,320
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:16,670
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is a cop-out episode of geek nights.

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,048
Speaker 0: We talk about keyboards.

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,395
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:35,060
Speaker 1: Well, it's a MLK day Yeah, and I guess last year my company did not have this day off, but I wasn't working there at the time.

7
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,076
Speaker 1: But this year they do have it off.

8
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:40,235
Speaker 1: So Alright is the first time in many years.

9
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:41,080
Speaker 1: I've had this day off.

10
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:49,828
Speaker 0: I find it wonderful and hilarious that Every single one of us in the front row crew had today Martin Luther King day off Except Scott Johnson.

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,371
Speaker 1: Yeah.

12
00:00:51,337 --> 00:01:00,160
Speaker 0: Oh well so everyone else came over for burning wheel and all our business and then Everyone just kind of stuck around and we hung out Sunday night, but not Scott.

13
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,109
Speaker 0: He had to go all the way back to Pennsylvania.

14
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,534
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sucks.

15
00:01:04,574 --> 00:01:12,353
Speaker 1: I hate these days cuz it's like I'm home from work I don't have to go and I could do what I want But then the mail doesn't come and some things are closed.

16
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:17,387
Speaker 1: that would normally be open and it's like ah I need a day I need a day off when no one else does.

17
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:26,080
Speaker 0: the worst thing is that when I get a holiday some holiday Especially if it's on like a Monday Sometimes it's obvious that the garbage won't get picked up.

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,917
Speaker 0: But sometimes I don't know what if the garbage or the city or whatever respects the holiday.

19
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,062
Speaker 1: It's not the city It's it's.

20
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,790
Speaker 1: we have a private trash pickup.

21
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,659
Speaker 0: I think it's contracted by the city.

22
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:39,195
Speaker 1: I'm not quite sure but it doesn't say city a beacon on the truck.

23
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:39,797
Speaker 1: That's all I know.

24
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:43,609
Speaker 0: But yeah The city's often contracted out.

25
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,400
Speaker 1: Yeah often but indeed in like New York City It says, you know New York City Department of Sanitation on the truck.

26
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:51,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, because New York City has a full Department of Sanitation.

27
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:56,216
Speaker 1: Yes But anyway I usually look at if the neighbors have their trash out then we should put ours out that's.

28
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,407
Speaker 1: and if the neighbors have their Recycling out then I should put my recycling out.

29
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:08,539
Speaker 1: Of course if every neighbor is thinking that way Then it's like at least as long as one neighbor's got it, right then we're okay, but if not then we're in trouble.

30
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:23,507
Speaker 0: Well, I think the worst part is that like our one neighbor down like in the basement always thinks that we're dumb because we never remember When the like when the recyclables go out or whatever and she can't understand that we just care so little that we always forget And we just don't pay attention to it.

31
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,873
Speaker 1: Well, we do pay attention to it.

32
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:28,113
Speaker 0: It's just sometimes every week We say hey did the recyclables go out?

33
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,104
Speaker 0: Oh We'll I'm out there.

34
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,810
Speaker 1: in case we need some sort of like.

35
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,785
Speaker 1: how did they know originally there must be a schedule somewhere Where you know what?

36
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,359
Speaker 0: I went to the beacon website and there was jackaw.

37
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:42,440
Speaker 1: I know that's the sort of thing that should be on a town website, but no town has a good website.

38
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:45,559
Speaker 1: There might be one town out there which has like a Linux nerd for me.

39
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:45,980
Speaker 0: You know what?

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,760
Speaker 0: The real problem is that a lot of towns and cities take care of things like recycling or whatever the schedules are for city things.

41
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,371
Speaker 0: They do it in kind of a old world intuitive way.

42
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:04,180
Speaker 0: Like it's every other week or something like that When really it should be some sort of algorithm that you can determine just by having knowledge.

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,300
Speaker 0: For example, it'll be on the first and third week of every month Mm-hmm, but by doing it every other week, it slowly kind of gets out of skew.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,108
Speaker 0: Sometimes it happens three times in a month.

45
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:15,574
Speaker 0: It's just it's BS.

46
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:16,880
Speaker 1: It is quite BS.

47
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:18,732
Speaker 1: It's not the most well thought-out thing.

48
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:19,940
Speaker 1: plus they should also.

49
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:25,920
Speaker 1: You know that you can look at statistics of like, you know how much the trash trucks fill up.

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:32,740
Speaker 1: You know when different times they go out and you could actually instead time the trucks to send them out as few times as possible.

51
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:41,439
Speaker 1: But you know at certain times of the year when there's more trash like holidays You could send them out more and other times of the year like during summer vacation when there's less trash send them out less.

52
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:58,348
Speaker 1: You could figure that all that shit out and then as long as there was in communication with the people via Technology, which most people don't know how to use but at least the newspaper also, you know People would know when it was because it would it would say and it wouldn't matter if you didn't remember because it would remind you Like hey trash today.

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,094
Speaker 0: Well, the the worst thing is that Beacons website has that animated gif of the fire.

54
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:05,861
Speaker 1: Oh Really?

55
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,667
Speaker 1: Yeah, I gotta check this out.

56
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,818
Speaker 0: that animated gif was on the website the last time I checked.

57
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,071
Speaker 1: good god Let me check the city of Beacon homepage.

58
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:16,244
Speaker 1: I Don't see a fire.

59
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:17,348
Speaker 1: Oh my god, it's there.

60
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:18,411
Speaker 0: it's there now.

61
00:04:18,452 --> 00:04:22,167
Speaker 0: now if any of you don't know what up to what I'm referred It's there for a memorial thing.

62
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:37,220
Speaker 0: It's been there since we moved here Good guy that memorial thing If you don't know what I'm talking about that animated gif was this someone made an animated gif of a fire and in the mid 90s late 90s before there was really a web internet to speak of.

63
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:53,340
Speaker 0: People who made websites were mostly people who were between 11 and 11 point one years old and nothing was cooler Than an animated gif of a rotating skull and bones with fire and fire or Some skull and fire.

64
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:55,106
Speaker 0: people would always have like that.

65
00:04:55,527 --> 00:05:03,489
Speaker 1: email me link at the bottom and the email by email with a skull on fire a Flaming skull envelope was the best animated gif ever.

66
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:10,213
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you think websites are ugly now take a trip back to 1994 and you'll see the day once that was like.

67
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:15,613
Speaker 1: this is what a dig would look like in 1997. and or I think there was also maybe one like.

68
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,080
Speaker 1: here's an example of websites, right?

69
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,823
Speaker 1: And it was that's.

70
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,628
Speaker 1: that's what it's like.

71
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:32,956
Speaker 0: So anyway in the news I don't think we have a lot to talk about because uh Aside from the stock market collapsing and Sprint being completely fucked and all that sort of fun stuff Something much more important happened last week that we didn't talk about.

72
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:33,438
Speaker 1: Well, isn't that?

73
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:43,820
Speaker 1: It's not that important really but but yeah last week, you know It was Monday with sci-tech day and we knew that on Tuesday Steve Jobs was gonna open his big fat mouth again.

74
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:51,556
Speaker 0: and this was important to me because I am going to buy a laptop and All the rumors were that Apple was gonna announce something with a laptop.

75
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:55,100
Speaker 0: and you know Just being even if I probably wasn't gonna get an apple.

76
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,284
Speaker 0: but there was a decent chance a non-zero chance that Apple was going to announce a Laptop product.

77
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,012
Speaker 0: that would have been exactly what I wanted.

78
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:04,640
Speaker 1: and yeah, it was a non-zero chance.

79
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:08,018
Speaker 1: It was actually a pretty but now we've determined that it is a zero chance.

80
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,407
Speaker 0: Yeah So what all was announced at Macworld?

81
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:11,069
Speaker 0: Well one the.

82
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:14,620
Speaker 0: the new laptop is not a 12-inch MacBook Pro.

83
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,366
Speaker 0: Thank you fanboys making stuff up.

84
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:20,480
Speaker 0: It is in fact a very very thin and largely useless laptop.

85
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean he's basically the thinness is good.

86
00:06:24,401 --> 00:06:29,120
Speaker 1: The battery life is not as good as the battery life I have which is nine hours, but theirs is five hours.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,593
Speaker 1: But five hours is still pretty respectable compared to other laptops.

88
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:35,363
Speaker 1: You're like to one hour Right, so it's not bad.

89
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:38,050
Speaker 1: It's then it's light is wicked light.

90
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:39,734
Speaker 1: It's got the wireless.

91
00:06:39,995 --> 00:06:41,840
Speaker 1: It's got a good enough keyboard.

92
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:43,956
Speaker 1: It's got the multi touch touchpad.

93
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:44,399
Speaker 1: That's good.

94
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:50,197
Speaker 1: The resolution is pretty decent but it's 13 inches where I have almost the same resolution, but my laptops only 10.6 inches.

95
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:54,723
Speaker 1: So, you know It's $1,800 I think about.

96
00:06:54,743 --> 00:07:02,079
Speaker 0: so now it's it's $1,800 for the basic standard one that doesn't have all the good stuff.

97
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the tricky part.

98
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:09,199
Speaker 1: Mine is 1650 for the base, but then I customized mine up to like 2k.

99
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm probably just going to get the next iteration of Scott's.

100
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,456
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have the p72 30, but I think they're coming out with like a p8 some.

101
00:07:16,516 --> 00:07:18,725
Speaker 0: but no there are two In fact MacBook Air's.

102
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:19,789
Speaker 0: there is the.

103
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,194
Speaker 0: well, they don't actually have names.

104
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,479
Speaker 0: There's the one and the other one.

105
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:28,233
Speaker 0: now They both have Intel core 2 duos But the slightly better one has a 1.8 gigahertz instead of a 1.6 gigahertz.

106
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,371
Speaker 1: How much more does it cost to upgrade that particular to that?

107
00:07:33,014 --> 00:07:38,610
Speaker 0: and also the Normal one has an 80 gigabyte, you know regular hard drive.

108
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:42,760
Speaker 0: the slightly better one has a 64 gigabyte solid-state drive.

109
00:07:43,905 --> 00:07:52,840
Speaker 1: So and that's the only difference Yeah I have a 16 gigabyte solid-state drive that I bought aftermarket and put into my laptop because Ubuntu killed the normal hard drive.

110
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,408
Speaker 1: But yeah, that was like $200.

111
00:07:54,408 --> 00:07:54,871
Speaker 1: so a 64 gigabyte one.

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,845
Speaker 1: That's got to be wicked moneys.

113
00:07:58,167 --> 00:08:05,992
Speaker 0: Now the difference between these two is Two gigahertz point two gigahertz more and a solid-state drive.

114
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:08,559
Speaker 1: Well, the solid-state drive is a huge improvement, especially with 64 gig.

115
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,442
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

116
00:08:09,462 --> 00:08:11,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's you don't need a 64 gig solid-state.

117
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,441
Speaker 0: But uh, Chris the difference in price the normal one is $1,800.

118
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:18,263
Speaker 0: all told it's 1790.

119
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:18,924
Speaker 0: It's $1,800.

120
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,451
Speaker 0: The other one's three thousand three thousand one hundred dollars.

121
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,362
Speaker 1: That's more than the eight core Mac Pro More.

122
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:36,200
Speaker 0: it's more money to get that thing and the only core Mac Pro is a solid-state drive and point two more giga.

123
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,620
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's point two times two more gigahertz, but still that's not gonna be that much of a day.

124
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,706
Speaker 1: No, it's not that much.

125
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:42,551
Speaker 1: That's pretty stupid.

126
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:44,100
Speaker 1: If you buy that one, that's all I can say.

127
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,816
Speaker 0: Now the real deal is when when I saw it, I saw it's really thin.

128
00:08:47,856 --> 00:08:48,740
Speaker 0: Hey brought it out in Manila.

129
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,685
Speaker 0: Hahaha, I get it.

130
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,913
Speaker 0: It is stupidly thin like it's.

131
00:08:53,013 --> 00:09:00,480
Speaker 1: it's crazily amazingly thin Yeah, but the problem is is that in order to make it so thin they had to cut some things out which is understandable.

132
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,119
Speaker 1: There's no way you can make something thinner without cutting something out.

133
00:09:03,722 --> 00:09:06,110
Speaker 1: The problem is they cut out too much.

134
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,439
Speaker 1: First of all, there's only one USB port.

135
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:19,061
Speaker 1: now that's not too bad except until you realize that you can't plug your iPod in and Apple.

136
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,490
Speaker 0: you're not supposed to be using the USB Mouse gonna have the Bluetooth.

137
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,719
Speaker 1: Okay, so get the use Bluetooth Mouse.

138
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:24,361
Speaker 1: It's alright Okay.

139
00:09:24,703 --> 00:09:29,220
Speaker 1: Well, what if you want to connect it to a wired network and also use your iPod at the same time?

140
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,312
Speaker 0: Well, actually you have to get a special dongle, but the special dongle is USB.

141
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:34,054
Speaker 0: Yeah.

142
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:34,476
Speaker 0: Yeah.

143
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:34,736
Speaker 1: Yes.

144
00:09:34,777 --> 00:09:37,120
Speaker 1: You need to use because the thing It's a but I've used be hub.

145
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,779
Speaker 1: So what's the point of having this really light?

146
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,166
Speaker 0: Thing if I need to have carry around all these extra things you shouldn't need a wire because it's an Apple thing It's just wireless.

147
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:46,820
Speaker 0: It's just use it by itself.

148
00:09:46,881 --> 00:09:48,820
Speaker 0: In fact, supposedly you're supposed to be able to share.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is not.

150
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:54,680
Speaker 0: supposedly they have something called remote disk where it doesn't come with an optical drive even nothing.

151
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,079
Speaker 0: There's no drives in this thing except for the one hard drive.

152
00:09:57,682 --> 00:10:02,900
Speaker 0: But you can share a DVD or CD drive from a nearby Mac or Windows PC.

153
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,779
Speaker 0: It's probably not gonna work at all with Linux.

154
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:13,684
Speaker 1: No but if basically you install some software on a Windows or Mac and then you install and then from the Mac air you say look For CD roms.

155
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:19,440
Speaker 1: and basically you say it shows you all the computers on your network that are running the software and you say connect.

156
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:25,100
Speaker 1: And then a pop-up shows on the computer that has the disk drive and on that pop-up you say yes.

157
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:30,013
Speaker 1: and now the MacBook Air acts like that CD ROM in that other computer.

158
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:38,180
Speaker 1: is its CD ROM or DVD ROM or whatever, but You know the part of having a laptop especially for us the commuters is watching DVDs on the train.

159
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,064
Speaker 0: Yep, that was the thing.

160
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:48,778
Speaker 0: if if the MacBook Air had had an optical drive in it somehow I probably would have bought it despite all the other problems because it's it's a great little laptop.

161
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,944
Speaker 0: But the thing is It's okay.

162
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:52,050
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty good.

163
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:53,860
Speaker 0: It would do everything I needed it to do.

164
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:00,146
Speaker 0: It'd be a fantastic laptop for me to use for geek nights and going around and no Night, so doesn't have a microphone in hole.

165
00:11:00,608 --> 00:11:01,411
Speaker 0: I wouldn't need one.

166
00:11:01,511 --> 00:11:04,300
Speaker 0: All I need is the USB to use my external sound card.

167
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:05,885
Speaker 0: I'm never.

168
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:14,360
Speaker 1: I'm never recording anything with analog again Yeah, but even so I think the fact that it only has one USB and the fact that it's missing all these things.

169
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,299
Speaker 0: I don't think the one USB is a problem at all.

170
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:26,752
Speaker 1: Well, it's that you need a lot of external things like an external sound card to get these sort of necessary features that were cut Out now because it plays just fine even to use the video out.

171
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,670
Speaker 1: It has one of those mini HDMI holes So you need to get an adapter for that.

172
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,460
Speaker 0: That's because regular HDMI is too thick.

173
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,483
Speaker 1: I know that.

174
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:42,380
Speaker 1: but the point is is that because they cut enough out that you even though it's thinner and lighter The purpose is defeated because now you have to carry this extra shit around.

175
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,180
Speaker 1: I mean mine is defeated because mine is thicker, but I don't have to carry an extra shit.

176
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,780
Speaker 0: I don't think the purpose is defeated because the people who would buy this sort of thing wouldn't need to carry any that stuff around.

177
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:52,194
Speaker 1: I don't know.

178
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:58,820
Speaker 0: I think Not that many people especially because you know, you're an Apple person you can buy all this Apple stuff.

179
00:11:59,122 --> 00:12:02,040
Speaker 0: You're gonna be renting movies or buying movies with iTunes.

180
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,553
Speaker 1: You know, if you're a moron, you're a moron.

181
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:05,538
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

182
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:08,180
Speaker 0: Yeah Also, I think you're way too down on this.

183
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,240
Speaker 1: Well, also if you want to get online with like, you know your cell phone thing or whatever.

184
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:17,145
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a PCMCI slot So you can't even do that.

185
00:12:17,386 --> 00:12:18,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're an Apple person.

186
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,913
Speaker 0: You don't do that.

187
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:23,389
Speaker 0: Okay, sure Whatever plus it has a 802.11n.

188
00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,072
Speaker 1: Uh But it'll probably and isn't finalized.

189
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:29,940
Speaker 1: but a lot of Apple products now have the end.

190
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:38,640
Speaker 1: So I'm sure it'll work with the other end Apple products, but You know, it's not end is not changed and is not going to change.

191
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,152
Speaker 0: You sure it's finalized as far as matters for technology.

192
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:43,035
Speaker 1: Then why don't we go get it?

193
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:44,540
Speaker 0: Why indeed?

194
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,936
Speaker 0: But you're the only person in this house uses wireless.

195
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:47,460
Speaker 1: That's true.

196
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:51,739
Speaker 1: I guess it would make it hard for other people in the house to connect if you're using n and they were using BG.

197
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,400
Speaker 0: Oh, well, well pretty much everything down.

198
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:58,063
Speaker 1: I know it down great gracefully, but then it would suck for us because you know Our ends would be.

199
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,188
Speaker 0: so you can know much about in.

200
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:00,794
Speaker 1: it's just better than V and G.

201
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:04,852
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Do I have to do a show about it so I can explain exactly what any.

202
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 1: is it different than B and G anyway?

203
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,319
Speaker 0: So, uh, what else did Apple announce?

204
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:19,812
Speaker 1: They got their movie rental business and the movie rental things kind of weird for me because at first I was like, oh That's not so bad because I thought about you know, the real-world situation.

205
00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:20,495
Speaker 1: We're sitting there.

206
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:21,719
Speaker 1: You want to watch a movie?

207
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:23,608
Speaker 1: And we don't have net.

208
00:13:23,628 --> 00:13:25,120
Speaker 1: we don't have it on Netflix right now.

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,116
Speaker 1: So we'd have to wait for Netflix to send the DVD, but friends are over and you want to watch the movie right now But you don't have the DVD.

210
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:37,807
Speaker 1: We could go to iTunes click on it wait a few minutes and then watch and it would cost the same amount as Blockbuster But only without the driving.

211
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,579
Speaker 1: and I said that's not really so bad.

212
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:44,543
Speaker 1: But then you think and I'm like, but wait this mad DRM is going on there Let me blah.

213
00:13:45,126 --> 00:13:48,780
Speaker 1: and I and it's it's sorta you think about it more and more and you're like, huh?

214
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:52,023
Speaker 1: But then you look at the Engadget.

215
00:13:52,063 --> 00:14:01,119
Speaker 1: put up this great post that has a list of things you can and can't do with the rented videos and it's like oh Well, plus the thing is then Netflix.

216
00:14:02,183 --> 00:14:04,819
Speaker 0: You can pretty much do a million times more with Netflix.

217
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:19,948
Speaker 1: Yeah It's at Netflix sort of undercut Apple because a few days before Apple made this announcement Netflix announced they were going to remove met most of the restrictions on there, you know on demand go to their website watch video service Which is great, even though that's DRM.

218
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:20,470
Speaker 1: Do you know?

219
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,300
Speaker 1: you're going there and you're watching the movie somewhat streaming ish.

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,107
Speaker 1: So it's not you know, it's not like.

221
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:25,890
Speaker 1: you know, you're not.

222
00:14:26,453 --> 00:14:28,240
Speaker 1: you don't think you're buying it or renting it.

223
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,896
Speaker 1: You know you're going and you're watching it and you can go of course and you're paying sided.

224
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,665
Speaker 0: All right We don't even use Linux downstairs.

225
00:14:34,685 --> 00:14:37,734
Speaker 0: We have a real legitimate operating system as far as you know.

226
00:14:37,854 --> 00:14:40,201
Speaker 0: old-world poorly run businesses consider It's.

227
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:41,186
Speaker 0: it's a Mac.

228
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:42,232
Speaker 0: It's a standard Mac.

229
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:43,700
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and it's hooked up to the TV.

230
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,833
Speaker 0: Why don't we just go to Netflix and watch stuff like that?

231
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:46,799
Speaker 0: I'll use the Netflix thing.

232
00:14:47,522 --> 00:14:49,268
Speaker 0: It doesn't work on Macs at all.

233
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,954
Speaker 0: It even says will not work on a Mac.

234
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:51,175
Speaker 1: Yep.

235
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:52,620
Speaker 1: The Netflix thing is Windows only.

236
00:14:53,703 --> 00:14:55,438
Speaker 1: I guess that's part of their DRM bullshit.

237
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,782
Speaker 1: So It's.

238
00:14:56,862 --> 00:15:04,320
Speaker 1: it's really not a good situation for people who want to Download movies right now and watch them on some of a cheaper rental basis.

239
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:09,120
Speaker 0: I'd be willing to pay even a lot more to just be able to watch movies on my computer downloaded.

240
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:15,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd be willing to pay quite a bit for that But every possible way to do that is just poorly done and not worth them.

241
00:15:16,302 --> 00:15:18,732
Speaker 0: It's not worth the money and I am willing to pay a lot.

242
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:19,535
Speaker 0: So that says something.

243
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,532
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm willing to pay Up to the price of DVD.

244
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,324
Speaker 1: pretty much, you know Cuz I mean like.

245
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,380
Speaker 1: I got Netflix and Netflix is cheap.

246
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:30,393
Speaker 0: Wait, you're willing to pay up to the price of DVD to watch a movie.

247
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,684
Speaker 0: Hmm to rent a movie Oh, it's a rent it.

248
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,154
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but I meant to see it.

249
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,019
Speaker 0: I don't want to keep it.

250
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,983
Speaker 1: Oh just to see it.

251
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:42,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I try not to buy DVDs anymore because I don't want to keep them in the house We have all the DVDs we have just pile up.

252
00:15:42,914 --> 00:15:43,055
Speaker 0: Yeah.

253
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:48,940
Speaker 1: Well just to see it I would pay, you know, Netflix divided by discs divided by time, you know, that's sadly we don't even watch our Netflix's.

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,420
Speaker 1: But well, you didn't mail them back.

255
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,159
Speaker 1: I bet you if you mail back the Shinjuku Triad Society piece of crap.

256
00:15:53,683 --> 00:15:57,483
Speaker 0: The only reason we watch that movie is because we had a free day I know.

257
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:00,180
Speaker 1: but if you sent that back, we might get something we'd be excited about watching.

258
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:04,400
Speaker 0: I think the real problem is just that we don't have a lot of time to watch movies anymore.

259
00:16:04,742 --> 00:16:06,880
Speaker 1: Maybe we just need a new determination of movie watching.

260
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,135
Speaker 1: I mean, I've had a new determination of anime watching recently and it's kind of working out.

261
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know Maybe if we stop playing video games.

262
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:15,915
Speaker 1: I'm not playing so many video games, even though I should.

263
00:16:15,935 --> 00:16:16,659
Speaker 0: I got a punch out.

264
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:18,046
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I gotta beat that.

265
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,392
Speaker 1: Mario Galaxy is what I have to do.

266
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:22,164
Speaker 0: I haven't even played Mario Galaxies yet I haven't even touched it.

267
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:26,040
Speaker 0: I have not other than playing as the second part of Scott's multiplayer business.

268
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,207
Speaker 0: I have not touched that game.

269
00:16:27,388 --> 00:16:28,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could play it someday.

270
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:29,400
Speaker 1: It's not going anywhere.

271
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,597
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be any different a year from now than it is now But then advanced wars is gonna come out and actually anything but that next week.

272
00:16:35,638 --> 00:16:39,134
Speaker 0: It'll be out Okay, so what else there's?

273
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:39,980
Speaker 0: time capsule?

274
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's see.

275
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:45,340
Speaker 1: the time capsule thing I think is the perfect example of what is wrong with Apple, right?

276
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,844
Speaker 1: It's basically all it is.

277
00:16:46,904 --> 00:16:53,811
Speaker 1: hardware wise is a hard drive with a wireless adapter and some other bits, right a Hard drive with a wireless adapter.

278
00:16:53,831 --> 00:16:54,900
Speaker 1: There's a lot you could do with that.

279
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,213
Speaker 1: They could have made a wireless NAS device, which is incredibly powerful and useful and it's.

280
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,500
Speaker 1: it's not too bad considering the price, you know.

281
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:04,750
Speaker 1: But what they do is the software they put on it.

282
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 1: You pretty much can only use it for a time capsule.

283
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:12,619
Speaker 1: You can't use that hard drive as a NAS or a network file server or anything At least maybe you could hack it to do that.

284
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,686
Speaker 1: but that's not what it does out of the box.

285
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:27,046
Speaker 1: and it's like they make hardware that's capable of ABC D and E and They put software on it that's only capable of a B and some of C and D and E are right out and they charge more than they would for that.

286
00:17:27,086 --> 00:17:45,353
Speaker 1: competitors charge for ABC D and E and the only difference is that the AB and half of C that they do do are very polished and shiny and And so if I didn't know about technology as a normal person That's kind of great because I'd rather have a shiny A and B that I need and D and E I don't even know or care about just cuz I don't know better.

287
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,299
Speaker 1: So it's a good time.

288
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:53,460
Speaker 1: But once you know better, there's no logical way you can bring yourself to make such a decision to purchase a product like that.

289
00:17:53,662 --> 00:17:57,839
Speaker 1: it's just not gonna happen and Most of Apple's products are like that.

290
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,880
Speaker 1: The iPhone is capable of everything under the Sun hardware wise and the software lets it do like ten things.

291
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:09,502
Speaker 0: I just really don't get why they wouldn't have made it be more versatile because they could have made it really really slick and integrated With file share.

292
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:14,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean imagine if Apple announced Apple Network NAS works perfectly with all computers.

293
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:15,680
Speaker 1: Yeah is amazing.

294
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,446
Speaker 0: It's plug it in.

295
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:17,413
Speaker 0: It's wireless.

296
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:24,780
Speaker 0: put it in your house And not only is all your stuff backed up to it all the time, but you can save all your files there.

297
00:18:25,362 --> 00:18:26,746
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could have done that.

298
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:30,720
Speaker 0: put your iTunes library there and then sync with it with your laptop with the same hardware.

299
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:31,644
Speaker 1: But they didn't.

300
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:36,284
Speaker 0: and it's kind of sad because again, it's a product that if it did one more Yes, that would be a huge.

301
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:40,880
Speaker 1: if you could have your iTunes library on this NAS and all the Macs in your house could you?

302
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,479
Speaker 1: Know store all their iTunes libraries in one place and share them all and that way even the DRM.

303
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:49,760
Speaker 1: They know you weren't copying anything that it was just Macs in your house that we're accessing it.

304
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could do some sort of DRM to make that work and then that wouldn't be that bad.

305
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:02,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I mean that would be kind of good then we people wouldn't have to deal so much They'd be less problems with the you know, migrating to the new Mac with your old library and all that bullshit.

306
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:04,286
Speaker 1: But no, they didn't do that.

307
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:04,768
Speaker 1: No.

308
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:05,571
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

309
00:19:05,752 --> 00:19:05,912
Speaker 1: No.

310
00:19:05,952 --> 00:19:07,960
Speaker 1: Well, see ya not buying any of these bro.

311
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,141
Speaker 1: Oh.

312
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:12,776
Speaker 1: and the Apple TV got a software upgrade and so did the iPod touch and iPhone.

313
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:15,999
Speaker 0: but but the Apple TV Cost way too much money for what you get.

314
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:33,579
Speaker 1: The only thing is I do think that next year when my phone's contract runs out in January The iPhone is getting quite some consideration and even though here's the thing Like the other Apple products where it's capable of everything under the Sun yet It only does a handful of things really well and doesn't do those other things at all.

315
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,789
Speaker 1: That's that's you know, sort of annoying.

316
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:38,480
Speaker 1: but in reality when I think about it, right?

317
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,060
Speaker 1: What would I really do with a phone that's better than the phone?

318
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,303
Speaker 1: I had right because so far every phone I've had has had more and more features and even my latest phone Right.

319
00:19:46,383 --> 00:19:54,618
Speaker 1: I turned it on and when it was brand new I played with all the features and after a couple weeks All I did was make calls and occasionally text messages and even rarer than that took pictures.

320
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,059
Speaker 1: and that was it.

321
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,932
Speaker 1: I stopped using all those features that were so fancy and cool.

322
00:19:58,354 --> 00:19:58,896
Speaker 0: See ya.

323
00:19:58,956 --> 00:20:03,940
Speaker 0: I could have told you that Yeah, I use my phone to make calls and to occasionally make text message.

324
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,924
Speaker 1: Well didn't cost me anything.

325
00:20:04,944 --> 00:20:08,580
Speaker 1: So it doesn't matter to me, you know, but if I had the iPhone, right?

326
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,009
Speaker 1: It would replace my iPod.

327
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:14,419
Speaker 1: So that would be at least one less thing I have to carry - it works with all the Google shit.

328
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:21,591
Speaker 0: So I would check my email on it and all that other such and also that the new the Google Maps Integration is pretty damn slick.

329
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:23,359
Speaker 0: I must say it's pretty good.

330
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,860
Speaker 1: And I would also, you know, I'd use it for phone and text message and whatnot.

331
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Speaker 1: I'd probably use it for my alarm clock also.

332
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:36,760
Speaker 1: I think you can do that even though I heard the speaker is very quiet on it Which I guess would have to be fixed and the web browser on it is actually useful.

333
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:46,239
Speaker 1: So when we're sitting in the diner and someone says blah I could be like Wikipedia blah blah blah instead of going I'll remember to see that when I get home and then when I get home, of course, no one remembers.

334
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:53,580
Speaker 1: and The thing is if you look the Nokia like n-series like the n95 is capable of so much more than the iPhone.

335
00:20:53,660 --> 00:21:00,190
Speaker 1: It can do all those things and more but people who have it don't really Statistically at least aren't using it for those things.

336
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:08,274
Speaker 1: if you look at like website traffic logs People, you know mobile phones that have web browsers most of them nowadays, right?

337
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:10,040
Speaker 1: Most mobile phones have web browsers.

338
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:16,230
Speaker 1: But if you look at the mobile, you know Percentage of different mobile web browsers that are visiting websites.

339
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:26,106
Speaker 1: about half of all mobile visitors are using iPhones Which means that all those other people with web browsers on their phones just aren't using the web browsers Even though they have them.

340
00:21:26,126 --> 00:21:27,554
Speaker 0: because my phone has a web browser.

341
00:21:27,614 --> 00:21:28,640
Speaker 0: I sure as hell don't use it.

342
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,091
Speaker 1: Well, you could install the opera browser on that on a blackberry.

343
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:32,436
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about my blackberry.

344
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:34,365
Speaker 1: Oh, okay Yeah, I don't use that one.

345
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:35,750
Speaker 0: My razor has a web browser.

346
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,654
Speaker 0: I don't suck the web.

347
00:21:36,815 --> 00:21:38,140
Speaker 1: Don't fucking use that piece of shit.

348
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:47,600
Speaker 0: Yeah The only reason I'm not gonna buy one is there's a good chance my company's just gonna get me and I guess I have a Pretty old blackberry right now, and I'm pretty sure they're just gonna get me a nice blackberry.

349
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:53,919
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean a blackberry as sad as it is is sort of my second choice because It can do all the Google stuff just as well.

350
00:21:54,342 --> 00:22:03,079
Speaker 1: And the only thing that iPhone has over the blackberry is That I would have to be able to get rid of my iPod and carry one less thing Which is sadly worth a lot to me.

351
00:22:03,682 --> 00:22:12,357
Speaker 1: But the blackberry does everything else just fine better than anything else I've seen yet and the Android phone is the only thing that has a chance of unseating that the thing is.

352
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:21,460
Speaker 0: the only time I ever ever need to use any sort of smartphone feature is If I want to look at a map or look up a restaurant while I'm on the go.

353
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,215
Speaker 0: That's really the only time I would ever use it.

354
00:22:23,437 --> 00:22:23,598
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

355
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:26,600
Speaker 0: So it doesn't feel like it's worth the money or the time or the effort yet.

356
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:27,867
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would actually see.

357
00:22:27,907 --> 00:22:28,833
Speaker 1: thing is I made a lot.

358
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:47,257
Speaker 1: if I really think about it It's like having a piece of hardware that could do more than it does is annoying because I'm a nerd but in reality I would only use a B C D and E and even though the iPhone is hardware capable of XYZ It does all the ABC D and E's that I want to do and it does them.

359
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:50,452
Speaker 1: Well, yep So it even though I'd be pissed.

360
00:22:50,573 --> 00:22:54,473
Speaker 1: I think it might work out for me And we'll see next year though because everything could change next year.

361
00:22:54,513 --> 00:22:57,611
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll get an iPhone Gen 2 Maybe I'll get an Android phone.

362
00:22:57,631 --> 00:22:59,000
Speaker 0: Who knows I'm just gonna keep holding out.

363
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,923
Speaker 0: I could see my I'd be.

364
00:23:00,164 --> 00:23:06,926
Speaker 0: it's more likely that I would instead of getting a smartphone or something just pay for Internet access via my laptop.

365
00:23:07,508 --> 00:23:08,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not a bad deal either.

366
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:11,100
Speaker 1: The prices are going down and I think it's 60 a month now.

367
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially if I swing some sort of telecommuting periodically if I could just work from anywhere.

368
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:28,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is I've used those before cuz I had one, you know my job I quit and In my laptop, it would like even with the Verizon which is the best coverage here on the train It would cut in and out along the way.

369
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:30,380
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's gonna do that for sure.

370
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,390
Speaker 0: I'm thinking more in terms of all right, say I'm telecommuting or something.

371
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:36,220
Speaker 0: I can go to the beach and just have my laptop.

372
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,145
Speaker 1: Yep, that that's a good.

373
00:23:37,406 --> 00:23:40,080
Speaker 1: that's definitely a much better use of it than on the train on the way to work.

374
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:42,620
Speaker 0: No train on the way to work is not my primary.

375
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,518
Speaker 1: See what I'm really hoping for for train on the way to work is the Google gears.

376
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:48,900
Speaker 1: Yes They're working on more offline stuff.

377
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,740
Speaker 1: So right now the Google Reader sort of works offline, but not everything in my reader is like a full article.

378
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,445
Speaker 1: There's a lot of links.

379
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:56,230
Speaker 1: I want to click on.

380
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,760
Speaker 1: so but the Google gears?

381
00:23:57,861 --> 00:23:59,737
Speaker 1: I think in the long run I'll be able to have my.

382
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:11,856
Speaker 1: you know I'll be able to sync my laptop sort of before I leave for work then go and All my stuff is on there and I could work on my laptop offline With all my Google apps and then get to work and sync it up to Google again.

383
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:12,579
Speaker 1: That'd be good times.

384
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,636
Speaker 0: Firefox Mozilla is also working on more offline stuff Yeah, and I've been playing around with Twiggy a lot and there's even an offline Twiggy.

385
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:21,660
Speaker 1: Oh, it's pretty good.

386
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,208
Speaker 1: Yeah, I definitely think offline is gonna.

387
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:26,194
Speaker 1: offline work is gonna.

388
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,484
Speaker 1: you're gonna see major developments with that in the next 12 to 18 months.

389
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:37,939
Speaker 0: Well, at least I mean it really is just a stopgap until there is ubiquitous all the time always on internet everywhere Which is going to happen someday, but not in the neck.

390
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:46,039
Speaker 1: I definitely think that it's that the offline stuff is definitely a feature for the u.s Where there's not going to be ubiquitous internet for a very long time.

391
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, people in other countries are more cell phone action.

392
00:24:49,537 --> 00:24:50,200
Speaker 1: don't care about that.

393
00:24:50,220 --> 00:25:01,138
Speaker 0: I mean look we live in New York City and yet Ten minutes outside of once they get out of the tunnel on the train I lose my service like four times just because I go past buildings or around mountains or whatever.

394
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:10,238
Speaker 0: Yep so things of the day.

395
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:10,319
Speaker 0: now.

396
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:17,566
Speaker 0: the one thing about Apple Mac worlds is that there's always the keynote that people make this crazy deal about.

397
00:25:17,606 --> 00:25:22,670
Speaker 0: like a man Jobs is gonna say his thing and it's gonna be crazy and awesome and he's gonna say a million things.

398
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,038
Speaker 1: I think people don't.

399
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:31,590
Speaker 1: actually I mean some people Apple fanboys are excited about the keynote itself But really it's just the revealing of new things.

400
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:34,190
Speaker 1: You know if they could just if Apple just put up a web page.

401
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,933
Speaker 1: It's like these are the new things and these are the specs that would be just as you know because

402
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:53,230
Speaker 0: there are people and I direct evidence of this who actually thought of Mac world if they couldn't look at it at work or they as a spoiler and They avoided finding out what was announced until they got home so they could sit and watch the keynote.

403
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,821
Speaker 1: Well, I think part of it is also the slow reveal.

404
00:25:56,082 --> 00:26:05,190
Speaker 1: You know, it's like they like things to be revealed like But I think sort of like opening a gift, you know If you went and it just opened your eyes and all the gifts are there unwrapped.

405
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:06,274
Speaker 1: It's not as good.

406
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,990
Speaker 0: plus Scott people do talk a lot about a. Steve Jobs gives these amazing keynotes.

407
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,117
Speaker 0: He's such an amazing speaker.

408
00:26:12,158 --> 00:26:14,010
Speaker 0: A lot of people talk about that after Mac world.

409
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:18,450
Speaker 0: The thing is as someone has so wonderfully shown us on YouTube.

410
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,825
Speaker 0: He basically only talked for 60 seconds and everything else.

411
00:26:23,845 --> 00:26:24,748
Speaker 0: He said was fluff.

412
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:27,121
Speaker 1: Yeah This is a pretty good thing.

413
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:28,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, check out this video.

414
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:38,481
Speaker 0: it's just the entire everything that mattered from the keynote from Mac world this year in 60 seconds and actually a Significant part of that video was fooling around.

415
00:26:38,521 --> 00:26:41,130
Speaker 0: stuff that didn't even need to be there could have been done in like 30 seconds.

416
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:44,808
Speaker 1: better better better All right.

417
00:26:46,091 --> 00:26:46,853
Speaker 1: This is from 1993 or 2003.

418
00:26:46,853 --> 00:26:47,957
Speaker 1: I think that's yeah, not 93 2003.

419
00:26:47,957 --> 00:26:48,840
Speaker 1: So it's pretty.

420
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,522
Speaker 1: why would you say?

421
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:53,272
Speaker 1: 1993?

422
00:26:53,272 --> 00:26:54,275
Speaker 1: I was being stupid.

423
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:54,816
Speaker 1: Okay.

424
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:58,567
Speaker 1: So this is actually pretty old but it's new to me.

425
00:26:58,647 --> 00:26:59,430
Speaker 1: So who gives a shit?

426
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,230
Speaker 1: What this is is a robot arm and it's like a top-of-the-line robot arm.

427
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:12,830
Speaker 1: It can pretty much move in any way that a robot arm can move and you know in all axes And it's got a little hand that can grip and move and do all this stuff, right?

428
00:27:13,612 --> 00:27:22,318
Speaker 1: So people write software to make the robot arm do things that is cool or useful and then those people go on to Write the software for robot arms and factories.

429
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:25,349
Speaker 1: They do useful things like make cars or chips and whatnot.

430
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:30,089
Speaker 1: But in college you make the robot arm do funny things and that is this is why is my thing of the day?

431
00:27:30,713 --> 00:27:40,110
Speaker 1: first the first video on this page is Describing how they got the road or not describing but it's an attempt to make the robot arm make a clock.

432
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:44,090
Speaker 0: Well more like 30 attempts or so, yeah, there's a whole bunch of different ways.

433
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:45,281
Speaker 1: Like what if we do it this way?

434
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:46,170
Speaker 1: What if we do it that way?

435
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:57,545
Speaker 1: the one way I really like is what they make a digital clock with numbers and the the arm moves the red sticks around to draw the numbers and then it counts to 60 and then it moves the hands around to Change the minute again.

436
00:27:57,586 --> 00:28:02,890
Speaker 0: granted I was a fan most of all of the cop-out of just have it hold a stick that goes in a circle like the arm.

437
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:09,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, it holds a stick and it rotates the stick like the arm of a clock And then occasionally picks up the other stick and rotates it.

438
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:11,310
Speaker 1: that's the top video on this page.

439
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:17,270
Speaker 1: Then there's a whole bunch of other like descriptions of the math and how robot arms work and cool stuff.

440
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:20,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he keeps scrolling down scrolling down scrolling down.

441
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,549
Speaker 1: There's another little video here.

442
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:55,950
Speaker 1: yes, which is a competition they had of basically these Denzel six dof robot arms, right and The competition is you have two robot arms and there's a piece of wood going from one to the other and there's a goal at either end of each piece of wood and there's three pegs right and you can program the robot arms to do whatever you want and The goal is to get your three pegs into the other guy's goal While also not letting his three pegs get into your goal, but both robot arms are activated at the same time.

443
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:58,290
Speaker 1: So it's like if you just try to score right away.

444
00:28:58,591 --> 00:29:02,450
Speaker 1: You might leave yourself open unless you find some tricky way to score while also defending.

445
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:07,087
Speaker 1: Or if you defend right away, then they might knock your pegs over which you're done.

446
00:29:07,127 --> 00:29:07,810
Speaker 1: if that happens.

447
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,030
Speaker 1: Oh, you know and it's it's a pretty clever problem thing.

448
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,391
Speaker 1: It's it's.

449
00:29:11,532 --> 00:29:20,968
Speaker 1: it's a competition of both the humans programming the robot to solve this problem and also you know how well you can program the robot to move quickly and efficiently and precisely.

450
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:24,961
Speaker 1: and Some of the things people come up with his strategies are pretty.

451
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:28,695
Speaker 0: the guys who roll the pegs down instead of throwing them They get mad prom.

452
00:29:28,715 --> 00:29:31,250
Speaker 1: the guys who roll the pegs are indeed my favorite guys.

453
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,555
Speaker 1: They are the most intelligent.

454
00:29:32,696 --> 00:29:39,870
Speaker 1: but this I also like the guys who defend by moving back and forth very quickly Except it seemed like the slow-moving defense actually worked better.

455
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:40,472
Speaker 1: It does.

456
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:45,290
Speaker 1: it's hard to tell one guy defended by holding the peg, you know, I've been moving the peg back and forth.

457
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,478
Speaker 1: I thought that was pretty clever too.

458
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know how well that worked.

459
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:53,841
Speaker 0: I don't know how well it worked either but whatever And you get to see who wins in the end.

460
00:29:53,881 --> 00:30:00,124
Speaker 1: so to Asian kids, of course Not to be racist but you know, there's this truth to that, uh-huh.

461
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:00,666
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:07,872
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I was in this computer science competition thingy when I was in high school and it was you know It's pretty much.

463
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:10,823
Speaker 1: you go when you take a written test and then they it was bubbly in.

464
00:30:11,204 --> 00:30:15,957
Speaker 1: and then they go and they you Know I could probably get a hundred on that test now But in that day not really.

465
00:30:16,802 --> 00:30:24,378
Speaker 1: and then they go when they you know Run the test of these bubble scanners and then they say who wins and it was Asian kids Uh-huh.

466
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:24,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:25,669
Speaker 1: All right.

468
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,570
Speaker 1: so today We're gonna talk about mice and keyboards.

469
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:35,461
Speaker 1: We realized we did a special on mice But we actually have quite a bit to say about keyboards.

470
00:30:35,642 --> 00:30:40,220
Speaker 0: mostly I can boil it up pretty simply keyboards should be pretty standard.

471
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,960
Speaker 0: people who change the layout around sock and Particularly Dvorak is a dumb idea.

472
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,044
Speaker 0: That's right.

473
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:48,209
Speaker 0: That's not all I have to say.

474
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:50,077
Speaker 1: Well, I think there's more to.

475
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,245
Speaker 1: we can get to specifics here.

476
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:54,161
Speaker 1: back in the day It was the IBM XT keyboard.

477
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:55,810
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned is the keyboard.

478
00:30:55,951 --> 00:30:59,630
Speaker 0: Everything else is just a hack compared to that except for the fact that it's loud as hell.

479
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:00,334
Speaker 1: It is live.

480
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,003
Speaker 1: I do like keyboards to be quiet.

481
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:03,210
Speaker 1: Actually, it's weird.

482
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:10,790
Speaker 1: I don't mind if my keyboard is loud as hell But if other people's keyboards are loud, it really really bothers me like complains all the time about my typing.

483
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:13,730
Speaker 1: I need other people to have quiet keyboards like no noise.

484
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:17,130
Speaker 0: Well, if I'm gonna have a quiet keyboard then you certainly don't get to have a loud keyboard.

485
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:19,103
Speaker 1: No, no, that's you know, that's I don't.

486
00:31:19,123 --> 00:31:20,070
Speaker 1: so I don't have a loud one.

487
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,672
Speaker 1: It's only fair.

488
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:26,110
Speaker 1: but I don't like the IBM XT keyboard because it's loud, you know, even though I think that's the only reason you like.

489
00:31:26,172 --> 00:31:35,052
Speaker 1: You know I like it because of the the tactility of the keys which happens to be to go along with loudness by a byproduct of the Spring.

490
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:37,922
Speaker 1: loaded keys that go click click click is the noise they make.

491
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:39,607
Speaker 1: if there's a way to make that silent.

492
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,249
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind.

493
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,086
Speaker 1: But yeah, I really like keys that go click click click.

494
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:43,650
Speaker 1: with Springs.

495
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:49,090
Speaker 1: They're really hard to push and when you do push them down they go click and then they bounce back really hard.

496
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually I prefer the membranes because they give a a lot of resistance up front.

497
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:57,010
Speaker 0: But once that is overcome then the resistance drops off and it's much more pleasant to type on.

498
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:03,933
Speaker 1: Yeah, I pretty much use all membrane keyboards, but I would I would like a spring-loaded keyboard Time you used one.

499
00:32:03,953 --> 00:32:09,990
Speaker 0: They're very not comfortable to type on and there's a lot more key travel per you tire yourself out faster.

500
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,216
Speaker 0: It's a bad idea.

501
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:14,390
Speaker 1: No, actually the spring-loaded happy hacking keyboard.

502
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,029
Speaker 1: I would get it but it's too much money.

503
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:30,050
Speaker 1: But what they did is they actually they have the tension on all the springs set differently for each key depending on you know Intelligentness and such and it's much quieter and you don't have to push them as far and it's good stuff anyway.

504
00:32:31,171 --> 00:32:33,983
Speaker 1: So yeah, that was that that was the keyboard, but it was too big.

505
00:32:34,003 --> 00:32:35,007
Speaker 1: It was too loud.

506
00:32:35,047 --> 00:32:35,770
Speaker 1: It went out of style.

507
00:32:36,452 --> 00:32:46,710
Speaker 1: So since then people have gotten rid of a lot of the useless keys that were on that thing and we pretty much boiled it Down to escape the F keys those three the print screen and those other keys, you know

508
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,394
Speaker 0: Yeah the ones that no one knows what they do

509
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:56,221
Speaker 1: yeah the numpad the four arrows the six buttons above the arrows and then The keyboard with control and all right.

510
00:32:56,261 --> 00:32:58,510
Speaker 0: What's always bothered me is that more and more?

511
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:10,647
Speaker 0: I always find it difficult to get a standard keyboard that has all the keys that have always been on keyboards in the proper places without anything weird or strange or different or special or I?

512
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,699
Speaker 0: Just a lot of those things are just so useless and just get in the way that I don't want them and it's getting harder And harder to get keyboards.

513
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,710
Speaker 0: They're just a keyboard.

514
00:33:17,791 --> 00:33:22,949
Speaker 1: I mean the first thing that bothered me is you know They put the windows key in and I guess I can deal with the windows key now.

515
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:29,760
Speaker 0: but when the windows key was new it was like ah, I had no problem with the windows key because it was Pretty for what it did.

516
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:37,486
Speaker 0: It was a useful bit of functionality Yeah, but I guess well also the only complaint I ever saw from the windows key was from either fanboys who's am?

517
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:38,589
Speaker 0: Bill Gates blah?

518
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:43,130
Speaker 0: and People who were playing games like quake and they bumped the windows key.

519
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,620
Speaker 0: And my answer to that was don't bump the windows key.

520
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:49,816
Speaker 0: if you're accidentally hitting keys while you're playing an FPS That's probably why you're bad at them.

521
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:55,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hit it a couple times, but there's also the the Context menu key.

522
00:33:55,315 --> 00:33:56,641
Speaker 1: Do you ever use that key?

523
00:33:56,661 --> 00:34:01,142
Speaker 1: I bind it to do things Yeah, but I never use it for what it's supposed to be used for.

524
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:02,690
Speaker 0: I don't know why that key is there.

525
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really I. when they had they added that along with the windows key and I just don't understand it.

526
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:08,303
Speaker 0: I guess I just kind of.

527
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:12,168
Speaker 0: I look down I read forgot about that key and then I look down while Scott said that sure enough.

528
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:12,530
Speaker 0: There it is.

529
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,850
Speaker 1: There it is, and it's right in between the right control in the right alt.

530
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,839
Speaker 0: I just hit it and a context menu came up for Firefox.

531
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:19,400
Speaker 1: Yeah.

532
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:19,681
Speaker 1: Wow.

533
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:21,527
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hit the arrows.

534
00:34:21,567 --> 00:34:22,650
Speaker 0: No, I'm in the context menu.

535
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:25,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's actually kind of useful.

536
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:26,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in a bad place though.

537
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:28,330
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, but I'd replace.

538
00:34:28,471 --> 00:34:29,876
Speaker 0: I put it where caps lock is.

539
00:34:29,916 --> 00:34:32,324
Speaker 1: I think well, I wouldn't put it where caps lock.

540
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:33,469
Speaker 0: Why don't use caps lock?

541
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,574
Speaker 1: I don't use caps like either.

542
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:37,650
Speaker 1: but you know what I put where caps like is control control because you know what?

543
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,980
Speaker 1: People don't use enough keyboard shortcuts.

544
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,570
Speaker 1: keyboard shortcuts are the way to go.

545
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,929
Speaker 1: I mean if you want to use your computer, you know, people always want faster computers, right?

546
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:52,039
Speaker 1: Oh, it takes too long to do things, you know It takes a long time Moving them using the mouse for absolutely everything them.

547
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,587
Speaker 1: how long it takes to move the mouse click move the mouse.

548
00:34:54,627 --> 00:34:57,379
Speaker 0: granted that problem Can be solved and we've talked about this before.

549
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,855
Speaker 0: you should probably be using a really really high Sensitivity on your mouse.

550
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:01,478
Speaker 0: that too.

551
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,909
Speaker 1: but think even if you have that high sensitivity mouse, right?

552
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,060
Speaker 1: Even especially copy paste copy paste is the greatest example.

553
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:07,662
Speaker 1: What's faster?

554
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:11,569
Speaker 1: control C control V You know why you can mouse keyboard?

555
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:14,984
Speaker 0: Faster is highlight and then middle click.

556
00:35:15,185 --> 00:35:22,963
Speaker 1: That's true, but My point is is that you know Firefox open a new tab control T. That's the way to do it.

557
00:35:23,003 --> 00:35:23,907
Speaker 1: It's the fastest way.

558
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:24,850
Speaker 1: There's no faster way.

559
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:28,267
Speaker 1: I mean if you're opening a new a link in a tab, you can middle click on it.

560
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:28,790
Speaker 1: That's fine.

561
00:35:29,192 --> 00:35:34,436
Speaker 1: But the point is is that there are shortcuts to doing things faster And that is where you're gonna do.

562
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:43,170
Speaker 1: the only way to really do things faster to save the most time is To decrease the amount of time you spend interacting with the user interface and keyboard shortcuts are a part of that.

563
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,157
Speaker 1: There's also mouse shortcuts, but there are.

564
00:35:45,197 --> 00:35:48,650
Speaker 1: keyboard shortcuts are very important and I mean mouse shortcuts.

565
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,209
Speaker 0: They have gestures and hot corners and things you can do.

566
00:35:51,491 --> 00:36:00,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, but with keyboard shortcuts control is a button you're gonna be hitting a lot and Over caps lock is a completely useless button that has no purpose in the modern world.

567
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:03,195
Speaker 0: caps lock has Some minor purposes.

568
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:06,044
Speaker 1: if you're writing in basic or something caps lock is really useful.

569
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:19,625
Speaker 0: if you're interacting with old software Yeah, or if you're doing like medical data entry or any sort of lights true factory kind of data entry stuff Yep, but see if I I guess if it's old software that requires all caps then caps like has a use.

570
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:26,829
Speaker 1: but modern software That wants all caps can just check to see if you input it a lowercase and all automatically uppercase it.

571
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,758
Speaker 1: So, but anyway caps like is not that useful.

572
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:31,606
Speaker 1: You're not gonna hit it that often unless you're dumbass.

573
00:36:32,228 --> 00:36:38,990
Speaker 1: So Why should caps lock be in such a place that is easy to hit with your pinky finger all the time?

574
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:50,898
Speaker 0: this is why I like the idea of the optimist keyboard because I'm of the mind that in general the Layout of physically where all the keys are should never change Because muscle memory and that sort of thing is very important.

575
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:55,156
Speaker 0: and if you start to feel like I've used keyboard like they're all the worst Thing is at work, right?

576
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:59,490
Speaker 0: We have this Bloomberg terminal, which is like Oh, that's the thing that lets you trade just by pushing buttons.

577
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:04,091
Speaker 0: It's a special computer where I can look at about those things like stock prices and stuff Like.

578
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:08,072
Speaker 0: I can log and log into this thing and I can look up like security and from it All.

579
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:09,180
Speaker 1: those are real expensive those.

580
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:09,422
Speaker 1: Yes.

581
00:37:09,442 --> 00:37:11,666
Speaker 1: You have to pay a fee monthly I think but I can all.

582
00:37:11,726 --> 00:37:12,010
Speaker 0: it's funny.

583
00:37:12,091 --> 00:37:18,544
Speaker 0: I can scan my fingerprint on it and it logs me in and I can hit a button and then I will be in a video chat with someone at Bloomberg.

584
00:37:18,925 --> 00:37:23,616
Speaker 0: Yep immediately to get help Yep, but the keyboard physically is a little bit off.

585
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:32,581
Speaker 0: So the caps lock key is slightly bigger than it should be and By default no matter what unless I'm really careful.

586
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,267
Speaker 0: I'll hit caps lock every time.

587
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:37,822
Speaker 0: I mean to hit a Every single time.

588
00:37:38,245 --> 00:37:40,343
Speaker 1: it's so bad It's awful.

589
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:56,150
Speaker 1: it's awful Yeah, and pretty much every computer I use I turn caps lock into control because control is very important for many sheet keyboard shortcuts especially in Firefox, which is the program I use most and Caps lock is much easier to hit than control controls all the way in the corner.

590
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,310
Speaker 1: I had to move my pinky real far to hit it and it makes it hard to you know.

591
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:06,650
Speaker 1: Also hit other letters, but if I use caps lock as control suddenly keyboard shortcuts are actually shortcuts and it's comfortable and it's good times

592
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:16,730
Speaker 0: Now in terms of muscle memory, I mean in the optimus, I think that in general people Changing the meta keys in different configurations is probably you could do that to be a more efficient typist or whatever.

593
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:24,250
Speaker 0: But I'm of the mind that changing the locations of primary use keys, you know letters and numbers is a bad idea.

594
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,863
Speaker 0: That is why Dvorak is a bad idea.

595
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,250
Speaker 1: Dvorak is a bad idea.

596
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:34,570
Speaker 1: I mean Dvorak if you don't know is basically the idea of Dvorak is this look at the way you're at.

597
00:38:34,831 --> 00:38:41,357
Speaker 1: The letters on the keyboard are laid out right Q W E R T Y is what you see in the top left And that's why it's called QWERTY.

598
00:38:41,538 --> 00:38:47,650
Speaker 1: QWERTY you yup, right now On a Dvorak, as difficult, right on a Dvorak keyboard?

599
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,396
Speaker 1: Yes on a Dvorak keyboard.

600
00:38:50,436 --> 00:38:55,210
Speaker 1: The idea is that the letters you hit the most should be under your fingers.

601
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:09,930
Speaker 1: So like the left hand is like your four fingers are on like A O E U the vowels and like your right hand I think is like R S T L N something like that I'm not sure exactly but it's all the very frequently hit letters are right under your fingers.

602
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:22,411
Speaker 1: So the logically you if you're typing normal text you're moving your fingers less and you're Alternating more because like the vowels are on the left and the consonants on the right and you generally kind of alternate them a little Bit.

603
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:26,342
Speaker 1: so it's pretty well thought out from that logical standpoint.

604
00:39:26,363 --> 00:39:28,850
Speaker 1: The problem is the reality does not match the logic.

605
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:38,757
Speaker 0: well, the thing is a lot of people who use Dvorak layouts have a very fundamental misunderstanding of what Dvorak is and what problem it is Theoretically going to solve.

606
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:45,590
Speaker 0: because the argument I always hear is that yeah QWERTY was designed back in the days of typewriters and typewriters jammed if you type too quickly.

607
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:50,730
Speaker 0: So QWERTY was designed to slow you down so that you couldn't cause a problem.

608
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:51,549
Speaker 1: That's not true.

609
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:59,828
Speaker 0: In fact QWERTY is one of the if you look at statistically like the a bit not in terms of human use But in terms of positioning of letters.

610
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:09,018
Speaker 0: Statistically as opposed to a random layout QWERTY is in the very very top percentile of Very efficient layouts already.

611
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,810
Speaker 0: Yes, it's designed, you know, they didn't want the keyboards to jam.

612
00:40:13,292 --> 00:40:19,581
Speaker 0: So the best way to make them not jam is to make sure that on average you will not hit two keys that are next To each other very close to each other time wise.

613
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:25,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why people always talk about like, you know Secretaries is like or stewardesses is.

614
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:34,310
Speaker 1: stewardesses is one of the few one of the longest words You can type on one hand on a QWERTY keyboard because there aren't too many words You can type on one hand on a QWERTY keyboard.

615
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,369
Speaker 1: It's designed to make you alternate not to make you go slow.

616
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:45,924
Speaker 1: But for you to alternate that way the typewriter which has the hammers coming from both sides Won't hit two on the same side at the same time.

617
00:40:45,964 --> 00:40:46,568
Speaker 1: It'll screw up.

618
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:53,390
Speaker 0: so Alternating like that between left hand and right hand is pretty much the most efficient way human being can type as far as we've seen.

619
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,944
Speaker 1: I mean you can make a layout.

620
00:40:56,024 --> 00:40:57,130
Speaker 1: that is that you know.

621
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,366
Speaker 1: if someone learned it would be faster than QWERTY.

622
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:07,137
Speaker 1: but QWERTY is fast enough and the fact that it's already standard on so many keyboards around the world just you know Makes it so much better.

623
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:09,207
Speaker 1: It's like why should we change from something?

624
00:41:09,227 --> 00:41:17,146
Speaker 1: That's 90% good to something 92% good which would have no significant advantage, you know Considering that everyone's gonna have to relearn it?

625
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:18,234
Speaker 0: now I have a lot of.

626
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:26,110
Speaker 0: I don't want to make this the QWERTY Dvorak show But yeah, I I just it is my opinion that the vast majority of people use Dvorak do it for pretentious.

627
00:41:26,792 --> 00:41:27,695
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm better than you.

628
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:35,438
Speaker 1: I'm different than your reasons and don't actually understand and they always come up with claims like oh I'm so much more comfortable doing it this way Oh, I'm so much faster doing it this way.

629
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:39,917
Speaker 0: There has never been a study that showed any Usefulness of Dvorak over QWERTY.

630
00:41:39,937 --> 00:41:51,658
Speaker 1: Yes, and while you know individual anecdotes may say so every study of you know typing speed and comfort and you know, I guess What's it called the wrist problem?

631
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,534
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah carpal tunnel and all that RSI.

632
00:41:56,634 --> 00:42:00,130
Speaker 1: no, no, there's been no link between any of that and QWERTY versus Dvorak.

633
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:07,190
Speaker 1: Dvorak is not scientifically shown to be better in any way and many studies show it being just as it's not significantly better.

634
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,274
Speaker 1: It's not worth learning.

635
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:15,658
Speaker 0: It's it's kind of a dumb idea for nerds, but you know, I always found it interesting I think back to when I was a kid and like I Didn't know how to type.

636
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,918
Speaker 0: but then again typing was not Commonly done by kids like computers were.

637
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:27,641
Speaker 1: so I didn't learn that I was using computers a lot like since I was you know kindergarten and I didn't learn to type until like 10th 11th grade.

638
00:42:28,082 --> 00:42:35,409
Speaker 0: the funny thing is I remember I was I was an awful typist and They always at school tried to make us use these programs to teach you how to type and they those didn't work.

639
00:42:35,775 --> 00:42:36,409
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

640
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:45,030
Speaker 0: So I remember I learned when I learned how to type was when I got ICQ and I made friends around the world You know back when there weren't that many people online.

641
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:56,662
Speaker 0: So if you just talk to a random person odds were they were pretty cool and I I still to this day Have a few friends around the world that I met through ICQ back in the day and Typing to friends online.

642
00:42:56,682 --> 00:43:01,403
Speaker 0: I Learned how to type really really well really really quickly.

643
00:43:01,423 --> 00:43:03,009
Speaker 0: The only way to learn how to type is just to type.

644
00:43:03,692 --> 00:43:05,201
Speaker 0: Mmm, don't take classes just.

645
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:11,368
Speaker 1: actually funnily enough I learned how to type from a class in my school with this old lady on these IBM XT keyboards.

646
00:43:11,449 --> 00:43:11,770
Speaker 0: Really?

647
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:12,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean part.

648
00:43:12,975 --> 00:43:13,679
Speaker 1: it was really.

649
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:18,587
Speaker 1: it's like part of it was a. you know There was a program but the program was mostly just something like test.

650
00:43:18,628 --> 00:43:19,331
Speaker 1: what I learned It was just.

651
00:43:19,371 --> 00:43:24,128
Speaker 1: it was weird cuz like taking the class at first like I was just doing it and I felt like.

652
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:30,398
Speaker 1: you know I had felt before just like in all those other classes, you know We're using a program and I wasn't learning how to type.

653
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:35,272
Speaker 1: we were using like, you know, the original Microsoft Word or whatever, you know and Like.

654
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:41,709
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like I was learning how to type but amazingly enough somehow I came out of it typing and I was like Holy shit, it was amazing.

655
00:43:42,691 --> 00:43:50,348
Speaker 0: but I feel like it's not really a newest thing to say but definitely Being able to type is pretty much a fundamental skill of the world.

656
00:43:50,429 --> 00:44:01,529
Speaker 0: now Yeah You'll be like if I see someone under the age of 40 you cannot type very quickly and they don't have an injury or a reason Physically that they cannot type they're gonna have problems.

657
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:17,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean typing is like if I see someone like not typing properly or quick speedily or in a good way That's like you can't read Really say properly because there are a lot of people type in a lot of really weird ways like you.

658
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:18,715
Speaker 0: All right.

659
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,150
Speaker 0: The thing is the only weird thing is I don't use the home row.

660
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,375
Speaker 0: I type, you know, QWERTY standard nothing special But I type kind of.

661
00:44:24,436 --> 00:44:27,850
Speaker 0: I float my hands around the keyboard back and forth and there's no place.

662
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:32,027
Speaker 0: There's no like default place for my hands are but I can dive really really freaking quick.

663
00:44:32,107 --> 00:44:32,750
Speaker 0: So I think it works.

664
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I type, you know, I use the home row action.

665
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,890
Speaker 1: But you know, it's sort of like DDR in a way where I don't always move the finger back to the home row.

666
00:44:41,132 --> 00:44:42,930
Speaker 1: You know, sometimes I'll leave them hanging out there.

667
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:48,430
Speaker 1: But you know my hand position generally stays in such a way where if I do reset I'm on the home row.

668
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,603
Speaker 0: You know Scott always yells at me that I type loud.

669
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:52,212
Speaker 1: you do type loud I don't know.

670
00:44:52,252 --> 00:44:52,514
Speaker 0: I hit.

671
00:44:52,594 --> 00:44:55,370
Speaker 0: maybe I play the piano or something, but I always hit the keyboard really hard.

672
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:58,564
Speaker 0: I think I need a more beefy keyboard to stand up to me.

673
00:44:58,584 --> 00:44:59,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I try to hit the keys.

674
00:45:00,413 --> 00:45:03,089
Speaker 1: Oh just like just hard enough like I tap like tap tap tap.

675
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:10,617
Speaker 1: I try to just you know Make them register just once because I have it set where if you hold it down a little bit too much if you hit it Too hard, you'll type like two or three letters.

676
00:45:11,019 --> 00:45:23,730
Speaker 0: the weird thing though is I got this Logitech keyboard And I got it because way back when I needed a new keyboard suddenly at RIT This was the only keyboard in the entire store that had the proper layout of keys didn't have anything weird on it.

677
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:33,025
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you look at keyboards today and I mean laptop is an exception because a laptop you have to rearrange the keys And use an FN key in order to fit all those things on to a small space.

678
00:45:33,045 --> 00:45:34,050
Speaker 1: That's acceptable, right?

679
00:45:34,752 --> 00:45:39,228
Speaker 1: The problem is a lot of normal keyboards have no reason at all to be.

680
00:45:39,248 --> 00:45:39,850
Speaker 1: you know.

681
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:43,630
Speaker 1: Change the layout like they move all the keys around nowadays like they'll make.

682
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:48,150
Speaker 0: They'll make the enter key double big and they'll put backspace over by tab or something.

683
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:49,680
Speaker 1: Why why do you do that?

684
00:45:50,063 --> 00:45:51,130
Speaker 1: or like they'll make that you know?

685
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,023
Speaker 1: I guess older keyboards use the l-shaped enter key and the top.

686
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:55,645
Speaker 1: that shouldn't be.

687
00:45:55,665 --> 00:45:57,250
Speaker 1: you need the backspace in the pipe there.

688
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:00,606
Speaker 1: That's what belongs there the backspace in the pipe not the l-shaped enter key.

689
00:46:00,626 --> 00:46:01,550
Speaker 1: screw that now.

690
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:06,558
Speaker 0: the worst thing is a lot of people get rid of the numb pet now that I could see get ridding getting rid of the numpad.

691
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:11,950
Speaker 0: if You're you like a special purpose-built keyboard like on a laptop or whatever.

692
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:15,629
Speaker 0: But the numpad is the most efficient way to enter numbers.

693
00:46:15,991 --> 00:46:21,815
Speaker 0: The numpad is the most efficient way if you're entering numbers because I learned 10 key my first job I ever had working for the census.

694
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:33,790
Speaker 0: part of what I did was 10 key data entry for like HR and in payroll and If you learn 10 key you can put data into a computer really freaking quick and you can type numbers like you wouldn't believe.

695
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:38,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, see I actually the keyboard I use is the happy hacking keyboard, right and I use it for many reasons.

696
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,293
Speaker 1: First of all, it's USB, right and it's got a USB hub in it so you can have.

697
00:46:42,313 --> 00:46:46,654
Speaker 1: it has two USB holes on it, which is really cool and It doesn't have a numpad.

698
00:46:46,714 --> 00:46:47,718
Speaker 1: and it's nice and small.

699
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,310
Speaker 1: and the advantages of it are it's small the keys are high quality Caps lock is control.

700
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:59,795
Speaker 1: So even if the operating system doesn't let you turn caps lock into control caps lock is control So it doesn't fucking matter.

701
00:46:59,815 --> 00:47:16,130
Speaker 1: All right, all the keys, you know, it doesn't have a numpad but everything else is laid out really just perfectly and Escape is much closer to your fingers than it is on a normal keyboard Which is very important for me because I use VI a lot and in VI you have to hit escape very very often.

702
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,759
Speaker 0: Escape colon WQ bang.

703
00:47:17,779 --> 00:47:28,586
Speaker 1: Alright, so because I hit the escape key So goddamn often I pretty much have to use the happy hacking keyboard if I'm coding or else I get very uncomfortable Hitting the escape key so far away from my finger.

704
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:29,504
Speaker 1: Oh my god It's great.

705
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:38,310
Speaker 0: The weird thing is I got this keyboard because it was the simplest one I could get at that store And I know there are good keyboards out there, but I was a poor college kid and you know was years ago.

706
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:41,149
Speaker 0: So I had to go to like a Best Buy and just buy whatever keyboard was there.

707
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,492
Speaker 1: Whatever.

708
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:47,367
Speaker 0: along the top of this thing, there's all these like media control buttons.

709
00:47:47,427 --> 00:47:50,919
Speaker 0: There's a. There's all these weird buttons that to this day.

710
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,870
Speaker 0: I've never seen anyone who actually use these buttons for anything useful.

711
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:55,997
Speaker 0: I mean, I've got an email button.

712
00:47:56,098 --> 00:47:56,439
Speaker 0: great.

713
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,028
Speaker 0: I need an email button on my keyboard.

714
00:47:59,168 --> 00:47:59,630
Speaker 0: for what?

715
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:11,449
Speaker 0: Yeah to open your email program and I've got a messenger slash SMS button to open up your a webcam button and I touch button a search button a shopping button.

716
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah shopping.

717
00:48:14,357 --> 00:48:15,302
Speaker 1: That's a useful button.

718
00:48:15,322 --> 00:48:15,985
Speaker 1: What's a push?

719
00:48:16,046 --> 00:48:16,830
Speaker 1: It goes to Amazon?

720
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,133
Speaker 0: Push it just.

721
00:48:18,456 --> 00:48:20,270
Speaker 0: it just charges something random to my credit card.

722
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:25,811
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean like a lot of the modern keyboards that you will buy at the store have all these crazy buttons on them and some Of them.

723
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:36,343
Speaker 0: I like the volume buttons the volume control on the keyboard I like and the other thing I like but I use it for a weird purpose is I have the like win and control suite on the top of here.

724
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:38,090
Speaker 0: It's you know, like track left right play pause.

725
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:43,350
Speaker 0: I like those two, but I never use those for that because I never need to do that on the keyboard.

726
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:43,811
Speaker 0: I never.

727
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:53,778
Speaker 0: it's never something I need to do, but I always bind those sorts of things to move windows between desktops Mmm, I'd use keyboard shortcuts for that.

728
00:48:53,818 --> 00:48:59,565
Speaker 1: So yeah, but anyway, yeah though a lot of those keys They stick them on there and it's just.

729
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:00,853
Speaker 1: I don't like it It's not.

730
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:02,560
Speaker 1: most of them are not useful.

731
00:49:02,701 --> 00:49:06,943
Speaker 1: and like I have an external numpad, you know so I can do ten key data entry when I need to.

732
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:17,938
Speaker 1: it's a USB numpad and It has some media buttons on it, you know, so when it's plugged in I might use them you know to volume control mute play pause whatever but It's I mostly use it for just.

733
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:19,164
Speaker 1: it's also a calculator by the way.

734
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:19,586
Speaker 1: It's pretty cool.

735
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,917
Speaker 1: I do Yeah, it's good stuff.

736
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:34,550
Speaker 1: So I like that that combination but I The worst thing that bothers me about a lot of the keyboards besides adding the stupid extra keys that are useless is how they put The delete key, I guess people hate control delete so often that they got rid of the insert.

737
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the delete key sort of eats it.

738
00:49:36,419 --> 00:49:37,485
Speaker 0: I use the insert key.

739
00:49:37,505 --> 00:49:38,570
Speaker 0: The injured key does stuff.

740
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:44,910
Speaker 1: It does do stuff and it I use it quite often like to do like, you know shift page insert to do like.

741
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:46,737
Speaker 1: You know pastes and vim and stuff like that.

742
00:49:46,978 --> 00:49:50,792
Speaker 0: or also if I want to turn on overwrite if I'm editing some sort of configuration File.

743
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:51,555
Speaker 1: Yeah.

744
00:49:51,736 --> 00:49:51,917
Speaker 1: Yeah.

745
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:55,130
Speaker 1: Well, I guess in vim you don't use insert to do that, but nobody like word.

746
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:56,080
Speaker 0: I do that and word.

747
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,093
Speaker 1: you do that sure and Fucking.

748
00:49:58,113 --> 00:49:58,999
Speaker 1: they like they must.

749
00:49:59,019 --> 00:50:00,690
Speaker 1: I think they put it somewhere else on the keyboard.

750
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:05,629
Speaker 1: But they make the delete key so much bigger and they make it eat up the insert key and they move the insert key.

751
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:06,713
Speaker 1: It's not good.

752
00:50:06,834 --> 00:50:07,416
Speaker 1: Don't do that.

753
00:50:07,536 --> 00:50:08,219
Speaker 1: Why are you doing that?

754
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,022
Speaker 1: You're changing something.

755
00:50:09,042 --> 00:50:09,665
