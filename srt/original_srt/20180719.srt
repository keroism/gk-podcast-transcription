1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,975
Speaker 0: It's Thursday July 19th 2018.

2
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:14,485
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,505 --> 00:00:21,210
Speaker 0: tonight in the geek nights book club We're talking about Emily Wilson's translation of Homer's the Odyssey.

4
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:25,902
Speaker 1: Not uh, this is the Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,150
Speaker 0: So yeah, no news cuz it's the geek nights book club.

6
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:37,049
Speaker 0: I guess what I should point out is that if you're new to geek nights We have a book club and we've been doing this for a long time.

7
00:00:37,552 --> 00:00:43,198
Speaker 1: So even though it takes a long-ass time for us to read a book If it doesn't you take a long time to read the book.

8
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,909
Speaker 1: It just we don't spend enough time reading.

9
00:00:46,373 --> 00:00:48,089
Speaker 0: Yep, partly cuz we had a lot going on.

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,907
Speaker 1: We probably only took me like maybe less than 10 hours to read this book in total.

11
00:00:53,128 --> 00:01:02,781
Speaker 1: Yep But it just those 10 hours just spread out over many many months at least Three at least six maybe.

12
00:01:03,283 --> 00:01:05,150
Speaker 0: but anyway the deal we're gonna get right into it.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,698
Speaker 0: We're gonna have things today, but we're gonna get right into this book club.

14
00:01:08,139 --> 00:01:09,584
Speaker 0: Is that we're not?

15
00:01:09,624 --> 00:01:17,630
Speaker 0: we're assuming you read the book Meaning we're not going to explain the plot to you and we're gonna casually spoil everything.

16
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:20,803
Speaker 1: Granted I feel like I don't feel like you can spoil the Odyssey.

17
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:21,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, guess what?

18
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:22,209
Speaker 0: He makes it home.

19
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:31,428
Speaker 1: I mean if you don't know the story of the Odyssey, even if you never read the Odyssey I feel like I knew the story of it the general story Before even reading the pop-up book.

20
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:42,330
Speaker 1: Yeah Partly because the word I learned I learned the story of the Odyssey from other things That I watched in my child or read my childhood and then I didn't read the Odyssey.

21
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:46,933
Speaker 1: There was a multi-part DuckTales Episode I had in VHS.

22
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,241
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the Odyssey.

23
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,124
Speaker 1: There was.

24
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:51,669
Speaker 1: what else was the Odyssey?

25
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:52,814
Speaker 1: That's the one I remember the most.

26
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,784
Speaker 1: but there was I think I read.

27
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:59,765
Speaker 1: you know, there's like a children's Video one of those like story books that you see at the library.

28
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:00,710
Speaker 1: that hardly moves.

29
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:04,324
Speaker 0: You've got that awesome pop-up book that you got a mocha a long time ago the Odyssey.

30
00:02:04,344 --> 00:02:05,730
Speaker 0: Well, that's you know.

31
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:06,749
Speaker 0: I mean that was more recent.

32
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:14,618
Speaker 0: I didn't actually read the Odyssey like for real until ninth grade because in my high school Ninth grade was the year you did Greek literature.

33
00:02:14,638 --> 00:02:20,320
Speaker 0: So you did the Odyssey and all that like all the tragedies and all that stuff.

34
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:29,039
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and We didn't actually read all of the Odyssey and I wasn't really realized that till I read the Odyssey again later There was only mythology in our school.

35
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,798
Speaker 1: if you elected mythology in high school And I think then they made you read a whole bunch of mythology.

36
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,302
Speaker 1: I did not elect that.

37
00:02:35,403 --> 00:02:39,968
Speaker 1: I elected science fiction and also hippie anti-war book.

38
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:46,650
Speaker 0: Mythology was its own thing, but the Odyssey in Greek literature was not opt-outable.

39
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,297
Speaker 0: That was core like even even the dumb side of the school like the regular basic class English It was still Greek stuff the snooty.

40
00:02:54,578 --> 00:03:03,639
Speaker 1: basically there were three literature electives for snooty smart kids and I chose none of them which is Shakespeare Mythology and Mark Twain type action.

41
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:04,843
Speaker 1: I just none of those three.

42
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:05,727
Speaker 1: I chose all the other ones.

43
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,234
Speaker 0: at RIT I just tested out of everything except the one class I couldn't test out of.

44
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,565
Speaker 0: yeah where I had to read that tear all those terrible books.

45
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:12,590
Speaker 0: tree of red stars.

46
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,812
Speaker 0: Yep, we will never do a book club book on the tree of red stars I promise.

47
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:18,281
Speaker 0: why would we guess we should warn people against it?

48
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:20,610
Speaker 0: anyway three stars run away.

49
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:27,760
Speaker 1: So the point is that you know we know the Odyssey, but this is a new translation of the Odyssey And you know I've never read any other translation of the Odyssey.

50
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,410
Speaker 1: that wasn't some simplified children's or pop-up book.

51
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:33,385
Speaker 1: I've never read and you know I've read some other.

52
00:03:33,807 --> 00:03:46,070
Speaker 0: I've read I've mostly read in high school one translation I don't know which one it was in our textbook, and I fully read a different translation I'm pretty sure was a penguin book, but I don't know anything about it.

53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,930
Speaker 1: We're not a lot of them.

54
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:54,909
Speaker 1: It's like there's like four different ones than Amazon And you don't know which one's good, but I'd never read a modern or modernized translation until this mm-hmm.

55
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:59,444
Speaker 0: But again really like we're going to assume you read the book.

56
00:03:59,484 --> 00:04:02,870
Speaker 0: you can continue to listen to this episode If you didn't read the Odyssey.

57
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:14,610
Speaker 0: But that's like when you're at a convention or at a party and you're hanging out on the outside of the circle of people talking About something and you have no idea what they're talking about and you're just standing there kind of nodding along.

58
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,286
Speaker 0: You really don't want to be that guy.

59
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:17,754
Speaker 1: Rim is that guy?

60
00:04:18,095 --> 00:04:19,882
Speaker 1: no I usually know what's going on right.

61
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:34,928
Speaker 1: the other thing is to talk about this book Right is kind of hard because I feel like the introduction and also the notes at the end Sort of say everything there is that I could possibly say and I don't have any special knowledge about.

62
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,699
Speaker 1: you know Greek history literature Homer or anything.

63
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,481
Speaker 1: so it's like.

64
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,386
Speaker 1: what can I say other than reiterate?

65
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,710
Speaker 1: What was already in there?

66
00:04:43,312 --> 00:04:46,923
Speaker 1: Right it's like there's already these people who study this for a fucking living.

67
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,749
Speaker 1: What do I have to contribute?

68
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,010
Speaker 0: well?

69
00:04:49,230 --> 00:05:00,070
Speaker 0: That's why rather than talk about the forward which if you read this book and didn't read the forward the forward What the forward is the what you're paying for the forward taught me a lot about the Odyssey?

70
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,797
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and it also reinforces something that a lot of people don't seem to realize that when people say Greek They always think like Athens and Sparta.

71
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,790
Speaker 0: that is way way late Greece.

72
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:16,623
Speaker 0: There's a lot of Greek and quote-unquote Greek history before that.

73
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:20,274
Speaker 1: yeah, Homer comes way before say Euclid.

74
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:25,887
Speaker 0: yeah, right Homer comes way before Athens and Sparta as you would know them.

75
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:28,941
Speaker 1: yeah I mean they still the you know like Sparta.

76
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,246
Speaker 1: they mentioned Sparta in the book.

77
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:30,909
Speaker 1: right it exists.

78
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:38,189
Speaker 0: yeah But the Sparta of 300 was far far away and arguably they might not even be the same thing.

79
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:43,398
Speaker 0: yep They could just have the same name because you know there was the Dorian invasion Which may or may not have been an actual.

80
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:46,176
Speaker 1: and being Homer they're talking about mice And I like.

81
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:52,110
Speaker 1: it's a present thing mice And I is like the ancient Greek civilization that was lost and we don't know enough about yep.

82
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:56,430
Speaker 1: You want to have a good honor, but that was present to Homer's writings.

83
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:58,118
Speaker 0: You want to go down a rabbit hole.

84
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:06,750
Speaker 1: go read about the Greek Dark Age cuz I realize Like what BC number are we talking about here with you know when Homer was supposedly possibly writing the Odyssey?

85
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:11,010
Speaker 0: Like we're talking like literal way if the Trojan War happened like that.

86
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:17,837
Speaker 0: So imagine raw on a super rough scale cuz I'm not I don't know that much about currency current.

87
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:25,326
Speaker 0: the Greece that you think of like Sparta Athens Marathon like and after that is Alexander like on a really broad stroke a great one.

88
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:29,507
Speaker 0: so before The Athens Sparta stuff not not not Wayne.

89
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:32,116
Speaker 0: the great one Is the Greek dark.

90
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:38,724
Speaker 0: effectively the Greek dark a like archaic Greece the Dark Age and then before that is the Homer era.

91
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:43,503
Speaker 0: But yeah, we're not gonna try to get in Greek chronology.

92
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:47,514
Speaker 1: the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC.

93
00:06:47,996 --> 00:06:50,545
Speaker 0: that's a long time before the Battle of Marathon.

94
00:06:50,846 --> 00:06:58,269
Speaker 1: That's that's like Less than half the distance between us and Jesus who didn't exist.

95
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:03,035
Speaker 1: The Battle of Marathon the one on the other side the Battle of Marathon Which is what most peep.

96
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:05,770
Speaker 0: that era is what most people think of when they think of ancient Greece.

97
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:14,792
Speaker 0: They're actually I think most people think of like classical Greece like Roman Greece But anyway, or like all those like way later eras was 490 BC Mm-hmm.

98
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:22,475
Speaker 0: so the stuff you think about it from 490 BC is not the same years so it's as old.

99
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:26,104
Speaker 1: it's basically the distance between us and the medieval times.

100
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:30,218
Speaker 1: is the distance between Homer and The Greece years they normally think.

101
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:40,658
Speaker 0: but before we get into that we do have Things of the day.

102
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:44,708
Speaker 1: you just forgot to do things of the day now And you started book clubbing.

103
00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,250
Speaker 0: no I was doing a pre moment about the book club because we haven't done one in a while.

104
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:57,671
Speaker 0: And I want to remind people that we have a book club And you should just go look at the old episodes and if a book looks good read it and then listen to our show about It.

105
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,455
Speaker 0: you should read books.

106
00:07:58,515 --> 00:07:59,861
Speaker 1: if you want to be an intelligent person.

107
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,970
Speaker 1: if you come up to me and say I am a person who?

108
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,121
Speaker 1: Does not read books that consist only of words doesn't matter.

109
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,830
Speaker 1: if they're e or paper audiobooks don't count for me at least.

110
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,703
Speaker 1: But if you're a person who does not read books my respect for you is diminished.

111
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:15,895
Speaker 1: you are below other humans on the respect Ometer compared to humans who do read.

112
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:18,723
Speaker 0: so my thing of the day is this video.

113
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:19,766
Speaker 0: SV nation is pretty good.

114
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:34,230
Speaker 0: videos about like sports History and sports faz fun stuff and this one is about Tom Dempsey if you don't know Held the record for the longest field goal in his in football history for 43 years and so people knew how to kick.

115
00:08:34,652 --> 00:08:38,130
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't just until people know how to kick stuff changed and technology change.

116
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,403
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things that changed also steroids more of a thing like.

117
00:08:42,423 --> 00:08:43,184
Speaker 0: there's lots of things.

118
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:43,988
Speaker 1: I don't think kickers.

119
00:08:44,008 --> 00:08:46,693
Speaker 0: They're on steroids Wouldn't be surprised.

120
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:47,495
Speaker 1: They don't use it.

121
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:52,347
Speaker 1: the kicker is usually the tiniest tiniest people with one big like trogdor looking leg.

122
00:08:52,367 --> 00:09:04,824
Speaker 0: yeah But Anyway the deal with Tom Dempsey was that he was so good That they made a rule to basically prevent anyone else from ever kicking like him.

123
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:16,541
Speaker 0: and the reason he kicked the way he did is Because he was literally missing half of his foot and his foot was basically a club That he used to great effect with terrifying power.

124
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:25,468
Speaker 0: and the NFL literally made a rule that Specifically prevented anyone from ever doing what he did ever again, and it's just a pretty interesting story.

125
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:26,693
Speaker 0: hmm So what do you got?

126
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:29,630
Speaker 1: so as it would have been a Monday thing of the day?

127
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,370
Speaker 1: But whatever I don't even know if this is real cuz I didn't try it for myself.

128
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,180
Speaker 1: This could be like a scam website.

129
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,527
Speaker 1: That's like fooling you into thinking.

130
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,030
Speaker 1: This is real.

131
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,710
Speaker 0: That'd be really funny if it is but yeah.

132
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,587
Speaker 1: So one thing people in the way who work in the web always talk about is links.

133
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:43,494
Speaker 1: Ella why?

134
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:44,035
Speaker 1: and X?

135
00:09:44,156 --> 00:09:48,570
Speaker 0: there's also another one Li and clearly in the context of you made a modern website.

136
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:50,580
Speaker 0: But will it work on links right?

137
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,349
Speaker 0: so look at how long my neckbeard is.

138
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,222
Speaker 1: Links is a web browser that runs in the terminal and is like only text.

139
00:09:56,322 --> 00:10:12,395
Speaker 1: so it's sort of like if you make your website Good and accessible enough and and adaptable enough someone should be able to use your website Fully from links in the terminal with text only and it's sort of like a litmus test But sort of a bullshit one.

140
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:16,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd say it was a legitimate litmus test until about 2002.

141
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,385
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had its day, but it's like no one does no one using links.

142
00:10:20,566 --> 00:10:21,289
Speaker 1: Maybe there's one guy.

143
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,747
Speaker 1: The point is it's a way to browse the web from the terminal and it works.

144
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:31,948
Speaker 1: even today it works yeah, but in some web pages it works better than others.

145
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:35,619
Speaker 1: and What someone here did is they made a thing?

146
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:36,382
Speaker 1: What's it called?

147
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,248
Speaker 0: It is called browshe browshe.

148
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:45,570
Speaker 1: For I guess it stands for browser shell or shell browser And it's basically a web browser that runs in the terminal.

149
00:10:46,031 --> 00:10:54,974
Speaker 1: But it takes advantage of all the features of modern terminals and modern computers not which are things like color Right links and links.

150
00:10:55,476 --> 00:10:57,662
Speaker 1: the you know both spellings are two different texts.

151
00:10:57,983 --> 00:10:59,647
Speaker 1: right they can run on like a VT 100 in the work.

152
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,310
Speaker 1: Right that's one of those old term like hardware terminals.

153
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,895
Speaker 1: They just got a green screen right.

154
00:11:05,376 --> 00:11:15,890
Speaker 1: but browshe can run in say gnome terminal or x-term or rx-vt Or the I term on your Mac, and you know all the modern terminal emulators that you're running on your real computer.

155
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:25,490
Speaker 1: That's made in the 2000s Like a VT hundred that has colors and sounds and you have a mouse and all these sorts of assumptions and scroll wheel.

156
00:11:26,072 --> 00:11:32,296
Speaker 1: So it basically uses all those modern features of your browser to render a web page Just like a real web page.

157
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,463
Speaker 1: the thing is the resolution is just really low.

158
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:38,256
Speaker 0: it is the resolution the pixels on anything that is Not text because it's all icons.

159
00:11:38,357 --> 00:11:39,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all icons in a pixel grid.

160
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:48,004
Speaker 0: the well in a grid Not a pixel grid the pixels and the images are each Exactly the size of a tile that would have a character in it like a letter.

161
00:11:48,024 --> 00:11:49,951
Speaker 1: yep, so but yeah It's.

162
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:54,685
Speaker 1: you can even watch video in it look at images click on links read tags.

163
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,510
Speaker 1: It's like it's a full-on web browser.

164
00:11:56,673 --> 00:11:57,121
Speaker 0: What's really?

165
00:11:57,162 --> 00:11:57,550
Speaker 0: what's really?

166
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,841
Speaker 1: Anyone who knows how to use a web browser could use this.

167
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,910
Speaker 1: it would just look really pixely.

168
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,950
Speaker 0: What's really weirding me out is just scroll like looking at these images.

169
00:12:06,371 --> 00:12:11,110
Speaker 0: They look so much like the resolution you got in old PC games like police quests.

170
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,862
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is giving me a weird nostalgia for games like police quest.

171
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:16,025
Speaker 1: it would be like if you ran.

172
00:12:16,045 --> 00:12:26,087
Speaker 1: it feels almost like you ran actual chrome But on DOS and the resolution of the screen was still 320 by whatever the fuck.

173
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:30,149
Speaker 1: it was an old DOS Yeah, but your CPU is strong enough, and it actually just kind of worked.

174
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:36,793
Speaker 1: But you didn't have any advanced GPU and your resolution was still 320 by whatever with 256 colors.

175
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:42,352
Speaker 0: got in the DOS era I had a monitor that was 12 inches and it its max resolution Was 800 by 600.

176
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:42,955
Speaker 0: I think we had a 15 each.

177
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,856
Speaker 0: No, I didn't have that.

178
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:51,870
Speaker 0: but then I had that giant 19-inch super CRT that I brought to RIT.

179
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:53,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, I brought it to RIT a 17-inch.

180
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:54,161
Speaker 1: yep that 19-inch.

181
00:12:56,372 --> 00:13:00,135
Speaker 0: That was one of the the only thing I've had to move in my life That was harder than moving.

182
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:05,906
Speaker 1: that monitor was the fucker that couch And then the people who took away that fucker just took it away.

183
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:06,449
Speaker 1: one two three whoop.

184
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:08,839
Speaker 0: I was really saddened by that.

185
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:13,744
Speaker 0: they had no problem movement, so yeah in the meta moment whatever We're gonna be at PAX West the real PAX.

186
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:14,589
Speaker 0: We're doing a panel.

187
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:20,730
Speaker 0: It's not only going to be live at PAX on Monday But it's going to be live streamed on the official PAX twitch.

188
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,950
Speaker 1: So if you don't go to PAX I don't know which one of them they think there might be two or three official.

189
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,161
Speaker 0: It will be probably packs two or packs three.

190
00:13:28,201 --> 00:13:30,590
Speaker 0: as soon as we know we will let you know.

191
00:13:30,871 --> 00:13:42,345
Speaker 1: We'll probably tweet when it's starting - yeah I will probably schedule all those tweets well in advance if I follow geek nights on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and all the different social places because we have accounts there.

192
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:47,783
Speaker 0: also if you're listening to this podcast You could actually watch us record it live on YouTube.

193
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,950
Speaker 0: There are currently five people watching.

194
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,250
Speaker 1: I mean I would already discourage you from listening to this podcast saying you could not worth your time to listen to this podcast.

195
00:13:55,471 --> 00:13:58,801
Speaker 1: It's even less worth your time to watch the podcast being recorded live.

196
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,326
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you could.

197
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:01,350
Speaker 0: I didn't say you should.

198
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:05,126
Speaker 0: And also we just did another judge anime by its cover.

199
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:09,903
Speaker 0: that video is up And it's on Scott's YouTube and a lot of you only follow my YouTube.

200
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,150
Speaker 0: You should also follow Scott's YouTube.

201
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:18,087
Speaker 1: Start some project of great evil possibly on my YouTube soon.

202
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,597
Speaker 0: Oh is this one I know about or is this a new evil.

203
00:14:20,838 --> 00:14:22,909
Speaker 1: I told it to you recently.

204
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:24,959
Speaker 0: okay I think I know what you're talking anyway a lot.

205
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,843
Speaker 0: if you do that evil.

206
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:26,405
Speaker 0: It'll be great.

207
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:30,378
Speaker 0: so We're not gonna try to analyze the Odyssey.

208
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,966
Speaker 0: I think you're gonna mention that there's nothing we can say.

209
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:40,370
Speaker 0: well anything I could say would either be me Basically poorly reiterating things I learned in high school.

210
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,630
Speaker 1: I feel like if you write a book about physics and then tried to say things about physics.

211
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,818
Speaker 1: It's like but more importantly like qualified.

212
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:47,621
Speaker 1: We're consumers.

213
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:47,962
Speaker 1: We're not.

214
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:52,479
Speaker 0: you know it depends on what the book is like The ear the eye the arm.

215
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,330
Speaker 0: there aren't a lot of book clubs that talked about it.

216
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:57,130
Speaker 0: So we tried to analyze its themes and do like some serious Likrit.

217
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:03,970
Speaker 0: but I don't really want to bother with that with the Odyssey because The Odyssey is one of the most studied stories in human history.

218
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:13,068
Speaker 0: You can read way smarter people than us, so I want to approach this talking about This translation and like it how it worked

219
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:13,410
Speaker 1: for us

220
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:22,189
Speaker 0: And more importantly I also want to talk about The story at face value as we read it like as though We just read this book and it had no history.

221
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:23,915
Speaker 0: But I'm not gonna try to read into it.

222
00:15:24,316 --> 00:15:29,319
Speaker 0: you can go read the debate over whether or not Odysseus was justified in killing all the slaves.

223
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:29,784
Speaker 0: right.

224
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:35,350
Speaker 1: so Having not read completely other translations, I've read you know small portions.

225
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,542
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why I'm really curious.

226
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,982
Speaker 0: from your impression What kind of person do you think Odysseus is?

227
00:15:40,203 --> 00:15:41,369
Speaker 0: is what I really want to ask you.

228
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:42,893
Speaker 1: well That's the thing right is like.

229
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:51,054
Speaker 1: so on the one hand you sort of feel like well this story is so old and not Advanced right.

230
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:53,040
Speaker 1: it doesn't have modern sensibilities.

231
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,180
Speaker 1: It has the most ancient of sensibility possible yep Almost the most ancient human sensibility possible.

232
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,819
Speaker 1: so you assume that it's sort of really Straightforward and not complex.

233
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,216
Speaker 1: right Odysseus is a is a straightforward Hero good guy, dude.

234
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:13,190
Speaker 1: right he goes to a war, but it can't get home because the gods are tormenting him.

235
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,715
Speaker 1: But he's a smart good awesome, dude Which is why Athena likes him.

236
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:17,096
Speaker 1: I love.

237
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:23,748
Speaker 0: he's so smart and good that the the opening to the book is basically just Athena being Like hey Zeus remember Odysseus.

238
00:16:24,353 --> 00:16:25,480
Speaker 0: We should do something about him.

239
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,115
Speaker 0: and Zeus is even like oh, yeah He's like the one smart one.

240
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:31,489
Speaker 1: all right all right his special skills are lying and fighting.

241
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:37,070
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all he lying fighting and then crying about the aftermath of fighting.

242
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,440
Speaker 1: There's three things you know, but he's a good person.

243
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,570
Speaker 1: He cares about his family right now.

244
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,685
Speaker 1: You know he cares about his crew people right even though.

245
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:52,655
Speaker 1: He's banging a hot goddess He still wants his regular life and frankly his crew people not the sharpest tools in the shed You know.

246
00:16:52,997 --> 00:16:56,777
Speaker 1: and then you know he gets home And you know he takes care of things.

247
00:16:56,837 --> 00:17:06,650
Speaker 1: and if in a way that you know it's a modern sensibility seems evil and cruel First he lies and then he fights yeah exactly those are his two things.

248
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:08,910
Speaker 1: Say I guess he's okay at voting.

249
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:10,778
Speaker 0: I guess what I enjoyed the most.

250
00:17:10,818 --> 00:17:15,498
Speaker 0: that didn't come out because when I read the old when I read this originally I read the Odyssey in high school fall friend.

251
00:17:15,638 --> 00:17:16,924
Speaker 0: and was that it?

252
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:20,204
Speaker 0: I Didn't really get him be like.

253
00:17:20,244 --> 00:17:21,569
Speaker 0: it said like oh, yeah He's a good liar.

254
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,373
Speaker 0: But I didn't really like.

255
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:23,016
Speaker 0: think about like.

256
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:32,214
Speaker 0: I had to have that analysis sort of spoon-fed to me And it didn't really come out from the text that he was a good liar other than the text telling me over and over again He's good at lying.

257
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,902
Speaker 0: reading this he is good at lying.

258
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:40,621
Speaker 1: He lies all the time comes up with Incredibly complex people are like oh, who are you?

259
00:17:40,721 --> 00:17:42,470
Speaker 1: and he comes up with this complete character?

260
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,770
Speaker 1: I'm from this town in this place, and I met this person our vandal a right.

261
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,970
Speaker 1: He's got like a whole story just out of his ass with every minute detail.

262
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,327
Speaker 1: Person's life, that's mostly believable, so I know it was his own dad.

263
00:17:58,347 --> 00:17:59,572
Speaker 0: I noticed something I did.

264
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:02,589
Speaker 0: the only one the only person he does not fool is this dog.

265
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,204
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I love how his dog is like doesn't the dog just die about?

266
00:18:06,224 --> 00:18:08,553
Speaker 0: the dog sees him and it's like well You're back.

267
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:09,757
Speaker 0: I see you now.

268
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:10,881
Speaker 0: I'm dead.

269
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,768
Speaker 0: I was only waiting to see you.

270
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:16,301
Speaker 1: yep So I think the thing about his lying though right is that?

271
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,590
Speaker 1: is that the structure of the book?

272
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,890
Speaker 1: Actually sort of like the chronology of it was totally messed up.

273
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:26,088
Speaker 1: This is the thing that I noticed the most right and most people don't seem to notice this.

274
00:18:26,108 --> 00:18:31,145
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, so normally you think of the story of the Odyssey right and it's like well.

275
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:32,790
Speaker 1: What order do the things happen?

276
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:33,493
Speaker 1: This is the order.

277
00:18:33,553 --> 00:18:34,396
Speaker 1: the things happen.

278
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:34,998
Speaker 1: right.

279
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:35,921
Speaker 1: he's at the war.

280
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,029
Speaker 1: he runs away from the war.

281
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,797
Speaker 0: Well, he would they win the war and he leaves right.

282
00:18:40,837 --> 00:18:41,840
Speaker 1: he leaves the war.

283
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,777
Speaker 1: then all those adventure things happen with the Cyclops And the men and yeah right.

284
00:18:47,078 --> 00:18:59,049
Speaker 1: then he gets trapped on the island with the goddess yeah, then he escapes that island to get to the island with Nausicaa and Then from the island with Nausicaa they actually help him get home.

285
00:18:59,534 --> 00:19:05,706
Speaker 0: Then when he's home he deals with all this shit And then he just that's the actual chronological order and all the shit that home like telemic is not.

286
00:19:05,747 --> 00:19:06,610
Speaker 0: that is happening in parallel.

287
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,190
Speaker 1: But what order if you actually read this book are these things told to you in the book?

288
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:28,217
Speaker 1: He starts on the island with the goddess yeah, and then he goes to the island with Nausicaa and then he tells them the story of the things that happened between the war and Being on the island with the goddess.

289
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,570
Speaker 1: they don't actually say show you those things happening.

290
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:38,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Odysseus telling that King Nausicaa's dad about those things happening and the thing that's.

291
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:42,380
Speaker 1: and when he's telling him Those things is he lying.

292
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,749
Speaker 0: I am so sure he's lying.

293
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:47,535
Speaker 1: so Once I realize this.

294
00:19:47,555 --> 00:19:55,577
Speaker 1: but all those things about the sirens all the famous parts the sirens the world cool That that that's only Odysseus telling a king.

295
00:19:55,637 --> 00:19:57,482
Speaker 1: those things happened right?

296
00:19:58,003 --> 00:19:59,006
Speaker 1: are they actually true?

297
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:01,472
Speaker 1: is the stuff that happened at the war Even true?

298
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:06,670
Speaker 1: well first of all the same time that happened at the war is corroborated by other people like Menelaus.

299
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:14,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, telemic is we see him actually going around and talking to people right and they like they all agree on the history.

300
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:23,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, the second thing is that even though once I realized that and I was like oh Maybe all the fantasy famous adventure shit.

301
00:20:23,502 --> 00:20:27,877
Speaker 1: That's in one chapter of this book by the way yeah, all that's in one chapter where he lie tells the king.

302
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:41,745
Speaker 1: that is that part a lie because everything every story Odysseus tells everyone Else is a lie, but some things he knows later on like in the even towards the end of the book There's a part where Odysseus is thinking to himself, and he's like.

303
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,140
Speaker 1: he's like oh, man This isn't as bad as he's like.

304
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,170
Speaker 1: am I gonna fight all these suitors, and he's like well I killed that fucking Cyclops.

305
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,338
Speaker 1: And it's like he wasn't lying about the Cyclops.

306
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:55,785
Speaker 1: because why would he unless he lied to so much that he convinced himself It was about to make a point that that is?

307
00:20:55,825 --> 00:21:07,430
Speaker 0: the only Potential disruption to your read of that is that people who are very good at lying and tell certain lies consistently Tend to accidentally start to believe those lies and internalize them.

308
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,476
Speaker 1: There's also other truths for example.

309
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:18,470
Speaker 1: so we everything that happened at the war was confirmed by other people who are also at the Trojan War And he did leave on a boat with a bunch of dudes and those dudes are gone.

310
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:19,861
Speaker 1: What the hell happened to them?

311
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:20,890
Speaker 1: if his story is a lie?

312
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:36,969
Speaker 1: Right, so I'm pretty confident that the story We know what happened to them according to him They'll say I'm fairly confident that all the things that he said happened between the war and being on Calypso's Island were mostly true.

313
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:37,650
Speaker 0: Yeah

314
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:53,094
Speaker 1: But and then when he's because it's you know it's a it's primitive writing from the ancient times when he's telling stories to other people and the book the story makes it obvious to the reader that he's lying because he's usually starts those stories by saying he's someone other than Yeah,

315
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,104
Speaker 0: but at the same time when he tells

316
00:21:55,144 --> 00:21:57,172
Speaker 1: the king he's Odysseus He's not lying,

317
00:21:57,513 --> 00:22:00,521
Speaker 0: but he also like reading those passages where he tells the story.

318
00:22:00,942 --> 00:22:18,001
Speaker 0: the thing I noticed being a pretty good liar myself Is that he (Laughter) He you in the telling of the story he does the things that Someone who's good at lying would do.

319
00:22:18,081 --> 00:22:23,701
Speaker 0: when they're lying like Lampshading the fact that he lies he half his stories are.

320
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:28,787
Speaker 0: so I lied to this other motherfucker And I'm telling you about it.

321
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:30,434
Speaker 0: That is like.

322
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:35,110
Speaker 0: that is one of the best ways to convince someone you're lying to that you're not lying to them.

323
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:39,607
Speaker 0: Bring them into the trust of yeah, so I lied to that other guy about this thing.

324
00:22:39,627 --> 00:22:52,050
Speaker 0: hmm And he also like he starts to include very specific details sometimes in the manner that someone who's lying might Do that about exactly how far away the rock was thrown.

325
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:59,157
Speaker 1: But here's the thing is that other people when they're telling stories and not lying Also include all those details.

326
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:05,260
Speaker 1: remember this is yeah these ancient times are before books TV cell phones distractions Whatever all right.

327
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,256
Speaker 1: so people mostly spent their time Entertainment with storytelling.

328
00:23:08,276 --> 00:23:11,910
Speaker 1: so people were good at telling stories or remembered lots and lots of details.

329
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:24,510
Speaker 1: But so I feel like if you showed up at say a king's house Asking for piston the night, and they asked you about your life They would expect you to have all those details because that's how everyone has can tell stories like that true

330
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:33,564
Speaker 0: But at the same time it sort of implied that being a really excellent liar is a core fundamental Aspect of great Greek men.

331
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:44,054
Speaker 0: well and one might notice that all the people telling these stories are great men and Are probably maybe they're all lying to each other great Great in quotes.

332
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:49,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm making quote marks and Telemachus is too young to know how to lie effectively.

333
00:23:50,116 --> 00:23:54,969
Speaker 0: So he's just earnest and I did Look at it that maybe other people are lying to him.

334
00:23:55,612 --> 00:24:03,116
Speaker 1: So so so Telemachus right people tell me is basically glossed over and not paid attention to and people Adapt or homage to the Odyssey.

335
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

336
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,583
Speaker 1: so the thing about Telemachus.

337
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,927
Speaker 1: That's interesting is one.

338
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:12,787
Speaker 0: He's 20 Yeah, but the book it treats him like he's seven mm-hmm.

339
00:24:12,947 --> 00:24:20,670
Speaker 0: the book is like He is to die like he is too young to know anything about anything like even walks outside like you.

340
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,052
Speaker 0: They're worried.

341
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:21,755
Speaker 0: He's gonna die.

342
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:21,916
Speaker 0: well.

343
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:23,484
Speaker 1: I mean you look at Odysseus.

344
00:24:23,524 --> 00:24:24,790
Speaker 1: He's got the time of the scar.

345
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,432
Speaker 1: He's got the.

346
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:28,303
Speaker 1: so people know it's him for sure yeah, but the story of how he got it.

347
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,969
Speaker 1: It's like he was doing Adventury shit from a young age.

348
00:24:32,251 --> 00:24:38,539
Speaker 1: Telemachus I think was sheltered in this wealthy house and yep even though he's 20 He wasn't doing adventury shit like Odysseus was.

349
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,638
Speaker 0: arguably his first adventure is because Odysseus isn't there And he goes out to try to deal with that.

350
00:24:42,719 --> 00:24:44,590
Speaker 1: yeah, and you know and the thing is he's not.

351
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:46,059
Speaker 1: He's not like herp-de-derp.

352
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:46,703
Speaker 1: It's like you know.

353
00:24:46,824 --> 00:24:47,769
Speaker 1: usually he learns.

354
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:47,956
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:56,710
Speaker 1: Usually when you have that sort of character like the weak young Kid who never went on an adventure is like they suck, but Telemachus actually doesn't suck.

356
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,548
Speaker 1: He's just inexperienced, and he you know shows that he clearly he's the son of Odysseus.

357
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:05,097
Speaker 1: yep You're not actually gonna suck if you practice.

358
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:07,525
Speaker 0: look at his baby's first deceit of like.

359
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:13,166
Speaker 0: well don't tell my mom I'm leaving yeah, and I. but then you compare that to Odysseus and his like.

360
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:23,923
Speaker 1: so here's what we're gonna Do to trick the Cyclops right and even though he doesn't like you know he can't physically do anything about the suitors Right he totally just smack talks them all the time.

361
00:25:23,963 --> 00:25:27,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, he has no problem smack You know talking back to them, but he just can't.

362
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,770
Speaker 0: actually that's something that didn't come out either when I read the Odyssey originally.

363
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:32,699
Speaker 1: He isn't just like oh poor suitors.

364
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:32,760
Speaker 1: No.

365
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:33,785
Speaker 1: I'll do what you want.

366
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,850
Speaker 1: He's like you fucking assholes.

367
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,326
Speaker 1: Why don't you get the hell out of here, but I really like you can't make us.

368
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:38,989
Speaker 1: He's like you're right I can't but you guys suck.

369
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:46,083
Speaker 0: I really read Telemachus as this kind of wishy-washy Like milk toast piece of crap kinda like that.

370
00:25:46,123 --> 00:25:51,021
Speaker 0: he wasn't aggressive that he was weak But reading this translation really brought out out.

371
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:53,610
Speaker 0: He's doing what he can yeah, and I think it's partly just that.

372
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,432
Speaker 0: the Capabilities.

373
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:59,289
Speaker 1: yeah, if he was a badass you probably would have just murdered them all in day one, but he wasn't so.

374
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,357
Speaker 0: But he's got this kernel of it like.

375
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:04,649
Speaker 0: he's got the kernel of violence and the kernel of lying like ready mm-hmm.

376
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:07,084
Speaker 0: So let's see.

377
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:27,629
Speaker 0: But I just the way Odysseus tells that story because though another way to look at this like you said is he lands on this island after the war Alone tells this elaborate story, and then the kings of the all the people on this island give him Enough treasure to basically account for everything you would have had if he'd gone to the war

378
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:28,032
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

379
00:26:28,414 --> 00:26:29,502
Speaker 0: and then he just goes home with all

380
00:26:29,522 --> 00:26:30,167
Speaker 1: that mm-hmm.

381
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:36,270
Speaker 0: I do like this kind of sad as an aside though that that island gets completely fucked over for helping him.

382
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:42,830
Speaker 0: Yep, like that is not really talked about much like yeah, Zeus or Poseidon just punished them forever, and they're gone.

383
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:48,206
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I think you know Odysseus doesn't really care about anyone other than himself.

384
00:26:48,227 --> 00:27:00,642
Speaker 1: He doesn't care about like side Consequences, you know it's like the whole Trojan War is like a huge Like basically natural disaster, and he doesn't give it.

385
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:01,366
Speaker 1: He doesn't get a crap.

386
00:27:01,526 --> 00:27:04,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course It's hard to say cuz I don't care about his man who died.

387
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:09,050
Speaker 1: You know even though he makes at the very end he makes peace all of those families, but he doesn't care.

388
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:23,288
Speaker 0: Well notice so he when they're leaving Cersei's house There's what's-his-name props to my man F. Whatever his name was I can't remember who got drunk and just fucking fell to his death from the ceiling because he was dumb and drunk And Odysseus was like.

389
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:23,873
Speaker 0: well we got to go.

390
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:25,141
Speaker 0: so they just didn't like.

391
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:37,890
Speaker 0: they just left him laying there and The only reason he goes back and buries the guy and does all that stuff is because he meets the guys Literal ghost and makes a promise to that ghost and then he has to follow through on the promise or I'll get in trouble.

392
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:51,579
Speaker 1: Yep, I feel like if he does what you know and the other thing is that people you know Oh, this is so smart and so powerful and so awesome 90% of the time Athena just says Odysseus do this and he does that and then Athena makes him strong.

393
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:52,988
Speaker 1: Athena puts a disguise on him.

394
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:56,669
Speaker 1: Athena You know tells him what exactly where to go and what to say and what to do.

395
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,312
Speaker 0: It's a little.

396
00:27:57,613 --> 00:27:58,857
Speaker 1: are you really that awesome?

397
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:03,553
Speaker 1: if Athena is just there some goddess is just you know helping you out and giving you Specific.

398
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:06,490
Speaker 0: and now because if you look at the story Athena didn't help him with Polyphemus.

399
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,650
Speaker 1: No, they're you know, there are definitely things Athena didn't help.

400
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,417
Speaker 0: Athena didn't help it with Cersei.

401
00:28:11,477 --> 00:28:14,890
Speaker 0: He dealt with Cersei on his own mostly Hermes gave him some advice there.

402
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:16,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's it's still.

403
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,760
Speaker 1: it's like there's a lot of God Interference going on right?

404
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,030
Speaker 0: It's like there is a lot of non God interference.

405
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:22,674
Speaker 0: But I do like.

406
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:25,430
Speaker 0: I read Athena very differently too in this translation.

407
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:29,951
Speaker 0: She's very like oh my god is bell dandy magical girl like.

408
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,779
Speaker 0: there's a lot more stuff going on with her.

409
00:28:32,261 --> 00:28:41,328
Speaker 0: that comes out in this text because she's actually Kind of chill and a little bit snarky and a little bit like I'm gonna help you out like do this.

410
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:41,769
Speaker 0: Let's go.

411
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,349
Speaker 0: and She's also really good at lying.

412
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:47,922
Speaker 1: Well, she's also like sort of eager to do certain things.

413
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Zeus is sort of like whatever right?

414
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,076
Speaker 1: So she's a lot of times.

415
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,990
Speaker 0: She's like, I really want to help this Odysseus guy.

416
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,496
Speaker 1: She's like she's like Zeus.

417
00:28:54,577 --> 00:28:55,702
Speaker 1: I want to do this.

418
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:56,867
Speaker 1: It'd be so fucking awesome.

419
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,705
Speaker 1: It's just like Alright, and then she's like, yes, she goes down.

420
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:01,490
Speaker 1: She's like, yeah, let's fuck.

421
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:04,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she's on Odysseus aside.

422
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,253
Speaker 1: So other people get fucked.

423
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:12,245
Speaker 0: as opposed to Poseidon you get the impression that he's just looking around like someone in Philadelphia Just waiting for anyone to cross him, right?

424
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:12,990
Speaker 0: He just comes down.

425
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,542
Speaker 1: He's like who's burning lots of things and sacrifice to me.

426
00:29:16,602 --> 00:29:18,228
Speaker 1: those people good those people good.

427
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:20,698
Speaker 1: Mmm I don't see a lot of smoke coming from over there.

428
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:22,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, who's that smoke for?

429
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:22,909
Speaker 1: not for me?

430
00:29:23,871 --> 00:29:25,849
Speaker 1: Mmm, there's any water near these people.

431
00:29:27,955 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 1: Let me see.

432
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,476
Speaker 0: they got any boats And it also reminds you that boat.

433
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:34,238
Speaker 1: move of it back.

434
00:29:34,459 --> 00:29:37,288
Speaker 0: how powerful Poseidon is that even Zeus is like?

435
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:43,010
Speaker 0: yeah Odysseus really got the short end of the stick, but I can't really do anything about what Poseidon wants.

436
00:29:44,052 --> 00:29:46,968
Speaker 0: Even Zeus can't really tell Poseidon what to do.

437
00:29:48,531 --> 00:29:50,661
Speaker 1: So I like how Zeus is like.

438
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:52,730
Speaker 1: he's the god of strangers, right?

439
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,593
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's I about that.

440
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:56,366
Speaker 1: and like most of the book like this is one more.

441
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:07,870
Speaker 1: I mean there's a lot of morals but the number one moral of the book seems to be if someone comes to visit you properly, yep, you gotta be just nice to them and Don't treat them like shit.

442
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:23,059
Speaker 1: and if you visit someone you can totally expect them to feed you and give you treasure and It's sort of like hey everyone if people are traveling around even if you don't know who the hell they are you should be nice to them and Treat them nicely and that's a lesson.

443
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,230
Speaker 1: I think that is good for the modern world.

444
00:30:25,953 --> 00:30:36,770
Speaker 0: But also based on the context of the forward and a bunch of reading I did about the old Greece is That there seemed to be this idea that people who shared food and did this stranger thing.

445
00:30:37,191 --> 00:30:53,913
Speaker 0: they would then basically be allies and not make war against each other or cause trouble for each other and That was a way to sort of prevent in like local warfare So that to the rest of the world the Greeks are these roving like murderous barbarians that just come to your shores and fucking kill Everything and eat everything.

446
00:30:54,174 --> 00:30:56,842
Speaker 1: I mean in I guess in newer times than this.

447
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:59,749
Speaker 1: right you know lots of nomadic peoples have the same kind of thing.

448
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,656
Speaker 1: Hospitality right where it's like.

449
00:31:01,676 --> 00:31:03,343
Speaker 1: you know you come into my tent.

450
00:31:03,624 --> 00:31:04,428
Speaker 1: You know kind of thing.

451
00:31:04,548 --> 00:31:05,835
Speaker 0: yeah well We've shared water now.

452
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:06,860
Speaker 0: We can't ever go to war.

453
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,750
Speaker 0: yep, but we did neither one.

454
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:09,633
Speaker 0: We know there's.

455
00:31:09,673 --> 00:31:12,744
Speaker 0: let us be friends, but we know there's people on that other island.

456
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,410
Speaker 0: Did you ever have water with them?

457
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:17,029
Speaker 0: No, let's just go steal all their shit.

458
00:31:17,194 --> 00:31:18,929
Speaker 1: It's like yeah They were jerks and he visited them.

459
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:19,794
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like.

460
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:27,450
Speaker 1: well nice people who treat foreigners nicely are treated nicely But even the people who treat each other nicely if you're a shithead won't treat you nicely.

461
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,188
Speaker 1: It's sort of like it's okay to kill jerks.

462
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:36,150
Speaker 0: Yep, because I noticed when they put when he's telling the story of all the different places They land like all these short vignettes.

463
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:45,630
Speaker 0: They land on the one island and everybody tries to eat them and they land on Polyphemus Island and he just eats them and then he goes by skillet and crib doesn't skill.

464
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,777
Speaker 0: I just eat six of them.

465
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,649
Speaker 0: a lot of people get eaten.

466
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's a good.

467
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,310
Speaker 1: it is also a good lesson for the modern world, right?

468
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,014
Speaker 0: Don't get eaten.

469
00:31:54,055 --> 00:31:56,050
Speaker 1: be nice to everyone except jerks.

470
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:59,069
Speaker 1: Jerks, you can treat like shit cuz they're jerks.

471
00:31:59,471 --> 00:31:59,954
Speaker 0: I do enjoy.

472
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:03,610
Speaker 0: you know you talked about like you don't have to tolerate intolerance how the gods do a lot.

473
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:14,370
Speaker 0: but if you notice as most situations where a god or goddess helps Odysseus They're only helping them with the part with him with the part that he can't do anything about.

474
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:19,873
Speaker 0: Because there's one point where Hermes is like and I think Athena says a similar thing to him at one point You can't.

475
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,262
Speaker 0: Cersei definitely says this you're a human.

476
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:24,310
Speaker 0: You can't do shit about what the gods want.

477
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:27,566
Speaker 0: If a god tells you to do something you do it.

478
00:32:27,586 --> 00:32:28,169
Speaker 0: That's right.

479
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,926
Speaker 0: Ghostbusters taught us that lesson, but not but.

480
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:42,118
Speaker 1: but Someone asked you if you're a god you say this is in the lucky position where the gods want good happen to want him to do Any unlucky position whether them do.

481
00:32:42,219 --> 00:32:45,230
Speaker 0: he's in the unlucky position where the gods are interested in him.

482
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:52,229
Speaker 0: It's this double-edged sword if the gods notice you it's generally more bad than good even if they want to help you.

483
00:32:53,192 --> 00:32:59,430
Speaker 0: But because the gods noticed him and are fucking with him at least he has other gods who like him enough to help him.

484
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:03,006
Speaker 1: If you want to know about God's noticing you you should watch Clash of the Titans.

485
00:33:03,207 --> 00:33:10,903
Speaker 0: Yeah Or possibly read the Prince of Nothing series depending on how that goes Because that is definitely do not let the gods notice you.

486
00:33:11,164 --> 00:33:11,888
Speaker 1: what do you see?

487
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,548
Speaker 1: The Lord of the Rings you don't want the Eye of Sauron upon you do not want it to see you.

488
00:33:23,298 --> 00:33:24,018
Speaker 0: But oh I had.

489
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:27,265
Speaker 0: it was nothing I was thinking of along the lines of polyphemus and all these people eating people right.

490
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:32,070
Speaker 0: so the gods Like they make all these points about how you can't do anything about the gods.

491
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:39,619
Speaker 0: You can only do things about people and the gods really only help Odysseus with the god stuff And he really just deals with the people stuff on his own.

492
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:53,822
Speaker 0: He's pretty good at it, but at the same time With the people stuff he very often makes mistakes like he doesn't tell his crew the full truth And then as a result they do something stupid, and then he gets fucked over by it.

493
00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:56,370
Speaker 1: that happens with the cow eating situation.

494
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's just like yeah, don't do this thing but he doesn't really tell him why.

495
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:10,420
Speaker 0: or like don't open this bag, but doesn't really tell him why and then they do something stupid and That ruins him, but should he?

496
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,770
Speaker 0: I feel like he could have lied to his guys Or he could have told him the truth.

497
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,000
Speaker 0: They both would have worked, but instead he just omits the truth.

498
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,149
Speaker 0: it seems like omitting is worse than both lying and not lying And that seems to come up multiple times.

499
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:30,364
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, you know it's like Yeah, he was sort of following the instructions.

500
00:34:30,405 --> 00:34:31,210
Speaker 1: He was given right.

501
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,958
Speaker 1: He was like don't eat the right But he can't make anyone else follow the instructions right.

502
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:39,828
Speaker 1: if I if I see a lot of times where he sees Athena and no One else sees her right stuff like that.

503
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:44,766
Speaker 1: And it's like how if I saw God and it told me stuff and then what am I gonna tell you?

504
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:45,268
Speaker 1: hey rim?

505
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:51,016
Speaker 1: I saw Athena, and she said do this you put me in the crazy house The same time at one point.

506
00:34:51,036 --> 00:34:56,118
Speaker 0: tell tell tell Emma kiss is like Athena told me to do this and everyone's like oh Then you should do it mm-hmm.

507
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,249
Speaker 0: if Athena tells you to do something just do it like.

508
00:34:58,711 --> 00:35:01,038
Speaker 0: Everyone agrees that gods are literally real.

509
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,690
Speaker 1: and even that time where it's like Oh Zeus send me a sighs like Thunder.

510
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:13,030
Speaker 0: It's like oh all right Immediate thunder, but there's one thing in Emily Wilson's translation that I noticed specifically.

511
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:16,305
Speaker 0: I remember when they win the siren bit which is so short.

512
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,490
Speaker 0: It's like such in passing.

513
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:21,473
Speaker 1: It is weird that that's like the number one most Adapted.

514
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:25,386
Speaker 1: you know thing in other media other you know tales yet.

515
00:35:25,647 --> 00:35:26,389
Speaker 1: It's like a page.

516
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:29,744
Speaker 1: It's less than a page, but how?

517
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:35,790
Speaker 1: I wonder how you know that became like that portion of the story became the.

518
00:35:36,613 --> 00:35:41,396
Speaker 1: You know as it were the story was adapted over the years how that part was magnified and the other modified.

519
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:45,205
Speaker 0: Sexy bird ladies because it's fun.

520
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:55,810
Speaker 0: Yeah There I think actually the forward talks a little bit about that Especially because it points out that the thing the siren seduce Odysseus with is not any of the things.

521
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,323
Speaker 1: Oh, I love that a lot.

522
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,456
Speaker 0: that yeah They literally try to seduce him with.

523
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:05,750
Speaker 0: we'll tell you about what happened in the war that you fought because you clearly have PTSD.

524
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:08,277
Speaker 1: Yep, imagine rim if there was like.

525
00:36:08,317 --> 00:36:11,346
Speaker 1: you know you're going past some sirens right and it's like you know.

526
00:36:11,366 --> 00:36:15,030
Speaker 1: people tend to think you know With the sirens they were just singing such sweet music.

527
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,829
Speaker 1: It was so wonderful to hear you wanted to go over and listen to it forever because it was like.

528
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:19,752
Speaker 1: you know I'm mystifying.

529
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:20,033
Speaker 1: It's like.

530
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:22,359
Speaker 1: no the sirens were like hey Odysseus.

531
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,582
Speaker 1: We know everything.

532
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:27,152
Speaker 1: he's like uh-huh all right, so he's like Rim.

533
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,335
Speaker 1: I know everything uh-huh.

534
00:36:28,616 --> 00:36:30,161
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what dark matter is.

535
00:36:30,502 --> 00:36:31,144
Speaker 0: oh, no.

536
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:32,187
Speaker 0: I'd swim over there.

537
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,801
Speaker 1: It's like I'll let you play this video game.

538
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,770
Speaker 1: I'll let you play quest for glory.

539
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:47,271
Speaker 0: But when Cersei warns him about the sirens she basically says I'll tell you what happens in half-life 3.

540
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:54,898
Speaker 0: She says like like plug your ears if you want to hear it like if you're curious Get your men to tell you up like if.

541
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,021
Speaker 0: but when Odysseus tells his men about the sirens He says she told me I have to listen.

542
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:10,378
Speaker 0: I Thought that was really really funny That that divide between those two lines I mean that stood out in my head.

543
00:37:10,398 --> 00:37:11,081
Speaker 0: cuz I got to.

544
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:11,844
Speaker 1: you're a smart.

545
00:37:11,884 --> 00:37:14,995
Speaker 1: cuz if you're a smart person at least You're a curious person, right?

546
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:15,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, Odysseus.

547
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:20,270
Speaker 1: We're told is the smart person smarter than the other people and there's some evidence of that?

548
00:37:20,451 --> 00:37:22,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you know he's curious as hell.

549
00:37:22,832 --> 00:37:28,630
Speaker 0: And also it's smart because if he was like yeah guys I really want to listen to this shit cuz apparently it's awesome.

550
00:37:28,691 --> 00:37:31,297
Speaker 0: But none of you can You know what happened?

551
00:37:31,538 --> 00:37:33,510
Speaker 0: one of his 88 people would have pulled the earplugs out.

552
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:38,895
Speaker 1: You can't tie everyone to the back to the mask because Who's gonna row the boat?

553
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:42,530
Speaker 0: and he learned his lesson because all the other times his crew fucked up.

554
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:46,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it was both smart that he did that and really funny that that's how he did it.

555
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:54,436
Speaker 0: That stood out to me really strongly even though I read that part a long time ago cuz we announced this book club in like March.

556
00:37:54,946 --> 00:38:02,397
Speaker 0: okay so I mean uh Really really like this translation And I really like the story.

557
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:04,585
Speaker 1: the main thing that you know that I like about it.

558
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:16,290
Speaker 1: Is that it's just way Easy to read because usually when you have translations of things They're they're all written in a way that makes them difficult to read or you have to read them slowly and carefully.

559
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:24,170
Speaker 0: I'm just easy to read but more like I Intrinsically got the parts that were funny or the parts that were supposed to be scared.

560
00:38:24,732 --> 00:38:30,930
Speaker 1: I can both breeze through it and not have to read slowly and carefully and also gain a complete understanding of what's happening.

561
00:38:31,994 --> 00:38:35,810
Speaker 1: A lot of the ones are written in sort of fake oldie English.

562
00:38:36,372 --> 00:38:41,848
Speaker 1: You know they're written the way that Shakespeare actually wrote, but fakely right now put in like so these mr..

563
00:38:41,908 --> 00:38:42,330
Speaker 0: Thou mr.

564
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:50,090
Speaker 1: Thou yeah thousand these and whatever to sound old even though the the Shakespeare was thousands of years after.

565
00:38:51,573 --> 00:39:04,331
Speaker 1: But the difference between current English You know the English that we speak on this podcast and the English of Shakespeare is a spec compared to the difference between Shakespeare's English and Greek Homer.

566
00:39:04,673 --> 00:39:13,029
Speaker 1: so what's the point if you're even if you use fancy old words that they're not any old They're not really as old as Greek, so what's the point right?

567
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,250
Speaker 0: What is the difference between as long as I'll make it so someone can fucking read it like reading a paragraph or a stanza?

568
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,715
Speaker 0: Whatever, and then there's the note.

569
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:22,686
Speaker 0: That's like Telemachus is being snarky here versus just reading.

570
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:25,629
Speaker 0: be like a Telemachus Yeah, yeah.

571
00:39:27,455 --> 00:39:33,092
Speaker 0: And like the ghosts were not scary at all in high school like when I read that bit with like ghosts It was just like.

572
00:39:33,614 --> 00:39:36,825
Speaker 0: so what these people just like walk over and talk to him this part.

573
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,410
Speaker 0: It actually was like creepy.

574
00:39:39,012 --> 00:39:44,617
Speaker 1: Yes, like yeah in order to in order to proceed he had to go into hell and back Yeah, and it's like oh shit.

575
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:45,340
Speaker 1: Where's he going?

576
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:51,864
Speaker 0: I like that bit a lot cuz he's like Scared, but then he starts to do it, and then he's like really individually see like his graph.

577
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:52,928
Speaker 1: forget all the details.

578
00:39:52,948 --> 00:39:57,457
Speaker 0: like he sees He sees captain what's-his-name?

579
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,501
Speaker 0: who fell to his death.

580
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:03,863
Speaker 1: yeah, right like that guy's just like oh, yeah He sees Agamemnon, but Agamemnon runs there later to see the suitors.

581
00:40:04,184 --> 00:40:07,134
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was funny Agamemnon.

582
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:13,489
Speaker 1: at the almost at the very end of the book all the suitors are dead and Agamemnon and Achilles are there and isn't someone else there?

583
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:14,548
Speaker 0: I forget so yet.

584
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:21,194
Speaker 1: But basically those are the two important ones that are there, and they're like oh all the awesome dudes from Ithaca Why the hell are you dead?

585
00:40:21,214 --> 00:40:26,030
Speaker 1: and they're like we were trying to get with Odysseus' wife because he disappeared.

586
00:40:26,171 --> 00:40:28,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're like they knew Odysseus in life, right?

587
00:40:28,748 --> 00:40:32,278
Speaker 0: Yeah And like half the ghosts are like motherfucking Odysseus.

588
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:33,381
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

589
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:39,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then they're like you know because they didn't think the suitors are bad Because they weren't paying attention to what was happening in the real world.

590
00:40:39,883 --> 00:40:41,029
Speaker 1: right and then they're like.

591
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,940
Speaker 1: But then Odysseus actually came back and his wife didn't.

592
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:48,330
Speaker 1: you know like was actually loyal to him and wouldn't get with any of us.

593
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:52,769
Speaker 1: And Agamemnon's like man, what an awesome wife not like my bitch wife who killed me.

594
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,378
Speaker 0: Yep, Agamemnon is really like.

595
00:40:55,438 --> 00:41:03,275
Speaker 0: his advice to Odysseus is pretty shitty and sexist because he's like yeah Don't let your like don't tell your wife too much Because she might do something to you.

596
00:41:03,757 --> 00:41:05,743
Speaker 0: You know and then but then at the same time.

597
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,070
Speaker 0: He's like the Penelope is pretty smart.

598
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:22,417
Speaker 0: Yeah My favorite bit of the ghost and we talked about this before the show was that Hercules comes out and he's just like all the other ghosts are like sad and mournful and wistful and Like they're they're very weird.

599
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:35,186
Speaker 0: and then and like yeah, we're dead and where there's no substance to us anymore And it sucks down here and then Hercules just comes out with a bow and arrow like Like you see Odysseus and all the other ghosts are afraid of his sword, and he's just like.

600
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:41,650
Speaker 0: I'll fight you Like he comes right out just being badass like yeah, all these other people are dead, but I'm a badass I'm Heracles.

601
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,278
Speaker 0: What do you want?

602
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,187
Speaker 0: Let's go What up?

603
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

604
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:57,683
Speaker 1: it's also cool that even in whatever BC thousand-something BC sex and violence are still really awesome And people today still really like sex and violence.

605
00:41:57,703 --> 00:41:58,990
Speaker 1: so not much has changed humans.

606
00:41:59,317 --> 00:41:59,502
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:42:00,114 --> 00:42:11,501
Speaker 0: But the story does like Many parts of it feel very natural to a modern sensibility if you just translate it with natural modern language Like the like the lying and all the things Odysseus does like.

608
00:42:11,521 --> 00:42:14,714
Speaker 0: a lot of it fits very well with the way we talk act And think today.

609
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:17,489
Speaker 0: humans back then weren't that different from humans today?

610
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,262
Speaker 1: I mean you can see most basic adventure stories you read today really aren't?

611
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:23,450
Speaker 1: you know have a lot in common with this, right?

612
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:26,323
Speaker 1: You know it's like oh, I'm in a tight spot.

613
00:42:26,404 --> 00:42:29,502
Speaker 1: I go on a little journey I get into another tight spot a little journey.

614
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:31,928
Speaker 1: I have a goal in mind of place I want to get to at the end.

615
00:42:32,371 --> 00:42:33,616
Speaker 1: You know the big bad guys.

616
00:42:33,656 --> 00:42:36,867
Speaker 1: they get there they get their comeuppance everyone's happy.

617
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,936
Speaker 0: the end yep And this is in the forward.

618
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,229
Speaker 0: so I don't really want to go deep into it because you can read the forward if you didn't.

619
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:50,733
Speaker 0: But I really like how specifically this calls out the slaves everywhere Because that's just that.

620
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:59,770
Speaker 0: pre like proto-greek society like the Mycenae, you know all the civilizations that disappeared around the see people time Probably built the most entirely on slavery.

621
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,717
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean you know most people they think.

622
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:01,958
Speaker 1: if you.

623
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:10,450
Speaker 1: if I say to you ancient Greece most people in their mind immediately Have a picture of like you know Athens with white pillars and buildings everywhere.

624
00:43:11,053 --> 00:43:13,668
Speaker 0: Those pillars were painted the most gaudy paint you can imagine.

625
00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:19,008
Speaker 1: also You know parthenon's right and then lots of dudes and togas walking around right?

626
00:43:19,249 --> 00:43:19,450
Speaker 1: It's like.

627
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:20,710
Speaker 1: That's what you think immediately.

628
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:21,513
Speaker 1: But it's like.

629
00:43:21,874 --> 00:43:33,430
Speaker 0: no it was way ancient human times before even feudalism Sparta invaded its neighbors and enslaved them to similarly to how the United States enslaved Africans.

630
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:40,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had a rich dude And then you had a chattel slavery not not all those other forms of slavery from like later greek or roman times.

631
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:46,270
Speaker 1: You had rich people who mattered in society at least and then a whole bunch of slaves and servants and other subs.

632
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:52,587
Speaker 0: You know servile peoples below them and even like Circe has nymphs as slaves like.

633
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:54,551
Speaker 0: they're just slaves Everywhere.

634
00:43:55,014 --> 00:43:58,714
Speaker 0: and you see all these times so dizzy has had so few people with him that even on the trip he's always like.

635
00:43:59,157 --> 00:44:08,646
Speaker 0: so I'll send you three and Take a slave like he'd send slaves along because he didn't have that many people to do stuff for him Mm-hmm, but they're never mentioned in it.

636
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:13,140
Speaker 0: like the people Until he assigns a slave to like one of his scouting parties.

637
00:44:14,043 --> 00:44:21,467
Speaker 0: at no point is anyone with him described Like until it matters and like oh yeah and some slaves like you wouldn't even know he had slaves with him.

638
00:44:21,568 --> 00:44:24,946
Speaker 1: at the end though They do make they they make like this special note, right?

639
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:25,610
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

640
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:32,473
Speaker 1: Well, there's the swine herd who's like the best slave and he's a good person who lets people in his home and treats them Well still a slave.

641
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:36,004
Speaker 1: He's still a slave but because he's good Odysseus treats him good.

642
00:44:36,044 --> 00:44:37,910
Speaker 1: There's the cow herd also who's good.

643
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:45,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I stayed loyal to Odysseus So he was treated well, and then there's the goat herd who is probably the worst motherfucker.

644
00:44:46,676 --> 00:44:49,549
Speaker 1: The goat herd is worse than the fucking suitors.

645
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:54,610
Speaker 1: He's just an evil asshole who betrayed Odysseus and tried to help the suitors even though he was Odysseus's slave.

646
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,641
Speaker 1: And it's like all the other like the suitors.

647
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:58,370
Speaker 1: They just get speared in the head or whatever.

648
00:44:58,751 --> 00:44:59,936
Speaker 1: This is the goat herd man.

649
00:44:59,976 --> 00:45:01,602
Speaker 1: He gets like chopped up into pieces.

650
00:45:01,622 --> 00:45:02,746
Speaker 1: They like chop his nuts off.

651
00:45:02,786 --> 00:45:06,836
Speaker 1: I think it's like He gets it bad and they sort of.

652
00:45:06,876 --> 00:45:08,145
Speaker 1: you know, it's like he deserves it.

653
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:13,130
Speaker 1: bad because You know, I guess he did a worse thing than what the suitors are doing.

654
00:45:13,194 --> 00:45:18,641
Speaker 0: Yep But those are the bits That are very different compared to a modern sensibility of a story.

655
00:45:18,661 --> 00:45:29,239
Speaker 0: all the stuff around the slaves all the stuff around the Retribution against like the women after and this after the suitors were killed all that stuff Definitely reeks of this very old and messed up age.

656
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,750
Speaker 1: I like how he tells the grandmother the nanny slave grandma.

657
00:45:32,891 --> 00:45:36,790
Speaker 1: He's like, I don't need you to tell me, you know, which women are good and which ones aren't good.

658
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,875
Speaker 1: I'll figure that out myself.

659
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:47,670
Speaker 1: And then when it actually comes time, he's like, hey granny, which of the ladies should Which ones are gonna get hung outside and which ones are stayed loyal.

660
00:45:47,871 --> 00:45:48,031
Speaker 1: I guess

661
00:45:48,091 --> 00:46:07,031
Speaker 0: it definitely comes out very clearly that Odysseus's primary attribute might not even necessarily be that he's good at lying Or good good at lying and fighting but it's that he spends almost all his effort Controlling what other people think about him and making sure that the story people tell about him is exactly the one he wants them to Tell.

662
00:46:07,635 --> 00:46:08,741
Speaker 0: I mean he gets a bunch of his like.

663
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:15,330
Speaker 0: he gets his men killed leaving Polyphemus's cave because as soon as he's out of range like as soon as he's on the boat, he turns around.

664
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:16,719
Speaker 0: He's like yo, guess what?

665
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:17,927
Speaker 0: My name's Odysseus.

666
00:46:18,169 --> 00:46:24,370
Speaker 0: fucker Like he risks everyone's lives just to make sure someone will remember his story.

667
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:27,538
Speaker 1: Also, even when he's lying and saying he's not Odysseus.

668
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:30,045
Speaker 1: He includes Odysseus in his story.

669
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:31,790
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, I met this.

670
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,705
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, my name is so-and-so I you know, and what?

671
00:46:34,866 --> 00:46:35,650
Speaker 1: what's my story?

672
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:43,390
Speaker 1: I was traveling around that I met this totally awesome dude named Odysseus And he was doing this and then we parted ways and then I ended up here

673
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:44,573
Speaker 0: You know, and

674
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:51,921
Speaker 1: now that person who believes that lie may know of Odysseus because he's so famous but also now believes Awesomeness about Odysseus.

675
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:59,490
Speaker 0: I would actually believe a Specific party lied a lot in is the part where he's recounting all the dead people he met.

676
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:03,370
Speaker 0: Let's assume that he did go to Hades and some of that is true, which does make sense.

677
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:07,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess there's no that he could be lying about going to Hades But he's like he.

678
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:12,910
Speaker 0: I think he learned of what happened to him Agamemnon there in a way that he might not have been able to other like.

679
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:17,090
Speaker 0: It's possible to argue that he learned things from them that he couldn't have learned otherwise.

680
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:29,862
Speaker 0: But I would read that even if he literally did the Hades thing and literally met some of those people that he lied about most of them because it goes from like My mom like specific people who he learned something important.

681
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:39,795
Speaker 0: and then it's just like he name-drops fucking Everyone in all of Greek history, it's like oh, yeah and Hercules was there and Agamemnon was there.

682
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,260
Speaker 1: the thing is it's like I'm the one.

683
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:47,097
Speaker 1: usually what happens in a lot of stories a common trope is There'll be fantastical elements.

684
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:54,346
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and those fantastical elements It's like oh that was actually that none of that literally happened.

685
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:55,250
Speaker 1: that was just shown.

686
00:47:55,511 --> 00:48:00,010
Speaker 1: You know, you thought it was literally happening, but actually it was in a dream or an imagination.

687
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:07,290
Speaker 0: Example of that Kill Bill the Crazy 88 at the end of Kill Bill like there's this crazy fight scene.

688
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:09,980
Speaker 0: It's like the climax of the movie the second movie.

689
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:14,074
Speaker 0: when the crazy 88 comes up and someone tells the story They make it very clear.

690
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:16,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, there weren't actually 88 of them.

691
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:20,449
Speaker 1: Well, there weren't 88 of them in the movie But you know there was a crazy fight.

692
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:23,852
Speaker 0: Yeah, the crazy 88 but that line if there weren't 88 of them in the way It's.

693
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,209
Speaker 1: they just thought it was cool to call them.

694
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:32,070
Speaker 1: But anyway, but now but the way that is more like, you know Utena where there's like there's an explanation for the supernatural parts that they do not real.

695
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:39,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though you see you think the whole time you're reading the story is supernatural parts are real and then they're not actually real.

696
00:48:39,391 --> 00:48:40,597
Speaker 1: Right, they were just made.

697
00:48:40,637 --> 00:48:46,560
Speaker 1: you believe they were real but actually no in the Odyssey The supernatural parts are within the world of the Odyssey real.

698
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,265
Speaker 1: bringing Zeus is making Thunder.

699
00:48:48,286 --> 00:48:49,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

700
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:56,890
Speaker 1: so there's no reason to question the Hades part or The Cersei turning people into pigs part or the goddess and the island of

701
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,499
Speaker 0: Question that based

702
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:01,210
Speaker 1: on this based on their supernatural

703
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:13,683
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, but based on the the Shorter they caught the giant name-dropping that happens after the important ones Really feels like you just throw it in right bunch of more stuff to keep the cuz.

704
00:49:13,703 --> 00:49:14,045
Speaker 0: he's got the.

705
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:25,135
Speaker 1: he's basically got all The important people on this island listening to his story, but you what I'm saying is that you could easily Modify the Odyssey so slightly To where you could be like.

706
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:31,554
Speaker 1: well all the soup most of the supernatural stuff happens on that the one chapter of adventure After the war right?

707
00:49:32,157 --> 00:49:35,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's most of the supernatural stuff is there.

708
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:42,689
Speaker 1: You could retell the Odyssey in such a way to where nothing supernatural at all happens outside of that one part.

709
00:49:42,709 --> 00:49:46,801
Speaker 1: and Yes, Odysseus actually is lying about all the supernatural thing.

710
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:51,177
Speaker 1: else, you know, and that would be kind of a cool You know way to think about it.

711
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,383
Speaker 1: That's not what happens in this.

712
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:53,669
Speaker 1: Nope, you know the real one.

713
00:49:54,733 --> 00:49:59,730
Speaker 0: But I think you could even tell the story and I never considered this possibility until I read this translation.

714
00:50:00,092 --> 00:50:04,270
Speaker 0: You even tell the story of he might not have even made it to the fucking Trojan War.

715
00:50:04,874 --> 00:50:15,104
Speaker 0: He might have gone to this war bailed Had trouble ended up on this island and then just tells this giant story gets these people to give him much elude and then goes Home and fucks up the suitors.

716
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:19,265
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Like you could you could think that you could argue that the entire middle was a lie.

717
00:50:19,285 --> 00:50:25,729
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But I really enjoyed it and I want to read pretty much anything that Emily Wilson translates at this point.

718
00:50:26,372 --> 00:50:27,759
Speaker 1: What is she gonna translate that?

719
00:50:27,859 --> 00:50:30,110
Speaker 1: so there's the the Iliad which comes before the Odyssey?

720
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,678
Speaker 1: Which is the actual story of the Trojan War.

721
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:36,210
Speaker 1: there's the law there's a Kelly's and Agamemnon and everybody.

722
00:50:36,391 --> 00:50:38,037
Speaker 0: There's supposedly some sequel at the.

723
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:41,490
Speaker 0: tell us something that is it's the sequel to the Odyssey.

724
00:50:42,153 --> 00:50:51,312
Speaker 0: That was written way later than the Odyssey but way Ancient still like still really a really old story, but supposedly it's lost Uh-huh.

725
00:50:52,034 --> 00:51:02,698
Speaker 1: It is cool that like even in this ancient ancient times a thousand years before, you know actual Greece there was like You know like sequels, right?

726
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:07,764

727
00:51:08,952 --> 00:51:12,550
Speaker 1: It's like it's like they're expecting you and they tell it when you're reading the Odyssey.

728
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:15,750
Speaker 1: It's sort of assumed, you know, what happened in the Iliad, right?

729
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,524
Speaker 1: It's like oh there's Agamemnon and there's Menelaus and Helen and everything.

730
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:24,761
Speaker 1: and it's like, you know, you're supposed to know Yeah, it doesn't tell you who Achilles is.

00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:30,546
Speaker 0: it assumes, you know, yeah I mean it was just like yeah, no kill I saw Achilles and it was like yeah Achilles.
