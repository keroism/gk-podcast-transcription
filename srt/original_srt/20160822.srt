1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,802
Speaker 1: It's Monday August 22nd 2016.

2
00:00:12,802 --> 00:00:13,243
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,283 --> 00:00:21,235
Speaker 1: He's Scott and this is geek nights tonight and tells new KP like architecture and adblock Wars and a bunch of meat.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,418
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,112 --> 00:00:37,783
Speaker 1: So I actually was looking at of all things because I've been biking to work again And the weather is like perfect for biking now, and I if I got caught in that rainstorm biking yesterday I dodged that rainstorm not yesterday.

6
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,030
Speaker 1: I didn't get rain on Saturday.

7
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,506
Speaker 1: I was on the west side with Emily.

8
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,321
Speaker 0: Saturday I avoided getting rained on.

9
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,450
Speaker 0: I was biking and I saw there.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:50,209
Speaker 0: I knew the rain was coming so it was time to go home and then as I was coming home I saw the rain moving around in the distance.

11
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:52,138
Speaker 0: We saw the rain coming and I went over.

12
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,790
Speaker 0: I was getting towards Queens and things were looking wet.

13
00:00:54,891 --> 00:00:56,097
Speaker 0: All the streets are crazy wet.

14
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:58,590
Speaker 0: They're big puddles everywhere, but it wasn't raining.

15
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:03,530
Speaker 0: We just said and I managed to get home without getting wet and we kept biking.

16
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,966
Speaker 1: So we biked through the rain and then the rain lit up.

17
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:07,870
Speaker 1: We're like, alright, that was fun.

18
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,816
Speaker 1: And then we're like, well, we're wet now.

19
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:14,270
Speaker 1: So let's just go home and then the crazy rain came out of nowhere.

20
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,241
Speaker 1: So we just we're done.

21
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:17,350
Speaker 1: We're on our way home.

22
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, so we biked over the like went all the way home over the bridge and everything.

23
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,150
Speaker 1: It was raining so hard that on the bridge you didn't slip and fall.

24
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,990
Speaker 1: No, cuz I got a good bike and good tires and I got know what I'm doing.

25
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:39,203
Speaker 1: But uh, well if I didn't fall it does some slippery shit though, you know Good tires good technique Even even pro people fall down Yeah occasionally But again at the same time my tires are not.

26
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:41,732
Speaker 1: my tires are sort of designed for Like.

27
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:46,984
Speaker 1: they're not as efficient as like a pro racer tire would be because I like to be comfortable and I like to not fall over.

28
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:55,430
Speaker 1: So going up the bridge There's all those downspouts that are inside the bike lane for when it rains because usually they're on people biking over there.

29
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:59,069
Speaker 1: Water was just spraying out of them like fire hoses all the way up the bridge.

30
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:08,695
Speaker 1: it's good times, but I Noticed this morning as I was biking to work that my left my front brake cable Has a few.

31
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:10,585
Speaker 1: a few of the threads have snapped internally.

32
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:11,409
Speaker 1: I can feel it in there.

33
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:21,679
Speaker 1: so it's time to get those replaced and I went and updated my bike maintenance log as I keep track of what maintenance I do and I Gathered some slightly interesting statistics while I was at work over lunch.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,075
Speaker 1: Okay, I realized that I replaced my bike brake pads Front and rear.

35
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:32,955
Speaker 1: I was replacing at the same time every three years tops See my the blood.

36
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:36,226
Speaker 1: the bike I got in the pads just like the pads.

37
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:39,435
Speaker 0: the bike I got in 2010. it's now 2016.

38
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,478
Speaker 0: Yep.

39
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:45,057
Speaker 0: I replaced the pads once ever and they're still fine now.

40
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:52,465
Speaker 1: my cables I replace a Little over twice a year, but just the brake cables.

41
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:53,830
Speaker 0: the cables twice a year.

42
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:56,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've replaced the cables never.

43
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:59,370
Speaker 1: the reason I replace them invariably is I snap them.

44
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:04,610
Speaker 1: Okay, so I was digging around to my other stuff now my other cables like my shifter cables.

45
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,218
Speaker 0: It sounds like they're probably too tight.

46
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,571
Speaker 1: Uh, no, I think Ones.

47
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:11,017
Speaker 0: no, I've never.

48
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,610
Speaker 0: I've never broken a shifting or braking cable.

49
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:22,650
Speaker 1: but I was looking through some note like email emails I had and receipts from older stuff and I pretty much never wear out my brake pads.

50
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,494
Speaker 1: It's just the cables.

51
00:03:23,895 --> 00:03:29,180
Speaker 1: and I was thinking about my biking style, especially in the old days But I think I just carried over from mountain biking.

52
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:43,452
Speaker 1: I very rarely will shed speed Slow like I'll never shed speed by like bleeding my brakes along the way I'll pretty much be going real fast and then I'll shed my speed all at once if I'm forced to so hard braking Rarely,

53
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,403
Speaker 0: that's pretty much how you drive a car.

54
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,954
Speaker 0: Also a bad way Like that.

55
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:53,141
Speaker 0: Listen, like racing someone who do something dumb you get rid you go You you hit the brake way too late and way too hard.

56
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:54,045
Speaker 1: pretty much almost always.

57
00:03:54,105 --> 00:03:54,950
Speaker 1: engine brake in my car.

58
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:56,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, also bad.

59
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:09,741
Speaker 0: why when I when I ride a vehicle I break smoothly and well in advance and go You're stopping it's just gliding and Decelerating and then you're stopped.

60
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:10,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, you stop.

61
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:17,197
Speaker 1: The only time I don't do that is when I'm driving in New York when everything's stop and go nonsense Even in the stop and go nonsense.

62
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:18,101
Speaker 0: I will go.

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do.

64
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,730
Speaker 1: I would like to ride in a car with you.

65
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,349
Speaker 1: Then I just let's say you even drove in New York.

66
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:33,969
Speaker 1: next time we're gonna drive to a con or something you rent the car instead of me and you can drive and I will sit In the back and I will very well just quietly and politely critique how?

67
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,721
Speaker 1: Rapidly you are braking and accelerating.

68
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,264
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:38,330
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

70
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,153
Speaker 1: We all even do a video.

71
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:43,610
Speaker 1: live stream live stream drive like that video probably just be mad that I'm going slow.

72
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,136
Speaker 1: Thing is it's New York.

73
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:47,685
Speaker 1: I can't ever complain about someone going slow.

74
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:48,570
Speaker 1: It's just gonna go slow.

75
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,738
Speaker 0: It's you are even on the highway.

76
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,658
Speaker 0: I'll be going slow and you'll be like, yeah Why would you go slow on the highway?

77
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,423
Speaker 1: you go as fast as you can Because I go smoothly and safely.

78
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,550
Speaker 0: are the top two prior?

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,850
Speaker 1: Well, no you go fast as you can when it's a straight line.

80
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,787
Speaker 0: Lastly is the third priority that?

81
00:05:02,828 --> 00:05:06,900
Speaker 1: well, yeah But I'm talking like on the Garden State like down to Wildwood.

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,329
Speaker 1: just go like 80 cruise control and that's just it.

83
00:05:11,694 --> 00:05:12,489
Speaker 0: No, why?

84
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:14,133
Speaker 0: Why not?

85
00:05:14,153 --> 00:05:15,838
Speaker 0: that's not how I do but there's.

86
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,044
Speaker 1: it's not like there's traffic just going 80.

87
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,311
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you don't go 80.

88
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,058
Speaker 1: No, you're gonna be that guy in the right lane.

89
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,383
Speaker 1: Everyone's passing you going slow.

90
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,085
Speaker 0: That's right.

91
00:05:24,386 --> 00:05:27,757
Speaker 0: All right old man I got my two priorities of safely and smoothly.

92
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,387
Speaker 1: I would say that going the speed of traffic is safely.

93
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:37,830
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm In fact, I would say that it's very much less safe to be the person who's going slower than everybody else in the right lane.

94
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,000
Speaker 0: Uh-huh says he who skis.

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:45,283
Speaker 1: Yeah In fact, so also it's time to buy new skis.

96
00:05:45,383 --> 00:05:57,230
Speaker 1: a lot of you might think that you know in the old days There was always this conventional wisdom with specialized equipment time To make excuses to buy things like Scott who just bought a new bike when your old bike is perfectly fine.

97
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,676
Speaker 0: I didn't need an excuse to buy that.

98
00:05:59,319 --> 00:05:59,620
Speaker 1: All right.

99
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,790
Speaker 1: Well, but so why did you buy a new bike?

100
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,035
Speaker 0: It was $800 off.

101
00:06:03,336 --> 00:06:04,903
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I'm buying new skis.

102
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:05,446
Speaker 1: There's $600 off.

103
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,206
Speaker 1: It's the season to buy last year's new stuff that no one bought at like half off.

104
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:11,587
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:25,783
Speaker 1: So buy new skis because the skis I wanted are literally like 48% off right now and I did a little bit of research and Every all the reviews seem to agree that these skis are what rim wants.

106
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:33,430
Speaker 1: to get better skis would be to spend Stupid amounts of money and to get shittier skis would be not saving enough money to be worth getting shittier skis.

107
00:06:34,012 --> 00:06:34,815
Speaker 1: So I'm pretty much buying them.

108
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:37,787
Speaker 1: They're basically just like the modern better version of the skis.

109
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:47,165
Speaker 1: I got now slightly shorter because I The style of like super long skis is not what I do and not what really anyone needs to do anymore.

110
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:55,490
Speaker 1: and even better The same kind of skis but like couple steps down right like in Emily's wheelhouse because she's just getting into black diamonds right now.

111
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:57,540
Speaker 1: Also super discount.

112
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:59,010
Speaker 1: I think it's time to buy skis.

113
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:01,295
Speaker 0: No, it's not gonna snow.

114
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,481
Speaker 0: So good luck with that.

115
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:04,530
Speaker 1: Last year was the El Nino year.

116
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:09,095
Speaker 1: This year's gonna be like normal snow weather probably Global warming and I can ski anywhere.

117
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:13,570
Speaker 1: Ah climate change tends to cause more extreme weather not necessarily just warmer rather.

118
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,780
Speaker 1: So in our area, I'm likely to get more snow this year.

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,382
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

120
00:07:17,623 --> 00:07:18,025
Speaker 0: We'll see.

121
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,590
Speaker 0: eventually it's gonna be 80 all year.

122
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:26,449
Speaker 1: Well, yeah when it gets to that point I'll probably flee because New York is flooded and we're fucked anyway, and I gotta go somewhere way flooded on the third floor by me.

123
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:31,084
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are you gonna be going to work through the canals in Manhattan like Venice?

124
00:07:31,506 --> 00:07:32,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a bike powered boat.

125
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:34,375
Speaker 1: Those.

126
00:07:34,436 --> 00:07:40,903
Speaker 1: have you ever ridden one of those things they go So much like for the amount of pedal compared to how fast you go.

127
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:43,270
Speaker 1: They are the worst possible thing.

128
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,636
Speaker 0: That's because those are right.

129
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:50,370
Speaker 0: You could make a boat that was powered by pedaling like a bicycle but didn't go slow.

130
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,432
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah There they exist.

131
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:56,650
Speaker 0: those the ones that you happen to rent at like a vacation place or a little lake just happen to be go.

132
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:57,115
Speaker 1: They exist.

133
00:07:57,135 --> 00:07:57,601
Speaker 1: you ever see him.

134
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,250
Speaker 1: They're a kayak.

135
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:05,510
Speaker 1: They look like a kayak, but once you get going they rise up out of the water And they're on just like one little wing-a-ling.

136
00:08:06,211 --> 00:08:17,690
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure you could even just do a thing where there's like a flywheel and you use you pedal to just get You know energy into it and then put it into a normal motor like the kind of powerboat has with a little propeller.

137
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:20,663
Speaker 1: I'll show you a video or I'll link to a video.

138
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,274
Speaker 1: I'll find a video one of those things I'm just saying.

139
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:28,910
Speaker 1: there are many mechanisms that can be done But it's basically a kayak with a little wing-a-ling and you fly out of the water and it's cool and that's what you want.

140
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,927
Speaker 1: But even then I think a bicycle on asphalt is gonna be way more efficient.

141
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:34,789
Speaker 1: It's just my guess.

142
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,994
Speaker 0: Nothing is nothing.

143
00:08:36,195 --> 00:08:40,010
Speaker 0: No mode of transportation that's ever been invented is better than a bicycle in terms of efficiency.

144
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:42,561
Speaker 1: That's probably true, but I don't.

145
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,494
Speaker 1: I'm not sure and I can't back that up But I could see that being plausible.

146
00:08:45,715 --> 00:08:50,126
Speaker 0: the bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation ever actually created by human beings.

147
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:52,714
Speaker 1: Ah Say it depends.

148
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,457
Speaker 1: What do you?

149
00:08:53,497 --> 00:08:55,444
Speaker 0: and it's also more efficient than any animal.

150
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,030
Speaker 1: What do you mean by more efficient?

151
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,548
Speaker 0: Energy you put in to make it go versus how much you go.

152
00:09:03,413 --> 00:09:04,638
Speaker 1: But what do you mean about how much you go?

153
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:05,401
Speaker 1: What if I make something?

154
00:09:05,442 --> 00:09:06,426
Speaker 0: how fast and how far?

155
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,290
Speaker 1: what if I make something?

156
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,668
Speaker 1: That weighs an ounce has a payload of another ounce and is super efficient.

157
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:12,109
Speaker 1: Does that win?

158
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,433
Speaker 0: How it has to go.

159
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,023
Speaker 0: as to carry, you know carry a lot.

160
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:17,585
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

161
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:18,929
Speaker 1: What's your metric for going?

162
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,144
Speaker 0: has to go.

163
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:22,692
Speaker 0: You're one.

164
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,457
Speaker 0: you're one like I have a grain of salt.

165
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,541
Speaker 0: It gets carried in the wind.

166
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:26,404
Speaker 0: It's like.

167
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:27,527
Speaker 1: that's super efficient.

168
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:32,622
Speaker 0: It's like It's not a. it's not a transportation mechanisms.

169
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:34,430
Speaker 1: You got any news here on this Monday gig nights.

170
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:43,763
Speaker 0: I mean we talked about this all the time, but I guess you know It's a. it's a battle that we've always been involved in and it's raging yet again.

171
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:45,870
Speaker 0: So we might as well continue to rage.

172
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:50,428
Speaker 0: I don't think we talked about it last time at two weeks ago.

173
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:56,710
Speaker 0: So Facebook has decided to start the next battle in the war on ad blocking.

174
00:09:57,993 --> 00:09:59,177
Speaker 1: Well, there was a there.

175
00:09:59,217 --> 00:10:02,650
Speaker 1: there were multiple salvos in rapid succession on this one, right?

176
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,434
Speaker 0: It seems like we're winning.

177
00:10:03,454 --> 00:10:05,968
Speaker 0: But anyway, so what Facebook was basically like, alright, here's what we're gonna do?

178
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:10,625
Speaker 0: We are going to stop ad blockers from blocking ads in your Facebook feed.

179
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:18,130
Speaker 0: So what they tried to do is Make ads in the Facebook feed look a lot like posts in the Facebook feed to confuse the ad blockers.

180
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,385
Speaker 0: So the ad blockers updated their shit like real quick Yep, and then Facebook shifted again, and I think the ad blockers shifted again.

181
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:35,136
Speaker 0: and the main reason that Facebook cannot win this battle is because at least in the United States, there's actually a law that's actually Surprisingly well enforced really?

182
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:35,678
Speaker 0: Yeah.

183
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,481
Speaker 1: What's this law?

184
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,745
Speaker 1: This is a twist on this.

185
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:38,888
Speaker 1: I didn't know about.

186
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:39,370
Speaker 0: I forgot.

187
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,225
Speaker 0: I forgot the name of it, but I'll get it for you.

188
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:41,446
Speaker 1: Sure.

189
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:41,870
Speaker 1: It's real.

190
00:10:42,202 --> 00:10:43,877
Speaker 0: Yes I read about it in like three places.

191
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:47,275
Speaker 0: when I because I it was like a week ago that I read because I got nothing On this.

192
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:47,883
Speaker 1: this is all you.

193
00:10:47,924 --> 00:10:48,370
Speaker 1: I got nothing.

194
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,342
Speaker 0: You can't just like have ads in the feed that don't say their ads.

195
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:54,610
Speaker 0: you can't just like put a post in there.

196
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:59,467
Speaker 0: So if there's like like it has to have the word like like.

197
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:04,268
Speaker 0: they're putting the word Sponsored there or like, you know, Google separates the ads from the listings.

198
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:09,307
Speaker 0: Yep It's like they can't not do that because at least the United States you'll get in trouble if you don't.

199
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,789
Speaker 0: if you do that Ah, it's so beautiful.

200
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:26,027
Speaker 0: Basically, it's like yeah as long as they have to make the ads not exactly a hundred percent identical to the not ads and as long We can find it's like you can write code just like if you see the word sponsored.

201
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,514
Speaker 1: block the whole thing Ah, but there's a second component to this.

202
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:37,562
Speaker 1: because Facebook has to work in a web browser as a web page and not a proprietary Application we can render it over the fuck we want.

203
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,854
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, we know that's that's the original news But the two things together.

204
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:47,020
Speaker 0: the other thing is that Facebook right the way that they tried to you know Make mix the ads in with the content.

205
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,049
Speaker 0: They didn't count on this.

206
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:56,988
Speaker 0: They did not count that the ad blocking people Would be willing to block content along with the ads.

207
00:11:57,169 --> 00:12:01,490
Speaker 0: now See, it's like the like the way they blocked some of the Facebook ads.

208
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:06,410
Speaker 0: They also ended up eliminating legit things from the feed with this blocking mechanism.

209
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,710
Speaker 1: I'm gonna back up and go to a completely different place in case and Facebook was like Facebook was like.

210
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,410
Speaker 0: Hey you ad blockers are ruining the people's feeds with their ad blocking and they're pretty much like we don't give a shit.

211
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,716
Speaker 0: We'd rather not see as low Who sells ads.

212
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:24,530
Speaker 1: look upon my field of fucks and see that it is barren.

213
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,397
Speaker 0: It's like I'd rather have.

214
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:27,752
Speaker 0: no I'd like if you if there was a way All right, like.

215
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:32,110
Speaker 0: it's like if I had to block half the tweets in my Twitter feeds in order to get rid of the ads.

216
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:33,760
Speaker 1: But I would good luck.

217
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:34,183
Speaker 1: Have fun.

218
00:12:34,304 --> 00:12:34,626
Speaker 1: Awesome.

219
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,129
Speaker 0: All right.

220
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,111
Speaker 1: Well to back up a bit remember the early in the earliest days of email spam wasn't a thing Like.

221
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,959
Speaker 1: I remember when I got spam.

222
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:46,842
Speaker 1: like a spam email came into my account at our IT Delete button and I saw it in Elm.

223
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,230
Speaker 1: I didn't push the delete button.

224
00:12:48,551 --> 00:12:54,968
Speaker 1: I forward it to the abuse at our IT dot edu and they would look into like blocking it.

225
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:59,583
Speaker 1: for me That is how different the internet was not that long ago.

226
00:12:59,603 --> 00:13:01,650
Speaker 0: I was telnet it into a server.

227
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,152
Speaker 0: You don't know.

228
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,898
Speaker 0: that was really long ago, by the way, uh 16 14 14 years ago.

229
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:09,397
Speaker 1: That's a long time ago Yeah, but it's also not that long ago.

230
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,485
Speaker 0: a kid who was born then be 14 right now.

231
00:13:11,745 --> 00:13:22,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, so In the when Gmail added spam blocking the earliest problem that was noticed was that a lot of you know A lot of spam blockers would block.

232
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:47,061
Speaker 1: you had two ways to go either Never get false positives But as a result a lot of spam got through or you'd tune it more and more and you'd risk missing an email you wanted To see but in return you block a higher percentage of the spam and what everyone realized very early in the email spam blocking wars Was that pretty much everyone would be willing to miss like 90% of their emails rather than see a single spam

233
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:47,563
Speaker 0: pretty much

234
00:13:48,306 --> 00:13:49,330
Speaker 1: and adds it the same way.

235
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:51,010
Speaker 1: I remember when I used to use host files.

236
00:13:51,312 --> 00:14:03,770
Speaker 1: There was an anime site I used to go to and one day they had this giant horrible animated banner ad over the whole site and I was like well and I added it to my host file and Then the entire site didn't render anymore.

237
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:09,553
Speaker 1: It was basically like just text on a white screen and I was like actually this is better I think.

238
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:10,939
Speaker 0: imagine this you got a TV show.

239
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:12,707
Speaker 0: The TV show is 20 minutes long.

240
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:14,910
Speaker 0: Yeah It's an episode of adventure time.

241
00:14:15,732 --> 00:14:27,147
Speaker 0: you can either watch this episode of adventure time and one commercial that is 60 seconds long or You can watch this episode of adventure time and miss one minute of the episode of adventure time.

242
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:35,890
Speaker 0: at that point I would choose the third option of I just pirate the adventure time entire saying if those are your only two choices You're probably missing the one minute of adventure time.

243
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,569
Speaker 0: You don't have to watch some like ad for something about the old VHS days.

244
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,290
Speaker 1: Remember as a kid my one of the chores of my family was someone had to be the manual ad block for the family.

245
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:46,929
Speaker 1: so Simpsons Cosby show all the stuff that we watch.

246
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:48,837
Speaker 1: Yeah, we watch The Cosby Show.

247
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:50,505
Speaker 0: We did not watch The Cosby Show.

248
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,330
Speaker 1: I watched a lot.

249
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,375
Speaker 1: We like we were like with.

250
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,426
Speaker 1: there were certain shows that we would watch as a family.

251
00:14:54,547 --> 00:14:56,272
Speaker 0: We watched The nanny.

252
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,278
Speaker 0: Whoa, and we watched.

253
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,385
Speaker 1: well, we didn't watch the nanny and we watched.

254
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:01,027
Speaker 1: I watched mr.

255
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,990
Speaker 1: Belvedere The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

256
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:09,603
Speaker 1: We watched both elf and we fucking watched small wonder.

257
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:17,310
Speaker 1: we did not watch small wonder small wonder But one of the chores the family was someone had to sit there and record the shows that we're all gonna watch.

258
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,515
Speaker 1: we never watched him live and they would pause the recording whenever the commercials came on and Unpause it.

259
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:28,345
Speaker 1: and because you know the person doing it It was like taking off the garbage like ah, I gotta block the ads this week mom.

260
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,550
Speaker 1: I don't wanna.

261
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:32,580
Speaker 1: So sometimes I'd miss like I wouldn't notice.

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,830
Speaker 1: the show came on and I'd miss like the first five minutes of the episode.

263
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,199
Speaker 1: No one complained about that.

264
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,030
Speaker 1: No one was sad about that.

265
00:15:40,311 --> 00:15:44,487
Speaker 1: We just missed part of the Simpsons because that's fine because no one wanted to see the ads.

266
00:15:44,888 --> 00:15:45,009
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

267
00:15:45,993 --> 00:15:51,582
Speaker 1: so in a tiny kind of side news the The newest Android 7.0 is coming out.

268
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:52,748
Speaker 1: You know what they're calling it.

269
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,659
Speaker 0: What letter are we on?

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,249
Speaker 0: and and Nutella?

271
00:15:57,031 --> 00:15:59,170
Speaker 0: Nugget, okay, that's the second choice.

272
00:15:59,431 --> 00:16:00,555
Speaker 1: I think Nutella is a trademark.

273
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:05,070
Speaker 0: that was that was actually my second guess cuz that was the only other end candy other than neko wafer.

274
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:08,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, neko wafer could have been good I think.

275
00:16:08,112 --> 00:16:11,242
Speaker 0: but I realized after I said what was the first thing.

276
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,570
Speaker 0: I said Nutella that is trademark as a trademark.

277
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:20,078
Speaker 0: But now it was also trademark and nougat is the only non trademark You know, yep, and there's the old.

278
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,001
Speaker 1: the news is pretty good.

279
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,747
Speaker 1: Like it's gonna go out to most Nexus devices.

280
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:33,510
Speaker 1: The only Sad thing about this update is that they're not pushing it to the Nexus 4 or 5. now You might say baram those show those phones are old as fuck and I would say yes, that is true.

281
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,176
Speaker 0: What about that?

282
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:35,044
Speaker 0: What was the tablet?

283
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:35,569
Speaker 0: the Nexus?

284
00:16:35,569 --> 00:16:42,790
Speaker 1: 7 like the first Nexus tablet It's not listed here is getting it but I don't know if it's not getting it because I have one.

285
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,035
Speaker 0: I actually got one super cheap.

286
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:44,939
Speaker 0: It was like 10 bucks.

287
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,590
Speaker 0: Oh, I use it just for the live wedge app.

288
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:53,330
Speaker 1: I was thinking about getting the smallest cheapest Android tablet at some point because I have that teleprompter.

289
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:59,530
Speaker 1: so I have the teleprompter and It works with a phone like you stick the phone in the bottom and it's teleprompter is tiny.

290
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,777
Speaker 1: When I got my tiny phone My tiny phone barely fits in there.

291
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,656
Speaker 0: Like it's a little too small actually because size it is And I'll tell you if the little tab little so.

292
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:13,916
Speaker 1: I kick-started a while ago and I even think about it the newer version of The teleprompter and it's way bigger.

293
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:17,450
Speaker 1: It literally my phone is literally too small to put in this teleprompter.

294
00:17:17,832 --> 00:17:18,939
Speaker 1: So I need a tiny tablet.

295
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,069
Speaker 1: I was last time you use the teleprompter I've practiced with it a bunch, but I haven't made any videos with it since the five nights of Fred because video.

296
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,184
Speaker 0: And now you're gonna buy a second teleprompter and you haven't used the first one

297
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:37,948
Speaker 1: because I use it once For one video and actually actually I've got a bunch of work work queued up and I'm probably gonna use it for that because it's Way easier to use a teleprompter for that kind of stuff.

298
00:17:38,832 --> 00:17:44,169
Speaker 1: Like me looking into a screen talking about with method to and you're gonna time stamps NTP.

299
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:48,459
Speaker 1: so The Nexus 5 is not getting it.

300
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,800
Speaker 1: but many people have pointed out that the Nexus 5 is 100% capable of running it like.

301
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,790
Speaker 1: there's literally no reason not to push it out there.

302
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,296
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can.

303
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,309
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can just do it.

304
00:17:57,792 --> 00:17:59,340
Speaker 1: I don't know, but you're not gonna get it automatically.

305
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:01,090
Speaker 1: you're gonna have to like fuck with it to make it happen.

306
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:02,843
Speaker 1: It's not just gonna come over the air.

307
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:05,057
Speaker 0: I mean, even though it's capable It's probably just a matter of.

308
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,530
Speaker 0: they could only have so much time to test on so many devices.

309
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,869
Speaker 0: They didn't go that far back and it's not worth it for them.

310
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:20,929
Speaker 1: You get is the turning point because I think it's gonna sell Nexus fives if they do it, right my phone The Sony Xperia z5c comp like compact is the best Android hardware in the world.

311
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,641
Speaker 1: bar None for a phone right now just for all those reasons.

312
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:24,846
Speaker 1: It is so powerful.

313
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:25,650
Speaker 1: Everything's great about it.

314
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,970
Speaker 1: The question will be will it get nougat or not?

315
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,993
Speaker 1: because if it gets It's worth it.

316
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:34,880
Speaker 0: So the joys of an iPhone.

317
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,603
Speaker 0: you're gonna get it.

318
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:37,650
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the joys of this.

319
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:41,167
Speaker 1: It's waterproof and the battery lasts like 50 hours.

320
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:43,897
Speaker 0: legit iPhone battery last a fucking long time.

321
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:45,384
Speaker 1: your iPhone battery ran out.

322
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,660
Speaker 0: when we were at Sandy Hooks I was running Strava like non.

323
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,510
Speaker 1: I was running Strava to Scott.

324
00:18:52,072 --> 00:18:53,985
Speaker 1: When we got home at the end of the day, I still had like 60% battery.

325
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,649
Speaker 0: I think I ran it on the boat though as my mistake.

326
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,907
Speaker 1: But you know as I said, I got this z5c partly because it's like androids.

327
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:04,509
Speaker 1: last gas.

328
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,913
Speaker 1: and If this phone gets seven then androids still a good Still in the running.

329
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:19,681
Speaker 1: or if they release a z6c that is just a better phone then in a two-year cycle I'll just upgrade my Android phone to the newest Sony every two years.

330
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:25,441
Speaker 1: if neither of those happens iPhone 7 SE but you bottles Android apps.

331
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,384
Speaker 0: We're gonna do an iPhone.

332
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:28,050
Speaker 1: Yeah Android that let's see.

333
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,455
Speaker 1: I bought dogcatcher.

334
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:30,278
Speaker 1: It's a podcatcher.

335
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,603
Speaker 1: I cost like a dollar or two.

336
00:19:31,844 --> 00:19:33,310
Speaker 0: The iPhone has one built-in you don't need.

337
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,636
Speaker 1: I bought a Carcassonne.

338
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,001
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I gotta buy that again.

339
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:36,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you do.

340
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:38,090
Speaker 1: I bought a super hexagon.

341
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,655
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't need to buy that again.

342
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:40,679
Speaker 1: I play that game out.

343
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:47,996
Speaker 1: I bought settlers not gonna re-buy that now, uh I Think I bought anything else.

344
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:48,739
Speaker 0: Okay.

345
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:49,342
Speaker 1: Yeah.

346
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:50,487
Speaker 1: Oh though.

347
00:19:50,949 --> 00:19:53,301
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I didn't get the YubiKey or NFC.

348
00:19:53,682 --> 00:20:00,267
Speaker 1: so I don't have to worry about that because Security keys with NFC do not work with iPhone because Apple just go fuck yourself.

349
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:00,910
Speaker 1: Apple doesn't care.

350
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:04,020
Speaker 0: Well, maybe one knows they got a new updates coming right away.

351
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:06,649
Speaker 0: Say they like to do everything after everyone else already does it?

352
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:20,514
Speaker 1: And the other news is interesting or at least vaguely interesting is that Skylake processors like it is still a golden age of if you have a bad old shitty or broken computer or like you're about To go to college.

353
00:20:20,896 --> 00:20:23,247
Speaker 1: It is like the time to buy a computer.

354
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:39,105
Speaker 1: Holy crap Like even if you don't need like the 1080 videos mostly Nvidia's fault yeah, but not just like processors have been plateaued for so long that you can get like the Fastest Intel i7 Skylake bullshit computer for like way under two grand.

355
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:39,446
Speaker 0: Yeah.

356
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:40,148
Speaker 0: I mean, that's what happens.

357
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:47,273
Speaker 0: like for example You know whenever a new thing comes out, not only is that new thing out, but the thing that is great But just now.

358
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:49,761
Speaker 0: one model old is now cheap for a thousand.

359
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,687
Speaker 0: nine eighties are going like all everyone's.

360
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:56,201
Speaker 0: getting nine eighties like 1080 is the loading up of nine eighties.

361
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,130
Speaker 1: a thousand dollars including a video card.

362
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,238
Speaker 1: You can buy a fucking supercomputer.

363
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,165
Speaker 1: if you're willing to spend two grand.

364
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:03,670
Speaker 1: you can buy a god.

365
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:21,135
Speaker 1: but What's interesting is that the next generation was originally I think it was gonna be like a 10 nanometer process like they were gonna go like fucking crazy, but instead Kaby Lake, which is the next chip is It's still 14 nanometers far as I can tell.

366
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:22,679
Speaker 1: like it's not it's not going.

367
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,627
Speaker 0: I was reading about the five nanometer process.

368
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:32,090
Speaker 0: Oh, so Here's the problem and they're discussing like what kind of gate they need to make to get this to work.

369
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:38,530
Speaker 0: So like they're like we're gonna use the all-around gate or we're gonna use like the like the F whatever it's called.

370
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:53,443
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna tell you kids a secret if you buy computers ever like you know about computers And you know enough about processors to go to Wikipedia and click on like Kaby Lake to see like what's coming next The problem is you're always gonna see the next one.

371
00:21:53,985 --> 00:21:59,330
Speaker 1: so I can see Kaby Lake Which isn't coming out really till like next year, but I can click on Canon Lake.

372
00:21:59,953 --> 00:22:07,101
Speaker 1: And if I look at Canon Lake, I'm like, ooh, yes, I can wait for Canon Lake But then I can see that ice lake is the successor to that.

373
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:12,739
Speaker 1: and if I click on ice lake I can be like Oh, that's some 10 nanometer bullshit.

374
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:15,407
Speaker 1: Ooh, but then I see that Tiger Lake is the success.

375
00:22:15,587 --> 00:22:16,610
Speaker 1: You'll never buy a computer.

376
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:19,519
Speaker 1: You will never buy a computer if you get on that road.

377
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:20,122
Speaker 1: Hmm.

378
00:22:20,503 --> 00:22:21,728
Speaker 1: You got to just buy a computer.

379
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:24,139
Speaker 0: or Is the thing that some people do?

380
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, they buy everything.

381
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,708
Speaker 1: true That happens.

382
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:30,204
Speaker 1: But in the very least you can look ahead and see.

383
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,899
Speaker 1: is the next Architecture going to do something that I care about like?

384
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,745
Speaker 1: is it worth waiting like kind of?

385
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,230
Speaker 1: could I use the computer?

386
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,390
Speaker 1: I've got for another year because if I can I can get the next-gen architecture.

387
00:22:41,551 --> 00:22:44,190
Speaker 0: I just use a thing until it's dead and then I get a new one.

388
00:22:44,331 --> 00:22:46,242
Speaker 0: I don't really pay too much attention like what's.

389
00:22:46,484 --> 00:22:50,030
Speaker 0: you know the timing is well I care about the only adjust my timing slightly.

390
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:51,870
Speaker 0: You know it's like if my shit's broke.

391
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,350
Speaker 0: I need a new one and if I see something new is coming out in like two months like all right.

392
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,730
Speaker 0: I wait two months, but if you get past that point where it's not broken yet.

393
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:02,242
Speaker 1: But it's like you have a choice.

394
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:08,007
Speaker 1: if you could upgrade now and get Significant benefits of grading or wait and get better benefits, right?

395
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:08,790
Speaker 0: Just how much am I gonna wait?

396
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,738
Speaker 0: We're gonna wait a whole year.

397
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:11,030
Speaker 0: It's like how broken is my shit?

398
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:11,512
Speaker 1: Like?

399
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:14,345
Speaker 1: I don't think I can wait for KP Lake cuz my computer.

400
00:23:14,807 --> 00:23:15,490
Speaker 1: I need a new computer.

401
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,958
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy the baddest ass guy.

402
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,144
Speaker 0: Peter looks like it's working to me.

403
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:23,209
Speaker 1: Uh Yeah, it is working But it's not fast enough anymore.

404
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:25,357
Speaker 0: Is there anything you did where it didn't?

405
00:23:25,518 --> 00:23:26,060
Speaker 0: didn't get the job?

406
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,950
Speaker 1: editing 4k video playing some modern games?

407
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,029
Speaker 1: copying large files from flashcards to the computer?

408
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:35,316
Speaker 1: Because I've used v2.

409
00:23:35,557 --> 00:23:37,984
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah USB 3 is computers so old.

410
00:23:38,144 --> 00:23:40,432
Speaker 0: there isn't a USB 3 PCI Express card You can get.

411
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:43,630
Speaker 1: I could but all my PCI slots are filled with shit and one of them doesn't work.

412
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,216
Speaker 0: How many devices do you have?

413
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:46,682
Speaker 1: his computer's all knife?

414
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:47,104
Speaker 0: I don't have.

415
00:23:47,124 --> 00:23:48,550
Speaker 0: like any PCI Express things.

416
00:23:48,691 --> 00:23:51,631
Speaker 1: I have one that's broken and There's.

417
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:53,296
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of problems my computer.

418
00:23:53,858 --> 00:24:00,041
Speaker 0: But anyway, the news another thing that rim broke on purpose to excuse buying a new No peed on his computer.

419
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:00,403
Speaker 0: I saw him.

420
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:06,273
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, the news is that Kaby Lake Intel's going big on.

421
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:18,370
Speaker 1: the thing that it does is that the built-in Intel video stuff like if you don't have a video card Can play overwatch on like pretty big settings like straight up and play 4k video like it's nothing.

422
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:28,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't really believe this because I'm sure I saw videos of like, you know, the old Intel You know video chips that they come in laptops and stuff and they would be like, oh, yeah These are totally great.

423
00:24:28,714 --> 00:24:45,564
Speaker 1: You can totally game with these and once you totally game with the Intel 7 stuff in my laptop and once you finally get one, they're garbage my laptop I think my my Lenovo 230 with a core i7 can place at 5. it can play overwatch Just with the settings down like it works.

424
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:45,887
Speaker 1: fine.

425
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:49,133
Speaker 1: Place rocket League Like a champ.

426
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:50,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

427
00:24:50,437 --> 00:24:51,118
Speaker 1: It's garbage.

428
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,924
Speaker 1: Okay, but it totally does.

429
00:24:53,465 --> 00:25:05,089
Speaker 1: but this this chipset Now would be that like I would before we were talking about how now might be the time to like upgrade your HTPC because it'll Last forever, especially as you can get the tiny 1080s and make a tiny computer.

430
00:25:05,851 --> 00:25:08,844
Speaker 1: You might be able to go even tinier if you can hold out till Kaby Lake.

431
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,439
Speaker 1: cuz if Kaby Lake holds up you can make A flat computer.

432
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can make a computer.

433
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:20,482
Speaker 1: That's just a tiny motherboard with a CPU in it Like an m.2 hard drive stuck into it and one RAM stick stuck into it.

434
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:21,465
Speaker 1: That's the whole computer.

435
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:28,029
Speaker 0: It'll play games it the sideways Laptop RAM basically a laptop without a screen with a bunch of USBs and HDMI.

436
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:33,010
Speaker 1: That's probably about the size of the 95 watt power supply from my laptop, right?

437
00:25:33,971 --> 00:25:35,380
Speaker 0: And just put that under your TV.

438
00:25:35,401 --> 00:25:39,560
Speaker 1: Yeah get less furniture If you're a computer like PC gaming enthusiast.

439
00:25:40,183 --> 00:25:41,970
Speaker 1: now is the time to be alive.

440
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:50,547
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

441
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:52,935
Speaker 1: so our friends Phil and Jay.

442
00:25:52,975 --> 00:25:55,739
Speaker 1: Phil sent me a link and he was like I have a thing of the day for you.

443
00:25:55,901 --> 00:26:00,966
Speaker 0: Well, in other words rim is so bad at finding things the day He can only get a good one when someone else better than him.

444
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:11,419
Speaker 1: of everyone who'd expressed an opinion and the old man chopping garlic versus funny overwatch video thing of the day 100% of those opinions said that my thing of the day about overwatch was funnier.

445
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:19,500
Speaker 0: I asked I asked all the people in a small town in Wyoming Who is gonna be president and all of them said it would be Donald Trump.

446
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's.

447
00:26:21,571 --> 00:26:23,160
Speaker 0: that is the equivalent of what you just said.

448
00:26:23,441 --> 00:26:28,020
Speaker 1: All right, does anyone think that Scott's old man chopping garlic was better than funny overwatch video?

449
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyone who isn't a 13 year old kid?

450
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:39,258
Speaker 1: anyway Whenever someone because a lot of people, you know, you know like Luke Crane with this thing where people like, you know You should do and he's like, you know you should do.

451
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:53,749
Speaker 1: So people always are like, you know What would be a good thing at the day and they send me stuff and it's usually stuff that either already was the thing of the day or that is like five to ten years old and they just found it recently, but this is Something special.

452
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,820
Speaker 1: so I get to set the stage.

453
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:58,631
Speaker 1: There's a YouTube channel and this YouTube channel is called.

454
00:26:58,651 --> 00:26:59,935
Speaker 1: I'm gonna zoom in on this.

455
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:01,600
Speaker 1: What is the YouTube channel actually called?

456
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:11,257
Speaker 1: so I think it's just called sitting and smiling and the guy live streams like every day or two a video.

457
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:24,540
Speaker 1: There's hundreds of them and Every one of these live streams is called sitting and smiling and then the number of the episode and it's him for about two hours Just sitting cross-legged with lighting smiling at the camera.

458
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,920
Speaker 0: So he's just like a meditating dude, but he videos himself meditating and that's it on you.

459
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,030
Speaker 1: There's a tiny chance like there's ways you could fake the live stream.

460
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,114
Speaker 0: Sure.

461
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,840
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could but these videos exist.

462
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:37,371
Speaker 0: But I mean plenty of people meditate two hours a day.

463
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:41,067
Speaker 0: So making a stream of it is not unrealistic Yeah, but he does it like he sits down.

464
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:44,020
Speaker 1: He just does it with a goofy smile sitting there two hours every day or so.

465
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:55,720
Speaker 0: in one of these videos Somebody post a comment that says like in one of the videos he stops smiley frowns for a second.

466
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:56,709
Speaker 0: Can you find it?

467
00:27:56,749 --> 00:27:57,294
Speaker 0: and you have.

468
00:27:57,516 --> 00:27:57,819
Speaker 0: you have like?

469
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,980
Speaker 0: 200 hours of video to look through and you're never gonna find it.

470
00:28:01,322 --> 00:28:03,639
Speaker 1: I'm gonna quote this thing that I'm looking at right here.

471
00:28:04,342 --> 00:28:09,220
Speaker 1: The episode of sitting and smiling features a very special guest about 2.5 hours in the webcast.

472
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,827
Speaker 0: At least they tell you when it is.

473
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:11,249
Speaker 0: That's nice.

474
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:12,052
Speaker 1: This is the guy.

475
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:18,020
Speaker 1: I hear someone come into the house Which is odd because only my housemate is at work and we aren't expecting anyone.

476
00:28:18,421 --> 00:28:21,330
Speaker 1: I realized I didn't check to see if the doors are locked before starting the webcast.

477
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:32,617
Speaker 1: I hear the person stealthily moving around the house Mm-hmm, and then I hear them stealthily climbing the stairs toward my room the door opens and then I hear an unfamiliar male voice Say hello.

478
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:42,929
Speaker 1: Then after presumably seeing me sitting still and smiling in front of a camera lit from beneath by a fluorescent bulb He promptly descends the stairs and exits the house.

479
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,860
Speaker 1: Okay, you can see this happen at two thirty six thirty.

480
00:28:48,462 --> 00:28:59,814
Speaker 1: So that is my thing of the day that the best guess is that a robber broke into this house And later on like yes Like the guy who's in for that robbery came in.

481
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:09,925
Speaker 1: because think about this you break into a house You think it's empty you're going around getting to rob stuff and then you come into a room and you see a dude Just sitting there smiling at a camera and not moving Silently with weird lighting.

482
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,892
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I would abscond.

483
00:29:12,514 --> 00:29:14,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the guy saw your face.

484
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,110
Speaker 0: So even if you steal stuff, oh, he doesn't see.

485
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,260
Speaker 1: I don't know if he cuz the guy just saw like the shadow.

486
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,184
Speaker 1: I think cuz.

487
00:29:19,445 --> 00:29:24,292
Speaker 1: in the video the guys like his eyes kind of like look to the side, but he doesn't turn his head He doesn't interrupt the smiling.

488
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:28,712
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Also props to the guy for like not interrupting the smiling.

489
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,926
Speaker 0: I mean like that's pro dude I mean, he's mad Zen.

490
00:29:31,946 --> 00:29:32,388
Speaker 0: That's his deal.

491
00:29:32,408 --> 00:29:32,790
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

492
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,795
Speaker 1: These videos have like 20,000 views each.

493
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:36,609
Speaker 0: Well, you know you can be.

494
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,900
Speaker 0: you can you can transfer his energies to you and shit.

495
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,516
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do a red super and I'm gonna watch one of his videos and live stream myself watching it at some point After packs, can you sit and smile for two hours?

496
00:29:45,556 --> 00:29:46,100
Speaker 0: I don't know.

497
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:46,763
Speaker 0: You know what?

498
00:29:46,783 --> 00:29:49,959
Speaker 0: I don't think you could even shut up for two hours unless you're sleeping.

499
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:57,588
Speaker 1: Why don't we do a smile off let alone like keeping your body still Got one to a live stream smile off.

500
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,015
Speaker 1: you and me both smile at the camera.

501
00:29:59,055 --> 00:30:00,060
Speaker 1: first one to go away loses.

502
00:30:00,383 --> 00:30:02,099
Speaker 0: Oh, you want a Zen Zen battle then off?

503
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,440
Speaker 1: I feel like I would bet money to the purposes of Zen.

504
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:10,937
Speaker 0: I would bet money's real pictures of presidents that are dead that I could beat you.

505
00:30:10,957 --> 00:30:11,780
Speaker 0: Why don't we?

506
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:17,217
Speaker 1: Why don't we both bet on ourselves, but let me bet on me, but let the listener.

507
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:19,926
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm gonna bet on me But let the listeners bet.

508
00:30:20,126 --> 00:30:21,973
Speaker 0: no, so it's basically you can't sleep.

509
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:23,518
Speaker 0: You have to stay awake.

510
00:30:23,538 --> 00:30:23,939
Speaker 0: You can blink.

511
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:28,209
Speaker 1: I guess You can retain a calm smile.

512
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,957
Speaker 0: you cannot go you have to smile not move a lot.

513
00:30:32,298 --> 00:30:32,900
Speaker 1: you can fidget.

514
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,100
Speaker 1: fidget.

515
00:30:33,201 --> 00:30:33,804
Speaker 1: He's okay Scott.

516
00:30:33,824 --> 00:30:35,554
Speaker 1: if we had to know it was not don't fidget off.

517
00:30:35,615 --> 00:30:36,520
Speaker 0: I mean does he not fidget?

518
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,802
Speaker 0: I can't fidget.

519
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:42,899
Speaker 0: I mean I didn't watch a lot of these meditate without sleeping and smile.

520
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,125
Speaker 0: Oh shit These are four hours long not to know and see how long you can go and the first person to know It's live stream.

521
00:30:49,145 --> 00:30:51,158
Speaker 0: So everyone's watching and they can tell who's the winner.

522
00:30:51,178 --> 00:30:52,951
Speaker 1: now I'm just thinking that Simpsons episode.

523
00:30:53,092 --> 00:30:54,040
Speaker 1: eat your broccoli.

524
00:30:54,743 --> 00:30:57,737
Speaker 0: We can actually have the listeners like vote who they think the winner is like because they'll be like.

525
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,544
Speaker 0: rim moved it You know one hour in.

526
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,800
Speaker 0: and then if only like five people say that rim moved an hour in but everyone else votes for.

527
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:06,227
Speaker 0: Scott moved it, you know 45 minutes.

528
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:06,648
Speaker 0: Yeah.

529
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, son.

530
00:31:08,353 --> 00:31:10,539
Speaker 1: You're definitely eating this broccoli now.

531
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:21,893
Speaker 0: So my thing today once it gets a really good thing today, but it's not your thing of the day It's my thing of the day Phil's thing of the day, dude You're going by my thing I think of the days are farks or something.

532
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,424
Speaker 0: Awfuls or Better than rims.

533
00:31:24,444 --> 00:31:24,826
Speaker 0: thing of the day.

534
00:31:24,846 --> 00:31:29,505
Speaker 0: cuz rims thing of the day was nothing because it was Phil's thing of the day he used And mine is actually great.

535
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:30,086
Speaker 0: Nonetheless.

536
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:32,253
Speaker 1: This is real great as I'm scrolling through this.

537
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,680
Speaker 0: So if you go to Disney World, didn't he world?

538
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,349
Speaker 0: There's Epcot where the big dome ball thing is.

539
00:31:38,389 --> 00:31:39,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, I fuck.

540
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:41,760
Speaker 1: I love Epcot way more than like every other part.

541
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,607
Speaker 0: It is an inside the ball thing.

542
00:31:43,627 --> 00:31:44,390
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's.

543
00:31:44,430 --> 00:32:07,600
Speaker 0: inside the ball is the thing called horizons, which is basically a remake of Tomorrowland from the World's Fair which is basically a ride where you get on a little car and it goes around real slow and you look at stuff and the things you look at our little animatronic life-size dioramas of like futuristic kitchens and you know futuristic farms and sort of like.

544
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:12,720
Speaker 0: You know totally kitsch what they thought the future is gonna be like in the 60s kind of stuff.

545
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:15,571
Speaker 0: Right, and it's totally awesome.

546
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:27,814
Speaker 0: these people Way back in the 90s, which is probably around the time that I went there They figured out how to get into this ride Not just into the ride like you wait in line and you ride it cuz you know what.

547
00:32:27,834 --> 00:32:29,000
Speaker 0: there's no line for this fucking thing.

548
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,994
Speaker 0: You could just yeah, you can just get on whenever you want.

549
00:32:32,014 --> 00:32:33,300
Speaker 0: You could ride it like five times in a row.

550
00:32:33,822 --> 00:32:35,490
Speaker 0: They figured out how to get behind the scenes.

551
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,360
Speaker 0: They figured out there were hidden rooms.

552
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:38,685
Speaker 0: There's like they were.

553
00:32:38,805 --> 00:32:44,629
Speaker 0: they would know like when the cars are coming so they could go chill in the diorama and then be Out before the next car came.

554
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:47,140
Speaker 0: people these photos are so great.

555
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:53,367
Speaker 0: They knew how to not get killed because it's very easy to die when there's this sort of Carousel machine going around.

556
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:56,060
Speaker 0: it could easily crush you right like a subway.

557
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,148
Speaker 0: They learn how to not get killed.

558
00:32:58,168 --> 00:32:58,449
Speaker 0: they were.

559
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,714
Speaker 0: they got partied back there.

560
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,124
Speaker 0: They got drunk back there They quote.

561
00:33:02,165 --> 00:33:04,876
Speaker 1: of course that kind of confidence can only give it away to a higher risk of danger.

562
00:33:04,957 --> 00:33:09,372
Speaker 1: one evening who'd haphazardly Stepped on a rotten piece of plywood and fractured his right foot.

563
00:33:09,452 --> 00:33:11,700
Speaker 1: another night chief cut his head wide open.

564
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:16,597
Speaker 1: The danger they put themselves into was actually far higher than either of them realized at the time.

565
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:17,480
Speaker 0: It's very dangerous.

566
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,497
Speaker 0: It's like this big machine basically and you're going to easily have their arm or leg completely severed by the heavy machinery.

567
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:27,444
Speaker 0: Yes easily But I guess that didn't happen.

568
00:33:27,865 --> 00:33:29,550
Speaker 1: they risked life and limb.

569
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:33,220
Speaker 1: to make sure horizons were you remembered and now it has been.

570
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:39,857
Speaker 0: so yeah, um The thing I wonder about this is how did they get into Disney World so often?

571
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:40,640
Speaker 0: were they buying tickets?

572
00:33:40,721 --> 00:33:42,494
Speaker 0: They have like year-round passes or something like.

573
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:43,360
Speaker 1: maybe I guess season pass.

574
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,758
Speaker 1: I mean when I was a kid Cedar Point like they went to town.

575
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:48,500
Speaker 0: well I mean you get Disney World doesn't close so you can go there year-round.

576
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,851
Speaker 0: It's in Florida, but they it's like they worked in Florida somewhere and after work every day They went to Disney World with their annual pass.

577
00:33:55,891 --> 00:33:57,198
Speaker 0: It's like how often did they go there?

578
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:57,499
Speaker 0: like what?

579
00:33:58,481 --> 00:33:59,205
Speaker 0: What kind of life?

580
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,331
Speaker 1: an annual pass?

581
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:03,345
Speaker 1: I'm looking up right now For fuck.

582
00:34:03,365 --> 00:34:07,445
Speaker 1: so wow it's way cheaper than I realized You got to live in Disney World.

583
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:17,699
Speaker 1: an annual pass to go to fucking anything anytime you want forever with no blackout dates Except for it doesn't get you into special event things that need like their own.

584
00:34:18,283 --> 00:34:20,320
Speaker 0: Like you can't go to like a character breakfast with that shit.

585
00:34:20,501 --> 00:34:24,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to make a reservation for that separately, but you can just ride Space Mountain all day every day.

586
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,684
Speaker 0: $829 that's it.

587
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:28,150
Speaker 0: That's about right dude.

588
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,103
Speaker 1: a season pass to Cedar Point when I was a kid was like 200.

589
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:34,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right cool Cuz no one can fucking use that.

590
00:34:35,456 --> 00:34:44,620
Speaker 1: in the moment We're gonna be live at PAX West which is coming up real soon soon Saturday September 3rd 5 p.m.. Chicken theater the grind.

591
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:57,738
Speaker 1: It's very funny that I tweeted about it And then literally the next tweet in my feed immediately was this article that was like now's the time to love to power Level up all your wow characters.

592
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,148
Speaker 1: It was like a Kotaku article.

593
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:01,976
Speaker 0: I think another wow expansion is coming.

594
00:35:02,097 --> 00:35:03,684
Speaker 0: yeah I don't know why.

595
00:35:03,925 --> 00:35:04,969
Speaker 0: and then independently

596
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:30,000
Speaker 1: because of that a whole bunch of people in my feed We're all tweeting about like enjoying grinding someone who I won't name in our forum and someone else I won't name on Twitter both today express their love of going like back into old content and MMOs and Grinding the shit out of it and someone else the third person was complaining that a lot of modern MMOs don't have as much grind as the old one, so I feel like our panel aptly timed.

597
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:32,683
Speaker 1: So you got anything?

598
00:35:32,703 --> 00:35:34,108
Speaker 1: What other meta stuff do we got?

599
00:35:35,693 --> 00:35:37,078
Speaker 1: The book club book is Rebecca.

600
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:45,011
Speaker 1: There is another book club book Orcs and Crake that we already did a show on.

601
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,680
Speaker 1: there is a third book club.

602
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,764
Speaker 1: It's a new book club.

603
00:35:47,824 --> 00:35:55,500
Speaker 1: Scott's not involved because he hates this stuff, and he doesn't want to learn anything, but me Kremlian, Andrew, Ro, Kate, a few other people.

604
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,549
Speaker 1: We're starting a separate book club.

605
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:07,040
Speaker 1: That's basically an international politics Salon we're gonna do is we're gonna pick a nonfiction book every month or two or an article like a long-form article.

606
00:36:07,361 --> 00:36:12,319
Speaker 1: We're all gonna read it, and then we're gonna argue about the topic that was discussed by the article.

607
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:19,380
Speaker 1: We're all gonna do our own independent research beyond because you know the article might be wrong the book might be biased whatever.

608
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:27,660
Speaker 1: But the point is we're going to learn about and research a very narrow and specific Like real-world topic and then argue about it on the show for an hour.

609
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,650
Speaker 1: And then I have a forum thread just like the book club.

610
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:30,756
Speaker 0: Don't waste your time with this kid.

611
00:36:30,796 --> 00:36:37,340
Speaker 1: so the first book We're doing is a relatively recent history book by Richard Evans called the coming of the Third Reich.

612
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, just so you need to know about.

613
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:43,609
Speaker 1: but this one is not the typical History channel cries rise of the Nazi Party.

614
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:51,031
Speaker 1: This is more a history of the Weimar Republic and like the situation in the pan-german areas that led to all this.

615
00:36:51,573 --> 00:36:52,877
Speaker 1: and I've read about two-thirds of it.

616
00:36:53,298 --> 00:37:14,919
Speaker 1: and this is Fascinating because while I know a lot about the era before World War one, and I know a lot about like 1939 through 1945 I didn't know a lot about the Weimar Republic and this shit is Fascinating mm-hmm and this book is one of the few that is Popping off to where like I can read it without like having to do a lot of research.

617
00:37:15,961 --> 00:37:20,036
Speaker 1: Also Scott who's complaining so much about everyone wasting their time and not bettering themselves.

618
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,260
Speaker 1: Why are you reading all this fiction?

619
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,519
Speaker 1: Why do you care about this Rebecca book?

620
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,424
Speaker 1: All right, all right anti intellectual Scott What else we got?

621
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:44,690
Speaker 1: our video Atari game design is up on YouTube for your enjoyment If you're a backer of the patreon, there is one more slot in the eight player play by mail Civ 5 Extreme game that I'm gonna be playing with you guys.

622
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,594
Speaker 0: No one's filling that slot.

623
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:46,980
Speaker 1: one spot remains.

624
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:56,300
Speaker 1: well, I just opened it up to the regular patrons like Yesterday and most of the people in the game are these super patrons give a dollar take the slot and then stop giving the dollar.

625
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:57,845
Speaker 0: Go join the game.

626
00:37:57,905 --> 00:38:02,221
Speaker 0: the game will be locked in sure and then rim won't even get your $1.

627
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:06,957
Speaker 1: I'm totally happy for that cuz frankly a lot of people are giving away more money than they need to.

628
00:38:07,278 --> 00:38:17,624
Speaker 1: to be honest I was kind of hoping that every listener would just give a dollar but instead there's like a few hundred of you Some of you are giving way more than a dollar Has lots of money.

629
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:19,210
Speaker 0: you probably don't what the fuck is wrong with you.

630
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:20,815
Speaker 1: that money has not been spent.

631
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:32,580
Speaker 1: all that money and Believe me you will know about every penny that I spend and that money is only gonna be yeah I'm gonna flaunt it in pictures of like selfies of me with expensive shit luxury brands.

632
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,865
Speaker 0: This is why I am.

633
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,593
Speaker 1: none of that money is going to Scott.

634
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,648
Speaker 0: if the money goes to see me in my bed It'll be because I bought equipment that Scott will use.

635
00:38:39,668 --> 00:38:45,864
Speaker 1: and Scott has already tried to convince me to buy a like a camera for him yeah, and He could not convince me.

636
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:52,549
Speaker 1: that would be used for a geek night's patron or listener project photos of all the patrons everyone.

637
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:55,032
Speaker 1: actually That would be a cool project.

638
00:38:55,052 --> 00:39:00,677
Speaker 0: if we traveled to All the pen and I'll write dumb dumb head on the photo and put it on the internet where everyone can see.

639
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:08,997
Speaker 1: if we use The money to over the course of a year like I've all the plays Live take like one good portrait of every one of them and then make a collection.

640
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:09,980
Speaker 1: that would actually be a cool thing.

641
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:11,607
Speaker 1: I'd be willing to spend the money on that.

642
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,515
Speaker 1: that would cost way more than the money.

643
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:14,398
Speaker 1: We've collected so far.

644
00:39:15,428 --> 00:39:16,015
Speaker 0: Give more money.

645
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:16,400
Speaker 0: What's wrong?

646
00:39:19,002 --> 00:39:19,403
Speaker 0: The reason it

647
00:39:19,424 --> 00:39:30,665
Speaker 1: would cost so much is that a not small number of the patrons are Australians who really wants to come back to Paxos and I don't know if it's gonna happen this year because I have a work conference In Australia,

648
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:32,172
Speaker 0: we'll go to Monaco for the Grand Prix.

649
00:39:32,192 --> 00:39:33,217
Speaker 0: That's halfway to Australia.

650
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,717
Speaker 1: I go to Singapore every year for f1.

651
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,950
Speaker 0: I'm not saying go to Monaco though.

652
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,659
Speaker 1: You want to come with me next year to Singapore and see f1?

653
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:41,904
Speaker 0: No, I got Monica.

654
00:39:42,266 --> 00:39:44,579
Speaker 1: Singapore is way cheaper to get into f1 the Monaco.

655
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,500
Speaker 0: But why would I want to go to Singapore?

656
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:48,740
Speaker 1: Singapore is cool.

657
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:51,480
Speaker 1: We can spend like a week in Singapore doing the f1 shit.

658
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:55,753
Speaker 1: Monaco has a prince and then we can just go to Hong Kong and those principality.

659
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:56,536
Speaker 0: What's Singapore?

660
00:39:56,556 --> 00:39:57,278
Speaker 0: a city-state?

661
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,367
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's got city states.

662
00:39:59,408 --> 00:40:00,533
Speaker 1: give you all this happiness.

663
00:40:00,553 --> 00:40:01,799
Speaker 1: you get luxury goods out of them.

664
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:05,680
Speaker 0: The Principality is a luxury good.

665
00:40:10,382 --> 00:40:12,058
Speaker 1: Also, Scott is doing a YouTube show.

666
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:16,960
Speaker 0: I'm doing a lot of YouTube shows, but only one of them requires no effort.

667
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:21,339
Speaker 0: So if you go to my youtube channel, you'll get stuff that doesn't cost you any money.

668
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,070
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good show all the time.

669
00:40:24,492 --> 00:40:25,657
Speaker 1: It's basically lunch with Scott.

670
00:40:25,738 --> 00:40:26,200
Speaker 0: I watch it.

671
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,131
Speaker 0: Well, everything's gonna be with Scott because I started with netrunner with Scott.

672
00:40:29,151 --> 00:40:31,440
Speaker 0: So it's gonna be asterisk with Scott.

673
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:34,452
Speaker 0: So everything else I do is also gonna be something with Scott.

674
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,500
Speaker 0: but lunch is almost every day.

675
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,140
Speaker 1: Well, you guys saw to remember we were doing rim versus Scott.

676
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,492
Speaker 1: That's the one where Scott and I were playing these duels of said five.

677
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,140
Speaker 1: It's not gonna just be said five.

678
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,464
Speaker 1: We're gonna do like everything.

679
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:46,291
Speaker 1: that's just us fighting with each other.

680
00:40:46,431 --> 00:40:47,515
Speaker 0: You decided that I didn't.

681
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:48,779
Speaker 1: I did just decide that.

682
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:52,904
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, and I'm gonna try to keep doing it Resist doing it.

683
00:40:53,648 --> 00:40:55,657
Speaker 1: All right, take that not a patreon thing.

684
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:56,420
Speaker 1: It's just on YouTube.

685
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:58,088
Speaker 0: Well, that's your video right there.

686
00:40:58,149 --> 00:41:00,259
Speaker 0: rim for Scott gets Scott to do a video Scott wins.

687
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:04,800
Speaker 1: Do you want an argument?

688
00:41:07,201 --> 00:41:07,965
Speaker 0: This is an argument.

689
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,760
Speaker 1: All right, so, uh, we got tickets to a thing.

690
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,951
Speaker 1: Well Scott saw this thing.

691
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:12,739
Speaker 1: we got tickets to it.

692
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:17,180
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna read you the title of what the thing is and that's the reason why we're not gonna do a main bit.

693
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:25,697
Speaker 1: We are going to right now the Queen's Dinner Club colon Mothership meat company, right?

694
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:27,834
Speaker 0: Well the There's a barbecue place.

695
00:41:27,894 --> 00:41:28,380
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

696
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,520
Speaker 0: That's near here and the guy who owns that opened up a new barbecue place that is an even bigger cooker.

697
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:34,639
Speaker 0: So he doesn't run out of food like he does the other place.

698
00:41:35,202 --> 00:41:36,526
Speaker 0: But it's a different style of barbecue.

699
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:40,360
Speaker 0: It's Texas style, which I actually prefer and it's not open yet.

700
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:42,410
Speaker 0: But how are we eating there?

701
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:44,360
Speaker 0: Because if you buy tickets, there's like a preview night.

702
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:49,340
Speaker 0: I guess he wants to fit, you know, see if his foods any good and it's like four blocks away from this apartment.

703
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:55,900
Speaker 0: So we're gonna walk over there and eat barbecue all that cornbread and it's gonna have the same amazing cornbread from the other place.

704
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,889
Speaker 0: So all right, I just want to eat.

705
00:41:57,909 --> 00:41:58,774
Speaker 0: I'll just get back dude.

706
00:41:58,894 --> 00:41:59,356
Speaker 0: Keep your meats.

707
00:41:59,397 --> 00:42:00,080
Speaker 0: I want three cornbreads.

708
