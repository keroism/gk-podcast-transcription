1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,886
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 14th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,171
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,440
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nides.

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,800
Speaker 0: Eventually we get to talking a bit about Scott's new iPhone.

5
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:26,908
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,893 --> 00:00:32,436
Speaker 0: So for the past week at work.

7
00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:36,970
Speaker 0: I've been confronted with a somewhat difficult and amusing problem.

8
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,524
Speaker 1: How difficult and amusing could it be?

9
00:00:39,585 --> 00:00:40,450
Speaker 1: I'm not laughing yet.

10
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:45,745
Speaker 0: I'd complained a while ago about how I was having trouble with time synchronization in like this.

11
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:48,995
Speaker 1: like all you do is set clocks Professional clock setter.

12
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,802
Speaker 1: you get paid that much money to set clocks.

13
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:53,150
Speaker 0: actually there is a lot more to my job.

14
00:00:53,271 --> 00:01:00,669
Speaker 0: But because I built the entire NTP infrastructure I also maintain it and improve it, but does it really have to be maintained or prove that?

15
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:06,466
Speaker 1: often I mean NTP is kind of this kind of thing where you set it up And you just leave it be for months and months and months for one.

16
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:16,068
Speaker 0: the only maintenance I do at all is what I have a report that gets generated that I wrote a script that does this periodically that figures out What NIST time servers stopped responding.

17
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:19,740
Speaker 0: because you know this changes their time servers up every now and then and a lot of times.

18
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,472
Speaker 0: Some this time servers just won't freakin work like.

19
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:24,837
Speaker 0: they'll just be broken for a month or so Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,665
Speaker 0: So I got to keep track of that to make sure that all the different time servers like the core time servers at least have Four or five NIST or isn't?

21
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:35,317
Speaker 1: isn't there a server you can use that does a DNS round-robin see?

22
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:37,241
Speaker 1: you never have to worry That?

23
00:01:37,282 --> 00:01:39,529
Speaker 0: that would be completely beside the point.

24
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,994
Speaker 0: It would actually break NTP.

25
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:41,676
Speaker 1: why?

26
00:01:41,696 --> 00:01:49,833
Speaker 0: for reasons I don't want to get into no But what you do is you point the server at like five or six NIST servers And I point them to DNS names the issues.

27
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,060
Speaker 0: just sometimes the servers go down.

28
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,157
Speaker 0: So I have a report that figures that out, and then I change them accordingly.

29
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:56,363
Speaker 0: That's the only Manual intervention.

30
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:01,940
Speaker 0: the system is otherwise run without a hitch and without a single point of intervention for me since I built it.

31
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,040
Speaker 1: So why is it?

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:13,336
Speaker 0: Okay, well the issue is like I said we want to have a lot of virtual servers now for like you know QA Testing all the nine kinds of things where we don't need a full-on server, but we don't.

33
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:17,500
Speaker 0: we want this kind of Virtualized environment around the VMware and all these other solutions.

34
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,117
Speaker 0: But as I discovered fully for basically you cannot have accurate time in a fully virtualized machine.

35
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,199
Speaker 0: It is just impossible.

36
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:30,858
Speaker 0: and What bothers me is that all the people who make virtual solutions are pretty upfront about that?

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,925
Speaker 0: Except VMware.

38
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,255
Speaker 0: they they dance around that issue.

39
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:48,494
Speaker 0: They say oh, yeah, it works Just fine just install VMware tools, and I've talked to a lot of their engineers And I've got escalated things all over the place and the end result is and if anyone wants to challenge me on this I'm willing to back it up.

40
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,676
Speaker 1: VMware can't do accurate time for shit alright, so you did a whole episode on this before.

41
00:02:53,736 --> 00:03:00,717
Speaker 0: where's the new bits, so We're using Zen now, which does our para virtualization, and it's working real well perfect time.

42
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:01,580
Speaker 1: Zen's pretty good.

43
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,999
Speaker 1: There's one thing that's a little bit newer better Maybe than Zen, but Zen is where it's at right now.

44
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:14,480
Speaker 0: well Zen is awesome partly because it's the way redheads doing it now is with these kind of Standardized wrappers around it, so I don't need to learn Zen.

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:24,845
Speaker 0: I only need to know these red hat standardized things that it works really really well, but We the issue I had was that in order to decide for sure you know well Are we gonna do VMware?

46
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:27,838
Speaker 0: we're gonna do this like what is our rationale for our business decisions?

47
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:28,240
Speaker 0: and also?

48
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,480
Speaker 0: What are we going to tell VMware and see if we can kind of weasel a discount out of them on their bad time?

49
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,043
Speaker 0: System.

50
00:03:34,786 --> 00:03:36,294
Speaker 0: so I wasn't just.

51
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,400
Speaker 0: oh, I know the time is bad.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,999
Speaker 0: I was asked to provide a statistically verifiable measure of how bad the time was.

53
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:47,220
Speaker 0: now Riddle me this how do you tell how does a server?

54
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,179
Speaker 0: In and of itself know if its own time is bad if it can't trust its own hardware clock?

55
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:59,899
Speaker 0: It can't yes, so I was tasked with coming up with clever ways around this.

56
00:04:00,301 --> 00:04:00,723
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

57
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:02,069
Speaker 1: you can't.

58
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,755
Speaker 1: unless you have some source of correct time You don't know if your time is correct.

59
00:04:06,816 --> 00:04:10,311
Speaker 0: I mean first I wrote a script right on a server.

60
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 1: time was correct at some other time.

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,255
Speaker 0: Then no no there's plenty of ways to do this all right.

62
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:16,577
Speaker 1: so

63
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:34,066
Speaker 0: first I wrote a clever script that ran on a server that knew the time and what it would do is Query the other server ask it what it thought the time was and made this nice sort of graph of how off the time got And that worked okay, but I ran into some like Asymmetric latency issues on the network.

64
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:46,635
Speaker 0: so all I did was I turned off all the BS and all the kind of clock catch-up Mechanisms and I just ran NTP tinker mode zero and I got these nice graphs And I figured out exactly how off the time we got.

65
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:49,508
Speaker 0: I figured out What was causing the time to get off.

66
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:52,620
Speaker 0: I figured out like what sorts of things made the time fall behind more or less?

67
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:58,720
Speaker 0: And I pretty much proved exactly like the differences between all the different systems, and that was fine.

68
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:00,867
Speaker 0: and then I was told all right.

69
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:04,179
Speaker 0: the last thing we need to do is figure out how bad it is on Windows.

70
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,975
Speaker 0: and Good God is it not easy to deal with Windows in time because Windows servers.

71
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:10,596
Speaker 0: Just don't care.

72
00:05:10,637 --> 00:05:11,339
Speaker 0: What time it is.

73
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,040
Speaker 1: No, I mean you know what does Windows give a shit?

74
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:24,754
Speaker 0: Well it does for Kerberos, but the little-known secret is that while Kerberos requires accurate clocks Most Windows domains will pretty much just all the hosts.

75
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:32,000
Speaker 0: if the time is off We'll just kind of synchronize the time to the person they're trying to authenticate to and then authenticate.

76
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz it's all about doing something.

77
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:35,200
Speaker 1: that gets the job done.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,080
Speaker 1: And you know if you're someone who just wants to log in then that gets the job done.

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,869
Speaker 1: It logs you in and that's all they care about.

80
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:44,843
Speaker 0: so I finally figured out how to actually Deal with.

81
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:49,138
Speaker 0: you know you can run NTP on a Windows box, but there are some issues with that.

82
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:57,500
Speaker 0: so instead I figured out how to actually configure W32 time - you can actually tell that to point at an NTP server.

83
00:05:57,581 --> 00:06:00,180
Speaker 0: And there's all these crazy internal options in the registry.

84
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:11,929
Speaker 0: So I figured all that out and I set all that up, and then I discovered the joy of Windows debugging and I enabled all 116 log levels of W32 time.

85
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:15,639
Speaker 0: and let me tell you there's some cryptic bullshit in there.

86
00:06:17,198 --> 00:06:26,146
Speaker 0: But Basically if anyone is interested all I discovered was that if you run a Windows box in Zen It's fully virtualized.

87
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,420
Speaker 0: There's no such thing as paravirtualized windows in these sorts of situations.

88
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,203
Speaker 1: Well they have that.

89
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:32,392
Speaker 1: Microsoft has the new thing that what's it called?

90
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:33,978
Speaker 1: I forget, but it's it's a new thing.

91
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,168
Speaker 0: yes But that's separate.

92
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:40,579
Speaker 0: like if you're using Zen or VMware You can't have a paravirtualized system because you need access to the kernel.

93
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:42,444
Speaker 0: you need Linux only.

94
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:44,970
Speaker 0: well now you can run a Windows really just fine.

95
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,940
Speaker 0: the thing is it fully virtualizes it and under the covers.

96
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:56,778
Speaker 0: I actually like it a lot more than VMware, but It kept the time a little bit better than VMware in Windows, but it was still shit.

97
00:06:57,805 --> 00:07:02,248
Speaker 0: So there's pretty much unless you use the Windows thing There's no way to keep accurate time at a Windows virtual machine.

98
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:22,430
Speaker 0: and after all this research my kind of here's the part you might My professional opinion this I have to clarify that this has I say nothing about the company VMware It's future or anything like that because there's a lot in the works for VMware besides this specific thing, but VMware is kind of crap.

99
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,265
Speaker 0: for server virtualization if you care about performance It's great.

100
00:07:26,305 --> 00:07:38,180
Speaker 0: for desktop virtualization if you're like a developer And you need a bunch of just you know images to test your web stuff on it's great, but for running a server It's kind of ass and I think Zen is a lot better.

101
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:46,769
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing is is that it's very few people who are running you know VMware that actually need performance.

102
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,152
Speaker 0: no are you kidding?

103
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,536
Speaker 1: or exact time?

104
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:50,860
Speaker 1: are you like that?

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,319
Speaker 0: You know how many giant corporations use?

106
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,336
Speaker 0: Gigantic VMware clusters to host all their servers?

107
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:03,859
Speaker 1: virtually yeah But those servers are like a web server, or you know something like that where VMware is just fine one?

108
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:11,920
Speaker 0: It's not and a lot of these people run into a lot of problems But they don't realize that the VMware time is what's causing the problems like what kind of problem?

109
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,520
Speaker 1: What's wrong with running of just a normal web server in a VMware?

110
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,920
Speaker 0: It depends on exactly how you've got got it set up, and I couldn't go into all the different possibilities.

111
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,760
Speaker 0: But depending on how the time is jumping and what's going on your logs might get out of sync or like web servers.

112
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,411
Speaker 0: They'll just crash because the like requests coming in are weird.

113
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,639
Speaker 0: if you're running an SSH or something it just won't work.

114
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:47,700
Speaker 0: The thing is most people just care about does the web page get served and it's pretty much gonna get sir actually No, a lot of people are using virtual servers for much more intensive things and there are ways to make these VMware's work better.

115
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,832
Speaker 0: But there's semi undocumented and kind of fiddly.

116
00:08:50,853 --> 00:09:05,675
Speaker 0: but beyond that I've been you know I've used kind of all the VM all that VMware has to offer all their sort of Management systems and the hypervisor stuff and how to like do it and the good enterprise workflows And it doesn't really work so well.

117
00:09:05,736 --> 00:09:09,191
Speaker 0: and under the covers It's kind of counterintuitive and crap and it's fiddly.

118
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:21,630
Speaker 0: and I got to say with Zen there's an image file or an image partition and one configuration file that is totally straightforward and Everything just works and it works so much better than VMware.

119
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:26,740
Speaker 0: so my professional recommendation if you're out there Do you need to use some sort of virtualization?

120
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,710
Speaker 0: You're probably better off with Zen or user mode Linux.

121
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:32,460
Speaker 1: well user mode Linux is sort of old and slow also.

122
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:45,293
Speaker 1: I mean our hosting that we use for you know our stuff our personal stuff is Switching from user mode Linux to Zen because that's mostly because all that what Zen has over virtual or up User mode is just that there's better management tools.

123
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:50,829
Speaker 0: basically yeah, oh Anyway, that's what I spent my day doing great.

124
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:52,716
Speaker 1: I don't know.

125
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,740
Speaker 1: do I have anything to say?

126
00:09:54,664 --> 00:09:56,712
Speaker 1: Not really, let's get some news action going on.

127
00:09:56,752 --> 00:09:58,520
Speaker 0: so I don't feel like you're getting enough sleep lately.

128
00:09:58,721 --> 00:09:59,847
Speaker 1: How am I not getting enough sleep?

129
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,108
Speaker 0: I don't know.

130
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,556
Speaker 0: you've been cranky for the last few days.

131
00:10:01,616 --> 00:10:02,280
Speaker 1: How am I cranky?

132
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,266
Speaker 0: I don't know just any.

133
00:10:03,528 --> 00:10:04,999
Speaker 0: yo you poo-poo everything you're kind of.

134
00:10:09,162 --> 00:10:09,483
Speaker 1: I don't know.

135
00:10:09,503 --> 00:10:12,634
Speaker 1: I don't do anything different, and then just you know like every couple weeks.

136
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:19,422
Speaker 1: You'll be like hey Scott You're all cranky, and then the next week you won't say anything and then the week after that you might be cranky Next week.

137
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:20,205
Speaker 0: you weren't cranky.

138
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:21,690
Speaker 1: whatever it's like this week.

139
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,894
Speaker 0: You're cranky, but two weeks ago.

140
00:10:22,934 --> 00:10:23,456
Speaker 1: Not cranky.

141
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:25,283
Speaker 1: You know you're all pointing out I'm cranky.

142
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,757
Speaker 0: Yes, I am at least I admit it.

143
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,804
Speaker 1: I'm not Denny.

144
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:32,414
Speaker 1: I don't have any weirdness going on all right.

145
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:35,671
Speaker 1: Yes, the only weirdness I have going on is being pestered by you.

146
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,040
Speaker 1: I guess you're not huffing.

147
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, not not.

148
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:44,120
Speaker 1: not with the huffing okay, and I'm puffing though definitely, okay.

149
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:56,259
Speaker 1: So I'm a huffer Jerry not a puffer, but I'm a huffer Alright, so today was like the e3 which I thought the e3 was dead, and I know it's my what.

150
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,704
Speaker 0: it wasn't Clearly not dead.

151
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:01,720
Speaker 0: it turned into this kind of exclusive thing that only the press cared about in the industry.

152
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,205
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still.

153
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,578
Speaker 1: it's not the big extravaganza used to be it's much more subdued.

154
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:09,511
Speaker 1: yet It you know it seems to be a little bigger than this.

155
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:11,200
Speaker 1: one seems to be a little bigger than the last one.

156
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:21,839
Speaker 1: There's more action more announcements that are significant you know and it really does seem like all the stuff that the professionals didn't want was offloaded to packs and such.

157
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,720
Speaker 1: so I Today they announced among other things not going to talk about the non gaming related.

158
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:46,580
Speaker 1: I'm not going to talk about the gaming related ones because it's not Tuesday But Microsoft announced that the Xbox is basically going to be able to do everything the Roku does If you have the you know live gold which if you have an Xbox You have the live gold because otherwise what's the point really?

159
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:57,965
Speaker 1: so this is pretty interesting now, I think because Suddenly people who buy Xboxes might be encouraged to subscribe to the Netflix If they haven't already.

160
00:11:58,266 --> 00:12:04,646
Speaker 1: if they haven't already which I think a lot of people have and people with the Netflix's might go get Xboxes instead of Roku's.

161
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:05,871
Speaker 1: you know it's sort of like that old.

162
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,160
Speaker 1: because think about this right the ps2.

163
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:18,607
Speaker 1: Really in the United States the reason that the ps2 took off crazily was because it came out at a time When DVD had already won.

164
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,473
Speaker 1: people knew DVD was the winner.

165
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:21,898
Speaker 1: it was the next best thing.

166
00:12:21,938 --> 00:12:26,719
Speaker 1: it was set But the DVD player hadn't covered the market.

167
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,880
Speaker 1: yet There are a lot of people who needed DVD players and wanted DVD players.

168
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,274
Speaker 1: They didn't have them yet, and they were expensive.

169
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,625
Speaker 0: not only were they expensive But there weren't like.

170
00:12:36,805 --> 00:12:38,190
Speaker 0: there weren't even like knockoff brands.

171
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,305
Speaker 0: yet like the only ones that were out there were the kind of like Sony Super-expensive.

172
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,108
Speaker 0: check out my DVD.

173
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:44,955
Speaker 1: It's sort of like HD DVD players are.

174
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,110
Speaker 1: now there aren't $60 Players either.

175
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,559
Speaker 1: I mean blu-ray players.

176
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,888
Speaker 1: This is only expensive ones right?

177
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:56,720
Speaker 1: so DVD was like that and the ps2 came onto the scene And it was like two or three hundred bucks.

178
00:12:57,081 --> 00:13:00,110
Speaker 1: But it was also a game console and a DVD player and it took over.

179
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:05,131
Speaker 0: in fact the first DVD player in my house Was a ps2 right.

180
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:06,340
Speaker 1: and Sony?

181
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:09,348
Speaker 1: Tried the same exact thing with a ps3.

182
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,772
Speaker 1: they use the same logic.

183
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:11,434
Speaker 1: you know which is.

184
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:13,080
Speaker 1: it wasn't a bad logic.

185
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,425
Speaker 1: You know it worked the first time.

186
00:13:14,465 --> 00:13:18,018
Speaker 1: the problem was is that they didn't put out you know the blu-ray?

187
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:19,361
Speaker 1: Ps3.

188
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:24,340
Speaker 1: at a time when blu-ray had won everyone already wanted a blu-ray player.

189
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,029
Speaker 1: They just didn't own one yet because they were a little too expensive And they didn't buy them.

190
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,291
Speaker 1: yet.

191
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,113
Speaker 0: see at the same time I feel like they were trying to go in the other direction.

192
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:32,905
Speaker 0: they were trying to Like.

193
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:35,300
Speaker 0: they were trying to use both to prop each other up.

194
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:46,533
Speaker 0: It's like they wanted to put the blu-ray ps3 together because the gamers will buy it and bolster blu-ray and the blu-ray people will buy It and bolster the ps3 and they kind of faltered on both regards.

195
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,270
Speaker 0: blu-ray only won because HD Blu-ray didn't win.

196
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:50,854
Speaker 1: HD DVD died.

197
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,391
Speaker 0: Blu-ray winning.

198
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:59,880
Speaker 0: that is like I was gonna make a horrible joke, so I'm gonna avoid that.

199
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,550
Speaker 0: It's like if glass Joe and Gabby J. Had a fight.

200
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, Gabby J.

201
00:14:03,996 --> 00:14:18,268
Speaker 1: Won, but No, because you know even though we blu-ray might have been the better physical optical disc media format of high-definition video The no one wants blu-ray.

202
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:21,160
Speaker 1: people want downloading and digital and all that action.

203
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,023
Speaker 1: That's the real winner.

204
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:23,468
Speaker 1: blu-ray is just sort of.

205
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:27,120
Speaker 1: hey DVD is still way more popular than anything else right?

206
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,868
Speaker 0: I mean sadly blu-ray is actually sales are?

207
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:33,280
Speaker 0: I mean they're really low, but they're a lot higher than I expected.

208
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:37,160
Speaker 1: I'll admit that yeah, but they're not enough to make it go anywhere.

209
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:38,182
Speaker 0: No Well the thing is by.

210
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,551
Speaker 0: I feel like they're like Betamax levels.

211
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:42,036
Speaker 1: a lot of people had Betamax.

212
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:43,020
Speaker 1: a lot of it sold.

213
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,410
Speaker 0: I think what a lot of you didn't get anywhere don't realize.

214
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:47,600
Speaker 1: a track tapes a lot of them sold didn't get anywhere.

215
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:53,125
Speaker 0: well, no what a lot of people don't realize is that the the cycle of Technology for these sorts of media.

216
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:57,556
Speaker 0: there haven't been that many iterations of video media period.

217
00:14:57,957 --> 00:15:05,406
Speaker 0: I mean look there was proprietary professional stuff VHS Betamax laserdisc DVD.

218
00:15:05,728 --> 00:15:06,954
Speaker 0: how many generations is this?

219
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:16,806
Speaker 0: it's not that many and Because technology is moving so fast the amount of time that one will exist on the market before something better comes along and incremental improvements Decreases faster and faster.

220
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:20,800
Speaker 0: and faster and incremental improvements come faster and faster to where all right.

221
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:32,023
Speaker 0: So it made a lot of sense to develop DVD and sell it because DVD was gonna be around for a while And it was so much better than anything else, but then blu-ray is an incremental improvement and Blue it.

222
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 0: look how long it took for something to be better enough than DVD to where anyone even wanted.

223
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,604
Speaker 0: And it's not better enough.

224
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:38,046
Speaker 1: Well.

225
00:15:38,106 --> 00:15:41,298
Speaker 0: It was for some people for enough people to where it's it's making do.

226
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:41,699
Speaker 0: for now.

227
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:45,807
Speaker 1: Sony's not exactly Hang with uncle money bags.

228
00:15:45,867 --> 00:15:47,754
Speaker 0: I think blu-ray sales are higher than you think.

229
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:49,299
Speaker 1: yeah, but they're not high enough.

230
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:50,345
Speaker 1: It's not.

231
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:50,767
Speaker 1: it's not it.

232
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,611
Speaker 1: They haven't read.

233
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:54,609
Speaker 1: come anywhere near what DVDs You know took off like.

234
00:15:54,871 --> 00:16:01,760
Speaker 0: well part of the reason for that I think is that it still took a while for DVD to kind of Get into people's homes even after it won.

235
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,664
Speaker 0: It took a long time.

236
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:07,596
Speaker 1: like people don't even have HD TVs and people who do have HD TVs a lot of them I'm hooked up properly.

237
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:12,633
Speaker 1: so HD you know while it's out there more than it was and it's it's definitely.

238
00:16:12,773 --> 00:16:13,857
Speaker 0: I'm not even talking about that.

239
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:20,736
Speaker 0: what I'm saying is that DVD came out and because Technology didn't advance and so quickly.

240
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:26,418
Speaker 0: in that realm DVD had a long time to become completely ubiquitous, but now blu-ray won.

241
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,137
Speaker 0: Gabby J beat glass Joe, but piston Honda and soda Popinski are right there.

242
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,040
Speaker 0: on the horizon.

243
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:46,120
Speaker 0: There's already better formats than blu-ray and by the time blu-ray starts to get any momentum There's gonna be ten more better formats and in the end The investment in a physical media is just gonna be overshadowed by broadband and download.

244
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:58,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, really optical storage mediums I think are gonna be reduced to say, you know personal backups and those sorts of things except even then the technology is moving So fast that any one standard becomes obsolete.

245
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,547
Speaker 1: Well, cuz everyone's buying Nasus and stuff.

246
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,509
Speaker 1: Look at the Drobo.

247
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,280
Speaker 1: Look at the Apple's time capsule thingy the memristor.

248
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:09,800
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna talk about it, but there was that as someone for a while.

249
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:20,521
Speaker 0: No, but there was that somewhat speculative somewhat dubious But yet very popular story on slashed out about how we might see the earliest memristor products embedded devices as early as 2009.

250
00:17:20,521 --> 00:17:21,712
Speaker 1: Yeah, give it some years.

251
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:22,479
Speaker 1: It's gonna be a while.

252
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,976
Speaker 0: But well they were saying we might have it pretty quick.

253
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:28,735
Speaker 0: because yeah I think now the research has been moving along faster than anyone expect.

254
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,021
Speaker 1: believe it when I see it They.

255
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:34,212
Speaker 1: the point is that Nasus and you know things like this.

256
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:37,039
Speaker 1: streaming video are definitely the real winners here.

257
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,220
Speaker 1: and The Xbox which started out just being you know video games primarily with a little bit of media action.

258
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, notice how Microsoft was like, yeah HD-DVD add-on.

259
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:53,494
Speaker 1: Now they're like, aha now the downloads are here Netflix.

260
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:55,280
Speaker 0: Ahoy now look at think about this.

261
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,924
Speaker 0: Ps3 they had to put.

262
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,212
Speaker 0: this physical thing cost a lot of money.

263
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:05,623
Speaker 0: the ps3 cost a shit ton And a lot of that was because of the blu-ray Xbox.

264
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:11,400
Speaker 1: all they have to do is update the firmware and they're dropping the price to 300 for the big xbox.

265
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:16,774
Speaker 0: The thing is the Roku as it as it is is awesome.

266
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,879
Speaker 1: So think about this thing about this, right?

267
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:21,851
Speaker 1: Xbox 360 $300 now.

268
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:31,946
Speaker 1: right Roku $100 that means the game part of the Xbox 360 all the non Netflix part $200 cheaper than we now.

269
00:18:32,427 --> 00:18:33,853
Speaker 1: get that math now like that.

270
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:44,470
Speaker 0: now what they're probably gonna do if I were Microsoft and if I were Netflix and what I would do is do crazy promotion to be to get Xbox people to buy into Netflix.

271
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:52,262
Speaker 1: Netflix has got to put Xboxes and all their little envelopes and Microsoft has got to put Netflix's and all their specifically.

272
00:18:52,302 --> 00:18:57,337
Speaker 0: what I would do is I would offer a no DVD plan only to Xbox people.

273
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:06,680
Speaker 0: if you have Gold I'd say you can buy it in the Xbox store Netflix for five bucks a month Yes, or Netflix you pay Microsoft points to get Netflix.

274
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,952
Speaker 0: Yes You just buy it and it's ain't you in the Xbox gold or whatever.

275
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:11,879
Speaker 0: and if you have gold you get a discount.

276
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:12,897
Speaker 0: if you Have silver you don't get it.

277
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,416
Speaker 1: Well now because yeah apparently what they're doing is you can only get this thing right now.

278
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:19,680
Speaker 1: the what that's really happy.

279
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,849
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, is if you have to have gold.

280
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:24,660
Speaker 1: if you don't have gold you got nothing and you have to have Netflix.

281
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,700
Speaker 0: So that's even better cuz that forces you to upgrade to gold if you didn't which I know a lot everyone uses.

282
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:31,303
Speaker 0: No, no You know who doesn't?

283
00:19:31,584 --> 00:19:36,420
Speaker 0: there are a lot of people who really only play single-player games who got an Xbox because they like gaming.

284
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Speaker 0: But a lot of older people like people like in the five years older than rim and scott demographic.

285
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:45,220
Speaker 0: They don't have Xbox gold because they don't play games with people they play by themselves.

286
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:48,178
Speaker 0: No, those people will eventually want it.

287
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:55,770
Speaker 0: They'll they're either gonna force those people to get gold which might get them to buy into gaming more and get even more invested in The Xbox or later.

288
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:57,260
Speaker 0: They'll offer it for the silver people.

289
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 0: You just have to pay more, but if I were them the cross-promotion would be painfully apparent.

290
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:06,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like the Xbox definitely going somewhere.

291
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:15,359
Speaker 1: the thing that gets me right is like okay and the only reason I don't have an Xbox to be perfectly honest cuz I don't have an HDTV and the reason I have an HDTV is they don't have a house to put it in.

292
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:24,680
Speaker 0: well I mean yes, you know play it sounds dumb, but we could buy an HDTV, but for the size of our living room We need a certain like size and we have to mount it on the wall.

293
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,849
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pay someone to mount this thing on the wall with an expensive wall mount and a house I don't own and screw up the wall.

294
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:41,631
Speaker 0: and now I got when I get a house I foresee like permanently professionally installed HDTV and or projector in the theater both Considering that land I still got a call about right.

295
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,620
Speaker 1: we should drive over and take a look at the land.

296
00:20:43,721 --> 00:20:45,552
Speaker 0: I actually I ran over there yesterday.

297
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:46,860
Speaker 1: She look at the land on Google Maps.

298
00:20:47,303 --> 00:20:48,652
Speaker 0: I didn't do that, but I know where it is.

299
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:52,491
Speaker 0: and yeah We shouldn't talk about this on the show, but we're thinking about buying a land.

300
00:20:53,014 --> 00:20:54,500
Speaker 1: buy some land buy some land.

301
00:20:57,301 --> 00:20:59,395
Speaker 0: So why not just get both we can get both.

302
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:03,199
Speaker 1: so Yeah, this is gonna be pretty interesting here.

303
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,780
Speaker 1: But the above guy right what I was saying about not having a house to get HDTV.

304
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,146
Speaker 1: So I can't get a 360.

305
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:11,958
Speaker 0: there's a hole in the bucket Delilah not Delilah.

306
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:12,681
Speaker 0: Do whatever.

307
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:22,153
Speaker 1: whatever her name is right the 360 is already some years old and even though they're updating it big time How long until the Xbox you know for 60 or whatever?

308
00:21:22,173 --> 00:21:23,136
Speaker 1: right am I gonna get?

309
00:21:23,236 --> 00:21:24,520
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be too late.

310
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,079
Speaker 1: Is it gonna be too late?

311
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,204
Speaker 0: We're just what you could do.

312
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:32,709
Speaker 0: what we could do is just hold out like I did when a you know They when the m64 was announced.

313
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,900
Speaker 0: I was already can trenching PC gaming.

314
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:38,200
Speaker 0: I kind of decided I'm gonna hold out until consoles forced me back.

315
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,782
Speaker 1: I was also.

316
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:45,984
Speaker 1: I was PC gaming from the end of the 16-bit era to the GameCube No to the GBA.

317
00:21:46,024 --> 00:21:49,736
Speaker 1: well, I guess portable gaming of all from the GBA from the Game Boy Color on.

318
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:59,040
Speaker 1: I was in portable gaming But until the GameCube I was out of console gaming from 16-bit to GameCube so that whole 64 PlayStation Saturn.

319
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:00,780
Speaker 0: I see the way our lives are going.

320
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:09,194
Speaker 1: We're not gonna get in on the Xbox 360, but I foresee the thing is I look and some of the stuff They've got they're gonna come out with a sequel to Galaga.

321
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:15,039
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but What they're going to do is eventually there will be the Xbox 970 or whatever.

322
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:24,319
Speaker 0: it's over 9000 and All we'll have to do is get in on the ground floor of that because by then we'll be idly rich.

323
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:35,439
Speaker 1: Hopefully and hopefully everything that works on the 360 will be forwards compatible and the the 9000 we backwards give that Then I'll be alright cuz I'll still be able to play the Carcassonne that I missed out on.

324
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,525
Speaker 1: Chris No one else will be playing it.

325
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:38,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'll play naked Uno.

326
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:40,864
Speaker 0: Oh god I'll play some naked Uno.

327
00:22:40,884 --> 00:22:44,859
Speaker 1: Alright, so you got any news that I do besides saying the same thing you've said before.

328
00:22:44,879 --> 00:22:48,840
Speaker 0: but One more thing to say about the thing you said, but I'll say it real quick.

329
00:22:49,661 --> 00:23:04,299
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that in the end the Xbox 360 with the Roku downloadable content Especially if the barely a rumor that I could eventually see Hulu getting in on this is some sort of partnership Who is definitely got to make with some kind of action?

330
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,163
Speaker 1: But imagine

331
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:20,326
Speaker 0: if who if Netflix does this on the Xbox and with the Roku, you know for grandmas and people like us And then Hulu gets in on that The Xbox 360 and the Roku are going to do for downloadable on-demand media Exactly what the ps2 did for

332
00:23:20,346 --> 00:23:20,626
Speaker 1: DC.

333
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:25,760
Speaker 1: I think Sony has to go and find some sort of streaming video action now to compete.

334
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:26,826
Speaker 0: What are they gonna do though?

335
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:29,160
Speaker 0: Cuz it's already all everything I want.

336
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:36,063
Speaker 1: Does unlike Microsoft Source its media empire Sony has the media empire they also own.

337
00:23:36,203 --> 00:23:40,215
Speaker 1: yes and Sony is just horribly bad at getting parts of their company to cooperate.

338
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:46,560
Speaker 1: like one arm of the company is Like let's make computer parts The other part of the company is like don't make anything they can copy.

339
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,151
Speaker 1: It's like they're simultaneously making mp3 players and also putting out DRM.

340
00:23:50,191 --> 00:24:06,566
Speaker 0: and it's like, but the other trouble is that That the best course of action would be for all the Sony few companies to deny their media to all of these downloadable things and have their own Sony thing, but one if they really did.

341
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:13,243
Speaker 0: that I have a feeling that there would be lawsuits and antitrust business in the long run and - it just.

342
00:24:14,045 --> 00:24:14,748
Speaker 0: I feel like what.

343
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:21,960
Speaker 0: the other possibility is that as media kind of gets more balkanized People will just issue anything Sony because they wouldn't care.

344
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is an interesting question though.

345
00:24:23,886 --> 00:24:28,460
Speaker 1: Are there any Sony pictures available on the Netflix streaming?

346
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,020
Speaker 1: You know instant queue service and if so, you watch them on your 360, that's incredibly ironic.

347
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:41,200
Speaker 0: If I were Sony I would try to just buy out Hulu outright.

348
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:47,674
Speaker 1: No, it's thing is it's so many hands in that one I know but that's why it might not and the reason that's the reason who it's it.

349
00:24:47,775 --> 00:24:49,261
Speaker 1: the Hulu is kind of good is cuz You got.

350
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:52,855
Speaker 1: you got Fox in there yellow get a little Viacom in there.

351
00:24:52,915 --> 00:24:53,960
Speaker 1: It's you know, it's all mixed up.

352
00:24:54,161 --> 00:24:55,025
Speaker 1: That's why it's so great.

353
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,638
Speaker 0: I just think it might be too late for Sony to do anything.

354
00:24:57,678 --> 00:25:04,458
Speaker 1: I think Microsoft and Nintendo the thing is it just Sony is just such a large beast especially for the 80s.

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,949
Speaker 0: But Microsoft is a large beast too.

356
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:09,340
Speaker 1: No, but the thing is they're so large.

357
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:19,994
Speaker 1: I think that like Sony Sometime around like maybe four or five years ago was like shot dead in the head and now it's just taking forever for it To fall down because it's so high up running around like a chicken without a head.

358
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:21,904
Speaker 1: No, it's just it died It's cool.

359
00:25:21,944 --> 00:25:23,414
Speaker 1: It's just completely unconscious.

360
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:24,078
Speaker 1: It's just falling.

361
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:27,120
Speaker 1: It's just taking a long time.

362
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:33,736
Speaker 1: So big it's real tall and it takes like years for it eventually land on the ground.

363
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,220
Speaker 0: what I could foresee.

364
00:25:35,561 --> 00:25:41,440
Speaker 0: But this is totally me as rim speculating and I'm not making any prediction as to market whatever.

365
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:58,246
Speaker 0: but I could see Sony in the long run just Either the technology wings of it will just break away or the technology wings but somehow they will divest themselves of all the interests that are counter to where the future is as in Everything that relies on IP.

366
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:03,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, they either need to have all their different businesses Separate.

367
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,395
Speaker 1: that way they won't you know got themselves separated.

368
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:18,377
Speaker 1: because if they do that Then each individual business part can actually do its job to the best of its ability without being Hindered by the other ones, you know the mp3 people will be able to make the best MP3 players without the media wing fucking them up.

369
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,517
Speaker 1: or They actually need to partner up properly and boost each other.

370
00:26:23,537 --> 00:26:28,002
Speaker 1: because right now It's just every part of Sony hurts every other part of Sony Right.

371
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:33,539
Speaker 0: So in much more bullshitty news a lot's been happening with eBay lately.

372
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:40,420
Speaker 0: now Qualify this by saying that I have an eBay account that I have not logged into in almost two years.

373
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:50,744
Speaker 1: I use it incredibly rarely like maybe once in a blue moon I'll buy something and I think once ever I sold something and it was okay but it wasn't worth the effort.

374
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:58,190
Speaker 0: three times I bid on something on eBay and once I tried to sell something and The experience was generally unpleasant.

375
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,006
Speaker 0: like eBay is not fun to use eBay's I really don't like.

376
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:04,830
Speaker 0: like everything about eBay is just kind of.

377
00:27:05,252 --> 00:27:09,401
Speaker 0: it's always a little bit shady and a little bit like 1990.

378
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:10,866
Speaker 1: well, really you have to have.

379
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:17,031
Speaker 1: I mean think about look how successful like fishing is right where they just send you an email That says go to paypool.com right?

380
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:22,729
Speaker 1: There's something wrong with your cable And you know that totally works on people.

381
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:24,817
Speaker 1: so eBay it's really.

382
00:27:24,897 --> 00:27:28,711
Speaker 1: for me at least It's really easy to tell fraud apart.

383
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:30,256
Speaker 0: I'm not worried about fraud.

384
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,360
Speaker 0: I see the fraud all the time.

385
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,832
Speaker 1: It's really easy to sort out what's BS and what's not.

386
00:27:34,873 --> 00:27:40,120
Speaker 1: the thing is is so, you know, it's like 90% of what goes on on eBay is not BS.

387
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,869
Speaker 1: That's because you know the ease.

388
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:47,700
Speaker 1: the detection of BS is pretty simple But it's still like it looks like a mess.

389
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,044
Speaker 1: It's not clean.

390
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:54,421
Speaker 1: the Apple really needs to go in there and shine it up for him because it just really messy and it's not Pleasant.

391
00:27:55,224 --> 00:27:59,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I just I mean I just I avoid eBay because it's kind of scummy and kind of blend.

392
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,469
Speaker 1: I just you don't go there because you want to.

393
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:02,574
Speaker 1: you go there because you need to.

394
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:05,780
Speaker 1: you can't find what you want Anywhere else kind of like a Walmart.

395
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:08,466
Speaker 1: Don't go to Walmart for any reason.

396
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:11,216
Speaker 0: I have been to Walmart's a couple of times out of necessity.

397
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:13,289
Speaker 0: when I was in Arizona That was the only place to go.

398
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:17,680
Speaker 0: when I was in North Carolina That was the only place to go at 3 in the morning to get Red Bull.

399
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:21,895
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the place to go to buy something if it's not available from any.

400
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,613
Speaker 1: if you can't find it on Amazon You can't find it anywhere else.

401
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:25,260
Speaker 1: go to eBay.

402
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:26,685
Speaker 1: It was more than it'll be there somewhere.

403
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:37,960
Speaker 0: like most of the read like I while I dislike a lot of Walmart's business practice I can't put the full-on hate on Walmart because they're not that much worse than target or any of those other stores.

404
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,299
Speaker 0: That's not the reason I don't go there.

405
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,803
Speaker 0: I know that's the thing like both of us are down on Walmart But for different reasons.

406
00:28:42,843 --> 00:28:48,440
Speaker 0: we're down on them partly because I don't like any one entity having so much control over entertainment media.

407
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,360
Speaker 1: It's not just entertainment media.

408
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:58,160
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but entertainment media is the one that they I think they have the most undue control perhaps But also it did on a purely visceral level.

409
00:28:58,501 --> 00:29:00,630
Speaker 0: It is unpleasant to be in a Walmart.

410
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,919
Speaker 0: that that also and the atmosphere.

411
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:07,796
Speaker 0: in the event I really don't like being in Walmart's and I feel really uncomfortable.

412
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:08,559
Speaker 1: How about Walmart?

413
00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:08,820
Speaker 1: calm?

414
00:29:09,741 --> 00:29:11,508
Speaker 0: I've never actually been to Walmart doc.

415
00:29:11,609 --> 00:29:14,180
Speaker 1: It just looks like oh, you know, did you just buy stuff?

416
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time that's not the kind of stuff I'd buy online.

417
00:29:17,331 --> 00:29:19,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess yeah, they sell everything though.

418
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,308
Speaker 0: So yeah, but so does Amazon.

419
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,763
Speaker 0: I know right and I like Amazon I buy.

420
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:27,737
Speaker 0: in fact, I've realized that I buy about half of what I buy.

421
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 0: that isn't food.

422
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:33,172
Speaker 0: Well, you know what if I don't count food I probably buy a good 80% of what I buy on Amazon.

423
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:34,257
Speaker 1: you can buy food on Amazon.

424
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:35,000
Speaker 0: I know but I don't.

425
00:29:36,261 --> 00:29:40,988
Speaker 0: Anyway, so eBay All that aside there was a. this is an old story.

426
00:29:41,008 --> 00:29:44,117
Speaker 0: But a while ago they got sued in France.

427
00:29:44,358 --> 00:29:53,498
Speaker 0: Oh Now the story was that they got sued over the fact that they were selling Counterfeit goods like Christian Dior or Louis Vuitton or all those other like.

428
00:29:53,538 --> 00:29:54,100
Speaker 1: what'd you say?

429
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,066
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hippity-hoopities.

430
00:29:56,307 --> 00:30:02,637
Speaker 0: I gotta know what that is, you know, eight million dollar handbags and Perfume that cost a hundred thousand dollars.

431
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:03,444
Speaker 1: Oh wait They were.

432
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:05,480
Speaker 1: so someone on a B wasn't selling anything.

433
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:11,180
Speaker 1: Someone went on eBay and sold something that looked like a million dollar handbag, but was actually a five dollar handbag.

434
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,323
Speaker 1: It was perhaps it was the first and they sold it for over and they were selling it for $20.

435
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:23,006
Speaker 0: The fake research part of it was that they were selling legitimate Fake Versace Disney crossovers.

436
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:23,788
Speaker 1: Okay.

437
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,893
Speaker 0: Well, that's some inside baseball.

438
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,339
Speaker 0: Anyway, so they're selling the fake Versace.

439
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,968
Speaker 0: and Is this real?

440
00:30:32,988 --> 00:30:40,706
Speaker 0: no All right, there's this movie called suicide Kamikaze girls, you probably like it.

441
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:44,260
Speaker 1: Yes girls is different different thing very different, right?

442
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,443
Speaker 0: So they were.

443
00:30:45,524 --> 00:30:49,360
Speaker 0: you know, people were selling possibly illegitimate designer goods on eBay.

444
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,189
Speaker 0: All right, so the French court said stop that we're suing you.

445
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:55,500
Speaker 0: you have to pay us 40 million euros.

446
00:30:55,681 --> 00:30:56,724
Speaker 1: It's not eBay's fault.

447
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,132
Speaker 1: Well people selling it.

448
00:30:59,273 --> 00:31:00,276
Speaker 0: the French court ruled.

449
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:00,577
Speaker 0: Yes.

450
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:03,247
Speaker 0: It's eBay's fault All right, and here's the thing.

451
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:04,813
Speaker 1: I would just close down eBay France.

452
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:06,780
Speaker 1: how much money can a France be making?

453
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:14,253
Speaker 0: Well, if they're selling all this verse and I guess but here's the thing They are probably the fake.

454
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:22,966
Speaker 0: for save your indignation The primary impetus here was not that they were selling Illegitimate Versace.

455
00:31:23,368 --> 00:31:26,660
Speaker 0: All right, but that they were selling real Versace.

456
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,980
Speaker 1: They're not allowed to have real Versace.

457
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:39,200
Speaker 0: Apparently France does not have the right of first sale Which is one of the most important consumer protections in the world, so there's no tag sales in France.

458
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:39,943
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

459
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:43,816
Speaker 0: I guess there are but apparently we've with dawn Mattel.

460
00:31:43,836 --> 00:31:45,646
Speaker 0: Yeah Maletti I don't know all these.

461
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,380
Speaker 0: you know all those designer Versace's.

462
00:31:48,682 --> 00:31:56,398
Speaker 0: We're saying that people were selling their goods on eBay But the people selling them were not authorized sellers and therefore they shouldn't be allowed to.

463
00:31:57,702 --> 00:32:10,667
Speaker 1: All right, so something basically said alright eBay you owe us 40 million euros, but by that law something like eBay Cannot possibly exist in France.

464
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,152
Speaker 1: I would just close down eBay France.

465
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:17,795
Speaker 0: eBay can sell what you can sell whatever you want on eBay except for things that are protected by these.

466
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:22,019
Speaker 0: other things like Those are the Kirby vacuums.

467
00:32:22,301 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaker 0: They have this thing where they say you can't sell a Kirby vacuum ever.

468
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:29,132
Speaker 0: But you see him on eBay a lot because they can't enforce that we have.

469
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:31,340
Speaker 0: humans have a right to first sale in the US.

470
00:32:31,581 --> 00:32:34,833
Speaker 1: Yep, apparently citizens have a right to first sale the US.

471
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:35,054
Speaker 1: well.

472
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:38,428
Speaker 1: I technically humans do too I know, but did you know?

473
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,920
Speaker 0: well well you see you see what I was doing there.

474
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:53,419
Speaker 0: I said humans because apparently in France aha Yes, apparently the French don't have the right to first sale and these sorts of things and I think eBay's argument against this is absolutely brilliant.

475
00:32:54,501 --> 00:33:03,760
Speaker 0: Basically they said quote today's ruling is about an attempt to protect Uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of computer consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers.

476
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much anyone who's really we were seeking to leave to appeal.

477
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:18,075
Speaker 1: the right to first sale means that If you buy something like if I go to the store, and I buy a book I'm allowed to sell the book to someone else.

478
00:33:18,115 --> 00:33:18,678
Speaker 1: That's the writer.

479
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:21,384
Speaker 1: first sale They're not having.

480
00:33:21,424 --> 00:33:29,434
Speaker 1: that means if you buy something it's yours and you can throw it out But you can't give it away or sell it or anything.

481
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:29,875
Speaker 1: you know this.

482
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:30,819
Speaker 1: you're not allowed to sell it.

483
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:39,233
Speaker 0: We're not lawyers, so we won't go into this any further, but in terms of technology first sale There's a lot of rumbling in the legal world.

484
00:33:39,374 --> 00:33:40,659
Speaker 0: and think of this right now.

485
00:33:40,981 --> 00:33:43,954
Speaker 0: Microsoft doesn't let you resell licenses their software.

486
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:47,751
Speaker 1: if I buy a copy of Windows I can't sell that copy of Windows to rim.

487
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:49,840
Speaker 1: That's because I'm not actually buying Windows.

488
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:52,351
Speaker 0: I'm buying a Windows license, and there's all this cut.

489
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,400
Speaker 1: like I'm just signing a contract with Microsoft.

490
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,400
Speaker 1: I'm not purchasing a copy like a copy of a book.

491
00:33:57,601 --> 00:34:01,020
Speaker 0: They're EULA's say that you can't sell the software to other people.

492
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:07,200
Speaker 0: But there have been some court cases that are going slowly in the direction of first sale bitches.

493
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:22,715
Speaker 0: And let me tell you if when the day comes when you can buy Last year's version of Adobe for five bucks on eBay Think about that that'll mean that someone you know a professional design place right.

494
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,179
Speaker 1: they buy Adobe software.

495
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,152
Speaker 1: Then because they're so professional they got to have the new version.

496
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:28,540
Speaker 1: they upgrade right.

497
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:33,958
Speaker 1: But they have these old versions that they still own there are allowed to sell them.

498
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:35,223
Speaker 1: They'll be mad.

499
00:34:35,424 --> 00:34:42,896
Speaker 1: used saw a legal used software market going around and the pirated used software market will go away Or be severely damaged.

500
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,244
Speaker 0: now the People would much rather.

501
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:56,889
Speaker 1: I believe that people would much rather pay say 50 bucks for a legitimate But used copy of say Adobe, you know illustrator I've been paid five bucks for a shady one.

502
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,783
Speaker 0: I'd be willing to pay 50 bucks for a copy a cool edit Pro That was legitimate.

503
00:35:00,983 --> 00:35:13,775
Speaker 1: I know right people would like having the safety of legitimate software, but when the price is prohibitive They'll resort to piracy, but and if there was a legitimate legal used market like there is with video games People would go for that.

504
00:35:13,795 --> 00:35:18,200
Speaker 0: yeah I mean and the thing is the arguments that the software companies offer companies to be screwed.

505
00:35:18,541 --> 00:35:19,887
Speaker 0: They say you'll put us out of business.

506
00:35:19,927 --> 00:35:21,072
Speaker 0: It's unfair, but you know what.

507
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:24,326
Speaker 1: you should have a business model That matches the real world.

508
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:30,951
Speaker 0: if reselling a software license is unfair Then selling a car or a book is also unfair.

509
00:35:31,272 --> 00:35:39,620
Speaker 0: the fact that I can go to a used bookstore or a used CD store For a dollar used car lots not putting the car lots out of business.

510
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:44,339
Speaker 1: You know used video game sales are keeping the video game stores in business not putting them out.

511
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,785
Speaker 0: Well, they never use sales.

512
00:35:45,825 --> 00:35:47,291
Speaker 1: They'd be screwed by the best buys.

513
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:47,652
Speaker 0: Yeah, well.

514
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,158
Speaker 0: No they'd be screwed by Amazon.

515
00:35:49,178 --> 00:36:01,649
Speaker 0: I do But luckily there's some good news because here in the good old United States of America There was a similar lawsuit made by Tiffany's against eBay But they were saying you're selling Tiffany's.

516
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:02,633
Speaker 1: that are actually did now.

517
00:36:02,673 --> 00:36:06,306
Speaker 0: this one was because we have first sale here So they couldn't do that instead.

518
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:07,330
Speaker 0: It was pretty much.

519
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,414
Speaker 1: You're selling fake Tiffany.

520
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,180
Speaker 0: You're allowing people to sell fake Tiffany's.

521
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,384
Speaker 0: You have to stop it and the court ruled unambiguously and Pretty much.

522
00:36:16,505 --> 00:36:19,619
Speaker 0: I think the quote some lawyer said was it was a home run.

523
00:36:20,442 --> 00:36:23,259
Speaker 0: Fuck you Tiffany's doesn't have to do shit for you.

524
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,877
Speaker 1: You know if I was Tiffany's first of all I wouldn't had a lawyer so dumb to try that.

525
00:36:27,917 --> 00:36:32,619
Speaker 1: what I would have had is That the lawyers find these people who find these sellers and go after them.

526
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,384
Speaker 0: well Here's the thing.

527
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:37,524
Speaker 0: this is a four-year-old lawsuit Finally came to fruition.

528
00:36:37,544 --> 00:36:38,587
Speaker 1: wasted four years on.

529
00:36:38,627 --> 00:36:43,158
Speaker 0: no this was in federal court and the US District Court in Manhattan.

530
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,927
Speaker 1: it Pretty much as their Tiffany's is.

531
00:36:46,168 --> 00:36:52,386
Speaker 0: this is this has gone beyond just this Tiffany's thing because what this has done is very much strengthened.

532
00:36:52,466 --> 00:37:00,371
Speaker 0: the case that if someone have a company has a trademark or Possibly in the end this might be able to be extended to intellectual property in general.

533
00:37:00,892 --> 00:37:08,467
Speaker 0: It is their responsibility to police it not resellers not modes like not ISPs not anything like that.

534
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,800
Speaker 0: so you can't sue YouTube for showing a video.

535
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:18,146
Speaker 0: You can sue the person who put the video on YouTube and you can go after YouTube if they don't take it down with Reasonable notice and all that business.

536
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:27,240
Speaker 1: that's why what YouTube does is if you're saying like you know Disney They actually give you a special account that lets you go around finding Disney things and getting rid of them.

537
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,325
Speaker 1: It's like do-it-yourself.

538
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,249
Speaker 1: We're not doing it for you.

539
00:37:29,571 --> 00:37:30,154
Speaker 1: That's what they do.

540
00:37:30,556 --> 00:37:34,232
Speaker 1: so eBay Totally eBay should do a similar thing.

541
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,403
Speaker 1: they should say alright for Satch Here's this.

542
00:37:36,483 --> 00:37:38,309
Speaker 1: you here's your special eBay account.

543
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:41,139
Speaker 1: you can go around looking for for Satch's and getting them off there.

544
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,466
Speaker 1: now We're not doing it for you.

545
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:46,637
Speaker 0: to quote from this article on Yahoo I figure I should cite my source at least a little bit.

546
00:37:47,422 --> 00:37:59,820
Speaker 0: The judge in a 66-page decision following a non jury trial in the US District Court of Manhattan Oh 66 pages got his arm must be dying said that he was quote not unsympathetic Not unsympathetic.

547
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:02,188
Speaker 1: In other words he was sympathetic.

548
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,071
Speaker 0: He was not.

549
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:03,793
Speaker 0: that you know.

550
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:05,800
Speaker 0: judges say that a lot.

551
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:07,688
Speaker 0: That phrase not I'm said.

552
00:38:07,728 --> 00:38:08,230
Speaker 0: it's kind of.

553
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:12,719
Speaker 0: here's what I do say your car blew up And you tried to make me buy you a new car.

554
00:38:13,281 --> 00:38:21,787
Speaker 0: I would basically say while I am not unsympathetic to your claim and your and your pain and your suffering and your loss I'm not buying you a new car.

555
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:22,210
Speaker 1: Well.

556
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,100
Speaker 1: Couldn't you just say I'm sympathetic.

557
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:32,448
Speaker 0: Avoid the double negative now because there's reasons, but anyway while he was not have my cities But I'm not giving you money quote the article.

558
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,560
Speaker 0: He said the law was clearly on eBay's side.

559
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:46,800
Speaker 0: It is the trademark owners burden to police its mark and companies like eBay Cannot be held liable for trademark infringement based solely on their generalized knowledge of that trademark infringement.

560
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,427
Speaker 0: It might be occurring on their website.

561
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:48,808
Speaker 1: Okay, now.

562
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:49,611
Speaker 1: Here's a question.

563
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:50,736
Speaker 1: ready for this question.

564
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:51,660
Speaker 1: This is a. this is tough.

565
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:54,429
Speaker 1: I'm ready so you get a trademark right?

566
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,860
Speaker 1: It's your responsibility to police the trademark.

567
00:38:57,981 --> 00:39:00,151
Speaker 1: Let's say you're a small town Joe.

568
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:01,880
Speaker 1: you trademarked like you want it.

569
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,307
Speaker 1: You want to start like a franchise Scott?

570
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:13,771
Speaker 1: the answer is you're fucked right because it's the cost of policing a friend trademark Even if you're just small-time guy or big-time guy.

571
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:27,898
Speaker 1: the cost of policing any trademark With the internet and technology in the world being so large and society being so huge is so prohibitive well at the same that it becomes actually impossible even for a gigantic company.

572
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:34,620
Speaker 1: thus is Trademarks if you you know require people to you know at the same time.

573
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:45,379
Speaker 0: It's not quite that bad because what you can do as far as I've seen this is what we at geek nights would be doing Because while we will have a lawyer on retainer We will not be using said lawyer every day.

574
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:52,620
Speaker 0: But you know if in the future with trademarks and all that because you know our common-law Trademark will eventually become a real trademark and all this sort of business.

575
00:39:52,701 --> 00:40:12,860
Speaker 0: But we would send out takedown notices And we would send down you know these desist orders and all these things written on our own and keep paper trails and all That and that way if Someone refused to bring it down we have this paper trail And then we go to a lawyer and you can do kind of some of this preliminary work I would imagine on your own and then the lawsuit only if someone fails to comply.

576
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still.

577
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:15,710
Speaker 1: it's a lot of work.

578
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,855
Speaker 1: You'd like to do all that.

579
00:40:17,016 --> 00:40:17,397
Speaker 1: You know what.

580
00:40:17,418 --> 00:40:17,940
Speaker 1: keep up with it.

581
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,803
Speaker 1: Oh, he's at a hundred percent I'm.

582
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:28,960
Speaker 0: I will say this if you are not willing and able to at least put forth some Basic level of due diligence, then you do not deserve a trademark.

583
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:30,908
Speaker 0: That's the way the world is today.

584
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:33,660
Speaker 0: Yeah trademarks should be a special and somewhat rare thing.

585
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:41,158
Speaker 1: I think yeah, but I still I think it's gonna get to the point where it's impossible to pretty much Have a trademark and keep it in force at the same time.

586
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:53,044
Speaker 0: Anyway, we went on a while there so things of the day This is something.

587
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,408
Speaker 0: I think is super cool.

588
00:40:54,428 --> 00:41:07,219
Speaker 0: I obviously they're not building it yet, but it looks like California might actually be getting a usable workable Downtown to downtown bullet train.

589
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:08,845
Speaker 1: Bullet train.

590
00:41:09,006 --> 00:41:13,785
Speaker 0: Yes bullet train the NIMBYs lost Everyone in the way lost.

591
00:41:14,106 --> 00:41:18,259
Speaker 0: that pretty much is gonna come down to a bond vote in November and a cup like.

592
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:27,798
Speaker 0: there's still a lot of political shenanigans going on around this but There's a good chance that this 40 billion dollar project is going to.

593
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:31,996
Speaker 0: oh, sorry Sorry, I think it's 226 billion dollars.

594
00:41:32,016 --> 00:41:32,720
Speaker 1: That's about right.

595
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:39,693
Speaker 0: Well, there's all these different figures because that that larger figure includes a whole bunch of other projects and public works and things.

596
00:41:39,733 --> 00:41:51,035
Speaker 0: but regardless California and the West are very likely in the next decade going to get a serious awesome Modern bullet train and I am so excited about this

597
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:57,020
Speaker 1: because people in the West Coast They don't know from trains, you know, so it's like now they're gonna get like a real deal tray.

598
00:41:57,101 --> 00:41:58,359
Speaker 1: They'll actually be useful to them.

599
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,239
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is we need this in the East Coast too and we could have it if it were for the NIMBYs.

600
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:12,999
Speaker 0: Look how much the NIMBYs fought giving Metro North One more station on already existing already in use tracks and the station was already in use too.

601
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:16,080
Speaker 0: It was an Amtrak station on the Metro North.

602
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:22,478
Speaker 0: All they had to do was make the Poughkeepsie train go one stop further north and the people in Rhinebeck said no We don't want people commuting from here.

603
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,331
Speaker 0: Luckily, they're gonna do it anyway, but it's alright.

604
00:42:25,853 --> 00:42:26,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think this is cool.

605
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,408
Speaker 0: So That's all I have to say about that.

606
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:31,137
Speaker 1: That was your thing of the day train.

607
00:42:31,419 --> 00:42:33,726
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm kind of a rail buff.

608
00:42:33,766 --> 00:42:36,054
Speaker 0: I really like railroads and trains night.

609
00:42:36,496 --> 00:42:37,520
Speaker 1: So check this out, right?

610
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,626
Speaker 1: How many video games do you play it?

611
00:42:39,646 --> 00:42:41,332
Speaker 1: I mean you played tf2.

612
00:42:41,432 --> 00:42:46,736
Speaker 1: you play yes to try to You play natural selection.

613
00:42:46,756 --> 00:42:47,258
Speaker 1: I hope to.

614
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:52,599
Speaker 1: And all these games have some sort of sentry gun right aliens?

615
00:42:53,322 --> 00:42:54,468
Speaker 1: You know the movie.

616
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:57,120
Speaker 1: it's a gun that just stands there in one spot.

617
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:02,780
Speaker 1: But if anyone if he can get line of sight on you it will shoot you with whatever it shoots.

618
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:10,533
Speaker 0: I think that the natural selection sentry gun is the best stylistically Definitely because it feels so much like the alien one.

619
00:43:10,693 --> 00:43:14,068
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's definitely the alien man That's seen an alien with an ammo counter.

620
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:15,836
Speaker 0: I want to watch that movie again right now.

621
00:43:16,097 --> 00:43:16,780
Speaker 1: Is it on the Roku?

622
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,424
Speaker 0: I don't know.

623
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:18,639
Speaker 0: I'll look anyway.

624
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:23,725
Speaker 1: So, you know things like this are definitely Technologically feasible.

625
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:38,026
Speaker 1: I mean you pretty much use a camera some sort of motion detection Which is pretty simple, you know visual calculus there You know image processing to figure out, you know, I got one frame and in this frame, you know These pixels are different than in the last frame.

626
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:39,630
Speaker 1: Therefore something over there moved.

627
00:43:39,671 --> 00:43:40,694
Speaker 0: You know, it's totally not.

628
00:43:40,714 --> 00:43:43,985
Speaker 0: neither is alien nation or alien 3.

629
00:43:43,985 --> 00:43:57,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway You know and then you can you know have some sort of calibration like how much how many things change and then you know Something's there and you know the whole thing and then you just trigger something to fire which is also pretty trivial.

630
00:43:57,943 --> 00:44:02,560
Speaker 1: And many times we've seen people, you know, I've seen YouTube videos of sentry guns.

631
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:09,400
Speaker 1: People have made or you know military contractors showing things off and nothing has really impressed me.

632
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,353
Speaker 1: You know, I've seen these sentry guns are really like wow.

633
00:44:12,394 --> 00:44:13,619
Speaker 1: That's a real sentry gun.

634
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:20,640
Speaker 1: Until now this guy made a briefcase sentry gun that has paintballs and it's a paintball gun.

635
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,825
Speaker 1: It's not a real gun, but you know, you could switch, you know, well, there's laws about man traps in the US But it's a briefcase.

636
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:27,809
Speaker 1: He opens it up.

637
00:44:27,829 --> 00:44:28,773
Speaker 1: There's a laptop.

638
00:44:28,813 --> 00:44:36,819
Speaker 1: He turns it on and the gun activates in anything that enters if the guns sort of viewing area gets shot at.

639
00:44:37,602 --> 00:44:44,773
Speaker 1: And in this video, what's really impressive is he doesn't just show the gun, you know Like hitting a basketball before it hits the ground.

640
00:44:44,793 --> 00:44:50,174
Speaker 1: or you know Shooting at this guy as he peeks out from behind a wooden board.

641
00:44:50,235 --> 00:44:54,653
Speaker 1: and you know aiming at his head He's wearing a paintball mask, he's alright, he knows he's gonna get hit.

642
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:56,060
Speaker 1: he's doing it for demonstration purposes.

643
00:44:56,961 --> 00:45:01,680
Speaker 1: The guy tries to distract it by throwing a stick to one direction running in the other direction.

644
00:45:02,162 --> 00:45:03,969
Speaker 1: It shoots at the stick then turns to shoot at him.

645
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:06,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's pretty good.

646
00:45:06,901 --> 00:45:09,690
Speaker 1: I'm very very impressed as what they've been able to do here.

647
00:45:09,891 --> 00:45:12,480
Speaker 0: Actually, that's a really interesting think of the logic here, right?

648
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:16,120
Speaker 0: So say you're making one of these for the military or you know to keep aliens out.

649
00:45:17,601 --> 00:45:20,500
Speaker 0: You you want it to shoot anything that moves in the radius, right?

650
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:21,926
Speaker 0: You don't want to just shoot it.

651
00:45:22,026 --> 00:45:26,565
Speaker 0: one thing you want it to kind of have some sort of logic of alright I tracked that object.

652
00:45:26,645 --> 00:45:27,228
Speaker 0: I shot it.

653
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:28,654
Speaker 0: It's probably dead.

654
00:45:28,714 --> 00:45:30,040
Speaker 0: I'll move on to another target.

655
00:45:30,201 --> 00:45:38,215
Speaker 1: Well, I think what it is is it's like he threw the stake But he him moving was many more pixels moving more quickly than the stake.

656
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:42,536
Speaker 1: so you could have some sort of logic to Prioritize the targets if there are many of them.

657
00:45:42,818 --> 00:45:51,880
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I'd really like to see them do something sort of crazy like get a big like piece of paper and draw all over it and Put the gun out and then wiggle the piece of paper.

658
00:45:52,161 --> 00:45:55,054
Speaker 1: So it looks like this stuff moving all over the place and see what it would shoot at.

659
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:57,244
Speaker 1: I don't know There's an idea.

660
00:45:57,284 --> 00:45:59,980
Speaker 0: But yeah, I've always been I've always liked sentry guns.

661
00:46:00,342 --> 00:46:02,497
Speaker 0: I tried to make them with varying success.

662
00:46:02,537 --> 00:46:02,940
Speaker 0: as a kid.

663
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:03,262
Speaker 0: This

664
00:46:03,322 --> 00:46:18,440
Speaker 1: is pretty impressive and if I was a guy who owned a paintball place I would requisition these people to make like, you know a bunch of these for me perhaps, you know a little more, you know Sturdy and plastic boxes not just you know, crappy briefcases with laptops sticking up.

665
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,022
Speaker 1: You know something.

666
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:21,453
Speaker 1: something won't get damaged something will be easier to use.

667
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:25,759
Speaker 1: and you know Deploy them on my paintball grounds and it'd be kind of fun.

668
00:46:26,081 --> 00:46:33,082
Speaker 0: Maybe some sort of you have them defending like a base cuz capture the flag paintballs actually kind of lame and I much I like that is.

669
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:41,196
Speaker 1: that is a good idea if you had some sort of base versus base paintball, but You put one of these sort of at the main entrance to the base.

670
00:46:41,578 --> 00:46:48,300
Speaker 1: therefore You know encouraging a different kind of play because people aren't gonna be sitting there Just covering the entry to the base the whole time.

671
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:56,720
Speaker 0: What I do is I put them kind of protecting the goal, you know Whatever the mission objective is, but there'd be the secondary objective of the switch that turns that thing on and off.

672
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:06,329
Speaker 0: So you have to storm like that outpost take the switch turn the sentry off and then you get a guard to switch So the enemy team doesn't come and turn it back on.

673
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,214
Speaker 1: that's pretty good.

674
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:08,239
Speaker 0: You know why I thought of that.

675
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:12,438
Speaker 0: Oh, I think that thing happened to me in tribes - yesterday is a good idea.

676
00:47:12,458 --> 00:47:12,800
Speaker 1: You ready?

677
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:20,112
Speaker 1: You have a sentry in the middle of the field, right and It's off and there's a switch in some sort of outpost.

678
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:22,300
Speaker 1: right and your actual goal is something else.

679
00:47:22,741 --> 00:47:34,179
Speaker 1: but if you get the switch pulled to you know to your team side the gun will aim at the enemy team and shoot them and Vice versa and make it color-sensitive because everyone wears red everywhere is blue you get that's not too hard.

680
00:47:34,842 --> 00:47:40,160
Speaker 0: So anyway tonight we're gonna talk kind of briefly because we want to long in the rest of it about my brand new blackberry curve.

681
00:47:40,602 --> 00:47:41,566
Speaker 1: Really how is it?

682
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:42,410
Speaker 0: It's okay.

683
00:47:42,631 --> 00:47:43,454
Speaker 1: Yeah, what does it do?

684
00:47:43,635 --> 00:47:47,409
Speaker 0: Google Reader and GPS Google Maps, and that's totally it really.

685
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:51,022
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't do Google Reader on my iPhone now Don't you?

686
00:47:51,042 --> 00:47:51,667
Speaker 1: well, I guess there.

687
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,440
Speaker 1: let me try going to reader dot google.com.

688
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:56,500
Speaker 1: I didn't try to go there because I haven't used Google Reader a long time.

689
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,668
Speaker 0: There's no Google Reader app for the iPhone.

690
00:47:59,089 --> 00:47:59,752
Speaker 1: No there is not.

691
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:09,359
Speaker 0: the only Google app is a Google search app Because they actually made a Google Reader app for the curve Which is that is the only thing that makes my curve useful outside of work and GPS.

692
00:48:10,142 --> 00:48:14,134
Speaker 1: That is the one thing that I sort of knew about the iPhone when I bought it right?

693
00:48:14,234 --> 00:48:14,595
Speaker 1: is that?

694
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,200
Speaker 1: and am I basically what?

695
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,790
Speaker 1: I knew is it's sort of like I knew something.

696
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:21,120
Speaker 1: I got the phone and I found out I was right.

697
00:48:21,644 --> 00:48:23,500
Speaker 1: Is that the iPhone does everything?

698
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:34,139
Speaker 1: Except it doesn't do the Google as well as the Android phone probably will and I use Google heavily like Google apps and whatnot But it does everything else just great.

699
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:36,147
Speaker 1: So, let's see let see.

700
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:38,300
Speaker 1: I kind of a lot of other place.

701
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,680
Speaker 1: I mean, it's been iPhone talk for two weeks and it's gonna be iPhone talk until next week.

702
00:48:43,142 --> 00:48:44,147
Speaker 1: So I kind of want to don't.

703
00:48:44,167 --> 00:48:46,759
Speaker 1: I don't want to say anything that's been said elsewhere.

704
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:53,740
Speaker 1: I want to sort of stick to things that no one else is gonna You know say you think did because otherwise why are we doing iPhone coverage?

705
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,000
Speaker 0: Yes, really Scott's not gonna talk about you zoom in like this and the 3g works like this.

706
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:03,540
Speaker 1: It's kind of lame to do iPhone coverage in the first place because it's just so much of it out there, right?

707
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:15,502
Speaker 1: But anyway, I went to get the iPhone on Friday last Friday And I wasn't stupid like everybody else waiting at the Apple store or showing up at like 730.

708
00:49:15,502 --> 00:49:20,340
Speaker 1: I went and I was at the AT&T store one block away from the Apple store.

709
00:49:20,922 --> 00:49:23,109
Speaker 1: I got there around 615.

710
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:28,949
Speaker 1: So maybe I waited 90 minutes a little more and There were five guys in line in front of me.

711
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,571
Speaker 1: That was it.

712
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:30,414
Speaker 1: That was it.

713
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,460
Speaker 1: at 8 o'clock They came out and they're like six people come right in now my boss.

714
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,979
Speaker 1: He came and got in line with me later because he lives right around there.

715
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:49,046
Speaker 1: So he was seventh in line Which is good because he was transferring his number from Sprint and his contract was up long ago like he's had it for years and years and years and So he took like 45 minutes.

716
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:50,933
Speaker 1: I only took like five minutes.

717
00:49:50,954 --> 00:49:51,516
Speaker 1: I went in.

718
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:52,680
Speaker 1: I talked to the guy.

719
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:56,960
Speaker 1: I said I wanted a brand new plan brand new number, you know, give me the phone.

720
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,866
Speaker 1: Okay, the SIM card.

721
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:01,153
Speaker 1: the phones are pre-loaded with SIM cards.

722
00:50:01,354 --> 00:50:03,180
Speaker 1: the SIM card in my phone must have been busted.

723
00:50:03,642 --> 00:50:08,380
Speaker 1: So he just took another SIM card switched out and it was all good and I've had no problems.

724
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:10,973
Speaker 1: I know some people having problems with the activation.

725
00:50:11,234 --> 00:50:12,299
Speaker 1: They got to the store too late.

726
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:15,380
Speaker 1: I know some people are having problems waiting in line.

727
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,239
Speaker 1: They went to an Apple store instead of an AT&T store and they went at a bad time.

728
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,066
Speaker 0: I saw people lined up today.

729
00:50:20,086 --> 00:50:23,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, people were like I went to the Apple store today to try to buy some accessories.

730
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:31,260
Speaker 1: I was half successful And there are people lined up for the iPhone, but there was a special sort of iPhone corner of the store.

731
00:50:31,381 --> 00:50:34,260
Speaker 1: But you could roam around the rest of the store, but anywhere in the store.

732
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:43,195
Speaker 1: They were like the area of the store where they were selling iPhone protective thingies Stupidly crowded couldn't get near there because it was a little tight little corner and people were crammed in.

733
00:50:43,256 --> 00:50:49,083
Speaker 1: it was it was not good but yeah, I got the phone and It works.

734
00:50:49,263 --> 00:50:51,049
Speaker 1: It's everything that everyone said.

735
00:50:51,069 --> 00:50:54,780
Speaker 1: it is the thing that really I think is most impressive about it.

736
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,000
Speaker 1: Is that again something I knew already?

737
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:02,900
Speaker 1: But actually in reality is much more impressive once you actually have it is not it does.

738
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,568
Speaker 1: There's not any one particular thing that it does.

739
00:51:05,588 --> 00:51:06,812
Speaker 1: that is incredibly amazing.

740
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:13,260
Speaker 1: Oh, actually the baseball thing is kind of amazing and Some of the like the urban spoon thing is kind of amazing.

741
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,696
Speaker 1: It's the number of things it does and does well because they think about.

742
00:51:17,756 --> 00:51:26,334
Speaker 1: right back in the day they start coming with the camera phones the music phones and People's complaint was you know, I'd rather have three separate things.

743
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:32,220
Speaker 1: if it does the separate thing Well, then have one thing that's supposed to do five things but does them all shittily.

744
00:51:32,742 --> 00:51:44,757
Speaker 1: It's like the attitude was if I can have a good phone and a good mp3 player and a good camera Why would I buy one device that is a shitty phone a shitty camera and a shitty mp3 player?

745
00:51:44,817 --> 00:51:45,840
Speaker 1: What's the point, right?

746
00:51:47,061 --> 00:51:47,783
Speaker 1: The iPhone?

747
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:59,840
Speaker 1: why it's so impressive even compared to other devices like blackberries or Nokia things Is that it is so many things but it is well at all of those things too.

748
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,946
Speaker 1: Well, and it has.

749
00:52:02,046 --> 00:52:03,029
Speaker 1: I believe you mean good.

750
00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:04,874
Speaker 1: No, I mean, well it is.

751
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:09,355
Speaker 1: Well, yes, it is quite well You know.

752
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:11,285
Speaker 1: and The when.

753
00:52:11,847 --> 00:52:14,497
Speaker 1: the other thing is that unlike say the Nokia n95?

754
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:21,400
Speaker 1: The integration between the different things is also super impressive.

755
00:52:21,701 --> 00:52:27,584
Speaker 1: So when you open up, I'll open up urban spoon, right urban spoon is one of the apps You can get from the app store.

756
00:52:27,906 --> 00:52:28,829
Speaker 1: you tell it a city.

757
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:33,386
Speaker 0: All right, so I'll choose to find some Mexican food and right.

758
00:52:33,648 --> 00:52:35,275
Speaker 1: so we tell me well, you can't do beacon.

759
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:36,260
Speaker 1: You can only do major cities.

760
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:37,684
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I pick New York City.

761
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,309
Speaker 1: I choose a neighborhood Harlem.

762
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,616
Speaker 1: I choose a type of food Korean.

763
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:42,780
Speaker 1: I choose a price.

764
00:52:43,883 --> 00:52:44,867
Speaker 1: I don't care about the price.

765
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:45,890
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna choose a price.

766
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:48,198
Speaker 1: then I shake the iPhone shake.

767
00:52:48,438 --> 00:52:48,880
Speaker 1: Come on shake.

768
00:52:49,404 --> 00:52:49,788
Speaker 1: There we go.

769
00:52:49,808 --> 00:52:53,810
Speaker 1: I Can go to the wah-wah canteen.

770
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,175
Speaker 1: All right, so I push ice.

771
00:52:55,235 --> 00:52:56,500
Speaker 1: touch wah-wah canteen.

772
00:52:57,162 --> 00:53:00,154
Speaker 1: It says serves curry and 54% of people like it.

773
00:53:00,174 --> 00:53:03,849
Speaker 1: There's the phone number and the address 54%.

774
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:07,520
Speaker 1: I know it's a pretty bad place But at least I know it's a bad place.

775
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:10,026
Speaker 1: Right if I touch that phone number it calls them.

776
00:53:10,648 --> 00:53:15,380
Speaker 1: if I touch that address it shows the Google map of exactly where they are.

777
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:18,134
Speaker 1: I can then push the GPS button.

778
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,260
Speaker 1: then push the directions button.

779
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:22,599
Speaker 1: It will give me directions from my current location to there.

780
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:31,125
Speaker 1: It does all these things but it ties them all together in a way that makes me if you had to do this on say The Nokia, right?

781
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,586
Speaker 1: Okay, so you'd go to a website Right or you'd install some.

782
00:53:35,606 --> 00:53:39,600
Speaker 1: so I don't even think there's an urban spoon application, but let's be generous and say there is okay.

783
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,704
Speaker 1: So there's an application.

784
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:41,929
Speaker 1: it tells you the restaurant.

785
00:53:42,411 --> 00:53:44,057
Speaker 1: then you got to go and open up.

786
00:53:44,861 --> 00:53:52,037
Speaker 1: You know the maps thing separately and type the address in and has a. you know I might have a little better keyboard than the iPhone does but it doesn't.

787
00:53:52,117 --> 00:53:53,684
Speaker 1: and you know Can you really?

788
00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:57,320
Speaker 1: can the Nokia or any of those other devices, you know, you search or something?

789
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,747
Speaker 1: There's a phone number you touch the phone number and it calls them.

790
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:01,051
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen.

791
00:54:01,493 --> 00:54:02,757
Speaker 1: I don't see that action anywhere.

792
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:05,568
Speaker 0: I Generally like using my curve.

793
00:54:06,171 --> 00:54:07,939
Speaker 0: It really can't do anything.

794
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,740
Speaker 0: Well, other than the blackberry thing of push email, right?

795
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:20,732
Speaker 1: That's the thing is I had a blackberry a pretty good one five thousand series something when I was working at that other company and It did email pretty well.

796
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:33,520
Speaker 1: and you know If I really needed it badly I could open up the web browser like in an emergency and there was actually an SSH client that wasn't free But it wasn't bad if I just didn't pay for it and it was actually a Gmail application.

797
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:48,979
Speaker 1: but it didn't work because I use Gmail for domains and the Google Maps was a little air, but it kind of worked and It technically speaking had a zillion features perhaps almost as many as the iPhone except of course for the you know, the video and the audio features.

798
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:54,580
Speaker 1: and The thing was though is because the features were sort of had a bad interface.

799
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:57,060
Speaker 1: They might as well not have been there.

800
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:01,000
Speaker 1: I have a cell phone right that I that I still haven't cancelled or done anything with yet.

801
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:01,603
Speaker 1: You know the mic.

802
00:55:01,704 --> 00:55:02,549
Speaker 1: I didn't port my number.

803
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:02,931
Speaker 1: I got new.

804
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:07,626
Speaker 1: I got a new AT&T and You know, it has a web browser.

805
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:08,950
Speaker 1: it has an mp3 player.

806
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:11,940
Speaker 1: I can take videos it can has a camera.

807
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:13,665
Speaker 1: It has a shit ton of stuff.

808
00:55:13,805 --> 00:55:17,817
Speaker 1: almost as much as you know, the smartphones do it as a calculator in there.

809
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:20,326
Speaker 1: all kinds of shit None of it.

810
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,300
Speaker 1: It might as well not be there.

811
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:33,300
Speaker 1: the only thing the phone is good for is making calls because despite having all those features the Interface of those features is so bad and so painful that it's not even worth using.

812
00:55:33,421 --> 00:55:34,410
Speaker 1: There's just that you might.

813
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:35,258
Speaker 1: it just don't do it.

814
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:35,741
Speaker 1: it did.

815
00:55:35,801 --> 00:55:52,519
Speaker 1: no, you know, this is why and and to prove that this is actually going on if you look at statistics right of all phones a very small percentage of phones out there mobile phones are smartphones and I think like 19% of smartphones are iPhones right now.

816
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,375
Speaker 1: So you're looking at like one in five of a very small segment are iPhones.

817
00:55:57,435 --> 00:55:58,760
Speaker 1: is not many of them out there?

818
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 1: Now look at the web traffic that is going to websites from mobile devices any mobile device no matter what?

819
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:13,580
Speaker 1: Like over 50% of web traffic to you know from mobile devices from iPhones.

820
00:56:14,545 --> 00:56:25,834
Speaker 1: that tells you that Even though pretty much every phone out there has a web browser of some kind Blackberry's got one Nokia's have one Symbian Windows mobiles have one.

821
00:56:25,874 --> 00:56:27,619
Speaker 1: my even my crappy cell phone has one.

822
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:35,200
Speaker 1: People aren't using them except for the people of iPhones are actually using mobile Safari because it's actually usable.

823
00:56:36,224 --> 00:56:46,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean on the PC will often complain about Apple because on the PC there's like this expectation that you should be able to do whatever you want and You're willing to suffer a little bad interface.

824
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:51,186
Speaker 1: Like I'm using handbrake interface is not so great I'm using you know, some other.

825
00:56:51,386 --> 00:56:53,814
Speaker 1: at Windows applications interface is not perfect.

826
00:56:53,854 --> 00:56:59,160
Speaker 1: Linux a lot of things command-line interface And which is good a lot of times but also bad sometimes.

827
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:12,200
Speaker 1: But it doesn't bother me because a mouse and a keyboard and a big screen You can get through that you can still manage to use the inner the crappy interface at a comfortable level that tiny little screen.

828
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:16,173
Speaker 1: But I know much on a tiny little screen, you know, sure.

829
00:57:16,193 --> 00:57:18,120
Speaker 1: I have to give up the fact that it's open.

830
00:57:18,482 --> 00:57:21,000
Speaker 1: I know that I'm not gonna be able to do whatever I want with it.

831
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,740
Speaker 1: There is an unfulfilled potential just like the unfulfilled potential of the Wii.

832
00:57:26,061 --> 00:57:41,880
Speaker 1: But because the interface is actually good Even though it might not have features that some other devices have on paper and the tech specs in Reality, it has a billion times more features than any of those things because the features it has are actually usable.

833
00:57:42,562 --> 00:57:52,931
Speaker 1: If you have a phone that can do a hundred things badly and painfully and a phone that can do five things really easily The phone is the foot that does the five things properly.

834
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:54,316
Speaker 1: is the phone you're gonna get?

835
00:57:54,336 --> 00:58:00,040
Speaker 1: because in reality It does five more things than the other phone when you get right down to it in practical speaking.

836
00:58:00,582 --> 00:58:02,007
Speaker 0: So what's is there?

837
00:58:02,047 --> 00:58:04,355
Speaker 0: anything like that is bad about it right now?

838
00:58:04,375 --> 00:58:05,560
Speaker 0: that isn't working right for you.

839
00:58:05,922 --> 00:58:16,988
Speaker 1: well, we got the exchange worked out which was Something that was mostly the the the works exchange server was testing all that now Right, but we got it to work.

840
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:19,680
Speaker 1: We just need to get the SSL signed and that sort of thing.

841
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:26,080
Speaker 1: One annoying thing that's really bothering me is that it has a built-in calendar thing, right?

842
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,972
Speaker 1: But this built-in calendar thing can't really work.

843
00:58:30,232 --> 00:58:32,300
Speaker 1: It works at the mobile me and it works with exchange.

844
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:37,052
Speaker 1: It doesn't work with Google Calendar, and there's no reason.

845
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:38,877
Speaker 1: there's no technological reason that it couldn't.

846
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:40,522
Speaker 1: it could very easily But it doesn't.

847
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:42,792
Speaker 1: and there are ways out there people are.

848
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:47,492
Speaker 1: there's many many different methods of Synchronizing iPhone with Google Calendar many of them.

849
00:58:48,074 --> 00:58:49,319
Speaker 1: There's one really good one.

850
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,239
Speaker 1: That really good one requires that you have a Mac.

851
00:58:52,722 --> 00:59:00,058
Speaker 1: And in fact, I went to the website for this thing and it said oh for all you Windows users get a Mac And it's like fuck you.

852
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:03,672
Speaker 1: So yeah, I can't use Google Calendar with it.

853
00:59:03,793 --> 00:59:04,797
Speaker 1: And that's something I knew.

854
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:07,767
Speaker 1: Google Integration with it is rather poor.

855
00:59:07,787 --> 00:59:12,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're just sad because Google apps is pretty much the lifeblood of my internet.

856
00:59:12,601 --> 00:59:16,900
Speaker 1: It is that really if I could get the Google apps on here more seriously, I'd be much better off now.

857
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:22,220
Speaker 0: Hey Google, I'd pay a lot of money just to have it work I know but I think Google's more on their Android.

858
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,340
Speaker 1: The thing is Google did make a search app for this so they're making a search app and they got their maps on here.

859
00:59:27,641 --> 00:59:29,148
Speaker 1: Why not put the other apps on here?

860
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:35,656
Speaker 1: Come on, you know that there was an article I read today That was actually saying hey Google, you know keep going with the Android.

861
00:59:35,696 --> 00:59:36,420
Speaker 1: that's all good.

862
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:41,680
Speaker 1: But the way Google got so big is they they did the daffodil method.

863
00:59:41,801 --> 00:59:43,680
Speaker 1: We don't care where these grow.

864
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:52,971
Speaker 1: You just want to grow anywhere we can possibly grow and by not growing on the iPhone as much as they possibly could Google is Sort of missing out, but I'm not too worried about Google.

865
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:53,995
Speaker 1: Actually.

866
00:59:54,036 --> 00:59:55,020
Speaker 1: I was kind of surprised.

867
00:59:56,202 --> 01:00:02,548
Speaker 1: There are a lot of websites that are like specifically designed to work Well on the iPhone like meebo.com.

868
01:00:02,588 --> 01:00:06,340
Speaker 1: if you visit it on the iPhone you would swear that it's an app.

869
01:00:06,662 --> 01:00:07,228
Speaker 1: But it's not.

870
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,379
Speaker 1: it's actually just a website.

871
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:12,534
Speaker 1: Cuz meebo.com is done so well and Gmail is the same way.

872
01:00:12,574 --> 01:00:22,940
Speaker 1: if I go to my Google Mail in the browser It's it actually feels and looks like an app, you know It doesn't feel and look like a website that I'm looking at in a browser and I have to zoom in and stuff like that.

873
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:27,100
Speaker 1: It actually works properly and there's a lot of sites like that and they're pretty good.

874
01:00:28,062 --> 01:00:34,600
Speaker 1: The thing is is I also tried to set up my Google Mail through the built-in mail application, you know and use the I map.

875
01:00:35,523 --> 01:00:37,007
Speaker 1: That actually worked better.

876
01:00:37,148 --> 01:00:38,271
Speaker 1: I think than visiting.

877
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:44,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean sure I can't like, you know What they did that Google is very smart about right?

878
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:51,020
Speaker 1: Is that even though I don't have the sort of interface like starring things or that sort of stuff, right?

879
01:00:51,882 --> 01:01:01,300
Speaker 1: They sort of matched up the I map interface with the real interface so I can't click report trash But I can move something to the spam folder report spam.

880
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,460
Speaker 1: But I can move something to the spam folder and on Google's end a report spam.

881
01:01:06,327 --> 01:01:14,819
Speaker 1: so because the Email app the default, you know built into the iPhone one is really good at reading my gmails on there is not so bad.

882
01:01:16,902 --> 01:01:22,227
Speaker 1: Something that is kind of bad is the camera doesn't do video which my shitty phone did Which is kind of sad.

883
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:24,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how often did you use that?

884
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:27,119
Speaker 1: Not often but on the iPhone I would use it.

885
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:32,578
Speaker 1: You know, it's things that my other phone did but because the iPhone now does them I do use them.

886
01:01:32,979 --> 01:01:41,560
Speaker 1: you see I have that car audio link thing that I use with my old iPod, you know to play music over the in-car speakers.

887
01:01:42,541 --> 01:01:44,860
Speaker 1: That actually works really well with the iPhone.

888
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:53,548
Speaker 1: In fact, I think it works better with the iPhone But it doesn't charge the iPhone which on a long trip is gonna kill me because People are right.

889
01:01:53,568 --> 01:01:55,480
Speaker 1: the battery life on this, right?

890
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:56,843
Speaker 1: It won't.

891
01:01:56,904 --> 01:02:07,579
Speaker 1: if you don't charge it in at morning and at night You're gonna have trouble right and that's the thing is for my average 99% of the time That's gonna be adequate for me.

892
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:10,330
Speaker 0: That's not good for trips though because I'll like.

893
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:13,642
Speaker 0: the one thing about my blackberry is I'll take it out of town for a whole Weekend.

894
01:02:14,124 --> 01:02:18,060
Speaker 0: battery will be fine the whole weekend and then I get home and then I plug it in again.

895
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,650
Speaker 1: Yep, the thing is when I think about my real situation, right?

896
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,814
Speaker 1: I always travel everywhere with cords to charge everything So that's not a problem.

897
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:36,916
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's say I go to my average day charge it in the morning charge it while I'm at work charge it When I'm at home, it only really uses battery and I'm on the train.

898
01:02:37,077 --> 01:02:37,660
Speaker 1: That's fine.

899
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,160
Speaker 1: It barely is any battery for two train rides, right?

900
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:47,920
Speaker 1: If I go to a convention I'm not gonna be pulling out of my pocket that often and I'll be charging it in the morning and at the night.

901
01:02:48,423 --> 01:02:50,135
Speaker 1: So it'll make it through a convention.

902
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:50,840
Speaker 0: What do you mean at the night?

903
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,216
Speaker 0: So we get back to the room at like 4 a.m.

904
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,520
Speaker 0: You charge it for four hours and then we're back up and at the con again, it'll be alright.

905
01:02:57,123 --> 01:02:58,288
Speaker 1: It doesn't take that long to charge.

906
01:02:58,348 --> 01:02:58,509
Speaker 1: Actually.

907
01:02:58,529 --> 01:03:00,197
Speaker 1: I haven't checked how long it takes to charge.

908
01:03:00,237 --> 01:03:00,900
Speaker 1: That's something to look at.

909
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,285
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone made a website.

910
01:03:02,666 --> 01:03:16,480
Speaker 1: I'm sure but yeah, but when you look get right down to it, though You can conserve battery life if you want by like disabling the 3g radio Disabling the Wi-Fi turning off the Bluetooth, you know, that's her so you can turn the brightness down.

911
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:18,932
Speaker 1: There's a lot of ways that you can save the battery.

912
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:20,540
Speaker 1: if you know, you're gonna be out for a long time.

913
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:24,797
Speaker 1: Don't watch videos, you know, don't use the GPS All right.

914
01:03:26,561 --> 01:03:31,238
Speaker 1: And when you really look at the competition look at the other smartphones that have 3g.

915
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:31,519
Speaker 1: in them.

916
01:03:32,082 --> 01:03:38,150
Speaker 1: The battery life is worse than the iPhone the iPhone 3g While it doesn't have as good battery life as the original iPhone.

917
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:41,060
Speaker 1: It beats every single other 3g smartphone.

918
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:44,614
Speaker 0: Well, we can talk a lot about how 3g works, but we'll save that for another show.

919
01:03:44,976 --> 01:03:46,040
Speaker 1: 3g is just faster.

920
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,891
Speaker 1: It means I can browse the web when there's no wireless access.

921
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:52,820
Speaker 0: I'm talking about why it uses more batteries specifically.

922
01:03:53,322 --> 01:03:53,824
Speaker 1: Okay.

923
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:57,360
Speaker 1: Well anything that's faster and wireless is usually uses more electricity.

924
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:03,052
Speaker 1: Other things I don't like is that there's you can't remove the built-in apps.

925
01:04:03,112 --> 01:04:11,254
Speaker 1: like it comes at the iTunes, you know store I'm never gonna buy anything from the iTunes music store ever, but I can't remove the icon.

926
01:04:11,615 --> 01:04:13,540
Speaker 1: you see there's a stocks app.

927
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:14,899
Speaker 1: I can't remove the icon.

928
01:04:15,462 --> 01:04:27,388
Speaker 1: Actually, I think I can use the parental control setting to remove the iTunes icon But I can't move the stocks icon, which is like it's in the way I want it, you know, I sort of moved it to the other screen where I don't go so often But it's still there.

929
01:04:27,408 --> 01:04:29,801
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

930
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:32,749
Speaker 1: Is there anything else really interesting to say about it?

931
01:04:33,231 --> 01:04:37,041
Speaker 1: Basically, it's just so amazing the wide variety of things It does.

932
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:41,635
Speaker 1: well, I mean, it's an iPod that plays audio and video amazingly.

933
01:04:41,675 --> 01:04:42,939
Speaker 1: I'm so glad I got the 16 gig.

934
01:04:43,601 --> 01:04:46,020
Speaker 1: I can fit two entire anime series on here.

935
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:51,460
Speaker 1: I have all of Evangelion and all of Escaflowne and four Evangelion director's cut episodes.

936
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:59,780
Speaker 1: I ripped them from the DVDs and I put them on here and I have a cable that goes from this to the television And I just tried it and it totally works.

937
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:10,233
Speaker 1: So I can like go to a hotel and plug this tiny thing into a TV and watch Full anime series with no disk switching on a TV.

938
01:05:10,734 --> 01:05:11,957
Speaker 1: It's just unbelievable.

939
01:05:12,098 --> 01:05:13,000
Speaker 1: Absolutely unbelievable.

940
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:15,411
Speaker 0: So you've been watching some of that there Escaflowne?

941
01:05:15,472 --> 01:05:16,818
Speaker 1: I watched episode one of the choo-choo.

942
01:05:17,542 --> 01:05:19,089
Speaker 0: Ah, it was 45 minutes long wasn't?

943
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:20,436
Speaker 0: I remember the first episode as long?

944
01:05:20,517 --> 01:05:21,160
Speaker 1: it is quite long.

945
01:05:22,621 --> 01:05:26,335
Speaker 1: There's an application called Twitterific that has a free version and a pay version.

946
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:34,688
Speaker 1: the pay version gets rid of the ads but they didn't put enough ads in the free version to annoy me into paying for the non free one and It just uses Twitter.

947
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:43,364
Speaker 1: but having this Suddenly makes the Twitter make sense for some reason like I'm using it like crazy like every time I'll turn the phone on I'll check it.

948
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:45,019
Speaker 0: pooping poop is coming out.

949
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:48,952
Speaker 1: No It's actually like good stuff going on now and it's like all people.

950
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:54,010
Speaker 1: pretty much almost everyone is using the Twitterific With the Twitter now because everyone has the iPhones and it's.

951
01:05:54,391 --> 01:05:58,807
Speaker 1: it's kind of crazy and it's it's you know You you can po it's really.

952
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:02,300
Speaker 1: I can't take a picture of something and then it will immediately.

953
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:07,560
Speaker 1: It'll add the picture to the Twitter message that I just took with the phone and then I can push another button.

954
01:06:07,861 --> 01:06:10,469
Speaker 1: It'll add my current location to the Twitter message.

955
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:15,445
Speaker 1: So if I see something cool and on the street, I take a picture I push the button I click send.

956
01:06:15,766 --> 01:06:19,336
Speaker 1: everyone knows that cool thing is right there like instantly.

957
01:06:19,917 --> 01:06:20,800
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome.

958
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:24,953
Speaker 1: This is the same thing that plays video when you plug it into a television.

959
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:26,980
Speaker 1: is the same thing that makes phone calls.

960
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:28,666
Speaker 1: It's the same thing that browses the web.

961
01:06:28,886 --> 01:06:30,291
Speaker 1: the same thing that checks email.

962
01:06:30,532 --> 01:06:35,317
Speaker 1: the same thing that gets all the baseball highlights From the games as they're going on.

963
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:39,120
Speaker 1: It's the same thing that can tell you where the restaurants are.

964
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:41,289
Speaker 1: It's the same thing that I can write notes in.

965
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:42,915
Speaker 1: the same thing remembers all my contacts.

966
01:06:42,935 --> 01:06:43,859
Speaker 1: the same thing that runs aim.

967
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:44,966
Speaker 1: the same It tells me the weather.

968
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:50,446
Speaker 1: the same thing that can remotely control The iTunes on my desktop computer when I'm lying in bed.

969
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:54,124
Speaker 1: the same thing with a calculator and a clock and It's it's.

970
01:06:54,204 --> 01:07:02,223
Speaker 1: you know, it looks big when they show you pictures of it but really I put it up next to my old cell phone, which is a flip phone and the flip.

971
01:07:02,263 --> 01:07:10,460
Speaker 1: this cell phone when flipped closed is actually like Almost as big as this thing like if you could flip the iPhone in half.

972
01:07:11,002 --> 01:07:15,897
Speaker 1: I think it actually takes up like it would be less space in your pocket than my flip phone.

973
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:16,980
Speaker 1: It's kind of crazy.

974
01:07:18,341 --> 01:07:20,669
Speaker 1: You can also send people money with PayPal on it.

975
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone knows that.

976
01:07:22,274 --> 01:07:25,525
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's one thing Yes, which is crazy.

977
01:07:25,605 --> 01:07:30,783
Speaker 1: And the only reason that's the crazy thing about I mean, there are things it can't do plenty of things It can't do that.

978
01:07:30,803 --> 01:07:33,353
Speaker 1: It should be able to do for example cunnilingus.

979
01:07:33,553 --> 01:07:33,875
Speaker 1: Yes.

980
01:07:34,457 --> 01:07:42,800
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I mean like People with the Nokia's right they can do that quick thing where they can stream live video to the web from their phone.

981
01:07:43,285 --> 01:07:44,499
Speaker 1: iPhone can't do that, right?

982
01:07:45,525 --> 01:07:46,699
Speaker 1: It doesn't do the Google Apps.

983
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,832
Speaker 1: It doesn't have turn-by-turn GPS though.

984
01:07:49,873 --> 01:07:51,079
Speaker 1: That might be coming soon.

985
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:57,006
Speaker 1: There are a lot of apps that are possible that just aren't written yet It can't.

986
01:07:57,067 --> 01:07:58,480
Speaker 1: it doesn't have flash, right?

987
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,609
Speaker 1: So you pretty much the only videos you can.

988
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:03,000
Speaker 1: the only flash you can do is is a YouTube client.

989
01:08:03,442 --> 01:08:07,036
Speaker 1: So I can watch a YouTube video, but I can't watch any other kind of flash anything.
