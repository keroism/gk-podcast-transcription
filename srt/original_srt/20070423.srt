1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,588
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 23rd.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,632
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:20,380
Speaker 0: I'm rim, and this is geek nights Tonight we attempt to teach you quite hastily about Linux package management.

4
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:23,557
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:27,350
Speaker 1: Well in the course of the last several hours.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,758
Speaker 1: We've generated a great number of noteworthy events in our lives.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:41,140
Speaker 0: Yes, not only that but over the weekend we generated quite a few noteworthy bits But we can't even talk about them because well the things that just happened are far more exciting.

8
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:49,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we could have talked about the Mets game or gaming for hope But no or we could even talk about the fire that happened near our house.

9
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:54,798
Speaker 1: Yep, a fire happened near our house, but then a fire almost happened inside our house.

10
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:58,080
Speaker 0: Well Not quite the same variety of fire.

11
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:06,158
Speaker 1: Well you see a way way back at our IT This computer that I'm using now for the show the terrible computer that is.

12
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,413
Speaker 0: Listen to any old episode and you'll hear about it.

13
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:14,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've had issues with this computer Just because I built this computer before I went to college.

14
00:01:15,072 --> 00:01:17,700
Speaker 0: I built well you replaced the most important bits.

15
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, I replaced the motherboard with almost the same motherboard in like 2001.

16
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:24,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what the processor.

17
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,356
Speaker 1: I got was Oh 200 megahertz faster and otherwise mostly identical.

18
00:01:28,396 --> 00:01:31,480
Speaker 0: yes the computer is Regardless old and terrible.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,990
Speaker 1: Back at our IT It is starting to have some problems with cooling because it's a gigantic case.

20
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,387
Speaker 1: and I no longer need a gigantic case because gigantic cases Are no longer necessary.

21
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:47,249
Speaker 0: No one gets the gigantic cases anymore No one unless you're making it even the giant servers.

22
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,373
Speaker 0: everyone uses rackmount.

23
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:50,520
Speaker 0: No one uses full tower cases anymore.

24
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,323
Speaker 1: Well, it used to be.

25
00:01:51,364 --> 00:01:55,060
Speaker 1: you'd have like seven external drives if you were a geek, but now I have one.

26
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:59,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe yeah, I mean you have the DVD CD burner.

27
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:04,200
Speaker 0: well cuz way back You need used to need to have like four or five and a quarter floppy drives.

28
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:05,132
Speaker 0: You could load all those.

29
00:02:05,477 --> 00:02:14,600
Speaker 1: well You'd always have like your CD ROM or your DVD ROM and then you'd have your burner Which was separate and you'd always use both of them especially when games that needed two CDs.

30
00:02:15,103 --> 00:02:16,431
Speaker 1: A lot of people had the zip drive.

31
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,558
Speaker 1: you had the live drive.

32
00:02:17,578 --> 00:02:23,095
Speaker 1: Yeah You had that annoying hard drive cooler kit that just made a bunch of noise.

33
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,380
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah I don't know why I forgot that.

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:31,069
Speaker 0: Oh, it's right because back in the day people used to tell you that if you had a 7200 rpm drive you needed to cool it or it would crash.

35
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:37,822
Speaker 0: and Well, I don't know if that's true because I have a lot of 7200 rpm drives and a lot of people have them and they aren't Cooling them.

36
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:38,888
Speaker 0: They don't seem to be crashing.

37
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,360
Speaker 0: However that drive that was in that cooler.

38
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:44,380
Speaker 0: It's not in that cooler anymore, but it's working pretty well.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,809
Speaker 0: Still that 20 gig old drive is going.

40
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:52,040
Speaker 1: so in colony where we used to live at our IT Every year we didn't have air conditioning.

41
00:02:52,121 --> 00:03:00,363
Speaker 1: So once it became summer and it started getting warm There would be a periodic event where Scott and I would be playing counter-strike or tribes 2 or whatever We were playing at the time

42
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:01,809
Speaker 0: was the counter-strike in those days and

43
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:20,301
Speaker 1: in the middle of the game suddenly you would start hearing That was the sound of my motherboard warning me through the PC speaker that my processor or Something on my computer was dangerously hot and was overheating.

44
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:23,550
Speaker 1: and my computer was now reaching a critical and dangerous state.

45
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:27,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that CPU in there is an Athlon Thunderbird.

46
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,760
Speaker 0: Yes, they might as well call it the Athlon Firebird.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,509
Speaker 1: back then it was an 800 megahertz Athlon Which wasn't much better?

48
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:44,462
Speaker 1: no, no, no, but the worst part was it would happen and I'd be in the middle of a game of counter-strike and I'm not gonna quit cuz I'm doing great.

49
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:46,089
Speaker 1: I'm up in his base killing his dudes.

50
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:55,863
Speaker 0: I actually blame the pre XP Athlons for the fad of cooling CPUs Ludicrously because those actually needed it not until the XP.

51
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,190
Speaker 0: could you get away with normal cooling on an Athlon?

52
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,374
Speaker 1: I'd imagine the scenario.

53
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:00,499
Speaker 1: I'm playing a game.

54
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,383
Speaker 1: I'm doing well.

55
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:02,850
Speaker 1: The alarm is going off.

56
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:05,302
Speaker 1: Scott is laughing because the alarm is going off.

57
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:06,629
Speaker 1: I am playing the game.

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:15,342
Speaker 1: I don't want to stop playing the game, but every second I continue to play There's the chance that my computer will either burn itself out catch fire or break.

59
00:04:15,783 --> 00:04:24,949
Speaker 0: Yep, because remember we talked about how Athlons will just set on fire while Intel's, you know, though they might overheat but they won't break from overheating.

60
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,350
Speaker 1: now Luckily after about after one summer the next summer it happened again even earlier because the computer was in further disrepair.

61
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,386
Speaker 1: Remember the whole time that this computer I still used to do geek nights.

62
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:46,669
Speaker 1: But anyway So I solved the problem and very simply all I did was go into the BIOS and set the danger threshold Seven degrees centigrade higher and the alarm stopped going off.

63
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:49,078
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's real smart, I know.

64
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,136
Speaker 0: let's turn off all the safety mechanisms that way if something bad happens We just won't know about it.

65
00:04:54,256 --> 00:04:55,883
Speaker 0: You know, what could possibly go wrong?

66
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,067
Speaker 0: out of sight out of mind?

67
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:57,710
Speaker 0: Chernobyl.

68
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,180
Speaker 1: Possibly that was perhaps the first thing that's ever gone wrong.

69
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:03,662
Speaker 0: Yeah.

70
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,010
Speaker 1: Well that actually worked pretty well.

71
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,245
Speaker 1: The computer is fairly robust and it didn't destroy itself though.

72
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,250
Speaker 1: There were a few close calls.

73
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,530
Speaker 0: It's working right now, but I'm not betting on how long that's gonna remain true.

74
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:20,683
Speaker 1: I cleaned the computer a year and a half ago and also the video card.

75
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:23,010
Speaker 1: it died due to overheating, huh?

76
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:32,409
Speaker 1: So I replaced the video card sadly with a GeForce 4 which is like a thousand times faster than that video card was.

77
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is the GeForce 4 for like $30.

78
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:36,981
Speaker 0: Yeah.

79
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,850
Speaker 1: Yeah that things made the rounds of the computers in our house.

80
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,155
Speaker 1: It's like the backup video card.

81
00:05:41,295 --> 00:05:42,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh crap.

82
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:48,279
Speaker 0: We need video cards to put in computers, but we don't actually care How you know if the computers can do 3d or not?

83
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:51,230
Speaker 0: I know let's get GeForce 4. is there 30 bucks?

84
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,402
Speaker 0: They work with the Nvidia driver legs that ATI card.

85
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,485
Speaker 1: that was dick and worth.

86
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:57,870
Speaker 0: Oh that thing was such ass.

87
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,074
Speaker 0: That's why we bought the GeForce.

88
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:03,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we after spending three days trying to make that stupid ATI work in Linux.

89
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,555
Speaker 0: Well, we try it worked.

90
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,982
Speaker 0: We couldn't get the TV out to work.

91
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:07,769
Speaker 1: We also couldn't get acceleration to work.

92
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't try to get accelerate.

93
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,868
Speaker 1: Well, cuz that FGLRX.

94
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,761
Speaker 0: meanwhile We put that in video card in without doing anything.

95
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:14,585
Speaker 0: it just worked.

96
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,256
Speaker 0: just dang immediately There was output on the TV screen.

97
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:17,899
Speaker 0: That was correct.

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,310
Speaker 0: So yeah ATI you suck.

99
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,800
Speaker 1: But yeah, the computer is working pretty well.

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:36,409
Speaker 1: And once I replaced the burnt-out video card It didn't overheat nearly so much anymore Because the video card was actually the significant factor which as I discovered the fan on the video card Once I took it out had probably not spun in at least three years.

101
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:38,357
Speaker 1: It was you.

102
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,529
Speaker 1: you couldn't even spin it with your finger.

103
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:44,650
Speaker 0: You should have just used the TNT to which only can get away with passive cooling.

104
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:47,285
Speaker 1: I did for a little while and then I put this thing and I forget why.

105
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,170
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

106
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,217
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe the TNT to you complained.

107
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:51,462
Speaker 0: It didn't work with the Nvidia driver.

108
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:52,486
Speaker 0: So well might have been.

109
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,453
Speaker 1: I'm I don't even remember It does.

110
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:55,375
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter.

111
00:06:55,636 --> 00:06:56,318
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

112
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:58,104
Speaker 1: So now the first hot day.

113
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,268
Speaker 1: it was actually surprising.

114
00:06:59,308 --> 00:06:59,729
Speaker 1: look 80 degrees.

115
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,195
Speaker 0: It was super warm today.

116
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:02,662
Speaker 0: I wore shorts and a t-shirt to work.

117
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:03,305
Speaker 0: It was great.

118
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:04,270
Speaker 0: Everything's awesome.

119
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,595
Speaker 0: I'm like super happy.

120
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:07,622
Speaker 0: The cold is finally over.

121
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:08,525
Speaker 0: knock on wood.

122
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:13,758
Speaker 1: Yep, hot damn I mean even I didn't get to take the train home Even though I'm gonna start taking the train to work.

123
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,910
Speaker 1: so I had to drive home, but I drove past the mountain.

124
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:23,550
Speaker 1: So I stopped and I climbed the mountain and then I learned something this mountain I go this hill for the one person who likes to argue or whatever.

125
00:07:24,172 --> 00:07:26,058
Speaker 1: It's all a rock without many trees.

126
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,402
Speaker 0: the rocks heated up.

127
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:29,027
Speaker 0: the rocks heated up and they were hot.

128
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:35,870
Speaker 1: and on the top of the Where there wasn't any wind because there's another Ridge kind of block you burn you're like burning your feet on the rock.

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,403
Speaker 1: It was like a hundred degrees and it was like an oven cooking me.

130
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:41,390
Speaker 1: It was awesome and a little bit horrible.

131
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I have this actually logitech like V. I think it's 550.

132
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:52,610
Speaker 0: It's like a little mouse that comes with a really fancy Numpad, right and I bought one a long time ago to go with my laptop.

133
00:07:52,991 --> 00:07:59,162
Speaker 0: But I lost the mouse and I also lost the wireless trans EV bit and I paid like $60 for it way back in the day.

134
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,612
Speaker 0: now, it's only $30.

135
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:02,949
Speaker 0: So when I lost the mouse, I just said whatever and I bought a new one.

136
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:05,012
Speaker 0: So now I have two numpads.

137
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:12,730
Speaker 0: so I just leave one numpad at home one at work and I carry the mouse back and forth and The numpad is actually really cool and that it's also a calculator.

138
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:17,089
Speaker 0: It's also, you know a multimedia controller with play pause mute volume, whatever.

139
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,319
Speaker 0: But it's also has a thermometer in it and a clock.

140
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,365
Speaker 0: the thermometer work was like 82.

141
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:32,183
Speaker 1: I was like god damn God damn, so I finally get home today And my computer had been off all weekend because despite the fact that the cooling doesn't work.

142
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,630
Speaker 1: It's really really loud.

143
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,664
Speaker 1: So I had it off all weekend, which is always dangerous.

144
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,461
Speaker 1: whenever I turn this thing off There's like a 40% chance.

145
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,809
Speaker 1: It doesn't come back up when I turn.

146
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,456
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you have a junky old car.

147
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:50,990
Speaker 0: if it's running it'll keep running it won't you know, unless it's weirdly junky It'll stall maybe but it's not gonna just break down while it's going.

148
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,358
Speaker 1: Hell a lot of old junky cars.

149
00:08:52,378 --> 00:08:54,170
Speaker 1: when you turn them off they keep going for a while.

150
00:08:54,431 --> 00:09:00,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but if it's off good luck getting it started again, yeah and computers are the same.

151
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,976
Speaker 1: That's why if you have an old server.

152
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:02,559
Speaker 1: little hint.

153
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:08,230
Speaker 1: if anyone ever gets in the IT industry you have an old server That's important and hasn't been touched in a long time.

154
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:12,930
Speaker 1: Don't even fucking think about turning that thing off until you have a backup up and running.

155
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,095
Speaker 1: Yeah, good.

156
00:09:14,196 --> 00:09:17,249
Speaker 1: God has that bitten me in the ass enough for me to learn my lesson.

157
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:20,730
Speaker 1: Then I come home and I turn the computer on and I'm using it.

158
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:26,530
Speaker 1: Everything's fine, and I watch some dig videos and the dig videos start skipping a little bit and skip it a little bit more.

159
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:34,174
Speaker 0: and then As soon as that went off that was so priceless I was like ah shit What are we gonna do?

160
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,170
Speaker 0: the show we gotta go at the Mac for downstairs?

161
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, or we could use Jameson who has probably the worst sound card ever made.

162
00:09:40,552 --> 00:09:42,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a pretty bad sound card on that computer.

163
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,359
Speaker 0: I blame it mostly on the $20 motherboard.

164
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:48,729
Speaker 1: the first thing Scott says is why don't you just turn off the PC speaker?

165
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:52,507
Speaker 1: Which I did and then the computer crashed about 45 seconds later.

166
00:09:53,612 --> 00:09:55,199
Speaker 1: Awesome, and I stick my hand under there.

167
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,349
Speaker 1: and of all things with the geforce 4 overheating.

168
00:09:57,751 --> 00:10:01,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe that's just where the heat pooled up because of the air channels.

169
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:04,082
Speaker 1: in the case I think so cuz it burned me it hurt.

170
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:05,370
Speaker 1: I have a little red mark on my finger.

171
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:08,603
Speaker 0: I've burned myself on quite a few CPUs, but more often.

172
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,130
Speaker 0: I've hurt myself on course fan.

173
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:13,289
Speaker 1: I also noticed that the CPU is a solid mass of dust.

174
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,474
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:10:16,056 --> 00:10:16,565
Speaker 0: So right

176
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:28,005
Speaker 1: now I don't think we'll be able to hear it after the post-production in the show But I currently have the fan that is normally in my window Which I use when it's warm enough for a fan But not so warm or humid that I need the AC on.

177
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:28,990
Speaker 0: so I like to keep my way.

178
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:34,235
Speaker 1: I didn't put the AC in the window yet now me either, but I'm gonna cuz when the humidity comes There's gonna be rain at some point.

179
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:34,817
Speaker 0: Yeah.

180
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:35,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, God.

181
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,230
Speaker 1: I gotta get a new computer before the humidity god damn.

182
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:39,597
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do so.

183
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:45,189
Speaker 1: now that fan is sitting next to my case Which I open both sides up, and I don't have an air channel going through it.

184
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:46,014
Speaker 0: That's good

185
00:10:46,235 --> 00:11:00,903
Speaker 1: however unlike a certain unnamed friend of mine And a little another little hint for all you kids out there if your computer is overheating It is not that bad of an idea to get a box fan or something and stick it next to your case and open up Both sides and just get air blasting through.

186
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:01,970
Speaker 1: it's a good temporary fix.

187
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:05,596
Speaker 0: It is a good temporary fix But do not make it your permanent fix.

188
00:11:05,657 --> 00:11:16,650
Speaker 1: more importantly do not make it so that it is touching your case Or is close to your case because one thing that plastic spinning fans are good at generating is static electricity.

189
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:19,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, that could ruin it pretty quickly right really quick.

190
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:20,140
Speaker 1: Good.

191
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,682
Speaker 1: God.

192
00:11:21,043 --> 00:11:23,490
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna name names, but someone got fucked by that.

193
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:31,181
Speaker 0: Yeah You want to keep the box fan because the box fan blows so much volume of air That it doesn't need to be right up against the computer.

194
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,330
Speaker 0: You could put it like a foot back two feet back.

195
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:40,444
Speaker 0: It won't be close enough to shock anything And it'll still blow more air than all the fans in your computer could ever hope to blow.

196
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:42,650
Speaker 1: now luckily might remembered way back.

197
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,438
Speaker 1: I'm segueing here into the news that I kept saying that April 22nd is the day April 22nd.

198
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:56,110
Speaker 1: according to various leaked sources and according well according to the calendar April 22nd was yesterday Exactly, which we didn't do a show yesterday.

199
00:11:56,833 --> 00:12:00,710
Speaker 1: But they kept saying oh Intel's gonna have price drops Intel's gonna have price drops.

200
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,785
Speaker 1: And I kept saying it and I was excited and I said if it happens.

201
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:04,870
Speaker 1: I'm gonna buy a computer.

202
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:24,910
Speaker 1: Well sure enough yesterday Intel announced gigantic price cuts across the core two and quad-core lines and they introduced a bunch of new chips and sure enough immediately on Newegg the E6600 which I'm convinced is the absolute sweet spot with one possible exception that Scott pointed out in terms of price for power

203
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:25,572
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

204
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:30,066
Speaker 1: so I thought hot damn gonna buy my computer within an hour.

205
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:36,750
Speaker 1: It sold out on Newegg Looks to be in stock right now, but I just checked and I got the auto notify email saying it's back in stock.

206
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,820
Speaker 0: Well who knows how long that's gonna remain true?

207
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:47,090
Speaker 1: yep, so in the next three days I say three days because I still have to pick a motherboard Which is not as easy as I thought and I still have to pick all this other stuff.

208
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,881
Speaker 1: But I'm getting a new computer.

209
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:50,450
Speaker 1: so the timing was perfect.

210
00:12:50,811 --> 00:13:00,000
Speaker 1: And I think I'm going with the core two because even though the XP's are still cheaper, and they still perform almost as well I really feel better going with Intel this time.

211
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:01,786
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think AMD.

212
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:03,682
Speaker 0: They just need to do something I don't know.

213
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:15,110
Speaker 1: Well the thing is the AMD chips for a similar performance draw more than twice as much power Require a lot more cooling and just feel like they're not gonna scale very well in the future.

214
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:27,850
Speaker 0: I think what it is is you know the AMD does still seem to win on the price performance ratio But it the Intel is just so fast and so it doesn't feel like there's anything wrong with it at all.

215
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:30,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it feels like it's worth the price.

216
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,870
Speaker 0: You're paying for the all the other stuff that goes along with it.

217
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:45,510
Speaker 1: It's not like the late Pentium 3 early Pentium 4 days where a Pentium chip cost four times as much and wasn't even as fast Or like the late Pentium 4 days where a Pentium 4 cost four times as much and wasn't that much faster at all.

218
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:57,329
Speaker 1: Yep, and the other I mean while AMD based motherboards are still a lot cheaper They're not that much cheaper and actually the Intel motherboards are starting to look a lot more impressive to me.

219
00:13:58,013 --> 00:13:58,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's.

220
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,430
Speaker 0: you know I really not even get an enforce.

221
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:09,915
Speaker 0: I know that's the thing is like I always For all for the past how many years I felt like enforce is the chipset to get and in many cases Enforce is still the chipset to get.

222
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:18,022
Speaker 0: when you start looking at the motherboards the enforce chipset really rocks with the AMD processors But it's kind of normal with the Intel processors.

223
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,910
Speaker 0: It's also overpriced with the Intel process.

224
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,518
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean the the newest series of enforces.

225
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:29,720
Speaker 1: the motherboards that supported fully are in the 200 $300 range And I've never paid that much for a motherboard, and I never will.

226
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:44,618
Speaker 0: yep, and the thing is I look I realized hey in my life I've owned two motherboard chipsets in primary desktops You know and that was an Intel which is the best one ever and an enforce 2 which was really great But not quite as good as the Intel.

227
00:14:44,678 --> 00:14:47,909
Speaker 0: so I kind of don't have a problem getting an Intel chipset.

228
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:48,592
Speaker 0: now I'm like hey.

229
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:52,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll get an Intel chipset until my previous one was the best ever sure yeah.

230
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:57,226
Speaker 1: And Linux now is more pretty much just supporting 99% of what's out there.

231
00:14:57,246 --> 00:14:58,350
Speaker 1: I don't have to worry about that.

232
00:14:58,812 --> 00:15:02,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, you only really have to worry about your sound cards and your wireless cards and that sort of stuff.

233
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,696
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can always buy a sound blaster.

234
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:08,290
Speaker 0: Yes, you can but yet the quad core is now what?

235
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:15,150
Speaker 0: $560 on Newegg, which is less than some of the core two extremes which freaks me the hell out now.

236
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,566
Speaker 1: Also, I point out that if you really want to build a relatively fast computer.

237
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,579
Speaker 1: Oh my god That's what John C. Dvorak looks like.

238
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,725
Speaker 0: you'd ever saw him before.

239
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:24,690
Speaker 1: I've never seen him before.

240
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,479
Speaker 0: That's what he looks like.

241
00:15:25,499 --> 00:15:26,450
Speaker 1: that's not what I expected.

242
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:27,815
Speaker 0: Okay, all right anyway.

243
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:29,020
Speaker 1: I just got distracted.

244
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,350
Speaker 1: ed block isn't on this computer right here, right?

245
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,681
Speaker 1: So I saw a picture of John C. Dvorak.

246
00:15:34,203 --> 00:15:34,987
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

247
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,693
Speaker 1: so You can get Computers with chips.

248
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:46,037
Speaker 1: the chips are faster than the computer that I'm using right now to record geek nights and to process geek nights for 30 to 40 dollars.

249
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:49,795
Speaker 1: Yep, 30.

250
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,861
Speaker 0: well 40 dollars rim.

251
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:57,157
Speaker 0: That's been true for like four years, but yeah Oh, even you can get faster.

252
00:15:57,237 --> 00:16:01,892
Speaker 1: once it says here the 3.2 gigahertz penny MD is $84.

253
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,186
Speaker 0: yeah, I wouldn't get that though.

254
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:09,687
Speaker 0: right now It's pretty much if you're buying a computer, and you you know you're not trying to get like one of those $300 machines.

255
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,734
Speaker 0: That's like super cheap.

256
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:14,204
Speaker 0: if you're trying to get a reasonable desktop machine.

257
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,610
Speaker 0: They're pretty much two chips.

258
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,328
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the one that rim was looking at.

259
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:23,648
Speaker 0: the 6600 core to duo is the three-time winner of the customer choice award at Newegg, which is like whoa.

260
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:36,230
Speaker 1: yeah it seems like most people who are buying PCs were either holding out for this chip or Decided that this chip is the perfect plateau or point of most bang for your buck and most forward compatibility.

261
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, well here's the thing right.

262
00:16:37,475 --> 00:16:44,709
Speaker 0: the e6600 is a core to duo with the con row and it's 2.4 Gigahertz and right now it costs two hundred thirty five dollars, right?

263
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:49,554
Speaker 0: There's also the core to duo e6400 Which is the next step down.

264
00:16:49,614 --> 00:16:55,232
Speaker 0: that is exactly the same in every way except it has two megabytes less L2 cash.

265
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:58,080
Speaker 0: so is half as much L2 cash, and it's only two.

266
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:01,530
Speaker 0: point one three gigahertz, and it's one hundred and ninety six dollars.

267
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,107
Speaker 0: It's like forty dollars less right?

268
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,156
Speaker 0: yep There's a new chip right.

269
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:09,973
Speaker 0: that just came out part of this whole thing that Intel did the 6420.

270
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:18,142
Speaker 0: It's identical to the 6400 in every way Except it has the four megs of L2 cash that the 6600 has.

271
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:26,835
Speaker 0: so it's basically the same as the 6600 Except it's like point three gigahertz slower about and $40 cheaper.

272
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:29,949
Speaker 1: now as we were just talking about it's been ourselves before the show.

273
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,990
Speaker 1: It used to not be that big a deal.

274
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:40,190
Speaker 1: But with the core twos every gigahertz or every megahertz faster is a lot more than a megahertz faster was with older chips.

275
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,942
Speaker 0: Yeah, well see here's the thing that's weird that can freak you out right.

276
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:48,702
Speaker 0: megahertz isn't an Absolute indicator of how good the CPU is compared to other CPUs.

277
00:17:48,762 --> 00:17:53,772
Speaker 0: for example the CPU in my computer right now Is an AMD Athlon 1.8.

278
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,014
Speaker 0: Gigahertz XP Athlon XP.

279
00:17:57,074 --> 00:18:00,424
Speaker 0: right my CPU at work is a core to duo.

280
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,132
Speaker 0: each one of the cores is 1.8.

281
00:18:03,132 --> 00:18:03,634
Speaker 0: Gigahertz.

282
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:12,533
Speaker 0: even using only one core and not using the other core because I could do that It's a zillion times faster than my 1.8 Gigahertz Athlon XP.

283
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:18,770
Speaker 0: the chip is just so much more efficient that with the same clock speed it can be like five times faster.

284
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:29,167
Speaker 0: It's ludicrous now that which means that adding one more megahertz to that chip is Gonna add a lot more performance than adding one more megahertz to my Athlon XP.

285
00:18:29,207 --> 00:18:31,621
Speaker 0: yep So when you're adding 0.3.

286
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:39,688
Speaker 0: Gigahertz Which is like what 300 megahertz to that super awesome efficient chip how much of a deal is that?

287
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:40,330
Speaker 0: is it a?

288
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,535
Speaker 0: $40 deal?

289
00:18:41,556 --> 00:18:43,023
Speaker 0: that's a tough call.

290
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:48,230
Speaker 1: yep the thing is Generally like I watch and it depends on you know how much money is worth and everything.

291
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:59,058
Speaker 1: But I look at the list of chips in the series of chips I want to buy and I look at how much it costs to upgrade from one chip to the next chip Mm-hmm and the progression is usually something like

292
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:00,503
Speaker 0: one dollar like five

293
00:19:00,523 --> 00:19:02,710
Speaker 1: dollars twenty dollars thirty dollars forty dollars.

294
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:09,155
Speaker 1: And there's always a point where there's a big leap like the leap between the e6600 and the next Intel chip.

295
00:19:09,256 --> 00:19:11,630
Speaker 1: up is a hundred dollars is a hundred bucks.

296
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,840
Speaker 1: But the leap between that and the chip before it is only $40.

297
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,775
Speaker 0: yep to go from the 6420 to the 6600 Which is just 0.3.

298
00:19:19,775 --> 00:19:26,074
Speaker 0: Gigahertz for $40 to go from the 6600 to the 6700 is You're getting 0.3.

299
00:19:26,074 --> 00:19:28,662
Speaker 0: Gigahertz abouts again for a hundred dollars.

300
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:29,966
Speaker 0: I'd say if you bought the 6700.

301
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,090
Speaker 0: You're an idiot.

302
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:41,630
Speaker 0: Yep, at least as far as I'm coming if I had a lot of money Oh, if you're just loaded out the ass with money You're still an idiot to buy the 6700 because if you're Bill Gates you can buy the core to extreme for eight hundred dollars.

303
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:43,960
Speaker 0: So there's no reason to buy the 6700.

304
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:50,268
Speaker 1: yep But there's always that point and the e6600 really feels like it's the hot hot hot point.

305
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,509
Speaker 1: however Don't you fuckers go out and buy them until I get mine?

306
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might order the chip now just to get it and pick the rest of my computer tomorrow.

307
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:03,688
Speaker 0: What if like the 6620 comes out tomorrow with eight megs of l2 cash or something?

308
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,049
Speaker 0: I don't know.

309
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,848
Speaker 1: see I know it won't because that's the other thing.

310
00:20:05,908 --> 00:20:07,550
Speaker 1: yeah You're thinking of buying a computer.

311
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:16,116
Speaker 1: You always want to buy right after the next big set of releases like as soon as they say Price drops or that's why

312
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:22,036
Speaker 0: if it's like if it's been more than a month since something came out people always say wait for the something Wait for the something and

313
00:20:22,116 --> 00:20:24,889
Speaker 1: if I buy it now I get that it'll be the same price.

314
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:27,003
Speaker 1: now That'll be just before they announce the next.

315
00:20:27,023 --> 00:20:32,670
Speaker 1: yeah, however I'll have that chip with that speed for that much longer, so it's a better deal.

316
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,795
Speaker 0: See here's the problem is.

317
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,830
Speaker 0: you sort of get this paradox of people saying wait wait wait.

318
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,830
Speaker 0: And then when something just comes out people like no it just came out don't get it.

319
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:41,334
Speaker 0: It's still.

320
00:20:41,354 --> 00:20:42,061
Speaker 0: it just came out.

321
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:42,768
Speaker 0: You can't trust it.

322
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,319
Speaker 0: yet It's like what do you want me to do?

323
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:45,930
Speaker 0: never buy anything by the time?

324
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:46,755
Speaker 0: I can trust this.

325
00:20:46,796 --> 00:20:48,206
Speaker 0: they'll tell me to wait for the next thing.

326
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:54,610
Speaker 0: yep So you've got to wait for the second generation to just come out because you can trust the second generation.

327
00:20:55,052 --> 00:20:57,683
Speaker 0: You know I mean the core 2 duo didn't just come out.

328
00:20:57,764 --> 00:20:58,165
Speaker 0: It's old.

329
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:01,035
Speaker 0: It's been around for a while Is the core solo?

330
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:04,450
Speaker 0: yep, this is just a better core 2 duo that just came out.

331
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:07,664
Speaker 0: So now it's safe because you can trust it, but it just came out.

332
00:21:07,946 --> 00:21:09,774
Speaker 0: so it's time to buy Suppires.

333
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:17,501
Speaker 0: market people all right, so if you're paying attention at all Direct x10 is the new hotness for PC gaming.

334
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:22,998
Speaker 0: direct x10 is basically the same as direct x9 But as a bunch of extra stuff, and it's only on Vista.

335
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:38,649
Speaker 0: so when new games start using all sorts of direct x10 stuff And you want to have those games work as best they can with all the fancy graphics and the full speed and the whatnot You need Vista you need a direct x10 supporting video card and need a direct x10 game.

336
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:43,010
Speaker 0: Some people are pissed because they might have direct x10 video cards.

337
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,415
Speaker 0: They have no problem buying video cards.

338
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,037
Speaker 1: see that's.

339
00:21:45,057 --> 00:21:48,028
Speaker 0: they also have no problem buying direct x10 games.

340
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:48,710
Speaker 0: They don't care.

341
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,979
Speaker 0: They'll buy a direct x10 game.

342
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,410
Speaker 0: They want to buy a direct x10 game.

343
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:55,245
Speaker 0: They don't want to buy Vista because they don't like Vista for whatever reason.

344
00:21:55,506 --> 00:21:56,290
Speaker 0: they like their XP.

345
00:21:56,712 --> 00:21:57,517
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with it.

346
00:21:57,537 --> 00:21:58,221
Speaker 0: They're sticking with it.

347
00:21:58,482 --> 00:22:03,810
Speaker 1: Well my reasons very simply I don't want to buy a Dell computer because they really don't have exactly what I want for the price.

348
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:09,064
Speaker 1: I want to pay yep, but I If I pay for Vista on my own it cost a lot.

349
00:22:09,466 --> 00:22:10,130
Speaker 1: It's not worth it.

350
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,562
Speaker 1: It's like $300, but I have a legitimate XP license.

351
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:15,609
Speaker 0: I have two legitimate XP lies.

352
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,218
Speaker 1: well I'm using one of your licenses.

353
00:22:17,238 --> 00:22:19,450
Speaker 0: well that might be the third one that I forgot.

354
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,629
Speaker 0: I'll have to see what the key you're using with the the program that tells you what key.

355
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,822
Speaker 1: yeah I'm gonna use very soon when I start planning my computer.

356
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:28,187
Speaker 0: even beep boots the windows.

357
00:22:28,387 --> 00:22:29,190
Speaker 0: it does it does.

358
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:32,099
Speaker 1: I booted it two days ago to play xcom for like an hour.

359
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,690
Speaker 0: all right cool, but yeah, so there's these guys.

360
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,679
Speaker 0: This is guy Cody bro.

361
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:37,960
Speaker 0: She's.

362
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,010
Speaker 0: I don't know if this is real name, but that's the name on the blog.

363
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,157
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good name.

364
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,003
Speaker 1: If it's a real name.

365
00:22:42,023 --> 00:22:42,990
Speaker 0: He's a 19 year old.

366
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,507
Speaker 0: It says 19 year old software reverse engineer living in San Diego.

367
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:47,090
Speaker 0: something something.

368
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,766
Speaker 0: But he says he's working on project Alki Alki project And he's gonna.

369
00:22:51,908 --> 00:23:03,509
Speaker 0: well He's basically says he's got a working one right here a set of DirectX libraries that will let you do DirectX 10 in XP and he basically runs the DirectX 10 demo programs on XP.

370
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:03,690
Speaker 0: now.

371
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,836
Speaker 0: I haven't downloaded this and tried it.

372
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:06,819
Speaker 0: I don't.

373
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,327
Speaker 0: a lot of people are arguing like it's impossible.

374
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,430
Speaker 0: No this works.

375
00:23:10,511 --> 00:23:11,439
Speaker 0: I downloaded it works.

376
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,649
Speaker 0: I downloaded it didn't work.

377
00:23:13,071 --> 00:23:14,837
Speaker 0: You know it's really tough call.

378
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:24,921
Speaker 0: and whether this is all bullshit whether it's all talk whether it's the real deal No one's quite sure, but if it is the real deal That's gonna be hurtin Vista pretty bad.

379
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:30,070
Speaker 0: cuz gamers are not shy about Downloading some weird program and running it to make their games.

380
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:40,007
Speaker 1: God in the early Nvidia days how many people made just weird utilities that would set a bunch of stuff and make your video car Leet optimal even though half those things were Trojans.

381
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:47,489
Speaker 0: yep The gamers are not ashamed or afraid to just download some utility that will help them run games in some way.

382
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:52,430
Speaker 1: part of that Because a lot of PC gamers aren't afraid to just wipe out their computer.

383
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,410
Speaker 1: They'll reinstall windows once a year or every few months just because they know I might have something slowing me down.

384
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:07,839
Speaker 0: Gotta have a clean windows yep, so if you think I'm kidding if this works gamers everywhere are gonna Be using it and people are gonna start working on it.

385
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:15,949
Speaker 0: and Vista is not gonna sell with the gamers at least not the hardcore Gamers because they're gonna be running their direct tens on XP's if it doesn't work.

386
00:24:16,451 --> 00:24:22,450
Speaker 0: It's all BS, and I predict that within five years the gamers will go to Vista because they're gamers.

387
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,112
Speaker 0: That's what they do.

388
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:28,708
Speaker 1: I think I'm probably going to stick with XP get a DirectX 9 video card that isn't that expensive.

389
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:38,030
Speaker 1: yeah I'm but good enough to play the games I want and then Eventually I'll probably jump to the direct sec direct extend later whenever I don't know I somehow get Vista.

390
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:46,673
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've got Vista for this laptop But I'm not using it or placed it with the Ubuntu, and I probably wouldn't use Vista on a laptop You know.

391
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:55,370
Speaker 0: but if I was gaming if I'm PC gaming a lot a whole lot And I keep PC gaming a lot it might eventually be worth it, but not right away.

392
00:24:55,912 --> 00:25:02,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm probably gonna replace my computer at the end of the summer Which will be a whole different scenario than buying one now.

393
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:05,932
Speaker 1: if I was you or if I were you I would hold out until Penryn.

394
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:07,737
Speaker 0: I'm holding out a long time.

395
00:25:07,938 --> 00:25:11,488
Speaker 1: if you can cuz Penryn probably won't be available until next year.

396
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:12,630
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't know.

397
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:19,610
Speaker 0: We'll see how long I can hold out because my computer now could probably Play the team fortress twos and all those games that we're gonna want to play at the end of the year.

398
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,938
Speaker 0: But it's not gonna do it that way.

399
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,410
Speaker 1: Yeah granted you have a lot higher tolerance for low FPS.

400
00:25:25,652 --> 00:25:27,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can play with like 40 FPS.

401
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:28,654
Speaker 1: I'm.

402
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:37,249
Speaker 1: I'll admit that I'm just a stupid nut but you are stupid Really bothers me if I don't get at least 60 frames per second continuously and uninterruptedly.

403
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,097
Speaker 0: Monitors are 75 FPS.

404
00:25:40,117 --> 00:25:41,040
Speaker 0: so that's all I really need.

405
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,550
Speaker 1: see that's the other thing and I got a deal with this.

406
00:25:43,851 --> 00:25:47,129
Speaker 1: So I'm sure I'll be able to deal with just fine because I'll have an awesome flat LCD.

407
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:49,545
Speaker 1: But I always ran my CRT.

408
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:53,061
Speaker 1: in fact right now It's running at a hundred megahertz, and I always played.

409
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:56,610
Speaker 1: all my FPS is locked at a hundred megahertz FPS.

410
00:25:57,174 --> 00:26:00,170
Speaker 0: well, well, yeah hundred FPS a hundred Hertz not a hundred megahertz.

411
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,480
Speaker 0: Hundred million yes a hundred hurt.

412
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,930
Speaker 0: Are you playing there some dead heck at a hundred million FPS?

413
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:09,202
Speaker 1: I I will say right now that I misspoke.

414
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:20,628
Speaker 0: Yes, okay It's done things of the day.

415
00:26:21,731 --> 00:26:24,050
Speaker 1: They're real quick here because we kind of went long in the first half.

416
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,230
Speaker 1: But and again, I hate to use something on dig even though there's a lot of cool stuff on dig.

417
00:26:28,874 --> 00:26:38,522
Speaker 1: I assume that everyone sees everything on dig But in case you didn't and also because there's nothing interesting on the internet That wasn't already on dig in the last several days.

418
00:26:38,582 --> 00:26:41,394
Speaker 0: man half of what's on dig right now is stuff I've seen before.

419
00:26:41,454 --> 00:26:43,162
Speaker 0: it's like oh come on people.

420
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,106
Speaker 0: We have a new business.

421
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:52,118
Speaker 1: in fact I just saw again on dig on the front page of the videos that Christopher Christopher Walken fat boy slim video.

422
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,906
Speaker 0: I saw that in high school people high school.

423
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:55,828
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

424
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:56,450
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

425
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:57,554
Speaker 0: We know it's awesome.

426
00:26:57,795 --> 00:26:58,498
Speaker 1: We've all seen it.

427
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:02,841
Speaker 1: Christopher Walken is one of the cute coolest human beings ever But he went to dance school.

428
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:03,749
Speaker 0: He can fucking dance.

429
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,470
Speaker 1: Anyway, what if the Nazis had mechs?

430
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,376
Speaker 1: What if the Americans also had mechs?

431
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:12,061
Speaker 1: and it was World War two?

432
00:27:12,221 --> 00:27:15,370
Speaker 0: obviously sounds like every board game and video game ever.

433
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:24,680
Speaker 1: Well this CG Feels like it's a video game like I kept almost expecting Control to turn to me at several points.

434
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,849
Speaker 0: yeah, especially when like you saw the guys in the airplanes show up.

435
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, like expected the camera to just float on into the cockpit, and then you know it would go blue, and you'd have joysticks.

436
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:38,419
Speaker 0: It'd be good stuff, but regardless.

437
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,423
Speaker 1: This is really cool.

438
00:27:39,463 --> 00:27:47,290
Speaker 1: I gotta say the CG people are Not so much realistic in terms of how they look with their faces, but in terms of how they move are spot-on.

439
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:56,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one thing that really kind of gets me in this in this particular Animation is that all the people moving like they've run naturally they move.

440
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,128
Speaker 0: naturally they move their heads.

441
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,950
Speaker 0: naturally They don't look real because their faces still aren't quite.

442
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:09,543
Speaker 0: You know they're obviously CG rendering faces and everything But the way that people run around looks just right.

443
00:28:09,784 --> 00:28:11,150
Speaker 0: you could have fooled me from far away.

444
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:16,026
Speaker 1: Granted Emily speculated that they might have used a lot of motion capture for that which is awesome.

445
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:16,427
Speaker 0: Why not?

446
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,394
Speaker 0: yeah, it works You do it do.

447
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:19,539
Speaker 0: It's good all right.

448
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:21,447
Speaker 0: Here's an old thing of the day.

449
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,130
Speaker 0: cuz rim is right.

450
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,625
Speaker 0: There is nothing new on the internet lately.

451
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:27,850
Speaker 0: Lorem ipsum generator, it's at lip sum calm.

452
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,338
Speaker 0: basically when you want to you know Practice some typography.

453
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:38,630
Speaker 0: you're like you want to set some type or format a page But you don't have any text to actually format.

454
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,641
Speaker 0: Or you don't want to be distracted by the text.

455
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:52,090
Speaker 0: like if I do put an article about fire And I want to typeset it I might be distracted by the article itself And I won't be able to objectively typeset it in the best way possible

456
00:28:52,210 --> 00:29:00,690
Speaker 1: and at the same time you can't just use a stream of gibberish because that doesn't actually look like typing and Not only would also be distracting, but it doesn't fit.

457
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,937
Speaker 1: It doesn't give you a sense of what the document will.

458
00:29:02,998 --> 00:29:08,737
Speaker 0: any lots of things that are like any tall letters short letters Any wide letters narrow letters.

459
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,290
Speaker 0: you need you know short words long words lots of spaces.

460
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:17,050
Speaker 0: You know you need a lot of mixed up kind of stuff, so the solution to this problem is lorem ipsum.

461
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:23,719
Speaker 0: if you go to this website, they'll tell you all about the history of lorem ipsum and People especially web developers.

462
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:37,670
Speaker 0: and you know printers and all sorts of people Get lorem ipsum that they use in order to you know get things typeset Just right when they don't have actual content, and I want everyone to actually read the paragraph on the bottom.

463
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:46,907
Speaker 0: It's really cool what the pair the last paragraph on the page is And this page will generate lorem ipsum for you if you need some if you're making web page man.

464
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:54,484
Speaker 1: way back in the day I had a little program on windows that would generate however much lorem ipsum I needed and put it in the clipboard and I could paste it into stuff.

465
00:29:54,524 --> 00:29:55,147
Speaker 1: I was working on.

466
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:58,550
Speaker 0: yep Yeah, this is a pretty good lorem ipsum generator.

467
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,628
Speaker 1: You know I wonder I should make a lorem ipsum device that I can just cat out of.

468
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,286
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, no, but this lorem ipsum generator is actually the best.

469
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:09,070
Speaker 1: Why shouldn't I do that?

470
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,915
Speaker 1: That's really gosh.

471
00:30:10,136 --> 00:30:18,185
Speaker 0: I'll just see if anyone else has done that and I'll bet they have Because it will not put any random humor, and it won't put any other random.

472
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:19,810
Speaker 0: You know garbage in there.

473
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,257
Speaker 0: That's not doesn't work right.

474
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:25,883
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty much the best lorem ipsum generator there is All right.

475
00:30:26,648 --> 00:30:34,349
Speaker 0: today We're gonna talk to you about something very relevant Because a lot of people are switching to feisty fawn or at least trying it out like I told them to.

476
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:36,101
Speaker 0: yeah Oh, if you haven't tried it out.

477
00:30:36,443 --> 00:30:37,270
Speaker 0: You should try it out.

478
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:41,770
Speaker 1: I convinced some of the old curmudgeons at my job to try it out.

479
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:50,210
Speaker 1: They're really curious about this Ubuntu thing because the last time most people in the tech industry used Linux was Red Hat 7 when it was ass.

480
00:30:50,491 --> 00:30:51,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, Red Hat 7 sucks.

481
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:55,705
Speaker 1: It really it was so bad and not not Power Glove bad.

482
00:30:56,006 --> 00:31:02,960
Speaker 0: No, so a Lot of people are having a hard time understanding Just how you install software in Linux?

483
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,370
Speaker 0: because well in pretty much all Linux Distributions well each one does it differently as some of them do it the same as others, but not many.

484
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:15,023
Speaker 0: It's a totally different concept from installing software on Windows in Windows.

485
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:16,608
Speaker 0: Let's say you want to install.

486
00:31:16,628 --> 00:31:17,290
Speaker 0: I don't know Skype.

487
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:18,173
Speaker 0: What do you do?

488
00:31:18,373 --> 00:31:19,457
Speaker 0: you go to Skype calm.

489
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:23,229
Speaker 0: you download Skype setup that exe you double click on it?

490
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,936
Speaker 0: You're good on a Mac.

491
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:25,438
Speaker 0: What do you do?

492
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,330
Speaker 0: you download some program you double click on it?

493
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,218
Speaker 0: You drag an icon somewhere into your applications folder.

494
00:31:31,579 --> 00:31:32,161
Speaker 0: It's installed.

495
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,745
Speaker 0: You're all good in Linux.

496
00:31:34,207 --> 00:31:35,250
Speaker 0: That's not how it works.

497
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,674
Speaker 1: Yep, totally different.

498
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:52,042
Speaker 1: back in RIT when I was taking you know various classes on sys administration and Linux and all that One of the most common questions that other people asked in class and they asked it with such frequency Was after they installed something they got an RPM or whatever and they installed it.

499
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:54,710
Speaker 1: they'd ask so where did it install to?

500
00:31:55,451 --> 00:31:56,297
Speaker 1: How do I run it?

501
00:31:56,438 --> 00:31:56,640
Speaker 1: Yeah?

502
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,607
Speaker 1: Where is it?

503
00:31:57,748 --> 00:31:57,950
Speaker 0: Yep?

504
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:04,770
Speaker 0: That's the thing is because when you installed software on Windows and DOS and all those olden times You would always install it to somewhere.

505
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:12,250
Speaker 0: I mean in DOS days Installing software was just copying a folder from a disk onto your hard drive somewhere and you would choose where it went.

506
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,415
Speaker 0: And it was your decision.

507
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:17,130
Speaker 0: and nowadays everything goes into C colon program files or whatever.

508
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:20,330
Speaker 0: But it's all about where it goes in Linux.

509
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,026
Speaker 0: It's not about where it goes because this it's it's not one piece of software.

510
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:26,090
Speaker 0: That's all in one folder.

511
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:27,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not gonna get into it.

512
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:28,250
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna get into it.

513
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,863
Speaker 1: I don't know if we did a show on this, but if we didn't we should we should.

514
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,270
Speaker 0: it's all little bits.

515
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:35,310
Speaker 0: Everything is a little bit and all the little bits work together.

516
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:41,590
Speaker 0: So the little bits are all over the place where the they belong and your program is actually just one thing.

517
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:47,408
Speaker 0: that then grabs a bunch of separate bits and then uses them all together to make the whole big thing go.

518
00:32:47,509 --> 00:33:00,430
Speaker 0: so when you want to install software and Linux and the year is You only have one way to do it pretty much you get the source code the actual source code because remember this is open source.

519
00:33:00,974 --> 00:33:02,949
Speaker 0: You know you have the source code available to you.

520
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:10,842
Speaker 0: It's not like in Windows with a closed source program where someone else takes the source code Compiles it and gives you the result to run.

521
00:33:11,345 --> 00:33:16,130
Speaker 0: you get the source code yourself You compile it yourself, and then you run it yourself.

522
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:19,120
Speaker 1: Yep, now of course there were a number of problems with this.

523
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,150
Speaker 1: in one a lot of people didn't really know how to compile things.

524
00:33:22,471 --> 00:33:33,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, well anyone who's using Linux in those days that true pile things, but even that most people still don't say alright I'm gonna compile foo, but what if foo needs all this other stuff that it doesn't come with?

525
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,528
Speaker 1: well I gotta go get all that and compile it too.

526
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:37,175
Speaker 0: You got to go out.

527
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:40,826
Speaker 0: you got to get all these different little bits compile them each individually.

528
00:33:40,887 --> 00:33:48,710
Speaker 0: the other part is You know when you have a compute a program And you always the first thing you do when you have a new program is you go to the settings and you check all the?

529
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,442
Speaker 0: Settings that you want your preferences.

530
00:33:50,462 --> 00:34:03,628
Speaker 0: because what you like when you compile a program their Preferences that you can set at compile time before you install the program before it's running you can decide things like hey Do I want this?

531
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,455
Speaker 0: Program to support mp3?

532
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:09,262
Speaker 0: I should compile it with mp3 support.

533
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:18,614
Speaker 0: if I don't it won't be able to support mp3 stuff like that and You had to give a whole bunch of configuration options when you compiled something And it's not easy.

534
00:34:19,295 --> 00:34:22,866
Speaker 0: it is still this way where everyone had to compile all their software by hand.

535
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:24,230
Speaker 0: it would be a nightmare.

536
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:25,755
Speaker 0: No one could do it.

537
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,525
Speaker 0: only nerdy people who knew how to use compilers could use Linux.

538
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,620
Speaker 1: so enter binaries.

539
00:34:31,166 --> 00:34:34,389
Speaker 0: yes Basically people said hey, this is too damn hard.

540
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:38,183
Speaker 0: Let's compile the software and give the people that compiled stuff.

541
00:34:38,322 --> 00:34:51,628
Speaker 1: so what they do is that on you go to any website for someone who has an open source project they give you the source code and nicely they would make various binaries of Various versions that you could just download and install without having to compile them.

542
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:55,340
Speaker 0: yep And they had a lot of different systems for how these binaries would work.

543
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:03,523
Speaker 0: like some systems someone would give you a special thing They made and you would run it And it would put the binary somewhere like acrobat reader still does it that way.

544
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,794
Speaker 0: if you want to install that on Linux you know And Skype does it that way I think.

545
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:18,509
Speaker 0: but they invented these systems of having binary app Software installation and the two major systems that you have to care about our RPM and DEB Deb.

546
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:27,447
Speaker 0: RPM is the Red Hat package management and Deb is obviously what Debian uses and since Ubuntu is based on Debian it uses Deb's also.

547
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:35,156
Speaker 0: Basically the way it works is you download an RPM or a Deb and you have a little program already Installed that came with your distribution.

548
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:39,370
Speaker 0: if you're you know using an RPM distribution it probably comes with the RPM program.

549
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:41,256
Speaker 0: Using Ubuntu or Debian.

550
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:49,565
Speaker 0: it comes with the Deb program, and you say hey install that RPM Hey install that Deb and your computer tries if it can it can.

551
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,488
Speaker 0: if it can't it can't.

552
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:56,513
Speaker 1: Now again we could talk about how they work and how like what's actually in one of these things and how it knows where to Put things.

553
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,087
Speaker 1: and it's actually a little bit more complex than you'd expect.

554
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:02,707
Speaker 1: but again It's not something the average user needs to know or care about.

555
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:11,387
Speaker 0: yeah Basically what it does is you know you download like the Deb for Firefox And it says oh I need this and this and this all other things and it tries to get them.

556
00:36:11,487 --> 00:36:22,099
Speaker 0: and yeah It's that's how all the little bits come together is because these programs know by looking at one package whatever packages They need and they can get all the dependencies and things.

557
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:25,770
Speaker 0: and it's sometimes causes problems when distributions suck.

558
00:36:26,171 --> 00:36:28,179
Speaker 0: But when distributions work right it's awesome.

559
00:36:28,581 --> 00:36:31,956
Speaker 1: now back then there was still the problem of all right I want to install foo.

560
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,405
Speaker 1: I go get the binary for foo.

561
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:33,787
Speaker 1: I run it.

562
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:39,970
Speaker 1: Oh, it says you need a bar vaz and bat in an addition in order to install foo.

563
00:36:40,151 --> 00:36:45,550
Speaker 0: So you go and try to find the RPMs or the deb's for Bar baz and bat and maybe you can find them.

564
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:52,130
Speaker 1: Maybe you can't and it usually involved going to semi shady websites looking for RPM, and then you get like the wrong version.

565
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,291
Speaker 0: It's like 0.01.

566
00:36:53,291 --> 00:37:01,340
Speaker 0: You needed 0.02 And it doesn't work with that version and then that in turn needs other things that are different versions And the whole thing falls apart.

567
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:02,024
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

568
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,095
Speaker 1: enter Package management.

569
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:08,390
Speaker 0: yes, what eventually happened is the distributions of Linux.

570
00:37:08,471 --> 00:37:11,170
Speaker 0: You know people who take because Linux is just a kernel.

571
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,690
Speaker 0: That's all it is, but people would take all we're gonna.

572
00:37:13,911 --> 00:37:14,173
Speaker 1: We're gonna.

573
00:37:14,193 --> 00:37:15,218
Speaker 1: we should talk about the whole.

574
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:22,909
Speaker 0: how technically there's the GNU now We're not talking about that, but people who make a Linux distribution is basically some.

575
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:30,010
Speaker 0: It's someone who goes out and they get a whole bunch of bits because you can choose different bits.

576
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:31,672
Speaker 0: You know it's like Legos.

577
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:35,086
Speaker 0: you can choose to use these Legos of those ones the black or the gray or the red.

578
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:41,066
Speaker 1: so I take like the Linux Kernel and then I grab I don't know this package manager and this this and this thing.

579
00:37:41,106 --> 00:37:47,330
Speaker 0: it's like I take Linux kernel Then I'll take Firefox, and I'll take the X terminal and I'll take the barrel thing.

580
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:54,849
Speaker 0: You know you take the pieces that are necessary And you put them together and you make decisions about which pieces you're gonna use and which ones you're not gonna use.

581
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,159
Speaker 1: if you build Linux from scratch you just do that for yourself.

582
00:37:57,259 --> 00:37:59,449
Speaker 1: You've basically you made your own distribution just for you.

583
00:37:59,651 --> 00:38:10,413
Speaker 0: Yep You choose which pieces you want in which places you know and in The end you come up with enough pieces to make a whole system that has a GUI or maybe your distribution doesn't even have A GUI who knows?

584
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:15,849
Speaker 0: you come up with enough pieces to make a computer that someone can use and that's what a distribution is.

585
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:20,642
Speaker 0: The distributions like Red Hat and Ubuntu and Debian and all those people Gentoo.

586
00:38:21,364 --> 00:38:23,410
Speaker 0: They decided hey this really sucks.

587
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,810
Speaker 0: No one can install software.

588
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:27,533
Speaker 0: Let's make Repositories.

589
00:38:28,155 --> 00:38:33,430
Speaker 0: what the repositories are is there's a server somewhere or a bunch of servers where they store?

590
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:43,741
Speaker 0: all the debs or all the RPMs or all the whatever and your computer Connects to the repository and knows what software is in there.

591
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:52,590
Speaker 0: so when you want to install say Firefox you say hey Ubuntu apt-get install Firefox and Ubuntu goes to the repository.

592
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:55,190
Speaker 0: That's managed by the Ubuntu people.

593
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:56,534
Speaker 0: It's all set up.

594
00:38:56,654 --> 00:38:59,161
Speaker 0: everything you need is in there because they're constantly.

595
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:08,561
Speaker 1: Yep a lot of big distributions will have a team of people who work with them or for

596
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:09,805
Speaker 0: a lot of people and

597
00:39:10,005 --> 00:39:27,950
Speaker 1: all those people will do is Pick applications or work together to decide which applications they care about and whenever there are new versions They'll go get the source make a binary that they know works on a standard Version of their distribution and put it in the repository Guaranteeing that it will work.

598
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:34,950
Speaker 0: And they don't put it in the Depository that you can get to until it's fully tested and they know it's gonna work no matter what at least most of the time.

599
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:41,018
Speaker 1: Yeah and granted like you can get like on Gentoo even though it's source based is still the same kind of thing where There are different kind.

600
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:51,565
Speaker 1: like you can get the normal stuff that's tested But you can change some bits and then you get access to the repositories that have things that are Mostly tested and should work but might not.

601
00:39:51,826 --> 00:40:04,004
Speaker 0: yeah, basically It's a big server full of software and the software there because it's managed by these people who are constantly You know checking for new versions and patching security fixes and everything like that.

602
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:07,624
Speaker 0: It's like your one-stop shop You know, you need something new.

603
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,230
Speaker 0: they got it.

604
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,997
Speaker 0: You need an update for something you already got.

605
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:13,330
Speaker 0: it'll tell you because it checks the repository for when those updates.

606
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:16,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, this stuff you've got now and it's really cool.

607
00:40:17,143 --> 00:40:23,263
Speaker 1: You can also usually there's various managers You can use with the repositories actually search through them and find programs.

608
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:25,570
Speaker 1: say I need I don't know a text editor.

609
00:40:25,992 --> 00:40:31,413
Speaker 1: I can search through for text editors find a list of 15 of them that are available through my Distribution.

610
00:40:31,775 --> 00:40:33,947
Speaker 1: download the ones I like delete the ones I don't like.

611
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:35,151
Speaker 0: yeah It's it's.

612
00:40:35,412 --> 00:40:47,412
Speaker 0: instead of hunting around the web looking for stuff possibly getting something shade possibly getting something shady the Disney Repositories offer a place to get something that's not shady guaranteed.

613
00:40:47,593 --> 00:40:54,877
Speaker 0: as long as you don't use some weird repository as long as you only use the ones they tell you to you're guaranteed to Get something that'll work and you can.

614
00:40:54,998 --> 00:41:00,474
Speaker 0: it's really easy to find software without roaming around wondering what's available And all that garbage.

615
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:09,481
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole Windows paradigm of download a program install it to a directory is Really completely obsolete unless you're still using Windows.

616
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:12,450
Speaker 0: and this this is why Linux doesn't have spyware.

617
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:12,974
Speaker 0: I mean like there's.

618
00:41:12,994 --> 00:41:14,870
Speaker 0: no it's not difficult to make spyware for Linux.

619
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:23,670
Speaker 0: I can make a spyware program But no one's gonna go to your website and download your exe file and run it just because you fooled them with a tricky website.

620
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:29,830
Speaker 0: People only get their software from one place, you know, if they're using Ubuntu they get it from the Ubuntu repositories.

621
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:34,902
Speaker 1: I think it also helps that security in Linux is just generally more that helps.

622
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:37,128
Speaker 1: Yes, but and there's no Internet Explorer.

623
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:38,070
Speaker 0: Yes, that's true.

624
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:40,076
Speaker 0: However, that this is really like.

625
00:41:40,277 --> 00:41:46,103
Speaker 0: one of the big reasons that you don't get shady software on Linux is no one will put shady software in their repository.

626
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:51,750
Speaker 0: and The thing is if you want software sometimes you want software that's not in your repository.

627
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:57,270
Speaker 0: Like you'll be using Red Hat and you'll want say I don't know the new version of Firefox.

628
00:41:57,571 --> 00:42:00,730
Speaker 1: And you say the new version of Firefox only comes out in a deb for some reason.

629
00:42:00,991 --> 00:42:03,461
Speaker 0: Yeah, or maybe the new version of Firefox?

630
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:05,770
Speaker 0: the people who manage that repository.

631
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:10,842
Speaker 0: They didn't put the new version of Firefox in there yet They're not gonna put it in there for another month or like.

632
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,510
Speaker 1: here's something I ran into with Ubuntu.

633
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,310
Speaker 1: There was a program I used to set some logitech mouse parameters and it was old and barely maintained.

634
00:42:18,491 --> 00:42:21,030
Speaker 1: Yep, it was not in any Ubuntu repository.

635
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:25,948
Speaker 1: In fact, all I have is one old busted rpm and the website's gone and everything.

636
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:29,090
Speaker 0: Yep Well, you can choose to go out and try to find it yourself.

637
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:32,790
Speaker 0: You can go get the deb or the rpm on your own on the web and do it that the old way.

638
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,403
Speaker 1: Yep, I can try and find the source and compile it.

639
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:36,690
Speaker 0: Yep, but those are difficult.

640
00:42:37,071 --> 00:42:42,570
Speaker 0: What you can do is you can find a third-party repository for a lot of things out there.

641
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,270
Speaker 0: There's someone who is making packages and they make their own repository of stuff.

642
00:42:47,390 --> 00:43:02,179
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a guy out there who has a special Ubuntu Firefox repository and you can add his repository To your Ubuntu install and now when your Ubuntu is looking for Firefox It'll get it there if he has the most up-to-date version.

643
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:10,410
Speaker 0: and that's how you can get all their stuff is not by going out Onto the internet and finding some package of a newer version because that'll only work once.

644
00:43:11,052 --> 00:43:23,148
Speaker 0: You want to go out and find someone who's managing a repository and you add their repository to your computer And now you can get all the software that they're offering in addition to the software that you already had being offered to you.

645
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,576
Speaker 1: now Handy-dandy little Ubuntu tip.

646
00:43:26,017 --> 00:43:30,390
Speaker 1: you want to go into your repository stuff and add universe and multiverse.

647
00:43:30,792 --> 00:43:33,081
Speaker 0: Yes, you see in Ubuntu by default.

648
00:43:33,121 --> 00:43:36,357
Speaker 0: They only give you the standard Ubuntu repositories.

649
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:45,127
Speaker 0: there are other semi-official mostly official Ubuntu repositories called multiverse and universe that offer you all the software you really want.

650
00:43:45,448 --> 00:43:48,619
Speaker 0: if you add those Because they're they're run by Ubuntu.

651
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,130
Speaker 0: They're just not as official as the real ones.

652
00:43:51,693 --> 00:43:53,604
Speaker 0: That's how you're gonna get all the cool software.

653
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:58,001
Speaker 0: once you've got those You're basically never gonna need to go and get software anywhere else.

654
00:43:58,443 --> 00:43:59,767
Speaker 0: almost never like 99% of the time.

655
00:44:00,911 --> 00:44:06,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the only time I've had to is when I needed a specific version of something like Wesnoth for whatever reason.

656
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:08,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Wesnoth is pretty easy to install.

657
00:44:09,036 --> 00:44:15,790
Speaker 0: I mean, yes Plus if you can find a deb nine times out of ten you just double click on the deb and it will install and work.

658
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,881
Speaker 0: But you know that only installs once.

659
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:22,443
Speaker 0: like I install bit torrent from a deb I go to bit torrent comm to get the official bit torrent client.

660
00:44:22,483 --> 00:44:23,066
Speaker 0: I get the deb.

661
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:23,990
Speaker 0: I double-click it works.

662
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:26,861
Speaker 0: You know, it's not a big deal, you know one package.

663
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:28,127
Speaker 0: I install the old-fashioned way.

664
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:36,184
Speaker 1: It's not gonna kill me Yep, but for Ubuntu generally just go to system Administration and then there should be something that says software sources.

665
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:46,930
Speaker 0: That is where you can change this Yep, you can also get to there through the synaptic package manager Which is your graphical user interface to interact with the repositories and the software installation methods.

666
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,764
Speaker 1: Yes, in general you should use synaptic instead of ad remove programs, which is also there.

667
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:53,910
Speaker 0: add remove programs is actually pretty good.

668
00:44:54,030 --> 00:45:01,589
Speaker 0: I recommend that when you first install Ubuntu for the first time go to add remove programs and go through the whole thing once.

669
00:45:02,231 --> 00:45:06,943
Speaker 0: Andrew never use it again because that's pretty much it shows you this.

670
00:45:07,043 --> 00:45:09,690
Speaker 0: it gives you a different interface on the software installation.

671
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:14,610
Speaker 0: It's much better for newbies, but isn't really helpful in the long run.

672
00:45:14,871 --> 00:45:19,170
Speaker 1: But it also it has most of the things that normal users will need right away.

673
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:27,095
Speaker 0: yep, so your first time through you can go in there and it's real easy to understand and you'll be able to install all the Software that you need to get going.

674
00:45:27,436 --> 00:45:31,430
Speaker 0: but from then on out just use the synaptic package manager for when you need.

675
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,195
Speaker 0: You know real software beyond that.

676
00:45:33,978 --> 00:45:36,264
Speaker 0: So yeah, I hope that was a good explanation.

677
00:45:36,305 --> 00:45:38,050
Speaker 0: We had to hurry it because we're running out of time.

678
00:45:38,544 --> 00:45:44,510
Speaker 1: Yep Also, I've been watching my computer to make sure it doesn't overheat and I think the sound cards having some troubles.

679
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,814
Speaker 1: So we'll see how this sounds.

680
00:45:46,155 --> 00:45:46,677
Speaker 0: Oh great.

681
00:45:46,737 --> 00:45:47,359
Speaker 0: Fantastic.

682
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:50,228
Speaker 1: Not bad trouble, but I think it's slowly.

683
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:50,910
Speaker 1: slowly.

684
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,296
Speaker 0: We're gonna use the Mac tomorrow.

685
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,566
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm gonna have a computer by next week.

686
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:55,530
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna try to hold out.

687
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:56,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll see.

688
00:45:57,016 --> 00:46:00,290
Speaker 0: Anyway, I hope you understand Linux package management.

689
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,357
Speaker 0: We barely went into detail on it.

690
00:46:02,518 --> 00:46:06,050
Speaker 0: But if you have any questions, the forums are awesome.

691
00:46:06,251 --> 00:46:09,629
Speaker 1: Yeah granted half the time you ask a question and Scott just says Google it.

692
00:46:10,011 --> 00:46:11,757
Speaker 0: But that's true as Google.

693
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:15,189
Speaker 0: before you ask me cuz nine times out of ten Google has the answer first.

694
00:46:21,762 --> 00:46:24,348
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
