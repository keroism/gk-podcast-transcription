1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,721
Speaker 1: It's Monday May 18.

2
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:16,263
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:17,649
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,799
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,639
Speaker 1: Tonight We're talking about ad blocking and I was delaying because I forgot what we picked as our show The crab people.

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:29,558
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:31,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had it.

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:31,860
Speaker 1: We have another idea.

9
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:36,432
Speaker 1: We might do a show next time on VPNs But I gotta read up a little bit to remind myself of some things.

10
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:38,280
Speaker 0: It's not a thing you work with very often.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to like that used to be my job.

12
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,131
Speaker 1: I was like, hey a set of a VPN is the second phase up.

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,876
Speaker 1: what's going on with the?

14
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,220
Speaker 1: the time would but I don't care.

15
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:48,746
Speaker 1: I have people who do that for me.

16
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:54,292
Speaker 1: I just say things like yeah, I'll put a VPN between those two things Mmm, so we'll see.

17
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:55,599
Speaker 1: It could be an interesting show.

18
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:03,317
Speaker 1: I could do a show on the fixed protocol because I know you guys are all fascinated by it But Scott doesn't want to do a show on it.

19
00:01:04,221 --> 00:01:09,000
Speaker 0: Should we just do a show on every single protocol there is because we can just you know, let's go to any industry.

20
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,358
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's like a medical protocol that like those computers used to exchange medical records.

21
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:16,124
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a Big difference.

22
00:01:16,204 --> 00:01:20,258
Speaker 1: Is there a protocol like that that either of us knows fuck all about.

23
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:23,652
Speaker 0: I understand There's plenty of protocols that I know FTPs.

24
00:01:23,672 --> 00:01:25,280
Speaker 1: I said, do you really know FTP?

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,827
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know FTP fully.

26
00:01:28,028 --> 00:01:30,599
Speaker 1: how many ports does FTP open and in what directions?

27
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:35,385
Speaker 0: It only really needs two Getting and receiving.

28
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,494
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not sending and receiving its data and control.

29
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:39,758
Speaker 1: You don't know shit about FTP.

30
00:01:39,778 --> 00:01:42,005
Speaker 1: the same thing No, it's not FTP.

31
00:01:42,045 --> 00:01:49,104
Speaker 1: No Scott FTP is actually like if you use it kind of Overcomplicated and fucked up.

32
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:58,652
Speaker 1: and to this day most young people I know in the industry like just in general Cannot set up a firewall to let FTP through properly.

33
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:00,840
Speaker 1: They don't know the difference between passive and active FTP.

34
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,149
Speaker 0: It's a giant nightmare, but I can do that.

35
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,680
Speaker 1: What's the difference between passive and active FTP?

36
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,489
Speaker 1: It has to do with how you can open the firewall.

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:24,980
Speaker 1: in which direction depending on who initiates which of the two Street or two connections that need to be open FTP will fail in Mysterious ways if you don't know like the weird details of what's going on down there.

38
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,110
Speaker 0: Okay.

39
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,146
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe we should do a show on FTP.

40
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:30,492
Speaker 0: How many protocols are we gonna do?

41
00:02:30,512 --> 00:02:32,400
Speaker 0: shows us be a Monday night protocol?

42
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,098
Speaker 0: Let's name.

43
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:38,517
Speaker 1: So what are all the protocols that we know like either of us know enough to talk for at least 20 minutes about.

44
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:45,804
Speaker 0: I got fixed HTTP NTP SSH FTP Something else that ends in P.

45
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:50,359
Speaker 1: Uh, I can talk a little bit about Tib RV the middleware TCP IP.

46
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:54,516
Speaker 1: I know a little bit about tervela and solace, but they're just middleware.

47
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:57,345
Speaker 0: They're not that special It's probably a lot more of.

48
00:02:57,405 --> 00:02:59,332
Speaker 0: I would just think of them XML RPC.

49
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:03,987
Speaker 0: It's not really a protocol to really Yes, it's the standard.

50
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:13,125
Speaker 1: Yeah a protocol is like one, you know, well, you know what actually that show we have to get into the differences like the difference between a transport or a Semantic or like what were.

51
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:13,868
Speaker 1: you know, there's a lot of.

52
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,535
Speaker 1: there's a lot of the meta show.

53
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:16,780
Speaker 0: It's like about protocols.

54
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:19,209
Speaker 1: That's actually a pretty good idea for a show.

55
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:19,872
Speaker 0: no, it's not.

56
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,057
Speaker 1: I think it's no idea.

57
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,418
Speaker 0: go on to the news All right.

58
00:03:22,763 --> 00:03:24,600
Speaker 1: So in the news this kind of an aside.

59
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:30,040
Speaker 1: But Scott kind of makes fun of me sometimes because I will often even if you know, there's news in tech.

60
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:43,539
Speaker 1: But I'll usually go link to when we do the show like in the show notes to the slash shot article about the thing mostly because slash shot articles don't disappear unlike every fucking other thing we link to and to.

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,557
Speaker 1: Usually in the past at least the comments would have a lot of like.

62
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,200
Speaker 1: oh by the way Here's the technical reason why that article was completely wrong.

63
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,733
Speaker 1: like a lot of smart stuff would be down there.

64
00:03:52,753 --> 00:03:59,420
Speaker 1: and Also, usually they link to a bunch of different sources of the news and a little bit of commentary.

65
00:03:59,883 --> 00:04:02,279
Speaker 1: So like it was just it was a good landing place for our links.

66
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,702
Speaker 1: but as time has gone on I Feel like.

67
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:11,019
Speaker 1: obviously I mean like dig and read it and all these things came and went and came again.

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:17,177
Speaker 1: Slashdot has not been the most growing and active community on the internet.

69
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:21,375
Speaker 1: to put it lightly Slashdot is a relative growing of the late 90s at best.

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:40,559
Speaker 1: so I Suspected for a long time and I kind of noticed that when I was on slashdot in the 90s and then like at RIT Slashdot was like people on the not the bleeding edge But the cutting edge of technology like people knew shit about brand new shit and there was a lot of like.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,584
Speaker 1: well We'll just do crazy stuff in the future.

72
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,452
Speaker 1: and fast computers and like mod my body technology.

73
00:04:45,512 --> 00:04:47,136
Speaker 1: Let's go fuck the consequences.

74
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:56,326
Speaker 1: I feel like the exact same people are now on slashdot and they're all in their 40s and Now they really want to slow things down.

75
00:04:56,407 --> 00:05:04,314
Speaker 1: like they're not as comfortable with new stuff and instead of being forward-thinking They're backward thinking and they want all technology to be like it was in the 90s.

76
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:04,435
Speaker 1: Why?

77
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,129
Speaker 0: I'm sure someone must have researched why people become Conservative when they get old.

78
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,793
Speaker 0: is it because?

79
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,598
Speaker 0: why can't we do it?

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:13,963
Speaker 0: I can't we use it cuz?

81
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:18,860
Speaker 0: clearly it doesn't happen to everyone but like slash dot you'd think like why can't we undo this?

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,055
Speaker 1: A lot of us nerds like to say like Oh techie computer II people it doesn't happen to.

83
00:05:23,336 --> 00:05:25,946
Speaker 1: I think it happens to them at the Same percentage as everyone else.

84
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:29,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's just a percentage of people flat across the board.

85
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:29,744
Speaker 0: I don't know.

86
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,920
Speaker 0: How do we un-prevent that from happening?

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,390
Speaker 1: Is it because do people actually get more conservative?

88
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,700
Speaker 1: or were they always conservative?

89
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:42,420
Speaker 1: But they their baseline was the technology level like just ahead of them when they were teenagers.

90
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,199
Speaker 1: So when they become adults now, it's way behind them and they're scared.

91
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:52,670
Speaker 1: But in the course of one fucking day Slashdot like really?

92
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,256
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's two days, but 24-hour period.

93
00:05:55,602 --> 00:06:06,940
Speaker 1: Slashdots was batting a thousand for having an article a day where the comments like exposed Really deep-rooted Misogyny and racism and just conservatism.

94
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:12,860
Speaker 0: But I mean this used to be the site where you would post things like GNA for funniness.

95
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:13,825
Speaker 1: Those are still there.

96
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,052
Speaker 1: All right, but they're all.

97
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,620
Speaker 1: they're all auto-moderated to zero.

98
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,270
Speaker 1: The GNA is probably in this article if I go find it.

99
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,880
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about trolls trolly bullshit.

100
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,706
Speaker 1: It's always been in there.

101
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,820
Speaker 1: I'm talking about there's an article Men's rights activists call for boycott of Mad Max Fury Road and it linked to you know that news.

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,542
Speaker 0: I heard about that.

103
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:37,545
Speaker 1: So it linked to that ridiculous bullshit of those really psychotic people who feel this Alright, so that sounds like a good news post.

104
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,307
Speaker 0: It's pointing out.

105
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:40,233
Speaker 0: Hey, look the horrible people don't like this movie.

106
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:40,775
Speaker 1: It should be.

107
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaker 1: a lot of the comments Were people saying oh those guys don't represent MRAs.

108
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:50,027
Speaker 1: MRAs really stand for all these things.

109
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:50,951
Speaker 1: and it was basically.

110
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,235
Speaker 1: it was super downvoted.

111
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:55,684
Speaker 0: Uh, no The problem.

112
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,734
Speaker 1: see I used every mod point I had.

113
00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:05,408
Speaker 0: you're gonna see you're gonna see posts like that No matter what community you're in, but the slash shot community You see upvotes.

114
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:06,916
Speaker 0: then, you know, there's a problem.

115
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:14,860
Speaker 1: Yep So a lot of really fucked up and egregiously misogynistic things got modded way up.

116
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,619
Speaker 1: insightful and so insightful yeah, well with the C I guess.

117
00:07:21,686 --> 00:07:36,338
Speaker 1: So the day before There's another article Harvard hit with racial bias complaint and it was a link to a study showing that Asian Americans on average were rejected from you know from Harvard compared to other races.

118
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,814
Speaker 1: Well, all that, you know race being a statistical category.

119
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:48,739
Speaker 1: We know race doesn't really exist Basically, they on average had to score 140 points higher on the system than other races to get in.

120
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's probably because there's some.

121
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 0: I mean, it's weird, right?

122
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,754
Speaker 0: It's like it's racist to even explain the truth.

123
00:07:55,955 --> 00:08:03,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's true Is that you know, they study harder because their culture is to study harder generally, right?

124
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,113
Speaker 1: So there's a lot more I'm waiting for you because you're walking on the edge of that cliff.

125
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

126
00:08:08,117 --> 00:08:08,358
Speaker 0: No.

127
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:11,777
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean statistically speaking, right?

128
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,020
Speaker 0: They're gonna be smarter and have better grades and do better in school and there's more of them People in just China alone, right.

129
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:26,820
Speaker 0: So just population wise right not counting the cultural emphasis on education and better schools and everything like that.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,763
Speaker 0: So, you know, they have a quota there at Harvard probably and they're like, well We can't.

131
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:40,317
Speaker 0: if we just accepted people looking at grades only and not looking at other things This school would probably be a huge percent Asian now.

132
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:43,707
Speaker 1: This was Just an article about.

133
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:47,545
Speaker 0: you know affirmative action and those kinds of issues have a quota So they got to take.

134
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:50,080
Speaker 0: only X percent of the school should be Asian people.

135
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:56,540
Speaker 0: So they only take the creamiest of the crop and meet some people who were Asian and were smarter than some white dude.

136
00:08:57,006 --> 00:08:57,514
Speaker 0: Don't get in.

137
00:08:58,968 --> 00:09:03,327
Speaker 1: so basically Regardless, you know, it's a very complex issue.

138
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:14,940
Speaker 1: But affirmative action and the concepts around it are Probably a net positive Because systemic oppression over time fucks up whole communities in ways that are difficult to remediate.

139
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:18,940
Speaker 1: So I feel like affirmative action is probably a positive force.

140
00:09:19,272 --> 00:09:28,710
Speaker 0: Yeah the person who Got amazingly good grades and didn't get into Harvard because some other is gonna get into Yale and be just fine Yeah, their life is gonna be okay.

141
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:30,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're still on easy mode.

142
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:30,580
Speaker 1: It's fine.

143
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:39,493
Speaker 1: so the top two first basically a Bunch of ridiculous racism and anti affirmative action is all plus five insightful.

144
00:09:39,814 --> 00:09:41,800
Speaker 0: Okay, so why is it new?

145
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,145
Speaker 0: News that slash.

146
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:43,928
Speaker 0: that is awful.

147
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:49,706
Speaker 1: I basically I bring it up because slash shot I need a better place to link to.

148
00:09:49,726 --> 00:10:03,024
Speaker 1: so I'm curious if anyone out there has a place that has the baseline type of information about tech issues that slash shot has doesn't post a bunch of bullshit and Doesn't have link rot.

149
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,391
Speaker 0: Well, there's no place without link rod.

150
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:05,672
Speaker 0: Yeah.

151
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,277
Speaker 1: Well slash shot has no link rod.

152
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:15,134
Speaker 1: That's the only place Yeah, so if there is a place like that I would like to know about it and I'm sure a lot of you are thinking but what about?

153
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,442
Speaker 1: I've probably already checked that Place out.

154
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,967
Speaker 1: it probably doesn't do what I need.

155
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:32,700
Speaker 1: But anyway, I would like to stop linking to slash dot Because the community seems to be a bunch of 40 year old kind of racist kind of misogynist fat white guys living in basements or at least basement apartments.

156
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:36,174
Speaker 1: Sorry, but that's just how it feels right now.

157
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:36,980
Speaker 1: in real news.

158
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Speaker 1: Microsoft pretty much said to all you people who kept saying Oh Windows 10 upgrade is gonna be free even for the pirates.

159
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:45,292
Speaker 1: No, that's not true.

160
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,400
Speaker 0: I thought that was true.

161
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,752
Speaker 1: No Quote from slash shot.

162
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:55,233
Speaker 1: if it sounds too good to be true Then it probably is all that talk about Windows pirates getting free Windows 10 upgrades not happening.

163
00:10:55,654 --> 00:11:02,659
Speaker 1: for genuine users a free upgrade to Windows 10 means receiving ongoing Windows innovation and blah blah blah blah blah for the lifetime of that device.

164
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:08,539
Speaker 1: So you can't upgrade to Windows 10 and then transfer to another computer or anything like that.

165
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:12,538
Speaker 1: Granted that whole definition of what is a computer is pretty dubious.

166
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:17,981
Speaker 0: fine Just install my Windows 7 again on a different computer and upgrade that to Windows 10.

167
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:18,564
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

168
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:29,260
Speaker 1: But basically the article talks about how if you have a pirated version of Windows It's not just going to freely like launder your pirated copy into a legit copy and let you upgrade.

169
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:39,241
Speaker 0: A lot of people said that no the news story originally was that yes Even if your windows is pirated you will still be able to upgrade it to Windows 10.

170
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just won't be genuine because your current one isn't genuine.

171
00:11:42,722 --> 00:11:53,186
Speaker 0: And if you want it to become genuine, you'll still have to pay but you'll still be able to upgrade it and use it Just like any other non genuine windows, so they confirm Yeah that January so they may.

172
00:11:53,367 --> 00:12:06,854
Speaker 1: Microsoft made a few days ago this extremely detailed discussion of exactly how Upgrades will or will not work for people who have non genuine windows.

173
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,459
Speaker 0: So right the same way it does now.

174
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,864
Speaker 0: basically It's not really a change.

175
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:10,265
Speaker 0: This isn't?

176
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,356
Speaker 0: this doesn't contradict any of the previous information we heard.

177
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:20,660
Speaker 0: if there's any news here It's simply that people didn't read what they wrote so that they had to write it again an even clearer language for the dum-dums.

178
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:21,272
Speaker 0: You don't read.

179
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:27,823
Speaker 1: Yep So if you have to not read if you were at all confused about what's going on with Windows 10 Read this.

180
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:35,468
Speaker 1: and to as an aside if you're avoiding upgrading to Windows 10 or you're afraid of it and you're you know Windows 7 not really gonna have much choice.

181
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:38,949
Speaker 0: I mean, I've been using Windows 7 probably just gonna go Windows 10.

182
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:39,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

183
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:39,942
Speaker 1: You know what?

184
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:45,537
Speaker 1: My philosophy is whenever I get a new computer Whatever the newest version of Windows is is what gets installed.

185
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,019
Speaker 1: on that thing.

186
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,480
Speaker 0: People also people always be hating on Windows versions.

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,830
Speaker 0: The only Windows version that deserves any real hate is Windows ME.

188
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,037
Speaker 0: even Vista totally worked.

189
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:55,020
Speaker 0: I had no problems with it.

190
00:12:56,821 --> 00:12:59,830
Speaker 1: I bought Windows fucking 2000 like right when it came out.

191
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:00,292
Speaker 1: I was proud.

192
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,940
Speaker 1: That was a great great OS for its time.

193
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:04,989
Speaker 0: I'm sorry Windows finally has the right idea though.

194
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,160
Speaker 0: not charging you a fucking fortune to get Windows, right?

195
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:19,220
Speaker 1: I should be free and then they should charge you for you know, you know, it's interesting how a lot of people Suspected that Windows would get cheaper or something like this would happen if Linux on the desktop became a serious competitor?

196
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:28,840
Speaker 1: No, but yet instead this all happened Basically right after we put the last nail in the coffin of Windows of a Linux on the desktop and buried it under some rock.

197
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,916
Speaker 0: And I'll OS X is the competitor.

198
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:35,537
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah also non-computers.

199
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:38,966
Speaker 1: So you got any news.

200
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:40,432
Speaker 0: I do have a news so check.

201
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,300
Speaker 0: so this story is really interesting.

202
00:13:42,843 --> 00:13:45,119
Speaker 0: It's sort of obvious once you think about it.

203
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:48,960
Speaker 0: But it's like you don't think about it until you hear the story.

204
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Speaker 0: So there was a drug dealer and the drug dealer was smart.

205
00:13:55,122 --> 00:13:57,212
Speaker 0: He was a smart drug dealer.

206
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,740
Speaker 1: they had those drugs in the stove.

207
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,968
Speaker 0: They couldn't catch him right.

208
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,119
Speaker 0: his drug Dealey website was all encrypty and whatnot.

209
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:11,938
Speaker 0: I guess you know, they had a hard time finding what he was all about, you know He had a hit a pretty secure action going on.

210
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:26,020
Speaker 0: but What they did is you know, they I think they bought some drugs from him or they got him to buy some drugs from them and They sent the drugs by USPS because you'd be some drug dealers.

211
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:32,020
Speaker 0: They they just deliver their drugs like by driving around or by delivering through UPS, you know, you go to UPS.

212
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,908
Speaker 0: They say are there any hazardous things and you're using?

213
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:34,852
Speaker 0: no and they mail it.

214
00:14:34,872 --> 00:14:36,880
Speaker 0: They don't inspect every frickin package, right?

215
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know if they got him to buy something.

216
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:52,552
Speaker 0: if they they bought something from him But they basically had it shipped by US Postal Service, which the government has access to and they Check the tracking right.

217
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:53,840
Speaker 0: the package had tracking.

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,004
Speaker 0: So, okay.

219
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:57,310
Speaker 0: Someone shipped a package.

220
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,254
Speaker 0: It was being tracked.

221
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,700
Speaker 0: How do we find the person?

222
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,600
Speaker 0: It's not like they put their return address on it, right?

223
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,083
Speaker 0: You don't know.

224
00:15:02,324 --> 00:15:03,812
Speaker 0: they went to the post office and mailed it.

225
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:05,319
Speaker 0: You don't know where they live or whatever.

226
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:09,375
Speaker 0: They guess they could have checked the cameras at the post office, but they don't know that either.

227
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:13,045
Speaker 0: but Uh, they went to see.

228
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:17,740
Speaker 0: someone went to the website to check the status of the package.

229
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:26,760
Speaker 0: Oh and they checked the logs of the US Postal Service website And they saw which IP address visited to check the status of that package.

230
00:15:27,362 --> 00:15:31,860
Speaker 0: The only person who had the tracking number the person I guess the drugs are going to or from or whatever.

231
00:15:32,153 --> 00:15:32,862
Speaker 0: Wow You know what.

232
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:36,937
Speaker 0: and then they went to the ISP and like hey who's that IP address belong to?

233
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:38,684
Speaker 0: and then they went boom We got your drug dealer.

234
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:40,551
Speaker 1: That is actually very similar.

235
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:42,980
Speaker 0: Nothing illegal or shady about that whatsoever.

236
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:50,957
Speaker 1: That's very similar to the way you can detect if someone is you know sniffing packets from your network to spy on you.

237
00:15:50,977 --> 00:16:08,331
Speaker 1: if You watch your DNS servers for Requests to find out the names of IP addresses that no one's using Because you're putting a fake traffic on network segments to see if anyone looks into it because someone knows that IP They've been snooping around.

238
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,880
Speaker 0: this is why you know cloudflare.

239
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:11,426
Speaker 1: Yeah I know cloudflare.

240
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:14,805
Speaker 0: so cloudflare is basically like the number one company in terms of.

241
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:29,274
Speaker 0: I don't want to have to deal with blocking bots from hitting my website or going down because I'm getting flooded with traffic and basically the way they manage to do this is that they handle so many different people's web traffic That they are able to.

242
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:35,500
Speaker 0: you know Basically when one person gets attacked they can build a defense for that attack and apply it to everyone who's using cloudflare.

243
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:48,640
Speaker 0: But when you use cloudflare you make them your DNS server also for reasons like you just said So that they can see the DNS requests coming in and that additional information is what makes their blocking so effective.

244
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:59,311
Speaker 1: so anyway things Of the day, so I have a map here.

245
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,516
Speaker 1: Scott saw it from the distance.

246
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:01,460
Speaker 1: He was like, what's that map?

247
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,771
Speaker 0: It's a map of the bunch of those triangles.

248
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:04,555
Speaker 0: Those are poops.

249
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,520
Speaker 0: Those aren't triangles.

250
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,988
Speaker 0: Is that like someone went around town pooping and that's?

251
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:13,741
Speaker 1: these are the most popular places in Miami where human beings just poop in the Street.

252
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:15,869
Speaker 0: Oh my god that like that.

253
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,060
Speaker 1: You can see say Miami, Miami.

254
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:20,619
Speaker 1: So Florida man, Florida man is pooping.

255
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:26,180
Speaker 1: Florida man really likes to poop at the corner of Frasier Avenue and Northeast Second Avenue.

256
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,031
Speaker 0: There must be something there.

257
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:38,780
Speaker 0: No, Frasier Street You should use Street View on that map and see like what kind of object there is people can get behind Like an alley or maybe a dumpster that they can get behind the scatological Atlas.

258
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,087
Speaker 0: Okay, the scatless.

259
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:43,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I would like to see something like this for New York City.

260
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:46,243
Speaker 0: New York City mostly.

261
00:17:46,263 --> 00:17:48,449
Speaker 0: you get people peeing on trees and whatnot.

262
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:57,918
Speaker 0: because or door frames because like you're a taxi driver you drive around All over the city and you can't pee in your car really and there aren't a lot of public bathrooms to use.

263
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,800
Speaker 0: and you know It's like you gotta get out of your car.

264
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:03,100
Speaker 1: You pee in a milk jug and then at the end of the day you leave it in a dumpster.

265
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,005
Speaker 1: That's how you do that.

266
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's a lot of peeing situations in New York.

267
00:18:07,021 --> 00:18:08,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, pooping is another level though.

268
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:16,803
Speaker 1: Now actually this is sort of a social justice thing in the sense that they're trying to Get public bathrooms.

269
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:25,874
Speaker 1: They're trying to bring attention to the fact that most of the people doing this are homeless people Yeah, when there's no public bathrooms who are also possibly mentally ill.

270
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:32,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no help for them either Of course not, but good place to go cuz no one no one gives a shit.

271
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:35,774
Speaker 0: If I was a homeless, I'd go to somewhere like Miami where it's warm.

272
00:18:35,874 --> 00:18:36,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would not.

273
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,428
Speaker 1: you know I would not go to Miami though.

274
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:42,694
Speaker 1: I would not go to a place somewhere warm Yeah, but I would not go to the place all the other homeless people are.

275
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:47,179
Speaker 1: but then again I have the luxury of being smart and not mentally ill.

276
00:18:47,782 --> 00:18:52,195
Speaker 1: So I could figure think like I can make a plan that a lot of these people really can't.

277
00:18:52,276 --> 00:18:56,019
Speaker 0: I mean seriously at worst you'd Be that you know homeless teenager.

278
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:57,840
Speaker 0: Well, not teenager anymore.

279
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,617
Speaker 1: I'd be that creepy old guy hanging around a can be in the public library and the Starbucks with your internet.

280
00:19:03,657 --> 00:19:09,119
Speaker 0: Yeah homeless You know anyway, oh, yeah, this is an interesting thing All right.

281
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:24,300
Speaker 0: So this is just an image of a tombstone or part of a tombstone of someone named K. I don't know the rest of their name, but the tombstone has a recipe on it for K's fudge and I kind of want to make K's fudge.

282
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:30,280
Speaker 0: So, I guess they you know, they got the recipe over K's dead body.

283
00:19:33,102 --> 00:19:35,848
Speaker 0: It says on the tombstone wherever she goes there's laughter.

284
00:19:35,868 --> 00:19:46,147
Speaker 0: so this is probably like an amazing fudge bacon lady K and would have been a good person to know and That's awesome tombstone.

285
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,460
Speaker 1: You gotta have a sense of humor about death.

286
00:19:49,343 --> 00:19:53,679
Speaker 0: I would I would have a tombstone like that if I had some sort of secret to reveal.

287
00:19:53,719 --> 00:20:00,219
Speaker 0: that Would be useful to people who didn't know who I was and came around the cemetery years later.

288
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:04,274
Speaker 1: Yeah So in the meta moment, the book club book is still Watership Down.

289

290
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:09,591
Speaker 1: We could watch the movie too.

00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's an animated movie.

292
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:21,551
Speaker 1: It's short short and good and then we can do a show on it and then we can do the next book club book, which is Dangerous, you're not gonna tell me what it is.

293
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,040
Speaker 0: I'll tell you after we finish.

Speaker 0: Yeah in July and it's already end of May.

300
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:45,245
Speaker 1: It's a great con.

301
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,471
Speaker 1: like we would go to it.

302
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:50,826
Speaker 1: Even if we weren't running the panels department Airplane to get there.

303
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:51,690
Speaker 0: I would not go.

304
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:56,871
Speaker 0: if you can get there with a car It doesn't matter what kind of geek interest you have.

305
00:20:56,931 --> 00:20:59,098
Speaker 0: if you can get to Connecticut with a car you should.

306
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,966
Speaker 0: yeah It's worth your weekend.

307
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:01,850
Speaker 0: Even in the summer.

308
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,674
Speaker 0: It's worth your weekend.

309
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would.

310
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,135
Speaker 1: Well, we did go before we were running all these departments.

311
00:21:07,236 --> 00:21:08,000
Speaker 1: We had fun every year.

312
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,508
Speaker 0: I should just quit working and then just play games.

313
00:21:10,548 --> 00:21:10,990
Speaker 0: all the whole.

314
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,000
Speaker 1: I know Connecticut is a better tabletop than most gaming cons.

315
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:20,565
Speaker 0: Like I mean you'll see if you if I quit and you keep the job you'll still like give me a panel, right So I'd have to pay.

316
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:33,179
Speaker 1: and then and one last thing just because it's happening If you're a friend of ours who is an enforcer at PAX Go look at the enforcer shit because something's happening a good thing, but don't forget to do the thing.

317
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:39,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, like seriously, don't forget you don't have all the time in the world to do the thing.

318
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,140
Speaker 1: You'll be really sad if you don't do the thing.

319
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,233
Speaker 1: So go to the place and look at the thread and do the thing.

320
00:21:45,253 --> 00:21:46,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did the thing today.

321
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:48,406
Speaker 0: I also did the thing today.

322
00:21:48,426 --> 00:21:51,359
Speaker 1: I want to make sure that all my awesome enforcer friends do the thing.

323
00:21:51,641 --> 00:21:58,995
Speaker 1: Yep, and if you're not an enforcer and that sounds intriguing Whenever they open up general enrollment again, try to be an enforcer.

324
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:00,080
Speaker 1: It's really awesome.

325
00:22:00,201 --> 00:22:04,560
Speaker 0: I heard for prime that that last year they didn't even because they had enough roll call.

326
00:22:04,701 --> 00:22:06,672
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'll call is still going for another week.

327
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:07,336
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

328
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,353
Speaker 1: So this is the kind of article that someone who doesn't know us too.

329
00:22:11,393 --> 00:22:14,604
Speaker 1: Well would see and say oh wow I'm Scott are probably happy about that.

330
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,331
Speaker 1: This is the worst idea in the world.

331
00:22:17,512 --> 00:22:18,254
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

332
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:25,103
Speaker 1: European telecoms are considering blocking mobile ads Full stop.

333
00:22:25,664 --> 00:22:33,865
Speaker 1: they're considering putting basically an ad block on the ISP to block ads on Mobile carriers, right?

334
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,251
Speaker 0: So I go to a website.

335
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,380
Speaker 0: I have Verizon phone, right?

336
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:41,300
Speaker 0: The website tries to send me over their HTML.

337
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:55,879
Speaker 0: Yeah And the Verizon website the Verizon server before it gives me the HTML looks at it Find stuff it considers to be ads using in similar technology to ad block and then removes them from that HTML and sends me the resulting HTML.

338
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,905
Speaker 1: now Net neutrality is Cut and dry.

339
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:12,180
Speaker 1: The reason we want net neutrality is because carriers ISPs telcos Providers they should not have any right to fuck with your traffic in any way.

340
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:17,375
Speaker 1: I should be able to send whatever poop I want over those pipes.

341
00:23:17,456 --> 00:23:22,269
Speaker 1: if I break a law with that poop I break that law and someone comes and gets me.

342
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,939
Speaker 1: but I can send whatever I want over the pipes, right?

343
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,500
Speaker 1: They can't differentiate between my brown poop and my black poop.

344
00:23:29,782 --> 00:23:31,211
Speaker 0: We just talked about the post office.

345
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:33,823
Speaker 0: right if I mail drugs I mail drugs.

346
00:23:33,964 --> 00:23:41,110
Speaker 0: the post office shouldn't be messing with what's in my package or changing the address on it or Doing anything to it, right?

347
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,660
Speaker 0: They are a delivery service.

348
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,665
Speaker 0: Their job is to deliver and deliver only.

349
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:53,744
Speaker 0: so your ISP whether it's mobile Verizon or home Verizon or whoever you got They should just be delivering the packets You want delivered.

350
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:57,119
Speaker 0: the server on the other end will then deliver packets back to you.

351
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:58,560
Speaker 0: Everyone's just sending packets.

352
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:09,559
Speaker 0: Their job is to send those packets without modifying them in any way shape or form and then whoever receives those packets May respond or not respond as they so choose.

353
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:16,640
Speaker 1: But rim and Scott you guys run adblock and you block ads and you talk constantly about how much you hate ads.

354
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,607
Speaker 1: Why don't you just not care about this?

355
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:19,711
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna net benefit.

356
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:21,959
Speaker 0: That is my choice to block those ads.

357
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:34,720
Speaker 1: The The protocol the whole point of the world wide web is that I can provide data with markup hypertext transport markup language.

358
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:41,400
Speaker 1: I am marking up data with hyperlinks and putting it somewhere so that anyone in the world can go to that place.

359
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:47,940
Speaker 1: Take that data down take that markup language down and display it and process it as they see fit.

360
00:24:48,842 --> 00:24:54,780
Speaker 1: I happen to take that HTTP traffic and remove ads from it and reformat it before I look at it.

361
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,923
Speaker 1: Some people don't.

362
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,613
Speaker 1: some people change the colors of websites with local style sheets.

363
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:01,859
Speaker 1: That's the whole point of the world wide web.

364
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,200
Speaker 0: Consider like a simple use case.

365
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:13,920
Speaker 0: I'm making a website and I put one tasteful advertisement on it and then I you know Make a mobile version of that website and I'm going to go on my phone and test to see if this advertisement is working.

366
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:24,059
Speaker 0: Oh the ad is being blocked by the ISP and I cannot see my own advertisement and now I don't know what advertisement it is And it's much harder to get another phone to look at it.

367
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,911
Speaker 0: And this is just the basic example that I came up with in two seconds.

368
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:27,915
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

369
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,080
Speaker 0: So now I can't even see it.

370
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,648
Speaker 0: There's no way to turn that ad block off.

371
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,215
Speaker 0: It's not my ad block right?

372
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:35,723
Speaker 0: The ISP is Basically fucking with.

373
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:40,973
Speaker 0: it's like someone sent me a letter and the ISP opened it up and crossed off a few sentences and send To me.

374
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,754
Speaker 0: Senses were full of bullshit, but that's not for them to judge.

375
00:25:44,995 --> 00:25:46,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's my letter.

376
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:48,226
Speaker 0: I'll cross out those sentences if I want to.

377
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:49,951
Speaker 1: now there's also the matter of intent.

378
00:25:50,573 --> 00:25:59,040
Speaker 1: if this were some like nerdy ISP that was an option among many saying hey, we're the ISP that blocks ads right?

379
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,730
Speaker 0: it's for example, you have a cool nerdy ISP.

380
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:08,053
Speaker 0: they you can log into their website and Enable or disable or configure ad blocking as you choose.

381
00:26:08,093 --> 00:26:10,160
Speaker 0: they give you a proxy server as a service.

382
00:26:10,507 --> 00:26:11,020
Speaker 0: That's okay.

383
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:24,800
Speaker 0: I could set up my own proxy server on my own point my phone at it and Block ads my own that way and if an ISP wants to offer that as an option That's actually really cool, but to force it upon you is not cool.

384
00:26:25,021 --> 00:26:26,707
Speaker 1: So it there's pretty much.

385
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:32,791
Speaker 1: from digging around a bit there are at best three likely Actual motivations as to why they're exploring.

386
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,875
Speaker 0: Well, I can think of one.

387
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:34,960
Speaker 0: You're an ISP.

388
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,451
Speaker 0: Yeah ads take up bandwidth.

389
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,240
Speaker 0: you can save a lot of money.

390
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:41,359
Speaker 0: I mean the ads aren't making you any freaking money, right?

391
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:47,460
Speaker 0: So if you block them, you're gonna save money because they're gonna be less data transfer over your lines all these ads.

392
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:52,457
Speaker 0: They're probably losing thousands and thousands of dollars just transmitting ads back and forth.

393
00:26:52,537 --> 00:27:03,398
Speaker 1: counter-argument Bandwidth is actually especially in Europe Insanely cheap to the point that these savings there would be negligible and probably less than the cost of implementing such a system.

394
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,575
Speaker 1: Mmm Here's my real reasons why I think they're doing it.

395
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:13,183
Speaker 0: either one You maybe you think customers will like you more because you're blocking ads and because they don't understand the net neutrality Aspect.

396
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:17,000
Speaker 0: they're just like ooh, I'll switch to that ISP or switch that mobile carrier.

397
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,827
Speaker 0: They block all the ads and it's way better.

398
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:31,116
Speaker 0: It's faster to use my phone and it's all you know, they can advertise higher Speeds and who knows what they may be doing this so that they can then sell The ability to sell ads to their mobile customers.

399
00:27:31,256 --> 00:27:37,760
Speaker 0: that is Very very not only that is not only bad that is possibly illegal, right?

400
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,960
Speaker 1: Well should be but we don't have net neutrality.

401
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:52,759
Speaker 0: that would be like if you know someone buys ads in the newspaper and I subscribe to the newspaper and The paper boy not only takes a scissor and removes the ads from the newspaper before delivering it to me.

402
00:27:53,421 --> 00:28:03,371
Speaker 0: He takes money from the local drugstore and takes a you know tape and tapes that Drugstores ads over or where the other ads used to be.

403
00:28:03,652 --> 00:28:06,200
Speaker 0: and now the paper boy is taking a cut from the drugstore.

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, right fucking over the newspaper.

405
00:28:10,151 --> 00:28:12,880
Speaker 0: and then the people buying ads in the newspaper and me.

406
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,800
Speaker 0: We're all getting fucked by this paper boy.

407
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,746
Speaker 0: We have a new job is to deliver that paper in the original condition and if he fucks with it He should be fired.

408
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:24,442
Speaker 1: All I can think of you're saying that is $2.

409
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:34,976
Speaker 1: So I saw that movie a bunch of times recently just randomly, okay, so uh The other reason they might be doing it is to try to fuck Google because we know Europe.

410
00:28:35,097 --> 00:28:36,460
Speaker 0: Europe hates guzzy European store.

411
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,528
Speaker 0: Yes, Europe hates Google so much.

412
00:28:38,629 --> 00:28:41,460
Speaker 1: Europe has like such this ridiculous hate boner for Google.

413
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:43,367
Speaker 1: They're basically trying to break Google up.

414
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:46,720
Speaker 1: They're trying to break Google's, you know, quote-unquote monopoly with it.

415
00:28:47,212 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 0: I mean I Would be more sympathetic if it weren't for the fact that one they only go after Google and know and know the other giant companies.

416
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they went after Microsoft way back in the day way back.

417
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically hate the fact that it's an American company, right?

418
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:03,420
Speaker 0: If Google was a European company, they wouldn't do jack shit.

419
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,362
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

420
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:08,795
Speaker 0: So the fact that basically like Google has a monopoly on search.

421
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,557
Speaker 0: No question.

422
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:10,500
Speaker 0: Sorry, they do.

423
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,791
Speaker 1: Well, they don't because there are alternatives that are legitimate.

424
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,155
Speaker 0: This is an alternative.

425
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,520
Speaker 0: doesn't mean that you don't have a monopoly.

426
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:16,921
Speaker 1: Well, they have.

427
00:29:16,962 --> 00:29:24,691
Speaker 1: they have a. they have a I guess feature monopoly in the sense that Google search is Literally objectively superior to every other.

428
00:29:24,732 --> 00:29:26,560
Speaker 0: imagine if there were three car companies.

429
00:29:27,102 --> 00:29:30,980
Speaker 0: Two of the car companies are basically selling you goes and one was selling real cars.

430
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:36,559
Speaker 0: That's a monopoly just because there's some other competitor if their product can't really do shit.

431
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,823
Speaker 1: so what's the line?

432
00:29:38,164 --> 00:29:43,378
Speaker 1: is Google being anti-competitive by shutting out anyone who can compete like actively?

433
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,517
Speaker 1: or They being anti-competitive just by the fact that they're that much superior and they're free?

434
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:52,579
Speaker 0: right being Being anti-competitive and just out competing, right?

435
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:58,080
Speaker 0: For example, you know, Michael Schumacher, he won f1 championships year after year after year.

436
00:29:58,241 --> 00:30:01,620
Speaker 1: It's not like he was going to other drivers houses and like waking him up at night, right?

437
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:02,202
Speaker 0: Why?

438
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:05,222
Speaker 0: because he's a better driver Right.

439
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:07,889
Speaker 0: Well and also he was in a better car, but they were just.

440
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:09,213
Speaker 0: they didn't cheat.

441
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,016
Speaker 0: They were just better.

442
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:16,597
Speaker 0: Lance Armstrong Cheated he won out competed by breaking the rules.

443
00:30:16,738 --> 00:30:18,944
Speaker 0: Google Doesn't break the rules.

444
00:30:18,964 --> 00:30:19,185
Speaker 0: They're.

445
00:30:19,566 --> 00:30:23,880
Speaker 0: they're just better at doing search and no one can do it as well as they do it.

446
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,830
Speaker 1: I was gonna is now.

447
00:30:25,971 --> 00:30:35,320
Speaker 0: I mean they didn't break any rules Yet, but Europe's strategy is basically make rules such that Google is breaking them and that is you know.

448
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:44,600
Speaker 0: It's like if they were to come out with the anti-drug rules after Lance Armstrong cheated or it wouldn't have been cheating Because the rule didn't exist when he did it, but the rule did exist when he did it.

449
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:47,395
Speaker 0: So he cheated but Google didn't break any rules.

450
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:51,820
Speaker 0: while they're doing stuff Europe just tries to make new rules to make what Google is already doing.

451
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:52,741
Speaker 0: No good There

452
00:30:52,781 --> 00:31:10,220
Speaker 1: seems to be a sentiment when I was poking around that a lot of your a lot of people in Europe at least on Like sort of the government II level have this argument that Google and ads like that are basically Forcing this American culture and this commercialism on Europe and they should have the right to protect themselves from it.

453
00:31:10,742 --> 00:31:12,067
Speaker 0: Okay, you can protect yourselves from it.

454
00:31:12,589 --> 00:31:13,895
Speaker 0: Google will just stop serving you.

455
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:20,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Kind of look forward to the day when Google does what they did to China where they're like, yeah, fuck it We'll just be in Hong Kong.

456
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:31,340
Speaker 1: Yeah So to me, it's interesting because Europe does not have any tech company That exists on the level of a Google or a Microsoft.

457
00:31:32,103 --> 00:31:32,826
Speaker 0: I wonder why?

458
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:36,460
Speaker 0: maybe they because they keep treating them like this and not doing things properly.

459
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:42,681
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there's no real free speech in Europe and the EU has done a lot of squirrely things like this in the past Right.

460
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:47,100
Speaker 0: Well, it's reasons like this that tech companies are not going to put their shit in Europe.

461
00:31:47,501 --> 00:31:55,877
Speaker 0: Right if you have you know, all these kinds of restrictions and poor policies and I start a tech company Why the fuck would I put it in your country?

462
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:59,413
Speaker 1: Yeah now I don't want to put it necessarily in the US either because the spying.

463
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,260
Speaker 1: but maybe I'll go to Ireland.

464
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,050
Speaker 1: That's where a lot of people are putting their data lately.

465
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:06,064
Speaker 0: There are a lot of tech companies going in Ireland Bad spot.

466
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:11,762
Speaker 1: so the right way to do this is to block the ads at the client level the way the internet was intended mm-hmm.

467
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:18,445
Speaker 1: and a lot of people don't seem to understand how that shit actually works and To this day.

468
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,620
Speaker 1: It amazes me when I see someone not to get it.

469
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:31,600
Speaker 1: You know, I we knew some people who try to argue that is morally unethical like it to block ads to which I say Oh fuck is it morally unethical to change the color on a website?

470
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,157
Speaker 1: You're looking at to use a text-based browser to be blind and use the internet.

471
00:32:36,177 --> 00:32:36,679
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

472
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:45,474
Speaker 1: But to a lot of people who use adblock even like they they download Basically something that looks like adblock and is called adblock.

473
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:49,023
Speaker 1: That is actually just malware Happens a lot.

474
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:53,414
Speaker 0: the current thing you should use is the you block or micro block.

475
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:55,500
Speaker 0: That is the current adblock thing.

476
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:56,858
Speaker 0: That is the right one to use.

477
00:32:57,181 --> 00:33:02,500
Speaker 1: So in the old days like I was blocking ads in the 90s like as soon as the internet I had internet.

478
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:05,020
Speaker 1: It's the first time I saw an ad I was like.

479
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,231
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's a way to not see that because I grew up in a household where every night the TV shows like The Simpsons that we watched.

480
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:19,964
Speaker 1: someone's job was to record it and Pause the recording to cut out all the commercials so that the rest of the family could watch the shows Without ads.

481
00:33:19,984 --> 00:33:23,138
Speaker 1: so we all took turns being the ad blocker for the family.

482
00:33:23,158 --> 00:33:35,552
Speaker 1: Yep So when I got a computer the first time I saw an ad I immediately started editing my host file and Maintaining basically a list of IP addresses that ads came from right.

483
00:33:35,592 --> 00:33:38,540
Speaker 0: so basically what this method is the oldest jankiest method.

484
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:45,820
Speaker 0: So your host file is basically something that every computer every desktop PC has right and I'm sure phones have it, too.

485
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:56,579
Speaker 0: You just can't access it right because it's in the file system somewhere where you can basically hard code DNS entries and your computer your DNS, you know stack will basically not in.

486
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,920
Speaker 0: you know Contact any DNS servers if there's an entry in your host file.

487
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,615
Speaker 0: so you can go in your host file and type in google.com and some IP address after that.

488
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,099
Speaker 0: or I guess the IP address comes first.

489
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:17,639
Speaker 0: and Now if you go to any browser any application on your whole computer and you type in google.com It's not gonna go out to the DNS servers on the internet and figure out what is the IP address to google.com?

490
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,599
Speaker 0: It's just gonna trust that the IP address in the host file is the right one and use it.

491
00:34:22,121 --> 00:34:34,938
Speaker 0: So if you say find out that a particular domain ads dot rim calm Has a bunch of ads coming from it and that domain doesn't really do anything else There's no other reason you would ever contact it.

492
00:34:35,322 --> 00:34:37,233
Speaker 0: You just go in your host file and type in like.

493
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:40,326
Speaker 0: look one two seven Oh one adds that rim calm.

494
00:34:40,386 --> 00:34:46,406
Speaker 0: and now when your web browser tries to make a request to get the ads from as their M It's gonna hit a server.

495
00:34:46,446 --> 00:34:47,309
Speaker 0: that's not even serving.

496
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,120
Speaker 0: any web content is no HTTP server there.

497
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:55,797
Speaker 0: It's gonna timeout and nothing will happen and you won't see those ads on your browser.

498
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:56,743
Speaker 1: now It turned out.

499
00:34:56,844 --> 00:35:04,860
Speaker 1: even back then there were people who were making Large host files that you could download and deploy where they'd already figured out where all the ads were coming from, right?

500
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,780
Speaker 0: Because when you're serving up a website, you don't put the ad server on the same exact.

501
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,612
Speaker 0: You know machines as that are serving up the web page.

502
00:35:11,672 --> 00:35:18,160
Speaker 0: unless you're trying to get around that kind of ad block Even if you do it, it's infrastructurally difficult and you're at least gonna put it at a different path.

503
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,578
Speaker 0: It'll be like rim comm slash ads or rim night.

504
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:33,671
Speaker 0: It's very very difficult to have those ads mixed in with everything else at the same URLs So that there's no way to determine based on the domain and or URL path Where it's an ad and what's not.

505
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,760
Speaker 1: so that was the next level of heuristics.

506
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,240
Speaker 1: That was when ad blocking as software as opposed to hacks started to exist.

507
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,140
Speaker 0: Well, it started to exist when they started to make browser extensions, right?

508
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:54,615
Speaker 0: Originally, there were just browser plugins and the way browser plugins worked was that when you typed in a URL The browser knew how to handle HTML, JPEGs, GIFs, pings, right?

509
00:35:54,636 --> 00:35:55,378
Speaker 0: Those sorts of things.

510
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:55,940
Speaker 0: You mean GIFs?

511
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it didn't know how to handle for example an SWF.

512
00:35:59,941 --> 00:36:05,060
Speaker 0: So you get a plug-in and now if the browser hit an SWF it said well, I don't know what to do with that.

513
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:16,700
Speaker 0: Let me see if any of these plugins that are installed are registered to handle SWF and it would find one flash and it would say Okay Execute flash and give it this file to do its thing.

514
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:29,468
Speaker 1: So you basically stick a plug-in that would grab everything along the way and then use heuristics Like there were standard sizes for ads and standard locations for ads right or any image in those locations It would just not download plugins.

515
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:32,500
Speaker 0: plugins didn't really block ads because of the way that they work.

516
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,670
Speaker 0: They were very bad at that.

517
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,876
Speaker 0: I don't even know if there was an ad block But I use the one extensive.

518
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:46,080
Speaker 0: once people made Extensions right with the beginning that came around with the first Firefox known as Phoenix known as Firebird known as whatever, right?

519
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:59,811
Speaker 0: once you had extensions that actually allowed you to interact with the browser API and sort of execute JavaScript on every web page and modify CSS and every web page programmatically Then you got to be really clever with the ad blocking.

520
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,120
Speaker 0: you could be like, okay, you just got the HTML.

521
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:13,580
Speaker 0: Here's the execute this JavaScript on this page and like search for anything URLs matching these patterns and replace them with this and searcher right and then render the page after applying that.

522
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,711
Speaker 0: So now you can really block ads very very intelligently

523
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:28,929
Speaker 1: and now you have an increasingly complex set of heuristics to figure out What isn't is not an ad based on context because in the old days like you could just block anything slash ads Slash anything and assume it was an ad

524
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:31,399
Speaker 0: but that one method I used to use would just be

525
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:32,755
Speaker 1: Turn off all

526
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:34,851
Speaker 0: Images from automatically loading.

527
00:37:34,872 --> 00:37:41,981
Speaker 0: Yep on a whole page You just wouldn't see any images and then if you wanted to see an image you would explicitly click and that would make the image Load.

528
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,066
Speaker 1: I did that too.

529
00:37:43,367 --> 00:37:45,254
Speaker 1: And I also did that with JavaScript's.

530
00:37:45,314 --> 00:37:46,820
Speaker 1: I did that with flashes, right?

531
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,919
Speaker 0: Well, this was in the day in the earliest days, you know.

532
00:37:49,281 --> 00:37:54,474
Speaker 0: It's like people would just be like don't use JavaScript because JavaScript is only used to do annoying bullshit.

533
00:37:54,514 --> 00:37:56,600
Speaker 0: It wasn't have any legitimate use.

534
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:59,816
Speaker 1: Well, you can't right click on my website brah.

535
00:38:00,118 --> 00:38:11,540
Speaker 1: Yeah So the interesting thing is that that technology like the early ad block extensions Often had options that don't exist in a lot of them today.

536
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,731
Speaker 1: The one in particular is whether or not to be in stealth mode.

537
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:26,118
Speaker 1: So in the old days they would either not download the ad elements at all to save you bandwidth or Download everything and just not show you.

538
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:37,668
Speaker 0: well Just not showing was what happened with the earliest extensions because they could really just do a lot of CSS modifications that would set like display none on all the things the Containers that had ads and that was easy to do.

539
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:40,760
Speaker 0: It was much harder to stop the browser from making the requests.

540
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:45,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it took a while for extension technology and browser api's to advance before they could do that.

541
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:55,240
Speaker 1: But nowadays I feel like we need to go back because an increasing number of terrible websites Will if they detect that you didn't download the ad elements will not display content.

542
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:57,766
Speaker 0: Hmm I haven't seen that.

543
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:01,740
Speaker 1: I've bumped into that a lot and I've been doing some research about it.

544
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:07,340
Speaker 0: What I have seen is people basically putting a non ad image behind the ad.

545
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,945
Speaker 0: So the ad is blocked.

546
00:39:09,025 --> 00:39:09,948
Speaker 0: you see this thing.

547
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:11,834
Speaker 0: that's basically like you blocked our ads.

548
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,620
Speaker 0: frowny face and I'm like tough shit.

549
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:15,469
Speaker 1: So Fark does that.

550
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:16,554
Speaker 1: they always have a thing at the top.

551
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:17,740
Speaker 1: that I've been seeing for years.

552
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:19,385
Speaker 1: Let's wait for it to come back again.

553
00:39:19,405 --> 00:39:22,293
Speaker 1: It basically says Fark lives on ad revenue.

554
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:23,938
Speaker 1: Please white list us.

555
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:26,169
Speaker 1: Nope Oh, look, it didn't know there it is.

556
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,114
Speaker 1: There it is.

557
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:27,919
Speaker 1: There it is.

558
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,240
Speaker 1: Okay, so but I've been running into that increasingly mostly from websites.

559
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,789
Speaker 1: I wouldn't just like if I go to a site and anything is broken because of my ad block I just never go to that site again.

560
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:45,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, but The arms race is trivial to advance ad block.

561
00:39:45,734 --> 00:40:00,080
Speaker 1: That is undetectable is trivial to implement and The technology will go back down that road if ads start creeping in again because right kinds of people who run ad block Don't fucking want to see ads and are never going to buy anything because of an ad they saw.

562
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:05,440
Speaker 0: So the way the stealth mode worked is that your web brat you would get your browser to still make the request for the ad.

563
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:13,858
Speaker 0: So you would you know send a get request out to the web service and give me that ad and then you just ignore Everything that came back and they don't have any idea that you did that.

564
00:40:14,341 --> 00:40:20,750
Speaker 0: no, so as far as they know you tried to load all the ads but They don't know that you didn't actually load any of the ads.

565
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,637
Speaker 0: you just ignored all that data that came through.

566
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:23,844
Speaker 0: you didn't let it Slow you down.

567
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:25,939
Speaker 0: You just blocked it on your port or whatever, you know.

568
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:37,392
Speaker 1: Now the bandwidth is cheap and ad ad blocker blockers like like n-jammer jammers are getting increasingly Agro, we're gonna go back to that and that arms race.

569
00:40:38,074 --> 00:40:39,920
Speaker 1: ad blockers will always win, right?

570
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,474
Speaker 0: Well, the one of the problems here is the fact is the interstitials.

571
00:40:44,755 --> 00:40:46,380
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's fraud, right?

572
00:40:47,142 --> 00:40:52,136
Speaker 0: So the fraud situation is so the person who's selling the ads.

573
00:40:52,236 --> 00:40:53,159
Speaker 0: I own the website, right?

574
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:59,340
Speaker 0: I want to increase the numbers of people who click on the ads and I want to increase the number of times ads are displayed.

575
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:03,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, because then I get more money Irrespective of the quality of who sees them.

576
00:41:03,353 --> 00:41:11,321
Speaker 0: sure and I you know if I could I would lie to the person buying the ads and tell them a much bigger number than reality to get more money from Them.

577
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:22,160
Speaker 0: if someone visits my website and blocks the ads, but I count them as having seen the ads This person who's buying ads for me is now paying for an ad that no one saw.

578
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:23,628
Speaker 1: Yep, but opposed to.

579
00:41:23,668 --> 00:41:27,987
Speaker 0: if I just legitimately block the ads I'm not I'm a web so far could get.

580
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,014
Speaker 0: so the current method FARC gets screwed over.

581
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,703
Speaker 0: the advertiser doesn't pay FARC because the ad Wasn't seen.

582
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:45,696
Speaker 0: with the stealth kind of way FARC is getting paid But the advert person buying the ads is getting fucked because no one's seeing the ads but they're paying like someone is seeing them And they have no way to know who saw them and who didn't and what the real number is now

583
00:41:45,877 --> 00:41:46,419
Speaker 1: option two.

584
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:56,680
Speaker 1: the first one the one where FARC the odd just doesn't get downloaded is better for everyone because Honestly to this day it amazes me the number of people who don't run any form of ad blocking.

585
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,351
Speaker 1: I mean, I see their computers.

586
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:08,319
Speaker 1: They always have some malware and Websites look like shit Yeah, and there's garbage everywhere, and there's like pop unders and all this crap happens to them, but they live with it.

587
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:13,000
Speaker 1: So those are probably the kinds of people who also will in fact click on an ad.

588
00:42:14,181 --> 00:42:17,094
Speaker 1: Maybe like the people who go out of their way to run ad block.

589
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:21,195
Speaker 1: you're better off Having like just pretending they don't exist.

590
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:26,100
Speaker 0: ad wise well Yes, and no if you're getting if you want to increase your conversion rate, right?

591
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:32,216
Speaker 0: So if you want to be able to say to an advertiser You're a website selling ads you want to be able to say to them look we have a 50% click-through rate.

592
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:35,990
Speaker 0: We show an ad twice it gets clicked on once.

593
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:38,860
Speaker 0: that means half the people who visit our site are clicking on this ad.

594
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,728
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a ridiculously high rate.

595
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:43,260
Speaker 0: like like a few percent is considered high, right?

596
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:43,661
Speaker 1: You're right.

597
00:42:43,681 --> 00:42:47,456
Speaker 1: in that case you want the people who are anti ad to just not see the ads right.

598
00:42:47,476 --> 00:42:52,132
Speaker 1: otherwise your quality click Go down, but if you're goes down right so, but that's only a thing.

599
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:54,460
Speaker 0: see different kinds of ads happen on the internet.

600
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,613
Speaker 0: You got to understand the business of ads on the internet right.

601
00:42:56,653 --> 00:43:04,600
Speaker 0: so if I'm advertising Some free-to-play game on my website I'm gonna be probably getting conversion rates.

602
00:43:04,922 --> 00:43:13,706
Speaker 0: You know are what I want to be high because I'm probably getting paid Based on the number of people that sign up and start playing the game After clicking a link on my website.

603
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:15,311
Speaker 0: same thing like an Amazon affiliate link.

604
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:19,163
Speaker 0: right you get paid if people buy products and Amazon after Clicking your link.

605
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,267
Speaker 0: you want conversions.

606
00:43:20,288 --> 00:43:28,294
Speaker 0: you want people to click, but if I'm my advertiser is Ford they just want people to see the ad to sort of get forward in their brains.

607
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:30,819
Speaker 0: if your advertiser is coca-cola They just want people to see it.

608
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,194
Speaker 0: They don't need someone to click through and buy coke.

609
00:43:33,214 --> 00:43:39,760
Speaker 0: but again if I watch I'm gonna be getting paid based on how many thousands of people see it And I just want that number to be as high as possible.

610
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,632
Speaker 0: So if people are using adblock I'm getting fucked because no one's seeing the ad.

611
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:49,936
Speaker 1: but if people aren't using adblock Then the person who bought the ad is now getting fucked because they're showing their car ad to.

612
00:43:49,956 --> 00:43:51,368
Speaker 1: a bunch of people live in New York City.

613
00:43:51,551 --> 00:43:52,120
Speaker 0: they don't care.

614
00:43:52,964 --> 00:44:04,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because the problem the real problem is the entire advertising industry and when terms of the internet is in my opinion a huge broken bubble of fake ads.

615
00:44:04,939 --> 00:44:09,079
Speaker 0: all Advertising industry period is a huge broken bubble regardless of media.

616
00:44:09,099 --> 00:44:12,174
Speaker 1: well No, because the fucked up thing is traditional internet more.

617
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:19,054
Speaker 1: so yeah I've seen so many studies that show that traditional car ads and soda ads Directly correlate to sales.

618
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:19,780
Speaker 1: people are that dumb?

619
00:44:19,961 --> 00:44:34,548
Speaker 0: I'm sure that they work to some extent But it's still a scam in terms of how much they pay for the ads Verses it right, but it's a system where everyone involved in the system Neat like has a like.

620
00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:37,060
Speaker 1: they benefit from a positive feedback loop.

621
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:42,740
Speaker 1: No one has any desire to introduce the bad news of reality into that system.

622
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:44,125
Speaker 1: So it turns into a bubble.

623
00:44:44,406 --> 00:44:58,303
Speaker 1: the stock market does not have that problem because you can sell shorts Mm-hmm otherwise if you couldn't sell short No one involved has any reason to say anything bad about any stock ever because everyone wants stocks to go up forever Right.

624
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,670
Speaker 0: so so consider this right.

625
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:05,943
Speaker 0: so outside my window right now at work I mean, I'm in Times Square just a bit north of it, right There's an ad.

626
00:45:05,963 --> 00:45:11,102
Speaker 0: there's an ad that keeps changing and usually it's two big billboards next to each other and they're usually Advertising.

627
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,607
Speaker 0: some hot movie that's coming out soon.

628
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:13,449
Speaker 0: so right now.

629
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,857
Speaker 0: It's about Jurassic World, which is looks like garbage.

630
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:16,800
Speaker 0: I heard it's terrible.

631
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,450
Speaker 0: I'm sure it is.

632
00:45:17,471 --> 00:45:19,505
Speaker 0: so Why is that?

633
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:22,420
Speaker 0: there is there anyone who's going to see Jurassic World?

634
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,360
Speaker 0: After seeing that who would not have seen it otherwise?

635
00:45:25,581 --> 00:45:34,332
Speaker 0: Maybe a very small number of people right who even notices this thing in the in the Times Square area right now I've at the same time that maybe look out the window, but I'm not seeing it.

636
00:45:34,593 --> 00:45:35,436
Speaker 1: Maybe enough people.

637
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,380
Speaker 1: I mean spam works.

638
00:45:36,922 --> 00:45:39,471
Speaker 1: Maybe some people are just that influenceable.

639
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,740
Speaker 0: consider how much it costs to put that up there.

640
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,740
Speaker 0: You're making what a few hundred people see it.

641
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,051
Speaker 0: You're not making up for the cost of those frickin things right.

642
00:45:47,071 --> 00:45:49,964
Speaker 0: that is not a cost-effective advertisement I would not believe.

643
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:51,810
Speaker 0: but are you any stretch of the imagination?

644
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:58,500
Speaker 1: if it really wasn't to enough the people involved Then it wouldn't be there like the the money funnel keeps.

645
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:03,660
Speaker 0: So this is why this is because you have to understand the people right that are happening here.

646
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,319
Speaker 0: So the first person is like the producer executive of Jurassic World, right?

647
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,554
Speaker 0: They like the fact that there's an advertisement for their movie in Times Square.

648
00:46:13,015 --> 00:46:14,299
Speaker 0: They like seeing that it's for them.

649
00:46:15,302 --> 00:46:16,911
Speaker 0: They like seeing it there there.

650
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:18,480
Speaker 0: We our company buys ads.

651
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:20,359
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure those ads don't do shit.

652
00:46:20,721 --> 00:46:25,987
Speaker 0: But you'll see people in our company are like I saw our ad on the Metro North train today And they'll take a picture of it and post it.

653
00:46:26,048 --> 00:46:28,420
Speaker 0: and it's like the ad is for the person buying it.

654
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,390
Speaker 0: They like to see their name in lights and they're paying to see their name in lights And they don't give a shit if it sells one goddamn product.

655
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,180
Speaker 0: see now at the same time or they falsely believe it's selling product.

656
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,003
Speaker 0: They don't care right.

657
00:46:38,144 --> 00:46:40,896
Speaker 1: so I feel on a gut level that you're right about this to a degree.

658
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:44,180
Speaker 1: at the same time There is real evidence.

659
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:45,690
Speaker 1: There is a lot of fun.

660
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,862
Speaker 0: that is a significant factor And that's what's.

661
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:56,414
Speaker 0: that factor is what's making up for the fact that the ad is not cost-effective Because that extra price premium they're paying for the ad is for.

662
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,080
Speaker 0: I want to see my name in light.

663
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:05,500
Speaker 1: there is also an argument that those kinds of ads are Holding ground to not cede space to a possible competitor.

664
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,426
Speaker 0: That's also true.

665
00:47:06,607 --> 00:47:16,560
Speaker 1: if there's no ads for your Broadway tickets No ads for Broadway tickets at all then some startup that like gets some people together and does something can advertise in an empty space.

666
00:47:16,823 --> 00:47:17,995
Speaker 0: That's true an empty field.

667
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:23,120
Speaker 1: now I'm just paying to keep grass in the place that your competitor is gonna set up shop right now.

668
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,886
Speaker 0: There's another factor here right?

669
00:47:25,247 --> 00:47:27,434
Speaker 0: so that person you know for that movie.

670
00:47:27,735 --> 00:47:29,220
Speaker 0: We all know about movie budgets, right?

671
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,700
Speaker 0: They got to get the expenses way high, so there's no profits.

672
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, so just buy ads.

673
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,410
Speaker 0: you can get the expenses away.

674
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,695
Speaker 0: has movie specific though?

675
00:47:35,715 --> 00:47:35,855
Speaker 0: right?

676
00:47:35,895 --> 00:47:37,019
Speaker 0: not every industry is like that.

677
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,844
Speaker 0: There's a step below.

678
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,148
Speaker 0: so this producer.

679
00:47:40,208 --> 00:47:41,953
Speaker 0: They're not buying the ads themselves.

680
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:44,240
Speaker 0: you think they called up clear channel to buy a billboard.

681
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:45,263
Speaker 0: Give me a break.

682
00:47:45,323 --> 00:47:48,574
Speaker 0: right there's a person who works for them and that person is an ad buyer.

683
00:47:48,854 --> 00:47:50,580
Speaker 0: their job is to buy ads.

684
00:47:50,942 --> 00:47:52,254
Speaker 0: Their job is to spend money.

685
00:47:52,294 --> 00:47:54,366
Speaker 0: they get a budget And they must spend it all.

686
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:56,776
Speaker 0: if they don't spend it all that budget will shrink it.

687
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:57,720
Speaker 0: the budget shrinks too much.

688
00:47:57,821 --> 00:47:58,592
Speaker 0: They don't have a job.

689
00:47:58,855 --> 00:47:58,997
Speaker 1: now.

690
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:06,860
Speaker 1: remember There's an unstated assumption that you need ads in certain spaces so they'll buy them to write what that person's job is to buy ads.

691
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,241
Speaker 0: That's it.

692
00:48:07,322 --> 00:48:08,607
Speaker 0: It's the easiest job in the world.

693
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:11,980
Speaker 0: you call people up and buy the most impressive fucking ads you can buy.

694
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:15,532
Speaker 0: You don't give a shit if it caught much it costs or how effective it is.

695
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:17,359
Speaker 0: right you don't get paid based on that.

696
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,384
Speaker 0: you Get promoted.

697
00:48:18,424 --> 00:48:20,597
Speaker 0: because look I got us a billboard in Times Square.

698
00:48:20,617 --> 00:48:21,443
Speaker 0: look how awesome I am.

699
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:22,454
Speaker 0: I got us a Super Bowl ad.

700
00:48:22,475 --> 00:48:23,421
Speaker 0: look how awesome I am.

701
00:48:23,702 --> 00:48:27,333
Speaker 0: the more impressive ads that person buys the more they are praised.

702
00:48:27,653 --> 00:48:32,311
Speaker 0: the more they get raises the more they get promoted And then move up to some job, but they have to do shit right.

703
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:35,504
Speaker 0: so of course It doesn't matter.

704
00:48:35,524 --> 00:48:38,454
Speaker 0: if you're selling ads who are you selling them to?

705
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,203
Speaker 0: you're not selling them to someone who cares How effective they are.

706
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:46,960
Speaker 0: you're selling them to this ad buyer person who just wants the most impressive fucking shit that you can sell them.

707
00:48:47,201 --> 00:48:50,192
Speaker 1: Now you see there's a couple reasons for this too though.

708
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:56,058
Speaker 1: for startups for small companies Those ads can get them on the radar of companies that might buy them.

709
00:48:56,078 --> 00:48:59,250
Speaker 0: mmm Yeah, they also don't care if they mean they somewhat care.

710
00:48:59,592 --> 00:49:08,080
Speaker 0: everyone somewhat cares if the ads are effective But mostly the person buying the ads even though the company as a whole might want the ads to be effective.

711
00:49:08,642 --> 00:49:13,980
Speaker 0: Right the person who actually makes the decision of what ad to buy only cares about how impressive it is.

712
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,272
Speaker 1: But the smart companies the small like those companies that have really smart people.

713
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:27,920
Speaker 1: they're advertising in quotes Mostly through social media and word-of-mouth and clever things that aren't just ads on websites.

714
00:49:28,422 --> 00:49:31,457
Speaker 0: I mean there are people out there buying ads who care about how effective is.

715
00:49:31,497 --> 00:49:31,678
Speaker 0: right?

716
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:36,819
Speaker 0: some guy Just started his dry cleaning business, and he's gonna maybe buy in the yellow pages, right?

717
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,266
Speaker 0: That's not gonna be effective these days.

718
00:49:39,286 --> 00:49:40,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, but pages.

719
00:49:40,751 --> 00:49:43,160
Speaker 0: It's like they actually care about how effective is.

720
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,300
Speaker 0: They're gonna look and see how many you know they're not buying it to see their dry cleaners name and lights.

721
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,266
Speaker 0: They want to know.

722
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,320
Speaker 0: is this getting me more customers?

723
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:52,348
Speaker 0: You know am I building a customer base with this?

724
00:49:52,368 --> 00:49:54,075
Speaker 0: and if they're not they'll stop buying that ad.

725
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:54,356
Speaker 0: right.

726
00:49:54,376 --> 00:49:59,834
Speaker 0: so there's two different kind Of ad buyers out there, but these big-time website ones is mostly the.

727
00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:01,900
Speaker 0: I want to see my name in lights ad buyer.

728
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:06,746
Speaker 1: The worst thing now is like like Hulu like a terrible example is like ads I want to block.

729
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,485
Speaker 1: even if you pay for Hulu They still show you the ads.

730
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:17,054
Speaker 1: of course you can't pay to not see them and the ads are literally 100% for things that I will never buy.

731
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:17,556
Speaker 0: nope.

732
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:28,259
Speaker 1: so What's interesting is that a lot of ad blocking software can even like within like the Daily Show and stuff like that in Video detect an interstitial ad and skip it.

733
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:33,480
Speaker 0: I don't see any YouTube ads anywhere at all except on mobile except on mobile right.

734
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,445
Speaker 0: But I can said I've just.

735
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:40,122
Speaker 0: I should set up a proxy like I just said yeah my own proxy So that I control not the eyes I like.

736
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:46,645
Speaker 1: do these people realize that if they like Hulu sometimes won't work now with like some ad blocking things and a lot Of video sites try to block it?

737
00:50:46,766 --> 00:50:49,600
Speaker 1: you Google smartly is not on desktops.

738
00:50:50,142 --> 00:50:54,019
Speaker 1: But if they make it to where ad block gets detected and doesn't work I?

739
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:02,620
Speaker 1: Foresee a real ad blocking technology like real software that people use that it won't skip the ad because it can't.

740
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,980
Speaker 1: It'll show you like random YouTube videos of puppies during the ad because I'd rather see that or nothing.

741
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:15,560
Speaker 1: I'd rather see a blank screen and nothing and a minute and 30 second countdown timer than any ad for anything.

742
00:51:15,761 --> 00:51:18,740
Speaker 0: And what if there's no countdown timer at all and you didn't know how long it was gonna be?

743
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:20,740
Speaker 0: I don't know you don't know if it's broken or not.

744
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,738
Speaker 1: I don't know how long the fucking ads gonna be either.

745
00:51:22,818 --> 00:51:29,668
Speaker 0: well No actually on YouTube and Hulu and most video ads on the internet They seem to have a countdown that tells you how long the ad.

746
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:35,150
Speaker 1: so I'll show that and I'll keep streaming the ad to the hard Drive and then dumping it to dev.

747
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:36,820
Speaker 1: no just so I keep streaming it.

748
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,414
Speaker 1: They think I'm watching it and maybe even have heuristics to detect like.

749
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:41,980
Speaker 1: does it show a quiz or a survey at the end?

750
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,965
Speaker 1: yeah I pick a random answer.

751
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,097
Speaker 0: I just don't watch anything on Hulu.

752
00:51:45,117 --> 00:51:45,680
Speaker 0: That's my snow.

753
00:51:45,801 --> 00:51:47,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, problem is a lot of good stuffs.

754
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,560
Speaker 1: moving over to Hulu like South Park is all on Hulu.

755
00:51:50,202 --> 00:51:51,987
Speaker 0: I just get it from the Pirate Bay.

756
00:51:52,368 --> 00:51:57,806
Speaker 1: I'd rather not pirate, but I'm kind of driven to just Advertisement.

757
00:51:57,846 --> 00:51:59,453
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fire it if that's the easiest.

758
00:51:59,514 --> 00:52:00,920
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get things the easiest way.

759
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,746
Speaker 1: I know what we actually just bought.

760
00:52:02,827 --> 00:52:04,192

Speaker 1: Yeah, we even bought a Steven Universe on Amazon.

763
00:52:08,665 --> 00:52:09,427
Speaker 1: just it was easy.

764
00:52:10,109 --> 00:52:10,691
Speaker 0: How much was it?

765
00:52:10,912 --> 00:52:11,976
Speaker 1: I like 20 bucks a season.

766
00:52:12,437 --> 00:52:13,260
Speaker 0: That's actually a good deal.

767
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it wasn't that bad at all is it?

768
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,920
Speaker 0: you buy DVDs or digital digital?

769
00:52:17,021 --> 00:52:18,930
Speaker 1: DVDs me if I got DVDs.

770
