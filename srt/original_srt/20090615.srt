1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,549
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday June 15th.

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,212
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:14,560
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:17,854
Speaker 0: The pain of my existence the bane of my existence.

5
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:19,119
Speaker 0: ticketing systems.

6
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,154 --> 00:00:37,779
Speaker 0: So I get to my building this morning You know going into work, and they finally completed the construction on the facade, but it's not.

8
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,085
Speaker 1: It's still got a scaffold going.

9
00:00:40,145 --> 00:00:45,578
Speaker 0: the word Lincoln has been excised from every possible place in this building.

10
00:00:45,598 --> 00:00:47,806
Speaker 0: Wow The statue is gone.

11
00:00:48,127 --> 00:00:51,240
Speaker 0: all the quotes that were in like bronze on the walls are gone.

12
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:55,994
Speaker 0: There are these plates these gilded plates and every every elevator every hallway.

13
00:00:56,014 --> 00:01:02,704
Speaker 0: the word Lincoln is gone from all of them And now they have renamed it one grand central place Grand central place.

14
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,968
Speaker 1: yep, is that an actual address?

15
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,865
Speaker 1: now it is Where's grand central place?

16
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:09,349
Speaker 0: directly in front of grand central.

17
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:11,396
Speaker 0: since when it's right now?

18
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:12,539
Speaker 1: What Street is that?

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,026
Speaker 0: 42nd Street.

20
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,535
Speaker 1: Grand 42nd Street is not grand central place.

21
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:17,500
Speaker 1: It is the second Street.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,680
Speaker 0: No, 60 East 42nd Street is now one grand central place.

23
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:22,025
Speaker 1: What the fuck.

24
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,050
Speaker 1: you can't just be like.

25
00:01:23,391 --> 00:01:29,075
Speaker 1: I mean it's one thing right like if you live on a street And you want to change your number and no one else has the number you want to use.

26
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:30,180
Speaker 1: you don't like the number you got.

27
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:34,172
Speaker 1: But and you know let's say you're on the corner of say.

28
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:35,196
Speaker 1: I don't know.

29
00:01:35,577 --> 00:01:38,104
Speaker 1: fifth and 45th right.

30
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:41,220
Speaker 1: so maybe your address is like something 5th Avenue.

31
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:44,316
Speaker 1: You could change it as something 45th Street if you know.

32
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,160
Speaker 0: there are addresses.

33
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:48,540
Speaker 0: I mean there there's something places and something squares which are on a street.

34
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:54,499
Speaker 0: But the place or the square name which is a legitimate address includes neither Street at the cross-section.

35
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,800
Speaker 1: They basically made up a street grand central place.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,091
Speaker 1: There is no road that is called grand central place.

37
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:04,880
Speaker 0: there are many addresses all over American cities that don't have the name of the street.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,900
Speaker 0: They're actually on in them places and plazas and all sorts of stuff like that.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,146
Speaker 1: No, because most of the ones I know of anyway There are plenty that aren't it exists.

40
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:20,660
Speaker 1: look like for example Apple is one infinity loop, but Infinity loop is the name of the street that's in their private campus there.

41
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't have to be the real Street.

42
00:02:22,114 --> 00:02:24,963
Speaker 0: in a lot of places RIT it's law.

43
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:29,740
Speaker 1: Memorial Drive is the actual road that's RIT owns is the private road that they got it.

44
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:30,986
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's bullshit.

45
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:32,252
Speaker 1: You can't just make up a new street.

46
00:02:32,814 --> 00:02:33,638
Speaker 0: They do it all the time.

47
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:34,824
Speaker 1: actually I've never seen it.

48
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:37,115
Speaker 0: Okay, and you can't even name one besides Scott.

49
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:37,557
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

50
00:02:37,577 --> 00:02:38,180
Speaker 0: You've never seen it.

51
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:39,225
Speaker 0: It happened here.

52
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:39,748
Speaker 0: I can.

53
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:41,035
Speaker 1: yeah, that's why I'm saying it's bullshit.

54
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 1: It shouldn't be allowed to.

55
00:02:42,401 --> 00:02:45,979
Speaker 0: Okay, the city actually was all for it and the post office already accepts the address.

56
00:02:47,121 --> 00:02:47,663
Speaker 1: They're stupid.

57
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:48,286
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

58
00:02:48,547 --> 00:02:48,768
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

59
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,134
Speaker 1: She put me in charge.

60
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:51,480
Speaker 1: I would said no, okay.

61
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:55,039
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's all I got this morning.

62
00:02:56,585 --> 00:02:57,920
Speaker 0: You just had all this righteous indignation.

63
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,708
Speaker 1: So, why do they actually?

64
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,356
Speaker 1: why they didn't do this?

65
00:03:02,376 --> 00:03:03,120
Speaker 1: just for no reason?

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,990
Speaker 1: I mean it cost money to change the facade on a building.

67
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,135
Speaker 1: Why did they spend all that money?

68
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:11,720
Speaker 0: for it's a much more memorable Name, it makes it kind of a trophy address and all that sort of stuff.

69
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:13,423
Speaker 1: Were they trying?

70
00:03:13,463 --> 00:03:15,591
Speaker 1: are they like having trouble selling space in the building?

71
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,960
Speaker 0: actually much of New York City is right now, really?

72
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,373
Speaker 0: Yeah real estate in the city for commercial purposes is pretty cheap.

73
00:03:21,794 --> 00:03:23,100
Speaker 1: turn it into apartments, baby.

74
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,680
Speaker 0: No, because apartments can't be in those places and don't work in those buildings.

75
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,652
Speaker 1: There are buildings that have residential and commercial space in them.

76
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is possible to make it happen.

77
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:34,746
Speaker 0: This is one of those pre-war buildings.

78
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,573
Speaker 0: They cannot retrofit it that easily.

79
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,620
Speaker 0: They have enough trouble getting water to the bathrooms.

80
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:46,864
Speaker 1: You know the pre-war buildings are sort of problematic but when they do these so called gut renovation to them and put in the nice new appliances they Are very desirable.

81
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:51,614
Speaker 1: and you know, in fact, you know, I'm not a fan of like the exposed brick But many people are they like that.

82
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:55,960
Speaker 0: actually, you know, though There's not enough incentive to do that because it would cost so much to gut a building like that.

83
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,891
Speaker 1: Spend money to change the address that cost almost nothing.

84
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,538
Speaker 1: You're not making money with the empty space.

85
00:04:00,638 --> 00:04:01,140
Speaker 1: That's sure.

86
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,420
Speaker 0: I mean changing the address the facades all together cost almost nothing.

87
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,210
Speaker 1: I would live in office space if they let me they should okay.

88
00:04:07,631 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just I just put a shower in there Alright, so there's like a bajillion bajillion tech news.

89
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:20,845
Speaker 1: We haven't done a Monday show in like forever and there was palm pre and there was iPhone and there was fuck fuck Everything in the universe.

90
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,600
Speaker 1: So in order to cover it all we'd have to do a tech news roundup.

91
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:25,646
Speaker 1: But you know what?

92
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:33,400
Speaker 0: I think most of these stories have already been covered Extensively, that's just not Scott's excuse for not wanting to actually look into these any further.

93
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:41,490
Speaker 1: I've looked into all of them extensively because I've myself listened to and read much of the coverage that you can also Listen to Henry.

94
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:42,640
Speaker 0: I found most of it lacking.

95
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,040
Speaker 0: I mean, I listen to GD GT's roundtable about the pre and it was garbage.

96
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:49,180
Speaker 0: They basically said nothing interesting and they talked a lot about the business.

97
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

98
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:52,100
Speaker 1: I did listen to that today and I was sort of disappointed.

99
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,856
Speaker 1: They didn't talk about like the specifics like, you know, how does the synergy syncing thing work?

100
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,040
Speaker 1: How many things can you say?

101
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:04,437
Speaker 0: Palm the company Web OS something in the future, but no specifics.

102
00:05:04,457 --> 00:05:04,860
Speaker 0: No detail.

103
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,764
Speaker 1: It's like I need to know.

104
00:05:05,785 --> 00:05:10,055
Speaker 1: I want to know like, you know, okay the web browser on the phone How fast is it?

105
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:10,318
Speaker 1: Does it?

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,197
Speaker 0: Basically did was speculate the exact same things that I personally could have speculated.

107
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:17,503
Speaker 0: They didn't give me anything I didn't know.

108
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really need some sort of you know in you know.

109
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,166
Speaker 1: Give it to you because I don't have the phone.

110
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:27,103
Speaker 0: but best review I found so far is still the end gadget one from before The phone was out.

111
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:27,384
Speaker 0: Yeah.

112
00:05:28,046 --> 00:05:30,876
Speaker 1: So anyway, there is one story though that I think is the.

113
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:41,300
Speaker 1: it's been covered But it's not being covered enough or in depth enough anywhere I've seen and that is the fact that the next version of Apple's OS X the snow leopard because the current one is the leopard.

114
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,644
Speaker 1: I kind of hate how they did it.

115
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:45,572
Speaker 1: They did tiger leopard snow leopard.

116
00:05:45,632 --> 00:05:46,715
Speaker 1: It's like come on.

117
00:05:46,735 --> 00:05:47,658
Speaker 1: There's another cat.

118
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,926
Speaker 1: you can use Lion yet.

119
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,172
Speaker 0: It's a slight update there.

120
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:54,656
Speaker 0: They did that to kind of link the two together especially with the news you're about to talk about.

121
00:05:54,676 --> 00:05:57,309
Speaker 1: yeah, but the snow leopard.

122
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:01,025
Speaker 1: the big news is that the From everywhere.

123
00:06:01,045 --> 00:06:11,389
Speaker 1: I've read there weren't like explicit details But it would seem that if you want to upgrade from leopard to snow leopard it will only cost you $29 and perhaps 99 additional cents.

124
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:20,540
Speaker 1: To upgrade from tiger to snow leopard apparently is gonna cost a hundred and thirty dollars as usual, right?

125
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:33,448
Speaker 1: Now the thing about this news is first of all one That's great for me because I got a Mac at work and which while I have many problems with it The snow leopard actually adds a lot of features.

126
00:06:33,489 --> 00:06:36,940
Speaker 1: I want to use at work like I was after using a Mac at work.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:49,993
Speaker 1: I would never buy one for my house or for myself except for the TV the Mac mini, but They're adding exchange support to like the built-in the mat the Mac mail and calendar and such and right now I'm using a virtual machine with Windows and Outlook.

128
00:06:50,435 --> 00:06:51,340
Speaker 1: So that's a huge boost.

129
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,854
Speaker 1: So I'm and the fact that it's $30 means I'm pretty much guaranteed to get it.

130
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,339
Speaker 1: So that's good news for me.

131
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:03,847
Speaker 1: but the two things I think that's most important about this is that Apple makes all their money right?

132
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:10,840
Speaker 1: or they make money from selling hardware and such right and some other things, you know They also make plenty of money from the software.

133
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,747
Speaker 1: They do make plenty of money from the software.

134
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,040
Speaker 0: but I mean who can get away with that sort of upgrade model?

135
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,284
Speaker 0: It's very expensive.

136
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:22,380
Speaker 0: Well, it was very expensive to upgrade OS X but people kept doing it because they kept needing the new features.

137
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,273
Speaker 1: Yep, but the fact that they're doing it for $30, right?

138
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:26,700
Speaker 1: It's like they could have done it.

139
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,574
Speaker 1: They could have just had it be 130 like it was before right?

140
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,843
Speaker 1: In fact, they've got another thing Let's see.

141
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,220
Speaker 1: You've got a family and everyone in your house has max for 50 bucks.

142
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,423
Speaker 1: You can upgrade like your whole family right.

143
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:42,158
Speaker 1: the details of that I have not seen either like exactly how many can you upgrade?

144
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:44,147
Speaker 1: because I mean What if I can upgrade infinity?

145
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:52,520
Speaker 1: I'll just buy one and upgrade the whole company, you know, it's like But you know, they're basically letting people upgrade very very cheaply.

146
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:58,145
Speaker 1: So they're losing a bunch of money on that because they could charge the full 130 They've been charging.

147
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,753
Speaker 0: losing money is a relative term.

148
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:04,380
Speaker 1: They're they're Could make they could make more money is what I'm saying, right?

149
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:11,517
Speaker 1: The thing is I think that putting the price at $30 is gonna benefit them in two ways way.

150
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:18,497
Speaker 1: number one is That basically by having all the leopard people move to snow leopard They're gonna save a lot of money.

151
00:08:19,343 --> 00:08:19,824
Speaker 1: Are they gonna get?

152
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:25,712
Speaker 1: they're gonna save some money and not having to deal with leopard anymore, you know I mean well not even just leopard but pre.

153
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:26,316
Speaker 0: I mean people.

154
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,301
Speaker 0: even you know They might.

155
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:32,460
Speaker 1: people might leapfrog and jump and I still I think it's gonna cost though the full 130 to get out of Tigerland.

156
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they might know I don't think anyone's using any pre tiger anything.

157
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,220
Speaker 0: There are a lot of people there really a lot of people.

158
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:44,260
Speaker 0: I just I see people out there using the oldest oldest OS that just because they can't afford to upgrade.

159
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean you can pirate the upgrade but and I could see people upgrading out of Tigerland Even if it's expensive just so then they can get the cheap upgrade.

160
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:56,135
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I don't know if the upgrade is gonna be cheap, you know, you'd have to pay.

161
00:08:56,155 --> 00:09:00,473
Speaker 1: I guess I think it would cost 130. just go directly from Tiger to snow leopard.

162
00:09:00,513 --> 00:09:02,360
Speaker 1: That's what I'm guessing from what people have said.

163
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,679
Speaker 1: But anyway, the the thing is right.

164
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,120
Speaker 1: Microsoft has had a lot of trouble with Windows because they've had to maintain this backwards compatibility.

165
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,116
Speaker 1: People are still using Windows 98 still using Windows 2000, right?

166
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:21,620
Speaker 1: And I think that making the upgrade $30 is gonna be a long-term benefit for Apple getting all these people out of leopard.

167
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,690
Speaker 1: So they're gonna be able to abandon these older OS X's right in the long run, but to If you notice, you know Apple they got a lot of.

168
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:40,181
Speaker 1: it's sort of weird because you look at the big tech companies You know and Microsoft the Google the Apple right and they all sort of overlap in certain areas and don't overlap in other areas Right.

169
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:48,080
Speaker 1: It's like, you know Google and Microsoft sort of overlap and you know this web space But they don't overlap in the operating system space, you know.

170
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,860
Speaker 1: And then like Microsoft and Apple overlap in the operating system space and you know.

171
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,959
Speaker 1: But they don't overlap and say the game console space, you know, it's it's sort of everyone's doing a different mix.

172
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:05,713
Speaker 1: But Apple just seems to love taking shots at Microsoft That's the person that they target the most and making the OS upgrade.

173
00:10:05,713 --> 00:10:16,117
Speaker 1: 30 bucks is a huge broadside on Windows 7 because Windows 7 is gonna come out right and Microsoft isn't gonna make money selling hardware with Windows 7 on it.

174
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,140
Speaker 1: Dell makes that money.

175
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:25,240
Speaker 1: Microsoft has to sell Windows 7 and make money from the sale of Windows 7 directly So they can't afford to drop the price way down, right?

176
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:26,584
Speaker 1: So what?

177
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:31,500
Speaker 0: at the same time though remember Microsoft is still gonna make a lot of its money from corporate accounts.

178
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,860
Speaker 1: If they upgrade they might just keep sticking with 2000 XP as they've been doing now.

179
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:37,288
Speaker 0: They won't become.

180
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:45,880
Speaker 0: as far as I've seen the enterprise world Always eventually upgrades and they just they tend to stay one full version behind but they always upgrade.

181
00:10:46,082 --> 00:10:46,444
Speaker 1: I don't know.

182
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,540
Speaker 1: I don't think it's gonna be a big enough move.

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,259
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be a full-on move to 7 like it was a full-on move to 2k XP.

184
00:10:52,581 --> 00:11:00,957
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm seeing rumblings more and more than a lot of people are going to Upgrade all the way up to 7 because they skipped a lot of incremental ones along the way really.

185
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,804
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean we're right now.

186
00:11:02,884 --> 00:11:04,771
Speaker 0: we're moving on to 2008 server.

187
00:11:04,972 --> 00:11:10,640
Speaker 1: It's one thing Apple does not make a lot of Corporate licenses on OS X not nearly as many as my whole company.

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,091
Speaker 0: We bought one airbook just because we could when they first came out.

189
00:11:14,111 --> 00:11:15,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just sits there.

190
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:15,977
Speaker 0: No one likes it.

191
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:27,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, but It's a huge broadside though Because people are gonna go and they're gonna look and the Mac which is typically perceived as expensive Right and the PC which is typically perceived as a better value, which is a better value.

192
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,340
Speaker 1: It's hardware and price wise for the stuff, right?

193
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,160
Speaker 1: When they see the $30 OS upgrade on one side and the Windows 7 $200 who knows what it's gonna cost?

194
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:41,521
Speaker 1: Right, it's gonna look real bad for Windows 7.

195
00:11:41,521 --> 00:12:01,860
Speaker 1: So any money that you know Apple could have potentially made by pricing up to 1/3 the full 130 on the OS upgrade Instead by say basically they're spending $100 per upgrade to basically fire a big old cannonball at Microsoft and Windows 7 It's gonna make them look real bad unless Windows 7 gets really cheap.

196
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:08,140
Speaker 1: But if they make Windows 7 really cheap That's gonna hurt them a hell of a lot because it cost them a hell a lot of money to make it.

197
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:27,800
Speaker 0: the other thing I've seen it open up is a lot of speculation as to the eventual release of some sort of Apple netbook and the idea that this is a sort of a test and if people embrace it maybe they'll release a netbook specific version of OS 10 that's really really cheap and maybe release some ultra marked-up hardware.

198
00:12:28,302 --> 00:12:29,465
Speaker 0: That's basically a netbook.

199
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:34,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know the thing is it's like on the one hand, right?

200
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,000
Speaker 1: Apple has to play this weird game, right?

201
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,240
Speaker 1: Because the here's the one thing at Apple is that they they have a hole in their product line, right?

202
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,324
Speaker 1: There's the Mac Mini.

203
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:43,408
Speaker 1: There's the laptops.

204
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:45,376
Speaker 1: They got the full spread of laptops, right?

205
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,200
Speaker 1: Except the netbook.

206
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:50,000
Speaker 1: They've got the iMac and they got the Mac Pro.

207
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:56,540
Speaker 1: They the Mac Pro is the only Mac only Mac that you can open and do stuff inside of right?

208
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,544
Speaker 1: You can't open the iMac.

209
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:01,600
Speaker 1: You can't really open the Mac Mini, you know, you have a putty knife, right?

210
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,779
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to write.

211
00:13:04,022 --> 00:13:06,515
Speaker 1: The Mac Pro is the only one you're supposed to open right.

212
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:13,256
Speaker 1: yet There's a big hole and sort of the non ridiculous desktop that you can open right.

213
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:14,159
Speaker 1: they used to have that.

214
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:16,635
Speaker 1: remember You know, there was like the g3 towers.

215
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,367
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It was sort of the normal.

216
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:22,900
Speaker 1: It was just a normal tower computer, but you could open it, right?

217
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,690
Speaker 1: They don't make a tower computer that you can open and muss with.

218
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 1: that isn't ridiculously expensive Mac.

219
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:31,520
Speaker 0: Oh, do you need to muss with it though?

220
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:40,079
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people who would buy that, you know They're though compare I mean compared to the number of people who don't care they I think it's a product that would sell big-time.

221
00:13:40,704 --> 00:13:44,410
Speaker 0: It's I think it would sell big-time Relative to what a lot of other people expect.

222
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:51,080
Speaker 1: I don't think it would be big enough for them to bother with because there's a Lot of people they want something with like iMac horsepower, but they don't want the built-in monitor.

223
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,940
Speaker 1: They want to use their Dell monitor mouse keyboard.

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,642
Speaker 1: They've already got.

225
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:57,053
Speaker 1: but a Mac Pro is way beyond and many is not enough.

226
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:01,067
Speaker 1: The high-end Mac Mini is real powerful It is but not enough.

227
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,180
Speaker 1: and you can't like add internal drives to it and it you know.

228
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,720
Speaker 0: But Mac people more and more I see they don't want the internal drive.

229
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,116
Speaker 1: Actually Mac they get the external drive because they have to.

230
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:17,367
Speaker 0: they don't realize Mac people have jumped ahead to what I see a lot of Linux and Windows people Suddenly realizing works very well.

231
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,273
Speaker 0: You have the hard drive on your PC.

232
00:14:19,714 --> 00:14:22,940
Speaker 0: That is not the storage of everything you have It is just kind of the workspace.

233
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,382
Speaker 0: Well, that was.

234
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:27,380
Speaker 1: that's why they were selling the time machine and such or the time capsule, but that's his time.

235
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,089
Speaker 0: That's really the way to go.

236
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:30,940
Speaker 1: if you're a professional it is a good way to go.

237
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,817
Speaker 0: But regardless right the Mac here is a hole in the product line And also, I don't think it's a big enough hole for them to justify filling it.

238
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:47,100
Speaker 0: It's a hole I know because I think if they leave the hole People who are going to buy a Mac are not going to not buy a Mac in enough numbers for them to care.

239
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:55,340
Speaker 0: Basically, they're pushing those people the majority of them in one of the two directions Around the sides of the hole and thus economy of scale makes them more money.

240
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,900
Speaker 1: Look how many people would have bought like the size star if it wasn't all bootleg and crappy.

241
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,792
Speaker 0: How many really would have outside of the tinkerers and the nerds?

242
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,096
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people.

243
00:15:05,176 --> 00:15:07,805
Speaker 0: I don't think that many I think A lot anyway, we don't.

244
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:17,640
Speaker 1: if you look in the past like, you know before they got rid of that product You know some of the best-selling Macs were like that g3 tower a lot more sold a lot more than the regular old iMac.

245
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:19,286
Speaker 1: You know the first one with the color see.

246
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:23,702
Speaker 0: but back then the iMac was like it fit a very different role from what it Does now.

247
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:26,036
Speaker 0: the iMac was like the baby computer.

248
00:15:26,076 --> 00:15:29,447
Speaker 0: baby Mac is a bad-ass piece of.

249
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:30,650
Speaker 0: like the iMac.

250
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:30,971
Speaker 0: still.

251
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:35,303
Speaker 0: the new iMac and the Mac mini are some of the best industrial design I've seen in a while.

252
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:36,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, too bad.

253
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,651
Speaker 1: It's ridiculously overpriced.

254
00:15:37,792 --> 00:15:39,960
Speaker 0: inside thing is it's almost worth it.

255
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,336
Speaker 1: I mean our Mac Mac mini is only worth it because you want Something in your room with your TV to be quiet and there's no other home theater PCs that are as quiet.

256
00:15:47,637 --> 00:15:52,807
Speaker 1: for a desk free Actual desk, I would never buy any Mac Now that I've used one at work.

257
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:53,389
Speaker 1: I would never.

258
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,380
Speaker 1: it depends unless the price is way down and such.

259
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,206
Speaker 0: Of course, you know moving into a house.

260
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,017
Speaker 0: My big plan is to have no computer in my room whatsoever.

261
00:16:01,077 --> 00:16:01,740
Speaker 0: That's not caring.

262
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,187
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is right.

263
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:06,040
Speaker 1: my Apple with this hole in their product line, right?

264
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,660
Speaker 1: They sort of had to balance right on the one hand, right?

265
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:16,079
Speaker 1: They could sort of keep going along their cart route where they make a ton of money selling this overpriced hardware, right?

266
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,732
Speaker 1: And with the huge markups on it, you know, they sell or stick around.

267
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:21,500
Speaker 1: that's 20 bucks for 100 bucks, right?

268
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,137
Speaker 1: They make shit tons of money over there.

269
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:32,281
Speaker 1: But as people are going to the netbook they're price-conscious and such and such right and that stops working for them at any point Right.

270
00:16:32,322 --> 00:16:38,217
Speaker 1: what they could do is they could just sell OS X that works on pretty much any computer, right?

271
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:43,533
Speaker 1: And They can make a whole ton of money just selling copies OS X. you can run any normal computers.

272
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:45,579
Speaker 1: and then what's Microsoft gonna do?

273
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:57,960
Speaker 1: No, if you can go and buy, you know, you know Frickin snow leopard for less for a hundred bucks or less and just install it on your PC instead of Windows 7 Who's gonna buy Windows 7?

274
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:05,132
Speaker 1: I mean I wouldn't because I mean I wouldn't buy the OS X because I've learned that I don't like it at work but pretty much everyone else is gonna.

275
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,584
Speaker 1: just about Who's not gonna?

276
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:12,640
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm even considering upgrading our tiny little Mac mini as old and slow as it is.

277
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:20,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course part of the reason it's old and slow as we realized recently that that thing still only has 500 12 megabytes of RAM.

278
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:21,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, and see that's the thing, right?

279
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:30,700
Speaker 1: That's the reason I was discussing the hole in the product line because like people would buy Copies of OS X on their own to install on their desktops.

280
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Speaker 1: But if that product if that hole in the product line is filled the demand to install OS X on your own desktop Computer really goes away because now Apple has the you know piece of hardware that matches that which they don't have right now.

281
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:43,725
Speaker 0: So that would.

282
00:17:43,745 --> 00:17:48,210
Speaker 0: that was what you thought was the most the biggest or most Important bit of tech new.

283
00:17:48,230 --> 00:18:01,820
Speaker 0: I think it was an extremely important news that was very overlooked and not covered nearly enough because I think much more important is the fact that Iran may or may not be on the cusp of a student democratic revolution.

284
00:18:02,062 --> 00:18:04,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that is only partially a tech news.

285
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,888
Speaker 0: This is the thing is it's one.

286
00:18:05,908 --> 00:18:08,160
Speaker 0: I think it is relevant enough to where it is.

287
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:20,080
Speaker 0: It would deserve mention regardless but we're gonna hold off on discussing anything but the technical aspects of it until next Thursday because by then We'll have a much clearer picture of what happened and where this is going and we'll have a lot more commentary.

288
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:34,740
Speaker 0: but Technologically this I think is actually a groundbreaking event because the first time we really saw what happened here happen Was during the New Orleans disaster in the United States where the regular news media basically?

289
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,520
Speaker 0: Could not cover a story due to infrastructural problems and due to just slowness of response and all sorts of reasons.

290
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were trying to get you know, like news people in there But like the news people couldn't get there was dangerous and such and such right?

291
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,180
Speaker 1: It's hard to drive or get a car or a helicopter into a place that's flooded.

292
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,509
Speaker 0: but it was the first time where we really relied on citizen journalism and citizen journalism for the most part pulled through him.

293
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:03,519
Speaker 1: and if you wanted coverage of the nor there was that one dude who had a Webcam pointing out his window at the street and that was the dude.

294
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:04,765
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't just him.

295
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:08,200
Speaker 0: actually a lot of the covered a lot of the people in New Orleans who were Farkers.

296
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:16,782
Speaker 1: We're just on Fark posting the blow-by-blow and cool I mean that it wasn't just Fark it was all sorts of places that you know had dead internet people Congregated.

297
00:19:16,802 --> 00:19:17,184
Speaker 1: both.

298
00:19:17,204 --> 00:19:19,636
Speaker 0: Park was the primary place partly remember.

299
00:19:19,777 --> 00:19:23,956
Speaker 0: even you know If we want to go a step back earlier during that is Craigslist action a lot of it.

300
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:27,315
Speaker 0: I would still argue that the bulk of it was on Fark.

301
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:28,120
Speaker 1: No, that's you.

302
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:33,780
Speaker 1: I think you're just saying that cuz you're on Fark It was just as much going on and all sorts of other internet places.

303
00:19:34,002 --> 00:19:46,599
Speaker 0: Anyway, while I disagree with you If you look before during the 9/11 attacks when most of the major news sites Basically went down right away due to the load the places that stayed up and disseminated information were slashdot and Fark.

304
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:59,762
Speaker 0: But we've seen this evolution from 9/11 to New Orleans to now and This is I think the big turning point in kind of what it's not just the media and getting the word out But one.

305
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:04,799
Speaker 0: this is the time where it wasn't just that we found out about it before the regular news covered.

306
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:16,199
Speaker 0: it Was that the internet found out about it in depth and knew exactly to a good degree what was going on Before CNN even mentioned like even had a blip about what was going.

307
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,242
Speaker 1: yeah I mean CNN.

308
00:20:17,443 --> 00:20:25,260
Speaker 1: Leo Laporte said that CNN was showing like reruns of some Larry King interviewing some bikers While all these tweets are going down.

309
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:25,380
Speaker 1: Well,

310
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:49,112
Speaker 0: the best part was that the thousands and thousands of tweets with the hash CNN fail on Saturday night and Sunday morning Mm-hmm and the rest of the news media really wasn't covering it either and you really would have no idea this was going on Unless you either got lucky Or you happen to be on one of the plate You know happened to be listening to the people on Twitter who talked about it happened to be reading Fark Happened to be reading the Drudge Report.

311
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:52,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know this actually This I got to watch.

312
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:57,154
Speaker 1: this is Daily Show thing Apparently where they interviewed the New York Times and people have been talking about it.

313
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,420
Speaker 1: We got to watch it after the show.

314
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:04,377
Speaker 1: They said that apparently they went to the New York Times and they were like, so show me something in your newspaper.

315
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,924
Speaker 1: that happened today And there isn't anything.

316
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:12,818
Speaker 1: it all happened yesterday at the latest, you know, and that's exactly what's going on.

317
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:17,012
Speaker 1: is you have You know, you've got newspapers and you got 24-hour news networks.

318
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:20,629
Speaker 1: And even those are too slow now They're so slow.

319
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,740
Speaker 0: think about way back.

320
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:40,128
Speaker 0: I mean, I think I've told the story on the show a long time ago, but way way back when I played MMOs And I was on the realm the first MMO and I was hanging out in there and You know my family's in the other room watching the news or whatever and some guy comes into the guild hall and says Princess Diana just died in a car accident.

321
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:40,931
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

322
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,236
Speaker 0: And I was like what.

323
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:46,051
Speaker 0: and he's like, yeah, seriously I'm like, he must have heard about it on some news.

324
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:46,694
Speaker 1: That was fast.

325
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:47,356
Speaker 0: No, he's like.

326
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:51,760
Speaker 0: I just got home Like he was nearby really so we posed is really nearby.

327
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, he says this and everyone starts, you know talking about it in the realm.

328
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,943
Speaker 0: So I go to my parents.

329
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:59,377
Speaker 0: I'm like, hey Princess Diana just died and they didn't believe me.

330
00:21:59,397 --> 00:22:00,120
Speaker 0: and they're like, what do you mean?

331
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,304
Speaker 0: How could you possibly know that?

332
00:22:01,344 --> 00:22:02,408
Speaker 0: don't stop making stuff up.

333
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,879
Speaker 0: and then like four hours later the news broke.

334
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:07,123
Speaker 1: No, did they?

335
00:22:07,263 --> 00:22:08,045
Speaker 1: what did they say then?

336
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,073
Speaker 0: they basically the response was how did you know?

337
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 0: and the explanation of oh one of my guild members told me Guild members, you know online the Harpers right, but This is not a new phenomenon But this is like right now.

338
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:28,400
Speaker 0: This was the biggest instance of it ever and it's not just the media getting out.

339
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:53,311
Speaker 0: What I really am interested in is that one the Iranian government as far as we can tell has been doing its best to shut down communications to prevent more information from getting out and also Twitter and SMS are allowing the protesters to form effectively flash mobs and Almost it's almost to the point to where they can react Faster than the reactionary forces can put them down.

340
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:55,238
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely because what there is?

341
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:56,000
Speaker 1: no government?

342
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,026
Speaker 1: I think that's another thing.

343
00:22:57,166 --> 00:23:04,057
Speaker 1: No government on earth, right is Technological as technologically sophisticated as the citizens.

344
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:04,920
Speaker 1: none zero.

345
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,527
Speaker 1: There is not one that exists.

346
00:23:06,587 --> 00:23:09,540
Speaker 1: not Japan not Korea not nobody.

347
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,620
Speaker 0: It's tricky because North Korea has such a monopoly over what the citizens can get that they can effectively.

348
00:23:15,041 --> 00:23:16,807
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm saying is there's no government.

349
00:23:16,907 --> 00:23:21,100
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about its citizens per se but just citizens in general.

350
00:23:21,603 --> 00:23:23,695
Speaker 1: You know just people like us.

351
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,640
Speaker 1: there is no government.

352
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:35,060
Speaker 1: We have more sophisticated technology in this podcast that any government has in the entire world in terms of you know Communications and media and that's not you know, they have better weapons technology, obviously.

353
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:47,651
Speaker 1: But in terms of this sort of Internet's web technology No government on earth is more powerful than you and me in this room and there are people Even more powerful than us who are not governments, right?

354
00:23:47,851 --> 00:24:25,208
Speaker 0: But I think if this Sparks into the revolution if this is the tide changing in Iran if this is it This could only have happened and I feel dirty saying this because of Twitter now Not necessarily Twitter itself But just flash mobs using SMS and the Internet and whatever technologies they can to Massively and quickly mobilize and react to an emergent situation in a manner That is not just able not just the reaction but a matter of record Everyone in Iran who gets a tweet out saying, you know, I am here Even if the government silences them.

355
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,680
Speaker 0: that message got out and can't be deleted.

356
00:24:28,084 --> 00:24:34,380
Speaker 1: I also think it's it's you know Something's going on because the meta story is as big as the story story.

357
00:24:34,942 --> 00:24:35,403
Speaker 0: I mean this.

358
00:24:35,443 --> 00:24:40,058
Speaker 0: I think this weekend and the next week or so are going to be some of the more like.

359
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:41,988
Speaker 0: we're living through Very historic times right now.

360
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,160
Speaker 0: Yep, and you can follow it all on Twitter.

361
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:49,720
Speaker 1: The thing is the only thing you know, the thing that bothers me just a little bit right is you know a lot.

362
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:57,850
Speaker 1: There's a big push right to have like proxy servers set up for like Iranian people to get out to the Internet's you know And such which is all great.

363
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,320
Speaker 1: It's totally awesome, right?

364
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,080
Speaker 1: We need more proxy servers for people who are trapped behind evil firewalls and such right?

365
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:10,934
Speaker 1: but right, but First of all, you're setting up all these proxy servers now where?

366
00:25:10,974 --> 00:25:12,820
Speaker 1: where have you been, you know for China?

367
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,177
Speaker 0: I mean there have been enough Scott I do disagree with this point because we discussed this earlier.

368
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:31,211
Speaker 0: that one unlike China, which is a relatively stable situation and It it's a situation to where one more proxy is not going to immediately make a change and Announcing proxies very openly also makes it very easy to stop them.

369
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:33,720
Speaker 0: So it's a much slower kind of constant effort.

370
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you announce a proxy on Twitter.

371
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:43,160
Speaker 0: No, the government's not sophisticated enough to see that They're so stupid, but at the same time it doing like doing it that rapidly for China does not help.

372
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:44,828
Speaker 0: It's not an emergent situation.

373
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,919
Speaker 0: People aren't dying right now.

374
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,039
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about the tweeting of the proxy servers and talking about the setting up.

375
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:52,420
Speaker 0: There's a difference between the emerge.

376
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,224
Speaker 1: I mean there are.

377
00:25:53,284 --> 00:25:55,353
Speaker 1: there are proxy servers for Chinese people to use.

378
00:25:55,393 --> 00:26:02,240
Speaker 1: they exist but you know There hasn't been like this, you know, there should have been this huge push for proxy servers a long time ago.

379
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,726
Speaker 1: There's not enough Tor nodes at all.

380
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,715
Speaker 1: We should have been doing this before right?

381
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,940
Speaker 0: I just I still disagree.

382
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,650
Speaker 0: It's it's more the point that there's an emergent situation and that drives people to action because it's right now It's not just I know.

383
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,000
Speaker 1: that is why people are suddenly setting up a bunch.

384
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,120
Speaker 1: Why weren't they setting them up before?

385
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,827
Speaker 1: You know, it's it's sort of like.

386
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:22,449
Speaker 1: yeah, where were you?

387
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,422
Speaker 1: we were doing this shit like, you know years ago setting up proxies Suddenly.

388
00:26:25,462 --> 00:26:29,100
Speaker 0: now you're interested and I don't think it's that big of a deal.

389
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,560
Speaker 1: All right, and second of all, right, you know, a lot of people are tweeting out.

390
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,020
Speaker 1: You know, the IP is the proxy servers, which is totally great, right?

391
00:26:36,241 --> 00:26:37,606
Speaker 1: You know, we should totally be doing that.

392
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:43,540
Speaker 1: but if no one in Iran is following you Why are you tweeting out proxy servers?

393
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:51,960
Speaker 0: Well at the same time just spamming not necessarily What if you I mean depends on the hashtags you're using and certain hashtags for could include all the time.

394
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,111
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously some people are doing it wrong, but you can't hurt.

395
00:26:55,472 --> 00:26:56,275
Speaker 1: No, it can't.

396
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:58,041
Speaker 0: don't follow anyone on Twitter hardly So.

397
00:26:58,061 --> 00:26:58,765
Speaker 1: that's why I hate.

398
00:26:58,805 --> 00:26:59,729
Speaker 1: that's why it doesn't bother you.

399
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:03,349
Speaker 0: I don't care if people spam and if someone does spam I just stop following them forever.

400
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:10,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is it's like I'll see us I'll see a some proxy server listings come out from like the Craigslist, you know Craig of Craigslist, right?

401
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:18,040
Speaker 1: And then I'll see a retweet from like some dude I know who obviously is like, you know, barely any followers and it's like, okay, really?

402
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,860
Speaker 1: You're not helping you just spamming, dude.

403
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:26,939
Speaker 0: Okay That's the same situation after 9/11 when everyone tried to give blood even though it got to the point to where there was.

404
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:31,400
Speaker 0: no That's so true because people they they care.

405
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,300
Speaker 0: I mean, these are people who you know all they knew like to feel like they're helping but they're not helping.

406
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,444
Speaker 0: They knew about Iran.

407
00:27:36,745 --> 00:27:38,330
Speaker 0: They did care now.

408
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:41,320
Speaker 0: It is like it is a I'm not doubting anyone's caring.

409
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:43,384
Speaker 0: Now it's like air.

410
00:27:43,505 --> 00:27:46,936
Speaker 0: now it's an emergent situation and there are people dying.

411
00:27:47,016 --> 00:28:00,340
Speaker 0: it is now like Like the desire to take action and to be altruistic is overpowering and if you are powerless I'd never begrudge anyone even if they're helping ineffectively if they want to help and they try not begrudging them if they want to help.

412
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:09,540
Speaker 1: But I'm saying is maybe we need a way to channel these want to help energies in a way that actually helps You know because right now it's like, you know what?

413
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,645
Speaker 1: We've managed to jet.

414
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:12,595
Speaker 1: it's like we've managed to generate all this electricity.

415
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:16,520
Speaker 1: We're losing it all as heat You know, we got a. we got to send the wire the right way.

416
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:29,820
Speaker 0: Maybe just go to the park or follow the right things on Twitter and there are people organizing very massive Units, there are people there are groups of people that all they're doing is gathering every picture They can and getting them all over the world as much as possible.

417
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:29,910
Speaker 0: Yeah.

418
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:41,397
Speaker 1: So if you want to help right don't just sort of do a retweet of something uselessly actually think about what you're doing and Try hard to do something that actually means something.

419
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:46,064
Speaker 1: if you you know If you're one of these people that actually cares instead of you know Just spamming on Twitter.

420
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:54,813
Speaker 0: my simple idea my tiny little thing and I see I saw some other people doing something like this Because the symbol of this right now is green like people are wearing green.

421
00:28:54,853 --> 00:28:56,960
Speaker 0: That's kind of the solidarity symbol already.

422
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:01,160
Speaker 0: Just get all your friends together put on green armbands or something.

423
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:06,760
Speaker 0: Take a picture and put it out there and hope that Iranians see Americans, you know American kids standing beside them.

424
00:29:07,284 --> 00:29:08,759
Speaker 1: It's that helps more than spamming.

425
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:19,084
Speaker 0: It's a. I mean it seems so little but imagine someone in Iran seeing people that are nominally You know a country that has always been kind of at odds with them and the youth of that country standing by them Mmm.

426
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:21,133
Speaker 0: Now it gave me a much more interesting idea.

427
00:29:21,153 --> 00:29:22,016
Speaker 1: You can send them cookies.

428
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,152
Speaker 0: I Like the idea of police are so busy dealing with protests.

429
00:29:26,172 --> 00:29:27,938
Speaker 1: They won't notice our cookies putting together.

430
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:33,338
Speaker 0: Imagine this What if we made a device and all it does is if you give it power it?

431
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,835
Speaker 0: Creates and a wireless network a y-max as big as it can.

432
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,060
Speaker 1: now we wanted to do this forever.

433
00:29:39,522 --> 00:29:48,540
Speaker 0: But and it also know but I realized the way to make this effective and it'll seek it You know, it'll communicate with any other near nodes nearby any access points anything you can find.

434
00:29:48,882 --> 00:29:51,279
Speaker 0: Maybe it even has a web cracker in it just to be sure.

435
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:57,800
Speaker 0: And but it should be entirely autonomous, but to it should have to know two inputs for power.

436
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:05,711
Speaker 0: you know positive negative and it should be able to take just about any power source with the idea that You just drop them batteries.

437
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:14,971
Speaker 0: No, you drop them over a country Just everywhere and the idea is that all you have to do is steal a car battery Plug this into a car battery and leave it somewhere.

438
00:30:14,991 --> 00:30:17,400
Speaker 1: Well, you could all see his actual batteries, too.

439
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:25,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a car battery is the pretty the most ubiquitous Long-term source of cars everywhere in the world have the same kind of car battery except for stupid Britain.

440
00:30:26,462 --> 00:30:29,512
Speaker 0: Now the plus or minus is the first with their stupid positive ground.

441
00:30:29,753 --> 00:30:31,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the worst idea ever.

442
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:49,719
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I mean, you know, we've always you know the internet really, you know while the the web on the high level The internet is a mesh and a web and a grid, you know and such right on the art and the infrastructural level The internet is still a hierarchy on one end and then sort of like, you

443
00:30:49,739 --> 00:31:02,997
Speaker 0: know Imagine if we were getting, you know smuggling into a country where there is discontent little nodes that together with simple power that a non-technical person can plug in and get to work would create an unstoppable mesh.

444
00:31:03,541 --> 00:31:11,085
Speaker 1: Well, imagine if the whole internet was that always then no one you wouldn't know would be no point of control for anybody to even Think about blocking it.

445
00:31:11,186 --> 00:31:12,975
Speaker 1: It would just always be that that's a ways out.

446
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:13,760
Speaker 0: baby steps here.

447
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:18,729
Speaker 1: Well, if you can do the thing is if you can do what you want to do Then we could just make the whole internet like that.

448
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,280
Speaker 1: Well, we would just sell those nodes at the at the Best Buy.

449
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:22,064
Speaker 0: Well, we could.

450
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:28,115
Speaker 0: we could make something like that and sell it and use those Profits to create more that you then airlift over countries like Iran.

451
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,140
Speaker 1: That's not a bad idea.

452
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:32,460
Speaker 0: The only problem with using my SPs would be so pissed.

453
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:40,558
Speaker 0: the only real problem other than that is that you'll run afoul of FCC regulations and Latency would be really high so people couldn't game with it.

454
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:47,366
Speaker 1: Well, when one thing that you would definitely do with it though is you definitely go ipv6 with the multicast You're basically making a new network.

455
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:49,995
Speaker 0: Well, you would also have the well with ad hoc.

456
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,042
Speaker 0: that becomes much more difficult You.

457
00:31:52,223 --> 00:31:57,820
Speaker 0: the more important thing is to have some sort of store and forward or store and repeat broadcast.

458
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,024
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is right.

459
00:31:59,145 --> 00:32:06,932
Speaker 1: any of these things you could load it up with like the full open source package You know, you could have a DNS cache and a and a squid frog.

460
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,919
Speaker 1: you could do the whole setup in there.

461
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:12,774
Speaker 1: So there would be like almost nothing to stop you from.

462
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:18,455
Speaker 1: you know, whatever you needed, you know Like let's say it was connect to the internet and someone got some info.

463
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:22,740
Speaker 1: but now the Internet's out But the note is still there and someone Wi-Fi is to it with their phone.

464
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,840
Speaker 1: They can still see the cache pages because you're just that awesome.

465
00:32:26,106 --> 00:32:26,230
Speaker 1: But

466
00:32:26,272 --> 00:32:43,513
Speaker 0: anyway just watch the situation and watch what's going on on the internet because this this has the potential to be a big turning point in terms of how we Get media and communicate with each other and the fact that I even saw a lot of hints of anonymous Attacking Iranian servers.

467
00:32:43,574 --> 00:32:46,448
Speaker 1: very nice Here if you want to.

468
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,560
Speaker 1: you know, I mean obviously you're not going to Iran.

469
00:32:49,761 --> 00:33:00,980
Speaker 1: So you're you know, unless you're in Iran go you Your odds of actually doing something that's really really meaningful and helpful is pretty low unless you're very rich or something, right?

470
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,160
Speaker 1: So what I think what you can to get the most out of this right?

471
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:15,895
Speaker 1: What you should do is you should watch closely and see what is done right and what is done wrong So that you can replicate it elsewhere when it is needed.

472
00:33:16,236 --> 00:33:17,400
Speaker 1: That is what you should do.

473
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,044
Speaker 0: You know what?

474
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:22,200
Speaker 0: You know what I realized, you know that picture that gets circulated periodically.

475
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,300
Speaker 0: It says I forget the exact but if all else fails vote from the rooftops and it's a picture of a sniper rifle.

476
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:31,320
Speaker 0: Yep, replace the sniper rifle with some sort of y-max device.

477
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:44,407
Speaker 0: It's a cantata But anyway things of the day.

478
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:48,420
Speaker 0: so I didn't actually know this existed and the story is fascinating.

479
00:33:48,782 --> 00:34:00,500
Speaker 0: I'll let you read the fullness of it, but Suffice it to say in the 20s Henry Ford Saw that the cost of rubber in making tires for his cars was pretty high.

480
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:18,281
Speaker 0: yep, and he decided the best way around this was to create a colony in Brazil and make a factory to mass-produce rubber from rubber plantations Mm-hmm, so he basically tried to make a little Midwestern factory in the rainforests of Brazil didn't work Did it?

481
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:21,991
Speaker 0: it failed in a catastrophic way?

482
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,775
Speaker 0: That is epic to a degree.

483
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,797
Speaker 0: That is laughable.

484
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:25,480
Speaker 1: saw that coming.

485
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:26,882
Speaker 0: There's a quote.

486
00:34:26,902 --> 00:34:28,047
Speaker 0: Let me where was the quote?

487
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:28,708
Speaker 0: bla bla bla bla.

488
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,978
Speaker 0: I mean there were riots and knife fights.

489
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,011
Speaker 1: Quote in 19 so bad you wish I know cut you some.

490
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:46,603
Speaker 0: in 1930 the native workers revolted against the managers Many of whom fled into the jungle for a few days until the Brazilian army arrived and the revolt ended Mm-hmm.

491
00:34:47,146 --> 00:34:51,638
Speaker 0: It did not go very well, but the legacy of Ford Landia lives.

492
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:54,679
Speaker 0: Okay, and there's a cool NPR thing about it, too.

493
00:34:55,842 --> 00:34:56,927
Speaker 0: I did not know about this.

494
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:57,990
Speaker 1: is it is the factory?

495
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,134
Speaker 1: did actually anything get built.

496
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,040
Speaker 0: Yes, actually this is still there.

497
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:04,091
Speaker 0: Ruins of it as far as I can tell other pictures.

498
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:05,980
Speaker 0: I found a few pictures, right?

499
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,886
Speaker 0: This is pretty neat mmm.

500
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:20,837
Speaker 0: I don't have a lot else to say other than that Henry Ford You didn't think you're clever plan through and even if it had worked They came up with synthetic rubber pretty much right away after this.

501
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:23,684
Speaker 1: yeah It's actually sort of interesting.

502
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:35,700
Speaker 1: just a quick aside is like you look at stuff like Formula One where they're very advanced tire technology and They're always trying out like new materials for the tires, you know and in different mixes of rubbers and all sorts of stuff.

503
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,263
Speaker 1: Are they basically?

504
00:35:36,545 --> 00:35:43,860
Speaker 1: you know, there's a whole lot of trial and error going on But like some of the materials they use are in such ridiculously short supplies.

505
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,360
Speaker 1: So it's like even if they find something great like they might run out and then they'll have to come with something else.

506
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:51,957
Speaker 0: It's pretty crazy, um, so what do you have for me?

507
00:35:52,198 --> 00:36:13,365
Speaker 1: so After the iPhone, you know, which is probably like the number one way to make money with a little game these days If you want to make a lot of money with a cute little game your best bet right now is probably flash Because you know, there's quite a few companies out there that all they do is make a whole bunch of flash games And they put them on the internet.

508
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:17,220
Speaker 1: They let them spread around they put ads all over them and they they're making it.

509
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,078
Speaker 1: I mean, you know desktop tower defense was making like five figures a week.

510
00:36:21,118 --> 00:36:23,131
Speaker 0: at one point I heard I played it for a while.

511
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:24,500
Speaker 0: Remember the forum was all into it.

512
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,200
Speaker 0: We played it like I would be playing it while I was doing the show and congregate.com seems to be doing all right.

513
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, there doesn't seem like they're doing too poorly.

514
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,089
Speaker 1: so flash games are definitely a way to go.

515
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:45,080
Speaker 1: the one thing about flash that is the major problem with flash is Not only are the usual problems with the plug-in and you can't search inside of a flash thing and all that business.

516
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:49,920
Speaker 1: Really do 3d which is gonna die cuz HTML 5 is coming on which is awesome.

517
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,047
Speaker 1: But I'll talk about that some other.

518
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:52,516
Speaker 0: we got to do a whole show on that.

519
00:36:52,576 --> 00:36:56,194
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually, we should do a whole show on the history of HTML.

520
00:36:56,355 --> 00:37:04,360
Speaker 1: No, so To make anything with flash you need to buy flash right and it's not like say Photoshop.

521
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,197
Speaker 1: We're like, okay sure Photoshop's a bajillion dollars, but there's the gimp, you know, it's like well this flash.

522
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,340
Speaker 1: It's a bajillion dollars.

523
00:37:11,423 --> 00:37:11,815
Speaker 1: That's it.

524
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:13,850
Speaker 1: You want to make a flash game.

525
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,533
Speaker 1: you got by this.

526
00:37:15,076 --> 00:37:18,218
Speaker 1: it's a lot of money So it's not it's not the greatest.

527
00:37:18,298 --> 00:37:24,685
Speaker 1: Well some guy he went and he He made something called flicks.

528
00:37:24,745 --> 00:37:26,570
Speaker 1: all right and what?

529
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:32,420
Speaker 1: this is a flash game engine for games That are all pixel styling, right?

530
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:37,114
Speaker 1: so if you want to make a pixel style in game you get this flicks all thing.

531
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:56,451
Speaker 1: and then you can get either Flex Builder, which is $250 or you can get flash develop which is free or you can get MX MLC, which is also free and Combined with this download of flicks all that he's got you can make a flash game Without giving any money to Adobe at all.

532
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:58,660
Speaker 1: zero without any money whatsoever.

533
00:37:59,021 --> 00:38:13,018
Speaker 1: Actually, and you still have to write, you know in the action script and I guess you have to draw your own pixel arts And all that kind of business, but you know It's a. it's a game engine for making flash games without flash and that is pretty freakin useful.

534
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:18,295
Speaker 1: and I've put a lot of great pixelated flash games like Dino run.

535
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:20,462
Speaker 0: Oh Dino run I think so.

536
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:26,524
Speaker 1: You can now make Dino run without paying any money and you can make some bank Go for it.

537
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,028
Speaker 0: the real I mean flash.

538
00:38:28,149 --> 00:38:38,170
Speaker 0: everyone uses it as a game development platform, but it's really a much more generic Development platform, which is really meant for Animations and sort of vector arts and these sorts of things.

539
00:38:38,371 --> 00:38:39,916
Speaker 0: as was noted in our interview with

540
00:38:39,936 --> 00:38:41,662
Speaker 1: video part of it is really sort Of tacked

541
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:53,560
Speaker 0: on as it was noted in our interview with Alex and Emily, you know with Muse games It's if you're without using a game platform Like it basically doubles and triples the amount of work you have to do to develop a game.

542
00:38:53,800 --> 00:39:01,220
Speaker 0: Yep, so things like this, you know an actual game development platform that itself is based on a more generic platform are the way to go.

543
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like he's actually got like a little tiny engine here a little framework for you to work with.

544
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:15,958
Speaker 1: So, you know you a lot of the the work of making a pixelated flash game is somewhat done for you And you only have to do your actual game part and then you're good to go.

545
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:23,715
Speaker 0: So tonight we're gonna talk about a topic that hopefully is not too dry But it's one that's very near and dear to my heart.

546
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:24,077
Speaker 0: everyone.

547
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:36,722
Speaker 0: Stop listening I am basically the head of our project to have a universal ticketing system in our company right now But Ticketing is a concept that is one misunderstood by almost everyone Yeah and two.

548
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:50,220
Speaker 0: I have never in my life seen it implemented in anything that I even call a close facsimile of something even Yeah on a scale of one to ten ten being perfect and zero being poop, right?

549
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,480
Speaker 1: I've never seen anything above like a five and five is some hot shit.

550
00:39:54,761 --> 00:39:58,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, some of the fives are real expensive.

551
00:39:59,403 --> 00:40:01,770
Speaker 1: So just we should talk about a ticketing system.

552
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,881
Speaker 1: right is usually used for support and help desks Right.

553
00:40:06,062 --> 00:40:11,660
Speaker 1: So it's usually like hey, there's somebody sitting at their desk who's I don't know an editor.

554
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,550
Speaker 1: They do some job at the company.

555
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,696
Speaker 1: They sit at a computer all day.

556
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:15,360
Speaker 1: Who knows right?

557
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,630
Speaker 1: They're not a technical person though, and they have a problem.

558
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:21,440
Speaker 1: Maybe their Microsoft Word won't open.

559
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,380
Speaker 1: They double click on Microsoft Word and it won't open.

560
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,190
Speaker 1: So they you know if they go and up to the IT office and say hey I got a problem with my computer.

561
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,580
Speaker 1: That's not very good.

562
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:31,125
Speaker 1: Why is that not good?

563
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:35,440
Speaker 1: because you know the IT people, you know, they need to be able to manage their time.

564
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,620
Speaker 1: They can't just get up everyone time someone, you know immediately every time someone comes over to the help desk, right?

565
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,640
Speaker 1: It's like they've got to figure out all the problems and sort of prioritize them and pick which people to help first.

566
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,180
Speaker 1: You know, maybe they can just help people by sending them an email, right?

567
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,160
Speaker 0: Well, there's more to it than that - yes even I mean a lot of people.

568
00:40:54,084 --> 00:41:02,586
Speaker 0: The way they manage that is you know Send them an email and you get all these emails in your phone calls and you queue them all up and some sort of human Driven business process.

569
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,591
Speaker 1: It's a lot of extra work.

570
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:05,520
Speaker 0: Well, then you have the problem where things get lost.

571
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,640
Speaker 0: I mean, alright, I've received two emails today.

572
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:10,580
Speaker 0: So by the end of the day, I've responded to both of them and fix their problems.

573
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:18,260
Speaker 0: But then a week later the guy from the second email emails me back saying hey It's not working again, and I've gotten ten more emails and I responded to eight.

574
00:41:18,622 --> 00:41:22,885
Speaker 0: I missed one and I didn't actually respond to the ninth guy Even though I fixed his problem.

575
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:27,140
Speaker 0: and sudden, you know things email doesn't really help you keep track of that very well at all.

576
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,380
Speaker 1: Which already has red and unread and maybe it has star or flag or something.

577
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,781
Speaker 0: That's it.

578
00:41:31,882 --> 00:41:34,391
Speaker 0: If you're using outlook you at least have all the colored flags.

579
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I live by those really.

580
00:41:37,001 --> 00:41:39,894
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just live by the automatic sort into folders bits.

581
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:41,482
Speaker 1: I don't use the colored flag I use.

582
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:45,300
Speaker 1: well, I use a kind of use the stars in Gmail though, but I don't use the multicolored stars.

583
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,688
Speaker 1: I just I stopped using those.

584
00:41:46,749 --> 00:41:48,640
Speaker 0: I started using the superstars.

585
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,948
Speaker 1: I just I went back to using the regular star.

586
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,265
Speaker 0: Anyway, you've seen I have like 30 different folders Labels.

587
00:41:55,386 --> 00:41:56,653
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use the labels a lot too.

588
00:41:56,694 --> 00:41:59,546
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Here's already the problem.

589
00:41:59,586 --> 00:42:06,440
Speaker 0: the majority of organizations that I found both small and large Seem to use just email and call that a business process.

590
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,544
Speaker 1: It's not good right.

591
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:11,417
Speaker 1: you lose in plus you want to document these things that later on you can look and see.

592
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,184
Speaker 1: how good are We at fixing things.

593
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:18,600
Speaker 1: maybe like someone had the same problem before and you want to look it up Searching your email doesn't help right?

594
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,426
Speaker 1: Maybe there's two tech support guys.

595
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:24,380
Speaker 1: me and rim rim solved the problem for one guy rims not at work today.

596
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,229
Speaker 1: Now the guy comes to me with the problem.

597
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:28,360
Speaker 1: I don't know what he did, but the problems in rims email.

598
00:42:28,801 --> 00:42:31,571
Speaker 0: Oh, you know we I solved a problem once.

599
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,360
Speaker 0: so if I have a ticketing system, you know, I categorize it.

600
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,190
Speaker 0: I say ticket number 9009 was this problem and I fixed it by doing this.

601
00:42:39,632 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 0: that is now the official solution for that problem.

602
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:52,707
Speaker 0: So when a thousand people call in with that problem for the next five years The text go blah blah blah, you know, they talk to the person on the phone they type in the description They hit a search that ticket comes up.

603
00:42:52,828 --> 00:42:55,116
Speaker 0: They see the resolution procedure that I already typed in.

604
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:56,621
Speaker 0: they say, oh, okay They click.

605
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,388
Speaker 0: this was the problem and I solved it.

606
00:42:58,588 --> 00:42:59,672
Speaker 0: They give the person the solution.

607
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:00,354
Speaker 0: They close the ticket.

608
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:01,900
Speaker 1: Yep, very easy now.

609
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:15,987
Speaker 0: so ticketing systems go much further beyond that in terms of what the real purpose is because The idea all you're basically doing is kind of serializing or providing unique Identifiers for things.

610
00:43:16,007 --> 00:43:17,833
Speaker 0: that you have done is that you can find them later.

611
00:43:18,194 --> 00:43:29,900
Speaker 0: It's basically just a relational database and The the ability to have a number a ticket number You know seven and that tracks something from the beginning to the end of a business process.

612
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:34,020
Speaker 0: That is where the real gold is and that is where most people fail miserably.

613
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:39,800
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean basically when someone's at their desk and they have a problem right you want them to submit a ticket.

614
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,356
Speaker 1: You don't do anything else, right?

615
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,587
Speaker 1: So as soon as they make that new ticket.

616
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:46,778
Speaker 1: now you have something like to attach to.

617
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:47,220
Speaker 1: you know.

618
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,539
Speaker 1: You can say, you know, it comes into the system.

619
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:53,251
Speaker 1: You'll based on its severity the right people get notified.

620
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:59,652
Speaker 1: based on the category the right people get notified, you know You can go to the web page for it or just look at it.

621
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:06,020
Speaker 1: if you're using some desktop application ticket system You know, you can read what the person wrote in there and since they're typing right?

622
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,719
Speaker 1: You don't have to sit there on the phone while they go blah blah blah blah blah.

623
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,236
Speaker 1: They've typed in their whole problem usually poorly but you know, it's something right.

624
00:44:13,557 --> 00:44:16,347
Speaker 1: you can maybe you know You can sort of figure out what the deal is.

625
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:18,837
Speaker 1: you can you know, you can assign it to someone.

626
00:44:18,878 --> 00:44:20,385
Speaker 1: you can mark It was resolved.

627
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,853
Speaker 1: You can mark it as redundant.

628
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:23,019
Speaker 1: You can close underestimate.

629
00:44:23,623 --> 00:44:24,953
Speaker 0: I mean assigning to someone.

630
00:44:24,973 --> 00:44:29,454
Speaker 0: that sounds really simple But that like to understand the savings.

631
00:44:29,474 --> 00:44:31,020
Speaker 0: there say problems are coming in.

632
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:34,680
Speaker 0: So you've got emails and somehow notifications are coming in that they're different problems.

633
00:44:35,223 --> 00:44:37,379
Speaker 0: Say you've got a team of four people who all respond.

634
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:39,286
Speaker 0: Who responds to what?

635
00:44:39,728 --> 00:44:42,460
Speaker 0: do you have to waste time telling people what you're responding to?

636
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,373
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dean in a fifth person whose job it is to pick who does what?

637
00:44:45,655 --> 00:44:46,720
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's inefficient.

638
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:47,564
Speaker 0: I mean, what do you got?

639
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:48,127
Speaker 0: four people?

640
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:51,020
Speaker 0: I see an email so I look alright and I start looking at it.

641
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,772
Speaker 0: So I can respond and say yeah, I'm working on this.

642
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:54,856
Speaker 0: Here's what I found so far.

643
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:55,620
Speaker 0: I'll follow up later.

644
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:58,199
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, someone else respond saying yeah, I'm looking at this.

645
00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:01,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, you definitely get to.

646
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:07,273
Speaker 1: you can be ability to say okay I think it comes in and you say aha rim knows about this shit.

647
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:09,158
Speaker 1: you assign it to rim.

648
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,709
Speaker 0: now It's rims responsibility a clever ticketing system.

649
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,913
Speaker 0: So you have categories.

650
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:17,202
Speaker 0: So there's a category blah blah blah NTP.

651
00:45:17,804 --> 00:45:25,588
Speaker 0: now if someone's someone takes its call and they say oh, this is an NTP problem and they say this is an NTP problem This is an automatically says.

652
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:31,576
Speaker 0: All right, the only people that know how to fix that are rim and God I'm gonna randomly assign it to either rim or God.

653
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:33,724
Speaker 1: Think of it this way, right?

654
00:45:33,784 --> 00:45:43,580
Speaker 1: Let's say your job is to fix anyone's computer problems, right worst-case scenario People are basically constantly emailing you calling you and coming up to your office with all their problems.

655
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,015
Speaker 1: That's what a ticket system solves the perfect ticket system.

656
00:45:48,236 --> 00:45:49,059
Speaker 1: What would it be like?

657
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,567
Speaker 0: It would be like right let.

658
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:58,326
Speaker 1: it would be a lot like you're playing some MMO and you go in and there's all these quests And you have to do all the quests.

659
00:45:58,346 --> 00:45:59,009
Speaker 1: That's your job.

660
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:09,588
Speaker 1: do every single quest and you can either do them yourself you can you know, maybe they're already done and it's just a suit the quest is stupid or You can say ah rim you do this quest.

661
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:13,981
Speaker 1: Ah God you do this quest and that's what a ticket system does I like.

662
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,751
Speaker 0: how you never even questioned my likening of myself unto God.

663
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:18,979
Speaker 1: Well, no, I was saying that you know.

664
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:24,120
Speaker 1: Actually, I did not interpret that as you likening yourself unto God.

665
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Speaker 0: I did in that I made a subtle linguistic equivalency and I let it stand uncontested.

666
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:37,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, I thought you just implied that you know, God was sort of hanging out there and I guess he could be knew how to fix computers.

667
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:41,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, but it gets so much more complex at this night.

668
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,398
Speaker 0: But I mean ticketing in itself is kind of like this overarching category.

669
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:57,631
Speaker 0: I mean problem management, you know Tracking these resolution of problems through a business process or through developers or whatever Bug tracking which is technically also ticketing.

670
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:00,299
Speaker 0: but that's you know, I've got a program that Scott's working on.

671
00:47:00,842 --> 00:47:02,028
Speaker 0: Yeah, identify a bug.

672
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:05,003
Speaker 0: He says alright, I will call that bug number 4008.

673
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:13,999
Speaker 1: and Tracking and ticketing systems overlap in a lot of ways and if they integrate with each other that in an intelligent way That's actually really you know.

674
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:18,255
Speaker 0: What I would say is that ticketing is the overarching category because all that is is something.

675
00:47:18,315 --> 00:47:19,640
Speaker 1: bugs are a part of ticketing.

676
00:47:20,542 --> 00:47:21,226
Speaker 1: I think there's.

677
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:29,400
Speaker 0: I think there are parts of bug tracking that do not Ticketing is is the assigning of unique identifiers to incidents of some kind.

678
00:47:29,761 --> 00:47:30,123
Speaker 1: That's it.

679
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:34,340
Speaker 0: and then be under that you have all the different kinds of tickets or incidents.

680
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,452
Speaker 0: I mean there there is problem management.

681
00:47:36,492 --> 00:47:44,227
Speaker 0: where you're you're tracking Problem resolution from an end-user standpoint or something like that Which may involve development effort.

682
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:47,340
Speaker 0: if you run into a bug in software that is bug tracking.

683
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,511
Speaker 0: Sometimes both will be under the ticketing the same ticketing system.

684
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,100
Speaker 0: Sometimes not like a good example is in my company.

685
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,759
Speaker 0: We use one product to track problems and that sort of thing.

686
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:06,000
Speaker 0: But once it gets to the point to where the production support team says we have identified the cause of the problem The customer saw it is this bug in the software.

687
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:19,000
Speaker 0: We then open a problem ticket with the developers who track this problem as a bug and their own bug tracking software Which follows a different internal business process because bug tracking is very different from problem tracking.

688
00:48:19,642 --> 00:48:24,337
Speaker 0: I mean bug tracking includes all the stuff like identified in release X tentatively fixed.

689
00:48:24,377 --> 00:48:29,699
Speaker 0: in release Y QA confirmed that release Z does not have the problem, you know that sort of thing.

690
00:48:30,321 --> 00:48:31,565
Speaker 0: These libraries are involved.

691
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:35,818
Speaker 0: these aren't stuff like that stuff that the customer doesn't give one shit about.

692
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:36,540
Speaker 1: it's all this.

693
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,305
Speaker 1: It's a lot of metadata, right?

694
00:48:38,365 --> 00:48:43,480
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, the primary data is you know, the number the identifier of the ticket.

695
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:49,820
Speaker 1: You know the text that describes what's going on and you know the status and maybe the assignee.

696
00:48:50,181 --> 00:49:01,057
Speaker 1: But every ticket system, you know, whether it's for bugs or for IT problems or something else and even at different companies there's a whole bunch of extra information as attached to every ticket.

697
00:49:01,198 --> 00:49:06,780
Speaker 1: that and You know which particular fields you need depends on who you are and what you're doing also.

698
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:17,485
Speaker 1: But that is where all the important stuff that no one gets right is, you know Every ticket system ever used always has like, you know metadata fields that are Unnecessary.

699
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:25,100
Speaker 1: or the people need a field that's not available Or they need an option for a field that's not available or I feel there's too many option.

700
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,046
Speaker 0: I'm all that up.

701
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:36,300
Speaker 0: the primary problem with almost every ticketing solution Anyone's ever come up with is that even if they they nominally work pretty well They're never semantically consistent.

702
00:49:37,161 --> 00:49:42,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're not you know, perfectly integrated with your exact business process.

703
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:48,040
Speaker 1: They're always sort of you know, if you get one off the shelf, it's for like this generic business process.

704
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:56,333
Speaker 1: You either have to adapt your process to the system or hack the system until it matches your business And a lot of people just right out the ass to get one custom-built.

705
00:49:56,353 --> 00:49:58,785
Speaker 0: a lot of people write their own system Which never really ends.

706
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:01,560
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, the problem with writing your own system right is sure.

707
00:50:02,061 --> 00:50:11,560
Speaker 1: It's very tuned for what you do, but unless you really invest a lot into it a lot of work or a lot of money You're not gonna get a lot of these basic features.

708
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,459
Speaker 1: You're gonna have to reinvent the wheel a whole bunch, you know.

709
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,638
Speaker 1: You know features that no other ticket systems off the shelf already have.

710
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:19,100
Speaker 0: yeah

711
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:25,336
Speaker 1: And you know to invest that much money and something that is not directly profit generating

712
00:50:25,517 --> 00:50:26,760
Speaker 0: never a revenue generator

713
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's something that's very difficult for any business to actually do unless it's got money to burn

714
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:35,351
Speaker 0: And you know just to get to illustrate the complexities, you know bug tracking.

715
00:50:35,773 --> 00:50:38,100
Speaker 0: What about release tracking completely separate thing?

716
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,680
Speaker 0: You know release one five eight contains all these bug fixes.

717
00:50:43,042 --> 00:50:45,900
Speaker 0: It has been signed off on by this QA person in this QA person.

718
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:50,416
Speaker 0: Now the production team has to sign off on it before we actually roll it out to customers stuff like that.

719
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:54,388
Speaker 0: What about Change management, which is a separate thing all together.

720
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:55,853
Speaker 0: What about compliance?

721
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,618
Speaker 0: What about HR processes?

722
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,320
Speaker 0: Like it gets crazy.

723
00:50:58,844 --> 00:51:03,894
Speaker 0: It's not just technology but Every day here's every ticketing system out there.

724
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:06,865
Speaker 0: It's not just that they're poorly written They're shitty.

725
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:10,060
Speaker 0: Like they're really bad and they're really really really expensive.

726
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:20,975
Speaker 0: I mean service desk Express like magic solution Which is basically remedy light Cost tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars and out of the box does jack all.

727
00:51:21,477 --> 00:51:23,483
Speaker 1: and there's a lot of open source Ones out there.

728
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:28,080
Speaker 1: They suck - OS ticket is I mean at least at least they're open source.

729
00:51:28,141 --> 00:51:34,839
Speaker 1: So if you hack at them, you can you know Theoretically get them to be what you want them to be over the course of be what you were meant to be.

730
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:42,100
Speaker 0: I installed about 30 different ticketing systems open and closed source and tried them out and of the open source ones.

731
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:46,900
Speaker 0: I can say that only three I tied I tried worked if I followed the instructions.

732
00:51:47,362 --> 00:51:50,740
Speaker 1: There's a lot of them out there that are sort of they're like web service ones, you know.

733
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,011
Speaker 1: So it's like someone hosts something and you pay them.

734
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,737
Speaker 0: I don't trust that for shit.

735
00:51:55,837 --> 00:51:59,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like base That's the 37 signals base camp, you know company.

736
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:00,654
Speaker 1: That's what they're up to.

737
00:52:00,674 --> 00:52:01,236
Speaker 1: Yeah.

738
00:52:01,256 --> 00:52:02,902
Speaker 0: Well like gyre It wasn't John.

739
00:52:02,922 --> 00:52:06,517
Speaker 0: I forget which ones which but I try era that's one I hate use.

740
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:11,629
Speaker 0: I've used Jira I'm gonna tell you right now terrible That was some crap that I tried to install.

741
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:18,034
Speaker 0: I talked I talked to the support team on the phone when I installed their demo And it just didn't work and I was like it just doesn't work.

742
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:21,639
Speaker 1: and they were like, yeah Yeah, Jira is not so great.

743
00:52:22,463 --> 00:52:28,292
Speaker 1: The other thing is that like there's a lot of features that are sort of like they should be standard But they're not right.

744
00:52:28,332 --> 00:52:32,931
Speaker 1: like for example Most people in your company right don't are never.

745
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:36,283
Speaker 1: you're never gonna be able to teach them use the ticket system ever and they don't Need to write.

746
00:52:36,644 --> 00:52:40,780
Speaker 1: all you want them to do is send an email to like help at company.

747
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:46,939
Speaker 1: You know get help a lot of ticket systems don't have the ability to read to.

748
00:52:46,979 --> 00:52:50,232
Speaker 1: you know Read from the email server and import emails as tickets.

749
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:52,080
Speaker 1: That's sort of necessary.

750
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:55,560
Speaker 1: So if you don't have that you're just disqualified right away.

751
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:59,174
Speaker 0: Do you realize how few ticketing systems have any concept of escalations?

752
00:52:59,615 --> 00:53:00,739
Speaker 0: I know right SLA?

753
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about this when you call up like a real data center, right?

754
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,800
Speaker 1: They sort of have this escalation system, right?

755
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:14,299
Speaker 1: Your problem is at this level you get so they assign you to like some low-level support guy Who's gonna take his sweet-ass time?

756
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,367
Speaker 1: Your problem is super serious.

757
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:18,057
Speaker 1: We're sending you to the knock.

758
00:53:18,077 --> 00:53:23,119
Speaker 0: You go to the Network Escalation say I want to set up to where my boss assigns me something to do.

759
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,700
Speaker 0: You know some instant and it's assigned to me and say I don't update it for a couple of days.

760
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:32,419
Speaker 0: Based on the priority of this ticket, which is defined in the system.

761
00:53:33,561 --> 00:53:36,513
Speaker 0: Say I want it to email me and remind me after three days.

762
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a normal priority ticket.

763
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:39,644
Speaker 0: Do anything.

764
00:53:40,085 --> 00:53:44,780
Speaker 0: now it emails me again and warns me that it's gonna email my manager if I don't do anything.

765
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,827
Speaker 0: Yeah And then it emails my manager.

766
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,459
Speaker 0: and if I don't do anything and my manager doesn't do anything.

767
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:53,159
Speaker 0: It emails my manager's manager with the pissed-off email.

768
00:53:54,826 --> 00:53:59,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also, you know if the if the email is like low priority Maybe it never sends an email.

769
00:54:00,222 --> 00:54:07,451
Speaker 1: But if the email is critical and you don't fix it with like in an hour It starts bothering people because they need to know.

770
00:54:07,471 --> 00:54:10,600
Speaker 1: plus, you know that way like even if I get this critical ticket.

771
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,480
Speaker 1: So I start working on it, but I'm sucking and I'm not able to fix it right away.

772
00:54:14,742 --> 00:54:21,039
Speaker 1: But I'm so concentrated on fixing it that you know No one else sort of realizes that this thing is broken because it was just assigned to me.

773
00:54:21,503 --> 00:54:23,097
Speaker 1: I got an email and I'm working on it.

774
00:54:23,982 --> 00:54:26,932
Speaker 1: After an hour or two this critical thing is still busted.

775
00:54:26,952 --> 00:54:31,977
Speaker 1: other people need to start knowing that I'm you know Failing over here to help me out because it's critical.

776
00:54:32,178 --> 00:54:37,440
Speaker 0: Oh shit Yep, but I mean to go into a lot of specifics would require a lot of shows.

777
00:54:38,222 --> 00:54:40,438
Speaker 1: We're not gonna go into super specifics on any of these.

778
00:54:40,518 --> 00:54:41,632
Speaker 0: one thing I am series, you know.

779
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:50,947
Speaker 0: I've spent a lot of my professional career working and dealing with ticketing systems at the enterprise level and The conclusions I have come to is that they all suck.

780
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:54,178
Speaker 0: They're all either expensive in time or expensive in money.

781
00:54:54,198 --> 00:55:06,280
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And I have never in any company ever Seen a ticketing system that was implemented in any good way at all like even bad ticketing systems.

782
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I figure you could get them to a workable state.

783
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:20,079
Speaker 0: I have never interacted with the ticketing system that worked and every company I have ever seen has the ticketing system that works Kinda, but all the techs kind of know the problems and work around it on their own.

784
00:55:20,682 --> 00:55:24,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, so is anyone out there ever encountered a ticketing system that worked?

785
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:32,240
Speaker 1: Well, I imagine right that the companies at which see the one thing right is off-the-shelf ticketing systems.

786
00:55:33,461 --> 00:55:42,960
Speaker 1: either a they're built to match the ticketing process at the company that made them or Be the company that made them doesn't actually use any ticketing systems at all.

787
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:49,656
Speaker 1: They're just making one for what they think, you know for maybe what the employees at that company learned from wherever they worked before You know.

788
00:55:50,201 --> 00:55:57,565
Speaker 1: So it's never gonna match your business and what you need to do is you need to come up Before you even look at the systems right.

789
00:55:58,006 --> 00:56:02,860
Speaker 1: come up with your ideal ticketing process regardless of any system that manages it.

790
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,261
Speaker 1: You know.

791
00:56:03,582 --> 00:56:10,490
Speaker 1: come up with all the things you'd like to your ticketing system to do just on paper, right and then Go and look for a system.

792
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:11,958
Speaker 1: You can find one that comes close.

793
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,990
Speaker 1: You can if you can.

794
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:15,070
Speaker 1: now

795
00:56:15,331 --> 00:56:16,194
Speaker 0: you can't you

796
00:56:16,214 --> 00:56:30,779
Speaker 1: probably can't but if you can Take it and modify it and if you can't I Think it actually is sort of worth the time and money in the long run depending on how much time and money you have You know depending on the size of your company and a lot of other things, you know to just make it.

797
00:56:31,281 --> 00:56:47,920
Speaker 1: And the thing is if you make it and it doesn't suck for your company and it actually matches your business process Then you know even though you wasted a lot of time and money making this thing a Your business helped a great deal in a long run by having the system in place and working and be.

798
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:53,040
Speaker 1: Maybe you can turn around and sell that and it won't suck and you'll make money that way.

799
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:58,591
Speaker 1: You know, I mean think about a lot of stuff these days Right a lot of the big things you see.

800
00:56:58,651 --> 00:57:00,259
Speaker 1: I mean, do you remember what was that?

801
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:11,000
Speaker 1: Flicker came out of this these people that made this game that I played it wasn't even really a game was like a chat room With the shit attached to it and forget what it was called, but it was like this weird thing.

802
00:57:11,421 --> 00:57:14,071
Speaker 1: But flicker came out of that right?

803
00:57:14,171 --> 00:57:14,874
Speaker 1: They didn't go out.

804
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,500
Speaker 1: They didn't seek out to make flicker.

805
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,587
Speaker 1: They made this other thing and flicker came from it.

806
00:57:18,948 --> 00:57:28,240
Speaker 1: Twitter came out while they were making Odeo, right same dudes You know as a whole bunch of stuff these days that mean like look they made unreal.

807
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:30,391
Speaker 1: But now unreal doesn't make the money.

808
00:57:30,432 --> 00:57:31,960
Speaker 1: the unreal engine makes the money.

809
00:57:32,161 --> 00:57:40,080
Speaker 1: You know the tools you make to do your primary business end up Becoming a primary business in and of themselves.

810
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:42,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we've seen this time and time again.

811
00:57:43,041 --> 00:57:45,128
Speaker 1: So it's very very worthwhile.

812
00:57:45,148 --> 00:57:55,340
Speaker 1: if you have a business right that is hopefully successful You should always at work on at least one business tool that you plan to turn into.

813
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,780
Speaker 1: Alright, don't plan to turn it into a product.

814
00:57:58,081 --> 00:58:08,616
Speaker 1: Just make some tool that your business needs make it in-house and make it perfect and then maybe Probably if it's good, it will become its own product.

815
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:09,500
Speaker 1: on natural

816
00:58:10,302 --> 00:58:23,100
Speaker 0: But in terms of specific ticketing systems, you know I'm sure many of you out there are listening to this because you're tasked with this or you're interacting with this in some way in a company or You're you have some young fawn out of college and you're gonna get into some business soon.

817
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,023
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to deal with this.

818
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:34,419
Speaker 0: my advice to you is one be somewhat idle compliance ITIL that in your business process because that will save you a lot of headaches.

819
00:58:34,499 --> 00:58:41,938
Speaker 0: and Basically what that means to summarize is that don't just have an urge like a priority of your tickets.

820
00:58:42,379 --> 00:58:43,262
Speaker 0: have a Priority.

821
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:50,265
Speaker 0: that itself is a matrix of the relationship between two other attributes on a ticket urgency and impact.

822
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:53,756
Speaker 0: who does this affect and how quickly does it need to be resolved?

823
00:58:54,077 --> 00:58:56,658
Speaker 0: and the priority should be a derivation of those two fields.

824
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:00,810
Speaker 0: That alone will make your business process much better.

825
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:07,064
Speaker 1: Yes Email this market high priority, right or it's like?

826
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:15,240
Speaker 1: I remember someone told the story of how from North America Had a ticket system right and the ticket system didn't have priorities at all.

827
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:18,309
Speaker 1: So they added right an urgent button.

828
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,080
Speaker 1: right now notice how Newegg has like the rush service button.

829
00:59:22,441 --> 00:59:28,720
Speaker 1: But that rush service button costs like $2 to $3, you know, they're urgent button didn't cost anything.

830
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,853
Speaker 1: You know anyone can make any ticket urgent very quickly.

831
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:33,640
Speaker 1: Every ticket was urgent every single one.

832
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:40,120
Speaker 0: Same fundamental problem with QoS if you let end users determine a QoS on a network that you don't control fully.

833
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:46,218
Speaker 0: Everyone will set the maximum possible priority for all of their packets exactly and then the QoS doesn't exist effectively.

834
00:59:46,258 --> 00:59:46,458
Speaker 1: Yep.

835
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:54,680
Speaker 1: So For priorities on the tickets, you don't want to just set like, you know Urgent critical high medium low, right?

836
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:06,200
Speaker 1: You're never gonna you know, what you want to have is you want to have like, you know something that's actually Quantifiable right not something subjective that people just you know will be full of themselves and pick critical, right?

837
01:00:06,501 --> 01:00:10,380
Speaker 1: You want to have them be like, all right, how quickly do you need this done?

838
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:11,465
Speaker 1: Or maybe you don't even pick.

839
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:13,353
Speaker 1: what will happen if this is not done.

840
01:00:13,373 --> 01:00:14,760
Speaker 0: No, maybe you set up check boxes.

841
01:00:14,843 --> 01:00:19,806
Speaker 0: for example Say you're a stock market II company and you have a bunch of check boxes on the ticket that say You check.

842
01:00:19,887 --> 01:00:25,653
Speaker 0: all the following affects a customer Affects the execution of a trade, you know, there you go.

843
01:00:25,793 --> 01:00:29,787
Speaker 0: Thanks the production system Execution of a trade.

844
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:33,900
Speaker 1: that's specific to your business and no other business and that's you know.

845
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:39,246
Speaker 1: That's really the problem is so, you know, so many of these Ticket systems suck ass.

846
01:00:39,266 --> 01:00:49,135
Speaker 0: Well, no all of them suck as so many of these ticketing systems are geared towards solving Technological problems and as opposed to solving generic business process problems.

847
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:57,460
Speaker 1: or they're so generic That they're not specific enough to handle anything smoothly or they're so specific They only handle one business and no other business in the world.

848
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:03,884
Speaker 0: The other primary problem is that while the good ticketing systems are very customizable and that's the point It's been a lot of time customized.

849
01:01:04,185 --> 01:01:07,938
Speaker 0: No, it's the fact that the customization interfaces are shit.

850
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:11,537
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh good god, you're not gonna find a user interface.

851
01:01:11,577 --> 01:01:12,120
Speaker 1: That's not shit.

852
01:01:13,481 --> 01:01:17,520
Speaker 1: What enterprise anything has a good use of your interface and getting system or otherwise?

853
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,423
Speaker 1: Oh my god, nothing But my.

854
01:01:19,704 --> 01:01:26,700
Speaker 0: my other piece of advice to you is that do not conform your business Process to a ticketing system that already exists.

855
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:38,120
Speaker 0: Yes Conform the ticketing system to your business process and if at any point you find yourself Having to change the way you do business because of the way your ticketing system handles processes change the system.

856
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:41,096
Speaker 0: Otherwise you're going down a road that does not end anywhere.

857
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:44,150
Speaker 0: you want to be Mm-hmm, and I'm really hungry.

858
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:45,136
Speaker 0: So let's just stop right there.

859
01:01:45,156 --> 01:01:45,779
