00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,248
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Thursday August 20th.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:11,910
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,157
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:15,240
Speaker 1: a bit about health care.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:31,557
Speaker 0: Let's do this warm today.

6
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:39,508
Speaker 0: We don't say that enough, but you know what it's been stupid stupid warm for the past like two weeks Like you know what is so warm.

7
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:40,432
Speaker 0: I don't even.

8
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:41,657
Speaker 0: it's just insane.

9
00:00:41,798 --> 00:00:42,240
Speaker 1: It's great.

10
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:44,732
Speaker 1: I wish it would just be this way all year round.

11
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:52,965
Speaker 0: if it was this warm in space He could have been reunited with his girlfriend But I had at work.

12
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:54,048
Speaker 1: You know we're having this ping-pong.

13
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,072
Speaker 0: It's so warm.

14
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,075
Speaker 0: I think that in space.

15
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,700
Speaker 0: It's probably like a cool 50 degrees.

16
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:05,980
Speaker 1: So we're having that ping-pong tournament at work And I was kicking all sorts of ass and I went up against someone who this guy who's a Chinese guy?

17
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:09,555
Speaker 1: No, no, just this guy this normal kind of white American dude.

18
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:10,640
Speaker 0: What's his job at the company?

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,575
Speaker 1: He's kind of senior guy okay, and he's he's a tennis player.

20
00:01:15,595 --> 00:01:16,659
Speaker 1: apparently he almost went pro.

21
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:18,909
Speaker 1: He's ping-pong for fun.

22
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:20,839
Speaker 0: So you're you're in trouble he uh?

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,478
Speaker 1: trivially dispatched of me.

24
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:26,566
Speaker 1: He did not even know.

25
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:27,770
Speaker 0: I mean I did not realize.

26
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:28,814
Speaker 0: you know I mean like.

27
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:36,457
Speaker 0: obviously they're both racquetball sports But I didn't think there was that much of a connection between you know the table tennis and the actual tennis.

28
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:43,284
Speaker 1: in terms of the skill set I mean I'm a I'm a mediocre tennis player a pretty good racquetball player and a Pretty great thing.

29
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:46,900
Speaker 0: racquetball and tennis have a lot more in common than I think tennis and ping-pong.

30
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:52,325
Speaker 1: I would actually say that ping-pong and racquetball have a little more in common because racquetball is a lot Faster than tennis.

31
00:01:52,426 --> 00:02:04,439
Speaker 0: that's true, but like I would wonder like now I kind of want to see like some Chinese ping-pong dude go up against like you know some real tennis And then maybe see like Federer and Nadal try to play some ping-pong.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,500
Speaker 1: Well now because the thing is this guy played tennis and ping-pong for most of his life.

33
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:10,758
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's not a situation of no.

34
00:02:12,403 --> 00:02:19,940
Speaker 1: But it was basically too that I play a really tricky game cuz I you know I Basically use a lot of English and that sort of thing and I tricked the person like I'll be looking at one side.

35
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,140
Speaker 0: He just hit it really hard right down the middle every time yes, and he was basically like it was so hard You couldn't possibly react.

36
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,986
Speaker 1: It was like in a movie when like I'm on that you're on the ground holding your sword up all the other guys just battering Against your sword over and over again.

37
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:33,790
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do.

38
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, I lost 21 to 8.

39
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:40,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know that's you know like when I you always see people like bowling.

40
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,480
Speaker 0: you know some people they bowl.

41
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,839
Speaker 0: They tried to like the hookshot and such.

42
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:47,080
Speaker 0: I just bowl it straight down the middle and I try to be as consistent as possible.

43
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:52,394
Speaker 0: If I can get a strike like that one time then it's technically possible.

44
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,420
Speaker 0: I could do that exact same thing every time.

45
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:58,716
Speaker 1: I got my average when I was taking bowling classes at RIT up to about 200 mm-hmm.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,420
Speaker 1: I just went straight at the middle every time and then you know what I stopped taking bowling classes.

47
00:03:03,943 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 1: My average is back down to about 43 where it belongs.

48
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:09,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean you know I'm terrible at ping-pong.

49
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:16,080
Speaker 0: But if I you know were to actually try to play ping-pong my strategy would be I was like why don't you just you know?

50
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,253
Speaker 0: I always see people playing it And I'm like why don't you just hit it like as hard as humanly possible?

51
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:22,585
Speaker 1: because if you don't have skill you'll hit it out Of bounds every time.

52
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:24,500
Speaker 0: I know you know, but that's what I would practice.

53
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,840
Speaker 0: I basically just practiced hitting it as hard as I could swing my arm.

54
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:36,035
Speaker 0: You know cuz my arm may not be strong enough to say hit a home run and basically It wasn't the speed I can hit that ping-pong ball hard enough to get it past.

55
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,848
Speaker 0: anyone like on the serve I could do it.

56
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:38,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I play that fast, too.

57
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,026
Speaker 1: He just had basically perfect technique, and he was extremely aggressive and everyone up to that point was kind of How big was this room?

58
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:47,193
Speaker 0: cuz you know and you watch professional size room cuz.

59
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:49,642
Speaker 0: no I mean like when you watch professional ping-pong People play.

60
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:54,640
Speaker 0: that's how I feel like a gymnasium, and it's like they got all this open area so they can go way back.

61
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, so when someone hits it stupid hard.

62
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:58,895
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can be way far away.

63
00:03:58,915 --> 00:03:59,577
Speaker 1: Does that get it?

64
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:00,420
Speaker 1: That's how you play.

65
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, you did.

66
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,880
Speaker 0: Did you play hit a gymnasium that big?

67
00:04:03,981 --> 00:04:04,966
Speaker 1: You see most players.

68
00:04:05,026 --> 00:04:06,473
Speaker 0: They're not like I was the ceiling.

69
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:10,932
Speaker 1: the ceiling was high enough Actually even though they can hit it so far.

70
00:04:11,012 --> 00:04:12,420
Speaker 1: They don't tend to hit it that high.

71
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:21,560
Speaker 1: The perfect shot bear doesn't like barely hit the net touches the corner Touches the net because you're allowed to touch the net just not on the serve.

72
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, but the thing basically it was like playing against Mike Tyson, so I realize you know now I'm fighting my way.

73
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mike Tyson now perfect strategy.

74
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,512
Speaker 1: I'm fighting my way through the losers bracket, and if I make it back to the top I'll have to play the same guy again.

75
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:37,511
Speaker 1: I'll have to fight this guy again I'll have to beat him twice, and I have a strategy.

76
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:41,769
Speaker 1: I've been observing him play And I scored the points I scored.

77
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:48,050
Speaker 1: I scored by being defensive and then luring him into a sense of security And then I would get Luke Morgan air hockey strategy.

78
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:52,307
Speaker 1: It worked real well because the points I scored toward the end I'd basically he'd hit it hard.

79
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,900
Speaker 1: I'd hit it back like I made a mistake.

80
00:04:55,222 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaker 1: So he's got this nice easy lob coming in But I put a sneaky backspin on it so we go to slam it and it go right into the net Uh-huh, so I have to basically hold out and play defensively until he gets tired.

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,120
Speaker 0: I predict you'll still lose, but perhaps score a slightly better margin.

82
00:05:10,422 --> 00:05:16,872
Speaker 1: I'm expecting to get second plays in this tournament, but this guy I just I don't think everyone else you've been seen in this tournament is not so good.

83
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,320
Speaker 1: the losers bracket is no concern of mine.

84
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:22,272
Speaker 0: How about the people who are still in the winners bracket?

85
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:23,559
Speaker 1: I'm not worried, okay?

86
00:05:24,501 --> 00:05:26,040
Speaker 1: You know they warned me when I went up against this guy.

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,381
Speaker 1: They're like.

88
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:30,359
Speaker 1: you know if you beat him that's gonna be like the biggest upset ever.

89
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,136
Speaker 0: Then he'd be in the losers bracket and come back and get you yeah.

90
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:39,418
Speaker 1: And I I didn't realize they were like yeah rims the dark horse he's gonna do.

91
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,345
Speaker 1: he's not Now.

92
00:05:41,405 --> 00:05:44,013
Speaker 0: so I think I'm gonna get to work from home tomorrow.

93
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:44,575
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

94
00:05:44,695 --> 00:05:47,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope the VPN It doesn't doesn't work now.

95
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:49,071
Speaker 1: What kind of VPN is it?

96
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,419
Speaker 1: Cisco VPN software with the RSA key?

97
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,247
Speaker 0: No, it's it's it's just.

98
00:05:53,408 --> 00:05:53,589
Speaker 0: you know.

99
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:59,754
Speaker 0: you open up the Cisco VPN software you click You tell what any kind of password and no it's just Cisco at VPN.

100
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:00,717
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

101
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,720
Speaker 0: It's VPN something.

102
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, but there are different clients for the Cisco VP anyway.

103
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,484
Speaker 0: anyway That's all it says on.

104
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,699
Speaker 0: it is his go VPN and all you do is type in your username and password for the.

105
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:14,040
Speaker 1: you know The network and urine and there's because I use the any connect client, which is actually a lot better.

106
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:16,473
Speaker 0: Whatever they gave me the only Mac client.

107
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:17,459
Speaker 0: They had because of my work.

108
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:24,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if it doesn't work then I might be anyway.

109
00:06:26,444 --> 00:06:26,829
Speaker 0: What else?

110
00:06:26,992 --> 00:06:27,520
Speaker 0: so oh yes?

111
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:36,901
Speaker 0: There's something I've been that's if you pay attention to front row crew calm Which you should go to and you know I know a lot of people just subscribe to us in iTunes and never go to our Website.

112
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:37,643
Speaker 1: we got a forum.

113
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:38,325
Speaker 0: Well.

114
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,993
Speaker 0: There's the forum yes, but you know people go there.

115
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:47,293
Speaker 0: people tend to go directly to the forum though And they don't go to front row crew calm our website.

116
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:52,119
Speaker 0: that has stuff on it A lot of stuff and it's gonna have a lot more stuff soon.

117
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,209
Speaker 1: We always have that thing of the day.

118
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,500
Speaker 1: you realize those are links to things on the internet.

119
00:06:56,886 --> 00:06:57,394
Speaker 1: Click on them.

120
00:06:57,536 --> 00:07:01,668
Speaker 0: yeah But anyway our website has lots of stuff And it actually now has a news column.

121
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:17,959
Speaker 0: and in that news column in the bottom left of the home page You can also look at all the old news is by clicking on the word news We're putting stuff there like you know convention schedules and all you know that sort of stuff, so I put a news there recently But it has me getting a lot of attention because I neglected to mention it on the show.

122
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:20,679
Speaker 0: So you finally remembered to mention it on the show?

123
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,768
Speaker 0: basically You know on our side of our forum.

124
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:30,443
Speaker 0: We've got this one advertisement there from project wonderful right and Since I've had it there.

125
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:32,749
Speaker 0: It's gotten us like 25 dollars.

126
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:48,370
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the most lucrative advertisement in the world and You know that geek nights itself will never have advertisements, and I don't think front recruit calm will have advertisements though other things May have advertising.

127
00:07:48,391 --> 00:07:50,180
Speaker 0: we're only promising about those two things.

128
00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:56,083
Speaker 0: So if we make another show like you know I didn't say Scott's box might have advertising one day nights.

129
00:07:56,224 --> 00:08:01,580
Speaker 0: geek candidates might have Might have advertising, but not geek nights anyway.

130
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:05,009
Speaker 0: But I figured hey this project wonderful.

131
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,840
Speaker 0: You know I want to see how ad buying works.

132
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,926
Speaker 0: You know I've got this $25.

133
00:08:08,926 --> 00:08:19,113
Speaker 0: I can just buy ads with those $25 You know and if I buy them from places that are about equivalent to us in terms of you know monies I can get a whole lot of ads.

134
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,900
Speaker 0: the thing is I need ads right they're all images.

135
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:33,044
Speaker 1: I need someone to photoshop up some images to For you know that are basically add the moral of what Scott is just rambling about is design is an ad and you'll be able To win a prize.

136
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,432
Speaker 1: that is actually pretty cool.

137
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:35,860
Speaker 0: Yes, we have a real prize.

138
00:08:36,504 --> 00:08:44,648
Speaker 0: so in if you go to the forum or There's a thread geek nights ad contest And it tells you the sizes of the ads that we need.

139
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:53,076

141
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,940
Speaker 0: and if they all suck there won't be a winner, but hopefully there'll be some good ones.

142
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:07,792
Speaker 1: They win the prize.

143
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:08,640

162
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,245
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's a good listener.

163
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,513
Speaker 0: I just want to see how this stuff works really.

164
00:10:19,835 --> 00:10:21,260
Speaker 0: that's my my curiosity.

165
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:24,210
Speaker 1: All right, so do you have any non meta to talk about?

166
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:25,174
Speaker 0: yes, okay?

167
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:26,880
Speaker 0: Non metas you want to news?

168
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,227
Speaker 1: Well, it's Thursday.

169
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,720
Speaker 1: We don't have to do anything anyway.

170
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:33,660
Speaker 0: So yeah, I want to talk about this thing that rim just told me about ten minutes ago.

171
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:35,107
Speaker 1: Did you look up the details?

172
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:40,760
Speaker 0: I looked up all the details I could find in the New York Times Basically jetblue my favorite airline.

173
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:46,460
Speaker 0: I fly in jetblue you know pretty much unless I don't have a choice And I have to fly someone else because they're just awesome.

174
00:10:47,222 --> 00:10:54,462
Speaker 0: They had a plan the and basically the promotion was all you can jet for $599.

175
00:10:54,462 --> 00:11:11,960
Speaker 0: they would sell you a ticket that would allow you to travel on unlimited domestic United States flights on jetblue airlays between September 8th and October 8th 2009. so that's and basically you know the plan was gonna end on Friday.

176
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:21,717
Speaker 0: It's sold out yesterday Wednesday two days in advance because there was Overwhelming demand and that's that's $600 covers all the domestic taxes and fees.

177
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,364
Speaker 0: That's it $599.

178
00:11:23,364 --> 00:11:26,860
Speaker 1: the thing is it's cool because Greyhound had something like that forever.

179
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,640
Speaker 1: I believe they still do where you could just basically wander around America with this kind of golden Greyhound ticket.

180
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,573
Speaker 0: I think that they should always just have on permanent.

181
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,948
Speaker 0: You know offer an annual Unlimited flight ticket.

182
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,380
Speaker 0: you know like make it six thousand dollars or something.

183
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:42,304
Speaker 1: I have a feeling.

184
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:45,400
Speaker 1: the only reason this works is because it was specifically a promotion.

185
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:48,208
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean that would be I mean notice.

186
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:51,097
Speaker 1: It wasn't November through December the holidays.

187
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:54,509
Speaker 0: I know right Yeah, but I really wonder how it works.

188
00:11:54,549 --> 00:12:00,010
Speaker 0: like you know does this mean that you can just like go to jetblue.com And pick any flight and it says zero dollars when you log?

189
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:00,814
Speaker 0: log in?

190
00:12:01,055 --> 00:12:03,486
Speaker 1: maybe on every jetblue flight They just left one seat free.

191
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:06,400
Speaker 0: They just left one, but what if two people with these unlimited passes?

192
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,671
Speaker 0: They didn't say how many unlimited passes they sold.

193
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,280
Speaker 0: all they said is they sold out on Wednesday.

194
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,123
Speaker 1: Maybe only one.

195
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:11,846
Speaker 1: maybe it's a lie.

196
00:12:11,886 --> 00:12:12,248
Speaker 1: We don't know.

197
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,693
Speaker 0: yeah, it could be that there was.

198
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,400
Speaker 0: they said it was overwhelming demand though.

199
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,211
Speaker 1: So they said they had one and two people tried to buy.

200
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:25,080
Speaker 0: the thing is like if I was either a on Vacation right I had a month of vacation or B. I was a business traveler.

201
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:28,078
Speaker 0: I would scoop these up so ludicrously fast.

202
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:35,540
Speaker 0: in fact I wouldn't be surprised if these are picked up by companies for the employees right, but it's only for one month.

203
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,143
Speaker 1: What are the odds?

204
00:12:36,203 --> 00:12:39,178
Speaker 1: you have that much business traveling in places jetblue goes to?

205
00:12:39,198 --> 00:12:39,338
Speaker 1: well?

206
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,826
Speaker 0: No, but think about this kind of situation.

207
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:42,087
Speaker 0: right?

208
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:46,705
Speaker 0: let's say you've got like a bunch of employees right and they're all gonna Go on.

209
00:12:46,745 --> 00:12:48,439
Speaker 0: you know you got five different guys.

210
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,546
Speaker 0: You know they're all executives.

211
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,343
Speaker 0: actually there's be flying to different place One.

212
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:55,840
Speaker 1: jetblue doesn't go to that many places and blue goes to a lot of places.

213
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not that anywhere in the United States places.

214
00:12:58,675 --> 00:12:59,519
Speaker 0: They go all pretty much.

215
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't go to a lot of places in the Midwest.

216
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:03,116
Speaker 1: I wouldn't need to go to like where?

217
00:13:03,296 --> 00:13:06,380
Speaker 0: well Detroit I'm pretty sure they go close enough to Detroit.

218
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,778
Speaker 1: They didn't go anywhere near Detroit when I wanted to fly there.

219
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:09,567
Speaker 0: well That was way.

220
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:10,398
Speaker 0: go look at the website.

221
00:13:10,438 --> 00:13:12,086
Speaker 0: now They add places like all the frickin time.

222
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:16,624
Speaker 1: now when I wanted to I had to go down to Columbia and near DC and Jetblue.

223
00:13:16,664 --> 00:13:18,793
Speaker 0: calm and tell me what you see right now.

224
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:19,777
Speaker 1: You don't waste all that time.

225
00:13:19,797 --> 00:13:20,420
Speaker 1: all right you can go.

226
00:13:20,824 --> 00:13:21,979
Speaker 0: Still you know they go to Florida.

227
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:24,265
Speaker 1: There's not that much.

228
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:28,400
Speaker 1: business traveling is way down and two business travelers like to you know first class.

229
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,666
Speaker 1: There's no first class on jetblue.

230
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,660
Speaker 0: That's that's why jetblue is so awesome because there is no classes.

231
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,000
Speaker 0: It's just one class the whole plane.

232
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,451
Speaker 0: You can pay a little bit more if you want to sit in the like.

233
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:45,080
Speaker 0: you know the emergency exit rows Because then you have more legroom you know and they every seat has a little TV in it.

234
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,618
Speaker 0: that's totally free and has like a whole bunch of shit to watch.

235
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:50,610
Speaker 0: and You know they don't bother giving you.

236
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,240
Speaker 0: it's like they realize who wants shitty airline food.

237
00:13:53,521 --> 00:13:58,520
Speaker 0: They just give you a nice little snack animal crackers a little you know biscotti something something Scott.

238
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,866
Speaker 1: They still don't go to Detroit.

239
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:01,392
Speaker 0: Where do they go anymore?

240
00:14:01,412 --> 00:14:03,140
Speaker 0: They go close to Detroit nothing.

241
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,886
Speaker 0: There's got to be something I guess.

242
00:14:04,946 --> 00:14:07,654
Speaker 1: Chicago, but that's still quite a drive from Detroit.

243
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:09,099
Speaker 0: who Detroit's a shithole now?

244
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,305
Speaker 0: anyway They don't want to go there Wants to go to Detroit.

245
00:14:12,345 --> 00:14:14,773
Speaker 0: where where else do they not go besides Detroit?

246
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:15,255
Speaker 1: everywhere?

247
00:14:15,275 --> 00:14:15,717
Speaker 1: that isn't on.

248
00:14:15,737 --> 00:14:19,026
Speaker 0: this fairly short list List is pretty long.

249
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:22,460
Speaker 0: What major place do they not go Detroit besides, Detroit?

250
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:25,411
Speaker 0: Everywhere, but Detroit is a lot of places.

251
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:26,839
Speaker 0: There's 50 freaking states.

252
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:30,650
Speaker 0: Most of them have major cities in them so far.

253
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:31,654
Speaker 0: You're only your complaint.

254
00:14:31,735 --> 00:14:33,040
Speaker 0: Is that jetblue?

255
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,005
Speaker 0: Yes, I go to a lot of places because they don't go to one dying city So in the Midwest.

256
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:44,879
Speaker 0: so I have to sit here and parse out this whole list for you and point out I thought it was a short list, but now it's a big list that is difficult to pass.

257
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,308
Speaker 1: This is four times like 15, and that's it.

258
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,512
Speaker 0: That's a lot of places.

259
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,639
Speaker 0: the United States is only 50 states.

260
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,583
Speaker 0: We you know.

261
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,893
Speaker 1: it appears that they don't go anywhere in Ohio.

262
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:55,460
Speaker 0: who wants to go to Ohio?

263
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:57,615
Speaker 1: I have reasons to go to Ohio and I can.

264
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,505
Speaker 0: oh I don't know why you're going to Ohio.

265
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:04,688
Speaker 0: they go to the good places that people want to go as the as a jetblue is All about is they're just like me.

266
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,076
Speaker 0: they say oh, that's a shitty place.

267
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:06,840
Speaker 0: who wants to go there?

268
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,087
Speaker 0: They only go to the good places.

269
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:10,300
Speaker 0: That's why they don't give you the shitty airline food.

270
00:15:10,642 --> 00:15:13,700
Speaker 0: So you know it's just the good parts without the bad parts all right?

271
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:20,174
Speaker 1: Oh, and when I had to fly to Washington while they do fly there I couldn't use jetblue because they had no flights that went at any reasonable time.

272
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:24,490
Speaker 1: for one of my business traveling was No, you know whatever because they don't have that many flights.

273
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:26,236
Speaker 0: They got enough flights.

274
00:15:26,397 --> 00:15:26,638
Speaker 1: Well.

275
00:15:26,658 --> 00:15:29,313
Speaker 1: They don't go I don't go to they don't go to places.

276
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:29,957
Speaker 1: I've wanted to go.

277
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,330
Speaker 0: and Second place that you know hi.

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,194
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, how did it go?

279
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:33,415
Speaker 0: Yeah?

280
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,219
Speaker 1: I got relatives there.

281
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:39,884
Speaker 0: I do I tell you okay It's a shit hole.

282
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:40,667
Speaker 0: no one's to go there.

283
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,918
Speaker 0: Just like Detroit all your relatives live in shitholes.

284
00:15:42,938 --> 00:15:45,907
Speaker 0: what you're saying Anyway, let's let's continue.

285
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:46,811
Speaker 0: you got anything over there.

286
00:15:47,173 --> 00:15:47,574
Speaker 1: All right.

287
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,000
Speaker 1: I don't you're such a jetblue fanboy.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,767
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird plus I'll admit having flown continental.

289
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:56,655
Speaker 1: while it's more expensive the planes are much nicer much more comfortable good God not even close.

290
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:57,462
Speaker 1: well They are.

291
00:15:57,542 --> 00:16:01,319
Speaker 0: I've been in a bunch of different airlines and jetblue is more comfortable times a whole bunch.

292
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:02,406
Speaker 1: well I disagree.

293
00:16:02,426 --> 00:16:03,595
Speaker 1: have you flown on one of the newer 757s?

294
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:08,860
Speaker 0: Who wants to be on a very in 757 to be an airbus European quality?

295
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,084
Speaker 1: Busted old Airbus?

296
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,509
Speaker 0: no it's not busted old.

297
00:16:12,549 --> 00:16:13,853
Speaker 1: those are all like a three.

298
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:14,415
Speaker 1: well like an a320.

299
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:20,640
Speaker 0: That's kind of an old plane No, but there yes the a320 is a model that has been around for a while.

300
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,897
Speaker 0: But all of jetblue's a 320s are manufactured very recent not that recently in fact.

301
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,263
Speaker 1: I'll point out It's got a camera.

302
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:27,046
Speaker 0: isn't that old?

303
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,170
Speaker 0: they're less than 10 years old.

304
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:28,572
Speaker 1: I'll find out.

305
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,907
Speaker 1: continental by far has the youngest fleet This information from?

306
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:33,974
Speaker 0: I did.

307
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:34,598
Speaker 1: you can go look it up.

308
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,760
Speaker 0: So you just you can go look it up, but you you where did you look it up that you saw this continental?

309
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,135
Speaker 0: Oh, so you believe what they say about themselves.

310
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:47,240
Speaker 1: well the thing is Scott You can't say something like that in your advertising as a fact and get away with it if you're wrong.

311
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:49,628
Speaker 1: Yeah, and considering that most of the flights.

312
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:54,824
Speaker 1: I was looking at are all like 757s, which are pretty new plane I'm willing to believe them.

313
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:59,280
Speaker 0: no yeah, I have no interest in these shitty other airlines.

314
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:02,060
Speaker 0: Okay, you're like a separate with their separate classes.

315
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:07,240
Speaker 1: Understand how much of a fanboy Scott is about jetblue, and they idea all these other airlines.

316
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,309
Speaker 0: They have super connections jetblue direct flight.

317
00:17:09,691 --> 00:17:11,720
Speaker 1: You know other airlines have direct flights.

318
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:13,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, jetblue's only dirt.

319
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:15,157
Speaker 1: no jetblue has connections.

320
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:16,323
Speaker 1: in fine You can connect.

321
00:17:16,364 --> 00:17:21,584
Speaker 1: if it was a lot cheaper to fly to Seattle through jetblue if we took those connections Yeah, that's cuz.

322
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:24,134
Speaker 0: you're actually buying two cheap tickets instead of the one nice.

323
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:24,494
Speaker 1: That's all.

324
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:29,798
Speaker 1: the connection is yeah Didn't you just say jetblue doesn't have connection?

325
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:31,265
Speaker 0: well They don't you know did they?

326
00:17:31,606 --> 00:17:34,859
Speaker 0: a connection is always possible, but I mean you know they offer them.

327
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:38,420
Speaker 1: in fact That was the number one recommendation when I put in our plan to go to Seattle.

328
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,163
Speaker 0: They were like you can go.

329
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,428
Speaker 0: take the connection if you want to.

330
00:17:40,448 --> 00:17:41,252
Speaker 0: I'm going Scott.

331
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:44,525
Speaker 1: your assertion that jetblue does not have connections Was patently false.

332
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:45,810
Speaker 0: other airlines, though.

333
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,136
Speaker 0: It'll be like you want to get from here to here.

334
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,160
Speaker 0: You got to do a connection.

335
00:17:48,203 --> 00:17:49,484
Speaker 1: No In fact blue this play.

336
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:49,625
Speaker 0: in

337
00:17:49,765 --> 00:18:02,839
Speaker 1: fact when I went to continental to check the first thing they offered me was a direct flight and the Only reason I didn't fly continental was that the flight that was the cheapest was at these like two hours later than the jetblue Flight which was a little bit worse because we're gonna go there Thursday night.

338
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,748
Speaker 1: Anyway, I would rather have flown continental.

339
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:06,713
Speaker 0: jetblue is the wind.

340
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,360
Speaker 0: you can go on your shitty continental flights.

341
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,570
Speaker 0: Which is that first of all right.

342
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,840
Speaker 0: second the continental flights?

343
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,628
Speaker 0: Oh, you know talking about jetblue doesn't go anywhere.

344
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:15,334
Speaker 0: continental goes from fucking Newark.

345
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,080
Speaker 0: right jetblue at least goes to J.

346
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,807
Speaker 1: I don't know if I like playing.

347
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:24,800
Speaker 1: you realize if I fly continental I connect out of Stewart Which is right next to our house, so I go through the shitty Stewart Airport.

348
00:18:25,482 --> 00:18:26,946
Speaker 0: Far more convenient Stewart.

349
00:18:26,966 --> 00:18:29,012
Speaker 0: I had to drive to and park there Scott.

350
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:31,580
Speaker 1: There's a free shuttle from the train station.

351
00:18:32,064 --> 00:18:32,225
Speaker 0: I was.

352
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:33,900
Speaker 0: I gotta go take go to the train station.

353
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,744
Speaker 0: I can park there.

354
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,914
Speaker 1: you take the shuttle I can walk to the train stage.

355
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,823
Speaker 0: you're gonna walk all the way to the train Station for me.

356
00:18:38,843 --> 00:18:39,868
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like right there.

357
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:41,375
Speaker 1: I did that the last time I flew out of Stewart.

358
00:18:41,677 --> 00:18:42,380
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

359
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,076
Speaker 0: All right, I could take a train right at the JFK.

360
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:45,580
Speaker 0: No problem

361
00:18:46,722 --> 00:19:01,648
Speaker 1: Plus Scott flying from Stewart to the city Connecting to new to Newark or LaGuardia or whatever doesn't matter even which airline I'm pretty much always going to from now on after this PAX thing fly out of Stewart even if I just connect a JFK Cuz I don't have to go through any security.

362
00:19:01,688 --> 00:19:03,800
Speaker 1: really there's like this tiny line at Stewart.

363
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:08,036
Speaker 1: It's a nice tiny little airport and when I fly in I'm already behind security.

364
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:08,899
Speaker 0: No, that's all you.

365
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,169
Speaker 0: Anyway enough of it shows.

366
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,700
Speaker 0: not we're taking too much time in this airport.

367
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:16,500
Speaker 1: I was gonna go right past it, but Scott just had to get all fanboy about jetblue.

368
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,725
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's not my fault.

369
00:19:17,745 --> 00:19:19,753
Speaker 0: You're you don't have you don't know how to fly.

370
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:21,620
Speaker 1: yeah, so how am I gonna get to Ohio?

371
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:26,412
Speaker 0: In your car or don't go because it's not a place for people to get?

372
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:27,415
Speaker 0: very it's not habitable.

373
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:50,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, great anyway, so Considering what we're gonna be talking about for the rest of this show if Scott doesn't if Scott can let go of the jetblue thing Interesting the life expectancy in the US has reached an all-time high of 77.9 years, it's pretty old Except that it puts us at about 50th in nations.

374
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:52,105
Speaker 0: So who's number one?

375
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:53,450
Speaker 1: I didn't even look at the list.

376
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,574
Speaker 1: We're pretty far down.

377
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,120
Speaker 1: Albania beats us significantly.

378
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,325
Speaker 1: I think Japan is number one.

379
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,152
Speaker 1: to be honest that makes the life expectancy.

380
00:19:59,192 --> 00:19:59,634
Speaker 1: There's like 83.

381
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:12,973
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jeff You know there's always that stereotypical really old Japanese verse, but here's the thing this what's interesting and incredibly Sad, but at the same time anyone who didn't see this coming has been living under a rock.

382
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,360
Speaker 1: so most likely it is not.

383
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,711
Speaker 1: It's not that we're rising.

384
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:17,840
Speaker 1: You know this is the all-time high.

385
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:26,131
Speaker 1: It's the all-time high because we've peaked and it's dropping from this point forward and sadly enough it's actually dropping pretty rapidly.

386
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:37,751
Speaker 1: in certain areas of America and unlike most other industrialized nations the gap between people who live very long and people who don't live so long is Widening at a somewhat horrifying pace

387
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:41,627
Speaker 0: just like the gap between people with a lot of money And it's based on much money

388
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:43,497
Speaker 1: almost entirely in geography.

389
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:46,947
Speaker 1: apparently The life expectancy is dropping.

390
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:51,700
Speaker 1: is dropping or stagnating in rural areas and rising in urban areas.

391
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,100
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's rising in places where people have money and going down in place of people.

392
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,717
Speaker 1: but pretty much what it comes down to.

393
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:06,423
Speaker 1: Every cause of death that is causing the life expectancy to drop in the u.s.. Boils down to smoking Obesity mm-hmm.

394
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:06,845
Speaker 1: That's it.

395
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,031
Speaker 1: That's it everyone.

396
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:11,499
Speaker 1: everything that is causing life expectancy to drop in the u.s.

397
00:21:12,181 --> 00:21:15,873
Speaker 1: Is related to obesity and it's all these diseases caused by obesity.

398
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:18,120
Speaker 1: It's type 2 diabetes is high blood pressure.

399
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:23,160
Speaker 0: Actually, I heard a lot of stuff recently about like hospital infections like causing a whole bunch of deaths.

400
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:23,884
Speaker 0: Is that on a list?

401
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:25,050
Speaker 1: They're not even close.

402
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,779
Speaker 1: It's pretty much obesity and smoking.

403
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:33,800
Speaker 0: Well, I guess yeah Oh, I guess you know I guess the things that I heard were about the hospital infections were cause of death.

404
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:41,792
Speaker 0: But I guess you know in terms cause of death is different than overall decrease in life expectancy Yep, and pretty much it basically the cause.

405
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,280
Speaker 1: life expectancy in the u.s.

406
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,700
Speaker 1: Is dropping among poor people primarily in or in rural areas?

407
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:55,968
Speaker 1: primarily in the south along the Mississippi and in the southern Midwest and in Appalachia Mm-hmm, and it's rising everywhere else.

408
00:21:56,469 --> 00:22:13,279
Speaker 1: and the scary thing is if you look at the maps that kind of break down Where it's rising and where it's falling and you look at the last point like from the 60s to the 80s and from the 80s It was going up almost everywhere until the late 80s and then it started dropping in all the places where there are fat people.

409
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,245
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Well, what happened around?

410
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:16,405
Speaker 0: then?

411
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:17,248
Speaker 0: they made that happen.

412
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:18,571
Speaker 1: people started getting fat.

413
00:22:18,993 --> 00:22:20,357
Speaker 0: Why did they get fat then?

414
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:24,120
Speaker 0: I don't know What was it that you know, I mean maybe corn.

415
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,027
Speaker 0: Why didn't people get fat in the 70s?

416
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:38,209
Speaker 1: but the scary that I mean, it's basically the fact that the life expectancy is dropping primarily because of Emanently treatable and preventable things like Obesity being fat and smoking.

417
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,980
Speaker 1: Yep, and then otherwise our health care is great.

418
00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:50,318
Speaker 1: So if you live in cities and you're not fat your life expectancy is probably in the top of the world in America But the average is brought down so much.

419
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:54,479
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't like the good the cities of America compared to the world.

420
00:22:55,142 --> 00:23:00,981
Speaker 1: If you break if you basically break down the people who do well in America versus the people who do poorly like the top and the bottom.

421
00:23:01,603 --> 00:23:08,612
Speaker 1: the top of America is in like the top five or six and the bottom of America is Not too far off from the third world.

422
00:23:08,873 --> 00:23:09,959
Speaker 0: how it is like the top?

423
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:14,580
Speaker 0: No, no, what if you did the same thing for like, you know, Japan, you know, are there places in Japan?

424
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:20,853
Speaker 1: we're taught, you know, and then like, you know the disparity between high and low is Greater in America than it is and almost anywhere else.

425
00:23:20,893 --> 00:23:22,140
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell from these stuff

426
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,420
Speaker 0: I'm in America is bigger than a lot of other places pretty much like the US

427
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:26,246
Speaker 1: Russia

428
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:34,640
Speaker 0: Russia Canada and China Much the only place Australia kind of are the only places that are really big enough to have a geographical disparity.

429
00:23:35,204 --> 00:23:49,240
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, but it's interesting that apparently Argentina up until the 80s It looks like people who had the longest life Expectancies tended to be the people in rural areas and that is rapidly changing again primarily due to obesity and smoking.

430
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:52,339
Speaker 0: Well, cuz cities used to be dangerous places, you know.

431
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:56,416
Speaker 1: Well pollution is down in cities a crime is down and all that sort of stuff.

432
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:57,360
Speaker 1: the studies are fat.

433
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,380
Speaker 1: I suggest that you read the study and check out all these graphs.

434
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,789
Speaker 0: You keep it in your bed all the time.

435
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,304
Speaker 1: Well my beds there and whatever I talk I need to gesticulate.

436
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,488
Speaker 0: you need to hit something though.

437
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,340
Speaker 0: You could just gesticulate in the air like an Italian person.

438
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,680
Speaker 1: Anyway, I like to pound on tables.

439
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:19,649
Speaker 1: Yeah One of the biggest things when I get that much founding is to have a table or four burning wheels Specifically a table that is designed to.

440
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:22,440
Speaker 1: if you pound on it, it will not shake but it will resonate.

441
00:24:22,902 --> 00:24:24,250
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, you're gonna go to get it.

442
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,920
Speaker 0: go to the carpenter and get this table made.

443
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,909
Speaker 1: I should make it hollow so that you hear this like booming pound every time someone pounds on it in my break Maybe inside the hollowness.

444
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,220
Speaker 1: I will have a microphone hooked up to an amplifier.

445
00:24:35,661 --> 00:24:38,354
Speaker 0: Anyway, you have a hole cut in the bottom and then put some strings across it.

446
00:24:38,374 --> 00:24:41,725
Speaker 0: So your table will be guitar Guitar table guitar table.

447
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I should make that.

448
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:50,280
Speaker 0: that'd be on the Internet's so fast I gotta do is make a hollow table cut a hole in it and put some strings across it and then I got a guitar.

449
00:24:57,364 --> 00:24:59,040
Speaker 1: So anyway things of the day.

450
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:00,343
Speaker 0: To what?

451
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:01,707
Speaker 0: one thing I want to say.

452
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:05,220
Speaker 0: Yes a better idea than a guitar table a harp table.

453
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:07,152
Speaker 1: How about just a harp?

454
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,218
Speaker 0: No, it's turn the harp on the side and then put a piece of glass over it.

455
00:25:11,621 --> 00:25:13,393
Speaker 1: But then how is that gonna help?

456
00:25:13,474 --> 00:25:15,099
Speaker 0: I mean play it from the bottom All right.

457
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,760
Speaker 0: But or you take the piece of glass off when you want to play and you realize the glass on when you want it.

458
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,620
Speaker 1: Awesome tape harps aren't enclosed by default.

459
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:22,203
Speaker 0: I know.

460
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:26,390
Speaker 0: you only put the glass there when you want to use the harp as a table and then you take the glass off to play it.

461
00:25:27,342 --> 00:25:32,519
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, as I was about to say before we get to sidetracked with unrelated BS.

462
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,413
Speaker 1: It's time for things of the day now.

463
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:47,149
Speaker 1: a long time ago Scott and I started using the word Randy as in James Randy whenever we were referring to bullshit, you know a Chiropractic or homeopathy or any of that BS.

464
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:54,619
Speaker 0: We call it Randy bullshit partly in honor of the fact That you know British people use the word Randy in a completely different way.

465
00:25:55,868 --> 00:26:07,932
Speaker 1: That is true but anyway you know we use it partly in honor of James Randy's noble fight against all this BS and We needed a word to encapsulate that and it served very well And I've caught a lot of listeners and people who we know using it.

466
00:26:07,992 --> 00:26:13,250
Speaker 1: It's entered kind of the front row crew lexicon and Just recently not that long ago.

467
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:33,259
Speaker 1: I started using another term After a certain YouTube video that is kind of my thing of the day where that one member of Congress basically punked that girl who called Obama a Nazi and It reminded me and reminded Scott of way back when Bill Clinton was giving a talk and someone was like blah blah blah And I love it was conspiracy and Bill Clinton basically was like shut the fuck up.

468
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:34,779
Speaker 0: That was a good one.

469
00:26:35,082 --> 00:26:47,350
Speaker 1: And then I thought all the way back to when Buzz Aldrin was confronted with a guy who accused him of being a coward for lying about the fact that he went to The moon and Buzz Aldrin looks at him and punches him in the face.

470
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:55,174
Speaker 1: Oh I never agree with using violence to react to words.

471
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,292
Speaker 1: I Basically would not have no court would have convicted Buzz Aldrin for punching this guy.

472
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:02,536
Speaker 0: No court did.

473
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:07,860
Speaker 1: he's a free man And I realized that that is what I want out of politics.

474
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,334
Speaker 1: I want more people to be like Barney or to be like Bill Clinton.

475
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:19,460
Speaker 1: when someone is stupid Don't be political don't you know him and Han be like, oh, well, you know you believe that but I believe this and blah blah blah.

476
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:30,800
Speaker 1: I want politicians to just pull a Buzz Aldrin and either physically or Verbally punch them in the face and the verb I'm going to use for this henceforth is Buzz Aldrin.

477
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,041
Speaker 1: See,

478
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:45,453
Speaker 0: I think the problem here is that unlike Randy you're trying to do this intentionally as opposed to by accident Which means if the chances of success of this catching on are low and also Buzz Aldrin ing is not as catchy as buzzing or Aldrin ing

479
00:27:45,573 --> 00:27:46,617
Speaker 1: while not catching it

480
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:47,400
Speaker 0: up on their own.

481
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:48,644
Speaker 0: So it's gonna be.

482
00:27:48,744 --> 00:27:57,840
Speaker 1: I've already had this discussion and I realized that having the full term Buzz Aldrin ing Has I think the diction of it and the rhythm it means it's not gonna happen.

483
00:27:58,008 --> 00:28:04,003
Speaker 1: No and the fact that it's so long adds this sort of inherent comedic timing and That seemed.

484
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:06,956
Speaker 1: I think that is what's going to make it succeed more so than anything else.

485
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:07,760
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna fail.

486
00:28:08,242 --> 00:28:09,084
Speaker 1: I think it's going to succeed.

487
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:13,660
Speaker 1: In fact, I used it in another thread and one other person has already used it.

488
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:15,593
Speaker 1: I think it is going to catch on.

489
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:16,539
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna catch on.

490
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:30,620
Speaker 1: I've defined Buzz Aldrin ing as and I quote - upon reaching the conclusion that the person with whom you are debating is incapable of rational discourse issue further discussion in favor of either public ridicule or hilarious violence.

491
00:28:31,621 --> 00:28:32,082
Speaker 0: That's good.

492
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:33,025
Speaker 0: I like that.

493
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,750
Speaker 0: There's a good that your definitions perfect.

494
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,177
Speaker 1: I think the definition and everything together.

495
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,320
Speaker 1: It's gonna happen.

496
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:40,920
Speaker 1: At least it will be as widespread.

497
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:45,177
Speaker 0: I'm not joining the club until it spreads on its own because I don't want to skew the.

498
00:28:45,518 --> 00:28:48,088
Speaker 1: that's fine But I'm going to use it as much as possible.

499
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:49,553
Speaker 1: thing is to don't.

500
00:28:49,573 --> 00:28:50,216
Speaker 0: the thing is you.

501
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:54,348
Speaker 0: I think I have a feeling knowing You you're going to artificially overuse it.

502
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,871
Speaker 1: I'm lucky though.

503
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:59,803
Speaker 1: It can't be overused because it's so rare Uh-huh.

504
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:02,837
Speaker 1: No one Buzz Aldrin's anyone anymore except Buzz Aldrin.

505
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:03,520
Speaker 0: That's true.

506
00:29:04,403 --> 00:29:07,354
Speaker 1: I mean what I. I couldn't find that many videos.

507
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:10,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I guess you could Blagojevich instead.

508
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,140
Speaker 0: So your thing of the day is videos of people Buzz Aldrin ing people.

509
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:25,995
Speaker 1: I think of the day is the forum post where I coined the Buzz Aldrin phrase and it is the video of Barney Frank Bill Clinton self-aggrandizing thing of the day and Buzz Aldrin.

510
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:29,322
Speaker 1: Buzz Aldrin ing All right.

511
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:35,399
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day, I know people who are geeks don't pay attention to the sports like we do.

512
00:29:36,343 --> 00:29:37,508
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm talking about bolt.

513
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,411
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

514
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:38,672
Speaker 0: Good.

515
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:39,636
Speaker 0: How could you not?

516
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,345
Speaker 0: Good God There is a man from Jamaica.

517
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,412
Speaker 0: He's really tall taller than us.

518
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,235
Speaker 0: He's fast.

519
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,660
Speaker 0: His name is Usain Bolt.

520
00:29:47,325 --> 00:29:57,384
Speaker 1: I don't know if he did any drugs or not Scott I'll say this never in the history of man has there been a more clear-cut case of nominative determinism than mr Bolt.

521
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:10,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Usain Bolt, you know, there is no evidence that he is, you know partaking in any You know performance enhancing substances or anything of the sort, although it's not you know impossible.

522
00:30:11,261 --> 00:30:19,396
Speaker 0: Whether he has or he hasn't the fact of the matter is Usain Bolt is the fastest human being to have ever existed in the history of human beings.

523
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:27,052
Speaker 1: as long as we have been Measuring the speed of human beings not just by a little bit It's not like he's breaking these records by like a hundredth of a second.

524
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,176
Speaker 1: you watch the video.

525
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:29,160
Speaker 1: He's just gone.

526
00:30:30,241 --> 00:30:31,043
Speaker 0: Look at these videos.

527
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,949
Speaker 0: This is actually what's going on right now.

528
00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:35,937
Speaker 0: is the the world championship in athletics, right?

529
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:46,337
Speaker 0: It's in Berlin And he broke the world record for the hundred meter - Nine, he ran it in nine set nine point five eight seconds.

530
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,262
Speaker 1: So think about.

531
00:30:47,282 --> 00:30:48,489
Speaker 0: think about a hundred meters.

532
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,706
Speaker 0: now think about you know Get a stopwatch and do nine point.

533
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:54,359
Speaker 0: you could watch the videos as high-res videos on YouTube.

534
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,981
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to them.

535
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:56,645
Speaker 0: He did the 200 meters.

536
00:30:56,685 --> 00:31:06,190
Speaker 0: I think it was today or very, you know, maybe yesterday 1919 200 meters Right, so that's a nine point.

537
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,684
Speaker 0: five eight times two is Yeah, okay.

538
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:18,566
Speaker 0: You can see that he's pretty much around in the same speed about on both of these He's up against.

539
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:19,672
Speaker 0: basically you look at them.

540
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:30,579
Speaker 0: line up for these races, right those are the fastest human beings that currently live all of them just lined up there and he's like Multiple strides ahead of everyone else.

541
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:35,223
Speaker 0: It's insane and like Tyson Gaye from the United States He's out there.

542
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:42,008
Speaker 0: if Usain Bolt wasn't out there Tyson Gaye would be like breaking the world record and stuff You know, it's like he looks slow next to bolt.

543
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:54,286
Speaker 0: But if you compare it like Tyson Gaye to the all of history He's like, you know crazy fast like winning awesome fast, but Usain Bolt is out there Looks like he's cheating but he's not.

544
00:31:54,306 --> 00:32:01,047
Speaker 0: he's just the fastest person to ever to ever be and it's you have to watch this Just because holy shit.

545
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,994
Speaker 0: and well actually this is one article.

546
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:03,957
Speaker 0: That was really interesting.

547
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:11,978
Speaker 0: that showed a Graph of the world record in the hundred meter dash over time, you know by year and it showed like.

548
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:17,600
Speaker 0: he's like, okay If we do a graph, you know, and then we what equation matches, you know this data plot, right?

549
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,377
Speaker 0: Usain Bolt was a crazy outlier like he's.

550
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:32,879
Speaker 0: if We continue, you know there should be a. first of all you assume that there's some limit to human speed that if you follow that graph the limit is somewhere around like nine point two right for the hundred meters.

551
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:39,617
Speaker 0: and If you look at like, okay, you know Usain Bolt just did a nine five eight and you look at the graph.

552
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:40,440
Speaker 0: according to the graph.

553
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:45,140
Speaker 0: Nobody should be doing a nine five eight for like another like ten or twenty years.

554
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:57,505
Speaker 0: Well, if not ever yeah, because the fact that there are limits to what a human body can do Right, but we're assuming that the limits, you know, we're assuming that the limit is on this graph as opposed to you know Some other right.

555
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,180
Speaker 0: well mathematically speaking we were talking about this.

556
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,000
Speaker 0: No one's gonna be breaking these records for decades.

557
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:10,879
Speaker 1: The only person at work who seemed to know about this at all was the French guy who was like, hey Bolt and I'm like, yeah, everyone's like, oh, yeah, but no one else knew.

558
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:16,880
Speaker 1: Oh, but the thing is I pointed out to my co-workers and they all paused and thought oh, yeah crap.

559
00:33:17,002 --> 00:33:20,485
Speaker 1: And then they were all kind of Disappointed and disenchanted with the whole affair.

560
00:33:20,505 --> 00:33:23,072
Speaker 0: I basically pointed out watch the video.

561
00:33:23,674 --> 00:33:33,839
Speaker 1: No, no disappointed and disenchanted in that These sorts of pure athletic competitions like the fastest runner the fastest swimmer the fastest biker all those things the farthest thrower.

562
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:37,140
Speaker 1: It's gotten to the point to where the technique will not change.

563
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,380
Speaker 1: The technique is basically he gets run as fast as you possibly can but there is technique.

564
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,113
Speaker 1: Every human gets the effectively.

565
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:48,953
Speaker 1: if you were a competitor at all you get the same training or the effectively the same training.

566
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:54,351
Speaker 1: the amount of how hard you try is Not going to matter because you're not trying any less hard than everyone else.

567
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:56,840
Speaker 0: So it's the same thing with Lance Armstrong giant lungs.

568
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:57,522
Speaker 1: That's it.

569
00:33:57,923 --> 00:34:04,040
Speaker 1: So the hundred meter - and the 200 meter - and all these things are really only now tests of genetics.

570
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is just a competition of who has the best You know.

571
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,839
Speaker 0: enhancement by other means.

572
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:18,679
Speaker 1: Training yes training and chemicals, but even if we outlaw chemicals, it's purely genetics assuming the trainees equal for all.

573
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:31,779
Speaker 1: yep, so it's a competition of who can find the people who have the genetics to beat the record and convince them to be the person to beat the record and have that single-minded focus for their whole lives and Actually train them fully and competently to do it.

574
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,340
Speaker 1: Well, look at you know, Michael Phelps same thing, but isn't it kind of weird that we're basically just testing our genes?

575
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,668
Speaker 1: We're one step cord gattaca.

576
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,408
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I think what they Know.

577
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:54,853
Speaker 0: and first of all in Wikipedia There's a graph that shows Usain Bolt's hundred meter times over the years and it shows like, you know How he got faster and faster and now he's like he could get he could be faster next year Like that'd be insane.

578
00:34:55,054 --> 00:35:03,269
Speaker 0: It's crazy but it pretty much the only person who's gonna break any of his records in the foreseeable future is Him and that's that.

579
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:04,235
Speaker 0: so yeah.

580
00:35:04,758 --> 00:35:05,020
Speaker 0: All right.

581
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,920
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's got to be sucked to be the really fast guy who is gonna be running like next year.

582
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:10,817
Speaker 1: And you're just done.

583
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:13,199
Speaker 0: That's I'm saying Tyson gay.

584
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,787
Speaker 0: It's like if Usain Bolt wasn't there all over.

585
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,131
Speaker 0: the news would be like Tyson gay.

586
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:21,375
Speaker 0: American breaks world record in hundred meter - but Nope, it's not him.

587
00:35:22,502 --> 00:35:24,317
Speaker 0: Someone else came faster at the same time.

588
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:33,678
Speaker 0: Like imagine if you were as good as hockey as Wayne Gretzky Right, and then someone better than a Wayne Gretzky happens to be like joining the NHL at the same time as you.

589
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:37,860
Speaker 0: well now You're not gonna be all awesome and famous because this other guy has taken all the glory.

590
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:44,300
Speaker 0: But if he wasn't there, you'd be the next Wayne Gretzky, but you know, well hockey is also a thing of genetics.

591
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,759
Speaker 1: I mean if you were born north of the Messier line or at least in Russia or Scandinavia.

592
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:52,375
Speaker 0: Anyway, all right.

593
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,183
Speaker 0: So Today's show.

594
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:54,524
Speaker 1: Yep.

595
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:56,310
Speaker 1: Wonder how long we'll talk about this now?

596
00:35:56,371 --> 00:35:58,900
Speaker 1: the very we're not going to get into specific.

597
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:03,040
Speaker 0: I mean, this is the kind of thing you could talk for a hundred years and never be done talking.

598
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:09,340
Speaker 1: It's also the kind of thing where if we wanted to talk about the specifics we would gather all the evidence we need And that sort of thing take forever.

599
00:36:09,741 --> 00:36:17,822
Speaker 1: Basically also as an ulterior motive Scott suggested the show for once and as you all know Scott does not like to talk about anything Political.

600
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:32,927
Speaker 1: so whenever I can to talk about anything whenever he has an inclination to have a topic on a Thursday That is even close to the realm of possibly being in any way maybe tangentially related to something that could be considered politics I'm going to indulge him.

601
00:36:33,188 --> 00:36:44,149
Speaker 1: We're talking about health care because The the debate the national dialogue about health care in America Has basically reverted.

602
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:47,239
Speaker 1: it is reverted to people wargling about Nazis.

603
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:49,527
Speaker 1: But at the same time it's weird.

604
00:36:49,768 --> 00:36:56,352
Speaker 1: the right is accusing the left of being Nazi Socialists, which doesn't quite work in the first place.

605
00:36:56,373 --> 00:37:03,160
Speaker 1: Because fascism and socialism are polar opposites Even though Nazis were called national socialists, but that wasn't what they weren't actually socialists.

606
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,800
Speaker 1: But how can you accuse someone of being a socialist and a Nazi because you have no idea what you're talking about?

607
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can get past that part.

608
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:12,657
Speaker 0: It's not the important part.

609
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:21,340
Speaker 0: It's just Everyone who is discussing the issue of health care in the media and in the government and among the populace.

610
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,580
Speaker 0: Pretty much 99% of people who are opening their mouths are complete retards, you know.

611
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,260
Speaker 0: Maybe not complete retards as a whole but complete retards on this subject and they have no clue what they're talking about.

612
00:37:31,822 --> 00:37:33,568
Speaker 0: Or even if they're intelligent, they're talking.

613
00:37:33,608 --> 00:37:42,672
Speaker 0: they're discussing the wrong thing and just everyone is wrong Even though you know, you might be sitting at home thinking these Oh, yeah, these nice people are right and these people are wrong.

614
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:45,447
Speaker 0: or you know, Obama's plan is good Obama's plan is better.

615
00:37:45,608 --> 00:37:46,091
Speaker 0: who gives a shit.

616
00:37:46,393 --> 00:37:48,563
Speaker 0: You're all wrong Stupid.

617
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:53,101
Speaker 1: I would argue that it's not necessarily a matter of everyone being wrong Objectively.

618
00:37:53,562 --> 00:38:06,007
Speaker 1: Well now the problem is that because the national dialogue about it on all levels except possibly in committee Committee in Congress is like the only place where Theoretically, you know what?

619
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,211
Speaker 0: See span if you want.

620
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the floor is not where you see stuff, you know There's a threat on the forums.

621
00:38:10,646 --> 00:38:12,939
Speaker 0: the people who have trouble going to sleep see span.

622
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,479
Speaker 1: The thing is you might get unlucky and it'll be prank call night.

623
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,911
Speaker 1: People see span gets prank called more than like anything.

624
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:22,296
Speaker 0: See span prank calls are awesome.

625
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:23,320
Speaker 0: Go on YouTube find some.

626
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:23,782
Speaker 1: Where's that?

627
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:27,179
Speaker 1: My favorite whenever is the guy just calls up and he's like something something something fuck.

628
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,144
Speaker 1: No, no even.

629
00:38:28,184 --> 00:38:31,379
Speaker 1: but the guy was like am I on the air and the guys like yes and he goes fuck.

630
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:38,439
Speaker 1: But anyway the it's that the national dialogue is.

631
00:38:38,459 --> 00:38:38,840
Speaker 1: you know there's.

632
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:41,609
Speaker 1: we had that whole show about high-level discourse and how.

633
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:47,887
Speaker 1: the wider a discussion is the lower the level of discourse becomes simply by the nature of the Transmission of memes.

634
00:38:47,947 --> 00:38:49,054
Speaker 0: that's the exact phenomenon.

635
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:51,752
Speaker 0: We're seeing here one Exactly the same thing.

636
00:38:51,772 --> 00:38:58,753
Speaker 1: the national dialogue is at such a low and broad level that There cannot be debate like.

637
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:01,305
Speaker 1: it's not a matter of right and wrong It's a matter of the.

638
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:07,484
Speaker 1: the arguments are such a simplistic level that you cannot be right by nature of the fact that you cannot Even address the scope of the issue.

639
00:39:08,086 --> 00:39:10,933
Speaker 0: So let us address the scope of the issue.

640
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:17,592
Speaker 0: now that we have an intelligent, you know Radio show here now we can do it right because we're so smart.

641
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:17,853
Speaker 0: Yes.

642
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,760
Speaker 1: Well, here's why we can do it one.

643
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:21,864
Speaker 1: We're just gonna give our opinion.

644
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

645
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:24,052
Speaker 1: Benji pendulum.

646
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,155
Speaker 1: What about us?

647
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:26,540
Speaker 1: We're just crazy crazy guy.

648
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,740
Speaker 1: Don't listen to me self-deprecation is pretty much that the ticket.

649
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:31,966
Speaker 0: He's saying crazy shit.

650
00:39:32,006 --> 00:39:33,252
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I'm just some crazy guy.

651
00:39:33,273 --> 00:39:34,760
Speaker 0: I'm not an expert and you know what?

652
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,609
Speaker 0: I am NOT an expert on health care.

653
00:39:36,629 --> 00:39:42,491
Speaker 0: Nope, not at all, but I do know Some fundamental basic things that many people ignore.

654
00:39:42,511 --> 00:39:45,239
Speaker 1: Oh, it's pretty simple when you really break it down one.

655
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:49,560
Speaker 1: Currently in the world there are finite resources.

656
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,426
Speaker 1: Yes, no matter what we do.

657
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:52,249
Speaker 1: There is a limited.

658
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:58,167
Speaker 0: some things are relevant are effectively infinite For example music or atoms.

659
00:39:58,609 --> 00:39:59,872
Speaker 1: atoms, they're there for you.

660
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:00,674
Speaker 1: We just want atoms.

661
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:01,055
Speaker 1: You don't care.

662
00:40:01,075 --> 00:40:01,556
Speaker 1: What kind?

663
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:02,780
Speaker 1: I got a whole bunch.

664
00:40:04,022 --> 00:40:06,713
Speaker 1: But if you want specific kinds, it gets a little more dicey.

665
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:09,464
Speaker 1: I want some gold Adam I can't get you that much.

666
00:40:09,524 --> 00:40:11,470
Speaker 1: strontium and her platinum atoms.

667
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the issue here is this right?

668
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:17,509
Speaker 0: We have these finite resources.

669
00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:19,397
Speaker 0: that are health care resources.

670
00:40:19,598 --> 00:40:27,829
Speaker 0: doctors Hospital beds room in hospitals met a flume shots MRI, you know.

671
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:30,463
Speaker 1: just to zoom out for a second It's not even.

672
00:40:30,484 --> 00:40:35,881
Speaker 1: it's a finite resources of just resources in general and of all the resources and all the things we can use them On.

673
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:38,818
Speaker 1: we have to take a portion of that and decide what portion.

674
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,233
Speaker 1: yeah I'm dedicated to health care before we even talk about the health care part.

675
00:40:42,353 --> 00:40:43,900
Speaker 0: I mean, that's right, you know, it's like, okay.

676
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,646
Speaker 0: So we're digging up, you know magnets.

677
00:40:45,806 --> 00:40:49,840
Speaker 0: Let's say right, you know, we need not say we're digging up some uraniums, right?

678
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:59,905
Speaker 0: We could use these uraniums for radiation therapy for cancer patients Or we could use it for a nuclear power plant or bombs or bombs watched Should we you know, which?

679
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:01,389
Speaker 0: where do we put it right?

680
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,238
Speaker 0: Which one is the best for our society?

681
00:41:04,258 --> 00:41:04,940
Speaker 1: now think about this.

682
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,607
Speaker 1: They will both save lives Nuclear power less pollution.

683
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:12,820
Speaker 1: It gets us off of you know, all the trouble we're having now with oil and coal that sort of thing.

684
00:41:13,701 --> 00:41:15,288
Speaker 1: Don't get me started on nuclear waste.

685
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:17,980
Speaker 1: It's not nearly as big as deals ever makes out to be but that's a whole different discussion.

686
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:20,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll save lives in the long run.

687
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:25,187
Speaker 1: MRIs save lives Obviously, you know.

688
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:28,079
Speaker 1: which avenue of saving lives are we going to take?

689
00:41:29,881 --> 00:41:32,512
Speaker 0: Not just which Avenue right but it's like, okay.

690
00:41:32,592 --> 00:41:34,560
Speaker 0: I have X tons of uranium.

691
00:41:34,941 --> 00:41:35,825
Speaker 0: How many of those?

692
00:41:36,006 --> 00:41:38,294
Speaker 0: how many uraniums do I allocate to this one?

693
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:39,800
Speaker 0: And how many do I allocate to that one?

694
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,471
Speaker 0: It's totally a German board game situation, right?

695
00:41:42,712 --> 00:41:44,379
Speaker 0: How how many guys do I put in?

696
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:48,039
Speaker 0: You know Galicia and how many do I put in the Castillo?

697
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,126
Speaker 1: Never put guys in Galicia.

698
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:51,151
Speaker 1: It's only worth like four points.

699
00:41:51,252 --> 00:41:52,860
Speaker 0: I know right, but you know what I'm saying.

700
00:41:53,701 --> 00:41:57,117
Speaker 1: Anyway, besides I put them all in the Castille and I always win.

701
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:59,885
Speaker 0: Yeah So that's right.

702
00:41:59,905 --> 00:42:02,940
Speaker 0: See these are the people are addressing this whole problem of you know.

703
00:42:03,341 --> 00:42:04,946
Speaker 0: How do we ensure what we've already got?

704
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:08,576
Speaker 0: Nobody's asking the question of well, you know, why?

705
00:42:08,697 --> 00:42:09,780
Speaker 0: what is this that we've already got?

706
00:42:10,104 --> 00:42:10,712
Speaker 0: What do you know?

707
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:11,199
Speaker 0: What do we do?

708
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,842
Speaker 0: You know, they're always.

709
00:42:12,023 --> 00:42:15,240
Speaker 0: they're already have like us accepted all these fundamentals.

710
00:42:15,502 --> 00:42:17,820
Speaker 0: It's always if there's somehow laws of the universe.

711
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:27,692
Speaker 1: Here's the analogy that what the American people are doing is arguing about how to spend the money They won on the lottery that happens next week.

712
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:28,354
Speaker 0: Yep.

713
00:42:28,816 --> 00:42:29,720
Speaker 1: That is what we were doing.

714
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:39,186
Speaker 0: We're arguing on all these specifics and all these details and I believe ignoring all the fundamentals because we're just accepting them and not even Thinking that they could be changed.

715
00:42:39,387 --> 00:42:43,180
Speaker 1: or it's so simple, you know, the national dialogue cannot be complex.

716
00:42:43,361 --> 00:42:48,440
Speaker 1: It is impossible to have a high-level dialogue across that many people even if everyone is intelligent.

717
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,166
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter how intelligent you are.

718
00:42:50,206 --> 00:43:01,011
Speaker 1: It's too complex of an issue for any one person to grasp let alone Everyone, you know, especially even if everyone's intelligent Not everyone's an expert on this particular issue.

719
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:03,740
Speaker 0: There are too many things to know, you know, we're computer people.

720
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,837
Speaker 0: We don't know enough about this to have a super intelligent discussion.

721
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:08,580
Speaker 0: discussion.

722
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,260
Speaker 1: but to the national diet.

723
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,212
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean we can't have a national dialogue and the.

724
00:43:13,513 --> 00:43:19,252
Speaker 1: but if we have a national dialogue It can't be about the specifics or the made-up stuff like the death panels and all the wargling.

725
00:43:19,593 --> 00:43:24,689
Speaker 1: the high-level dialogue is very simple What is what do we want?

726
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,934
Speaker 1: universal health care or not?

727
00:43:26,175 --> 00:43:26,837
Speaker 1: Should we have it?

728
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:27,480
Speaker 1: Is it a right?

729
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,986
Speaker 1: you know all these basic questions.

730
00:43:29,368 --> 00:43:31,619
Speaker 1: how what is the core goal?

731
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:36,487
Speaker 1: and Until we answer that question Everything else we do is just bullshit.

732
00:43:36,768 --> 00:43:41,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, all these specific things like oh, we're gonna tax here Are we gonna decide?

733
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:42,313
Speaker 0: you know this here and it does.

734
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:43,620
Speaker 0: those are specific things.

735
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,000
Speaker 0: You don't decide that until you figured out, you know, the the building block first, right?

736
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,160
Speaker 0: It's like what is our actual goal?

737
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,840
Speaker 0: Is it to have the most people living the most years possible or is it to have the most people living the most?

738
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,830
Speaker 0: Comfortable years, but you know, it's like are we gonna?

739
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:02,620
Speaker 0: you know, are we gonna wait the years based on quality of life?

740
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,562
Speaker 0: Are we gonna?

741
00:44:03,763 --> 00:44:11,631
Speaker 0: you know is every is a year for Bill Gates to live as you know the same as a year for some Homeless bum to live, you know, what are we going to value?

742
00:44:11,672 --> 00:44:13,980
Speaker 0: What are we trying to maximize and minimize here?

743
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:15,047
Speaker 0: So that is the.

744
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:16,054
Speaker 0: that is step one.

745
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:21,253
Speaker 0: You've got to decide What is your goal and you know and the problem is already look how high level this is.

746
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:27,571
Speaker 1: it did such a. we have Priorities as a society, but we don't write them down.

747
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:30,960
Speaker 1: We don't decide specifically, you know, these are the priorities of our society.

748
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,220
Speaker 1: This is what we want to accomplish as a people to better ourselves.

749
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:37,020
Speaker 1: It's health care more or less important than the military?

750
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:42,359
Speaker 1: is it more or less important than certain economic factors than certain ideologies like capitalism or socialism?

751
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:46,092
Speaker 1: and We haven't even addressed that sort of thing.

752
00:44:46,212 --> 00:44:47,036
Speaker 0: The other thing right.

753
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:47,840
Speaker 0: check this out, right?

754
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,900
Speaker 0: Let's say, you know, I just gave you all these different possible goals, right?

755
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,391
Speaker 0: Let's say our goal is to have the most people live the longest.

756
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:54,737
Speaker 0: just you know, I'm just saying right.

757
00:44:54,898 --> 00:44:55,320
Speaker 0: Let's say it.

758
00:44:55,425 --> 00:45:03,880
Speaker 0: Let's pretend You know the best way to get the most people live the longest might not be to spend money on medicine and hospitals.

759
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:13,268
Speaker 0: You're actually probably gonna get a lot more people living on average a lot longer if you spend your money on things like health education Exercising better food.

760
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:15,160
Speaker 1: I mean look at what I just talked about in the news.

761
00:45:15,461 --> 00:45:20,460
Speaker 1: The primary cause of the peak of life expectancy in America is obesity.

762
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:28,124
Speaker 0: obesity is there's a much greater correlation between shorter life and Low income.

763
00:45:28,304 --> 00:45:32,820
Speaker 0: then there is a correlation between shorter life and no medicine, you know.

764
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,916
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's sort of like this idea that medicine is what makes longer life.

765
00:45:36,956 --> 00:45:42,030
Speaker 0: Well, not really Yet, maybe we definitely necessary beat all the easy stuff.

766
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:45,060
Speaker 1: I mean not that many people die of typhus in America anymore.

767
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:45,664
Speaker 0: No, I'm not.

768
00:45:45,744 --> 00:45:48,080
Speaker 0: I'm not saying medicine shouldn't be here is not important.

769
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:49,972
Speaker 1: We got to this point.

770
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:50,919
Speaker 0: saying is that you know

771
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:08,337
Speaker 1: We got to this point and now it's almost a decline because we're we're just managing our resources really inefficiently Because we haven't decided what's important to us as a people and while and that is where there is reasonable debate We can debate as a society whether or not universal health care is a right.

772
00:46:08,478 --> 00:46:09,080
Speaker 1: I believe it is.

773
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,020
Speaker 0: No, I mean, you know, I think it's a very high priority.

774
00:46:13,221 --> 00:46:16,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it is a very high priority, but I think the question, you know what?

775
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:22,920
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's say we go and we decide okay This is how much we're gonna give to health care and this is how much are you doing?

776
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:25,808
Speaker 1: Very simple goal because we have to really define it.

777
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:32,311
Speaker 1: something along the lines of it is the right of every now I don't know citizen or person living in the United States.

778
00:46:32,392 --> 00:46:34,620
Speaker 1: That's that see again conflated with all these other issues.

779
00:46:34,841 --> 00:46:47,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the go of people here in some capacity, however, we define that to have available to them No matter what universally some minimal level of health care some minimal level.

780
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:50,035
Speaker 0: So now we get into this further debate, right?

781
00:46:50,055 --> 00:46:50,900
Speaker 0: We've already figured out.

782
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,860
Speaker 0: So there's the look at how many levels there are this how many resources do we give to health care versus other things?

783
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,430
Speaker 0: Right, then there's you know within the health care, right?

784
00:46:59,470 --> 00:46:59,711
Speaker 0: Okay.

785
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:02,300
Speaker 0: These are all the health care resources we have.

786
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:06,052
Speaker 0: How many do we give out per person right?

787
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:13,300
Speaker 0: You can't even if we have universal health care for everyone That doesn't mean that you can just get whatever health care you need whenever you want, right?

788
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,244
Speaker 0: I mean you can't.

789
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,880
Speaker 0: there aren't enough like, you know organs for everyone who needs an organ transplant.

790
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,680
Speaker 0: There aren't enough to flu shots for everyone who needs a flu shot.

791
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:26,840
Speaker 0: There aren't enough doctors to spend enough time with everyone who needs to spend time with a doctor.

792
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,663
Speaker 0: I mean some things.

793
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:28,406
Speaker 0: there's enough of.

794
00:47:28,426 --> 00:47:29,892
Speaker 0: there's enough Tylenol for everybody.

795
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:31,217
Speaker 0: There's no worry about the Tylenol.

796
00:47:31,237 --> 00:47:31,920
Speaker 1: now think about this.

797
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,140
Speaker 0: There's not enough hospital beds for everyone who needs to be in the hospital to stay in the hospital.

798
00:47:36,786 --> 00:47:38,180
Speaker 1: They need to with hospital beds.

799
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,000
Speaker 1: There's a good example.

800
00:47:39,522 --> 00:47:41,429
Speaker 1: Should there be and can there be?

801
00:47:41,449 --> 00:47:44,600
Speaker 1: and I don't think anyone is addressing either of those questions.

802
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,346
Speaker 1: I mean we need to know.

803
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:48,484
Speaker 1: we need to know the answer of one What would it cost?

804
00:47:48,524 --> 00:47:53,660
Speaker 1: or what do we think it would cost to provide enough hospital beds for everyone in America who needs one?

805
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:57,600
Speaker 1: Before we know what that costs we can't decide whether or not it's worth it.

806
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,382
Speaker 1: Does the society?

807
00:47:58,803 --> 00:48:06,226
Speaker 1: because it might be reasonable it might seriously be reasonable to offer that to have that to pay for that But at the same time it might not.

808
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:10,221
Speaker 1: it might cost so much that will destroy some other part of our society just to pay For it.

809
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:17,087
Speaker 0: yeah, and let's say all right, so let's say we decide you know to get a hundred hospital beds right and today 150 people need them.

810
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:19,660
Speaker 0: how do we decide which 50 people?

811
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,226
Speaker 0: Don't get them or do we?

812
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:21,969
Speaker 0: are we gonna?

813
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:24,280
Speaker 0: are we gonna say the old people who are closer to death?

814
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,902
Speaker 0: Don't get them.

815
00:48:24,942 --> 00:48:26,810
Speaker 0: are we gonna say the people you know who?

816
00:48:26,891 --> 00:48:29,000
Speaker 0: how do you make this decision now right now?

817
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,130
Speaker 0: You make the decision you know using a various means.

818
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:35,279
Speaker 0: you know triage first come first serve sometimes money.

819
00:48:36,343 --> 00:48:44,314
Speaker 1: I mean look at if you treat the poor person who comes in first for one thing versus the old person who wouldn't have that much longer to live anyway.

820
00:48:44,334 --> 00:48:52,806
Speaker 1: all right and all this sort of really cold scary morally ambiguous logic and What it all in the national dialogue?

821
00:48:52,826 --> 00:48:53,328
Speaker 1: What do we get?

822
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:56,720
Speaker 1: we get the far-right saying things like they're gonna ration health care?

823
00:48:57,322 --> 00:48:58,345
Speaker 0: It's already rationed.

824
00:48:58,526 --> 00:48:59,388
Speaker 1: it's not it's.

825
00:48:59,489 --> 00:48:59,609
Speaker 1: it's.

826
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,556
Speaker 0: that's like saying what rat rationing is.

827
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:05,111
Speaker 0: you have a limited resource You don't let out no matter how you dole it out.

828
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:05,814
Speaker 0: You're rationing.

829
00:49:05,895 --> 00:49:08,064
Speaker 1: if we didn't have to ration it It wouldn't be a debate.

830
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:09,470
Speaker 1: We wouldn't have to worry about it.

831
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's already being rationed.

832
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,533
Speaker 0: I'm making a distribution system regardless of what that system is for.

833
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:28,152
Speaker 1: giving out a limited resource is rationing but making the argument that you know the the new the current plan is gonna be rationing health care and Denying care to old fever all this stuff.

834
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,740
Speaker 1: We already do that.

835
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:33,200
Speaker 1: That's like arguing that we shouldn't have national health care because the sky is blue.

836
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:35,685
Speaker 0: Yeah There's no way to avoid doing that.

837
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:38,393
Speaker 0: the question is how should we ration it?

838
00:49:38,553 --> 00:49:40,358
Speaker 1: or is it possible to avoid it?

839
00:49:40,699 --> 00:49:40,860
Speaker 1: hmm?

840
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:41,942
Speaker 1: It on some level.

841
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:51,696
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe we can't give everyone in America the multi-billion dollar like experimental crazy brain surgery But I think we can give everyone in America fix a broken bone.

842
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:55,120
Speaker 0: Oh absolutely I think we can but we don't even have that in America.

843
00:49:55,321 --> 00:50:02,134
Speaker 1: Well if you go to the emergency room, they give you test and people you know They think about these things in such simplistic terms in the media.

844
00:50:02,556 --> 00:50:03,520
Speaker 1: look at the emergency room.

845
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:12,498
Speaker 1: This is the example that bothers me the fact that Emergency rooms are so overcrowded and at the same time people complain about the fact that we should like say we.

846
00:50:12,879 --> 00:50:18,679
Speaker 1: I think we should Allow minimal levels of health care even to illegal immigrants to anyone within the borders of the United States.

847
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:21,880
Speaker 0: What happens then is people start coming to the u.s.

848
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:26,980
Speaker 0: You know from who knows where to just you know leech you know and that that can you know be a huge drain.

849
00:50:27,161 --> 00:50:27,964
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

850
00:50:28,004 --> 00:50:28,526
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

851
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,173
Speaker 1: this is the whole sunk cost fallacy.

852
00:50:30,253 --> 00:50:31,740
Speaker 1: actually it's a little more complex than that.

853
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, right now those people go to the emergency room.

854
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:36,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they get treated anyway.

855
00:50:36,441 --> 00:50:38,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now they're in the way of legitimate emergencies.

856
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,162
Speaker 1: You know some poor person may be an illegal immigrant Maybe not.

857
00:50:42,182 --> 00:50:44,071
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter who doesn't have health care.

858
00:50:44,755 --> 00:50:47,608
Speaker 1: if they need treatment They have to go to an emergency room.

859
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,894
Speaker 1: You know wait eight hours.

860
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,120
Speaker 1: I have all that misery.

861
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:51,404
Speaker 1: Do it.

862
00:50:51,786 --> 00:50:53,053
Speaker 1: clog up the hospital system.

863
00:50:53,113 --> 00:50:54,240
Speaker 1: clog up the emergency room.

864
00:50:54,962 --> 00:51:00,300
Speaker 1: It would probably be cheaper to give these people minimal health care for free during the day at clinics.

865
00:51:00,722 --> 00:51:03,312
Speaker 1: Then it is to have the current system where they go to the emergency room.

866
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:09,359
Speaker 1: it costs a lot more dollars To have people you know doctors in the emergency room at 4 a.m.. To deal with these people.

867
00:51:09,379 --> 00:51:11,908
Speaker 1: yeah And the bill if we're already paying for it anyway.

868
00:51:12,229 --> 00:51:15,260
Speaker 1: We can pay less and help these people more.

869
00:51:16,023 --> 00:51:18,658
Speaker 1: It seems like a a trivial decision to make.

870
00:51:18,919 --> 00:51:19,943
Speaker 0: well I mean the other prop.

871
00:51:19,983 --> 00:51:25,782
Speaker 0: the main problem here right is the problem of the pragmatism of the situation and the morality of the Situation.

872
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:28,113
Speaker 0: right I mean you look and you say okay.

873
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:31,987
Speaker 0: You know there are only Ten flu shots right we've got in.

874
00:51:32,148 --> 00:51:33,532
Speaker 0: this is 20 people.

875
00:51:33,552 --> 00:51:35,880
Speaker 0: we have to decide which ten people get them.

876
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,760
Speaker 0: So let's say you're sitting around a table right and you say okay, 20 strangers walk into the hospital.

877
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:43,375
Speaker 0: How do we decide which ten people get them right?

878
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:44,300
Speaker 0: so everyone?

879
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,873
Speaker 0: You know some people might say well whoever can pay the most?

880
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:51,191
Speaker 0: and some people might say well Whoever is you know that has the greatest chance of getting the flu?

881
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:53,159
Speaker 0: or maybe the pregnant women should get them first.

882
00:51:53,199 --> 00:52:03,031
Speaker 0: right we can Come up with a system right you know and people will typically you know you can get maybe an agreement on this system of deciding Which ten people out of the 20 you're gonna get the flu shots.

883
00:52:03,071 --> 00:52:05,220
Speaker 0: the problem is then you say okay?

884
00:52:05,502 --> 00:52:06,991
Speaker 0: It's not 20 strangers anymore.

885
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:08,320
Speaker 0: It's your family.

886
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:10,891
Speaker 0: Now it's like oh shit right.

887
00:52:11,011 --> 00:52:14,008
Speaker 0: everyone says no my family You know has to get it first.

888
00:52:14,108 --> 00:52:19,487
Speaker 0: right you know one's gonna if you go to the hospital And it's your mom right and the system We decided was there was the.

889
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:31,052
Speaker 0: you know the most needy is gonna get it And it's decided that your mom is is you know not the most needy and she's not gonna get the flu shot and someone else Is gonna get it you're gonna be pissed and that's why you had the.

890
00:52:31,212 --> 00:52:32,055
Speaker 0: you know people don't.

891
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:34,222
Speaker 0: they can't deal with that You know.

892
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:45,380
Speaker 0: so that's why everyone has to argue for a system where somehow Everyone gets everything that they ought that they need you know regardless of cost and that just it's unworkable.

893
00:52:45,721 --> 00:52:50,960
Speaker 0: So we have to do this cold and immoral thing to have our society.

894
00:52:51,221 --> 00:52:55,380
Speaker 1: I don't think necessarily immoral, but amoral because yeah, it's not like there's an alternative.

895
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:56,387
Speaker 1: It would be immoral.

896
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,655
Speaker 1: if there is an alternative Everyone gets true correct and for some things.

897
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:12,387
Speaker 1: this is for example Honestly if we won't treat a broken bone for someone in this country That is immoral because we as a society could pay for that is enough cast to go and Gladly should be willing to pay.

898
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:13,572
Speaker 0: it's not a shortage of cast.

899
00:53:13,592 --> 00:53:14,496
Speaker 0: They're not expensive.

900
00:53:14,636 --> 00:53:15,560
Speaker 1: It is not immoral.

901
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:23,750
Speaker 1: I don't think in my opinion to not give everyone who needs it the multi-million dollar brain surgery Because we can't we cannot afford that.

902
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,435
Speaker 1: it is it's not a reasonable request.

903
00:53:25,475 --> 00:53:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the other issue.

904
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,385
Speaker 0: Right is that you know people.

905
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:36,460
Speaker 0: you know they want health care to be a better right because they complain all the doctors are not Nice, or you know it's I had a horrible time in the hospital wasn't pleasant.

906
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:39,460
Speaker 0: I waited too long in the emergency room, and they want to pay less.

907
00:53:40,262 --> 00:53:43,140
Speaker 0: How could something be better when you're paying less if you want to be better?

908
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:50,768
Speaker 1: The people who are against all this they they think thing along the lines of well We shouldn't be subsidizing those poor people.

909
00:53:51,169 --> 00:53:54,760
Speaker 0: yeah, right you can't have something better and pay less for it.

910
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:54,880
Speaker 0: now.

911
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,617
Speaker 0: It is true that there are many areas in the health care system where there are great inefficiencies.

912
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:03,749
Speaker 0: We were spending Unnecessary money on things where there's a lot of money.

913
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,940
Speaker 0: You know going that is that doesn't need to be going and that is true.

914
00:54:07,642 --> 00:54:11,110
Speaker 0: However, that doesn't mean right that doesn't you know?

915
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:17,622
Speaker 0: get rid of the fact that health care is in essence ludicrously Expensive.

916
00:54:18,144 --> 00:54:19,949
Speaker 0: it is stupid expensive right?

917
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:22,836
Speaker 0: you need machines that cost millions and millions of dollars.

918
00:54:23,117 --> 00:54:24,120
Speaker 0: you need doctors.

919
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:28,258
Speaker 0: Guess what doctors are expensive, and you might say all those doctors are getting overpaid.

920
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:30,645
Speaker 0: all right You tell me doctors getting overpaid.

921
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:37,519
Speaker 0: someone goes to school for ten years of their life pays all that tuition and all those student Loans right and now they work.

922
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:40,200
Speaker 0: You know what kind of hour they have to work first of all when you're a new doctor.

923
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:43,014
Speaker 0: They work you like crazy friggin all day all night.

924
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:44,240
Speaker 0: You know crazy hours.

925
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,163
Speaker 0: That's why doctors.

926
00:54:45,183 --> 00:54:49,980
Speaker 0: You know they only see you for five minutes because they're driving around town to three different hospitals, right?

927
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,107
Speaker 0: You know that's why I think you know I don't you know.

928
00:54:52,168 --> 00:54:55,280
Speaker 0: people often joke about like ah them doctors playing golf all day.

929
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:58,199
Speaker 0: Yeah, they play golf one day a week because you know what?

930
00:54:58,723 --> 00:55:00,639
Speaker 0: They work like crazy the whole rest of the week.

931
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:04,769
Speaker 0: Doctor ain't gonna go live that shitty life of a doctor right?

932
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,497
Speaker 0: for you know penny change right.

933
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:12,680
Speaker 0: doctors got to get paid Big-time monies and his time is real valuable, and there's not enough doctors.

934
00:55:13,302 --> 00:55:14,970
Speaker 0: And cuz you know why there's not enough doctors?

935
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,080
Speaker 0: because it's hard really really hard.

936
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:18,168
Speaker 0: And you know.

937
00:55:18,551 --> 00:55:19,760
Speaker 0: so doctors are expensive.

938
00:55:20,121 --> 00:55:23,010
Speaker 0: Medical equipment is expensive the drugs are expensive.

939
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:24,334
Speaker 0: and you know why the drugs are expensive?

940
00:55:24,736 --> 00:55:26,020
Speaker 0: because we had to research them.

941
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:29,297
Speaker 0: How much money do you think people have donated to like?

942
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:29,960
Speaker 0: you know cancer?

943
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:36,460
Speaker 0: How many different like walks for breast cancer or you know putting quarters in the piece of cardboard at the at the grocery store?

944
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:46,648
Speaker 0: There have been billions upon billions Maybe even tens of or hundreds of billions of dollars collected to do cancer curing research We're still have not cured cancer.

945
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:49,016
Speaker 0: That is the cost of medical research.

946
00:55:49,197 --> 00:55:52,309
Speaker 0: It is insane Perhaps the most expensive thing.

947
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,602
Speaker 0: at the same time it has to be paid for somehow.

948
00:55:55,682 --> 00:56:06,919
Speaker 1: at the same time remember one interesting thing is that as time goes on the cost of old treatments go down and down of course and We can say I mean would it be an interesting a system?

949
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:13,660
Speaker 1: Where the only thing that money gets you is that you have access to the new treatment earlier.

950
00:56:14,145 --> 00:56:18,069
Speaker 1: But as treatments get cheaper They're then entered into eventually.

951
00:56:18,611 --> 00:56:20,960
Speaker 1: you know the effective public domain where the government pays for it.

952
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,354
Speaker 0: So but let's say you know everyone just waited around for the old treatments, right?

953
00:56:25,776 --> 00:56:31,486
Speaker 0: I mean no paying for the new treatment Trivially because that's how it is.

954
00:56:31,526 --> 00:56:32,972
Speaker 1: now the people who have money pay.

955
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:34,580
Speaker 1: Oh, you're the rich man.

956
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,220
Speaker 1: Do you want to pay for the poor man's medicine without yeah?

957
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,529
Speaker 0: That was the the greatest thing in iron monkey.

958
00:56:39,709 --> 00:56:44,326
Speaker 0: You know some kung fu movie right as the better Attitude on health care right.

959
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:47,440
Speaker 0: and there's a scene in iron monkey where the iron monkey is a doctor, right?

960
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,020
Speaker 0: He's a brandy doctor with herbs and shit, but that's besides the point right it's a movie.

961
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,111
Speaker 1: And then that in the movie where kung fu is magic.

962
00:56:53,473 --> 00:56:54,780
Speaker 1: that is real medicine, okay?

963
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:55,764
Speaker 0: But you know these gets.

964
00:56:55,784 --> 00:57:01,086
Speaker 0: these two people come in and have the exact same ailment right and he writes the same Prescription for both of them right.

965
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:04,260
Speaker 1: one of them is I know that he writes two prescriptions at the same time with both hands.

966
00:57:04,461 --> 00:57:05,347
Speaker 0: Yes, he's.

967
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:09,724
Speaker 0: one of them is a homeless bum You know well not a bum But just a homeless poor guy.

968
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:16,648
Speaker 0: and the other guy is like a rich guy who runs a brothel right and you know the the He the poor man.

969
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:22,440
Speaker 0: He says oh your medicine is free and the rich man He's like oh yours is like ten gold pieces and the rich man's like that's insane.

970
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,629
Speaker 0: He's getting the same thing as me, and he doesn't have to pay.

971
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,259
Speaker 0: and the iron monkey's like oh, maybe you can't afford it.

972
00:57:28,023 --> 00:57:28,445
Speaker 0: He's like.

973
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:32,024
Speaker 0: and because he's so proud of being rich He pays it right.

974
00:57:32,385 --> 00:57:33,751
Speaker 0: and that's you know.

975
00:57:34,092 --> 00:57:35,718
Speaker 0: people think oh, it's socialism.

976
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:44,375
Speaker 0: well You know what though honestly, but you know when it comes to something like Medicine you know I mean you can't.

977
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:45,260
Speaker 0: you know nobody.

978
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:53,147
Speaker 0: I think you know even if you want to talk about the morals of doling out these finite health care resources Nobody, I think it was a moral.

979
00:57:53,187 --> 00:58:02,817
Speaker 0: human being is gonna say that the people with the most money should get the health care Resources and the people with the less money shouldn't get the health care resources or should get the second picks right.

980
00:58:02,997 --> 00:58:04,020
Speaker 0: that is immoral.

981
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,920
Speaker 1: There's gotta be some like douchebag guy out there.

982
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:12,733
Speaker 0: So some guys like yeah You know first pay first serve right not first come first serve or most need.

983
00:58:12,753 --> 00:58:16,752
Speaker 0: just whoever has the most money should get the stuff And whoever doesn't have the money shouldn't get anything.

984
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,960
Speaker 1: of course you got to be careful with.

985
00:58:18,982 --> 00:58:23,460
Speaker 1: Good person says that nobody first come first serve might leave you with a monster.

986
00:58:24,243 --> 00:58:25,569
Speaker 0: It might leave you with a monster.

987
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:26,272
Speaker 0: Yes the first guy.

988
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:28,120
Speaker 0: I don't think it should be first come first serve either.

989
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,482
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah the thing it It's.

990
00:58:31,024 --> 00:58:34,433
Speaker 1: but I mean people aren't willing to even consider ideas like this.

991
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:38,748
Speaker 0: because people because what happens is the Debate gets framed in such a way.

992
00:58:38,768 --> 00:58:42,443
Speaker 0: I mean like look you know this Obama's got this you know propose It's a bill right.

993
00:58:42,503 --> 00:58:47,700
Speaker 0: so so the debate is all about the specifics of this law that it's framed.

994
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:50,969
Speaker 0: So you can only argue things within this one particular context.

995
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:58,579
Speaker 0: if people are incapable of discussing the broader issue They haven't even thought about these concepts outside of you know well.

996
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,188
Speaker 0: Should we have insurance this way or insurance this way?

997
00:59:01,228 --> 00:59:02,453
Speaker 0: wait you're talking about insurance.

998
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:04,219
Speaker 0: you haven't even talked about you know what?

999
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,342
Speaker 0: Ensuring what.

1000
00:59:05,764 --> 00:59:06,346
Speaker 0: you don't even know.

1001
00:59:06,387 --> 00:59:07,069
Speaker 0: what's going on.

1002
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,780
Speaker 0: You know before that you've already got all these other things.

1003
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,685
Speaker 0: You just assume those are true as if somehow They're the laws of physics.

1004
00:59:13,725 --> 00:59:17,058
Speaker 1: you know like a help that the national dialogue is basically just lies.

1005
00:59:17,218 --> 00:59:18,121
Speaker 1: at this point It's just.

1006
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,271
Speaker 0: it's just lies and idiocy from everybody.

1007
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:22,596
Speaker 0: no one no one knows anything.

1008
00:59:22,656 --> 00:59:23,900
Speaker 0: They're all just retarded whatever.

1009
00:59:25,022 --> 00:59:27,471
Speaker 0: Yeah, hopefully you know people are listening to this.

1010
00:59:27,632 --> 00:59:29,860
Speaker 0: obviously we are not super health care experts.

1011
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,279
Speaker 0: We didn't bring our data's and our statistics.

1012
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:32,681
Speaker 0: You know.

1013
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:36,757
Speaker 0: one thing I would like you to go and don't think about things in terms of.

1014
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:37,460
Speaker 0: you know.

1015
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:42,055
Speaker 0: This is the mealy mealy bits of insurance, and how do you pay for this night?

1016
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:43,400
Speaker 0: think about the fundamental?

1017
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:48,592
Speaker 0: Problem and that there are finite health care resources their finite resources period.

1018
00:59:49,174 --> 00:59:49,595
Speaker 0: how?

1019
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:51,320
Speaker 0: what is a fair way?

1020
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,798
Speaker 0: To dole them out?

1021
00:59:53,826 --> 00:59:54,478
Speaker 0: Who gets them?

1022
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:02,004
Speaker 0: Think about that well, then you'll begin to form up on top of whatever you decide in that department Honestly real opinion.

1023
01:00:02,084 --> 01:00:04,492
Speaker 1: even beyond that people are acting like.

1024
01:00:04,512 --> 01:00:07,200
Speaker 1: this is such a pressing issue and this law.

1025
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,686
Speaker 1: We've got to push this law through and it.

1026
01:00:09,108 --> 01:00:09,590
Speaker 1: it amazes me.

1027
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,675
Speaker 1: How fast everything's going.

1028
01:00:11,177 --> 01:00:12,628
Speaker 1: I'm on the rush I'm up.

1029
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:13,580
Speaker 1: well people are dying.

1030
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:22,044
Speaker 1: But I'm of the mind really that any different than a month ago or two months ago reform on this scale Requires a Part.

1031
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:29,640
Speaker 1: it might be a product of the way our partisan politics work, but to me This is like a 20-year project like this is something that needs to be started now.

1032
01:00:30,064 --> 01:00:31,156
Speaker 1: We need to be working on it.

1033
01:00:31,641 --> 01:00:36,898
Speaker 1: But the proposal of what to do should take four or five years of experts debating.

1034
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:40,980
Speaker 0: yeah I mean, this is you know it's something something so complex right?

1035
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,774
Speaker 0: I mean we haven't even debated the fundamental part right we?

1036
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:51,419
Speaker 0: once you figure that out Then you figure out and then think about how long it would take to figure out all the specifics all the systems all of the.

1037
01:00:51,781 --> 01:01:00,793
Speaker 0: You know bureaucracy that has to happen for the and then while you're doing you're gonna get the Duke Nukem forever Problem of as you're working on it things get better and the whole thing changes.

1038
01:01:00,854 --> 01:01:01,114
