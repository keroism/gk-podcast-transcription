1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,434
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday April 19th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,474 --> 00:00:17,498
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about two anime zegapane and air gear.

3
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,887
Speaker 0: Let's do this Well like we've said this weekend.

4
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:34,458
Speaker 0: We're heading out to Rochester to do a live show at ToraCon Hooray, I have to drive for many hours Yeah, but with a whole bunch of people it'll be fun and tiring.

5
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:39,540
Speaker 0: at least It won't likely be like our last foray into Rochester, which was an unmitigated failure.

6
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:45,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the first time I think we ever screwed something up, but it really wasn't so much us a hundred percent

7
00:00:45,321 --> 00:01:00,923
Speaker 0: yeah, well it was more that we planned everything out and we decided to go to Rochester and do a thing and Somehow through no fault of our own the thing we'd planned to do was cancelled by the people who were supposed to be doing it Thus leaving us in the lurch This time.

8
00:01:00,943 --> 00:01:09,075
Speaker 0: they can't cancel it because I know there are hundreds and hundreds of people who are also coming to do the same Thing and if they cancel it will rally those hundreds of people and teach them a lesson.

9
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,620
Speaker 0: Yep a lesson involving fire.

10
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,071
Speaker 1: Involving fire that's that's a good lesson.

11
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:22,886
Speaker 1: I was expecting to teach him a different lesson Involving acid, but that's a fire lesson is good, too alright, so It's Wednesday.

12
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:24,435
Speaker 1: I got some comic news here.

13
00:01:24,737 --> 00:01:32,340
Speaker 1: apparently Some comic books of the American variety are gonna start doing product placements like in the olden days.

14
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:35,752
Speaker 0: No, not obscure comics or like little indie comics that need money.

15
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:45,899
Speaker 1: we're talking like the new x-men yeah, like characters will have like a Nike swoosh on their shirt and such and There's like it bombs outside.

16
00:01:46,804 --> 00:01:47,415
Speaker 1: What's going on?

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,873
Speaker 0: All right, we're sorry if we sound a little distracted at this point But there is apparently a small world war going on outside our house.

18
00:01:55,893 --> 00:01:57,598
Speaker 1: I was about to make the same joke.

19
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,899
Speaker 0: you bastard That's what happens when you live with the same geeks for long enough.

20
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:10,679
Speaker 1: So yeah, but seriously like there's a major shelling going on down the road We get we really don't know what's going on, but and we're gonna try to ignore it.

21
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:16,099
Speaker 0: But just so you know if we periodically sound distracted is because there's fucking explosions going on outside.

22
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,445
Speaker 1: Yeah We're not even joking.

23
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:18,209
Speaker 1: you might hear them.

24
00:02:18,812 --> 00:02:25,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're pretty loud Alright, so comics comics product placements.

25
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:28,080
Speaker 0: now this product placement isn't in like the obscure crap.

26
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,660
Speaker 0: This isn't like the new x-men or whatever comics are popular with you young kids in other words the unobscure crap.

27
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:39,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so the point is is that some people are like product placement is evil.

28
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:41,840
Speaker 1: Oh my god what the fuck and other people are like.

29
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,967
Speaker 1: Product placement is just fine.

30
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:52,152
Speaker 1: It even makes it more real why you know instead of having some generic ass clothing It's more like the real world where everything's brand up now to me.

31
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:53,940
Speaker 0: There are basically two kinds of product placement.

32
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,140
Speaker 0: I generally break it up into the good kind and the bad kind or more likely the indifferent kind and the hateful kind.

33
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:01,943
Speaker 0: I mean on one hand.

34
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:07,760
Speaker 0: There's alright say in a script a guy drinks a soda from a can and it doesn't really matter.

35
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,026
Speaker 0: It's not important to the plot.

36
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:09,910
Speaker 0: It's not like dr.

37
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:11,719
Speaker 0: Peppers the cure for AIDS at the end of the movie.

38
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:14,065
Speaker 0: So if the guy if dr.

39
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:16,432
Speaker 0: Pepper pays whatever to make that can of dr.

40
00:03:16,452 --> 00:03:18,197
Speaker 0: Pepper can instead of mr.

41
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,468
Speaker 0: Pibb can I don't care Because it doesn't matter.

42
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,334
Speaker 0: he was drinking a soda.

43
00:03:21,676 --> 00:03:22,119
Speaker 0: That's fine.

44
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:33,660
Speaker 0: Now if it's like that national treasure movie where not only is everyone in the movie drinking like Dasani or Aquafina, I don't know which one it was but they were drinking one of those bottle.

45
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,624
Speaker 0: Well, I didn't even notice.

46
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:38,800
Speaker 0: so I noticed it because there's one scene where he's like he's looking at something and he can't read it.

47
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:49,537
Speaker 0: so he grabs of one of the bottles of water and holds it up in front of the camera like a magnifying glass and Like the camera zooms in and focuses on the label for a second and it's like wow.

48
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay If that happens, that's definitely out of place.

49
00:03:53,028 --> 00:04:00,835
Speaker 1: But the thing that really gets me is when they do product placements Let's say Pepsi pays for a product placement, right and Coke doesn't.

50
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:12,927
Speaker 1: all of a sudden I mean sure it makes sense That if say it was a comic taking place at one college that Pepsi bought out the college everything would be Pepsi But Pepsi didn't buy out the world.

51
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:19,798
Speaker 1: if you're gonna place brands in there if you want to talk about realism You got to put all the brands in there.

52
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:24,092
Speaker 1: You know, I mean there should be a Pepsi machine next to a coke machine.

53
00:04:24,252 --> 00:04:25,376
Speaker 1: That's that's realism.

54
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then Pepsi won't pay.

55
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,184
Speaker 1: No shit.

56
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:29,873
Speaker 1: See that's the problem is.

57
00:04:30,014 --> 00:04:36,140
Speaker 1: the other problem is that They you know, you should be able to put those things in there without paying or getting paid.

58
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is that I want to make a comic and have all kinds of different real brands in there.

59
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,319
Speaker 1: I should be allowed to do that.

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,303
Speaker 0: Yep I mean back in the day.

61
00:04:42,343 --> 00:04:45,939
Speaker 0: a lot of video games wanted to do that sort of thing and the companies would always say no.

62
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:52,437
Speaker 0: So you were forced to have these like generic made-up like cola cora stuff floating around coral Cola.

63
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:52,858
Speaker 1: Yeah.

64
00:04:52,998 --> 00:04:54,802
Speaker 1: Yeah Was that?

65
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,026
Speaker 1: that's the star tropics?

66
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:58,975
Speaker 1: I think the island was named coral Cola or something.

67
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:00,640
Speaker 0: Ah star tropics was a good game.

68
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,248
Speaker 1: They need to bring that shit back.

69
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:05,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though the game is now just tedious and difficult It's not so.

70
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:07,548
Speaker 1: at least you get the yo-yo action in there.

71
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:08,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you also get the tedium.

72
00:05:09,294 --> 00:05:10,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's alright.

73
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:18,703
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah comic nerds are in an uproar over this and I'm fine with that because I Don't really.

74
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:21,512
Speaker 1: I don't read any of the comics that are gonna get ads in them.

75
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:23,097
Speaker 0: I just don't like comic nerds.

76
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:27,250
Speaker 0: Yeah there's a big difference between a comic geek and a comic nerd.

77
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:33,830
Speaker 0: comic nerds the people who read like the 1970s spider-man and they they swear by and they think it's awesome.

78
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,099
Speaker 1: Worst advertisement ever.

79
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:45,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right All right, so I commute about Five minutes.

80
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,590
Speaker 0: Scott commutes about an hour.

81
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:48,739
Speaker 0: He used to commute about an hour into the city.

82
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,857
Speaker 0: Yep And it's my opinion that an hour is probably the longest commute.

83
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:56,750
Speaker 0: I could stand without Freaking out and killing everyone in the world.

84
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,880
Speaker 1: if my commute was any longer that room wouldn't be here.

85
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,915
Speaker 0: Yeah, now there's some contest.

86
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:02,960
Speaker 0: I think Midas put it on.

87
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,319
Speaker 0: I don't really care where they were trying to find whoever in us had the longest commute of anyone.

88
00:06:07,922 --> 00:06:08,483
Speaker 1: Well, it's obvious.

89
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,112
Speaker 1: see some guy probably uses a helicopter or something.

90
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:18,714
Speaker 0: no, it's some dude who drives Seven hours total every day to his job with Cisco.

91
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:20,379
Speaker 1: What what what the hell?

92
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,584
Speaker 1: How did you sit in the?

93
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:24,400
Speaker 1: I can barely sit three and a half hours like a day trip?

94
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,066
Speaker 1: Like I'm going somewhere.

95
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,235
Speaker 0: three and a half hours is almost to Rochester.

96
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm here.

97
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,486
Speaker 0: It's crazy in three and a half hours.

98
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:33,351
Speaker 0: I caught them now.

99
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:36,300
Speaker 0: The thing is the contest was you know that you had to verify it.

100
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:41,520
Speaker 0: I have a sneaking suspicion a tiny suspicion that this is not entirely legitimate.

101
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,897
Speaker 0: My I have this feeling that it's possible that he does indeed work at the Cisco.

102
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:48,163
Speaker 0: That is 168 miles from his house.

103
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:52,807
Speaker 0: I Goddamn those explosions outside.

104
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:53,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

105
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll get the sandbags ready.

106
00:06:56,341 --> 00:06:57,427
Speaker 0: They're really loud.

107
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,414
Speaker 0: if we suddenly scream and go off the air Well, you will never hear it because we won't be alive to put the episode up.

108
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:05,550
Speaker 1: But oh geez I guess radio has an advantage.

109
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:06,072
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:06,837
Speaker 1: All right.

111
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:16,615
Speaker 0: No, yeah Now I it's possible that he might in fact drive to this place occasionally But I wouldn't be surprised if he just thought you know telecommutes most of the time.

112
00:07:16,635 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 1: I got a feeling.

113
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:21,740
Speaker 1: I mean it could also be a situation like this one lady who works in my company.

114
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:36,540
Speaker 1: she has a house in Florida a house in Rhode Island and a house in Tarrytown and Most of the time like during the week She's in the Tarrytown house because she'll go to New York City or she'll go to the office that I'm at Which aren't too far away from Tarrytown.

115
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:43,012
Speaker 1: But on the weekends, she goes to her Rhode Island house And then I guess she also goes to her Florida house sometime.

116
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,056
Speaker 0: See now, that's cool.

117
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:46,366
Speaker 0: Like if I had a What the hell?

118
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:49,420
Speaker 1: I don't know but it was a contest for longest commute.

119
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:56,309
Speaker 1: I would say I live in Rhode Island and my office is in New York City, haha No, they apparently did some sort of checking.

120
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:06,740
Speaker 0: they had to verify and they had all sorts of crap about it Mm-hmm, but in general I've discovered that Americans commute longer than any other nationality.

121
00:08:07,562 --> 00:08:08,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

122
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:10,040
Speaker 1: It's because we have a lot more land to traverse.

123
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,720
Speaker 0: It's not just that New Yorkers have the longest average commute of anyone.

124
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:22,540
Speaker 1: Well because you look at the state of New York and most of the people are working Closer to the city and most of the people live farther away from it.

125
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:27,778
Speaker 0: So well, actually almost half the people live in the city and half the people live everywhere else combined.

126
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,219
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but that's but more than half the people work in the city.

127
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:38,020
Speaker 0: The problem is just that Americans in general seem to have this aversion to living near any sort of industry at all.

128
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:46,833
Speaker 0: So as a result, we've got these like suburban communities surrounding places where actual work is done And you can't actually live somewhere where there's a job.

129
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:50,200
Speaker 1: I Would love to live closer to my job.

130
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,609
Speaker 1: The problem is I don't want to live in a shithole.

131
00:08:52,951 --> 00:09:00,493
Speaker 1: if there was a nice place to live near the job Other people seem to not want to live or maybe no one just want.

132
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:05,719
Speaker 1: no one thinks anyone wants to live near the job So they don't build a nice place there because then no one will live in it.

133
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:15,683
Speaker 0: The other problem is that jobs require people from all sorts of different places Mm-hmm, and those people might not all want to end up living together or for whatever reason don't want to live there or there aren't enough people.

134
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:25,974
Speaker 0: like a place where you'll find a job somewhere and There's a company that hires say a thousand people But you couldn't sustain all thousand people living in that area.

135
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:32,244
Speaker 0: like there aren't enough services or anything Nope, so those communities just don't appear and everyone has to commute Mm-hmm.

136
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,440
Speaker 0: I mean honestly, I've been poking around for jobs for the last several months.

137
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:41,218
Speaker 0: I have not found a single job worth taking that is not in New York City.

138
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,047
Speaker 0: at this point I have not found a single one not one.

139
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:49,627
Speaker 0: the closest job that isn't in New York City is in Yonkers Which is basically in New York City.

140
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:50,069
Speaker 1: Yep.

141
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:55,691
Speaker 1: It's just like this little weird Sort of crazy city thing above New York.

142
00:09:55,872 --> 00:09:56,635
Speaker 1: That's kind of weird.

143
00:09:57,277 --> 00:09:57,497
Speaker 0: Actually.

144
00:09:57,518 --> 00:09:58,260
Speaker 0: It's a really nice place.

145
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,905
Speaker 0: I've never been down.

146
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it has all sorts of weird laws that apply to it.

147
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,174
Speaker 0: Yeah, God, I'll have to pay point five percent commuter tax if I work there.

148
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:06,819
Speaker 1: It's a really strange thing.

149
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,144
Speaker 1: Yonkers is.

150
00:10:08,244 --> 00:10:11,835
Speaker 0: yeah to the people who decided how Yonkers taxes work.

151
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,180
Speaker 0: You can die in a fire.

152
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:14,309
Speaker 1: It's not just taxes.

153
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:15,680
Speaker 1: There are other weird things about you.

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,403
Speaker 0: I don't care about the rest of it cuz I would never live there, but I don't think it just even being there is weird I don't know.

155
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:23,113
Speaker 1: It's just an okay place.

156
00:10:23,153 --> 00:10:24,340
Speaker 0: Their taxes are weird.

157
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,543
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, but people just really the worst thing is most people who commute in this country commute by car Meaning.

158
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:33,334
Speaker 0: they can't do anything else with that time.

159
00:10:33,374 --> 00:10:34,279
Speaker 0: that time is lost.

160
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:39,780
Speaker 1: You can listen to things on the radio or a podcast like this one or something, but that's about it.

161
00:10:39,941 --> 00:10:41,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, that amazes me.

162
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,680
Speaker 0: I mean if I have a commute like that, I'm taking a train or something so I can do something with my time.

163
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to take the train but now there's no train that goes where I go.

164
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:52,152
Speaker 0: Oh, there'll be a train that goes close if the MTA has its way.

165
00:10:52,734 --> 00:10:54,500
Speaker 0: It'll probably be finished in the next decade.

166
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,250
Speaker 1: Maybe it's not really good enough.

167
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:56,954
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

168
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 0: it'll take you to Danbury.

169
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:01,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, then how do I get from Danbury to where I work which is like a half hour?

170
00:11:02,421 --> 00:11:06,179
Speaker 0: Oh, well, obviously you buy in a car and you keep it parked at the train station there.

171
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:09,771
Speaker 1: How do I get from here to the train station?

172
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:10,875
Speaker 1: It's no good.

173
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:11,898
Speaker 1: I'll need two cars.

174
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:15,668
Speaker 0: I can't do that Though it looks like I'll be commuting on the train to Yonkers.

175
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:16,450
Speaker 0: great.

176
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,076
Speaker 0: This job is really cool-looking, but that's all beside the point.

177
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:31,140
Speaker 0: I don't know what the point is other than I really Think people commute far too much in this country And I think that things need to be done about that or at least to make commuting less detrimental to life.

178
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:36,560
Speaker 1: One day I'll get a job or that's close to my house or a house close to a job or something.

179
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,198
Speaker 1: I'll be all set.

180
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:43,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just seems that so many people like put their job before all else or like they live their life around their job.

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,985
Speaker 1: Well, cuz they don't have anything else.

182
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:52,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the people only geeks have something else the people where I work now currently It's like most of them have absolutely no Actual life outside of their job.

183
00:11:52,887 --> 00:12:01,342
Speaker 1: like they come to work and they're like at least I'm not home with my wife Or maybe they actually have a family but then all they've got is job family But they don't.

184
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,830
Speaker 1: the family doesn't do things besides.

185
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:07,060
Speaker 1: generic American family watch TV crap.

186
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:14,228
Speaker 0: well, I guess the worst thing is that most of them seem to really not like their spouses and It seems like it's not kosher to ask them.

187
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,920
Speaker 0: Well, why did you marry them or why are you still married?

188
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,321
Speaker 1: That's weird.

189
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:27,629
Speaker 1: I mean like all that kind of stuff is like foreign to me cuz like, you know sure sometimes my dad will be like Don't let your mother know or don't tell your mother.

190
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's part of it ever like damn wife.

191
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,847
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I don't have that action.

192
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,091
Speaker 1: So it's all weird.

193
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,134
Speaker 1: I don't know people like that.

194
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:36,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, you should read the internet.

195
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:41,340
Speaker 0: I mean more than I think they're at this point is like 60% of all marriages end in divorce.

196
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:48,080
Speaker 1: It's also weird like all my aunts and uncles and you know, what are my parents friends all these married people?

197
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,196
Speaker 1: They don't seem to be no one's like that.

198
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,529
Speaker 1: They're all Married stay married kind of happy people.

199
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:55,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, relatively speaking.

200
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:59,652
Speaker 0: Some of them are better than others But maybe just all the people I work with maybe they're all just bitter old engineers.

201
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:01,980
Speaker 1: Maybe that's how IBM does it to them.

202
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:02,945
Speaker 0: I don't know.

203
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:05,440
Speaker 0: I don't know if I. it's a complicated thing.

204
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,344
Speaker 0: I could do a whole episode.

205
00:13:06,404 --> 00:13:07,007
Speaker 0: I'm very surprised.

206
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:11,657
Speaker 1: some subliminal IVM things like hate your spouse hate your spouse.

207
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,600
Speaker 1: IVM is better.

208
00:13:13,881 --> 00:13:24,460
Speaker 0: The worst thing about it is that they always say things like one who's getting married and he's spending, you know Obscene stupid amounts of money on the marriage and I was like I could run an awesome wedding for like two gray.

209
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:26,606
Speaker 0: And he was like are you kid?

210
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:27,570
Speaker 0: You don't know anything.

211
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:33,556
Speaker 0: You'll get married and have a family and blah blah blah blah blah Like everyone's always like yes, you'll get married and then you'll be miserable.

212
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:38,180
Speaker 0: Hahaha It's like they can't imagine that people could actually have a real relationship.

213
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like people saying uh, you'll go to college and then you'll see well, what if I don't go to college?

214
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,269
Speaker 0: Or it'll be a conservative when you grow up and you realize how things work.

215
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:52,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get that a lot really.

216
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:53,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do.

217
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:57,396
Speaker 0: It's like people like you're only liberal because you're young.

218
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:04,180
Speaker 1: Well, there is that old somewhat true saying that you know, if you're a socialist and you're 20 and all that.

219
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:05,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of true.

220
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,851
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda the problem is that I'm.

221
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:12,200
Speaker 0: I don't see my political views changing significantly over time.

222
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:15,715
Speaker 0: No, if anything I see them solidifying into a hateful mass.

223
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:16,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I see.

224
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,299
Speaker 1: Also, I guess people just seem to think that like laws of society or somehow also laws of the universe.

225
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:22,640
Speaker 1: Yep

226
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:39,760
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's more that people at least in terms of the specific thing on marriage and these people with their long commutes and their horrible jobs is that they're fairly miserable at least that's my opinion and They can't imagine that other people or they couldn't deal with the fact that other people actually aren't miserable or didn't make the same mistakes.

227
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,703
Speaker 0: They did so.

228
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:46,880
Speaker 0: they assume that everyone makes the same mistakes or everyone does the same stupid crap and then they feel okay about themselves.

229
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:50,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they all like commiserate about that.

230
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:55,439
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, my wife sucks Oh, my husband sucks and then they all get drunk and go out and whatever.

231
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,043
Speaker 0: hmm I'm ranting.

232
00:14:58,344 --> 00:14:59,910
Speaker 0: I'll have to do let's not be those people.

233
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:05,366
Speaker 1: Hey if anyone's out there and you're those people Call me.

234
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:09,879
Speaker 0: I Think it'd be really hard for us to become those people.

235
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:11,264
Speaker 1: Yeah would be.

236
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:17,132
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, I mean my life is generally awesome And if my life were ever not awesome I would do something about that.

237
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:22,660
Speaker 1: the only thing on Awesome about my life is the job and it seems that these people the job is the awesomest thing they've got.

238
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:28,479
Speaker 0: My job is just a means of putting money into my wallet which I think it can then spend on having fun with.

239
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 1: you know Friends me too, but on the same token I actually want a job that where there's something to the job and not just sitting there doing nothing all day.

240
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:39,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you know you lose time in the car.

241
00:15:39,332 --> 00:15:40,939
Speaker 1: I don't want to lose more time at the job.

242
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,807
Speaker 0: Well work on other projects.

243
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,594
Speaker 0: I am now just don't go to work.

244
00:15:44,855 --> 00:15:45,517
Speaker 1: I can't do that.

245
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:45,939
Speaker 0: Why not?

246
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,424
Speaker 1: They'll eventually find out.

247
00:15:47,484 --> 00:15:49,451
Speaker 0: so by then you'll have found a new job.

248
00:15:49,471 --> 00:15:50,977
Speaker 1: I haven't even looked yet.

249
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:51,820
Speaker 1: I probably should.

250
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,650
Speaker 1: I've actually gotten offers because people still have been sending me offers ever since I Graduated college and started looking for a job.

251
00:15:59,012 --> 00:16:07,339
Speaker 0: I've had like this stream of offers I will be trickles in all the time logged into my old RIT email account and there were like seven or eight job offers that I'd never.

252
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:15,254
Speaker 1: yeah I'm logged into my old CS email and there were job offers in there, and I was like oh Well these are sucky job offers at least all right.

253
00:16:15,294 --> 00:16:18,462
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do your Java Oracle whatnots.

254
00:16:18,784 --> 00:16:21,416
Speaker 0: yeah, if you were like yeah, you want to do some novell network for us.

255
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:28,180
Speaker 1: I'm like no Hey come and help us do our You know Microsoft visual whatnots.

256
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,112
Speaker 0: All right, we've gotten way off topic.

257
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:33,520
Speaker 0: I blame the explosions.

258
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,183
Speaker 1: So we think of the day explosions.

259
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:46,320
Speaker 0: Let's do the things of the day, and then let's do the anime all right.

260
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:47,287
Speaker 0: So things of the day.

261
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:51,778
Speaker 0: now that we're getting back on topic here Dare laugh dare ding.

262
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,167
Speaker 1: They're laughing their dinger.

263
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:55,513
Speaker 0: That's my thing of the day.

264
00:16:55,533 --> 00:16:56,437
Speaker 0: ding-ding-ding.

265
00:16:57,521 --> 00:17:08,200
Speaker 0: It's long and I'll say right now that there are obvious Incredibly obvious edits in it, which I'm not sure if we're done for time or for setup or what have you?

266
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,460
Speaker 1: I think some of them were done for time and some of them might have a tiny bit of cheating going on.

267
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,946
Speaker 1: But it doesn't matter cheating or no.

268
00:17:13,987 --> 00:17:16,176
Speaker 0: It's fairly impressive and fairly interesting.

269
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:27,108
Speaker 0: It's a Obviously German video of a massive and convoluted and very slow-moving Fire based Rube Goldberg machine.

270
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:39,980
Speaker 1: There's a lot of fire and a lot of fuses and a lot of liquid chemicals mixing to create fogs and mists and a few of the Mechanics they use multiple times which is boring.

271
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,175
Speaker 0: It's very neat though that is very slow and very in but very precise and more importantly.

272
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:49,743
Speaker 0: It's very very I guess crude looking Mm-hmm.

273
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,514
Speaker 0: It's really hard to just watch it.

274
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:52,460
Speaker 0: It's a half-hour long.

275
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,514
Speaker 0: You don't have to watch the whole thing and no it doesn't go anywhere.

276
00:17:54,816 --> 00:17:55,400
Speaker 0: It just stops.

277
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best part was the wheel.

278
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's one and not there a bunch of wheels that roll.

279
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:05,106
Speaker 1: There's one wheel that just keeps going one wheel that it's like Usually you have a wheel.

280
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:08,000
Speaker 1: it rolls it hits something and then you move away from the wheel.

281
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,108
Speaker 1: This is a wheel that moved.

282
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:13,480
Speaker 1: then then it did something to make it move more.

283
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:15,608
Speaker 1: Then it did something to make it move more.

284
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,520
Speaker 1: then it did something to make it move even more.

285
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it stops, and we're like all right now.

286
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:21,395
Speaker 0: It's just on fire.

287
00:18:21,456 --> 00:18:21,818
Speaker 0: What's cut?

288
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:22,260
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

289
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:24,017
Speaker 0: Are those rockets tied to the side of it?

290
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,905
Speaker 1: The Rockets go off and the wheel keeps going and then yeah That's the best part is.

291
00:18:29,126 --> 00:18:34,995
Speaker 1: so just try to skip to the wheel and once you've seen the wheel Everything after that is sort of more of the same.

292
00:18:35,196 --> 00:18:35,920
Speaker 0: It's fun though.

293
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:43,673
Speaker 0: I have one complaint that everyone who's linked to this and I found this this morning But people have been linking to it all day, and they're linking to the wrong thing.

294
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:45,620
Speaker 0: It's not death laugh dare ding.

295
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,237
Speaker 0: It's dare dare dare dare.

296
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:48,739
Speaker 0: Why did you think it ours an F?

297
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,395
Speaker 1: Probably one guy did a misspelling and everyone just copied with.

298
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,239
Speaker 1: that guy said yeah.

299
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:56,852
Speaker 0: So if you see anyone linking to this with an F. I Die in a fire.

300
00:18:56,872 --> 00:18:58,157
Speaker 1: yeah Oh my god.

301
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,843
Speaker 1: You can see how many freaking spelling errors getting the headlines on dig and proceed to get a bunch of digs There's.

302
00:19:03,963 --> 00:19:08,300
Speaker 1: there really needs to be a thing if you have a spelling error in your headline on dig you can't get digs.

303
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,000
Speaker 1: Judge me the rule.

304
00:19:11,422 --> 00:19:16,728
Speaker 1: Anyway my thing of the day You might have noticed that there's this video.

305
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:26,749
Speaker 1: That's real popular on the internet like it's crazy popular of this dude juggling three balls to the tune of Golden slumbers now.

306
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:28,740
Speaker 0: I thought it was fairly impressive when I saw it.

307
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,666
Speaker 1: I also thought it was impressive when I saw it now.

308
00:19:30,686 --> 00:19:34,980
Speaker 1: Let me submit background information is a comedian named Chris bliss.

309
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,491
Speaker 1: He's actually a pretty cool comedian.

310
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,560
Speaker 1: I never heard his comedy, so I don't know if it's funny.

311
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,844
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's funny to someone.

312
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:41,787
Speaker 1: he's because he's famous.

313
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:42,890
Speaker 0: He's a cool guy at least.

314
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:51,517
Speaker 1: yeah, he's doing this thing where he's trying to get Monuments of the Bill of Rights and all the state capitals and then in more places because he's all cool like that.

315
00:19:52,199 --> 00:20:05,469
Speaker 1: so definitely not a schmuck and in part of his show is juggling three balls to this Beatles song and It's if you don't know anything about juggling and you're just a normal schmuck like us.

316
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,242
Speaker 1: It's pretty impressive, and that's why the video has gone around the net now.

317
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:16,966
Speaker 1: There's a guy named Jason Garfield I think his name is and What happened was?

318
00:20:18,831 --> 00:20:19,174
Speaker 1: Penn.

319
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:20,790
Speaker 1: I heard on his you know Penn Gillette.

320
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,055
Speaker 1: I heard on his radio show.

321
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:29,228
Speaker 1: according to him he saw the video of the guy juggling three balls and told this guy Jason Garfield to do it with five.

322
00:20:29,248 --> 00:20:34,545
Speaker 1: and Because they they're jugglers, and they know that juggling three balls wasn't so great.

323
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,530
Speaker 1: and You know to us it looked great, but to people who knew stuff about juggling it was crap.

324
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:56,634
Speaker 1: So there's another video called dis bliss which takes the audio From the very popular video like right out of the video with the audience and everything and it shows this guy juggling five balls to the same song and everything and it's Much better.

325
00:20:56,975 --> 00:21:04,829
Speaker 0: the best part is the very end of the video when he's like try with ten there And he juggles ten balls normally for like a second, and then you're like oh shit.

326
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:18,830
Speaker 0: But yeah, I guess it's just an illustration of the fact that Things can become very popular on the internet if people don't know a lot about the skill or the background of whatever happened.

327
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that these two videos combined illustrate a lot of things.

328
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:31,331
Speaker 1: Primarily they illustrate that it's real easy to fool and amaze people who don't know anything Well.

329
00:21:31,372 --> 00:21:35,250
Speaker 0: like look at when we used when we go to Wildwood and dance on the DDR machines.

330
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:41,410
Speaker 0: They're years and years ago when DDR still wasn't really well known outside of you know geek centers and cities.

331
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:50,670
Speaker 0: so there'd be a DDR machine on the boardwalk in New Jersey and Like people like no one knew what it was like there'd be one kid like trying to play the game and failing there'd be a crowd.

332
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:58,319
Speaker 0: So Scott and I would get up on the machine and do our normal thing because we're actually both of us really really good At DDR dance dance revolution.

333
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,969
Speaker 0: if you don't know we need to show about DDR.

334
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:01,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do.

335
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,650
Speaker 0: so we start we dance.

336
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:16,486
Speaker 0: You know our crazy awesome dances, and the crowd is like yelling and screaming like whoa whoa my god Those guys are awesome, and it was just DDR and we're good But we're not as good as some of those crazy people out there like DJ 8-ball.

337
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:17,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, not even close.

338
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:19,947
Speaker 1: They saw that they would just like pee their pants.

339
00:22:20,008 --> 00:22:25,850
Speaker 0: yeah But because they didn't know they they thought what we were doing was crazy, and there are a lot of people out there.

340
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:50,980
Speaker 1: I know some of them who will Get mediocre or slightly above-average skills at a wide variety of things But not have insane skills at anything and then they will shock and amaze completely normal doofuses with their slightly above-average skills as The three ball guy is doing when the people with the real skills of five balling are Not noticed maybe because they're rarer

341
00:22:51,741 --> 00:22:51,982
Speaker 0: Yep,

342
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:56,960
Speaker 1: you know, but I'm sure if the five ball people come out of the woodwork, then you know they'll also shock and amaze.

343
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,863
Speaker 0: Well, there's also the point that until recently the internet was the realm mostly of geeks or people who are good at internetting Or good at computers.

344
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:13,150
Speaker 0: so whenever a non computer awesome thing would appear on the internet the people who generally Propagate or promote those sorts of things would go whoo.

345
00:23:13,732 --> 00:23:19,230
Speaker 0: and the people who are actually good at those things Don't really know or care about internet memes and cliches, and they have no idea.

346
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,454
Speaker 0: What's floating around out there.

347
00:23:20,614 --> 00:23:34,528
Speaker 0: They got no clue, but now as Cool people or internet types or geeks are getting older and doing things other than just their you know computer geekery They're noticing that hey There's this internet And I can be on it too.

348
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:40,879
Speaker 0: so now you have the guy who can juggle the crazy number of balls And he sees the people juggling three balls and goes huh, I can beat that.

349
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:54,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that Overall this is a really good Two videos to compare and contrast and many times compare and contrast like in middle school Yeah, and many times in the future.

350
00:23:55,095 --> 00:24:00,215
Speaker 1: I see myself You know in discussion saying this is just like those two juggling videos.

351
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,206
Speaker 0: Here's why black I'll admit that that is.

352
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:09,458
Speaker 0: this is an effect that I've often used to my advantage because I'm a Modern a mediocre at best piano player.

353
00:24:09,478 --> 00:24:23,432
Speaker 0: I'm alright I can just doodle around But when I'm an anime conventions And I sit down in front of piano And I know like two or three anime songs that I can just bust out and it looks like I know what I'm doing So I'll just sit down and you know doodle a bit, and I'll play like the utenna theme.

354
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:30,219
Speaker 0: people go whoo wow and then I'm very careful to like walk away from the piano before anyone tries to get me to play anything else.

355
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's more to it, but let's go Alright, so today.

356
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:42,280
Speaker 0: We're going to talk about two fairly terrible anime.

357
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:45,270
Speaker 1: They're not that terrible now.

358
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:45,752
Speaker 0: They're not.

359
00:24:45,793 --> 00:24:49,567
Speaker 1: they're not as terrible as What was the terrible show?

360
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:52,300
Speaker 0: well the one with the harem or the one with the harem both?

361
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,111
Speaker 0: How about the one with the boobs in the harem?

362
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,320
Speaker 1: that one yeah?

363
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,965
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean they're.

364
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:58,473
Speaker 0: these aren't that bad.

365
00:24:58,513 --> 00:24:59,820
Speaker 0: They're not like horrible.

366
00:24:59,941 --> 00:25:04,759
Speaker 0: They're not the kind of show that we would just turn off because we can't deal with it But they're the kind of show we won't watch anymore.

367
00:25:05,107 --> 00:25:05,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might.

368
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,109
Speaker 0: Basically, it's still at the line where you might want to watch one episode at least to know what we're talking about Especially if it's your kind of thing.

369
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,760
Speaker 1: I mean one of these shows might be up your alley.

370
00:25:13,961 --> 00:25:19,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we'll tell you when a show is not worth watching at all to anyone and these shows are just above that line.

371
00:25:20,222 --> 00:25:22,711
Speaker 1: Alright, so the first show is zega pain.

372
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,156
Speaker 0: Yeah emphasis on the pain.

373
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:25,000
Speaker 0: the show's not good.

374
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,251
Speaker 1: No, it really didn't grab me.

375
00:25:27,331 --> 00:25:32,147
Speaker 1: I mean at first I thought the show had promise because It was somewhat serious.

376
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:34,095
Speaker 0: what you thought the show had promised?

377
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:39,400
Speaker 0: the screen the screen Capture that was put in the icon on the desktop was a giant robot face.

378
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:47,067
Speaker 1: And you thought the show because I read the synopsis of the show online and it had something to do with robots and fairly serious Sci-fi something.

379
00:25:47,892 --> 00:25:54,460
Speaker 0: it's like a matrix But you don't know who's where and a boy with a giant robot and a little bit of gratuitous boobage.

380
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:57,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, the gratuitous boobage was unnecessary alright.

381
00:25:57,295 --> 00:25:58,180
Speaker 1: Let's explain this show.

382
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,980
Speaker 1: So this is kid, and he doesn't seem to be too popular at school.

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,342
Speaker 1: Oh wait.

384
00:26:02,383 --> 00:26:04,960
Speaker 0: No the show starts with that weird sci-fi robot battle.

385
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:08,932
Speaker 1: Okay, sure the show starts with a sci-fi robot battle in space.

386
00:26:09,053 --> 00:26:17,764
Speaker 1: one of the end like one guy is half Disintegrating and this girl dies and then a robot explodes, and it's bigger than any nuke I've ever seen.

387
00:26:18,045 --> 00:26:19,290
Speaker 0: it's hard to tell what's going on.

388
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,440
Speaker 1: It's it's sort of like the cryptic.

389
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,405
Speaker 1: Either what?

390
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:27,140
Speaker 1: what happened in the past a long time ago, or what's going to happen in the future?

391
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:32,356
Speaker 1: Sort of you'll find out about this later, but that's the real plot clip.

392
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:33,720
Speaker 1: you know one of those?

393
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, then it cuts to generic high school show generic high school show.

394
00:26:37,174 --> 00:26:38,700
Speaker 1: this guy doesn't seem to be too popular.

395
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:40,379
Speaker 1: He does some annoying things.

396
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:50,099
Speaker 1: You know doesn't have a lot of friends, but he has like a you know one friend Who's a girl who's I guess been the childhood friend typical and this other you know kind of?

397
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:54,237
Speaker 1: Mickey kind of guy like Mickey from Wootena.

398
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:56,968
Speaker 0: yep Yeah, there's been a lot of characters like that lately.

399
00:26:57,028 --> 00:27:02,256
Speaker 0: the doctor in ergo proxy really gives me that feel to kinda a little bit.

400
00:27:03,361 --> 00:27:07,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, this is one guy like that, and they're shooting a video for something.

401
00:27:08,681 --> 00:27:13,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really matter, but it gets to the point where he sees a girl like dive off the high dive.

402
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:22,740
Speaker 1: He's a girl standing on the high dive from across the school, and he runs over there because apparently He's the captain of the swim team and also the only member of the swim team.

403
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,990
Speaker 1: So if he sees someone going in the pool.

404
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,331
Speaker 1: He's like.

405
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:26,155
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

406
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:27,300
Speaker 1: Are you ready to join the swim team?

407
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:35,251
Speaker 0: Now at this point I'd like to say that I really don't get why they've made the pool like this Focal point of all the whatever that's going on.

408
00:27:35,753 --> 00:27:39,005
Speaker 1: I don't know either if there's a metaphor Associating with the pool.

409
00:27:39,025 --> 00:27:42,660
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is, and I'll also say this yeah an underwater kiss is hot.

410
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,286
Speaker 0: That's a really cool thing.

411
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:46,394
Speaker 0: you can't hold your breath that long.

412
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:47,699
Speaker 0: Oh my god anyway.

413
00:27:49,862 --> 00:27:54,038
Speaker 1: So this girl standing on the high dive apparently I'm gonna ruin the whole first episode.

414
00:27:54,078 --> 00:27:55,123
Speaker 0: watch out It's fine.

415
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:57,453
Speaker 0: his show's not worth having not ruined.

416
00:27:57,473 --> 00:28:03,774
Speaker 1: This girl standing on the high dive Isn't real like no one else saw her and when she tried to talk to him.

417
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,760
Speaker 1: He couldn't hear what she was saying.

418
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,502
Speaker 1: so That's that.

419
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:10,608
Speaker 0: yeah other plot happens.

420
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,832
Speaker 0: It's really mother crap.

421
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,256
Speaker 1: No one can see whatever.

Speaker 1: She takes him to another world brings him in a giant robot.

424
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:25,099
Speaker 1: they team up in a giant robot They fight other things and they win.

425
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:28,620
Speaker 0: It's all very quantum like everything's holograms like it's a game.

426
00:28:28,901 --> 00:28:30,889
Speaker 0: And he asks like is this a virtual world?

427
00:28:30,969 --> 00:28:33,680
Speaker 0: and she says a typical anime cryptic answer of no.

428
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,604
Speaker 1: He's like where are we?

429
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:38,000
Speaker 1: and she's like pretend you're playing the latest VR game or something.

430
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,211
Speaker 0: Oh, he asked something like it's again cuz she says the words.

431
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:41,799
Speaker 0: you can think of it that way for now.

432
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:43,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

433
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:50,510
Speaker 1: so it's either some sort of parallel dimension or Quantum leap space some crazy bad shit.

434
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,580
Speaker 0: This is not like the freakin negative whatever with captain Marvell.

435
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:58,659
Speaker 1: yeah, anyway, the robot is called the zaga pain.

436
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,754
Speaker 0: and Yeah, we really figure out what's going on.

437
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:04,060
Speaker 1: It's pretty invincible.

438
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:08,479
Speaker 0: But the show's gotten me enough to where I want to know what the plot is.

439
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:11,094
Speaker 0: It's it pulled a fancy lala the show.

440
00:29:11,134 --> 00:29:11,879
Speaker 0: I don't care about.

441
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,046
Speaker 0: Dinosaurs I'm curious about.

442
00:29:14,066 --> 00:29:17,840
Speaker 0: you know like now I got to find out what's up with the dinosaurs zaga pain.

443
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:20,209
Speaker 1: I don't really care about the show or at all.

444
00:29:20,369 --> 00:29:21,995
Speaker 1: the characters mostly all suck.

445
00:29:22,376 --> 00:29:25,699
Speaker 1: the robot looks cool I guess but I just want to know what the hell.

446
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,892
Speaker 1: What's their explanation for this parallel world?

447
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:30,480
Speaker 0: the robot is kind of generic though?

448
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,740
Speaker 0: It reminds me of the fighting from like candidate for goddess.

449
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:38,560
Speaker 0: It reminds me of kind of like crap CG cell shaded weekly.

450
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:44,679
Speaker 1: I don't care about what it looks like like how it's animated, but it reminds me of like zone of the enders type of stuff.

451
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,710
Speaker 1: Whatever, it's a robot it shoots thing.

452
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of the world's is as a blazing sword.

453
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:54,019
Speaker 0: There's some sort of fake world or something.

454
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:55,522
Speaker 0: It's like.

455
00:29:55,542 --> 00:30:03,278
Speaker 0: they took a generic robot show that had nothing going with it and added just a little bit of weird sci-fi Mystery something to make it more like Ava and Raza.

456
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:14,879
Speaker 1: fine Yeah, and then at the end of the show like he's teleported back to the normal world in the swimming pool And he kisses the girl underwater underwater, and that's the end of the episode.

457
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,430
Speaker 0: It's really all we can say about that show.

458
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:29,216
Speaker 0: Yeah, tell you what happened in it because they're real that's it unless you want to be roped into either watching us crappy show or Scouring the internet to find out what's going on in the show from synopses.

459
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:29,940
Speaker 0: Don't watch it.

460
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:42,077
Speaker 1: I recommend if my recommendation for the show is that you find a picture of the robot to see what it looks like and Then find a synopsis on the internet to find out what the deal is with this alternate world, and that's the end of it.

461
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:51,027
Speaker 0: Yeah All right the other show we watched is Possibly it's one of the most painful non harem shows.

462
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,190
Speaker 0: I've seen in a long time.

463
00:30:53,922 --> 00:30:55,130
Speaker 1: All right, it's um.

464
00:30:55,292 --> 00:31:01,471
Speaker 1: It's in the initial D Genre Also known as the Hikaru no go John Prince of tennis.

465
00:31:01,672 --> 00:31:05,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, where there's some sort of special interest You know whether it.

466
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:06,251
Speaker 1: well.

467
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,460
Speaker 1: It's actually slightly different.

468
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,400
Speaker 1: It's more than the yugioh genre because it's a fake special and yeah because initial D at least it's a show about cars.

469
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,624
Speaker 0: So it's a real thing.

470
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:18,859
Speaker 0: and then they talk about cars in a somewhat yugioh, or what was that other one dragon drive?

471
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,079
Speaker 1: I think yeah.

472
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:26,400
Speaker 1: It's where they make something up to be interested in and then they make up how to be good at it and all that stuff.

473
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:34,797
Speaker 0: So that so basically it's it's in my opinion a generally stupid genre to begin with because in this case It's not like cars and initial D or go where it like.

474
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:35,260
Speaker 0: you know it.

475
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,750
Speaker 0: It's a real thing so you can just make up plot around it.

476
00:31:38,332 --> 00:31:39,236
Speaker 1: What was the moshang one?

477
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:39,819
Speaker 0: Oh?

478
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:42,347
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah instead.

479
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:47,365
Speaker 0: They make up a thing and then whenever they need a crazy Plot device they make it up.

480
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:52,140
Speaker 0: They make a thing up like oh he did a double black blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

481
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:53,332
Speaker 0: That's crazy.

482
00:31:53,352 --> 00:31:57,318
Speaker 0: Oh well He did it with his super blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

483
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,790
Speaker 1: yep They just make shit up.

484
00:31:58,811 --> 00:31:59,760
Speaker 1: cuz what they made it up.

485
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:05,721
Speaker 1: It's like if you make up a sport And then you make up a show about your made-up sport And then you make up the rules in your made-up sport And then

486
00:32:05,741 --> 00:32:06,785
Speaker 0: you make up why every

487
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:10,638
Speaker 1: episode you can just come up with some crazy technique or some crazy situation.

488
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:15,491
Speaker 1: because well You're making all the rules I mean silly while initial D is silly and breaks a lot of rules.

489
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:17,598
Speaker 0: at least it's grounded a little bit in reality.

490
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:22,994
Speaker 0: like you Can kind of drift a car like that and you can kind of do the things he does to it.

491
00:32:23,154 --> 00:32:26,407
Speaker 0: somewhat possible degree somewhat Yeah, somewhat the car.

492
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:30,245
Speaker 1: No goes really at least the car No go I've seen is really grounded.

493
00:32:30,265 --> 00:32:31,911
Speaker 1: You know you play go you can play go.

494
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can play go.

495
00:32:33,596 --> 00:32:40,743
Speaker 1: not well, but But air gear is Something else.

496
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:44,900
Speaker 0: so first of all they made up this thing which is basically rollerblading.

497
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:47,790
Speaker 0: But the rollerblades have like nukes in him or somethings.

498
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,118
Speaker 0: they have this power plant and they can roll you around.

499
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:51,403
Speaker 1: all right wait Slap right here.

500
00:32:51,805 --> 00:32:54,295
Speaker 1: didn't I come up with the idea of rollerblades having motors.

501
00:32:54,536 --> 00:32:55,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then wait wait.

502
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,362
Speaker 1: What did you say?

503
00:32:56,382 --> 00:32:59,953
Speaker 0: I said that that is silly dangerous stupid and horrifying.

504
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:01,297
Speaker 0: and why is it?

505
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:02,280
Speaker 0: well the main reason?

506
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,283
Speaker 0: To not get in front of.

507
00:33:03,323 --> 00:33:04,347
Speaker 0: you haven't rollerbladed.

508
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,396
Speaker 0: when you rollerblade or ice skate.

509
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:13,077
Speaker 0: They're very similar You push so the motive force comes from your leg, and you push out.

510
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:17,460
Speaker 0: you're pushing down You're propelling yourself forward and the wheels are just there to reduce friction when you're gliding.

511
00:33:18,762 --> 00:33:27,615
Speaker 0: If a rollerblade was rolling for you now the motive force is a pulling force Coming from the rollerblade and you would basically just fall over and die.

512
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:37,617
Speaker 0: it is almost impossible to do what this show wants to do in the first place all right so without some sort of magic or Technology that we don't have yet.

513
00:33:38,442 --> 00:33:43,219
Speaker 1: So continue talking about what happens in the first episode of Erica because I'm not all too sure.

514
00:33:43,459 --> 00:33:44,182
Speaker 0: yeah Well, they made up.

515
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,327
Speaker 0: first of all they make up this thing.

516
00:33:45,367 --> 00:33:50,129
Speaker 0: so air gear our rollerblades with like fuel cells or something in Them and they have motors, and you can move them.

517
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:51,800
Speaker 0: apparently you can also fly.

518
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,460
Speaker 0: Really the characters are flying like literally flying leaping from like rooftop to rooftop spinning around in the air.

519
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,444
Speaker 1: You look like they're flying.

520
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:09,677
Speaker 1: it look like they're just making really big jumps because the rollerblades Let them go so fast and they get on a roof, and then they just aren't ignoring the physics of that.

521
00:34:10,098 --> 00:34:11,722
Speaker 0: It's just They.

522
00:34:11,803 --> 00:34:12,626
Speaker 0: they jump too far.

523
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,389
Speaker 0: They're effectively fly.

524
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,172
Speaker 0: It's like Superman.

525
00:34:14,455 --> 00:34:22,525
Speaker 0: He can leap tall buildings yep, and then they made up this whole subculture around these things and Complete with like these rituals.

526
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:27,501
Speaker 0: like the main plot point one is that he finds the air gear that is the people he's living with Have.

527
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:30,295
Speaker 0: he steals him when he wears them, and he's kind of good at it.

528
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:46,100
Speaker 0: He might be one of those prodigies - they make up this whole gang culture around these things and then they make up this thing where like if you Slap your sticker for your gang on top of the sticker for someone else's gang.

529
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:49,780
Speaker 0: It's a challenge, and he accidentally does that and challenges someone.

530
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then the challenge is just this other stupid thing and the show just goes nowhere fast.

531
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:11,317
Speaker 1: yeah, basically the guy is to race and The really only redeeming part of the show that I found was the fact that he lives With these four girls who are kind of you know, it's it's it's not a harem so to speak.

532
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:12,260
Speaker 0: yeah, they'll hate him.

533
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be a harem, but it's not.

534
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:14,629
Speaker 1: oh wait.

535
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:16,054
Speaker 0: There's that one girl who likes him.

536
00:35:16,275 --> 00:35:17,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a half harem.

537
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:25,250
Speaker 1: It's a half harem, but it has that funny element of you know a guy living with Four girls who are humorous in different ways.

538
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:38,743
Speaker 1: they remind me a lot of the neighbors from yotsuba You know because you had the older girl who like you don't want to get dangerous with her because she'll kick your ass the really little girl who's just like cynical and Worldly.

539
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:45,549
Speaker 1: yeah, it seemed like that you know which is kind of kind of funny because they have rollerblade skills I guess or air gear skills.

540
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,966
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're they're members of Sleeping forest.

541
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:54,499
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, I don't know why I remember that The show is just bad.

542
00:35:55,745 --> 00:36:01,595
Speaker 1: if you really like No rollerblades you won't like this show because it has nothing to do with roll.

543
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:02,660
Speaker 0: you like this show.

544
00:36:02,781 --> 00:36:03,757
Speaker 0: I got nothing to say to you.

545
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:17,020
Speaker 1: you know who might like this show are the people who like all like the normal fighting shows like bleach and Naruto, but You know like those you have to be able to like those shows so much that you'll like a bad one of those shows.

546
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:20,092
Speaker 0: Well bleach at least seems to have good characters.

547
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:21,196
Speaker 0: It may not have anything.

548
00:36:21,357 --> 00:36:21,798
Speaker 1: It's true.

549
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:23,974
Speaker 0: It's true It's got good characters and good art.

550
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:30,740
Speaker 1: this show I think the only person you could say is a good character was the Probably the second oldest sister the one that was all crazy evil.

551
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:33,933
Speaker 1: I was like getting mad at him and yelling at him right away.

552
00:36:34,475 --> 00:36:35,660
Speaker 1: all the other characters are boring.

553
00:36:36,503 --> 00:36:39,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I the show is just bad bad bad bad.

554
00:36:40,723 --> 00:36:49,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the youngest sister has a good Look to her, but she's not interesting character and the main character is just generic anime, dude.

555
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:52,432
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's like pathetically generic.

556
00:36:52,873 --> 00:36:53,396
Speaker 1: Oh god.

557
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:56,498
Speaker 1: He's just like Painfully generic.

558
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:02,310
Speaker 1: alright, so air gear if you actually recommend you're gonna what.

559
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:12,066
Speaker 1: you should watch the first episode if you don't have anything better to do because You'll I don't know You'll get something out of it.

560
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:13,513
Speaker 0: Don't watch this show alone.

561
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:14,597
Speaker 0: It'll break your brain.

562
00:37:14,637 --> 00:37:15,220
Speaker 0: It's stupid.

563
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,010
Speaker 0: Watch it with a bunch of people so you can all yell at it.

564
00:37:18,312 --> 00:37:32,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not funny because it's funny But it's so terrible that You don't laugh at the terrible things in it as you do in like a zombie movie or something But you laugh at how shitty the show is in itself.

565
00:37:33,282 --> 00:37:42,011
Speaker 0: I mean we were watching got to the point where Katsu was yelling about the fact that they were jumping from rooftop to rooftop and breaking Those roof shingles in Japan which apparently are really expensive and hard to replace.

566
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:45,000
Speaker 0: yeah, and Katsu was like wow that sucks that bastard.

567
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:50,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there is a there's a little bit of gratuitous Boobage, but not too much.

568
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, not too much though.

569
00:37:52,195 --> 00:37:52,980
Speaker 1: They got pain had more.

570
00:37:54,182 --> 00:37:55,269
Speaker 1: I don't know a little bit more.

571
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:56,919
Speaker 0: I think this show had a little bit more.

572
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,250
Speaker 1: I don't really remember too much of it in this show.

573
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:04,333
Speaker 1: all I remember is when he you know the usual Crash land on top of some some girl.

574
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:05,540
Speaker 0: Why does that happen?

575
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,807
Speaker 0: Why is it in every show that's stupid?

576
00:38:08,108 --> 00:38:11,920
Speaker 0: the guy like bumps into the girl and then he pieces faces laying in her breasts.

577
00:38:12,242 --> 00:38:13,656
Speaker 1: It's a Japanese teen fantasy.

578
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:15,526
Speaker 1: It must be.

579
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,680
Speaker 0: I had better fantasies than that when I was a teenager.

580
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,342
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what.

581
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,589
Speaker 1: yeah, my fantasies went a lot farther than that.

582
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:29,534
Speaker 0: It wasn't my fantasies weren't non-concessual All right, so that's all we really have to say about these two shows.

583
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,257
Speaker 0: They're both bad.

584
00:38:30,337 --> 00:38:30,920
Speaker 0: don't watch him.

585
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:34,333
Speaker 1: We got a whole crap ton of anime in our hopper.

586
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:38,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think you can understand How many episode ones we have to go through now?

587
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:50,602
Speaker 1: I think like this past week or so has been like I don't know what to say Like it must be like the harvest like all the anime is now fully grown and I'm going through the fields with the giant Like.

588
00:38:50,964 --> 00:38:51,405
