1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,346
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Monday July 27th.

2
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:12,488
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,693
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:17,420
Speaker 1: privacy security SSL and private keys.

5
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:26,604
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:31,396
Speaker 0: You know what?

7
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:34,530
Speaker 0: what Scott was warm today?

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,283
Speaker 1: about froze.

9
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:40,542
Speaker 0: mom Actually was warmer yesterday.

10
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:51,621
Speaker 0: Yes, it was so warm about melted my Today slightly less warm Still you know is the words today like work was just blah.

11
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:52,704
Speaker 0: everything sucked right.

12
00:00:52,784 --> 00:00:54,790
Speaker 1: sudden random thunderstorm around lunchtime.

13
00:00:55,098 --> 00:01:01,110
Speaker 0: No, no I like actually that part lunch was cool because they felt sorry for us at work being all Blair.

14
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:05,163
Speaker 0: So someone went out and got us some lunch with company monies, and they got me some.

15
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,874
Speaker 0: pancake is very nice pancake Yeah, lunch.

16
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:08,781
Speaker 1: Yeah, huh?

17
00:01:09,043 --> 00:01:13,388
Speaker 0: Yeah it were really good pancakes - came with butter and syrup and everything.

18
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:18,766
Speaker 0: but No, and then you know I left work at 6 instead of a 5.

19
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,710
Speaker 0: I walk outside.

20
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,629
Speaker 0: I didn't think it was gonna rain today.

21
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:27,110
Speaker 0: Right it was warm And it started drizzling a bit when I walked out the door and I didn't have an umbrella or a hood.

22
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,946
Speaker 0: Usually I have one of the other you know and as long as I had the umbrella.

23
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,644
Speaker 0: I'm totally cool But if I have the hoodie it's like a but I'm least I'm alright.

24
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:35,934
Speaker 1: that didn't run in any rain But I was basically.

25
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:38,725
Speaker 0: the office is immediately started raining, and then it rained harder and harder.

26
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:41,639
Speaker 0: as I walk towards the train I was just like fuck man.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,222
Speaker 1: I was already.

28
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:43,549
Speaker 0: they work late, and then you rain on me.

29
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:44,983
Speaker 1: I was already like home by then.

30
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:45,609
Speaker 1: there was no rain.

31
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:46,473
Speaker 0: I know right.

32
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:49,144
Speaker 1: the funny thing is that crazy thunderstorm rolled through the city right.

33
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:50,610
Speaker 1: so I have my phone out.

34
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,190
Speaker 1: Everyone's looking out the window cuz the lightning like struck near our buildings or super loud.

35
00:01:55,071 --> 00:02:02,008
Speaker 1: So I look on like the weather radar And there's basically this tiny dot of red over New York City and nothing anywhere else.

36
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,389
Speaker 0: yep Alright, I guess that's it for today's BS.

37
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:13,783
Speaker 1: But you know for anyone who is wondering what's going on here You know you might have seen us at Otacon where he did some amazing panels.

38
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,490
Speaker 1: geek nights is four nights a week.

39
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,559
Speaker 1: This is Monday night Which is science and tech and neck beards and links and all that stuff.

40
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,757
Speaker 1: so if you're looking for our coverage of Otacon or our Upcoming coverage of Kinetic on or upcoming coverage of packs Otacon will be this Wednesday.

41
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:33,637
Speaker 1: packs will be some Tuesday in the future after you know after packs happens and You can listen if you want to.

42
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:34,623
Speaker 1: but this is Monday night.

43
00:02:34,663 --> 00:02:35,930
Speaker 1: We talked about neck beards and Linux.

44
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,290
Speaker 0: I'm curious as to where the neck beard meme started because you know did Darryl Surratt actually start that?

45
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:43,218
Speaker 1: The thing is that wasn't me.

46
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,945
Speaker 0: was it some or did he get it from somewhere?

47
00:02:45,006 --> 00:02:45,990
Speaker 1: that was definitely.

48
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,183
Speaker 0: I heard neck beards on twit recently.

49
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,870
Speaker 1: really I wonder if it's spreading again.

50
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,402
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, actually John C Dvorak said throat beard and then switched it up to neck beard broke beard.

51
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,512
Speaker 1: that is clearly someone who heard it Didn't know?

52
00:02:58,532 --> 00:03:03,670
Speaker 0: apparently people in the chat room in the Twitter chat room during the Twitter show or telling them throat beard neck beard.

53
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:08,008
Speaker 0: So, huh Yeah, I definitely some you know.

54
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,975
Speaker 0: Awo geek nice listeners.

55
00:03:10,135 --> 00:03:15,229
Speaker 1: I recall very distinctly hearing the term at our IT long before geek night.

56
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,393
Speaker 0: really I never did.

57
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:17,978
Speaker 1: I heard it more than once.

58
00:03:18,018 --> 00:03:24,080
Speaker 1: in fact someone pointed out to me that I had grown a neck beard because I Had in fact yeah, I'm talking about in relation to Linux users.

59
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:24,522
Speaker 1: Well.

60
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:26,510
Speaker 1: I was at our IT, and I was the Linux user.

61
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:33,650
Speaker 0: Well my headphones just started working a lot more than they were a second ago, that's strange all right.

62
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:37,446
Speaker 1: So you're gonna just throw that in there where I can't easily edit it out.

63
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:40,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine Okay, it's good for the show, but anyway.

64
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:41,563
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not protecting us.

65
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:46,714
Speaker 0: It's tech news tech stuff, but So long since we did any shows There's like just a bajillion.

66
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:47,839
Speaker 0: news is about everything.

67
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:56,824
Speaker 1: a very interesting anecdote from work actually of all things all right relation to tech because you know when you get back from a long vacation and you know we haven't done a geek nights in like a week and a half.

68
00:03:56,905 --> 00:04:03,470
Speaker 1: but Yeah, I show back up at work And you always have that kind of conversation with the co-workers of yeah, so were there any disasters while I was gone?

69
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:13,448
Speaker 1: And there was but I can't get in all the details But the kind of thing that only happens in like a lab practical in college happened at my work while I was gone.

70
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,662
Speaker 1: Wow Imagine a situation.

71
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:20,459
Speaker 1: we have three environments You know like a UAT environment a research environment and a production environment.

72
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:48,289
Speaker 1: the exact same problem the same symptom Happens in all three environments simultaneously, and the end result is that all three were Unrelated to one another despite the fact that at the level one and level two analysis They appeared to be the exact same problem and in fact there was an unrelated fourth error that was non Impacting in two of the three environments that was unrelated to either of the problems, huh?

73
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,850
Speaker 1: This was like the kind of thing like in a class on the exam.

74
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,126
Speaker 1: They'd be like what if blah happens and blah happens.

75
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:57,150
Speaker 1: What do you do?

76
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:01,810
Speaker 1: What could it possibly be, but it was in the real world to see you investigate and eventually figure it out.

77
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,500
Speaker 1: Well, they did well yes, because we're very smart, but this was one of those situations to where well I don't think most people could have solved it.

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,009
Speaker 0: It was solved it with enough time.

79
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:13,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had to solve it before the market opens better than our problem at work.

80
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,051
Speaker 0: We're.

81
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:15,075
Speaker 0: basically it's like well.

82
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,530
Speaker 0: This is fixable with lots and lots and lots of working.

83
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,922
Speaker 0: There's no like answer that we can't solve.

84
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:23,370
Speaker 0: it's like we know exactly what's wrong.

85
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,150
Speaker 0: It would just take incredible amounts of time and work to fix it, but this is what we do.

86
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:40,750
Speaker 1: This is like the equivalent of Imagine if images stopped working on like your outbound webs like your web server to the public on all your websites And it turned out that every website you run had its images broken independently by an unrelated problem.

87
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:43,743
Speaker 1: Yep, that was basically the equivalent of what we had to deal with.

88
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:46,475
Speaker 0: it's like you think it must be you But it's not you.

89
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:48,704
Speaker 0: every website out there had its images broke.

90
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:53,580
Speaker 0: Yes, all right, so Tech news right I guess we should talk about.

91
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:56,950
Speaker 0: you know there's like a bit of bajillion tech news over the past week or whatever.

92
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:07,145
Speaker 0: But I think an actual one of the most pressing ones is very recent and that is the most obviously the flame war rific AT&T blocking a 4chan.

93
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:10,090
Speaker 1: now I don't know who said it first.

94
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:18,790
Speaker 1: I think it actually might have come from fast karate But someone equated AT&T fighting with 4chan as a t-rex fighting a massive bacterial infection.

95
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:21,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone wrote that somewhere on the Internet's.

96
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:30,710
Speaker 0: Basically the situation it seems like now that all the information is out it goes something like this right AT&T is an internet service provider.

97
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:40,304
Speaker 0: Apparently there was a DDoS tech coming from within from AT&T ISP Subscribers to one particular 4chan server.

98
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:45,084
Speaker 1: I think it was the image server Which is as far as I can tell it's B, and I don't know what else.

99
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:47,476
Speaker 0: yeah bad stuff It's you know B.

100
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:48,703
Speaker 1: Definitely stands for bad.

101
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:54,964
Speaker 0: Yes, so AT&T saw this DDoS attack emerging from their network, so they blocked that.

102
00:06:55,084 --> 00:07:08,850
Speaker 1: right of course what they blocked was you know I guess HTTP gets outgoing to that 4chan server or something like that now as far as I can tell it's more likely that they blocked that IP which just hosted the images for a couple of the boards on fortune.

103
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, so anyone people are trying to go to 4chan who used AT&T as their ISP, and they couldn't get there.

104
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,970
Speaker 0: It wouldn't work, and you know brings up all sorts of net neutrality.

105
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,072
Speaker 0: It's like hey AT&T is not up to you to decide what sites I go to.

106
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:26,790
Speaker 0: and it's like even if there was a DDoS is it really up to AT&T to protect 4chan server?

107
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,830
Speaker 0: I mean it's 4chans problem.

108
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:35,716
Speaker 1: Well that more likely say they saw a DDoS arising from this and maybe just to protect their network They blocked it at the pairing level.

109
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:36,621
Speaker 0: That's true.

110
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,590
Speaker 0: It's true, but you know it's like.

111
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,633
Speaker 1: I mean, what do you do?

112
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:42,382
Speaker 1: you you're caught between a brick and another.

113
00:07:42,402 --> 00:07:44,710
Speaker 0: you couldn't you block it in another way?

114
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:47,689
Speaker 0: That would not prevent regular legitimate users from going to 4chan.

115
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:56,670
Speaker 1: That's the nature of DDoS that because of the fact basically a proper like well-executed DDoS is indistinguishable from popularity.

116
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,785
Speaker 0: It's true absolutely 100% indistinguishable.

117
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:00,650
Speaker 1: There is no way to know.

118
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,490
Speaker 0: I mean remember Google said when they go to the Michael Jackson searches they thought it was DDoS.

119
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:24,990
Speaker 1: Yes And this is becoming more and more of a problem as the use of the internet and the use of media Democratizes and people become more tech savvy but sources of information are still confined to a very relatively small number of web sites and Data flows are confined to relatively small number of peers and small number of IPs and small number of aggregation points.

120
00:08:25,473 --> 00:08:32,630
Speaker 1: People think that the internet is like this you know end to end But really it's very tiny endpoints connecting to very large endpoints through very small pipes.

121
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, now the thing is though.

122
00:08:34,395 --> 00:08:51,075
Speaker 0: even though it is true that a very well properly executed DDoS is indistinguishable from popularity The reality I think is that most DDoS is are not very well done And if you actually spend some time and closely inspect them you know like you look at the packet You know below just the destination.

123
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:54,186
Speaker 0: You know that the head on deep packet inspection is incredibly costly.

124
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,249
Speaker 0: It is incredibly costly.

125
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:03,250
Speaker 0: however Even like I'm not talking about actual deep packet inspection by the server I'm talking about by a human being just look at it in your you know your Wireshark or whatever.

126
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,090
Speaker 1: That's the thing is that the amount of time that adds to your response Basically makes you already a non actor in the situation.

127
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,963
Speaker 0: I mean you could look and you can see aha everything this DDoS is sending out.

128
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:22,424
Speaker 0: the packets all look exactly like this right and These normal people sending out packets look you know different.

129
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:25,516
Speaker 1: so even most often That's not the case because what are they sending?

130
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:31,261
Speaker 1: a get well you know who knows what they could be sending plus I mean even on like a local level.

131
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:35,700
Speaker 1: I mean within a corporate internet or something Let's say like someone's using up all your internet.

132
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,270
Speaker 1: It's not that trivial to figure out right away.

133
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,230
Speaker 1: I mean you might have some sort of proxy that logs stuff, but that gives you a huge performance hit.

134
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:43,017
Speaker 1: So what?

135
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,310
Speaker 1: maybe you turn on IP accounting?

136
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,169
Speaker 1: That's also a huge performance hit just to see who's talking the most and then figuring out what's going on.

137
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could also just sort of have.

138
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,323
Speaker 0: you know just generic throttling.

139
00:09:51,344 --> 00:09:52,810
Speaker 0: you know slow it down.

140
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:54,624
Speaker 0: So it doesn't kill you, but still let it go.

141
00:09:54,645 --> 00:09:55,128
Speaker 1: slow it down.

142
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:55,812
Speaker 1: slow What down.

143
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:58,123
Speaker 1: and does slowing down mean queuing up pack?

144
00:09:58,183 --> 00:09:59,750
Speaker 1: that means it means a QoS type?

145
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,722
Speaker 1: Yes, QoS Scott basically means drop packets randomly.

146
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:06,229
Speaker 1: Yeah, that doesn't often doesn't end.

147
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:08,360
Speaker 0: well Yeah, be good like QoS.

148
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,586
Speaker 0: Just the 4chan packets.

149
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:11,936
Speaker 0: You know something like that Yeah, but even then that's not so easy.

150
00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:15,870
Speaker 1: and when you're an ISP 4chan is no less legitimate.

151
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:18,847
Speaker 1: Then I don't know my porn dot org net.

152
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,886
Speaker 0: yeah But if I was an ISP I would definitely have advanced tools and people to deal with that.

153
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:24,890
Speaker 1: what advanced tools though?

154
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,861
Speaker 1: There's nothing terribly good for that.

155
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:36,719
Speaker 1: and my giant brain I mean it basically comes down to these kind of fuzzy statistical analysis and no matter what you do You're gonna piss someone off and as attacks to get more sophisticated.

156
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,350
Speaker 1: There's absolutely no way to determine a DDoS versus legitimate use.

157
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,981
Speaker 0: Yep, at the very least you know that this you know the.

158
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:47,111
Speaker 0: you could do like you could like call 4chan and like talk to Him.

159
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:58,470
Speaker 0: you know like if I saw DDoS going at someone's server, and I was an ISP Regardless of how I dealt with it on my network You know whatever decision I made I would call the person with the server and notify them.

160
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,335
Speaker 0: I'd be like you know if I notice it was yours like Google I would call Google on the phone.

161
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:03,099
Speaker 0: be like hey Google.

162
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is ISP number three.

163
00:11:04,686 --> 00:11:05,308
Speaker 0: all right point.

164
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:07,267
Speaker 1: the first point to the first Scott.

165
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,962
Speaker 1: Have you ever tried calling someone based on like some company?

166
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:12,066
Speaker 1: you know there should be no.

167
00:11:12,147 --> 00:11:13,030
Speaker 1: try calling Google.

168
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:14,446
Speaker 1: There's no red phone.

169
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:19,224
Speaker 0: There should be you know a place to call for that specific problem.

170
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,010
Speaker 1: It's per service all right Google.

171
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,130
Speaker 1: Maybe Google has a red phone one.

172
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many people are gonna be calling that for BS?

173
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,234
Speaker 0: I know, but I think you know.

174
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,021
Speaker 0: the fact is everyone has sort of like.

175
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:32,210
Speaker 0: there is sort of like these standards a little bit Right and that you're supposed to have like an email address.

176
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,381
Speaker 0: That's like abuse at and another one you know.

177
00:11:34,723 --> 00:11:35,749
Speaker 0: so I think we need Scott.

178
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:36,590
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

179
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:45,549
Speaker 1: They're sort of standard for I don't think we can because the signal-to-noise ratio is so high already That if you have a standard people will just hit it with their BS all the time.

180
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:47,055
Speaker 0: No, we just need a standard.

181
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:52,957
Speaker 0: you know in between network people's not for normal people's just for network people's to You know contact each other all right.

182
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:55,405
Speaker 1: so the Internet, so who would AT&T have contacted?

183
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:56,850
Speaker 1: because it's not another network?

184
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:59,284
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess they could contact what the ISP.

185
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:00,129
Speaker 0: Google is a network.

186
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,661
Speaker 0: All right, I guess they would probably call someone at Akamai.

187
00:12:02,782 --> 00:12:07,890
Speaker 1: actually because Google's all Akamai Yes, so then what they have so much to deal with anyway, or what about this 4chan situation?

188
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:08,833
Speaker 1: Who do you call?

189
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,104
Speaker 1: the ISP that hosts them.

190
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:12,270
Speaker 1: you got to figure out who that is?

191
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,896
Speaker 0: Yeah, you probably just call their hosting company.

192
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:14,579
Speaker 1: all right.

193
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,745
Speaker 1: You got to figure out who that is.

194
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:16,910
Speaker 1: you called their generic number.

195
00:12:17,274 --> 00:12:18,225
Speaker 1: It's like an 800 number.

196
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:18,549
Speaker 1: now what?

197
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,149
Speaker 0: Well they should have a number for calling with network problems with the network people all right.

198
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:25,309
Speaker 1: now Now they have to staff that number with humans.

199
00:12:25,731 --> 00:12:28,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's you know in the Network Operations Center.

200
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,786
Speaker 0: where then they already have for telephone?

201
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:30,870
Speaker 1: is that cost money?

202
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,670
Speaker 1: It costs a lot of money.

203
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,204
Speaker 1: They have to pass.

204
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:35,850
Speaker 0: yeah But everyone it'll be an equal cost for everyone because everyone will have you know the phone.

205
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,735
Speaker 1: It's got that reason.

206
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:38,082
Speaker 1: that raises the cost of everyone.

207
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:42,300
Speaker 1: so then I offer an eye But it'll make everything better for everyone also because it's got.

208
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,806
Speaker 1: it's the tragedy of the comments.

209
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:46,335
Speaker 1: everyone offers it great I make an ISP.

210
00:12:46,737 --> 00:12:47,620
Speaker 1: I don't offer it.

211
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,089
Speaker 0: I'm now cheaper than everyone else and therefore better And make it a require you should regulate it.

212
00:12:53,451 --> 00:12:59,207
Speaker 1: Oh wait regulation now that opens a whole extra can of worms in favor of that one regulation that it's got.

213
00:12:59,228 --> 00:13:00,050
Speaker 1: so what I mean?

214
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,014
Speaker 1: Where do you draw the line?

215
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,886
Speaker 1: I mean, what if the problem is coming from 4chan itself?

216
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,810
Speaker 1: whose responsibility?

217
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,559
Speaker 1: Is it to cut off that server.

218
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,590
Speaker 0: whoever owns a server all right?

219
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,497
Speaker 1: So how do I determine?

220
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,130
Speaker 1: so anyone who owns a server?

221
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:17,803
Speaker 1: That is in any way on the internet in any capacity has to pay to have a 24 by 7 hotline For people to call.

222
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:18,429
Speaker 1: that is public.

223
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we've got to have a hotline.

224
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,050
Speaker 0: someone can call your cell phone line out owns our our server.

225
00:13:24,231 --> 00:13:25,878
Speaker 0: We don't own it line ode.

226
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:27,405
Speaker 1: so the colo company has to do it.

227
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:29,254
Speaker 0: They're not a colo company They're hosting company.

228
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:30,861
Speaker 1: alright, so hosting companies.

229
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, what defines hosting company?

230
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,010
Speaker 1: I mean I can have a web server through our dynamic DNS out to the internet.

231
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now do I have to do this?

232
00:13:39,562 --> 00:13:39,843
Speaker 1: How do I?

233
00:13:40,065 --> 00:13:40,869
Speaker 1: how do I regulate that?

234
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,158
Speaker 0: If there's a problem and someone looks up your phone number.

235
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,630
Speaker 0: They can't find you then you know you gotta maintain this look-up.

236
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:48,835
Speaker 0: It's in who is put in.

237
00:13:48,855 --> 00:13:51,626
Speaker 0: the who is do where the abuse and all the other email addresses are the thing.

238
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:54,336
Speaker 1: that's basically completely Useless and unreliable as it stands.

239
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:54,979
Speaker 0: I think the who is.

240
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:55,360
Speaker 0: I should.

241
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,950
Speaker 0: I think the I can should be more better about enforcing.

242
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,480
Speaker 0: Who's gonna pay for that who were already paying for the.

243
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:01,786
Speaker 0: I can might as well pay more.

244
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,850
Speaker 0: it sucks as it is.

245
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,538
Speaker 1: I don't think regulation is the answer.

246
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,230
Speaker 0: I think I think there's a small amount of regulation would be good.

247
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:14,510
Speaker 0: People on the Internet's major network players need to have some way of just communicating with each other when shit goes down.

248
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:18,910
Speaker 1: Yes, and defining who a major network player is is already effectively impossible.

249
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,276
Speaker 1: There's a lot of obvious.

250
00:14:20,356 --> 00:14:26,822
Speaker 1: look at how many times even at the high level where the to to like level two ISPs will stop pairing with each other over some bullshit.

251
00:14:27,022 --> 00:14:27,263
Speaker 0: Yep.

252
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,150
Speaker 1: How are you going to regulate that?

253
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,265
Speaker 1: What if they just hang up on you, and then they say yeah the phone didn't work?

254
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,009
Speaker 1: or what if they just?

255
00:14:33,794 --> 00:14:34,862
Speaker 1: They say you know all right.

256
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:35,850
Speaker 1: Here's the situation.

257
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:41,710
Speaker 1: Let's say I as like you know a company call level three or cogent or someone because I have a problem.

258
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:44,149
Speaker 1: I'm singing DDoS and it's coming from their network.

259
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:51,290
Speaker 1: You know how long it's going to take me to get through Them to show them what the problem is such that they can deal with it.

260
00:14:51,531 --> 00:14:57,130
Speaker 1: It is much faster for me to simply block it thus saving myself the problem and by acting in my own self-interest.

261
00:14:57,612 --> 00:15:00,970
Speaker 1: It is not in my interest to work with anyone in any good faith.

262
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,058
Speaker 1: It is in my interest to cut them the fuck off.

263
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, but blocking is it's.

264
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,670
Speaker 0: you know It's bad for all sorts of other reasons is it?

265
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:23,609
Speaker 1: But what if you identified something that is coming through your network that is substantially degrading the entirety of your network And you have reason to believe may be substantially degrading the behavior of other people's networks And you have the capability right now to temporarily stop it and sort it out?

266
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:27,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if you were wrong and it was actually people searching for Michael Jackson after he died?

267
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,399
Speaker 1: well Here's the other problem, you know, there's the whole simulac.

268
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:31,884
Speaker 0: I think it's better safe than sorry.

269
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:33,670
Speaker 1: No safe than sorry in what direction?

270
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,336
Speaker 1: Here's the other simulac or situation.

271
00:15:35,878 --> 00:15:48,030
Speaker 1: if you cannot tell the difference between legitimate traffic and a DDoS They are effectively the same thing and blocking them has the same effect because legitimate traffic and illegitimate traffic are basically indistinguishable.

272
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:54,189
Speaker 1: So the Michael Jackson searches are equally useless and causing an equal problem to the 4chan DDoS.

273
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,290
Speaker 0: Well, one of them is censorship and one of them is you know protection.

274
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:04,467
Speaker 1: But is it censorship to block something that is basically preventing your network from functioning properly?

275
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:11,950
Speaker 0: if your network isn't Functioning when there is legitimate activity occurring then your network is just not capable of doing what needs to do.

276
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,251
Speaker 1: It's got.

277
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:20,809
Speaker 1: no network is capable because we've gotten to the point to where there is more data people want to send than there will Ever be capacity and the fundamental problem is exposed.

278
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:30,709
Speaker 1: Well, the fundamental problem is that there's no way to distinguish there's no regulatory way to solve it And currently there's no technological way to solve it other than being very very very very very smart.

279
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:37,170
Speaker 0: Well, you know the thing is despite all those things you just said there aren't DDoS is just going around killing everyone.

280
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,779
Speaker 0: Everything's got to work still.

281
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,309
Speaker 1: part of that is because people are.

282
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,104
Speaker 1: Networks are actually fairly proactive and stopping these sorts of things.

283
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:44,746
Speaker 0: Yeah.

284
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:52,236
Speaker 0: Oh Let us let us continue to another news and let us hope that the 4chan people You know don't ruin the Internet's.

285
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:54,041
Speaker 1: so remember a while ago.

286
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,989
Speaker 1: There was that whole brouhaha where oh shit, huh?

287
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:02,650
Speaker 1: Yes They deleted all these books from people's Kindles remotely.

288
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:07,527
Speaker 1: Oh, you want to talk about this BS like George Arwell's 1984 over the horror the irony.

289
00:17:08,411 --> 00:17:11,790
Speaker 0: I think it would have been more ironic though if they deleted Fahrenheit 451.

290
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,262
Speaker 1: I believe someone reported that they also deleted that.

291
00:17:15,463 --> 00:17:16,507
Speaker 0: that was just some.

292
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,430
Speaker 0: probably gotta be a joke.

293
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:21,026
Speaker 0: Well, the whole situation is that would have been the headline over the 1984 headline.

294
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:30,970
Speaker 1: Well, here's the deal as far as I can tell basically One people are angry about the fact that they have the ability to delete content that you bought.

295
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:31,653
Speaker 1: This is kind of.

296
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:35,170
Speaker 1: this is the thing that people who are advocating their own has it?

297
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,767
Speaker 1: This is the thing people were advocating DRM said would never happen.

298
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:41,409
Speaker 1: and here it is.

299
00:17:42,412 --> 00:17:44,539
Speaker 1: This is like the like the most egregious.

300
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,324
Speaker 1: here it is you bought something.

301
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:57,509
Speaker 1: they just delete it with a big fuck you Mm-hmm, but it's a little more complicated than that because what they deleted was 1984 which was being sold through their store by someone who had no legal right to sell it.

302
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:03,510
Speaker 0: Well, actually it's kind of weird because that book is in the public domain elsewhere in the world But it's not in the public domain in the US.

303
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,390
Speaker 1: Well, thus the other problem of the public domain and we've talked a lot about this in our forum.

304
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:12,130
Speaker 1: We haven't really brought it up in the show, but I'm pretty sure we have not in any great detail.

305
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:26,029
Speaker 1: We're getting to this point to where I feel like the public domain as an institution is Almost over broad and inconsistent and I feel like usually I am of the mind that we need to reduce Creators rights in order for the public good.

306
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:32,848
Speaker 1: This is one situation where I feel like we need to increase Creators rights and I think the public domain really needs to be replaced by some sort of you.

307
00:18:33,873 --> 00:18:39,040
Speaker 1: I think an artist has a perpetual right to Notability and a perpetual right to attribution.

308
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,650
Speaker 0: Well, no one's come no one's complaining about attribution.

309
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,346
Speaker 0: People are complaining about you know, the ability to just use the frickin.

310
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:53,615
Speaker 0: Yes, but the fact that the Okay, they don't want to change the name on the book to say 1984 by Scott Reuben They just read it they can.

311
00:18:53,655 --> 00:19:04,890
Speaker 1: but the problem is that the public domain is both over broad in one way and yet So far out into the future and so inconsistent that it's useless anyway.

312
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,475
Speaker 1: So the whole thing's moot to begin with.

313
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,565
Speaker 0: yeah, well, I think one interesting thing about the situation right?

314
00:19:09,646 --> 00:19:12,566
Speaker 0: is we usually you know We talk about you know.

315
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,804
Speaker 0: Aha, well, you know a regular book, you know, just you know photo.

316
00:19:17,885 --> 00:19:20,674
Speaker 0: if I steal a regular book from you now You don't have the book right?

317
00:19:20,694 --> 00:19:24,750
Speaker 0: We're always comparing the digital reality to the physical, you know manufactured reality.

318
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,196
Speaker 1: But then there's the meta argument.

319
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:29,250
Speaker 0: The thing is right with the physical book, right?

320
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:38,230
Speaker 0: Let's say I illegally printed up copies of 1984 and sold one to you Right, and then I go to jail or I get sued or whatever happens to me for my illegal, right?

321
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,949
Speaker 0: They're never gonna come and take the book away.

322
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,330
Speaker 1: Well you and they perfectly legally can because the receipt of stolen property is itself something that can be remedied.

323
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,310
Speaker 1: So if you get stolen property, the police can just take it from you with no compensation.

324
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,154
Speaker 0: They never will.

325
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:52,929
Speaker 0: they're gonna have that book, you know, how many you get bootleg CD?

326
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,454
Speaker 0: They're not gonna come and get it.

327
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:55,298
Speaker 1: is they can.

328
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,859
Speaker 1: and in a lot of cases like if you buy a car and it turns Out the car was stolen.

329
00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:11,010
Speaker 1: You're just out of luck Uh-huh, so then if that is the person who sold it to you, but they're probably in jail and indigent at this point Anyway, so if that's the case, right the you know, the the stolen property, right?

330
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:18,684
Speaker 0: Then this is a situation where if you want to if you want to talk about it that way Then these people got off easy by getting a refund and having the book taken away.

331
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:19,246
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

332
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:24,580
Speaker 1: I Have my take is that they were technically in the right.

333
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:32,163
Speaker 1: They were technically correct the best kind of correct, but There was probably a better way to go about it.

334
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:35,647
Speaker 1: that wouldn't have generated all this bad Press and would have made everyone happier.

335
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:41,359
Speaker 0: Yeah well, I mean they were first of all, they were negligent in making sure that people who selling books on the Kindle had the right to it right.

336
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:51,817
Speaker 0: and Second of all, right now this is what happens when you have a closed platform Right is you look at something like, you know The Kindle or the Apple Store right?

337
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:55,350
Speaker 0: if you actually want to have some sort of control over what?

338
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,721
Speaker 0: Content shows up in your you know, what books are on Kindle.

339
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:01,610
Speaker 0: then you're now responsible for a books are on Kindle.

340
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:04,230
Speaker 0: Amazon was responsible for that book being there.

341
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,414
Speaker 0: That wasn't supposed to be there.

342
00:21:05,976 --> 00:21:19,430
Speaker 0: if they would just be cool and let anyone put whatever the fuck book they want on the Kindle Right without interfering or anything then Amazon would have no responsibility And it would be up to that person who illegally put the book there to go get in trouble.

343
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:24,170
Speaker 1: Well, that is I would still have responsibility if someone bamboozled them and sold something through their store.

344
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:35,529
Speaker 0: But yes, but no it's not Amazon's responsive if Amazon just let anyone put any book on the Kindle right without You know making a yes or no decision then Amazon's got nothing to do with it.

345
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:36,998
Speaker 1: No, because what if?

346
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:37,179
Speaker 1: what?

347
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:42,029
Speaker 1: if they set up for Amazon, you know You can put whatever book you want on the Kindle trivially and it'll just work.

348
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:46,589
Speaker 1: But they also have their store which you pay for them to get a book from it.

349
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,809
Speaker 0: No No, I'm talking about there's a store and anyone can put anything in the store and that's it.

350
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:52,155
Speaker 0: I'm talking about that.

351
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:55,630
Speaker 1: you still run into legal trouble in that situation by facilitating the sale.

352
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:57,756
Speaker 0: No, cuz that's what the DMCA does.

353
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:04,201
Speaker 0: the DMCA says if you're making a platform for distribution and you're not, you know Controlling it editorially got the damage.

354
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:10,566
Speaker 1: You're not responsible for you know To a degree as far as I've read the DMCA only protects you in certain specific situations.

355
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:11,790
Speaker 1: You're still confronted to trouble.

356
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,112
Speaker 1: I think.

357
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:13,237
Speaker 0: no actually that's.

358
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:14,825
Speaker 0: it's a specific thing.

359
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:15,690
Speaker 0: is that it's that you know.

360
00:22:16,511 --> 00:22:21,250
Speaker 1: Situation where the law encourages something that in the end is actually in more bad faith toward the authors.

361
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:25,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no that's you know, why Google was so genius with YouTube, right?

362
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,419
Speaker 0: Google doesn't say this can go on YouTube.

363
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,290
Speaker 0: this can unless it's you know illegal child.

364
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,661
Speaker 1: Notice how they still have to take things down.

365
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:33,550
Speaker 0: Oh, they don't take it down, right?

366
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,913
Speaker 0: Google doesn't take it down.

367
00:22:34,993 --> 00:22:44,275
Speaker 1: the copyright holders are doing the police copyright order holder does all the policing but once the copyright holder makes A legitimate request Google has to follow her and take it down Doesn't take it down?

368
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:47,550
Speaker 0: the copyright holders have an interface through which they do the taking down.

369
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,880
Speaker 1: Yes, but Google created that to comply with the law.

370
00:22:50,181 --> 00:22:52,110
Speaker 0: No, they didn't do to complain with the law.

371
00:22:52,210 --> 00:23:01,396
Speaker 1: They did it to you know, keep those copyright holders from you know Bitching and mode Oh Scott because if Google had not created that interface for them to do it directly Then Google would have had to do it.

372
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,967
Speaker 1: No, they wouldn't have in response to a complaint.

373
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,130
Speaker 0: They would have No in respite.

374
00:23:06,293 --> 00:23:07,993
Speaker 0: Oh if they yeah then the DMCA.

375
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,763
Speaker 1: if someone makes a complaint to them then they would have to respond.

376
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:15,240
Speaker 1: their genius was making a system to where They don't have to actually ever Themselves deal with the complaints.

377
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,410
Speaker 1: the complaints are dealt with directly.

378
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:21,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is you don't have to you know respond to the complaints unless someone actually comes and you know sues you or whatever.

379
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,909
Speaker 1: Well, no if someone responds the safe harbor thing is basically that if someone makes a complaint then you have.

380
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,129
Speaker 1: you know You have to take it down.

381
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,582
Speaker 0: You don't have to take it down until they you know prove just making it take.

382
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,010
Speaker 0: sending a takedown notice isn't enough unless you know.

383
00:23:35,191 --> 00:23:37,218
Speaker 0: That's basically the nice thing you can do.

384
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:38,724
Speaker 0: is you know, take it down.

385
00:23:38,804 --> 00:23:41,454
Speaker 0: if you know someone sends you a takedown notice They still have to go to.

386
00:23:41,515 --> 00:23:44,990
Speaker 0: you know, if you say no, they have to go to court and prove that they actually own it.

387
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,693
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing you don't want.

388
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:58,646
Speaker 1: as far as I'm aware and I'm pretty sure I'm more right on this than you if someone issues you a takedown out of the DMCA and You don't there's certain things you have to do in good faith or else you lose the safe harbor provision.

389
00:23:58,907 --> 00:23:59,670
Speaker 0: No, I'm pretty.

390
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:09,290
Speaker 0: no They have to go You know, you can just be like whatever and completely ignore it and they have to go and prove that they actually own it You know to make you take it down, but the takedown notice just sort of an a nice thing.

391
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,210
Speaker 0: It's like hey before you know, we go to court.

392
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:18,636
Speaker 0: Yeah I just want to let you know and if you're pretty sure that you know you they own it and you don't want to deal With that bullshit, then you take it down.

393
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,347
Speaker 1: So 30 seconds of googling proves that I'm right.

394
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:23,293
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't Doesn't?

395
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:23,636
Speaker 1: alright?

396
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:43,374
Speaker 1: in order to have an allegedly Infringing website removed from a service providers network or to have access to an allegedly infringing website Disabled the copyright owner must provide and then they give this list of things you have to provide Which is you know the name and address of the complaint the material in question a statement under penalty of perjury that you're accurate in Your claim and all that stuff.

397
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:53,490
Speaker 1: now once notice is given to a service provider or the service provider discovers them infringing material itself They are required to expeditiously remove or disable access to the material.

398
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:56,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is is that you you know.

399
00:24:56,311 --> 00:25:02,285
Speaker 0: The original point was that if you you know If you are not editing your content, even just letting people post whatever they want.

400
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,235
Speaker 0: You have a safe harbor Still says that.

401
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:11,090
Speaker 1: and remember It gets tricky when their commercial interests involved, especially if you facilitate the transaction.

402
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:18,760
Speaker 1: But when it comes to the safe harbor specifically if you're given a takedown notice, you have to take it down Immediately and then the person that's.

403
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,252
Speaker 0: if the takedown notice is legitimate what it you know It says.

404
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:27,161
Speaker 0: if they have to you know say that they're definitely the people who oh, yes It's not difficult to make a legitimate one.

405
00:25:27,181 --> 00:25:28,447
Speaker 1: There are very few criteria.

406
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:28,929
Speaker 1: You have to meet.

407
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:33,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know there's plenty you know, well I could just make up takedown notices for nothing and send them in.

408
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,457
Speaker 1: Yes, you can and if you do you know what.

409
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,490
Speaker 1: the people you send them to have to take the stuff down at first.

410
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,040
Speaker 0: But what am I sending stuff for?

411
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:41,289
Speaker 0: like someone else's shit, you know?

412
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:50,675
Speaker 1: However, you doing that is illegal and then the person who stuff was taken down can file a counterclaim and then they could basically sue You for perjury, but it's basically more.

413
00:25:50,775 --> 00:25:51,738
Speaker 0: it's basically they've made.

414
00:25:51,778 --> 00:25:55,950
Speaker 0: it's a situation where it's less work to just take all the shit down.

415
00:25:57,052 --> 00:25:58,070
Speaker 1: It's not just less work.

416
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:04,605
Speaker 1: It's that if if the ISP the person who is providing the place where the stuff is Does not immediately respond and take it down.

417
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:12,409
Speaker 1: They're responsible So they'll just take it down no matter what and then it is your responsibility As the person who put the stuff up in the first place to file a counterclaim and get it back.

418
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:21,950
Speaker 0: The point is that if they just let anyone who wanted to post books to Amazon They would still have to take down things based on infringement notices immediately.

419
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:26,931
Speaker 0: Perhaps they would have to take it down, but there is nothing in there that says they would have to remove it from all the Kindles.

420
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,784
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is that I could see situation because remember safe harbor.

421
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:38,550
Speaker 1: All it does is protect you from being sued Mm-hmm, but you still at the same time distributed what could be classified as stolen materials.

422
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:39,976
Speaker 0: I didn't distribute it.

423
00:26:39,996 --> 00:26:43,510
Speaker 0: the responsibility for that distribution goes to the person who posted it.

424
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:49,510
Speaker 1: I said me but I'm safe only if you don't have the means to remove it Because if you do have the means then you're not safe.

425
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,000
Speaker 1: Harbor doesn't give you protection from that sort of thing or from remedies.

426
00:26:52,441 --> 00:26:54,610
Speaker 1: It only protects you from monetary damages.

427
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:56,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't sue me.

428
00:26:57,195 --> 00:27:01,669
Speaker 0: someone else puts that you know copyright infringing video on YouTube and then it was taken down.

429
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:09,447
Speaker 0: and now Um, you know, even though someone out there might have downloaded that video from YouTube and saved it and kept it around We don't make them from their computer.

430
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:14,369
Speaker 1: right now I can show in a court of law that you have the ability to trivially remove it from everyone's computers who download.

431
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,495
Speaker 0: well See that see that's the thing is.

432
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:30,522
Speaker 0: I think it was a big mistake was even putting that ability in in the first place By using the same DRM, right that you were attempting to use to you know, prevent copy protection You know to prevent, you know copyright infringing activities.

433
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:32,629
Speaker 0: You've actually sort of screwed yourself.

434
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:41,226
Speaker 1: well Scott is it's a cash 22 because I have a feeling that very few publishers would have agreed to even be on the Kindle in The first place or through their store at all if they didn't have this ability.

435
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,191
Speaker 1: and this DRM It's.

436
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,515
Speaker 0: so I can't believe it's.

437
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:45,420
Speaker 0: it's one thing that astonishes me right?

438
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:48,650
Speaker 0: is that you think about this right copyright copyright copy.

439
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,344
Speaker 0: We've been talking about this for how long over a decade.

440
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:52,906
Speaker 0: It's the year 2009 Scott.

441
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,827
Speaker 0: This is an issue since the late 90s.

442
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,321
Speaker 0: I know where you're going.

443
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,616
Speaker 1: there's a trivial answers to why one.

444
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:03,227
Speaker 1: the majority of the population of the world doesn't care.

445
00:28:03,247 --> 00:28:08,330
Speaker 1: a very small subset of people even know it's an issue and That's it No one cares.

446
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:09,165
Speaker 1: so it'll never get changed.

447
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:18,659
Speaker 0: and Even after over a decade the record companies have figured out that DRM is completely stupid and their sales Really haven't gone down since getting rid of DRM.

448
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,630
Speaker 0: and in fact recently an RA person was like DRM is dead.

449
00:28:22,011 --> 00:28:24,942
Speaker 0: Hello, welcome to you know, 2009.

450
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:25,905
Speaker 0: It's like I'm like hello.

451
00:28:25,966 --> 00:28:27,891
Speaker 0: Welcome to 1999.

452
00:28:27,891 --> 00:28:37,664
Speaker 0: Yet the people with books the people with movies They still haven't learned the same exact lesson in over a decade because I'm pretty much like well If you're that slow to learn your lesson just fuck you.

453
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:38,469
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna steal all your.

454
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:39,295
Speaker 1: well No, it's got part of it.

455
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:41,210
Speaker 1: I think is that with music they were basically damned.

456
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,650
Speaker 1: They didn't end if they didn't so they went with the damned if they didn't but I don't think they're really any better off.

457
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,830
Speaker 1: Either way, and when it comes to everything else, there's no incentive.

458
00:28:49,011 --> 00:28:53,050
Speaker 1: There's absolutely no incentive to drop it because it's one of those tragedy of the common situations.

459
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:57,909
Speaker 1: If one person drops it Then all the publishers will go to the people who still have it.

460
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:03,290
Speaker 1: Everyone has to drop it at the same time or the people who drop it lose out from the publishers and the publishers don't care.

461
00:29:03,691 --> 00:29:04,594
Speaker 1: And the people don't care.

462
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:05,277
Speaker 1: so nothing changes.

463
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,070
Speaker 0: I think I think the thing is they underestimate how much the people do care.

464
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:11,258
Speaker 1: And no, I think it's an echo chamber.

465
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:11,881
Speaker 1: nerds care.

466
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:12,563
Speaker 1: No one else does.

467
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,074
Speaker 1: no one else even realizes There's a problem.

468
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:28,123
Speaker 0: well see that's the thing is I think people don't realize there's a problem But then as soon as until it gets in their face people don't realize didn't realize iTunes DRM was a problem until they tried to You know authorize that fifth computer, or you know they.

469
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,670
Speaker 0: they tried to redownload something.

470
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,317
Speaker 0: They got deleted when their hard drive crashed.

471
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:34,150
Speaker 0: people don't realize the Kindle DRM is even there at all.

472
00:29:34,331 --> 00:29:37,390
Speaker 0: It's not an issue to them until the book they paid for gets deleted.

473
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:39,628
Speaker 0: Then suddenly they wake up to DRM.

474
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,407
Speaker 0: And I think over time more and more people wake up to DRM.

475
00:29:43,487 --> 00:29:48,830
Speaker 0: and in each Individual arena in music it already enough people woke up in music to get rid of it.

476
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:54,270
Speaker 0: I think it's only a matter of time before Enough people wake up to it in movies and wake up to it in ebooks.

477
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,286
Speaker 0: And now you have to get rid of it too, and it's just you know.

478
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,010
Speaker 0: you wait for these people.

479
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,781
Speaker 1: It's a matter of time, but the fact is that right now.

480
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:02,826
Speaker 1: We're nowhere near that.

481
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:03,850
Speaker 1: so nothing's going to change.

482
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:05,409
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna change.

483
00:30:05,672 --> 00:30:08,048
Speaker 1: I don't think it is because one how few people own kindles.

484
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,537
Speaker 1: anyway It's a relatively small.

485
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:20,928
Speaker 0: and the other thing that there's so retard is that look Anyone who's gonna buy books is gonna You know for you there kindle is gonna buy them whether this DRM or not and anyone who's gonna Pirate them is gonna pirate them whether this DRM or not.

486
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:28,070
Speaker 1: It's just no because there isn't as nearly as wide of a piracy network for books because only nerds care.

487
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:29,516
Speaker 1: No one else does think about it.

488
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:34,194
Speaker 1: most people don't even like things like kindles because they have the stigma against reading things on a Piece of paper.

489
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:37,770
Speaker 0: yeah, the kindles actually sound really well though, so it is selling really well.

490
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,448
Speaker 0: But I do want to point out that they had to drop the price on it.

491
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,210
Speaker 0: perhaps It's not selling as well as they expect.

492
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,775
Speaker 1: It's got wallet selling really well.

493
00:30:43,855 --> 00:30:45,681
Speaker 1: the majority of people don't care.

494
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,125
Speaker 1: don't want any device like this.

495
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:50,638
Speaker 0: story is all over the news so It's already out of the news.

496
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:51,984
Speaker 1: It's only in the tech news now.

497
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:53,050
Speaker 1: No one cares anymore.

498
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,195
Speaker 0: It was on the regular news.

499
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:56,263
Speaker 1: yeah for a brief flash and people have already got.

500
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:58,515
Speaker 1: people care more about New Jersey than they ever Will about this.

501
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:00,410
Speaker 0: oh, New Jersey, that's something to talk about.

502
00:31:07,044 --> 00:31:08,819
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

503
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:23,718
Speaker 1: So you know that apocryphal tale about how when NASA was trying to figure out a way that's to write In space on the space shuttle in the Apollo program They came up with a multi-million dollar program to make the space pen and the Russians just use a pencil and how.

504
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:27,272
Speaker 1: that was completely Apocryphal and not true, but it's a very resonant story.

505
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,919
Speaker 0: It is an apocryphal story.

506
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:31,428
Speaker 0: however I do want to point out this space pen does exist.

507
00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:34,660
Speaker 1: it does, but we did invent that well for that reason.

508
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,366
Speaker 1: But it has its uses.

509
00:31:36,406 --> 00:31:38,634
Speaker 1: I can write upside down continuously great.

510
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is great.

511
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:46,624
Speaker 1: Not really that is okay, but anyway here is basically the same story But it's not apocryphal.

512
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:50,134
Speaker 1: so if you want that sort of story to tell us an anecdote here.

513
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:51,258
Speaker 1: We go in China.

514
00:31:52,684 --> 00:31:59,753
Speaker 1: There was some regulation saying that buses have to have Devices to allow you to break a window in the event of an emergency and escape.

515
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:03,939
Speaker 1: and you've seen these things are like a specialized Little hammer with like the pointy bit.

516
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,360
Speaker 0: Why don't they just have the removable windows where you like pull the clamp off the side of the window and push it out?

517
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:12,140
Speaker 1: Well one those are a lot more expensive than you know what is on existing buses.

518
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:14,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, yeah, and to even in the u.s.

519
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,580
Speaker 1: A lot of buses that have those windows also have the hammers somewhere.

520
00:32:17,841 --> 00:32:20,711
Speaker 1: Uh-huh because you know the window might be in the wrong place.

521
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:22,277
Speaker 1: They can't make all the windows that way.

522
00:32:22,297 --> 00:32:24,847
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, and also, it's China.

523
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:25,630
Speaker 1: You know not everybody.

524
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,699
Speaker 0: they have the school bus rear exit action.

525
00:32:28,324 --> 00:32:29,660
Speaker 1: You can but that's not enough.

526
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,684
Speaker 0: I mean US school buses.

527
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:31,186
Speaker 0: they have the.

528
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:32,771
Speaker 0: you can push out the window also.

529
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:40,760
Speaker 1: you basically need the rear exit the side exit the Top exit yep, so they have this regulation to save lives because obviously there's a lot of crappy old buses.

530
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,690
Speaker 0: Oh wait lots of crappy old buzz.

531
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,112
Speaker 1: think about it.

532
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:48,960
Speaker 1: a simple solution is to Require that all buses have means of egress in the case of an emergency.

533
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:54,519
Speaker 1: And you could have kind of the last resort regulatory option of the special little hammer to break the window and get out.

534
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:58,940
Speaker 1: Well it turns out those little hammers are being stolen in every single bus.

535
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,106
Speaker 1: They put him in because you steal a hammer.

536
00:33:01,507 --> 00:33:01,888
Speaker 1: Why not?

537
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:02,449
Speaker 1: it's there.

538
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:03,974
Speaker 1: It's trivial to grab.

539
00:33:04,495 --> 00:33:06,300
Speaker 1: It's a relatively useful tool.

540
00:33:06,461 --> 00:33:09,660
Speaker 1: It's basically like this pick and China's relatively poor especially in the more rural.

541
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,400
Speaker 0: Why don't you put the hammer in like you know the little glass case?

542
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,948
Speaker 0: This is breaking case of emergency.

543
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,140
Speaker 1: just break it and take the hammer and also that's more expensive.

544
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:19,236
Speaker 1: Yeah, and think all right someone breaks it and take the camera.

545
00:33:19,296 --> 00:33:24,119
Speaker 1: great now I have to replace the hammer and the glass but the alarm goes off and you arrest them for stealing.

546
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,859
Speaker 1: now I also have to pay for an alarm.

547
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,557
Speaker 0: It's just a little teeny teeny teeny.

548
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got that.

549
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:30,971
Speaker 1: that that's a lot said.

550
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:36,830
Speaker 0: when you multiply it by number Maybe China can buy their own crappy You know bell ringy things instead of selling them to us.

551
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:39,320
Speaker 1: so it's got multiply that by number of buses in China.

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,384
Speaker 1: You have a problem.

553
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:55,248
Speaker 1: so some enterprising bus companies took bricks painted them yellow put the Chinese characters on them to be you know in case of emergency and These 100% met the regulatory requirement.

554
00:33:55,669 --> 00:33:59,039
Speaker 1: and as the bus company said no one's going to steal a brick.

555
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,326
Speaker 0: I Would it would be cool brick?

556
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:01,869
Speaker 0: I would take one.

557
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,557
Speaker 1: Are you gonna carry this brick around?

558
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:04,060
Speaker 1: We're gonna do it.

559
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,239
Speaker 1: We stole a brick at RIT.

560
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:05,743
Speaker 1: You know what.

561
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:06,869
Speaker 1: we put it back.

562
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,800
Speaker 1: that brick was more of a pain in the ass.

563
00:34:09,001 --> 00:34:11,380
Speaker 0: But this brick is yellow and his cool Chinese writing on it.

564
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:18,308
Speaker 1: That would be like a souvenir when I got back to the old Chinese writing in China is the equivalent of stealing a brick that Says like BD on it.

565
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:24,031
Speaker 0: Yeah BD is cool No, but when if I'm not Chinese, I'd steal it.

566
00:34:24,071 --> 00:34:26,500
Speaker 0: Chinese people don't want the bricks, but US people would watch.

567
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,152
Speaker 1: Yes, and how many US people are gonna ride some podunk bus in the middle of China?

568
00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:32,020
Speaker 0: I would well why else go to China?

569
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,085
Speaker 0: I want to get the real experience.

570
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:40,855
Speaker 1: anyway if you want that tail, and you don't want it to be apocryphal here you go And there's a good picture of the brick.

571
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:42,967
Speaker 0: well You know how you were just talking about.

572
00:34:43,288 --> 00:34:44,592
Speaker 0: you know Russians using a pencil.

573
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:45,456
Speaker 0: yep, you know.

574
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:48,335
Speaker 0: and we made a space pen Which isn't true, but anyway right.

575
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,574
Speaker 0: well You know we made you know IBM computers.

576
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:55,552
Speaker 0: You know Russians made BIM computers, I don't know what they.

577
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:57,020
Speaker 0: you know they made Russian computers.

578
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:00,619
Speaker 1: And if you know China tried to make computers to that the dragon project back in the day.

579
00:35:00,901 --> 00:35:01,385
Speaker 0: You know that was.

580
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,380
Speaker 0: that was more recently that was a while ago.

581
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,908
Speaker 1: They tried to make their own chips not X.

582
00:35:05,008 --> 00:35:06,254
Speaker 0: it was less than a decade ago.

583
00:35:06,315 --> 00:35:12,113
Speaker 0: these Russian computers Let's talk decade a decade less than a decade even less than a decade.

584
00:35:12,555 --> 00:35:14,300
Speaker 1: What was the world like in?

585
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,463
Speaker 1: 2002?

586
00:35:16,463 --> 00:35:21,359
Speaker 0: not bad these computers by the Russians are made in the 50s and mostly the 60s.

587
00:35:24,763 --> 00:35:26,511
Speaker 0: I mean you think about it right and it's it.

588
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:30,630
Speaker 0: there's this whole thing that goes on with Soviet stuff because they were cut off from the world.

589
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,635
Speaker 0: so it's like they didn't have.

590
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:42,840
Speaker 0: you know it's like you look around the world Today right it's like okay if I go to say Japan or China or Australia or Europe right we generally have a lot of the same stuff.

591
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,920
Speaker 0: You know maybe their exact model of DVD player be a little different.

592
00:35:46,342 --> 00:35:49,032
Speaker 0: Maybe there's some you know unique local stylings, but in general.

593
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:49,373
Speaker 0: It's like.

594
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,179
Speaker 0: Oh look a Sony TV.

595
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:54,191
Speaker 0: You know it does not a lot of it's not that kind of.

596
00:35:54,251 --> 00:35:54,974
Speaker 0: you know like.

597
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:58,389
Speaker 0: there's not some electronics company That is exclusive to say France.

598
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,700
Speaker 0: You know you can't see that stuff anywhere.

599
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,180
Speaker 0: You know maybe there's you know car models that are only sold in other countries, but you know it's it's getting very globalized.

600
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:13,479
Speaker 0: But when the world was cut by the Cold War Russia had all this shit that no one else had and we had all this shit that Russia didn't have.

601
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:22,414
Speaker 0: so When you look at the Russian computers like wow you know they didn't have no univacs or anything like that, so They got all this cool stuff.

602
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:23,180
Speaker 0: and one interesting.

603
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,309
Speaker 0: There's a big article here with a few pictures.

604
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:31,368
Speaker 0: one interesting thing from the article was that you know Early on of course they were trying to you know basically out.

605
00:36:31,448 --> 00:36:44,577
Speaker 0: invent the United States in terms of computer technology right, but eventually They just told the Russian computer scientists like give up just copy everything IBM does and then try to improve on it.

606
00:36:44,597 --> 00:36:46,970
Speaker 0: stop trying to beat them by developing from scratch.

607
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:49,486
Speaker 0: I Thought that was that was pretty humorous.

608
00:36:49,747 --> 00:36:49,948
Speaker 0: well.

609
00:36:50,370 --> 00:37:02,589
Speaker 1: I recall way back in the day playing Aerobiz and Aerobiz supersonic on the SNES and I always play like a European country or America or something And I'd always see that I can the Eastern Bloc.

610
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:09,233
Speaker 1: there'd be these plane companies other than Boeing and Airbus and such McDonnell Douglas, but I can never buy the planes.

611
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:13,300
Speaker 1: whenever I tried to send a representative there They'd be like we can't buy Eastern Bloc planes.

612
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,891
Speaker 1: I was there was always this mystique about them.

613
00:37:15,516 --> 00:37:20,060
Speaker 1: so one day I played as the Russians and said and I could buy Eastern Bloc planes.

614
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,520
Speaker 1: Let me tell you those Tupolev and Ilyushin planes were the biggest pieces of shit.

615
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:26,999
Speaker 1: They were more expensive and worse.

616
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's totally how it works over there.

617
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,723
Speaker 0: so if you want to see some more expensive and worse computers from Russia from the 60s the likes of which you've probably Never seen.

618
00:37:36,743 --> 00:37:40,100
Speaker 0: this is a good article for reading and looking at the pictures.

619
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:50,840
Speaker 1: It's weird though how as much as you know the Soviet Union was basically this economic disaster But the styling of the Eastern Bloc in my opinion for whatever reason was pretty damn cool.

620
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,300
Speaker 0: I know you look at these things right and I mean univax pretty cool.

621
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:01,263
Speaker 0: But these things they look like they belong in like some awesome like sci-fi movie like Soviet Bloc apartments and Soviet car There's.

622
00:38:01,444 --> 00:38:03,199
Speaker 1: there's this mystique about cool.

623
00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:05,047
Speaker 0: They have right.

624
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:11,220
Speaker 0: the ones where it's like just vacuum tubes and the vacuum tubes have numbers in them And it looks like some sort of crazy Frankenstein thing love those things.

625
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got to get one of those, but you know they just had like this great style to it.

626
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,469
Speaker 0: I don't know like why the style is great.

627
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:17,650
Speaker 0: like.

628
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,960
Speaker 0: is it as the aesthetics of the stuff itself?

629
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:23,580
Speaker 0: Or is it the fact that you know we didn't see stuff like that in this side of the world?

630
00:38:23,815 --> 00:38:25,648
Speaker 0: Yeah I wish I could figure out what it is about it.

631
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:27,878
Speaker 0: that makes it so awesome in the way it looks.

632
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:31,112
Speaker 0: at least It's like the fact that it came from a terrible situation.

633
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:40,306
Speaker 1: So SSL there was an article about self-signed certificate and all that stuff on Is it?

634
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:42,479
Speaker 0: will we get in trouble if I just call it a racket?

635
00:38:42,499 --> 00:38:42,539
Speaker 0: ah?

636
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,785
Speaker 1: Racketeering is a word.

637
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:45,970
Speaker 1: I may or may not have used.

638
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,180
Speaker 0: let me let me explain the situation here.

639
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,170
Speaker 0: So people know what this is about.

640
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,034
Speaker 0: right you know how.

641
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:53,470
Speaker 0: sometimes you go to a website And you want to buy something.

642
00:38:53,631 --> 00:39:05,303
Speaker 0: usually when you're buying something But also for other situations, and you know this lock appears in your web browser Or maybe your web browser turns green and it says you know you are secure and safe right you know That's.

643
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:06,538
Speaker 0: that's what SSL is.

644
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:07,723
Speaker 0: now What SSL does?

645
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:09,247
Speaker 0: is it does two things.

646
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:12,697
Speaker 0: probably does a lot of things but does primarily two things.

647
00:39:13,058 --> 00:39:13,580
Speaker 0: the first thing?

648
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,540
Speaker 0: It does is it guarantees that the website you think you're at is the website you are.

649
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:24,549
Speaker 0: So let's say I'm at amazon.com, and it turns green.

650
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:37,940
Speaker 0: that means I know I am at amazon.com and none of this information I'm typing in to the form on the website is going to say Google or Who knows who else unless Amazon gives it to them on the back end right the?

651
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,060
Speaker 0: Communications between me and that web server are just between me and that web server.

652
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,812
Speaker 0: There's no one snooping on it or anything like that and the number two thing.

653
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,097
Speaker 0: so it's anti-phishing right.

654
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,829
Speaker 0: the number two thing It does is it has some sort of symmetric encryption right.

655
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:56,952
Speaker 0: so if someone is just like snooping the packets They just see this garbledy garbledy garbledy, and they can't see.

656
00:39:56,972 --> 00:39:58,820
Speaker 0: you know what I'm typing in and spy on it.

657
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,347
Speaker 0: Right and that's what SSL is supposed to do.

658
00:40:01,447 --> 00:40:16,780
Speaker 0: and that's why if you are engaging in a secure transaction online You know typing in your credit card number your social security number anything along those lines You want to make sure that you send a little lock up in the you know location bar of your web browser.

659
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,419
Speaker 0: But also you want to make sure that the URL in the location bar is the website you think you're dealing with.

660
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,706
Speaker 0: you know Even if it's secure.

661
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:30,417
Speaker 0: if you send your shit to some shady site well You know I mean I could give a secret encoded message to some.

662
00:40:30,517 --> 00:40:34,069
Speaker 0: you know Criminal on the street, and I still gave it to.

663
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:35,292
Speaker 0: you know it doesn't help me.

664
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:39,844
Speaker 0: No one else got it, but the criminal, but hey That's how things go.

665
00:40:40,025 --> 00:40:43,295
Speaker 1: so here's the problem with the way SSL really works.

666
00:40:43,356 --> 00:40:50,359
Speaker 1: is that to get that certificate You basically just have to pay some arbitrary person enough money, and then they give it to you.

667
00:40:50,459 --> 00:40:55,540
Speaker 0: yep See let's say I mean there's nothing preventing me from just making a certificate and setting it up.

668
00:40:55,822 --> 00:40:57,600
Speaker 1: They're called self-signed certificates.

669
00:40:57,741 --> 00:40:59,735
Speaker 1: I make the certificate and I sign.

670
00:40:59,776 --> 00:41:00,400
Speaker 1: that is legitimate.

671
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:07,212
Speaker 1: But web browsers because of the way the internet is Basically like you know those locks are the special things that they'll show.

672
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:14,340
Speaker 1: like Firefox now has that nice like blue Bar that appears next to the URL to show they have a lock and they have an extra special lock.

673
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:15,645
Speaker 0: It's like the double lock.

674
00:41:15,946 --> 00:41:22,170
Speaker 1: basically you can't get that unless you pay one of these companies for their Certificate or get them to sign your certificate.

675
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,860
Speaker 0: Yes, basically it doesn't cause them any money to do it all they do.

676
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:38,891
Speaker 0: It's just like you're paying for a rubber stamp a lot of money for a rubber stamp And you have to pay for it over and over again because your rubber stamp expires And they charge a lot for it now And it's technologically No Different at all from your own rubber stamp that you can.

677
00:41:38,912 --> 00:41:42,163
Speaker 0: just I could spit out like a million of these things in a second With like a shell script.

678
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,790
Speaker 0: right now the thing is right.

679
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:47,719
Speaker 0: if I rubber stamp my own certificate right.

680
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,450
Speaker 0: well How do you know that you know it's really me.

681
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,458
Speaker 0: I could just use it on whatever freaking website.

682
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:58,500
Speaker 0: I want Right there's no guarantee that you know the certificate is actually for reals.

683
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,463
Speaker 0: It is totally safe.

684
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:03,578
Speaker 0: You're basically these rubber stamps from these companies are basically you know okay?

685
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,620
Speaker 0: We are Verisign and we guarantee that this is really Scott Rubin, and it's really front row crew calm stamp.

686
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:16,216
Speaker 0: So it's basically you know if you see a certificate of my site that I side is.

687
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:17,460
Speaker 0: basically you have to decide.

688
00:42:17,864 --> 00:42:18,490
Speaker 0: Do you trust me?

689
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:28,760
Speaker 0: But you know if you trust Verisign this company with rubber stamps Then you don't need to worry about whether you trust me or not because you know the Verisign is trustworthy.

690
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:33,966
Speaker 0: So really it's sort of like this trust in Economic network.

691
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,739
Speaker 0: in a way you're paying for trust and you're trusting people who pay money.

692
00:42:39,362 --> 00:42:40,124
Speaker 1: Now the real.

693
00:42:40,305 --> 00:42:51,660
Speaker 1: this wasn't a problem until relatively recently in general because pretty much It was the kind of this cost of doing business and the only people who really use this sort of thing were Businesses that had we're collecting credit card information or something like that

694
00:42:52,521 --> 00:43:00,326
Speaker 0: And the only people doing real e-commerce cared about it and anyone who's doing real e-commerce is making money because they're selling stuff And they could afford to have

695
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:08,839
Speaker 1: this dual problem of people using shoddy certificates and bad Urls to get people or you know fall you know spurious domains like amazon dot

696
00:43:08,939 --> 00:43:09,100
Speaker 0: com.

697
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,500
Speaker 0: You know you ever go to a website, and it says like the certificate has expired the certificate may be fake.

698
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:16,560
Speaker 0: That's because someone doesn't want to pay up, or they're legit.

699
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,440
Speaker 0: They're actually you know crooks, and they're trying to or they're incompetent.

700
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:20,360
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of reasons.

701
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,444
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of reasons.

702
00:43:21,504 --> 00:43:27,691
Speaker 1: the problem really is that one there's so many issues that this is kind of just like This show is basically just.

703
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:29,300
Speaker 1: I was kind of getting all the issues out there.

704
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,117
Speaker 1: We can't really talk about any of them in super depth because each one deserves an entire Monday show in and of itself.

705
00:43:34,137 --> 00:43:35,585
Speaker 0: basically also Just you know.

706
00:43:35,605 --> 00:43:41,960
Speaker 0: to sum up the episode in case you don't listen anymore We're pissed because we have to pay a whole fucking ton of money if we want to have one of these things.

707
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:42,969
Speaker 1: It's not that much money.

708
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:44,140
Speaker 0: It's a lot of money.

709
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,144
Speaker 0: It's like hundreds of dollars.

710
00:43:45,506 --> 00:43:48,438
Speaker 1: There are a place like anything start SSL, which will actually give you one for free.

711
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:51,695
Speaker 0: really That's nice, and they're just really work in all the browsers.

712
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:52,680
Speaker 1: it works in most browsers.

713
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:53,904
Speaker 1: They're pretty well trusted.

714
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,815
Speaker 0: and can I get the double plus lock or just the regular lock?

715
00:43:57,056 --> 00:43:58,160
Speaker 1: probably just the regular lock.

716
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want the double plus lock.

717
00:43:59,392 --> 00:44:00,098
Speaker 1: that one cost more.

718
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:13,460
Speaker 1: Because and they're always like that to pay money to make a symbol appear in a web browser at the same time It's only it's this kind of barrier to entry the old keep the riffraff out to where only legitimate kind of legitimate businesses can get them.

719
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:19,040
Speaker 0: But yeah think about the cost of this to Amazon is basically zero compared to what they add the money they actually have.

720
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:26,489
Speaker 0: but the cost of it to someone like me who's you know just running a little old website is Enormous compared to my hosting cost now.

721
00:44:26,590 --> 00:44:27,755
Speaker 1: It's tricky because on one hand.

722
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:37,579
Speaker 1: It's a little anti-competitive It's kind of this downward pressure against startups but the other hand it really stops a lot of the very trivial attacks that would bring the whole system down.

723
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:47,057
Speaker 1: because To get that lock cost so much money that if you're making a million spoofers spam domains You can't afford to do that because the margins on scamming already so low.

724
00:44:47,077 --> 00:44:54,260
Speaker 1: yep So but the one of the real issues here is that because it's kind of this You know it's not a scarce supply anymore.

725
00:44:55,124 --> 00:45:02,537
Speaker 1: I feel like the solution is that don't registrar should basically give Certificates to whoever buys a domain from them, and that's the end of it.

726
00:45:02,919 --> 00:45:03,702
Speaker 0: yes I agree.

727
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:08,239
Speaker 0: however the problem is you know if a domain changes hands or if a domain expires they have to revoke.

728
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:15,345
Speaker 1: the Certificate should automatically expire at the intervals of the domain expiring yep And they issue new ones.

729
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:16,855
Speaker 1: as they are they should expire.

730
00:45:16,935 --> 00:45:17,720
Speaker 0: I completely agree.

731
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:28,200
Speaker 0: You should just get a perfect SSL certificate with the domain And then it's up to you the person who runs the website not to like share the certificate around or do it the wrong way.

732
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:30,589
Speaker 1: But there's this whole extra problem on the side of that.

733
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:35,774
Speaker 1: in the old days if the certificate was self-signed either It would just accept it or pop up a little warning.

734
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:36,298
Speaker 1: you click ok.

735
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:54,717
Speaker 1: But Most of the time a self-signed certificate or a shoddy certificate means either you're at Amazon instead of Amazon Or you're on a corporate internet that didn't want to pay for a certificate And or you're on some guy's website who just wanted to have like e-commerce now.

736
00:45:54,737 --> 00:45:55,320
Speaker 0: Here's the thing though.

737
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,825
Speaker 0: Let's say we give a certificate to everyone right couldn't we just make the whole web as is L Like everything.

738
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,109
Speaker 1: there is a performance hit.

739
00:46:03,189 --> 00:46:05,416
Speaker 0: there is a performance hit and there's no reason to.

740
00:46:05,497 --> 00:46:10,660
Speaker 0: the other problem with it I think is that let's say everyone gets one of these and everyone makes everything secure, right?

741
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,590
Speaker 0: Well, then it's like well the lock is always locked.

742
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,152
Speaker 0: So how do I?

743
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,600
Speaker 0: there's no safe and unsafe situation?

744
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:20,254
Speaker 1: Well, it also gets a lot of the power down to the point of.

745
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:21,800
Speaker 1: did I type the URL, right?

746
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,402
Speaker 1: I don't know.

747
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:29,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of power in the SSL now and that most of the time you're browsing the web It's not there, but it's not so when you're safe.

748
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:39,000
Speaker 1: It's like aha there's the law but the root problem is it's never gonna actually be security because doing this Will always end up being security through credit card as opposed to security through obscurity.

749
00:46:39,261 --> 00:46:41,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you don't want security through obscurity or credit card.

750
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,660
Speaker 0: You want security through fucking real security.

751
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,795
Speaker 1: The thing is security through credit card works pretty well in this situation.

752
00:46:46,856 --> 00:46:47,740
Speaker 1: It really does work.

753
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:49,907
Speaker 0: It works better than nothing.

754
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:50,349
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

755
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:52,479
Speaker 1: The problem is this whole separate problem.

756
00:46:53,282 --> 00:47:01,856
Speaker 1: There's an article in slash shot that this study shows that pretty much everyone just fucking ignores This and like they don't even know what that lock means.

757
00:47:01,876 --> 00:47:02,600
Speaker 1: They just ignore it.

758
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean web browsers, you know have been trying to do a better job of.

759
00:47:05,999 --> 00:47:12,580
Speaker 0: you know Changing the user interface of the security like ie if there's a bad ticket will like make the whole location bar red.

760
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:14,960
Speaker 0: You know like Firefox is a lot bigger.

761
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,955
Speaker 0: Firefox is like I mean Netscape used to be this little tiny lock icon in the bottom right.

762
00:47:18,975 --> 00:47:20,665
Speaker 0: that would appear and disappear and now It's nice.

763
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:21,900
Speaker 1: now will be your face.

764
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:29,719
Speaker 1: Hey This movie is bad and it gives you an error and you have to click on like four different things That are in different places to get past it.

765
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,101
Speaker 0: Yep,

766
00:47:30,342 --> 00:47:36,107
Speaker 1: and it seems like the majority of people will just click on anything they can and keep clicking and keep clicking until they get Through because

767
00:47:36,147 --> 00:47:41,655
Speaker 0: that goes back to something that we talked about all the time Which is that most people use computers don't read, you know, there's.

768
00:47:41,695 --> 00:47:44,507
Speaker 0: if there's words on the screen They will not read them whatsoever.

769
00:47:44,527 --> 00:47:45,571
Speaker 0: No matter what the words are.

770
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,716
Speaker 0: It could say warning.

771
00:47:46,736 --> 00:47:47,580
Speaker 0: You're going to die.

772
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:48,553
Speaker 0: The computer will explode.

773
00:47:48,573 --> 00:47:49,059
Speaker 0: they don't read it.

774
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,680
Speaker 0: All they do is if anything pops up at all.

775
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:54,894
Speaker 0: All they do is click and click and click and click until it goes away.

776
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:57,394
Speaker 0: They don't read anything They don't think about right.

777
00:47:57,698 --> 00:48:03,420
Speaker 0: so No amount of popping up or visual cues or anything is ever going to get through to people who don't read.

778
00:48:03,861 --> 00:48:04,323
Speaker 0: See you what?

779
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:09,460
Speaker 0: the only way to actually make SSL work would be to actively say this website is insecure.

780
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:13,719
Speaker 0: Sorry, you can't go here no matter what by and just not let them go no matter what they do.

781
00:48:14,161 --> 00:48:18,140
Speaker 1: But then that basically prevents your web browser from being used on most corporate internets.

782
00:48:18,381 --> 00:48:20,535
Speaker 0: Well, what I would do actually is that's a good.

783
00:48:20,555 --> 00:48:21,340
Speaker 0: that's a good point.

784
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,131
Speaker 0: You brought up about the corporate internets right for a home user.

785
00:48:24,392 --> 00:48:35,082
Speaker 0: maybe doing that is not so necessary but if I had a company I would set up the computers such that no one would be able to visit any site that had an expired or That.

786
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:38,693
Speaker 1: that basically unsolved the problem of how do I?

787
00:48:38,713 --> 00:48:40,960
Speaker 0: well it keeps my company safe for my employees.

788
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,259
Speaker 1: You don't read but you don't need that.

789
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:47,760
Speaker 1: The problem here is that normal people in their normal homes need to know whether or not they're actually on Amazon.

790
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:50,692
Speaker 0: Well, they don't pay attention anyway, so does it really matter?

791
00:48:50,752 --> 00:48:52,199
Speaker 0: they're gonna get fucked no matter what we set up.

792
00:48:52,882 --> 00:48:56,700
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know what to do about it because here's the situation where - if you give them the information.

793
00:48:56,801 --> 00:49:02,952
Speaker 1: Even if they read the pop-up with stuff like certificate They have no idea what it means and there's no way to really explain it.

794
00:49:03,012 --> 00:49:08,211
Speaker 1: because if you give the actual explanation No one's gonna understand what a certificate is or what it means.

795
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:10,500
Speaker 1: and if you give a dumb explanation you dumb it down.

796
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:12,670
Speaker 1: They'll just say what do you mean?

797
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:13,334
Speaker 1: I can't go here.

798
00:49:13,354 --> 00:49:13,917
Speaker 1: It's Amazon.

799
00:49:13,958 --> 00:49:16,560
Speaker 0: Fuck you What I would do is I would put up a series of questions.

800
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:21,037
Speaker 0: Right and the questions would be like are you a hundred percent sure that you're actually Firefox?

801
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:21,780
Speaker 1: basically does that?

802
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,444
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

803
00:49:22,645 --> 00:49:23,752
Speaker 0: people just keep the way it words.

804
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,840
Speaker 0: It is not that plain.

805
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:26,666
Speaker 1: It says there is an error.

806
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:27,730
Speaker 1: do not continue.

807
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:40,740
Speaker 1: and if you and if you just look and you click on like the nice-looking Answer, it doesn't let you go You have to go back and click on the scary-looking X and even then you have to go then it you have to say yes I understand you have to get the certificate.

808
00:49:40,881 --> 00:49:46,706
Speaker 0: So you say are you saying that since people will go through the trouble of visiting the site even with a bad certificate We don't need to pay for the thing.

809
00:49:46,726 --> 00:49:48,453
Speaker 0: We can just use the signed one the self-signed.

810
00:49:48,775 --> 00:49:49,799
Speaker 1: We probably could.

811
00:49:50,942 --> 00:49:54,900
Speaker 0: The problem is it's unprofessional and it is it is very unprofessional.

812
00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:08,260
Speaker 1: It's also a situation where it's your website the system works well enough to where security through credit card Is still pretty viable and if you're gonna do e-commerce today, you should pay for one of these certificates.

813
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:19,060
Speaker 0: Well, I do think though that Well, you know while what we have is okay, and even though we should still try to find a better solution I think that there should be sort of an iron monkey pricing system.

814
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:27,954
Speaker 0: You remember an iron monkey when he's sitting there right and as a rich man who comes to get some medicine and as a homeless Poor man, right and he gives the poor man the free medicine.

815
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:30,849
Speaker 0: and there he tells the rich man It's like 30 tells or whatever.

816
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:33,682
Speaker 0: right and he's like he got the same medicine for free What the fuck.

817
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:36,615
Speaker 0: and he's like, you know, hey rich man, maybe you can't afford it.

818
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:40,519
Speaker 0: and he's like, oh shit He was too proud not to be you know, so he paid him up.

819
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:44,820
Speaker 0: I think that you know, the SSL should cost more for Amazon than it cost for me.

820
00:50:45,081 --> 00:50:49,800
Speaker 1: But then do we differentiate on the user side the difference on the user side?

821
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,688
Speaker 1: Because if you do we're in the same boat.

822
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:52,492
Speaker 1: We're in now doesn't matter.

823
00:50:52,512 --> 00:50:59,760
Speaker 1: This is exactly the same as it is now And if we don't differentiate then I pay zero because I have this, you know, I don't make any money.

824
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,920
Speaker 1: I'm just some guy for Amazon and then I proceed proceed to scan people and make all this money.

825
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:14,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we're in this situation to where the system still works now and is going to continue to work for the foreseeable future and Relatively few people are affected by this.

826
00:51:14,587 --> 00:51:18,038
Speaker 0: It's basically a big old glass house, but the system is someday going to.

827
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:20,270
Speaker 0: it's a big old Tower made of cars someday.

828
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:24,759
Speaker 1: This is basically going to break down Catastrophically balsa wood bridge and I don't know what to do about it.

829
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,662
Speaker 0: What do you know?

830
00:51:25,843 --> 00:51:31,320
Speaker 1: also independently aside from all that it is not trivial to set this shit up in Apache.

831
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,180
Speaker 0: It's moderately Troublesome, I mean, it's only a little bit difficult.

832
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,840
Speaker 1: I know how to do it, but even I have run into problems like I had to set up a chain certificate Which I didn't know even know.

833
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:50,643
Speaker 1: So I had to basically set up our certificate this root certificate and then a chain of authority that went all the way down to my certificates.

834
00:51:50,663 --> 00:51:52,129
Speaker 1: I had these multiple certificates to set up and

835
00:51:52,651 --> 00:52:04,484
Speaker 0: though that's the worst thing is if you got subdomains It's like sometimes you need to get more certificates sometimes you need to get like broader certificates and like if we want to have a different certificate for like forum dot front recruit calm and front row crew calm.

836
00:52:04,524 --> 00:52:06,170
Speaker 1: and also the situation of some.

837
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,796
Speaker 0: we gotta pay again and again and again.

838
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:14,220
Speaker 1: some people who sell certificates are More or less reliable and maybe a browser will stop trusting one certificate authority because they're bad.

839
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,040
Speaker 0: And yeah, like, you know fire for the people you and that's the thing.

840
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,509
Speaker 0: It's like the browsers really need to do something about it.

841
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:22,460
Speaker 0: Like, you know, if the browser let's say I'm Mozilla, right?

842
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,040
Speaker 0: I decide the Verisign is trustworthy, right?

843
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:30,640
Speaker 0: So any certificates that are signed by Verisign are gonna get the green flag in Firefox, right?

844
00:52:31,041 --> 00:52:36,040
Speaker 0: Well, you know, why can't me Scott Rubin why can't I write a letter to Mozilla?

845
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,589
Speaker 0: They should have someone whose job this is right to handle this.

846
00:52:39,131 --> 00:52:41,280
Speaker 0: and I can be like, hey go look at my website.

847
00:52:41,601 --> 00:52:48,417
Speaker 0: Here's my certificate that I made, you know and trust me because you see my website and you approve it even though I didn't pay Verisign any money.

848
00:52:48,477 --> 00:53:01,740
Speaker 0: and they should have a person if they want to be deciding who to trust and who not to in place of the user then I should be able to apply for trust as A person with the website and a certificate to the browser as opposed to to this, you know.

849
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:20,458
Speaker 1: What would be nice is if a certificate authority basically like did all this investigation and hired like private investigators and basically what they did is verify based on P eyes and like spying on you and all sorts of craziness that yes, I certified that the person I gave this certificate to is the person they say they are.

850
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:26,500
Speaker 0: But then once they do you are now trusted and inside and then you can make as many certificates as you want.

851
00:53:27,201 --> 00:53:31,050
Speaker 1: They have to continue to watch you Revoke that certificate.

852
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,319
Speaker 1: the second you fuck up, right?

853
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:36,135
Speaker 0: You'll have a private key that you can use the sign all your certificates.

854
00:53:36,155 --> 00:53:37,440
Speaker 1: that would cost a lot of money.

855
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,791
Speaker 1: And again, no one can pay for that but the rich people.

856
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:42,762
Speaker 0: that's something else to think about right is Right.

857
00:53:42,862 --> 00:53:44,630
Speaker 0: Imagine if you know, I saw it.

858
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:46,900
Speaker 0: Let's pretend it's like some magical fantasy land, right?

859
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,570
Speaker 0: I sign all my certificates.

860
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:49,576
Speaker 0: you sign all yours.

861
00:53:49,677 --> 00:53:50,160
Speaker 0: Joe signs.

862
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,209
Speaker 1: Oh the way PGP is supposed to work, right?

863
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,600
Speaker 0: Everyone signs their own certificates, right?

864
00:53:55,002 --> 00:53:58,860
Speaker 0: And you know, everyone is sort of individually trusted now, right?

865
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,220
Speaker 0: So that means let's say something crazy happens and someone breaks my private key.

866
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,532
Speaker 0: Well only my certificates are in trouble right now.

867
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:12,760
Speaker 0: if I get like the Verisign private key I can fucking make certificates or fucking at all.

868
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:20,060
Speaker 0: The internet is fucked totally fucked and it's only one private key just one Right for like a lot a lot of certificates.

869
00:54:20,321 --> 00:54:29,166
Speaker 0: It would be much more secure if we had lots of different private keys for lots of different certificates from everybody in terms of encryption You know side of the thing.

870
00:54:29,186 --> 00:54:30,189
Speaker 1: Well, here's another.

871
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:38,091
Speaker 1: what if we had trust through consensus to where everyone has their own private key and You can sign or trust other people's keys.

872
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:41,440
Speaker 1: So my private key, I trust the real Amazon certificate.

873
00:54:41,802 --> 00:54:45,158
Speaker 1: So the real Amazon certificate has you know, 10 million people have trusted it.

874
00:54:45,781 --> 00:54:49,279
Speaker 1: Amazon has the 500 people in the small botnet trusting it.

875
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:53,640
Speaker 0: Oh, that wouldn't be bad like because most people, you know, most internet people wouldn't bother it, right?

876
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:02,139
Speaker 0: But all of the web people would go around Trusting certificates like they'd be like walking around with petitions like hey dude from this other website.

877
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,189
Speaker 0: I know you know, trust me.

878
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:06,720
Speaker 0: Hey all my listeners to this podcast.

879
00:55:06,902 --> 00:55:15,260
Speaker 1: Now you need you to sign our certificate and trust us System to where you signing has weight depending on how many people have signed yours in this kind of clusterfuck.

880
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:19,660
Speaker 1: Yeah The problem with that is that who where do my root certificates come from?

881
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,493
Speaker 0: Basically, whoever has the most Twitter followers against the most security?

882
00:55:22,554 --> 00:55:23,780
Speaker 1: not only that but alright.

883
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:28,580
Speaker 1: So I write a spam bot that just generates a billion certificates that all sign each other.

884
00:55:29,127 --> 00:55:29,879
Speaker 1: So that doesn't yeah.

885
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,000
Speaker 0: But the thing is that wouldn't be attached to anyone in your web of trust.

886
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,740
Speaker 0: So your trust level for it would be zero because you had have no connections to that insular network.

887
00:55:38,324 --> 00:55:40,420
Speaker 0: See, it's it's a whole trust network situation.

888
00:55:40,501 --> 00:55:42,700
Speaker 1: The thing is they we can't really get into it.

889
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:48,620
Speaker 1: But the logistics of that and then math of that is I could I could make that in my laboratory.

890
00:55:49,342 --> 00:55:51,200
Speaker 0: Don't ask me to make it for the Internet.

891
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:54,820
Speaker 1: So that would be one of those like everyone bands together for peace and prosperity.

892
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:57,633
Speaker 0: I can make it in my laboratory and it would be like.

893
00:55:57,653 --> 00:56:01,066
Speaker 0: that would be the kind of thing you would give someone is Like a CS project in college.

894
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:05,220
Speaker 0: It would not be something that you would actually be able to make happen in the world.

895
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:09,152
Speaker 0: It'd be like, you know, it'd be a good like question like here's the web of trust.

896
00:56:09,494 --> 00:56:11,120
Speaker 0: how much should Joe trust Jake?

897
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:15,520
Speaker 0: You know, he's like, well Joe should just shake three three trust three trust.

898
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:19,285
Speaker 0: Much you know Mary.

899
00:56:19,365 --> 00:56:20,588
Speaker 0: trust, you know Jake.

900
00:56:20,649 --> 00:56:24,880
Speaker 0: now that Jay, you know, Joe doesn't trust Jake anymore zero trust.

901
00:56:25,001 --> 00:56:26,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like one other way.

902
00:56:27,422 --> 00:56:28,144
Speaker 1: The you know.

903
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:30,652
Speaker 1: again what this really comes down to is identity.

904
00:56:31,053 --> 00:56:32,578
Speaker 1: and way back and open everything.

905
00:56:32,618 --> 00:56:33,220
Speaker 1: New York City.

906
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:38,060
Speaker 1: Was it 2008 was 2009?

907
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:39,568
Speaker 1: It was eight because it was still warm out.

908
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,800
Speaker 1: was it or was it not that long ago?

909
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:42,402
Speaker 1: And I'm just.

910
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:43,386
Speaker 1: and maybe it was spring.

911
00:56:43,406 --> 00:56:44,690
Speaker 0: I think it was spring.

912
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,437
Speaker 1: I don't already don't remember.

913
00:56:46,477 --> 00:56:47,320
Speaker 0: I think it was spring.

914
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,024
Speaker 0: I'll say all nine.

915
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,230
Speaker 1: I was wearing the shirt like yesterday.

916
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:51,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, the first open everything, New York City.

917
00:56:52,122 --> 00:57:12,568
Speaker 1: one of the things that I brought up and talked about a great deal was the idea that In the future going forward the most important thing to solve on the internet and in the world is identity and the most important commodity in the world is being able to prove reliably who you are and What it really comes down to is when everyone is born.

918
00:57:12,608 --> 00:57:16,260
Speaker 1: They need to be given a USB key that has their private key.

919
00:57:16,401 --> 00:57:17,849
Speaker 0: What about are you doing USBs done?

920
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:20,706
Speaker 1: Well, you know when I say USB key I mean whatever technology.

921
00:57:20,726 --> 00:57:22,376
Speaker 1: at the time we implant a chip in you out.

922
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:23,020
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

923
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,120
Speaker 1: You have to have scaling technology to where everyone is issued a private key.

924
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:33,670
Speaker 1: That is used the way social security numbers are now and you sign things with that And if you lose it you have to report it to the government.

925
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,442
Speaker 1: then they revoke it and then they give you a new One.

926
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:40,783
Speaker 1: maybe you have to reapply for it every ten years the same way to your driver's license And it expires.

927
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:41,807
Speaker 1: and all that sort of business.

928
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:50,480
Speaker 1: and until we have some sort of thing like that There's basically no way to solve this or a thousand other internet problems, you know.

929
00:57:50,540 --> 00:58:06,439
Speaker 0: And in fact, actually if you think about it, right if the government set up some sort of private key system for every citizen You know, it had all the public keys in this giant database and everyone had their own private key in some secure fashion The government a lot of the government's other work would go away

930
00:58:07,163 --> 00:58:07,524
Speaker 1: You know

931
00:58:07,565 --> 00:58:12,250
Speaker 0: like to be a lot of things these wouldn't have to do if they could set that up and make it work Like a lot of other things.

932
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,339
Speaker 0: they wouldn't have to do so much.

933
00:58:13,842 --> 00:58:17,720
Speaker 0: They would just be really easy because you just use the private keys and public keys for it like the mail.

934
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:18,802
Speaker 0: He's just.

935
00:58:18,842 --> 00:58:19,103
Speaker 0: you know.

936
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:22,154
Speaker 0: private keys send mail, you know, Oh driver's licenses.

937
00:58:22,174 --> 00:58:27,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't need a driver's license ID You know, oh, you know, you know everyone, you know signing things.

938
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:28,895
Speaker 0: notaries wouldn't need.

939
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:30,420
Speaker 0: him wouldn't need the whole notary thing at all.

940
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,980
Speaker 0: I forget his notarize everything themselves by digitally signing it.

941
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:38,517
Speaker 1: If you did it with an issued private key that was hashed with some security wouldn't need some biometric.

942
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:43,126
Speaker 1: Then you eliminate pretty much every Bay, oh great.

943
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,111
Speaker 1: We've solved everything.

944
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't need some security cards We don't.

945
00:58:46,444 --> 00:58:48,600
Speaker 0: you know taxes got to fill out all these tax forms.

946
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:53,440
Speaker 0: I mean when you fill out taxes today, you still need to write down name address, right?

947
00:58:53,661 --> 00:59:01,294
Speaker 0: Imagine you just did your taxes and you just you know, signed it with your private key and then the you know The IRS, you know took a public key and set up.

948
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:01,515
Speaker 0: Yep.

949
00:59:01,555 --> 00:59:02,520
Speaker 0: This was definitely written.

950
00:59:04,182 --> 00:59:13,779
Speaker 1: How bullshit is it that I signed something with my pen and Fax it and it's more reliable than like a PGP signature because people in court don't understand signatures and contracts.

951
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:24,640
Speaker 0: Everything would be easy because if you signed a contract Provable that you signed it and I was digging around in my trash They found some mail that was thrown away and they applied for a credit card in my name.

952
00:59:25,223 --> 00:59:27,114
Speaker 0: If they don't have my private key, how could they sign it?

953
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:32,896
Speaker 0: They can't Right, you know all these problems just go away if they would do this one thing.

954
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:33,599
Speaker 0: That's it.

955
00:59:34,081 --> 00:59:38,280
Speaker 0: However, then people worried about like, you know government ID systems and all that sort of stuff.

956
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:47,553
Speaker 0: Basically, all we're doing is give everyone everyone a number that you hold on to and never have to show to anyone In fact never should show to anyone and should never be.

957
00:59:47,814 --> 00:59:52,451
Speaker 0: well under no circumstances Ever be forced to show it to anyone.

958
00:59:52,752 --> 00:59:57,500
Speaker 0: court judge police government official Nobody will you ever have to show that number?

959
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:07,014
Speaker 0: All you will ever be required to do is sign things with the number then hand over the signed Thing which can then be verified with the public key.

960
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:16,470
Speaker 0: you will and you know And in fact, you'll be strongly encouraged never to show the private key to anyone not even family members Not even your own mother and nobody zero

961
01:00:17,293 --> 01:00:17,855
Speaker 1: and in fact,

962
01:00:17,936 --> 01:00:18,960
Speaker 0: so it's not like, you know

963
01:00:21,004 --> 01:00:25,180
Speaker 1: Obviously, we can't have the midwife every time a cat child is born give them their key and then kill them.

964
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:25,422
Speaker 1: So

965
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:51,480
Speaker 0: now you'd have to have some sort of system where like, you know Eventually, you're not gonna need this number when you're in say elementary school, you know, maybe right We'll have some sort of system where you know, you go into a booth and it you know It's a sealed booth and the machine generates the key puts the private public key in a database Prints out the private key somehow to give to you onto a device or a Piece of paper who knows what and then erases it from its memory and then you step out of the booth.

966
01:00:51,988 --> 01:00:52,579
Speaker 0: It's that simple.

967
01:00:53,403 --> 01:01:01,720
Speaker 0: There you go done And you could use that to sign your SSL search on your website and people would know, you know That was definitely signed by this person.

968
01:01:01,901 --> 01:01:05,219
Speaker 0: If there's a discrepancy they could look up in the government and you know.

969
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,163
Speaker 0: Well, you are.

970
01:01:06,344 --> 01:01:08,635
Speaker 1: we've solved the problem that for the first time on gig nights.

971
01:01:08,656 --> 01:01:09,138
Speaker 1: We solved it.

972
01:01:09,218 --> 01:01:09,520
Speaker 1: It's done.

973
01:01:10,663 --> 01:01:12,334
