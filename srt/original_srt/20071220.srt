00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,658
Speaker 1: Nobles you mean like an RC pro-am the tires that you buy after you buy the regular tires.

7
00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:38,089
Speaker 0: Oh, man I never got good tires.

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,099
Speaker 0: I was went for the big engines.

9
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,920
Speaker 1: Oh, you gotta buy the good tires are you also in addition to the big engines?

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:48,385
Speaker 0: You're not gonna win, but no no no not that kind of Nobles a much more Fun kind of knobbly.

11
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:50,675
Speaker 1: I don't know what's more fun than RC pro.

12
00:00:50,735 --> 00:00:51,820
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play RC program right now.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,207
Speaker 1: Why isn't that on the virtual console?

14
00:00:53,227 --> 00:00:53,710
Speaker 1: god damn it?

15
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:55,560
Speaker 0: It should be I'd pay for half of it.

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,045
Speaker 0: That's why I'm too.

17
00:00:57,085 --> 00:01:01,380
Speaker 0: at least RC program and RC program - we're pretty much some of my favorite racing games ever.

18
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,165
Speaker 1: Yep, all right.

19
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:04,299
Speaker 0: Can did we even talk about that in the racing games show?

20
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,105
Speaker 1: I think I did bring it up.

21
00:01:06,326 --> 00:01:08,315
Speaker 0: I hope so if we did not feel quickly.

22
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:17,914
Speaker 0: yeah, but yeah We've been limping along here at geek nights for the last 420 some episodes with the mixer we bought at the start of it.

23
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,623
Speaker 0: all that you be 802 You're a wreck.

24
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:21,245
Speaker 1: Well.

25
00:01:21,566 --> 00:01:23,913
Speaker 1: We actually before that didn't have a mixer at all.

26
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:38,600
Speaker 0: well before that we had a Logitech free stick microphone that I pointed straight up on one side of the room with a gain turned all the way up on my Sound Blaster like ancient PCI card that I've had since my first real computer.

27
00:01:39,122 --> 00:01:41,533
Speaker 1: And still the sound card we're using that is still the sound cover.

28
00:01:41,553 --> 00:01:44,024
Speaker 1: you need to do something about that's the part We really need to fix.

29
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,833
Speaker 0: yeah, but I think I fixed that.

30
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,280
Speaker 0: we'll see we'll find out.

31
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:49,220
Speaker 0: But this little mixer has done us really well.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:02:00,112
Speaker 0: I mean if you're not some sort of crazy like Podcaster who cares and just goes nuts and does for her if you don't have a lot of people You really don't need much more than the UV 802 or the equivalent.

33
00:02:00,132 --> 00:02:02,900
Speaker 0: You know it's got two microphone pre amplifiers and all that business.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,330
Speaker 0: But over the years we upgraded We got a little compressor to go along with that and then we learned that compressor wasn't so great And we lost the power cable to it.

35
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,199
Speaker 0: I think I lost the power cable to it.

36
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,799
Speaker 0: So we bought a real compressor Realized that it was a thousand times better.

37
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:23,900
Speaker 0: And yet we never upgraded the mixer and every now and then we thought hey we got a bunch of people over.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,036
Speaker 0: let's get them all on the show.

39
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,119
Speaker 0: and That always sucked.

40
00:02:28,062 --> 00:02:29,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it always did quite and kind of suck.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,440
Speaker 1: I mean I third microphone always sound like shit And that was even worse because the person using it was the person who had the least experience using it.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,656
Speaker 0: Yep, so we had to give all the other people crap.

43
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:39,140
Speaker 0: you might remember.

44
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,207
Speaker 0: I think Otacon was probably the worst ever.

45
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:44,620
Speaker 0: we had like seven people and we wanted to do a roundtable, right?

46
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:54,290
Speaker 0: we had our two like okay microphones and then like crap microphones and There's only two microphone inputs on this thing.

47
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:59,595
Speaker 0: so I had him plugged into like all these other holes And I just turned the faders all the way up, and it didn't work at all.

48
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,600
Speaker 0: that sounded like crap.

49
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:12,934
Speaker 0: It was quite the shit but not good, you know Scott has a good job, and I have a good job and I Realized suddenly that I can buy stuff if stuff is better, and I want it.

50
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,138
Speaker 0: I can just buy it.

51
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:15,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why.

52
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:19,517
Speaker 1: you know all the other podcasters and like webcomic people in such-and-such.

53
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:25,758
Speaker 1: They're always like donate to me so I can get all this nice stuff and improve the things I'm doing for you for free.

54
00:03:25,798 --> 00:03:29,353
Speaker 1: and we're like We have jobs and we can just afford all those things.

55
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:30,620
Speaker 1: do those other people not have job?

56
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,423
Speaker 0: That's kind of low.

57
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,430
Speaker 0: I mean not everyone is an IT professional.

58
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,300
Speaker 1: No, but they whatever they are they should have a good job.

59
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's the deal.

60
00:03:39,557 --> 00:03:42,308
Speaker 0: the real deal There is that you don't need better stuff.

61
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:48,372
Speaker 0: usually geek nights would probably be just fine if we kept using this Ancient like $60 mixer forever.

62
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:49,759
Speaker 1: then what the hell am I giving you money for?

63
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:52,931
Speaker 0: Well because we we decided we wanted to do more.

64
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:55,000
Speaker 0: I think you decided yeah, and you know what?

65
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:58,440
Speaker 0: I actually bought more of a mixer than you thought I was going to and I'm gonna pay the difference.

66
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:01,455
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but now I'm giving you money, so you can play with knobbly's.

67
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:02,079
Speaker 1: and what do I get?

68
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:02,360
Speaker 1: nothing?

69
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,544
Speaker 0: Ah, you know you get.

70
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:13,840
Speaker 0: the next time we want to have a roundtable or an interview You don't have to sit there for 20 minutes while I hold four Microphones in front of my mouth yelling into him and moving a bunch of knobs on a crappy mixer.

71
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:19,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, but instead I have to suffer you now Fiddling with knobs and yelling all weekend.

72
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 0: see this luckily aren't you going out of town Saturday morning?

73
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,245
Speaker 1: That's only one day.

74
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,013
Speaker 1: It's always takes you like weeks to do this shit.

75
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:25,435
Speaker 0: You know.

76
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:26,380
Speaker 0: I don't think it will this time.

77
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:35,710
Speaker 0: I think I know enough about mixers at this point to where I can just because part of the reason it took so long before is that I Didn't know a lot about mixers when I first got this stuff.

78
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:45,960
Speaker 0: and now I know that there's certain things a mixer can have that makes Podcasting a million times easier, and I made sure I got a mixer that freaking has that alrighty ah.

79
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:51,164
Speaker 0: But I now have sitting next to me a Zenix 1832 fxpro.

80
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:54,240
Speaker 0: this thing is a lot bigger than it looked on the website.

81
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:56,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how things tend to go.

82
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:57,660
Speaker 1: I mean look at my subwoofer.

83
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:58,951
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the best.

84
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:00,000
Speaker 0: Scott got this nothing.

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,154
Speaker 0: We've talked about this before but he needed speakers for his computer And he wanted to get good ones and he showed me what he was getting.

86
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,299
Speaker 0: I thought wow that looks pretty good.

87
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:15,539
Speaker 0: And he used to get home from work before me back then and he messages me, and he's like There's a refrigerator box here, and I think it's my speakers.

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,637
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to know the speakers I have Do they still make them?

89
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:23,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, there.

90
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,607
Speaker 1: It is the Logitech z5500.

91
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:27,395
Speaker 1: I got it for like 200 bucks.

92
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:28,358
Speaker 0: They're good speakers.

93
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:28,800
Speaker 1: They're right.

94
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,441
Speaker 1: They're amazing.

95
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:36,126
Speaker 1: you can even use them for like your living room, but but the subwoofer is much bigger than If you think it is.

96
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,040
Speaker 0: now you might look at it and say no it looks pretty big.

97
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,167
Speaker 0: I think I know how big that is.

98
00:05:40,268 --> 00:05:41,597
Speaker 0: it's bigger than you think it is.

99
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:45,091
Speaker 1: the Z5500 subwoofer is like as big as an ottoman.

100
00:05:46,015 --> 00:05:56,326
Speaker 0: I rest my feet on it But I'm staring at this mixer now, and I have such a desire to start fiddling with it So fiddling with the knobs.

101
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,534
Speaker 0: so excuse me if I trail off periodically.

102
00:05:58,554 --> 00:05:59,678
Speaker 1: all right anyway.

103
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:05,100
Speaker 1: today I think maybe yesterday the Firefox 3 beta 2 came out all right.

104
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:08,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, wasn't that right about the time when you were having some weird Firefox crashes.

105
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:22,630
Speaker 1: No well not really but anyway Firefox 2 is generally just being kind of shitty like I really wanted to stop using it because it takes up so much memory and It's unstable Etc, etc.

106
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:27,900
Speaker 1: It's it's slow You know and the other browsers are better, but I have this sort of dependence.

107
00:06:28,061 --> 00:06:28,743
Speaker 1: I can't live.

108
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:35,940
Speaker 1: I can't do anything without certain Firefox extensions like I can use a different browser But I need firebug I need adblock.

109
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:40,698
Speaker 1: I need these extensions more than I need Firefox and but those things only work with Firefox.

110
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,308
Speaker 0: luckily I use very few extensions.

111
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,557
Speaker 1: That's good, but I need a lot of those extensions.

112
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:47,651
Speaker 0: web development I get pretty much.

113
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,257
Speaker 0: I use Fark.

114
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,023
Speaker 0: it a delicious plug-in.

115
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:50,966
Speaker 0: doesn't matter which one.

116
00:06:51,027 --> 00:06:57,425
Speaker 0: I pretty much install a different one everywhere I go cuz I always forget which one I use and I think that's it now.

117
00:06:57,707 --> 00:06:58,590
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I'd blocked off.

118
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,160
Speaker 1: I use like Google browser sync and stuff like that.

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,754
Speaker 0: So yeah, I haven't posted on Fark in like a month, so I don't think I need Fark it anymore.

120
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:07,880
Speaker 1: Nope, but yeah.

121
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,966
Speaker 1: So I start using Firefox 3 beta 2.

122
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:18,668
Speaker 1: I set up like a separate Firefox profile for it and whatever and I'm using it and I can say that I wouldn't recommend anyone.

123
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:23,666
Speaker 1: go and use it yet because it's still sort of beta and you have to do tricky Stuff to keep it from ruining your stuff.

124
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:27,238
Speaker 1: you got now and most of the extensions you depend on will not work with it.

125
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:34,919
Speaker 1: Like adblock works with it just fine But like firebug you have to go get a special version of it and no no other extension worked at all.

126
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:36,868
Speaker 1: The plugins work just fine.

127
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:51,355
Speaker 1: You said to install them, but I I can tell you that when Firefox 3 finally comes out it is going to be the return to what made Firefox great the Fastness and the stableness and the not using so much memory and the wicked fast JavaScript and all that.

128
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,019
Speaker 1: so the outlook is good.

129
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:54,810
Speaker 1: Are you gonna do some news?

130
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:55,938
Speaker 0: I think we should I?

131
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,766
Speaker 0: Wasn't sure what to talk about?

132
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:12,985
Speaker 0: I mean usually there's a news that just jumps out like oh, I got to talk about this I got opinions about this but I'm kind of avoiding stating all my opinions in the US political arena until we eventually do a show about all that business and There wasn't really anything.

133
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,958
Speaker 0: I mean my opinions are kind of known on a lot of issues.

134
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,845
Speaker 0: at this point I mean pretty much any news I bring up.

135
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,654
Speaker 0: half of you out there who listen can say oh I know what rims gonna say about.

136
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:28,720
Speaker 0: that Kind of defeats the purpose of doing commentary on news because I at least I hope that we are not your primary source of news.

137
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:33,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope not kind of like The Daily Show where more people get their news than probably should.

138
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:47,480
Speaker 0: but so Japan's defense minister is Arguing lately that perhaps Japan should take a more active role in Military affairs worldwide and this has been an issue for a long time.

139
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,025
Speaker 0: I mean for those of you who are unaware.

140
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:59,160
Speaker 0: ever since World War two Japan has had a constitutional prohibition From having a military except for very specific and somewhat ambiguous defensive purposes.

141
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:09,831
Speaker 0: Now there's been a lot of read first president of Japan or a history textbook that both One of them might be a little more accurate Wikipedia.

142
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:13,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, all three.

143
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:22,900
Speaker 0: then you'll be set either that really have three different ideas of what's going on, yeah so Japan has been taking more and more of a role in world affairs.

144
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,205
Speaker 0: I mean a lot of people.

145
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:28,480
Speaker 0: there's pretty much arguments on both sides that well, really there's three sides of the arguments.

146
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:40,153
Speaker 0: there's one group of people who argue that Japan should remain completely pacifist as a model for the world and as this ideal that yes, It's possible as long as people aren't all bastards will be pacifist and the u.s.

147
00:09:40,193 --> 00:09:52,280
Speaker 0: Is pretty much bound to protect Japan from anything Yep, but there's another group of people who say Japan Has gotten past World War two and that maybe they're not the threat to the world that they once were.

148
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:59,600
Speaker 0: That's true also and that perhaps Japan being a nation kind of like Germany who had lost.

149
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:01,793
Speaker 1: Where you're going with this is Larry's?

150
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:06,680
Speaker 0: Yeah People who had known that, you know, they've known warfare.

151
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,565
Speaker 0: they engaged this nation.

152
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:22,659
Speaker 0: not the individual people because not that many people are still alive who went through all that in World War two, but a nation that fought a war like that and lost and now can enter the world as a Fairly objective peacekeeping force.

153
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:38,060
Speaker 0: I mean I think the Japanese to the JSDF as a peacekeeping UN kind of force would probably be fantastic and I can see an argument for Japan taking a wider role in purely peacekeeping or purely humanitarian efforts worldwide.

154
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:39,027
Speaker 1: Yep.

155
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:47,865
Speaker 0: Now there's the third argument here that Japan should Militarized for right-wing crazy reasons.

156
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:50,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's bad now.

157
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:56,097
Speaker 0: I Generally disapprove of this but luckily so do most rational people except katsu now.

158
00:10:56,137 --> 00:11:02,295
Speaker 0: There is a fourth Argument here that is surprisingly gaining more traction than I would have expected.

159
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:03,700
Speaker 1: I haven't heard of a fourth argument.

160
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,724
Speaker 1: What this news to me?

161
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaker 0: Well, this fourth argument has been put forth by two high-ups in the current I guess cabinet of Japan's government.

162
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:14,777
Speaker 0: Alright, so the most recent person to bring this up is Japan's defense minister.

163
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,845
Speaker 0: the current one Oh, is she Bob?

164
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:21,100
Speaker 1: So it's not like the equivalent of old rummy but in Japan something like that.

165
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,980
Speaker 0: I'll admit that my understanding of Japanese politics comes down to what I read in sanctuary coupled with first president of Japan.

166
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:27,748
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

167
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:37,396
Speaker 0: So, uh Yeah, but I know they don't have a president because FPOJ was about them getting one Yep, and and I know it's pronounced deed and that's about as far as I got.

168
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:37,817
Speaker 1: That's it.

169
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:43,528
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah It's all old men - oh and they have prefectures So that each guy comes from some brief.

170
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:46,760
Speaker 0: you learned that from initial D more so than from anything else.

171
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,433
Speaker 1: I knew they had prefectures before initial D.

172
00:11:48,837 --> 00:12:07,584
Speaker 0: But yeah anyway, so Shigeru Ishiba is arguing that perhaps the US imposed 1947 pacifist constitution might be a great hindrance if ever aliens invade in Japan has to fight them off Uh-huh.

173
00:12:07,745 --> 00:12:08,629
Speaker 0: I don't think he's kidding.

174
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,100
Speaker 1: Is he sure he's talking about Chinese, right?

175
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,014
Speaker 0: I think he's talking about little green men green men.

176
00:12:16,134 --> 00:12:17,439
Speaker 0: So maybe blue men.

177
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,902
Speaker 1: So Atlanteans and Iceland.

178
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,126
Speaker 0: Ian's I'm I'm.

179
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:27,439
Speaker 0: I guess I could make some jokes that I'm not gonna make but I'm trying the best I can here.

180
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:31,030
Speaker 0: If they here's a quote from him.

181
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:38,079
Speaker 0: if they descended saying say people of Earth let's make friends it would not be considered an urgent unjust attack on our country.

182
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:44,260
Speaker 0: and There's another issue of how we can convey our intention intentions if we don't understand what they are saying.

183
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:46,789
Speaker 0: We should consider various possibilities.

184
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,913
Speaker 0: There's no need to do this in the defense ministry But I want to consider what to do by myself.

185
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:57,649
Speaker 0: blah blah blah blah Yeah, I don't think this is a joke.

186
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:18,080
Speaker 0: and unless there's some crazy Mistranslation where he's using UFO in the correct sense to mean an Unidentified intrusion into Japanese airspace, which I don't think he is Then yeah Yeah, all I can say is that as bad as the u.s.

187
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:30,279
Speaker 1: Is and as stupid as a lot of our politicians are right the worst they do is like You know being corrupt or evil or bad or invade and occupy multiple foreign countries and that's great.

188
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:33,179
Speaker 1: But they they not you never get.

189
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:37,033
Speaker 1: Where's the last time you thought something stupid on this kind of stupid in the

190
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:37,475
Speaker 1: u.s.?

191
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,519
Speaker 0: All throughout the Cold War?

192
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:53,256
Speaker 0: Yeah in the Cold War all throughout the Cold War Not since then a lot a lot of craziness happened during Vietnam and also, you know I can argue and was during the Cold War Well near the end the Vietnam as a separate entity from the Cold War.

193
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:55,071
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the specific Subconflict.

194
00:13:55,314 --> 00:14:00,520
Speaker 0: Mmm I mean when I say Cold War, I guess I meant the kind of high-level strategic ideals of the Cold War.

195
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:07,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean like since you know The wall came down you never see like high up US government people saying anything.

196
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,200
Speaker 1: That's crazy bad shit on this kind of level.

197
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:29,818
Speaker 0: um I would argue that I would rather have this kind of level because if Rummy and all those people Were arguing about whether or not we should have a defense force capable of fighting off aliens Instead of say invading and occupying multiple foreign countries and hostile nations and such for no good reason.

198
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:32,740
Speaker 0: I I'd rather be arguing about the aliens.

199
00:14:34,362 --> 00:14:37,973
Speaker 1: Is it better to have smart evil people in charge or stupid?

200
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:38,976
Speaker 1: Well-meaning people?

201
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,280
Speaker 0: You know what?

202
00:14:41,863 --> 00:14:42,747
Speaker 0: I don't know anymore.

203
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right that's the dilemma.

204
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:47,106
Speaker 0: now I can make a high-level argument.

205
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,953
Speaker 1: at least our evil people aren't stupid.

206
00:14:48,993 --> 00:14:49,816
Speaker 1: They're they're evil.

207
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:50,720
Speaker 1: They know what's going on.

208
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:55,092
Speaker 0: I would argue that intelligent people should consider all possibilities.

209
00:14:55,493 --> 00:15:05,820
Speaker 1: and when considering I mean if I had a government I would have some sort of plan somewhere to file, you know, sure It doesn't hurt to write a plan if this crazy thing that's not impossible happens.

210
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,525
Speaker 0: The US is famous for that.

211
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:12,360
Speaker 0: the US has detailed plans for pretty much every possible world situation.

212
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:16,200
Speaker 0: Some of the plans might suck but we do this partly as a military exercise.

213
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,480
Speaker 0: It's something that you know students of military strategy You know as an assignment.

214
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:29,691
Speaker 0: The assignment will be something like you guys get together and come up with what to do if we suddenly needed to invade Canada because they had nukes.

215
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:32,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, just cuz you know, the US makes a plan about everything.

216
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,484
Speaker 1: So sometimes people see that.

217
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,490
Speaker 1: Oh the US made a plan about this.

218
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,453
Speaker 1: That's gonna happen.

219
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:37,537
Speaker 1: No, it's just.

220
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:38,680
Speaker 1: they do make plans about everything.

221
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:39,313
Speaker 1: That's what they do.

222
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:52,900
Speaker 0: But now and intelligent people you have to consider the possibility of an unforeseen Alien threat and I say alien to mean on like completely unforeseeable alien in the absolute alien sense.

223
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:57,633
Speaker 0: But I think this guy is not taking it on that intellectual.

224
00:15:57,753 --> 00:16:02,306
Speaker 1: no, he's definitely got a Marvin the Martian Thermal detonator kind of action.

225
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:07,825
Speaker 0: So he's only the second Japanese official in this cabinet to Argue about this.

226
00:16:08,046 --> 00:16:15,110
Speaker 0: to quote chief cabinet secretary Nobutaka Machimura Personally, I believe they exist.

227
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:17,439
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

228
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:27,038
Speaker 1: all those Crazy conspiracy people, you know who are always yelling about aliens or whatever and they're always saying hey government release your documents that you know You've been hiding, right?

229
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,380
Speaker 1: Well, here's some guys high up in a government who have access to top-secret documents like that and they believe it's real.

230
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,198
Speaker 1: They're on your side.

231
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:40,740
Speaker 1: Yet where are these top-secret documents that they would be revealing to convince you that they aren't just full of shit?

232
00:16:41,362 --> 00:16:44,616
Speaker 1: Oh, there aren't any because it's a crazy conspiracy and it's not real.

233
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,789
Speaker 0: Yeah Alright, that's enough of that.

234
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,534
Speaker 0: What do you got?

235
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:54,329
Speaker 1: I got okay, so There's a guy a guy you say Named Paul karison.

236
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:01,138
Speaker 1: Paul karison you say yes He has a disease from Oregon, but I think he moved to California now.

237
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,563
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, I think I know where you're going with this and he has a disease called Argyria.

238
00:17:07,864 --> 00:17:16,210
Speaker 0: now you might this is somewhat famous for being the affliction of crazy Libertarian guy and various crazies.

239
00:17:17,462 --> 00:17:20,417
Speaker 0: It really only affects crazy people and one lady who didn't know better.

240
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:20,839
Speaker 0: Yep

241
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:40,660
Speaker 1: so basically, you know, we like to talk in the show about homeopathy and homeopathy homeopathy and Acupuncture and whatever right and a lot of fake medicines, right and we always complain, you know Fake medicine is bad because someone will take the fake medicine and instead of real medicine and then they'll those get sick and die.

242
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:45,098
Speaker 1: Or, you know, somebody will you know, take the.

243
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:50,360
Speaker 1: you know They'll spend money on fake medicine and then some scamming person gets a bunch of money or you know.

244
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,280
Speaker 1: But as bad as homeopathy is as bad as acupuncture is.

245
00:17:55,083 --> 00:18:00,748
Speaker 1: The worst that can happen with acupuncture is some evil scamming Acupuncturist who might even actually believe in it.

246
00:18:01,069 --> 00:18:04,020
Speaker 1: get some money and you might get an infection from the needles.

247
00:18:04,482 --> 00:18:15,179
Speaker 0: I mean the only possible thing beyond that would be if you refuse or didn't accept Real treatment from a real doctor in lieu of acupuncture, but that again your fault.

248
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,365
Speaker 1: Yep Homeopathy the worst that can happen.

249
00:18:17,867 --> 00:18:22,320
Speaker 1: nothing unless you refuse other treatments and the homeopathists get money.

250
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,290
Speaker 0: I still love when James Randi to prove to Congress.

251
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,637
Speaker 0: There was bullshit basically ate like.

252
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:33,935
Speaker 0: he does that all the time Yeah, but he eats like 10,000 times the so-called lethal dose of homeopathic sleeping pills.

253
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:35,880
Speaker 1: Yep, and it says no side effects.

254
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,078
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, that's not that's true.

255
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,523
Speaker 1: No effects at all, huh?

256
00:18:39,543 --> 00:18:44,515
Speaker 1: All right, but this guy Paul karison he believed in some other bullshit medicine.

257
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:51,007
Speaker 0: I will point out that colloidal silver Does have antibiotic properties.

258
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:55,699
Speaker 0: it does and it can be used for treatment and it was used a long time ago.

259
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,740
Speaker 0: However Treating yourself with this drug is a lot like treating yourself with ancient obsolete medicine.

260
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:08,257
Speaker 0: Even the crappiest modern antibiotic works a thousand times better and with a million less side effects.

261
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:13,112
Speaker 1: even penicillin Which doesn't really work so well anymore works a lot better than colloidal silver.

262
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:18,147
Speaker 1: colloidal silver at this point in time is Effectively useless and obsolete as a medicine.

263
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:22,820
Speaker 1: It would be like trying to use a 1 megahertz IBM ps1 to make web pages.

264
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,629
Speaker 1: It's just it's you don't do that.

265
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,433
Speaker 1: It's pointless.

266
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:26,620
Speaker 1: You're only gonna hurt yourself.

267
00:19:27,701 --> 00:19:32,900
Speaker 1: So this guy he drank some colloidal silver and he also rubbed it onto his face to treat a skin problem.

268
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,207
Speaker 1: We know that's not even one of the things that colloidal silver can do Yeah, but rubbing it on the face also had no effect.

269
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,155
Speaker 0: I mean the guy's stupidity really showed in the video.

270
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:57,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically You know some doc some bullshit quack doctor, you know, they these people say that you know colloidal silica is everything except for Argyria which it causes Which they don't say.

271
00:19:57,305 --> 00:20:03,600
Speaker 1: that this is a fairly well-known syndrome I guess since yeah any real doctor could would have said what the hell don't do that?

272
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:04,597
Speaker 1: What the fuck's wrong with you?

273
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,439
Speaker 0: Basically what happens if you drink colloidal silver over a long period of time and not even you just drink enough of it?

274
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:12,935
Speaker 0: Well, it has to be over a long period of time.

275
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:19,612
Speaker 0: Usually yeah Usually like drinking a glass of colloidal silver water is not going to do this But it'll make you sick if I'm out.

276
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,600
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's not too good.

277
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:23,052
Speaker 0: Actually, I probably won't if I won't have any ill effects.

278
00:20:23,072 --> 00:20:36,578
Speaker 0: poop silver not really basically, what it'll do is over time these silver ions and will Migrate throughout your body to your skin and then lodge themselves there and as a result you will turn blue.

279
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:39,678
Speaker 1: Yes, this guy has basically turned.

280
00:20:40,101 --> 00:20:47,360
Speaker 0: My skin is blue for the last decade because I've known about this forever And I've always liked looking at pictures of people who were dumb enough to do this to themselves.

281
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,152
Speaker 0: But I've never seen someone with this much.

282
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:55,620
Speaker 1: this guy's apparently been drinking it forever And he's probably he might still be drinking it.

283
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,382
Speaker 1: I think oh he is.

284
00:20:56,723 --> 00:21:01,257
Speaker 0: you realize in the video that the reporters like so you turn blue.

285
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,160
Speaker 0: Are you still drinking it?

286
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,806
Speaker 0: He's like hells.

287
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:03,879
Speaker 0: Yeah cures, whatever.

288
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:12,151
Speaker 1: And he also the guy refuses to go to a real doctor To seek treatment because a doctor could probably do something to.

289
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,860
Speaker 0: actually I believe that it is untreatable.

290
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:27,819
Speaker 1: once It's not totally it's partially treated like one lady who did it to herself Who actually realized that you know it was stupid afterwards and you know went to seek treatment and realized that the question was a quack And they were lying to her and it was bullshit.

291
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:32,072
Speaker 1: She went and they were able to like sort of scrape her skin some.

292
00:21:32,172 --> 00:21:34,480
Speaker 1: so now she's sort of patchy instead of solid blue.

293
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:43,359
Speaker 1: Great, yeah, but basically this guy was getting all ostracized in Oregon so he moved to California Hopefully where he will be more accepted.

294
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:51,372
Speaker 1: Uh Yeah Even if I will accept I'm not gonna discriminate against someone because they have blue skin.

295
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:57,800
Speaker 1: I'm gonna discriminate someone because Blue skin tells me you're a moron who believes in quack medicines.

296
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:01,458
Speaker 1: You're probably a moron all around and I don't have anything to do with you because you're moron.

297
00:22:02,384 --> 00:22:04,300
Speaker 1: Do you believe that silver is cares everything?

298
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,886
Speaker 0: Well, I mean silver is real nice.

299
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:07,669
Speaker 0: I like silver.

300
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:10,057
Speaker 0: I think it's my favorite precious semi-precious metal.

301
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:19,370
Speaker 1: It's not for drinking It's for making silverware Cups and fighting werewolves and plates and metal.

302
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,332
Speaker 1: Yes werewolves.

303
00:22:21,094 --> 00:22:21,937
Speaker 1: That's what it's for.

304
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:24,821
Speaker 0: Don't drink silver It's not for you.

305
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:34,128
Speaker 0: Yeah things of the day.

306
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:35,769
Speaker 1: It's a holiday season.

307
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:36,310
Speaker 1: You know that?

308
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,873
Speaker 0: uh You know what.

309
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:41,594
Speaker 0: sadly I didn't notice it at all I don't you know.

310
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:48,340
Speaker 0: drive past malls and work in New York City and have to go buy that bell ringer Every single time I leave the Lincoln building.

311
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it dang.

312
00:22:51,714 --> 00:22:52,722
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy's not getting my mom.

313
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:53,770
Speaker 0: actually he was gone today.

314
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,764
Speaker 0: He was the side and in his place with a tuba player.

315
00:22:55,784 --> 00:23:00,267
Speaker 0: I was very happy The tuba player is help helping him love Christmas tuba players.

316
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:05,030
Speaker 0: I got to admit That's one of my favorite things walking around the city in holidays, but I thought you didn't like the Salvation Army.

317
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:10,547
Speaker 0: I don't like the salvation from the side army, but I like Christmas tuba players a lot.

318
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:13,889
Speaker 0: All right I just like tubas especially to boost tuba solos.

319
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:15,342
Speaker 1: You're joking.

320
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:18,902
Speaker 1: at work today One of my co-workers is all sick sneezing and coughing all over the place.

321
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:20,790
Speaker 1: so the guy was like you sound like a tuba.

322
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,228
Speaker 1: Go home ha.

323
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,378
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, you know we go people.

324
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:28,270
Speaker 1: they buy the Christmas cards or the holiday cards or whatever you fucking call.

325
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,658
Speaker 0: No, I haven't bought a holiday card in years either.

326
00:23:30,778 --> 00:23:34,250
Speaker 1: I'm not a fan, but I didn't realize until today.

327
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:42,710
Speaker 1: It might be interesting to see some cards from other places besides the US, you know I thought you know cards in general were sort of a US thing, but I guess not.

328
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:44,596
Speaker 0: I know they're a very British thing.

329
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:56,710
Speaker 0: I think but people apparently in the United sorry in Albion People actually write letters in Christmas cards instead of just buying a card that has a pre-written poem and then signing their name.

330
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:57,033
Speaker 1: That's cuz.

331
00:23:57,053 --> 00:23:57,620
Speaker 1: they know how to write.

332
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:01,861
Speaker 0: Oh snap Wow, that was kind of self-deprecating.

333
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:02,284
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:24:02,626 --> 00:24:07,501
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway Yeah, those smart people think they're so smart knowing how to write.

335
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,609
Speaker 0: might it might just be the accent.

336
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:12,053
Speaker 1: maybe Here is something extra cool.

337
00:24:12,073 --> 00:24:12,374
Speaker 1: You ready?

338
00:24:12,394 --> 00:24:13,135
Speaker 1: It's pretty simple.

339
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:22,646
Speaker 1: These is a gallery four pages worth of images that are Holiday cards from Soviet Russia.

340
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,503
Speaker 1: Oh, man They holiday.

341
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:25,673
Speaker 0: man Are they all?

342
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:28,222
Speaker 0: are they all what I think they are or are they all just normal?

343
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:30,350
Speaker 1: a lot of them have rockets on them.

344
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:39,098
Speaker 0: Oh, man, I really airplanes and cccps and planets and spaceships and cosmo All right, I got I think I got an idea.

345
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:40,905
Speaker 0: I think I got a really good idea.

346
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:41,950
Speaker 1: print them out and use them.

347
00:24:42,251 --> 00:24:46,170
Speaker 0: I think what I'm gonna do cuz I got these contracts for printing shit for geek nights.

348
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,705
Speaker 0: Anyway, I should send these to them cuz even if the copyright isn't expired, whatever.

349
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,250
Speaker 0: No one's gonna the copyrights Russian.

350
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:57,450
Speaker 0: I don't think I need to worry and I'm totally gonna use those as Christmas cards forever more.

351
00:24:57,932 --> 00:25:00,681
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start sending you guys are you have a hard time picking one out?

352
00:25:00,702 --> 00:25:01,344
Speaker 1: Cuz there's a lot.

353
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:04,529
Speaker 0: I'll just print like 10 of each Go nut.

354
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:08,350
Speaker 1: But yet Soviet Russian Christmas cards.

355
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:10,576
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is about Soviet Russian.

356
00:25:10,657 --> 00:25:15,952
Speaker 0: everything that I like except I guess Soviet Russian politics as evil as Soviet Russia was.

357
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:21,270
Speaker 1: in reality their aesthetic style of the government art agency was high quality.

358
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,880
Speaker 0: I just in Soviet propaganda and Soviet architecture and I don't know why I like these things.

359
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:34,710
Speaker 0: so it's like the message of the But you know what I think it is art Awesome.

360
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:35,212
Speaker 0: I think.

361
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,997
Speaker 0: what I think it is too is that if you look purely at the propaganda and the literature the fake you know the literature.

362
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:41,826
Speaker 0: that's not accurate.

363
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:55,930
Speaker 0: if communism worked the way people wanted it to like if it actually worked and if this idea of you know Collectively together all of us sort of if that were true and it really worked then that's pretty much the best thing ever.

364
00:25:56,436 --> 00:26:08,305
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think also for me It's that they they had such an emphasis like a countrywide emphasis on like science you know like big guy with a hammer and a gear and a and a rocket

365
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:16,576
Speaker 0: at least in theory and Somewhat in practice, but there was also the idea that if a rocket scientist screwed up He kind of disappeared which wasn't good.

366
00:26:16,796 --> 00:26:20,007
Speaker 0: No, or if a scientist said something that kind of went against communism up.

367
00:26:20,509 --> 00:26:34,390
Speaker 0: Yep It just shows you the people who are doing evil can still make good art, I guess on the side Yeah, but at the same time people with good intentions or I guess movements with good intentions do not always imply good results?

368
00:26:34,938 --> 00:26:36,593
Speaker 1: No, not at all Right.

369
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:41,050
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day and we're probably gonna talk a lot more about these in the near future.

370
00:26:41,171 --> 00:26:45,173
Speaker 0: But there is something called Ted Ideas worth spreading.

371
00:26:45,253 --> 00:26:46,035
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to it.

372
00:26:46,597 --> 00:26:52,350
Speaker 0: It's basically an annual I think conference where smart people get together and lecture to other smart people.

373
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,912
Speaker 1: Yep, and I don't know how to go there, but I'd like to go I'd like to go Now.

374
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:58,238
Speaker 0: now you might be thinking.

00:26:58,338 --> 00:27:00,287
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah rim you totally want to present there.

376
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:01,694
Speaker 0: That's not gonna happen Are you kidding?

377
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:03,665
Speaker 0: These people are so much smarter than me.

378
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:08,650
Speaker 1: these people These are like the geniuses of the world like Nobel Prize winning level genius type people.

379
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:15,035
Speaker 0: I would I would pay a lot of money and spend a lot of vacation time to just go and listen because these These are amazing.

380
00:27:15,436 --> 00:27:16,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but luckily they they.

381
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:21,015
Speaker 1: the rules at Ted or when you're giving your presentation, you know You're not allowed to sell anything.

382
00:27:21,336 --> 00:27:22,540
Speaker 1: It's a non-commercial deal.

383
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,350
Speaker 1: And also the videos are all online.

384
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,822
Speaker 1: You can watch them so you don't really need to go.

385
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:35,630
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is Probably of all the ones I've watched my favorite one and I doubt anything from this year is gonna top it.

386
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:37,717
Speaker 1: But this is you didn't watch the Bill Clinton one.

387
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:39,383
Speaker 1: Did you know shit?

388
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,266
Speaker 0: No, I didn't.

389
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,863
Speaker 1: Bill Clinton's my man Bill talks about the Rwanda's.

390
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:50,635
Speaker 0: Ah Cuz I read is I read about how we thought about the Rwanda's and if he says what I think he's gonna say I might cry.

391
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:56,101
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll watch it after the show might have to but anyway With the possible exception of the one I haven't seen yet.

392
00:27:56,122 --> 00:27:58,230
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred you haven't seen yet.

393
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,134
Speaker 0: Well the Bill Clinton one.

394
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:00,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, not all of them are good.

395
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,450
Speaker 1: I watched a pretty bad one the other day.

396
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:06,650
Speaker 0: So well, was it bad in the sense that you disagree with it or was it bad in the sense?

397
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,234
Speaker 0: That was boring.

398
00:28:07,274 --> 00:28:09,290
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure if I agreed or disagreed with it.

399
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,210
Speaker 1: I was sort of iffy cuz I didn't watch the whole thing.

400
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,855
Speaker 1: So I don't know.

401
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:17,205
Speaker 1: but the guy was not good at presenting But the guy in the video you're about to talk about was excellent at presenting.

402
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,234
Speaker 0: Holy crap Is this worth you watch?

403
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:21,281
Speaker 1: he has the public speaking skills of the awesome.

404
00:28:21,723 --> 00:28:23,810
Speaker 0: He is a world famous neurologist.

405
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,054
Speaker 0: His name is Vileana or Ramachandran.

406
00:28:27,254 --> 00:28:28,816
Speaker 0: I hope I pronounced that right.

407
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,058
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna give it another try.

408
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:30,519
Speaker 0: I'll try.

409
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:32,846
Speaker 1: Vilean are Ramachandran.

410
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,058
Speaker 0: Anyway, this guy is real cool.

411
00:28:36,078 --> 00:28:53,257
Speaker 0: We're in jeans leather jacket t-shirt kind of disheveled and he's like I said, he's a neurologist and I cannot describe this lecture other than Fascinating Absolutely fascinating and yet at the same time 100% accessible.

412
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:59,762
Speaker 0: you can know nothing about neuroscience Nothing about the brain nothing about psychology nothing about any of that.

413
00:29:00,424 --> 00:29:02,370
Speaker 0: and yet you will understand what this man is saying.

414
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:17,990
Speaker 1: Yeah Watching the good videos on this website is like sitting in like the awesomest College classes because it reminds me of like, you know a college professor who didn't suck or every college professor Ever had who didn't suck where I'd sit in their class and just be like ah, man's the whole time.

415
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:27,925
Speaker 1: So this is this is worth, you know that these videos that you're available free online Be it that's like getting hundreds of thousands of dollars in college education for free.

416
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:29,229
Speaker 1: That's how quality this is.

417
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:44,242
Speaker 0: so I don't really want to spoil what he talks about really and I also feel like I couldn't do it justice, but he talks about a number of issues with the brain and he kind of explores Neuroscience from the sense of how do we study it?

418
00:29:44,343 --> 00:29:45,749
Speaker 0: How do we know the things we know?

419
00:29:45,769 --> 00:30:13,961
Speaker 0: and Basically he kind of brings it all together in the end and he seems he is fairly confident that he has found possibly the I'm being very vague here because I don't want to sound stupid the kind of the thing that makes humans humans the the structure in the brain that makes human consciousness on the level that we have it possible and The things he said are kind of revolutionary and amazing.

420
00:30:14,443 --> 00:30:16,530
Speaker 1: He also talks about Bubo and Kiki.

421
00:30:16,831 --> 00:30:17,332
Speaker 1: That's all.

422
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:18,395
Speaker 1: that's the amazing part.

423
00:30:18,576 --> 00:30:26,350
Speaker 0: that part of the end is is so illustrative of everything that this lecture is about and it's kind Of amazing when he gets to the end and he pulls it all together.

424
00:30:26,531 --> 00:30:28,900
Speaker 1: It's so obvious like you always knew.

425
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,607
Speaker 1: but you don't know.

426
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:31,329
Speaker 0: think about that.

427
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,228
Speaker 0: you He'll say it and you'll think wow Yeah That makes sense.

428
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:38,410
Speaker 0: But then he points out that that making sense is crazy.

429
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:46,360
Speaker 0: The fact that that can make sense is what makes humans humans and that all of that takes place in this part of the brain Called the fusiform gyrus.

430
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:46,843
Speaker 1: Yep.

431
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:48,394
Speaker 1: Oh, man You don't want.

432
00:30:48,435 --> 00:30:56,750
Speaker 1: let me tell you the one thing I learned from this video If you have to lose any part of your brain do not pick the fusiform gyrus lose any other part first.

433
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:59,820
Speaker 0: It is very important that you remember this in the future.

434
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,710
Speaker 1: fusiform gyrus most important part of brain.

435
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:12,790
Speaker 1: Fusiform gyrus for the way even if you're like, I don't know about that I'm not a neuroscientist But it is the part of my brain that if I had to choose which one to lose last I would pick that one.

436
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:17,810
Speaker 0: Now knowing what I know, I think I would give up most of my senses before I would give up my fusiform gyrus.

437
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much or even part of my fusiform gyrus.

438
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:20,662
Speaker 0: God.

439
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:21,023
Speaker 0: Luckily.

440
00:31:21,063 --> 00:31:21,847
Speaker 0: It's way in the middle.

441
00:31:22,068 --> 00:31:25,070
Speaker 1: Yep It's in the safest spot for a reason.

442
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:28,081
Speaker 0: Alright, but I cannot stress this enough.

443
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:28,824
Speaker 0: you it.

444
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:29,928
Speaker 0: this thing's like 35 minutes long.

445
00:31:30,912 --> 00:31:31,595
Speaker 0: It is worth every.

446
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:32,619
Speaker 0: you got nothing better to do.

447
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,367
Speaker 1: if you're what are you gonna do for 35 minutes?

448
00:31:34,387 --> 00:31:35,070
Speaker 1: listen to geek nights.

449
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,872
Speaker 1: What the hell's wrong?

450
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:40,827
Speaker 0: This is I. I feel like a richer person for having watched this.

451
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,736
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely Definitely.

452
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,255
Speaker 1: Alright, so So copping out we did.

453
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:48,122
Speaker 1: we miss two Thursday shows.

454
00:31:48,182 --> 00:31:50,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've been busy lately and we're gonna get a lot busier.

455
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,013
Speaker 0: You're lucky.

456
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:51,997
Speaker 0: We're doing a show tonight.

457
00:31:52,359 --> 00:31:54,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna go to sleep right about now.

458
00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:17,070
Speaker 0: See basically and I was inspired to have this idea cuz I was listening to my backlog of fast karate And they were having some issues with Dave moving around and they kind of did a short State of the podcast address and I thought about that and I realized that we used to talk about the show from this meta Perspective a lot more early on and we stopped doing that because there's yeah, that's really not that interesting to new listeners.

459
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:17,614
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate

460
00:32:17,755 --> 00:32:35,382
Speaker 1: talking about the show in the show I mean because while people who are already listeners want to hear us talk about the show in the show, you know And then stuff like that it you know for if someone's a new listener They they pit they turn on the podcast They start listening to us talk about ourselves and they're just like they don't.

461
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,430
Speaker 1: they totally have no connection with that.

462
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:46,574
Speaker 1: That's why all we always try to talk about you know the news is the things of the day and the topic and not try to talk about ourselves because I mean other than Our leader bit.

463
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:48,201
Speaker 0: but even then that's more like an anecdote.

464
00:32:48,321 --> 00:32:50,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that that only thing happened on the way to the forum.

465
00:32:50,656 --> 00:32:58,718
Speaker 1: Yeah But that'll just make people tune out and we want you to tune in as much as possible except unless you're gonna go watch Viamar Ramachand, then you should tune out.

466
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:09,658
Speaker 0: so at the same time I feel like every now and then it is kind of important to talk about what we're doing here and where we're going with all this crap and Every time we think oh crap.

467
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:10,160
Speaker 0: It's Thursday.

468
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,145
Speaker 0: We don't have a show to do.

469
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:16,466
Speaker 0: in the back of my mind I always think we could talk about the show and then I think but wait a minute.

470
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:22,490
Speaker 0: It's too soon I don't want to do that all the time and I realized today that I've been saying that for a long time.

471
00:33:22,891 --> 00:33:26,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually I don't even think about talking about the show because it's.

472
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:30,849
Speaker 1: it's so automatically Discounted as an idea that it doesn't even come up in my mind.

473
00:33:31,332 --> 00:33:33,846
Speaker 1: But rim brought it up and I said, you know what?

474
00:33:33,906 --> 00:33:37,704
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever It's easy to do and actually there's a lot to talk about.

475
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,150
Speaker 1: I feel like the show is the show.

476
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,534
Speaker 1: We're in the third season now, right?

477
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:41,217
Speaker 0: Yes.

478
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:42,601
Speaker 0: We are well into the third season.

479
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,390
Speaker 0: So well over 400 episodes of this business.

480
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,518
Speaker 0: Yeah

481
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:58,123
Speaker 1: So I'm sort of getting the feeling now that there's a lot of things where the statute of limitations Have run out and we can sort of talk about them again even if we've talked about them before as long as there has been a Long as we're gonna say something significantly different

482
00:33:58,525 --> 00:33:59,530
Speaker 0: plus work.

483
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:20,190
Speaker 0: There have been a couple of I guess points of change or linchpins in the I guess time scale of geek nights like when we first got a mixer and it was it went from To an actual show and then you know We got a compressor and I learned about audio and then when we got a better compressor in a Maran.

484
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:34,129
Speaker 0: Like there have been these points not just audio wise but like when we decided on a show format when we changed the show format when we decided to go with multiple feeds when we decided to start doing live shows at cons like all these times where we

485
00:34:35,052 --> 00:34:36,237
Speaker 1: We added the geek bites.

486
00:34:36,397 --> 00:34:37,462
Speaker 1: We added the geek backs.

487
00:34:37,683 --> 00:34:38,726
Speaker 0: We took away things.

488
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:39,550
Speaker 0: we change things.

489
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,253
Speaker 0: We tried.

490
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:44,650
Speaker 0: I remember our first thing of the day music that epic failure that it was.

491
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:47,481
Speaker 1: I was I liked it a lot but listeners didn't.

492
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,830
Speaker 0: I spent like four hours making that happen.

493
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:53,141
Speaker 0: We tried it once everyone hated it never used it again.

494
00:34:53,161 --> 00:34:55,230
Speaker 1: We should use it again in this episode.

495
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,935
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna cuz I don't even know where it is.

496
00:34:56,955 --> 00:35:02,390
Speaker 0: It's in like my my stupid like flack archive on the offline hard drive.

497
00:35:02,532 --> 00:35:03,768
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna go get that thing out.

498
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:13,760
Speaker 0: But actually in terms of everything that geek nights is we're kind of on a major cusp here Like I think in terms of what we do here.

499
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:16,090
Speaker 0: We're on the point of taking it to the next level.

500
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,348
Speaker 1: I think so I mean right now.

501
00:35:18,772 --> 00:35:25,207
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, we've done a sort of you know Contests in the past and there's someone who famously keeps bothering us about one of them.

502
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:38,340
Speaker 1: Yep, and You know, we've never quite made prizes or swag even though a lot of people who do a lot less than us have prizes and swag, so we're actually Months away from having swag probably by February.

503
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,064
Speaker 0: We've got multiple artists.

504
00:35:40,124 --> 00:35:41,548
Speaker 0: We've got an e-commerce solution.

505
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:43,918
Speaker 0: We're working on Mostly Scott.

506
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:44,524
Speaker 0: that's kind of like.

507
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:51,890
Speaker 0: we kind of yeah Like, you know if there were like the credits of geek nights the producer or whatever though Whatever Scott and I have kind of divvy that up all 50/50.

508
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,882
Speaker 0: So Scott's Drive right now is all the e-commerce crap.

509
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:58,550
Speaker 0: We have to put together before we can actually sell stuff.

510
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:00,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me tell you e-commerce sucks ass.

511
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:03,741
Speaker 1: there's a reason people are using like eBay and cafe press cuz.

512
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:10,970
Speaker 0: doing anything else is a pain in the ass and My side now of this is dealing with the artists and getting them to finish our business.

513
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:12,515
Speaker 0: Yep, but you know what?

514
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:14,201
Speaker 0: It's equally difficult, right?

515
00:36:14,502 --> 00:36:16,950
Speaker 1: But as soon it where it's not get we are gonna do it.

516
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,070
Speaker 1: We are closer than we've ever been to this.

517
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:23,070
Speaker 1: We're not gonna give any sort of definite date, but I ain't gonna guarantee that it will happen.

518
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,884
Speaker 1: I will guarantee that even if even if we all die.

519
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,150
Speaker 1: Well, not if we all die.

520
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,778
Speaker 1: That's the only thing that will stop from happening.

521
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,568
Speaker 0: if both Scott and I die Then it won't happen.

522
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:41,780
Speaker 0: But otherwise at the same time if only one of us dies Then another person will fill in and then if the other one of us dies It'll be geek nights with Joey Jojo and Shabba doo, right?

523
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:43,284
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's.

524
00:36:43,425 --> 00:36:45,130
Speaker 1: it's gonna happen soonish.

525
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:50,090
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get you nice leg for the holidays, but there will be a nice swag soon of some sort.

526
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:55,050
Speaker 1: That will also mean that there'll be prizes for anyone who's ever won a prize.

527
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:58,010
Speaker 1: I know we had a contest like a words podcast contest, right?

528
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,790
Speaker 0: We've got a list of a lot of people who are gonna believe you have a list.

529
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:02,594
Speaker 0: I do you know.

530
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:12,715
Speaker 0: my list is if I search for a certain couple of words in Gmail I have a list of all the people I promised prizes to that have ever ever Bothered me about it.

531
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:16,450
Speaker 0: If anyone ever emailed us or me and said hey, where's my prize?

532
00:37:16,871 --> 00:37:19,749
Speaker 0: I have a filter that just lists all those emails.

533
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:22,809
Speaker 0: Cuz I added him to that every time I saw one.

534
00:37:23,091 --> 00:37:26,750
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, so I have a list of all the people who have bothered me about a prize.

535
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:32,250
Speaker 0: So if you're owed a prize and you've never bothered me now is your time to bother me or geek nights.

536
00:37:32,571 --> 00:37:42,770
Speaker 1: Yep, and we'll I guess what we're gonna do is we're gonna go through that list of people who deserve prizes and you know Whatever and then we'll you know, we'll verify that all those prizes are really things we want to award and whatever.

537
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,264
Speaker 1: Alright, so that's that's the first thing that's going on.

538
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:50,511
Speaker 1: the second thing I'm finally redoing the website, you know basically I've.

539
00:37:50,591 --> 00:37:59,764
Speaker 1: we've tried a bunch of times to get web designers or other people to help us out because I want a slick web 2.0 Website that you know looks professional on man web 3.0 semantic web.

540
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:03,197
Speaker 1: I know right but That sort of failed.

541
00:38:03,277 --> 00:38:09,662
Speaker 1: like anyone who's actually high quality at that Doesn't want to do our dinky little job because it's just a dinky little job.

542
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:16,130
Speaker 0: and all the people who have given us awesome designs Either disappeared or never followed through or those designs were awesome, but infeasible.

543
00:38:16,492 --> 00:38:19,550
Speaker 1: It's sort of like how my mom needed the basement stairs fixed, right?

544
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:25,030
Speaker 1: So she wanted to hire a carpenter but none of the carpenters would do it because this job was too small.

545
00:38:25,592 --> 00:38:28,810
Speaker 1: But all the like that, you know, they're just the guys who happen to know how to do it.

546
00:38:29,111 --> 00:38:34,390
Speaker 1: You know small-time guys, they wouldn't do it because they weren't you know, they weren't real carpenters.

547
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,359
Speaker 1: They didn't actually follow through and do the work.

548
00:38:36,419 --> 00:38:38,649
Speaker 1: So it took her a long time to actually find someone to do it.

549
00:38:38,709 --> 00:38:49,690
Speaker 1: now I realized that you know, I'm I designed the current well I sort of stole parts of someone else's design and then you know combined it with my CSS skills to make the current design.

550
00:38:49,730 --> 00:39:00,590
Speaker 1: If I recruit calm and the forum is you know, the default forum theme, which I'm not gonna change And you know, it's I think it's terrible but apparently a lot of people don't think it's that bad at all.

551
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,318
Speaker 1: So my skills at that have increased.

552
00:39:03,338 --> 00:39:07,010
Speaker 1: they'd have an increased enough to where I can make fancy web 2.0 websites that look great.

553
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:13,310
Speaker 1: But they've increased quite a bit and I've I think I've got something that's gonna work out.

554
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:21,750
Speaker 1: So probably in a few weeks I'll have that you know polished up enough to put it on the site and then they'll probably still be some more polishing afterwards.

555
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,597
Speaker 1: But we're gonna have the website.

556
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:28,680
Speaker 1: it's gonna be better than it is now and it's gonna be easier for you to do stuff And there's gonna be a lot more information on it.

557
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:42,206
Speaker 0: Yep and pursuant to that There are going to be a lot more feeds a lot more ways to get geek nights a lot more ways to customize how you get geek nights for what you want to Listen to a lot more ways to integrate other business with geek nights.

558
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:43,974
Speaker 1: Yep I mean we're gonna.

559
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:47,990
Speaker 1: probably you know right now all we have is the Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday in the total feed.

560
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:50,498
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a lot more stuff besides that.

561
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:52,304
Speaker 0: well, there's the experimental feed.

562
00:39:52,324 --> 00:39:53,187
Speaker 1: No, that's right.

563
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:56,889
Speaker 1: this experimental feed We're gonna add in the supplemental feed, right?

564
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:03,490
Speaker 0: Yep That's gonna be anytime cuz we've been appearing semi regularly now on Friday night party line and we've appeared on other shows in the past.

565
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:09,357
Speaker 0: So I think anytime we appear on any sort of media out there We're gonna link to it.

566
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:14,970
Speaker 0: and if it's something that we can link to that's audio We're gonna have a feed that'll let you just download whatever shows were on.

567
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:22,354
Speaker 0: So if we're on anime world order for whatever reason you'll just you'll see that episode of anime world order with us in it In that feed.

568
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:22,855
Speaker 1: Yep.

569
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,950
Speaker 1: We should also like we should keep our current total geek nights feed.

570
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,170
Speaker 1: Right is just you know, every episode of geek nights the last hundred of them at least.

571
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should have a total rim and scott feed also.

572
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:39,187
Speaker 1: that in you know Sort of like the supplemental plus the experimental plus the we'll have some sort of like the geek nights uber feed.

573
00:40:39,227 --> 00:40:40,010
Speaker 0: that has everything.

574
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,950
Speaker 1: We're gonna have all kinds of feeds.

575
00:40:42,051 --> 00:40:46,579
Speaker 1: So no matter what kind of geek nights listener you are You'll have something that'll you.

576
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,488
Speaker 1: you'll have some combination of feeds that will provide you with The stuff you want to listen to and only the stuff you want to.

577
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:55,790
Speaker 0: yeah I mean one thing too that I really want to get going because it wasn't an issue right away.

578
00:40:55,891 --> 00:41:07,502
Speaker 0: But now that we have so many episodes it's getting to the point where there is no feed that has some of our earliest earliest episodes on it because Having more than a hundred anythings in a feed causes problems.

579
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:07,863
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:41:08,264 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaker 0: So we're probably gonna have archival feeds too.

581
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,354
Speaker 1: Well, it's not.

582
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:14,930
Speaker 1: there's nothing wrong with RSS technology that prevents there from being so many feeds.

583
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:25,230
Speaker 1: it's mostly a limitation of WordPress where if I want to have feeds with a bajillion items in then I have to go into WordPress and say yeah put like a bajillion items in this feed, you know, there has to be a number.

584
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,358
Speaker 1: I can't just say infinity.

585
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,950
Speaker 1: I have to set a number plus.

586
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,237
Speaker 1: I have to keep changing that number plus.

587
00:41:30,257 --> 00:41:34,730
Speaker 0: the feed gets bigger and more unwieldy and different readers crap out at different sizes.

588
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:35,442
Speaker 0: And it's just.

589
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:36,812
Speaker 0: it's not Plus.

590
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:42,850
Speaker 0: if anything ever happens and you like your feed reader screws up expect to download 800 episodes of gig nights.

591
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I never.

592
00:41:44,154 --> 00:41:54,189
Speaker 1: I don't recommend I don't and I don't recommend anyone else allow their pod catchers to automatically download episodes on Their own or at least more than like a set number like never more than five.

593
00:41:54,229 --> 00:42:00,640
Speaker 1: or yeah it's like I use iTunes and what I do is I update the feeds and then all the new episodes appear and I push get Next to every episode.

594
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:07,916
Speaker 1: because sometimes, you know I don't listen to every episode of every podcast only click get on the ones I want to listen to and I delete the ones I don't before even downloading them.

595
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:11,190
Speaker 1: and I I think that is the way that people should manage their podcast.

596
00:42:12,432 --> 00:42:13,559
Speaker 0: So we talked a lot of us.

597
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:20,670
Speaker 1: it helps us out because then we know, you know If you download every episode automatically and only listen to half we don't know that we see that you downloaded every episode.

598
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,270
Speaker 1: So we can only assume you listen to all of them.

599
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:24,238
Speaker 1: So only download the ones are you listen to?

600
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:35,082
Speaker 0: but also we talked a lot about having DVDs of like DVD season 1 DVD season 2 and higher quality and all this and that is Currently not super feasible.

601
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:36,350
Speaker 0: Like I don't feel like it's worth it.

602
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,910
Speaker 1: We that was something we actually came pretty close to.

603
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,469
Speaker 0: Completing the DVD is done in terms of the fact that we have it.

604
00:42:42,791 --> 00:42:43,675
Speaker 0: We have it all.

605
00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:47,050
Speaker 0: just actually making it and printing it and finishing it up.

606
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:52,718
Speaker 0: It's like to have the little website that would come with it be perfect Would take more effort than I think it's worth.

607
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,390
Speaker 0: I don't think enough of you want DVDs of geek nights.

608
00:42:55,611 --> 00:43:04,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, the DVD probably isn't gonna happen because you know sure we could you know Put geek nights every all the episodes on a DVD and sell the DVDs or whatever.

609
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:14,450
Speaker 1: But in order to make DVDs, it's not something we can do on demand We'd have to print a whole bunch of them and to have you know If you did that we want to have nice covers on the DVDs little cases, you know.

610
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,509
Speaker 1: And we'd want to put you know other extras on the DVD.

611
00:43:18,232 --> 00:43:23,990
Speaker 1: But the it would take like two DVDs just to do season one.

612
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:31,142
Speaker 1: So at this point it would be like five DVDs for all of geek nights and that becomes Ludicrously expensive ludicrously difficult.

613
00:43:31,384 --> 00:43:36,324
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass You know, and I don't think the demand is there except I don't think the demand is very.

614
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:39,538
Speaker 1: I think the demand is very high Among a very small number of people.

615
00:43:39,598 --> 00:43:40,603
Speaker 0: Yeah dial-up users.

616
00:43:40,905 --> 00:43:42,010
Speaker 1: Yeah dial-up users.

617
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,342
Speaker 1: So yeah, I don't think the geek nights DVD is gonna happen.

618
00:43:46,884 --> 00:43:52,850
Speaker 1: You might again see Some sort of geek nights promotional CDs at a convention or something.

619
00:43:52,952 --> 00:43:55,674
Speaker 1: But other than that Don't wait on those DVDs.

620
00:43:55,714 --> 00:44:07,923
Speaker 1: that I'm sort of sad because I told myself way back in the day that you know So many webcomics and podcasts and other internet, you know artists of sorts Promised things and they don't come through on them.

621
00:44:07,963 --> 00:44:18,939
Speaker 1: and I said that's not gonna be me I'm gonna come through on the promises not gonna make any promises I don't come through on and I feel like I feel like I promised the DVD even though I don't know if I actually did But I feel like I did and we're not gonna come through on it.

622
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:22,210
Speaker 1: So I'm like, ah, so but for now on no more shit-talking.

623
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:29,517
Speaker 0: Now in terms of actual geek nights production, you know how we make the show how we do the show How we record it all that sort of technical stuff.

624
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:39,013
Speaker 0: My room is turned slowly more and more into a relatively Usable studio because you have a knob fetish yeah, something like that.

625
00:44:39,414 --> 00:44:52,639
Speaker 0: and we I've been acquiring equipment and things over the years and also ever since we did the show at katsu khan last year where we brought all of our equipment and we set it up and we routed all the audio for the whole video game area into our stuff.

626
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:54,768
Speaker 0: and I've learned a lot since then.

627
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:59,755
Speaker 0: and in terms of production values I think we've gotten to the point where I'm.

628
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:09,228
Speaker 0: we're jumping from amateur to professional in terms of our equipment Will be once I get this mixer going and I get the box and all the routing and everything set up.

629
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:17,260
Speaker 0: We're going to have a fully professional rig that would be capable of recording an entire Band like a rock band or whatever we wanted.

630
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,987
Speaker 0: We've got everything now and be portable.

631
00:45:19,509 --> 00:45:23,330
Speaker 0: Yes It'll actually be in despite the fact that this mixer is ginormous

632
00:45:24,932 --> 00:45:26,038
Speaker 1: And I hate saying I know

633
00:45:26,058 --> 00:45:28,270
Speaker 0: you know what it's so big that the word is warranted

634
00:45:29,013 --> 00:45:29,395
Speaker 1: uh-huh,

635
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:49,314
Speaker 0: but it's still a lot more portable sadly and we're gonna be set up in relatively short order to where we can record a lot of people in our studio at the same time and do all sorts of roundtables and Multi interviews and like group interviews over Skype and all these sorts of things Trivially.

636
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:53,970
Speaker 0: so expect a lot more roundtable discussions a lot more interviews.

637
00:45:54,090 --> 00:46:00,030
Speaker 0: We've actually got a lot of interviews that were lined up and just put on hold because it wasn't easy to do an interview quickly.

638
00:46:00,696 --> 00:46:05,103
Speaker 1: I mean we've in the past We have actually tried to do some interviews that fell through.

639
00:46:05,203 --> 00:46:14,821
Speaker 1: like the only time we've really done Skype action is when someone else is recording and we were skyping them, you know, yeah I mean we were supposed to interview Jim Vowles and that failed because the Mac failed us.

640
00:46:15,182 --> 00:46:21,050
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, you know we net with this new mixer.

641
00:46:21,351 --> 00:46:29,490
Speaker 1: I think well rim will finally be motivated to set up the Skype and We'll have be able to have a lot more microphones in the room that all work properly.

642
00:46:30,013 --> 00:46:32,848
Speaker 1: So I gotta have a lot more podcasts that are more than just.

643
00:46:32,969 --> 00:46:40,083
Speaker 1: you know The usual geek nights us to talk about stuff and I think that's very necessary Because if you haven't noticed we're sort of running out of things to talk about.

644
00:46:40,304 --> 00:46:44,079
Speaker 0: well only on Wednesdays and full Thursdays days.

645
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:46,690
Speaker 0: and well Wednesdays we were running out until I read comics again.

646
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,161
Speaker 0: But yeah, if we start watching anime again Wednesday, I'll be okay.

647
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:51,070
Speaker 1: I think we'll start watching anime again the new year.

648
00:46:51,452 --> 00:47:08,370
Speaker 1: I have a strong feeling that the new year is gonna be anime season because I still have a bunch of video games, but I'm probably gonna blow through those during the holiday season and I got a bunch of comics on the floor But I'll probably blow through those in the holiday season also and then after that it's anime from and there to the horizon.

649
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:13,710
Speaker 0: I can say this once all this is set up and going you might think how could the audio be better than it is?

650
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:15,630
Speaker 0: It sounds pretty good, which I think it does.

651
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,519
Speaker 0: I think we're one of the best sounding podcasts out there.

652
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,770
Speaker 1: Well, I think a lot of people seen are you really?

653
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,367
Speaker 1: You know, it sounds okay, but most people seem to say it sounds really good.

654
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:31,075
Speaker 0: So, all right well, I mean having listened to other podcasts and listen to the radio a lot in the past and that sort of thing and I Mean, I'm perfectly frank.

655
00:47:31,095 --> 00:47:36,530
Speaker 0: We're not gonna beat around the bush other than you know twit and the super professional podcast.

656
00:47:37,133 --> 00:47:39,507
Speaker 0: I think we're one of the best sounding podcasts out there.

657
00:47:39,567 --> 00:47:40,030
Speaker 0: audio wise.

658
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,869
Speaker 1: Well, I think you're just sort of obsessed with the audio quality so much.

659
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:47,372
Speaker 0: And the thing is a lot of people said early on and don't worry about it No one cares.

660
00:47:47,453 --> 00:47:49,541
Speaker 0: but or oh, we can't tell it.

661
00:47:49,581 --> 00:47:58,030
Speaker 0: a lot of people say like when we first got the new compressor Oh, I can't tell the difference, but I made an extra for the DVD that I'm gonna put in the experimental feed at some point.

662
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:05,219
Speaker 0: I might remake it once I've used the new mixer and it basically took clips of geek nights continuously from the first episode.

663
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:20,902
Speaker 0: so the most recent episode just seamlessly integrated and You hear the audio quality just kind of gradually get better and then at the end it played like just a midpoint like a third of the way through geek nights and then the most recent episode and You couldn't really hear the difference.

664
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:28,836
Speaker 0: so well If when the gradual changes, but when the newest episode and an old episode were next to each other It was like night and day.

665
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:32,050
Speaker 0: It was crazy and I played it for other people and like wow

666
00:48:32,693 --> 00:48:36,110
Speaker 1: Yep, and we'll probably add to that, you know some new mixer episodes and such

667
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:46,145
Speaker 0: I think it's I think geek nights after all this new stuff is set up is going to be Exactly as professional sounding as is possible with 96 kilobit per second.

668
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:47,208
Speaker 0: mp3 is on the internet.

669
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,539
Speaker 0: Yep Okay.

670
00:48:49,722 --> 00:48:52,635
Speaker 1: Oh also I'm what I forgot.

671
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:53,539
Speaker 1: what are you gonna say?

672
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,367
Speaker 1: I was gonna say something that I forgot it.

673
00:48:55,427 --> 00:48:56,592
Speaker 1: So keep talking I'll remember.

674
00:48:56,612 --> 00:48:59,085
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could turn that into an outtake but I don't feel like editing.

675
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:00,090
Speaker 0: I'm tired and I'm hungry.

676
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:00,633
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right.

677
00:49:00,874 --> 00:49:04,150
Speaker 1: Um right now, you know, we made this experimental feed.

678
00:49:04,231 --> 00:49:10,494
Speaker 1: A lot of people like put more stuff in there blood just cuz you know When people see a feed and it doesn't have stuff constantly in it They sort of we.

679
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:12,446
Speaker 1: we made no promises about how much stuff would be in there.

680
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:12,969
Speaker 1: So screw you.

681
00:49:13,472 --> 00:49:16,223
Speaker 1: Alright, we only promise that there's gonna be stuff in all the other feeds and there is.

682
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:21,225
Speaker 1: so, you know Compare us to your mega Tokyo's and then you know, you should feel good.

683
00:49:21,306 --> 00:49:24,677
Speaker 1: Don't be complaining You know, and we're like mega Tokyo then you can complain.

684
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:28,890
Speaker 0: but man geek night sucks and I'm sad all the time.

685
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:36,969
Speaker 1: yeah, actually the reason that there isn't a lot of stuff the experimental feed the primary reason is because We podcast as much as Libsyn can allow.

686
00:49:37,871 --> 00:49:50,050
Speaker 0: Yes, we are actually see, you know when I said we're getting professional audio in a lot of ways Like the whole geek nights operation is kind of at the point where we either have to go professional.

687
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,463
Speaker 0: now That doesn't mean live off of it.

688
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:53,692
Speaker 0: full-time job Don't even.

689
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:55,257
Speaker 1: that's not not quitting my job.

690
00:49:55,397 --> 00:49:57,082
Speaker 0: That's one my jobs awesome and two.

691
00:49:57,122 --> 00:49:58,848
Speaker 0: that is so not on the horizon.

692
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:06,157
Speaker 1: unless you guys Collectively send me enough money to equal my annual salary I'll tell you what inside of like a month.

693
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:13,460
Speaker 0: I'm not quitting if you if geek nights if you guys can get to us $150,000 a year before taxes.

694
00:50:13,882 --> 00:50:16,068
Speaker 0: then we'll quit our jobs and podcast full-time.

695
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:19,166
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a lot of podcasting that is that's.

696
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:20,212
Speaker 0: that's pretty much I would.

697
00:50:20,312 --> 00:50:31,886
Speaker 0: you would get four times as much heat nights that way because you realize that if Podcasting or something like this was my full-time job It's kind of like Howard Stern whatever you might feel about the guy the guy it loves radio.

698
00:50:31,986 --> 00:50:33,090
Speaker 0: He's obsessed with radio.

699
00:50:33,211 --> 00:50:37,550
Speaker 0: He's a radio file and that man because it's his job.

700
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:43,369
Speaker 0: There's a reason there's like eight hours of Howard Stern every day because he just does it all the time because he loves doing it.

701
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:45,390
Speaker 0: Yep, and we would probably do something similar.

702
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:48,524
Speaker 1: He can fill a lot of those eight hours with commercials and other people talking.

703
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:49,910
Speaker 1: so it's it's easier for him.

704
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:50,673
Speaker 1: They would be for us.

705
00:50:50,694 --> 00:50:53,587
Speaker 0: He's got a whole staff sitting there telling him stuff while he's doing the show.

706
00:50:53,627 --> 00:51:12,922
Speaker 0: It's kind of crazy Yeah, but in terms of everything else like not counting living off of it, but in terms of how we handle geek nights We're really at the point where it's either going to be a professional operation in every sense of the word from this point forward or it's not gonna happen anymore and I feel like we're going in the professional direction.

707
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,228
Speaker 0: We're all professional equipment.

708
00:51:14,269 --> 00:51:18,564
Speaker 0: now We treat it professionally and in terms of our industry relations.

709
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:20,190
Speaker 0: We are treated professionally now.

710
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:25,507
Speaker 0: I mean when I submit things to do a like a live show at a convention somewhere.

711
00:51:25,989 --> 00:51:28,389
Speaker 0: It's not Oh, yes, you want to be a panelist here?

712
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:35,675
Speaker 0: it's I'll forward you to the handler for guest relations or the live programming whatever guy and We don't.

713
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:36,760
Speaker 0: we're not really.

714
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:38,910
Speaker 0: I don't know how to I mean, I don't want it.

715
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,821
Speaker 0: I'm not trying to say like oh, we're so awesome.

716
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:44,198
Speaker 1: But it's more like yes, you are You're just trying to say in a disguised manner.

717
00:51:44,419 --> 00:51:46,930
Speaker 1: I'm trying to not appear to be a bragger at which you are.

718
00:51:47,171 --> 00:51:50,950
Speaker 0: I am a bragger, but I'm trying to say is that we're from this point forward.

719
00:51:51,050 --> 00:52:08,049
Speaker 0: I feel like that the geek nights operation is going to be a professional operation and that our The way we handle everything from our website to our relations with all of you To the email to the forum to the to everything is going to be a lot more professional starting in the new year

720
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:09,053
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm

721
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:12,349
Speaker 0: and for good or ill that's the direction we're going.

722
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:14,118
Speaker 1: Yep, but I don't think.

723
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,701
Speaker 1: I think.

724
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:19,280
Speaker 1: I don't think people who are fans of geek nights Now are gonna suddenly be like, ah geek night sold out blood.

725
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,962
Speaker 1: That's that's not gonna.

726
00:52:20,022 --> 00:52:22,110
Speaker 0: well professional does not mean making money.

727
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:27,250
Speaker 1: Well, no, but I don't think anything is gonna happen to where people who are fans now are gonna turn on us.

728
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:32,321
Speaker 0: I think what it means is that the show is going to get a lot more Streamlined and a lot more solid as time goes on.

729
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:34,690
Speaker 0: there's gonna be fewer missed episodes.

730
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,830
Speaker 0: There's gonna be fewer episodes where rims coffin in the background or I don't know.

731
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:41,570
Speaker 1: Are you gonna go get that larynx surgery or not?

732
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,966
Speaker 0: No, because I got you realize that I can get rid of all the coughing with this new.

733
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:45,750
Speaker 0: I got a mute button.

734
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:46,633
Speaker 0: I got a cough button.

735
00:52:46,954 --> 00:52:47,335
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

736
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,438
Speaker 1: Is there one on that mixer thing?

737
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:48,860
Speaker 1: Yes.

738
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:49,582
Speaker 1: Great.

739
00:52:49,642 --> 00:52:50,003
Speaker 1: Yes.

740
00:52:50,023 --> 00:52:51,628
Speaker 1: Is it a noiseless button?

741
00:52:51,829 --> 00:52:54,417
Speaker 0: Yes So I could.

742
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:54,862
Speaker 0: I could.

743
00:52:54,922 --> 00:53:01,786
Speaker 0: it's it's great But it's also just the fact that you know in terms of when I say we're being professional.

744
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:09,294
Speaker 0: what it means more is that When we started doing the show we had this idea of well if we don't like this or it doesn't work out We're just gonna stop.

745
00:53:09,797 --> 00:53:12,310
Speaker 0: we are I think right now at the point of no return.

746
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:17,030
Speaker 0: There's no way we could stop doing geek nights and ever be satisfied for the rest of our lives.

747
00:53:17,311 --> 00:53:21,670
Speaker 1: Well anything, you know the stats we have to track the number of listeners and such is very unreliable.

748
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:25,723
Speaker 1: But if you look at the graph right the graph continues to go up.

749
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,990
Speaker 1: It's not going up at some exponential rate.

750
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:35,210
Speaker 1: it's sort of going up a little by a little but it's always up and I guess as long as it goes up for semi obligated to continue.

751
00:53:35,451 --> 00:53:47,154
Speaker 1: I mean if it went down then we could be like, oh, I guess we're doing bad let's just yeah, but but I guess to sum all that up cuz that was kind of a rambling rant partly cuz I'm really hungry, but What do you want to eat?

752
00:53:47,375 --> 00:53:50,210
Speaker 0: gig nights is pretty much to the moon or bust at this point?

753
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:52,376
Speaker 0: And we are not going to stop.

754
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:58,898
Speaker 0: if what it would take for us to stop doing geek nights would be ludicrous at this point Oh god rim just got shot in the head.

755
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:01,550
Speaker 0: Ah, oh my fusiform gyrus.

756
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,135
Speaker 0: But now what that me and I?

757
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:15,123
Speaker 0: the reason I realize this is that about three months ago Scott and I decided that Starting with season three for three or six months a temporary thing.

758
00:54:15,645 --> 00:54:17,230
Speaker 0: We were gonna cut back on geek nights.

759
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,621
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it was hard to come up with show ideas and we were.

760
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:23,430
Speaker 0: we were kind of at our maximal creative output.

761
00:54:23,651 --> 00:54:24,134
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were.

762
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:32,773
Speaker 1: we needed a break really and we said alright What if we just did two episodes a week - and then - the other - like Monday Wednesday in the next week could do Tuesday Thursday

763
00:54:32,913 --> 00:54:38,770
Speaker 0: and alternate and then we were gonna do that for like three months and then we'd and it wouldn't be like we'll do This until we're better.

764
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:46,510
Speaker 0: It was gonna be like we'll do this for this number of weeks and then it will be back to the show as normal on To this date, so there's no way to back out.

765
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:51,930
Speaker 1: I thought it would be something more like, you know, we we could transition to doing just two of the episodes a week.

766
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,429
Speaker 1: So it would still be doing the four shows but you know half as many of each show.

767
00:54:55,931 --> 00:55:01,310
Speaker 1: But also we take up that extra Libsyn and use it to do other things like more experimental feed more other stuff.

768
00:55:01,712 --> 00:55:03,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe maybe make a new show.

769
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:03,949
Speaker 1: who knows part

770
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:17,247
Speaker 0: of it also was really just to go in other directions for all not just in terms of the podcast itself, but other things we can do because What kind of happened to us is that I think there is only so much that a human being can do in a day.

771
00:55:17,267 --> 00:55:28,747
Speaker 0: or just like the output you can have is limited unless you're Osamu Tezuka and between our jobs and Our blogs which you noticed neither of us had posted in in a while.

772
00:55:28,968 --> 00:55:41,090
Speaker 0: Yeah and geek nights and Board gaming and all the things we have to do to have things to talk about on geek nights It got to the point where I literally had zero free time for like a month straight.

773
00:55:41,544 --> 00:55:42,472
Speaker 0: Yeah like there was it.

774
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:56,810
Speaker 0: there was a whole month where my life was nothing but work geek nights things for geek nights and then like Trying desperately to work on all my other projects and failing and I think we're we're kind of at our maximal creative out.

775
00:55:56,890 --> 00:56:05,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I wanted to use geek nights as a platform for other projects But instead geek nights sort of ate up all the available resources for all the projects.

776
00:56:05,191 --> 00:56:06,780
Speaker 1: So it's like I need you need to do.

777
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:17,990
Speaker 1: I need it as the platform But then again if it takes up all the resources like I've used all my all my you know Wood to build a platform and now I know I have no wood left to build the house on the platform.

778
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:31,729
Speaker 0: So our choice at that point was either to Basically do what it takes to make the show professional enough to where we will be able to do it with less effort with less maintenance with less time cost.

779
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:35,778
Speaker 0: and That required a significant investment.

780
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,644
Speaker 0: because pretty much up to this point.

781
00:56:37,664 --> 00:56:39,850
Speaker 0: We've invested very little money in geek nights.

782
00:56:40,171 --> 00:56:42,319
Speaker 0: We've pretty much played it by the skin of our teeth.

783
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:45,330
Speaker 0: I mean the Marantz cost more than everything else we'd ever bought.

784
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:49,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much and like when we bought new microphones it was like holy shit jacket.

785
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:53,539
Speaker 0: now Like to get beyond the diminishing returns.

786
00:56:53,579 --> 00:57:00,477
Speaker 0: to get to the next step in terms of streamlining our operation Required a somewhat substantial Financial investment.

787
00:57:00,618 --> 00:57:07,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think for it to get any better than it is Now we'd have to hire an employee and that's not out of the realm at this point.

788
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:07,706
Speaker 0: Seriously.

789
00:57:07,747 --> 00:57:08,690
Speaker 1: You don't have enough money though.

790
00:57:09,112 --> 00:57:12,627
Speaker 0: Well, it depends because I could see scenarios where that could work out.

791
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:16,260
Speaker 0: But basically We've decided to go a hundred percent.

792
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:27,630
Speaker 0: so we're now investing substantial Sums of money relative to our incomes in geek nights Which means if geek nights fails it is through no lack of effort or investment.

793
00:57:28,304 --> 00:57:37,112
Speaker 0: No So as a result We are able to defray a lot of our time costs by spending money and as a result I think you're gonna see a lot as a result of time I did.

794
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:40,608
Speaker 0: we're gonna see a lot more coming out of us in the next year.

795
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:41,632
Speaker 1: Hopefully.

796
00:57:42,354 --> 00:57:50,283
Speaker 0: if you don't that means we're just shit talkers and I the new mixer didn't get me anything and we failed at everything in Life, I only stand by the things I said.

797
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:52,357
Speaker 0: I Have big dreams.

798
00:57:52,377 --> 00:57:53,730
Speaker 1: what on for the record?

799
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:56,221
Speaker 1: I'm not a shit talker if I don't do the things.

800
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:57,106
Speaker 1: room said I would do.

801
00:57:57,206 --> 00:57:59,279
Speaker 0: cuz you know What did I say you would do?

802
00:57:59,299 --> 00:57:59,884
Speaker 0: I don't know.

803
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:00,690
Speaker 0: I said we'll try.

804
00:58:00,851 --> 00:58:01,112
Speaker 1: I'm just.

805
00:58:01,192 --> 00:58:03,445
Speaker 1: I don't want anyone give me grief for not doing something.

806
00:58:03,465 --> 00:58:04,310
Speaker 1: Someone else said I would do.

807
00:58:04,472 --> 00:58:05,929
Speaker 1: I'm the only who makes promises for me.

808
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:10,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of like how the prize situation is pretty much entirely in my realm right now.

809
00:58:10,726 --> 00:58:16,425
Speaker 0: exactly exactly Yeah, but at the same time the website is entirely in your realm.

810
00:58:16,665 --> 00:58:17,007
Speaker 1: I didn't.

811
00:58:17,187 --> 00:58:18,050
Speaker 1: what did I should talk though?

812
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kind of works out now It's kind of like.

813
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,900
Speaker 0: I mean I handle one thing Scott handles the other thing.

814
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,242
Speaker 0: like when I like I'll just email Scott every now And then and say hey, we're doing these live shows at katsu khan.

815
00:58:29,262 --> 00:58:31,490
Speaker 0: He says, okay, and then he'll email me.

816
00:58:31,892 --> 00:58:38,667
Speaker 0: This is what the website's gonna look like and I say, okay Yeah, yeah That's it's just the way it's gonna have to be.

817
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:42,838
Speaker 0: So I guess the state of the podcast is good.

818
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:44,323
Speaker 0: good not stopping.

819
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:46,188
Speaker 1: Yeah better than other podcasts.

820
00:58:46,328 --> 00:58:50,910
Speaker 1: I think so Yeah, and considering a lot of podcasts bigger than I seem to be going a little downhill.

821
00:58:51,471 --> 00:58:53,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, that could be bad for podcasts as a whole though.

822
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:54,550
Speaker 1: I don't know.

823
00:58:54,771 --> 00:58:56,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, well the thing is we have plans for that.

824
00:58:56,759 --> 00:59:00,949
Speaker 0: that I'm not gonna talk about now because we've gone on forever and once I've Said this before but I'm really hungry.

825
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:08,653
Speaker 0: But we have plans to invest in not so much promoting ourselves because we've never really promoted ourselves substantially accepted

826
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:09,395
Speaker 1: conventions is a

827
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:18,444
Speaker 0: yep, but we have plans to invest in promoting the idea of podcasting as a whole and Regardless of if any other podcasters are on board with this.

828
00:59:18,464 --> 00:59:23,050
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I think that's what's really necessary is like, you know, Nintendo did the same thing.

829
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,552
Speaker 1: They said huh?

830
00:59:24,033 --> 00:59:28,728
Speaker 1: We don't need to sell wheeze even though they succeeded at that and DS's they need to.

831
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:31,681
Speaker 1: you know There are people out there who don't buy video games.

832
00:59:31,721 --> 00:59:33,570
Speaker 1: We need to get them to buy video games first.
