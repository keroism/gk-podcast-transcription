1
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,530
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, July 2nd.

2
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:12,252
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:12,935
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:14,340
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,000
Speaker 0: Tonight, after talking a little bit about Otakon and Satoshi-Kon, we talk about Princess Tutu.

6
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:26,604
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:43,470
Speaker 0: The beauty of doing Geek Nights Wednesdays every other week instead of every week crammed in with everything else is that I will generate, no matter what, something to talk about before the next show.

8
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,522
Speaker 0: every time we do a show that is related to anime.

9
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:51,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when we're doing it every week it's hard to watch anime every week or read it kind of.

10
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,168
Speaker 0: The problem was twofold.

11
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,570
Speaker 0: One, we were busy with other stuff, so we didn't watch a lot of anime, so it wasn't like every week.

12
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,529
Speaker 0: we'd say, "Oh, I'm watching this show," and blah.

13
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,850
Speaker 0: We really didn't watch anything and we had to talk about something else.

14
00:01:04,312 --> 00:01:07,350
Speaker 0: But at the same time, we just talked about something else last week.

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:17,890
Speaker 0: And while most of the time my life is amusing on a daily basis, it is not always that I will, in the course of every single week, have an anime, manga, or comic-related anecdote.

16
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:29,622
Speaker 1: Yeah, and video game-related anecdotes happen pretty often, or you know, at least gaming in general, because you know, geeks are playing games all the time and we're using technology 90% of every waking moment of our lives.

17
00:01:29,642 --> 00:01:37,790
Speaker 0: Even though, even though it's a technology thing to say, I've realized that a good half of my gaming happenings are not actually happenings.

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,803
Speaker 0: They're just sudden nostalgia for past gaming happenings.

19
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:41,767
Speaker 1: That's the same thing.

20
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:47,950
Speaker 0: More often, I will have more conversations about how great Tribes 2 was than I will play any current FPS.

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,196
Speaker 1: Oh, we're bringing back Tribes 2, but it's Wednesday, so.

22
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:54,330
Speaker 0: Yes, good God, didn't I talk about Tribes 2 for a while yesterday?

23
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:54,908
Speaker 0: Alright, so.

24
00:01:56,932 --> 00:02:02,818
Speaker 1: Alright, so the other thing is that I'm really tired because I got home way later than Rim last night.

25
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:03,540
Speaker 0: Again, why?

26
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,990
Speaker 0: Because we went to a gaming night that was awesome last night.

27
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,079
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome, even though I didn't finish a single game.

28
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,124
Speaker 1: I played two half games.

29
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:24,304
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, the other reason that it's good to do the anime nights every other week is because, like, in a span of a week, I would read a bunch of comics and Rim would watch a bunch of anime, but not too often would we both watch or read the same thing.

30
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,218
Speaker 0: So we get to here before the show, and I'll be like, "Alright, I watch Kazen no Yojimbo.

31
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:28,680
Speaker 0: Let's review

32
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:28,740
Speaker 0: it.".

33
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,765
Speaker 0: And Scott's like, "I didn't watch

34
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:30,167
Speaker 0: shit.".

35
00:02:30,207 --> 00:02:30,388
Speaker 0: I'm like,

36
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:30,689
Speaker 0: "Bye.".

37
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,719
Speaker 0: He's like, "Well, I read these five comics.

38
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:33,483
Speaker 0: Did you read any of

39
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:33,664
Speaker 0: them?".

40
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:34,829
Speaker 0: I'm like, "I have

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:34,990
Speaker 0: them.".

42
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:36,995
Speaker 0: "One of them is in my

43
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:37,517
Speaker 0: bag.".

44
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:45,966
Speaker 1: With two weeks between the shows, now there's actually a good chance that there'll be one thing that we have both watched or read.

45
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,617
Speaker 0: However, I will warn you all, here's what happened.

46
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:55,063
Speaker 0: Instead of, "I didn't watch any of that," "Well, I didn't read any of that," I watched all of Princess Tutu, Scott watched one DVD.

47
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,210
Speaker 0: Scott read all of Jonah Hex.

48
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:59,238
Speaker 1: Well, I read all of Jonah Hex a long time ago.

49
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,805
Speaker 0: Yes, I read one volume.

50
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:01,830
Speaker 1: Are we gonna do both?

51
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,653
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

52
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:07,110
Speaker 0: No, I'm just pointing out that basically the slider moved a little bit toward the middle.

53
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,112
Speaker 1: That's alright.

54
00:03:08,173 --> 00:03:10,562
Speaker 1: It moved close enough towards the middle to get a show out.

55
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:11,847
Speaker 1: That's all we need.

56
00:03:11,968 --> 00:03:21,850
Speaker 0: But anyway, because we're doing, you know, we didn't get to talk about this right after it happened, but we got to meet my, I think, my favorite director ever.

57
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,573
Speaker 0: Nah.

58
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:24,096
Speaker 0: I don't know.

59
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,643
Speaker 0: Miyazaki's right up there.

60
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:26,990
Speaker 0: They might be equal in my mind.

61
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,147
Speaker 0: I think Miyazaki is probably more important and possibly better, but... Tezuka directed.

62
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:33,669
Speaker 0: Yes, yes.

63
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:34,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, fine.

64
00:03:34,872 --> 00:03:38,547
Speaker 0: So there's a holy triad of Miyazaki, Tezuka, and Satoshi Kama.

65
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,089
Speaker 1: What about Oshii?

66
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:42,738
Speaker 0: Oshii is really important, but he's the prince.

67
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:44,162
Speaker 1: What about, um...

68
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,692
Speaker 0: Stop naming people.

69
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:58,789
Speaker 0: We got to meet Satoshi Kan, and the one thing I can say about Satoshi Kan as opposed to many other directors is that the man has never made a mistake, as far as I can tell.

70
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:00,932
Speaker 1: Mistake?

71
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:01,514
Speaker 1: I don't know.

72
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:03,082
Speaker 1: He said his mangas are pretty bad.

73
00:04:03,102 --> 00:04:04,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but I haven't read them.

74
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:12,114
Speaker 1: I haven't read them either, but he said that they were unsuccessful, and people always ask him, you know, about his manga, like, "Oh, you want to know about your

75
00:04:12,134 --> 00:04:12,415
Speaker 1: manga?".

76
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,077
Speaker 1: and he's like, "Why?

77
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:16,148
Speaker 1: They sucked and no one bought them, and now you want to know about them because my anime is

78
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:16,369
Speaker 1: good?".

79
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,673
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Are you going to go back to

80
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,034
Speaker 1: manga?".

81
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:22,305
Speaker 1: He's like, "No, my anime is rocking the house, and my manga sucked.

82
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:23,629
Speaker 1: Why would I go back to what I sucked

83
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,789
Speaker 1: at?".

84
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,416
Speaker 0: But basically, we went to see at Lincoln Center.

85
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:31,048
Speaker 0: Satoshi Kan got a retrospective at Lincoln Center in New York City, so basically...

86
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:39,310
Speaker 1: It was in Lincoln Center, which is actually many buildings, but it wasn't in, you know, like, the opera house, the ballet house.

87
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,790
Speaker 0: Why would it be in the opera house or the ballet house?

88
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,002
Speaker 1: Because if you're mad awesome, then you can watch a movie in there.

89
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:47,230
Speaker 1: It's just, you know, really, uh, big.

90
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,189
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

91
00:04:48,577 --> 00:04:48,730
Speaker 1: Yeah.

92
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,889
Speaker 1: Anyway... It was in the school next door.

93
00:04:51,310 --> 00:05:04,490
Speaker 0: Satoshi Kan, at the Walter Reed Theater at Lincoln Center, was given a retrospective, and basically over the course of several days, they showed pretty much all of his animated works, including a large chunk of Paranoid Agent.

94
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:16,587
Speaker 0: And the one night we went, they were showing Paprika, which, while I was super tired, and I was really only going to see Satoshi Kan, watching Paprika on the big screen again was suddenly worth it.

95
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:18,850
Speaker 0: the moment it started, because I freaking loved that movie.

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,870
Speaker 1: Like, up until, like, we actually got there, I was sort of like, "Uh..." because I committed to this way in advance, right?

97
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Emily was like, "Hey, Satoshi Kan," and we were both like, "We're gonna be there, hot

98
00:05:29,568 --> 00:05:29,789
Speaker 0: shit.".

99
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, like, as soon, like, during the whole day, I was like, "Oh, I have to go to this thing.

100
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,405
Speaker 1: I'd rather not go to this thing.

101
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:38,687
Speaker 1: I'm not feeling it today.

102
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:39,810
Speaker 1: I want to go home and go to

103
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,010
Speaker 1: bed.".

104
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:48,290
Speaker 0: See, for me, it was just, I'd stayed up late the previous two nights, so I was freaking exhausted, but I really, really wanted to meet Satoshi Kan.

105
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:55,439
Speaker 1: I did, but I felt like, you know, even that, I would have other chances, and, you know, in the future, he's not that old.

106
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,661
Speaker 1: I'd see him again.

107
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:58,203
Speaker 1: He's in the U.S.

108
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,485
Speaker 1: relatively often.

109
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,048
Speaker 1: Other people have seen him, you know, in other places in the

110
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:02,549
Speaker 1: U.S.,

111
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:02,729
Speaker 1: so...

112
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,934
Speaker 0: I wasn't quite as cynical as Scott.

113
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:06,498
Speaker 0: I was super excited about the event.

114
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,850
Speaker 0: I was just, I was tired, and I wasn't super excited about seeing Paprika again.

115
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't.

116
00:06:11,852 --> 00:06:12,893
Speaker 1: I danced mostly.

117
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:20,487
Speaker 1: I didn't want to watch the movie again, but anyway, when I actually got in there and watched the movie again, well, I could always watch the opener again.

118
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:21,789
Speaker 1: It was the opener to that movie.

119
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:22,090
Speaker 1: Good God.

120
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,421
Speaker 0: The credits, the opening credits to Paprika are some of the...

121
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:28,549
Speaker 1: I can't express to you... Best opening credits ever.

122
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,313
Speaker 0: Might be.

123
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:34,430
Speaker 1: I can't express to you how... Full-length motion picture, animated, whatnot.

124
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:45,546
Speaker 0: They're one of those few rare things where you get that slight chill of, like, you're watching it, and you're experiencing it, but this meta part of your brain can't enjoy it because it's saying, "This is so good.

125
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,968
Speaker 0: Look at how good this is.

126
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,049
Speaker 0: I can't get over how good it

127
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:48,250
Speaker 0: is.".

128
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:59,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much, and really, the one thing that you need to make that opener really work is a powerful sound system, because I saw that opener way before I ever saw Paprika, but I watched it...

129
00:06:59,250 --> 00:06:59,790
Speaker 0: On loop for, like, a week.

130
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:12,448
Speaker 1: I watched it on the Sony Motion Pictures Classics website in a little tiny box with, like, little headphones on, and it didn't really do anything for me, but I saw the exact same thing in the theater, and it just blows you away.

131
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,290
Speaker 1: Anyway...

132
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:21,450
Speaker 0: Also, Paprika is an awesome movie, and seeing it again, it made so much sense, and it was so good.

133
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,813
Speaker 1: Seeing it the first time, I was like, "Well, that wasn't bad.

134
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:25,233
Speaker 1: It was

135
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:25,854
Speaker 1: alright.".

136
00:07:25,994 --> 00:07:39,527
Speaker 1: But I didn't really get a lot of it, but watching it the second time, I don't know if there were different subtitles on it this time, or just because I had seen it before, even though I barely remembered most of it from, you know, the first time I saw it, but it made a whole lot of sense the second time.

137
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,090
Speaker 1: In fact, I sort of felt stupid for not getting it the first time.

138
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,385
Speaker 0: Yeah, I noticed all these little clues, and all these things, like, "Whoa, duh.

139
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:48,589
Speaker 0: Oh, duh

140
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:48,970
Speaker 0: again.".

141
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:56,368
Speaker 1: It's really, really straightforward, and I just didn't get it the first time I watched it, but the second time I watched it, it was just obvious, like, "Oh,

142
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:56,669
Speaker 1: alright.".

143
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:03,644
Speaker 0: But also, again, that movie is just... If you have not seen Paprika, one, make sure you've seen everything else.

144
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:06,510
Speaker 0: Satoshi Kon did first, and then go see Paprika.

145
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:06,974
Speaker 1: I don't know.

146
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,310
Speaker 1: You can watch him any order, really.

147
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

148
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:11,850
Speaker 0: I would watch him in the order they were put out.

149
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,049
Speaker 1: That's a good way, you know, but it's not any worse than doing it in any other order.

150
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,608
Speaker 0: Ah, I get this feeling.

151
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,443
Speaker 1: Tokyo Godfather is a good one to watch first, actually.

152
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,370
Speaker 1: It's the most accessible.

153
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, Perfect Blue is the most disturbing.

154
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,890
Speaker 0: Also, I think it's my favorite in the end.

155
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

156
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,636
Speaker 1: Uh... Yeah, maybe.

157
00:08:26,676 --> 00:08:26,957
Speaker 1: I don't know.

158
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,584
Speaker 1: I really like Tokyo Godfathers.

159
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:31,790
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'm really tired.

160
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:45,430
Speaker 0: The deal was, we see Paprika, and then Satoshi Kon comes out, and he looks kind of... I mean, you've seen pictures of him before, but seeing him in person, he looks, and he carries himself pretty much exactly the way you'd expect that kind of person to carry themselves.

161
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:45,852
Speaker 0: It's weird.

162
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:51,278
Speaker 1: You know, the thing is, whenever people see artists, right, is they always expect the artist to reflect the art.

163
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:56,428
Speaker 1: Like, you ever see those pictures of, like, a person and their dog, and they're, like, the same, even though they're not?

164
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,317
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's very much like, "Oh, yeah," and sometimes it's completely the opposite, because there's really no true correlation.

165
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:02,779
Speaker 1: Yep.

166
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,510
Speaker 1: Satoshi Kon, you know, it's like his movies.

167
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,462
Speaker 1: You'd think he's, like, a weird or scary guy, but he's not.

168
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:09,808
Speaker 1: He's just a normal dude.

169
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:10,130
Speaker 1: What's up?

170
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:10,672
Speaker 0: I don't know.

171
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:13,987
Speaker 0: He's not quite a level of Mr.

172
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:14,510
Speaker 0: Watchman.

173
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,576
Speaker 1: No, no.

174
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:16,850
Speaker 1: You mean Alan Moore?

175
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:24,590
Speaker 0: He's just really cool, and he carries himself, and he's really funny, and he's really... The things he said were really interesting and really insightful.

176
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:24,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

177
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:28,108
Speaker 1: He's smart and level-headed and not weird and not crazy.

178
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:31,875
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know.

179
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:36,376
Speaker 1: He's generally all right, a lot better than a lot of other anime people who are, you know, kind of weird.

180
00:09:36,738 --> 00:09:54,524
Speaker 0: Now, what they do at Lincoln Center when they have this sort of thing is, you know, they showed his work, and then they ask him a few questions, and then they show a clip from, like, Perfect Blue or something, and then they talk about that, and then they show another clip and talk about that, and it was kind of this live, semi-impromptu, semi-planned interview, and then at the end, of course, they take questions from the audience.

181
00:09:54,564 --> 00:10:09,885
Speaker 0: Now, I'm sure you all know when we talked about Paranoia Agent that I had a pet theory as to what I thought Paranoia Agent was about, and I had all these reasons for it, and I had so much, and I'd always thought, "Man, if only I could ask Satoshi Kon to find out if I'm full of shit or not,".

182
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:15,512
Speaker 0: because as you all know, it's really easy to read into things like Lord of the Rings and, "Oh, it's a World War II blob,".

183
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,135
Speaker 0: but then J.R.R.

184
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:18,327
Speaker 0: Tolkien says, "Nah, just a bunch of elves and

185
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:18,689
Speaker 0: hobbits.".

186
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,210
Speaker 1: I mean, you could read anything into anything, and there's only so many stories out there.

187
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,359
Speaker 1: You can match up.

188
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,370
Speaker 1: You know, we were just talking about matching.

189
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:35,222
Speaker 0: But at the same time, there's definitely sometimes an artist will make a metaphor, and if you ask them, "Yes, I based it on that.

190
00:10:35,623 --> 00:10:37,369
Speaker 0: Congratulations, you figured me out,".

191
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,089
Speaker 0: or, "Well, I guess you didn't read the autobiography where I said I based it on

192
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:41,250
Speaker 0: that.".

193
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like discovering the intent.

194
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:49,710
Speaker 1: Somehow, if the author intended it, then somehow it's better than if you just match it up on your own.

195
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,759
Speaker 0: No, it's more interesting, I think.

196
00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:02,447
Speaker 0: It's cool when you read a work, then there's a non-explicit kind of parallel, and you see it, and then you find out that that is exactly what the artist was intending.

197
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:04,114
Speaker 0: It's kind of a, "Oh, wow, that's

198
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:04,375
Speaker 0: cool.".

199
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:07,930
Speaker 1: They did good arts because their message actually got through.

200
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,343
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's kind of this indirect meeting of minds.

201
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:17,957
Speaker 0: I was going to quote something from The Prince of Nothing, but we've talked about that enough, but there's a very relevant scene related to this sort of thing.

202
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,090
Speaker 1: About seeing something or not?

203
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:27,770
Speaker 0: No, more about what it is to read something or experience an art someone else created.

204
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:37,808
Speaker 0: But anyway, my pet theory, to sum it up in a very kind of oversimplified way, was that Paranoid Agent was about Japan's atrocities in World War II.

205
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:42,589
Speaker 0: My idea was much more complex than that, but that's kind of what you boil it down to.

206
00:11:43,973 --> 00:11:45,423
Speaker 0: I tried to ask my question.

207
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:48,889
Speaker 0: There's a million people there, and everyone had a million things to ask them, so I didn't get called on.

208
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:56,678
Speaker 0: Then, at the end, we go out, and he totally stayed and talked to anyone who wanted to talk to him, and signed autographs and pictures.

209
00:11:56,718 --> 00:11:59,270
Speaker 0: There was a gallery of other art of his outside.

210
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:02,301
Speaker 0: He was totally cool, but I wanted to ask.

211
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,409
Speaker 0: Emily was like, "You want me to just ask

212
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:04,509
Speaker 0: him?".

213
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:05,472
Speaker 0: I was like, "Yes!

214
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:06,215
Speaker 0: Good God,

215
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:06,556
Speaker 0: yes!".

216
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:10,850
Speaker 0: So we walk over, and Emily asks him my crazy theory in Japanese.

217
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:19,168
Speaker 0: He considers it, and he looks at us, and he says, "No, I hadn't really intended that, but that's a really interesting idea, and it kind of

218
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:19,370
Speaker 0: fits.".

219
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,090
Speaker 0: So I was totally wrong, but he didn't blow me, he didn't completely shoot me down.

220
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:29,587
Speaker 0: But he basically said, "No, I didn't intend that at

221
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:29,789
Speaker 0: all.".

222
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:34,489
Speaker 1: I mean, if you would have said, "Is Paranoid Agent about how farts you

223
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:34,750
Speaker 1: smell?".

224
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,090
Speaker 1: He'd be like, "Well, you know, I didn't intend that, but that's a good way of looking at

225
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,150
Speaker 1: it.".

226
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,637
Speaker 0: I think he would have said, "What are you, crazy?

227
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:39,979
Speaker 0: No!

228
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,466
Speaker 0: No one farts in farts!

229
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:42,270
Speaker 1: Where do you get that?

230
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:46,517
Speaker 1: Well, the bat is a metaphor for the smell, and how it knocks you out, because it's so

231
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:46,983
Speaker 1: disgusting.".

232
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:53,538
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I feel relieved, because that's one of those things where you say like, "Oh, if only I could ask the person.

233
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:55,166
Speaker 0: I got to ask the person.

234
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:55,728
Speaker 0: I got an

235
00:12:55,889 --> 00:12:56,090
Speaker 0: answer.".

236
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,347
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, a lot of other things where, "Well, let's ask

237
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:00,869
Speaker 1: Shakespeare.".

238
00:13:01,551 --> 00:13:02,414
Speaker 0: Or, "Fucking

239
00:13:02,494 --> 00:13:03,236
Speaker 0: Ikuhara.".

240
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:10,499
Speaker 0: Well, I can't tell you why Toga did what he did in Utena, because, you see, I don't know what Toga was thinking.

241
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,844
Speaker 0: You'd have to ask him.

242
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck you, Ikuhara.

243
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,455
Speaker 1: He's a crazy, crazy man.

244
00:13:15,515 --> 00:13:17,844
Speaker 1: Not a smart man like Satoshi Kon.

245
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:23,330
Speaker 1: That's why Satoshi Kon is making the mad money as an Ikuhara, I assume, must be in a poorhouse somewhere.

246
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,650
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure Ikuhara is doing very well.

247
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,470
Speaker 1: He's not doing anything, as far as I can tell.

248
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,456
Speaker 0: He did at least one thing after Utena.

249
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,821
Speaker 0: I think he was smart.

250
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:32,949
Speaker 0: There's a fine on one end.

251
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,434
Speaker 0: There's the smart scale, right?

252
00:13:35,056 --> 00:13:37,965
Speaker 0: But directly parallel to that is the crazy scale.

253
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,774
Speaker 0: And if you have smart, 100% smart, and 0% crazy, you get Satoshi Kon.

254
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:41,897
Speaker 0: 100% smart, 100% crazy, you get Shiro.

255
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,833
Speaker 0: Maybe Kojima.

256
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,045
Speaker 0: And there's those fine lines.

257
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,573
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say where I think Ikuhara is, but he's not 0% smart.

258
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:57,296
Speaker 0: He's not 100% smart.

259
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,204
Speaker 0: He's negative 100% smart.

260
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:07,630
Speaker 0: I like what Ikuhara did, and I'll leave it at... Well, one thing he did, and I'll leave it at that.

261
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,075
Speaker 1: He likes that sort of thing.

262
00:14:09,336 --> 00:14:10,600
Speaker 0: God, God.

263
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:13,350
Speaker 0: All right, last thing, and I'm going to move on from this.

264
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:33,764
Speaker 0: If you ever want to find out what Kunihiko Ikuhara is really like, the guy who made Utena with Chiyo Saito, and the guy who made the Utena movie, and nominally with Chiyo Saito, watch the Utena movie with the commentary from Ikuhara.

265
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:38,537
Speaker 0: Because you will learn the depths of the creepy dude that is Ikuhara.

266
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Speaker 0: When he gets distracted by the creepy shit going on in the movie he made, it's kind of epically hilarious.

267
00:14:46,323 --> 00:14:48,710
Speaker 1: Naked cars, naked cars.

268
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:56,803
Speaker 0: It was totally awesome to meet Satoshi Kon, and the only thing I have to say, I'm not really calling anyone out, but I want to mention this.

269
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:05,716
Speaker 0: People ask questions, there's always... When you go to this sort of thing all the time, there's always the kinds of people who ask certain questions.

270
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:08,284
Speaker 0: There's always...

271
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:16,415
Speaker 1: You could categorize the questions in many different ways, but I categorize questions asked to panels into pretty much three categories.

272
00:15:16,936 --> 00:15:18,742
Speaker 1: There's the, well, maybe four.

273
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:21,570
Speaker 1: There's the smart question, it is very rare.

274
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,926
Speaker 1: There is the pretty much question everyone asks, like, "What's your inspiration?

275
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:29,115
Speaker 1: How do I become just like you?

276
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,200
Speaker 1: Why are you so

277
00:15:30,401 --> 00:15:30,743
Speaker 1: awesome?".

278
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:32,070
Speaker 1: Those are the stupid questions.

279
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,430
Speaker 0: There's the, I'm not actually asking a question, I'm showing off.

280
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,988
Speaker 1: Well, it's sort of like the pretentious question, where it's not really a question, or it's not a question that anyone can actually answer.

281
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:58,587
Speaker 0: Now, these questions are usually spotted because they begin with a long expository statement that is not a question, and end with a barely relevant question, like, "Well, having read your insert super obscure work done by a guy you're asking the question to, blah, blah,

282
00:15:58,627 --> 00:15:59,009
Speaker 0: blah.".

283
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,796
Speaker 1: I noticed you had a lot of imagery involving elephants, and as it related to this, and how it means this, and this, and this.

284
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:12,460
Speaker 1: Is that imagery relating to you in this kind of way, or in this kind of way?

285
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,166
Speaker 1: And it's just like, uh...

286
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:24,502
Speaker 0: Now, these are often also noted, especially at an anime convention, by the person in the audience who clearly speaks English, who asks the question in Japanese, thus fucking everything up in terms of filming and translating.

287
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:25,249
Speaker 1: Yeah.

288
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,920
Speaker 0: Bonus points if they don't actually speak Japanese, and are reading off of something that is not written in Japanese.

289
00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:31,645
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

290
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:39,580
Speaker 1: So those are the... And then the final kind of question is sort of like the tasteless question, which is sort of like, "Oh, why are you asking that?

291
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,905
Speaker 1: You know, you shouldn't be asking that

292
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:41,207
Speaker 1: shit.".

293
00:16:41,608 --> 00:16:46,485
Speaker 1: Like, it's something... Maybe you're asking something that's taboo, or out of place.

294
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:47,830
Speaker 1: Like, for example...

295
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,057
Speaker 0: I think the word is crass.

296
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:59,919
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, for example, there was that guy from Gainax who had that whole issue that went on, like, you know, 2chan or something like that, and he got to resign or something.

297
00:17:00,442 --> 00:17:02,110
Speaker 1: You don't really ask about that, you know?

298
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,221
Speaker 1: It's like it doesn't...

299
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,760
Speaker 0: Unless you're, like, in a hard-heading journalist situation.

300
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,162
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:09,859
Speaker 1: If you're at a panel at a convention, that's not what you go for, you know?

302
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,858
Speaker 1: Or, like, if a voice actor was, like, having a feud with someone else.

303
00:17:13,897 --> 00:17:16,010
Speaker 1: You don't go asking about that kind of thing, you know?

304
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,939
Speaker 1: You only ask about what's really relevant.

305
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,692
Speaker 1: I mean, you can ask hard questions about what's relevant.

306
00:17:20,733 --> 00:17:23,426
Speaker 1: Like, at a Bandai visual panel, you can say, "Why are your DVDs so

307
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:23,910
Speaker 1: expensive?".

308
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:29,369
Speaker 1: But at a Bandai entertainment panel, I wouldn't go and ask, "Did you fire that Bandai visual guy's

309
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:29,791
Speaker 1: ass?"?

310
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't ask that.

311
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:31,820
Speaker 0: Yes.

312
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:38,890
Speaker 0: Now, in the interest of friendship and being nice, which is a change for Geeknives, I'm not gonna say who asked this question.

313
00:17:39,452 --> 00:17:41,070
Speaker 0: But I would like to point out... Well, they know.

314
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,932
Speaker 0: Yes, they do.

315
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:50,358
Speaker 0: But I just want to say that this was one of the most tasteless questions I have ever seen someone ask someone at a panel.

316
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,596
Speaker 0: It was basically, "So, you know what happened in Akihabara, right?

317
00:17:55,898 --> 00:17:56,662
Speaker 0: What do you think of

318
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:56,983
Speaker 0: that?".

319
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:57,084
Speaker 0: Yeah.

320
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,267
Speaker 0: Now, this was at a panel about Satoshi Kon and a retrospective of his works.

321
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:08,369
Speaker 0: And they basically asked, "So, yeah, you know that random murder that happened in the country you happened to be from?

322
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:09,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, what do you think of that?

323
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:10,799
Speaker 0: Never mind your works or

324
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,040
Speaker 0: anything.".

325
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:20,060
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's slightly related because it's an Akihabara, and the murder was committed by, basically, the worst kind of otaku in the world.

326
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:24,416
Speaker 1: And he creates works which appeal to that demographic somewhat.

327
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,189
Speaker 0: But it was just the question...

328
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:33,412
Speaker 1: But that's like if you asked Will Wright, who makes video games, about Columbine right after it happened.

329
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:35,002
Speaker 1: Be like, "Hey, Will Wright, what do you think about

330
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:35,666
Speaker 1: Columbine?".

331
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,273
Speaker 1: He's like, "Why are you asking me about...".

332
00:18:38,196 --> 00:18:42,130
Speaker 1: I don't think that's really... It's really not relevant to the person.

333
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:45,990
Speaker 0: Now, to his credit, though, to Satoshi Kon's credit...

334
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, he answered perfectly.

335
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,513
Speaker 0: Not only did he take the question in stride, but despite the translator, was a little flustered.

336
00:18:53,857 --> 00:19:06,777
Speaker 0: Satoshi Kon actually had a really interesting answer about how, in particular, the person who committed this crime, it was almost as though it was a crime committed against victims.

337
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,186
Speaker 0: The person didn't care who the victims were.

338
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:20,643
Speaker 0: And in the end, maybe the perpetrator was kind of created by the media or created by society such that it didn't matter who the person doing the crime was either.

339
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:25,301
Speaker 0: It was this really interesting answer that I think lost a little bit in the translation.

340
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, it did a lot of things.

341
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:32,970
Speaker 1: I mean, the translator, she was really, really good, but she was also paraphrasing a bit too much.

342
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:37,673
Speaker 0: Basically, a question we could ask, and Satoshi Kon would talk for five minutes straight without breathing.

343
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:38,358
Speaker 1: That's the thing, though.

344
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:47,483
Speaker 1: Well, he wouldn't breathe, but he would go... Yeah, you know, and I realize, you know, and it's like in the

345
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:47,965
Speaker 1: U.S.,

346
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:48,868
Speaker 1: in English, right?

347
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:56,733
Speaker 1: If I sit here on geek nights and I go "sun, sun, sun, uh, sun, sun, eh," right, then obviously I'm having a bad night like tonight.

348
00:19:57,175 --> 00:20:02,655
Speaker 1: But in Japan, or at least in the Japanese language, it seems like that everyone does that all the time.

349
00:20:02,716 --> 00:20:06,351
Speaker 1: And it doesn't make you sound dumb or slow or like you can't think quickly.

350
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,141
Speaker 0: Well, different languages do different things.

351
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:10,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but I just think it's an interesting thing.

352
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:10,613
Speaker 1: It is.

353
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:16,839
Speaker 0: But also, Satoshi Kon would talk for a long time without giving the translator a chance to translate any of it.

354
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,985
Speaker 1: Well, she had a little notepad.

355
00:20:18,005 --> 00:20:19,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it worked pretty well.

356
00:20:19,573 --> 00:20:26,863
Speaker 0: But, I mean, Emily was there, and she, it was obvious from her responses that the translation was being brevined somewhat.

357
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:28,710
Speaker 0: That's totally a cromulent word, so shut up.

358
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,577
Speaker 0: Anyone out there is about to complain about that.

359
00:20:30,838 --> 00:20:33,508
Speaker 1: It was being paraphrased, like I said.

360
00:20:33,528 --> 00:20:35,371
Speaker 0: Made more brief.

361
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:36,515
Speaker 1: Paraphrased.

362
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:37,859
Speaker 1: I gave you the word.

363
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:38,702
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm well away.

364
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:40,167
Speaker 1: The cromulent word.

365
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:43,197
Speaker 0: No, no, that's not a cr-, that is not a cromulent word.

366
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:45,725
Speaker 0: No, it's truly cromulent.

367
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:50,502
Speaker 0: It was more than, I was thinking leavened, and I like the word leavened, so I wanted to take brief.

368
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:52,791
Speaker 1: Like, like, you gave Satoshi Kon the yeast?

369
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,218
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?

370
00:20:55,238 --> 00:20:57,063
Speaker 1: Rim like's giving him the yeast?

371
00:20:57,705 --> 00:21:02,582
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, uh, you might want to get some of that, uh, cream from the store if you got the yeast.

372
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:06,777
Speaker 0: So, Scott, well, do you get Monostat 7-3 or 1?

373
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:07,660
Speaker 1: Is that what that does?

374
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,803
Speaker 1: I don't know.

375
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,047
Speaker 1: I just know that there's a cream.

376
00:21:10,087 --> 00:21:10,910
Speaker 1: I don't know which one.

377
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:15,466
Speaker 0: Okay, so, is in the non-Rim and Scott got to geek out over Satoshi Kon in person.

378
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,550
Speaker 0: What's in the news?

379
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,922
Speaker 1: So, I was just talking a few minutes ago about the Bandai visuals.

380
00:21:21,082 --> 00:21:22,287
Speaker 1: Oh, huh, huh.

381
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, they went out of business.

382
00:21:23,712 --> 00:21:24,295
Speaker 1: Big surprise.

383
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:25,419
Speaker 0: Big surprise.

384
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:34,332
Speaker 0: It always amazes me how often a company will do something or start, and it's like, I know along with the majority of the world who knows what they're doing.

385
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:35,235
Speaker 0: that is a bad idea.

386
00:21:35,255 --> 00:21:36,560
Speaker 0: It's like everyone knows.

387
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,804
Speaker 0: it's a bad idea but them.

388
00:21:37,824 --> 00:21:39,249
Speaker 0: Don't they know?

389
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:52,133
Speaker 1: So, anyway, they got folded back into Bandai Entertainment, which is the Bandai that existed was putting out Gundam DVDs and Cowboy Bebop DVDs and Escaflowne DVDs and such and such and such, right?

390
00:21:52,173 --> 00:22:06,504
Speaker 1: So, now they're both, it's just Bandai Entertainment is the only company now, and they have all of Bandai Visuals stuff, and they put out an announcement, basically, because the anime expo is really soon-ish, like this weekend, and they're basically like,

391
00:22:06,584 --> 00:22:07,006
Speaker 0: all right,

392
00:22:07,388 --> 00:22:09,517
Speaker 1: here's what we're going to do with the Bandai Visuals stuff.

393
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:21,190
Speaker 1: They're going to put it under the, you know, the Oniyamis label, which is where it was under already, which is, if you have never seen Wings of Oniyamis, you probably should, because I haven't, because I suck, and Bandai Visuals DVD is too expensive, or I'd buy it.

394
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:25,610
Speaker 0: Hey, don't worry, I've only seen it once, and I saw like an eighth generation fan sub.

395
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,961
Speaker 0: It cuts out for about 10 minutes in the middle.

396
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:39,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's like, you know, that's like their highlight movie, so that's like, that label basically means, you know, awesome, QWERTY anime, and that's, you know, QWERTY?

397
00:22:40,136 --> 00:22:40,957
Speaker 1: QWERTY.

398
00:22:41,258 --> 00:22:42,441
Speaker 0: Was it Ferrier?

399
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:43,924
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.

400
00:22:45,246 --> 00:22:46,409
Speaker 0: Opposite of Inferior?

401
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:46,489
Speaker 1: Yes.

402
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:51,388
Speaker 0: Bonus points to anyone who isn't Scout Johnson who knows what that is a reference to.

403
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:53,556
Speaker 1: Anyone who's in the front row crew knows that's a reference to.

404
00:22:53,596 --> 00:22:53,898
Speaker 1: Yes.

405
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:03,180
Speaker 1: All right, so, um, all right, so basically, good game.

406
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:04,042
Speaker 0: GGG.

407
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:18,762
Speaker 1: All right, so basically the things that they had already announced that were going to be delayed indefinitely, like Engage Planet Kizdom, I just love that name, Kizdom, Shigofumi, Sola, True Tears, whatever.

408
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:21,810
Speaker 1: Those are still indefinitely gone, right?

409
00:23:23,931 --> 00:23:29,692
Speaker 1: Basically, most of the DVDs and whatnot that they were already coming out with are going to keep coming out.

410
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,379
Speaker 1: And they're basically, there's only a few things have gone missing, like, you know, the original Gunbuster video and whatnot.

411
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,936
Speaker 1: The thing is, they haven't really changed the prices on any of these things.

412
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:43,698
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

413
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,280
Speaker 1: So what?

414
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:49,397
Speaker 1: what did they really accomplish by closing Bandai Visual besides getting a bunch of people off the payroll?

415
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:50,560
Speaker 1: Nothing.

416
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:53,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, like, let's see.

417
00:23:55,031 --> 00:23:55,472
Speaker 1: Here we go.

418
00:23:56,454 --> 00:23:59,421
Speaker 1: Gunbuster two version volume one DVD.

419
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:00,483
Speaker 1: Forty dollars.

420
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,837
Speaker 1: Freedom volume one HD DVD and also regular DVD on the same disc.

421
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,984
Speaker 1: Forty dollars for what?

422
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:08,827
Speaker 1: One episode?

423
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,452
Speaker 0: That's cheaper than your mom.

424
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:12,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I'm so great.

425
00:24:12,738 --> 00:24:15,727
Speaker 1: But so still too expensive.

426
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:16,489
Speaker 1: You haven't fixed it.

427
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:18,200
Speaker 1: I mean, here's the thing that really bothers me.

428
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,025
Speaker 1: Look at some of these things.

429
00:24:19,085 --> 00:24:20,713
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that they were putting out.

430
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:21,858
Speaker 1: Jin Ro.

431
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:22,299
Speaker 1: Right.

432
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,106
Speaker 1: We saw Jin Ro back in the day on DVD.

433
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:24,347
Speaker 1: Right.

434
00:24:24,568 --> 00:24:26,716
Speaker 1: It cost us less than 20 bucks for those DVDs.

435
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,246
Speaker 1: They got a Blu-ray version of Jin Ro now.

436
00:24:29,347 --> 00:24:30,030
Speaker 1: Eighty dollars.

437
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:35,269
Speaker 0: Yes, that is totally worth every single one of those dollars.

438
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,994
Speaker 1: Sarcasm detector exploding.

439
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,658
Speaker 0: A sarcasm detector.

440
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:40,821
Speaker 0: How useful is that?

441
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:42,826
Speaker 0: That's useful.

442
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:42,926
Speaker 0: Yeah.

443
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,289
Speaker 1: All right.

444
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,337
Speaker 1: So useful as an 80 dollar Jin Ro Blu-ray.

445
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,342
Speaker 0: So Otacon.

446
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:53,355
Speaker 0: Otacon this year is just shaping up like every time.

447
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:54,822
Speaker 1: there's how many weeks and how many?

448
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:56,428
Speaker 1: Let's do a little countdown here.

449
00:24:56,449 --> 00:24:56,710
Speaker 1: All right.

450
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,754
Speaker 1: So exactly.

451
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:58,215
Speaker 0: Oh, crap.

452
00:24:58,236 --> 00:24:59,903
Speaker 0: There's no counter on the Otacon website.

453
00:24:59,923 --> 00:25:00,746
Speaker 0: Five, six.

454
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:05,402
Speaker 1: I think it's this weekend, the weekend after that, the weekend after that.

455
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,371
Speaker 1: So that's this weekend, which is July 4th weekend.

456
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,719
Speaker 1: One, two, three, four weekends.

457
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,947
Speaker 1: And that fourth weekend is Connecticut.

458
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:18,279
Speaker 1: And then the fifth weekend is Otacon, if I am correct.

459
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:18,861
Speaker 0: No one.

460
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:20,709
Speaker 0: If you're around, go to Connecticut.

461
00:25:20,749 --> 00:25:22,896
Speaker 0: We're running a million panels and a ton of stuff.

462
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:23,718
Speaker 1: I am correct.

463
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:27,470
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's a bunch of Otacon news.

464
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:36,179
Speaker 0: I'm get through it all because one, it was announced just recently that Peter S. Beagle, the person responsible for the last unicorn, is going to be at Otacon.

465
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,484
Speaker 0: He was at Otacon last year.

466
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:41,037
Speaker 1: I totally miss like I didn't totally miss him.

467
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:41,318
Speaker 1: Right.

468
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:46,196
Speaker 1: It's like he was there, but like he's in the dealer's room at this table almost the whole time.

469
00:25:46,216 --> 00:25:52,540
Speaker 0: Well, this year he's doing a screening of the last unicorn by Q&A.

470
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,483
Speaker 1: There you go.

471
00:25:53,523 --> 00:25:57,880
Speaker 1: That's how it's done because last year he was in the dealer's room and I walked by and I was like, ha ha.

472
00:25:58,201 --> 00:25:59,748
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, last unicorn guy.

473
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:02,682
Speaker 1: I thought I heard that he was going to be here, but that was all I got out of it.

474
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:05,394
Speaker 1: So now I don't think I got to go to that screening.

475
00:26:05,535 --> 00:26:14,423
Speaker 0: Also announced that our friend Peter Fernandez, the original voice of Speed Racer, who was totally awesome, is going to be at Otacon.

476
00:26:15,386 --> 00:26:18,178
Speaker 0: I hope, I mean, no, I don't think we're going to do our anime match game.

477
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:18,560
Speaker 0: It's weird.

478
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:26,532
Speaker 0: Otacon is the only con we don't run this game show at, but almost every, like half the voice actors at Otacon have been on our match game.

479
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,839
Speaker 1: I don't know.

480
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:28,482
Speaker 1: Let's look at the list.

481
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:29,246
Speaker 1: We could figure it out.

482
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:30,070
Speaker 0: I'll figure it out later.

483
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,918
Speaker 0: I'll post some sort of who's been on it, who hasn't.

484
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:34,993
Speaker 0: But anyway, Peter Fernandez is totally awesome.

485
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:37,584
Speaker 0: And if whatever panel he does, you should totally go to it.

486
00:26:38,006 --> 00:26:38,308
Speaker 1: Yeah.

487
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:45,633
Speaker 1: Cause I mean, you're going to see this little old man hobbling, looking all fragile, booming radio voice of the gods.

488
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,819
Speaker 0: Pretty much the man has presence.

489
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,930
Speaker 1: I want me some radio voice training, radio voice training.

490
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,202
Speaker 0: I'm going to get some, actually, it's kind of expensive.

491
00:26:54,222 --> 00:26:58,097
Speaker 0: I was looking into it, but Peter Fernandez has some gray shade oratory.

492
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,842
Speaker 0: Let me tell you what for real.

493
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:09,816
Speaker 0: But, uh, one more announcement Otacon, you know, one thing that has again, be said about Otacon is that it has grown almost entirely through word of mouth.

494
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:12,024
Speaker 0: They don't really advertise.

495
00:27:12,285 --> 00:27:13,729
Speaker 0: people just know, or they don't.

496
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:22,301
Speaker 0: And despite the fact that 20 to 25,000 people show up at Otacon every year, I'll go to Kineticon or Katsucon, which is right there.

497
00:27:22,322 --> 00:27:24,650
Speaker 0: And people have never heard of Otacon.

498
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:29,283
Speaker 0: Lots of people, anime fans who live near Baltimore have never heard of Otacon.

499
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,226
Speaker 0: Lots of them.

500
00:27:31,088 --> 00:27:40,149
Speaker 0: So, uh, you know, there's going to be this BCC expansion next year and Otacon's cap can go up and up and up as they get more streamlined and everything and Otacon gets better and better and better.

501
00:27:40,189 --> 00:27:43,136
Speaker 0: But what can Otacon do to get more people?

502
00:27:43,978 --> 00:27:44,680
Speaker 0: Advertise.

503
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,666
Speaker 0: What costs a shit ton of money?

504
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:47,569
Speaker 0: Advertising.

505
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,198
Speaker 0: What's the best way to get a bunch of free press?

506
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:52,782
Speaker 0: Have a contest.

507
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,370
Speaker 1: Well, contests are a good way.

508
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,130
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, there's plenty of other ways to get some free press out there, but yeah.

509
00:27:59,330 --> 00:27:59,611
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

510
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:00,997
Speaker 0: So Otacon is doing a lot of that.

511
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:10,943
Speaker 1: But the big problem with Otacon advertising is they don't want to spend any resources on it because that's resources that won't make the convention better, you know, and except for getting more people to show up.

512
00:28:11,104 --> 00:28:18,498
Speaker 1: And if you advertise, you know, in a good way, too many people might show up and they're not, I don't think they're ready for too many more people to show up.

513
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:19,162
Speaker 0: I mean, not yet.

514
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:25,808
Speaker 1: I think with a real ad campaign, like with the ads, like posters or on television, they would get thousands of extra.

515
00:28:25,848 --> 00:28:28,098
Speaker 1: And I think they can only handle a few thousand extra.

516
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:33,857
Speaker 0: A little bird tells me that there may be some Baltimore targeted advertisements.

517
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,886
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say it's okay.

518
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:36,267
Speaker 0: Yes.

519
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:43,311
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say exactly the way, cause I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't get the, you can talk about this on the show.

520
00:28:43,411 --> 00:28:44,635
Speaker 0: It was just in a conversation.

521
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:46,942
Speaker 0: But, um, I feel like that.

522
00:28:47,023 --> 00:28:50,032
Speaker 0: the strategy here is tap Baltimore this year.

523
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:55,850
Speaker 0: And then next year when there is this expansion on the BCC go all out further.

524
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:04,785
Speaker 0: Cause I think the cab can go way up, but you know, that's all speculation on my part, but this caught the Oticon 2008 web comics challenge.

525
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:07,515
Speaker 0: You can read the rules and the deadline is pretty quick.

526
00:29:07,896 --> 00:29:17,330
Speaker 0: Basically any web comic published between now and July 11th, featuring a storyline specifically about Oticon is eligible to win some shit.

527
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:18,254
Speaker 1: All right.

528
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:18,736
Speaker 1: What do you win?

529
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,165
Speaker 0: I'm not even going to go into that.

530
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:21,050
Speaker 0: Cause I want to get past this.

531
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,713
Speaker 0: I'm real hungry.

532
00:29:21,753 --> 00:29:22,436
Speaker 0: I'm real tired.

533
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:24,043
Speaker 0: And you can read all the details.

534
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:27,439
Speaker 1: What if I just draw like stick figures real quick and slap them up on the website?

535
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,585
Speaker 1: Can that count possibly?

536
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:29,650
Speaker 0: Well, you'll be eligible.

537
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:30,534
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

538
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:33,927
Speaker 0: I mean, we've had contests and you might be eligible.

539
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:34,570
Speaker 0: Does mean you're going to win.

540
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,018
Speaker 1: Oh, is it random or is it best one?

541
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:43,501
Speaker 0: Uh, well the big rule, all decisions of Oticon staff regarding eligibility as well as prize awards are final.

542
00:29:43,903 --> 00:29:45,450
Speaker 0: And it looks like they can just decide.

543
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:47,341
Speaker 0: There's a whole bunch of rules here.

544
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:48,005
Speaker 0: You get all the rights.

545
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:49,814
Speaker 1: They're just going to pick whichever one they like pretty much.

546
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:50,638
Speaker 1: So it's better to be good.

547
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:57,450
Speaker 0: But anyway, the other news that I really want to talk about, and this is another thing a little bird told me it hasn't been announced yet.

548
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:03,343
Speaker 0: this week, Oticon is going to announce the other musical acts.

549
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:04,326
Speaker 0: Oh no.

550
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:07,895
Speaker 0: Now they've already got freaking jam projects.

551
00:30:08,858 --> 00:30:11,285
Speaker 0: So who the hell are they going to announce?

552
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:17,327
Speaker 1: Well, it could be a lesser act because in the past, you know, they've had a big one and then a few, you know, side ones.

553
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:17,669
Speaker 1: Yes.

554
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:26,058
Speaker 0: But at the same time, all indications are that this Oticon is going a couple of steps above and beyond every other Oticon in terms of programming.

555
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:30,092
Speaker 1: That could be true, but I have, you know, sort of, I'm done.

556
00:30:30,373 --> 00:30:44,450
Speaker 0: I've let, I've exhaled as far as, you know, waiting for some sort of like a Yumi or it's going to be a Yumi Hamasaki and Megumi Haji Barra and two mix and mine, Yoko Kano.

557
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:47,800
Speaker 1: And I don't know, the year before we got there.

558
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,944
Speaker 0: Yes, I could cry.

559
00:30:48,964 --> 00:30:50,971
Speaker 0: I listened to that MP3 kind of often.

560
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:51,493
Speaker 1: Yeah.

561
00:30:51,974 --> 00:31:01,430
Speaker 0: But regardless, this Oticon, just in terms of already what has been announced so far, the raw programming panels, musical acts that have been announced thus far guests.

562
00:31:02,192 --> 00:31:05,688
Speaker 0: I think this is going to be the best Oticon programming wise of any Oticon ever.

563
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:10,816
Speaker 1: I hope that I just hope they keep the dealer's room with the same layout where they can use that extra space under the stairs.

564
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:13,267
Speaker 1: And that one lobby for the exit of the dealer's room.

565
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:18,208
Speaker 0: Plus I'm looking forward because the only badge we don't have at Oticon now is staff.

566
00:31:18,408 --> 00:31:21,247
Speaker 1: We're going to be, the badge you don't want because then someone could tell you what to do.

567
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:21,348
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,298
Speaker 0: Unless you're a Kotsukon at Kineticon.

569
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:29,779
Speaker 1: So we're going to have press, regular, artists alley, panelists.

570
00:31:29,979 --> 00:31:30,301
Speaker 0: Yes.

571
00:31:30,582 --> 00:31:31,645
Speaker 1: And we don't have guests either.

572
00:31:31,786 --> 00:31:33,010
Speaker 0: We don't have guests or staff.

573
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:33,873
Speaker 1: That's all right.

574
00:31:33,954 --> 00:31:36,968
Speaker 0: But we've got guests and staff at Kotsukon and Kineticon.

575
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:39,236
Speaker 0: So I think all around we've got everything.

576
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,764
Speaker 0: We don't have con chair.

577
00:31:42,126 --> 00:31:44,112
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm willing to ever deal with that.

578
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:45,376
Speaker 1: How about no.

579
00:31:45,396 --> 00:31:48,746
Speaker 1: I don't have time for this.

580
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,030
Speaker 1: How much does that time for that shit?

581
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,945
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

582
00:31:58,226 --> 00:32:01,218
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is going to be basically Satoshi Kon.

583
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:04,952
Speaker 0: The really cool thing is that he kind of he brought this camera with him on stage.

584
00:32:04,972 --> 00:32:07,080
Speaker 1: But it was a Nikon DSLR.

585
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,345
Speaker 0: We know because he told us.

586
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:11,859
Speaker 1: Well, I could tell just looking at it was a Nikon digital SLR.

587
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,464
Speaker 1: I didn't know if it was like the D. I guess they have like the 80 and the D. I don't forget there's a bunch of different numbers.

588
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,790
Speaker 1: Bigger numbers means fancier.

589
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,325
Speaker 1: And he was like, as the Nikon, the pride of Japan.

590
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:24,600
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, I was not aware that the Nikon was the pride of Japan.

591
00:32:25,221 --> 00:32:28,961
Speaker 0: But one thing he did a bunch of times while he was talking is he would just take a picture of the crowd.

592
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:32,493
Speaker 1: Usually that's the kind of thing that'd be sort of annoying and weird.

593
00:32:33,135 --> 00:32:35,946
Speaker 1: But he sort of did it in a way that wasn't weird.

594
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:36,427
Speaker 1: He did it.

595
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,158
Speaker 0: And then he made a really interesting point with it.

596
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,133
Speaker 0: And then he kind of used it to kind of pull the thread together.

597
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,022
Speaker 0: Then at the end, he's like, now, before you all go.

598
00:32:44,042 --> 00:32:46,390
Speaker 0: And then he took like one final picture.

599
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,898
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is that picture.

600
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:53,792
Speaker 0: Now, we were there with a bunch like Emily's there and a bunch of people.

601
00:32:54,254 --> 00:33:04,744
Speaker 0: But the important thing is Scott has the most demure, like debutante, like he's like he's so enamored with Satoshi Khan and he wants to ask him out.

602
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:07,992
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, no, because Satoshi Senpai.

603
00:33:08,032 --> 00:33:11,722
Speaker 1: I don't know you.

604
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:12,927
Speaker 0: You did the picture.

605
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:16,040
Speaker 0: The way you look in this picture is so demure and hilarious.

606
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,183
Speaker 1: I don't know.

607
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:22,847
Speaker 1: I remember at the time I was just sort of like sitting there resting my head on my hands, just sort of tired.

608
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:23,289
Speaker 0: Yes.

609
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,062
Speaker 0: Well, in this picture, you can come look at it when we're done recording.

610
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:28,953
Speaker 1: I don't seem to look good in any picture, really.

611
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:29,395
Speaker 0: It's hard.

612
00:33:29,415 --> 00:33:32,569
Speaker 0: The thing is pictures of me from straight on front.

613
00:33:32,589 --> 00:33:35,382
Speaker 0: I always look kind of weird because I have these gigantic smile all the time.

614
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,333
Speaker 0: But from the side, I look a lot more normal.

615
00:33:37,514 --> 00:33:40,571
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, you know, like you just look at me, you know, walking around.

616
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:41,073
Speaker 1: I'm all right.

617
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:45,513
Speaker 1: But if you take a picture of me, you'll see that like one half of my chin is bigger than the other half.

618
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:51,472
Speaker 1: And my like a giant, you know, my mouth is sort of uneven if I open it and whatever.

619
00:33:51,492 --> 00:33:53,458
Speaker 0: You're so worried.

620
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,585
Speaker 0: But you're very demure in this picture.

621
00:33:55,646 --> 00:33:56,047
Speaker 1: Whatever.

622
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:56,689
Speaker 1: All right.

623
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:57,834
Speaker 1: So check this out.

624
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:03,656
Speaker 1: This actually I didn't realize till just now, reading the text under the video here, the what do they call it?

625
00:34:03,676 --> 00:34:08,373
Speaker 1: The subtext or caption the caption that this is actually a really old thing.

626
00:34:08,393 --> 00:34:11,348
Speaker 1: It's just it didn't get posted until the Internet until a few weeks ago.

627
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:15,531
Speaker 1: And then, you know, since we're doing less episodes, it didn't make it till thing of the day until today.

628
00:34:16,034 --> 00:34:19,047
Speaker 1: Actually, I might have done this thing today and screwed up if I did tell me about.

629
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,833
Speaker 1: I think I did anyway.

630
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,283
Speaker 1: So there's this performance artist in Japan.

631
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:25,350
Speaker 1: It's a lady named Sako Kojima.

632
00:34:25,491 --> 00:34:25,732
Speaker 1: Right.

633
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:34,699
Speaker 1: And I guess a long time ago, at least a year ago, she did this performance art in the window of a store where she became a hamster.

634
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,047
Speaker 0: And you might be thinking, wait, wait, what?

635
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:41,900
Speaker 0: Like metaphorically, does she dress up as a hamster?

636
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,190
Speaker 1: No, literally her her installation slash performance.

637
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:51,371
Speaker 1: Why I became a hamster included treats, housing, chew toys and food all scaled to her size.

638
00:34:51,632 --> 00:34:59,673
Speaker 1: She basically spent multiple days living as a hamster, acting as a hamster in, you know, in a store window.

639
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:03,042
Speaker 1: And she's at once one half.

640
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:04,910
Speaker 1: It's like, wow, that's really cute.

641
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:06,900
Speaker 1: And the other half is like, wow, she's really crazy.

642
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,462
Speaker 1: Remember how I talked about the is the smartest and insane scale is the perfect metaphor for Japan.

643
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,273
Speaker 0: I don't know what to say other than that.

644
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:18,417
Speaker 0: It's really, really cute.

645
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:22,108
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it is really, really crazy.

646
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,460
Speaker 1: But I guess there is some kind of art to it in a way.

647
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,908
Speaker 1: You know, it's up to you whether you like it.

648
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,656
Speaker 0: It's surprisingly well done.

649
00:35:29,716 --> 00:35:31,927
Speaker 0: Like, it's very well put together, this thing.

650
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:32,551
Speaker 1: Yeah.

651
00:35:32,571 --> 00:35:34,239
Speaker 1: She definitely put a lot of thought into this.

652
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,501
Speaker 0: So I hate we weren't going to do like a cop out or like a special now that we've got the schedule short.

653
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:43,212
Speaker 0: But Scott and I are both kind of going out of town.

654
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:45,522
Speaker 0: I'm Scott's going to see his grandma in Florida.

655
00:35:45,582 --> 00:35:49,040
Speaker 0: And Emily and I are going to the beach in Wildwood with Scott Johnson and Laura.

656
00:35:49,682 --> 00:35:53,111
Speaker 1: So as a result, I always say Laura, it's Laura.

657
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:59,668
Speaker 0: Well, it's not Laura or Lara or Lira or Lara, Laura, as in Laura, as in battle, Laura.

658
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:02,937
Speaker 1: The thing is, Laura is no you in it.

659
00:36:03,017 --> 00:36:04,120
Speaker 1: It's a different name.

660
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,544
Speaker 0: I'm totally indifferent.

661
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:07,811
Speaker 0: I'm just saying anyway.

662
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:14,050
Speaker 0: So it's not like I'm trying to kill some time between that other Laura that we knew.

663
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,097
Speaker 1: Are you not able to say this?

664
00:36:16,157 --> 00:36:17,040
Speaker 1: Is it you have a problem?

665
00:36:17,321 --> 00:36:17,923
Speaker 0: Michigan accent.

666
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:20,512
Speaker 0: What do you want from Laura?

667
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,258
Speaker 0: Here's the thing in the Midwest.

668
00:36:22,498 --> 00:36:26,491
Speaker 0: The way we pronounce a is pretty much at all times.

669
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:32,168
Speaker 0: The only people who pronounce it worse than that are the people in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

670
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:34,314
Speaker 0: Scranton.

671
00:36:34,976 --> 00:36:38,408
Speaker 0: No offense to anyone in Scranton, but I've never had a good time when I've been there.

672
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,718
Speaker 1: I avoid that place quite much.

673
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:44,791
Speaker 0: The thing is, as far as I can tell, it's just an interchange between 81 and 84.

674
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:48,162
Speaker 0: My dad is to go there for work sometimes.

675
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:49,466
Speaker 1: Anyway.

676
00:36:49,767 --> 00:36:50,069
Speaker 0: Anyway.

677
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:54,745
Speaker 0: So as a result, instead of totally copping out, luckily we kind of went long unintentionally in the first half.

678
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:58,659
Speaker 0: So we're not going to review Princess Tutu.

679
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:58,940
Speaker 0: We're not.

680
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,204
Speaker 1: I've only seen one disc.

681
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:06,951
Speaker 0: A full review of it, though in the future at some point, we will fully review this show because it's a show that's worth reviewing.

682
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:09,261
Speaker 0: But what we're going to do is preview it.

683
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:13,317
Speaker 0: Now remember, the kind of the way we do this is that a preview is either.

684
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:19,242
Speaker 0: we haven't seen all the show, though in this case I have seen the entire show, but we're really not going to try to spoil anything.

685
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:20,025
Speaker 0: We're mostly going to.

686
00:37:20,466 --> 00:37:25,765
Speaker 0: a preview is kind of like if it is worth it for you to watch a show is what we do.

687
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:26,872
Speaker 0: You know, this is what the show is about.

688
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:27,940
Speaker 0: This is our impressions of it.

689
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:28,802
Speaker 0: Yada, yada, yada.

690
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:31,129
Speaker 0: If you're this kind of person, you'll probably like it.

691
00:37:32,152 --> 00:37:32,333
Speaker 1: Yep.

692
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:43,029
Speaker 0: So Princess Tutu is a show that the way most people who like it would explain it is, yeah, I totally would have never thought to watch a show called Princess Tutu.

693
00:37:43,229 --> 00:37:43,491
Speaker 0: Yeah.

694
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:46,764
Speaker 1: I mean, you look at it like, OK, it's called Princess Tutu.

695
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:51,060
Speaker 1: And it's like, even though I should have learned my lesson from liking Fancy Lala.

696
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,621
Speaker 0: Yes.

697
00:37:51,841 --> 00:37:58,359
Speaker 0: Let's see shows that by the name, you don't think you'll like Fancy Lala, Princess Tutu.

698
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:58,961
Speaker 1: Right.

699
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:01,549
Speaker 1: But I like Fancy Lala, at least what I saw.

700
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:07,589
Speaker 1: So but yet Fancy Lala Princess Tutu comes along and I'm like, there's no way I can like Princess Tutu.

701
00:38:07,629 --> 00:38:10,320
Speaker 1: But Princess Tutu is all right.

702
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:31,385
Speaker 1: Now, now here's I got to say, all right, if you don't want any spoilers whatsoever, because it's really hard to talk about the show, because there's pretty much something that happens in pretty much every episode, that because of my experience watching the first episode and being stupid, it would have been a spoiler for me if you would have said the most basic, obvious thing about the show.

703
00:38:31,445 --> 00:38:43,194
Speaker 1: So I feel like if you have already decided you're going to give it a go, you know, shouldn't listen to this episode anymore, because then you won't have any chance of having this really weird experience I had in the first episode.

704
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:43,435
Speaker 0: Yes.

705
00:38:43,636 --> 00:38:53,740
Speaker 0: So if you have already decided that you are going to watch Princess Tutu based solely on the fact that we have said it's worth watching, stop right now and go watch the first episode of Princess Tutu or buy it or rent

706
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:58,504
Speaker 1: as soon as you watch the first episode, then you can come back and listen to the rest of this without any worries.

707
00:38:58,524 --> 00:39:03,448
Speaker 0: We're not we're not really going to spoil anything, but you'll get a better experience if you don't know anything going into it.

708
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:06,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd say don't even look at anything online.

709
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:07,244
Speaker 0: Yeah.

710
00:39:07,384 --> 00:39:08,991
Speaker 0: Avoid even looking at the box.

711
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:10,215
Speaker 1: Just put the DVD in and go.

712
00:39:10,236 --> 00:39:14,471
Speaker 1: And now let me explain to you why this is, you see, Princess Tutu, right?

713
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:17,784
Speaker 1: If you didn't realize it, because I apparently I sort of.

714
00:39:18,227 --> 00:39:23,307
Speaker 1: it's one of those things where it's like, you know it or you feel like you should know it or it's obvious, but you don't know it.

715
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:30,787
Speaker 1: It's a magical girl show and a magical girl show has magical girls transforming.

716
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:31,408
Speaker 1: Right.

717
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:32,972
Speaker 1: Which is sort of obvious.

718
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:40,637
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is I was watching the first episode and you have this girl transforming from a duck to a girl.

719
00:39:40,657 --> 00:39:41,240
Speaker 1: Right.

720
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,485
Speaker 1: So there was the transformation.

721
00:39:43,606 --> 00:39:43,906
Speaker 1: I didn't.

722
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:52,730
Speaker 1: another transformation, you know, from average girl to Princess Tutu was not expected.

723
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,844
Speaker 1: So in the first episode, when it happened, to be honest, it blew me away.

724
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,248
Speaker 1: I was like, OMG.

725
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:09,838
Speaker 1: So I feel like if you know what I told you, if someone had told me, Scott, remember, it's a magical girl show, then that wouldn't have blown me away.

726
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:17,788
Speaker 1: So I feel like you can sort of spoil that cool experience of being blown away in the first episode by not fully grokking the magical girlness.

727
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:29,206
Speaker 0: But there's a few not really misconceptions, but a lot of people I found and I was included until I actually sat down and watched this show don't know anything about it.

728
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:33,442
Speaker 0: Other than that, a lot of older or more hardcore anime fans will mention it.

729
00:40:33,944 --> 00:40:40,709
Speaker 0: And it's usually mentioned in conversations that also involve like Utena and Rose of Versailles and those sorts of shows.

730
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:47,733
Speaker 0: So a lot of people who just hear the name think like they expect a certain aesthetic and a certain kind of show.

731
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:59,613
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of people who actually sit down and watch the show are very, very surprised to see a recent, modern, crisply animated, not at all stylistically like those shows show.

732
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:00,737
Speaker 1: No, not really.

733
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:04,167
Speaker 1: It's pretty much a standardly, moderately animated.

734
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:10,352
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is a lot of the people I talked to who clearly just have heard that, oh, Princess Tutu, I've heard that's good.

735
00:41:10,874 --> 00:41:13,645
Speaker 0: They think if you ask him, what do you think that is?

736
00:41:13,685 --> 00:41:16,093
Speaker 0: They think it's this old, old, old show.

737
00:41:16,113 --> 00:41:20,753
Speaker 0: I've run into a lot of people who think this because it's not a show that's out there.

738
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,060
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't know about it.

739
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:29,672
Speaker 0: So not many people have actually seen what the show looks like, which is kind of surprising, except for the fact that there's so much anime out there.

740
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:30,477
Speaker 0: It's real easy to see.

741
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:38,650
Speaker 1: I mean, because it is easy to get confused because there are a lot of older anime that are, you know, could be confused like Princess Knight.

742
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:44,769
Speaker 0: So plus, I mean, people do talk about it and they tend to bring up shows like Utena in the same breath.

743
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:45,150
Speaker 1: Yep.

744
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:49,324
Speaker 0: But Princess Tutu is the story of a young duck.

745
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:49,785
Speaker 1: Quack.

746
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:51,250
Speaker 0: Named Ahiru.

747
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,396
Speaker 1: Which Ahiru is the Japanese word for duck.

748
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:53,917
Speaker 0: Yes.

749
00:41:54,258 --> 00:41:55,543
Speaker 1: So it's a duck named Duck.

750
00:41:55,623 --> 00:41:56,909
Speaker 0: Now, this is not a metaphor.

751
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,074
Speaker 0: She's literally a duck.

752
00:41:58,195 --> 00:41:58,677
Speaker 1: Literally.

753
00:41:58,717 --> 00:42:02,329
Speaker 1: We're talking like it's in the water and it goes quack, quack, quack.

754
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:10,760
Speaker 0: I really like how the beginning of the show opens because it's pretty much, it shows a prince dancing ballet, you know, Swan Lake sort of thing.

755
00:42:11,221 --> 00:42:11,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

756
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:14,652
Speaker 1: They, they, I mean, Tchaikovsky, he's my man.

757
00:42:14,672 --> 00:42:15,795
Speaker 1: I love his action.

758
00:42:15,855 --> 00:42:16,557
Speaker 1: Right.

759
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:22,177
Speaker 1: And he's got the mad ballets going on, but really like they put him on a little too much.

760
00:42:22,237 --> 00:42:24,205
Speaker 1: It feels like there is enough balance.

761
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:26,433
Speaker 0: The show called Princess Tutu about ballet.

762
00:42:26,514 --> 00:42:28,944
Speaker 0: every episode is a metaphor for a different ballet.

763
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,096
Speaker 1: I meant the Tchaikovsky is in there a little too much.

764
00:42:31,136 --> 00:42:33,428
Speaker 1: You got to put in some other ballets in there a little bit more.

765
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:34,192
Speaker 1: Balance it out.

766
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:41,235
Speaker 0: I think part of it is that Swan Lake, considering that the main character is a duck girl is not a Swan.

767
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:41,937
Speaker 0: Yes.

768
00:42:42,218 --> 00:42:44,066
Speaker 0: But consider where the show might be going.

769
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,235
Speaker 1: It's actually become a Swan.

770
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:47,581
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say anything at all.

771
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:53,122
Speaker 0: This show, I'm not going to spoil, but basically it's like it starts out and it's really cool.

772
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:58,205
Speaker 0: And there's this prince and he's dancing here, this voiceover of a girl, like I've always loved the prince, that sort of thing.

773
00:42:58,225 --> 00:43:05,750
Speaker 0: And then, but I'm a duck and it's a duck watching this dancing and the duck loves the prince, but the duck's a duck.

774
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:07,717
Speaker 1: Literally like quack.

775
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:08,901
Speaker 1: I'm in the water.

776
00:43:08,982 --> 00:43:11,049
Speaker 1: I have webbed feet and little wing-a-lings.

777
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,862
Speaker 0: But then the duck wakes up as a girl and there's some flashbacks.

778
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:26,917
Speaker 0: And it basically for the first several minutes of this show, the girl wakes up and you're kind of, she's not sure and neither are you if she was always a girl or always a duck.

779
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:31,497
Speaker 0: Is it a duck who dreamed it was a girl, a girl who dreamed it was a duck?

780
00:43:31,557 --> 00:43:43,719
Speaker 0: Is it a girl who and it's pretty explicitly, you figure it out after a while and they kind of explicitly say, no, it's a duck turns into a girl, but it's really left open and that kind of matters later.

781
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,214
Speaker 0: But Laura, who lent us the two sets of this show?

782
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:53,421
Speaker 0: because she really likes it and I really like it too.

783
00:43:54,104 --> 00:44:17,162
Speaker 0: The way she described it, and this is probably the best way to describe the show to someone is that it is a show that as long as you are comfortable and expect, comfortable with and expecting the fact that the characters will fight with each other and express their feelings almost entirely through ballet and independent of that, the show is about a bunch of people at a ballet school.

784
00:44:17,443 --> 00:44:24,170
Speaker 1: That is one thing that it has in common with a lot of other anime like Gutena is that it sort of has the inexplicable school, right?

785
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,984
Speaker 1: It's like there are a bunch of people in a school somewhere.

786
00:44:28,004 --> 00:44:29,510
Speaker 1: There's no other world.

787
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,574
Speaker 1: They don't have parents.

788
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,959
Speaker 1: They don't have siblings.

789
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:34,630
Speaker 1: It's just a bunch of kids in a school inexplicably.

790
00:44:35,313 --> 00:44:37,622
Speaker 1: And this may be a teacher or something, but that's it.

791
00:44:37,763 --> 00:44:38,826
Speaker 1: And it's like, huh?

792
00:44:39,108 --> 00:44:44,104
Speaker 0: But at the same time, this show, unlike other shows, addresses that.

793
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:47,280
Speaker 1: And there's a point at which someone's really addressed it in the first disc.

794
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:51,600
Speaker 0: No, but as the show goes on, it gets to the point where what's outside the gates, fuck if I know.

795
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,086
Speaker 1: I mean, they walk around town.

796
00:44:53,146 --> 00:44:57,286
Speaker 1: sometimes they interact with the town a little bit, but not much.

797
00:44:57,346 --> 00:44:58,512
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just a place.

798
00:44:58,573 --> 00:45:04,683
Speaker 0: It's like, well, if they leave the school, they're in the town and antennas like that, where you see a few, like a few times someone's outside of the school.

799
00:45:04,723 --> 00:45:04,884
Speaker 1: Yeah.

800
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:08,543
Speaker 1: Like they go out, they like say, oh, and she gets an apartment in town at one point, right?

801
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:14,132
Speaker 1: Or walk about has an apartment in town and she, some people go, there's a couple scenes where someone goes to town shopping to buy something.

802
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:18,026
Speaker 0: Or there's a scene where some people go to a, an amusement park together.

803
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:18,126
Speaker 1: Yeah.

804
00:45:18,567 --> 00:45:19,550
Speaker 1: Yeah.

805
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:20,612
Speaker 1: To go get some Curry.

806
00:45:20,753 --> 00:45:21,134
Speaker 1: Yeah.

807
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:22,778
Speaker 0: Wow.

808
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:29,322
Speaker 0: We just totally obliquely referenced like everything that's good about that show or bad about that show or all anyway.

809
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:29,604
Speaker 1: Yeah.

810
00:45:29,624 --> 00:45:31,533
Speaker 1: But the town, you know, it's not really there.

811
00:45:31,573 --> 00:45:35,712
Speaker 0: It's sort of like the show kind of like, all right, we're in this walled garden, let's just go.

812
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:46,367
Speaker 0: But then, you know, people from the outside, like a ballet troop will come at one point and the people who come, things kind of happened to them as a result of them being there.

813
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:54,673
Speaker 0: And it's from that point forward, the fact that the school is inexplicable suddenly becomes very relevant.

814
00:45:55,074 --> 00:45:55,315
Speaker 1: Yeah.

815
00:45:55,355 --> 00:46:02,386
Speaker 1: I've always wanted to show like, you know, sort of take that idea because so many other shows take that inexplicable school mechanic for granted.

816
00:46:02,406 --> 00:46:07,089
Speaker 1: They just have the inexplicable school there the whole time so that their story can take place within it.

817
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:17,042
Speaker 1: Yet, if a show actually took the inexplicable school and then said, why is this school so here and such and weird, then that would be totally cool.

818
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:19,111
Speaker 1: So if this show does that, that sounds good to me.

819
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:19,593
Speaker 1: Yes.

820
00:46:19,673 --> 00:46:23,427
Speaker 0: The other thing that's pretty cool is that the show takes nothing for granted.

821
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:30,691
Speaker 0: And as you go on, everything is explained or relevant and there's nothing's really taken for granted.

822
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:32,598
Speaker 0: And a lot of it's pretty interesting.

823
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:41,671
Speaker 1: The first episode is a little bit, you know, weird, but the second episode pretty much smooths things right over and puts you into the monster, the weak groove.

824
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:49,508
Speaker 1: And then each episode sort of reveals a little bit more, but the first episode is weird, but the second episode, everything is straightened out and you're like, oh, I get it.

825
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:49,850
Speaker 1: All right.

826
00:46:49,971 --> 00:46:54,122
Speaker 1: It's not like a tenor where it's all weird.

827
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:59,220
Speaker 0: It's pretty obvious that the show will be like plot monster of the day ish for a while.

828
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,791
Speaker 0: And then back to like straight out plot until the end.

829
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:04,302
Speaker 0: And it's in two, like it's two separate shows.

830
00:47:04,342 --> 00:47:10,706
Speaker 0: Basically the first half of the show, the first 12 or 13 or whatever episodes goes, stops the show ends.

831
00:47:11,007 --> 00:47:12,070
Speaker 0: Plot is resolved.

832
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:14,035
Speaker 0: Next episode, we continue.

833
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,602
Speaker 0: And the show happens again.

834
00:47:16,662 --> 00:47:22,300
Speaker 1: The thing is in like episode two or three, they tell you like, what's going to happen.

835
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,045
Speaker 1: They're like, this is a trade.

836
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:27,978
Speaker 1: They pretty much say in plain Japanese, this is a tragedy.

837
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:28,680
Speaker 1: Hello.

838
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:31,848
Speaker 1: Like they, and she says, oh, it's a tragedy.

839
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:32,772
Speaker 1: Okay.

840
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:34,899
Speaker 1: Like that's what the character says.

841
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:36,646
Speaker 1: So it's like, huh?

842
00:47:37,007 --> 00:47:40,540
Speaker 1: Is it actually going to be, I don't know, but they just said it was going to be.

843
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:41,143
Speaker 0: Yeah.

844
00:47:41,163 --> 00:47:51,429
Speaker 0: But one other thing I want to say, it's not really a spoiler, but this show breaks another trope of magical girl shows where pretty much right away, people are like, well, you're princess too, too.

845
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:52,071
Speaker 0: Duh.

846
00:47:52,432 --> 00:47:52,653
Speaker 1: Yeah.

847
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:55,000
Speaker 1: It's not like sailor moon or Superman.

848
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,089
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, you fucking disappear.

849
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:59,700
Speaker 0: Francis Tucci, who looks a lot like you appears immediately.

850
00:47:59,720 --> 00:47:59,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:02,332
Speaker 1: It's like an episode, uh, four or five, right?

852
00:48:02,352 --> 00:48:05,967
Speaker 1: There's a scene where, you know, the duck in human form.

853
00:48:06,048 --> 00:48:07,595
Speaker 1: And that's one thing I like about the show.

854
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,643
Speaker 1: is that most magical girls, like sailor moon, right?

855
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:12,495
Speaker 1: She's either sailor moon or what's her name?

856
00:48:13,258 --> 00:48:13,659
Speaker 1: What's her name?

857
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,145
Speaker 1: Which is not sailor moon.

858
00:48:15,265 --> 00:48:18,320
Speaker 0: Well, depending on if you watch the dub, it's Serena or Sagi.

859
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:19,985
Speaker 0: Her full name is skin.

860
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:23,342
Speaker 1: Oh, Sagi, whatever the girl, when she's not sailor moon, that's it here.

861
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:24,365
Speaker 1: We've got duck.

862
00:48:24,445 --> 00:48:27,596
Speaker 1: The animal quack quack turns into girl named duck.

863
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:31,631
Speaker 0: Who's just a girl whose friends are complete jerks to her.

864
00:48:31,751 --> 00:48:32,414
Speaker 1: I love that.

865
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,320
Speaker 1: And then she transfers into princess too, too.

866
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:35,143
Speaker 1: It's fucking awesome.

867
00:48:35,184 --> 00:48:35,465
Speaker 1: Right?

868
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:37,573
Speaker 1: So it's kind of weird.

869
00:48:37,613 --> 00:48:40,624
Speaker 1: Like, you know, there's a girl who's the cool girl, Roo.

870
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:41,287
Speaker 1: All right.

871
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:43,415
Speaker 0: And Roo is my favorite character.

872
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:43,937
Speaker 1: I think so.

873
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:47,190
Speaker 1: Cause all the other characters are annoying or evil or stupid in some way.

874
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,760
Speaker 0: She's cool, except for her cool and smart.

875
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,005
Speaker 1: She's cool and smart and not stupid or annoying.

876
00:48:52,406 --> 00:48:54,691
Speaker 1: Uh, but so Roo's hanging with duck, right?

877
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:59,846
Speaker 1: In monster of the week, basically.

878
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:04,426
Speaker 1: And when the monster of the week shows up, duck disappears and princess who shows up.

879
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:15,377
Speaker 1: And then after they deal with the monster of the week, Roo is like, uh, you disappeared and ducks like, and duck is very annoying.

880
00:49:15,397 --> 00:49:18,946
Speaker 0: That was actually a pretty apt, uh, expression of how she laughs.

881
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:21,293
Speaker 1: Yeah.

882
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:21,754
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:22,095
Speaker 1: Duck.

884
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:22,757
Speaker 1: That's the thing.

885
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:31,790
Speaker 1: Even the main character duck is annoying, except actually it's weird when she's in the form of the animal, the duck, when she's in princess tutu form kicks all ass.

886
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:39,116
Speaker 1: But when she's in, you know, most of the time she's in normal girl, when she's by herself, it's kind of like with Nana.

887
00:49:39,336 --> 00:49:45,540
Speaker 0: when she's by herself, thinking in her head, she's cool, collected and smart about everything, or at least smart enough.

888
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,167
Speaker 0: And it's like kind of insightful and good.

889
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:47,970
Speaker 0: And she's okay.

890
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,343
Speaker 0: She's a character when she's talking to other people.

891
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:55,553
Speaker 0: It's like, just shut up.

892
00:49:55,694 --> 00:49:56,335
Speaker 0: You're annoying.

893
00:49:56,356 --> 00:49:58,883
Speaker 0: I just picture, shut up, shut up, shut up.

894
00:49:59,043 --> 00:50:02,234
Speaker 1: It's like every character shutting up.

895
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:05,343
Speaker 1: The only character is that I don't want to just shut up.

896
00:50:05,684 --> 00:50:06,005
Speaker 0: Right.

897
00:50:06,406 --> 00:50:11,500
Speaker 1: Are, uh, the weird Dusseldorf guy, Drosselmeyer, Drosselmeyer.

898
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:11,740
Speaker 0: Okay.

899
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,487
Speaker 0: I got to say something there.

900
00:50:13,507 --> 00:50:17,502
Speaker 0: The, the, I catch in the second season that you have is different.

901
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:20,833
Speaker 0: Not only is it different, but it goes too far.

902
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:22,137
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

903
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:25,713
Speaker 0: You know, you don't, you just, I catch you'll like, it'll have like, it'll move.

904
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:30,173
Speaker 1: because the, I catch in the first season is him spinning around and then taking like a little bow.

905
00:50:30,314 --> 00:50:30,595
Speaker 0: Yes.

906
00:50:30,796 --> 00:50:34,912
Speaker 0: But notice how it's like, there's the first action and then like the second action that ends it.

907
00:50:34,932 --> 00:50:37,281
Speaker 0: It's like action action that ends it.

908
00:50:37,321 --> 00:50:38,606
Speaker 0: And a lot of eye catches are like that.

909
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:43,064
Speaker 0: The second season I catch it's like, it has too many actions.

910
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:46,660
Speaker 0: And then when you think, all right, that was too many actions, but now it's done.

911
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,565
Speaker 0: There's one more action.

912
00:50:48,585 --> 00:50:51,674
Speaker 1: Does he just moon you close?

913
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:58,260
Speaker 0: Basically it's like this cabinet spins around and then the door opens and you see him in there and you're like, okay, that was the action.

914
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:01,769
Speaker 0: But then he like bow, like steps out and you're like, oh, okay.

915
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,149
Speaker 0: And then he, he raises his glass and smiles, this fucked up smile.

916
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:11,180
Speaker 0: And it's totally out of pace and rhythm with the rest of it.

917
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,668
Speaker 0: So it's like, I catch, I can't, whoa.

918
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:16,939
Speaker 0: And it's, and that's the eye catch for the rest of the show.

919
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:18,365
Speaker 1: Ah, that's pretty scary.

920
00:51:18,767 --> 00:51:19,009
Speaker 1: But yeah.

921
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:20,978
Speaker 1: And then there's the, uh, the music box lady.

922
00:51:21,018 --> 00:51:21,561
Speaker 1: She's all right.

923
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:22,524
Speaker 0: Yeah.

924
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:23,427
Speaker 0: Yeah.

925
00:51:23,467 --> 00:51:29,089
Speaker 1: She's basically, it really feels to me like, um, in antenna, you have the shadow girls and she's like the shadow girl.

926
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:33,447
Speaker 1: She shows up right before the monster of the week shows up, says something cryptic.

927
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:34,330
Speaker 1: You listen.

928
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:37,722
Speaker 1: And basically that's a metaphor for what the episode is about.

929
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,570
Speaker 1: And then you fight the monster of the week.

930
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,820
Speaker 1: Well, you dance with the monster of the week.

931
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,161
Speaker 0: Yes.

932
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:49,868
Speaker 0: Once again, people fight through ballet and you might think, nah, no, that is they, they literally you, it is literal.

933
00:51:50,129 --> 00:51:52,577
Speaker 0: They are fighting through ballet.

934
00:51:52,637 --> 00:51:55,769
Speaker 1: Now this is actually one thing that bothers me with the show, right?

935
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:57,696
Speaker 1: The show is about ballet.

936
00:51:57,757 --> 00:51:59,322
Speaker 1: Ballet is a huge part of the show, right?

937
00:51:59,823 --> 00:52:03,814
Speaker 1: I want to see more fully animated dancing.

938
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:10,637
Speaker 1: There's a lot of the dancing is still frame of people in a pose, pan across still frame of them in another pose.

939
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:13,169
Speaker 0: You actually get a lot more of that as the show goes on.

940
00:52:13,189 --> 00:52:28,452
Speaker 1: I want to see, you know, I really feel like when I'm watching them dance, when the princess two, two shows up, I want to see, you know, fully animated entire dances and not just like animate one move, cut, animate a different move, cut, animate a different move on to see like the whole ballet going on.

941
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:32,231
Speaker 1: But I didn't get to see much of that in the first disc, or at least not as much as I wanted to.

942
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:37,255
Speaker 1: And it's a little frustrating watching the dancing scenes that didn't have enough animation going on.

943
00:52:37,315 --> 00:52:37,456
Speaker 0: Yeah.

944
00:52:37,476 --> 00:52:39,524
Speaker 0: But you get a lot more of the animation later.

945
00:52:39,986 --> 00:52:44,162
Speaker 1: And one day later on, it really was like an antenna fight as opposed to say a gun.

946
00:52:44,222 --> 00:52:50,725
Speaker 1: I mean, at least in a Gundam fight, they might use stock animation, but at least it's moving all the time.

947
00:52:50,826 --> 00:53:01,381
Speaker 0: But later on, one really cool thing is there's a point at which there are ballet fights and the Raven, basically the Ravens kind of henchmen or the things that fight on the Ravens behalf.

948
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:02,945
Speaker 1: I know the Ravens coming in.

949
00:53:03,126 --> 00:53:13,092
Speaker 0: Yes, but the Ravens things are basically just people wearing Raven costumes, carrying swords, doing ballet.

950
00:53:13,212 --> 00:53:15,840
Speaker 1: Do they fully animate the dancing to a point?

951
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,385
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

952
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:18,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be cool.

953
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:22,306
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's not cool, but I wanted to see like the whole dance animated.

954
00:53:22,326 --> 00:53:27,387
Speaker 1: Like there was some parts where in the show where they're like, you knew the dances are wicked awesome.

955
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:33,047
Speaker 1: And they seem to really do a good job of getting across the how well the people are dancing.

956
00:53:33,629 --> 00:53:33,869
Speaker 0: Yes.

957
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:40,790
Speaker 0: I really like you really start to respect Fakir and Rue just by seeing them dance in the real world of the show.

958
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:43,960
Speaker 1: But I want to see more full animation.

959
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:45,669
Speaker 1: I guess it would have been too expensive and take it too much.

960
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:49,686
Speaker 1: I mean, animating people doing ballet like an entire dance, not easy.

961
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:55,989
Speaker 1: But at the same time, you know, it's sort of like, well, you sort of needed it kind of anyway.

962
00:53:56,310 --> 00:54:00,466
Speaker 0: But I guess we'll kind of wrap this up because I want to get ready to go to the beach and I'm tired.

963
00:54:01,228 --> 00:54:03,457
Speaker 0: But what I mean, we've said all good.

964
00:54:03,497 --> 00:54:06,186
Speaker 0: The only bad thing really about the show is not really bad.

965
00:54:06,247 --> 00:54:08,555
Speaker 0: It's just that the show is great.

966
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,000
Speaker 0: A great show bar.

967
00:54:10,241 --> 00:54:11,685
Speaker 0: none for younger kids.

968
00:54:11,746 --> 00:54:14,173
Speaker 0: This show is so perfect for a younger kid.

969
00:54:14,555 --> 00:54:15,518
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, totally.

970
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:19,713
Speaker 0: But for it and I and to qualify that I also really like the show.

971
00:54:19,793 --> 00:54:24,087
Speaker 0: But if you're looking for, I guess, the Utena depth, it's not there.

972
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:24,830
Speaker 1: It's not.

973
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:27,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, this isn't like the highest brow.

974
00:54:27,418 --> 00:54:35,654
Speaker 1: This is like if you're a little kid watching this and maybe like a middle school kid and you watch this, then it's like it's like high brow for middle school kids.

975
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,361
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, super awesome for them.

976
00:54:37,462 --> 00:54:37,643
Speaker 1: Right.

977
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:40,278
Speaker 1: Because it's, you know, it's above their above their level a little bit.

978
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,868
Speaker 1: They can feel smart, but also watch a cool show.

979
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:52,746
Speaker 1: But for, you know, people in college or older, you know, normal people, adults watching this, it's sort of like, well, it's a little bit straightforward and obvious.

980
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:56,278
Speaker 0: And yeah, a lot of things you'll think are straightforward.

981
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,435
Speaker 0: But then as you watch the show, you realize you were totally off base.

982
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:08,369
Speaker 0: But at the same time, a lot of the metaphors and a lot of the kind of messages and a lot of the morals and a lot of that sort of thing are very transparent.

983
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:13,971
Speaker 0: And if they're not, they're usually explained fairly explicitly at some point, just in case you didn't get it.

984
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:14,232
Speaker 0: Yeah.

985
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,663
Speaker 1: Pretty much everything is explained explicitly.

986
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:24,129
Speaker 1: And unless you're, you know, spoiler in, you know, at least I don't think you're going to find out any twists and turns.

987
00:55:24,169 --> 00:55:26,982
Speaker 1: And if you when they do happen, they're going to be explained explicitly.

988
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:27,585
Speaker 0: Yes.

989
00:55:27,685 --> 00:55:29,170
Speaker 0: But don't let that discourage you.

990
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:30,937
Speaker 0: The show is worth watching.

991
00:55:31,097 --> 00:55:33,085
Speaker 0: I did enjoy watching the entire show.

992
00:55:33,105 --> 00:55:41,543
Speaker 1: I enjoyed watching the first disc, especially that first episode, because I didn't realize that, you know, she was going to transform into Princess Tutu because I was stupid.

993
00:55:41,563 --> 00:55:43,050
Speaker 1: And that's sort of an obvious thing.

994
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:46,746
Speaker 1: So when she transformed into Princess Tutu the first time, it was totally awesome.

995
00:55:46,766 --> 00:55:53,393
Speaker 1: And it's the first time like, you know, a transformation in anime, I think, had that full effect going on.

996
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:54,276
Speaker 0: And I'll say this.

997
00:55:54,376 --> 00:55:59,430
Speaker 0: If you're worried that the show doesn't go anywhere, the show goes real dark.

998
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:00,172
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

999
00:56:01,054 --> 00:56:04,281
Speaker 0: The show does not go to good places.

1000
00:56:05,344 --> 00:56:06,548
Speaker 0: Bad things happen.

1001
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:18,868
Speaker 0: But the other thing is, I generally I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to see something different because this show is very different in a lot of ways from a lot of the other shows you're going to be seeing nowadays.

1002
00:56:18,888 --> 00:56:20,616
Speaker 0: It kind of stands out.

1003
00:56:20,797 --> 00:56:28,004
Speaker 0: And also, if you're looking for a magical girl show that isn't Sailor Moon, this and Fancy Lala are pretty much where you want to be.

1004
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:29,127
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1005
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:29,850
Speaker 1: Fancy Lala.

1006
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:35,168
Speaker 1: It's another magical girl show, which it had a similar feel of as a show for kids.

1007
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:40,227
Speaker 1: It's not really deep, but there's enough going on here and it's intelligent enough to be worth watching.

1008
00:56:40,267 --> 00:56:43,280
Speaker 1: And it was basically this magical girls that transform.

1009
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:47,194
Speaker 1: But there's this dinosaur plot that is really cool.

1010
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,178
Speaker 1: And it's like I didn't.

1011
00:56:48,218 --> 00:56:53,039
Speaker 1: I never watched enough Fancy Lala to see what the deal was, but I've always wanted to know what the deal was.

1012
00:56:53,481 --> 00:56:57,319
Speaker 0: I'd pretty much say that I think Princess Tutu is a better show than Fancy Lala.

1013
00:56:57,339 --> 00:57:00,875
Speaker 0: So if you're going to choose between the two, I don't know how much Fancy Lala you've seen.

1014
00:57:01,277 --> 00:57:04,650
Speaker 0: I saw the first like eight episodes of that and I saw all of Princess Tutu.

1015
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:08,143
Speaker 1: See, I've only seen like four episodes of Fancy Lala.

1016
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:09,950
Speaker 0: I want to see more Fancy Lala.

1017
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:10,974
Speaker 0: I'll watch it at some point.

1018
00:57:10,994 --> 00:57:12,801
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think we're done.

1019
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,790
Speaker 0: Don't try to get a hold of us.

1020
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,739
Speaker 0: Scott's going to be out of town and I'll be at the beach.

1021
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,612
Speaker 0: We'll see you on Tuesday where we're going to talk about tribes two.

1022
00:57:20,632 --> 00:57:21,856
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

1023
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:22,779
Speaker 0: I want to.

1024
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,508
Speaker 0: I could talk for like two hours about tribes two right now.

1025
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:27,997
Speaker 0: I think I'll end on this.

1026
00:57:28,057 --> 00:57:31,731
Speaker 0: Tyco, God, ending on a non-anime Tyco from Fenny Arcade said it best.

1027
00:57:31,992 --> 00:57:33,398
