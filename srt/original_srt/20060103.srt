1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,937
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 3rd, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:20,137
Speaker 0: tonight We talk about dungeons and dragons with our special guest and dungeon master Alex Let's do this.

3
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:25,096
Speaker 0: So I fell asleep at my desk not once not twice, but three times today.

4
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:26,200
Speaker 1: Is that a record?

5
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:30,104
Speaker 0: It's not a record, but actually I fall asleep I just fairly often.

6
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:35,327
Speaker 0: but it was particularly auspicious because I stayed up all night geeking and that was why I stayed up all night geeking.

7
00:00:35,347 --> 00:00:40,809
Speaker 1: but it was so weird that I just kind of woke up this morning better than Usual better than average honestly when I woke up.

8
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,140
Speaker 0: I didn't expect you to you know actually be at work.

9
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:45,800
Speaker 0: I expect you to look out the window see the sleet and just give up.

10
00:00:46,721 --> 00:00:51,884
Speaker 1: See I probably would have given up except for the fact that when I went to push the snow off my car It just kind of went right off.

11
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:55,858
Speaker 1: It was heavy, but like it didn't I didn't have to scrape.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,213
Speaker 0: well The snow got worse later as opposed to earlier, which was odd.

13
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:03,511
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not what the weather said But anyway, we are crazy.

14
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:07,959
Speaker 0: party as you all know is over But the last survivor is still here.

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,030
Speaker 0: So we have a special guest Alex our dungeon master who will be joining us after the interlude and things of the day.

16
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,693
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not dungeon master like actual dungeon of torturing.

17
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:21,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, not the sadomasochism thing.

18
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:22,100
Speaker 1: Yeah the other kind.

19
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:26,824
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dungeons that have dragons in them kind But not real dragons.

20
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:28,489
Speaker 0: Oh, they're real enough.

21
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,113
Speaker 1: Oh, that would hurt.

22
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:32,379
Speaker 0: They do various D's worth of damage.

23
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:43,400
Speaker 1: Mmm D's All right, so Intel you know those people who make chips that we don't buy so often or you know ever there.

24
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:50,458
Speaker 1: Well, not only are they gonna be in the new Apple computers supposedly, but they finally got rid of Intel inside.

25
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,975
Speaker 1: really I mean like when's the first time you heard Intel inside like Pentium ones?

26
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:56,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it was Pentium ones.

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,433
Speaker 0: I remember seeing the commercials and seeing the stickers on computers.

28
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're changing the logo, too.

29
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,712
Speaker 1: It's still a blue swirly, but it's a different blue swirly and the.

30
00:02:04,852 --> 00:02:07,120
Speaker 1: they're even saying they're gonna get rid of the word Pentium.

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,681
Speaker 0: Really?

32
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:13,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I know a lot of people who they the word Pentium to them means processor.

33
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:17,327
Speaker 1: Yep But that's not how it's gonna.

34
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,191
Speaker 1: it's kinda like band-aid.

35
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,859
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess that's gonna change.

36
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:26,800
Speaker 0: now I wonder if there's anything to do with the fact that Apple doesn't want the Intel logo on their pretty not square not beige boxes.

37
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:33,300
Speaker 1: Some people are saying is that Intel, you know Intel would love to have Intel inside all over every freaking Mac.

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,269
Speaker 1: But I don't think Apple's gonna let that happen.

39
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:37,620
Speaker 1: and that's one thing people are pointing out.

40
00:02:37,972 --> 00:02:43,420
Speaker 0: You know I'd love to see like the actual agreement between Intel and Apple that led to this switching to Intel.

41
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:48,598
Speaker 1: I really think that all agreements between all major corporations need to be like public things that everyone can see.

42
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:52,032
Speaker 0: I Imagine there are parts that are hilarious because people like us don't get to read them.

43
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:52,815
Speaker 0: Mmm.

44
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:57,773
Speaker 1: There might be Another thing a lot of people pointed out that's not so well known.

45
00:02:58,415 --> 00:02:59,840
Speaker 1: is that Microsoft and Bill Gates?

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,792
Speaker 1: Really don't like Intel and Intel really doesn't like Microsoft.

47
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:06,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's not the reasons you'd expect.

48
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:06,967
Speaker 1: it's mostly the.

49
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:16,686
Speaker 1: Intel doesn't like Microsoft because You know Intel makes a chip and they like to add features to the chip like they added MMX then they added SSE Then they added SSE to right now.

50
00:03:16,706 --> 00:03:20,740
Speaker 1: think back in time when Intel had a 32-bit chip the Pentiums, right?

51
00:03:21,582 --> 00:03:26,032
Speaker 1: The MS the Microsoft operating system Windows was a 16-bit operating system.

52
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:29,119
Speaker 1: then Microsoft made a 32-bit operating system.

53
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:33,309
Speaker 1: Then Intel made a 64-bit chip that Itanium.

54
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:34,131
Speaker 1: that didn't go anywhere.

55
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:38,140
Speaker 1: Did Microsoft make a 64-bit operating system kind of.

56
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:43,198
Speaker 1: But they got one that's gonna work with the AMD's that's gonna come out.

57
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:45,928
Speaker 1: I don't even know the status of that.

58
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,172
Speaker 0: AMD did it right?

59
00:03:47,252 --> 00:03:48,818
Speaker 0: I mean basically Intel decided.

60
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:54,318
Speaker 0: All right x86 has been extended to the point of stupid and we're gonna make a new architecture kinda.

61
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:57,006
Speaker 0: and AMD said, you know what?

62
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:58,612
Speaker 0: We're just gonna extend x86 to 64-bit.

63
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:06,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you ever actually code an x86 assembly language, you're kind of on Intel's side.

64
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:13,527
Speaker 0: But other than that, you know from a business sense or just from a realistic point of view It's really hard to introduce a new chip.

65
00:04:13,607 --> 00:04:17,178
Speaker 0: That's not at all backward compatible with the rest of the world.

66
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:26,898
Speaker 1: Yeah But actually I I heard that Bill Gates once or currently still owns many many shares of AMD You know, so there's something going on there.

67
00:04:27,602 --> 00:04:28,445
Speaker 0: Well, think about it.

68
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:32,820
Speaker 0: buying a computer with an AMD processor gets you a faster computer for a lot less money.

69
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:38,736
Speaker 0: so you have a lot more money to spend on a Windows license and Windows seems faster and you feel like you got a better deal.

70
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:45,420
Speaker 1: Yep Well, the final piece of the puzzle is that apparently like Dell and Microsoft are kind of fighting a little bit, too.

71
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:56,660
Speaker 1: So it's like if Intel and Microsoft are fighting and Dell and Microsoft are fighting, you know, who knows that whole Dell Wintel kind of action might all break apart in a few months.

72
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't be hilarious if we ended up back on power PC.

73
00:04:59,855 --> 00:05:04,452
Speaker 0: That would be so great Except we won't because power PC chips are really expensive.

74
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:12,140
Speaker 1: I see a future where Dell releases computers with AMD chips in them and you have a choice of getting Windows or not.

75
00:05:12,964 --> 00:05:13,587
Speaker 0: I could see that.

76
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:21,090
Speaker 1: I could definitely see that and I could see Apple with the the Intel's.

77
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,777
Speaker 1: I could see people running Windows on those.

78
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,580
Speaker 0: Yeah I also see a lot of people running Linux on new Apple hardware.

79
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,474
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you ran Linux on old Apple hardware with PPCs.

80
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:33,040
Speaker 1: They're gonna run it even easier on the new stuff.

81
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:37,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, more importantly things like wine will work As opposed to before.

82
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:38,831
Speaker 1: There's a lot of talk about that.

83
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:51,539
Speaker 1: It seems sort of rumorish though that You're basically gonna be able to run Windows applications on the Intel Macs Just like you double-click them and they run the same way that OS 9 applications seem to just run in OS X.

84
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:55,180
Speaker 0: Wow, that would be kind of amazing.

85
00:05:56,301 --> 00:06:00,799
Speaker 1: Yep, I might get a Mac if they do that because maybe I'll be first in line for a power book if it does that.

86
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:09,219
Speaker 0: If anyone's ever tried to use wine to make programs work like Windows programs work in Linux It's pretty much just completely hit or miss and there's very little you can actually do.

87
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:13,300
Speaker 0: It's either it works or just crashes with random obscure like stack dumps.

88
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:19,960
Speaker 1: Yeah right now you can do it with virtual PC But that's like a money thing and you need a Windows disk and you need Windows license and all that.

89
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, or VMware, but it's the same deal.

90
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:23,413
Speaker 0: You also have to pay for VMware.

91
00:06:23,493 --> 00:06:25,200
Speaker 1: Who knows what Apple's working on back there?

92
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:31,799
Speaker 0: So, you know what we'll soon find out might be a rumor like the infinite number of rumors They're just completely made every day about all this.

93
00:06:31,944 --> 00:06:38,373
Speaker 1: Yeah none of the stuff that we say on this podcast is a hundred percent guaranteed because we Get most of it just by reading websites.

94
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:39,400
Speaker 1: and who can trust any of that?

95
00:06:39,842 --> 00:06:42,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, look we linked to slashed out more than any other site.

96
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:43,097
Speaker 1: Do we really?

97
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:43,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

98
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,199
Speaker 1: We should go do some statistics on that now we could anyway.

99
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:54,740
Speaker 1: So in the escapist this week Which seems to have gotten better a little bit even though I didn't read the full articles

100
00:06:55,001 --> 00:07:00,683
Speaker 0: Like we did we neither one of us read it today and we were talking about it and we were making fun of the escapist like you know what.

101
00:07:00,783 --> 00:07:10,180
Speaker 0: there's gonna be an article about a girl gamer who's oppressed and then there's gonna be an article about Eve online and Then there's gonna be an article that makes a good light of some stupid subculture that no one else cares about.

102
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:11,706
Speaker 1: Well, there was one of those.

103
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:14,699
Speaker 1: Oh great, but it was about game stores.

104
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:15,020
Speaker 1: this week.

105
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,104
Speaker 1: you know the game stops in the EBS and the independent guys and Yeah, a lot about how.

106
00:07:20,465 --> 00:07:22,472
Speaker 0: the margins are real tight for these stores.

107
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,720
Speaker 0: They really make all their money off the use game.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,552
Speaker 1: Now I knew the margins were tight and that's why they love the pre-orders because when you pre-order a game They know they've sold it and it's a guaranteed profit.

109
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:35,612
Speaker 0: plus you're gonna be in that store Not once but twice and you might buy a used game in that interim.

110
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:40,075
Speaker 1: Yep, you go you're gonna pre-order it Then you're gonna leave then you're gonna come back and you're gonna buy the game.

111
00:07:40,296 --> 00:07:41,080
Speaker 1: That's two visits.

112
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:43,352
Speaker 1: Who knows what you're gonna buy during those two visits plus?

113
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:44,820
Speaker 0: a lot of people are real dumb.

114
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:53,110
Speaker 0: They'll buy like ten new games and then after they beat them all they'll take them all over to EB Sell them back for a pittance to buy like one more new game.

115
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:59,560
Speaker 0: Yep, then EB sells all those games for like Ten percent off of the original retail price.

116
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,999
Speaker 0: They make a pile of money and then they someone sells it back to him again.

117
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:10,989
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm as someone who doesn't sell games back ever no matter how crappy they are but buys used games I don't really care if the game store makes money.

118
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:14,879
Speaker 1: I get the used games cheap and you know, yep I think you're dumb if you sell them back.

119
00:08:15,343 --> 00:08:17,100
Speaker 0: Remember funko land back in the day?

120
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,047
Speaker 0: It was the first game store that was kind of like.

121
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:30,419
Speaker 0: it's like it was the the predecessor the precursor to like modern EBS and game stops, yep, and Basically like the whole gimmick was the funko land had consoles out and you could just try games before you bought them.

122
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:34,919
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that piles of games you just walk up like I want to play blah and they'd put it in for you.

123
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,999
Speaker 0: You could play it for as long as you wanted.

124
00:08:36,241 --> 00:08:40,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, the only place you could do that was Toys R Us that had the demo machines that would go for five minutes.

125
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,087
Speaker 0: Yep, but this was like the real deal.

126
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:42,789
Speaker 0: just consoles like.

127
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,220
Speaker 0: that's the only way I ever played a Sega Saturn.

128
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,410
Speaker 0: Wow, because they had one and I played.

129
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 1: I played a Sega Saturn and a Toys R Us a couple times.

130
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:50,339
Speaker 1: That was pretty cool.

131
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:55,210
Speaker 0: But I remember I had Final Fantasy 1 for the NES Mm-hmm, and they always.

132
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:56,660
Speaker 0: they always had this sheet in the store.

133
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,251
Speaker 0: That's like the bounties on games and I looked and they were willing to pay $35 for a Final Fantasy 1 cartridge.

134
00:09:04,035 --> 00:09:06,347
Speaker 0: Wow, so I Went home and I got it.

135
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,297
Speaker 0: I sold my Final Fantasy 1 cartridge to him for 35 bucks.

136
00:09:09,602 --> 00:09:16,400
Speaker 0: Okay, and then like a month later I was in that same funko land and I saw Final Fantasy 1 for 15 bucks and you got it and I bought it back.

137
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:17,284
Speaker 0: Awesome.

138
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:19,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why funko lands gone.

139
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,059
Speaker 0: Yep Well that and funko land was really kind of ghetto.

140
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, he didn't notice his kids because we just wanted to play the games.

141
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,320
Speaker 0: We never actually bought anything really.

142
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,808
Speaker 1: But yeah, we never really went to funko land my family.

143
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:32,390
Speaker 1: We're just all.

144
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:38,760
Speaker 1: Toys R Us action mostly which was cool Because Toys R Us, you know had likes a little piece of paper

145
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:46,351
Speaker 0: Yeah the wall of pieces of paper and you pick it up and then you'd go and pay and then you go to that little booth behind The checkout and you give me your little slip and then they gave you the

146
00:09:46,371 --> 00:09:52,159
Speaker 1: game and all the consoles and the hardware is in this glass case and you walked over to the glass case and it was like

147
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:54,323
Speaker 0: Man.

148
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,340
Speaker 0: my parents hated my little brother and I because like once a month they take us to Toys R Us.

149
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,280
Speaker 0: They're like you guys can buy one game and we would stand there and debate for like four hours.

150
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,940
Speaker 1: I was standing there for like an hour walking back and forth trying to find the right game.

151
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:19,476
Speaker 1: Sometimes it was hit Sometimes it was missed because I really didn't have much to go on because I wouldn't buy a game that I you know My friend had and I didn't really know what to look for and I didn't get a magazine to tell me what to get because

152
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:24,876
Speaker 0: I remember one Super Mario 3 and Zelda 2 were both out and we didn't have either one.

153
00:10:24,896 --> 00:10:25,819
Speaker 0: We could only get one game.

154
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:28,680
Speaker 0: Mmm, we there was no way to decide.

155
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:32,394
Speaker 1: I remember having to decide between like Kirby's adventure and something else.

156
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 1: kind of glad I got Kirby's adventure.

157
00:10:42,721 --> 00:10:47,916
Speaker 1: So if you played counter-strike before you know all about the dust maps dust and dust.

158
00:10:47,956 --> 00:10:51,339
Speaker 0: that map called dust Dust dust.

159
00:10:54,008 --> 00:10:57,012
Speaker 1: You s T as in the tea you drink.

160
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:57,535
Speaker 0: Yeah.

161
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:01,920
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, if you haven't played counter-strike, you have no idea what the hell we're talking about.

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,768
Speaker 1: But let me just say it's no.

163
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,456
Speaker 0: there's no one in the world who hasn't played counter-strike.

164
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:09,160
Speaker 1: All right, then It's that map, you know where it's a die.

165
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,887
Speaker 1: It's a bomb map and not a rescue.

166
00:11:10,907 --> 00:11:11,931
Speaker 1: the hostages man the math.

167
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,960
Speaker 0: everyone plays on the freaking crates in the desert.

168
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:34,900
Speaker 1: To this day from the earliest counter-strike beta 5 to the current counter-strike source it is still the number one map that is played more often and Usually map makers are weird people or they're hard to find people, you know And they don't really talk so much and you don't hear about them or they kill themselves.

169
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:39,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, like there was one math and I really won't get into it but it was a stupid map like.

170
00:11:39,267 --> 00:11:51,607
Speaker 0: it was the worst counter-strike map I'd ever played and The guy who made it committed suicide and Because of that the map got really popular and people like really talked it up like in homage to him And you know what the map was crap.

171
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,129
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

172
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,715
Speaker 1: I think it's homage but whatever.

173
00:11:54,096 --> 00:12:02,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Usually don't see too much about map makers even though it's a really hard job And I've tried to make maps and it is really difficult and it takes mad skill.

174
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,933
Speaker 1: Mostly cuz a lot a lot of documentation on it.

175
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:11,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, not like the doom two days Just whip one together, but the maker of dust and dust two and some other maps on his website.

176
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,325
Speaker 1: I think his name is Dave Johnston.

177
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:19,299
Speaker 1: It's John stow code at UK as the making of dust and the making of dust two.

178
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:26,176
Speaker 1: and If you've ever played counter-strike and you know, you know about the dust maps.

179
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:27,439
Speaker 1: This is a month.

180
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,928
Speaker 1: Burp is a absolute must read absolutely must read.

181
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:39,480
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not very long and Just looking at the pictures is like holy crap.

182
00:12:40,102 --> 00:12:59,719
Speaker 1: he shows you stuff that you didn't even realize like here's a picture where on the left is beta for and You can see on the close bomb spot like the two crates where they're positioned and on the right is cs 1.5 and you can see that two crates have been moved and been rotated Diagonally so that when you're planting the bomb you have more cover.

183
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,582
Speaker 1: And it's like oh wow You don't even.

184
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:07,320
Speaker 1: it's something you don't even notice even if you play the two games one after the other.

185
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,112
Speaker 1: But you look at the picture and you're like wow a lot goes into map making.

186
00:13:11,153 --> 00:13:17,058
Speaker 0: that is like, you know, totally complicated Yep, and tiny little things completely change how a map works.

187
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:21,556
Speaker 1: Yep I mean look he even shows the ins in beta for and Earl.

188
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:26,840
Speaker 1: in such times They didn't really have shadows and then you can see his say to see us one and a half they had shadows.

189
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:35,805
Speaker 1: So now all of a sudden you you know The whole map changes because now what used to be just normal places are now like optimal hiding places And that might change.

190
00:13:35,845 --> 00:13:39,099
Speaker 1: the whole dynamic of the map is that you can hide in certain places and things.

191
00:13:39,762 --> 00:13:42,474
Speaker 0: So if you've ever played counter-strike read this, it's cool.

192
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:43,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's very very cool.

193
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:53,780
Speaker 0: so I was on FARC today like I do and Lo and behold there was a religious flame war as there always is because those never happen on far.

194
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,615
Speaker 1: No, it's like that's like the rarest thing.

195
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:56,018
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

196
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,104
Speaker 0: Now this one came up.

197
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:05,498
Speaker 0: it was some funny story about a judge in Italy is basically Basically some guy sued and a judge in Italy is ordered a man to prove that Jesus exists.

198
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:07,546
Speaker 1: Way to go.

199
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:14,159
Speaker 0: I can't wait to see how that trial goes But in the thread about three-quarters of the way down.

200
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:27,118
Speaker 0: someone posted a funny little comic that basically sums up every FARC flame war about religion ever and I won't explain it because it's a comic and you can read it and I found it funny and It kind of sums up my beliefs regarding that sort of thing.

201
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:31,370
Speaker 1: I Think it sums up the beliefs of every rational human being.

202
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, like the brights.

203
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:36,958
Speaker 0: Yep, not bright as in I'm a bright person but bright isn't that movement of naturalism?

204
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,883
Speaker 1: Mmm naturalism.

205
00:14:38,984 --> 00:14:40,368
Speaker 0: we should talk about that some Thursday.

206
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:42,314
Speaker 1: the brights we should they're cool.

207
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:42,756
Speaker 0: Yep.

208
00:14:42,976 --> 00:14:43,277
Speaker 1: I'm one.

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,730
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm not one, but I agree with them.

210
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,044
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm To be one.

211
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:49,454
Speaker 1: Oh, it really is felt their website.

212
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much Yeah, whatever.

213
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:55,388
Speaker 0: But Like I said at the beginning we have our guests.

214
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:01,185
Speaker 0: Alex are for our current dungeon master our former live dungeon master But he doesn't live near us anymore.

215
00:15:01,246 --> 00:15:03,755
Speaker 0: So we play online and we've got him here too.

216
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:05,944
Speaker 0: Well first do a thing of the day Greetings.

217
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:20,100
Speaker 2: Well if you're like me or in which you're a Computer science student or recently ex computer science student or maybe just in general Working at Google has this semi legendary aura.

218
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:27,926
Speaker 2: It People make up all sorts of stories about how hard it is to get in there There was the story going around for a while.

219
00:15:27,946 --> 00:15:31,420
Speaker 2: You need a PhD to actually get hired by Google as a programmer.

220
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:44,140
Speaker 2: not really true, but So among of the things that Google workers actually get up to is they order quarter quarter tons That's 250 pounds of silly putty.

221
00:15:45,181 --> 00:15:47,772
Speaker 2: Apparently you can order it in bulk directly from the manufacturer.

222
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:48,716
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

223
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:49,599
Speaker 1: How much does it cost?

224
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,891
Speaker 1: Google money or can you use normal money?

225
00:15:53,312 --> 00:15:55,259
Speaker 2: I actually don't know but I suspect normal money.

226
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:59,239
Speaker 2: This was just a couple of the employees decided to do this.

227
00:15:59,643 --> 00:16:01,140
Speaker 2: Well by a couple I mean a couple dozen.

228
00:16:01,802 --> 00:16:12,479
Speaker 2: Oh and when a couple dozen people place a bulk order for silly putty what you end up with is a Quarter ton of silly putty in the form of about six bricks the size of my torso laying on a guy's desk.

229
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,523
Speaker 0: Great Wow.

230
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:19,360
Speaker 2: now these bricks all stacked up, but you can't take that much silly putty home at once.

231
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,077
Speaker 2: You got to split it up among all the people who ordered.

232
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:32,956
Speaker 2: Problem is as anyone who's played the silly putty knows It's much easier to stick together than it is to take apart Haha, and the problem is only magnified when you've got 250 pounds of it.

233
00:16:34,846 --> 00:16:38,075
Speaker 2: so Scissors didn't really work knives.

234
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:44,995
Speaker 2: Not so much Wrenching and tearing kinda but that's like taking fingerfuls off of the mass.

235
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,660
Speaker 0: They obviously didn't think this through.

236
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:50,838
Speaker 1: No, they didn't what it that you think they would being the smart Google people.

237
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:53,283
Speaker 2: Perhaps they would.

238
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:58,098
Speaker 2: they try to but it was overruled by the whimsical impulse to see 250 pounds of silly putty in one place.

239
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,560
Speaker 0: I'm gonna admit I'd pay a decent sum of money to see that in person.

240
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:05,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, wonder how the silly putty company does it at the factory?

241
00:17:06,962 --> 00:17:10,038
Speaker 1: Maybe they just make it in smaller bits so they don't have to take it apart.

242
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,387
Speaker 2: In any case this has a happy ending.

243
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:17,944
Speaker 2: all the employees involved the couple dozen of them hacked and Nawed away at this.

244
00:17:18,325 --> 00:17:23,460
Speaker 2: Hopefully not literally for a couple hours and they all got their handful of silly putty, huh?

245
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,940
Speaker 1: You know, it probably would have worked Either like freezing it and then going at it with like a chainsaw or an axe.

246
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:33,700
Speaker 1: I think an axe would have worked really well actually putty shards everywhere.

247
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,968
Speaker 1: Hmm, let me minus the freezing plus the axe.

248
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,620
Speaker 0: How about one of those water cutters where it shoots a stream of water?

249
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,659
Speaker 0: That's really sharp because it's moving fast when silly putty gets mad slimy and scary.

250
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:47,962
Speaker 0: Those water cutters don't make things wet Really?

251
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:55,622
Speaker 0: Basically, it shoots a sheet of super pressurized super concentrated water that acts like an extremely sharp Nano knife.

252
00:17:56,164 --> 00:17:56,425
Speaker 1: Hmm.

253
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:58,933
Speaker 0: They use them to like cut pipes in industrial settings.

254
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,335
Speaker 0: Maybe they're really cool All right.

255
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,290
Speaker 0: So anyway, I have to do things of the day.

256
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:14,460
Speaker 0: we move on to the main bit which is Dungeons & Dragons And the three of us have been playing Dungeons & Dragons for most of our sentient lives.

257
00:18:15,322 --> 00:18:18,180
Speaker 0: So we thought we would be a good group to talk about Dungeons & Dragons.

258
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,631
Speaker 1: I don't think I've been playing for most of my sentient life.

259
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,620
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, you're really honestly in our group.

260
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,603
Speaker 0: You're kind of the newbie.

261
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:27,556
Speaker 1: I played it in middle school times, which is like seventh grade.

262
00:18:27,596 --> 00:18:33,318
Speaker 1: So I was 13 and I'm now 20 so almost half of my sentient life.

263
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:42,200
Speaker 2: Wow I played it a little in my younger days But actually I didn't get seriously into it until I got to college when I finally got together a serious group to play in.

264
00:18:43,062 --> 00:18:44,068
Speaker 0: Are you making me feel old?

265
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:45,980
Speaker 0: because I like played first edition?

266
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:58,872
Speaker 0: Well, I played Dungeons & Dragons and then I played a advanced Dungeons & Dragons first edition And then I I converted to second edition and then I converted to third edition And I went to cons when I was a little kid.

267
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,300
Speaker 0: I was like this little little kid.

268
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:06,722
Speaker 0: I went to like little cons in Michigan and there are all these big scary guys and they all drank Mountain Dew and they were Creepy.

269
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:10,140
Speaker 1: see we would have done that but there just weren't enough nerds in my town to do it.

270
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:10,924
Speaker 0: Oh there weren't.

271
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,840
Speaker 0: I had to drive like hours to get to these little tiny cons.

272
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,119
Speaker 1: Well, I meant for like to play D&D at all.

273
00:19:17,985 --> 00:19:25,876
Speaker 1: Like if there are three nerds you really that's not enough Yeah, and you really even if you had five nerds, you couldn't get them all together at the same time.

274
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:27,140
Speaker 1: This didn't happen.

275
00:19:28,482 --> 00:19:31,133
Speaker 0: So we figured we'd start with the obvious question.

276
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:32,880
Speaker 0: What is Dungeons & Dragons?

277
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,072
Speaker 1: Because a lot of people have a little misconception about it.

278
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:41,307
Speaker 0: Yeah a lot of stereotypes and Yeah, yeah and I mean there are different ways to play it.

279
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:50,382
Speaker 0: Dungeons & Dragons is really just a way of Role-playing as in pick a role and play it and there are rules to moderate that role-playing Mm-hmm.

280
00:19:50,964 --> 00:19:54,859
Speaker 0: So I guess the simplest simplest way to describe it is you say what your character does.

281
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,150
Speaker 0: That's all you really have to do.

282
00:19:57,392 --> 00:19:58,600
Speaker 0: Everything else is just semantics.

283
00:19:59,986 --> 00:20:09,126
Speaker 1: it's like You know how kids will have make-believe and they'll just imagine whatever they want to imagine, you know, they'll read a story They'll imagine themselves being the character.

284
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,289
Speaker 1: They'll change the story.

285
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,900
Speaker 1: You know, who knows what little kids imagine or what anyone imagines?

286
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:30,708
Speaker 1: D&D is just a way where you can imagine in a group and you put a set of rules to limit your imagination and if you know anything about imagining you'll know that creativity is Increased when limits are placed on the thinking.

287
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,440
Speaker 2: those limits act as guidelines and it forces you to think harder about them.

288
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,460
Speaker 2: Yes, the two major limitations guidelines whatever you want to call them in D&D are the dice.

289
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:45,009
Speaker 2: you can declare your characters actions, but there's not always a guarantee of success.

290
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:56,237
Speaker 2: and the dungeon master who if he or she is doing his or her job would should hopefully be Guiding you all towards some kind of plots or providing opportunities for plots.

291
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:16,197
Speaker 0: Yep I mean basically the way the game works for any of you have never played it or have only seen like television representations of it is a bunch of geeks sit around in a room and Each one of them is playing a character and there's one guy who for us was usually Alex who was the dungeon master or the game master and all they do is adjudicate they.

292
00:21:16,498 --> 00:21:23,458
Speaker 0: they Resolve every situation that can't be resolved like just with dice automatically or they just can't be resolved.

293
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:26,024
Speaker 0: Obviously Like if Scott is play.

294
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:34,291
Speaker 0: Scott is a thief and he tries to steal my purse for some reason and coin purse not woman purse Merce Merce.

295
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:39,671
Speaker 0: and Now the dungeon master decides what must be done to decide if that actually happens or not.

296
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:41,898
Speaker 0: Maybe he succeeds maybe fails.

297
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:42,580
Speaker 0: Maybe I kill him.

298
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:50,960
Speaker 2: The dungeon master also decides to provide the players with other challenges so that they're not just trying to steal from each other.

299
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:58,349
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be pretty boring if it was just four people, you know That's why you you imagine an entire world around the characters.

300
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:07,760
Speaker 2: unlike most games D&D isn't really competitive which is That doesn't really fit with the conventional definition of a game.

301
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,380
Speaker 2: But we've got nothing else but nothing else better to apply to something that involves all these rules and dice and paper.

302
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:16,392
Speaker 0: They're saving a lot of people who don't get that aspect of it.

303
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:17,497
Speaker 0: Like they always ask.

304
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:18,119
Speaker 0: So, how do I win?

305
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:46,240
Speaker 1: Yep, it's always kind of scary when you see someone like They're angry about dying or you know They feel like if they're not winning a fight in D&D that they're kind of losing a game and it's like alright, you know I really don't care which way things go, you know, I try to make it go the most interesting way not necessarily Or the way that my character would want, you know things to go Not necessarily towards any winning or losing condition that I might imagine that doesn't exist.

306
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:56,205
Speaker 2: See, it's what it's one thing to get emotionally involved with your character and that that can actually be a good thing because that's Makes your role play a little more strongly and also be a very bad thing If you get too far.

307
00:22:56,286 --> 00:23:03,059
Speaker 2: and it can be very bad thing because you can't accept that This person was ultimately badass in your heads can lose.

308
00:23:03,562 --> 00:23:05,331
Speaker 2: Yes, they're not ultimately badass.

309
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:11,979
Speaker 2: if they were ultimately badass They wouldn't need to wander around doing the piddly little mercenary jobs that make up your standard D&D.

310
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:18,012
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why those kind of people play those epic games which are just silly.

311
00:23:18,414 --> 00:23:20,840
Speaker 0: yeah now we say we kept seeing Dungeons & Dragons.

312
00:23:21,021 --> 00:23:22,726
Speaker 0: That's just because that's the game we play.

313
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:31,660
Speaker 0: I mean role-playing is a really broad very just Ephemeral genre of gaming where there's a million different systems and a million different ways to do it.

314
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,356
Speaker 0: We just happen to use the Dungeons & Dragons system.

315
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:34,839
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

316
00:23:35,442 --> 00:23:39,160
Speaker 0: And so we're kind of we're really avoiding these things specific to that system.

317
00:23:39,642 --> 00:23:42,660
Speaker 0: So we're saying Dungeons & Dragons but take that to mean role-playing in general.

318
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,273
Speaker 1: I suppose you can play gurps or what white wolf or amber.

319
00:23:46,474 --> 00:23:48,020
Speaker 0: amber was cool because it didn't use any dice.

320
00:23:48,361 --> 00:23:52,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, or any of those other systems are all pretty much played in the same way.

321
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:58,951
Speaker 1: It's just a different set of rules and limitations and that can modify The way the games come out.

322
00:23:58,972 --> 00:23:59,999
Speaker 1: In fact, it usually does.

323
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:13,307
Speaker 1: But in essence, it's just the same thing, you know There's a master or game master of some sort and a bunch of characters and you act out some sort of Imaginary world to entertain yourselves.

324
00:24:13,988 --> 00:24:16,255
Speaker 0: So why do we play Dungeons & Dragons?

325
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,494
Speaker 1: I Can tell you why I play Dungeons & Dragons because you get to play things like mind.

326
00:24:21,535 --> 00:24:22,680
Speaker 0: flayers need people's brains.

327
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,542
Speaker 1: Well, that's fun.

328
00:24:23,622 --> 00:24:29,900
Speaker 1: But the thing is it's like there really isn't so much adventure going on in the world these days.

329
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,271
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess there is technically opportunity for adventure.

330
00:24:33,311 --> 00:24:39,756
Speaker 1: You can like join the Peace Corps or something, you know and go crazy but not so much when you want to do computers and things.

331
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:52,140
Speaker 1: so With D&D it like lets you and your group of friends Like create stories and have things happen to you that even though you all know they never really happened?

332
00:24:52,682 --> 00:24:54,429
Speaker 1: like you talk about them as if they happen.

333
00:24:54,469 --> 00:25:00,733
Speaker 1: like remember that time you did something crazy and You play D&D so that those crazy things will happen.

334
00:25:01,134 --> 00:25:02,240
Speaker 0: because we seriously do it.

335
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,480
Speaker 0: We'll be sitting around at dinner talking about the time the characters like had a free crazy fun adventure did something.

336
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,031
Speaker 0: We tell it just like it's a real story.

337
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:16,945
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm People's stupid mistakes laugh at laugh at people's successful things Stupid mistakes.

338
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:25,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I think Scott when even played Alright, I'm gonna do the like the unholy thing and tell a story from a Dungeons & Dragons game.

339
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:37,283
Speaker 0: Now normally in polite company one does not do this because the one thing that is the least Interesting to anyone else in the world other than telling someone about your own dream is telling someone about your Dungeons & Dragons Character.

340
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:40,418
Speaker 1: unless it's the other people who are playing in that game then I love to hear it.

341
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:58,260
Speaker 0: But to sum up very broadly we're a bunch of undead people and we're in a desert Desert desert wasteland for as far as the horizon goes in all directions And it's night and half the party's vampires and Scott is playing a vampire who is not so bright.

342
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:01,960
Speaker 0: I don't know if that was a function of Scott or a function of the character.

343
00:26:02,742 --> 00:26:03,505
Speaker 2: I think some of each.

344
00:26:04,007 --> 00:26:04,910
Speaker 1: it was definitely some of each.

345
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:18,794
Speaker 0: but he ticked off the party to the point that we tried to kill him and he decided to run away into the desert where there was no shade and eventually the Sun came up and Vampires don't like the Sun so much.

346
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:20,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, that wasn't too good.

347
00:26:21,135 --> 00:26:22,242
Speaker 1: No See I was.

348
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:28,825
Speaker 1: when I did that I was under the false impression that I would be able to make it somewhere before The Sun came up and I was wrong.

349
00:26:29,106 --> 00:26:32,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, the emphasis on the miles and miles and miles of desert wasteland.

350
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:43,553
Speaker 2: Yeah sort of the punchline of that situation was that According to the D&D rules a vampire who dies turns into this mist and goes back to his coffin the coffin that was still with the party.

351
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:56,838
Speaker 2: So, you know about half an hour after sunrise you have this vaguely sullen looking mitt cloud of fog scream Scrambling along the ground and going into a box to sulk.

352
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,280
Speaker 0: I mean we have a million stars like that.

353
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,995
Speaker 0: We won't tell them all but that's part of that's really one of the big reasons why we play.

354
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:05,356
Speaker 0: it's like.

355
00:27:05,396 --> 00:27:13,720
Speaker 0: it adds a dimension To our friendship that couldn't exist because like we all can play video games together, but we can't all kill a dragon together.

356
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:18,380
Speaker 1: Mmm with D&D we can yeah, and it doesn't take very long either.

357
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:35,939
Speaker 1: I mean you can sit around one night for like five hours and go on like a million mile Multi-month quest of Grand Adventure and it's as if you went on a million mile monthly month Quest of Grand Adventure, even though you sat on your ass on your couch and rolled some plastic rocks around.

358
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:44,010
Speaker 2: Yep It takes a little longer for my ants to actually come up with the adventures and the challenges and all that But not a whole lot longer.

359
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,100
Speaker 2: and to be honest, I like that kind of stuff.

360
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:54,100
Speaker 2: I like coming up with alternate worlds and alternate characters and Writing this little story of my own and then you guys can surprise me with it.

361
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,520
Speaker 2: So I have all the benefit of both reading and writing a story.

362
00:27:58,064 --> 00:27:59,400
Speaker 0: Like to me that's the best part of it.

363
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:12,941
Speaker 0: it's kind of like you've got a group of friends and together you're all acting out and writing a novel and You know what you want to do But you don't know what everyone else really wants to do and you can't always predict how people will react or how things will turn Out.

364
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:18,200
Speaker 0: so you're taking part in this like play, but you don't know how the play is going to end.

365
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,660
Speaker 0: So it's like you're reading a book, but you're writing it at the same time.

366
00:28:22,061 --> 00:28:23,508
Speaker 1: It's not even that you're writing a book.

367
00:28:23,889 --> 00:28:24,994
Speaker 1: It's that you're writing a book.

368
00:28:25,295 --> 00:28:26,280
Speaker 1: You're writing many books.

369
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:30,220
Speaker 1: You're writing the number of books equal to the number of players plus one.

370
00:28:30,701 --> 00:28:41,860
Speaker 1: The plus one is the DM who's writing a narrative book for the third person and each player is writing their own First-person book and they're all separate, but I guess you can put them all together and it'd be like one giant book.

371
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:54,539
Speaker 1: You know because like I know like the images in my head from you know Whatever the world was like or whatever adventure looked like but it's not even close, you know in words or pictures to what?

372
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,319
Speaker 1: You know anyone else thinks of the same exact game.

373
00:28:58,182 --> 00:28:59,585
Speaker 1: You know, it's just completely different.

374
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:05,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time we can all talk about it and it's the same but different.

375
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:17,244
Speaker 0: I Suppose we could consider like how we actually found out about Dungeons & Dragons or actually got into it in the first place Because until recently it's not like Dungeons & Dragons Advertised itself.

376
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:20,756
Speaker 0: It was just there and if you knew about it you knew about it.

377
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:23,806
Speaker 1: I Don't even think it advertises so recently.

378
00:29:24,107 --> 00:29:24,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does.

379
00:29:24,709 --> 00:29:26,917
Speaker 0: lately Wizards of the Coast isn't putting a lot of stuff that well.

380
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:33,238
Speaker 2: hasbro now Wizards has really tried to popularize it and with some degree of success.

381
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:40,300
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean it was doing real well until Everyone who bought the books realized that they never need to buy the books again, and there was no more market for the books.

382
00:29:40,902 --> 00:29:45,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean once you know the rules you don't really need to buy the rules again.

383
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:45,682
Speaker 1: it doesn't.

384
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:55,080
Speaker 1: you can't really make money off of it because the supplies are non-renewable and The supplies don't go obsolete I think and also you'd be surprised how many pirate sites there are out there.

385
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,217
Speaker 0: They just have like PDF scans of every book ever.

386
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,113
Speaker 0: hmm But like how we got into it, I mean I remember the first D&D I ever played.

387
00:30:04,133 --> 00:30:13,019
Speaker 0: I was real real real young like it was either my lat it was like the end of elementary school or the very very beginning of middle school.

388
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:20,140
Speaker 0: and Like I remember my uncle used to talk about he used to play Dungeons & Dragons And I didn't really know what it was and he didn't play anymore.

389
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,205
Speaker 0: he didn't have any books didn't talk about it a lot, but every now and then talked about it and I was curious and I met some people.

390
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:34,320
Speaker 0: I met this kid named Sidroni and yeah, his name was Sidroni and He was like you want to play some D&D and I went over to his house and he gave me this book.

391
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,418
Speaker 0: he was like make up a character and we'll play.

392
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:43,160
Speaker 0: and I guess this was an example of bad D&D as opposed to good D&D which we'll probably get into later.

393
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,860
Speaker 0: Because basically what D&D consisted for these guys was make a character and then kill things with it and make poop jokes.

394
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:54,399
Speaker 2: Wow, yeah, no one in this company makes poop jokes.

395
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,585
Speaker 1: Mmm At least I don't think anyone's ever made a character that makes a poop joke in character.

396
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:06,223
Speaker 0: Well, yeah I couldn't think of one which was surprising to me.

397
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:13,269
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, I want to find one but uh, I think I think it's time to make a character who's a little mature.

398
00:31:14,551 --> 00:31:15,996
Speaker 0: So Scott, how did you get into D&D?

399
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:18,786
Speaker 0: We never really talked about this not even outside of the podcast.

400
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:28,770
Speaker 1: Well, let's see When I was a little way little like elementary school ages There was a I knew the words Dungeons & Dragons and it was some sort of game.

401
00:31:29,493 --> 00:31:30,839
Speaker 1: I didn't know much about it at all.

402
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:38,337
Speaker 1: And I didn't wasn't really interested in seeking it out but I was friends with the nerdy kid who lived down the street and One day he got a game.

403
00:31:38,357 --> 00:31:39,865
Speaker 1: It said Dungeons & Dragons on it.

404
00:31:39,885 --> 00:31:52,328
Speaker 1: I was like, alright, whatever It's a big black box and inside there was like a bunch of cards and this big board and the board was like this dungeon made of squares and We never actually played the game.

405
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,082
Speaker 1: But it wasn't real Dungeons & Dragons.

406
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:57,493
Speaker 1: it was like Dungeons & Dragons Something something.

407
00:31:57,754 --> 00:32:03,753
Speaker 1: I remember when that came out and it was like you would do something and then he someone would take the card out of the box.

408
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:17,119
Speaker 1: anyway, the box of cards was the Dungeon Master and You know, it wasn't really so much the role playing as some sort of walk around a dungeon Crawl game on a board with little figures.

409
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,708
Speaker 2: It was your quest with vaguely D&D inspired.

410
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,695
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm not we never actually played it.

411
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:24,910
Speaker 1: So I'm not a hundred percent sure but that's just my memory of elementary school.

412
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,398
Speaker 2: I think I know the game you're talking about.

413
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:32,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then in middle school I went to this nerdy summer camp and I was big into magic in those days.

414
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:37,210
Speaker 1: Aha magic Yeah, which I soon learned my lesson on but anyway.

415
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:43,389
Speaker 1: So we play magic at adventure games, which was after dinner every day.

416
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:55,036
Speaker 1: But after lunch every day, there was a quiet time in the bunk And I don't know how many bunks did this but every bunk that I was in when I went to this camp all the kids played.

417
00:32:55,357 --> 00:33:01,240
Speaker 1: each cabin had their own little D&D game after lunch and I remember the the first time I played.

418
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,177
Speaker 1: they're like play the Dungeons & Dragons and I was like, alright I'm finally gonna play this freaking thing for real.

419
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:07,546
Speaker 1: It's like, alright, how do I play?

420
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:14,550
Speaker 1: they're like First you make a character and they gave me a second edition PHP and I was like, alright this tells me nothing.

421
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:19,390
Speaker 1: So then someone walked me through the whole thing and I had like a scrap of piece of paper with some numbers on it.

422
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,389
Speaker 1: I didn't understand it all.

423
00:33:21,492 --> 00:33:22,781
Speaker 1: And then I'm like, alright now, how do I play?

424
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:23,083
Speaker 1: they're like.

425
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:24,150
Speaker 1: you say what you do?

426
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:26,954
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh, that's it.

427
00:33:27,576 --> 00:33:27,877
Speaker 1: Yep.

428
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:28,599
Speaker 1: Really?

429
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:28,980
Speaker 1: That's it.

430
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:38,404
Speaker 1: And then after about two times of saying what I did I was like, ah And that was that.

431
00:33:40,272 --> 00:33:50,139
Speaker 1: The next time I played was I think when I went back to the camp again and then I played it pretty sparsely in high school and then when I got to college we went to the R Wagon, well that was it.

432
00:33:50,722 --> 00:33:55,069
Speaker 0: Ah, see I played it in high school more than I played it any other period in my life including college.

433
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:55,771
Speaker 1: Wow.

434
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:58,870
Speaker 1: Guess that's what happens when you have people.

435
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,115
Speaker 1: It's all about having people.

436
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:09,330
Speaker 2: The first D&D product I bought when my first real exposure to the game was actually the second edition Monster Manual.

437
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:17,130
Speaker 2: Prior to that I had this sort of vague conception that the game existed and I knew very roughly what it involved but not the details.

438
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:31,525
Speaker 2: But I was in a comic book store which often happens to sell D&D products as well and I happened to see this book and what I saw was a book full of a bunch of neat pictures of monsters and descriptions of them.

439
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:32,270
Speaker 1: That's a great book.

440
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,801
Speaker 2: And I like monsters for their own part.

441
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:34,929
Speaker 1: I love that book.

442
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:54,399
Speaker 2: So I bought it because I was a kid with apparently too much disposable income at the time and over the next few years that actually became sort of a source book for the informal half BS role playing that kids do.

443
00:34:55,443 --> 00:35:01,275
Speaker 2: I would have been in I think middle school possibly younger around this time.

444
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:04,569
Speaker 0: While we're getting old we can't remember when things happened in our lives anymore.

445
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:19,210
Speaker 2: And over the course of that I would gradually meet people occasionally who actually knew the game and would do these occasional one or two player games.

446
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:37,127
Speaker 2: There was one friend of mine in high school times who actually would do sort of one-on-one D&D which unless you can have no other kind, just kind of sucky, that's when I actually learned the second edition rules and how that actually was supposed to work.

447
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:46,250
Speaker 2: And then when I came to college suddenly I was with a group of 15 other people at RWAG all in one D&D game.

448
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,590
Speaker 0: Yeah we told you guys that story at least a month or two ago about the crazy D&D game with Dwayne the Dungeon Master.

449
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:57,243
Speaker 1: Yeah where I discovered oh there's a third edition because it had just come out at that time and I didn't even know.

450
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:57,769
Speaker 1: and yeah.

451
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:01,348
Speaker 1: And our third edition is what we still play, kind of.

452
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:09,210
Speaker 2: So it was after the Dwayne game kind of fell apart and we were all sitting around in the cafeteria talking about.

453
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:15,422
Speaker 2: we were talking about D&D in some fashion or another and I basically said screw it I'll run a game.

454
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:17,230
Speaker 2: I've never done this before but I'll see how it goes.

455
00:36:17,991 --> 00:36:19,469
Speaker 0: And it went real well I'll tell you what.

456
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,809
Speaker 1: That was some good D's and D's and D's.

457
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:41,989
Speaker 0: Because actually I mean like my first experience with D&D came early but I didn't play good D&D like I played it and it was fun but I didn't get it as in play it with really good people and actually role play well until high school or maybe it was right before high school and middle school I don't remember.

458
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:46,690
Speaker 1: That D&D that I played at that summer camp was not good D&D by any stretch of the imagination.

459
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,942
Speaker 1: Well I mean the first the first year I was there that we played.

460
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:51,550
Speaker 1: it was pretty much just terrible.

461
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:57,205
Speaker 1: it was like you know I was just some cleric and I did healing and that was pretty much it.

462
00:36:57,265 --> 00:37:02,030
Speaker 1: there wasn't really so much role-playing going on so much as like there are some monsters we all roll dice.

463
00:37:02,513 --> 00:37:04,890
Speaker 1: you walk there's some monsters we all roll dice.

464
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:16,328
Speaker 1: but then it got actually sort of involved when I died and I was reincarnated as an ogre and then I was like oh and then the game kind of changed from there yeah into something a little better.

465
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:18,646
Speaker 1: and that's when I got the idea of what it was supposed to be like.

466
00:37:19,532 --> 00:37:22,832
Speaker 0: Because like the first games that were like really really good is.

467
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:37,668
Speaker 0: I started playing with a bunch of my friends in high school and basically we played every Sunday meaning we'd all like meet around 10 a.m on Sunday and then we'd all go out shopping for food and then we'd play until like school started on Monday.

468
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:39,729
Speaker 1: Well that's real long.

469
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:46,256
Speaker 0: Yeah like we'd do 12-14 hour sessions just non-stop and then we'd watch anime like right after we were such geeks.

470
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:56,295
Speaker 0: but we really felt like our games really focused on the role-playing and very little on game mechanics and combat like it's kind of.

471
00:37:56,396 --> 00:38:02,221
Speaker 0: this might sound too nerdy or geeky but we actually had an entire gaming session where it based.

472
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,134
Speaker 0: the whole thing took place within a ball that someone was putting on.

473
00:38:05,154 --> 00:38:08,170
Speaker 0: our characters were just kind of hanging out and chatting.

474
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,527
Speaker 1: That's real geeky.

475
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,210
Speaker 0: Yeah it is.

476
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:12,941
Speaker 0: That's the kind of D&D I like.

477
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,010
Speaker 0: I like playing a character.

478
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:20,429
Speaker 1: Well the thing in D&D is that most of the book is the rules of fighting because those are the most complex rules you know.

479
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:27,309
Speaker 0: Well that and because the origin of D&D is a pure fighting game and they've kind of hammered it and pushed it into this mold of other things.

480
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,222
Speaker 1: Yeah but you know a better way to play D&D.

481
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:35,680
Speaker 1: that I think is to you know you fight when fighting makes sense and then there are rules for it.

482
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,537
Speaker 1: but yeah that doesn't mean you always you know just need to make it a game of fighting.

483
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:47,048
Speaker 1: you make it's a game of role-playing and when you role play in adventurey world which is usually what you want to play and you don't want to play in some boring world like this one.

484
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,502
Speaker 0: I mean I guess it's subjective.

485
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:49,110
Speaker 0: I mean everyone.

486
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,902
Speaker 0: If you enjoy playing D&D however you play it.

487
00:38:51,942 --> 00:38:56,029
Speaker 0: that's great because the best thing about the game is you can play it however you want with whoever wants to play it with you.

488
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:09,630
Speaker 0: So I might be up for the game of all talking where no one ever fights and just people talking to each other and Scott might like the game that's like a mix and some fanboy might like the game of I'm an ogre and I smash things in dungeons forever until I stop playing.

489
00:39:10,112 --> 00:39:16,716
Speaker 2: Yeah at least at least to me if you mean if you want to play that kind of thing you want to play something a little tactical game.

490
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,047
Speaker 2: D&D is not the best way to do it.

491
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,527
Speaker 2: there are better games for that.

492
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:21,185
Speaker 0: Yeah.

493
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,109
Speaker 2: But if that's your thing go for it.

494
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:35,484
Speaker 1: I mean there are plenty of tactical like war games that are not you know suit the more extract or games because D&D is not an in-depth war game by any stretch.

495
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:43,210
Speaker 1: but very few of them have all the creative options of D&D which is why I think people like to play it.

496
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:53,583
Speaker 1: I mean you play something like battle tech or whatnot and your options are pretty much like move shoot jump turn that sort of thing and D&D.

497
00:39:53,964 --> 00:40:11,869
Speaker 1: you can come up with crazy stuff because especially if you're a wizard you have so many spells you know you can and you have the terrain and you know you can really stretch your imagination within the words of the rule book to do all kinds of things that you can't do in a normal tactical game and

498
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:12,230
Speaker 2: in combat.

499
00:40:12,554 --> 00:40:13,428
Speaker 1: that really comes out.

500
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,275
Speaker 2: And not just the words of the rule book.

501
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:23,399
Speaker 2: and this is something that I think often leads to the bad versus good D&D.

502
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,051
Speaker 2: in my opinion and at least in the opinions of other people I've talked to.

503
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:28,735
Speaker 2: take that for what it's worth.

504
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:33,147
Speaker 2: the DM is your final arbiter.

505
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:43,075
Speaker 2: the rule book is a guideline and as a DM I often will just scrap a rule if I don't like the way it's gonna if I don't like the way it's gonna work.

506
00:40:43,295 --> 00:40:45,140
Speaker 2: I prefer drama over accuracy.

507
00:40:47,407 --> 00:40:49,657
Speaker 2: that said the rules are a starting place.

508
00:40:49,677 --> 00:40:55,649
Speaker 2: they're a common language that everyone speaks so everyone knows what they're capable of and what the things they're dealing with are capable of.

509
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:58,909
Speaker 2: so I don't try to break them without reason.

510
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:12,705
Speaker 0: Because I see you get like a lot of people who like I have friends who say they hate Dungeons and Dragons and I ask them why and they explain these games where their Dungeon Master was like a jerk and he basically just played a game of.

511
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:15,301
Speaker 0: I will never let the players win and everything they think of.

512
00:41:15,341 --> 00:41:16,369
Speaker 0: I'll come up with a way to stop it.

513
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,301
Speaker 1: So that's hero quest.

514
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:17,727
Speaker 1: that's not D&D.

515
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,319
Speaker 2: Yeah it is not the players versus the Dungeon Master.

516
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,422
Speaker 2: that's silly.

517
00:41:22,763 --> 00:41:26,778
Speaker 2: the Dungeon Master has absolute control over the world.

518
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,610
Speaker 2: it's not a challenge for anyone.

519
00:41:30,192 --> 00:41:34,346
Speaker 0: Yeah if the Dungeon Master wanted you know all right fine I'll.

520
00:41:34,386 --> 00:41:36,288
Speaker 0: Brock falls from the sky and kills all of you.

521
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,067
Speaker 1: Dragon eats you.

522
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:43,230
Speaker 1: If you want to play the Dungeon Master versus the players there's things that do that and they're not Dungeons and Dragons.

523
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,494
Speaker 0: Scott mentioned hero quest.

524
00:41:44,595 --> 00:41:51,569
Speaker 0: it's an old board game that is very much designed to be the Dungeon Master versus the players like specifically and it's actually kind of fun.

525
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,145
Speaker 1: Yep but it's not D&D.

526
00:41:54,231 --> 00:42:04,209
Speaker 0: Even though the last time we played it we all died because Scott in his infinite wisdom decided to run around a dungeon opening all the doors and waking all the monsters up before we finish fighting one monster.

527
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,810
Speaker 1: That's greatly exaggerated story.

528
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,707
Speaker 0: Not so much.

529
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:07,608
Speaker 1: Yeah so much.

530
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,257
Speaker 0: All right fine the specific story.

531
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:16,029
Speaker 0: we were fighting a chaos knight which is this big bad mofo with an axe and he was chopping us up but we were just about to beat him.

532
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:24,686
Speaker 0: Scott decided to run off on his own to look for treasure and he opened a door and in that room there were two more death knights and they killed him and then they've tracked us down and killed us.

533
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:29,654
Speaker 1: See it made sense to me that behind that guy see I didn't run around all over the dungeon opening doors.

534
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:36,730
Speaker 1: I opened a door because it made sense to me the way the dungeon was laid out that this monster was guarding a treasure in the next room and I was wrong.

535
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,469
Speaker 0: No it was guarding two more monsters.

536
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,368
Speaker 1: Yeah what a great monster guarding two more monsters.

537
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:49,050
Speaker 1: So that was just a case of bad luck but I did not run around opening doors willy-nilly getting monsters to chase me around to where the party was.

538
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,749
Speaker 0: You caused directly all of our deaths.

539
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:57,570
Speaker 1: You know in a game that would have made sense like D&D those monsters would have heard us fighting in the next room and come in anyway.

540
00:42:57,911 --> 00:43:02,370
Speaker 0: No no it makes sense because in a hero quest all the walls are made of uh magic lead.

541
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:03,730
Speaker 0: Oh great.

542
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:04,330
Speaker 0: Yeah yeah.

543
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:06,809
Speaker 2: Yeah absorbs all sound and energy.

544
00:43:07,814 --> 00:43:09,069
Speaker 2: Cannot be breached by any means.

545
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,470
Speaker 0: Or you know what they're chaos knights or death knights.

546
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:15,530
Speaker 0: I imagine the two in the other room probably didn't like the third one and they left them out there.

547
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:18,329
Speaker 0: but then when you open the door they couldn't hide anymore.

548
00:43:19,831 --> 00:43:24,853
Speaker 1: That's another thing I really like about D&D is when you get these tiny bits of flavor that you know.

549
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:49,579
Speaker 1: sometimes you read a fantasy novel or something and you'll get those the bits of flavor but usually not so much because a lot of them are you know focused on the main plot and the main characters and D&D you can get like you know like you're fighting a couple orcs and maybe one of them is a little silly or like maybe like you'll you'll go into a shop to buy something and the the owner will have a silly pet

550
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,425
Speaker 0: or the store

551
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,870
Speaker 1: will be arranged in a funny way.

552
00:43:53,171 --> 00:44:03,489
Speaker 0: Or just like the dice will come up with something improbable like someone who should have like some peasant who just should have been whacked doesn't get whacked and creates like this funny ongoing joke or this ongoing story that you didn't expect.

553
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:11,977
Speaker 1: Yep those are always great things because it's like somehow as a group you imagine something without any of you imagining it.

554
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:12,701
Speaker 1: yet there it is.

555
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:14,289
Speaker 1: it's way cool.

556
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,709
Speaker 2: The unpredictability keeps it interesting.

557
00:44:19,233 --> 00:44:22,509
Speaker 0: Yes of course you really have to play D&D with like good people who are going to get into it.

558
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,783
Speaker 0: Because one jerk in the group can just kind of ruin it.

559
00:44:25,803 --> 00:44:27,069
Speaker 0: of course you can always just kick them out.

560
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:38,024
Speaker 1: Yeah it's real hard to manage a D&D game and you can find all sorts of things online about how to keep it good how to tell which people are good and bad all this kind of stuff.

561
00:44:38,044 --> 00:44:42,186
Speaker 1: but it really helps if you do it with a bunch of friends and all the friends are good.

562
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:42,790
Speaker 1: Yep.

563
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:46,470
Speaker 1: If you're doing it with people you don't know but they're good it can still be kind of awkward.

564
00:44:46,571 --> 00:44:53,989
Speaker 1: and if you're doing with their friends and they're no good that can you know it's it's a guarantee has ruined at least one friendship in the history of the world.

565
00:44:56,471 --> 00:45:10,842
Speaker 2: Minor rant it's rather unfortunate how little of the published material by Wizards of the Coast TSR whatever TSR was a little better at this but not a whole lot actually is about how to role play or how to run a good game.

566
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:11,547
Speaker 2: Yeah.

567
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:17,749
Speaker 2: You get some of that in the magazine articles but it almost never appears in the actual books.

568
00:45:19,672 --> 00:45:21,198
Speaker 0: See I guess I never needed instruction.

569
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:24,473
Speaker 0: I just like I got it like all right I'll play a game I'll role play.

570
00:45:24,713 --> 00:45:32,985
Speaker 1: The only instruction I ever got was say what you do and then it's all you have to do is realize that you're not you you're the whatever you made and then it all.

571
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:33,487
Speaker 1: that's it.

572
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:36,519
Speaker 1: and if you can't do that then you're you're really.

573
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:38,086
Speaker 1: you know it takes practice.

574
00:45:38,187 --> 00:45:39,251
Speaker 1: once you get it no matter what.

575
00:45:39,351 --> 00:45:44,891
Speaker 1: but if you if you don't get it you know ever then this really it's kind of like a no hope sort of thing.

576
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:53,426
Speaker 0: I mean I guess it's if you're one of those people out there who played D&D once and it sucked and you hate it just try to give it a chance and try to find.

577
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:56,778
Speaker 0: try to find some people who don't suck and I think you'll like it a lot.

578
00:45:56,798 --> 00:46:03,302
Speaker 0: I mean I can't imagine many people who wouldn't like Dungeons and Dragons if they actually played it with cool people.

579
00:46:03,985 --> 00:46:13,091
Speaker 1: It's not like a video game where you play the video game and if you play it again it's going to be the same because the video game is the same every time or a song where if you hear the song again it's not going to be different.

580
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:15,279
Speaker 1: this you know if you listen to it with different people.

581
00:46:15,901 --> 00:46:29,312
Speaker 1: but D&D can be is like a thousand different things even though it's all based roughly on the same set of books and such and literature so that depending on where you play it with whom you play it you know what kind of D&D you're playing.

582
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:38,271
Speaker 1: it can be a completely different thing and you know a lot of people are put off of it based on a first experience or a bad experience and that's kind of sad because they're missing out.

583
00:46:40,077 --> 00:46:51,681
Speaker 0: Even though we're kind of missing out right now since we've we don't all live near each other anymore and it's real hard to play long distance like we've been experimenting with playing online in forums and it's working really well.

584
00:46:51,741 --> 00:47:01,120
Speaker 0: but it's not the same as the experience of sitting in a small dank college apartment with like nine of your closest friends for six hours in a row eating Chinese food and killing dragons.

585
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:09,957
Speaker 2: It's not the same experience as watching your dungeon master sweat as you do the improbable thing that he didn't think of and he tries to come up with a plausible outcome.

586
00:47:10,198 --> 00:47:15,319
Speaker 0: Oh you mean like three sessions into a giant epic campaign naming who the secret bad guy was accidentally?

587
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:16,282
Speaker 1: Yeah.

588
00:47:16,624 --> 00:47:18,250
Speaker 2: Yes I learned to keep a very good poker face.

589
00:47:19,391 --> 00:47:28,146
Speaker 1: Or coming up with a crazy crazy scheme to just jump to the end of the game and skip all the carefully prepared plot of the dungeon master making his efforts wasted in vain.

590
00:47:28,166 --> 00:47:30,153
Speaker 0: Like we were playing in Alex.

591
00:47:30,354 --> 00:47:32,202
Speaker 0: Alex ran this awesome requiem game.

592
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:39,912
Speaker 0: I don't really get into it but there was this giant like epic artifact building thing and it was this huge powerful thing and it was just a plot device.

593
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:46,981
Speaker 0: We were supposed to like see it and like look at it and figure out what it was and then it revealed a lot of the plot and we ran off to do our other things.

594
00:47:47,664 --> 00:48:01,121
Speaker 0: So way later in the game we're in a tough spot and instead of doing the obvious like all right fight your way through or do whatever we freaking traveled all the way back to this tower and used its awesome power that he didn't think we'd remember to completely circumvent part of the game.

595
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:05,538
Speaker 2: Yeah showed a little bit of a lack of foresight on my part.

596
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:06,764
Speaker 1: My favorite story.

597
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:08,070
Speaker 2: On the other hand it all turned out well.

598
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:08,851
Speaker 0: Yeah it did.

599
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:09,735
Speaker 0: See that's the thing.

600
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:14,676
Speaker 0: no matter how weird it gets it always works out because the story concludes itself somehow.

601
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:24,166
Speaker 1: My favorite story of D&D where something like that happened was the story of the very powerful druid versus the evil count in the castle.

602
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:47,835
Speaker 1: Basically this evil count in a castle had a evil castle on the like a cliff over an ocean and the party consisted of a bunch of people and a very powerful druid and they were going and there was suppose the DM already planned out what the inside of the castle looked like and the whole plot with the evil wizard and these traps and all this great stuff that was gonna go on in their quest through the castle to defeat the evil guy.

603
00:48:48,798 --> 00:49:00,097
Speaker 1: The druid being very powerful probably too powerful for this campaign summoned two very very large earthworm type things that ate all the dirt under the castle and the castle fell and sank into the ocean.

604
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,846
Speaker 0: I imagine the dungeon master crying.

605
00:49:03,548 --> 00:49:05,594
Speaker 1: That's about what happened right there.

606
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:08,522
Speaker 2: Yeah.

607
00:49:08,662 --> 00:49:09,324
Speaker 1: And that's just great.

608
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:11,389
Speaker 0: See I guess that's the best thing about D&D.

609
00:49:14,512 --> 00:49:22,495
Speaker 2: Well it's improvisation and the fact that don't let the fact that there are those rules there make it seem otherwise.

610
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:26,869
Speaker 2: The rules inspire improvisation much more than they limit it.

611
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:40,790
Speaker 0: I mean plus if you play with a good adjudicator or a good dungeon master you really don't need to know the rules so much as just know your character and explain what you want to do and he'll take care of all the rules and he'll work it all out for you and they'll tell you what happens.

612
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:48,618
Speaker 1: So if you're one of those people who has a stereotype of D&D about attacking darkness or drinking mountain dew and eating cheetos.

613
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:51,810
Speaker 0: If there are any girls there I wanna do them.

614
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,835
Speaker 0: A cast magic missile.

615
00:49:54,136 --> 00:50:02,849
Speaker 1: Yeah okay it's overdone but if you're one of those people you're only half right because only half the D&D in the world is played like that.

616
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:09,738
Speaker 1: The other half is really harder to find because it's hiding from the first half and it's good and don't be afraid of it.

617
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,218
Speaker 2: Even we who make those inside jokes occasionally really that's a minority of it.

618
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:22,530
Speaker 0: Yeah even though there is a lot of mountain dew drinking that is that is very prolific among Dungeons and Dragons players for some reason.

619
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,367
Speaker 2: In my case my first D&D the D&D campaign I ran for you guys.

620
00:50:26,387 --> 00:50:29,850
Speaker 2: the first one was powered almost entirely by Snapple Lightning.

621
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:37,154
Speaker 2: I think because it had the highest caffeine content per volume of liquid I could get and still stomach.

622
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:58,292
Speaker 0: I remember I went to the Michicon a gaming convention in Michigan and I was young and I was there and I played in a tournament D&D which it was just normal D&D but like there was an epic plot and it went on for like multiple days and the final session was like this eight hour long session in one room and it was kind of live action kind of Dungeons and Dragons.

623
00:50:58,874 --> 00:51:13,549
Speaker 0: but I remember there was like a soda machine in the room and it had mountain dew in two of the slots and by the end of the session not only was the machine empty but there was an entire tower constructed of mountain dew cans surrounding the room.

624
00:51:14,892 --> 00:51:17,844
Speaker 1: I remember I played in one D&D tournament once at the summer camp.

625
00:51:17,944 --> 00:51:33,364
Speaker 1: actually it was a like a contest held sometime near the end of the session and it was sort of a solve the puzzles and get to the end of the dungeon the fastest tournament where you know they had the same dungeon and they you know there were different groups and it was.

626
00:51:33,586 --> 00:51:37,043
Speaker 1: you know if your group could get to the end of the dungeon faster than the other group then you won.

627
00:51:37,707 --> 00:51:39,496
Speaker 1: and you know there are a bunch of puzzles and things.

628
00:51:39,757 --> 00:51:46,083
Speaker 1: so it wasn't really so much the role playing as much the puzzle solving but it was still kind of fun you know.

629
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:51,522
Speaker 1: and and that's just another way that you know you can use D&D to do cool stuff I remember.

630
00:51:52,265 --> 00:51:52,586
Speaker 0: All right.

631
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:57,678
Speaker 0: so we've gone on about D&D a lot and this might set the record for the longest podcast ever.

632
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,440
Speaker 1: Awesome.

633
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:01,988
Speaker 0: So yeah.

634
00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:07,856
Speaker 1: That's why you should play D&D because it's it's so great that you could just talk about it forever and even though you spent maybe.

635
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:16,571
Speaker 0: I mean I don't know I don't think you realize out there how hard it was for us to not like actually tell all those stories we were making reference to or thinking about in great detail.

636
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,213
Speaker 1: Wouldn't you love to have your own stories?

637
00:52:26,759 --> 00:52:28,903
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
