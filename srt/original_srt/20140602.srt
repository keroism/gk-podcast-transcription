1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,562
Speaker 1: It's Monday, June 2nd, 2014.

2
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:13,003
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,144 --> 00:00:13,665
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,765 --> 00:00:15,390
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,154
Speaker 1: Old computers, the oldest.

6
00:00:21,058 --> 00:00:22,060
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:40,860
Speaker 1: So for those of you who don't pay attention to what I do kind of outside of Geek Nights, a lot of my job when I'm not flying around the world hosting fancy cocktail parties is doing concept design for features for products and services.

8
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:57,980
Speaker 1: So I'll draw a picture of, like, this is the feature we should have in this thing, and it'll graph data like this, or it'll let someone do this, and I'll mock up, like, here's the functional design, and here's the widgets people could click on, and vague things like scale these graphs according to whatever.

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:08,407
Speaker 1: You know, not a mock-up like the final development specification that someone who knows nothing about the thing itself could write, but like the.

10
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,739
Speaker 1: here's enough for a smart person to write this code, and it'll do pretty much what I want it to.

11
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:21,718
Speaker 1: And what I've discovered over the years is that fucking nobody ever reads those documents.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:22,640
Speaker 1: Ever.

13
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:27,580
Speaker 1: I recently sent one of those documents to someone who had asked me for this feature thing.

14
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,704
Speaker 1: I was like, how about this?

15
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:32,460
Speaker 1: Does this do what the customer is asking for?

16
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,217
Speaker 1: And the response I got back immediately was a question.

17
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:37,908
Speaker 1: that said, can you see them by message type?

18
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:41,180
Speaker 1: And I was like, that's in the picture that I showed you.

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,939
Speaker 1: It's also in the footnote of that picture, and it's in the actual paragraph that explains what the thing does.

20
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,140
Speaker 1: Do you have any more questions?

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,000
Speaker 1: And without skipping a beat, he proceeded to ask me another question to which the answer was the same.

22
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:00,400
Speaker 1: I don't know how software gets made.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,380
Speaker 0: You should have said, please read my document before asking any more questions.

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,080
Speaker 0: I will not answer any questions until you have finished reading all the documents that I have sent you.

25
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,886
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have attempted that.

26
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:10,572
Speaker 1: You know what happens?

27
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:11,540
Speaker 1: Radio silence.

28
00:02:11,781 --> 00:02:16,300
Speaker 1: And then I just develop the thing in a vacuum followed by, hey, it doesn't do this thing we wanted.

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,980
Speaker 0: Well, then why didn't you read my document?

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the world.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,844
Speaker 0: Are you incompetent?

32
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:22,769
Speaker 1: Clearly.

33
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:23,915
Speaker 0: You're fired.

34
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:24,960
Speaker 0: I'm hiring someone competent.

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:32,200
Speaker 1: What I wonder is if it's different in larger companies or if it's just more Dilberti in larger companies.

36
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,720
Speaker 0: My company is less Dilberti.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,946
Speaker 1: I wonder if I was doing that same thing at Google.

38
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,957
Speaker 1: Would the people who care actually read my spec or would it be the same?

39
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,060
Speaker 1: I wonder.

40
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,210
Speaker 0: They tend to have a bunch of people work on something together.

41
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:46,380
Speaker 0: Not one person just tells someone else what to do.

42
00:02:47,081 --> 00:03:04,360
Speaker 1: From what I gather, I've been talking to a lot of them lately because they keep bothering me, there's an implication that at least in some of the divisions or in some of the products, there'll be one person who has the vision of what X should do and they kind of do the guiding principle document and then other people flesh it all in and work as a group.

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,740
Speaker 0: I think Google's plan is to get eventually to get all the tech people there ever were.

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Speaker 1: That are under the age of 35.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,660
Speaker 0: All the tech people, period, to work for it and then basically just hold the world hostage.

46
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,160
Speaker 0: As long as there are other tech people, they can't enact that plan.

47
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:20,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,679
Speaker 0: So I'm not working for them.

49
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:25,299
Speaker 1: I would work for them if they gave me the right stuff, but they'd have to give me the right stuff.

50
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,560
Speaker 0: I work for anyone who gives me the right stuff unless they want me to murder people or something.

51
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,400
Speaker 1: Depends what kind of people.

52
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,220
Speaker 0: Or be murdered.

53
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:37,400
Speaker 1: I don't think there's that many jobs that pay enough for you in the be murdered category.

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,237
Speaker 0: All military jobs?

55
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:40,148
Speaker 1: That's not be murdered.

56
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,800
Speaker 1: That's be in danger.

57
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,540
Speaker 0: That's very dangerous.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,186
Speaker 1: That's a very different job.

59
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:50,940
Speaker 1: The casualty rate for anything you would ever do for the military is probably lower than you being in a car.

60
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 0: I don't do anything that be dangerous, such as underwater welding or going to any country where people have guns.

61
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,548
Speaker 1: What's your threshold of danger?

62
00:03:58,568 --> 00:03:59,413
Speaker 1: Are you going to ride a bike?

63
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,600
Speaker 1: Are you going to drive in a car?

64
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,260
Speaker 0: Not really liking the car part.

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were just in a car not that long ago.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,660
Speaker 0: No, not much choice.

67
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,151
Speaker 1: And one of our friends went, "Oh, not much

68
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:09,595
Speaker 1: choice.".

69
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:13,892
Speaker 1: So yeah, you got any news?

70
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:14,356
Speaker 1: Monday?

71
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:14,800
Speaker 1: Tech day?

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,475
Speaker 0: Well, just giant Apple news today.

73
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:18,240
Speaker 0: It's Apple day.

74
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:24,840
Speaker 1: I'll be honest, I didn't notice it was Apple day because I don't actually use any Apple products anymore.

75
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's the worldwide developer conference.

76
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:32,240
Speaker 0: So they mostly announce all the things for developers, usually the software updates, the OS X and the iOS.

77
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,240
Speaker 0: The things that developers that don't actually work at Apple need to know.

78
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:41,439
Speaker 0: So there was a bunch of stuff, but none of it is really anything to talk about.

79
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:41,700
Speaker 0: a lot.

80
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,300
Speaker 0: Like OS X and iOS are converging in look and feel and features.

81
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,945
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait.

82
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,088
Speaker 1: What?

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:49,911
Speaker 1: Okay.

84
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:53,040
Speaker 1: I thought that already happened.

85
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaker 0: It's happening more than... It's gradual, so it's just more.

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:02,542
Speaker 1: Well, good luck with that because while they can probably pull it off better, there's... Well, I don't know.

87
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:19,740
Speaker 1: I don't know if the people who use Apple computers to do work will have the same adjustment issues that the people who use Windows have when suddenly the single screen touch interface converges with the multiple monitor keyboard and mouse interface.

88
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,624
Speaker 0: It's not like that.

89
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:24,100
Speaker 0: It's like they change the icons for the apps to be the same.

90
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:27,640
Speaker 0: And they change the style of the pull down menus to be the same.

91
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,735
Speaker 1: That's not even fucking news.

92
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:30,340
Speaker 0: Anyway.

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Speaker 1: Like even to a developer, it's like you don't even have to care about that.

94
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,380
Speaker 0: You can also wait till I finish saying all the things before you make comments.

95
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,194
Speaker 1: I know, but I'm just saying...

96
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,120
Speaker 0: Because you sound like a moron because you don't know the whole story.

97
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm looking through this whole list right now.

98
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:42,780
Speaker 1: I'm reading in parallel.

99
00:05:44,823 --> 00:05:58,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, the big important ones that actually mean something is number one, they made a new programming language called Swift, which is... Because Objective-C and C are basically really shitty to write iOS and OS X apps in.

100
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,240
Speaker 1: That is true.

101
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:07,300
Speaker 0: So instead of just letting everyone use some language they already knew, they made some new language that they're claiming is so awesome that no one knows anything about.

102
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:16,260
Speaker 0: So if you want to make money and you're a programmer, if you learn this language like today, you will be way ahead of everybody.

103
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,218
Speaker 1: That is true.

104
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:23,879
Speaker 0: And it's pretty much guaranteed to be a job getting thing to know, and there won't be a lot of other people who know it.

105
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,839
Speaker 0: You know what this will be like?

106
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:32,040
Speaker 0: If you start today writing apps in this language as like this second, go buy a Mac if you don't have one or install it, right?

107
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,020
Speaker 0: Install the developer Xcode, pay a hundred bucks to get the Apple developer account.

108
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,480
Speaker 0: Start learning Swift and become a Swift expert before anyone else.

109
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:48,900
Speaker 0: If you have good general programming skills, like I could do this, just start learning Swift, become a Swift expert, and that will probably be your career for the next decade at least.

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,180
Speaker 0: You know what it's very much like?

111
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:52,860
Speaker 0: You won't even have to actually program much in Swift.

112
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,020
Speaker 0: You'll have to write like two apps maybe, and then the rest of your job can be just teaching other people Swift and doing talks on it.

113
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:10,840
Speaker 1: Remember when Ruby came onto the horizon, and suddenly now there's a whole, like if you just know Ruby and aren't dumb, there's a million jobs at startups and web companies everywhere.

114
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,360
Speaker 1: Crappy jobs.

115
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,720
Speaker 1: They're not that bad.

116
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,700
Speaker 1: They're better than the average non-tech job.

117
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:28,680
Speaker 0: The big thing for me in terms of not really a developer feature, while developers have to know it so that they can work with it, right, is this really fancy shit they're doing when you combine an iOS device and a Mac together, right?

118
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,720
Speaker 0: Specifically an iPhone.

119
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:39,940
Speaker 0: So for example, they got a thing now where you can, first of all, the Apple Drive, the Google Drive competitor, iCloud, is now like super synced.

120
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:43,540
Speaker 0: So it's like you take a picture and boom, it's on the Mac and it's on the thing like instantly.

121
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,940
Speaker 0: I guess even more so than it was before.

122
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:55,239
Speaker 0: Like you can be like editing a photo on your iPhone, and then the photo will be being edited like in your photo viewer on your Mac, like while you're doing it, right?

123
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,180
Speaker 1: Yup, that's pretty chill.

124
00:07:56,964 --> 00:07:58,940
Speaker 0: You can, if you get a phone call, right?

125
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:01,520
Speaker 0: It's like your Mac will see that there's an iPhone nearby.

126
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:02,377
Speaker 0: You can connect it.

127
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,040
Speaker 0: Like you get a phone call, the thing will show up on your Mac.

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,559
Speaker 0: You can click no or yes, I'll pick up, and then it'll be on speakerphone on the Mac.

129
00:08:09,662 --> 00:08:11,200
Speaker 1: See, that is the one level.

130
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,420
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff that because of their conversions, Google cannot do.

131
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:15,958
Speaker 0: Right.

132
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:29,240
Speaker 0: It's like if you get SMS messages from people who don't have iMessage, right, because they don't have iPhones, and it hits your phone, but your phone is currently connected to your Mac, those messages will show up on the Mac in the iChat or iMessage program, right?

133
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,299
Speaker 0: Like basically, you know, it's like all your devices are going to be like one, you know, device basically, right?

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,039
Speaker 0: Even more so than pretty much any other combination of devices you can buy.

135
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:48,679
Speaker 1: I think I speak for everyone when I look forward to the divergent software implemented version of that that Google does a year down the road that half works and then they give up on.

136
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,320
Speaker 0: Sure.

137
00:08:50,724 --> 00:08:51,860
Speaker 0: You know, that's really interesting.

138
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,207
Speaker 0: And they're also.

139
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,920
Speaker 0: the other sort of somewhat big news is they're allowing.

140
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:59,300
Speaker 0: basically they opened up iOS a lot more than they did before.

141
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,820
Speaker 0: So like you can make custom keyboards now.

142
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,760
Speaker 0: So there's going to be swipe and all those things.

143
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,840
Speaker 0: And, you know, basically everything Android and other OSes, it's Apple's typical play, right?

144
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,080
Speaker 0: They don't invent anything.

145
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:12,619
Speaker 0: They just steal everything and act like they invented it.

146
00:09:12,984 --> 00:09:14,060
Speaker 0: It's like spaces.

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,999
Speaker 0: Virtual desktop is like 20 years old, guys.

148
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:16,492
Speaker 0: Spaces.

149
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:19,780
Speaker 0: You've never seen them before because you've never used Unix before.

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,318
Speaker 0: Normal people.

151
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:21,399
Speaker 0: We invented these, right?

152
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:32,739
Speaker 1: Even though, funnily, the more like the more advanced my personal computer workflows get, I need multiple desktops, less and less, unless I'm writing code like they're less and less useful in a world of.

153
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:34,680
Speaker 1: I've got three monitors on my desktop.

154
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, three monitors.

155
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,238
Speaker 0: Most people have one.

156
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:38,398
Speaker 0: But no.

157
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:39,945
Speaker 0: But so it's like all.

158
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:47,000
Speaker 0: they're adding all this stuff to iOS that Android and other OSes have had for a long time that they didn't have.

159
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,420
Speaker 0: For example, like in the notifications, there's notifications that you can interact with.

160
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,993
Speaker 0: It's like if I get a message and I look at my notification pull down and it says like message, I can push reply.

161
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:56,900
Speaker 0: right the fuck there.

162
00:09:58,021 --> 00:09:59,420
Speaker 0: Android has been doing that for a long time.

163
00:09:59,560 --> 00:09:59,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has.

164
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,079
Speaker 0: You can put widgets and shit.

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:02,939
Speaker 0: They haven't had widgets.

166
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,380
Speaker 1: All right.

167
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:11,559
Speaker 1: I still stand by the fact that the new look is one of the most milquetoast announcements in the history of Apple.

168
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:16,179
Speaker 1: Flat design, translucent panels, absence of gradients.

169
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:17,197
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

170
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,279
Speaker 1: Like that's those are the three headlines there.

171
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:20,032
Speaker 0: OK.

172
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,539
Speaker 1: Oh, new icons.

173
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:28,320
Speaker 0: Oh, and also, if you try to email someone an attachment, it'll upload your attachment to the cloud and send them an email with a link.

174
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,420
Speaker 0: So that way you don't have to worry about giant email attachments fucking you over.

175
00:10:31,869 --> 00:10:32,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

176
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,139
Speaker 1: Actually, Google Drive has been doing that pretty well for a while now.

177
00:10:35,849 --> 00:10:36,039
Speaker 0: Yeah.

178
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:36,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

179
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,380
Speaker 0: But, you know, you're the person you're mailing might not have Gmail.

180
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:45,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in that case, I just give them one of those semi secure.

181
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:48,679
Speaker 1: Anyone can click on this obscured link to get it thing.

182
00:10:49,720 --> 00:11:03,919
Speaker 0: The thing the other thing is interesting is so you can use Siri hands free, which I don't care about, but more importantly, when you do the searching where you just type things in, it actually does like a Siri search, just not with without the stupid talking part.

183
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:05,940
Speaker 1: That was a long time coming.

184
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,760
Speaker 0: You can get a really powerful search as opposed to just searching like the apps on your phone.

185
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:13,233
Speaker 0: You can actually search everything you know what Siri would do.

186
00:11:13,253 --> 00:11:14,580
Speaker 0: so I can just type into my phone.

187
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:15,220
Speaker 0: Right.

188
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,620
Speaker 0: Like on the search screen score the football game and it'll tell me as opposed to that.

189
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,800
Speaker 0: Used to be something I would have to either ask Siri or go to a website and Google.

190
00:11:23,988 --> 00:11:24,073
Speaker 1: True.

191
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:25,799
Speaker 1: But at the same time, what do I do?

192
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,620
Speaker 1: Google now just kind of pops up and tells me the score to every sport I care about for every team I care about.

193
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,359
Speaker 0: I have Google now also.

194
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:31,670
Speaker 1: Yeah.

195
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:33,299
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

196
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:34,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

197
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:36,100
Speaker 0: All right.

198
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,515
Speaker 0: That's about it.

199
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,033
Speaker 1: Yeah.

200
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,540
Speaker 1: I mean, just they didn't announce anything particularly exciting to anyone but developers.

201
00:11:41,282 --> 00:11:41,432
Speaker 0: Hmm.

202
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:43,280
Speaker 1: All this stuff is just nice.

203
00:11:43,341 --> 00:11:43,851
Speaker 0: Apple fanboys.

204
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:46,400
Speaker 0: Do they go crazy?

205
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:47,119
Speaker 1: I don't know.

206
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:49,300
Speaker 1: Even if I was a fanboy, I'd be hard to go crazy.

207
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,220
Speaker 1: This would be like if they were like we're releasing Evangelion like 11.11.11 and it's the same as episode one.

208
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,838
Speaker 0: You should read.

209
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Speaker 1: But we used a new cell shader algorithm on the old print to make it look better.

210
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:05,180
Speaker 0: So I'm linking to the Verge article because it's the best summary.

211
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:14,040
Speaker 0: But I was watching the Verge live blog, whatever, and the guy doing the live blog, he commented a fuck ton about the music they were playing.

212
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:23,779
Speaker 0: And then he commented a whole lot about how it bothered him that the icon for the weather app didn't actually have the live weather in it.

213
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,679
Speaker 0: He commented on that like a whole bunch of times.

214
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:33,639
Speaker 0: And then during the part where the guy was demoing the Swift programming language, he was pretty much just like, I have no idea what's going on.

215
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,040
Speaker 0: There's a wizard on stage, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

216
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,259
Speaker 0: And it's like, wow, this is journalism right here.

217
00:12:40,461 --> 00:12:44,020
Speaker 1: For the year 2014, me and play journalist.

218
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, Verge, you should maybe have someone at the developers conference.

219
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,379
Speaker 0: who knows something about development.

220
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,960
Speaker 1: May I make a modest proposal?

221
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,400
Speaker 1: They should do what sports does, have a color commentator and a developer commentator.

222
00:13:00,503 --> 00:13:02,600
Speaker 1: That way they can pass the puck back and forth.

223
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,031
Speaker 0: Sure.

224
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:03,880
Speaker 0: Anyway.

225
00:13:04,474 --> 00:13:04,720
Speaker 1: Anyway.

226
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:15,739
Speaker 1: So in other kind of more disturbing news for those of you aren't aware, true crypt, which is a pretty useful disk volume encryption system.

227
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:19,720
Speaker 0: You basically use it to encrypt your whole goddamn hard drive.

228
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:31,580
Speaker 1: Or to take a file that could basically just looks like random gibberish and have it somewhere and then you can mount it as a drive and see the data on any computer.

229
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,300
Speaker 0: It's like your whole C drive is encrypted.

230
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,860
Speaker 0: If someone just takes your computer from you, they can't read any files on it whatsoever.

231
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:43,580
Speaker 1: Or on your computer, there's a file that's called, I don't know, static audio dot wave.

232
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:49,020
Speaker 1: And if you open it in true crypt, it magically decrypts into all your pornography.

233
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,619
Speaker 0: It becomes the D drive and the D drive is full of dick.

234
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:52,334
Speaker 1: Yes.

235
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,479
Speaker 1: So, well, that's what the D drives for.

236
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:58,020
Speaker 1: That's where those drive letters came from, you realize.

237
00:13:58,162 --> 00:13:58,251
Speaker 0: Yeah.

238
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,539
Speaker 0: If someone comes and rips your hard drive out of your computer and puts it in another computer, it'll easily be worthless to them.

239
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,058
Speaker 0: They won't be able to do shit with it.

240
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:06,259
Speaker 1: It did other things too.

241
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:06,979
Speaker 0: It might as well be blank.

242
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:15,238
Speaker 1: True crypt, at least the use case wise, not talking about the backend technology, was really aimed around very practical hiding of data.

243
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,700
Speaker 1: So, for example, true crypt had the deniable encryption, where you could have an encrypted volume.

244
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,039
Speaker 1: There's a file block.

245
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:23,639
Speaker 1: It's 10 gigabytes, let's say.

246
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,660
Speaker 1: Statistical analysis of that block, in most cases, will show it as completely random data.

247
00:14:29,464 --> 00:14:32,840
Speaker 1: But if you type in the correct passkey, then you see the data.

248
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:39,819
Speaker 1: You could set it up with layers of deniable encryption, where if I type one password, you see a bunch of porn.

249
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:44,820
Speaker 1: If you type another password, you see my bomb making instructions.

250
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,231
Speaker 1: And there's no way to prove that either.

251
00:14:48,472 --> 00:14:50,138
Speaker 1: one is the "true

252
00:14:50,219 --> 00:14:50,580
Speaker 1: volume."

253
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:50,860
Speaker 1: Right.

254
00:14:51,281 --> 00:15:00,760
Speaker 0: You basically take a whole bunch of porn videos and a whole bunch of bomb making instructions and you put the dick on the D drive and you put the bombs on the B drive, but you put them both in the same package together.

255
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,511
Speaker 0: And then you'd be like, okay, the password for the porn is "dick" and the password for the bomb is

256
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:05,900
Speaker 0: "bomb.".

257
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:06,575
Speaker 0: Someone types in

258
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:06,780
Speaker 0: "dick.".

259
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:08,320
Speaker 0: All the dicks come out, but the bombs don't.

260
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,880
Speaker 1: So when the NSA or the FBI or the CIA or Mossad or MI6...

261
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,220
Speaker 0: They're like, what's your password, dick?

262
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:14,117
Speaker 0: All right.

263
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,879
Speaker 0: So they type it in.

264
00:15:15,126 --> 00:15:15,480
Speaker 0: Oh, it works.

265
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:16,720
Speaker 0: There's no way to know.

266
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,379
Speaker 0: And there's a bunch of dick.

267
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:19,820
Speaker 0: No, there are edge cases.

268
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,479
Speaker 0: It's legal, dick.

269
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:21,291
Speaker 0: It's all 18 plus.

270
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:27,180
Speaker 1: There are edge cases where you could statistically analyze it to figure stuff out.

271
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:55,599
Speaker 1: Like, for example, if you run a live boot disk or a volume inside of there in one of them, so you boot your computer into multiple different windowses, the fact that your bomb making instruction windows has changing metadata within the volume compared to other volumes, they could statistically be pretty sure that, yeah, you've got other sets of encrypted data you're not showing us, but they couldn't prove it.

272
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,319
Speaker 1: Anyway, we've talked about encryption and stuff before.

273
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:12,260
Speaker 1: The news would be, and the news that some people are trying to tell you is that TrueCrypt is being abandoned by its creators and they've recommended that you move on to BitLocker, which is the built-in Windows/Microsoft encryption volume system.

274
00:16:13,301 --> 00:16:23,860
Speaker 1: I do not know enough about BitLocker's technology to comment on its usability, its ability to replace this, its security, whether or not it has any weird back doors mandated by it.

275
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,313
Speaker 1: I don't know.

276
00:16:25,004 --> 00:16:25,359
Speaker 1: Don't know.

277
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,378
Speaker 1: No comment on that.

278
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,360
Speaker 1: Something fishy is up with the way TrueCrypt went down.

279
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,120
Speaker 1: It's a really weird situation.

280
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:47,920
Speaker 1: The web page for it, like, suddenly lost all its sort of style information and just put up this ghetto web page that just tells you how to migrate your existing TrueCrypt into BitLocker.

281
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:58,720
Speaker 1: They took down the old versions of TrueCrypt and the current version, 7.2, removed all the encryption capabilities and just gives you the ability to decrypt an existing volume.

282
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:06,929
Speaker 1: At the top of the page, they put up in red text, "Warning, using TrueCrypt is not secure as it may contain unfixed security

283
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:07,391
Speaker 1: issues.".

284
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:15,396
Speaker 1: Someone pointed out, but I think this is just funny and a coincidence, that it says, "Warning, TrueCrypt is," and then, "Not secure

285
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:15,640
Speaker 1: as.".

286
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,700
Speaker 1: The first letters of those three words is NSA.

287
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,799
Speaker 0: This would be a great practical joke.

288
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:22,537
Speaker 1: It would.

289
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,339
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

290
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:24,799
Speaker 1: This would be the best practical joke.

291
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,940
Speaker 1: But the signing certificates changed.

292
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:33,740
Speaker 1: A bunch of other stuff happened, and the developers have just disappeared from the earth.

293
00:17:33,901 --> 00:17:34,620
Speaker 1: They're not responding.

294
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:35,679
Speaker 1: No comments.

295
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:37,040
Speaker 1: No further discussion.

296
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,560
Speaker 1: Nothing.

297
00:17:39,762 --> 00:17:46,740
Speaker 1: As you know, Scott and I take a very dim view of conspiracy theories and lizard people in the John Birch Society.

298
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,760
Speaker 0: But this is lizard people?

299
00:17:48,746 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 1: Not saying this is lizard people.

300
00:17:50,423 --> 00:17:51,337
Speaker 0: It's just crab people?

301
00:17:51,881 --> 00:18:04,780
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that this has all the trappings of something, a concept you might not be familiar with, called the, there's a lot of terms for it, but basically it's the canary, or the cop canary.

302
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,320
Speaker 0: The bumble.

303
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, or the warrant canary.

304
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:14,037
Speaker 1: The idea that, say, I run a shady business where people buy and sell illegal goods at my home.

305
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:22,180
Speaker 1: And let's say that one day, the police come to me and say, "You're fucked, and we're going to stake you out to get some of your customers.

306
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:24,860
Speaker 1: If you say anything, we'll put you in jail forever.

307
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:30,156
Speaker 1: If you play along, we'll give you minor charges at the end of all this,".

308
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,140
Speaker 1: or immunity or whatever.

309
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,120
Speaker 1: So, I can't just go to my friends and be like, "Yo, dog, the FBI's here.

310
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,356
Speaker 1: Don't come and buy drugs from

311
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:36,477
Speaker 1: me.".

312
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:37,839
Speaker 1: That doesn't work.

313
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:46,219
Speaker 1: But what if I say, just, you know, I put out a classified ad somewhere saying, "The FBI has never visited this house.

314
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:47,838
Speaker 1: Here's the address.

315
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:49,600
Speaker 1: Have I committed a crime?

316
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,797
Speaker 1: Have I violated the terms of whatever deal I

317
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:54,179
Speaker 1: signed?".

318
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,539
Speaker 0: A judge would be the judge of that.

319
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:16,038
Speaker 1: So, it appears, in my sort of outside opinion, and in the opinions of a lot of very smart people, that whoever did this to the website is trying to burn the brand of TrueCrypt as hard as possible to prevent people from continuing to use it or trusting it.

320
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:29,760
Speaker 1: Especially in light of the fact that all analysis seems to point at the last stable version of TrueCrypt before this went down, which I believe is 7.1(a), as being still, as far as anyone can tell, perfectly secure.

321
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,680
Speaker 0: And it's open source, so people have looked through the code on this thing.

322
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,660
Speaker 0: It's not like there's a hidden back door, like there could be in some closed source thing.

323
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,979
Speaker 1: So, right now, everyone who gives a shit about encryption is pouring over that last code with a fine-tooth comb.

324
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone should just fork it and make a new project.

325
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,319
Speaker 1: They probably will.

326
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:49,300
Speaker 0: Like a little x386 to xorg situation.

327
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:55,000
Speaker 1: There are four options for what happened here, and I'm going to list them for you in order of likelihood in my opinion.

328
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:02,260
Speaker 1: Option one, the NSA sent these people one of their sealed security letters.

329
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,358
Speaker 0: And they were cowards.

330
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, like LavaBit.

331
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:19,459
Speaker 1: Honestly, if the NSA came to me and Scott right now and gave us the security letter, I might consider not divulging it to try to not get fucked by the system, at least until I could get out of the country.

332
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:23,680
Speaker 0: I would consider many options with the advice of lawyers.

333
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,920
Speaker 1: Yes, but some of these letters don't let you talk to lawyers.

334
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
Speaker 0: I talk to them anyway.

335
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,500
Speaker 0: The lawyers not going to, how do they know I talk to a lawyer?

336
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,899
Speaker 0: The lawyers has to be confidential too.

337
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,100
Speaker 1: NSA security letters are bullshit, but I digress.

338
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,840
Speaker 0: I talk to, I definitely wouldn't, there's no document anyone could hand me that I would not talk to a lawyer about.

339
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,663
Speaker 0: It is possible.

340
00:20:40,683 --> 00:20:44,857
Speaker 1: I would comply enough to not get fucked by people way more powerful than me.

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,256
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pretend that that would not be an option.

342
00:20:47,276 --> 00:20:47,860
Speaker 1: I would consider.

343
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,534
Speaker 1: I am not that invested in protecting the forum from the NSA.

344
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:54,320
Speaker 1: if they come for me, guys.

345
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,052
Speaker 1: I got backups.

346
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:04,580
Speaker 1: And as a result, the people involved complied, burned the brand and backed away.

347
00:21:05,502 --> 00:21:16,093
Speaker 1: Option two, there was an existing back door, someone tried to fix it or something happened and the NSA was like, no, no, no, you can't fix that.

348
00:21:16,374 --> 00:21:17,359
Speaker 1: and then they burned the brand.

349
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:28,160
Speaker 1: Option three, the developers are just weirdos and this is what they thought was a perfectly rational way to shut down the project.

350
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:40,240
Speaker 1: Option four, prank/someone compromised the site and the original owners have no way to uncompromise it due to their commitment to being semi-anonymous.

351
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,516
Speaker 1: Option five, lizard people.

352
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:44,360
Speaker 1: Option five is lizard people.

353
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,120
Speaker 1: So be wary and stay tuned.

354
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,380
Speaker 1: A lot of very smart people are doing a lot of analysis to figure out just what the fuck happened.

355
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Speaker 0: So if I want to encrypt my drives and I've never even thought about it before in my life and I don't have TrueCrypt installed or anything, I've got a bunch of unencrypted drives and no software to encrypt them, what should I do today?

356
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:06,199
Speaker 1: I don't know.

357
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:11,499
Speaker 1: If I was ultra paranoid, I would do things we're going to talk about in the second part of this episode.

358
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:16,380
Speaker 1: If I wasn't ultra paranoid, just use BitLocker for the time being.

359
00:22:17,422 --> 00:22:20,460
Speaker 0: I'm sure the Microsoft approved thing is completely safe from the government.

360
00:22:21,182 --> 00:22:28,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably safe for most use cases, but if it matters, you've got to do some due diligence research at this point.

361
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,419
Speaker 1: Just saying.

362
00:22:30,442 --> 00:22:32,759
Speaker 1: I'll cover this in depth once there's follow-ups, believe me.

363
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,039
Speaker 1: This is like NTP.

364
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,440
Speaker 1: This kind of thing is deeply in my wheelhouse and I will let you know as soon as I learn more.

365
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,660
Speaker 0: Are you using TrueCrypt?

366
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:40,238
Speaker 0: Yes.

367
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:40,939
Speaker 0: For what?

368
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:42,739
Speaker 1: Not much.

369
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,420
Speaker 1: I have multiple TrueCrypt volumes.

370
00:22:45,621 --> 00:22:54,339
Speaker 1: Most of them have inside of them the clear text passwords to a lot of things that I've accessed over the years that I might want to access again one day.

371
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:07,760
Speaker 1: Burner email accounts that I established years ago, servers in places with stuff, the passwords to every bank account ever, just all that kind of shit, just in case.

372
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,678
Speaker 1: You never know.

373
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:17,698
Speaker 1: Also, scans of my passport and my driver's licenses and my birth certificates and all the things I would need to prove who I am in case something ever really fucked me.

374
00:23:19,225 --> 00:23:20,200
Speaker 0: Or you could just lose those hard drives.

375
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:24,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, those encrypted volumes are in a lot of places.

376
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,178
Speaker 1: Because what?

377
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,178
Speaker 1: Someone finds them?

378
00:23:27,422 --> 00:23:27,740
Speaker 1: Okay.

379
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:28,580
Speaker 1: What are you going to do with it?

380
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,259
Speaker 1: It's fucking encrypted.

381
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:30,179
Speaker 0: Use the back door.

382
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there is a back door.

383
00:23:33,644 --> 00:23:35,940
Speaker 1: I hope you don't find my files if there's a back door.

384
00:23:36,921 --> 00:23:43,300
Speaker 1: If there isn't a back door, going to keep using the version of TrueCrypt that I used up until we figure out what the fuck happened to TrueCrypt.

385
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:43,977
Speaker 0: Okay.

386
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,150
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

387
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:55,230
Speaker 1: Scott's got a pretty typical thing of the day here.

388
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,650
Speaker 1: People like to make logic gates.

389
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:00,150
Speaker 0: Using mechanical things, which is the first way logic gates were ever made.

390
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:00,506
Speaker 0: Yep.

391
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,930
Speaker 0: So it's not a surprise.

392
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:08,090
Speaker 0: But he did it using strings and pulleys and little rings and it's really cool.

393
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,730
Speaker 0: I'd never even thought of this before.

394
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:16,130
Speaker 1: It kind of really illustrates the increasing complexity of certain kinds of logic gates in terms of just like what they're doing.

395
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,560
Speaker 0: Yep.

396
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:21,110
Speaker 0: And notice how NAND is like the simplest one that's complex in any way.

397
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,330
Speaker 1: That's why you can buy chips that are tiny that have like 400 NAND gates just in them.

398
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's why, you know, your CPU is mostly NAND gates.

399
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,910
Speaker 1: Well, the other reason is you can derive all other gates from combinations of NAND gates.

400
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:35,770
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, you don't need to make an AND gate.

401
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:38,390
Speaker 0: You can just stick a few NAND gates together and make an AND gate.

402
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:38,987
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh.

403
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:48,190
Speaker 1: That was the only interesting class I took in IT my freshman year was we had to, it was like circuits and design and logic and hardware and engineering and all that.

404
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,629
Speaker 1: So it was all about like signal processing.

405
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:57,989
Speaker 0: So if you care about the stuff we talked in like the earliest of early Geek Nights Monday episodes about how computers actually work, here's a very good video to help you understand that even better.

406
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:08,710
Speaker 1: Though if you're trying to learn logic gates, to be perfectly blunt, the the water flowing through pipes with physical gates method is probably a better analogy.

407
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,286
Speaker 0: Sure.

408
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,228
Speaker 1: This is just cool.

409
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,330
Speaker 1: So this is just a video.

410
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,450
Speaker 1: So it looks like some guys put together and it's actually pretty entertaining.

411
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:26,850
Speaker 1: They try to figure out what the tallest physical vertical straw as in a straw you drink through could actually be used by a human.

412
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,930
Speaker 1: Like, could a human drink from this straw?

413
00:25:30,313 --> 00:25:31,528
Speaker 1: How tall could it be?

414
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:41,089
Speaker 1: And it's fun because while you could calculate the you know, I mean, it's a well-known number, the maximum height that any siphon pump could work at.

415
00:25:41,513 --> 00:25:42,989
Speaker 1: If it's working based on vacuum.

416
00:25:43,951 --> 00:25:44,909
Speaker 1: And other things like that.

417
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,629
Speaker 1: But this one.

418
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:46,630
Speaker 0: You can go less than vacuum.

419
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,708
Speaker 1: This one has.

420
00:25:51,476 --> 00:25:53,530
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if I use gravitational forces.

421
00:25:54,111 --> 00:25:56,210
Speaker 0: Now, you had to increase the pressure at the other end, right?

422
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:02,750
Speaker 0: So if you do this experiment, say at sea level, you're probably going to get a lot higher than if you did it, say, at Mile House Stadium in Colorado.

423
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:10,190
Speaker 1: Well, the interesting factor here is that they actually have people trying to drink from these straws and it's very well produced.

424
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,630
Speaker 1: So I highly recommend you watch this.

425
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,249
Speaker 1: It's really funny.

426
00:26:13,474 --> 00:26:14,048
Speaker 0: They didn't use it.

427
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:17,650
Speaker 0: See, the thing is the guy just tried to drink from the straw and then he stops and he can't go any further.

428
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,809
Speaker 0: What I would do is I would pinch the straw shut with my hand.

429
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,969
Speaker 0: To basically hold the vacuum in there to keep the liquid up.

430
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,429
Speaker 0: Take a breather and then go back to it.

431
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,170
Speaker 1: I think he could not generate more force.

432
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:29,752
Speaker 0: And I could.

433
00:26:29,873 --> 00:26:33,070
Speaker 0: I could suck even more air out of there and get the liquid.

434
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:34,189
Speaker 0: Maybe.

435
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

436
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,890
Speaker 0: I mean, once you have a vacuum, you have a vacuum.

437
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:37,182
Speaker 0: Right.

438
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:41,590
Speaker 0: I'm sure there was at least some air left in that straw that could have been sucked.

439
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,330
Speaker 1: Well, let's have a straw sucking competition.

440
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:45,980
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

441
00:26:47,215 --> 00:26:49,270
Speaker 0: Who sucks the most and the hardest and the longest?

442
00:26:51,583 --> 00:26:51,910
Speaker 1: You know what?

443
00:26:52,435 --> 00:26:52,790
Speaker 1: I concede.

444
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,207
Speaker 1: You win.

445
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,248
Speaker 1: You suck the most.

446
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,130
Speaker 0: I'm the best at sucking.

447
00:26:57,191 --> 00:26:59,890
Speaker 1: So in a moment, the Book Club book is I Canticle for Liebowitz.

448
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:06,790
Speaker 1: It's basically the precursor book to all the types of apocalypse, post apocalypse books we've been reading recently.

449
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:09,830
Speaker 0: And I don't think I have to read anymore because it's just sort of seal the deal.

450
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:10,243
Speaker 0: Yeah.

451
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,989
Speaker 1: Watch our YouTube join our forum.

452
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,110
Speaker 1: Seriously, join our forum and post in it.

453
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:22,330
Speaker 1: I see a lot of you in the forum, but since we've debated out a lot of the serious issues, most of you are lurking.

454
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:23,028
Speaker 1: Post.

455
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:23,667
Speaker 0: Say hi.

456
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,049
Speaker 0: Just talk about whatever is nerdy right now.

457
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:27,769
Speaker 1: Start up an old argument again.

458
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:37,149
Speaker 1: And more importantly, a lot of women are in the forum lurking, but very few of you are posting.

459
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:39,090
Speaker 1: Just pointing that out.

460
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,010
Speaker 1: I've noticed that in the last couple of months.

461
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,710
Speaker 0: Also go to all the other places that we have for communicating.

462
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,570
Speaker 0: Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus.

463
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,650
Speaker 0: We have a newsletter that I've actually been sending again because I set up a reminder.

464
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:51,670
Speaker 0: It's a really good newsletter.

465
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,300
Speaker 1: Connecticut is July 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th.

466
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,088
Speaker 1: It's going to be fucking awesome and most of the schedule is up.

467
00:27:58,152 --> 00:27:59,470
Speaker 0: Beat that every other con ever.

468
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:00,385
Speaker 1: God.

469
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:08,186
Speaker 1: After some changes that happened internally, I'm pretty confident that next year the panels and workshop schedule is going to be up by March.

470
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:13,966
Speaker 0: If you want to be part of Connecticut, you had to be really dedicated and get on that shit early.

471
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,289
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of you submitted early, but due to other issues, we couldn't schedule early.

472
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,030
Speaker 0: I think the cosplay deadline for Connecticut is in a week or something like that.

473
00:28:22,272 --> 00:28:23,189
Speaker 0: It's really fucking soon.

474
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:23,710
Speaker 0: Yeah.

475
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,830
Speaker 1: Take that every other con.

476
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:26,250
Speaker 1: Oh, it's in Hartford, Connecticut.

477
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:27,969
Speaker 0: That's the only problem with it.

478
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,810
Speaker 1: Don't fly across the Atlantic Ocean to come to Connecticut.

479
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:39,789
Speaker 0: If you can drive to Connecticut in one day and get there in time after you wake up in the morning and you're a nerd, you should be there.

480
00:28:40,793 --> 00:28:44,150
Speaker 1: If you live within one day's drive period, like six, seven hours.

481
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,790
Speaker 0: And you don't have another more important plan.

482
00:28:47,112 --> 00:28:47,219
Speaker 1: Yeah.

483
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:48,550
Speaker 1: Most things are now more important.

484
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,068
Speaker 1: I mean, a wedding.

485
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,209
Speaker 0: There are very few things that are more important, but there are some.

486
00:28:52,879 --> 00:28:53,469
Speaker 1: State level.

487
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,390
Speaker 0: I would, I would miss a Connecticut.

488
00:28:55,971 --> 00:28:56,405
Speaker 1: Probably not.

489
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,750
Speaker 0: I would miss a Connecticut if there were a pressing issue.

490
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:01,369
Speaker 1: I would miss it for PAX.

491
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:02,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

492
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,310
Speaker 0: Well, I'd miss pretty much any convention for a PAX.

493
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,327
Speaker 1: What about another PAX?

494
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,889
Speaker 0: What, there's two PAXs at the same time?

495
00:29:09,032 --> 00:29:09,118
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,710
Speaker 1: Well, I have a president's order.

497
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,429
Speaker 1: PAX Prime trumps all other PAXs.

498
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:12,930
Speaker 0: Of course.

499
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:17,170
Speaker 1: So between PAX South and PAX East, might pick PAX South.

500
00:29:17,392 --> 00:29:17,709
Speaker 0: I don't know.

501
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,149
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about PAX South yet.

502
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,810
Speaker 1: But Boston is increasingly disagreeable to me when it comes to PAX East.

503
00:29:23,171 --> 00:29:23,530
Speaker 0: That's true.

504
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:24,270
Speaker 1: PAX is awesome.

505
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:25,468
Speaker 1: Boston, not so much.

506
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,490
Speaker 0: PAX South is much warmer with the weather.

507
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,888
Speaker 1: So the old days, we're talking pre x86.

508
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:35,350
Speaker 1: There were other kinds of computers that people had.

509
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,569
Speaker 0: Even x86 is pretty old.

510
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:38,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll talk about those.

511
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,298
Speaker 0: Even 486 is old.

512
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:46,082
Speaker 1: Well, we have to talk about those because while you had an Apple IIgs, the first computer I owned was actually a 486s.

513
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,710
Speaker 0: I didn't get that Apple IIgs until I was in high school.

514
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:51,608
Speaker 1: Yeah.

515
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,730
Speaker 1: In high school, I got a 486 and then later we got a Pentium Pro.

516
00:29:56,433 --> 00:29:58,130
Speaker 1: And before that, we didn't own a computer.

517
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:08,653
Speaker 1: So I used some Apples and some Amigas and some IBM PCs in school, but I never owned one until that 486.

518
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:09,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much the same deal.

519
00:30:10,271 --> 00:30:17,221
Speaker 0: We didn't own, you know, we didn't buy, I mean, my cousins had Commodore 64s, but we didn't have a, you know, general purpose computer.

520
00:30:17,241 --> 00:30:21,631
Speaker 0: that wasn't an Atari or an NES or anything until we had a 486.

521
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:25,749
Speaker 1: So I'm going to get this out right before we talk about nostalgia and all that, because I referenced this at the beginning of the show.

522
00:30:27,012 --> 00:30:31,410
Speaker 1: There are two primary uses for that old technology today.

523
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:34,409
Speaker 1: Three uses.

524
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:35,649
Speaker 1: Primary use.

525
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:42,410
Speaker 1: Use number one, showing people what old computing was like being in a museum, historical research.

526
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:42,910
Speaker 0: Sure.

527
00:30:43,334 --> 00:30:45,170
Speaker 1: That is the most important use of that technology.

528
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,910
Speaker 0: Every object created by man can have that purpose.

529
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,310
Speaker 0: So that is pointless to say about any object ever created by man.

530
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,150
Speaker 1: I think it's worth noting because people seem to forget about those things and then pieces of technology disappear due to no one bothering until it's too late.

531
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,146
Speaker 1: Okay.

532
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:01,189
Speaker 1: Number two, and also, you know what?

533
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:08,869
Speaker 1: That's useful to like, if you have a kid and they're complaining about their current computer, whip out your Apple II and be like, listen, fucker.

534
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:11,429
Speaker 1: This is what I grew up with, so you shut up.

535
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:12,568
Speaker 0: How does it work?

536
00:31:12,853 --> 00:31:13,830
Speaker 0: They try to touch the screen.

537
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,489
Speaker 1: Tell you what, if you figure it out, I'm giving you your real computer back.

538
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,849
Speaker 1: Show me Frogger running on this and then we'll talk.

539
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,348
Speaker 1: Option two, use number two.

540
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,949
Speaker 1: Hack them to do crazy fucking shit.

541
00:31:27,033 --> 00:31:28,470
Speaker 1: Use them with modern technology.

542
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,249
Speaker 1: Get a CD-ROM to work on an Apple II.

543
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,530
Speaker 1: Connect an old Amiga to the internet and then play a flash game.

544
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,070
Speaker 0: There are a lot of ways to connect, you know, relatively old computers to modern technology.

545
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:55,710
Speaker 0: My favorite one is a lot of old computers for like drives would use cassette tapes and the way that would work is you take cassette tape and you'd rewind it and press play and the audio on the cassette tape would basically be zeros and ones and it would work just like a modem.

546
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:56,459
Speaker 0: A modem went...

547
00:31:57,212 --> 00:31:59,630
Speaker 1: You could save Atari games and stuff to cassettes.

548
00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:00,205
Speaker 0: Right.

549
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:04,928
Speaker 0: So, well, you can, the thing is, okay, so you take that, right?

550
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,150
Speaker 0: You basically have a recording of what a modem sounded like.

551
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,750
Speaker 0: That audio is turned into zeros and ones.

552
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:15,170
Speaker 0: It goes over this cable into the computer and the computer loads all that noise.

553
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,450
Speaker 0: It takes as long as it takes the cassette to play.

554
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,329
Speaker 0: Usually it would play the cassette at a faster speed.

555
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:19,830
Speaker 0: Right.

556
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:27,030
Speaker 0: But it just basically take all the audio data from the cassette, put it into RAM, then point the program counter at the beginning of the data and run it.

557
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,850
Speaker 0: And that's a program that got loaded into memory.

558
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:29,230
Speaker 0: Right.

559
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:29,743
Speaker 1: Yep.

560
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:33,010
Speaker 0: What you can do nowadays is you don't need a cassette.

561
00:32:33,171 --> 00:32:33,743
Speaker 0: You can just have an MP3.

562
00:32:35,432 --> 00:32:37,390
Speaker 0: And an MP3 can be loaded from the internet.

563
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:37,784
Speaker 0: Yeah.

564
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:38,727
Speaker 0: On your phone.

565
00:32:39,171 --> 00:32:50,142
Speaker 0: So I can actually take my Apple 2GS, take a little cable out the top of my iPhone, plug it into the back of the Apple 2GS, go to a website, go to my Apple 2GS and type loader, whatever the command is.

566
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:56,649
Speaker 0: On that website, there'll be a, you know, a built in audio file player press like SoundCloud or something.

567
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:59,170
Speaker 0: I go to SoundCloud on my phone, press play.

568
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:01,425
Speaker 0: And that wave file that's playing is right.

569
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:07,107
Speaker 0: And then I'm basically downloading a program from the internet into the Apple 2GS and then running it.

570
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,348
Speaker 1: Not so much.

571
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:08,705
Speaker 1: Cool.

572
00:33:10,096 --> 00:33:10,669
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

573
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,203
Speaker 1: Yeah.

574
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,241
Speaker 1: And I think that's where most people are interested in.

575
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:17,959
Speaker 1: this old technology is like taking an Apple 2 and just doing something crazy with like.

576
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:20,250
Speaker 1: the demo scene is really into that still.

577
00:33:21,214 --> 00:33:22,850
Speaker 0: Are there still people in the demo scene?

578
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,590
Speaker 1: The demo scene has not died.

579
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,650
Speaker 1: The demo scene is kicking in strong.

580
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,229
Speaker 1: That's something we need to bring to a PAX.

581
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:30,329
Speaker 0: Well there's a thrice.

582
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,669
Speaker 0: Or a Kineticon.

583
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:33,729
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

584
00:33:34,354 --> 00:33:36,850
Speaker 1: Any of you out there, if you're into the modern demo scene.

585
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,149
Speaker 0: Or know any demo scene peeps.

586
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:43,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously, email me because I will get you into Kineticon either this year.

587
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,350
Speaker 0: I don't know if they want to go to Kineticon.

588
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:48,630
Speaker 1: Do you want like a dedicated place to demo this stuff to people?

589
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:49,910
Speaker 1: I will make that happen.

590
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,267
Speaker 1: Jesus.

591
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,990
Speaker 1: Computing technology is the thing we lack the most at Kineticon right now in terms of our wide range of contents.

592
00:33:57,472 --> 00:33:57,730
Speaker 0: Probably.

593
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,045
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:33:58,452 --> 00:33:59,390
Speaker 1: And that would be fucking awesome.

595
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:03,830
Speaker 1: And I'm sure the overlap with the OC Remix people would be high.

596
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:13,110
Speaker 0: I think the thing with the old computers, right, is if you want to do something cool with an old computer, you can probably do a similar thing with a modern but basic computer.

597
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:19,268
Speaker 0: Like if you have an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, why would you do it with an Apple IIGS other than for the style factor?

598
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:20,630
Speaker 1: About the style factor.

599
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:21,889
Speaker 0: That's the only factor, right?

600
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:29,969
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, your modern computers, you know, don't really have a lot of connectors on them that can be used to do things, right?

601
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,889
Speaker 0: Like a USB, it's kind of hard to interface with the USB.

602
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,456
Speaker 0: That's why you need like an Arduino where you can, you know, and all you do is use the USB to flash the Arduino.

603
00:34:37,476 --> 00:34:40,770
Speaker 0: and the Arduino interacts with the real world with more basic circuitry.

604
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,710
Speaker 0: An Apple IIGS, you can just hook shit right up to it.

605
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,989
Speaker 0: You don't need an Arduino in between.

606
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,909
Speaker 1: And that stuff went all the way through to the, like the, until the serial and parallel ports died.

607
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:57,910
Speaker 1: I mean, even my 486, it came with this huge manual that was just voltages and pin outs and information for all the weird fucking ports in the back.

608
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:58,490
Speaker 1: And you know what?

609
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:04,610
Speaker 1: I just plugged things in with wires and plug those wires into things and you could do stuff.

610
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,969
Speaker 1: You could send arbitrary data over those pins.

611
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:26,530
Speaker 0: Well, the other major thing about most, you know, the original PCs, right, up until, I guess, DOS, everything pre-DOS, even DOS came with basic, but like Commodores, Apple IIGS, Amigas, all those sorts of computers, when you turn them on, it was just, you didn't, I mean, there wasn't even a command line, like a shell, like DOS.

612
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,950
Speaker 0: It's just the basic interpreter was just right fucking there.

613
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,009
Speaker 0: And you were programming right from the get go.

614
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:38,410
Speaker 0: Whereas on a modern computer, you need to install like a development environment to do any sort of programming stuff.

615
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,608
Speaker 0: It's like the whole setup thing.

616
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:49,069
Speaker 0: And I think that is like the key reason that, you know, programming is less accessible to people is because it's not in their face as it was in the olden days.

617
00:35:49,652 --> 00:36:00,190
Speaker 0: You know, even people today with like Macs will learn like some Bash shell stuff because there might open terminal once in a while, but they don't learn to program shit unless they want to learn to program shit and go out of their way to learn to program shit.

618
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:16,147
Speaker 1: Now, maybe that's a secondary use from showing people stuff in that make it, getting someone, if someone really wants to learn technology, taking one of these old computers and giving them a task to accomplish with that computer, I think might be a great teaching tool.

619
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:26,350
Speaker 1: because I learn more about computers, trying to figure out how to make games work on my computer that I learned from decade of schooling and a decade of working in the industry.

620
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much just I wanted to make SimCity work.

621
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,849
Speaker 1: Wouldn't fucking work.

622
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,749
Speaker 1: I learned about memory management.

623
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,430
Speaker 1: I learned about bootloaders.

624
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,990
Speaker 0: I learned about boot disk partitioning.

625
00:36:37,551 --> 00:36:40,610
Speaker 1: I learned about the differences between extended and expanded memory.

626
00:36:42,153 --> 00:36:44,530
Speaker 1: I wanted to make my modems connect to play Doom.

627
00:36:45,153 --> 00:36:46,230
Speaker 1: I learned about null modems.

628
00:36:46,352 --> 00:36:47,329
Speaker 1: I learned how modems worked.

629
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,629
Speaker 0: I learned about modem commands, serial cables versus parallel cable.

630
00:36:51,032 --> 00:36:51,230
Speaker 1: Yup.

631
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:56,730
Speaker 1: Everything I know about computers dates back to the fact that computers were complicated,

632
00:36:57,451 --> 00:36:57,732
Speaker 0: but

633
00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:14,844
Speaker 1: they were deterministic in a way that I don't want to say modern computers aren't deterministic, but they are to do an uninformed user, especially because software is so complex that a lot of software will effectively not act in a consistent manner when you try to use it.

634
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:21,729
Speaker 1: So as a result, you can't learn as well about the underlying technology trying to interact with modern software on top of it.

635
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:24,350
Speaker 1: Did word crash because of a bug?

636
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,370
Speaker 1: Because of hardware?

637
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,550
Speaker 1: Why did it crash?

638
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:32,830
Speaker 0: It's like if you're trying to learn board games and the first board game anyone tries to teach you is like Twilight Struggle.

639
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,968
Speaker 0: It's like that shit ain't gonna happen.

640
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,810
Speaker 1: But if it does, you'll learn Twilight Struggle, but you won't learn board games.

641
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:48,109
Speaker 0: It's like you gotta learn something simpler first, like maybe a backgammon or something where you can learn basic mechanics like this is how die rolling works, this is how moving pieces works.

642
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,910
Speaker 0: Okay, you've learned two things, rolling dice and moving pieces.

643
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,625
Speaker 0: Let's now move on to a game that has those things.

644
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:54,410
Speaker 0: and a third thing.

645
00:37:55,131 --> 00:38:04,930
Speaker 0: The oldest computers only have a very few things, so you can learn a lot about computers in general with a very crappy computer that doesn't do anything really nowadays.

646
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,750
Speaker 0: Whereas if you use a modern computer, all you can do with those is learn how to use a modern computer.

647
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:17,230
Speaker 0: You can't learn anything about computers because it's way too complex and all that stuff is hidden beneath many, many layers of extraction.

648
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,890
Speaker 0: So, what was the, uh, what kind of old computer?

649
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:21,570
Speaker 1: Pause for a second.

650
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,209
Speaker 0: Oh, you paused?

651
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,850
Speaker 0: Why'd you pause?

652
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,730
Speaker 1: And in a stroke of ridiculous irony, Audition, which we used to record Geek Nights.

653
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:30,830
Speaker 0: Our extremely modern and expensive software.

654
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:36,030
Speaker 1: Just did something really weird and we had to stop recording to show because like it, all the waveforms disappeared.

655
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,770
Speaker 1: It just flipped out and I had to restart it.

656
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,370
Speaker 0: If we're using a trusty old Commodore, this wouldn't have happened.

657
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably not.

658
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,689
Speaker 1: It would have crashed because it ran out of memory or something.

659
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,266
Speaker 1: Or because I unplugged it.

660
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,990
Speaker 1: Or because there was a bug in the software, but then the bug in the software would be trivial to diagnose.

661
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,930
Speaker 1: But, uh, I think there is a use.

662
00:38:53,190 --> 00:39:10,049
Speaker 1: If I was in charge of like a high school computer program, day one, everyone would get like an Apple 2GS and they would basically have to, over the first half of the course, learn how to use that thing to do everything they wanted to do and they'd have to use it to do their assignments in other classes.

663
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:13,630
Speaker 1: And then in the second half of the year, they get a real computer.

664
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,220
Speaker 0: You gotta upgrade him.

665
00:39:16,281 --> 00:39:16,829
Speaker 0: DOS next.

666
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,710
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, take him through all the stages.

667
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,558
Speaker 0: All the stages.

668
00:39:19,964 --> 00:39:20,329
Speaker 0: Up and up.

669
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:24,290
Speaker 0: So what kind of old computers did you actually use in your life?

670
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:35,050
Speaker 1: I actually used various IBM PCs, but my memories are so vague because this was like first, second grade that I cannot for the life of me tell you what like XT, whatever they were.

671
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:38,210
Speaker 1: But we never used the computers raw.

672
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:49,170
Speaker 1: All we would ever do is you go to like a computer lab and they'd have some software already running that would like ask you questions or make you learn how to type or something really stupid.

673
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:52,450
Speaker 1: And I didn't learn anything about computers from that.

674
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,510
Speaker 0: So pretty much only in school?

675
00:39:54,090 --> 00:40:03,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, not until I joined in middle school because in elementary school we got the, I typed essays in like fourth and fifth grade.

676
00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:08,672
Speaker 1: And then in sixth grade we got the four 86.

677
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:10,890
Speaker 1: That was when I started using computers hardcore.

678
00:40:11,392 --> 00:40:14,187
Speaker 1: And the first things I did was install games that four 86 SX.

679
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,948
Speaker 1: The second thing I did was realize that we fucked up buying the SX.

680
00:40:18,472 --> 00:40:19,310
Speaker 1: We should have gotten the DX.

681
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,547
Speaker 1: It wasn't that much more money.

682
00:40:22,651 --> 00:40:22,892
Speaker 0: Yeah.

683
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:27,910
Speaker 0: So I actually, the first time I used a computer was an Apple two E in kindergarten.

684
00:40:29,171 --> 00:40:33,999
Speaker 0: And so of course we started out just like put in the word munchers floppy and turn it on.

685
00:40:34,163 --> 00:40:34,410
Speaker 0: Right.

686
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,610
Speaker 0: But within a few minutes I found the debug menu for word munchers and that was that.

687
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:47,430
Speaker 0: Um, you know, pretty much every classroom in elementary school had an Apple two at least of some kind, EGS something.

688
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,589
Speaker 0: And I would use it whenever I was permitted to do so.

689
00:40:51,132 --> 00:40:53,410
Speaker 0: And I just messed all around with it as much as possible.

690
00:40:54,073 --> 00:41:02,609
Speaker 0: And like I even went to summer camp and well, there was like a crappy summer camp I went to, which is basically go to one of the elementary schools in town for half a day every day in the summer.

691
00:41:03,472 --> 00:41:05,030
Speaker 0: And you could choose two activities.

692
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:11,769
Speaker 0: So I always chose generic sporting activity for half of that time and sit in the computer room for the other half of that.

693
00:41:12,332 --> 00:41:15,589
Speaker 0: And you'd play Oregon trail and you'd program stuff.

694
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:19,070
Speaker 0: And we mostly, it started, it was just like logo moving the turtle around.

695
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did logo even, even in a middle school, we did logo and this is elementary school, right?

696
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,590
Speaker 0: And then the Mac started to coming out and then shit went crazy and we're doing Mac paint and all that nonsense.

697
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,110
Speaker 1: I really wanted a computer pretty much from kindergarten on.

698
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,130
Speaker 1: Like I knew what they were and we use them in school occasionally.

699
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,709
Speaker 0: You saw them on TV a lot.

700
00:41:38,015 --> 00:41:38,103
Speaker 1: Yup.

701
00:41:38,772 --> 00:41:39,830
Speaker 1: But couldn't really get one.

702
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:41,510
Speaker 1: I had my NES, which was enough.

703
00:41:42,371 --> 00:41:44,525
Speaker 0: Well, you could have one of those Atari computers, like an Atari 800 XL or something.

704
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I just had Atari gaming consoles.

705
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:50,530
Speaker 0: My cousins had Commodore 64s, which I used a few times.

706
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:55,941
Speaker 0: Some friends had them too, but they mostly use them like make music using the SID chip and whatnot.

707
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,469
Speaker 1: My uncle worked at IBM, so he had a, he had a computer at home.

708
00:41:59,890 --> 00:41:59,962
Speaker 1: Yup.

709
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:02,910
Speaker 1: I was always excited to look at it, but he wouldn't let me mess with it too much.

710
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:11,787
Speaker 0: Other people's houses that I went over mostly had early IBM's and we, you know, or like I go to my dad's office, he had like a 386 and he'd play some Wolfenstein, stuff like that.

711
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:12,040
Speaker 1: Yup.

712
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:25,610
Speaker 1: When I got the 486 and then I joined the computer club in quotes in middle school, the club was pretty much, if you had a computer or not, you could just stay in the school after hours for like four hours every Monday and just do whatever you wanted on the computers.

713
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,830
Speaker 1: And pretty much all we did was play scorched earth.

714
00:42:29,872 --> 00:42:32,708
Speaker 1: We just played scorched earth every day forever.

715
00:42:33,852 --> 00:42:39,689
Speaker 1: But we had the shareware version and we were desperately trying to figure out how to unlock it to get that multi-shot tank.

716
00:42:40,711 --> 00:42:43,690
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I went to a real summer camp where they taught programming also.

717
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:48,607
Speaker 0: It was nerd camp and I was doing like HTML, learn C there, learn Pascal.

718
00:42:50,331 --> 00:42:52,349
Speaker 0: We were writing games, stuff like that.

719
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:53,145
Speaker 1: I learned Q basic.

720
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,766
Speaker 1: Like someone told me, like someone in the Science Olympiad, an adult was like, you should learn basic.

721
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:06,290
Speaker 1: And then I found Q basic and then I wrote a bunch of applications that mostly did nothing useful and at best were really annoying to other people.

722
00:43:06,991 --> 00:43:17,209
Speaker 0: In high school we started a computer club and we basically collected all the old computer because that was about the time when Pentium ones were out, like maybe junior year, you know, Pentium twos even.

723
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:23,569
Speaker 0: And basically we went around collecting all the computers that no one else is using anymore in the school, like all the Apple twos and shit.

724
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:29,110
Speaker 0: And then we basically put them all together in this one sort of space and up top of the library that no one was using.

725
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:31,110
Speaker 0: And we made like an old school computer lab.

726
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,790
Speaker 0: And we were even like buying extra bits on eBay that they didn't have.

727
00:43:35,252 --> 00:43:37,650
Speaker 0: And that's that's where my Apple two GS and stuff that I have now.

728
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,608
Speaker 0: My Mac Pro, not Mac Pro, Mac Plus, one megabyte comes from those days.

729
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,830
Speaker 1: I remember carrying a single floppy disk around with me that had pretty much every file I cared about in the world.

730
00:43:48,090 --> 00:43:53,529
Speaker 0: I carried up until I got to RIT even, right, this plastic case that had a whole stack of floppies.

731
00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:00,990
Speaker 1: Well, I had a floppy that was just scorched earth and a couple other games because that one, like I'd leave in computers doing stuff.

732
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,350
Speaker 1: I had another one that was Stuntz 4D Racing.

733
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:05,690
Speaker 0: I had one that was my MUD client.

734
00:44:05,831 --> 00:44:16,668
Speaker 0: And that's another great example of even in the Pentium days, right, we had Windows 95, 98, and you really didn't have that low level sort of old computing experience to learn anything from.

735
00:44:17,432 --> 00:44:19,670
Speaker 0: I was doing more advanced stuff like doing MUDs.

736
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:27,470
Speaker 0: So I was learning all about networking and how the Internet works, trying to tell that into servers, knowing what ports were and firewalls and all that kind of stuff.

737
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,550
Speaker 1: I did my most fucking around with my modem.

738
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:29,936
Speaker 1: I had a 2600 baud modem.

739
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,775
Speaker 1: And what I do is I war dialed my neighborhood and I was looking for other modems and I was trying to get.

740
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:39,586
Speaker 1: basically any time I found another modem, I tried to connect to it and see what was there.

741
00:44:40,733 --> 00:44:42,869
Speaker 1: And I found a couple of local BBSs.

742
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:49,670
Speaker 1: I hit a lot of fax machines and people who seemed mad that a modem was calling them repeatedly.

743
00:44:51,792 --> 00:44:54,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't learn about modems like that kind of stuff.

744
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:02,317
Speaker 0: The only thing I did was I dialed into the local library in my town to check what books were there because they actually like had a card at the library that said how to do it.

745
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:02,713
Speaker 1: Oh.

746
00:45:03,553 --> 00:45:11,861
Speaker 0: I'd never thought about trying to, and I dialed friends to play command and conquer and stuff, but I never actually like realized you could dial into BBSs or anything like that.

747
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:15,989
Speaker 1: I remember that moment of revelation where me and this kid Brock were like, like he was the super nerd.

748
00:45:16,311 --> 00:45:17,230
Speaker 0: He had rock Pokemon.

749
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,850
Speaker 1: He had way more, this was before Pokemon.

750
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:28,030
Speaker 1: He had way more, he was like the stereotype of the nerdy computer kid in every way.

751
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:29,748
Speaker 1: But he was a cool guy, cool guy.

752
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:34,610
Speaker 1: And he had a modem, I had a modem and I was, and we both kind of knew how modems work.

753
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,110
Speaker 1: So we were like, we should be able to call each other and connect.

754
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:42,190
Speaker 1: We spent an entire weekend calling each other, trying to get our modems to connect.

755
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:45,390
Speaker 1: And that is when I learned fucking everything there was to know about modems.

756
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:50,210
Speaker 1: And then there was this moment on Sunday afternoon where it's not like you get to Google anything.

757
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:50,560
Speaker 1: Yep.

758
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:59,067
Speaker 1: We were reading the manuals to our computers, the back of my computer manual, this HP book that was like an inch thick, had a list of like modem commands, but some of them didn't work.

759
00:45:59,210 --> 00:45:59,787
Speaker 1: I didn't know why.

760
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:00,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

761
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,630
Speaker 0: Computers don't come with that shit anymore.

762
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,430
Speaker 1: It came out with like voltage diagrams of everything.

763
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,690
Speaker 0: I bought a copy of Borland turbo seat plus plus.

764
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:13,670
Speaker 0: I can had that for windows 3.1 and it came in this giant box.

765
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:15,630
Speaker 0: It was 90 bucks with so many.

766
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,050
Speaker 0: I still have those manuals somewhere.

767
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:25,150
Speaker 0: Giant, giant programming manuals for like the owl libraries, which will let you actually make windows 3.1 windows show up and stuff.

768
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:25,710
Speaker 0: Yeah.

769
00:46:25,771 --> 00:46:26,849
Speaker 1: That was, that was a big deal.

770
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,130
Speaker 0: Object windows library.

771
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,970
Speaker 1: The cool kids had Borland C plus plus.

772
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,770
Speaker 1: My parents wouldn't buy it for me cause it was expensive.

773
00:46:31,950 --> 00:46:32,367
Speaker 0: I bought it myself.

774
00:46:32,973 --> 00:46:33,067
Speaker 1: Yeah.

775
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,669
Speaker 1: I spent all my money on NES games.

776
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,089
Speaker 1: What'd you pay for that?

777
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,610
Speaker 1: This is way later.

778
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,886
Speaker 1: Yeah.

779
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:37,570
Speaker 1: What'd you pay for that?

780
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:38,330
Speaker 0: This is like middle school.

781
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:38,890
Speaker 0: 90 bucks.

782
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:39,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

783
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:39,630
Speaker 1: Middle school.

784
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:40,569
Speaker 1: So SNES games.

785
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:41,130
Speaker 0: Okay.

786
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:41,607
Speaker 1: Yeah.

787
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,690
Speaker 1: For 70 bucks I brought chrono trigger.

788
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:45,630
Speaker 1: That was way more important to me in my development.

789
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:46,728
Speaker 0: I had enough games.

790
00:46:47,255 --> 00:46:47,688
Speaker 1: I did not.

791
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:51,050
Speaker 0: I bought, I also bought mech warrior 2 and descent.

792
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:55,629
Speaker 1: I, but when we, I typed like, Hey, are you there?

793
00:46:56,531 --> 00:47:01,910
Speaker 1: And he saw what I typed and typed back at me and we saw it in each other's consoles.

794
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:09,208
Speaker 1: Like I saw the entire future blowing through my eyes and I knew what I was going to be when I grew up.

795
00:47:10,015 --> 00:47:11,230
Speaker 1: I was going to be a computer.

796
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,190
Speaker 0: You have success.

797
00:47:17,572 --> 00:47:22,150
Speaker 1: So there is a fourth use for this technology for the old crap.

798
00:47:22,551 --> 00:47:27,150
Speaker 0: It's funny how like we have to talk about the uses that these gold computers still have.

799
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:38,629
Speaker 0: because seriously, if you sit down at a computer, even a computer like a four 86, if it doesn't have internet, you really can't like modern internet with modern browsers and stuff like that.

800
00:47:39,131 --> 00:47:44,690
Speaker 0: It's really hard to find any reason to use spend any time using that computer short of playing an old game on it.

801
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:53,350
Speaker 1: But there was a time in my life when I would sit at a non network computer for four hours in a row and be enjoying, I was having the time of my life, but now it's unthinkable.

802
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:53,909
Speaker 0: It's like what?

803
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,429
Speaker 0: This is a useless piece of junk.

804
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:05,630
Speaker 1: So the fourth use is if you care a lot about encryption and privacy and security, don't use one of those computers.

805
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,589
Speaker 1: That's not what I'm saying.

806
00:48:07,691 --> 00:48:16,649
Speaker 1: Use it offline to generate your GPG keys because that is the only hardware you will ever get your hands on.

807
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:21,050
Speaker 1: That is pretty much guaranteed to not in any way be compromised.

808
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,789
Speaker 0: I should generate keys with my apple two GS.

809
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:25,271
Speaker 1: Yeah.

810
00:48:25,291 --> 00:48:28,110
Speaker 1: Then the only thing you have to trust is Scott and sell them.

811
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:29,149
Speaker 1: You have to trust Scott.

812
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,930
Speaker 0: No, you come over and we put a floppy disk and it generates the key and you walk out.

813
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,189
Speaker 1: They have to trust the software you're using to generate the key.

814
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:37,728
Speaker 0: I'll let them read it.

815
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:38,554
Speaker 0: Yep.

816
00:48:38,575 --> 00:48:40,310
Speaker 0: And then they can press run themselves.

817
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:48,928
Speaker 0: I'm dead serious because that hardware, I'll put the code on the internet, open source, then come to my house, download that software, put it into the apple two GS.

818
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:55,329
Speaker 1: The hardware in those old computers is effectively open source hardware for all intents and purposes.

819
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,690
Speaker 0: I mean, we talk about the apple two GS a lot.

820
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,450
Speaker 0: And the reason is because the apple two GS is, it's an apple two.

821
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:01,450
Speaker 0: It's not a Mac, right?

822
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:03,970
Speaker 0: The Mac was already out when the apple two GS came out.

823
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,350
Speaker 0: Uh, the apple two had existed for a long time.

824
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,998
Speaker 0: The apple one even longer, right?

825
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,730
Speaker 0: But, and I think the apple three was even out, but the apple two GS, the GS stands for graphics and sound.

826
00:49:14,232 --> 00:49:17,030
Speaker 0: It's an apple two, but the screen is much higher resolution.

827
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:19,105
Speaker 0: It's not, it's all colors, not just green.

828
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:19,810
Speaker 0: Right.

829
00:49:20,154 --> 00:49:21,369
Speaker 0: And the sound is really great.

830
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:26,190
Speaker 0: And if you, most of them have as Steve Wozniak's like signature inside of them.

831
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,088
Speaker 0: And you think about apple computers now, and they're known for like this beautiful design and whatnot.

832
00:49:31,169 --> 00:49:31,310
Speaker 0: Right.

833
00:49:31,692 --> 00:49:33,207
Speaker 0: But that's mostly in their software.

834
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:33,550
Speaker 0: Right.

835
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:38,819
Speaker 0: And the outside of their hardware, the inside of a Mac is, you know, in some ways a modern Mac.

836
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:43,690
Speaker 0: on the inside is beautifully designed, but really it's complicated as fuck because it's a modern computer, right?

837
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:51,686
Speaker 0: If you open an apple two GS, the inside of it compared to any other computer you're ever going to see is just miraculously beautiful.

838
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:53,517
Speaker 0: Like the, the power supply goes straight down.

839
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:57,209
Speaker 0: one side is all these identical slots lined up in a row.

840
00:49:57,731 --> 00:50:01,770
Speaker 0: Everything is perfectly labeled and laid out right in a logical way.

841
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:09,330
Speaker 0: And not, it looks like you think like, ah, if you were, you're, they sacrificed all this performance to, to line things up in a way that's really friendly.

842
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:14,010
Speaker 0: It's like the most user-friendly hardware desktop computer in the universe.

843
00:50:14,814 --> 00:50:14,975
Speaker 0: Right.

844
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:16,230
Speaker 0: It's just, it's like this miracle.

845
00:50:16,412 --> 00:50:23,208
Speaker 0: So like if you want to get an old computer, I recommend that computer pretty much above any computer else that's old anywhere.

846
00:50:25,131 --> 00:50:30,950
Speaker 1: And think of this because the hardware is so well documented with those old documented, there's so much software for it.

847
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,509
Speaker 0: You can get a hardware for it really easily.

848
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:41,010
Speaker 1: You could plug this thing that you're going to use to generate your GPG keys into a hardware, like reliable random number generator.

849
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:43,328
Speaker 0: There are so many things you can get for an apple two GS.

850
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,949
Speaker 0: Like people plug, put heart modern hard drives in them.

851
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,309
Speaker 0: People connect them to the internet and browse the web.

852
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:53,725
Speaker 0: People play Wolfenstein 3d on them, which came out in the nineties way after.

853
00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:57,245
Speaker 0: like this note, this computer has no right to run that software, but it does.

854
00:50:57,265 --> 00:50:57,365
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:50:58,312 --> 00:51:02,890
Speaker 0: It just, it's, you could, the favorite, the thing that I have is you basically have a novel, a serial cable.

856
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,800
Speaker 0: So it goes USB on my real computer.

857
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:06,530
Speaker 0: Then there's like a connector.

858
00:51:07,112 --> 00:51:09,869
Speaker 0: And then it goes into the modem port on the apple two GS.

859
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:14,589
Speaker 0: I typed some commands in the apple two GS and I run some software on my computer.

860
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:23,410
Speaker 0: And the apple two GS now thinks that the files on my hard drive in my modern computer are basically like floppy disks that are loading on it.

861
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,475
Speaker 0: And it can, right.

862
00:51:24,555 --> 00:51:28,173
Speaker 0: And it's, it's, I think it's called ADB or ADP or something like that.

863
00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:30,870
Speaker 0: You can just search for it, like apple disc something.

864
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:32,980
Speaker 0: And it's pretty miraculous.

865
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:35,092
Speaker 0: The kind of stuff that you can do with that, right?

866
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:39,980
Speaker 0: Like I can write apple two software on my modern computer and loaded onto the real hardware and not use an emulator.

867
00:51:40,784 --> 00:51:42,813
Speaker 0: So it just very, very supported.

868
00:51:43,316 --> 00:51:50,530
Speaker 0: Commodore 64 is also very supported, but you know, they're a little more annoying to use a little less reliable, whatnot.

869
00:51:50,831 --> 00:51:56,482
Speaker 0: But Hey, uh, the Commodore 64 put a man on the moon, so it's not, it's not shabby.

870
00:51:59,672 --> 00:52:01,301
Speaker 1: We didn't even get into calculators.

871
00:52:01,341 --> 00:52:02,929
Speaker 1: I think we did a show on calculators though.

872
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,214
Speaker 0: Graphing calculators?

873
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:04,515
Speaker 0: Yeah.

874
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:06,365
Speaker 1: My TI 85 fuck your 86 and it's bullshit.

875
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:08,916
Speaker 0: My 86 is vastly superior.

876
00:52:09,077 --> 00:52:09,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

877
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:09,639
Speaker 1: The 85 had issues.

878
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,011
Speaker 0: Yeah.

879
00:52:13,252 --> 00:52:13,473
Speaker 0: Okay.

880
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,410
Speaker 1: But your expanded memory was way slow.

881
00:52:16,891 --> 00:52:19,610
Speaker 1: You had to load stuff in that tiny memory area if you wanted performance.

882
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:21,118
Speaker 0: I didn't need performance.

883
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:23,150
Speaker 1: I needed performance to play mostly games.

884
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:24,640
Speaker 0: Assembly program games.
