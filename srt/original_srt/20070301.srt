1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,817
Speaker 0: It's Thursday March 1st, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,807
Speaker 0: tonight We talk about the podcast we listen to as opposed to the podcast we used to listen to.

3
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:20,469
Speaker 1: let's do this.

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:22,959
Speaker 1: I Started a new job today.

5
00:00:24,261 --> 00:00:29,490
Speaker 0: So you know you can't just sit around the house lazing about doing nothing yet somehow still being tired every day.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I really wish now.

7
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:38,755
Speaker 1: You know while I was lazing around the house doing nothing I was kind of like you know.

8
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:42,160
Speaker 1: uh Wow, I just didn't say anything.

9
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,187
Speaker 1: How can you be tired?

10
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:46,780
Speaker 0: you had all this time to do nothing?

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in that time.

12
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:58,295
Speaker 1: I did nothing and I kind of felt bad for doing nothing and now that I'm doing something I want to do nothing, but yet even when you were doing nothing you were still tired all the time.

13
00:00:58,315 --> 00:01:00,403
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

14
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:05,589
Speaker 1: it's sort of like if you wake up you get some energy But then if you don't do anything your body goes.

15
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:08,140
Speaker 1: why the fuck did I get up go back to bed?

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,903
Speaker 1: You're not doing shit.

17
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:09,806
Speaker 1: I don't know.

18
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:13,240
Speaker 1: like like the the lion the lion just kind of sits around going.

19
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,309
Speaker 0: Are you comparing yourself to a lion?

20
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,740
Speaker 1: nah in only one aspect all right?

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,033
Speaker 0: Sleepiness, I'll accept that.

22
00:01:22,093 --> 00:01:25,350
Speaker 1: perhaps also a sloth Maybe a snail.

23
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:26,760
Speaker 1: meanwhile turtle

24
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:40,723
Speaker 0: I was at work to my normal work And I had a couple hours to kill at the end of the day because mostly I was just doing mindless paperwork and telnetting into Routers so I could then telnet into other routers so I could then telnet into switches so I could look at their stuff and get Their serial numbers.

25
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:45,964
Speaker 0: wow yeah, that was awesome, but I had some time to kill so I was thinking about it And then before I left work.

26
00:01:46,305 --> 00:02:01,154
Speaker 0: I started and I'm going to finish this at home over the next few months I'm gonna write a small textbook on how to podcast because most podcasts like we're gonna talk about today Kinda suck at least audio quality wise

27
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:19,600
Speaker 1: yeah, also I'd like to point out you know this is an insult to anyone in particular, but most how-to podcasts are Generally aimed at the absolute idiot And they'll tell you like yeah Just get audacity plug in a microphone and push record and they don't give you enough information how to do things properly.

28
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:22,300
Speaker 0: They seem to or they I mean they seem to fall into two categories.

29
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:41,699
Speaker 0: It's either that you know the crap guy that doesn't really give you anything useful And then there are the guides that oh well just buy a 48 port digital mixer and use The fastest Mac you can find with some firewire, and oh yeah these $500 ksm microphones exactly what you need.

30
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:44,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, and no one really made a guy mean.

31
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:50,480
Speaker 0: I don't want to sound like I have a big head But I think we're one of the best sounding podcasts out there professional or otherwise.

32
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:53,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least in the top 15 or 20.

33
00:02:53,831 --> 00:03:00,157
Speaker 1: I mean considering that we're putting it at MP3 We make pretty much the best MP3 you can make of two guys talking.

34
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:08,295
Speaker 0: yeah I mean pretty much all the things I have to do to make it sound the one or two percent better is Tiny trial and error and when I get a faster computer.

35
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:09,180
Speaker 0: I got some filters.

36
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,664
Speaker 0: I wrote that the only reason I don't use them now is that it would take 20 minutes on my slow ass computer Unlike the computer.

37
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:16,586
Speaker 1: I now have at work.

38
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,014
Speaker 1: Which is a core to duo now.

39
00:03:19,455 --> 00:03:22,443
Speaker 1: I never used a core to Anything before.

40
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:29,988
Speaker 1: in fact the fastest computer I ever used for more than like two seconds is probably that one You're that's right next to you right now.

41
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been a little lucky in that at IBM I got to play around with some blade machines that were faster than all I could ever fathom.

42
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:41,859
Speaker 1: Well, I guess technically at RIT I had like those big Sun servers that I would get to do stuff for.

43
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,677
Speaker 0: yeah But like you weren't running a desktop.

44
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:47,052
Speaker 0: well Yeah, so I were like I didn't run quake on those blade servers.

45
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:47,835
Speaker 1: yep, so work.

46
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:48,880
Speaker 1: I have a core to duo.

47
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,780
Speaker 1: It's just a Dell, but I put Ubuntu on it.

48
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:55,591
Speaker 1: And let me tell you holy shit is it fast?

49
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,700
Speaker 1: and holy shit is it nice to have a wicked fast computer?

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,067
Speaker 1: Holy crap, holy crap again.

51
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:06,151
Speaker 0: It's been a long time since I've had a computer that responded immediately to anything I asked it to do.

52
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:06,819
Speaker 0: that was trivial.

53
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:11,734
Speaker 1: I mean the computer I have my desk at home is 1.8 gigahertz Athlon XP.

54
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:14,884
Speaker 1: right this core to duo has Two cores.

55
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,019
Speaker 1: each core is 1.8 gigahertz, but they're not the same cores.

56
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,120
Speaker 1: These are Intel cores of new fanciness and not old busted Athlon XP cores.

57
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:36,140
Speaker 1: So the fact that they're at the same clock speed as an old busted core yet They're super awesome cores of like a zillion times more transistors in them and better logics and efficiency.

58
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,992
Speaker 1: It is so stupidly fast.

59
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:40,137
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

60
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:40,920
Speaker 1: anyway.

61
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my new work.

62
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:47,156
Speaker 1: It's better than my old work because well there are people there.

63
00:04:47,176 --> 00:04:48,700
Speaker 1: the people are cool.

64
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,398
Speaker 1: Ish they talk?

65
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,740
Speaker 1: They're intelligent and not idiots they.

66
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,473
Speaker 0: Well, you're making your old job sound really bad.

67
00:04:57,654 --> 00:05:09,679
Speaker 0: if these are the good points Well, I mean I guess it just comes down to the fact that Scott And I and I know there's a lot of I mean our friend Alex is pretty much all our friends Except for all the art people who seem really happy with what they do.

68
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:11,987
Speaker 0: We're never happy in any job.

69
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:15,920
Speaker 0: No matter what how great a job is after maybe we should have become artists.

70
00:05:16,161 --> 00:05:17,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, after about a month.

71
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,611
Speaker 0: It's like how many Cisco routers.

72
00:05:19,632 --> 00:05:20,916
Speaker 0: Do you need me to configure?

73
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:22,340
Speaker 0: I did it once.

74
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:23,571
Speaker 0: It's not fun anymore.

75
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:28,340
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, the work at this new work is not exciting work.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:38,720
Speaker 1: it's actually pretty a work, but the people there seem to be cool and They're paying me, and I had fun today at least even though you know my day was long.

77
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:47,216
Speaker 1: but I'm sure tomorrow will be a shorter day and Hopefully, I'll keep this job for a while, and we'll see where it goes if it starts to suck.

78
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:48,099
Speaker 1: I'll just quit again.

79
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,431
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to watch out for that problem of.

80
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,360
Speaker 0: you know you interview for the eighth job.

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,848
Speaker 0: They're like huh, so you've had seven jobs in the last year Yeah, and you quit all of them.

82
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:05,655
Speaker 1: actually the bigger problem is you know my previous job I was alone in the middle of nowhere so finding a new job was easy now.

83
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:10,630
Speaker 1: I got to find a new job While showing up somewhere where there are people watching me.

84
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,516
Speaker 0: It's really not hard to do really.

85
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:13,860
Speaker 0: you just take sick days.

86
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:19,975
Speaker 1: Yeah, I get unlimited sick days technically, but if I abuse it then I'll be in trouble whoa?

87
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,660
Speaker 0: so how much vacation do you have?

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,440
Speaker 0: I don't need to ask all the personal details of your job, but that's an interesting policy.

89
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:27,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just unlimited sick days.

90
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:30,656
Speaker 1: if you're sick don't come into work dumbass.

91
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:32,100
Speaker 0: see my company's all complicated.

92
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:42,590
Speaker 1: I don't get sick days, but if you actually abuse the sick days You know you you lie, or you do it a whole lot, and you're obviously Faking then they'll pun you maybe fire you.

93
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:46,830
Speaker 0: I've never worked at a company small enough to get away with that And I kind of wish I did now.

94
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,400
Speaker 0: I mean I don't have sick days at all.

95
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:50,459
Speaker 0: I just have this kind of choice time bank.

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:58,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, we like as we barely have any personal days, and we get like two weeks vacation But if you don't use vacation, then it rolls over.

97
00:06:58,529 --> 00:06:59,994
Speaker 0: yeah mine rolls over too.

98
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:00,837
Speaker 0: That's a really nice thing.

99
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:04,120
Speaker 1: but also Just the default holidays.

100
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:10,020
Speaker 1: We actually get What's it called two extra days off?

101
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,820
Speaker 1: Oh, I get two days off at this company that I did not get off at the previous job.

102
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,707
Speaker 1: Huh at the previous job.

103
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:20,080
Speaker 1: I got off Labor Day Memorial Day Independence Day.

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,247
Speaker 0: You need to list all the days.

105
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:23,440
Speaker 1: no New Year's Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day.

106
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,163
Speaker 1: I think that's it.

107
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,329
Speaker 0: you could have just given me the diff.

108
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,600
Speaker 1: yeah anyway the diff is now.

109
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:38,507
Speaker 1: I also get off MLK Day Black Friday And the day before Chris and the day before Christmas you get Black Friday off Yep, huh, and the day before Christmas.

110
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,075
Speaker 1: so Christmas Eve two additional days off by default.

111
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,218
Speaker 0: That's interesting.

112
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,215
Speaker 1: yep Yep, yep, yep.

113
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,447
Speaker 0: Yeah I never understood the whole Personal days as opposed to vacation days.

114
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:55,369
Speaker 1: see to me a personal day was like when you have to do something that can't like you Have a dentist appointment.

115
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,639
Speaker 1: That's a personal day to me.

116
00:07:56,821 --> 00:08:00,608
Speaker 1: You know that's what it's supposed to be But I guess I don't know.

117
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:11,320
Speaker 0: it seems sort of outdated and unnecessary especially considering Maybe it's just me But I was always smart enough to be sure that I never had to use a personal vacation whatever day for anything like that.

118
00:08:11,723 --> 00:08:14,123
Speaker 0: So I can maximize my time spent Vacationing.

119
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:22,593
Speaker 1: yeah, it seems like the difference between the personal days is that you don't have to earn the personal days You just get them and the vacation you have to earn over time.

120
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:23,958
Speaker 1: You know oh well.

121
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,124
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm just really glad that I was.

122
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:32,845
Speaker 0: I kind of strong-armed my company into giving me my vacation time upfront in full and then it Accumulated ever since.

123
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:36,578
Speaker 0: yep, cuz I pretty much said give me that or I'm not gonna work here.

124
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,578
Speaker 1: That's what I did also, so I'll see you guys.

125
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,080
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Oh - can I anyway in the news?

126
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:45,049
Speaker 0: This is a bit of a personal news for me.

127
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:55,254
Speaker 0: you see for any of you who use dig Which is pretty much the premier social bookmarking content filtration meta Commenting whatever whip 2.0.

128
00:08:55,254 --> 00:08:57,845
Speaker 0: Fancy site That everyone uses.

129
00:08:57,865 --> 00:09:00,537
Speaker 0: by the way since we haven't talked about this in forever.

130
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,160
Speaker 0: We're on there.

131
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,325
Speaker 0: You could dig us if you want.

132
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,660
Speaker 0: we haven't mentioned that in a while because we generally don't care about that sort of thing.

133
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:15,317
Speaker 0: But since it comes up yeah anyway a lot of people in the blogosphere Which I have a lot of colorful use them isms for the blogosphere, but I'll just use that word.

134
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:16,616
Speaker 0: I'll use their word I'll be nice.

135
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:28,818
Speaker 0: They've been talking about how dig is unfair or how dig is manipulated by a small core of Vigilantes known as the berry brigade who descend upon stories that and there's all different theories.

136
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:41,305
Speaker 0: some people say Oh, they bury anything That's positive about Sony or they bury all the truth about 9/11 or the federal income tax or the freemasons or UFOs I wonder why.

137
00:09:41,486 --> 00:09:44,033
Speaker 0: or they bury anything involving Christianity.

138
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,918
Speaker 1: Oh, I wonder why.

139
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:46,018
Speaker 1: well

140
00:09:47,621 --> 00:10:02,460
Speaker 0: so someone made a little thing that would have watched dig parse various things and list who was burying things and The dig guy came out to point out that this list was kind of bunk It wasn't gotten very well, and he talked a bit about their philosophy of burying and blocking.

141
00:10:03,462 --> 00:10:04,508
Speaker 0: Now I've read this article.

142
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,380
Speaker 0: I didn't think anything of it here at home.

143
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:15,420
Speaker 0: I actually clicked on the data that everyone was talking about and my name came up fairly Prominently as a member of this so-called berry Brigade.

144
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:22,264
Speaker 1: Really rim is dig like paying you to subvert their system and bury stories They don't like.

145
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:32,329
Speaker 0: um you see I wish that were true But the fact is I am an embittered human being and when I see stupidity or spam I don't just bury it.

146
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:43,440
Speaker 0: It's like a mission to me like if I'm browsing dig You know I got some time over lunch, and I see a story like ah here's the secret of the UFO that actually knocked down World Trade Center seven because of the Freemasons.

147
00:10:44,163 --> 00:10:45,287
Speaker 0: I don't just bury that.

148
00:10:45,768 --> 00:10:59,538
Speaker 0: I click on whoever submitted that's profile and make sure That that wasn't just a one-off fluke and if it turns out that they're one of those people who submits nothing But that I proceed to bury everything they have ever submitted and then block them all right.

149
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,448
Speaker 0: so Also, pretty much anything stupid.

150
00:11:02,488 --> 00:11:03,893
Speaker 0: I see I bury at a whim.

151
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,060
Speaker 0: I don't ever dig people down.

152
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:09,752
Speaker 0: I block immediately if anyone is not worth listening to.

153
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,340
Speaker 0: I've blocked at least three or four thousand people to date.

154
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:16,793
Speaker 1: So in other words rim is a vengeful digger in fact.

155
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:18,940
Speaker 1: I would be hesitant to call him a digger.

156
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,728
Speaker 1: I would say he's a vengeful barrier.

157
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,757
Speaker 0: I have buried more things than I've dug.

158
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,596
Speaker 1: yes I mean you give rim the home page of dig and it's all new stories.

159
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:31,858
Speaker 1: He hasn't seen yet What percentage of those do you think you're gonna bury on a given fraud?

160
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:32,039
Speaker 0: I?

161
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:37,395
Speaker 0: Bury an average of one story for every two pages of the front page news.

162
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:41,709
Speaker 0: wow now If that's not talking about upcoming oh god.

163
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,997
Speaker 0: I pretty much very everything cuz it's all spam yep.

164
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:51,196
Speaker 1: So if there's like 20 people out there who are like rim, and you know where there's one.

165
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:57,233
Speaker 1: There's more That explains your crazy Barry Brigade conspiracy.

166
00:11:57,855 --> 00:12:03,411
Speaker 0: well here is the Wonderful deliciously ironic conclusion to all of this.

167
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:06,600
Speaker 1: this story about the berry brigade was buried by rim.

168
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:07,877
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

169
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:13,160
Speaker 0: It's so much more eloquent and not eloquent elegant than that all right.

170
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:20,210
Speaker 0: So I looked at this data and the dig guy Kevin Rose basically said yeah This data is not a hundred percent accurate.

171
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:26,078
Speaker 0: it got the berries right But it didn't always say which story would have been buried and it wasn't always right.

172
00:12:26,098 --> 00:12:28,440
Speaker 0: like it Attributed berries to people who didn't bury.

173
00:12:28,962 --> 00:12:34,827
Speaker 0: So I went and I clicked on the 12 things that it said I had buried in that time And I actually buried four of them.

174
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:40,674
Speaker 0: the rest, and I look I had buried stories at those times But I had buried different stories.

175
00:12:41,117 --> 00:12:51,766
Speaker 0: however I looked at the stories that said I buried that I didn't and with one exception I buried all of them because they deserved it And it felt kind of good.

176
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:54,214
Speaker 1: rim is the mad barrier.

177
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,260
Speaker 1: there is no dig conspiracy.

178
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,257
Speaker 1: There are just a few more people like rim besides rim.

179
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,212
Speaker 0: well I could talk at length about my reasons for that because it's not just on dig.

180
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:05,560
Speaker 0: It's on any sort of ranking system.

181
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:14,160
Speaker 0: I always feel that in general people are far too lenient When they grade or rank things and they're far more willing to give something a good grade than a low grade.

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,979
Speaker 0: There's a lot of grade inflation going on pretty much everywhere.

183
00:13:17,745 --> 00:13:27,740
Speaker 0: also Giving a very low score or using a block or a berry Always has more of an impact overall than giving something a little plus or a little nudge or a little dig.

184
00:13:28,282 --> 00:13:28,825
Speaker 1: That's true.

185
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:34,047
Speaker 1: You know giving something one dig doesn't like send it Skyrocketing but giving it a berry is like.

186
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:38,259
Speaker 1: it's a lot more than counting as minus one dig you know.

187
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:49,073
Speaker 1: so If you were if you really want to clean up the system you can actually get ahead a lot more by Burying things that that you don't like them by digging things that you do like.

188
00:13:49,274 --> 00:13:58,713
Speaker 0: also I cite sturgeon's law 99% of everything is crap and Contra and filtration is more important than content sorting at least in my mind.

189
00:13:58,994 --> 00:14:01,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, so that's enough of that.

190
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:02,425
Speaker 0: What do you got captain?

191
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:05,237
Speaker 0: you didn't have any news, so it's actually my news.

192
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:05,960
Speaker 1: That's fine.

193
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:08,416
Speaker 1: Apparently there's some Republican.

194
00:14:08,436 --> 00:14:09,040
Speaker 1: was the senator?

195
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,887
Speaker 0: He's a. no he's a member of the house.

196
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:16,447
Speaker 0: Greg Walden Republican from Oregon who is a member of the house Telecommunications subcommittee right.

197
00:14:16,908 --> 00:14:20,880
Speaker 1: this guy is worried that something awesome will happen now.

198
00:14:21,982 --> 00:14:39,356
Speaker 0: It's complicated because I can't tell where this guy stands because he's all over the place But he envisions he fears he expects that the Supreme Court May in various upcoming suits that he is watching Strip away the FCC's power to regulate decency on the airwaves.

199
00:14:39,376 --> 00:14:40,720
Speaker 1: Why would you worry about that?

200
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,874
Speaker 1: That would be the greatest day in history.

201
00:14:42,894 --> 00:14:48,960
Speaker 0: I But if that happens I would probably take the day off work to celebrate with champagne.

202
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:57,100
Speaker 1: I would also probably take the day to go to work cuz I'd go to the city and celebrate somewhere doing something awesome.

203
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:04,652
Speaker 1: I would also be sure to listen to the radio a lot And I'd probably go and get a TV to watch it see.

204
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:16,671
Speaker 0: the thing is I don't think writing radio right away There'd be a lot of funny bits of people saying stuff You imagine like as soon as the gavel comes down at the Supreme Court Like every radio station in the whole country.

205
00:15:16,691 --> 00:15:25,109
Speaker 1: be like fuckity-fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck Fuck, yeah shit, yeah Fuck shit shit cock shit cock.

206
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,140
Speaker 0: see I don't think television though would change very much.

207
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,977
Speaker 0: I mean I think people would start using the word fuck in television shows.

208
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:35,070
Speaker 0: the thing is Americans use that word a lot anyway.

209
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,878
Speaker 0: the word has almost no impact.

210
00:15:36,898 --> 00:15:51,600
Speaker 0: just that maybe Maybe it's just because we're, you know, hip twenty-somethings, living in downstate New York, working in New York City, and we went to a liberal, technology-filled geeky school, and we're on to internet where people swear worse than sailors ever could.

211
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:55,688
Speaker 0: But the word "fuck" has no impact.

212
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,800
Speaker 0: If I say "fuck you," that doesn't really imply malice anymore.

213
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,440
Speaker 0: I mean, the words I have to use to imply malice are actually not obscenities.

214
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:15,819
Speaker 0: The things I could say when I'm actually angry have far less regulation and draw far less ire than the words that mean nothing to me like "fuck shit piss damn son of a bitch

215
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,199
Speaker 0: whore.".

216
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:17,058
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

217
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:18,036
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

218
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,178
Speaker 1: Fuck your mom.

219
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:20,879
Speaker 0: Your mother's a whore.

220
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, seriously.

221
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't know.

222
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:36,980
Speaker 0: The reason he says this is that there are currently three major lawsuits against the FCC from three major television networks over the fact that, basically, the FCC will fine you if you violate one of their rules.

223
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,420
Speaker 0: But at the same time, they refuse to publish or enumerate their rules, because if they enumerated them, then you could do anything they didn't say you couldn't do.

224
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:45,373
Speaker 1: Yeah.

225
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:54,060
Speaker 0: So as a result, there's this magic, unwritten set of rules, and all you can hope for is that they might warn you before they fine you, but usually they don't.

226
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,090
Speaker 0: They just fine you.

227
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:55,919
Speaker 1: Millions and millions.

228
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,384
Speaker 1: This actually reminds me of a case I read about in Texas.

229
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:11,700
Speaker 1: I think I might have mentioned it on the show before, but I remember reading about a court case in Texas where a guy was, like, fine for violating the building code or not being up to the building code.

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:24,700
Speaker 1: And part of the building code required that you do certain things to the building, and that certain thing you had to do to the building was some sort of patented process or item or something.

231
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:29,380
Speaker 1: And thus it was a trade secret of some other company, yet it was part of the code.

232
00:17:30,422 --> 00:17:34,560
Speaker 1: And so he couldn't do it because he couldn't find out what to do because it was a secret.

233
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,719
Speaker 1: But it was the law that you had to do it.

234
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,180
Speaker 1: And the judge ended up saying, as I remember, I'm not 100% sure on this, that you can't keep the law a secret.

235
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,619
Speaker 1: People can't follow the law if they don't know it.

236
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,239
Speaker 1: If something is the law, you have to tell people what the hell it is.

237
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:58,602
Speaker 0: There's a lot of argument that this same precedent will eventually force governments to not use Microsoft software in any sort of... Well, I mean, internally.

238
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:04,340
Speaker 0: they could use it, but they couldn't require, say, you to submit grant applications in a Microsoft Word document.

239
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,740
Speaker 0: Or require that you have Internet Explorer to access a website on the government.

240
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:15,200
Speaker 1: Or, you know, require that you have any particular operating system to do your taxes online.

241
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:15,567
Speaker 1: Yeah.

242
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:17,257
Speaker 1: It's all good by me.

243
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:30,540
Speaker 1: But yeah, anyway, this guy, he's worried that the FCC will not be able to enforce its twisted, illogical morals upon the broadcasting authorities.

244
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,120
Speaker 0: See, it's hard to say because, once again, he's all over the place and this article is very short.

245
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he starts saying...

246
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,540
Speaker 0: He's like, the FCC, there should be an increase in FCC fines.

247
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:46,719
Speaker 0: And apparently he also owns five radio stations.

248
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:50,500
Speaker 1: And then he says something about he doesn't want, like, a nanny state.

249
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,986
Speaker 1: But it's like, what?

250
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,680
Speaker 1: You just said you did want more of a nanny state.

251
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,640
Speaker 1: It's like he doesn't consider punishing someone for swearing as nanny state.

252
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,940
Speaker 0: Granted, this is not the best news site, and I'm not gonna blame him because they might just have not understood what he said.

253
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might just be, it looks like a bad news site, I can see it from here.

254
00:19:10,461 --> 00:19:12,300
Speaker 0: It's a pretty mediocre news site.

255
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:30,140
Speaker 1: I think the whole, the only thing that we should take out of this story is that, you know, even if this whole story is completely BS, if the FCC ever loses its power to censor the airwaves of both TV and radio or whatever, that is going to be the awesomest time.

256
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:38,467
Speaker 0: And yet at the same time, it's probably gonna prove to all the nutjobs, at least the more rational nutjobs, that, "Oh look, the world didn't end.

257
00:19:38,788 --> 00:19:42,200
Speaker 0: Kids aren't suddenly having naked seven-year-old sex in the streets.

258
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,507
Speaker 0: People are still having normal conversations.

259
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,336
Speaker 0: They're not continually saying the word 'fuck'.

260
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:49,358
Speaker 0: Society moved

261
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:49,719
Speaker 0: on.".

262
00:19:50,020 --> 00:20:00,981
Speaker 1: Of course, if it does happen, I will be the first person to purchase a UHF transmitter and have a nice porn station going on 24/7.

263
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:08,340
Speaker 1: And I'll put the hardest core porn before the kiddies go to school and when the kiddies get home from school at three.

264
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,158
Speaker 0: You mean the Saturday morning porns?

265
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,840
Speaker 1: That's right, the Saturday morning porn tunes.

266
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,180
Speaker 0: See, the thing is, don't forget, the FCC will still have the power to regulate the airwaves.

267
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 0: They just can't regulate the content of it, so you still couldn't broadcast.

268
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,097
Speaker 1: Well, I'd just get a broadcasting license, and then they said, "What are you going to

269
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:22,580
Speaker 1: broadcast?"?

270
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:23,028
Speaker 1: And I would say,

271
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:23,679
Speaker 1: "Television.".

272
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,197
Speaker 0: And they would say, "Fine, give us ten billion dollars, 'cause that's what we

273
00:20:28,237 --> 00:20:28,779
Speaker 0: charge.".

274
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:36,319
Speaker 1: And considering how much advertising money I would make from having a porn station, I would say, "Yes, sir, here is your

275
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:36,600
Speaker 1: money.".

276
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Speaker 0: I don't think there's one, 'cause there's people who already have licenses who could just show pornography.

277
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:41,360
Speaker 0: Oh, and they do it?

278
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,020
Speaker 0: And pornography-related items.

279
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,714
Speaker 1: Well, if they do my job for me, then my job is done.

280
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:47,020
Speaker 1: I don't need a porn station.

281
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,125
Speaker 0: Things of the day!

282
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,300
Speaker 0: We're going to conclude Scott's somewhat theme week here.

283
00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:09,340
Speaker 1: Yes, all week, the things of the day have been openers to mostly cartoon shows, but the openers are in different languages from around the world.

284
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:10,000
Speaker 0: Oh, snaps!

285
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,760
Speaker 1: Today, I give you perhaps, uh, I don't know if it's my favorite one, 'cause that German Sailor Moon is freakin' addicting as all hell.

286
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,368
Speaker 1: [singing in German].

287
00:22:29,471 --> 00:22:31,500
Speaker 0: [singing in German].

288
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,535
Speaker 0: [singing in German].

289
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:48,429
Speaker 0: It's been in my head all day.

290
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,400
Speaker 0: I had to go to YouTube and listen to it around lunch just to get it out.

291
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Speaker 1: Yes, but here I give you, uh, something that may not be familiar to everyone listening to this podcast.

292
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:00,743
Speaker 1: [singing in German].

293
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:34,979
Speaker 0: [singing in Spanish].

294
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,603
Speaker 1: [singing in Spanish].

295
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:47,240
Speaker 1: [singing in Spanish].

296
00:23:59,041 --> 00:24:02,847
Speaker 1: Yes, for those of you who do not know, there was a Warner Bros.

297
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:10,540
Speaker 1: cartoon that was, I guess, created by Steven Spielberg in some way, known as Freakazoid.

298
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,383
Speaker 0: Now, you know, there was kind of this progression.

299
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:21,220
Speaker 0: Like, there was Tiny Toons, which was zany humor, but it was also really kind of not based in reality, but grounded in some level of... of sense.

300
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,782
Speaker 0: It was like skits.

301
00:24:23,222 --> 00:24:28,774
Speaker 0: And then Animaniacs was like the next step up, where, while there were skits in it, it was a little bit more out there.

302
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,600
Speaker 0: Freakazoid was, like, two steps beyond that.

303
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,927
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing about Freakazoid is that it was real nerdy.

304
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:42,739
Speaker 1: Like, the plot of Freakazoid is a nerdy guy gets sucked into the internet through his computer...

305
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,277
Speaker 0: Bear in mind that they're really...

306
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,160
Speaker 1: ...and turns into a superhero who is nerdy.

307
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,660
Speaker 0: As far as we're concerned, there really was no internet back then yet either.

308
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:51,784
Speaker 1: I know, so it was way ahead of its time.

309
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:59,740
Speaker 1: And almost every joke in Freakazoid is some sort of pop culture comic book guy kind of joke, you know?

310
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,399
Speaker 1: And thus, the show really appealed to geeks like me.

311
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:06,059
Speaker 0: I'm gonna need more rope.

312
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,083
Speaker 1: Yes, R.I.M.

313
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:10,840
Speaker 1: has quoted the greatest Freakazoid, uh, bit ever.

314
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,136
Speaker 0: Also, one of the, I don't know, three episodes of Freakazoid I could stand to watch.

315
00:25:15,197 --> 00:25:16,020
Speaker 0: I didn't like that show.

316
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:16,798
Speaker 1: Oh, you suck.

317
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,500
Speaker 1: I don't know, I just... Freakazoid rules.

318
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,920
Speaker 0: I really liked Tiny Toons as a kid.

319
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,039
Speaker 1: I liked Tiny Toons also.

320
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,580
Speaker 0: And I really liked Animaniacs.

321
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,818
Speaker 1: I liked Animaniacs also.

322
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,780
Speaker 0: Of course, then again, when I think about it, right about when Freakazoid came out is right about when I pretty much stopped watching television.

323
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,736
Speaker 0: Ah... Like, as it was coming out, I remember seeing that show and thinking, "Wow, this is just... fuck it,".

324
00:25:37,796 --> 00:25:38,920
Speaker 0: and I just stopped watching TV.

325
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:45,120
Speaker 1: See, Freakazoid for me came out at sort of like the high point of Animaniacs, and it was like a double whammy.

326
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,438
Speaker 1: It was like, "Not only is this the high point of Animaniacs, but goddamn, there's Freakazoid as

327
00:25:49,478 --> 00:25:49,739
Speaker 1: well.".

328
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,080
Speaker 0: See, right around then, I was spending more and more time playing video games and messing around with my computer.

329
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,620
Speaker 1: The one problem with Freakazoid was that the time slot made it inconvenient to watch, so I did not see as much of it as I wanted.

330
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:09,100
Speaker 1: But, if you have not seen Freakazoid, I suggest you go on the internet and look for the episode of Freakazoid known as "Candlejack," and watch it, because it is awesome.

331
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:12,879
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember Scott had, like, the worst copy.

332
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:17,240
Speaker 1: No, that's 'cause Ian, I think, had it on a VHS, and I ripped it with the Aver.

333
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was about to say exactly that.

334
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:19,899
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

335
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,460
Speaker 0: So, we have this... we have probably the worst video capture thing ever.

336
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,150
Speaker 0: It's an external USB 1.0 Windows-only S-video.

337
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,440
Speaker 0: That doesn't even take S-video, I don't think.

338
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,058
Speaker 1: I think it does.

339
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,518
Speaker 0: I think it took RCA and coax.

340
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,205
Speaker 0: It did.

341
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:34,754
Speaker 1: Oh, it did.

342
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:34,937
Speaker 1: Yep.

343
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:44,857
Speaker 0: And Scott ripped this already piss-poor VHS into this horribly piss-poor 320x200 MPEG, and then we watched it.

344
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:46,480
Speaker 0: It was unwatchable.

345
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,219
Speaker 1: It's on YouTube now, you can find it, I'm pretty sure.

346
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,980
Speaker 1: But yeah, my thing of the day is the opener to Freakazoid in Spanish.

347
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:04,420
Speaker 1: And they haven't changed any of the animation, so you can still see the word "Freakazoid" spelled out in the alphabet that we use, that Spanish people also use.

348
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:08,519
Speaker 1: But they don't call it Freakazoid, they call it Phenomenoid.

349
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,973
Speaker 1: Which, alright, but don't the Spanish people see that it says Freakazoid?

350
00:27:14,013 --> 00:27:16,039
Speaker 1: Aren't they gonna be like, "What the hell's up with that

351
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:16,259
Speaker 1: shit?"?

352
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,800
Speaker 0: Don't the Americans see that the signs are all in Japanese in their anime?

353
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,480
Speaker 1: Well, but the thing is, Japanese is a different character set, it's a different alphabet.

354
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:32,440
Speaker 1: We can't, you know, unless you know it, you don't know it, but if you're watching a Spanish show, you can figure out what the word is.

355
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:40,700
Speaker 1: And if some guy says in English, like Freakazoid, and on the screen it says Phenomenoid, you know that something's up.

356
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,800
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, by the same token, I'm finishing it out.

357
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:50,500
Speaker 0: Now, I find this one interesting, 'cause I always wondered why people didn't do this when they had openers where they could get away with it.

358
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,660
Speaker 0: Like, in other languages of South Park, they had a voice actor do Kenny.

359
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:56,900
Speaker 1: Yep.

360
00:27:57,361 --> 00:28:03,900
Speaker 0: Which didn't, I just found that kind of funny, but anyway, this show I watched semi-religiously as a kid was called Cops.

361
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,140
Speaker 1: I never even heard of this show until they told me about it.

362
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:16,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, all of us were watching the Zelda DVDs, and we saw the opener to Cops in English on the DVD as an extra, and we watched it a couple times, 'cause Cops was a pretty good show.

363
00:28:17,001 --> 00:28:19,600
Speaker 0: It's kind of a cross between Tank Police and RoboCop.

364
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:20,575
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

365
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:21,979
Speaker 0: And Carmen Sandiego.

366
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,459
Speaker 1: Carmen Sandiego's awesome.

367
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:29,140
Speaker 1: Man, if there was a DVD of, like, you could watch old Carmen Sandiego game show episodes.

368
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:30,465
Speaker 0: Oh, the game show.

369
00:28:30,707 --> 00:28:31,873
Speaker 0: I thought you were gonna say the cartoon.

370
00:28:31,914 --> 00:28:32,980
Speaker 0: I was gonna say, "What the hell's wrong with

371
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,060
Speaker 0: you?".

372
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,886
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck the cartoon.

373
00:28:33,906 --> 00:28:35,880
Speaker 1: No, the game show of Carmen Sandiego.

374
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:44,180
Speaker 1: People don't realize that Carmen Sandiego started out as an awesome game show on PBS, and that was where the action was.

375
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,620
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean an awesome game show where the kids on it were dumbfucks?

376
00:28:48,041 --> 00:29:00,011
Speaker 1: I know, but that's what was so great about it, is that you would sit there, and they'd be like, "Hey, kid, put a glowing stick on South Africa," and he'd put it in, like, Egypt, and you'd be like, "Fuck you, you dumbass!

377
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:00,374
Speaker 1: Fuck

378
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:00,555
Speaker 1: you!".

379
00:29:01,563 --> 00:29:02,999
Speaker 0: Good thing the FCC can't get us.

380
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:03,999
Speaker 1: That's right.

381
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:11,748
Speaker 0: So, no, the opener to this show is basically other than a guy saying, "Blah, blah, blah, crime.

382
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,130
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah,

383
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,410
Speaker 0: cops.".

384
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,628
Speaker 0: It's just this techno kind of thing, and a guy saying the word "cops" over and over again, just

385
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:21,189
Speaker 0: "cops."

386
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:23,572
Speaker 0: "Cops.".

387
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:28,005
Speaker 0: And while, obviously, they dubbed the show in German, they didn't re-sing the song.

388
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:28,828
Speaker 0: It just says

389
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:29,409
Speaker 0: "cops.".

390
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:40,607
Speaker 1: That's something I realized while researching, well, I guess researching, if that's what you want to call it, all these different openers in various languages, is that Disney and Warner Bros.

391
00:29:40,667 --> 00:30:14,890
Speaker 1: and the big boys seem to be able to afford having lots of vocals in their openers, you know, actual composed songs that didn't suck that badly, and they actually seem to also be able to afford to get people to sing those songs in other languages in other countries, whereas smaller-time studios that usually just made shows for syndication could not afford to have their, like, lyrics composed for their songs, and if they did, they couldn't afford to have them translated, or at least less often.

392
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,563
Speaker 1: Like, Thundercats, if you watch it in another country, they still go,

393
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:19,668
Speaker 1: "Thundercats.".

394
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,016
Speaker 0: You know what?

395
00:30:25,116 --> 00:30:27,930
Speaker 0: "Thundercat" would probably be a really cool word in German.

396
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,390
Speaker 1: Thundercats rule.

397
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,710
Speaker 0: I'm just getting that vibe.

398
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:31,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

399
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,810
Speaker 0: Alright, anyway, we didn't know what to talk about tonight.

400
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:40,107
Speaker 0: Scott got home late, and I was playing Super Mario World for a good 45 minutes.

401
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:41,730
Speaker 1: Yep.

402
00:30:42,471 --> 00:30:43,457
Speaker 0: And it's a Thursday.

403
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:45,006
Speaker 0: You'd think, "Oh, we can talk about anything.

404
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:45,288
Speaker 0: That'd be

405
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:45,590
Speaker 0: easy.".

406
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,137
Speaker 0: But nah.

407
00:30:46,686 --> 00:30:46,929
Speaker 0: Nah.

408
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:56,250
Speaker 0: 'Cause everything we thought of was either something that would require research, which is pretty much the bane of our existence at this point, or something we just didn't want to talk about anything complicated.

409
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:58,518
Speaker 0: I mean, I got a lot to say about politics right now.

410
00:30:58,538 --> 00:31:02,250
Speaker 0: I got a lot to say about, I don't know, a bunch of stuff sitting on my desk.

411
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:03,430
Speaker 0: I got stories, but...

412
00:31:04,216 --> 00:31:04,990
Speaker 1: I have to go to bed.

413
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Scott was lazy, and as a result, blaming Scott, we didn't have a topic for tonight.

414
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:12,830
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about those zombies.

415
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,292
Speaker 0: Yep.

416
00:31:14,793 --> 00:31:16,037
Speaker 0: We couldn't delay it anymore.

417
00:31:16,057 --> 00:31:20,910
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about another aspect of fighting off the zombie apocalypse.

418
00:31:21,111 --> 00:31:28,680
Speaker 0: Last time, I remember we talked a lot about reconnaissance, you know, how do you figure out what's going on, but... I don't know, I'm just not feeling it.

419
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,010
Speaker 0: I think we should talk about something else.

420
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:36,630
Speaker 1: That sounds good to me, because zombies are messy and slow, and they like to eat brains.

421
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,092
Speaker 1: Hey!

422
00:31:37,494 --> 00:31:38,681
Speaker 0: This is a podcast.

423
00:31:38,962 --> 00:31:40,310
Speaker 0: Let's talk about podcasts!

424
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:42,889
Speaker 1: Oh, that's gonna be real good.

425
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,704
Speaker 0: Well, no, I got not- 'cause we actually came up with a great idea for a contest.

426
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:47,890
Speaker 0: But I'll get to that later.

427
00:31:48,151 --> 00:31:48,235
Speaker 1: Okay.

428
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:56,830
Speaker 0: Just 'cause I realized over the past few months that my taste in podcasts and what I've been listening to has changed fairly dramatically over time.

429
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,590
Speaker 0: And it seems like for every ten podcasts I pick up and listen to, I only keep one of them.

430
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:10,150
Speaker 0: And of the ten of the ones I keep over the ten months or so, I'll only keep two or three of them.

431
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:11,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed that as well.

432
00:32:11,976 --> 00:32:16,350
Speaker 1: When I first started listening to podcasts, I sorta just picked 'em up here and there.

433
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:21,522
Speaker 1: And the ones that I listen to, like the day- 'cause I got an iPod Nano.

434
00:32:21,563 --> 00:32:24,030
Speaker 1: the day iPod Nanos were announced.

435
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,790
Speaker 1: Steve Jobs pulled it out of his pocket, and I went to the Apple website and I clicked.

436
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,990
Speaker 1: Mostly because my iPod Mini was busted.

437
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,870
Speaker 1: I wonder how that happened.

438
00:32:34,131 --> 00:32:39,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so not because I'm a sucker for Steve Jobs, because I'm not.

439
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:47,430
Speaker 1: Anyway, and as soon as I got that iPod Nano a couple days later, I started listening to podcasts 'cause I started using iTunes.

440
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:51,137
Speaker 1: And, well, I subscribed to a whole bunch of podcasts.

441
00:32:51,658 --> 00:32:54,885
Speaker 1: And almost none of those do I still subscribe to.

442
00:32:55,126 --> 00:32:55,948
Speaker 1: Like, maybe two.

443
00:32:56,529 --> 00:32:56,930
Speaker 0: That's it.

444
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:03,990
Speaker 0: I mean, we've talked about this before, and we did a long, very popular thread in the forums about it, but this is kind of an update.

445
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,554
Speaker 0: Like, what we're listening to right now.

446
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:11,090
Speaker 0: Partly 'cause I wanna give props to all the podcasts I actually like, 'cause I don't listen to many podcasts.

447
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:12,251
Speaker 1: No.

448
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:19,710
Speaker 1: I mean, now I'm prob- you know, for a while, like recently, say the past few weeks, maybe the past month, my podcast listening has declined.

449
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:26,824
Speaker 1: Like, I subscribe to a bunch of shows, and I see them there in my iTunes, and I say, "Man, that's a good show.

450
00:33:26,844 --> 00:33:29,589
Speaker 1: I like that show, I don't wanna unsubscribe from

451
00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:29,689
Speaker 1: it.".

452
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,259
Speaker 1: But every time I go and pick up my iPod and say, "Alright, I wanna listen to a podcast now,".

453
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,181
Speaker 1: I look.

454
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:41,110
Speaker 1: And I just don't feel like listening to most of the stuff that's on there.

455
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:41,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:33:42,012 --> 00:33:52,050
Speaker 0: I mean, I gotta admit, and it really gives credit to Dave and Joel, Fast Karate for the Gentlemen, but whenever I sit down at my iPod, they're usually the first ones I go to after I listen to the news.

457
00:33:52,950 --> 00:34:00,870
Speaker 0: It's like, I listen to the news, and then I look, and I've got a Dragon's Landing that's been sitting there forever, and I've got, like, one of all the podcasts I respect.

458
00:34:01,651 --> 00:34:05,788
Speaker 0: And I always just go for the Dave and Joel, then the Anime World Order, and then...

459
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:13,590
Speaker 1: I go for those pretty quickly as well, but I don't know if I'm gonna shamefully admit that I go for Twit right away.

460
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,215
Speaker 1: Really?

461
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,330
Speaker 0: You still listen to Twit?

462
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:16,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

463
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:20,110
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't really put a finger on it, but I don't know.

464
00:34:20,876 --> 00:34:22,389
Speaker 0: I don't enjoy Twit very much.

465
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:29,554
Speaker 1: I get the same feeling of listening to Twit that I get from reading Slashdot, like, in the year 2002.

466
00:34:29,554 --> 00:34:30,588
Speaker 1: Ah, I can see that.

467
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:32,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's kinda why I go for it.

468
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,109
Speaker 1: Plus, it only comes out once a week.

469
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,290
Speaker 1: Oh!

470
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,960
Speaker 1: Alright, you know what podcast I go to right away?

471
00:34:36,981 --> 00:34:40,710
Speaker 1: And you're not gonna like this, but... There's a TV show on ESPN.

472
00:34:41,554 --> 00:34:42,150
Speaker 1: Oh, that thing.

473
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, that thing, called Pardon the Interruption.

474
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,670
Speaker 1: Now, I know a lot of people listening aren't sports fans, and if you are, you're probably not a mer- football!

475
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:57,030
Speaker 1: You're probably not sports fans in the United States, so you probably don't know about this show, 'cause I think it's only on in the US and Canada.

476
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:05,570
Speaker 1: It's basically a show where these two sports journalist guys do basically sorta what we do, not really.

477
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:14,330
Speaker 1: And they, like, have a rundown of all these sports topics on the right, and they just go through 'em real quick, and they always argue with each other.

478
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:23,750
Speaker 1: And then, they'll play a fun game, like, they'll have a game called, like, Oddsmakers, like, you know, uh, what are the chances that this is gonna happen?

479
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,999
Speaker 1: And one guy will be like, "30% chance that that will

480
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:27,340
Speaker 1: happen!".

481
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,469
Speaker 1: The other guy will be like, "0% chance that that will

482
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:30,750
Speaker 1: happen!".

483
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,470
Speaker 1: And they get, you know, they do fun stuff.

484
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:41,730
Speaker 1: And the show's only, like, a half hour long, so a lot of short trips, it's, like, really convenient, whereas most other podcasts seem to be at least an hour long.

485
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,190
Speaker 1: At least most other good podcasts.

486
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:52,010
Speaker 1: So it's, like, one of the few podcasts in that mid-length range, 'cause it's an audio recording of a TV show that you don't really need to look at.

487
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,770
Speaker 1: 'Cause who wants to look at these ugly journalist faces?

488
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,470
Speaker 1: And they cover, you know, pretty much all the entertaining sports news.

489
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,570
Speaker 1: Like, they don't cover, like, who won and who lost.

490
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,307
Speaker 1: They cover, like, all the drama of sports, like, "That guy's going to court with

491
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:08,089
Speaker 1: roids!".

492
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,000
Speaker 1: Or, "Oh, this guy, you know, he's lost five in a row, even though after he talked big, what

493
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:14,200
Speaker 1: now?".

494
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,038
Speaker 1: And it's kinda funny.

495
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:17,408
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

496
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:23,310
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, if we're talking about absolute what I go for first no matter what, hands down is 12 Byzantine Emperors.

497
00:36:23,938 --> 00:36:24,250
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah.

498
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,930
Speaker 0: Or 12 Byzantine Rulers, if you will.

499
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,370
Speaker 1: See, that's another one of those ones where I like it a lot.

500
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:36,530
Speaker 1: But, and I have it, and I subscribe to it, and I've listened to a bunch of episodes, but I still have some episodes that I haven't listened to.

501
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,650
Speaker 1: Like, six or seven of them.

502
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,930
Speaker 0: Like, if one comes out, I will go out of my way to listen to it.

503
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,689
Speaker 0: Like, if one came out on a weekend, I would probably sit in my room and listen to it.

504
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:52,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got, like, six or seven most recent ones I haven't listened to, and not because I don't want to, but, like, the mood never strikes me.

505
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,069
Speaker 1: Like, I look at it, and I see it there in the iPod, and I just don't feel like it.

506
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,029
Speaker 1: But I leave it there, because I know one day I'll feel like it.

507
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,250
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, I've listened to all of them that are out right now, twice.

508
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:12,570
Speaker 0: And I usually, right after I listen to one, I go online, I find maps, and I kind of correlate where all the stuff happened, and where the armies were, and try to get a sense of everything.

509
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:19,330
Speaker 0: But then again, I've been on a really big Roman/Byzantine/Parthian history kick lately.

510
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:29,490
Speaker 1: I mostly like Byzantine Emperors more as, like, I treat it less as a historical thing, because I can't remember all that crap, and it doesn't really matter to me.

511
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,590
Speaker 1: But I listen to it more of, like, a drama, fictional type of thing.

512
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,967
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh man, that guy totally punned that

513
00:37:38,027 --> 00:37:38,369
Speaker 1: guy.".

514
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,559
Speaker 0: Yep, that's the brilliance of it.

515
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,850
Speaker 0: That's why I think it's one of the best podcasts out there.

516
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:50,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he takes history, and he shows you the entertaining drama that sort of maybe really happened.

517
00:37:50,850 --> 00:38:13,670
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, earlier in the podcast run, when he's talking about when the Byzantine Empire was still much more like the Roman Empire in the West, it's much more historically verifiable than some of the later ones, because, you know, the world was slowly descending into the medieval dark ages, so it goes a little more fanciful as time goes on, because history wasn't as well recorded.

518
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,194
Speaker 1: Yep.

519
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,069
Speaker 0: But that also leads to a lot of humor.

520
00:38:18,551 --> 00:38:19,455
Speaker 1: Humor and history?

521
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:20,238
Speaker 1: Those don't mix.

522
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:22,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, 12 Byzantine Emperors is great.

523
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,668
Speaker 0: Yeah, honestly, pretty much right after that, I always go right for "NPR, it's all

524
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:28,210
Speaker 0: politics.".

525
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:34,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to--see, when I first--that's another one--when I first started listening to podcasts, I had like three or four NPRs.

526
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:47,630
Speaker 1: Like, I had NPR, like, best thing of the day, you know, and I had NPR technology, and I had NPR something else, and now I don't listen to NPR anything.

527
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:48,952
Speaker 0: Really?

528
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:54,210
Speaker 0: I mean, NPR, health and technology--or, sorry, health and science, technology.

529
00:38:55,070 --> 00:39:02,468
Speaker 0: Now, I just recently added the BBC World News, whatever, along with BBC Documentary Archives, and the NPR, it's all politics.

530
00:39:02,528 --> 00:39:03,410
Speaker 0: I listen to all of those.

531
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,325
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I would listen to, like, the NPR, like, headlines, like, the headlines of the day, the biggest news.

532
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:09,890
Speaker 1: I would listen to that, too, but not anymore.

533
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:19,010
Speaker 0: I used to listen to All Things Considered, but it was the opinions bit, and, like, four of them in a row were really disagreeable opinions from fairly stupid people.

534
00:39:19,611 --> 00:39:25,070
Speaker 0: So, I kind of stopped listening, and now I looked and I realized that it was just a bad run, so I'm thinking about picking that back up.

535
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:41,370
Speaker 1: I guess it's just that, like, the NPR stuff, since it's mostly news, I read Google News, I'm actually using that WeNews quite a bit, and I really don't care what other people's opinions are so much, 'cause I just form my own.

536
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:49,424
Speaker 1: And I get the information from somewhere, so listening to a guy say it feels like it takes a longer time than it takes me to read it.

537
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:52,430
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a waste, and it doesn't entertain me.

538
00:39:52,450 --> 00:40:00,250
Speaker 0: All the news sites on the internet, other than pretty much Google News, and even there, they, like, the science section on Digg, is mostly garbage.

539
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,010
Speaker 1: That's why I block the science section on Digg, I don't look at it at all.

540
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:13,188
Speaker 0: So I listen to NPR Health and Science, and I learn all the stuff that I wouldn't learn on the internet, because there really aren't good websites that are fun and easy to read.

541
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:14,250
Speaker 0: that cover that.

542
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,720
Speaker 1: That's true, I guess I'm just not interested in learning about Health and Science.

543
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:23,750
Speaker 0: Because they aid me in forming my own opinions.

544
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also actually really like hearing the opinions of experts.

545
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:35,870
Speaker 1: The problem is, every time I listen to a podcast, and I think that, you know, I'm looking for expert opinions, I always go away feeling like they're not experts.

546
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:41,228
Speaker 1: And, I don't know, it's like when I was in college, like, I would hear, like, political...

547
00:40:42,076 --> 00:40:42,361
Speaker 0: Like?

548
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:42,707
Speaker 0: Like?

549
00:40:42,728 --> 00:40:42,809
Speaker 0: Like?

550
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:49,210
Speaker 1: I would hear political scientists speak about things, and I was like, damn, they know what they're fucking talking about.

551
00:40:49,530 --> 00:41:01,810
Speaker 1: And I haven't found a podcast, other than Byzantine Emperors, but that's history, not political science, where people talk about that stuff, it gives me the same feeling of that guy knows what he's fucking talking about, that I got in college.

552
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:05,969
Speaker 0: That was very eloquently stated, in a very non-eloquent way, Scott.

553
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:06,456
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,630
Speaker 0: It's people, you're like, I want fucking educated shit out there, man.

555
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:12,430
Speaker 0: That's right.

556
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:13,289
Speaker 0: That's great.

557
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:13,661
Speaker 0: Yep.

558
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,559
Speaker 0: No, but actually, it's all politics guys.

559
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:19,250
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously they do their research ahead of time.

560
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:27,390
Speaker 0: But they know a lot about American politics, and the inter- I mean, they treat it the way sports fans treat sports.

561
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:35,290
Speaker 0: So instead of the commentary being like, well, you know, no baseball team has ever won the World Series if it lost eight games in February.

562
00:41:37,814 --> 00:41:39,330
Speaker 1: They don't play baseball in February.

563
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,424
Speaker 0: I know, hence what I just said is 100% accurate.

564
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:43,423
Speaker 1: Okay.

565
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:45,686
Speaker 1: Think about it.

566
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:46,568
Speaker 1: Maybe.

567
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:47,171
Speaker 1: It is.

568
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:51,710
Speaker 0: No team has ever won the World Series if it lost eight games in February.

569
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,570
Speaker 1: Yeah.

570
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, but they point out things like that in politics.

571
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:05,690
Speaker 0: Like recently I learned that no Republican has ever been elected President of the United States without having won the Republican primary in South Carolina.

572
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,430
Speaker 0: The first Southern Republican primary.

573
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:08,730
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

574
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:10,790
Speaker 0: And that's really interesting.

575
00:42:11,011 --> 00:42:16,587
Speaker 0: And I'm curious to see how that plays out in the current political climate as things start moving toward the U.S.

576
00:42:16,647 --> 00:42:17,550
Speaker 0: presidential election.

577
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, so keep your eye on the South Carolina primary for Republicans.

578
00:42:24,432 --> 00:42:34,790
Speaker 1: However that turns out, if that guy isn't nominated- No, these guys- Or that person isn't nominated, and if that person is nominated, we'll see if they're going to win or not.

579
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,350
Speaker 0: These guys are old, and they were talking about the Tonight Show with Carson.

580
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:42,470
Speaker 0: And then they were talking about the guy before Carson.

581
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who that is.

582
00:42:44,613 --> 00:42:44,988
Speaker 0: Me either.

583
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,508
Speaker 0: But they kept talking about it.

584
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:51,610
Speaker 1: And they were talking about it- All the old people listening to our show just had heart attacks.

585
00:42:53,992 --> 00:42:57,065
Speaker 0: The first thing I thought was, there was somebody on that show before Carson.

586
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:58,010
Speaker 0: I thought he started the show.

587
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,149
Speaker 0: Because I didn't know.

588
00:42:59,331 --> 00:43:00,029
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

589
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:02,399
Speaker 0: I never even saw the Carson.

590
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,350
Speaker 0: I saw Carson's show like twice.

591
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:06,014
Speaker 1: I never saw it.

592
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:09,870
Speaker 1: But I never really watched Letterman or Leno or anybody.

593
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:10,670
Speaker 0: Nah, me either.

594
00:43:11,093 --> 00:43:11,910
Speaker 1: I don't watch those shows.

595
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,710
Speaker 0: The only show I ever watched like that was- I saw Once in a Laundromat.

596
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,429
Speaker 0: The Daily Show with Craig Kilbourne.

597
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,014
Speaker 0: Yep.

598
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,370
Speaker 0: And then The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, who was far superior.

599
00:43:21,176 --> 00:43:22,989
Speaker 1: I saw some Public Access show also.

600
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:23,791
Speaker 0: Well, let's see.

601
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:33,250
Speaker 0: Actually, one that I listen to regularly, but recently I went through the archives and listened to pretty much every episode I had any interest in is Movies You Should See.

602
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,770
Speaker 0: I really like that podcast.

603
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, Movies You Should See, I sort of get this, it's like a sine wave of interest.

604
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:45,470
Speaker 1: Like, about five or six of them will build up, and then I'll really want to listen to them.

605
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,409
Speaker 1: And I'll listen to one.

606
00:43:46,891 --> 00:43:54,030
Speaker 1: And then that one will like, it'll like prime my attitude for the rest of them.

607
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,200
Speaker 1: And I'll be like, "Oh, that was

608
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:55,482
Speaker 1: great!"

609
00:43:55,563 --> 00:43:56,270
Speaker 1: And I'll listen to the rest.

610
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:56,759
Speaker 0: Yep.

611
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,870
Speaker 1: And then I'll clear them all out, and then I won't have any.

612
00:43:59,151 --> 00:43:59,750
Speaker 0: It's like an avalanche.

613
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,567
Speaker 1: And then when they start building up again, I'll be like, "I don't want to listen to

614
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:02,768
Speaker 1: that.".

615
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:07,970
Speaker 0: I think part of it, and this is going to sound funny, but I mean, they're smart people, and they know what they're talking about.

616
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:15,970
Speaker 0: But they talk with Albionic accents, which to Americans tends to sound educated.

617
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:17,467
Speaker 1: I don't know why that is.

618
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:18,385
Speaker 0: Or villainous.

619
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:19,270
Speaker 1: But it's true.

620
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:21,370
Speaker 0: It's one of the two, it's either educated or villainous.

621
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,889
Speaker 0: And they're obviously, with the possible exception, well I'm not going to get into that, villainous.

622
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:28,250
Speaker 0: So they sound very educated.

623
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:28,910
Speaker 1: Yeah.

624
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:31,950
Speaker 0: And it lends a certain air of authority to their show.

625
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, let this be a note to anyone from Albion.

626
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:41,850
Speaker 1: If you have an accent, it is likely that you can sound very intelligent.

627
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:44,530
Speaker 1: And Americans will respect what you have to say.

628
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:48,770
Speaker 0: I can think of one or two Albionic accents that don't particularly garner that respect.

629
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:49,491
Speaker 0: "Oi!

630
00:44:49,873 --> 00:44:52,143
Speaker 0: Put the flowers in the vase!

631
00:44:52,725 --> 00:44:53,027
Speaker 0: Get

632
00:44:53,509 --> 00:44:53,589
Speaker 0: in!".

633
00:44:53,811 --> 00:44:55,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't talk like that.

634
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,230
Speaker 1: Then Americans will just think you're insane or something.

635
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:09,170
Speaker 1: Let's see, what other, oh, another good example of a podcast where, when I first started listening to a podcast, the IT conversations, you know that whole network of podcasts there?

636
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:09,608
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.

637
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:12,489
Speaker 1: I subscribed to a whole bunch of those.

638
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,750
Speaker 1: The problem was, is while when it was a hit, it was a hit.

639
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:23,850
Speaker 1: You would hear some guy doing a presentation at some tech conference that you couldn't afford to go to or fly to.

640
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,729
Speaker 1: And it would be the best thing ever.

641
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:34,830
Speaker 1: But then the next three or four of those, because they would do every single panel and presentation from every conference, would be like crap and useless.

642
00:45:35,572 --> 00:45:36,509
Speaker 1: And it was like, what the fuck?

643
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:44,090
Speaker 1: So I stopped listening just because I had a hard time weeding out the wheat from the chaff when it comes to the IT conversations.

644
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:52,910
Speaker 1: But now I actually realized that most of the ones that I liked were ones that dealt with open source and Linux and the stuff that I'm interested in.

645
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,434
Speaker 1: Gasp!

646
00:45:53,616 --> 00:45:54,610
Speaker 1: That's a big surprise.

647
00:45:55,271 --> 00:46:03,730
Speaker 1: So now I actually listen to, I don't listen to any IT conversations, but I do listen to Floss Weekly, which is not so weekly.

648
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:12,550
Speaker 1: It's one of those Twit network podcasts, but it basically has Chris DeBona, who's a guy who I think worked at Slashdot, but he works at Google now.

649
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:14,169
Speaker 1: And the Leo guy.

650
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:19,030
Speaker 1: And they get like the hot shit in the open source world and they interview them.

651
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:27,570
Speaker 1: And even when they get people I never heard of, it is like every single episode of that podcast, even though it's far from weekly, is hella interesting.

652
00:46:28,191 --> 00:46:40,770
Speaker 1: Like when they interview the freaking Python guy and they interview the Open NMS guy and they get Evan Moglen, who's like the Free Software Foundation lawyer on there.

653
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:42,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, I listened to that one.

654
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:43,990
Speaker 0: He's a really interesting man.

655
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,013
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot.

656
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:51,890
Speaker 1: Every episode of that podcast, even if you don't know anything about open source software, holy shit is that one fantastic show.

657
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:53,889
Speaker 0: But I've been listening to Security now all night.

658
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,265
Speaker 1: Oh, see, there's another one that I listened to when I first started listening to podcasts.

659
00:46:57,306 --> 00:46:58,230
Speaker 1: Now I don't listen to it all.

660
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:04,510
Speaker 0: See, I listen to it very selectively because they periodically seem to get on these stints and they talk about nothing but like Vista Security.

661
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,417
Speaker 0: I don't care at all about Vista Security.

662
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:09,950
Speaker 0: I care about that less than I care about just about anything.

663
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:11,873
Speaker 0: I don't know.

664
00:47:11,893 --> 00:47:17,370
Speaker 1: There are things I care about less than Vista Security, but Vista Security is pretty low, I got to admit.

665
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:22,102
Speaker 0: But I tried to listen to it because I'm interested in law and law school and all that.

666
00:47:22,163 --> 00:47:24,630
Speaker 0: So I thought, all right, I'm going to find a law podcast.

667
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:33,350
Speaker 0: And aside from the million prepare for the LSATs, which I really don't want to bother with, I thought, hey, I'll check out This Week in Law, Twill.

668
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:35,050
Speaker 0: And I listened to two episodes.

669
00:47:37,873 --> 00:47:39,890
Speaker 1: Didn't one of those have the Calacanis guy?

670
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,025
Speaker 0: Oh, whatever, that wasn't the...

671
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:48,510
Speaker 1: I got to let everyone know, Jason Calacanis is a guy who was like a Netscape AOL big time blog guy.

672
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,839
Speaker 1: Like he had something to do with Engadget and stuff.

673
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,110
Speaker 1: He's sort of an important Internet guy.

674
00:47:53,550 --> 00:48:00,390
Speaker 1: But don't listen to any podcast he is on because he is the most annoying, interrupting, annoying guy ever.

675
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,614
Speaker 0: But there was none of that on the show.

676
00:48:01,694 --> 00:48:06,270
Speaker 0: All I got out of it is that this was the most boring podcast in the world.

677
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:06,850
Speaker 0: Really?

678
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,075
Speaker 0: And they didn't even really talk about law.

679
00:48:09,115 --> 00:48:14,690
Speaker 0: It's not like they were talking about complicated things and therefore the uneducated rim was bored by it.

680
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:16,474
Speaker 0: It was just boring.

681
00:48:16,575 --> 00:48:27,709
Speaker 0: Everyone talked in this, not even like the NPR, This Week on NPR News, we're going to... It was just, it was so boring I almost fell asleep at the wheel listening to it.

682
00:48:29,013 --> 00:48:31,929
Speaker 1: I never listened to the show, so now I'm not going to.

683
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,037
Speaker 1: I wonder if, you know what would be really cool?

684
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,030
Speaker 1: This may or may not exist, I've never searched for it.

685
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:44,210
Speaker 1: But if there was like a law podcast that just reviewed court cases that happened recently.

686
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:50,990
Speaker 1: Like, oh, This Week in Court, so and so, case of so and so, and they just talked about the case and why it was interesting.

687
00:48:51,656 --> 00:48:52,929
Speaker 1: Or even past cases.

688
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:56,749
Speaker 0: No, I just got to look more, I really just want to find a nice law review podcast.

689
00:48:57,471 --> 00:49:01,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like, this case of so and so for so and so, let's talk about it.

690
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,110
Speaker 1: Well, this guy was complaining about this shit, and this guy was complaining about this shit.

691
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:12,850
Speaker 1: In the end, this happened, and this is why, and this is the law, and this is why the judge interpreted it that way, and the jury decided this because...

692
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:18,250
Speaker 0: I imagine there are good ones out there, I just haven't, there's really still no easy way to find podcasts.

693
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,170
Speaker 0: Especially now that dig podcast searching suddenly broke.

694
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:22,669
Speaker 1: I don't know, maybe it's fixed again.

695
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:25,250
Speaker 0: I don't know, I haven't checked, but it's kind of useless.

696
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:27,750
Speaker 1: And iTunes podcast searching has never been that great.

697
00:49:28,372 --> 00:49:29,890
Speaker 0: I hate iTunes podcast searching.

698
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:32,989
Speaker 0: So yeah, if there's any good law podcast out there, let me know.

699
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be cool.

700
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,146
Speaker 1: Let's see...

701
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:39,030
Speaker 0: I tried to find a few Learn Japanese podcasts, they were all okay.

702
00:49:39,551 --> 00:49:42,730
Speaker 0: I found a Learn French podcast that was so bad I could cry.

703
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:46,669
Speaker 1: Let's see, what other podcasts am I way into?

704
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:53,930
Speaker 0: I always keep at least one Roadhouse and one Derek the Bandit, but that's just in case I need some music to listen to and I don't have any music on me.

705
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:59,350
Speaker 1: Well, I actually paid to get Roadhouse Premium that has extra songs and no ads.

706
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,430
Speaker 1: And it was totally worth it because the price was so ridiculously low.

707
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:06,449
Speaker 1: It was like 20 bucks for a year or something like that.

708
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,890
Speaker 0: I would, except I don't listen, I listen to more of my own MP3s than I do podcasts.

709
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:15,450
Speaker 1: See, that's the other thing is that I don't really load music on my iPod so much.

710
00:50:15,651 --> 00:50:21,170
Speaker 1: Just because I'd have, you know, I'd have to set up a big thing, I'd have to make playlists, and it's a whole to-do.

711
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:25,369
Speaker 1: So, and I also don't download music as frequently as I used to.

712
00:50:26,070 --> 00:50:34,330
Speaker 1: So I listen to the Roadhouse to get awesome blues music, and I listen to Derek the Bandit to get awesome trance from South Africa.

713
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,034
Speaker 1: I need, like, a rock podcast.

714
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:45,070
Speaker 1: Like, I've listened to a few, but they all sort of have that indie, like, hip alternative kind of rock.

715
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:48,930
Speaker 1: And not the old school hard rock that I like.

716
00:50:49,831 --> 00:50:55,569
Speaker 0: I've found a lot of podcasts that sound like they're about music, or they'll have music in them.

717
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:02,590
Speaker 0: Then you listen to them, and it's just some guy talking about the music for like 45 minutes, and then they play one song.

718
00:51:03,251 --> 00:51:04,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, those are no good.

719
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,250
Speaker 0: I found an awesome Happy Hardcore podcast that disappeared after three episodes.

720
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:14,290
Speaker 0: Granted, I think he was just pirating mixes, but whatever, I want my Happy Hardcore.

721
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:44,810
Speaker 1: I think the reason that, you know, of all the music podcasts, that the Roadhouse and Derek the Bandit really kind of stick around, is because they mostly play music, and there's an awesome person emceeing the music, and that awesome person comes in between songs to tell you what the song was, and maybe a few other interesting bits, but they keep it brief, and they don't overdo it, and the music they play is awesome, and within the genre, and the production value is high, so yeah.

722
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:56,090
Speaker 0: Now, scarily, and Scott has mentioned this to me independently of me noticing I've been doing it, but more often than you would expect, I find myself listening to Geek Nights.

723
00:51:56,951 --> 00:51:58,262
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do it too.

724
00:52:00,053 --> 00:52:03,469
Speaker 0: See, usually I put, like every week, I put one or two episodes on my iPod.

725
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:10,790
Speaker 0: I don't listen to them, I don't plan to listen to them, other than to spot check in my car to make sure the audio sounds okay in different settings.

726
00:52:10,911 --> 00:52:14,510
Speaker 0: Like, I'll listen to it in my work on the computer, just briefly.

727
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:16,037
Speaker 0: I'll listen to it in the car.

728
00:52:16,077 --> 00:52:22,150
Speaker 0: briefly, just to make sure that the levels are okay, whatever experiment I'm doing with the compressor didn't make anything sound bad, all that.

729
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:27,050
Speaker 0: More than half the time, I end up listening to the whole episode, and it's kind of weird.

730
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:27,532
Speaker 0: It is.

731
00:52:27,552 --> 00:52:31,230
Speaker 1: In the early days of Geek Nights, I always felt weird listening to the show.

732
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:37,810
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you know, because I hadn't done so many shows, I remembered everything I said, because it was like the third show or whatever.

733
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:43,030
Speaker 1: So listening to it was kind of like, just like, yeah, I'm here, I remember saying that, I remember saying that.

734
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,810
Speaker 1: And it wasn't entertaining or anything, I just was like, eh, alright, I'm tired of listening to myself.

735
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,950
Speaker 0: It's just kind of weird, I mean, there is something awkward about hearing your own voice on the radio.

736
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:56,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just weird and not entertaining at all.

737
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,130
Speaker 1: Nowadays, you know, sometimes I'll pop in a Geek Nights episode.

738
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,730
Speaker 1: You know, especially if it's one like, I remember like the initial D1 and the Utena one.

739
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:06,390
Speaker 0: Where we did something weird with music.

740
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:06,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, because

741
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:26,050
Speaker 1: we put lots of music in it, and I wanted to hear how the music sounded, and I listened to the show, and like, as I listened, I didn't remember everything we said, but it came back to me as I listened to it, and the music was awesome, and I was actually entertained a lot listening to my own show.

742
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:27,869
Speaker 0: Now this brings up a serious question.

743
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,269
Speaker 1: It's like more than many other podcasts I listen to.

744
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:46,550
Speaker 0: Because I overheard at, I think it was Otacon, three years, I forget, but two artists in the Artist Alley were talking about drawing pornography, and they were debating whether or not it's weird to get off from pornography that you yourself had drawn.

745
00:53:47,254 --> 00:53:48,270
Speaker 0: I see where you're going with this.

746
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,289
Speaker 0: That's a lot like where we're going with Geek Nights right now.

747
00:53:52,530 --> 00:54:00,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, if you're out there and you're a podcaster, right, tell us if you are entertained listening to your own podcast.

748
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:04,249
Speaker 1: Because we kinda are, even though we didn't used to be.

749
00:54:04,832 --> 00:54:06,249
Speaker 1: And I don't know what to think of that.

750
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:10,690
Speaker 1: Does that mean our show is so awesome that even the people who make it are entertained?

751
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,269
Speaker 0: Or are we just such fucking egoists?

752
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, what does it mean?

753
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:16,270
Speaker 1: I don't know what it means.

754
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,381
Speaker 0: Are we narcissistic?

755
00:54:17,562 --> 00:54:18,330
Speaker 0: Are we stupid?

756
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:20,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have no idea.

757
00:54:21,223 --> 00:54:22,269
Speaker 1: We need some help.

758
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:28,689
Speaker 1: You know what, if you're a person who does television, tell me if you enjoy watching your own television show.

759
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:36,830
Speaker 0: Well wasn't it, Penn Jillette was talking to one guy who apparently keeps archives of everything he's ever done on TV and watches them all the time.

760
00:54:37,472 --> 00:54:38,069
Speaker 0: Oh, alright.

761
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,009
Speaker 0: That was a while ago.

762
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,729
Speaker 1: Wait, if that guy's weird though, are we weird for people like that?

763
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:42,835
Speaker 0: I don't know if he was weird or not.

764
00:54:43,137 --> 00:54:44,605
Speaker 0: I barely listen to Penn anymore.

765
00:54:44,645 --> 00:54:45,510
Speaker 0: I listen to him like once a week.

766
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,715
Speaker 1: Yeah, I also barely listen to Penn anymore.

767
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:48,517
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is.

768
00:54:48,558 --> 00:54:53,390
Speaker 1: It just seems like after a while all the shows felt kinda the same.

769
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,890
Speaker 1: I only listen- And it was just background- it's good background noise still.

770
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:59,210
Speaker 0: I only listen when he's interviewing someone interesting.

771
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:03,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, but most of the time it's just the same old stuff and it's like, "Yes Penn, I've heard you say this before.

772
00:55:04,506 --> 00:55:04,867
Speaker 1: Yes,

773
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:05,389
Speaker 1: alright.".

774
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:08,990
Speaker 1: Yes, you know, I guess part of it is also because I can't call into the show.

775
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,790
Speaker 1: Like maybe if I was listening live it would be a little bit better because then I'd call in all the time.

776
00:55:14,031 --> 00:55:18,830
Speaker 0: Well, the only time I've ever interacted with the show, I had an argument with Michael Godot.

777
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:19,896
Speaker 1: Yeah.

778
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:30,509
Speaker 0: And basically I was trying to educate him as to some Linux things and such and he was getting kinda, "Eh, you stupid computer people, blah blah

779
00:55:30,529 --> 00:55:30,870
Speaker 0: blah."

780
00:55:31,392 --> 00:55:33,629
Speaker 0: And it ended on somewhat terse terms.

781
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:34,293
Speaker 1: Yeah.

782
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:36,118
Speaker 0: At least he responded.

783
00:55:36,461 --> 00:55:37,429
Speaker 0: I'll give him credit for that.

784
00:55:38,011 --> 00:55:39,523
Speaker 1: It's not like he's got anything better to do.

785
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:40,330
Speaker 1: He's a juggler.

786
00:55:42,184 --> 00:55:42,247
Speaker 0: Oh.

787
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:48,106
Speaker 0: But to wrap this up, I mentioned earlier a contest and we thought about this downstairs and during the show.

788
00:55:48,166 --> 00:55:49,290
Speaker 0: I thought about how I want to do this.

789
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:52,050
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna start one contest for each day of the week.

790
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:55,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'll just generally have a contest for each day of the week all the time.

791
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,210
Speaker 1: So yesterday we started the contest for MDGeist, right?

792
00:55:58,430 --> 00:55:58,631
Speaker 0: Yes.

793
00:55:58,952 --> 00:56:00,922
Speaker 0: Very briefly, listen to yesterday's episode.

794
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:02,650
Speaker 0: We'll mention it every Wednesday for a while.

795
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:04,737
Speaker 1: Wait, I think we should just do the contest.

796
00:56:04,758 --> 00:56:07,730
Speaker 1: We should only mention the contest for the day of the week that they're for.

797
00:56:08,352 --> 00:56:13,390
Speaker 0: Alright, yeah, so listen to yesterday or next Wednesday if you want to hear about the MDGeist contest.

798
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:18,810
Speaker 0: Anyway, the Thursday contest, and I'm interested in this for a number of reasons.

799
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:26,310
Speaker 0: I want you to find for us and tell us why it's bad the worst podcast out there.

800
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,669
Speaker 1: No, wait, I gotta put some restrictions on this.

801
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,990
Speaker 0: Oh, I already wrote down a bunch of restrictions.

802
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:30,670
Speaker 1: Alright, number one.

803
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:36,330
Speaker 0: Wait, it's too easy to just find like a podcast with one episode that wasn't even in iTunes.

804
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:36,812
Speaker 1: That's right.

805
00:56:36,872 --> 00:56:39,061
Speaker 1: It's gotta be a podcast that keeps going.

806
00:56:39,122 --> 00:56:41,070
Speaker 1: It has to have some sort of regularity.

807
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:49,150
Speaker 0: One, it must have at least 20 episodes online available for download in the feed.

808
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:49,950
Speaker 0: Alright.

809
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:54,002
Speaker 1: Two, it must- What if the feed is only 10 episodes but there's 20 on the site?

810
00:56:54,303 --> 00:56:55,830
Speaker 1: It's gotta be 20 episodes available.

811
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,930
Speaker 0: Alright, 20 episodes available and the feed must be active.

812
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,390
Speaker 0: Two, the feed must be listed in iTunes.

813
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:03,310
Speaker 0: Ah.

814
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,230
Speaker 0: 'Cause if you can't get yourself in iTunes, you fail this podcast.

815
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,841
Speaker 1: There are a lot of people who aren't allowed in iTunes.

816
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:11,010
Speaker 1: Like I don't think Happy House of Hentai is in there.

817
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:11,996
Speaker 1: You know, stuff like that.

818
00:57:12,258 --> 00:57:13,810
Speaker 1: So what should you do about those guys?

819
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:14,528
Speaker 0: No, leave them out.

820
00:57:14,894 --> 00:57:15,028
Speaker 1: Okay.

821
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:16,030
Speaker 0: 'Cause that's also too easy.

822
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:23,490
Speaker 1: But I know that there's like also like this pro-pedophile and there's another like pro-white supremacy podcast that aren't allowed in there.

823
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:24,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't care about that.

824
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:25,650
Speaker 0: I don't care about the content.

825
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,550
Speaker 1: 'Cause those could be the worst podcasts ever.

826
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:28,954
Speaker 0: No, 'cause I'm not talking about that.

827
00:57:29,034 --> 00:57:35,150
Speaker 0: I wanna hear the worst podcast in terms of it's just bad and unlistenable regardless of the content.

828
00:57:35,614 --> 00:57:35,710
Speaker 1: Okay.

829
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,194
Speaker 0: Not necessarily audio quality.

830
00:57:37,234 --> 00:57:38,880
Speaker 0: Maybe the people have annoying voices.

831
00:57:39,261 --> 00:57:40,826
Speaker 0: Maybe they're just so incompetent.

832
00:57:40,846 --> 00:57:41,870
Speaker 0: Maybe they don't know how to edit.

833
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:45,450
Speaker 1: Maybe it's a guy going um um um for 10 minutes and he says one sentence.

834
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:46,653
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:57:46,753 --> 00:57:50,730
Speaker 0: They also, this podcast, the worst podcast ever, has to have a website.

836
00:57:51,296 --> 00:57:51,570
Speaker 1: Alright.

837
00:57:51,971 --> 00:57:57,267
Speaker 0: And it has to have put up an episode within the last month.

838
00:57:57,949 --> 00:57:58,410
Speaker 0: At least.

839
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,371
Speaker 1: Alright.

840
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:00,193
Speaker 1: That sounds good.

841
00:58:00,373 --> 00:58:07,290
Speaker 1: Oh, and you can't like just suddenly make like 20 podcasts in one day that are as bad as you can make them.

842
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:14,810
Speaker 1: It can't be something that's made by you or anyone you know or you can't make a podcast for the purposes of winning this contest.

843
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:15,632
Speaker 0: Yeah, think of it this way.

844
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,556
Speaker 0: We want you to do recon for us.

845
00:58:17,837 --> 00:58:19,921
Speaker 0: Partly because we wanna make fun of podcasts.

846
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:23,950
Speaker 0: Partly 'cause I'm curious just how bad and deep the rabbit hole goes.

847
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:31,126
Speaker 0: Because the worst podcast I've heard I found and they had some level of respectability.

848
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:32,650
Speaker 0: But they were still crap.

849
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:36,970
Speaker 0: Yet there were podcasts that had a fraction of the listeners that they had.

850
00:58:37,494 --> 00:58:37,727
Speaker 0: Wow.

851
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,218
Speaker 0: And I can't imagine what those podcasts are.

852
00:58:40,419 --> 00:58:41,122
Speaker 0: I wanna know.

853
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:43,450
Speaker 0: I want you to find for me the bottom.

854
00:58:43,917 --> 00:58:44,709
Speaker 1: So what are they gonna win?

855
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:46,548
Speaker 0: I haven't decided that yet.

856
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,163
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do this contest.

857
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,270
Speaker 1: So how are you gonna encourage people to enter a contest to win a mystery prize?

858
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:54,937
Speaker 0: Well, because I guarantee we'll have a good prize by the end of it.

859
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:57,184
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna run this contest for at least a month.

860
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:58,930
Speaker 0: I want people to spend some time on this.

861
00:58:59,390 --> 00:58:59,711
Speaker 1: Alright.

862
00:59:00,112 --> 00:59:02,620
Speaker 1: So mystery prize.

863
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:03,824
Speaker 1: Ooh.

864
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,830
Speaker 1: It could be poop in a box.

865
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:08,209
Speaker 0: I guarantee it will not be poop in a box.

866
00:59:08,791 --> 00:59:10,450
Speaker 1: It'll be an empty box.

867
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:13,500
Speaker 0: Seriously, it'll be a real prize of some kind.

868
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,770
Speaker 0: We have a real prize for the MD Geist contest.

869
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:16,947
Speaker 1: Poop in a box.

870
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,030
Speaker 0: Well, in a manner of speaking.

871
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:20,396
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

872
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:21,925
Speaker 1: Alright.

873
00:59:22,146 --> 00:59:22,870
Speaker 1: Is this show over?

874
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:23,648
Speaker 0: I think it's over.

875
00:59:24,371 --> 00:59:28,157
Speaker 1: One last note is that we didn't mention every podcast we listen to.

876
00:59:28,638 --> 00:59:35,490
Speaker 1: But I keep my OPML on my website and you can go look at it and see what I'm subscribed to right now.

877
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:44,350
Speaker 0: And also to all of our friend podcasters, if I didn't say that I listen to your show, remember that part of that is due to the fact that I really only listen to podcasts in my car.

878
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:47,475
Speaker 0: And I'm only in my car 10 hours a week.

879
00:59:48,037 --> 00:59:52,847
Speaker 0: And I have about 30 to 40 hours a week of podcasts subscribed to.

880
00:59:53,267 --> 00:59:54,450
Speaker 0: So you can see where that goes.

881
00:59:54,910 --> 01:00:00,230
Speaker 1: Oh, and also all our friend podcasters, if Rym doesn't listen to your show, I listen to it sometimes.

882
01:00:06,672 --> 01:00:08,880
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rym and Scott.

883
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,410
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

884

885
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:29,550
Speaker 0: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week covering four different brands of geekery.

886
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:31,739
Speaker 0: Mondays are science and technology.

887
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,110
Speaker 0: Tuesdays we have video games, board games, and RPGs.

888
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:40,170
Speaker 0: Wednesdays are anime, manga, comic nights, and Thursdays are the catch-alls for various rants and tomfoolery.

889
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,709
Speaker 1: You can send us feedback by email to geeknights@frontroadcrew.com.

Speaker 1: Or you can send audio feedback via Odeo.

896

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

897
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:22,090
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
