1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,363
Speaker 2: It's Monday November 19th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,363 --> 00:00:12,668
Speaker 2: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,450
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,552
Speaker 2: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,140
Speaker 2: Tonight we have a guest on the show who would probably like to introduce himself.

6
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:21,400
Speaker 1: Hi, I'm Adam Becker and I'm a freelance astrophysicist.

7
00:00:22,282 --> 00:00:25,180
Speaker 2: That is probably one of the more badass job titles I've ever heard.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,803
Speaker 1: Well, thank you.

9
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:27,272
Speaker 1: I made it up, so...

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,538
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,640
Speaker 0: So, some of our listeners may know a person named Conrad who has been on the show once or twice before.

12
00:00:37,283 --> 00:00:40,820
Speaker 2: He's a character in Johnny Wander and he's also a real person.

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:41,940
Speaker 0: He is a real person.

14
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:45,280
Speaker 2: I knew him when he looked like an 11 year old boy.

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,720
Speaker 0: I knew him when he was wearing a safety bucket that was dressed as Naruto.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,360
Speaker 2: Yes, he was inside of one of those highway safety barrels that itself was dressed up as Naruto.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,010
Speaker 0: But anyway, you might be wondering what we're talking about Conrad.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,194
Speaker 0: You might think he's here.

19
00:00:58,214 --> 00:00:58,978
Speaker 1: He's not here.

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,132
Speaker 0: Instead he has sent a friend of his.

21
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:03,156
Speaker 0: A friend named Adam.

22
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:03,940
Speaker 0: What's up Adam?

23
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:04,819
Speaker 1: Hey, how's it going?

24
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:07,660
Speaker 0: So we met Adam 15 minutes ago maybe.

25
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,480
Speaker 2: We've done nothing but talk about embarrassing Conrad stories and teeth.

26
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,078
Speaker 1: It's true.

27
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,699
Speaker 0: So Adam seems pretty awesome and we are going to do a show with him right now.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,240
Speaker 0: So Adam, why is it, for our listeners, I mean I already know, why is it that you are so awesome and we would want you on the show?

29
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,839
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just a pretty cool guy.

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,640
Speaker 1: But I suspect that it has more to do with the fact that I am a freelance astrophysicist.

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,342
Speaker 2: Wait, wait, wait.

32
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:39,800
Speaker 2: So when you were choosing a job back in the day, you decided to go for the dream instead of the money?

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,265
Speaker 1: Pretty much, yeah.

34
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:44,080
Speaker 1: I mean I actually did apply to become an astronaut.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,367
Speaker 0: Yes.

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,680
Speaker 0: Don't you also have to be like a fighter pilot or something?

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,260
Speaker 1: There's the military track but there's also the civilian track.

38
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,000
Speaker 1: And so they sent out a solicitation for applications, oh, nine months ago.

39
00:01:55,681 --> 00:02:02,700
Speaker 1: And I looked at it and I said, okay, so I obviously don't meet the military track but civilian track, check, check, check, check.

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, I have the degrees and prerequisites.

41
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,280
Speaker 1: I can apply for this.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,880
Speaker 0: But I guess that didn't work.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,686
Speaker 0: No, it didn't work.

44
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:09,840
Speaker 1: I'm not in the space right now.

45
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,039
Speaker 1: But what I really want from that actually is the rejection letter.

46
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:16,440
Speaker 1: Because, you know, how does every rejection letter start, right?

47
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,088
Speaker 1: It starts with, you know, dear Dr.

48
00:02:19,128 --> 00:02:23,160
Speaker 1: Becker, we were very impressed with your qualifications, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

49
00:02:23,961 --> 00:02:29,940
Speaker 1: And we felt that you were very, you know, you were very well qualified for the position but we found other people that suited our needs better.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Speaker 1: And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that letter, highlight the part that says you were very qualified for the position and then frame it and say, see, NASA says that I am very well qualified to be an astronaut.

51
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,120
Speaker 1: I have it on NASA letterhead.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:52,080
Speaker 0: Well, you know, one day when they make like a documentary about you, right, for the local news, for whatever reason it's going to be, which we can't guess yet, right?

53
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,521
Speaker 0: They'll have.

54
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 0: that letter will be part of the thing, you know, like, oh, rejected as an astronaut but succeeded at this other awesome thing.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,694
Speaker 0: Stupid NASA turned this guy down.

56
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:02,640
Speaker 0: They didn't know better.

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,472
Speaker 2: Or it could be rejected as an astronaut.

58
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,640
Speaker 2: and then the explosions.

59
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:06,903
Speaker 1: Yes.

60
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:08,710
Speaker 1: Well, no, the explosions already happened.

61
00:03:09,353 --> 00:03:10,920
Speaker 1: That would be a show about what I did in college.

62
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:12,966
Speaker 1: Yeah.

63
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:15,160
Speaker 1: So I am a freelance astrophysicist.

64
00:03:15,621 --> 00:03:17,558
Speaker 0: So you're clearly way smarter than we are.

65
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:20,157
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, no, no, I don't.

66
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,630
Speaker 1: Well, so I just met you guys.

67
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:22,479
Speaker 1: I don't know how smart you are.

68
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:22,918
Speaker 2: We don't know.

69
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,919
Speaker 0: Not as smart as you.

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,183
Speaker 2: This is Geek Nights.

71
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:27,072
Speaker 2: How do you, what has Conrad told you about us?

72
00:03:27,112 --> 00:03:28,700
Speaker 2: He sent you to a stranger's house.

73
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:29,218
Speaker 2: Pretty much.

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,799
Speaker 2: In Queens.

75
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,156
Speaker 1: Yes.

76
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,980
Speaker 2: And you showed up and we had a bunch of video equipment set up.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,999
Speaker 0: Do you trust him that much?

78
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:34,879
Speaker 1: Not really.

79
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,360
Speaker 0: How do you know we weren't going to like kidnap you?

80
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,999
Speaker 1: So I only met Conrad three weeks ago.

81
00:03:38,325 --> 00:03:38,517
Speaker 0: Really?

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,017
Speaker 1: Yes.

83
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:39,373
Speaker 1: OK.

84
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,100
Speaker 1: So the story here is, well, you mentioned Johnny Wander.

85
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,119
Speaker 1: So Yuko draws Johnny Wander.

86
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:50,280
Speaker 1: And Yuko and I went to high school and middle school and elementary school together.

87
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,800
Speaker 1: We grew up in the same very tiny town in New Jersey.

88
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,880
Speaker 2: And as we realized, Yuko is the Kevin Bacon of webcomics.

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,218
Speaker 1: She basically is.

90
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:05,620
Speaker 1: But I'm, you know, in that analogy, if Yuko is the Kevin Bacon of webcomics, then I'm a truck driver.

91
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:09,058
Speaker 1: I'm not an actor in that analogy at all.

92
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,260
Speaker 1: But yeah, so I know Yuko.

93
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,449
Speaker 0: Do you know all those other people?

94
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:15,719
Speaker 0: Do you know like George Rohack?

95
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:17,105
Speaker 0: No?

96
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:17,733
Speaker 1: Oh, OK.

97
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:18,200
Speaker 1: Never mind.

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Speaker 1: What happened is I called up Yuko a few weeks back and said, hey, I'm going to be in New York City in October.

99
00:04:26,602 --> 00:04:28,820
Speaker 1: And she said, oh, great, you know, let's hang out.

100
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:29,538
Speaker 1: And we did.

101
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:34,040
Speaker 1: And I met Conrad and some of her other friends.

102
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Speaker 1: And when I did, Conrad said, hey, you, you should be in podcasts.

103
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,120
Speaker 2: Was he drunk at the time?

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,220
Speaker 1: He was not drunk.

105
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,879
Speaker 1: He might have been high on life.

106
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,679
Speaker 0: When is he not high on life?

107
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,800
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, he's basically always high on life is my impression.

108
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,980
Speaker 1: But I mean, we had a good time.

109
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,400
Speaker 1: We hung out for an afternoon and then he said, you should be in podcasts.

110
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,840
Speaker 1: I have friends who do podcasts.

111
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,360
Speaker 1: When are you going to be in the city again?

112
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,260
Speaker 2: You do have a pretty good radio voice despite just talking in your normal voice.

113
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,256
Speaker 1: Thank you.

114
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:01,399
Speaker 2: Yeah.

115
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,720
Speaker 2: I don't have to close mic you or anything weird.

116
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:04,420
Speaker 1: That's awesome.

117
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:05,912
Speaker 1: Anyway.

118
00:05:05,974 --> 00:05:06,159
Speaker 1: Yeah.

119
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:09,160
Speaker 1: So he said you should you should contact them the next time you're in town.

120
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,480
Speaker 1: And I said, well, I'm in town next month.

121
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,598
Speaker 0: And you actually did that.

122
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,220
Speaker 0: Well, we a lot of times will meet people at conventions will meet.

123
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:15,624
Speaker 0: All right.

124
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:16,540
Speaker 0: And we'll say, oh, you should do this.

125
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:16,963
Speaker 0: You do that.

126
00:05:17,003 --> 00:05:18,620
Speaker 0: But none of those things ever actually happened.

127
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,162
Speaker 1: Right.

128
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,180
Speaker 1: So I'm a freelance astrophysicist.

129
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,759
Speaker 1: If I don't actually meet people, then I don't have a job.

130
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:25,169
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

131
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:25,657
Speaker 0: Yeah.

132
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,008
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sorry.

133
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:28,440
Speaker 0: I wish I could hire you for something.

134
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,339
Speaker 1: No, don't worry about it.

135
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
Speaker 1: That may be somebody listening out there needs an astrophysicist.

136
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:33,538
Speaker 1: It's not about me.

137
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,778
Speaker 1: It's about the science.

138
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,080
Speaker 0: So let's talk about the science.

139
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,100
Speaker 0: So you're an astrophysicist, right?

140
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,920
Speaker 0: I think the email, though, said you were a computational cosmologist.

141
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:45,506
Speaker 0: Yes.

142
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:45,760
Speaker 0: Right.

143
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,760
Speaker 0: So and I guess there's also astronomer.

144
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:49,620
Speaker 0: So, you know what?

145
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,080
Speaker 0: I mean, I sort of know the difference between those three things.

146
00:05:52,623 --> 00:05:53,013
Speaker 1: OK, so.

147
00:05:54,701 --> 00:06:00,520
Speaker 1: So the story here is there's there's astronomy, there's astrophysics, there's cosmology.

148
00:06:01,664 --> 00:06:02,815
Speaker 0: Is there anything else I'm missing?

149
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:03,360
Speaker 0: Is there another one?

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,033
Speaker 1: I mean, you know.

151
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:05,017
Speaker 2: Astrology?

152
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,610
Speaker 1: Yes.

153
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,380
Speaker 1: That doesn't count.

154
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Speaker 1: I was going to get to astrology in a moment.

155
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:10,240
Speaker 0: We are well aware.

156
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:10,720
Speaker 1: Yes.

157
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:32,540
Speaker 1: So the the general story is if if you think that stars are small to medium sized objects and that galaxies, you know, hundreds of thousands of light years across or tens of thousands of light years across are very big objects, then you're probably an astronomer or an astrophysicist.

158
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Speaker 1: Whereas if you think that galaxies are very tiny, maybe point sized objects and the universe is very large, then you are probably a cosmologist.

159
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:51,020
Speaker 1: But the lines are fuzzy and it's not wrong to call anybody in any of those fields an astrophysicist because that's sort of a blanket term.

160
00:06:51,480 --> 00:07:09,060
Speaker 1: And the other thing is outside of, you know, academia and conferences and whatnot, anyone who's an astronomer or a cosmologist or an astrophysicist usually self-identifies as an astrophysicist, because if you say that you're an astronomer, people will think you're an astrologer and ask you about their horoscope.

161
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,320
Speaker 0: Oh, I mean, non-science people will think that.

162
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:18,340
Speaker 1: Well, but if you say that you're a cosmologist, people will think you're a cosmetologist and start asking you about makeup.

163
00:07:19,383 --> 00:07:20,959
Speaker 2: I was going to make a joke about Cosmo.

164
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, don't.

165
00:07:24,915 --> 00:07:25,840
Speaker 1: Goodness, that's so clever.

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,300
Speaker 0: I was thinking, you know, if you were saying this, you know, I was assuming that you were going to identify yourself to a smart person and that you would say astrophysicist because that's more impressive, right?

167
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,660
Speaker 0: We tend to look at like the biggest people in science or astrophysicists like the Stephen Hawkings in that, right?

168
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,439
Speaker 0: You know, so if you were just like an astronomer, that sort of, I guess, you know, seems like a not as prestigious word.

169
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:51,620
Speaker 1: It's got physicists right there in the word, which leads to a lot less confusion.

170
00:07:51,900 --> 00:08:01,300
Speaker 1: I guess it makes it sound more impressive, but mostly it's that if you say astrophysicist, people know that you are working with a lot of math and not with horoscopes.

171
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,040
Speaker 0: OK, so let's let's talk about the computational part of this.

172
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:07,924
Speaker 0: Right.

173
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:09,455
Speaker 1: So basically what I...

174
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,199
Speaker 0: That's what we know about that.

175
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:11,490
Speaker 0: Sure.

176
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,458
Speaker 0: That's the part we know.

177
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:28,480
Speaker 1: So in my research, what I do is the one sentence explanation is I try to figure out how much we can learn about the way stuff was arranged in the very, very early universe by looking at the way stuff is arranged in the universe right now.

178
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,540
Speaker 2: So like the distribution of galaxies.

179
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 1: Distribution, like looking at the distribution of galaxies in the universe right now, we're looking at what's called the cosmic microwave background radiation, which is the oldest light in the universe.

180
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:54,780
Speaker 1: But even though that's the oldest light in the universe, it's still from four hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, which is which is pretty good when you realize that we're now thirteen point eight billion years after the Big Bang.

181
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,859
Speaker 1: So that's, you know, pretty far back.

182
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,600
Speaker 1: But we want to know what the universe looked like a fraction of a second after the Big Bang.

183
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,179
Speaker 2: All right, hot shot.

184
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,799
Speaker 2: So where'd all the light go from that?

185
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,198
Speaker 1: Where'd all the light go?

186
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:07,899
Speaker 1: Was it between a fraction of a second?

187
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:14,300
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, so there's the four hundred thousand year gap between zero and the background radiation, right?

188
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,539
Speaker 0: So was there just no light then?

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,957
Speaker 1: The universe was opaque.

190
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,500
Speaker 1: The universe was not transparent.

191
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,460
Speaker 1: So, you know, right now we look up in the sky, we can see light.

192
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,860
Speaker 1: You can see with your naked eye light from the Andromeda Galaxy.

193
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,640
Speaker 1: That's two million light years away.

194
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 0: Because the vacuum of space is transparent.

195
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, the vacuum of space is transparent.

196
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,780
Speaker 1: There might be some stuff in the way, you know, you might get some gas and dust, but on average, the universe is a pretty sparsely populated place.

197
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:49,700
Speaker 1: You know, the average number of atoms in a cubic meter of space is something on the order of a tenth of an atom.

198
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,117
Speaker 1: It's not very much.

199
00:09:52,340 --> 00:10:06,140
Speaker 1: So anyway, but way back when, in the early days, the universe was not transparent to light because it was a lot hotter and denser because the universe was smaller.

200
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,200
Speaker 1: You know, the universe has been expanding, as you might know, it's been in a few papers.

201
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:14,480
Speaker 1: And so that means as things expand, they get cooler.

202
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:30,700
Speaker 1: So if you go back to the very, very early days, the universe was very, very hot and filled with, among other things, electrons and atomic nuclei because it was too hot for atoms to form.

203
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:35,380
Speaker 1: And so the thing about atoms is they're neutral.

204
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:42,000
Speaker 1: Whereas the thing about electrons and atomic nuclei is they're not neutral.

205
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,079
Speaker 1: And so light interacts with them.

206
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,980
Speaker 1: Light will not just pass right through them or right by them.

207
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:53,820
Speaker 1: And so the universe was so dense and charged that light couldn't pass through it easily.

208
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,934
Speaker 1: And so light was sort of trapped for the first 400,000 years.

209
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:03,820
Speaker 0: Any photons that any sort of reaction was emitting were absorbed or bouncing around and were not, you know, so they're all gone.

210
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,180
Speaker 0: You know, they're not flying around in space still.

211
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:07,581
Speaker 0: I mean, is there?

212
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:17,700
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess like what are the odds that like, you know, a photon from then would have like, you know, only bounced off things and somehow, you know, escaped and be able to be detected now.

213
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:18,143
Speaker 0: Right.

214
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,959
Speaker 1: It's like, I mean, those photons were trapped.

215
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,260
Speaker 1: I mean, talking about a photon bouncing around versus talking about a photon being absorbed and re-emitted is a little it's a fuzzy distinction there.

216
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,096
Speaker 1: But but those photons were trapped for 400,000 years.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:43,480
Speaker 1: And then finally, the universe expanded and cooled off enough for atoms to form, at which point the universe became transparent and the photons were freed.

218
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,340
Speaker 1: And at the time they were in the infrared.

219
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:55,640
Speaker 1: But in the intervening 13.8 billion years, the universe has expanded so much that it has stretched that light out into the microwave.

220
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,380
Speaker 1: And so that's the cosmic microwave background radiation.

221
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,739
Speaker 1: If you if you've still got a TV with an antenna and you turn it to a dead channel, which I guess would be all of them.

222
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:16,120
Speaker 1: now, and you turn the brightness way down, that about one percent of the little white specks that will show up on your screen come from the cosmic microwave background radiation.

223
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,960
Speaker 0: I don't think you're using a TV, though, for your research, right?

224
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,797
Speaker 0: You're using some kind of fancy telescope or satellite or something?

225
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, TVs are how you find poltergeists.

226
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,119
Speaker 1: Again, astrophysics, not astrology.

227
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,100
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I'm not an observational cosmologist.

228
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,160
Speaker 1: I'm a computational cosmologist, so I don't look through telescopes.

229
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,660
Speaker 1: I don't build telescopes or satellites to collect data.

230
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,420
Speaker 1: I take the data and I crunch it with a computer.

231
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:53,060
Speaker 1: So the instrument that I use the most often, aside from, you know, pencil and paper, is a MacBook Pro.

232
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:10,700
Speaker 1: But the the stuff that we use to collect the data these days is usually, well, for the cosmic microwave background radiation, our best data comes either from satellites that are way out in space and not even orbiting Earth.

233
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:21,780
Speaker 1: They're out at what's called a Lagrange point, so they don't get interference from Earth and they take full sky pictures in the microwave range.

234
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:29,660
Speaker 1: Or from ground-based surveys from, you know, really well-situated telescopes.

235
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 1: Like, there's a nice telescope at the South Pole that is taking really detailed pictures of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

236
00:13:36,562 --> 00:13:40,220
Speaker 1: But the thing is, you can't get a full sky picture from the ground.

237
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:41,439
Speaker 0: That's true.

238
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,935
Speaker 1: And that's not so good.

239
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,100
Speaker 1: We need full sky pictures.

240
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,760
Speaker 1: We also need really detailed pictures of the sort that you can only get from the ground, so we need both.

241
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,578
Speaker 1: So I take that data and crunch it.

242
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,853
Speaker 2: So what kind of software, like what kind of tool would you use to crunch?

243
00:13:57,873 --> 00:13:59,220
Speaker 2: I mean, how much data even is that?

244
00:13:59,945 --> 00:14:00,396
Speaker 1: It's a lot.

245
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,320
Speaker 0: Does it take a long time to download from the satellite in space?

246
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:07,371
Speaker 1: I don't know how long it takes to download from the satellite in space.

247
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,200
Speaker 1: I mostly download it from websites.

248
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:10,079
Speaker 1: That's a good idea.

249
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:13,040
Speaker 1: They've already downloaded it from the satellite.

250
00:14:13,621 --> 00:14:17,079
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I don't know what the bandwidth of the connection out to a Lagrange point is.

251
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:29,520
Speaker 1: But, yeah, basically, yeah, I get this data, and there are some pre-existing software packages that will crunch it for me somewhat.

252
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,960
Speaker 1: There's something called HealPix, which this is getting real technical.

253
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,839
Speaker 0: How do you spell that?

254
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,480
Speaker 1: H-E-A-L-P-I-X, HealPix.

255
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,440
Speaker 1: So, yeah, HealPix is basically a package for crunching this data.

256
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:49,906
Speaker 1: But it will only crunch it so far.

257
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:55,120
Speaker 1: It basically lets you display the data, and it also lets you do various simple transformations on it.

258
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:05,220
Speaker 1: It's also a format for taking the entire sky and basically pixelating it, because, you know, you've got something that's not flat.

259
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:10,056
Speaker 1: Now you need to display it as a set of pixels and deal with it.

260
00:15:10,136 --> 00:15:11,039
Speaker 1: So how are you going to do that?

261
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:12,734
Speaker 1: So there's that.

262
00:15:15,421 --> 00:15:18,460
Speaker 1: But then a lot of what I end up doing is writing code to do further analysis.

263
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,000
Speaker 1: Because, you know, something like HealPix or some other software package that someone else wrote will only take you so far.

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,934
Speaker 1: If I want to do...

265
00:15:25,281 --> 00:15:27,060
Speaker 0: And it's also work that someone's already done.

266
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,900
Speaker 0: So running the data through the same software someone else already wrote is going to get you the answer someone else has already found.

267
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,766
Speaker 1: Essentially, yeah.

268
00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:34,540
Speaker 1: So I want to do something fundamentally new.

269
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,420
Speaker 1: That means I have to, at the very least, take the results of that other person's software package and run it through my own software, which is a lot of what I do.

270
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,800
Speaker 1: So I write a lot of Python code.

271
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:46,480
Speaker 0: I also write a lot of Python code.

272
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, Python code is... Much easier to write for me than for you.

273
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,700
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there are some Python packages like NumPy and SciPy that make it a lot easier.

274
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,560
Speaker 1: And then when you want to actually write a paper, there's Matplotlib, which helps a lot as well.

275
00:16:01,384 --> 00:16:04,620
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I write a lot of Python code.

276
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:14,660
Speaker 1: And then I sometimes have to edit other people's C code, or on really bad days I have to edit other people's Fortran code, which is my least favorite thing in the world.

277
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:24,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a software package that's written entirely in Fortran and has almost no comments, but it's also the best package of its kind.

278
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:30,560
Speaker 1: And sometimes it's easier to sort of modify that package rather than try to replicate it myself.

279
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,820
Speaker 0: See, in cases like that, I always wonder, like, somebody could just go in and, like, line by line translate it to, like, some other language, you know?

280
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,696
Speaker 0: Even if it's like, you know, Fortran's not object-oriented, but it's like, you know, you can write non-object-oriented Python, right?

281
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:44,859
Speaker 0: You can just go through...

282
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,280
Speaker 1: Well, actually, frighteningly, there is a way to do object-oriented Fortran, and I wish I didn't know that.

283
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,096
Speaker 1: I did not know that.

284
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:04,760
Speaker 1: But, yeah, you could do that if you had a lot of time and nothing better to do, which I can't imagine anyone in the world is ever in that situation.

285
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,960
Speaker 2: Scott, that's the thing that some people might do or believe.

286
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,999
Speaker 0: There are people.

287
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I suppose that's true.

288
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,025
Speaker 2: So what kinds of things do you look for?

289
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:20,599
Speaker 2: Like, what's something you recently, you know, you're crunching this data, and we're talking in very high levels right now, but, like, what's the kind of thing you're actually looking for or trying to find?

290
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:21,796
Speaker 1: Well, okay, so...

291
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,680
Speaker 2: Or trying to prove, or whatever it is you're going for.

292
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:36,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, so going back to that one-sentence description of, you know, I look for stuff in the universe right now to try to figure out what the universe looked like right after the Big Bang.

293
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:43,880
Speaker 1: Specifically, the stuff I end up looking for, it's not like I'm looking for a particular galaxy cluster.

294
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:49,272
Speaker 1: The laws that govern the universe at this level are mostly statistical.

295
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:52,540
Speaker 1: So what I end up looking for are statistical quantities.

296
00:17:55,281 --> 00:18:04,342
Speaker 1: So, specifically, what I've been looking for lately, and now I guess this gets slightly technical, there's a question... Yeah, okay, fine.

297
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:10,964
Speaker 1: So there's the question of how... You know what?

298
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,820
Speaker 1: No, I'm going to back up for a second.

299
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:23,030
Speaker 1: The theory of general relativity from Albert Einstein describes the universe on the very largest scales.

300
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,910
Speaker 1: And it also just tells us how gravity works on smaller scales, but we can use it to describe the universe on largest scales.

301
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:45,350
Speaker 1: And there's a set of equations that go along with general relativity, and you can sort of basically put in the universe that you have, or put in certain conditions about the universe, and those equations will pop out a solution, which describes where you live.

302
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:57,010
Speaker 1: And to describe the universe on the very largest scales, we usually punch into those equations the assumptions that the universe is what's called isotropic and homogeneous.

303
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,899
Speaker 1: So it looks the same in all directions everywhere.

304
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:03,530
Speaker 1: And on very large scales, this is an extremely good assumption.

305
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,224
Speaker 1: If you take a picture of the universe on really large scales, it's kind of smooth.

306
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:10,430
Speaker 1: The universe looks the same everywhere.

307
00:19:11,052 --> 00:19:15,768
Speaker 1: The problem is, that's certainly not true at small scales, otherwise we wouldn't be here.

308
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,585
Speaker 1: And remember, I said the universe is pretty sparsely populated.

309
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:20,570
Speaker 1: Well, not here.

310
00:19:21,531 --> 00:19:25,850
Speaker 1: We have a lot more atoms here per cubic meter than you do out in intergalactic space.

311
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:33,610
Speaker 2: So in any given direction, the cosmic background radiation is uniform, but then close up, there's a galaxy here and there isn't one mirrored on the other side.

312
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,191
Speaker 1: Exactly.

313
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:39,845
Speaker 1: And even the cosmic microwave background radiation, it's not actually uniform in all directions.

314
00:19:40,026 --> 00:19:41,650
Speaker 1: It has tiny little variations.

315
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,563
Speaker 1: And so that's interesting, because the variations we have now are not tiny.

316
00:19:46,924 --> 00:19:48,590
Speaker 1: The variations we have now are huge.

317
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:52,939
Speaker 1: It's not a fraction of an atom per cubic meter here.

318
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,230
Speaker 1: It's something like 10 to the 23 or more atoms per cubic meter here.

319
00:19:57,711 --> 00:20:06,590
Speaker 1: Whereas if you go and look at the cosmic microwave background radiation, you see differences, but those differences are like one part in 10,000.

320
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,479
Speaker 0: But is that one part in 10,000, like an echo of?

321
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,000
Speaker 0: back?

322
00:20:11,061 --> 00:20:15,070
Speaker 0: then there was a huge lump in a place which causes a very small lump now?

323
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,697
Speaker 0: How does it correlate?

324
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,710
Speaker 0: Like if you see that in the background radiation now, what does that tell you about what was there then?

325
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:32,531
Speaker 1: It tells you that what was there then was a piece of the universe that was slightly more or less lumpy to the tune of one part in about 100,000.

326
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,895
Speaker 1: The relationship is proportional.

327
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:42,530
Speaker 1: So the question is, how do we get from these tiny little lumps to the incredibly lumpy universe we live in now?

328
00:20:43,171 --> 00:20:45,513
Speaker 1: The answer to that turns out to be pretty easy to understand.

329
00:20:45,573 --> 00:20:46,454
Speaker 1: It's just gravity.

330
00:20:47,254 --> 00:21:03,930
Speaker 1: If you just throw gravity into a slightly lumpy universe and let that universe evolve for 13.8 billion years, what's going to happen is the slightly denser places will attract more matter, and the slightly less dense places will have matter fall away from them.

331
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:10,130
Speaker 1: And eventually, after a few billion years, you end up with stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters.

332
00:21:10,512 --> 00:21:12,099
Speaker 2: Alright, but that puts us to an earlier order.

333
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:12,561
Speaker 2: question then.

334
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:14,490
Speaker 2: Where did that original slight lumpiness come from?

335
00:21:14,671 --> 00:21:15,470
Speaker 1: And that's exactly it.

336
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:20,688
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, is it a false assumption that it was originally perfectly smooth, or was there, you know...

337
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,290
Speaker 1: Well, so those are active research questions.

338
00:21:23,374 --> 00:21:23,650
Speaker 1: Alright.

339
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,870
Speaker 1: That's essentially where I work on them.

340
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,830
Speaker 2: Man, you scientists never have any answers.

341
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:31,450
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so we have, actually the real problem is we have too many and we don't know which one's right.

342
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:36,610
Speaker 1: We have many, many, many, many, many different theories about where there's too many differences came from.

343
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:44,370
Speaker 0: What are like, you know, three or four, you know, a few of the big ones that are getting a lot of, that people seem to think are right and aren't crazy kooks?

344
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:45,854
Speaker 1: So there's one big one.

345
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,099
Speaker 1: There's one really big one.

346
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:50,410
Speaker 1: And this is something called inflation.

347
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,207
Speaker 0: Okay.

348
00:21:52,311 --> 00:22:04,970
Speaker 1: And the basic idea is, okay, in the very early universe, the very, very early universe, a fraction of a fraction of a second, a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second after the Big Bang.

349
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:14,640
Speaker 1: There was a brief period where the universe expanded very, very rapidly.

350
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:20,528
Speaker 1: You know, expanded something like 10 to the 50 times.

351
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,685
Speaker 1: So it expanded by a factor of a one with 50 zeros after it.

352
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:29,330
Speaker 1: Something like that.

353
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,730
Speaker 1: So, sorry, it might be a one with 20 zeros after it, but it doesn't really matter.

354
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:40,169
Speaker 0: The point is, is that there are a lot of zeros in less than a second.

355
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, a hell of a lot of zeros, yeah.

356
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:47,150
Speaker 1: So the point is, for a very, very brief fraction of a second, the universe expanded a hell of a lot and then that stopped.

357
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,890
Speaker 1: And it continued to expand after that, just not nearly as quickly.

358
00:22:51,171 --> 00:22:59,450
Speaker 1: So the interesting thing here is what that would do, I mean, that does a lot of things and solves a lot of problems and brings up other problems.

359
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:11,330
Speaker 1: But what that does for this question of where did the original tiny limpiness come from is it says, OK, well, quantum mechanics is the set of rules that govern the universe on really tiny scales.

360
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,577
Speaker 1: And quantum mechanics says that sometimes crap just happens.

361
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:19,003
Speaker 1: Quantum mechanics is what we call fundamentally stochastic.

362
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,430
Speaker 1: There's randomness in the universe at a very low level.

363
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:29,350
Speaker 1: So if we were looking at something really tiny and we saw tiny differences all over the place, we'd say, well, we don't really need an explanation for that.

364
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:33,110
Speaker 1: That can be explained just by the nature of quantum mechanics.

365
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:51,910
Speaker 1: So what inflation says is, OK, yeah, so there are these tiny differences, but then the universe expanded so rapidly that those tiny differences got expanded up and turned into tiny differences on a macroscopic scale, on a scale bigger than the scales that quantum mechanics really deals with.

366
00:23:52,672 --> 00:23:54,416
Speaker 1: And so they kind of got frozen in.

367
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:59,109
Speaker 1: So basically, and this is this is a direct quote from.

368
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:11,750
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to forget someone famous said that basically these tiny little differences in the cosmic microwave background radiation are quantum mechanics writ large on the sky.

369
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,117
Speaker 1: So that is that is a very popular theory inflation.

370
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:17,501
Speaker 1: for explaining this.

371
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:21,230
Speaker 1: There is one problem, which is, well, two problems.

372
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,985
Speaker 1: The first is what drove that period of rapid inflation?

373
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:27,450
Speaker 1: And second.

374
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,593
Speaker 1: Which inflation?

375
00:24:31,613 --> 00:24:38,590
Speaker 1: Because it turns out that if you try to answer the first question, you can answer it in dozens and dozens and dozens of different ways.

376
00:24:39,951 --> 00:24:56,010
Speaker 1: And that's that it's difficult to distinguish between those different theories of inflation, because we're talking about a period in the universe's history that is not only before the oldest light, but also before the oldest atoms.

377
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:03,010
Speaker 1: Atomic nuclei were formed in in the universe between three and 20 minutes after the Big Bang.

378
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:12,310
Speaker 1: So it's it's older than anything that has survived until the current time, except for those tiny fluctuations themselves.

379
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:28,030
Speaker 1: So by studying the way stuff is arranged in the universe right now, we can learn more about the distribution of those tiny fluctuations and thereby hopefully learn more about what kind of inflation happened or if inflation happened at all.

380
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,318
Speaker 0: This is a joke for him.

381
00:25:29,439 --> 00:25:31,110
Speaker 0: It's the darkness that came before.

382
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:33,715
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

383
00:25:33,796 --> 00:25:35,103
Speaker 0: I know you're not supposed to get that joke.

384
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:35,767
Speaker 1: It's OK.

385
00:25:35,807 --> 00:25:36,109
Speaker 0: That's OK.

386
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:49,330
Speaker 2: We argue a lot about the nature of, well, not necessarily free will, but causality in the sense that if I mean, you're basically what you've said from this theory is that quantum mechanics effectively, if you zoom in far enough, things are random.

387
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,434
Speaker 2: We don't know or care why.

388
00:25:51,337 --> 00:25:54,730
Speaker 2: Or if we do care, that's a separate field of inquiry.

389
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:57,969
Speaker 1: I think the second one is where I'm going to go with that, because I care very much.

390
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,888
Speaker 1: Other people may not.

391
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:08,288
Speaker 2: But that is a question that for the intent, the purpose of discussion, most scientists will say when talking about these other things, we don't know why.

392
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:09,070
Speaker 2: And that's separate.

393
00:26:09,732 --> 00:26:10,538
Speaker 1: Yes, that is it is.

394
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:12,210
Speaker 1: We don't you know, it is separate.

395
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,961
Speaker 1: Some people say that we do know why.

396
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:15,050
Speaker 1: Other people say that we don't.

397
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:20,350
Speaker 1: There's a whole field called Foundations of Quantum Mechanics, which deals with this kind of thing, but it's not relevant.

398
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:28,830
Speaker 2: So we imply that on the macro scale, that things happen in a deterministic fashion in the sense that we can predict, you know, gravity and all these things.

399
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:35,590
Speaker 2: We could theoretically predict how macro bodies will react to events and they'll always react to the exact same event in the exact same way.

400
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,431
Speaker 1: Kind of.

401
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:41,838
Speaker 2: Or is it that they won't because we can't perfectly recreate?

402
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:48,890
Speaker 2: or is it that they won't because those tiny fluctuations we're ignoring actually make it impossible for the same thing to happen twice?

403
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,905
Speaker 1: So, yes, is essentially the answer to your question.

404
00:26:54,925 --> 00:26:55,829
Speaker 1: Let me give you.

405
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:57,730
Speaker 0: He's trying to ask philosophy questions.

406
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, asking philosophy questions is fine.

407
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,050
Speaker 2: No, but in a very direct, I only want the physics answer.

408
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,150
Speaker 1: OK, well, so first of all, to toot my own horn a little bit more, I actually do have a degree in philosophy.

409
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:08,401
Speaker 1: Oh, fancy.

410
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,948
Speaker 1: No, I did my undergrad.

411
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,610
Speaker 0: He's got a whole bucket full of horns.

412
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:12,213
Speaker 0: It's true.

413
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:13,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.

414
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:15,770
Speaker 1: I did my undergrad in philosophy and in physics.

415
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,650
Speaker 1: So it's a bachelor's degree, which, oh, but, you know, that's all I got.

416
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:21,305
Speaker 1: One of those.

417
00:27:22,832 --> 00:27:25,330
Speaker 1: No, I'm not not belittling one horn.

418
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:27,830
Speaker 2: He gets to wear the the octagon hat.

419
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:28,942
Speaker 2: I only get to wear the square head.

420
00:27:29,124 --> 00:27:29,590
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

421
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,880
Speaker 1: No, I didn't wear any hat.

422
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,030
Speaker 1: Those hats are expensive.

423
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,096
Speaker 1: Really?

424
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:33,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're really expensive.

425
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,608
Speaker 0: I didn't even pay for one, Rym just like grabbed one for free.

426
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:38,609
Speaker 0: I didn't even go to the.

427
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:40,130
Speaker 1: The octagon hats are expensive.

428
00:27:40,873 --> 00:27:43,968
Speaker 1: My parents said, so are you going to walk for graduation when you get your

429
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:44,290
Speaker 1: Ph.D.?

430
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,390
Speaker 1: ?

431
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:50,050
Speaker 0: I said, no, I guess when you're only when you're only freelance astrophysicist, they don't give you the free hand.

432
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,523
Speaker 2: Well, Scott, he has to pay like 10 talents to.

433
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,709
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

434
00:27:58,393 --> 00:28:01,830
Speaker 1: I do not have to pay 10 talents in order to get back into the school of magic.

435
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,010
Speaker 1: OK, so you've read that.

436
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:06,262
Speaker 0: Well, you got one fantasy joke out of.

437
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:08,150
Speaker 2: that was just the book club book.

438
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:08,812
Speaker 2: Sorry.

439
00:28:08,873 --> 00:28:09,234
Speaker 1: Yes.

440
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,550
Speaker 1: See, and I was trying to remember the name and I forgot anyway.

441
00:28:18,434 --> 00:28:18,475
Speaker 1: So.

442
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:18,918
Speaker 1: Right.

443
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:19,905
Speaker 1: Where were we?

444
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:20,610
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

445
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,052
Speaker 1: I don't.

446
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:21,736
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

447
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:22,943
Speaker 1: The hats are expensive.

448
00:28:23,103 --> 00:28:23,687
Speaker 2: Causality.

449
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:24,250
Speaker 1: Causality.

450
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:24,790
Speaker 1: Right.

451
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:35,170
Speaker 2: How come if we do the exact same macro event, the exact same result does not always happen in the in the grand tradition of physics problems that you probably remember from high school.

452
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:38,730
Speaker 1: This is a slightly idealized setup, but really only slightly.

453
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,532
Speaker 1: Imagine that you have the perfect pencil.

454
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:52,950
Speaker 1: And when I say you have the perfect pencil, I mean, you have a pencil that comes to, you know, an atomic point at the bottom, which is actually not a terrible assumption because graphite is pretty interesting as the thing go.

455
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,249
Speaker 2: But so we're talking like it is one plank.

456
00:28:57,032 --> 00:29:00,250
Speaker 0: So it's basically as sharp as a thing could be as sharp as a thing.

457
00:29:00,511 --> 00:29:04,150
Speaker 0: There's one atom at the end of it and all of the other atoms are sort of behind that one.

458
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,733
Speaker 0: Exactly.

459
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:05,799
Speaker 1: So, no, not one plank.

460
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,710
Speaker 1: That's a hell of a lot smaller.

461
00:29:07,911 --> 00:29:08,658
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

462
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:09,909
Speaker 2: I've not made like some sort of.

463
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,574
Speaker 2: Yeah.

464
00:29:10,675 --> 00:29:12,608
Speaker 0: It's not a neutrino at the bottom.

465
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:12,830
Speaker 0: Right.

466
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,128
Speaker 1: It's not a subtle knife.

467
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:17,690
Speaker 2: Scott has not read the Golden Compass.

468
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:18,356
Speaker 1: Ah, OK.

469
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:18,944
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

470
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:19,288
Speaker 1: Anyway.

471
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:19,389
Speaker 1: No.

472
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,189
Speaker 0: So we're at the same fantasy score now.

473
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:21,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

474
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,013
Speaker 1: There we go.

475
00:29:22,154 --> 00:29:25,450
Speaker 1: So it's but it's an atomically perfect pencil.

476
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:25,935
Speaker 1: OK.

477
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:26,101
Speaker 1: OK.

478
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,802
Speaker 1: So this thing is standing.

479
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:31,415
Speaker 1: OK.

480
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:32,649
Speaker 1: You have it standing on its point.

481
00:29:33,136 --> 00:29:33,989
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not standing on the eraser.

482
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:34,909
Speaker 1: It's not standing on the eraser.

483
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,449
Speaker 1: That would be a lot easier.

484
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,361
Speaker 2: So what's it standing on?

485
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:37,990
Speaker 2: Is there another atom?

486
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:38,675
Speaker 1: No.

487
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:40,130
Speaker 1: I mean, it's standing on a table.

488
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:40,713
Speaker 1: OK.

489
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:40,963
Speaker 1: Right.

490
00:29:40,984 --> 00:29:41,088
Speaker 1: OK.

491
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:41,890
Speaker 1: So what atoms?

492
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,688
Speaker 1: Anyway, the this is this is the idea.

493
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,140
Speaker 1: Classically, you know, if you do Newton's laws of motion, you can say, OK, yeah, well, this is what we call an unstable equilibrium.

494
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:03,200
Speaker 1: If you if you tip it slightly in either direction or if it's moving slightly in either direction when you let go of it, it's going to fall over.

495
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:09,840
Speaker 1: But if you can get it to just not move and get it perfectly straight up and down, in theory, it'll just stay there forever.

496
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,379
Speaker 0: There's no there's no wind.

497
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:12,960
Speaker 1: There's no wind or anything like that.

498
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:13,441
Speaker 1: Yeah.

499
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:14,700
Speaker 1: But pretend there is no wind.

500
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,640
Speaker 1: There's no table shaking.

501
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:19,060
Speaker 1: And it's just somehow in this perfect room on Earth, there is gravity.

502
00:30:19,441 --> 00:30:22,880
Speaker 0: And the entire pencil itself would also have to be perfectly uniform.

503
00:30:23,461 --> 00:30:25,178
Speaker 1: He said it was a perfect pencil.

504
00:30:25,581 --> 00:30:27,040
Speaker 2: That was like the first assumption.

505
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,880
Speaker 1: You know, the the gravitational field would have to be perfectly uniform.

506
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,299
Speaker 1: Anyway, say that all of that's true.

507
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,980
Speaker 1: But, you know, Newtonian physics would then say if you somehow did that, the pencil should stand up forever.

508
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:41,360
Speaker 1: But quantum mechanics says otherwise.

509
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:53,520
Speaker 1: Quantum mechanics says, well, you can't do that because in order to get the pencil to stand straight up and stay there, you have to get the top of the pencil sitting directly over the bottom of the pencil.

510
00:30:55,882 --> 00:31:01,560
Speaker 1: And you have to when you let go of it, not only have that in the right position, but you have to not impart any momentum to it.

511
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,920
Speaker 1: You have to not have it be moving.

512
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:12,500
Speaker 1: And Heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that you cannot know the position and the momentum of something with perfect accuracy.

513
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,240
Speaker 0: Oh, so you can only do one or the other.

514
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,520
Speaker 1: You can do one or the other or you can compromise on both.

515
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,919
Speaker 1: So the question is, if you compromise on both, which turns out to be the best thing, what's the maximum amount of time that you could get this perfect pencil, perfect pencil to stand straight up?

516
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,800
Speaker 1: So what's the quantum mechanical limit on how long the pencil can stand straight up?

517
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,519
Speaker 1: Do you guys want to guess?

518
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,379
Speaker 0: So as soon as the pencil leans a little bit, time's up.

519
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,225
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not time's up.

520
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:41,280
Speaker 1: It's how long is it going to take for the pencil to go from here to like here?

521
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,040
Speaker 1: You know, an appreciable fraction away from straight up.

522
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,140
Speaker 0: This is the perfect pencil.

523
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,340
Speaker 1: This is the perfect pencil.

524
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,520
Speaker 0: And you did the best job you could.

525
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,340
Speaker 1: You did the best job physically possible.

526
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:57,420
Speaker 1: And this is the question of, OK, so what impact does quantum mechanics have on what is, frankly, a really big pencil?

527
00:31:57,661 --> 00:32:01,040
Speaker 0: I'm trying to imagine how long it takes for a regular pencil to fall over.

528
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,486
Speaker 2: I'm going to say something ridiculous.

529
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:05,200
Speaker 2: I don't know, 10 to the six years.

530
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:05,810
Speaker 1: OK.

531
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:07,759
Speaker 0: Oh, you're saying a really long time, rim?

532
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,079
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm saying a really long time, but it'll eventually happen.

533
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:10,581
Speaker 1: Right.

534
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:12,700
Speaker 1: And I mean, so this is a reasonable guess, right?

535
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,560
Speaker 1: Because quantum mechanics, yeah, this is a reasonable guess because quantum mechanics, you know, should take a while to affect something giant like that.

536
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,580
Speaker 1: But you're actually totally wrong.

537
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was waiting for you to say, but I was going to guess about the same time it takes for a regular pencil.

538
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,471
Speaker 1: That's actually about right.

539
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:28,260
Speaker 1: It's four seconds.

540
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,220
Speaker 2: OK, so see, listeners, that's why the pre hoc is dangerous.

541
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:42,420
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if it doesn't matter how long you want to balance your pencil for, you're not going to do it for more than four seconds, unless, of course, you don't have the perfect pencil.

542
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:45,640
Speaker 1: If your pencil is not sharp enough, all of this goes out the window.

543
00:32:45,880 --> 00:33:01,360
Speaker 1: But the point is, quantum mechanics can actually affect initial conditions in life enough to introduce an element of quantum mechanical random crap into your setup.

544
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,859
Speaker 1: And so things won't be deterministic.

545
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,220
Speaker 2: So there's no causality and stuff just happens.

546
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,247
Speaker 2: We can correlate.

547
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:07,699
Speaker 2: We can correlate, it sounds like.

548
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:17,300
Speaker 1: So so even even if you want to say that, that that means that we don't have a way of understanding causality at the quantum mechanical level.

549
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,120
Speaker 1: And now we're getting into foundations of quantum mechanics and you don't really want to do that.

550
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,521
Speaker 0: OK.

551
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:22,089
Speaker 0: All right.

552
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:22,859
Speaker 0: So we don't want to do that.

553
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,960
Speaker 0: Let's let's go to another physical topic and then we will go into non physical topics.

554
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,880
Speaker 1: I thought you were about to say, let's go to another color.

555
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:35,320
Speaker 0: OK, so we have a friend, Timo, who actually lives in Finland and he's on the phone right now.

556
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:39,660
Speaker 0: He's more of like a, you know, a particle physicist.

557
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:40,661
Speaker 0: Right.

558
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:50,400
Speaker 0: So, you know, and, you know, as someone who is not, you know, I see, you know, physics and I see the kind of work they do with like, you know, the, you know, you know, finding Higgs bosons and stuff.

559
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:51,680
Speaker 0: And then I see outer space stuff.

560
00:33:52,042 --> 00:33:54,959
Speaker 0: But I really don't see a lot of connection between the two.

561
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:55,383
Speaker 0: Right.

562
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:56,350
Speaker 0: So is there one?

563
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,479
Speaker 0: And if so, what is it?

564
00:33:58,442 --> 00:33:59,620
Speaker 1: There was definitely a connection.

565
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,519
Speaker 0: I imagine there was.

566
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:00,782
Speaker 1: Yes.

567
00:34:01,025 --> 00:34:02,459
Speaker 1: So here's the basic idea.

568
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:07,620
Speaker 1: There's two ways to talk about that.

569
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,438
Speaker 1: We'll we'll talk about both of them.

570
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,639
Speaker 1: So the first thing is the universe is a pretty big place right now.

571
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:15,969
Speaker 1: OK, if you.

572
00:34:16,603 --> 00:34:17,719
Speaker 2: But in relation to what?

573
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:18,956
Speaker 0: In relation to me.

574
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,478
Speaker 2: OK, that's enough.

575
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,199
Speaker 1: In relation to any object you have ever seen in your life, including the Andromeda Galaxy.

576
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:29,860
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the universe is a pretty big place.

577
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,458
Speaker 1: But, you know, it wasn't always so right.

578
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,600
Speaker 1: The universe is expanding.

579
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,420
Speaker 1: So if you go farther back, like we said, eventually the universe is opaque.

580
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,839
Speaker 1: The universe is hotter and denser.

581
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:47,020
Speaker 1: If you go way back, eventually the universe is as hot and as dense as the stuff that you produce in a particle accelerator.

582
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:53,780
Speaker 1: And in fact, the Big Bang has been called the poor man's particle accelerator because stuff happened there.

583
00:34:54,101 --> 00:34:57,200
Speaker 1: That has not really happened since, except in particle accelerators.

584
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,060
Speaker 0: Oh, so the thing is, like I imagine, you know, I guess I imagine the Big Bang would be hotter and denser way more than we could possibly.

585
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,061
Speaker 1: Yeah.

586
00:35:05,081 --> 00:35:09,680
Speaker 1: So the big I mean, the thing is, it's as hot and at some point it is.

587
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,199
Speaker 1: And then if you go farther back in that, it's hotter and denser.

588
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:20,380
Speaker 1: So the better the particle accelerator we get, we can also the the farther back in time we can probe.

589
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:28,160
Speaker 1: So, I mean, the same way that telescopes are time machines, because the farther away you look, the more ancient the light.

590
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:41,340
Speaker 1: Particle accelerators can also be time machines because the hotter and more energetic you get your collisions to be, the farther back in time in the universe's history you have successfully simulated.

591
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:46,340
Speaker 0: There's no danger, though, of like a universe just being created suddenly on Earth, right?

592
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:47,240
Speaker 1: No.

593
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,158
Speaker 0: No, I didn't think so.

594
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,659
Speaker 1: No, the energy scales necessary to do something like that.

595
00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:02,800
Speaker 1: Well, if you make a bunch of assumptions about how that might work that are very charitable to us and our abilities, you still don't get anywhere close.

596
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:11,200
Speaker 1: I mean, there's there's such a thing as observational cosmology, but there's no such thing as experimental cosmology as much as we might wish otherwise.

597
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,980
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so that's that's the first answer is they're sort of connected in that way and that, you know, particle accelerators can tell us what the very, very, very early universe looked like.

598
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:25,160
Speaker 1: But there's also another way in which they're connected, and this is pretty cool.

599
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:29,900
Speaker 1: So there's this wonderful theory called the standard model of particle physics.

600
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's arguably the most successful scientific theory of all time by some measures.

601
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,362
Speaker 1: It's extremely accurate.

602
00:36:36,522 --> 00:36:36,943
Speaker 1: It has.

603
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:46,300
Speaker 1: it successfully describes basically everything that we have ever seen with four notable exceptions.

604
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,678
Speaker 1: And I'll get to those in a second.

605
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:54,180
Speaker 1: But, you know, it describes every interaction we've ever seen at a particle accelerator.

606
00:36:54,961 --> 00:37:03,680
Speaker 1: And even this new Higgs boson result is starting to look like it falls in line with the standard model, which is, frankly, bad news.

607
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,102
Speaker 1: And I'll explain that in a second.

608
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:15,720
Speaker 1: We're all hoping that it doesn't fall in line because the thing is, we know and have known since the standard model was cooked up in the 60s and 70s that it has to be wrong or at least incomplete.

609
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:24,480
Speaker 1: Because one of those four things, when the standard model was was put together, we didn't know about four things that didn't fit.

610
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,619
Speaker 1: We only knew about one thing that didn't fit.

611
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,860
Speaker 1: But that one thing is gravity.

612
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

613
00:37:28,502 --> 00:37:33,800
Speaker 2: So how come the one that's the easiest for me to mess with and understand in the macro level doesn't make sense at any other level?

614
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,058
Speaker 1: So here's here's an interesting thing.

615
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,590
Speaker 1: Gravity is special because of two things.

616
00:37:39,851 --> 00:37:42,559
Speaker 1: It's well, more than two things, but two things right now.

617
00:37:44,243 --> 00:37:46,119
Speaker 1: It's the weakest force by far.

618
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:47,987
Speaker 1: And it's also there's.

619
00:37:48,007 --> 00:37:51,160
Speaker 1: there's no such thing as a gravitationally neutral object.

620
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:57,680
Speaker 1: OK, you know, you can put together a positive and negative electric charge and get something that has no electric charge.

621
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,782
Speaker 1: But you can't do that with gravity.

622
00:37:59,663 --> 00:38:09,880
Speaker 1: So, you know, early on in the history of the universe, the other forces, you know, the strong force and electromagnetism, not so much the weak nuclear force, which is a different story.

623
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,420
Speaker 1: But anyway, the strong force and the electromagnetic force sort of took their turns creating structures that were neutral with respect to those forces.

624
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:25,780
Speaker 1: OK, so, you know, electromagnetism got electrons nuclei together, made atoms.

625
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,105
Speaker 1: Atoms are electrically neutral.

626
00:38:27,527 --> 00:38:30,200
Speaker 1: Electromagnetism said, OK, I'm essentially done.

627
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:37,240
Speaker 1: I mean, electromagnetism still plays a huge role in the universe today, but on large scales, the universe is mostly electrically neutral.

628
00:38:42,344 --> 00:38:46,380
Speaker 1: And and the strong nuclear force did the same thing when, you know, atomic nuclei were put together.

629
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,690
Speaker 1: But but gravity can't do that.

630
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,320
Speaker 1: And gravity also sort of had the last turn because it's the weakest one.

631
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,635
Speaker 0: And so so after everything else is neutralized, you know, the electric force is neutralized.

632
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,260
Speaker 0: The strong nuclear force is neutralized.

633
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,078
Speaker 2: But we still have lumps.

634
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,053
Speaker 0: So now you're sitting there, you're some neutral object, matter, whatever.

635
00:39:07,174 --> 00:39:08,760
Speaker 0: But gravity is now affecting you.

636
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,301
Speaker 0: Exactly.

637
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:12,695
Speaker 0: And so there isn't some strong nuclear force pulling you away from gravity.

638
00:39:12,715 --> 00:39:14,000
Speaker 0: so the gravity doesn't matter as much.

639
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,650
Speaker 1: Precisely.

640
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:14,959
Speaker 1: Yeah.

641
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:25,860
Speaker 1: So gravity, as a result, governs a lot of what we see in the universe on large scales and also a lot of what we see on these sort of intermediate scales where we live, simply because we're living on a big thing.

642
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:31,600
Speaker 1: But if you want a demonstration of gravity being really weak, you've got that whiteboard over there with magnets on it.

643
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:41,220
Speaker 1: So those tiny magnets are being held up by magnetism, OK, against the entire gravitational pull of the Earth.

644
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:54,840
Speaker 1: So those really, really small magnets and those magnets aren't even using sort of the full strength of electromagnetism because there's pretty weak magnets and they're also shitty ones that fall off the fridge.

645
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,103
Speaker 1: They're also dipoles.

646
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,786
Speaker 1: They've got both a north and south pole.

647
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:04,220
Speaker 1: This means that they're not actually going to be as strong as if you had, say, a positive and negative electric charge.

648
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:14,040
Speaker 1: I mean, you could levitate a building pretty easily if you put a bunch of positive charges on the floor and a bunch of positive charges on the building.

649
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,869
Speaker 1: I mean, it would then fall over.

650
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,259
Speaker 1: It's not going to be stable that way.

651
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,178
Speaker 2: So it's a big pencil again.

652
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,083
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

653
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:19,404
Speaker 1: Yes.

654
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:22,740
Speaker 1: But nonetheless, it's really easy to counteract gravity with any of the other forces.

655
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,524
Speaker 1: But yeah, gravity, why?

656
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,559
Speaker 1: gravity is sort of messed up and doesn't fit in.

657
00:40:29,041 --> 00:40:33,680
Speaker 1: The best analogy I ever heard about this is basically the standard model tells you how the players act on the stage.

658
00:40:34,001 --> 00:40:37,379
Speaker 1: The problem with gravity is gravity comes in and warps the stage.

659
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:47,720
Speaker 1: Gravity is a set of rules for how the stage behaves, not the players, because gravity, as general relativity tells us, is a warping of space time.

660
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,184
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

661
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,960
Speaker 1: So we knew that the standard model wasn't complete.

662
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,859
Speaker 1: And since then, we've discovered several things that don't fit in with the standard model.

663
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,639
Speaker 1: Three other things, like I said, four things total.

664
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:05,990
Speaker 1: One of those things is dark matter.

665
00:41:06,712 --> 00:41:09,080
Speaker 1: There is nothing in the standard model that can account for dark matter.

666
00:41:10,221 --> 00:41:17,820
Speaker 1: And another thing is dark energy, which is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate rather than slow down over time.

667
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,680
Speaker 1: And this has we don't know as much about dark energy as we know about dark matter.

668
00:41:24,642 --> 00:41:31,059
Speaker 1: But assuming that I mean, assuming that we're not just wrong about gravity, something is causing this.

669
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,779
Speaker 1: And there's nothing for that in the standard model either.

670
00:41:35,662 --> 00:41:38,400
Speaker 1: And then there's the last thing is this thing called neutrino oscillation.

671
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,200
Speaker 1: Basically, the standard model says that neutrinos shouldn't have mass, but we know that we now have evidence that neutrinos do have mass.

672
00:41:48,361 --> 00:41:53,199
Speaker 1: And it's a small mass, very small, but the standard model can't account for that.

673
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,420
Speaker 1: So these four things, gravity, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino oscillation, they don't fit in the standard model.

674
00:42:00,061 --> 00:42:07,640
Speaker 1: And even if you're skeptical about dark energy and you say no, dark energy is just that we don't understand how gravity works on really big scales, the other three are pretty solid.

675
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,259
Speaker 1: And certainly we know that gravity is real.

676
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,059
Speaker 1: And we've seen neutrino oscillation in the lab, and the evidence for dark matter is pretty good too.

677
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,020
Speaker 1: So none of those are explained by the standard model.

678
00:42:21,642 --> 00:42:33,480
Speaker 1: If we can come up with something that breaks the standard model, if we see some evidence in a particle accelerator of something that is not accounted for by the standard model, that would give us hints of the next theory.

679
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:42,080
Speaker 1: And that next theory could account for dark matter and dark energy, which are two of the biggest outstanding questions in cosmology.

680
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,040
Speaker 1: And so this is a connection between particle physics and cosmology.

681
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:47,999
Speaker 0: Look at how you remembered what he was talking about the whole time.

682
00:42:48,461 --> 00:42:49,920
Speaker 2: Wow, I don't think I've ever done that in my life.

683
00:42:50,322 --> 00:42:53,219
Speaker 0: You were going on tangents, but you remembered where you came from.

684
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:56,000
Speaker 0: I go on tangents and then I'm like, what was I talking about?

685
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,000
Speaker 2: You return to the darkness.

686
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,520
Speaker 1: Well, I go on the most tangents.

687
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, politicians should learn something, actually answering the question.

688
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:03,595
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

689
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,771
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I don't think it's that they can't.

690
00:43:06,832 --> 00:43:08,300
Speaker 1: I think it's that they don't.

691
00:43:08,341 --> 00:43:09,059
Speaker 0: They don't want to, yeah.

692
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:10,967
Speaker 2: So we'll get into some non.

693
00:43:11,007 --> 00:43:14,280
Speaker 2: So my last question before we get into the sort of non-science personal stuff.

694
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:23,420
Speaker 2: How does one who is in, say, entering high school decide to do what you do and actually make progress toward that?

695
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:31,100
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I wanted to do some flavor of astronomy since I was in first grade.

696
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,260
Speaker 1: I mean, I sort of fell in love with astronomy, read some books.

697
00:43:35,702 --> 00:43:40,120
Speaker 1: I sort of went out and saw the night sky because I was in Jersey, so you can see the night sky.

698
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,200
Speaker 0: You can't see shit here.

699
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,399
Speaker 1: Well, you can see Jupiter here.

700
00:43:42,762 --> 00:43:43,100
Speaker 1: That's about it.

701
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,140
Speaker 1: I actually saw Jupiter from Brooklyn last night, looked to the east after sunset.

702
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:53,080
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, I mean, you can totally see a few things here.

703
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,686
Speaker 1: But, yeah, I mean, I looked at the night sky.

704
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,440
Speaker 1: I saw Cosmos, Carl Sagan, amazing stuff.

705
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,479
Speaker 1: And I got really into it.

706
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:09,480
Speaker 1: And then I sort of waffled a bit as I got older, but I was always sort of hooked on the idea of, okay, I at the very least want to do physics and I do really like the sky.

707
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:20,260
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I mean, there's not a whole lot that you can do before you get to high school aside from read a bunch of books if you're interested.

708
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,439
Speaker 1: Once you get to high school, take science and math as much as you can.

709
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,172
Speaker 0: Get A's.

710
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,838
Speaker 1: Do as well as you can.

711
00:44:27,442 --> 00:44:30,880
Speaker 1: When you go to college, major in physics or astronomy.

712
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,640
Speaker 0: What would be the difference between the two majors?

713
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:36,285
Speaker 1: It depends.

714
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:37,479
Speaker 1: At some schools there's very little.

715
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,720
Speaker 1: Usually what happens is a physics major will give you some flexibility with some of the courses you take.

716
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:47,740
Speaker 1: There's like a core and then some physics electives.

717
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:56,360
Speaker 1: Generally an astronomy major, this is how it worked where I went to school, will usually be the physics major, but they pick the electives for you.

718
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,639
Speaker 1: And then there might be a couple of other courses on top of that, so it's sort of more specific.

719
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:03,293
Speaker 1: Because, you know, physics as a major is pretty versatile.

720
00:45:03,313 --> 00:45:04,520
Speaker 1: You can do a lot of different things with it.

721
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,407
Speaker 1: You can go into physics education.

722
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,294
Speaker 1: You can go and work on Wall Street.

723
00:45:08,616 --> 00:45:09,740
Speaker 1: You can go and work for Google.

724
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,994
Speaker 1: You can go do a lot of different things with a physics major.

725
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:15,660
Speaker 1: I mean, you can go into patent law.

726
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:16,779
Speaker 0: Unlike a philosophy major?

727
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:18,721
Speaker 1: Yeah.

728
00:45:18,962 --> 00:45:31,140
Speaker 1: I had a choice between physics and philosophy for graduate school and one of the reasons that I chose physics was that fair or not, and I don't think it is fair, you can do more with an advanced degree in physics and an advanced degree in philosophy.

729
00:45:31,721 --> 00:45:36,900
Speaker 1: But yeah, so major in physics or astronomy and then go to graduate school.

730
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,020
Speaker 1: I mean, if you want to make research contributions to the field, it's very, very difficult to do that without a PhD.

731
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:51,680
Speaker 1: If you want to make contributions to observational astronomy, that you can do without a PhD.

732
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:59,180
Speaker 1: You just need to get a really good telescope and become very familiar with the night sky and you could easily discover an asteroid or a comet or something like that.

733
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:07,460
Speaker 1: But if you want to make research contributions to our theories of how the universe works and where it came from, you kind of need to get a PhD.

734
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:12,420
Speaker 1: And then once you do that, you have a few options.

735
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:21,080
Speaker 1: The traditional academic path after a PhD is to go for what's called a postdoctoral fellowship, and I've applied for a few of those and am waiting to hear back.

736
00:46:22,323 --> 00:46:24,180
Speaker 1: There are also a few other avenues that you can take.

737
00:46:24,541 --> 00:46:27,699
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm freelancing right now.

738
00:46:28,501 --> 00:46:34,680
Speaker 1: That's partly because of the way the timing worked out, partly because I need a little bit of a vacation.

739
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,720
Speaker 1: But also partly because I wanted to see if it could be done.

740
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:43,080
Speaker 1: I mean, the current academic model, its days are numbered.

741
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,086
Speaker 1: Everyone agrees on that.

742
00:46:44,127 --> 00:46:45,879
Speaker 1: They just don't agree on what's coming next.

743
00:46:46,802 --> 00:46:54,400
Speaker 1: And so I figured, well, I can try to stake out a position outside of the current model and see what's coming next.

744
00:46:54,942 --> 00:46:55,908
Speaker 1: But I'm hedging my bets.

745
00:46:55,928 --> 00:46:57,780
Speaker 1: I'm also applying for postdoctoral fellowships.

746
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,137
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

747
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,740
Speaker 1: I mean, the other thing is, and this is not new, this is actually quite old in a sense.

748
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:28,359
Speaker 1: If you have a PhD in the field and you end up being supported doing something else, like if you have a job working for a tech company or something like that, if you somehow have the time and the connections, and this is easier now with the Internet than it was, say, 50 years ago, you can still do research on the side.

749
00:47:30,421 --> 00:47:38,600
Speaker 1: It's just that research is something that takes so much mental energy and so much time that it's difficult to do it without doing it.

750
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,080
Speaker 1: It's difficult to do it while doing something else unless you really make time for it very carefully.

751
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:49,180
Speaker 1: Like if it is part of your professional life, but not the entirety, that's fine.

752
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,560
Speaker 1: There are people who split their time between research and education.

753
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:59,420
Speaker 1: But it's difficult if you have a full time job doing something that is entirely not research to also do research.

754
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,580
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm still doing research, but that's because I'm freelancing.

755
00:48:02,782 --> 00:48:04,759
Speaker 1: So it is part of my professional life.

756
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:06,205
Speaker 2: All right.

757
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,795
Speaker 2: So I think we've taken enough of your time.

758
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:09,980
Speaker 2: You have to get back to science things.

759
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:17,540
Speaker 2: So on a personal note, you know, to get a little feel for you and like what you do outside, you know, as a geek or nerd or scientist or whatever.

760
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,371
Speaker 0: This is a show about nerdingism.

761
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:20,700
Speaker 0: It's not entirely a science show.

762
00:48:21,605 --> 00:48:23,860
Speaker 0: So you've already expressed that you're a board game person.

763
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do like some board and card games.

764
00:48:25,597 --> 00:48:25,860
Speaker 1: Yeah.

765
00:48:27,061 --> 00:48:28,828
Speaker 0: What's like your favorite board games?

766
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,736
Speaker 0: Do you play to win?

767
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:31,580
Speaker 0: Are you super serious?

768
00:48:32,622 --> 00:48:34,446
Speaker 1: I have trouble taking myself seriously.

769
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:41,380
Speaker 1: So no, I mean, no, I guess I play to win in that sometimes I play and then I win.

770
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:43,545
Speaker 1: But no, I don't.

771
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:45,073
Speaker 1: I really like Settlers.

772
00:48:45,816 --> 00:48:46,520
Speaker 1: Settlers is good.

773
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,140
Speaker 2: So the problem with Settlers is that it's pretty solvable and the game is random.

774
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:52,540
Speaker 2: But once all players have equal maximal skill.

775
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, wouldn't you know that Mr.

776
00:48:53,714 --> 00:48:54,038
Speaker 0: Smarty?

777
00:48:56,222 --> 00:48:58,193
Speaker 1: No, actually, I never looked that up.

778
00:48:58,455 --> 00:48:59,320
Speaker 1: I guess that makes sense.

779
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,098
Speaker 1: But it takes the fun out of it.

780
00:49:02,761 --> 00:49:03,045
Speaker 2: It does.

781
00:49:03,328 --> 00:49:04,360
Speaker 0: You are correct.

782
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:06,520
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not like there's chutes and ladders, right?

783
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:12,200
Speaker 2: So fundamentally, all games are either solvable or random and there's no other kind of game.

784
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:14,740
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but that's psychology.

785
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:15,301
Speaker 0: All right.

786
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:18,195
Speaker 2: So movies, what do you like?

787
00:49:18,216 --> 00:49:19,100
Speaker 2: What kinds of movies do you like?

788
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,571
Speaker 2: I can't like name, I don't know, name like a movie.

789
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:23,420
Speaker 2: that's like one of your favorite movies.

790
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,059
Speaker 1: Groundhog Day.

791
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:25,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

792
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:32,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, Groundhog Day is one of these movies where, and I'm not joking, if you watch it a few times over, it really grows on you.

793
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:42,160
Speaker 1: It's, you know, it's easy to sort of write it off as this sort of light comedy, but it actually is an extremely it's a deep movie.

794
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,920
Speaker 1: There's a lot there, but it's also a lot of fun.

795
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:50,380
Speaker 1: Like it's not I wouldn't say that's the best movie ever made, but it is easily one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite movie.

796
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,539
Speaker 0: No, it's definitely way up there for me, too.

797
00:49:53,104 --> 00:49:54,620
Speaker 2: So you clearly read The Name of the Wind.

798
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did read The Name of the Wind, that's true.

799
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,819
Speaker 0: What other books did you read?

800
00:49:57,982 --> 00:49:58,799
Speaker 1: The Wise Man's Fear.

801
00:50:00,581 --> 00:50:01,337
Speaker 0: I haven't read that yet.

802
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,940
Speaker 2: So I guess my question there just very briefly, because we just did a whole Geek Nights book club on it.

803
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:06,216
Speaker 2: Yeah.

804
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,480
Speaker 2: We put our opinions out on the Internet.

805
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,909
Speaker 2: What do you do?

806
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:09,939
Speaker 2: Did you like that book?

807
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,879
Speaker 2: Are there fantasy books or other books you like more than it?

808
00:50:16,522 --> 00:50:19,870
Speaker 1: I mean, so I'm a big Ursula K. Le Guin jump out.

809
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:21,838
Speaker 1: Me too, me too.

810
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:28,480
Speaker 1: I'd say that that A Wizard of Earthsea and those books are really, really good.

811
00:50:28,721 --> 00:50:30,240
Speaker 0: Also a previous book club selection.

812
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,879
Speaker 0: Have you read The Dispossessed?

813
00:50:32,161 --> 00:50:32,800
Speaker 1: I have read The Dispossessed.

814
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:34,258
Speaker 1: That's an incredible book.

815
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,880
Speaker 0: I love that book.

816
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,380
Speaker 2: So you probably haven't read The Prince of Nothing.

817
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,700
Speaker 2: That's the joke you missed.

818
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,599
Speaker 2: It's our Scott Bakker.

819
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,480
Speaker 2: It's basically philosophy, punk, gritty science fiction fantasy.

820
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,458
Speaker 1: It's on your list now.

821
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:46,930
Speaker 1: OK.

822
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,960
Speaker 2: Based on the discussion we just had, it's probably up your alley.

823
00:50:50,268 --> 00:50:50,480
Speaker 1: Awesome.

824
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:50,836
Speaker 1: OK.

825
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:51,151
Speaker 1: Yeah.

826
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:53,259
Speaker 0: What else we got here?

827
00:50:53,645 --> 00:50:54,060
Speaker 2: I don't know.

828
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,840
Speaker 0: You said that you swore off video games in the school days.

829
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:58,558
Speaker 1: I mean, I did.

830
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,080
Speaker 1: I didn't break that promise for two short video games.

831
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:04,720
Speaker 1: But yeah, I in college and grad school.

832
00:51:05,202 --> 00:51:07,640
Speaker 1: Well, in college, I didn't play any video games because.

833
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:11,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't have made it through and it was difficult to make it.

834
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,178
Speaker 2: You chose much better than I did.

835
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,780
Speaker 1: Actually, I did play one video game in college one night.

836
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,253
Speaker 1: I found myself with literally nothing to do with.

837
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:20,400
Speaker 1: it happened exactly once.

838
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,560
Speaker 1: I was in college and I went to a friend of mine and said this.

839
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,940
Speaker 1: He said, oh, you have nothing to do here.

840
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,577
Speaker 1: Play Civ.

841
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:26,940
Speaker 0: Which Civ was that?

842
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:27,959
Speaker 1: I think it was Civ three.

843
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,717
Speaker 1: I went back to him 10 hours later.

844
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,777
Speaker 1: So like I had this conversation with him at night.

845
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:37,800
Speaker 1: I went back to him 10 or 12 hours later and said, hey, so I haven't slept.

846
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,458
Speaker 1: Take this away from me and don't go back.

847
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,700
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's probably wise.

848
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:41,940
Speaker 1: So I'm not.

849
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,300
Speaker 2: That was even the bad Civ.

850
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:43,571
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:51:44,002 --> 00:51:46,580
Speaker 1: I have difficulty with that kind of control.

852
00:51:46,702 --> 00:51:47,739
Speaker 1: So I just didn't do that.

853
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,779
Speaker 0: And the only thing you've stayed away from the MMOs then.

854
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,519
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

855
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,660
Speaker 2: Never Google a thing called Europa Universalis.

856
00:51:54,985 --> 00:51:55,960
Speaker 2: It's a Europe simulator.

857
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,059
Speaker 1: I will not play MMOs.

858
00:51:58,301 --> 00:51:58,916
Speaker 1: I won't do it.

859
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:00,119
Speaker 0: That's a good move.

860
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,560
Speaker 1: So, I mean, it's not that they're not fun.

861
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,638
Speaker 1: It's not that they're there.

862
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,720
Speaker 1: They might even for some people in some ways be a valuable use of time.

863
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,678
Speaker 1: Somebody just got concrete poured on him over there.

864
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:10,439
Speaker 0: Awesome.

865
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:10,895
Speaker 1: Sorry.

866
00:52:12,222 --> 00:52:14,679
Speaker 2: They're building another tower of the geek night studio.

867
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,800
Speaker 2: So, Star Trek.

868
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,560
Speaker 2: Do you like Star Trek?

869
00:52:20,661 --> 00:52:21,378
Speaker 1: Oh, God, yes.

870
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,180
Speaker 1: All right, Bob.

871
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:22,880
Speaker 2: Bob Picard.

872
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,320
Speaker 2: Who's your favorite captain?

873
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:26,020
Speaker 2: Scott hates Star Trek.

874
00:52:26,424 --> 00:52:26,880
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

875
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:27,840
Speaker 1: Picard's awesome.

876
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,480
Speaker 1: I mean, so I have a really soft spot for Picard because I grew up with the next generation.

877
00:52:31,641 --> 00:52:33,199
Speaker 1: You know, it was on TV when I was a kid.

878
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,460
Speaker 2: And then Deep Space Nine was on after and I'd fall asleep.

879
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:36,899
Speaker 1: And Deep Space Nine is good.

880
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,760
Speaker 1: The thing is, and this is where I lose some nerd cred.

881
00:52:40,482 --> 00:52:41,580
Speaker 1: Deep Space Nine has continuity.

882
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,100
Speaker 1: You have to watch the whole thing all the way through.

883
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:43,775
Speaker 1: I haven't.

884
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:45,779
Speaker 1: I have started to and I really like it.

885
00:52:46,342 --> 00:52:54,300
Speaker 1: And I am open to the possibility that Cisco might in some ways be better than Picard, because, you know, next generation has some continuity.

886
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:55,279
Speaker 1: It doesn't have none.

887
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:58,000
Speaker 1: It just doesn't have nearly as much as Deep Space Nine.

888
00:52:59,381 --> 00:53:08,460
Speaker 1: I mean, I do feel like it's a shame that the original series movies have always been way, way better than the next generation movies.

889
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,519
Speaker 1: There's really only maybe one next generation movie that's any good.

890
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:12,959
Speaker 1: So that sucks.

891
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,980
Speaker 1: I was also way more into Star Trek when I was younger.

892
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:18,039
Speaker 1: It's sort of one of those things which I feel like I did.

893
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,559
Speaker 1: And now it's like, OK, yeah, I have some Star Trek knowledge, but it's not something that's been a big part of my life.

894
00:53:23,922 --> 00:53:25,680
Speaker 0: That is a weird thing to think about, right?

895
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:35,180
Speaker 0: Because, like, you know, I don't like Star Trek, but it's like I see like a lot of people now are sort of picking it up later versus other people who picked it up earlier.

896
00:53:35,341 --> 00:53:38,920
Speaker 0: And it's sort of like almost like two different groups of fans.

897
00:53:39,228 --> 00:53:39,460
Speaker 0: Yeah.

898
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,740
Speaker 0: The people who picked it up early in life are like the Trekkie, Trekker, whatever word is the correct word for them.

899
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,160
Speaker 2: You know, people will piss off half of them, no matter what you say.

900
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:59,320
Speaker 0: And then, you know, the people who are like, you know, 20s, 30s now watching it on Netflix and stuff, who are still huge fans of it, are sort of separated from them in a way, even though they're fans of the same thing.

901
00:53:59,580 --> 00:53:59,921
Speaker 2: Well, we see that.

902
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:04,860
Speaker 2: Look at Look at My Little Pony and the people who are fans of it now going to the My Little Pony conventions and just horrifying.

903
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:05,759
Speaker 0: It's a different show.

904
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,060
Speaker 0: These are the same exact shows, which is why it's sort of, I think, a unique case.

905
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,823
Speaker 0: Yeah.

906
00:54:09,983 --> 00:54:14,840
Speaker 1: My feeling about Star Trek for me in my life is just that it's almost a little like Ninja Turtles.

907
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:20,120
Speaker 1: I was really into Ninja Turtles when I was a kid and then I was done and I wasn't really into them.

908
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,080
Speaker 1: And now, you know, yeah, I like Ninja Turtles.

909
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:27,080
Speaker 1: I'll go see, you know, I went to see that Ninja Turtle movie that came out a few years ago.

910
00:54:27,425 --> 00:54:27,513
Speaker 1: What?

911
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,959
Speaker 1: Yeah.

912
00:54:29,403 --> 00:54:30,199
Speaker 0: I did not know about this.

913
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:30,605
Speaker 1: Yeah.

914
00:54:30,686 --> 00:54:30,971
Speaker 1: And it was.

915
00:54:31,073 --> 00:54:31,439
Speaker 1: it was fun.

916
00:54:31,821 --> 00:54:32,864
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's not like.

917
00:54:33,306 --> 00:54:37,200
Speaker 1: it's not like I own massive quantities of Ninja Turtle or Star Trek paraphernalia.

918
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,780
Speaker 1: I don't live or die or breathe the stuff.

919
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,060
Speaker 0: Is there anything you do live or die or breathe?

920
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,020
Speaker 2: Other than science?

921
00:54:45,942 --> 00:54:46,251
Speaker 1: Dr.

922
00:54:46,292 --> 00:54:46,395
Speaker 1: Who.

923
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:53,000
Speaker 1: I really and that's because I came to it late in life.

924
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:04,860
Speaker 1: Like basically what happened was in grad school, I keep saying in grad school, a couple of years ago, my girlfriend came to me and said, hey, so I just started watching the show and you need to watch it.

925
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,418
Speaker 1: You need to watch it.

926
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:05,930
Speaker 1: What's it called?

927
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:06,217
Speaker 1: Dr.

928
00:55:06,258 --> 00:55:06,340
Speaker 1: Who?

929
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:07,569
Speaker 1: Oh, I vaguely heard of it.

930
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:08,959
Speaker 1: People seem to get really into it.

931
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:11,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me just just sit down and watch it with me.

932
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:12,880
Speaker 1: OK, fine.

933
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,680
Speaker 1: And then after watching a couple of episodes is sort of, OK, this is kind of the best thing ever.

934
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:18,424
Speaker 1: I mean, have you ever?

935
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,840
Speaker 1: another thing you've gotten really into is community.

936
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,780
Speaker 1: Do you guys watch?

937
00:55:22,122 --> 00:55:22,779
Speaker 0: I've seen a few.

938
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,020
Speaker 2: Scott, like he doesn't watch or like most.

939
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,260
Speaker 1: There's this wonderful scene.

940
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,376
Speaker 1: So community has its own take off on Dr.

941
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:29,880
Speaker 1: Who, right?

942
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:30,940
Speaker 1: Inspector Space Time.

943
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:35,380
Speaker 1: And there's this wonderful scene where Abed sees Inspector Space Time for the first time.

944
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,499
Speaker 1: And he's watching this incredibly cheesy clip and he watches about a minute of it.

945
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:42,480
Speaker 1: And then he says, this is the best thing I've ever seen in my life.

946
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,096
Speaker 1: And that's essentially what happened to me.

947
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,720
Speaker 0: Guy at my work Halloween custom was Inspector Space Time.

948
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,447
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, yeah.

949
00:55:51,206 --> 00:55:51,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot.

950
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,599
Speaker 0: There's a lot of who people out there.

951
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:53,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

952
00:55:54,403 --> 00:55:56,520
Speaker 0: We go to conventions and it's like this everywhere.

953
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,299
Speaker 1: Last year for Halloween, before I'd finished my degree, I dressed up as the doctoral candidate.

954
00:56:05,123 --> 00:56:06,298
Speaker 1: So the young doctor.

955
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:07,500
Speaker 2: Clever girl.

956
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:08,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe.

957
00:56:10,163 --> 00:56:11,600
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think if there's anything else that you guys.

958
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:12,397
Speaker 1: I have a website.

959
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:13,258
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

960
00:56:13,925 --> 00:56:15,339
Speaker 0: Is there anything else that you would like to pimp?

961
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:15,616
Speaker 0: Yes.

962
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:19,260
Speaker 2: Pimp and plug yourself independent of the opening to this.

963
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,820
Speaker 0: And also, if there's anything else you would like to tell an audience of some number of nerds.

964
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,273
Speaker 1: Well, I've got a blog and it's at.

965
00:56:28,574 --> 00:56:30,100
Speaker 1: it's called Freelance Astrophysicist.

966
00:56:30,605 --> 00:56:32,038
Speaker 1: And it's at freelanceastro.com.

967
00:56:35,021 --> 00:56:41,139
Speaker 1: So, yeah, if you want to read more of my stuff or hear more about what I'm up to, you should go there.

968
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:49,560
Speaker 1: And you can also if you have any questions about science that you want to ask me, you can send me a question through the site.

969
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,380
Speaker 1: And it might take me a little while to respond, but I will respond.

970
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:55,658
Speaker 1: Anything else?

971
00:56:58,145 --> 00:56:58,396
Speaker 1: Hmm.

972
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,419
Speaker 2: I could end it right there.

973
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't have any other personal projects.

974
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,640
Speaker 1: I mean, if you if you know someone in San Francisco who's looking for a math or science tutor, I have some openings.

975
00:57:09,823 --> 00:57:10,296
Speaker 0: We can do that.

976
00:57:13,447 --> 00:57:14,338
Speaker 1: And yeah, beyond that.

977
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:17,150
Speaker 1: Yeah.

978
00:57:17,474 --> 00:57:18,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's all I've got.

979
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:18,890
Speaker 1: All right.

980
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:22,530
Speaker 2: Well, thank you for taking the time to come to our somewhat disheveled studio right now.

981
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:26,790
Speaker 0: That show was particularly awesome and I'm sure it'll be enjoyed by many.

982
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:39,020
Speaker 2: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.
