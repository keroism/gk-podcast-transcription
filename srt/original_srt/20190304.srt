1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,782
Speaker 1: It's Monday March 4th 2019.

2
00:00:10,782 --> 00:00:12,065
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,205 --> 00:00:14,591
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,972 --> 00:00:16,175
Speaker 1: It's finally time.

5
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:18,877
Speaker 1: It is a tech news roundup.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,614
Speaker 0: Let's do this as long time.

7
00:00:27,654 --> 00:00:37,910
Speaker 1: listeners of geek nights will know we Periodically run out of good ideas for Monday shows because a lot of things we could talk about on a month Yeah, technically you mean frequently are not technically technology news.

8
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:47,101
Speaker 1: They are mostly business news because most technology news is actually business news And none of you care when like Linux kernel 5.0.0.0.0.1.8 comes out.

9
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:55,398
Speaker 1: so Every year around this time.

10
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,902
Speaker 1: I start thinking to myself.

11
00:00:56,922 --> 00:01:02,259
Speaker 1: Oh, we're really out of Monday shows and then I think to myself Hey, why did we do a tech news roundup?

12
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:04,666
Speaker 1: and Scott always says nope we just did one.

13
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:05,790
Speaker 1: That's a cop-out show.

14
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,615
Speaker 1: That's a BS.

15
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,950
Speaker 1: We're not doing it unless it's been a while.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,355
Speaker 0: Well, they used to be the dynamic.

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,467
Speaker 0: the new dynamic is pretty much every Monday.

18
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,830
Speaker 0: rim is like Let's do tech news roundup and I say no you can wait until March.

19
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,933
Speaker 0: Yep, and it.

20
00:01:19,254 --> 00:01:21,441
Speaker 0: so now rim knows his March is smart.

21
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,808
Speaker 1: just coming stupid smarts weather.

22
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:34,793
Speaker 0: Yeah Hey, it is stupid smart your weather And he's like all right first Monday show March or do a tech news roundup in the next Monday He'll probably ask to do one again, and I'll be like no yeah I got some.

23
00:01:34,873 --> 00:01:37,469
Speaker 1: I think I got some ideas for some Monday topics, but good luck.

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:46,756
Speaker 1: We're doing a tech news roundup today, so in the opening bit We didn't do a show on Thursday, so we were gonna do 2001 a space Odyssey Which is the current geek nights book club.

25
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:58,250
Speaker 1: I didn't finish reading it in time because I was busy Uh-huh, but I ended up having to do a work thing that night anyway Uh-huh, so we couldn't do the show where you will be doing the geek nights.

26
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,114
Speaker 1: But book club.

27
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:03,851
Speaker 1: on to lies your opening bit the meta moment a space Odyssey Cuz.

28
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:04,313
Speaker 1: we're not.

29
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,699
Speaker 1: we're just gonna go straight into the main bit.

30
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:06,923
Speaker 1: It's a weird day.

31
00:02:06,944 --> 00:02:08,570
Speaker 1: It's tech news roundup day, okay.

32
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:15,270
Speaker 1: Also, we're not live-streaming this one because I got water flooding in through one of my bathroom ceilings And I hear it splashing even more over there.

33
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:30,447
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hear it escalating so I'm gonna pause recording the show to go look at that, and then we're gonna get ready for Things of the day, I just closed the door so I can't hear that water dripping anymore.

34
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:31,230
Speaker 0: I still hear it dripping.

35
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,407
Speaker 1: I hear it, but less so.

36
00:02:33,771 --> 00:02:39,470
Speaker 0: So what do you got thing of the day was so you know in Japan does that the mega earthquake way back?

37
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:54,934
Speaker 0: When you're at PAX East that one time yeah, and it messed up most notably a lot of most a lot of Japan But it messed up Fukushima where there's nuclear power plant that was poorly maintained famously and basically everyone evacuated there and hasn't really gone back because You know

38
00:02:55,415 --> 00:02:55,636
Speaker 1: yep,

39
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:58,285
Speaker 0: it's like Chernobyl not Chernobyl bad, but close.

40
00:02:58,406 --> 00:02:58,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

41
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,610
Speaker 1: I hope this is not bad.

42
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,310
Speaker 1: I hope this is not late breaking news to any of you.

43
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,890
Speaker 1: You can read like a book or talk to an old person if you want like documentaries.

44
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:09,210
Speaker 0: What is don't go there, but someone did go there stupidly?

45
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,152
Speaker 0: And what?

46
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:16,670
Speaker 0: I'm always glad that someone else does this sure great, and they went to the arcade.

47
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:26,468
Speaker 0: there's like a mega Sega Game Center there and Nobody has looted the Sega Game Center for some reason maybe because everything's covered in radioactive dust.

48
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:30,650
Speaker 1: yeah Like I imagine it'd be hard to get all that radioactive dust out of an area.

49
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:35,069
Speaker 0: It's like an arcade that first of all some of the things in there still work, right?

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,582
Speaker 0: But it's basically frozen in time right.

51
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:44,608
Speaker 0: usually you go to old arcades And it's like you know you can see like the remnant pieces and stuff like that.

52
00:03:44,628 --> 00:03:49,990
Speaker 0: right But here the arcade has been frozen in time just abandoned and unchanged.

53
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:55,769
Speaker 0: I guess it was flooded at one point at least in the bottom level probably, but it's like it's just sitting there.

54
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,884
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you look at these pictures it stuff's just covered in dust and so the ceiling.

55
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:09,244
Speaker 0: if you're curious about what year was that 11 2011 11 okay, so in 2011 you can basically see forever.

56
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,488
Speaker 0: I guess for a long time.

57
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:16,949
Speaker 0: We're gonna have it like a museum of arcade technology Japanese arcade.

58
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,219
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a mini Vesuvius.

59
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:26,016
Speaker 0: yes, there's a video and there's some other stuff To so you can examine it.

60
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:34,630
Speaker 0: similarly I did see I don't have to find the link for it again There was a. there was a Twitter thread about the metreon in this thing.

61
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:39,268
Speaker 0: It's in San Francisco right which was like the Sony building that Sony made in the 90s.

62
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,450
Speaker 0: That was sort of like like a Disney Quest sort of situation thing with like fancy arcade.

63
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:49,322
Speaker 1: I don't know if I know about that or I just think I know about.

64
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,050
Speaker 0: I knew about it when it was a thing.

65
00:04:51,492 --> 00:04:57,789
Speaker 0: I feel like I saw a YouTube video about it But I wasn't paying because basically GDC is this year is gonna be in it or near it.

66
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:06,650
Speaker 0: Oh the Twitter was like hey all GDC people go here and Look at the remnants of what was once the metroid and is now just like a sad movie theater.

67
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:12,901
Speaker 0: But you can still see you know in these areas of the building What's left from the days when it was awesome in 90s.

68
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,130
Speaker 1: so Scott what in your memory?

69
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,482
Speaker 1: Let's go back to like middle school social studies or geography class.

70
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,430
Speaker 1: What's the longest river in the world?

71
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:23,577
Speaker 0: You know give me Amazon could be Nile.

72
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:25,723
Speaker 0: you know something like that all right.

73
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:35,884
Speaker 1: so as far as I can tell looking at Wikipedia Both the Amazon and the Nile are listed as the longest river in the world, okay I am 100% right.

74
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:36,990
Speaker 0: I got both right answers.

75
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:43,088
Speaker 1: So this is in my style recently a lot of my things that they have been things like this because this is the YouTube hole I've been going down.

76
00:05:43,532 --> 00:05:54,220
Speaker 1: But it basically it's one of those questions where there's a simple question And it turns out that for reasons the answer to that question is Potentially impossible to give

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,530
Speaker 0: right because you you could you know the other end of a river That's pretty easy to find it usually at the ocean or something yep.

78
00:05:59,891 --> 00:06:03,003
Speaker 0: And then you go up the river, and there's the main part of it right.

79
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:09,544
Speaker 0: That's all thick and tons of water Really river really easy to measure that right, but eventually you reach.

80
00:06:09,584 --> 00:06:17,489
Speaker 0: well eventually you reach a point we're like hey this river like has a fork and Each half of it is kind of yeah.

81
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,822
Speaker 0: So maybe you take the wider half and they get another fork.

82
00:06:19,862 --> 00:06:27,264
Speaker 0: me like am I still on the same river Really, and then you see like your middle of the river And you see some water just going down from a hill nearby going into the river.

83
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,530
Speaker 1: It's like tributaries.

84
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:32,816
Speaker 0: It's like there's so many tributaries Right how can you measure?

85
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:39,240
Speaker 0: and then there's also like you know rivers might get twisty and turny But there might be water like cutting across the twisty turny part.

86
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:40,906
Speaker 0: so there's all sorts of things.

87
00:06:40,966 --> 00:06:44,087
Speaker 0: and then this way maybe Elevation changes in the river right.

88
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:50,589
Speaker 0: it's like Oh, you know there's so many things You know how you you need to set a rules for measuring river length that are consistent.

89
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:50,890
Speaker 1: yep.

90
00:06:51,030 --> 00:07:00,200
Speaker 1: So the trickiest part is that even if we just go for that first part where you jumped in like say we agree on What part counts as the river and we ignore the whole tributary problem.

91
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,050
Speaker 1: rivers lengths change so often?

92
00:07:03,671 --> 00:07:05,748
Speaker 1: that you'd have to constantly remeasure them.

93
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:12,070
Speaker 1: and If you measure with more granularity the length of every river eventually becomes infinite.

94
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,262
Speaker 1: Because what is the actual length?

95
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,810
Speaker 1: which side of the river?

96
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,597
Speaker 1: Do you measure like it gets?

97
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:20,530
Speaker 0: I found I found the drop of water?

98
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:30,930
Speaker 0: Hitting a leaf that goes and lands on the ground and rolls down a hill and goes in Slowly absorbs out of the soil and made it just moist enough for some flowing to happen.

99
00:07:31,232 --> 00:07:35,260
Speaker 0: So part of that eventually goes into the ocean And that's the river starts at that leaf on that tree.

100
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:39,916
Speaker 1: so part of this is the same question as How long is a coastline?

101
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:43,625
Speaker 1: because the answer is they're all infinitely long, and there's no way to measure that.

102
00:07:43,645 --> 00:07:54,401
Speaker 1: I Guess if you're measuring like what if it's really a really twisty tourney Coastline how much of that nonsense do you measure it versus just ignore?

103
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,567
Speaker 0: It's still not infinite.

104
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,590
Speaker 1: It's there.

105
00:07:59,393 --> 00:08:01,969
Speaker 0: There is definitely finite landmass.

106
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,994
Speaker 0: It's just really big yeah, but Zoom all the way in now.

107
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:11,630
Speaker 1: You've got the curvature of every individual molecule and atom of every piece of that land.

108
00:08:11,772 --> 00:08:14,096
Speaker 1: That's really stupid Yeah, but I'm saying what?

109
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:16,264
Speaker 1: what is the unit of granularity that makes sense?

110
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:18,231
Speaker 1: because fucking ruler well What?

111
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:24,290
Speaker 0: so you can't measure it with a ruler you can't measure so you quantize it into a straight one size one foot.

112
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:28,226
Speaker 1: I'm just saying you got a size measuring depending on the number you pick.

113
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:32,301
Speaker 0: if I'm at the beach I take my tape measure and I go and I'm measuring the the.

114
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:44,764
Speaker 1: the fact that one grain of sand is slightly set back Yeah, but all I'm saying is that depending on the granularity you pick and I'm talking even like one foot versus one inch Completely changes the answer, but see this is the point.

115
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,056
Speaker 0: see it's interesting to say I'm measuring a river.

116
00:08:47,177 --> 00:08:48,584
Speaker 0: tricky because tributaries.

117
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:53,370
Speaker 0: if you're making this argument You're basically saying nothing can be measured which is completely stupid.

118
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:54,194
Speaker 0: I don't know.

119
00:08:54,294 --> 00:09:02,070
Speaker 1: so pointless know because you can measure straight line distances easily And you can actually measure like road distances the air molecules.

120
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:06,230
Speaker 1: What's hard to knock is what's hard with a curvature of space-time?

121
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:06,692
Speaker 0: We might be.

122
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,301
Speaker 0: how fast is that ruler moving?

123
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,930
Speaker 1: we can account for all those things the one.

124
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:24,784
Speaker 1: This is the specific problem of if you're trying to measure an outline of a thing Like a coastline I very specifically a coastline Depending on if your granularity is an inch or a foot or a yard.

125
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:32,280
Speaker 1: the answer to the question Like say what state has the longest coastline changes Because some coastlines are really craggy and some aren't.

126
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:35,110
Speaker 1: if you measure it a yard granularity that might make more sense.

127
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:40,465
Speaker 1: But that also ignores all the crazy twisty tourney that might exist in like parts of Maine.

128
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:41,408
Speaker 0: measure it with a fucking.

129
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:51,041
Speaker 0: if you can See it from a plane then accounts all right, but someone was 20/20 vision Boris vision good vision Some sort of laser measuring device from the play.

130
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:52,125
Speaker 1: How is that plane flying?

131
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,250
Speaker 0: It's a low flying plane.

132
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm just saying like like the kind that carries an advertisement for the beach.

133
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,610
Speaker 0: That's how you pay for the measuring research.

134
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:10,285
Speaker 1: So yeah in the meta moment like I said the book club The geek nights book club is a long and storied tradition of announcing books and then Not actually getting to do them for a while and then reading them in a hurry and doing a show.

135
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:11,249
Speaker 0: I read the book.

136
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,310
Speaker 1: Yep, I will ever read by well before next Thursday when we will do the next game.

137
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,156
Speaker 0: Not only I've did I read that book.

138
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:22,006
Speaker 0: I've mostly read a much longer book.

139
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,270
Speaker 1: Oh, you're getting back into the show.

140
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:26,150
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the book that was on my kindlef.

141
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,374
Speaker 1: That's is so yet.

142
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:32,152
Speaker 1: Did you get to the part where you where you might say wow this is actually Evangelion.

143
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,501
Speaker 0: yet, I mean it's been like this is book one.

144
00:10:34,722 --> 00:10:42,392
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it gets you think you might think okay It's Evangelion, and then it hits a point where it gets way more Evangelion.

145
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:44,964
Speaker 0: I mean it gets more even gel in every chapter.

146
00:10:45,105 --> 00:10:48,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, it keeps getting more Evangelion and the end is Evangelion there.

147
00:10:48,823 --> 00:10:50,169
Speaker 0: it is it's good biz.

148
00:10:50,854 --> 00:11:04,266
Speaker 1: But the geek nights book club has done a lot of books And if you don't want to worry about the fickle realities of rim and scott or particularly rim in this case actually finishing the book That we're currently reading we've read a ton of books and not

149
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:07,619
Speaker 0: because you read them often Just because geek nights has been going on for too long Yeah

150
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:18,608
Speaker 1: And we've done pretty intense episodes of us talking about those books like Steppenwolf a farewell to arms snow crash Great, etc.

151
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:25,448
Speaker 1: Otherwise we will be live at PAX East doing a panel the real harm of games.

152
00:11:26,314 --> 00:11:27,346
Speaker 0: I guess I had to finish making.

153
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,055
Speaker 1: yes You do only got a few.

154
00:11:29,095 --> 00:11:31,806
Speaker 1: geek nights will also be at Zenkaikan doing a bunch of panels.

155
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,097
Speaker 1: I At some point.

156
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:36,190
Speaker 1: I should look up what panels were doing.

157
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:42,873
Speaker 1: I think I will try to do that tonight and make a post about it because I need to figure out what I need to prepare For Zenkaikan.

158
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:43,897
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be there.

159
00:11:44,258 --> 00:11:46,324
Speaker 1: my panels are probably all on Saturday.

160
00:11:46,365 --> 00:11:47,027
Speaker 1: There's a chance.

161
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,889
Speaker 1: There's one on Sunday I will not.

162
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:58,441
Speaker 1: The only geek nights panel that'll occur on Friday is I will be drinking at one of the pubs near the convention center And I will probably not at any point enter the convention center.

163
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:03,542
Speaker 1: if you find me in one of those pubs You can talk to me, and I guess that'll count as a geek nights event.

164
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:07,458
Speaker 1: so yeah other than that I think we should get right into the tech news roundup.

165
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:08,021
Speaker 0: all right.

166
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,350
Speaker 0: What tech news did you round up mr.. Tech news round.

167
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,250
Speaker 1: Oh, all right, so I put these in random order based on what?

168
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,180
Speaker 0: Tech news rodeo rim yep, so wrangler here.

169
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,721
Speaker 1: first thing.

170
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:22,408
Speaker 1: first the news that it's a big news And there's a lot to talk about here.

171
00:12:22,891 --> 00:12:40,250
Speaker 1: It's technology and it's technology adjacent, but there's a whole clusterfuck around YouTube cracking down on the monetization of YouTube videos where Pedophiles and Nazis have posted things in the comments.

172
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:45,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like you know some kids say have like you know Gymnastics or something.

173
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:49,150
Speaker 0: yep, so you got like elementary school kids doing gymnastics and say the school.

174
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,719
Speaker 1: So the video that parents.

175
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:55,321
Speaker 0: some parents take an innocent video and they put it on YouTube so that the other parents can watch it.

176
00:12:55,522 --> 00:13:07,206
Speaker 0: yep, and then some pedophiles find it and one person's innocent video about Elementary school gymnastics is someone else's fat yep, and then you know that is a problem.

177
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:11,650
Speaker 1: as old as internet is The internet is exist now people have been able to post content.

178
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,022
Speaker 0: That would just be a thing that people realize.

179
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:28,290
Speaker 0: try not to think about yep If it weren't for the fact that those people on the fab side then go into the comments and trade Links to other similar videos and do not say lots of bad things in the comments.

180
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:31,605
Speaker 0: So those videos that they show me saying so that's one aspect.

181
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:42,921
Speaker 1: you've got this problem That has always existed, but is now existing at scale because of the cruel realities of a modern People Collecting lots of video footage of children.

182
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:49,608
Speaker 0: that is not technically child porn But you find a playlist that make you know something that makes it through YouTube's.

183
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,309
Speaker 0: you know It's it's just videos of children.

184
00:13:52,493 --> 00:13:53,855
Speaker 1: But then yeah but here's the problem.

185
00:13:53,895 --> 00:14:01,150
Speaker 0: so they feel like if I went to the beach and I videoed like Hot girls in bikinis because they're on the beach, and then I just made a compilation video.

186
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,632
Speaker 0: It's like I'm like.

187
00:14:01,652 --> 00:14:02,335
Speaker 0: it's not porn here.

188
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:02,999
Speaker 0: It is on YouTube.

189
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

190
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,164
Speaker 0: I'm watch my.

191
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,450
Speaker 0: I'd get a lot of hits with that.

192
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:06,869
Speaker 0: I'm sure there is that on you, too.

193
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:19,433
Speaker 1: so you know the problem of you find a YouTube video and then you find like a playlist that that YouTube video is in and then you look and that playlist is Oddly specific.

194
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,499
Speaker 1: it's definitely someone's fat material.

195
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:35,775
Speaker 0: there are lots and lots of things that are not technically in and of themselves Crossing the line, but yeah, not just pornography, but hate speech and Nazi stuff too, but yet are obviously Crossing the line.

196
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:37,422
Speaker 1: yep like for example.

197
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:42,922
Speaker 1: There is another terrible Parallel to this that YouTube is not doing anything specifically about.

198
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:56,230
Speaker 1: but it happens, and I've seen discussion about it There'll be a lot of videos that are all clustered together that are all themselves Innocently uploaded or at least ostensibly initially up innocently uploaded by like police stations and security cameras.

199
00:14:56,814 --> 00:15:04,760
Speaker 1: But someone will collect all those videos selectively only include Certain of those videos and make a compilation.

200
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:12,750
Speaker 1: That's basically people of race X committing crimes Because they've removed all the white people that were in the other videos that committed those same crimes.

201
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:15,197
Speaker 0: So why don't we make white people committing crime?

202
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:15,960
Speaker 1: Maybe we should.

203
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,549
Speaker 1: that's what we should make the YouTube channel white people committing crimes.

204
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:21,498
Speaker 1: I Feel like I don't want to watch that channel.

205
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,905
Speaker 1: I don't know any of these channels.

206
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:23,710
Speaker 1: It's called cops.

207
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,139
Speaker 0: It was on national television.

208
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,609
Speaker 0: I'm sure maybe it still is so.

209
00:15:27,572 --> 00:15:29,257
Speaker 1: So that is in itself a problem.

210
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:36,181
Speaker 1: the reason why this becomes a technology issue is a Related orthogonal thing that happened.

211
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:47,930
Speaker 1: YouTube has a video recommendation engine that tries to figure out based on what you looked at what videos you would be likely to Continue to watch so that you just keep fucking watching YouTube forever.

212
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,242
Speaker 0: So and it works by looking at other people and it's like.

213
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:55,198
Speaker 0: well that person other people who watch this video Also watch these videos.

214
00:15:55,238 --> 00:16:00,690
Speaker 0: so that means if you watch this video You'll probably like the things that other people who watch this video like yep.

215
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,424
Speaker 1: So let's see I'm gonna go to my youtube right now and see what it thinks like.

216
00:16:03,444 --> 00:16:06,206
Speaker 0: if I just go to youtube.com It's gonna tell you to watch like.

217
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,676
Speaker 1: Okay, here's what it wants me to see.

218
00:16:08,876 --> 00:16:13,750
Speaker 1: here's a whole bunch of likes clips from Star Trek bunch of Star Trek nonsense.

219
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,327
Speaker 1: Here's a bunch of games done quick stuff a bunch of more Star Trek nonsense.

220
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:20,250
Speaker 0: Oh, it seems like it works.

221
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:21,474
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is all.

222
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:25,850
Speaker 1: these are all things I would click on because that is the kind of stuff that I watch on YouTube.

223
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,454
Speaker 1: So it knows.

224
00:16:27,158 --> 00:17:07,708
Speaker 1: but let's say and a reporter I forget what note that was for did this for this YouTube story if you watch a bunch of unrelated videos that happen to prominently featured children on YouTube YouTube will start recommending to you Only those videos and you see a really bad cluster in a hurry that gets really rapidly into actually bad like bad on purpose content mm-hmm, so the algorithm is Allowing pedophiles and Nazis and bad people to more easily find the kinds of stuff they want to see even if what they want to see was not uploaded with the intention of giving it to them.

225
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:16,290
Speaker 1: and Those kinds of people tend to use the internet very heavily and comment very heavily and the algorithms seem to over represent them.

226
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:25,682
Speaker 1: That's why if you take a blank YouTube account and watch any video about movies You're almost immediately going to be recommended some misogynistic shitbag.

227
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:28,831
Speaker 1: talking about why the new Ghostbusters is anti-male Mm-hmm.

228
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,760
Speaker 1: Like this is a technology problem.

229
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:44,630
Speaker 0: that probably real technology problem is That there is so much video uploaded to YouTube every second That it is impossible to check it all with humans now that also wouldn't be a problem.

230
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,290
Speaker 0: Maybe the algorithms just say and the algorithms know even the best algorithm in the world is not any good.

231
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:56,570
Speaker 1: So maybe the algorithm should ignore channels that have less than like 5,000 subscribers or something.

232
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:58,217
Speaker 0: I mean there's things like that they can do.

233
00:17:58,298 --> 00:18:00,990
Speaker 0: but you know, yeah, so how do you know those channels?

234
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,696
Speaker 0: Probably don't have less than so.

235
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:08,379
Speaker 1: this intersects very heavily people with the huge Monetization model of YouTube right?

236
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,649
Speaker 0: so people get mad when I say this.

237
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,370
Speaker 0: But I don't think YouTube should pay anyone who uploads videos.

238
00:18:14,711 --> 00:18:15,916
Speaker 1: I agree a hundred percent right.

239
00:18:15,936 --> 00:18:19,170
Speaker 0: people are like, oh no, but all these youtubers like that's their job.

240
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,033
Speaker 0: You're saying they shouldn't.

241
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,201
Speaker 0: I say this fully full disclosure.

242
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:24,890
Speaker 1: I make decent money from our YouTube videos, right?

243
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,417
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know, you're like.

244
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:32,050
Speaker 0: no these craters need to be compensated and it's like well, hold on You're being compensated because you're getting free video hosting.

245
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:34,096
Speaker 0: Do you have any idea how much free video hosting costs?

246
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:35,520
Speaker 0: because a fortune.

247
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,750
Speaker 0: try to buy a web server and serve video.

248
00:18:39,072 --> 00:18:40,220
Speaker 0: Look at your bandwidth bill.

249
00:18:40,241 --> 00:18:44,136
Speaker 0: if you have any kind of viewership Yeah, right Look at your storage that it's gonna take up.

250
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:57,596
Speaker 0: look at all the trans coding you have to do to deliver though that video to every single possible device on earth and high quality and like such fast loading times to run your own personal YouTube would cost you a Fortune.

251
00:18:57,777 --> 00:18:59,428
Speaker 1: now the proper your own videos.

252
00:18:59,468 --> 00:18:59,630
Speaker 0: now.

253
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:05,570
Speaker 1: I would be fine with YouTube providing a way for you to make a deal with an advertise.

254
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:10,130
Speaker 0: You are so big on YouTube that you're you know, you deserve to be compensated.

255
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:16,746
Speaker 0: You could get compensated by you know Making deals with people for like product placement your videos sponsored videos all kinds.

256
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:17,749
Speaker 0: I'd also be okay.

257
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,050
Speaker 0: I just don't think YouTube should be paying you because then we can well, oh well, here's the caveat.

258
00:19:22,391 --> 00:19:29,419
Speaker 1: I don't think YouTube should be paying you for revenue from a generic sized ad distribution service.

259
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:38,990
Speaker 1: right if you make it fine if you Because someone subscribed to your channel and agreed to pay a dollar a month for you Like you're a tiny cable channel.

260
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:43,167
Speaker 0: This monetize demonetize based on your content thing.

261
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:43,870
Speaker 0: It's like no no, no.

262
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,336
Speaker 1: Well, because there's the problem that monetize.

263
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:58,930
Speaker 1: demonetize specifically means that if it's quote unquote monetized Advertisers you will never interact with are paying YouTube Directly for ads and YouTube is using other algorithms to say put these ads on these random videos.

264
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,800
Speaker 0: What it should be is by default.

265
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,906
Speaker 0: No one is monetized.

266
00:20:01,926 --> 00:20:04,664
Speaker 0: to get monetized You have to like make a contract and sign a deal.

267
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:06,851
Speaker 1: Yeah with an Advertiser.

268
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, not YouTube.

269
00:20:08,697 --> 00:20:09,520
Speaker 1: Maybe more YouTube.

270
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:10,002
Speaker 1: You do.

271
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,370
Speaker 0: my YouTube is like, okay, we're just let's sign a deal.

272
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, you specifically your content is good.

273
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 0: We like you.

274
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, and otherwise nothing you make should be monetized.

275
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,885
Speaker 0: You should be glad that you're getting free hosting.

276
00:20:19,905 --> 00:20:20,430
Speaker 0: That's your monitor.

277
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:34,416
Speaker 1: But the fact that YouTube is trying to monetize this based on basically AI and algorithms and ad networks Made this come to a head because the advertisers who buy YouTube ads tend to just buy them in bulk And it just makes sense to do like.

278
00:20:34,436 --> 00:20:35,400
Speaker 1: that's how you advertise.

279
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:37,388
Speaker 1: and then suddenly they all realized.

280
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:37,870
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

281
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,507
Speaker 0: The reason Google doesn't want to do this is basically that kills their inventory.

282
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:47,290
Speaker 0: Yep It also like but but it would also jack up the price on the inventory that it have.

283
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,752
Speaker 1: Well, I would also say that most of the people who are the loudest about how monetization like the monetization as exists today has to Stay alive.

284
00:20:54,773 --> 00:21:03,510
Speaker 1: our channels with like less than a thousand subscribers Like if even if you're quote unquote monetized you're making like 20 bucks a month.

285
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,850
Speaker 1: That is not enough money to bother.

286
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:08,858
Speaker 1: Yeah If you rely on that to make your channel.

287
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:11,527
Speaker 1: your problem is not with YouTube model is monetization.

288
00:21:11,747 --> 00:21:16,677
Speaker 0: your problem with People Problem is they already did it right.

289
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,002
Speaker 0: so people get real mad.

290
00:21:18,022 --> 00:21:19,890
Speaker 0: if you take any money away from them, right?

291
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:20,615
Speaker 0: They're getting a dollar.

292
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:21,562
Speaker 0: you take away that dollar.

293
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:22,327
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so mad.

294
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,329
Speaker 1: Yep Well, they also seem to think that they're gonna get big one day.

295
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:31,226
Speaker 0: But anyway, the problem is I also think the editor shouldn't have comments at all.

296
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:32,590
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, we'll get back to that.

297
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:34,937
Speaker 0: So why does that have cut?

298
00:21:34,957 --> 00:21:39,892
Speaker 0: what everyone all people do is talk about bad YouTube comments are they're so rarely Worthwhile.

299
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:50,939
Speaker 0: the only YouTube comments that are ever worthwhile are the ones that have a timecode so you can skip to the good part of the video like like in a speedrun and The ones that give you extra info that the video didn't include.

300
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,808
Speaker 0: otherwise comments on YouTube are pretty much 99.9% worthless.

301
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,098
Speaker 0: I'm willing to sacrifice the good ones.

302
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,409
Speaker 0: Just delete all YouTube comments and never bring them back.

303
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,550
Speaker 0: I would you want comments on your videos?

304
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,222
Speaker 0: Let people email you and contact you the creator directly somehow like Twitter or something.

305
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:10,220
Speaker 0: or or embed your video on your blog with the Comments under and then it does come into your problem.

306
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:25,770
Speaker 1: or if I were YouTube, you know what I would do Provide an API because if you're big enough you might want comments, but YouTube just provides the UI In YouTube for that but the comments actually go through whatever internal system you've got for moderation.

307
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,985
Speaker 0: Because the main reason that's got a lot of problems.

308
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:30,695
Speaker 1: Well Well, that's just another platform.

309
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:31,698
Speaker 1: It's a commenting plan.

310
00:22:31,758 --> 00:22:34,586
Speaker 0: I put my comments on YouTube and that's it's like.

311
00:22:34,626 --> 00:22:35,629
Speaker 0: that's a huge problem.

312
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:35,950
Speaker 0: Why?

313
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,693
Speaker 0: Technologically speaking?

314
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:41,082
Speaker 0: now, it's like I'm infesting YouTube with my with my comment.

315
00:22:41,122 --> 00:22:43,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've built that semi federated.

316
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,102
Speaker 1: The problem with YouTube comments too.

317
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:53,238
Speaker 1: is that like on our channel the comments are actually pretty good Because the kinds of people that watch our videos.

318
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,743
Speaker 1: we're not like mass-market.

319
00:22:54,883 --> 00:22:56,930
Speaker 0: I'm willing to sacrifice my YouTube.

320
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:04,155
Speaker 1: Yeah, well also I'd leave comments on but I every now and if I gained any sort of traction on YouTube I would I would.

321
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:06,666
Speaker 1: just I would end comments permanently if I had my druthers.

322
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:07,027
Speaker 1: Don't worry.

323
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:07,630
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong.

324
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:15,423
Speaker 1: this is the same conversation that webcomics had back when webcomics first became big and suddenly every webcomic had its own forum.

325
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:20,650
Speaker 1: that was full of bullshit and A bunch of voices came out and said why does a webcomic even need a forum?

326
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:21,551
Speaker 1: Like.

327
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:21,933
Speaker 1: why does it?

328
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:24,490
Speaker 0: because the reason of a form is because you're trying to build a community.

329
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,804
Speaker 0: Yeah for your audience right be to have you have a community.

330
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,190
Speaker 0: You got to manage the community.

331
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:30,930
Speaker 1: I'm like the geek nice forum we manage.

332
00:23:31,694 --> 00:23:33,745
Speaker 0: You know if you're trying to make money and not like.

333
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:37,882
Speaker 0: we're not trying to make money But if you are you got to translate the community into money somehow.

334
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:37,962
Speaker 0: Yep.

335
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:39,990
Speaker 1: The only reason the geek nights community works.

336
00:23:40,132 --> 00:23:41,730
Speaker 1: I think the geek nice community is really good.

337
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,936
Speaker 1: I really like our forum.

338
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:45,630
Speaker 1: culture is because one we're not trying to make money.

339
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,608
Speaker 1: So we're more than willing to tell Nazis and pedophiles to fuck off.

340
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:57,827
Speaker 1: But YouTube as much as they don't want to admit it Rely on pedophiles and Nazis for a big enough percentage of their revenue to where now they're in trouble over it.

341
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:58,249
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

342
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,344
Speaker 1: So this situation is big and the solutions are things no one wants to hear.

343
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:17,800
Speaker 1: because the end result of all this so far is that Advertisers said whoa YouTube unless you can guarantee that my video my ad will not be shown next to some pedophile nonsense I'm not buying any more YouTube ads.

344
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:18,424
Speaker 1: full stop.

345
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:22,801
Speaker 0: if you're an advertiser The thing is usually I'm in favor of things to hurt advertisers.

346
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,650
Speaker 0: Both of these policies are pro advertiser.

347
00:24:26,873 --> 00:24:28,839
Speaker 0: If you're an advertiser you buy YouTube ads.

348
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:34,274
Speaker 0: they put your ads on all kinds of videos videos that are probably Mostly by bots.

349
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:40,989
Speaker 0: you target them somewhat, but you don't target them, you know, you know like perfectly, you know You can't narrow it down that much.

350
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:45,924
Speaker 0: Yeah Your ad could show up on my video if someone done without adblock watches it.

351
00:24:46,005 --> 00:24:48,012
Speaker 0: if you like buy a gaming ad or something Right.

352
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:51,189
Speaker 0: that can happen and that was just a worthless ad buy for you.

353
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:52,936
Speaker 0: They should make it to where.

354
00:24:53,337 --> 00:25:06,141
Speaker 0: if you're an ad buyer you specifically list the exact Videos and channels that you want your ad to appear on and it will not appear anywhere else Right, and it's like, okay all you other people everyone can be monetized now,

355
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:09,050
Speaker 1: but all right, and then YouTube just provides

356
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:19,890
Speaker 0: ripping off advertisers by playing their ads and making them pay to show those ads on All these garbage videos all over YouTube with all this worthless inventory.

357
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:22,390
Speaker 1: So I think a lot of people are buying ads.

358
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,135
Speaker 1: I mean this is my speculation.

359
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:27,036
Speaker 0: Google lets you have some of the YouTube money But they're every time someone watches that ad.

360
00:25:27,076 --> 00:25:31,530
Speaker 0: they also get money from the advertisers by selling your worthless video inventory.

361
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:38,110
Speaker 1: I suspect a lot of the people buying ads are starting to question the value of the YouTube advertising network as a whole.

362
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:39,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

363
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:42,047
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know why people who buy ads buy any online ads.

364
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:42,770
Speaker 0: They're all worthless.

365
00:25:43,012 --> 00:26:00,654
Speaker 1: Well, I think the big difference is that Because it's a lot of work to figure out where to advertise assuming an advertisers acting in good faith that Everyone who tries to sell an advertiser ad space is probably ripping them off and the ad networks just made the problem disappear But not go away.

366
00:26:01,095 --> 00:26:02,821
Speaker 0: It's because ad buyers right.

367
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:04,307
Speaker 0: if you're an ad buyer, that's your job.

368
00:26:04,327 --> 00:26:05,712
Speaker 0: That's actually a job You can have.

369
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:07,198
Speaker 0: yeah is you're not you don't make.

370
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:08,362
Speaker 1: I have been an ad buyer.

371
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,507
Speaker 1: I've done that professionally.

372
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,350
Speaker 1: it fucking sucks.

373
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:17,350
Speaker 0: No, like there's people that's their full-time job is yeah, someone else makes the ads they you know Like they're not the creative person like comes up with cool ads.

374
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:26,198
Speaker 0: They just go around buying ad inventory to and then getting those ads to play there And what they do is then they go and show their boss Look look where I got our look.

375
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,210
Speaker 0: if you watch this awesome popular YouTube video our ad shows up.

376
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,765
Speaker 0: Look, if you look at at this billboard in Times Square.

377
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:32,449
Speaker 0: our ad is there.

378
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, aren't you proud of all the places our company is?

379
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,805
Speaker 0: look we're on the Super Bowl.

380
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,568
Speaker 0: Look look at all the places I got us.

381
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:44,270
Speaker 0: They don't have ever actually proved because they can't that those ads were effective or those are good buys or anything like that.

382
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:50,410
Speaker 0: All they do is impress the boss by making them proud of all the places their company logo has appeared, right?

383
00:26:50,971 --> 00:26:53,760
Speaker 0: So that's the person who decides where to buy ads.

384
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,870
Speaker 0: they don't give a fuck if they're effective or if the money is well spent.

385
00:26:57,151 --> 00:27:09,230
Speaker 0: They just want to increase their department's budget and impress the boss by having the company logo and ad appear in the most, you know Prestigious places, so there's a lot going on with that and we'll just move on to something else.

386
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:12,084
Speaker 1: So here's the funny one cops in Winnipeg.

387
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:22,476
Speaker 1: I guess they use encryption software to encrypt the Communication they do on their radios to prevent people like me from just listening to the police blotter I guess in Canada.

388
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:27,254
Speaker 0: It's not like the US where the police radio has to be Unencrypted or whatever.

389
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:27,877
Speaker 1: I'm pretty.

390
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:31,191
Speaker 1: I think there are jurisdictions in the US now where it's encrypted It's.

391
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:39,447
Speaker 0: I don't know what the law is regarding that but I mean there is a culture in the u.s Of people listening to police when I was a kid has historically been very unencrypted.

392
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:45,545
Speaker 1: when I was a kid Or you can just listen when I was a kid We had a 14 channel police scanner that we just left on in the house.

393
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:46,650
Speaker 0: They just sold him a RadioShack.

394
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:50,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go to RadioShack buy one of these things and then be a crazy old man listening to police radio.

395
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:54,307
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then what you had to do is know which crystal you have citizen app.

396
00:27:54,347 --> 00:28:02,402
Speaker 1: You don't need it yeah, you have to know which crystals to buy to put into the slots because Variable frequency tuning radios like that for police stuff.

397
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:04,629
Speaker 1: We're not available to the public are much easier.

398
00:28:04,709 --> 00:28:05,753
Speaker 0: now In fact is out.

399
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:07,118
Speaker 1: there's a software that there's.

400
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:07,419
Speaker 0: also.

401
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,249
Speaker 0: there are certain kinds of radios that are gonna be going like out of.

402
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:12,477
Speaker 0: Possibly might be illegal soon.

403
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,666
Speaker 0: So people are ham nerds are buying them up lately.

404
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,047
Speaker 0: Yep.

405
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:19,829
Speaker 1: It's a certain kind I forget but yeah as a kid like when we were driving around we'd listen to the police because it was fun.

406
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:21,556
Speaker 1: Like did we'd listen to?

407
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,964
Speaker 1: we just listen to cops like heaven thing is like.

408
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:29,142
Speaker 0: doing it like a little bit is fun Right, but doing it a whole bunch gets real boring and real.

409
00:28:29,323 --> 00:28:31,530
Speaker 0: it's like if you keep doing it then it becomes a problem.

410
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:34,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I feel like at that point you're storing jars of your own pee.

411
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:40,888
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like I only check citizen app when like I heard way too many sirens people were like staring at citizen app.

412
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:41,469
Speaker 0: That's a problem.

413
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,625
Speaker 1: So basically is best I can tell.

414
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:57,140
Speaker 1: what happened here is that the police were using these encrypted radios and there's a company that provides the encryption software and And they need to be updated frequently and to update them.

415
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,447
Speaker 1: You need to buy a refresh key from the company.

416
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:05,059
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and Motorola charged $94 per update per radio.

417
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,790
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and there were lots of radios.

418
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:15,569
Speaker 1: so Someone bought a bunch of these keys and I made finger quotes here because they bought them.

419
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:28,481
Speaker 1: the same way You're buying a Windows 10 key on a website somewhere and bought 65,000 of them and told the police you don't want to know where these came from and the police have been pirating the software and It's a big goddamn deal now.

420
00:29:28,501 --> 00:29:31,437
Speaker 0: Oh The police should be pirating.

421
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:47,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the problem is I don't want Civil infrastructure in any country to be reliant on a single privately held vendor or Public company that is not public in the government owns it.

422
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:51,733
Speaker 0: The best thing to do would be for the government to just say a law and be like, hey Guess what?

423
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:54,230
Speaker 0: You have to provide you have to give it to us for free top shit.

424
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,730
Speaker 0: We make a law we can just tell you to do whatever we want.

425
00:29:57,553 --> 00:30:00,423
Speaker 0: But if they're failing that piracy next best choice?

426
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:05,266
Speaker 1: or how about a law that says, you know police radios have to be encrypted blah blah blah.

427
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:10,219
Speaker 1: and here is a. vendors have to provide it at a statutory cost.

428
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,166
Speaker 1: and here's the list of vendors that have to provide it.

429
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:19,710
Speaker 1: and you could make a Regulation that balances free market economics with the fact that the government shouldn't rely on private companies for shit like this.

430
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:22,137
Speaker 1: But instead it looks like these couches pirated it.

431
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,421
Speaker 1: I didn't read the full story.

432
00:30:23,682 --> 00:30:24,124
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

433
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:25,910
Speaker 1: All right, let's move on.

434
00:30:26,674 --> 00:30:30,695
Speaker 1: So as we know for a long time They have like the FCC.

435
00:30:30,776 --> 00:30:40,264
Speaker 1: one of the things the FCC is supposed to do is get public comments to inform decision-making around the kind of technology the FCC is in charge of.

436
00:30:40,284 --> 00:30:41,767
Speaker 1: mm-hmm makes sense, right?

437
00:30:41,988 --> 00:30:50,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, so If it wasn't obvious to all of you basically those comments for a long time now have been entirely fake generated by like.

438
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,622
Speaker 1: Russian bot farms and Lobbyists in the US filled out that form to make comments.

439
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,530
Speaker 0: It's hard to fill out that form with a lot of stuff.

440
00:30:57,872 --> 00:31:00,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, it shouldn't be hard to figure out which ones are fake.

441
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:07,154
Speaker 1: I think before the Russian trolls and bot farms and lobbyists started doing it automatically I'm pretty sure.

442
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:15,470
Speaker 1: even in the old days they made it hard to do on purpose to keep people like us Because it's an old shitty government website and you got to fill in all those bureaucratic crap.

443
00:31:15,657 --> 00:31:18,712
Speaker 1: Yep so I guess the broader question is One.

444
00:31:18,732 --> 00:31:23,290
Speaker 1: there are only two ways to address this problem now because I we can't do a whole show on this right now.

445
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,566
Speaker 1: We got a lot of news to cover.

446
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:35,438
Speaker 1: either We need to Forget the idea that the FCC gets comments from the public because there's literally no way to do it Effectively like it's just gonna be spammed.

447
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:36,765
Speaker 1: There's no way to control it.

448
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:47,110
Speaker 1: or Nerds need to make their own troll farms to flood the FCC With the actually right things to do around things like net neutrality.

449
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:57,278
Speaker 1: I feel like the collected nerds in America could send more comments to the FCC that are prone at neutrality than all the lobbyists Next time there's a thing.

450
00:31:57,439 --> 00:31:58,322
Speaker 0: I'm not even hiding it.

451
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,265
Speaker 0: I'm just going for it.

452
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,008
Speaker 0: I think we should.

453
00:32:00,228 --> 00:32:05,350
Speaker 0: we're gonna go We're gonna flood that shit and we're gonna go to tech war because that's not hard to do.

454
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:06,575
Speaker 1: It's like the toner war.

455
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,201
Speaker 0: It's a really easy tech war to fight.

456
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,430
Speaker 1: It is bot bot farmers bot farm.

457
00:32:10,972 --> 00:32:15,386
Speaker 0: I'll make a program and I'll say everyone run this program run it instead of your Bitcoin miner.

458
00:32:15,848 --> 00:32:20,300
Speaker 1: Yep, right Maybe you use a simple pseudo AI on grandma's.

459
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,002
Speaker 1: easy.

460
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:24,070
Speaker 1: It generates a slightly different message from everybody.

461
00:32:24,974 --> 00:32:25,597
Speaker 0: All kinds of stuff.

462
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,350
Speaker 1: I mean Russia's ahead of us and I've had of our country on this game.

463
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,576
Speaker 1: I feel like nerds in the u.s.

464
00:32:29,596 --> 00:32:30,219
Speaker 1: Needs to step up.

465
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:30,581
Speaker 1: Yep.

466
00:32:31,164 --> 00:32:32,209
Speaker 1: All right, let's move along too.

467
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:43,263
Speaker 1: So I saw this article and a lot of people think that they because they pay some random Scandinavian or Nordic sounding company like Nord VPN.

468
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:44,587
Speaker 1: Yep, five bucks a month.

469
00:32:44,707 --> 00:32:49,181
Speaker 1: It's not a bad VPN Yeah, but there's a lot of them that are vaguely Nordic sounding.

470
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:52,130
Speaker 0: Yeah that I think Nord VPN is actually from Panama.

471
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see where I'm going with this.

472
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:08,624
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you pay one of these people some amount a month and you have all your internet traffic on your phone go through a VPN Then your privacy is protected Somewhat and that is sort of true, but not really to protecting yourself.

473
00:33:08,644 --> 00:33:10,410
Speaker 0: Your ISP won't see your traffic, right?

474
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:16,790
Speaker 0: So you got one of those ISPs that keeps shutting you down for downloading, you know, brand-new Hollywood movies all the time.

475
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:22,175
Speaker 0: Yeah, the VPN will 99% probably protect you from that To this day.

476
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:30,053
Speaker 1: I I will not confirm or deny but I'm confident that that kind of traffic is traverse this network In volume.

477
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:34,309
Speaker 1: over the last decade in my entire life an ISP has never come after me.

478
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:42,444
Speaker 0: No I don't understand how this happens to other people as I'm downloading not Like the brand-new because they're only looking at like specific things right like who's downloading.

479
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:43,306
Speaker 0: What's a really new movie?

480
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,450
Speaker 0: That's super hot, right?

481
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a movie that was in theaters like fucking right now.

482
00:33:47,261 --> 00:33:48,185
Speaker 0: They're looking for that shit.

483
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:48,948
Speaker 0: They're not looking for.

484
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:54,838
Speaker 0: Korean variety shows out bit torrent Season six of Adventure Time that door.

485
00:33:54,859 --> 00:33:59,659
Speaker 1: they're not looking for that, but there's this article that's just like How do you decide which VPN to trust in?

486
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,010
Speaker 1: the one there's a website Scott's linked to a million times.

487
00:34:02,211 --> 00:34:05,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's I think it's called that security that one privacy site.

488
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:18,670
Speaker 0: Yep, and it basically has a whole spreadsheet of every major VPN provider and all the you know Basically details about which ones have which features and you can decide for yourself which one you want to trust.

489
00:34:19,212 --> 00:34:22,650
Speaker 0: And if you trust this site, I trust that one privacy site.

490
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:23,273
Speaker 0: You know what?

491
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:27,009
Speaker 1: It has the same kind of look that the actual putty site has.

492
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,719
Speaker 0: This has the look of a trustworthy website.

493
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:33,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, it actually kind of does which is funny We're not joking.

494
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,409
Speaker 0: It looks like a certain a site that a nerd a certain kind of nerd put a lot of effort into.

495
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,929
Speaker 1: It is definitely not fake a site that has in all caps.

496
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:45,110
Speaker 1: Please be patient as it may take some time for the sheet to load.

497
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,489
Speaker 1: There's a certain kind of person who types those words into a website.

498
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:55,007
Speaker 1: But this this question comes up a lot in mainstream technology news.

499
00:34:55,087 --> 00:34:56,090
Speaker 1: I want to address it right now.

500
00:34:56,650 --> 00:35:03,210
Speaker 1: Anytime you're using anything to control what people people see about your data like VPNs privacy stuff.

501
00:35:04,092 --> 00:35:11,650
Speaker 1: You've just the question is do you trust company a or company B or company C or nerd D who emailed you?

502
00:35:12,692 --> 00:35:14,921
Speaker 1: The only question is how do you decide who to trust?

503
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:17,793
Speaker 1: because you gotta trust someone Like.

504
00:35:18,114 --> 00:35:20,501
Speaker 1: there's no way to know that a VPN is secure.

505
00:35:20,742 --> 00:35:23,110
Speaker 1: You've got to trust someone's word on it at some point.

506
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:25,861
Speaker 1: There's no way for you to ever figure this out on your own.

507
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:27,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, I talked to rim through a secret tunnel.

508
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:29,679
Speaker 0: great We know no one is spying on us.

509
00:35:30,222 --> 00:35:31,268
Speaker 0: What if rim is spying on?

510
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:35,815
Speaker 1: Yep If I'm spying on Scott or Scott spying on me One of us is fine.

511
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:40,430
Speaker 0: All right, the connection between my computer and Amazon's computer is a hundred percent sealed and secure.

512
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:49,249
Speaker 0: No one can spy on us and I tell Amazon my credit card number so they can let me buy something and then Amazon steals my credit card, yep, it's like Alright, here's one.

513
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:58,513
Speaker 1: so in gaming a big problem in online gaming competitive gaming competitive online ortho gaming is Cheating right?

514
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:06,743
Speaker 0: So most games these days, you know big multiplayer online games have some sort of anti-cheat Technologies built in the steam vac.

515
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:07,870
Speaker 0: There's all kinds of stuff, right?

516
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:17,786
Speaker 0: So there's some very popular anti-cheat software that has not been named and for some reason In Windows 10 in this one preview built.

517
00:36:17,806 --> 00:36:25,636
Speaker 0: so Windows 10 If you don't realize most of you are probably just using normalize Windows 10 or Windows 7 even and maybe Windows 8 Who knows not.

518
00:36:25,676 --> 00:36:27,790
Speaker 0: was there a 9 and skip 9 right anyway?

519
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:41,705
Speaker 1: Yeah, they skip 9 because they were worried that the string like win 9 X like win 9 would be confused by Shitty old programs who look for win 9 5 anyway win 9 a. there was a string problem.

520
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:50,470
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that There's preview builds you can get and you can get newer future versions of Windows 10 before they're released.

521
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,157
Speaker 0: And there's one that like updates every day.

522
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:52,960
Speaker 0: That's like super hot.

523
00:36:53,603 --> 00:37:00,430
Speaker 0: and there's one that's like, okay This one's more stable, but it's it's still way ahead of the one that normal people are using, right?

524
00:37:00,831 --> 00:37:16,689
Speaker 0: So that super hot one has this bug where if you're using playing certain games Which is actually quite a few serious big-name games that have anti-cheat certain anti-cheat software You will get the green screen of death trying to play those games pretty much consistently because of this bug.

525
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:30,339
Speaker 1: now I would suspect part of the issue is that anti-cheat software to be successful needs to do a lot of the kinds of things that computers don't want you to do like Inspecting the memory that another application is using right?

526
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:33,448
Speaker 0: So Microsoft I guess knows which patch they made.

527
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:34,290
Speaker 0: that's causing this.

528
00:37:34,431 --> 00:37:35,649
Speaker 0: But they're not unpatching it.

529
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:39,270
Speaker 0: They want the anti-cheat software to make a patch and it has not done.

530
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:55,293
Speaker 0: So the result is that that other preview build the sort of more stable one, which is used a lot by gaming people who kind of people would overclock and yeah frames rates and all those kinds of people are actually one of the biggest consumers Of that build.

531
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:59,690
Speaker 0: the more stable not super nightly, but way ahead of normal people build.

532
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,524
Speaker 0: I forget they have names for them.

533
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:05,017
Speaker 0: But anyway They're big consumer of that build.

534
00:38:05,558 --> 00:38:17,738
Speaker 0: so even though Microsoft would like to update that build more frequently They haven't updated it in a super long-ass time you know because They can't because they'll crack the green screen of death.

535
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:19,443
Speaker 0: Everyone is playing games with that build.

536
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:20,246
Speaker 1: Yep.

537
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:25,010
Speaker 0: Ah And they could undo their patch, but they don't seem to want to do that either.

538
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:29,070
Speaker 0: They need this unnamed anti-cheat software to update itself.

539
00:38:29,692 --> 00:38:35,610
Speaker 0: And I guess they don't want to go without that patch and the cheating people don't want to make that patch.

540
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:42,859
Speaker 0: So the windows 10 is like all held up by this By this one some anti-cheat software somewhere.

541
00:38:42,879 --> 00:38:45,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, I presume, you know, maybe it's valve steam vac.

542
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,510
Speaker 0: I don't know it could be anything.

543
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:47,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know which one it is.

544
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,710
Speaker 1: I don't know a lot of that guy just saw it.

545
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,588
Speaker 0: It's like some other company is holding up windows Unless Microsoft undoes its patch and they don't seem like they want to.

546
00:38:55,689 --> 00:39:06,867
Speaker 1: yep I guess their anti-cheat software is difficult to do because the problem is that people are running third-party software that somehow fucks with software that is itself already verified.

547
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:12,928
Speaker 1: all the I all the Obvious ideas you can think of to solve this problem are already being done and aren't enough.

548
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:15,947
Speaker 0: like no It's a. have your entire game server side the end.

549
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:17,973
Speaker 0: That's all you gotta do.

550
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:24,142
Speaker 0: if somebody does some sort of cheating that only manipulates like the inputs good for you You win.

551
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:25,754
Speaker 1: yeah The thing is there.

552
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:26,536
Speaker 1: we are cheating.

553
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,904
Speaker 0: software looks at the screen and then moves the map.

554
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:34,281
Speaker 0: you looks at the frame buffer Five uses computer imaging to find targets and then moves the mouse.

555
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:36,427
Speaker 1: I want to see cheating software.

556
00:39:36,447 --> 00:39:37,250
Speaker 1: You're allowed to do that.

557
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:47,410
Speaker 1: I want to see cheating software that looks at your screen and moves the mouse but also Searches twitch and YouTube to try to find other people who happen to be streaming the game you're in and incorporates that data.

558
00:39:47,773 --> 00:39:49,405
Speaker 0: I mean, that's just automated stream sniping.

559
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:59,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's No way to detect or stop that right but as long as you know You're not like messing with the game itself as long as you're cheating on the the input output side.

560
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:00,890
Speaker 0: That's okay.

561
00:40:01,092 --> 00:40:06,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm okay with that But just keep the entire game server side that we know could cheat unless the hacker server wish they can.

562
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:09,721
Speaker 1: so really tiny news Someone pointed out.

563
00:40:09,802 --> 00:40:13,629
Speaker 1: I think this was from some RIAA report.

564
00:40:14,493 --> 00:40:24,844
Speaker 1: More people bought physical CDs and vinyl then bought iTunes songs last year, which duh I think that was I assume is still buying CDs and vinyl right?

565
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,990
Speaker 0: Well, I guess old people are buying CDs.

566
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,706
Speaker 0: yeah, right because they just won't go digital.

567
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:38,678
Speaker 0: and then All kinds of people are buying vinyl because they're not buying the music that like they're not buying the vinyl Buying it to collect the vinyl.

568
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:43,683
Speaker 0: a lot of you and some people for some reason have this You know idea that vinyl is better and they're wrong.

569
00:40:43,784 --> 00:40:44,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely wrong.

570
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,850
Speaker 0: Some people admit the vinyls worse, but they have a nostalgic thing for and do it.

571
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:49,778
Speaker 0: Anyway, fine.

572
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:50,524
Speaker 1: All right.

573
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:51,130
Speaker 1: I like I can.

574
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:52,650
Speaker 0: That's your thing.

575
00:40:52,891 --> 00:40:53,373
Speaker 1: I can see.

576
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:57,690
Speaker 1: like I do enjoy the ritual of putting a vinyl record on a turntable because I remember doing that.

577
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,502
Speaker 0: People buy vinyl cuz they're a DJ and they use two turntables and a microphone.

578
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,367
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe they use that digital vinyl.

579
00:41:03,688 --> 00:41:04,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

580
00:41:05,031 --> 00:41:08,369
Speaker 0: But who the hell would buy an mp3 when you see Apple music Spotify?

581
00:41:08,429 --> 00:41:13,359
Speaker 0: Yep I stream music because if you're already getting an mp3 Why not use some higher up?

582
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:19,722
Speaker 1: because the vast majority of people who listen to music Don't care about music enough to buy every song they care about.

583
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:22,290
Speaker 1: they're gonna just stream the music that's popular.

584
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:25,981
Speaker 0: That's the only time I ever buy an mp3.

585
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:34,749
Speaker 0: in these days is when there's a super Not, you know indie band such that I could not pirate their mp3 on Pirate Bay because they're too small.

586
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:43,515
Speaker 0: They're also not on Spotify or Apple or Apple music or Google Play or whatever because they're for whatever reason But they're on like bandcamp.

587
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:49,473
Speaker 0: pretty much bandcamp is the only site I buy music from yep these days and I will go I'll Say oh your albums there.

588
00:41:49,553 --> 00:41:53,022
Speaker 0: Okay, here's $2 or I already kick-started you.

589
00:41:53,323 --> 00:42:03,370
Speaker 1: Give me that mp3s for free and then or else I I have individually bought wave and flak files from individual artists who sold them directly from their websites.

590
00:42:03,992 --> 00:42:04,674
Speaker 0: That's basically a bank.

591
00:42:04,694 --> 00:42:06,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's just like one.

592
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:07,685
Speaker 1: It's not even a bandcamp.

593
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:17,250
Speaker 1: It's just like here's my website So rare that's like yeah twice a year Maybe but even then that music was also on a shocking number of streaming services.

594
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,027
Speaker 0: It is shocking how much Spotify is really like got everything.

595
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:34,330
Speaker 1: There's not much That's not there but I think that the end the world is moving toward on demand streaming for music and a small number of people who care a Lot about music itself are going to do things like collect vinyl.

596
00:42:35,194 --> 00:42:41,239
Speaker 1: I feel like there should be market in the future of everything streams But you can pay to get a flak file.

597
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,390
Speaker 1: That's like mastered or I think audio file nonsense.

598
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,019
Speaker 1: Multitrack split out, you know what?

599
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:47,741
Speaker 1: I really like to see.

600
00:42:47,761 --> 00:42:56,590
Speaker 1: you could buy an album for like 40 bucks But it comes with all the tracks like the actual mastering data from the studio.

601
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,663
Speaker 0: No one's gonna give you for remixes and it comes no as giving you that.

602
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:01,270
Speaker 1: and it comes with a license to remix.

603
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,437
Speaker 0: No one's giving you that.

604
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:03,504
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's not for 40 bucks.

605
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:05,676
Speaker 1: For 400 bucks.

606
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:09,010
Speaker 0: master license cost way more than that depends on what you're doing with it.

607
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:15,881
Speaker 0: anyway, the point is what I would like to see is You know, like I just said Spotify for example has fucking everything almost.

608
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:17,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are things it doesn't have.

609
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:19,573
Speaker 0: it's not a hundred percent It's just.

610
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,707
Speaker 0: it's really hard to find something doesn't have all right.

611
00:43:22,473 --> 00:43:28,790
Speaker 0: And what they should do is they just be like, all right If I search for something on Spotify and it's not on there and even the Beatles are on there now.

612
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,469
Speaker 0: Okay, so it's like it's like come on you searches on and it's not on there.

613
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:36,947
Speaker 0: That's when it should say all right look This album is not here.

614
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:40,220
Speaker 0: Give us five dollars and you will.

615
00:43:40,742 --> 00:43:42,288
Speaker 0: you don't bother downloading mp3s.

616
00:43:43,091 --> 00:43:46,865
Speaker 0: You just give us five dollars right now and then you will work it out.

617
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:48,030
Speaker 0: this specific artist.

618
00:43:48,131 --> 00:43:49,942
Speaker 0: Well, you know who doesn't want to be on Spotify.

619
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,330
Speaker 1: They'll get four dollars, right?

620
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,050
Speaker 0: We'll give them the money and then you can have that on Spotify, right?

621
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:58,210
Speaker 0: Well, so they unlock the streaming of it for you forever.

622
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:05,134
Speaker 0: Yep, right by paying this money and maybe even give you the mp3s if you want them also sure go ahead and download them You don't have to.

623
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:05,918
Speaker 0: it's like do you?

624
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:12,585
Speaker 1: I used to collect music because you know The world was different and I have a directory that I've copied from computer to computer to computer forever.

625
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:15,970
Speaker 0: That's a lot of mp3s I have that I have that directory also.

626
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:22,430
Speaker 1: I've added maybe a hundred mp3s to that directory in the last five years like nothing to it.

627
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,823
Speaker 0: so actually now would be you know, it's like I could go back and organize.

628
00:44:25,923 --> 00:44:25,984
Speaker 0: it.

629
00:44:26,024 --> 00:44:30,340
Speaker 0: now would be a good time because Yeah, it's so, you know, it's not changing.

630
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,050
Speaker 0: So it's not hard to you know, once I organize it, I'll be done forever.

631
00:44:33,492 --> 00:44:36,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I can also delete a lot of things from it that are on spot.

632
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:39,653
Speaker 1: Yeah like I have a lot of my mp3s are.

633
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:50,229
Speaker 1: I have every OC remix because I downloaded a package of all of them from OC remixes in like Only need to get the music from there that I can't get anywhere else.

634
00:44:50,812 --> 00:44:53,726
Speaker 0: If there's a song in there that I can get easily from another source.

635
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:56,027
Speaker 1: I don't need it all right, let's burn through a few of these.

636
00:44:56,047 --> 00:45:00,120
Speaker 1: so Real technology news Linux 5 came out.

637
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,163
Speaker 0: whatever they did.

638
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,687
Speaker 0: The numbers now are arbitrary.

639
00:45:02,748 --> 00:45:04,012
Speaker 1: literally doesn't matter They're not.

640
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:07,830
Speaker 0: they're no longer changing the number in relation to a significant software change.

641
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:11,447
Speaker 0: Here's the thing most of arbitrarily making the number go up when they feel like it.

642
00:45:11,648 --> 00:45:24,869
Speaker 1: nerds Like us would care about Linux kernels back when Linux was used on the desktop and it was like I need the kernel to support My weird bullshit hardware like there was a reason like my Wi-Fi won't work yet stuff like that.

643
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:38,157
Speaker 1: Nowadays, it's just server operating system software and If you're the person who manages servers, just keep your stuff reasonably up-to-date And that's it very rarely.

644
00:45:38,218 --> 00:45:41,688
Speaker 1: Is there a feature coming in the kernel that you need in production today?

645
00:45:41,768 --> 00:45:42,350
Speaker 1: for a reason?

646
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,696
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, like DRB.

647
00:45:43,756 --> 00:45:44,480
Speaker 1: D is already there.

648
00:45:44,541 --> 00:45:53,408
Speaker 1: like stuffs already there Linux kernel releases are about as newsworthy even to nerds as like what's in the next Windows patch.

649
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:58,530
Speaker 1: Yep Uh, here's an interesting tech news that none of you will care about.

650
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:05,341
Speaker 1: w3c approved a Standard for password free logins on websites like a universal standard.

651
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:10,430
Speaker 0: all your browsers already have this but they're not using it because Websites aren't using it properly.

652
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,712
Speaker 1: Yep, or maybe in your phone like you want to you want to have a standard where I could say log into website X with My thumbprint.

653
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:24,357
Speaker 1: so there is an official standard kind of like the standard that we use with our TOTP for two-factor and our Fido keys.

654
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:42,149
Speaker 1: This is in that same suite to allow you to use things like Fido keys and Biometrics or whatever you want to use for password direct passwordless authentication to websites instead of just relying on your browser Saving the password in a store to paste into a form.

655
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:57,299
Speaker 1: It's good news and only people who held the only people who will care about the fact that the w3c approved This are the people who work in companies and are implementing this for websites and for authentication systems Like nerds won't care.

656
00:46:57,319 --> 00:46:58,789
Speaker 1: It'll just start working on your phones.

657
00:47:00,792 --> 00:47:02,259
Speaker 1: I think we can stop there.

658
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,545
Speaker 1: We've gone on for a long time.

659
00:47:03,766 --> 00:47:04,228
Speaker 0: Okay, good.

660
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:04,570
Speaker 0: I'm hungry.

661
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:06,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's just stop cuz I'm also hungry.

662
00:47:06,676 --> 00:47:09,685
Speaker 1: I don't use before is not that interesting to talk about yet?

663
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:11,130
Speaker 1: foldable phones.

664
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:14,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's all I got.

665
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:15,685
Speaker 1: we're gonna eat some food.

666
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:16,467
Speaker 1: Oh one last news.

667
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:17,169
Speaker 1: this one's really funny.

668
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,929
Speaker 1: Apple Has Apple stores all over the world?

669
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:35,869
Speaker 1: They're a part apparently closing two of their stores in, Texas Because those are the only two stores they have in a particular judicial district the Eastern District of Texas Which for various reasons is where?

670
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:43,926
Speaker 1: Almost every patent troll in the world files their lawsuit to try to extort money out of tech companies in the u.s.

671
00:47:43,966 --> 00:47:46,598
Speaker 0: Right because there's some Corrupt judges there.

672
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,180
Speaker 0: Yep.

673
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:55,145
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons Updated February 22nd as this news a little old Apple has confirmed.

674
00:47:55,165 --> 00:48:00,710
Speaker 1: They will be closing the stores And they're relocating the employees like they're helping everybody out.

675
00:48:01,071 --> 00:48:09,603
Speaker 1: So basically Apple saying if we close these two Apple stores And we don't do any business in this Eastern District of Texas clearly won't do.

676
00:48:09,904 --> 00:48:13,594
Speaker 0: then you cannot get you know Patent suits for us.

677
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:16,163
Speaker 0: do it in that district because we're not doing business in that district.

678
00:48:16,544 --> 00:48:27,309
Speaker 1: and it's interesting because I suspect a lot Of these patent troll cases could not easily get past the first round if they file in any other district in America Yep, so we'll see how this plays out.

679
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:29,055
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing that

680
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:32,185
Speaker 0: they are putting one Apple store basically right across the board yep,

681
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:55,628
Speaker 1: so on one hand I don't think gigantic multi-billion dollar corporations should be able to Skirt the judicial system by closing a star, but on the other hand Apple is generally not in the wrong in these patent troll lawsuits and the judicial system and Congress have failed to address this fundamental problem in copyright and patent law.

682
00:48:55,729 --> 00:49:11,361
Speaker 0: well I think part of the problem is not just you know the lack of the the Congress's ability to fix the patent laws yeah, there's no more patent trolls, but also this question of like Districts and jurisdiction don't work in the modern world when it's like.

683
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:18,570
Speaker 0: it's like there needs to just be sort of like this Federal like general federal court court of the internet right where it's like.

684
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,979
Speaker 0: It's like Apple is a countrywide deal.

685
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,870
Speaker 0: if you sue them you shouldn't be able to like pick a spot.

686
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:27,230
Speaker 0: So here is the old side about the geography have to do with it, right?

687
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,001
Speaker 0: It's like if Apple fucks up everyone's iPhone battery.

688
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,070
Speaker 0: They fucked up everyone's iPhone battery.

689
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:41,910
Speaker 0: There should be an everything federal court district for when there are lawsuits involving Big things that aren't actually G don't matter geographically, right?

690
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,876
Speaker 1: It's the sideshow Bob conundrum.

691
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:47,890
Speaker 0: the old episode is a federal crime in Eastern, Texas.

692
00:49:48,473 --> 00:49:51,450
Speaker 0: Then it makes sense to go to the federal court in Eastern, Texas.

693
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:58,479
Speaker 0: But if someone commits a federal crime or some sort of you know isn't necessarily a crime But you know the reason to sue them.

694
00:49:59,264 --> 00:50:01,173
Speaker 0: under a federal statute I guess whatever.

695
00:50:01,193 --> 00:50:04,785
Speaker 0: it is not a lawyer that doesn't have any geography related to it.

696
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:06,230
Speaker 0: Why should you have to pick a geography?

697
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:13,250
Speaker 1: It comes down to where the crime occurred and the question of where the crime occurred is really complicated in the modern world.

698
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,962
Speaker 0: I want to make some sort of central federal thing.

699
00:50:15,982 --> 00:50:17,790
Speaker 0: then the rule should be all right.

700
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,716
Speaker 0: You're a nationwide international company.

701
00:50:19,756 --> 00:50:23,127
Speaker 0: the lawsuit involving you someone's suing you on for on federal.

702
00:50:23,448 --> 00:50:24,130
Speaker 0: You know matters.

703
