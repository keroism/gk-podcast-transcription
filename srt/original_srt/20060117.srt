1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,217
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday January 17th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:24,538
Speaker 0: tonight We nominally talk about Mario and Luigi partners in time and Ultima quest of the avatar But we also spend more time than you think arguing about the latest Supreme Court decision in Gonzalez vs.

3
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:24,920
Speaker 0: Oregon.

4
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:26,858
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:32,400
Speaker 1: So you might have noticed today that I screwed up the forums a little bit and there might have been some downtime or whatever.

6
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:34,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone lost their avatars.

7
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:37,349
Speaker 1: Well, only people who uploaded avatars lost them.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,300
Speaker 1: people who had their avatars on another website did not lose them.

9
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,900
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone has their avatar on another site.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,449
Speaker 1: I think one person did actually but that it does.

11
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:46,071
Speaker 1: that's not the point.

12
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:51,948
Speaker 1: The point is there was a Potential security threat to the forum.

13
00:00:52,109 --> 00:01:00,736
Speaker 1: So I attempted to upgrade it to a newer version and in the process I accidentally overwrote the images directory which had all the little icons in it.

14
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:06,684
Speaker 1: Yeah So, oops, my bad Nothing else is hurt.

15
00:01:06,744 --> 00:01:11,018
Speaker 1: Just go re-upload your avatars and everything will be back to normal.

16
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,980
Speaker 0: Yep I mean we did it for your own good because basically we built another site on the same host for another group out there.

17
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:36,192
Speaker 0: we talked about a little bit and we put the same kind of blog and forum over there and I was logged into that forum Testing it and then I go log into the geek nights forum and I discover that I am in fact logged into the geek nights forum as Someone else one of our fine listeners.

18
00:01:36,654 --> 00:01:40,670
Speaker 1: Yes the whale shark Yeah, so there was basically a sort of.

19
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:48,600
Speaker 1: they usually call it a cross site scripting attack But it's not really cross site because it was the same site with the same piece of software running two times.

20
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:52,160
Speaker 0: It was like a cross hash cookie PHP session exploit.

21
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,986
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was But it wasn't the guy.

22
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:58,280
Speaker 1: I wrote to the people who make the forum and they said it was really a configuration error.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,990
Speaker 1: That isn't an issue anymore with the newer newer newer version that we're not gonna use yet because it's still beta But we'll use that version when it's no longer beta.

24
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:08,039
Speaker 1: The point is is that it's solved now.

25
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,492
Speaker 0: I mean basically all I could have done is someone could have logged in as you but no one knew about it and we fixed It before anyone found out.

26
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:17,535
Speaker 1: Yep So it's all good.

27
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:25,099
Speaker 1: Re-upload your avatars and if you're not in the forum go there because I put a secret there.

28
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,429
Speaker 0: You didn't put shit.

29
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:28,800
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

30
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, really now this secrets there.

31
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,151
Speaker 0: what secrets?

32
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:36,160
Speaker 0: I was just there a second ago secrets to make people go there.

33
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it means you're gonna add a secret after the show while I'm doing post-production.

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,832
Speaker 1: No, I already added a secret, but I'll add it something more obvious later.

35
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:43,314
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

36
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:52,333
Speaker 0: So anyway, we actually have a lot a bit of a non geek news But it's a topic that we're real riled up about.

37
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:58,120
Speaker 0: so we figured we'd talk about it Since people seem to like here in our opinions and or us yelling at each other yelling.

38
00:02:59,102 --> 00:03:03,744
Speaker 0: But as you're all probably aware the Supreme Court ruled today in Gonzalez vs.

39
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:25,198
Speaker 0: Oregon that and this is the majority opinion that the DEA and the Attorney General's ban of assisted suicide a Federal mandate Violated the Constitution in the sense that it overrode an Oregon state law saying that assisted suicide is okay and the doctors can do it if they follow a procedure and the patient wants them to.

40
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:28,660
Speaker 1: In other words, it was a vote in favor of states rights.

41
00:03:28,921 --> 00:03:41,075
Speaker 0: yes in favor of states rights in favor of a right to die in favor of limiting the power of the executive branch and It was just really a really interesting ruling and I guess we'll try to explain why.

42
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:51,599
Speaker 1: for those of you who aren't big SCOTUS followers, yeah, so what's really cool about this is That it was six to three, I think right?

43
00:03:51,828 --> 00:04:00,840
Speaker 0: Yep So even if someone like when O'Connor steps down and Scalito probably gets in It wouldn't have changed the result because he's almost definitely gonna dissent on this opinion.

44
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:04,454
Speaker 1: The next thing that it's important to note is the three people who voted against.

45
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,260
Speaker 1: it were Roberts Scalia and Thomas Thomas.

46
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,848
Speaker 0: Now those three claim to be conservative.

47
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,253
Speaker 1: they say they're conservatives yet.

48
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:13,880
Speaker 1: They voted against states rights.

49
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,891
Speaker 1: Now if that's not the opposite of conservative, I don't know what is.

50
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:19,320
Speaker 0: I mean basically a little background on this case.

51
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:29,273
Speaker 0: I think it was in 1996 or 97 that Oregon passed a law saying that if someone's terminally ill and Doctors verify that there is no way to help them.

52
00:04:29,676 --> 00:04:30,420
Speaker 0: They're in pain.

53
00:04:30,681 --> 00:04:33,994
Speaker 1: I think they had to be like going definitely going to die within six months.

54
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

55
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,540
Speaker 0: Yeah Like a doctor has to say this person will be dead within six months.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,100
Speaker 0: They're in pain blah blah blah and a psychologist to evaluate the person and all these rules to make sure that this isn't abused.

57
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:48,520
Speaker 0: Then a person can go through all this and request a doctor to painlessly end their life.

58
00:04:49,044 --> 00:04:51,020
Speaker 0: It was called the dying with dignity act.

59
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:52,224
Speaker 1: Actually, it's even.

60
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,548
Speaker 1: it's even less than that.

61
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,173
Speaker 1: The doctor doesn't even end your life.

62
00:04:55,233 --> 00:05:05,420
Speaker 1: The doctor will prescribe to you pain-killing medication and You have to go get that prescription filled and then take enough of it to kill yourself.

63
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:11,839
Speaker 0: In fact, if you're too weak, if you're too weak to do it, they'll set up a device that'll do it But you have to make the final call and push the button.

64
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:15,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like the doctor doesn't even do it.

65
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:22,347
Speaker 1: The doctor just sort of it's like someone saying alright You're not allowed to buy a gun.

66
00:05:22,427 --> 00:05:28,036
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna write a piece of paper that says you're allowed to buy a gun and You can shoot yourself with it if you want to.

67
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:36,647
Speaker 0: I know what it was called the dying with dignity act and regardless of your feelings on right to die or suicide Even though we're very opinionated about it.

68
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,340
Speaker 0: The fact remains that this was voted into law by the majority of voters.

69
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,399
Speaker 0: I believe it was a referendum in Oregon and most people in the state agreed with it.

70
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:56,631
Speaker 0: so doctors started doing this and Back then a bunch of Republican senators like Orrin Hatch that bastard Got together and decided that they didn't like this.

71
00:05:57,053 --> 00:05:59,280
Speaker 0: they didn't like the fact that people could kill themselves legally.

72
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,378
Speaker 1: Why don't you mind your own business and then to do with you?

73
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:09,163
Speaker 0: So they went over to Janet Reno and told her to intervene and Janet Reno gave him the finger and said that's the stupidest thing Ever.

74
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:10,254
Speaker 0: it'd be unconstitutional.

75
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:14,447
Speaker 0: Leave me alone Mm-hmm, so Nothing could happen.

76
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:15,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's forward.

77
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:24,633
Speaker 1: and a side note I want to point out that pretty much almost everything in Oregon is a referendum Which means the people actually vote on all their lot most of their laws.

78
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a really cool place.

79
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:28,380
Speaker 0: I didn't really know much about it until recently.

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,302
Speaker 1: Yeah, like an election day they get like these huge books full of stuff and they have to go through and fill out all this Crap, like yes.

81
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,165
Speaker 1: No, maybe yes.

82
00:06:35,225 --> 00:06:40,937
Speaker 1: No, maybe it's really cool there as opposed to other places where your state government does Whatever you don't know.

83
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:44,780
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a mixed bag because sometimes people don't really know what's best.

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:52,560
Speaker 1: But at least the people of Oregon know exactly what they're getting into Mm-hmm, and this is something that they definitely voted for in a vast majority.

85
00:06:53,464 --> 00:07:01,479
Speaker 0: so fast forward to recently Bush is now president and Gonzalez slash Ashcroft our attorneys general and such.

86
00:07:02,646 --> 00:07:13,940
Speaker 0: now There's a clause in the the controlled substances act Which is that it's basically the thing that they use that and the commerce clause to make drugs illegal federally.

87
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,007
Speaker 0: So things like marijuana and all that

88
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:16,689
Speaker 1: cocaine

89
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:31,780
Speaker 0: and the drugs that were used by doctors To administer this death to people who requested it were scheduled to drugs Meaning that they're illegal unless prescribed by a doctor and the legal way to prescribe them is to go through the CSA.

90
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:39,560
Speaker 0: Now Ashcroft said oh well considering that the CSA says all these blah blah blah.

91
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:55,600
Speaker 0: If you actually give people these drugs to kill themselves killing themselves is not a valid use of that drug and therefore what that doctor is doing is illegal and Irrespective of state laws making it legal It is now a federal crime to do so and they started trying to get all the doctors in Oregon thrown in jail.

92
00:07:56,283 --> 00:08:00,140
Speaker 1: Alright, so the the exact phrase in question was legitimate medical purpose.

93
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:05,279
Speaker 1: So they were saying that because suicide was about as far as you can get from.

94
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,424
Speaker 1: well Let me quote the guy.

95
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:12,820
Speaker 1: if the term legitimate medical purposes is any meaning It surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death.

96
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:19,067
Speaker 0: Now this coming from a supposedly conservative Supreme Court justice Who did or I?

97
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:20,794
Speaker 0: was that Ashcroft or wasn't one of the justices?

98
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,898
Speaker 0: was that the dissenting opinion?

99
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:22,380
Speaker 1: I think it.

100
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:23,863
Speaker 1: Scalia said that.

101
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:26,393
Speaker 0: oh now Scalia is very conservative.

102
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:27,758
Speaker 0: He says very pro states rights.

103
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,437
Speaker 0: yet Now he's saying that because he's arbitrarily against something states don't have the right to do it.

104
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,886
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, I'm not too fond of that.

105
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, man, those lefties.

106
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,577
Speaker 1: Those are the activist judges.

107
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:52,873
Speaker 1: Let me tell you Yeah, all right, so basically their argument if we're voting against it was that because Killing someone or killing yourself is not a legitimate medical purpose that you couldn't prescribe the illegal drugs for.

108
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:56,920
Speaker 1: you know this Something that's not a legitimate medical purpose.

109
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,605
Speaker 1: So what this really?

110
00:08:58,645 --> 00:08:59,267
Speaker 1: the decision?

111
00:08:59,347 --> 00:09:03,360
Speaker 1: since we voted, you know, the those guys lost and the good guys won.

112
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,256
Speaker 1: Was that now?

113
00:09:06,502 --> 00:09:11,779
Speaker 1: The definition of legitimate medical purpose is expanded to things like killing yourself.

114
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,671
Speaker 1: We now could include, you know drugs that they don't want.

115
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:23,379
Speaker 0: see it's actually this ruling is very complicated And I could do a whole podcast on just the majority opinion here.

116
00:09:23,983 --> 00:09:29,178
Speaker 0: But to try to sum up as briefly as I can Basically, what what they ruled is that?

117
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:33,751
Speaker 0: One the state's obvious if you read the CSA.

118
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:49,220
Speaker 0: that is intended to prevent illicit drug use specifically abusable drugs for in and to and To eliminate the abuse of these drugs to better society as in getting rid of heroin addicts and crackheads.

119
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,571
Speaker 0: And in addition to that They also decided that one states rights.

120
00:09:54,711 --> 00:10:00,735
Speaker 0: the state has the right to do this and the Attorney General Does not actually write the CSA he merely administers it.

121
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,700
Speaker 0: he parrots it.

122
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,364
Speaker 0: They even use the word parroting.

123
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:08,417
Speaker 0: the phrase parroting an anti parrot cannon appear fairly often around all these decisions here.

124
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:20,319
Speaker 0: if an anti parrot cannon existed But basically because it's not he didn't write it and he didn't use it He's just prescribing it the Attorney General has no right to interpret it.

125
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:32,599
Speaker 0: it is the court's job to interpret it and the only way to possibly use this as a means of Preventing people from killing themselves is to interpret it as to say that it does not include killing oneself.

126
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:46,159
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, so and they make like five or six other points and they actually call Ashcroft out directly Basically making fun of him for making a decision on a subject that he knows almost nothing about and has no credentials in.

127
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,860
Speaker 0: Well, they they really ride him in this decision.

128
00:10:50,562 --> 00:11:05,920
Speaker 1: You know, I can see like if the Surgeon General did something like this then it would be like, alright, okay You know, we actually have a real thing going on here But the Attorney General a lawyer getting involved in the doctor department.

129
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,170
Speaker 1: That makes a whole lot of sense.

130
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:13,732
Speaker 0: I mean, wow Yeah now there's also another really interesting possible.

131
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:16,603
Speaker 0: well to really ramifications of this is One.

132
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:34,075
Speaker 0: you may not realize it but Roe vs Wade might weigh very heavily into this decision because this decision among other things says that states Individually have the right to decide whether or not a medical practice is Allowable and that the federal government cannot do so.

133
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,829
Speaker 0: now It's possible that that would actually undermine Roe vs.

134
00:11:37,869 --> 00:11:41,100
Speaker 0: Wade which said that states cannot regulate the right to an abortion.

135
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:50,280
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, which not to get into that I disagree with Roe vs Wade in terms of the way it was decided, but I definitely agree with the right of a woman to have an abortion.

136
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:54,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see what they're saying is because remember it's about a legitimate medical purpose.

137
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:11,149
Speaker 1: So now what we can say is if killing yourself is a legitimate medical purpose by could a doctor for can prescribe medicine Then kill it, you know now we open the door is killing a baby is a legitimate medical purpose And the woman and you're allowed doctors allowed to do it.

138
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,926
Speaker 0: or by the same token that a state could make abortion illegal Despite Roe vs.

139
00:12:15,966 --> 00:12:17,957
Speaker 0: Wade and this would be precedent for it.

140
00:12:18,298 --> 00:12:19,527
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And it's we.

141
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,220
Speaker 0: there's really no way to say which way it would go.

142
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:28,660
Speaker 0: It's gonna depend a lot on if Scalito actually gets entered into the Supreme Court because basically he's going to vote on the side of the administration no matter what.

143
00:12:29,302 --> 00:12:30,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's pretty much that is.

144
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:33,918
Speaker 1: but even if he was there right now, it's still pretty cool that it'd be five and four.

145
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:34,939
Speaker 0: Yep.

146
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:52,347
Speaker 0: now the other possible unintended consequence of this is that it really kind of guts the CSA in its in the way that it can regulate the use of drugs because a couple of states have legalized medical marijuana recently and Every time they've done.

147
00:12:52,427 --> 00:13:01,855
Speaker 0: So the federal government has said up up up CSA commerce act commerce clause It's still against federal law, even though it doesn't cross state boundaries.

148
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:02,800
Speaker 0: We're gonna come in and arrest you.

149
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,389
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're gonna send federal marshals.

150
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:05,174
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

151
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:10,759
Speaker 0: So This basically says that the state has the right to regulate that and not the federal government.

152
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:12,343
Speaker 1: Yes, there's rights.

153
00:13:12,785 --> 00:13:18,520
Speaker 0: So there are only two things keeping a state from legalizing drugs right now the CSA and the Commerce Clause.

154
00:13:19,582 --> 00:13:22,000
Speaker 0: Now the CSA was gutted because of this decision.

155
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:26,859
Speaker 0: It really can't be used as justification for having federal laws that make substances illegal anymore.

156
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:39,629
Speaker 0: However, it does not get rid of the Commerce Clause, which Alright, well if I wrap this up because you don't want a commerce clause is the line in the Constitution That says Congress is allowed to make laws like the CSA.

157
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:45,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Congress can make another law anytime they feel like and There's not much you can do about it.

158
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:57,867
Speaker 0: What the Commerce Clause does is it says that the federal government can regulate interstate commerce Not intra only commerce between two states or between a state and a foreign power or between the federal government and a foreign power But whatever.

159
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:17,886
Speaker 0: now The thing is the Commerce Clause is very broad and for the last pretty much since the Civil War They've used the Commerce Clause to regulate internal state matters And the rationale is that even though it's entirely within a state it can affect other states Which in my opinion is horseshit.

160
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:22,319
Speaker 1: It is I agree that it's horseshit, but there's really not much you can do about it.

161
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,132
Speaker 1: now It's sort of like well, they decided Roe vs.

162
00:14:25,152 --> 00:14:25,313
Speaker 1: Wade.

163
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,398
Speaker 1: There's not much you can do about it.

164
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:32,044
Speaker 1: now They decided the Commerce Clause for hundreds of years to pretty much be anything.

165
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:42,579
Speaker 1: the federal government completely controls anything even close to commerce and Congress can make any law at once Pertaining to anything even close to commerce and there's not much you can do about it.

166
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:50,200
Speaker 0: See this all goes back to the Civil War Because I mean a lot of people down south and a lot of historians don't call it the Civil War.

167
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,840
Speaker 0: They call it the war of northern aggression.

168
00:14:52,781 --> 00:14:54,067
Speaker 0: Now I used to make fun of that a lot.

169
00:14:54,167 --> 00:15:00,419
Speaker 0: Ah the war northern aggression, but Imagine if slavery hadn't been an issue in the Civil War.

170
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:19,693
Speaker 0: Then if you look at it It's a bunch of states who have decided that they don't like the federal government and that they want to rule themselves Breaking away and the federal government sending troops in and killing countless people And having a huge war and raising cities to the ground in order to force them to remain a part of a union that they'd Have not want nothing to do with

171
00:15:20,523 --> 00:15:26,975
Speaker 1: Yep, but then you think about it You throw the slavery in there and all of a sudden it becomes a bunch of slave drivers.

172
00:15:27,035 --> 00:15:38,313
Speaker 0: and then this heroic country going to say hey if you want to keep you know, I hate it when an ideology or We're basically when an ideology gets clouded by an issue.

173
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,783
Speaker 0: I'm with the south Ideologically.

174
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:45,820
Speaker 0: the problem is they use that ideology to do to make an issue of something stupid.

175
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:48,314
Speaker 0: They wanted slaves, which is not cool.

176
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,480
Speaker 1: Yeah But at the same time they could have wanted something good.

177
00:15:52,541 --> 00:16:00,911
Speaker 1: It could have been like hey We want our state's rights so that we can have video games because there's a federal law outlawing video games You know and that's a good thing.

178
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:04,647
Speaker 1: states rights are good Because it was associated with slavery.

179
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:07,296
Speaker 1: people think it's bad, but there's nothing wrong with it.

180
00:16:07,577 --> 00:16:07,978
Speaker 1: It's great.

181
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,746
Speaker 0: Yeah There's only something wrong with slavery.

182
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,754
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm a lot wrong with slavery.

183
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:12,236
Speaker 0: Yeah.

184
00:16:12,497 --> 00:16:16,560
Speaker 0: Yeah But that's enough constitutional talk.

185
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:27,180
Speaker 0: I'll try to a whole show on it sometime because we talk about geekery a lot But we're very politically motivated and we're very loud about it and we could probably do an entire separate four day a week.

186
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,484
Speaker 0: Just on politics.

187
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:30,570
Speaker 1: there there are different kinds of geeks.

188
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,914
Speaker 1: they're political geeks out there.

189
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:32,676
Speaker 0: that works.

190
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:35,249
Speaker 0: if we ever run out of technology Let's just turn Mondays into.

191
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:36,840
Speaker 1: I don't think we're gonna run into technology.

192
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:39,839
Speaker 0: Hey, maybe there's some sort of Luddite revolution.

193
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,480
Speaker 1: Then we'll definitely keep going on about technology to get rid of those Luddites.

194
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:52,700
Speaker 0: So we had one more news bit and we'll probably kind of gloss over it because we've gone a while already.

195
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,028
Speaker 1: Okay, so you might have read today.

196
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,818
Speaker 1: well you might know what I think about World of Warcraft.

197
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:02,878
Speaker 0: not so great Yeah, today's real-life comics pretty much described what I think about World of Warcraft.

198
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,635
Speaker 1: Yeah Yesterday's rest doesn't matter.

199
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,640
Speaker 1: Basically, what's been happening in World of Warcraft is there's lots of gold farmers.

200
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,411
Speaker 0: These are people who are basically hired.

201
00:17:12,672 --> 00:17:19,579
Speaker 0: or they do it to make money and they play the game Grinding Lee to make gold and then sell it on eBay or they sell it on other various websites.

202
00:17:20,222 --> 00:17:30,970
Speaker 1: Actually, there are various gold farmers and power levelers that were advertising in PC gamer and they would advertise in their monthly With like big expensive ads and PC gamer.

203
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,179
Speaker 1: the editors got together and they went to.

204
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:41,680
Speaker 1: you know The company that actually takes care of the ads because you know video game editors don't actually You know take care of the stuff on that level.

205
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,442
Speaker 1: They're below that.

206
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:47,337
Speaker 1: and they said you have to stop putting these ads for gold farmers and power levels in our magazine.

207
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:47,919
Speaker 1: and they did.

208
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:52,278
Speaker 1: They gave up all that money to say that's bad and we're gonna get rid of it.

209
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,660
Speaker 0: And there's been an unexpected consequence of all this in World of Warcraft.

210
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:10,998
Speaker 0: Now there is a huge amount of discrimination against anyone who doesn't speak English because what the the common Stereotype is that the gold farmers are Chinese people which is kind of true.

211
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,504
Speaker 1: Yeah The thing is.

212
00:18:12,584 --> 00:18:13,810
Speaker 1: is that sure?

213
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:15,940
Speaker 1: most of the gold farmers are Chinese?

214
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,489
Speaker 1: There's some non-chinese gold farmers, but most of them are.

215
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:19,251
Speaker 0: but you know what?

216
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,820
Speaker 0: most of the Chinese are not gold farmers.

217
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:22,980
Speaker 0: Yeah They're a pro.

218
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,060
Speaker 1: They're like a one and a half million people playing World of Warcraft in China and a very small percentage of them are gold farmers.

219
00:18:30,683 --> 00:18:31,526
Speaker 0: It's just like spam.

220
00:18:31,868 --> 00:18:34,700
Speaker 0: I mean most spam in the world comes out of Russia and China.

221
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,532
Speaker 1: The most email from Russia and China is not spam.

222
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:43,680
Speaker 1: Yep, because there's just so much email I'll draw a Venn diagram for you sometime.

223
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,687
Speaker 0: Understand what we should have some sort of like.

224
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:50,817
Speaker 0: live Oh Akaki to go with the podcast so we can have little diagrams and draw things.

225
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's not so.

226
00:18:54,662 --> 00:19:01,936
Speaker 1: Now there's a problem where what's happening is People start a group and they want people to join and they say hey before you can join our group.

227
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:02,498
Speaker 1: We don't know.

228
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,139
Speaker 1: you Type two or three sentences in perfect English, you know.

229
00:19:06,621 --> 00:19:15,819
Speaker 1: they ask them a couple questions and expect them to answer in English and if the grammar is broken or Anything like that then they say oh you're just a gold farmer go away now.

230
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:23,200
Speaker 0: This is the point at which I call shenanigans on this possibly apocryphal tale Because I don't think there's anyone in World of Warcraft who uses proper grammar.

231
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,530
Speaker 1: I can name a few people but I know those people well.

232
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,389
Speaker 0: actually Scott you had some trouble with grammar the other day didn't know How an adverb works?

233
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:31,579
Speaker 1: I know an adverb works.

234
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,160
Speaker 0: You didn't seem to realize that adverbs can also modify other other adverbs and in fact cannot also modify adjectives.

235
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,103
Speaker 1: Well, it's like a thing.

236
00:19:39,184 --> 00:19:43,000
Speaker 1: I know it's like I use adverbs correctly when I speak and when I write.

237
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,148
Speaker 1: I just you know don't know the The rules like.

238
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:52,700
Speaker 1: I guess I can quote you and yesterday It's like I can play D&D and I can roll a d20 and I can tell you if I hit or not.

239
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,685
Speaker 1: But I can't tell you.

240
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,880
Speaker 1: you know, there was like a base attack bonus and a deflection.

241
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,392
Speaker 1: God knows what other talk is in that book.

242
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:01,898
Speaker 0: So you are you are right.

243
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:04,110
Speaker 0: good Yeah, yeah.

244
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:08,424
Speaker 0: Yeah We Argue about grammar a lot.

245
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:10,570
Speaker 0: We don't really argue Scott just things.

246
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,097
Speaker 1: It's not really much to argue about grammar.

247
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:14,220
Speaker 1: This is right wrong?

248
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:16,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, you look it up and you say up.

249
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,715
Speaker 1: There's the right answer.

250
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:18,398
Speaker 1: That's yeah.

251
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:23,440
Speaker 0: No, there was the point when you denied the fact that sometimes is or somewhat was an adverb.

252
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:24,970
Speaker 1: But I didn't know it was an adverb.

253
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,118
Speaker 0: it didn't what you think it was.

254
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:27,324
Speaker 1: What do you think?

255
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,031
Speaker 1: it didn't seem very adverb like.

256
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:31,260
Speaker 1: but then I looked at dictionary and I was wrong.

257
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:31,965
Speaker 1: So what do you want?

258
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:34,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, what did you think it modified?

259
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:36,119
Speaker 0: Somewhat what?

260
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,586
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it could modify An adjective.

261
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,632
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

262
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:41,874
Speaker 0: Yep.

263
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:42,135
Speaker 0: Yep.

264
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,009
Speaker 1: Yep, hence Yeah, all right.

265
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:49,370
Speaker 1: It's not an ad adjective But I figure you know an adjective.

266
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,340
Speaker 1: I thought an adjective could modify an adjective.

267
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:00,937
Speaker 1: You ever do one of those.

268
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:02,500
Speaker 1: name that tune kind of thing.

269
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,635
Speaker 1: So they play a song and you got to say what it is and who sung it.

270
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:09,038
Speaker 0: name that beard name that beard.

271
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:10,484
Speaker 1: More like name that tune.

272
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:24,160
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's a PBS of all places put up a nice little flash game where 18 questions, I think Yeah, 18. and they play sound effects from old old old video games.

273
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,239
Speaker 1: we're talking Atari and Intellivision 2 an arcade old Atari era arcade machines.

274
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:47,420
Speaker 1: and Then they ask you which game it was and they'll usually give you three choices and then also give you like a cryptic sentence is a hint on some of them and I got a 15 out of 18, but that's because I didn't look at the hints and a couple of them threw me off.

275
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,826
Speaker 0: Yep, I didn't look at the hints either.

276
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:52,280
Speaker 0: I only got a 13 but two of them were bullshit.

277
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,609
Speaker 1: I gotta say which ones are bullshit.

278
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:58,540
Speaker 0: Oh the berserk one wasn't so much bullshit It was always and I got that one, right?

279
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,580
Speaker 0: He cuz I. I'm actually really really good at the Atari version, but I didn't know there was an arcade version of berserk.

280
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,708
Speaker 1: It's an arcade version of everything Mmm all the Atari game.

281
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:10,459
Speaker 0: I defy you to find an arcade version of snap fucking foo.

282
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,308
Speaker 1: Look, yeah, there might be.

283
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:15,458
Speaker 1: Mame has so many freaking roms man.

284
00:22:15,498 --> 00:22:15,820
Speaker 1: It's yeah.

285
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:26,928
Speaker 1: But anyway, if you want to test your old-school Atari knowledges head on over to my thing of the day and You'll see how you stand up.

286
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,720
Speaker 0: It's quite cool, dude.

287
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:34,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of them are real obvious and real awesome.

288
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:42,691
Speaker 0: So my thing this is in a foreign policy magazine, which I actually used to read Because I used to be able to like.

289
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:52,345
Speaker 0: the thing is in my high school We had the Lexis Nexus for free and we also had subscriptions to pretty much every magazine Ever RIT had.

290
00:22:52,385 --> 00:22:54,692
Speaker 1: that I didn't take advantage of until way later though.

291
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:55,173
Speaker 0: Yeah.

292
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:57,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the internet provided much much more.

293
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:58,405
Speaker 0: Yes, it did.

294
00:22:58,707 --> 00:23:06,799
Speaker 0: But I used to say just have time when I was bored in high school So I go to the library and just read like all these various magazines I was a big fan of the Atlantic Monthly - mm-hmm.

295
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:17,399
Speaker 0: But basically this is a nice online bit and they think they have more in the magazine, but it's a photo journal of Bangladeshi scrap workers.

296
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:21,797
Speaker 1: Bangladesh isn't that like one of the poorest countries that are?

297
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:26,160
Speaker 0: is yes Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries that has ever existed.

298
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:41,493
Speaker 1: I mean I remember a thing from a Bangladesh guy and this is back in the days when they actually talked about first world second world third world instead of developing and developed nations and The guy was like, yeah, Bangladesh is like the fourth world nation.

299
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:43,359
Speaker 1: It's so bad and so poor.

300
00:23:44,503 --> 00:23:54,338
Speaker 0: so Bangladesh also has what pretty much the largest beach in the world and it's also used as the largest docking or dry docking facility in the world.

301
00:23:54,358 --> 00:24:01,812
Speaker 0: and You know super tankers and by super tanker I mean the giant giant giant oil tankers that are.

302
00:24:02,113 --> 00:24:04,340
Speaker 0: they're the biggest things on the ocean.

303
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,599
Speaker 0: They're bigger than a super aircraft carriers and they carry oil around.

304
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:25,100
Speaker 0: They wear out pretty kit quick and when they get decommissioned more than half of them in the world end up in Bangladesh Where and I kid you not about 200,000 peasants with their bare hands tear them apart to scrap and that is the primary industry there.

305
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:28,439
Speaker 0: This accounts for almost all the steel that Bangladesh has.

306
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:30,805
Speaker 1: That's a lot of steel though.

307
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:33,614
Speaker 1: These pictures are and they get it for free.

308
00:24:34,357 --> 00:24:35,320
Speaker 0: They don't get it for free.

309
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,423
Speaker 0: You'd look at these pictures.

310
00:24:36,483 --> 00:24:39,571
Speaker 0: These people do something that I I mean money-wise.

311
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,860
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I couldn't imagine people actually doing this.

312
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:51,380
Speaker 0: I mean they show this super tanker and then they show it gone Because these people have just ripped every piece of steel off of it and carried it away on their backs.

313
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:55,945
Speaker 0: Wow these pictures are Worth looking at.

314
00:24:56,487 --> 00:25:02,013
Speaker 1: I mean some of the things I can understand like oh, they took the fire extinguisher They took you know, the stair railing.

315
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:04,886
Speaker 1: they took the chairs You know that that kind of stuff.

316
00:25:04,967 --> 00:25:05,469
Speaker 1: the doors.

317
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:15,620
Speaker 1: you can take the hinges off and take the door but like Eventually you get to pieces that are just big heavy pieces of metal bolted together and welded together.

318
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:21,488
Speaker 1: You can't really take them especially not without Extremely powerful tools yet.

319
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:25,059
Speaker 0: This supplies 80% of Bangladesh's steel this industry.

320
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,060
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, these are some very sad looking people.

321
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:34,454
Speaker 1: I'd be pretty sad if I was hanging out in a tank.

322
00:25:34,474 --> 00:25:44,000
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess the only Glimmer I can see in this is that if nothing else it proves the tenacity of mankind to survive no matter what.

323
00:25:45,822 --> 00:25:49,820
Speaker 0: Mmm, look at what these people do to survive and people here think they got it bad.

324
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,067
Speaker 1: It's like the power goes out.

325
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:53,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, or their blog gets spammed.

326
00:25:57,162 --> 00:26:00,013
Speaker 0: So today's video game day and since we've gone long that's fine.

327
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,880
Speaker 0: We have one and a half games to talk about.

328
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,364
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally awesome.

329
00:26:03,685 --> 00:26:19,112
Speaker 0: So we're gonna talk today about Mario Luigi partners in time which Scott just beat and Then I'm gonna rant about Ultima for until he stops me I thought it was - no no no - is God We'll talk about.

330
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,317
Speaker 0: don't even get me into Ultima.

331
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,926
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm gonna get into Ultima, but not just yet.

332
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,957
Speaker 1: So Mario Luigi partners in time.

333
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:35,610
Speaker 1: I just beat it on the train today and I Like the Superstar Saga a little bit better than the partners in time.

334
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,739
Speaker 1: But the partners in time was worth playing.

335
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:47,417
Speaker 1: if I would have known that it wasn't as good as Superstar Saga I might have wanted to pay like five dollars less, but whatever It was still pretty hilarious.

336
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,155
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of funny jokes here and there and The you can all.

337
00:26:52,296 --> 00:27:00,470
Speaker 1: the one thing I didn't like about it was that you never really They had a future world in a past world and I thought that would be the cool mechanic that you know.

338
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,919
Speaker 1: Like Metroid Prime 2 has.

339
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,126
Speaker 1: we're like, oh you're in the future.

340
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:07,690
Speaker 1: in the past You know the puzzles crossover like that, but not really.

341
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:16,016
Speaker 1: It's just the past is where all the game is and the future is just the happy princess castle town where you do You know normal town stuff.

342
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:17,000
Speaker 1: That was it.

343
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:27,953
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, you know and Superstar Saga the old the Gameboy one had more of like this exploring type of thing where you'd go different places and Try to find stuff.

344
00:27:28,655 --> 00:27:30,722
Speaker 1: This one was like very linear.

345
00:27:31,344 --> 00:27:36,830
Speaker 1: You can always turn around like When a level was real big like a third of the way through it.

346
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,148
Speaker 1: They would give you like a little pipe to get back to the beginning in case you wanted to go back to the.

347
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:46,210
Speaker 1: you know The town castle to freshen up, you know get some more mushrooms and whatever.

348
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:49,602
Speaker 1: But other than that, it was like a straight through game.

349
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:51,350
Speaker 0: I don't know if I like that.

350
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,081
Speaker 0: I'm getting kind of tired of that kind of linear gameplay.

351
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:59,950
Speaker 1: Yeah one thing though at the end I don't want to give away the end, but I will say that there were three bosses.

352
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:01,962
Speaker 1: There was a square boss and a cube boss.

353
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:05,038
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah and there were this.

354
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:10,719
Speaker 1: there was a flurry of save spots at the end and Once I figured out what they were doing with these save spots.

355
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:12,245
Speaker 1: I actually thought it was pretty nice.

356
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:13,028
Speaker 1: It was.

357
00:28:14,252 --> 00:28:24,085
Speaker 1: you know, you know, there are always things that happen in games over and over again and everyone's annoyed by them and No one ever seems to correct them no matter how many years they annoy us for.

358
00:28:24,346 --> 00:28:31,020
Speaker 1: and in this game They corrected one of those things right before The the point of no return.

359
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,663
Speaker 1: right.

360
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:32,950
Speaker 1: there was a normal save spot.

361
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:48,623
Speaker 1: then Like I was about to go in this door and there's this little suitcase character who is part of the plot But whatever and you're always carrying him around with you and he comes out and he says This is the point at which you will not be able to turn back.

362
00:28:48,964 --> 00:28:50,209
Speaker 1: You know, the bosses are ahead.

363
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:54,184
Speaker 1: Sit, you know you better save and then he forces you to save.

364
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:55,690
Speaker 1: he like blocks the paths.

365
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:05,249
Speaker 0: Wow Final Fantasy 4 could have freaking use that because I'm at the end on the GBA version and For all of you remember the end of that game.

366
00:29:05,632 --> 00:29:20,973
Speaker 0: Basically, there's a final save spot and then if you want to go fight You know Zemus and all the crazy stuff at the end You have to walk for like two or three minutes and then you have to go through a couple minutes of plot and dialogue And all this crap before you can fight him and then you die in two seconds You have to do it again.

367
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:24,229
Speaker 0: You have to go through so much to fight him every time you lose.

368
00:29:25,331 --> 00:29:29,969
Speaker 1: Then I go through and there is yet another save spot and I save.

369
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:38,750
Speaker 1: and you know And I fight the first boss and then after the first boss I hit the save spot and he says Do you want to go back before you save the princess?

370
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,699
Speaker 1: You know, I guess I kind of get beat that come on.

371
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,224
Speaker 1: Everyone saves a princess in Mario.

372
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:44,730
Speaker 0: Now the princess dies.

373
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, the princess totally dies.

374
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:48,249
Speaker 1: He says do you want to go back?

375
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:58,383
Speaker 1: So when you whenever you hit this save spot You can actually use it to teleport back and fight that boss again and go back into the game Where the boss is unbeaten.

376
00:29:58,786 --> 00:29:59,049
Speaker 1: All right.

377
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:11,560
Speaker 1: so you can do that or you can just save and continue and fight the next boss and After that boss is yet another save spot Which will let you teleport back in time to before you beat the bosses.

378
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:21,030
Speaker 1: and then is if you know you go and there's this The third boss and there's yet another save spot that will let you teleport back or save.

379
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:25,310
Speaker 1: So it's like I have the game saved at the end of the game after I've beaten the whole thing.

380
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,695
Speaker 1: There's nothing left to beat at all.

381
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:30,670
Speaker 1: But if I go and hit that save spot I can go back into the game.

382
00:30:31,652 --> 00:30:35,553
Speaker 1: You know before I beat the final bosses, that's kind of cool It's really.

383
00:30:35,714 --> 00:30:38,222
Speaker 1: it was very handy once I realized what the hell they were doing.

384
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:45,329
Speaker 0: It's like oh you've made the end less painful Thank you, yep now it's fun to just go back and fiddle with things when you're bored a year from now.

385
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:47,924
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not much to fiddle with though.

386
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:58,264
Speaker 1: Honestly in this game I mean I pretty much cleaned out every single area for every secret I needed and Like I leveled up all the characters like level 31 and I didn't ever actually level up.

387
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:11,270
Speaker 1: I just went through the game straight and Because they pretty much mastered the use of all of the bros items You know and you only don't really need to use all the bros items like the chomp ones.

388
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,284
Speaker 1: I never used some of the items.

389
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:17,990
Speaker 1: they were just Harder to use than like the red shells and they didn't do as much damage.

390
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:19,967
Speaker 1: so I never had a reason to use them.

391
00:31:19,987 --> 00:31:28,410
Speaker 1: and I still beat the living crap out of the final bosses doing like a zillion damage because I've Bothered to collect enough beans and get good badges.

392
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:34,549
Speaker 1: and collecting beans was a lot more fun than some of the other tasks being animals.

393
00:31:35,571 --> 00:31:37,938
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bean collecting was actually more advanced.

394
00:31:37,998 --> 00:31:48,100
Speaker 1: in the gameboy one, you know, it feels like they kind of like Like it's a good game because Mario and Luigi Mario RPG type game.

395
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:53,720
Speaker 1: But this one feels a little more like like they hurried up to get it out, you know.

396
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:56,779
Speaker 1: And they didn't you know make the fullness what they could have.

397
00:31:57,201 --> 00:32:04,063
Speaker 1: They just said oh we'll use a B X and Y and the DS and you know, we'll be all good You know.

398
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:11,353
Speaker 1: whereas with the Superstar Saga and thousand-year door paper Mario They really made like paper door the paper Mario.

399
00:32:11,394 --> 00:32:11,856
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

400
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:12,880
Speaker 1: That's like the amazing.

401
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:21,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I I'm real liria games like this in general, but paper Mario is calling to me And if I ever have free time, I'm just gonna sit down and beat that game like bang.

402
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:38,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, so For partners in time if You're like a huge fan of the you know the Mario and you like paper Mario's and Mario RPGs You should get it cuz it's not the greatest of those but it's still great enough to warrant playing.

403
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:44,240
Speaker 1: But if you're if that's not your thing, then this is not the one to play.

404
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,627
Speaker 1: you're better off playing the gameboy one or Paper Mario on the GameCube.

405
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:51,640
Speaker 0: paper Mario on the GameCube looks just fantastic.

406
00:32:52,243 --> 00:32:54,774
Speaker 1: It's totally and it's much bigger and more interesting.

407
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:56,059
Speaker 0: and there's a goomba girl.

408
00:32:56,823 --> 00:32:58,731
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what it is about this goomba girl.

409
00:32:58,751 --> 00:32:59,655
Speaker 0: It's cute.

410
00:33:00,057 --> 00:33:00,599
Speaker 1: She's real cute.

411
00:33:03,202 --> 00:33:07,300
Speaker 0: So this podcast kind of went long as they tend to do when we're real opinionated.

412
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:10,010
Speaker 0: But a real quick and nice aside.

413
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:12,580
Speaker 0: Ultima for the quest of the Avatar.

414
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:22,780
Speaker 0: Now this was an NES game and I just have a question to the world as anyone actually played All these Ultima games and are any of them actually playable?

415
00:33:23,821 --> 00:33:33,419
Speaker 0: They're all just these terrible monstrosities and I could never play any of them for more than about 10 seconds without just getting pissed off And stopping I just tried to play what three of them?

416
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:40,478
Speaker 1: Yeah on the NES downstairs all the computer ROM NES emulator downstairs and all three of them.

417
00:33:40,879 --> 00:33:44,739
Speaker 1: well Some of them seemed like they had interesting components to them.

418
00:33:46,044 --> 00:33:56,956
Speaker 1: All three of them were just completely unplayable terrible games that I just ah It is painful to even try to do anything like talking to people was hard.

419
00:33:56,976 --> 00:34:11,391
Speaker 0: I Mean, there's one Ultima game that I've ever played that didn't suck as much And that was Ultima for the Avatar because it looks it's the only one that looks like a real NES game like it works like a console game, of course, it came out for the PC too.

420
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:17,286
Speaker 0: And if you play that version well I'm sorry It's a completely different game.

421
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:18,271
Speaker 0: play the NES version.

422
00:34:18,311 --> 00:34:20,478
Speaker 0: It's probably the best Ultima game ever created.

423
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,996
Speaker 1: You know, I have a feeling though that like Ultima on the PC was something different.

424
00:34:26,117 --> 00:34:28,771
Speaker 0: cuz in now I played several of them on the PC.

425
00:34:28,811 --> 00:34:29,877
Speaker 0: They're terrible game.

426
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:30,400
Speaker 0: Really?

427
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz whenever I hear people talk about Ultima in a good light, they seem to always be talking about PC games.

428
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,085
Speaker 1: I never you know when they're talking about.

429
00:34:38,507 --> 00:34:39,330
Speaker 0: well, they all.

430
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,755
Speaker 1: any s is like something else.

431
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:45,226
Speaker 0: They all came out on the PC Mm-hmm and Ultima zero.

432
00:34:45,286 --> 00:34:52,565
Speaker 0: the first one is just this piss-poor like semi 3d dungeon crawl thing and There was no plot at all.

433
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:52,946
Speaker 0: Really.

434
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:55,254
Speaker 1: Is that one of those ones of the first-person perspective?

435
00:34:55,495 --> 00:35:00,330
Speaker 1: kind of any drag items Like into like the arm slot the chest slot.

436
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,594
Speaker 0: It's not that sophisticated.

437
00:35:01,714 --> 00:35:05,271
Speaker 1: Oh, I like those what that's like dungeon master That those are great or dungeon hack.

438
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:05,874
Speaker 0: I used to play.

439
00:35:05,894 --> 00:35:12,080
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But basically all the Ultima's were on the PC and they were all just these plotting.

440
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,120
Speaker 0: Terrible arbitrarily difficult games like some Nintendo games are arbitrary.

441
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,759
Speaker 0: You know pick the right warp area throw the holy water on the right brick.

442
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:33,439
Speaker 0: But just to give you a sample because Ultima 4 in my opinion is the best of these games and it's actually a really good game except for the fact that part of the plot is that you have to find like these seven runes and these seven stones all these different items.

443
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:36,517
Speaker 0: and Here's an example of the locations of these items.

444
00:35:37,183 --> 00:35:55,260
Speaker 0: one of these runes is if you go to a certain town called pause which is south of another town and you go into the town and you walk over to where the stables are and Then you walk like two spaces to the left and three spaces up and then you hit a and search You'll find this critical plot item that you need to win the game.

445
00:35:56,681 --> 00:36:02,139
Speaker 1: Is there like a character in the game who says hey look search the stable to find the item or anything like that?

446
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,420
Speaker 0: Barely, you'll find a guy on the other side of the world completely unrelated who will say like there's something special in that town.

447
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:15,099
Speaker 0: There's someone else in another side of the world who would say something like something something stables.

448
00:36:16,601 --> 00:36:17,666
Speaker 0: That's probably the easiest.

449
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:20,157
Speaker 1: is there any sort of connection between them at all?

450
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:22,067
Speaker 0: God Let me put it this way.

451
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:23,817
Speaker 0: That's probably the easiest one to find.

452
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:26,131
Speaker 0: great I mean like that.

453
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,539
Speaker 0: you can has magic in the game, right?

454
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:33,800
Speaker 0: But not only do you have magic points, but you have spell components like ten different kinds of spell components.

455
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,465
Speaker 0: Some are cheap some are expensive.

456
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:37,812
Speaker 0: You've only some cities have them for sale.

457
00:36:37,832 --> 00:36:39,156
Speaker 0: They only have certain ones for sale.

458
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:53,010
Speaker 0: and To learn a new spell you have to learn which components to use as in literally you have to remember based on people you talk to that it's Mandrake ash and Something else to cast this spell.

459
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:57,591
Speaker 1: in order to know how to cast the spell I would just write them all down in a piece of paper.

460
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to use a piece of paper.

461
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,069
Speaker 0: You can't win this game.

462
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:09,459
Speaker 0: You have to write down gobs of information and memorize things and memorize that certain colors go with certain virtues that go with certain symbols that go with certain stones.

463
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:11,509
Speaker 0: and It's just this.

464
00:37:12,115 --> 00:37:15,007
Speaker 0: I Hate this game so much yet.

465
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:18,778
Speaker 0: I played it constantly because I I was convinced that there was something to it.

466
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,926
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm of course now.

467
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:25,945
Speaker 0: I know better because I read game facts, and I found out that there's nothing to it Really nothing at all.

468
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:31,192
Speaker 0: now the game just kind of a and when you finally beat it It's just arbitrary and crap and the endings kind of blah.

469
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:35,914
Speaker 1: the ending is blah If usually games like that have a crazy exciting ending.

470
00:37:36,578 --> 00:37:38,820
Speaker 0: no in fact I won't link to it because I don't want to spoil it.

471
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,200
Speaker 0: But if you google around you'll find a site that has pictures of the entire end of the game.

472
00:37:43,743 --> 00:37:44,448
Speaker 0: It's just some text.

473
00:37:45,113 --> 00:37:46,200
Speaker 1: That's it basically.

474
00:37:47,501 --> 00:37:54,522
Speaker 0: Wow, I mean the ultimate games form this giant epic overarching plot and the continuity is Ridiculous.

475
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:59,620
Speaker 0: like you'll be a party who kills a guy this evil guy named mundane in a previous ultimate game.

476
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:04,020
Speaker 0: And then an ultimate for if you remember it because the world's always the same.

477
00:38:04,442 --> 00:38:10,270
Speaker 0: Where the skull of mundane is you can go get it, and it's as powerful artifact And in fact you have to get it to beat the game.

478
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,191
Speaker 1: Oh I get it.

479
00:38:13,434 --> 00:38:15,567
Speaker 1: yeah That's kind of cool.

480
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:16,332
Speaker 0: It'd be cool.

481
00:38:16,372 --> 00:38:17,620
Speaker 0: If the games didn't suck ass.

482
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess what I'm looking for.

483
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:22,280
Speaker 0: cuz I'm done ranting I could rant forever.

484
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:27,957
Speaker 0: Is there anyone out there listen to geek nights who actually played and liked any Ultima game ever?

Speaker 1: He could beat a few levels of that game.

494
00:38:54,116 --> 00:38:54,640
Speaker 1: It was scary.

495
00:38:56,362 --> 00:38:59,039
