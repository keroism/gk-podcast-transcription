1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,240
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, December 29th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,978
Speaker 1: Tonight we talk about Star Wars.

3
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:18,097
Speaker 1: Choo choo!

4
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:20,039
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:30,700
Speaker 1: Alright, so, uh, it's like New Year's, and after work today, the boss's boss took our whole section of the company out to eat at this fancy lounge and hotel.

6
00:00:31,043 --> 00:00:31,379
Speaker 0: Oh, great.

7
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:34,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty boring for a nerd like me.

8
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:39,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, considering you don't drink, and, uh, you don't have anything to say to these people?

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:57,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really didn't have anything to say at all, they just, like, the boss, the boss's boss's wife is like a yoga something or other, so they were talking about yoga, and I was just like snoring, whatever, I don't care, and then I left, you know, when it was train time.

10
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I had my Christmas office party not too long ago, and the only thing that made it bearable was that everyone else got drunk and then I could talk about nerdly things and they'd pretend they were interested or forget that they're not interested.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:28,157
Speaker 1: The one thing that was weird was that, you know, the boss's boss was, um, spending, like, he's got like a little tiny New Year's vacation, and he's spending it in that hotel, like, not, like, coming to the city for a vacation and just staying in the hotel, like, the vacation is in the hotel.

12
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:35,760
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird, because usually I go on a vacation to a place and the hotel is just a provider of beds and showers.

13
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,233
Speaker 1: Yeah.

14
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,920
Speaker 1: I don't go to the hotel, like, it's the place of the vacation.

15
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,860
Speaker 0: Unless it's a resort hotel, but then you're not going to a hotel, you're going to a resort.

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:53,580
Speaker 1: This wasn't a resort, but it was mad fancy, like, they have a giant freaking spa and giant freaking fancy stuff there, like, it was way fancier than any place I've been in.

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,219
Speaker 0: That's not so bad, but I guess if I ever was going to go on any sort of vacation like that, I wouldn't go to a hotel.

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,799
Speaker 0: For that much money, I could go wander around Europe for a few weeks or something cool.

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, totally.

20
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,780
Speaker 0: So anyway, in Argentina, they discovered a near-complete Titanosaurus fossil.

21
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:12,256
Speaker 1: Titanus.

22
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:14,060
Speaker 0: Well, Titanosaurus.

23
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,260
Speaker 1: Ah, like a titan.

24
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,257
Speaker 0: Apparently the remains were discovered while a German petroleum company was looking for oil.

25
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:30,460
Speaker 1: So now why is it that they, you know, the digging for oil is how you find dinosaurs as opposed to, you know, digging for dinosaurs?

26
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,460
Speaker 0: Because people don't really just dig for dinosaurs so often anymore.

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,699
Speaker 1: That sucks.

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:43,159
Speaker 1: Like, I remember in elementary and middle school, it was always like, there are paleontologists everywhere and they're finding dinosaurs left and right, oh my God, you want to be one?

29
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:50,900
Speaker 0: Well, no, I think the thing that got a lot of people to want to become paleontologists or archaeologists were Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones respectively.

30
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:52,740
Speaker 1: No, it was like way before that.

31
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,699
Speaker 1: It was like, what do you want to be when you grow up?

32
00:02:55,403 --> 00:02:55,740
Speaker 1: Astronaut?

33
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,620
Speaker 1: Paleontologist.

34
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,880
Speaker 0: I was just an astronaut the whole way.

35
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,480
Speaker 0: Or president.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,820
Speaker 1: Because it was always, the two coolest things were space and dinosaurs.

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,537
Speaker 1: And you know what?

38
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,739
Speaker 1: Space is still cool and dinosaurs is still cool.

39
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:14,579
Speaker 0: But do you really expect a lot of paleontology to come out of a country where people still believe that dinosaurs are not actually real and they were put there by God to trick us?

40
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:16,019
Speaker 1: No.

41
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:16,914
Speaker 0: Yeah.

42
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:28,618
Speaker 1: But the thing is, there are paleontologists and they don't really think about what country, you know, politics-wise, they just try to figure out where geographically in the world are where the bones are at.

43
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,840
Speaker 0: But remember, you got to find someone to pay for their trips and pay for their equipment.

44
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,940
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but you know, there's always, if you're the big time guy, you always get paid.

45
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:37,940
Speaker 1: You know?

46
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, but apparently a lot of museums, they're not really in the market for dinosaur bones so much anymore.

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,860
Speaker 1: That's because all the museums already have dinosaurs.

48
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,540
Speaker 1: It used to be that like, you know, you would go to like a specific museum.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,999
Speaker 1: Like I remember the Peabody Museum always had the great dinosaur skeletons and you would go there to see the dinosaur skeletons.

50
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,034
Speaker 1: Now every fucking museum's got a T-Rex and a Stegosaurus and whatnot.

51
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:04,600
Speaker 1: and it's like, you know, all the rest of the museums are like, "What do I need another one for?

52
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,974
Speaker 1: I already got more than I know what to do

53
00:04:06,014 --> 00:04:06,156
Speaker 1: with.".

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,700
Speaker 0: Well I saw a thing on FARC that museums just aren't doing so well in the last several years.

55
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:11,448
Speaker 1: Really?

56
00:04:12,124 --> 00:04:12,379
Speaker 1: Yeah.

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,499
Speaker 0: Attendance is down.

58
00:04:14,582 --> 00:04:20,059
Speaker 0: And there actually are a lot of groups, in America at least, boycotting museums that have anything related to evolution in them.

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,858
Speaker 1: Oh, well those people suck, but... Yeah.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,900
Speaker 0: Museums down south are having a lot of trouble.

61
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:39,120
Speaker 1: I notice a lot of museums are changing, like, it seems like there's less of the natural history type museums with exhibits of real type things and there's more like the science museums which is just a bunch of like gadgets and like toys to play with that are supposed to teach you something.

62
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:39,899
Speaker 0: Because that's the draw.

63
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Speaker 0: The kids don't learn anything.

64
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:44,500
Speaker 0: They want to go to a museum and there's stuff they can touch and play with and throw around.

65
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,499
Speaker 0: They don't want to stand there and read a wall of text.

66
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:49,940
Speaker 1: But the art museums are still doing okay.

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,356
Speaker 1: Yeah.

68
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,600
Speaker 0: It's mostly science that's having the trouble.

69
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:55,940
Speaker 0: Because science is very boring to a lot of people.

70
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,420
Speaker 0: Even though I don't see how that could be.

71
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,860
Speaker 0: I'm fascinated by it constantly.

72
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,613
Speaker 1: Well I gotta admit though, like the Natural History Museum, I've been to it like a thousand times and it...

73
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:07,098
Speaker 0: Well, unless they get a new exhibit, once you've looked at every exhibit...

74
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:08,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not much doing.

75
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,959
Speaker 1: And like any other Natural History Museum, when you've seen one, you've seen them all.

76
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:13,738
Speaker 1: You know?

77
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,719
Speaker 1: It's like there's not much more to see until maybe we'll discover some new trilobites or something and I'll have to go see them.

78
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:21,999
Speaker 0: Ah, trilobites.

79
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,220
Speaker 0: You know, I got some trilobite fossils.

80
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,518
Speaker 1: I'll go get my own trilobites.

81
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:27,779
Speaker 0: You want some of mine?

82
00:05:29,202 --> 00:05:30,880
Speaker 1: No, you can keep your trilobites to yourself.

83
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,340
Speaker 1: Alright.

84
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:32,999
Speaker 0: I'll keep my trilobites.

85
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:33,916
Speaker 1: You do that.

86
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,039
Speaker 1: Next to your Titanosaurus's.

87
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:42,100
Speaker 0: So, in Berlin, and uh, or was it Austria?

88
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,640
Speaker 0: No, it was reported from Berlin, but it's happening in Austria.

89
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,340
Speaker 0: There's a group of people, and these people are our heroes.

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Speaker 0: At least, minor heroes.

91
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,917
Speaker 0: They're called Quintessens.

92
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:52,811
Speaker 1: What?

93
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:53,777
Speaker 1: What?

94
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,690
Speaker 1: As in five...sens?

95
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,680
Speaker 0: Quintessens, with a "z" on the end, is the name of their group.

96
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:03,780
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so they're just like elite dudes and that's the name of their group.

97
00:06:04,025 --> 00:06:04,155
Speaker 1: Yeah.

98
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:04,779
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,500
Speaker 0: Every elite group gets a name, like the Yamikaze or the Front Row Crew.

100
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,139
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, I thought it was like a thing.

101
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:20,979
Speaker 1: Alright, well, apparently in Austria they have the same problems with the government spying on everyone with cameras that they do in Britain and other such countries of police stating.

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,019
Speaker 0: Yep, camera on every street corner, computers looking at faces, figuring out who's who.

103
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,360
Speaker 1: Well, it's not quite that.

104
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,319
Speaker 1: It's more that the government can set up stuff in any public area any time they want without announcing it or anything.

105
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:32,759
Speaker 1: Which is just as bad.

106
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:34,178
Speaker 1: If not worse.

107
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:38,660
Speaker 1: But some guys, uh, hack the system big time.

108
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,800
Speaker 1: And they set up all kinds of stuff, including jamming the signal, using balloons to block the cameras.

109
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,460
Speaker 0: I like how they made a similar system that puts black stripes over people's eyes so you can have a camera to watch for crime, but you can't use it to track people.

110
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,420
Speaker 1: Yep, that's pretty cool.

111
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,753
Speaker 1: You know what, in fact, if they made a system like that, I really wouldn't mind them using it.

112
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, because if someone mugs me, I'd love to have a video to go get them.

113
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:05,818
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's not so much that.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,391
Speaker 1: It's more like some cops could watch it and they wouldn't be able to track people going around and evade privacy, but...

115
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,680
Speaker 0: They could see when there's trouble.

116
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,878
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, "Hey, there's trouble on something and something, let's head over

117
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:19,099
Speaker 1: there.".

118
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:21,060
Speaker 1: And then when they get there, then you see people.

119
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:28,619
Speaker 0: Or they could have them on roads to monitor congestion real time and send people little SMS updates on their phones saying, "Hey, there's congestion, take an alternate

120
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:28,800
Speaker 0: path.".

121
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, they already do stuff like that, but a lot of the...

122
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,559
Speaker 0: They don't do that as much as they could.

123
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,880
Speaker 1: The thing is, the TV news people control a lot of that stuff.

124
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:37,418
Speaker 1: It's messed up.

125
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:40,040
Speaker 1: It's not as good as it could be with awesome computers.

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:47,060
Speaker 0: So there's this study that's been making a lot of rounds on the internet, and a lot of the news sites have picked it up, and FARC's been talking about it.

127
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,359
Speaker 0: I'm sure it'll get everywhere soon.

128
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:59,080
Speaker 0: And all the headlines say that the study shows that there's more women than men on the internet now, or women use the internet better than men, or women use the internet more than men, and all these wild conclusions.

129
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,080
Speaker 1: Is this the one-third of studies that are true, or the two-thirds that are false?

130
00:08:03,322 --> 00:08:03,900
Speaker 0: It's not false.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,859
Speaker 0: It's not really a study.

132
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,759
Speaker 1: Basically... It's not a study.

133
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Speaker 0: The Pew Foundation, they do a lot of research.

134
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,799
Speaker 0: They just did a survey.

135
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,640
Speaker 0: They called on the telephone a little over 6,000 people and asked them how they use the internet.

136
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,820
Speaker 0: Somehow, I don't think calling people on the telephone is a valid methodology for getting.

137
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,940
Speaker 1: I don't know why people still use the telephone as a methodology for studying anyway.

138
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:28,240
Speaker 0: Because there's no other way.

139
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,599
Speaker 0: No one responds to emails.

140
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:32,720
Speaker 0: They just get spam.

141
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,259
Speaker 1: The physical mail.

142
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:35,980
Speaker 0: No one responds to that.

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,440
Speaker 0: It's a junk mail.

144
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,198
Speaker 0: They just throw it away.

145
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:40,200
Speaker 0: A lot of people... This is why telemarketing is still around.

146
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,059
Speaker 0: It's still big business.

147
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,220
Speaker 0: People who have problems confronting other people are just prey for these people.

148
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,275
Speaker 0: Because you call them, and they're afraid to say no to you, and they're afraid to hang up.

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,340
Speaker 0: So they'll take your stupid survey, or they'll buy your crap.

150
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:57,660
Speaker 0: Mostly elderly people, and young people, and stupid people.

151
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:01,036
Speaker 0: That's why telemarketing is such a huge business.

152
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,640
Speaker 1: But it's not good for a scientific study.

153
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:04,739
Speaker 0: No it's not.

154
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,620
Speaker 0: But that's the only way that most survey people really have of actually doing their studies.

155
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,100
Speaker 1: Well maybe this is why everything is so screwed up, is because people are going by these phone studies, which are no longer good.

156
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,550
Speaker 0: Yeah.

157
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,920
Speaker 0: Well the thing is, even the data in their study is kind of spurious.

158
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 0: I mean, one, the study actually says that there were more women than men on the internet starting in the year 2000.

159
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,220
Speaker 0: Not in the year 2005.

160
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,758
Speaker 0: What do they mean "on the internet"?

161
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,279
Speaker 0: See that's the thing, they don't say.

162
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:29,518
Speaker 1: Oh great.

163
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:38,760
Speaker 0: The only thing in this study that actually looks like it might be valid is that apparently the more money you make, the more likely you are to be online.

164
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,020
Speaker 1: Gasp.

165
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:40,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

166
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,519
Speaker 1: Poor people can't afford a computer and another bill.

167
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:52,679
Speaker 0: The fact that black women use the internet more compared to black men, a greater gap is there than white women compared to white men.

168
00:09:53,641 --> 00:10:05,238
Speaker 0: And all these kind of useless statistical correlations that actually have no useful causation behind them, it's just really a bullshit study and I don't know why it's making all this news.

169
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:11,618
Speaker 1: It's because it has something to do with race or gender or sexuality and that makes big news.

170
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:12,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

171
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,238
Speaker 1: No matter what it is.

172
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:22,698
Speaker 0: Everyone seems to be trying to use this to say like "oh it's the end of the domination of men and the internet" or all these spurious claims and the study's just kind of horseshit.

173
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:26,180
Speaker 1: Since when do men dominate the internet?

174
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,600
Speaker 0: A lot of people seem to have that impression, at least in the mainstream.

175
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,740
Speaker 0: I mean consider, the internet when it began was mostly male nerd engineers in college.

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:59,320
Speaker 1: See it was never looked to me that men dominate the internet, it's just that when it comes to chat rooms and forums and things, especially geek-related things, and a lot of the internet is disproportionately geek-related because most geeks use the internet and a proportion of other non-geeks, you know, not so much, and the geeks, mostly the men.

177
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,359
Speaker 1: So that's how it works out.

178
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:11,340
Speaker 1: But there's all kinds of women all over the internet doing things that aren't visible like buying stuff and looking at shopping websites and clothing.

179
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,713
Speaker 0: The study just asked stupid questions like "do you use

180
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:15,235
Speaker 0: email?".

181
00:11:16,647 --> 00:11:16,958
Speaker 1: Yeah.

182
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,480
Speaker 0: And more women said yes than men in the study.

183
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,660
Speaker 0: By a statistically non-significant trivial amount.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,740
Speaker 1: Because some of the geeky men don't use email anymore.

185
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,440
Speaker 0: Honestly, I don't really use email.

186
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:34,979
Speaker 1: You know what, I get more emails from computers just notifying me of things because it's easier to do it that way.

187
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,960
Speaker 0: I mean like my dad a while ago wondered why I never emailed him anymore and I just admitted that honestly I just don't use email.

188
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:46,315
Speaker 0: I didn't want to sound, I don't know, too techy or mean but email is just kind of useless to me.

189
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
Speaker 0: It's like this old fashioned thing.

190
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:49,500
Speaker 1: Only old people in Korea use email.

191
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:54,960
Speaker 0: It's weird to think that in my lifetime I went from email is the best thing in the world to email is obsolete.

192
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,005
Speaker 1: Yep.

193
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,980
Speaker 1: Email's kind of slow.

194
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,820
Speaker 1: And the attachments don't even work anymore.

195
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,620
Speaker 0: Well not even the attachments.

196
00:12:03,761 --> 00:12:08,620
Speaker 0: Apparently I've learned that AOL just randomly arbitrarily blocks mail, spam or not.

197
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:09,552
Speaker 1: Great.

198
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,679
Speaker 0: Because there's a guy at work who tried to send email to someone who had AOL and it just never got there.

199
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,839
Speaker 0: AOL just wouldn't accept mail from him.

200
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:18,194
Speaker 1: Don't use AOL.

201
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:20,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's kind of the moral there.

202
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:28,999
Speaker 0: And don't believe studies you see on Google News that are pointed to by various, I'm going nowhere with that.

203
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:40,493
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you see a title of a study, like actually read the article and then try to extrude anything that's actually fact and see if there is or isn't because usually there isn't.

204
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially on Slashdot and Fark.

205
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,938
Speaker 0: If there's a story and the headline says study shows blah, nine times out of ten.

206
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:51,520
Speaker 0: if you read it, either the study doesn't show that or the study actually shows the opposite.

207
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,600
Speaker 0: And I'm not exaggerating.

208
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:54,600
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

209
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,340
Speaker 0: Just look through some archives and you'll see.

210
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:02,959
Speaker 1: The other thing is watch out for anyone who says study links, blah and blah, because link doesn't mean dick.

211
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,119
Speaker 0: Post hoc, non-ergo, proctor hoc.

212
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they'll say, I don't know, let me make something up.

213
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:11,280
Speaker 1: Apples cause cancer.

214
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,000
Speaker 1: Well, no, they'll say apples linked to cancer, right?

215
00:13:15,722 --> 00:13:17,880
Speaker 1: That doesn't mean apples cause cancer.

216
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,800
Speaker 1: That means it could be that people who have cancer tend to eat more apples.

217
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,440
Speaker 1: It could mean that people who eat apples tend to have more cancer.

218
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,839
Speaker 0: Like remember way back when there was all that fear about high tension power lines causing leukemia.

219
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,960
Speaker 0: There was a link between people living next to high tension power lines and their children getting leukemia.

220
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:43,270
Speaker 0: So there was this scare and a lot of people were afraid to live near power lines and subsequent studies showed that that's complete BS.

221
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:52,060
Speaker 0: and actually the only correlation there was that people who lived next to high tension power lines tended to be lower income people and lower income people are more likely to have leukemia.

222
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:55,360
Speaker 1: See, so the study said link, but link doesn't mean crap.

223
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:59,154
Speaker 1: If the study says cause, then it might have something.

224
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:04,917
Speaker 1: if the study actually does show a cause and effect relationship, but then you have to read the study to make sure they're not lying.

225
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,419
Speaker 1: Well, you did do that anyway.

226
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:07,034
Speaker 0: Yeah.

227
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,059
Speaker 1: But look for the word cause and look for the word link.

228
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,279
Speaker 1: That's important.

229
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:26,179
Speaker 1: So my computer mouse is this hot, awesome laser mouse of awesome and wireless, but it's not very style.

230
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:30,080
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's shiny, but it's not really cool or geeky or anything.

231
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:30,658
Speaker 1: It's the mouse.

232
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Speaker 0: Well, what do you expect?

233
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,679
Speaker 0: I mean, making a mouse that's in a funny shape tends to make it a crappy mouse.

234
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:36,377
Speaker 0: that just looks cool.

235
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,780
Speaker 1: It does make it a crappy mouse, but it does make it look cool.

236
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,558
Speaker 1: And you know what?

237
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Speaker 1: These mice here are probably the coolest mice in a funny shape I've ever seen.

238
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:45,338
Speaker 0: All right.

239
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,499
Speaker 0: They're cool, but you know what?

240
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:48,659
Speaker 0: Anyone who would actually use that has got issues.

241
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,678
Speaker 1: You know what?

242
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:58,360
Speaker 1: I would use it for like my laptop carry around with me mouse or like my emergency mouse because like you wouldn't have to do anything serious with it.

243
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,358
Speaker 1: So it wouldn't use it long enough to hurt your hand, but like for, I need a mouse in an instant.

244
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:10,138
Speaker 1: It's cool to whip it out at parties and whip it out at parties, you know, like, Oh my God, I need a mouse.

245
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,420
Speaker 1: Well, let me use the mouse.

246
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:12,919
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't even say what the hell they were.

247
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:18,727
Speaker 1: There's a mouse that's in the shape of pixelated super Mario and a mouse in the shape of a Goomba.

248
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:20,054
Speaker 0: Great.

249
00:15:20,941 --> 00:15:22,580
Speaker 1: I love that Mario Goomba merchandise.

250
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:23,520
Speaker 0: I know you do.

251
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
Speaker 0: You got that little diorama and everything.

252
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,399
Speaker 1: The diorama is so much better than I thought it was going to be.

253
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,219
Speaker 1: I want to get more of those.

254
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 0: So I discovered a kazoo, just, it's a kazoo and people are selling it.

255
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,320
Speaker 1: You mean like that green guy from the Flintstones?

256
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,402
Speaker 0: No.

257
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:40,176
Speaker 1: No?

258
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,079
Speaker 0: You know, kazoo, little piece of wax paper in it.

259
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,618
Speaker 0: This kazoo has a wire coming out of it that you plug into an amplifier, an electric kazoo, like an electric guitar, only it's an electric kazoo.

260
00:15:55,481 --> 00:16:01,399
Speaker 1: Can you like get some like distortion pedals and a whammy bar, a whammy bar in the kazoo?

261
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:09,479
Speaker 0: Even cooler, there is also a version that is a MIDI kazoo.

262
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,960
Speaker 0: So you kazoo into it and MIDI pops out on your computer.

263
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:16,640
Speaker 1: Awesome.

264
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,180
Speaker 0: So basically if you have good pitch, I guess it's a nice way to input notes if you're trying to compose something and you suck at the piano.

265
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,920
Speaker 1: Are there any digital recordings of this kazoo being played that we can listen to?

266
00:16:27,384 --> 00:16:28,239
Speaker 0: Not that I have.

267
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,998
Speaker 1: It could be a hoax then.

268
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:33,000
Speaker 0: No, they're for sale and people have definitely used them before.

269
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:35,139
Speaker 1: How much are they?

270
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:36,638
Speaker 0: I don't know.

271
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:39,899
Speaker 0: There was a thing on Gizmodo like two weeks ago.

272
00:16:40,643 --> 00:16:42,519
Speaker 1: Is this like an attachment for a normal kazoo?

273
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,654
Speaker 0: No, no, it's a whole kazoo.

274
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:50,265
Speaker 0: It's a kazoo and it has a microphone pickup lead built into it and then the wire comes out.

275
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,219
Speaker 1: We should get one for fun.

276
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,619
Speaker 0: They're black, they're kind of stylish.

277
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,400
Speaker 1: Not like those cheap plastic craps.

278
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,859
Speaker 0: I remember it was a non-trivial amount of money, it was at least like 60 bucks, so I'm not ordering one.

279
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,579
Speaker 1: That's not worth it for a kazoo unless you're like going to be a band that plays kazoo music.

280
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,339
Speaker 0: Why don't we just get a kazoo and hold it in front of the microphone?

281
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,579
Speaker 1: Now you're thinking something kind of outlandish.

282
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:17,398
Speaker 0: So, anyway, like we said yesterday, it's Star Wars day.

283
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:18,385
Speaker 1: Hooray!

284
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,799
Speaker 0: Da da da da!

285
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:24,816
Speaker 1: If this is a Star Wars episode...

286
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 0: Where is the ambassador?

287
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:28,217
Speaker 1: Oh, there he is.

288
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might have heard us say something about an ambassador at least every other episode on this show.

289
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,900
Speaker 1: That's from the very, very first scene of episode four.

290
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,458
Speaker 0: Darth Vader walks in and he's got this guy and he's holding him up by his neck and he's choking him to death.

291
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,655
Speaker 0: And he asks him, "If this is a diplomatic mission, where is your

292
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:47,278
Speaker 0: ambassador?".

293
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,340
Speaker 0: And then he kills the guy before he can even answer.

294
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,169
Speaker 1: Yup.

295
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:53,460
Speaker 0: And thus we're introduced to Darth Vader.

296
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,060
Speaker 1: Of course there was an ambassador, it was Leia.

297
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:57,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, she wasn't really an ambassador, she was rebel scum.

298
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:07,100
Speaker 1: She was rebel scum, but you know what, she counted as an ambassador and she was on the Imperial Senate soon to be no longer more existing... yeah.

299
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:07,584
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:15,257
Speaker 0: See, I'm always kind of sympathetic to the Imperial fighters, just because I like TIE fighter more than I liked X-Wing when the games came out.

301
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:25,018
Speaker 1: Well, the thing about it is like, you know, the Empire as a group, as an organization is not so good.

302
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,540
Speaker 1: And the rebels as an organization are kind of good.

303
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,178
Speaker 1: But the individual people, it's like, stormtroopers are cool guys, even though they're on the bad team.

304
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:38,599
Speaker 0: Well, unless they're the clones that killed all the Jedi back in the day.

305
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:39,740
Speaker 1: Oh, well that's different.

306
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,140
Speaker 0: I don't think they're still around, though, by the time we hit episode 4.

307
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think those are them.

308
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,658
Speaker 1: And you know, like, Boba Fett's a cool guy, even though he does some bad stuff, he's still a cool guy.

309
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:52,518
Speaker 1: Even Darth Vader's a cool guy.

310
00:18:53,321 --> 00:18:56,439
Speaker 1: And you, you know, he's the bad guy.

311
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:56,988
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:05,239
Speaker 1: It's just, I think that's part of what makes Star Wars so good, is like, usually you have a host of characters, and there's a bunch you like and a bunch you hate.

313
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,100
Speaker 1: But in Star Wars, you like all the characters.

314
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,460
Speaker 1: You like even, like, the big Jabba the Hutt, and you like the Emperor, and everyone's great.

315
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,799
Speaker 0: I didn't like, uh, Salacious Crumb.

316
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,380
Speaker 0: The little guy sitting on Jabba.

317
00:19:19,802 --> 00:19:22,220
Speaker 1: He's better than, uh, the Unspeakable.

318
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,040
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, yeah.

319
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:35,579
Speaker 1: In fact, I'd say the Unspeakable, that's probably why the Unspeakable made the first three episodes so bad and everyone hated him so much, was because he was the only character in all of Star Wars that anyone didn't like.

320
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, pretty much.

321
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,660
Speaker 1: Even C-3PO was annoying, but he always got blown up, so it was okay.

322
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:50,500
Speaker 0: But basically, the point of this show is that, this show, not Star Wars, is that we hadn't seen, you know, episodes four, five, and six in a long time.

323
00:19:50,781 --> 00:19:52,059
Speaker 1: Meaning, like, a year or more.

324
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:52,512
Speaker 0: Yeah.

325
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:07,460
Speaker 0: But we had seen, we'd watched one, two, and three as they came out, and we, a lot, there have been a lot of arguments going back and forth as to whether or not one, two, and three are better or worse, or if the only reason people like four, five, and six more is because of the rose-tinted goggles of youth.

326
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:13,611
Speaker 0: And after watching four, five, and six again, and really watching them and paying attention to them...

327
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:14,539
Speaker 1: It's still good.

328
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:20,839
Speaker 0: Well, I could watch episode four, five, and six over and over and over again just constantly and never get sick of them.

329
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:21,329
Speaker 1: Yep.

330
00:20:22,141 --> 00:20:24,119
Speaker 0: I don't think I could ever watch episode one again.

331
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:26,120
Speaker 0: It just wasn't entertaining.

332
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,260
Speaker 1: Maybe I could watch the Phantom Edit.

333
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Phantom Edit is actually fantastic.

334
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,477
Speaker 1: I know about the Phantom Edit, but I haven't seen it, but...

335
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,640
Speaker 0: Basically, it's everything you wanted from episode one of Star Wars, and everything stupid was removed.

336
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,940
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, everyone rags on episode one, because, you know, parts of it were just really, really terrible.

337
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:45,780
Speaker 1: But there were also really, really cool parts.

338
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:54,880
Speaker 1: It was like, you know, in episode six, it's like, at the end, there's the space battle, there's the Endor battle, and there's Luke the Emperor Invader, right?

339
00:20:55,026 --> 00:20:55,216
Speaker 0: Yep.

340
00:20:55,623 --> 00:20:57,439
Speaker 1: It's three parts, and all of them are cool.

341
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,460
Speaker 1: Even though one of them is the coolest, being the space battle.

342
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,680
Speaker 0: Episode one has that stupid pod racing part.

343
00:21:04,161 --> 00:21:06,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, the pod racing part is not a good part.

344
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Speaker 1: And then, like, at the end, you've got, like, the space, which sucks, and you've got the Jedi lightsaber fight, which is good, so you have two parts, but one is good and one sucks!

345
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:25,798
Speaker 1: All the parts have to be good, and that's why the first three Star Wars, the original Star Wars movies are so awesome, because all the parts were good, even though some might be better than others.

346
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,502
Speaker 0: Plus, I mean, people always say, "Hey, the acting in 4, 5, and 6 was just as bad, it was

347
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:30,953
Speaker 0: terrible.".

348
00:21:31,401 --> 00:21:33,579
Speaker 0: And for a few characters, it was pretty bad, but you know what?

349
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,879
Speaker 0: Obi-Wan Kenobi can frickin' act.

350
00:21:36,381 --> 00:21:36,716
Speaker 1: Hell yeah!

351
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:44,160
Speaker 0: We didn't realize, we were watching, and we even watched a couple of scenes again to see just how he reacted to things, and that guy knew what he was doing.

352
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, watch in the beginning when he saves Luke from the sand people.

353
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:51,056
Speaker 0: And Luke's like, "I'm looking for Obi-Wan

354
00:21:51,116 --> 00:21:51,519
Speaker 0: Kenobi.".

355
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:57,385
Speaker 1: And then watch, like, Obi-Wan's face, and it's like, "Damn, even if you know nothing about acting,".

356
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,614
Speaker 1: you're like, "That's good acting right

357
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:58,836
Speaker 1: there.".

358
00:21:59,420 --> 00:21:59,818
Speaker 1: Look at that.

359
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:11,240
Speaker 0: I mean, the only people who had something even close to that in episodes 1, 2, and 3 were Ewan McGregor, who played Obi-Wan of all people, and actually Mace Windu was kinda good.

360
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,880
Speaker 1: He was alright.

361
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Speaker 0: He definitely had it when, uh, we're gonna spoil things, you've all seen Star Wars.

362
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:18,960
Speaker 1: If you haven't, whatever.

363
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:23,379
Speaker 0: When Anakin goes up to him and is like, "Hey, uh, Darth Sidious, yeah, he's over that

364
00:22:23,399 --> 00:22:23,539
Speaker 0: way.".

365
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,811
Speaker 0: And then Mace goes, "You wait here," and he shows up with a lightsaber and is like, "I'm gonna kill

366
00:22:27,852 --> 00:22:27,914
Speaker 0: you.".

367
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:28,397
Speaker 1: Yup.

368
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:30,540
Speaker 1: Actually, the Emperor is not a bad actor.

369
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,000
Speaker 1: I think it was the same guy in all six movies playing the Emperor, from what I hear.

370
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:35,678
Speaker 1: Huh.

371
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,720
Speaker 1: Like, the same person is the same actor.

372
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,758
Speaker 0: That I do not know.

373
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,780
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's the same guy in all six, and that's cool, 'cause he's good.

374
00:22:44,022 --> 00:22:47,499
Speaker 1: And, uh, if you do not believe me, you will die.

375
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:52,000
Speaker 0: Though Hayden Christensen, the guy who played Anakin.

376
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,000
Speaker 1: He's just terrible.

377
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:59,093
Speaker 0: I mean, at first I thought, alright, he's probably just the directing, but then we looked at what else he's been in.

378
00:23:00,183 --> 00:23:00,400
Speaker 0: Nothing.

379
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy hasn't been in movies for crap, nothing good, nothing ever heard of, he sucks.

380
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:06,114
Speaker 0: Yeah.

381
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:12,080
Speaker 1: But the, uh, the chick who prays the princess, who's always the butt end of Slashdot jokes or whatever.

382
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,980
Speaker 0: You mean Natalie Portman?

383
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:13,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.

384
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:18,240
Speaker 1: Uh, she's actually in a lot of good movies, and she can act really, really well.

385
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,120
Speaker 0: Well, on that we can definitely blame George Lucas's direction.

386
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:21,614
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,179
Speaker 1: Well, and also, like, she didn't really have a lot to do in the second and third movies, as much as the first one.

388
00:23:27,565 --> 00:23:27,839
Speaker 0: Yeah.

389
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,800
Speaker 1: And, like, what she had to do didn't really leave a lot of room for, uh, awesome acting.

390
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:35,327
Speaker 0: Noooooo!

391
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,840
Speaker 1: But she did, she did make the, she didn't really help out the, uh, the lovey-lovey scenes much at all.

392
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,419
Speaker 0: God, that was just painful.

393
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:49,960
Speaker 1: Is this, I, I, I, uh, equa, e, equalitate, congru, what was the word?

394
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,220
Speaker 0: Wow, see, on one hand I should cut that out and put it in the outtakes reel, but on the other hand, that was awesome.

395
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,940
Speaker 1: Equate, equate, I equate that scene and those love scenes to, like, the rave scene in the second Matrix movie.

396
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:07,154
Speaker 0: See, I never actually saw the second Matrix movie, but I've heard so much about this rave scene.

397
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,479
Speaker 1: It's just 20 minutes of a rave.

398
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:09,257
Speaker 0: Great.

399
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,054
Speaker 1: That's it.

400
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:18,560
Speaker 1: It's just, it's as painful and terrible as the lovey-lovey scene in the second, uh, episode of Star Wars.

401
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:33,620
Speaker 0: Now, one thing I noticed, and I, this was in episode 5 mostly, but it also came back a little episode 6, and this is just things that I never really noticed before because I never watched Star Wars from a critical, pay-attention-to-everything eye, as opposed to a, "Ooh, things are shootin' at things" eye.

402
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:45,160
Speaker 0: And, uh, I noticed that Darth Vader kills, like, dozens upon dozens of Imperial officers throughout the course of the movies.

403
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:51,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other, I didn't even notice, like, his, his, like, funny jokes, like, he's like, he's talking to an admiral, and then he chokes him, right?

404
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:55,115
Speaker 1: And then he goes to the next guy, and he's like, "You, do this and this and this,

405
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:56,200
Speaker 1: admiral!".

406
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:58,673
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, "Crap, nah, I'm gonna get choked,".

407
00:24:58,753 --> 00:25:00,278
Speaker 0: and then sure enough, later on he gets choked.

408
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:15,240
Speaker 1: Yup, and then he kills him, and he tells another guy, you know, you, you have to really pay attention, 'cause you don't really care what ranks people have and stuff, that's stuff nerds pay attention to, but if you miss it, you miss that Darth Vader killed one guy and promoted the other guy, and it's funny.

409
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:23,881
Speaker 0: And then he killed the other guy, killed the other guy, so he's killin' all these officers, and then when Luke's there, and, uh, Darth, and Luke's like, "Eh, whatever, blah blah blah,".

410
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,296
Speaker 0: and Darth says pretty much, "My master's far less

411
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:27,818
Speaker 0: forgiving.".

412
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,080
Speaker 1: He's far less forgiving than choking everybody who even messes up once.

413
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,495
Speaker 0: And he keeps saying, "Do not underestimate the

414
00:25:33,596 --> 00:25:33,879
Speaker 0: Emperor.".

415
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,756
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Do not underestimate the power of the

416
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:37,219
Speaker 1: Emperor.".

417
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:38,653
Speaker 0: And Luke's like, "Eh, whatever,

418
00:25:38,693 --> 00:25:39,037
Speaker 0: Dad.".

419
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:40,439
Speaker 0: And then they finally get there.

420
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,539
Speaker 1: And he underestimates the power of the Emperor.

421
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,425
Speaker 0: Which is fine.

422
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,360
Speaker 0: at first, 'cause he's like, "You're just an old man, what are you gonna

423
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,423
Speaker 0: do?".

424
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,515
Speaker 0: And the guy's like, "You'll join the dark side, or you will

425
00:25:48,575 --> 00:25:49,098
Speaker 0: die.".

426
00:25:49,745 --> 00:25:50,458
Speaker 0: You will die.

427
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,497
Speaker 0: You will die.

428
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:57,338
Speaker 0: And then finally, the Emperor just gets sick of him, and the force lightning comes out, and that's the end of Luke.

429
00:25:57,567 --> 00:25:57,839
Speaker 1: Yeah.

430
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,279
Speaker 0: He underestimated him.

431
00:25:59,700 --> 00:25:59,826
Speaker 1: He did.

432
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,320
Speaker 1: Good thing Darth Vader, uh, you know, had some good, supposedly.

433
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,993
Speaker 1: The other thing that's, that you don't notice in the movie unless you really pay attention is, you know, everyone makes the joke, "It's a trap,".

434
00:26:12,656 --> 00:26:13,440
Speaker 1: you know, with the Akbar.

435
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:15,559
Speaker 1: But there's a lot of traps.

436
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,659
Speaker 0: Not only that, there's a lot of only hopes.

437
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,679
Speaker 1: It's just traps and only hopes.

438
00:26:19,801 --> 00:26:20,959
Speaker 1: That's all the whole movie is.

439
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,540
Speaker 0: Watch all three episodes, and just keep, like, make a drinking game out of it.

440
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:30,926
Speaker 0: Keep track of how many times someone says, either, "Something is my only hope," or, "Something is a

441
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:31,254
Speaker 0: trap.".

442
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:31,899
Speaker 1: Yup.

443
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:33,360
Speaker 1: Or, a trap happens.

444
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,660
Speaker 1: Like, there's some traps that people don't say it's a trap.

445
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,260
Speaker 1: Like, they go to the Cloud City, and Darth Vader's there, it's a trap.

446
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:47,057
Speaker 1: And then, the Emperor hides the fleet on the other side of Endor, and they come out, and it's a trap.

447
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:50,880
Speaker 1: You know, and then, uh, what else is a trap?

448
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,799
Speaker 1: There were some other ones.

449
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:59,480
Speaker 1: Oh, when they go to Endor, and he sent, you know, legions of his best troops to the surface.

450
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,229
Speaker 1: Yup.

451
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:00,737
Speaker 1: That was a trap.

452
00:27:01,521 --> 00:27:03,060
Speaker 1: Luckily, the Ewoks got him out of that one.

453
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,540
Speaker 0: But then Han Solo left his trap for them, and it was just traps back and forth.

454
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:07,110
Speaker 1: Yup.

455
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Speaker 1: It was just trap, trap, trap, trap, trap.

456
00:27:08,822 --> 00:27:09,820
Speaker 0: And everything's their only hope.

457
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,917
Speaker 0: I mean, first of all, Episode 4 is called "A New

458
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:12,119
Speaker 0: Hope.".

459
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:12,600
Speaker 0: Yup.

460
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,840
Speaker 0: And the first thing you see is Leia, the little recording, going, "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

461
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:17,730
Speaker 0: You're my only

462
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:18,015
Speaker 0: hope.".

463
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:18,679
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

464
00:27:18,761 --> 00:27:20,778
Speaker 0: And then later, Han Solo's like, "Lando, you're my last

465
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:20,980
Speaker 0: hope.".

466
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:25,848
Speaker 0: And then, uh, when they're gonna destroy the Death Star, they're like, "Alright, this is our final

467
00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:26,112
Speaker 0: hope.".

468
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,000
Speaker 0: Yup.

469
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,505
Speaker 0: "It's all with the

470
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:27,707
Speaker 0: hope.".

471
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,120
Speaker 1: Just, uh, hope that Episodes 1, I don't know.

472
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,720
Speaker 1: I wanted to make a joke about Episode 1, 2, and 3 being terrible and can use the word

473
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:37,928
Speaker 1: "hope.".

474
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:39,299
Speaker 0: Nah, nah, nah.

475
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:39,810
Speaker 1: Yeah.

476
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,660
Speaker 1: 3 actually wasn't that terrible.

477
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:51,420
Speaker 1: It was just mostly... They had all the fanboy awesome action, but it just wasn't, like, didn't have the good movieness to it.

478
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,237
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

479
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:06,519
Speaker 0: It had one thing going for it, and this is pretty much the saving grace of this movie, is that, you know how a lot of times you watch a movie, and it's like, something happens to a character, and there's an obvious correct decision that character should make to resolve things the right way.

480
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:10,060
Speaker 0: And then they do the exact opposite, and then the whole movie goes to hell?

481
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,656
Speaker 1: That always pisses me off when people do things in movies, and I'm like, "Why don't you just do X?

482
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,020
Speaker 1: It's so obvious it would solve all your problems.

483
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:18,019
Speaker 1: Oh my God, you're dumb.

484
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:24,936
Speaker 1: You're only not doing X because it's a movie, and it's dumb, and it's annoying, and I just, I can't stand to watch things like

485
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,118
Speaker 1: that.".

486
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:33,520
Speaker 0: Well, the fact that in episode 3, everyone does, I mean, there is a moment where I thought the movie was going to be really, really stupid, and I was just, I was almost going to stop watching.

487
00:28:33,684 --> 00:28:33,836
Speaker 0: Yep.

488
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:42,872
Speaker 0: When the Emperor is alone with Anakin, and he reveals himself, "I am Darth Sidious, dark side, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,".

489
00:28:42,892 --> 00:28:44,900
Speaker 0: and then Anakin leaves.

490
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:55,356
Speaker 0: And instead of doing the movie thing, which I expected, which was him not saying anything and then joining the dark side, instead he goes straight to Windu, like right away, and says, "Yo, Darth Sidious is that

491
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:55,518
Speaker 0: way.".

492
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,719
Speaker 1: "Hey, you, the most powerful Jedi there is.

493
00:28:57,881 --> 00:28:59,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Sith Lord, he's right there.

494
00:28:59,361 --> 00:28:59,631
Speaker 1: Go get

495
00:28:59,673 --> 00:28:59,735
Speaker 1: him.".

496
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:02,100
Speaker 0: And then Mace Windu does the other smart thing.

497
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,539
Speaker 0: He immediately goes, "What?

498
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:03,891
Speaker 0: Fuck

499
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:03,977
Speaker 0: it!".

500
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,580
Speaker 0: And he takes all his friends with lightsabers, and they go to kill the guy immediately.

501
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 1: And he would have killed him too if Anakin hadn't turned to the dark side.

502
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that was okay, because that was expected.

503
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,400
Speaker 1: Because that made sense.

504
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:17,160
Speaker 0: The fact that two people did the smart thing in a movie consecutively made that movie awesome.

505
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like those movies that you see where like, some guy's beaten his wife, and then the wife doesn't call the cops.

506
00:29:24,142 --> 00:29:24,839
Speaker 1: It's like, what the hell?

507
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,019
Speaker 1: It just pisses you off.

508
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,559
Speaker 1: It's like, you could solve all your problems, but you're dumb.

509
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:31,139
Speaker 1: It's that kind of thing that bothers me.

510
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,279
Speaker 1: But this is the exact opposite, so it's good.

511
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,653
Speaker 0: And one other thing we kind of noticed, and a lot of people have been talking about this, is that if you watch the movies from the perspective of R2-D2, R2-D2 is like God.

512
00:29:44,281 --> 00:29:44,920
Speaker 0: He does everything.

513
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,140
Speaker 0: He's responsible for every plot thing that happens in all of Star Wars.

514
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,460
Speaker 1: R2-D2 is responsible for every awesome thing.

515
00:29:50,701 --> 00:29:55,140
Speaker 1: Look how many times that they would have just been trapped or dead if it wasn't for R2-D2 messing with the computer.

516
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,120
Speaker 0: Turn off all the trash compactors on the detention level!

517
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,459
Speaker 0: Turn them all off!

518
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,098
Speaker 1: Oh my God!

519
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:01,880
Speaker 1: Oh my God, he turned them off.

520
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,040
Speaker 1: Oh my God, he opened the door that we were trapped behind.

521
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:07,360
Speaker 1: Oh my God, he hacked into the system and got the important information.

522
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:15,100
Speaker 0: And also, look at how many, every time something important happens, R2-D2 is around, any time someone tries to mess with R2-D2, something bad happens to them.

523
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:15,510
Speaker 1: Yep.

524
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,579
Speaker 1: Oh, look, he's in the X-Wing whenever there's important Luke X-Wing action going on.

525
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,879
Speaker 1: He's always in the Death Star or in the Star Destroyers and things, opening doors.

526
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,240
Speaker 1: He's always, he carries the Death Star plans right at the beginning.

527
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,540
Speaker 1: You see him before you see other important people.

528
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:33,857
Speaker 0: Yep.

529
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,697
Speaker 1: Just, "Here I am, I've got the Death Star plans, ha ha

530
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:36,899
Speaker 1: ha.".

531
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,280
Speaker 0: Plus he's smarter than everyone.

532
00:30:38,863 --> 00:30:39,500
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, totally.

533
00:30:39,721 --> 00:30:42,140
Speaker 0: He always does the smartest thing at any given moment.

534
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,100
Speaker 1: And he's brave, unlike a lot of other wussy people.

535
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,047
Speaker 1: I mean, like, Han Solo's.

536
00:30:47,088 --> 00:30:49,940
Speaker 1: kinda brave, you know, but he's stupid brave.

537
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,731
Speaker 1: Like when he runs down a hallway going,

538
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:52,315
Speaker 1: "Uhhhhh!"

539
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:55,719
Speaker 1: And then there's a million stormtroopers and then he turns around and runs.

540
00:30:56,961 --> 00:31:00,020
Speaker 1: R2-D2 just like, goes straight for where he's gotta go.

541
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:00,929
Speaker 1: He's just like, "Wit da

542
00:31:00,949 --> 00:31:01,253
Speaker 1: twew!"

543
00:31:02,001 --> 00:31:05,699
Speaker 1: And then he just rolls right towards wherever the action is and gets right in on it.

544
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,700
Speaker 1: You know, I mean, you gotta be pretty brave to sit on top of an X-Wing.

545
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:11,740
Speaker 1: Yeah.

546
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,980
Speaker 0: Though, I gotta say, C-3PO is even more annoying than I remembered.

547
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:16,735
Speaker 0: I know.

548
00:31:16,901 --> 00:31:18,920
Speaker 0: But not annoying in a Jar Jar Binks way.

549
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,278
Speaker 1: I think he's less annoying because I know the annoying things he's gonna do.

550
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:22,911
Speaker 0: Yeah.

551
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,080
Speaker 1: So it's more painful when someone says something you don't expect and it's just painful.

552
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,758
Speaker 0: But it's like- Oh, look at the difference too.

553
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:31,499
Speaker 0: Every time C-3PO does something stupid, he gets blown up.

554
00:31:31,782 --> 00:31:32,620
Speaker 1: Or filled with sand.

555
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:32,951
Speaker 1: Yeah.

556
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,100
Speaker 0: Every time Jar Jar Binks did something stupid, he got promoted into the Senate or whatever.

557
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,735
Speaker 1: Yeah.

558
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:39,680
Speaker 1: That just didn't make sense.

559
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:41,562
Speaker 1: Mmm.

561
00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:44,280
Speaker 1: I like the Wookie.

562
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:45,243
Speaker 0: Mmm.

563
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:46,702
Speaker 0: Mmm.

564
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,382
Speaker 1: Mmm.

565
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:58,380
Speaker 1: I guess that's also kinda cool is how Chewbacca, like, you know, I kinda like, if I think about him, it's like, "The big bad Wookie.

566
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,331
Speaker 1: He's gonna get

567
00:31:59,352 --> 00:31:59,454
Speaker 1: ya."

568
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:00,080
Speaker 1: Right?

569
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:06,199
Speaker 1: And like, in the first movie, they're like, "Wookies don't rip, you know, droids don't rip people's arms out of their sockets when they

570
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:06,320
Speaker 1: lose.".

571
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:06,991
Speaker 0: "Let the Wookie

572
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:07,255
Speaker 0: win.".

573
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,332
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Let the Wookie

574
00:32:08,352 --> 00:32:08,495
Speaker 1: win."

575
00:32:08,947 --> 00:32:09,160
Speaker 1: Right?

576
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:15,320
Speaker 1: But the rest of the movie, the Wookie doesn't really rip any arms out of sockets so much.

577
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,059
Speaker 0: He's always a nice guy.

578
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,460
Speaker 0: He gives Luke a hug when he sees you.

579
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,517
Speaker 1: He's always friendly and happy and...

580
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,280
Speaker 0: Well, of course, if you've seen the Star Wars Christmas special, he really loves his family.

581
00:32:24,621 --> 00:32:26,080
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, don't even mention that.

582
00:32:28,224 --> 00:32:30,300
Speaker 0: You know, Boba Fett's in the Star Wars Christmas special.

583
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,034
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:32,644
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:32:33,587 --> 00:32:33,819
Speaker 0: Great.

586
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,419
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's his first appearance.

587
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,439
Speaker 0: He's not in episode four.

588
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:40,179
Speaker 1: No, he's not in episode four.

589
00:32:40,622 --> 00:32:41,415
Speaker 1: Except for that stupid...

590
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the made-up added scene that has the same dialogue from the previous scene.

591
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:46,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one.

592
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,980
Speaker 1: He did, uh, fall in the Sarlacc pit.

593
00:32:50,642 --> 00:32:51,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty much the end of him.

594
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:53,079
Speaker 1: I like the Sarlacc.

595
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:57,359
Speaker 1: See, that's another thing I like about Star Wars, is like, other movies will just have like a pit.

596
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,660
Speaker 1: But Star Wars, like, names the pit.

597
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:06,460
Speaker 1: So it's like, a lot of the stuff in the Star Wars universe is just made-up nerd stuff.

598
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,260
Speaker 1: But the movie kind of supports it by, you know, those little details like that.

599
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:11,796
Speaker 1: You know?

600
00:33:13,349 --> 00:33:13,678
Speaker 1: I don't know.

601
00:33:14,464 --> 00:33:14,918
Speaker 1: It's just cool.

602
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,860
Speaker 0: I guess all we can say is that we really like episodes four, five, and six of Star Wars.

603
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:28,200
Speaker 0: And to all the people who say that we only like them because we saw them when we were young, no, they're still awesome, and one, two, and three just don't have that magic.

604
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's not just a child eyes thing, definitely.

605
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:38,420
Speaker 1: I can prove it because, like, He-Man I watched, and I used to love with child eyes, but if I watch He-Man again, it's painful.

606
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
Speaker 0: For the love of God, don't watch He-Man.

607
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,539
Speaker 0: If you thought you liked that show when you were a kid, just let it be.

608
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Voltron's still cool.

609
00:33:45,305 --> 00:33:45,680
Speaker 0: It's alright.

610
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,560
Speaker 1: And Transformers is still cool if you're in the mood.

611
00:33:48,203 --> 00:33:50,120
Speaker 0: Eh, I'm rarely in the mood for Transformers.

612
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still, it can be good.

613
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,179
Speaker 1: Voltron's always good.

614
00:33:56,383 --> 00:33:56,555
Speaker 1: Yeah.

615
00:33:57,604 --> 00:33:58,138
Speaker 1: And Star Wars?

616
00:33:58,782 --> 00:33:59,199
Speaker 1: Also good.

617
00:33:59,460 --> 00:33:59,529
Speaker 0: Yep.

618
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:08,120
Speaker 0: And on our final note, let it be echoed throughout the ages, that Han Solo shot Greedo in the frickin' stomach, and he shot first.

619
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,839
Speaker 1: And you didn't even get to see him shoot because he was just this puff of smoke from under the table.

620
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,063
Speaker 1: Yep.

621
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,817
Speaker 1: Just poof.

622
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:15,780
Speaker 0: And George Lucas can go to hell on that point.

623
00:34:17,025 --> 00:34:18,478
Speaker 1: Uh, I think he's already on his way.

624
00:34:26,092 --> 00:34:28,190
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

625
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,810
