Speaker 1: Yes, like.

30
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,168
Speaker 0: it's not just that the production values have gone up.

31
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:48,350
Speaker 0: It's that like Kinds of humor have gotten better and more polished and like humor writing has gotten everyone gets better at everything.

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,522
Speaker 0: I know I mean watch stand-up comedy from the early 90s.

33
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,696
Speaker 0: not much of it holds up guys Not much.

34
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,730
Speaker 0: some I some of everything Steven Wright, I still find funny even though other people have done his kind of humor better in since him.

35
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:06,109
Speaker 0: But I think he's still anyway, I digress.

36
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:08,256
Speaker 0: So it's Thursday.

37
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:10,024
Speaker 0: It's the anniversary of geek nights.

38
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,109
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

39
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:15,870
Speaker 0: No, it's not and I figured we could talk about actual politics.

40
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,140
Speaker 1: Well, you know you want to talk about it.

41
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,565
Speaker 1: all listeners want to hear it.

42
00:02:20,947 --> 00:02:28,730
Speaker 1: I'm not interested but I guess It's our anniversary, so we'll give gifts of people what they want.

43
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:29,292
Speaker 0: Well more.

44
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,301
Speaker 1: no, you should give us gifts of what we want.

45
00:02:31,381 --> 00:02:33,229
Speaker 0: you people always want us to do politics.

46
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:34,515
Speaker 0: shows Like what about the NSA?

47
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:37,950
Speaker 1: and Obama and foreign government talked about that like a hundred times.

48
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:41,341
Speaker 0: And as much as I like to talk about that stuff shit is not changed.

49
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:44,130
Speaker 0: the thing the insights there is nothing new to say.

50
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,199
Speaker 0: Well, there's new things to say.

51
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,370
Speaker 0: Scott is gonna doesn't give a shit.

52
00:02:48,232 --> 00:03:00,604
Speaker 0: The insights that I would give you are Should not be revelatory if you hear me talking about politics and start thinking oh, oh Then you really need to pay more attention.

53
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:06,627
Speaker 0: You need to read more Internet Even though my knowledge is starting to diminish since it's been a while since the last.

54
00:03:06,707 --> 00:03:07,390
Speaker 0: it's all politics.

55
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,987
Speaker 1: I mean this was an issue Right that they dealt with in the 1700s.

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,278
Speaker 0: Which issue I mean?

57
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:17,226
Speaker 1: privacy of people.

58
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:26,809
Speaker 1: Well, we have a whole Quartering troops and sort of came up with the answer already and the right answer hasn't changed much.

59
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:33,065
Speaker 1: and Yet people are still discussing it like it's new like they just discovered this.

60
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:37,680
Speaker 1: there's nothing new to say That was not figured out like a century ago.

61
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,742
Speaker 0: Well, no, actually most people aren't talking about it at all and don't care I just saying anyone who is talking about it.

62
00:03:43,024 --> 00:03:44,150
Speaker 1: There's nothing just like copyright.

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,370
Speaker 1: We've been having the same goddamn copyright argument since they invented the Internet.

64
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:53,960
Speaker 0: Ah, but in the early days of the Internet We had the big argument and came to a bunch of conclusions.

65
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:59,739
Speaker 0: and it's just government and society have not caught up to Internet Right, but there's nothing new to say they just up to.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,905
Speaker 0: but again if you listen to geek nights and you have some Revelation some in like moments of you did not.

67
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,110
Speaker 1: you should read more internets.

68
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,803
Speaker 1: All he does is read internets to you.

69
00:04:11,843 --> 00:04:16,844
Speaker 0: It's like Internet's the audiobook Yeah, but the point I'm getting at is that what you're gonna get is what we're gonna talk about right now.

70
00:04:16,904 --> 00:04:20,577
Speaker 0: is politics that actually Matters but it only matters only thing.

71
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:26,377
Speaker 0: if you live in New York City State, maybe New York State, New York State Yeah, but it affects the city more.

72
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:27,562
Speaker 0: These are all state.

73
00:04:27,662 --> 00:04:29,550
Speaker 1: they are things by one in the state.

74
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,596
Speaker 1: The state is.

75
00:04:31,617 --> 00:04:34,008
Speaker 0: the majority of the state is the city at this point.

76
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:38,270
Speaker 1: That is true But these are all state level things.

77
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:43,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know usually getting all disillusioned with politics cuz your vote don't mean shit.

78
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,057
Speaker 0: Yeah we know it don't mean shit and it's all corrupt.

79
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:51,299
Speaker 1: and unless you're mad rich and can like bribe some senators or whatever you basically just vote and that's it.

80
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:54,679
Speaker 1: and Basically, there's one thing you can actually do.

81
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:05,470
Speaker 1: you can do it a lot if you live in Oregon, but in New York California - mostly Oregon is almost all freaking like freaking, you know What's it called referendums and Oregon has what like one congressional district?

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:10,310
Speaker 1: I don't know, but they have a ton of referendums and like you send this whole booklet out to everyone.

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:16,130
Speaker 1: Anyway in New York, you know, we get these ballot proposals which are effectively referendums.

84
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:22,696
Speaker 1: You go in and you vote yes, or you vote no on these questions Not people actual issues.

85
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:26,688
Speaker 0: Oregon has one two three or it is like five congressional districts.

86
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:29,330
Speaker 0: good on you There's more than like five people living right.

87
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:35,008
Speaker 1: so on these things you can only vote yes or no, you can't give sort of a detailed response.

88
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,001
Speaker 1: and The thing is they're not like delineated by party lines.

89
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,446
Speaker 1: It's not like yes Democrat.

90
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,690
Speaker 1: No Republican, right?

91
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,050
Speaker 1: It's you actually are getting sort of, you know real Democracy happening here on these issues.

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,430
Speaker 0: But at the same time you're getting democracy from the least in foreign people who vote usually based on a bumper sticker.

93
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,390
Speaker 0: They saw telling them Proposition 5 is good.

94
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:03,478
Speaker 1: But have you seen in New York anywhere in the past month or two anything that says like yes on 3 or no on 5?

95
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:04,705
Speaker 0: I did in grocery stores.

96
00:06:05,107 --> 00:06:05,690
Speaker 1: Oh, what did it say?

97
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,990
Speaker 1: What did the grocery store want?

98
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,065
Speaker 0: I saw a thing in a grocery store that was talking about the first proposition.

99
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,509
Speaker 0: the casino won the casino one.

100
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:17,150
Speaker 1: It was just like dude is a grocery store care about casinos?

101
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:20,383
Speaker 1: They can put slot machines in the grocery.

102
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,230
Speaker 0: I don't know if it was there officially.

103
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,976
Speaker 0: Okay, but it was like vote.

104
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,682
Speaker 0: Yes proposition one.

105
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:26,786
Speaker 1: Okay price.

106
00:06:26,826 --> 00:06:27,870
Speaker 1: someone loves gambling.

107
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,670
Speaker 1: Maybe the guy who owns a grocery store is a gambling addict I don't know and he's tired of going to Jersey.

108
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:37,278
Speaker 0: but anyway I guess what the point we're making.

109
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:51,121
Speaker 0: the high-level point here is that we're gonna have a real conversation about politics as in The stuff that matters that we have a statistical effect over that we care about and that depending on how the vote goes Something real changes for us as real people.

110
00:06:51,341 --> 00:06:57,290
Speaker 1: and if you don't live in New York, it's probably meaningless to you Maybe entertaining to you and also you wanted it.

111
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,825
Speaker 0: You should find out the things you can vote for.

112
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:00,650
Speaker 0: that might matter.

113
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,061
Speaker 1: Yeah, you live somewhere else in the United States.

114
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:11,090
Speaker 1: most of you anyway, except you foreign folk I'm foreign folk don't have a government that has the kind of problems ours has most of you northern European types, especially.

115
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,083
Speaker 1: So you don't have to worry about this shit, but I'm sure you have other shit to worry about.

116
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:16,208
Speaker 1: So what have?

117
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:16,429
Speaker 1: so?

118
00:07:16,952 --> 00:07:22,290
Speaker 0: Proposite proposal one Authorizing casino gambling basically if you tough one for me already.

119
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if I'm gonna go yes or no because it's sort of even right.

120
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:37,870
Speaker 1: if you vote Yes That means they're going to allow real casinos with table games and everything in New York State up to seven of them But they won't allow any in the New York City for seven years.

121
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,683
Speaker 1: So that means the first one will open up in New York City in 2020.

122
00:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,656
Speaker 0: now already the thing.

123
00:07:42,818 --> 00:07:56,090
Speaker 0: I Ideologically, I believe in freedom over most other things, but I agree because I'm not a uppercase L libertarian I prefer to not have the freedom to murder people or dump raw sewage in the river, right?

124
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:56,693
Speaker 1: I agree.

125
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:59,590
Speaker 1: You should be free to gamble your money away if you wish.

126
00:07:59,690 --> 00:07:59,932
Speaker 1: I know

127
00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:03,634
Speaker 0: I should be able to gamble on a game of Puerto Rico with Scott if I want to and Absolutely,

128
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:11,888
Speaker 1: but but you are stupid if you do so in most cases Yeah, especially in a casino which there are no games you can win unless you are the house.

129
00:08:11,948 --> 00:08:13,300
Speaker 0: and thus Here's the reality.

130
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:20,708
Speaker 0: in my opinion Lotteries and casino gambling are just a tax on the poorest and least able people in our society.

131
00:08:20,728 --> 00:08:21,129
Speaker 1: exactly.

132
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:32,323
Speaker 1: people say Oh the lottery is okay because the money goes to schools, which it does And in fact this thing also says it goes to schools thereby Replacing the property taxes that normally fund schools.

133
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:36,801
Speaker 0: thus no net benefit to schools And then when gambling income dries up schools are fucked.

134
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:37,303
Speaker 1: Yep.

135
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:44,409
Speaker 1: It's going to say look Regulate to seven casinos increasing aid to schools permitting local governments to lower property tax.

136
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,594
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It says right there, right.

137
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:53,910
Speaker 1: So basically what they're gonna do is they're gonna tax rich people less and instead to tax the casino.

138
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:57,670
Speaker 1: You think well tax on a casino is a tax on the rich person who owns the casino?

139
00:08:58,177 --> 00:09:03,374
Speaker 1: No The money the casino gets comes from the poor people and the stupid people who go to that noise I would.

140
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,110
Speaker 1: are there high rollers in the casino?

141
00:09:05,231 --> 00:09:06,035
Speaker 1: Yes, very few.

142
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:08,870
Speaker 1: most of the money comes from old ladies putting coins.

143
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:12,303
Speaker 0: I would only vote yes for a casino in New York like this.

144
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,370
Speaker 0: if one it wasn't Obviously a corrupt law and I'll talk about why it's a car.

145
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,077
Speaker 1: I would vote.

146
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,229
Speaker 1: I would vote whoo.

147
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:29,310
Speaker 0: Yes, because if they did not lower any other taxes and this was just additional money going into school Even if they don't lower any other taxes, it's still a regressive tax.

148
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:40,164
Speaker 1: I would vote yes, if it was a casino only with high rollers No One could argue that people who are that sad are gonna.

149
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:43,621
Speaker 0: they're kind of making their way to Atlantic City Occasionally on those buses.

150
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:50,468
Speaker 1: obviously put their money in there And you're saving them some money because they have to travel less and to the bus to Atlantic City isn't if enough already?

151
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,490
Speaker 0: all Of the money as in like some ridiculously high.

152
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:57,848
Speaker 1: Oh, the casino is a non-profit casino 100% of its profits.

153
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:03,070
Speaker 0: either It has like an 80% tax or it's a government-run casino and all the profits.

154
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, the same way those liquor stores and those other states.

155
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:05,660
Speaker 1: exactly.

156
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:21,230
Speaker 0: if all the profits went into schools and Property taxes and other school revenues were not decreased in any way then I'd be okay with it because you'd be taking money from dumb and poor people now and Funding the next generation to be less dumb now.

157
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,736
Speaker 1: Here's what I would do if I was this.

158
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:31,197
Speaker 1: if I ran a state I would say look we're not gonna open up any casinos Except this online casino that only people in our state can use Which means less.

159
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:33,250
Speaker 1: poor people are gonna use that because it's an online casino.

160
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:34,309
Speaker 1: It's harder for them to use it.

161
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,740
Speaker 0: They would have a wink and a nod to that.

162
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:49,366
Speaker 1: only people in our state part obviously But it would mostly be People who have credit cards which eliminates a lot of those lower-income people's and it's mostly gonna be not as regressive attacks Also, it would cost less.

163
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:55,069
Speaker 1: We didn't have to open physical casinos and a hundred percent of the money that casino makes would go to the state.

164
00:10:55,352 --> 00:11:01,610
Speaker 1: But I'm This proposition, yeah, this is gonna be a no because this specific one.

165
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,653
Speaker 0: There's two problems with it.

166
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:07,730
Speaker 0: one the fact that it forces the first casinos to all be out of New York City.

167
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,459
Speaker 0: I'm done with this New York State bullshit.

168
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,234
Speaker 0: I'm done with New York State continuously Holding.

169
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:15,378
Speaker 0: it's so much cheaper.

170
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:26,329
Speaker 1: I'm actually keeping the casino outside of New York City Actually makes it less regressive because if you put the casino in the city all those poor people in the city You'll be able to go to it real easy.

171
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:35,939
Speaker 1: If you keep it out of the city It might end up being more like a Mohegan Sun, which is the kind of casino that you know The sort of middle, you know class Connecticut people go to.

172
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:46,829
Speaker 0: but obviously the moratorium on having it in New York City is purely Because upstate interests want to have the so-called economic benefit in their local area.

173
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,488
Speaker 0: first There's a bunch of pork going on with this.

174
00:11:49,412 --> 00:12:00,970
Speaker 0: You know that a bunch of people paid a lot of money to ensure the state Actually be in like these specific place a state senator somewhere whose buddies with a guy who wants to open the casino and he's pushing this.

175
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,044
Speaker 1: Anyway, all the reason the other one of philosophically opposed to this particular law.

176
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,170
Speaker 0: I forgot why I was opposed to it.

177
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:11,012
Speaker 1: It's a casino.

178
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:11,394
Speaker 1: Yeah.

179
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:16,730
Speaker 1: Anyway casinos are no on casinos, even though I think gambling should be is dumb to wait.

180
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,894
Speaker 0: Wait, what just happened here?

181
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:26,990
Speaker 0: Look at this ribbon Scott have an ideological position on something It's mostly yet also have a practical position on a reality of that thing.

182
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,658
Speaker 1: Most people who didn't real news can.

183
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:33,850
Speaker 1: we're basically more advanced than the real news already, which is why I ignore the real news.

184
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:36,985
Speaker 1: alright, so Number two this one.

185
00:12:37,005 --> 00:12:39,316
Speaker 0: All right Here's the other reason why I was mad about this law.

186
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:43,954
Speaker 0: all the literature that is for it is really pushing the idea that it Lets us lower taxes.

187
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,022
Speaker 0: I'm I don't want to lower taxes.

188
00:12:46,043 --> 00:12:46,745
Speaker 0: I want to raise tax.

189
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:47,930
Speaker 1: Right anyway.

190
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:55,869
Speaker 1: Number two this one I sort of don't care about and I can see good and bad and I'd not Passionate or I might even just not even vote on it.

191
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,770
Speaker 1: So it's what it is additional civil service credit for veterans with disabilities certified post appointment.

192
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:08,810
Speaker 1: so what this means is that if you are a veteran right and You have been wounded in some way or have disability of some kinds.

193
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:15,050
Speaker 1: You're in the military and now you have a disability and you want to get a state job in New York State.

194
00:13:15,432 --> 00:13:18,950
Speaker 1: Right you work for the state some kind of working for the state job, whatever it is.

195
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:26,225
Speaker 1: It could just be like janitor in the town in the city hall in the capital of Albany or you know Who knows what it could be, but some sort of state job.

196
00:13:26,245 --> 00:13:27,010
Speaker 1: It could be state trooper.

197
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,923
Speaker 1: All right, you have to take a civil service exam.

198
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:31,450
Speaker 1: There are all kinds of these things.

199
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:34,589
Speaker 1: I know some people have taken them and it's just a lot like bureaucracy.

200
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,650
Speaker 1: You take some crazy test and you get a score and that score determines whether you can get these state jobs or not.

201
00:13:40,731 --> 00:13:43,010
Speaker 0: I took one to be a part of the census and the federal government.

202
00:13:43,376 --> 00:13:44,190
Speaker 0: First job, right.

203
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:55,210
Speaker 1: so you take the civil service exam you just get a score and the higher score increases the likelihood or in fact guarantees the Likelihood or that you will or will not able to get a job working for the state.

204
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,255
Speaker 0: Well, so the sad thing.

205
00:13:56,295 --> 00:14:06,590
Speaker 0: when I took the federal one for the US Census in the year 2000 I got a perfect score and So pretty much of any educated person takes these things they will get a perfect score.

206
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:15,150
Speaker 0: So few people got more than 50% In my area that they called me daily begging me to work and I got offered every position.

207
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,921
Speaker 1: A lot of times people get a too good a score and won't get the job They want like they want to go work for the police station.

208
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:20,926
Speaker 1: It's like you can't be a cop.

209
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,696
Speaker 1: you score too high Stuff like that.

210
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,365
Speaker 1: Anyway, you hear those stories once in a while.

211
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:27,157
Speaker 1: So then I think I'm Might sound harsh.

212
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:29,169
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna vote no on this one, too.

213
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:33,070
Speaker 1: Okay, well you convinced me because I'm basically abstain right now.

214
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,290
Speaker 1: So my rationale is if you say yes Basically, what you're saying is that if someone's a disabled veteran they get bonus points.

215
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:40,030
Speaker 1: So they score middle of the pack.

216
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,190
Speaker 1: They're gonna get bonus points because they're disabled veteran and they might get a job that they were under quality.

217
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,409
Speaker 1: You know, they'll basically get preference over someone else.

218
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,850
Speaker 1: You scored the same as them which is sort of unfair if you think in a meritocracy kind of fashion, right?

219
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:56,784
Speaker 0: But it's also because we know our veterans get shit on right.

220
00:14:56,804 --> 00:15:00,978
Speaker 1: just because you're a disabled veteran You should get bonus points or you're a disabled veteran.

221
00:15:00,998 --> 00:15:02,101
Speaker 1: You deserve bonus points.

222
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,930
Speaker 1: Both of those in my mind are a hundred percent equally credible.

223
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:10,523
Speaker 0: I think we need better social safety nets for veterans So they don't need to do this kind of safety net.

224
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:27,450
Speaker 1: Well look at in New York City for example if you're a veteran you can get a street vending permit way easier and the street vending permit that you get as a veteran puts you Lets you set up your table to sell stuff in way better locations like the touristy areas Whereas if you're not a veteran, it's almost impossible to get that street vending permit.

225
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:37,270
Speaker 1: And even if you do get one It's gonna let you set up in a place where there's not a lot of people like you set up your hotdog cart in Astoria And not in you know right the corner of Central Park.

226
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:49,850
Speaker 1: And if you see a lot of those people who are street vending in New York City who have the really good spots and aren't breaking the law By getting illegal permits They're mostly veterans because those the people who can get the permits because of the way the system works

227
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:59,990
Speaker 0: But I guess because of the combination of our economy being not so great right now and the fact that a lot of people need These jobs anyway and veterans already get some level of preference.

228
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:06,330
Speaker 0: I really don't want to prod the bureaucracy further hmm, but think of the veterans.

229
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,850
Speaker 0: I do think I'm better in children.

230
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:13,110
Speaker 0: We need to think about the veterans at a much more systemic level than this band-aid law.

231
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,942
Speaker 1: That's true, but you still didn't convince me to not abstain.

232
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:18,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not 100%.

233
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:22,560
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna vote now But I'm probably gonna make a snap decision in the little voting booth.

234
00:16:22,861 --> 00:16:23,262
Speaker 1: abstain.

235
00:16:23,643 --> 00:16:28,177
Speaker 0: proposal 3 exclusion of indebtedness Contracted for sewage facility.

236
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,744
Speaker 1: you might say who gives a fuck about this.

237
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:31,350
Speaker 0: I give a lot of fucks about this right.

238
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,600
Speaker 1: So what this is is you let's say you have a town.

239
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,836
Speaker 1: you're a mayor in New York somewhere like Elmira piece of shit.

240
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:41,934
Speaker 1: town right and You want to set up.

241
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:42,817
Speaker 0: you live in Elmira.

242
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,564
Speaker 0: you take issue with what Scott just said.

243
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,150
Speaker 0: you know why fuck you.

244
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,300
Speaker 1: You know what.

245
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,189
Speaker 1: you're not even all right.

246
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,883
Speaker 1: Let's say you live in a good city in New York.

247
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:50,730
Speaker 1: New York like Corning.

248
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,048
Speaker 1: You're the mayor of Corning right Corning setting up some sewers.

249
00:16:54,068 --> 00:17:00,267
Speaker 1: well They've already got sewers there of course But maybe they need to improve the sewers or add new sewers for the new neighborhood or who knows what.

250
00:17:00,307 --> 00:17:02,244
Speaker 1: maybe the sewers get a Little broken they need to fix it.

251
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,275
Speaker 1: well They need some fucking money for that right?

252
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:08,550
Speaker 1: so where does the town get money if they don't have the you know enough tax money?

253
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:13,430
Speaker 1: Because they already budgeted all bonds get taken debt right you borrow fucking money.

254
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,291
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

255
00:17:14,573 --> 00:17:23,012
Speaker 0: this extends the limit of the debt that these that your city can have to have paid for Sewage infrastructure improvements.

256
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:23,935
Speaker 1: your sewer breaks.

257
00:17:24,117 --> 00:17:30,390
Speaker 1: you need to get some debt to fix the sewer or you need to expand your sewer because people have septic Tanks and they suck, but oh there's dead limits.

258
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,387
Speaker 1: There's a limit on the amount of debt you are legally allowed to take and you've already taken it all.

259
00:17:34,407 --> 00:17:39,527
Speaker 1: so you can't fix the Sewer and others poop everywhere, so if you say yes on this you're basically saying yes.

260
00:17:40,732 --> 00:17:50,368
Speaker 1: Allow towns to get more monies by borrow more monies than they beyond their limit Sewer so that they can fix the sewers and not have shit all over their town.

261
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:52,699
Speaker 1: now They and why would the fuck would you say no to this?

262
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:55,390
Speaker 0: well because the argument against let shit get everywhere.

263
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,598
Speaker 1: Everyone have septic tanks which are bad.

264
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:01,090
Speaker 0: more revenues, so we don't have to go into debt to do basic infrastructure.

265
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:05,030
Speaker 1: That's a good idea too, but but also you need to fix your shitter right now.

266
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,898
Speaker 1: You can't your shitters over phone.

267
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:07,742
Speaker 1: You don't wait on that.

268
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:14,726
Speaker 0: this exclusion has been in place since 1962. it just happens to be expiring next year right so that's the only reason we're voting on this.

269
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:15,930
Speaker 0: is we extended another decade?

270
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,398
Speaker 1: Well if it's worked from 62 to 2013?

271
00:18:17,398 --> 00:18:20,057
Speaker 0: now I don't know.

272
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:21,190
Speaker 1: poop all over the place.

273
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,100
Speaker 1: I mean look when we should say yes to keep the poop underground.

274
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,484
Speaker 0: look what happened right.

275
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:35,130
Speaker 0: it is possible that there are Townships or cities or municipal entities and even counties in New York State that are accruing debt that eventually will force them into bankruptcy.

276
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:38,149
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I don't know what to do about that.

277
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:42,110
Speaker 1: But just because you go bankrupt doesn't mean the people who live there should have poop everywhere.

278
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:42,973
Speaker 0: I feel like poop.

279
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:46,868
Speaker 0: poop prevention on a mass scale is one of the most important things.

280
00:18:46,889 --> 00:18:47,170
Speaker 0: go ahead.

281
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:51,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you're talking about things government does it's like take the poop away bring the water in.

282
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,610
Speaker 1: Okay Everything get set on fire.

283
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:59,759
Speaker 1: Not let everyone kill everyone.

284
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,430
Speaker 1: those are the right the fundamental parts before research.

285
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:12,290
Speaker 1: You know we're lucky that the things you have to worry about in government are like these high-level things like you know not They aren't important, but like abortion and stuff and all these kinds of you know social.

286
00:19:13,795 --> 00:19:15,059
Speaker 0: Do we get sewage right?

287
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,665
Speaker 1: yeah, no, it's you know.

288
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:18,310
Speaker 1: it's like yeah, we need gay marriage.

289
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:25,188
Speaker 1: That's important, but we're lucky that we can even think about that and not have to spend our time thinking about keep the poop underground Scott how do you know he's a king?

290
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:30,650
Speaker 1: That's right, so let's keep the shit off the king and the regular people.

291
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:33,198
Speaker 1: That's why we're better than those medieval folks.

292
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:36,750
Speaker 0: so four and five are kind of part of the same the same thing.

293
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:36,932
Speaker 1: It's.

294
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,509
Speaker 1: I don't know why it's split up like this.

295
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,530
Speaker 1: What would happen if you didn't vote the same way on both of these?

296
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,051
Speaker 0: I don't know.

297
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:43,538
Speaker 0: I didn't read the full text of.

298
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,643
Speaker 0: like what would happen?

299
00:19:44,663 --> 00:19:45,065
Speaker 1: free right.

300
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:45,627
Speaker 1: so what?

301
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:46,250
Speaker 1: the first one?

302
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,293
Speaker 1: We'll just do both together.

303
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:50,060
Speaker 1: the first one is basically let this little.

304
00:19:50,160 --> 00:20:01,318
Speaker 1: the Constitution of New York State says that the Adirondack Foresty land has to remain public property forever period say so that's a constitutional thing.

305
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:08,620
Speaker 1: so they want to make an amendment that says settle this land dispute and Let this part of the forest become private property.

306
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,810
Speaker 1: and the second one says let him frack all over that forest.

307
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,459
Speaker 1: That's now private property, so it's like well.

308
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,329
Speaker 1: What if we vote no you can't have the land.

309
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:20,330
Speaker 1: yes You can frack on it, or what if we say yeah, you can have the land can't frack it what happens?

310
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:20,892
Speaker 1: I don't get it.

311
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:21,856
Speaker 1: It makes no sense.

312
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,865
Speaker 1: I think obviously you vote.

313
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:25,030
Speaker 1: No you can't have the land.

314
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,279
Speaker 1: It's a fucking my land.

315
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,005
Speaker 1: It's state land.

316
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:27,710
Speaker 1: and no you're not gonna.

317
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:37,161
Speaker 0: Because if you vote for four what it does is the state gives up its claim on certain parcels of land But then gets an unlimited doesn't make other doesn't it?

318
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:44,503
Speaker 1: make a constitutional amendment such that all Future land is now longer protected by the Constitution because the amendment opened the can of worms.

319
00:20:44,684 --> 00:20:48,840
Speaker 1: so even though immediately only that land would Go it opens up all the other land.

320
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:55,089
Speaker 0: because the Constitution is now changed I can't I got to read the full text of it to figure out the nuanced detail of it.

321
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems to be specific to the town of Long Lake in Hamilton County.

322
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it doesn't even say what the dispute is.

323
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,428
Speaker 1: it just says there is a dispute and they can't resolve it.

324
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:07,521
Speaker 1: and in order To resolve it without amending the Constitution.

325
00:21:07,562 --> 00:21:09,470
Speaker 0: Why don't they just resolve it with eminent domain?

326
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:10,449
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good point.

327
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,082
Speaker 1: But basically in order to resolve it even if they use eminent domain it's set.

328
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:19,258
Speaker 1: one of the arguments here is they're gonna have a lengthy Court battle will be the Constitution is complicated.

329
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:25,035
Speaker 0: the Constitution actually forbids the lease sale exchange or taking any Forest Preserve lands.

330
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:26,662
Speaker 0: they can't hear reserves either.

331
00:21:26,682 --> 00:21:41,586
Speaker 0: yep, so if we vote yes We could actually Theoretically also take lands, but I don't really want to let Nyko minerals incorporated Fuck around with the forest just because I don't trust anyone in our government.

332
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:42,770
Speaker 1: because you use that forest.

333
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:47,124
Speaker 0: I just don't trust anyone anymore, and I kind of want to wait on.

334
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:49,070
Speaker 1: these things work so well in North Dakota.

335
00:21:49,371 --> 00:21:49,793
Speaker 0: Let's let.

336
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:56,221
Speaker 1: let's look at other places that say you know it's like whether you think you know whether there is an Environmental danger for the mining or not.

337
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:58,030
Speaker 1: it's like that almost doesn't matter.

338
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,073
Speaker 1: It does matter, but it almost doesn't matter that out It's not us.

339
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:10,770
Speaker 1: it almost doesn't matter for this decision because we can simply just look at The human effects of what has happened in North Dakota where they said yes and look at what is happening there.

340
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:20,217
Speaker 1: We're basically you have like all these horrible social things happening because of the mining community that has sprung up and We don't want that in New York at least.

341
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,081
Speaker 1: I don't want that in New York.

342
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:24,535
Speaker 1: keep that in your shitty state non-existent, North Dakota All right, I'm gonna figure.

343
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,304
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read a little bit of the details this one.

344
00:22:26,324 --> 00:22:27,630
Speaker 0: so go over the last proposal.

345
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:30,884
Speaker 0: Okay, I'm not sure I'm voting on the forest stuff yet other than no fracking.

346
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:32,110
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure I'm gonna vote.

347
00:22:32,212 --> 00:22:33,409
Speaker 1: No, you can't have the forest.

348
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:38,275
Speaker 1: But no you can't practice.

349
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,218
Speaker 0: yes, you can have the forest.

350
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:42,428
Speaker 0: also gets forest more forest back does it gets to pick.

351
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,632
Speaker 1: which forest are We picking?

352
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:48,349
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get maps and figure out which forest you like better over the last one about the old people.

353
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:49,538
Speaker 1: the last One's pretty obvious.

354
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:58,280
Speaker 1: it basically right now Judges in the Supreme Court which in New York State is actually the lowest court and the Court of Appeals Which is I guess the one above.

355
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:58,906
Speaker 1: that I don't know.

356
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:05,950
Speaker 1: But basically state courts state court judges are forced to retire when they're 70 just like get out your job is done.

357
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,975
Speaker 1: We're getting new judges.

358
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:18,297
Speaker 1: You know and I don't know if those are appointed judges or elected judges But whether you are appointed or elected you're kicked out at 70. your judging days are over and basically this says well look People are living longer.

359
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:20,686
Speaker 1: Why don't we let him keep judging till they're 80?

360
00:23:20,686 --> 00:23:21,630
Speaker 1: They're so experienced.

361
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,690
Speaker 1: Why would he kick out the experienced judge to bring in some young?

362
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,896
Speaker 0: Experienced on one end ideologically.

363
00:23:26,916 --> 00:23:30,265
Speaker 0: I don't like the idea of a mandated forced retirement.

364
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:36,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess not practically the old people People in government.

365
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:38,778
Speaker 0: yes You know that I'm sure there are good old people in.

366
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:39,140
Speaker 0: out of

367
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:57,018
Speaker 1: pure self-interest a young judge is more Likely to judge in a way that meets my sense of social justice less likely to say you know Not want to get do gay marriages or you know be racist when judging against or you know Person of color or etc.

368
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:57,500
Speaker 1: Etc.

369
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,410
Speaker 1: No, I'm not saying it all the old judges are like that.

370
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:08,845
Speaker 1: I'm just saying more likely that an old judge not knowing any individual judge is more likely To not do judge in the way.

371
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:09,510
Speaker 1: I want to judge.

372
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,590
Speaker 1: So I want to kick out the old judges and bring in the young judges.

373
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:17,270
Speaker 0: All right, I found some text that I got to go through in more detail on that forest one.

374
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:35,070
Speaker 0: Okay But the amendment seems to indicate that it adds an exception that allows the state to do this Settlement and trade the land for the other land, but they don't do anything else ever only in Relation to title disputes in Township 40 Totten and Crossfield.

375
00:24:35,171 --> 00:24:40,906
Speaker 1: So basically they're amending the constitute the whole Hamilton County to resolve this specific.

376
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:45,190
Speaker 1: There's a whole constitutional amendment That's gonna name this really fucking specific exception.

377
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,113
Speaker 0: You know what this tells me?

378
00:24:46,253 --> 00:24:48,740
Speaker 0: our state Constitution is fucked the fuck up.

379
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:51,890
Speaker 1: probably yeah, most of them are yeah, they're pretty old.

380
00:24:53,211 --> 00:24:56,364
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know the state constitution of Hawaii, which is pretty new.

381
00:24:56,384 --> 00:24:57,870
Speaker 0: I will read it in more detail.

382
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:02,716
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna vote yes on the first part and No on the second part.

383
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,222
Speaker 1: Well, you figure out if voting.

384
00:25:04,262 --> 00:25:09,186
Speaker 1: Yes on the first part is Means that they're gonna do some mineral whatever is or whatnot.

385
00:25:09,226 --> 00:25:10,010
Speaker 0: I'll figure it out.

386
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,242
Speaker 1: Yeah, who's take it doesn't even say who's taking the land.

387
00:25:13,323 --> 00:25:13,685
Speaker 1: I don't know.

388
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:14,790
Speaker 0: I gotta read it in more detail.

389
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,901
Speaker 0: It's like just tons of pain now imagine right?

390
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,469
Speaker 1: So we're gonna read this and figure it out.

391
00:25:19,132 --> 00:25:31,108
Speaker 1: Almost everyone who's going to vote it's gonna have no fucking clue and it's gonna vote randomly Again the kinds of decisions that I'd rather experts that we trust in government be making.

392
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:35,850
Speaker 1: well How come the state, you know legislature just couldn't figure this shit out?

393
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:36,633
Speaker 1: Why did?

394
00:25:36,713 --> 00:25:40,429
Speaker 1: why did it become a proposition on the ballot because the way our Constitution set up here?

395
00:25:43,294 --> 00:25:44,467
Speaker 1: Let's move on all right.

396
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:55,495
Speaker 0: so spooky things of the day Not-so-spooky.

397
00:25:55,576 --> 00:25:57,808
Speaker 0: So I have there's a tradition for me.

398
00:25:58,871 --> 00:25:59,835
Speaker 0: I'm a Farker.

399
00:25:59,895 --> 00:26:02,165
Speaker 0: if you guys didn't pick up on that I read far.

00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:06,124
Speaker 0: I don't post to Fark much.

402
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,270
Speaker 1: When's the last time you total Fark?

403
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,875
Speaker 0: Oh god, like four years ago.

404
00:26:09,016 --> 00:26:09,237
Speaker 0: Okay.

405
00:26:09,477 --> 00:26:12,810
Speaker 0: I only ever total farks if someone gifted it to me and I don't post that often anymore.

406
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:15,540
Speaker 0: I just read because I don't have time to post.

407
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,015
Speaker 0: I've kind of I don't think many people on Fark know who I am anymore But I thought Fark.

408
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:20,022
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

409
00:26:20,063 --> 00:26:21,050
Speaker 1: You were a name on fire.

410
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:26,606
Speaker 0: There's some people like my little pony killer and three-horn like there's people right.

411
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:30,113
Speaker 0: so anyway or That titty bopper.

412
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:30,654
Speaker 1: Sure.

413
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:37,190
Speaker 0: So there is a tradition on Fark every year in Halloween to have the Halloween spooky story thread.

414
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,570
Speaker 1: Doesn't it just get repetitive?

415
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:40,610
Speaker 0: No, because everyone has new stories.

416
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,973
Speaker 0: There's new people on Fark of.

417
00:26:42,214 --> 00:26:42,715
Speaker 0: people find.

418
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:52,255
Speaker 0: basically people post either their creepypasta or like the scary ghost stories that happen to them As kids that may or may not, you know, they're like, I don't believe in ghosts But when I was a kid.

419
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:56,821
Speaker 0: this freaky shit happened and here's my story Filtered through the memory of a child.

420
00:26:57,043 --> 00:26:59,537
Speaker 1: That's why it has ghosts in it And this is.

421
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:11,030
Speaker 0: this thread is a delight on Halloween And if you enjoy to read ghost stories, even if you do not believe in ghosts This is the kind of thread where you will find a bunch of kind of normal mundane.

422
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:21,780
Speaker 0: it's the kinds of stories that all your friends would collectively tell around campfires on Halloween and you can just read them collected in this Fark thread and I defy you to not be creeped out by fishy.

423
00:27:23,237 --> 00:27:27,520
Speaker 1: all right, so You know people like to wear costumes in Halloween.

424
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,363
Speaker 1: We're in New York City.

425
00:27:28,383 --> 00:27:39,834
Speaker 1: We've seen a lot of costumes going around But this one here at San Diego State University their college baseball team had their annual Halloween Contest.

426
00:27:39,914 --> 00:27:48,310
Speaker 1: basically, they played real game of baseball Wearing funny costumes and it's pretty great because you know, it's one thing to wear costumes.

427
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,960
Speaker 1: It's like I go to so many conventions now.

428
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:51,650
Speaker 1: costumes basically mean nothing to me.

429
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,312
Speaker 1: I don't even see them.

430
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:59,075
Speaker 1: two guys at work both cos both dressed up as Doctor Who and it was the same Doctor Who and they Didn't know.

00:28:13,096 --> 00:28:14,541
Speaker 1: it was the one with the fez.

436
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:18,729
Speaker 1: I don't know which one that is, you know, you know, okay I just know it's the one with the fez anyway.

437
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:27,010
Speaker 1: So yeah These guys played baseball in their costumes which increases the awesomeness and brick freshens up the whole thing again.

438
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:33,150
Speaker 1: Cuz not only are you wearing the costume you're doing something in the costume and some of their costumes are pretty clever and hilarious.

439
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,239
Speaker 1: Watching Obama at first base.

440
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:36,284
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

441
00:28:36,304 --> 00:28:39,199
Speaker 1: Yeah Obama getting the double play.

442
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:40,285
Speaker 1: Thanks Obama.

443
00:28:40,426 --> 00:28:48,685
Speaker 0: Yeah Actually speaking of Obama my Healthcare provider is getting rid of my plan and they're blaming Obamacare for it.

444
00:28:48,946 --> 00:28:50,230
Speaker 0: Okay, so now I got a change.

445
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,718
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get worse health care actually.

446
00:28:51,738 --> 00:28:58,169
Speaker 0: Okay, I have to change health care and is the worst The Obamacare then because I have to do it through my company.

447
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:03,370
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought it's if you don't get it through your company then it caused way more to get it through an exchange.

448
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:11,350
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought the whole point of the exchange was that you can get good Less than buying it from like just directly from a health care company.

449
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:15,107
Speaker 0: Yes But that's still way more expensive than getting it through your employer the old-fashioned way.

450
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:18,998
Speaker 0: if you can get a job The problem really is that you need a job to have health care.

451
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:27,524
Speaker 0: Mmm Obamacare is like the first baby is Backwards blind step toward a possibly almost better solution.

452
00:29:27,605 --> 00:29:33,066
Speaker 0: It's not the answer Mmm, and it's so sad that we had to fight that hard to get that like.

453
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:33,970
Speaker 0: that's what we want.

454
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:37,809
Speaker 1: Let's vote out these old judges and none of them will say Obamacare is unconstitutional.

00:34:22,684 --> 00:34:23,647
Speaker 1: actually it's all.

567
00:34:23,726 --> 00:34:40,904
Speaker 1: it's too easy for you Which made me reluctant to choose it, but that the reason of it being easy for him Was not enough to dissuade all the other good reasons for choosing it which are a it is on Scott's shelf hasn't been read yet, which is always the first factor, right?

568
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah and factor number two cyberpunk so relevant to netrunner playing and right, so next book club book is Idoru by William Gibson, which rim is already read.

569
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:57,490
Speaker 1: Yep, so he doesn't do anything.

Speaker 0: Well, I I can talk about it.

572
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,317
Speaker 0: The problem is I will talk in some generalities.

573
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:08,707

Speaker 1: You love surprises more than anything.

601
00:36:31,573 --> 00:36:33,729
Speaker 0: All right, why don't we?

602
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,027
Speaker 0: Buy it and review every DVD that comes.

603
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:38,670
Speaker 1: I already bought it.

604
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,252
Speaker 0: Well, we should.

605
00:36:39,393 --> 00:36:40,196
Speaker 0: I need anything.

606
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:41,321
Speaker 0: we have not already reviewed that.

607
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:43,470
Speaker 0: we see so nothing we should watch.

608
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:44,770
Speaker 1: We're not gonna see anything in there.

609
00:36:45,194 --> 00:36:45,476
Speaker 0: We have.

610
00:36:45,556 --> 00:36:47,190
Speaker 0: we have not reviewed Akane's high kick.

611
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,210
Speaker 0: So if we get 29 DVDs of Akane's high kick, I guess we're gonna have to watch it.

612
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,235
Speaker 1: I think they'll all be different.

613
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:53,004
Speaker 1: They're not gonna be 30 of the same DVD.

614
00:36:53,285 --> 00:36:54,270
Speaker 0: It'll be the sanctuary.

615
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,116
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't think that ever made it to DVD.

616
00:36:56,157 --> 00:36:57,120
Speaker 1: No, it's VHS only.

617
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,990
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about Stasi land the actual book club book.

618
00:37:00,234 --> 00:37:03,097
Speaker 0: so my Here are my criticisms of it.

619
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:04,341
Speaker 0: I liked it a lot.

620
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:05,284
Speaker 1: I like it.

621
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:11,877
Speaker 0: Okay, the stories were good but the author Focused way too much on the parts.

622
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:15,150
Speaker 0: I didn't care that much about and totally left the threads.

623
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:22,838
Speaker 0: I was really interested in just hanging like when she met with the basically the Super propaganda guy.

624
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:30,955
Speaker 0: Oh, that was the most interesting guy yeah, and she like barely talked about him and just like never done didn't finish the interview and Raised him a whole bunch.

625
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:32,222
Speaker 1: It's like oh that should have been.

626
00:37:32,242 --> 00:37:33,530
Speaker 0: I want to book just about him.

627
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:35,396
Speaker 1: I mean the guy was so crazy.

628
00:37:35,476 --> 00:37:36,941
Speaker 1: I can sort of understand why.

629
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:42,970
Speaker 1: you know, she more talked about, you know His personality and him and her being mad at him, right?

630
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,359
Speaker 1: And you know, which is understandable because you could totally.

631
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,551
Speaker 1: she did a really good job of letting you picture what that guy is Like.

632
00:37:48,571 --> 00:37:51,040
Speaker 0: my god him in my old man, right?

633
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:56,960
Speaker 1: It's like she did a really good job of that in this book, but Really bad job of talking about anything.

634
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,191
Speaker 1: He actually did historically or whatever Right.

635
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:01,877
Speaker 1: Like I want to actually know about.

636
00:38:02,178 --> 00:38:03,624
Speaker 1: you know things he did and whatnot.

637
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:09,785
Speaker 0: and I'll know historical Documentation almost and thus my primary problem with the book.

638
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:17,397
Speaker 0: while I enjoyed it Anna Funder put herself into the story in this sort of Journalistic way.

639
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:18,302
Speaker 0: that is a style.

640
00:38:18,402 --> 00:38:19,790
Speaker 0: I almost always hate right?

641
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,290
Speaker 1: Well, it's there are ways to do that right and I want the actually, you know thought Thompson does that very well.

642
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:27,626
Speaker 1: Michael Moore in his movies does that?

643
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, right He does his documentary where he self inserts.

644
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,023
Speaker 1: and the thing is even you look at him Sometimes it works like his like the first movie he did.

645
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:37,630
Speaker 1: what about Ford Motor Company?

646
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:43,222
Speaker 1: He did a good job of putting himself in there Yeah, but like in some of the other ones he didn't do a good job.

647
00:38:43,262 --> 00:38:52,630
Speaker 1: and you can actually see like in Fahrenheit 9/11 He only insert himself in so much as like narrating and didn't really go in the movie himself so much as the other ones.

648
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:57,750
Speaker 1: Maybe because he you know saw and recognized that putting himself in that movie didn't really work.

649
00:38:58,312 --> 00:38:59,858
Speaker 1: Right, and that's sort of the case you get.

650
00:38:59,999 --> 00:39:02,570
Speaker 0: I think it's weird conspiracy theory in the second half.

651
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,704
Speaker 1: Well, obviously the crazy conspiracy theory notwithstanding.

652
00:39:05,724 --> 00:39:07,471
Speaker 1: We're just talking about the filmmaking aspect Right.

653
00:39:07,492 --> 00:39:10,263
Speaker 1: So here in the book making aspect of this.

654
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:15,663
Speaker 1: It's like the self insertion I think in some parts was good and in some parts was bad.

655
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:16,867
Speaker 1: right in terms of the good.

656
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:17,469
Speaker 1: it was like.

657
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:22,090
Speaker 1: You know noticing those drunken guys who always hung out in the park and then going to hang with them.

658
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,914
Speaker 1: you know showing you.

659
00:39:23,934 --> 00:39:31,729
Speaker 0: you know that sort of thing that goes on by having those very mundane experiences like with her landlord who Lived through a lot of this shit, right?

660
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:33,334
Speaker 0: It's like being the outsider.

661
00:39:33,615 --> 00:39:48,055
Speaker 1: those people seem to open up to her more than they would a German right but in other parts It's like, you know she would just interview someone and you would end up learning less about that person's story because of the way the you know, the She was.

662
00:39:48,096 --> 00:40:03,252
Speaker 0: the perspective was you know Camera looking at both of them her and Telling me about her feelings Listening to this person and from her experience as an Australian who doesn't speak German that well, she spoke enough German You know Yeah But there's.

663
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:18,110
Speaker 0: there were points where she kind of noted that she like she would lose nuance and subtlety and I think it showed in The fact that some of her interviews she would put direct quotes But in a lot of them like you could see like to be direct quotes and then there'd be a long paraphrased paragraph.

664
00:40:18,653 --> 00:40:29,009
Speaker 0: I don't want to say she was lying or that she was filling But I think she was reading way too much into some of the things people said and I think she was.

665
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:37,216
Speaker 0: she was adding to the story more than was necessarily implied by what these people said and Implying a lot based on her own experiences.

666
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:41,450
Speaker 0: So I didn't a hundred percent trust her retellings of some of the stories.

667
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:43,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could see that for sure.

668
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,920
Speaker 0: She said a lot of things about.

669
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,770
Speaker 0: the other person was angry The other person was sad and I didn't really trust that those emotions were being captured.

670
00:40:52,670 --> 00:41:04,110
Speaker 0: But some of the stories were the kinds of stories that you wouldn't get in the more traditional Histories of this because she was a journalist there getting these stories not too long after the wall fell down.

671
00:41:04,316 --> 00:41:10,850
Speaker 0: Yeah When the German media was it still wanted too long after the wall fell down But the German media didn't want to touch this with a hundred-foot pole.

672
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:15,230
Speaker 1: No, and the thing is some of these some of these individual people like crazy propaganda guy, right?

673
00:41:15,732 --> 00:41:18,042
Speaker 1: It's like, you know milky was still alive.

674
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:18,785
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.

675
00:41:18,805 --> 00:41:19,890
Speaker 1: I mean, I know who he was.

676
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,630
Speaker 1: I didn't know he was alive at this that late in the game and wasn't even in jail or anything.

677
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:27,181
Speaker 0: Like some of these stories we wouldn't have gotten any other way.

678
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:34,428
Speaker 0: and my guy the guy who painted the line It's like those stories were great, especially the guy who stole that fucking plan.

679
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,980
Speaker 1: That's the best one That isn't that the same guy who painted the line.

680
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,890
Speaker 1: I think it was ya know or that's a different guy.

681
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,572
Speaker 1: It was a different guy.

682
00:41:39,592 --> 00:41:41,339
Speaker 1: It was a different guy.

683
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,049
Speaker 1: I think yeah the guy who stole or was it?

684
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,461
Speaker 1: It was the same guy could have been the same guy.

685
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:48,070
Speaker 1: that guy was an interesting, dude.

686
00:41:48,311 --> 00:41:55,394
Speaker 1: He reminded me a lot of like that guy who thinks he's like the fifth Beatle or whatever where it's like, yeah, right anyway, but

687
00:41:55,414 --> 00:42:04,109
Speaker 0: I guess my main problem with the book is that much of the history and everything else could have been gotten from better more direct sources.

688
00:42:04,129 --> 00:42:10,166
Speaker 0: and If you removed all the stuff about the author herself, then there wouldn't be much book left.

689
00:42:10,667 --> 00:42:14,216
Speaker 0: That's true Especially Toward the end.

690
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:22,370
Speaker 0: like she goes on and on about these sort of Trivial details of her trying to get it like she gets into the archive to watch some of those old propaganda videos

691
00:42:23,234 --> 00:42:23,294
Speaker 1: I

692
00:42:23,335 --> 00:42:25,673
Speaker 0: want to read a book just about those Propaganda videos

693
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:26,737
Speaker 1: you're telling me and she

694
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,652
Speaker 0: only was there for what like a day watching them and then she wrote her whole thing Just like

695
00:42:30,772 --> 00:42:35,714
Speaker 1: and the one she focused most on was like this lady who apparently you know She had.

696
00:42:35,754 --> 00:42:35,995
Speaker 1: really.

697
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:38,430
Speaker 1: it's like, you know who had a normal story, right?

698
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:49,992
Speaker 1: You know of living in a horrible place and it's like, you know She you know, that was the main focus is relating to these normal people and I think you know That was the person she could relate to most and it wasn't something that's you know worthless It was.

699
00:42:50,072 --> 00:42:52,947
Speaker 1: it was very valuable, but it it's not what I wanted.

700
00:42:53,008 --> 00:43:02,587
Speaker 0: her Her relation with her let that lady Had weird undertones at times that I couldn't tell if it was just the way she writes But I got.

701
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:11,410
Speaker 1: yeah she kept putting in like she kept trying to call her and leave voicemails and When they finally met again, they were super friendly after X years.

702
00:43:11,557 --> 00:43:17,090
Speaker 0: Yep Like a lot of the a lot of those scenes were just written with such detail that there's no way that was all recalled from memory.

703
00:43:17,733 --> 00:43:26,938
Speaker 0: And then shin and they read the way I would write the early parts of a romance Like a lesbian romance.

704
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:30,090
Speaker 0: I don't think that's what was going on, but they like it.

705
00:43:30,331 --> 00:43:31,033
Speaker 1: No that you could.

706
00:43:31,113 --> 00:43:32,197
Speaker 1: you can't disagree with that.

707
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:35,609
Speaker 0: Yeah, that undercurrent was there and it was really distracting.

708
00:43:35,629 --> 00:43:43,066
Speaker 1: Yep So the thing that I you know, the thing that the book, you know If you know about East Germany and you know, this isn't gonna teach you that much more.

709
00:43:43,106 --> 00:43:43,990
Speaker 1: You didn't already know.

710
00:43:44,378 --> 00:43:51,408
Speaker 1: All right You know in terms of you know What happened there historically speaking and if you want to know that and you don't there's better places to learn it.

711
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:59,277
Speaker 1: But the thing that I didn't know or that this book pointed out to me of the many points it made This wasn't the main point.

712
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:11,810
Speaker 1: But the thing that I thought was most interesting was how When when the East German people sort of Felt like, you know, uh, those Nazis are gone good, right?

713
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,361
Speaker 1: Like they weren't the night's like.

714
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:15,955
Speaker 1: no you were the time But those people are you.

715
00:44:15,975 --> 00:44:18,042
Speaker 0: it shows how powerful propaganda is.

716
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:20,630
Speaker 0: if propaganda says something you really wish was true, right?

717
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:25,550
Speaker 1: And also but also now they basically feel like oh those communists are gone.

718
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,370
Speaker 1: It's like no the ones of you who are old or you are like, you know what it's like a fucked-up Dumbo.

719
00:44:30,792 --> 00:44:31,856
Speaker 0: It wasn't the magic feather.

720
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:33,040
Speaker 0: It was you all along.

721
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:33,563
Speaker 0: That's right.

722
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:34,466
Speaker 0: You were the Nazi.

723
00:44:34,526 --> 00:44:35,972
Speaker 0: You were the communists That's right.

724
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:37,016
Speaker 1: And it's like I don't.

725
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:50,210
Speaker 1: that's not something that I was really thinking about but it's like oh You know because a thing that comes up often, you know is how the you know Young people of Germany people who are maybe even born, you know the same age as us.

726
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,630
Speaker 1: They were young when the wall fell or maybe they were born after the wall fell, right?

727
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,834
Speaker 1: You're born after the wall fell.

728
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,863
Speaker 1: you could be like freaking like 20 something years old.

729
00:44:56,943 --> 00:44:57,124
Speaker 0: Yeah.

730
00:44:57,264 --> 00:44:58,630
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember the wall falling.

731
00:44:58,773 --> 00:45:06,386
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too It's like, you know They still get like, you know guilt on them for the things that have happened in the past.

732
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:22,730
Speaker 1: and it's like we always say well That's bullshit because you didn't do any of that shit But your parents did you know, but meanwhile if you read this book it makes you think those people who were you know, the senior citizens of Germany don't feel or maybe some of them don't feel like they were.

733
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,275
Speaker 1: Yes, you were.

734
00:45:24,376 --> 00:45:28,048
Speaker 1: and then maybe the middle-aged people of Germany don't feel like they were.

735
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,445
Speaker 1: you know Germany at least don't feel like they were communist.

736
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:31,726
Speaker 1: What's like?

737
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:32,189
Speaker 1: yes you are.

738
00:45:32,612 --> 00:45:34,970
Speaker 0: Well, this book brings up all this idea that I've read

739
00:45:35,832 --> 00:45:36,534
Speaker 1: For the things that you

740
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:43,608
Speaker 0: actually did that in general Germany as it came back together at least with the the East German stuff in the Stasi

741
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:44,751
Speaker 1: Really

742
00:45:44,852 --> 00:45:50,707
Speaker 0: tried to kind of pretend nothing happened until it was too late to do anything with the information.

743
00:45:50,768 --> 00:46:00,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, like They're just trying to wait until enough people are dead to where when all the secrets start really coming out There's no one left to be personally affected enough to care.

744
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,890
Speaker 0: Yep, so that then it could just go into a museum without drama.

745
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,370
Speaker 0: When I mean you get like when the model look look at the puzzle thing, right?

746
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:12,507
Speaker 1: It's like yeah We could just get some computers and just put these all together without doing this.

747
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:17,326
Speaker 1: instead We're doing it this way partially because the computers are too expensive but partially for that reason.

748
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:21,710
Speaker 0: you just said yeah Germany is a very prosperous country now and that stuff they have the technology.

749
00:46:22,471 --> 00:46:26,850
Speaker 0: It could be done and it's not moving quickly because there's too many people alive or in those files.

750
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,590
Speaker 1: Which means you know, look how many Stasi bad people are alive and living about their everyday lives.

751
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,030
Speaker 0: Well, because look at the sheer percentage of people in East Germany who were part of that.

752
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:39,549
Speaker 1: Yeah, they weren't as evil as Nazis.

753
00:46:39,791 --> 00:46:42,023
Speaker 1: I mean, you know they were evil so they didn't get like Nuremberg.

754
00:46:42,064 --> 00:46:52,270
Speaker 0: if the US bad We if the US were like East Germany today, then we could assume that an arc in the front row crew forum Probably a third to half of you are in farmers.

755
00:46:52,511 --> 00:47:01,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's that note that I never I never realized this and it was brought up in two separate stories in this book that There were the opposition.

756
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:13,210
Speaker 0: organizations like the student groups had more Infiltrators in them than they had members But as a result the infiltrators actually made these groups look bigger than they were and how the Stasi had to deal with that as a problem.

757
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:14,155
Speaker 1: Well think about this.

758
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:17,130
Speaker 1: how this might relate to other places on earth.

759
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:17,973
Speaker 1: We don't realize.

760
00:47:18,014 --> 00:47:27,102
Speaker 1: like, you know when my grandma was young in the US A lot of the people in the US were people who actually were Confederates.

761
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:28,265
Speaker 1: They were alive.

762
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:30,290
Speaker 1: There were Confederate people alive.

763
00:47:30,952 --> 00:47:34,964
Speaker 0: Still people whose parents fought in the Civil War saw the moon landing.

764
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:36,247
Speaker 1: exactly, right?

765
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:44,248
Speaker 1: So It's like oh the the bad, you know There were slaveholders walking around on the streets in the United States.

766
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:45,533
Speaker 1: not anymore Right now.

767
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:47,882
Speaker 1: their children are there but their parents aren't.

768
00:47:47,942 --> 00:47:59,950
Speaker 1: but it's like, you know There are still these cases right where it's like, you know Some people feel like you know No longer guilty for crimes because some revolution happened and sort of washed everything away.

769
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:07,850
Speaker 0: But at the same time look at the sort of pragmatic reality of as much as I would viscerally have wanted revenge.

770
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,923
Speaker 0: I mean, it's hard to not want revenge if you lived under something like that.

771
00:48:10,943 --> 00:48:27,665
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but at the same time Germany Reassembled itself relatively quickly both after this and after just World War two in general and Japan also did the same thing By having that sort of period of just wait and wait until it's not as Japan

772
00:48:27,705 --> 00:48:30,977
Speaker 1: hasn't gone over that because it wasn't It wasn't even that long ago.

773
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:34,250
Speaker 1: also and those old Japan old people are way old.

774
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:35,821
Speaker 1: So plenty of those people are still around.

775
00:48:35,922 --> 00:48:37,030
Speaker 0: Yep, but there's got again.

776
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:43,210
Speaker 0: They're kind of just waiting and waiting and waiting and just waiting for this again at worse because what's his face is in there?

777
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:46,450
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, they got a few right-wing people and there's right-wing people in Germany, too.

778
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:50,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, but you know, at least you got the pirate party in Germany evening it out.

779
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:58,464
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the pirate party increasingly has to seem to ally with bad people to get anywhere, you know I'm not saying it's perfect or I'm just saying it's crazy.

780
00:48:58,504 --> 00:48:59,329
Speaker 1: things are going on there.

781
00:49:00,013 --> 00:49:02,244
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was an okay book, but I wouldn't necessarily.

782
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:04,909
Speaker 0: unless you're into this history I think there are better books to read.

783
00:49:05,323 --> 00:49:12,226
Speaker 1: Yeah Like I'm sure there's a book out there like history of East Germany or history of that crazy Propaganda guy or YouTube videos of his show.

784
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:14,977
Speaker 0: Yeah So yeah, that's it.

785
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:15,884
Speaker 0: We got the next book.

786
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,993
Speaker 0: It's Halloween It's 2013.

787
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:22,884

788
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:24,810
Speaker 1: How long will we still do it?

789
00:49:25,851 --> 00:49:27,222

790
00:49:27,262 --> 00:49:31,313

00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:17,220
Speaker 0: We're gonna have the So, uh, I guess we could do that or I could make that sound.

815
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,491
Speaker 1: I think this copyrighted or patented by whatever news.

816
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:23,578
Speaker 0: No, we'll just make it something else.

817
00:51:23,618 --> 00:51:24,340
Speaker 0: It's just Morse code.

818
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,754
Speaker 0: We'll make it say something geeky.

819
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:30,457
Speaker 1: Let's do this in Morse code.

820
00:51:30,698 --> 00:51:31,781
Speaker 0: That's real slick.

821
00:51:31,821 --> 00:51:32,222
Speaker 0: I like it.

822
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:33,486
Speaker 1: All right, we're good.

823
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:38,081
Speaker 1: Okay, so Scolito Scolito.

824
00:51:39,635 --> 00:51:44,070
Speaker 1: so, um Personal lawyer didn't cut it to no surprise.

825
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:49,990
Speaker 1: So he picks the most conservative judge he could find in all of the appeals course Samuel Alito.

826
00:51:51,577 --> 00:51:56,210
Speaker 0: Yeah He's a little conservative a little bit.

827
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:57,855
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz this I mean.

828
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:02,550
Speaker 0: the Senate's main gripe at least the Republicans main gripe with Myers wasn't that they didn't know about her.

829
00:52:03,031 --> 00:52:06,182
Speaker 0: It was that she wasn't proven to be conservative and not.

830
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:08,410
Speaker 1: well, this guy's real conservative.

831
00:52:08,591 --> 00:52:12,060
Speaker 1: But you know, you look at not real real conservative.

832
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,567
Speaker 0: He's I don't think he's yeah states rights.

833
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:15,550
Speaker 0: I think he's more.

834
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,434
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah Rovers his way.

835
00:52:18,495 --> 00:52:22,330
Speaker 1: they pretty much call him Scolito and his name is Alito because he's scalia, too.

836
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,540
Speaker 1: But if you look at there's a Scalia, however, you want to pronounce.

837
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,886
Speaker 1: I don't know how the correct pronunciation.

838
00:52:26,906 --> 00:52:29,133
Speaker 1: I've heard both but Scalia.

839
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:32,870
Speaker 1: I look at his voting record and like and a lot of things he votes the way.
