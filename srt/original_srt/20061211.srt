4
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:26,420
Speaker 0: Let's do this Once again, we're back from a crazy awesome weekend this time up in Albany at the northern geek house with the Matt crosses.

5
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:29,160
Speaker 1: But you know what the next two weekends?

6
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:30,844
Speaker 1: Nothing, nothing.

7
00:00:31,346 --> 00:00:38,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, well semi nothing nothing big like not going to a party not going out of town or anything I think on Sunday.

8
00:00:38,085 --> 00:00:42,240
Speaker 1: I'm like going to my parents house for Hanukkah or something, but that's that's essentially nothing.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,165
Speaker 0: That's perfectly fine.

10
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:43,607
Speaker 0: on Sunday.

11
00:00:43,648 --> 00:00:47,367
Speaker 0: I plan to go down to the city with Emily to buy a rice cooker Mm-hmm and such.

12
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:49,418
Speaker 1: you can come also if you want if you're.

13
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:51,263
Speaker 1: if you're back We'll see.

14
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:51,686
Speaker 0: We'll see.

15
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:56,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was gonna figure out what I'm doing over the Christ mass holiday.

16
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:58,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

17
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:05,839
Speaker 0: I'm still looking cuz I keep getting airfare deals, but it's a trade-off between how much money I'm willing to spend to be inconvenienced by the airlines.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,286
Speaker 1: Seriously, I Don't know if I were you.

19
00:01:09,306 --> 00:01:11,219
Speaker 1: I don't know what I do.

20
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:15,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, well we got a good argument with that right before we left the man cross party over the weekend.

21
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:18,047
Speaker 1: We did but pretty much it came down to.

22
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:21,500
Speaker 1: we agree, but we have very more strong-willed.

23
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:26,268
Speaker 0: It's pretty much half the crew is like yeah, fuck those airlines I'm not gonna pay lip service to that.

24
00:01:26,309 --> 00:01:28,120
Speaker 0: and half the crew is like I want to get where I'm going.

25
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,246
Speaker 0: So principles not so much.

26
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:35,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like we had the same principle, but if it was it's stupid.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,846
Speaker 0: So I won't do it versus it's stupid.

28
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:40,620
Speaker 0: So I'll do it because they didn't convenience me inconveniences me less than the altar.

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:53,184
Speaker 1: Yeah, in other words in the 60s you both would have been like, you know screw this Racism, but we would have sat in the front of the bus and they would have taken it and sat in the bag Except that we're white.

30
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,314
Speaker 1: Yeah that so except for the whiteness.

31
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:56,740
Speaker 0: so we got to sit in the front anyway.

32
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:57,862
Speaker 1: You know what?

33
00:01:58,424 --> 00:01:59,146
Speaker 1: You got my point.

34
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:00,029
Speaker 0: I get your point.

35
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,095
Speaker 0: I get your point during Vietnam.

36
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:03,700
Speaker 0: We would have been across the border.

37
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,888
Speaker 0: Well Either that it would be in jail.

38
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:10,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, possibly one of the two.

39
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:11,979
Speaker 0: I don't know what I would have done.

40
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:13,508
Speaker 1: I know how many did it?

41
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,220
Speaker 1: Well, he got pardoned eventually, right?

42
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, did anyone actually go to jail for a long time for draft dodging in Vietnam?

43
00:02:19,935 --> 00:02:24,389
Speaker 0: Well considering they all got pardoned No, but it wasn't pardoned for years after.

44
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,780
Speaker 1: so I mean you could have been in there for like, you know a while.

45
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,560
Speaker 0: Well, I know a lot of them just stayed in Canada because Canada is kind of nice place.

46
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,324
Speaker 1: I know that.

47
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:37,025
Speaker 1: but the ones who didn't make it to Canada the ones who got caught and went to jail I'm sure there was someone.

48
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:40,900
Speaker 0: you'd have to be pretty dumb back then to get caught trying to get to Canada.

49
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,160
Speaker 1: I know I didn't have the highest technology for finding people.

50
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:55,157
Speaker 0: You could have probably just ran away to Montana and not gotten caught even today in this modern day and age Most of the US Canadian border you can just walk across or drive your car across.

51
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:55,900
Speaker 0: No one's even watching.

52
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,766
Speaker 1: Just don't go where there's a major road.

53
00:02:57,806 --> 00:03:03,648
Speaker 1: if you try to go over like a big bridge or a real fancy highway You're gonna get to go through a giant block.

54
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:04,050
Speaker 1: granted.

55
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:11,540
Speaker 0: granted even as recently as a few years ago I mean I used when I was RIT used to drive back and forth between Detroit and Rochester through Ontario.

56
00:03:12,082 --> 00:03:15,194
Speaker 0: see everyone a lot of people in the US and around the world.

57
00:03:15,214 --> 00:03:27,340
Speaker 0: they look at a map of the US and The map usually leaves out, you know, Canada and Mexico And I don't seem to realize that a big part of Canada juts way way down right next to Michigan.

58
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:32,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are parts of Canada that are farther south than New York and Michigan.

59
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:38,200
Speaker 0: Yep, and in fact, there's a lid basically a nice land bridge between New York State and Michigan.

60
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,717
Speaker 0: You can go straight between the two via Canada Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:47,880
Speaker 0: And the last time I went the last several times I went the border guards would literally just wave you through if they were even there.

62
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,449
Speaker 1: Supposedly now it's worse.

63
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,120
Speaker 1: I haven't been in a since Pango cons.

64
00:03:51,221 --> 00:04:00,140
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, actually the very last time I went through Canada It was a pain in the ass Because they asked me a bunch of questions and they almost like they held me for a while asking me questions.

65
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,160
Speaker 0: The line took forever and now you need a passport to go across.

66
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,964
Speaker 1: Is that really true now?

67
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:06,305
Speaker 0: Yes.

68
00:04:06,325 --> 00:04:11,900
Speaker 0: I don't know if the D day has happened yet, but they've started asking for him at border crossings.

69
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,580
Speaker 0: So say numerous relatives.

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,678
Speaker 1: But there's still places like out in like the north of North Dakota you mean the rest of the u.s.

71
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:21,399
Speaker 0: Northern Coast.

72
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know your coast northern, Idaho You can.

73
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:30,200
Speaker 1: it's just trees and then there's a sign that says welcome to Canada and it is trees and you just keep walking.

74
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:34,414
Speaker 1: Maybe there's a little fence and a guy and he says hey, what's up, man?

75
00:04:34,434 --> 00:04:35,498
Speaker 1: It's my job boring.

76
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:39,539
Speaker 0: Hey Hey, I can't really make fun of Canadians because they bring hockey to me.

77
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,287
Speaker 1: Yeah, good hockey.

78
00:04:41,307 --> 00:04:44,120
Speaker 1: supposedly like a fifth of Canadians have something to do with hockey.

79
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:44,963
Speaker 0: You know what?

80
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:46,830
Speaker 0: I wish my job had something to do with hockey.

81
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,560
Speaker 1: Oh shit ice hockey came up a virtual console today.

82
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,947
Speaker 1: I gotta go buy it when we go downstairs.

83
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:52,454
Speaker 0: Uh, oh shit.

84
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:53,520
Speaker 0: You just remembered that again.

85
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:01,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just remember how many times today if you've told me that that's coming out and I haven't turned on the Wii So I totally forgot man as soon as we finish the show, that's the end of the night.

86
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it might be right.

87
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:06,159
Speaker 0: so get into some actual news here.

88
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:13,676
Speaker 0: I don't know how much any of you know about arson, but for a long time these Arson that's when people burn shit down that they're not supposed to.

89
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:16,711
Speaker 0: yeah I see I grew up in Detroit now fire.

90
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:20,499
Speaker 0: when I grew up in Detroit It was a fairly bad place.

91
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:39,592
Speaker 0: Not as bad as you know, the race riots of the 70s and 60s and all their problems then but still I Don't know how because a lot of the world doesn't seem to have this holiday I guess and in fact in even in New York, most people really even if they'd heard of the holiday they never Associated it with the things that people in Southeast Michigan associated with.

92
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:56,384
Speaker 0: but there was a holiday called devil's night fire, which was the night before Halloween and in like in the suburbs of Detroit the Tradition on this holiday was to go around and egg people's houses and TP things and do pranks That it is a.

93
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,708
Speaker 1: it is a holiday everywhere.

94
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,618
Speaker 1: The thing is we don't celebrate it.

95
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:03,648
Speaker 1: So Seriously, it's sort of like haha.

96
00:06:03,668 --> 00:06:04,412
Speaker 1: It's devil's night.

97
00:06:04,452 --> 00:06:08,928
Speaker 1: Maybe one house gets TP low See even in the suburbs much more juvenile devil's night.

98
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:12,840
Speaker 0: There'd be roving bands of kids attacking houses furiously with chicken eggs.

99
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's much more juvenile out here where people are more civilized.

100
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:23,923
Speaker 0: Well, you see in Detroit, you know people celebrated devil's night by burning people's houses down Mass arson.

101
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:29,397
Speaker 0: lots of people got killed every year police patrols with riot guns everywhere.

102
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,640
Speaker 0: people garden their houses.

103
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:33,670
Speaker 0: It was actually a pretty scary thing.

104
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,880
Speaker 1: And then the next day everyone's happy and getting candy.

105
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,171
Speaker 0: Well, no, it was Detroit to the next day.

106
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,175
Speaker 0: It was business as usual.

107
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:50,371
Speaker 0: Yeah But arson was in fact when we used to live in downtown Detroit and one of the houses we lived in was fire bombed Not that long after we moved out of it.

108
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,094
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

109
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:57,800
Speaker 0: Yeah semi randomly What someone bad must have moved in or something someone bad must have moved in you say?

110
00:06:58,342 --> 00:06:59,968
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure someone bad moved in.

111
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:01,354
Speaker 0: we might have to do Detroit week.

112
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:02,940
Speaker 1: I don't know much about Detroit.

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,689
Speaker 1: I never even been there.

114
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,059
Speaker 0: Oh Something if you ever go out of town, I think I'll do Detroit week.

115
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:08,325
Speaker 1: I could do a whole.

116
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,711
Speaker 1: we're gonna go out of town for a week.

117
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,580
Speaker 1: so you can do four podcasts about Detroit.

118
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,022
Speaker 1: I don't know.

119
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,309
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll just at least do Detroit.

120
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,640
Speaker 1: what anime manga and comics came from Detroit?

121
00:07:16,742 --> 00:07:17,367
Speaker 0: I could think of some.

122
00:07:17,387 --> 00:07:19,059
Speaker 1: what video games had to do with Detroit?

123
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,940
Speaker 0: Well, essentially Grand Theft Auto All right, yeah, but but my father also was a fireman.

124
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,071
Speaker 0: I come from a long line of firemen and I'm the first non fireman.

125
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:34,248
Speaker 0: and I mean I watched backdraft when I was a kid And I never actually saw that movie.

126
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,880
Speaker 1: I just knew it was the movie with a lot of fire and firemen.

127
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,465
Speaker 0: It's actually a pretty good movie.

128
00:07:39,027 --> 00:07:39,910
Speaker 1: I don't know much about it.

129
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:45,393
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's actually went on like the backdraft ride at Universally, I did as well.

130
00:07:45,736 --> 00:07:55,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Anyway, so, you know we talked about because there were arson investigations often in Detroit Most of which would go unsolved, but there was a science to it.

131
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:10,677
Speaker 0: There's always been a science to it and a lot of people have been caught convicted and put in jail for murderous arson and arson various fire related crimes due to the very exact science of Analyzing a fire and figuring out how it started.

132
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:18,858
Speaker 1: Yep They can pretty much go look at a fire these guys and say this is a gas fire It started in this spot and then this burned and then that burned etc, etc.

133
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:37,768
Speaker 0: well, the news here is that that science had a lot of pseudoscience bullshit shoved in with it and Recent evidence and recent studies have not only shown that many of the assumptions of arts and science were completely wrong But they've proven that a lot of people were probably innocent of crimes.

134
00:08:37,788 --> 00:08:38,809
Speaker 0: They were convicted of.

135
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:57,702
Speaker 0: No, I was just gonna ask no Yeah They recently they've discovered a lot of like a lot of the quote-unquote telltale signs of arson are All I mean, they often indicate arson but not always and there are very very easily Happenable.

136
00:08:58,485 --> 00:09:00,834
Speaker 0: I'm not sure where I was going with that said possible.

137
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,702
Speaker 0: No, no, no, I'm common Reasonable.

138
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,709
Speaker 0: No, I wanted to make up a word there.

139
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:08,498
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean I could go on with the ottel.

140
00:09:08,598 --> 00:09:12,911
Speaker 1: ottel Your word is not polysyllabic so it's perfectly chromulin.

141
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:13,814
Speaker 1: not at all.

142
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:15,057
Speaker 0: Not at all.

143
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:19,398
Speaker 0: Not at all Defy you to deny the chromulants of the word happenable.

144
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:24,376
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's not possible for me.

145
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:24,999
Speaker 0: fail English.

146
00:09:27,673 --> 00:09:42,359
Speaker 0: So basically these people if you know, they have these telltale signs like if This happens if we find this evidence then definitely was arson because like the biggest one that I remember I can come up with I'm not I don't have the article in front of me.

147
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:51,077
Speaker 0: If a fire burns very quickly They would assume arson because fires can't spread that quickly without an accelerant like gasoline or kerosene.

148
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:58,330
Speaker 0: Oh It turns out there's a lot of situations where a fire could spread extremely rapidly and would look just like there was an accelerant But there wasn't.

149
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:19,755
Speaker 0: oh so Hopefully people who've been in jail Convicted of arson that they might not have committed will be released under this and I guess this Illustrates again the only reason I am against the death penalty and it's simply that I don't trust the legal system Considering how many times we have found a new science that then proves a whole bunch of people innocent.

150
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:20,618
Speaker 1: Yeah.

151
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,729
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, you know, it's all gonna come down to.

152
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:23,990
Speaker 1: do.

153
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,620
Speaker 1: you have a lawyer and did you hear this news?

154
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,225
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what.

155
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:36,960
Speaker 0: the answer for me is at least yes, yeah, so if the house burns down I didn't do it Or maybe you did and you're just smart enough to use this news to get away with.

156
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,110
Speaker 0: What would I stand to gain by burning down a house?

157
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,380
Speaker 0: I'm renting for which I don't have renters insurance.

158
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,622
Speaker 1: You could buy insurance Huh?

159
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:46,988
Speaker 0: RIM bought insurance.

160
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,253
Speaker 0: his house burned down.

161
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:49,539
Speaker 0: six minutes later.

162
00:10:52,096 --> 00:11:00,245
Speaker 1: I There's some guy out there who got insurance and the next day his house burnt down by accident and got busted at arts And that would totally suck.

163
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, you come home with your insurance check.

164
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,557
Speaker 0: your house is on fire.

165
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:04,359
Speaker 0: God damn it.

166
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,534
Speaker 1: Okay Apparently, you know it for all we know.

167
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:16,540
Speaker 1: at least until recently We thought that humans hadn't evolved in a long time because there really isn't any selection pressure.

168
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:31,015
Speaker 1: I mean people don't die that you know, whether you have a slight mutation this way or a slight mutation that way You're pretty much gonna survive long enough to reproduce Unlike case in point that case in point, but there are exceptions to that like sub-saharan Africa.

169
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,660
Speaker 0: there are there are but anyway.

170
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:36,555
Speaker 1: but anyway, they have discovered scientists who are all smarter than we are.

171
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:47,909
Speaker 1: a Recent instance of human evolution as in not long ago people were evolving because They started herding cattle.

172
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:48,976
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

173
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:49,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, really?

174
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,895
Speaker 1: Well, what happened was people herded cattle which meant they had cow milk.

175
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,300
Speaker 1: now most people.

176
00:11:56,304 --> 00:12:02,569
Speaker 1: The way their genes worked is they produce the enzyme Lactase or lactose not lactase.

177
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,655
Speaker 0: lactase ace means enzyme.

178
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

179
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:06,520
Speaker 1: I knew ace meant enzyme.

180
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:12,790
Speaker 0: That's what I was weird because music saying like oh god I thought of a cheesy poster for a science classroom.

181
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,819
Speaker 0: a big guy like a scientist with a beaker and his thumbs up.

182
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,053
Speaker 0: Enzymes, they're ace.

183
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:22,308
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah anyway Yeah, I'm proud of that.

184
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:23,756
Speaker 0: Oh, that was great.

185
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:33,408
Speaker 1: Okay, so Your body produces an enzyme called lactase one of many enzymes your body produces and if lactose gets in you the lactase goes Hey lactate.

186
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:36,926
Speaker 1: the lactase says Hey lactose over there.

187
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:40,816
Speaker 1: Yeah, what I'm gonna bust you up and it busted up so you can digest it.

188
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:51,398
Speaker 1: if you don't make Lactase which people used to not make it You can't eat lactose or else you get grumbly cuz you can't digest it and it makes you go all in.

189
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:54,050
Speaker 1: And that's what lactose intolerant people are like.

190
00:12:54,493 --> 00:12:55,276
Speaker 1: It's a genetic thing.

191
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:59,351
Speaker 0: Most of the time Ah, if I was lactose intolerant, I don't know what I would do.

192
00:12:59,371 --> 00:13:00,495
Speaker 0: I probably kill myself.

193
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,784
Speaker 0: I like cheese More than anything.

194
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:07,754
Speaker 1: I'm like possibly stab ice cream and milk and cheesecake and yeah.

195
00:13:08,175 --> 00:13:13,410
Speaker 1: Yeah don't like cheese sour cream Fresh all that good stuff.

196
00:13:13,612 --> 00:13:15,644
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't like cottage cheese me either.

197
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:31,880
Speaker 1: so it used to be back in the day that People would produce lactase when they were very small because they would be drinking breast milk and they would need to digest that when they Were babies, but when they were no longer babies their body would stop making the enzyme because no more milk to drink.

198
00:13:32,121 --> 00:13:33,351
Speaker 0: Your babies can't drink this milk.

199
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:34,298
Speaker 1: Your babies can't drink this milk.

200
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:51,912
Speaker 1: when people started hurting cattle and Taking cow's milk They would drink it and people who were lactose intolerant and did not produce lactase into their older age tended to be at a disadvantage because drinking milk would give them diarrhea and dehydrate them and such.

201
00:13:51,972 --> 00:14:00,318
Speaker 1: and there are all sorts of situations where Being able to drink cow's milk provided a significant genetic advantage such as oh shit.

202
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:00,940
Speaker 1: There's a drought.

203
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,479
Speaker 1: Oh wait, I could drink the cow's milk.

204
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,840
Speaker 0: So if there's a drought.

205
00:14:07,302 --> 00:14:08,280
Speaker 0: You drink the cow's milk.

206
00:14:09,442 --> 00:14:10,836
Speaker 0: Where's the cow getting the water?

207
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,660
Speaker 0: It needs to make that milk and where is it getting the water?

208
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,073
Speaker 0: It needs to to a little drought not a big to water the grass.

209
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:18,660
Speaker 0: a big in his little backyard.

210
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:23,417
Speaker 1: A little drought you say the point is over the course of thousands of years.

211
00:14:23,577 --> 00:14:35,960
Speaker 0: You were fine And my brother and I were arguing about what we do if there's no water in the world and my brother's answer was well We'd fill the pool with pop instead of water.

212
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:40,138
Speaker 1: You had just the syrup though.

213
00:14:43,504 --> 00:15:03,680
Speaker 1: The point is being able to digest lactose and Keeping that enzyme in production throughout the rest of your life provided a incredibly significant genetic advantage so much that 99% of Swedish and Dutch people All right can still produce lactase even when they're older and they're not lactose intolerant.

214
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,793
Speaker 1: Huh and back in the day everyone was lactose intolerant except for a few people.

215
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:12,767
Speaker 1: so anyone who thinks that Evolution isn't happening right now.

216
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,980
Speaker 1: Well, it's not happening right now as far as we know, but it can happen.

217
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,124
Speaker 1: It can happen fast.

218
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:19,793
Speaker 1: It can happen all over the place even to people.

219
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:32,198
Speaker 1: in semi recent times things of the day That was weak.

220
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,550
Speaker 0: What do you want every day?

221
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:40,434
Speaker 0: I said I yell something like things of the day or things of the day, and I thought I'd make stuff a little bit Whatever.

222
00:15:40,695 --> 00:15:42,845
Speaker 0: cuz it's got to be annoying to hear me yell things of the day.

223
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:43,749
Speaker 0: You know what I should do.

224
00:15:44,171 --> 00:15:45,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, you just stop doing it all together.

225
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:48,630
Speaker 1: No, cuz we let the music do its own thing.

226
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're getting a lot of new listeners.

227
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:51,229
Speaker 0: It kind of works out.

228
00:15:52,133 --> 00:16:03,499
Speaker 0: What we should do is I'll take the I'll do one of those radio sound effects of the things of the day day day Right.

229
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:10,190
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day this is actually It came up on dig today.

230
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:14,969
Speaker 0: So many of you who you know dig dig all day might realize that I've seen it.

231
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:22,070
Speaker 0: But for a long time, I've been a big fan of the Upright Citizens Brigade and their particular brand of sketch humor.

232
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:27,602
Speaker 1: They are quite humorous Especially the episode with the holes in the sheet and the bucket.

233
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,852
Speaker 0: you can do anything if you do it through a hole in the Sheet.

234
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:30,396
Speaker 0: that's right.

235
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:31,848
Speaker 0: or the poo on a stick.

236
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:41,618
Speaker 0: Honesty a classic very classic, but there was one sketch that Scott had never seen and I would make offhand references to it on a fairly regular basis.

237
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,102
Speaker 1: and one day Scott asked me.

238
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,546
Speaker 0: what the fuck are you talking about?

239
00:16:44,566 --> 00:16:51,060
Speaker 0: and I explained the skit and while it's funny being explained unless you see it, it doesn't really have the full comedic value.

240
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,036
Speaker 0: and Randomly today on dig someone linked to a video of the said skit.

241
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,280
Speaker 0: I Really don't want to ruin it other than that.

242
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:09,859
Speaker 0: It is quite hilarious and it involves a bunch of friends sitting around snowed in at a ski lodge or a house or somewhere Talking about the worst thing they've ever done that no one else knows about.

243
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:13,069
Speaker 1: Well the worst thing they've done to the other people in the room.

244
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, none of them know about.

245
00:17:14,395 --> 00:17:23,935
Speaker 0: so, you know there's kind of a thread that links all of them together and Then the last guy has pretty much the worst thing that could ever be.

246
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:28,874
Speaker 1: I Could think of worse things but it's about the worst thing you could.

247
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:30,360
Speaker 1: it's gonna happen in that show.

248
00:17:30,601 --> 00:17:32,496
Speaker 0: It does like it a little bit too fat.

249
00:17:32,556 --> 00:17:32,980
Speaker 0: our door.

250
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:39,396
Speaker 1: It does quite like in itself to the Battle of Faradore.

251
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,955
Speaker 0: So you might you might be God that con.

252
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:52,617
Speaker 0: yeah You might be able to make an educated guess as to what the horrible thing is and all I can say is You might want to mix in the 13th floor with that I never saw that.

253
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,500
Speaker 0: You know, it surprises me how few people saw that movie.

254
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,181
Speaker 0: I mean it came out pretty much the same time as the matrix had a similar plot and as a result just no one saw It.

255
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:09,371
Speaker 0: when in many ways it's a better movie in terms of exploring that idea I'm sure it's not better in terms of awesome action.

256
00:18:09,531 --> 00:18:11,760
Speaker 0: It is not better in terms of God.

257
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:17,100
Speaker 1: lots of guns Anyway, alright, so I was looking for a thing of the day and you know what?

258
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,774
Speaker 1: I saw lots of things of the day and I got one for like Tuesday.

259
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,180
Speaker 1: I got one for Thursday.

260
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,240
Speaker 1: Oh god, if you had a great one for Thursday.

261
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:29,800
Speaker 0: If you look in my dig and my delicious, you'll see more things of the day than I have days of the week.

262
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,067
Speaker 1: But I didn't have one for today.

263
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:35,359
Speaker 1: So I came across this one randomly and we're gonna use it.

264
00:18:36,422 --> 00:18:41,796
Speaker 1: This is a video of the 2005 national hammered dulcimer champion.

265
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,858
Speaker 1: His name is max The B roll teller.

266
00:18:46,782 --> 00:18:53,293
Speaker 1: He's playing a song called the apple juice, which is my favorite beverage and it's a song He wrote while he was at college now.

267
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:54,300
Speaker 0: This guy's fast.

268
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:59,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you don't if you don't know what a dulcimer is cuz I didn't know what a dulcimer was until just now.

269
00:18:59,962 --> 00:19:01,026
Speaker 1: It's a musical instrument.

270
00:19:01,086 --> 00:19:04,680
Speaker 1: It's basically a box full of strings of varying lengths.

271
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,373
Speaker 1: It's sort of a trapezoid shape and there are two types of dulcimers.

272
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:10,320
Speaker 1: one of them you pluck the strings.

273
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:12,960
Speaker 1: This kind you hit the strings of the hammer.

274
00:19:13,421 --> 00:19:22,252
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a piano without keys kind of sorta like a piano that has a midget inside and every time you hit a Key, he gets hit with a spike and then he hits a string with a hammer.

275
00:19:22,774 --> 00:19:24,219
Speaker 0: Yeah only without the midget.

276
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:37,419
Speaker 1: So basically this guy's got hammers and he's hitting strings with hammers really fucking fast like he should play his isle of phone or something cuz goddamn or a marimba or Steel drum because he can hit it real fast.

277
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:48,800
Speaker 1: Basically, you know if the song isn't the greatest song and the audio quality on the YouTube video and the recording really makes it slightly Annoying to listen to just because the audio quality screwed up.

278
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:52,931
Speaker 1: But just watch the guy swing the hammers real fast and you go.

279
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:53,313
Speaker 1: Wow.

280
00:19:53,353 --> 00:19:54,437
Speaker 1: There is a man with talents.

281
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:55,420
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

282
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:59,278
Speaker 1: And you also learn what a dulcimer is which is also good to know.

283
00:20:00,222 --> 00:20:13,637
Speaker 0: So today we were as always on Monday trying to come up with a topic since we didn't really want to launch into another series on how computers work just yet and We realized something that was actually requested of us a while ago and we can talk about an aspect of it.

284
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:16,603
Speaker 0: Very very Greatly and at length.

285
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:26,252
Speaker 0: We would like to tell you a little bit about the lost history of advertising on the internet and How it's not really a problem anymore at least for people like us.

286
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,800
Speaker 1: Well, mostly not a problem anymore.

287
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,459
Speaker 0: I haven't run afoul of problems in a long time.

288
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:38,104
Speaker 1: Well, there did you see just yesterday or recently they're putting ads and counter-strike, oh, yeah Yeah, and you know what?

289
00:20:38,144 --> 00:20:39,472
Speaker 0: I just won't play counter-strike anymore.

290
00:20:39,493 --> 00:20:42,528
Speaker 1: Well, not the old one at least I don't think they're putting in counter-strike source.

291
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,352
Speaker 0: I think they know better.

292
00:20:43,372 --> 00:20:44,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows?

293
00:20:44,316 --> 00:20:45,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to that.

294
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:47,106
Speaker 0: You see a lot of you today.

295
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:58,440
Speaker 0: Well, actually I noticed that many people I know or meet even geeks If I go to their house now use their computer and I go to a website like Fark or slashdot or livejournal or anywhere.

296
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:11,400
Speaker 0: There's a million ads flashy screaming moving around ads all over every website on the internet and It's always startling and it's to the point where I almost can't use computers to other people's houses.

297
00:21:12,102 --> 00:21:16,553
Speaker 0: Because on my computer pretty much for the last eight years.

298
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,080
Speaker 0: I don't see ads ever.

299
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,748
Speaker 0: There's no ads on the internet.

300
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:24,212
Speaker 1: I also don't see ads ever Pretty much.

301
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:27,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, and The internet used to not be this way.

302
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,427
Speaker 0: I mean when the internet not when it first started but when we first got on the internet There really weren't ads at all.

303
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:41,620
Speaker 1: Like a website would have an ad at the top Yeah, I mean I would first use like old prodigy or old AOL and you wouldn't see ads.

304
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:50,032
Speaker 1: I mean Maybe they might advertise their own stuff like you'd be in one AOL channel and it would tell you to use another AOL channel Or to tell you to log in at 8 p.m.

305
00:21:50,073 --> 00:21:51,178
Speaker 1: Because something was going on.

306
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:55,050
Speaker 1: But there wouldn't be ads like buy coke.

307
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:58,780
Speaker 0: I was about to say drink coke buy McDonald's food smoke.

308
00:22:00,364 --> 00:22:01,880
Speaker 1: You don't even see those ads nowadays.

309
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:09,205
Speaker 1: I still have yet to see a drink coke ad or a eat at McDonald's ad in the internet other than the coke website Which is basically just a coke ad.

310
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:14,763
Speaker 0: of course, of course, but but yeah, they're really there weren't ads on the internet and All.

311
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:15,065
Speaker 0: of course.

312
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,119
Speaker 0: also there wasn't a lot on the internet.

313
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:28,745
Speaker 0: Anyway, I Mean most people would go to a small handful of sites Then they try to search for something on Alta Vista dot digital come up with 10 broken links Give up and then go to bed.

314
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, imagine back in the day search engines.

315
00:22:30,812 --> 00:22:31,895
Speaker 1: You said broken links.

316
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:38,197
Speaker 0: Yeah search engines Imagine if you went to Google typed in I don't know Faradore and the first three links were just broken.

317
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:41,145
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and the internet?

318
00:22:41,186 --> 00:22:54,897
Speaker 0: I mean this there was free content and all the free content was either People in colleges with money putting stuff up companies trying to do goodwill on the internet or more often Geocities and fortune city.

319
00:22:54,917 --> 00:22:56,664
Speaker 1: Oh Geocities.

320
00:22:56,784 --> 00:22:57,768
Speaker 1: Yeah in those days.

321
00:22:57,908 --> 00:23:01,020
Speaker 1: You could get a website for free without paying money.

322
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 1: Yeah It's really limited in what you could do with the website given and you were given only a very small amount of space.

323
00:23:07,561 --> 00:23:13,460
Speaker 0: I remember when geocities upgraded Upgraded to a full two megabytes of space.

324
00:23:13,661 --> 00:23:17,214
Speaker 1: I remember when it upgraded to ten megabytes from two megabytes.

325
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:18,017
Speaker 1: That was holy shit.

326
00:23:18,037 --> 00:23:18,700
Speaker 0: That was nuts.

327
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:25,230
Speaker 1: It was even more nuts when there would be sites like crosswinds.net would give you unlimited space For and it was.

328
00:23:25,331 --> 00:23:27,099
Speaker 1: it was just the same Yep.

329
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:37,192
Speaker 0: But even then like all these geocities sites originally they'd made they'd ask you to put a little geocities banner somewhere on your site Saying hey, this site is hosted on geocities.

330
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:39,583
Speaker 0: in case you couldn't tell from the URL That was really.

331
00:23:39,643 --> 00:23:50,700
Speaker 1: the first kind of advertising was putting little tiny thingies on your site like view this site with Netscape Instead of what you're using or the blue ribbon campaign one of the most famous internet campaigns.

332
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,668
Speaker 1: Yeah free speech on the internet.

333
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,109
Speaker 1: Whoo.

334
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,740
Speaker 0: Yeah consider this completely unrelated back.

335
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:11,480
Speaker 0: Then the idea that the internet was protected free speech was not exactly understood by a lot of people and a lot of municipalities and Even the US government many times tried to basically outlaw free speech on the internet.

336
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:14,619
Speaker 1: And would they failed because we were smart?

337
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:22,880
Speaker 0: Yeah But there wasn't really advertising other than people advertising things they liked or people advertising their friends or their own websites.

338
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:26,670
Speaker 1: And then came things like link exchange.

339
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:27,412
Speaker 1: Yeah.

340
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,515
Speaker 1: Do you remember link exchange?

341
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:29,057
Speaker 0: I do.

342
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:30,300
Speaker 1: I wonder what's that link exchange?

343
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,143
Speaker 1: Let me go look it up.

344
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,072
Speaker 1: You can tell people what link exchange was.

345
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,579
Speaker 0: You know what I'd heard of it.

346
00:24:35,121 --> 00:24:36,726
Speaker 0: I avoided it at all costs.

347
00:24:37,368 --> 00:24:39,194
Speaker 0: I really had no interaction with it at all.

348
00:24:39,254 --> 00:24:40,960
Speaker 1: Didn't you see it on every single website?

349
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I ignored it.

350
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:46,860
Speaker 0: see I was already back then jaded and even when ads weren't commercial.

351
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:49,769
Speaker 0: I ignored them when ads started becoming commercial.

352
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:55,673
Speaker 1: I continued to ignore them until it took me to Microsoft.com Small business slash hub really?

353
00:24:55,693 --> 00:25:03,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me hold on Yeah, but I pretty much ignored ads a hundred percent up until I realized that with technology I could block them.

354
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,184
Speaker 1: Oh Wow, yeah Microsoft Okay, cool.

355
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:11,126
Speaker 0: Good game.

356
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:16,500
Speaker 1: So link exchange was this thing where you'd go to people's websites and you would see banner ads.

357
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:24,693
Speaker 1: They were thinner banners than we have the standard banner size now But they were quite kind of long and next to the banner would be this blue square.

358
00:25:24,753 --> 00:25:26,780
Speaker 1: that said le for link exchange.

359
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,940
Speaker 1: The way link exchange worked is you would join link exchange.

360
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:34,631
Speaker 1: You would create a banner and put it up on the site.

361
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:38,645
Speaker 0: now these banners didn't move they didn't have flash They didn't jump around.

362
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:39,648
Speaker 0: They didn't play music.

363
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,334
Speaker 0: They were just a little picture.

364
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,860
Speaker 0: that said come check out my thing.

365
00:25:43,181 --> 00:25:57,340
Speaker 1: yep, you would then put a link exchange banner on your site and What it would load random banners from link exchange and that other people, you know had joined and put them right in that little ad box.

366
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:11,254
Speaker 1: Then your banner would show up on other people's websites And I think later they changed it so that the more people visited you the more people who visited your page The more people would see your banner on other pages.

367
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:14,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the Corporations hadn't really figured out this whole.

368
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,159
Speaker 0: Hey, we can advertise on the internet thing.

369
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:23,920
Speaker 0: So as a result almost all the advertising was just people trying to get their stuff out there in mostly non-commercial fashion.

370
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:36,162
Speaker 0: Then came the age of advertising where bit by bit Websites appeared that were free But they had ads on them straight up ads Like.

371
00:26:36,423 --> 00:26:41,840
Speaker 0: I mean there were ad networks that were kind of like link exchange where you put in a script or there are web rings.

372
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:43,827
Speaker 0: Oh web, we don't need to talk about that.

373
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:57,452
Speaker 0: Okay, we'll do a whole separate show on that whole side of the internet okay, but ads started appearing like a company would advertise their hosting on slash dot or I caught some news site would advertise a thing on FARC.

374
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,939
Speaker 0: people would advertise their little shop selling t-shirts.

375
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:07,059
Speaker 0: and Then corporations started really advertising and filling up previously useful websites with advertising.

376
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:11,834
Speaker 0: garbage Banners got bigger and bigger and bigger different sizes all over the place.

377
00:27:12,536 --> 00:27:17,733
Speaker 0: There used to be a semi Unofficial agreed-upon standard as to where ads went on websites.

378
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:19,700
Speaker 0: that went totally out the door.

379
00:27:20,501 --> 00:27:26,100
Speaker 0: People would just stick ads wherever they could and it got to the point where eventually smart people said, you know what?

380
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,964
Speaker 0: this just isn't worth it.

381
00:27:27,984 --> 00:27:34,310
Speaker 0: and a lot of people would either like turn off images in their web browser or Modify their host file to block ads straight up.

382
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz a lot of ads I mean.

383
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:39,274
Speaker 1: earlier There were a lot of different ad systems.

384
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:40,279
Speaker 1: There was like ads.

385
00:27:41,003 --> 00:27:43,634
Speaker 1: There was double-click which is still around double-click.

386
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a fire there.

387
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:51,680
Speaker 1: There are a lot of them, you know But they eventually got pared down to just a few as they bought each other and died out and all that jazz.

388
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,560
Speaker 1: So you were able to use your host file to block just a few places and get rid of most ads.

389
00:27:59,031 --> 00:27:59,152
Speaker 0: Now.

390
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:07,690
Speaker 0: bear in mind also that while these ads were big and in the way They weren't animated yet and more importantly there was no such thing as a pop-up or a pop-under.

391
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:08,915
Speaker 0: No one thought of that.

392
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:11,286
Speaker 0: No one was obnoxious about it on the internet yet.

393
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:11,708
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

394
00:28:12,712 --> 00:28:23,247
Speaker 0: And then one day I was surfing with Internet Explorer because it used to be the best web browser around and This window pops up with an ad in it.

395
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:26,641
Speaker 1: Well people had pop-ups so they didn't use them for ads.

396
00:28:26,842 --> 00:28:28,890
Speaker 0: they use them for piss-poor navigation.

397
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:31,310
Speaker 1: They use them for piss-poor web design.

398
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:38,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we could do a whole thing about the early days of web design when frames were the almighty shit.

399
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, you think myspace is bad and it is.

400
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,827
Speaker 1: Go back to their late 90s and look at all the frames and pop-ups that were there on purpose.

401
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:46,927
Speaker 1: and there were parts of the website.

402
00:28:47,224 --> 00:28:59,670
Speaker 0: Yeah Where a website would trap you like a website would have a navigation bar and if you clicked on a link to another site That site would load in their frame instead of getting rid of the website because they wanted to trap you in their frame.

403
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:04,016
Speaker 0: So you'd see their navigation bar forever Mmm, usually on purpose.

404
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:05,321
Speaker 0: It wasn't even people doing it by accident.

405
00:29:05,341 --> 00:29:07,470
Speaker 0: People just didn't understand how to make a website.

406
00:29:08,274 --> 00:29:11,730
Speaker 1: Well, they figured hey, this will keep people at my website.

407
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,090
Speaker 1: They'll remember to come back because there weren't tab browsing in those days.

408
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,150
Speaker 1: So, you know chances are someone clicked on a link that you're never gonna see them again.

409
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:24,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of websites had escape frames buttons on them where you could escape from other people's frames.

410
00:29:25,034 --> 00:29:33,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and during all this Pop-ups started appearing and more importantly ads that were either interactive or animated.

411
00:29:34,672 --> 00:29:39,529
Speaker 1: Well, I think the animated stuff really started to get out of control when sites like was the money tree.

412
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,456
Speaker 0: Oh god, okay.

413
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:46,696
Speaker 1: There was a site and basically I was actually addicted to site for a few months Really?

414
00:29:46,776 --> 00:29:48,729
Speaker 0: I was addicted to it for about 30 seconds.

415
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:56,390
Speaker 1: Well, it was because every day at school I had time to sit in a computer lab and those computers really weren't capable of anything except loading web pages.

416
00:29:56,773 --> 00:29:59,190
Speaker 0: So you have to remember it was a different time you understand.

417
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:13,299
Speaker 0: Or 98 Where The dot-com boom and all these people running these ad companies thought that Advertising was not only a viable business method.

418
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:13,760
Speaker 0: Now.

419
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,444
Speaker 0: I'm not saying advertising a product.

420
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,550
Speaker 0: I'm saying advertising in and of itself.

421
00:30:18,712 --> 00:30:23,390
Speaker 0: They would sell advertising and then they would pay people or somehow trick people.

422
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:34,007
Speaker 0: Look at that advertising in order to prove to the people they sold the advertising to that it worked Because before with television and radio there was no way to really know how many people saw an ad.

423
00:30:34,288 --> 00:30:39,362
Speaker 0: with the internet You could count exactly how many people clicked on that ad or how many people downloaded it.

424
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:47,349
Speaker 0: and the marketing people who didn't understand technology Thought that these were great metrics and couldn't imagine that they weren't so accurate.

425
00:30:48,590 --> 00:31:01,910
Speaker 0: So it started turning into this thing where they would do anything possible to trick you Into clicking on an ad or seeing an ad Knowing full well that you didn't want the product and you would just get pissed off because they didn't care.

426
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:03,037
Speaker 0: It didn't hurt them.

427
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:05,069
Speaker 0: It only hurt the person's buying the ad space.

428
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,976
Speaker 0: so Dollar Tree Probably the epitome of this.

429
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:11,044
Speaker 1: Yeah dollar tree or money tree or whatever.

430
00:31:11,084 --> 00:31:24,718
Speaker 1: the site was hundred from ever now but was a website where there was a tree a picture of a tree a rather high resolution picture of a tree for the time for the time 97 or 98 and the tree had leaves.

431
00:31:24,778 --> 00:31:36,840
Speaker 1: but the leaves were dollar bills and you would click on this tree and each pixel of the tree was a different spot to click on and Only one spot on this tree in which you could click.

432
00:31:37,302 --> 00:31:39,890
Speaker 1: there was a prize where you could win a lot of money.

433
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:41,918
Speaker 0: It was only like 500 bucks.

434
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:42,862
Speaker 1: It was it was money.

435
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:47,171
Speaker 0: It was a lot of money to me when you know in 1997 or 98.

436
00:31:47,171 --> 00:32:05,546
Speaker 1: So you what you would do is you would click on this tree and then it would take you to another webpage and then a few seconds later, you would go back to the tree and click on it again and supposedly you would keep clicking on this tree until you won money and Basically you just ended up visiting their website many many times and making them lots and lots of money on ads

437
00:32:05,566 --> 00:32:12,130
Speaker 0: because every site that Every page in the site had ads all over it and you'd look at these ads and the advertiser.

438
00:32:12,992 --> 00:32:21,409
Speaker 0: Well the person buying the ad with the actual product didn't really pay attention Didn't realize that you didn't care about the ad at all that you ignored it that you probably blocked it.

439
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,623
Speaker 0: You were just clicking to get the $500 that you couldn't actually win.

440
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:25,386
Speaker 1: You could.

441
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:26,230
Speaker 1: it was just really hard.

442
00:32:26,431 --> 00:32:28,248
Speaker 0: I never knew anyone winning that money.

443
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,644
Speaker 0: I'll say it straight up if I had run something like that.

444
00:32:31,664 --> 00:32:32,770
Speaker 0: There would have been no prize.

445
00:32:33,215 --> 00:32:34,550
Speaker 1: I also would have had no prize.

446
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:46,283
Speaker 0: There's no way to verify if the prize existed or not because I mean if you have procedurally generated content or something You could just lie Straight up and very well could have been a lie, and I knew that.

447
00:32:46,344 --> 00:32:49,117
Speaker 0: yeah, we're not saying it anyway We're not we're not.

448
00:32:49,197 --> 00:32:50,283
Speaker 1: it could have been real.

449
00:32:50,363 --> 00:32:51,168
Speaker 1: It might not have been.

450
00:32:51,228 --> 00:32:53,237
Speaker 0: who knows I was pretty sure it wasn't when I was.

451
00:32:53,338 --> 00:33:05,035
Speaker 0: even if it wasn't real the odds of winning were so stupid You would have had to sit there Yeah, but there were also a lot of guys where they would pay you like pennies per hour To whenever you were surfing.

452
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:09,370
Speaker 0: run this program that would put banner ads at the bottom of your screen.

453
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:24,364
Speaker 1: There were computers that you could get for free But as law the only condition was that you had to have these ads Taking up like half your screen all the time and when those days the resolution was low So you were losing like a good quarter your screen space making your computer difficult to use.

454
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:26,750
Speaker 0: now this a correspondent entire cottage industry.

455
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:33,330
Speaker 0: People figuring out ways to run these programs without the ads actually appearing yet still getting the money and the free computers.

456
00:33:33,872 --> 00:33:38,730
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the free computers the money the gifts all the points and stuff that these companies are giving away.

457
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:45,419
Speaker 0: You know this was when people didn't seem to realize that Advertising on the internet does not work the way they thought it did.

458
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:58,122
Speaker 0: no it didn't so then as ad ad revenues started Dropping partly because people didn't really click on these ads because the ads are usually stupid And almost everyone looking at them was just trying to scam someone out of money.

459
00:33:58,764 --> 00:34:03,569
Speaker 0: If not just ignoring them straight up They started trying to trick people into clicking on the ads.

460
00:34:04,631 --> 00:34:06,879
Speaker 0: They would start making pop-up windows.

461
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:18,100
Speaker 0: you'd be browsing and this window would pop up and the window Inside of it would have a picture that looked like a windows 98 pop-up window with a little OK button and a cancel button.

462
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:28,898
Speaker 0: But if you clicked on that it took you to a website full ads Great, or it took you to some company's product though see there was no spyware really back then.

463
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:29,800
Speaker 0: you have to worry about that.

464
00:34:31,513 --> 00:34:32,447
Speaker 1: There Wasn't real?

465
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,600
Speaker 1: there wasn't super spyware.

466
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,498
Speaker 1: I mean there were some Java applets that might load and if you click yes They would fuck you over, but that was about it.

467
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,842
Speaker 0: It wasn't like it is now.

468
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:49,647
Speaker 0: no and right around this time is when smart people on the internet said we've had enough and shortly Thereafter pop-up blockers appeared now.

469
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:54,600
Speaker 1: the most pop-up blockers in those days though were crap like using them was worse than not using them.

470
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,953
Speaker 0: They just didn't let windows pop up which meant you couldn't go to most crappy websites.

471
00:34:58,154 --> 00:34:58,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, it made it.

472
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,568
Speaker 1: nowadays They're basically no crappy websites that use that.

473
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:04,393
Speaker 0: so there were debates on the internet.

474
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:05,757
Speaker 0: You know pop-up ads.

475
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:06,940
Speaker 0: are they moral?

476
00:35:07,321 --> 00:35:08,766
Speaker 0: Is it okay to block them?

477
00:35:08,827 --> 00:35:10,513
Speaker 0: is it okay to close them.

478
00:35:10,894 --> 00:35:12,399
Speaker 0: am I obligated to click on them?

479
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,108
Speaker 0: Webmasters would ask you to click on their ads.

480
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:18,080
Speaker 0: they would furthermore try to guilt you into clicking on the ads.

481
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:24,358
Speaker 0: There are people I knew who would say it's wrong to go to a website and not click on every ad they present because they Need that money.

482
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:29,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are people who would say that blocking ads was sort of like driving on a highway without paying the toll.

483
00:35:30,622 --> 00:35:37,543
Speaker 0: The thought see that argument while I disagree with it was at least better than you were obligated to click on the ads of any Website you visit.

484
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:39,249
Speaker 0: not just look at him, but click on him.

485
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:40,755
Speaker 0: Yeah to me.

486
00:35:40,996 --> 00:35:42,039
Speaker 0: That's just as dishonest.

487
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,879
Speaker 0: now You're just stealing from the advertiser because there's no way you clicked in good faith.

488
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:52,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically what was in those days the only way to make money with the webs?

489
00:35:52,177 --> 00:35:57,000
Speaker 1: because it was real easy to make A website relative to doing other work, and it was fun, and it that still is true.

490
00:35:57,662 --> 00:36:12,120
Speaker 1: But the only way to make money from a website was to either Rob essentially Rob from advertisers people who wanted ads or sell shit and Selling shit was already covered by Amazon and eBay, and it still is yep.

491
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,909
Speaker 0: So you know this is a major all raging.

492
00:36:14,929 --> 00:36:16,275
Speaker 0: and then some people got clever.

493
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:19,268
Speaker 0: they started having these Pop-unders that weren't as intrusive.

494
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,540
Speaker 0: they pop up a window in the background behind your web browser.

495
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:27,758
Speaker 0: So then at the end of your surfing session you close ie and there'd be 25 windows waiting for you.

496
00:36:28,461 --> 00:36:42,260
Speaker 0: Great all of them full with advertising bullshit, and then one day this monkey appeared And there was this boxing glove, and it said hit the monkey win like $500.

497
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,337
Speaker 1: I think that had something to do with money tree calm.

498
00:36:44,397 --> 00:36:49,315
Speaker 1: if not I'm not sure cuz my money tree calm had monkeys, but that the ad started getting straight-up fake.

499
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:54,420
Speaker 0: They would just lie and say Win the tic-tac-toe game and get a thousand dollars.

500
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,417
Speaker 0: There'd be a little tiny pixel of an asterisk next to that thousand dollars and on the website.

501
00:36:59,437 --> 00:37:03,886
Speaker 0: It would say something like thousand Banana dollars.

502
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:13,672
Speaker 0: that aren't actually worth real money and can't be redeemed for anything While you're here by this DVD player DVD players.

503
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:18,575
Speaker 1: then If they were selling what it would have been a bajillion dollars.

504
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:21,928
Speaker 1: there were DVD players Which is like a hajillion bajillion monkey dollars.

505
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,452
Speaker 0: there weren't actually that much money either.

506
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:25,519
Speaker 0: it depends not really.

507
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:33,744
Speaker 0: yeah I mean we didn't have a DVD player But I wanted one because I wanted to buy the DVD box set of record of lotus war which was less than half the cost Of the VHS box set.

508
00:37:34,606 --> 00:37:38,780
Speaker 1: it took up less space which is the biggest problem, but when I was a kid space didn't matter.

509
00:37:39,182 --> 00:37:39,423
Speaker 0: I didn't.

510
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:43,262
Speaker 0: I didn't even consider the fact that I had to store all the stuff I owned.

511
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,088
Speaker 0: I did see I didn't.

512
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,273
Speaker 0: I had invented space.

513
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:46,975
Speaker 0: my room was big.

514
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:48,320
Speaker 0: I could stick stuff in the house basement.

515
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,489
Speaker 1: It's still a concern of mine to this day now.

516
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:51,393
Speaker 0: It's a concern hence.

517
00:37:51,413 --> 00:37:53,100
Speaker 0: We're getting rid of all that old VHS action.

518
00:37:53,220 --> 00:38:02,277
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway things went on and nowadays We have like I say there's like three or four kinds of web ads these days.

519
00:38:02,678 --> 00:38:03,200
Speaker 0: what the kinds?

520
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:03,943
Speaker 0: I blocked the kinds.

521
00:38:03,963 --> 00:38:04,625
Speaker 0: I blocked the kinds.

522
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:05,027
Speaker 0: I block.

523
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,151
Speaker 0: and Google Adsense.

524
00:38:06,573 --> 00:38:07,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I now block.

525
00:38:07,898 --> 00:38:12,550
Speaker 1: yep The kinds are really.

526
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:12,951
Speaker 1: they have.

527
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:16,058
Speaker 1: pay-per-click is where you get money for every time.

528
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:17,742
Speaker 1: so much so It's.

529
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:34,817
Speaker 1: it's really weird because there's multiple parties involved in advertising now like if you put Google ads on your site now You've got the person who paid Google to get the ad Google and you who's putting the ad on your website, and how does the money go around?

530
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:35,980
Speaker 1: how does Google make money?

531
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,359
Speaker 1: It's crazy, but somehow it works.

532
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,511
Speaker 0: kinda kinda.

533
00:38:40,532 --> 00:38:45,758
Speaker 0: you see Just fast forward a bit you want to go over the all four kinds you came up with.

534
00:38:45,778 --> 00:38:47,745
Speaker 1: I Think I came up with four kinds.

535
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:53,375
Speaker 0: all right because I mean all I want to say is that the internet now for the unprotected Is a sea of?

536
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,122
Speaker 0: Absolutely shit.

537
00:38:55,182 --> 00:38:58,733
Speaker 0: tacular ads of adorning every single website in the world.

538
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:02,527
Speaker 0: yeah except front row crew calm Which has zero ads and will never have ads.

539
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:06,950
Speaker 1: no this pay by clicking this pay by impression Which is less often these days.

540
00:39:07,453 --> 00:39:23,479
Speaker 1: There's just There's like straight-up time like run this on your site for a few months or like affiliate You know put this better on your site forever because we're partners yep, and then there is the famous pay by like Registration which is every time like this.

541
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:28,200
Speaker 1: These are actually the most profitable kind of ads which is why you see them the most often.

542
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:30,246
Speaker 1: Are the ads for casinos and stuff.

543
00:39:30,306 --> 00:39:35,300
Speaker 1: or let's say I have a website and I put an ad for the online casino on my website.

544
00:39:36,122 --> 00:39:38,219
Speaker 1: Let's say you click on that ad I don't get shit.

545
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,280
Speaker 1: Let's say you look at that ad I don't get shit.

546
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:48,891
Speaker 1: Let's say you click on the ad and then you join the online casino, and then you gamble $200 then I get like 50 bucks, which is huge 50 bucks.

547
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:54,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, we have a friend who use that on his porn site to great effect.

548
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,864
Speaker 1: Yeah Because I think about it.

549
00:39:56,884 --> 00:40:04,814
Speaker 1: you get four people who click on an ad in your site and then join an online casino And gamble and then you get 200 bucks.

550
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:09,250
Speaker 0: That's crazy Yeah, but I mean there's these ads everywhere.

551
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:17,274
Speaker 0: I mean if any of you block ads I Suggest that you turn off your ad block just for a day and try to surf the internet.

552
00:40:18,097 --> 00:40:20,103
Speaker 1: It's pretty much intolerable It's painful.

553
00:40:20,123 --> 00:40:23,132
Speaker 0: I mean even penny arcade has horrible ads all over.

554
00:40:23,252 --> 00:40:25,458
Speaker 1: even dig has ads at the top really yeah.

555
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,093
Speaker 0: I really really really really I've never actually gone to dig without ad block on.

556
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:42,619
Speaker 1: I know that this actually this company federated media, they're they're like the Somewhat reasonable ad company on the internet That does lots of ads for big-name sites that we know.

557
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:50,426
Speaker 0: See I guess what I would say because I mean we didn't really go into a technical discussion We didn't actually go over the history We just kind of rambled about ads.

558
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:54,619
Speaker 0: but the moral of the story very simply is that to make the internet tolerable?

559
00:40:55,361 --> 00:41:05,400
Speaker 0: You pretty much you just run Firefox run ad block run the filter set G And then you won't see any of these ads at all and they won't bother you ever again.

560
00:41:05,802 --> 00:41:14,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when you really think about it the Google Adsense Which doesn't have big images that flash and you know blink at you and all that sort of shit.

561
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,438
Speaker 1: You know people tolerate it just because Google was like.

562
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:23,860
Speaker 1: aha We can make ads that are not as bad as the other ads and therefore people will think that we're doing good.

563
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,424
Speaker 1: We're not actually.

564
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:25,672
Speaker 1: we're just doing less evil.

565
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:26,940
Speaker 0: Let me it's not really evil.

566
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,851
Speaker 0: They have the right to put ads on websites they do.

567
00:41:29,871 --> 00:41:32,420
Speaker 0: I have the right to modify how I look at a website.

568
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:38,879
Speaker 0: However, I want you do in fact most websites I go to Especially if I go like myspace or something.

569
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:44,360
Speaker 0: I'll set up my web browser where it changes the background to black no matter what the background was.

570
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:48,053
Speaker 0: It changes the text to some lighter color no matter what the text was.

571
00:41:48,354 --> 00:41:50,723
Speaker 0: it changes the font to something else Whatever it was.

572
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:53,253
Speaker 0: so I can just read the website whatever information.

573
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:57,558
Speaker 0: there was a lot of websites I block images from just because I don't want to not even ads.

574
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,434
Speaker 0: I just don't want to deal with whatever formatting or something clever.

575
00:42:00,454 --> 00:42:03,600
Speaker 1: They decided to do well You're real broad brush of their ad block.

576
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:09,020
Speaker 1: Oh, you'll like go to a website, and if there's like one ad you'll say block every single image this website ever loads.

577
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,887
Speaker 0: Well not from the website, but from the if.

578
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:11,028
Speaker 0: the.

579
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:22,264
Speaker 0: if I see a domain and an ad came from that domain I'll block that domain at the second highest level Because I the thing is very few websites other than art websites have pictures I want to see.

580
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:24,340
Speaker 0: I mean I guess Fark has the icons.

581
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,049
Speaker 0: But even then if I block all images from Fark There's text that says exactly what the icon said.

582
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:34,478
Speaker 1: so I don't really need those images not really, but without them It's sort of more painful to browse a little.

583
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,386
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, it's a little easier on the eyes.

584
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:43,514
Speaker 0: now a lot of people have tried to argue with me that I'm denying revenue to people But in the end I'm actually saving the advertisers.

585
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:47,268
Speaker 1: because yeah, you got to think about it We're not screwing over who we screwing over here.

586
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:50,980
Speaker 1: We're screwing over some guy who's screwing over an advertiser.

587
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:52,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I don't I will say this right now.

588
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,453
Speaker 0: I've never in my life followed an ad on the internet with the intention of Purchasing a product or even considering a product.

589
00:43:01,096 --> 00:43:09,302
Speaker 0: I have to specifically decided never to purchase products that might otherwise have been a good product because I disagreed with the methods of advertising like the X can.

590
00:43:09,383 --> 00:43:15,406
Speaker 0: the x10 camera was a cool little product, but they Started the trend of annoying ads.

591
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:24,777
Speaker 0: they were the most annoying ads I'd ever run into and even though I kind of wanted their product Refused to ever do business with that company because of the horrible things they did to the internet.

592
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:28,759
Speaker 1: yep And they will forever be famous for spending too much money on it.

593
00:43:29,081 --> 00:43:36,132
Speaker 0: So me not seeing your ads is a good thing for you as an advertiser Because I will probably like your product less if I see an ad for it.

594
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:41,813
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when you really think about it Right you've got let's say coca-cola wants to put ads on dig.

595
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:42,154
Speaker 1: right.

596
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:52,656
Speaker 1: if I block ads Well that means that coca-cola will not give money to dig Because dig didn't play the ad to me which is good for coca-cola.

597
00:43:52,677 --> 00:43:55,912
Speaker 1: if I look at the ad and I'm not good.

598
00:43:55,953 --> 00:43:56,556
Speaker 1: I don't care.

599
00:43:56,576 --> 00:44:04,060
Speaker 1: now I hate coca-cola, and I'm hating dig and etcetera etcetera and coca-cola has to give dig money.

600
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:07,960
Speaker 1: So really in that situation in which I don't block the ad.

601
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:11,710
Speaker 1: Dig gets screwed and coke gets screwed.

602
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:14,200
Speaker 1: well dig gets money and coke gets screwed.

603
00:44:14,643 --> 00:44:21,034
Speaker 0: Someone always gets screwed because yeah I can't imagine many people who actually follow ads on the internet with the intention of purchasing products.

604
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:22,218
Speaker 1: I don't know.

605
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:31,839
Speaker 1: it happens Occasionally very rarely like I'll search for something on Google like usually when I'm looking to buy something You know like I want to buy a product where can I find it?

606
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:43,212
Speaker 1: and then I'll search on Google for the product and either frugal will take me to the product page or The goo like it's something that's kind of difficult to find an online store for.

607
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:50,198
Speaker 1: it's like huh who online sells this kind of shit Yep, and then there'll be an ad for it on Google in the search.

608
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,490
Speaker 0: to me That's different because it's pull instead of push.

609
00:44:52,993 --> 00:44:59,279
Speaker 0: if I see an ad for a product I'm generally going to dislike that product or that company because they had the audacity to try to advertise to me.

610
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:03,418
Speaker 0: But if I require a good or service I will seek it out.

611
00:45:04,303 --> 00:45:07,200
Speaker 0: And if I decide to seek something out I'm gonna do all the requisite research.

612
00:45:07,522 --> 00:45:23,260
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find the product I want and then I'm going to purchase it Like car ads annoying me more than anything in the world because if you are ever Influenced in your purchase of a car or a vehicle because you saw an ad for one That's really you got ripped off.

613
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:28,120
Speaker 1: Well, you know this could be in a very very small chance.

614
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,299
Speaker 1: You didn't know well that the car that you saw an ad for was the right car for you.

615
00:45:32,966 --> 00:45:34,080
Speaker 1: There's a small chance of it.

616
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,725
Speaker 0: But if you're gonna buy a car you do research as to what cars exist in your price range And then you choose one accordingly.

617
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:41,049
Speaker 0: you you should be.

618
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:48,899
Speaker 0: you should be able to on your own find all the cars that exist in Your price range without having ads telling you they exist even when you're not trying to buy a car.

619
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:55,853
Speaker 1: Well the point of car ads is to trick stupid people into thinking that X car is cool Whether that car is in the price range or not.

620
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:58,406
Speaker 0: a reason I bring them up And I wish I could remember the article in.

621
00:45:58,426 --> 00:46:05,877
Speaker 0: but I read somewhere that pretty much the primary driver In what in North American advertising is car ads like.

622
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:09,275
Speaker 1: far and away There are more car ads than pretty much every other kind of ad.

623
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:16,020
Speaker 1: yeah on the internet It's like our ads on the radio on television and then who knows yes current soda and fast food.

624
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:20,080
Speaker 0: But the article claimed that car ads were not just number one, but we're far and away number one.

625
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,593
Speaker 1: They're incredibly number one like by a trillion.

626
00:46:22,895 --> 00:46:27,819
Speaker 0: Yeah granted I wouldn't know that unless I read the article because I you know don't see ads.

627
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:31,399
Speaker 1: Well I would have known because they used to see ads but not watching TV.

628
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:32,806
Speaker 1: I don't see him anymore.

629
00:46:33,047 --> 00:46:33,148
Speaker 1: Well.

630
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:35,560
Speaker 0: You know what a lot of people block ads on the TV, too.

631
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,369
Speaker 0: It's called TiVo or YouTube those things.

632
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:38,850
Speaker 1: I don't know.

633
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,097
Speaker 1: do DVR is still successfully block ads?

634
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:45,440
Speaker 0: uh yeah But basically you have to do it manually, but you can always skip or fast-forward through the ads.

635
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,283
Speaker 1: So there's no more.

636
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:50,417
Speaker 1: there isn't a DVR available anymore that automatically skips ads like they used to.

637
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:51,340
Speaker 0: I don't know.

638
00:46:51,421 --> 00:46:58,740
Speaker 0: We I used to have when I was a kid a VCR That if you told it to record it would figure out where the ads were in a show and wouldn't record them.

639
00:46:59,322 --> 00:47:02,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder does myth TV still skip the ads it must write?

640
00:47:02,815 --> 00:47:03,377
Speaker 0: not odd.

641
00:47:03,618 --> 00:47:03,919
Speaker 0: I assume.

642
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:04,509
Speaker 0: so I don't know.

643
00:47:04,694 --> 00:47:06,445
Speaker 1: yeah I got I kind of research on the see.

644
00:47:06,466 --> 00:47:11,820
Speaker 0: the thing is all those things like myth TV and DVRs were made totally obsolete to Me by YouTube and BitTorrent.

645
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:14,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate to say it.

646
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:19,216
Speaker 1: Oh well I guess If I had a lot of monies honestly that.

647
00:47:19,296 --> 00:47:22,979
Speaker 0: and Netflix Yeah between those three I have no reason to ever get something off a TV.

648
00:47:23,403 --> 00:47:28,457
Speaker 1: Well if I did have a lot of money Then there would be no reason not to get TV or a dish or something.

649
00:47:28,497 --> 00:47:31,674
Speaker 1: and then I could watch Hockey's and f1, but if I had a lot of money.

650
00:47:31,694 --> 00:47:37,288
Speaker 1: I just go to hockey games live Yeah, that too, but at the same time You know there's more on TV.

651
00:47:37,308 --> 00:47:39,900
Speaker 1: You know you can't what if you can't go to the Stanley Cup finals the faraway?

652
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,766
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that.

653
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:41,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

654
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:46,000
Speaker 1: playoff games You know go watch the away games of your favorite team because you go to all the home games.

655
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:59,799
Speaker 0: But at least on websites it is absolutely trivial to block 90% maybe 95% of all the ads that you will ever be encountered with with Firefox adblock and filter set G And you have no reason to feel bad about screwing the website that you're.

656
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:03,020
Speaker 1: no You know what because you're helping out the person who bought the edge.

657
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:14,042
Speaker 0: You can choose who you want to get screwed because you can tell adblock to not load the ads at all or to Download them and just not show them to you Mm-hmm.

658
00:48:14,162 --> 00:48:18,458
Speaker 0: so you can choose if you want the advertiser to think your ad was shown or not.

659
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:24,400
Speaker 1: Usually they get paid by clicking though these days and not by showing so much.

660
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of people still go by impressions or at least they they track impression.

661
00:48:28,775 --> 00:48:31,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely track everything They can and if they're going by click.

662
00:48:31,846 --> 00:48:34,075
Speaker 0: It's not like you were gonna click on the ad anyway mm-hmm.

663
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,351
Speaker 1: Oh well Ads on the internet are crazy.

664
00:48:38,492 --> 00:48:39,580
Speaker 1: They've come a long way.

665
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:44,647
Speaker 1: They're still crazy, but now we don't have to look at them Now as one final quick metabit.

666
00:48:44,687 --> 00:48:59,538
Speaker 0: I'd like to point out to all of our listeners particularly the 38% of you who aren't using the feed who are downloading the mp3s for geek nights Manually from the website every single day, and there are a lot of you.

667
00:48:59,558 --> 00:49:02,831
Speaker 1: yeah now There's nothing wrong with listening to the show that way that's cool.

668
00:49:03,172 --> 00:49:04,096
Speaker 1: You're listening to the show.

669
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:04,658
Speaker 1: We're happy.

670
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:07,728
Speaker 1: however There's a better way.

671
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:08,694
Speaker 1: There is a better way.

672
00:49:08,774 --> 00:49:11,846
Speaker 1: subscribing is Beneficial to you.

673
00:49:12,047 --> 00:49:18,200
Speaker 0: now one and we didn't even realize this until someone pointed out But the feed has all the information about the episodes.

674
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:34,319
Speaker 0: You know the title what it's about the track all that stuff is in there mm-hmm And if you just download it manually the id3 just contains You know the date information like when it was put out and when it came and what season it is and all that It doesn't have the titles.

675
00:49:34,922 --> 00:49:39,660
Speaker 0: And we never noticed that because most people use the feed and some sort of feed pod catcher thing.

676
00:49:40,362 --> 00:49:50,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even if you don't have iTunes and an iPod or an mp3 player at all there are pod catching softwares you can use like juice receiver and Doppler and it'll

677
00:49:50,984 --> 00:49:57,800
Speaker 0: make your listening experience a lot better at least if you're listening on a daily basis if you're going through the archives You're probably better off going to the website.

678
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:11,180
Speaker 1: Yeah But if you're someone who listens to the new geek nights every day or once a week if you're you know just don't listen to Tuesday or just Monday or something like that you should probably start using a subscribing pod catching software of some sort.

679
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:11,412
Speaker 1: Yep

680
00:50:11,702 --> 00:50:25,080
Speaker 0: Though for all of you who continue to download Directly from the website which I just realized one reason for at least some of that is that the feed only has the most recent 100 episodes so there are about a hundred and twenty hundred and thirty episodes that aren't in the feed.

681
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,738
Speaker 1: Hey, you want to know a secret trick?

682
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:37,956
Speaker 1: Instead of subscribing to the you know all geek nights feed if you subscribe to the Monday feed the Tuesday feed The Wednesday feed and the Thursday feed you'll get the past 400 episodes.

683
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:48,900
Speaker 0: basically yes You'll get the past 100 Mondays 100 Tuesdays hundred Wednesdays hundred Thursdays and when those fall off I guess in the far future will probably make archival feeds per season just for iTunes ease of use.

684
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:50,160
Speaker 0: But for now you got to use the website.

685
00:50:50,884 --> 00:50:58,360
Speaker 0: so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna fiddle around with ID threes and Come up with an automated way to put some of that information in the ID 3.

686
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,857
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably just write a little script that uses the ID 3 program or whatever.

687
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:04,105
Speaker 0: yeah So changes are coming.

688
00:51:04,607 --> 00:51:08,840
Speaker 0: if you're downloading the podcast manually at least look into getting a feed catcher.

689
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:10,928
Speaker 1: You don't have to but try it out.

690
00:51:10,968 --> 00:51:12,955
Speaker 1: You might not realize what you're missing.

691
00:51:13,056 --> 00:51:14,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no benefit to us.

692
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:15,795
Speaker 0: We don't care, but it'll help you out.

693
00:51:16,017 --> 00:51:25,168
Speaker 0: Yeah This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

694
00:51:25,188 --> 00:51:27,374
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.

696
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:45,459
