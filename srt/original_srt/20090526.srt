1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,489
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 26th.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,192
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:12,815
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,000
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,360
Speaker 1: We're back from Anime Boston, and we talk about two board games, Oshii and Tsuru.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:42,206
Speaker 0: So I woke up this morning, and the sun was coming in the windows, and like, I was feeling pretty awake, and it was, you know, I heard stuff going on outside, and I was like, "Oh, what time is

8
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:42,266
Speaker 0: it?".

9
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:44,154
Speaker 0: It's probably like six something, right?

10
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:45,740
Speaker 0: I'll get get up and get ready, right?

11
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:47,985
Speaker 0: So I look at the iPhone.

12
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:52,540
Speaker 1: All right, it was either way earlier than you expected or way later.

13
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:58,976
Speaker 0: It was 5 30, but it felt like 6 30, so I was like, "Spring ahead, fall

14
00:00:59,037 --> 00:00:59,478
Speaker 0: back.".

15
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:00,260
Speaker 1: It's not that day.

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,002
Speaker 0: It's not that.

17
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:01,804
Speaker 0: I'm like, "What the

18
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:02,246
Speaker 0: fuck?".

19
00:01:02,366 --> 00:01:09,600
Speaker 0: And it was literally 5 30, but it felt like 6 30, which can only mean, I don't know, but I felt awake, and it was sort of fucked up.

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,940
Speaker 1: Were you traveling at the speed of light?

21
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:13,778
Speaker 0: Not this again, yeah.

22
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:21,720
Speaker 0: It may have been, and it was weird because I went to bed kind of late after playing some Awesome Left 4 Dead last night, so I don't know what was up with that.

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did, because I came home and went straight to bed, because I was wrecked from the con, and I couldn't even talk.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,035
Speaker 0: You know, midnight-ish.

25
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:32,199
Speaker 0: So to only sleep five and a half hours, to feel really awake.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,700
Speaker 0: You know, every now and then, though.

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,974
Speaker 0: And for it to look like 6 30 outside.

28
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,360
Speaker 1: Every now and then, like, it's weird.

29
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,020
Speaker 1: I'll have certain, I used to call them, like, magic nights.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,180
Speaker 1: Like, sometimes you stay up.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,618
Speaker 0: Magic night.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,523
Speaker 1: Magic night, right here.

33
00:01:42,684 --> 00:01:51,200
Speaker 1: You stay up way late, or you're tired, or it's one of those nights where you really want to be well-rested the next day, and you know you're not going to be, but for some reason, the night lasts forever.

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:02:01,580
Speaker 1: Like, you fall asleep, and you kind of, like, wake up, and you feel like you've slept for a whole night, and it's only been, like, a half hour, and you go, "Ahh," and go back to bed.

35
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:21,200
Speaker 0: Well, see, I think it may have had something to do with the fact, right, that the previous night, you know, I guess, I woke up on Monday at, like, 9 something, which is, like, for the past long time, when I've, you know, had a chance to sleep as much as I wanted, I've always woken up at, like, 8 something, you know?

36
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:28,360
Speaker 0: So, to wake up at 9 was weird, and I think, you know, that was probably because we had just returned from the Anime Boston.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,840
Speaker 1: Not just that, but Anime Boston, we, I don't know, we handled it differently from the way we've handled most conventions we've been to in recent memory.

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,380
Speaker 0: Well, whenever we go without a whole bunch of people, it's always different.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,420
Speaker 1: It felt a lot more like PAX, partly because the convention center is almost, like, very similar to the one in Seattle.

40
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:45,980
Speaker 0: Oh, with the escalators, yeah.

41
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,179
Speaker 1: With, like, the middle column of escalators, and the multi-levels, and the...

42
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:49,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the back walls.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,299
Speaker 1: And the separate building with the gaming in it.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should, like, you know how they study, like, you know, there's different designers of stadiums, and there's different designers of golf courses, and designers of racetracks.

45
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,873
Speaker 0: There's probably designers of convention centers.

46
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:02,799
Speaker 0: We should find out who they are.

47
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,880
Speaker 1: Their names were all on the wall by the open of the front.

48
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,065
Speaker 0: Oh, we gotta look at that shit.

49
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:09,700
Speaker 0: They're probably just, like, you know, it's important, like, looking at rollercoaster designers.

50
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,302
Speaker 1: It was cool.

51
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:15,520
Speaker 1: It was this old, like, marble, you know, cast thing with, like, everything carved into it, like, the names of all the architects.

52
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,060
Speaker 0: Sure, it didn't just say, like, mayor of Boston, and governor who provided the money.

53
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:30,220
Speaker 1: I'm sure, because it listed the architects, and the designers, and all these people, and at the bottom, carved into marble, it said HVAC, and then the name of the company that did the HVAC.

54
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,620
Speaker 0: You know, I should get myself a freaking chisel.

55
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,820
Speaker 1: For a second, no, I looked at the bottom, and I was, like, H. The fuck number is H.

56
00:03:37,744 --> 00:03:38,740
Speaker 0: Oh, you were looking for the Roman numerals.

57
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,459
Speaker 1: And then I was, like, oh.

58
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:50,800
Speaker 0: I should get a chisel, and learn how to chisel the way that, you know, those things are done, and get mad skilled at it, and then, like, chisel my name into things in a way that no one will recognize that it's out of place.

59
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,234
Speaker 1: That is very similar to one of my favorite pranks of all time.

60
00:03:54,254 --> 00:03:55,480
Speaker 1: This guy went into a mall, right?

61
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:55,750
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:56,141 --> 00:04:04,860
Speaker 1: And it had, like, they had this restaurant, like, one of those mall restaurants, and the sign had, like, these bronze, like, an apple, and a banana, and some grapes, like, around the side.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,420
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,860
Speaker 1: So we went in at night.

65
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,239
Speaker 0: Oh, and he added a different fruit, yeah.

66
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,400
Speaker 1: He took out the banana, and he put, like, a watermelon, and then he kept changing the fruits, like, every month, and eventually someone noticed.

67
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:16,225
Speaker 0: Oh.

68
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,875
Speaker 1: I gotta find that and make it a thing of the day.

69
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:19,420
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,202
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

71
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,660
Speaker 0: But yeah, we will talk about Anime Boston more tomorrow.

72
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:28,360
Speaker 1: Welcome, welcome, welcome to, uh, Cake Nights, not Zombocom.

73
00:04:28,763 --> 00:04:29,219
Speaker 0: No, not Zombocom.

74
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,964
Speaker 1: All the people we met in Anime Boston.

75
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:31,926
Speaker 1: I know there were a ton of you.

76
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,212
Speaker 1: Tomorrow night is Wednesday night.

77
00:04:34,252 --> 00:04:37,840
Speaker 1: We talk about anime and all that stuff, and we will have coverage of Anime Boston.

78
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,510
Speaker 1: We will also have uploaded the slides from Cover Your Bases, aka Anime.

79
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 1: You Should See, and Know Your Creators, because a lot of you were asking for them.

80
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,212
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

81
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:53,159
Speaker 1: But tonight is not Wednesday, it is Tuesday, and we're talking not about anime, but about video games.

82
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:56,380
Speaker 0: That's alright, because there were lots of games going on in Anime Boston.

83
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:56,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,435
Speaker 0: So, if you're in Anime Boston, you're probably a gamer type.

85
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:01,460
Speaker 0: I hope so, anyway.

86
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,740
Speaker 1: In fact, I was very proud of those punk kids that we played Magic with.

87
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,066
Speaker 0: We didn't play Magic with them.

88
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,594
Speaker 0: They were playing Magic.

89
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:09,680
Speaker 0: We played Blockus with them.

90
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,063
Speaker 1: They wanted to play Magic.

91
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:18,440
Speaker 1: They had their Magic cards, and we tricked them into playing Blockus, and they proved that some punk kids who play Magic can also appreciate a real game.

92
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:22,012
Speaker 0: I like how one of the kids had played it in math class, and he thought it was cool.

93
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:23,417
Speaker 0: You know that's nerds right there.

94
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:24,180
Speaker 0: There's no way.

95
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,440
Speaker 1: Those kids were exactly like I was when I was 14.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,047
Speaker 0: Yep, that's what I was gonna say.

97
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,296
Speaker 0: It was like, "Wow, you're me when I was 14,

98
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:31,397
Speaker 0: kid.".

99
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,380
Speaker 0: However, I cannot- Look into our future!

100
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:39,400
Speaker 1: I cannot any more tell what age anyone younger than me is.

101
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:39,920
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,413
Speaker 0: So, for all I know, they were anywhere between- It was pretty much high school and middle school.

103
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:44,180
Speaker 0: That's all I can tell.

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,540
Speaker 1: They were anywhere between 11 and 18, as far as I was concerned.

105
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:50,639
Speaker 0: I can tell high school or middle school usually, and that's about it.

106
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,420
Speaker 1: The thing that really strikes me is you ever go into an elementary school, go to the second grade room, and you look at those desks, and they're like the size of your shoes.

107
00:05:58,841 --> 00:05:59,277
Speaker 0: I know, right?

108
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:01,600
Speaker 0: Okay.

109
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,208
Speaker 1: So, there is actually- You ever sit on a school bus?

110
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:11,720
Speaker 0: I sat on one recently, because last year they were using it to shuttle you from the parking lot to the giant stadium.

111
00:06:12,743 --> 00:06:17,280
Speaker 1: Scott, you, me, and Emily went to a Mets game, and we took a school bus from the parking lot.

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,299
Speaker 0: It was better than the giant stadium one.

113
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,176
Speaker 0: Yeah.

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:29,620
Speaker 1: Well, when I used to be living in Poquay, they shut down all the trains for some construction, so they would take me from Southeast up to Poquay in a school bus.

115
00:06:32,545 --> 00:06:33,760
Speaker 0: Not like a normal city bus?

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,838
Speaker 1: No, it was like a school bus.

117
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:42,637
Speaker 1: So, it'd be like me and all these fancily dressed people who went into the city to see a show, and they'd just be sitting on the bus like, "Oh, I'll choir into

118
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:42,799
Speaker 1: funds.".

119
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:45,479
Speaker 0: All right.

120
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:53,720
Speaker 1: So, Starfy, one of the few games, I don't know, in a long time I've for some ungodly reason been excited about.

121
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I really like puzzle platforming games, and it seems like what Starfy is, right?

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,300
Speaker 1: Starfy also has that kind of curvy feel to it, just the graphic design, but a little bit of Mega Man.

123
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:12,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, and I got, you know, a Henry Hatsworth puzzling adventure, and that is, I assumed it was going to be a puzzle platformer, but a puzzle platformer it is not.

124
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 0: It is a puzzler and a platformer that are barely attached at the hip, that are not merged.

125
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,940
Speaker 1: Way back when we saw videos of Starfy, which is properly known as Densetsu no Starfy, Taiketsu, Daru, Kaizo Dukan.

126
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,240
Speaker 0: Even a cute game.

127
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,538
Speaker 1: Kaizo Kudan.

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,020
Speaker 0: Even a cute game in Japanese can be made to sound non-cute if you don't know what it means and you say it in a Yakuza voice.

129
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,540
Speaker 1: I don't know, though, because the translation is Legendary Starfy Confrontation, Dire Pirate Squad.

130
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,250
Speaker 1: Really?

131
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,979
Speaker 0: Maybe it's supposed to sound all Yakuza.

132
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,660
Speaker 1: But watch the video if you don't know what we're talking about.

133
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,980
Speaker 1: This game looks pretty badass, I guess.

134
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,896
Speaker 0: So a game is coming out, that's the news?

135
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,780
Speaker 1: We assumed, everyone who saw these videos immediately assumed, yeah, that game's never going to be in the US.

136
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:02,660
Speaker 1: This is a game we're going to have to import.

137
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,979
Speaker 0: I didn't even know about it until they announced it was coming in the US.

138
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,400
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I saw videos of it way back, and I just felt, oh, we're never going to see this.

139
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,878
Speaker 1: It is actually coming out in the second week in June, June 7th.

140
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:15,639
Speaker 0: Oh, it's actually really soon.

141
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:31,040
Speaker 1: But the story here, what I find interesting, is that according to Kotaku, themselves, according to Hitoshi Yamagami, who is the producer of the game, said that the game was not going to come out in America, despite the fact that the developers really wanted it to.

142
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,460
Speaker 1: They wanted it to be overseas.

143
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,479
Speaker 1: But Nintendo of America said it was, quote, "too Japanese," unquote, and vetoed it.

144
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:44,720
Speaker 1: So I don't know what circumstance caused this game to come out in America anyway, but I'm excited.

145
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,920
Speaker 0: Well, here is my guess.

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,900
Speaker 0: Number one, Nintendo of Japan overrules Nintendo of America, because it's the boss versus the worker, right?

147
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:01,920
Speaker 1: Well, now, Nintendo of America seemed to have a lot more say a long time ago, in the NES days, with all the censorship and whatnot.

148
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,920
Speaker 0: Really, Nintendo of America, first of all, remember, they sort of closed out, and they moved all the people, they shrunk the office and everything.

149
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,840
Speaker 0: And basically, all they really do is sell the stuff the Japanese people make in the US.

150
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,180
Speaker 0: And they also do the adaptations and those sorts of things, but they don't really make anything.

151
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,500
Speaker 1: Well, remember Square versus Squaresoft?

152
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:24,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know, right?

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,999
Speaker 0: The thing is, being in America, we think about Nintendo of America as if they do more, but really, they don't make, do they?

154
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:33,699
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they don't make any games.

155
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,374
Speaker 1: I'm not actually 100% sure, to be honest.

156
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:45,779
Speaker 0: Anyway, so also, I think what happened here is, number one, it's a case where the Japanese and the Americans are both right, right?

157
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,660
Speaker 0: Japanese Nintendo was right.

158
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:52,400
Speaker 0: If I had Reggie's job, I could have sold Starfy and made it a big hit.

159
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,198
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,720
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, Nintendo of America is right.

161
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:06,580
Speaker 0: Starfy is probably not going to sell very well, because they're not going to do what I would do, which is be really risky and push it real hard to the right demographics in the right way.

162
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,120
Speaker 1: Of course, then again, look at what Nintendo did with the first Layton.

163
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,140
Speaker 1: They pushed that at anime and gaming conventions as hard as they could.

164
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Speaker 0: Wrong choice.

165
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,497
Speaker 1: All right, who do you push that at?

166
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:17,416
Speaker 0: My mom.

167
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,258
Speaker 1: So how do you market that to your mom?

168
00:10:21,941 --> 00:10:24,339
Speaker 0: Lots of money, put it on the daytime soaps.

169
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,879
Speaker 1: Your mom watches daytime soaps?

170
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,178
Speaker 0: No, but some other moms do.

171
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,878
Speaker 1: So how do you get your mom, the mom who's going to like this, as opposed to your daytime soap mom?

172
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:33,799
Speaker 0: Involve longer burger baskets in some way.

173
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:38,180
Speaker 0: My mom collects these stupid baskets.

174
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,217
Speaker 1: What are these baskets?

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,840
Speaker 0: I'm not going to explain the longer burger basket.

176
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,180
Speaker 0: You can go look it up on Wikipedia.

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,400
Speaker 1: Wait, as in a burger that's long?

178
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,120
Speaker 0: No, that's just the name of the company.

179
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,800
Speaker 1: But longer burger?

180
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,419
Speaker 0: That's correct.

181
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,780
Speaker 1: Is that just a hot dog?

182
00:10:53,001 --> 00:10:54,275
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's B-E-R-G-E-R.

183
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,679
Speaker 1: What if you made a hot dog?

184
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,879
Speaker 1: If you just rolled up a hamburger into the shape of a hot dog, cook that and put it on a hot dog bun.

185
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,658
Speaker 0: My mom might think it was a funny joke if you called it a longer burger, but that's about it.

186
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,715
Speaker 1: I would probably eat it.

187
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,038
Speaker 0: I would also eat it.

188
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,178
Speaker 1: Starfies coming out in the US.

189
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,799
Speaker 1: I'm going to tell you all to buy the game, but I don't know if it'll be good.

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:15,891
Speaker 0: Yeah.

191
00:11:17,264 --> 00:11:19,220
Speaker 0: If you don't know if the game's going to be good, right?

192
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,760
Speaker 0: It's a platformer, so you probably don't need to know so much Japanese.

193
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,600
Speaker 0: You could probably pirate it and test it out and not buy it at all.

194
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,300
Speaker 1: Not longer burger, it's longa burger.

195
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:30,093
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

196
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:30,852
Speaker 0: Okay.

197
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:31,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

198
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:34,399
Speaker 1: Oh, I see what they do here.

199
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,999
Speaker 1: Your mom is basically a member of a cult.

200
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

201
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,460
Speaker 0: They have a big factory shaped like a basket.

202
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:40,875
Speaker 1: Yes.

203
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:44,080
Speaker 0: The thing is she only went to the basket factory like once or twice.

204
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,120
Speaker 0: She has a friend who's even more crazy that goes to the basket factory and like an annual pilgrimage.

205
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,678
Speaker 1: These are just beanie babies.

206
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,695
Speaker 0: Pretty much, yeah.

207
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,359
Speaker 0: Except she actually uses the baskets.

208
00:11:54,263 --> 00:11:56,460
Speaker 1: They set you up just like Tupperware.

209
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:57,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

210
00:11:57,881 --> 00:11:58,436
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

211
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,120
Speaker 0: She uses like, she's got one bag.

212
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,119
Speaker 0: She's the thing is, right?

213
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,420
Speaker 0: She uses the baskets.

214
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,239
Speaker 0: She actually uses them, which is good, right?

215
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,800
Speaker 0: But it's bad because like one basket could serve.

216
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:12,800
Speaker 1: If I host a longer burger basket event, I will get 500 longer burger dollars.

217
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:13,498
Speaker 0: Yeah.

218
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:17,880
Speaker 1: And I don't host his dollars and free shipping and handling and bonus offers.

219
00:12:18,123 --> 00:12:18,336
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

220
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:19,778
Speaker 1: Good gobs.

221
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,900
Speaker 0: But if you, I'm not collecting the baskets.

222
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,776
Speaker 0: What are you looking at me?

223
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,780
Speaker 0: She's got a different basket for each thing.

224
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,718
Speaker 0: So she has a specific basket for candy corn on Halloween and another specific basket, like for...

225
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,140
Speaker 1: Scott, there are baskets that are the shapes of all pre-existing bowls.

226
00:12:39,522 --> 00:12:43,340
Speaker 1: And you take the bowl you have and put it in the basket.

227
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:43,820
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

228
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:44,311
Speaker 0: Why?

229
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:47,318
Speaker 0: Don't ask me why.

230
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,779
Speaker 1: The bowl already serves the purpose.

231
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,140
Speaker 0: What are you asking me for?

232
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:50,979
Speaker 0: I agree with you.

233
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,900
Speaker 0: I'm not wasting my money on baskets.

234
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,319
Speaker 1: I can design my own basket.

235
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can also, if you go there, you can make your own basket.

236
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,759
Speaker 1: I'm making my own basket right now.

237
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,438
Speaker 1: So what's your news?

238
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,540
Speaker 0: So my news is also a similar...

239
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:03,560
Speaker 1: Oh, it's going to be a berry basket.

240
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 0: It's a similar US to Japan situation.

241
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:16,260
Speaker 0: A game that really no one ever expected to come out in the US is probably coming out in the US, the Tatsunoko versus Capcom.

242
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:17,300
Speaker 0: Yeah.

243
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,040
Speaker 1: That's really coming out in the US?

244
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

245
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:21,000
Speaker 1: I can't act surprised.

246
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:23,000
Speaker 1: This was mentioned at Anime Boston.

247
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:28,060
Speaker 0: So I think this is important for two reasons.

248
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,440
Speaker 0: Number one, it shows that Capcom is still the company that knows what's up.

249
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:40,760
Speaker 0: They got on top of their game a while ago when they made Mega Man 9 and Bionic Commander Rearmed, and they are still on top.

250
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,740
Speaker 0: Capcom is still sitting in the number one game maker's seat for the time being.

251
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,020
Speaker 1: Oh, I can add a paw print to my basket.

252
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,560
Speaker 1: And number two, I'm a hockey player.

253
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,740
Speaker 1: There's a hockey player right there.

254
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:56,720
Speaker 0: Number two, that's for carrying the pucks out onto the ice and off the ice after practice.

255
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:07,240
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure there was not a battle between Capcom, Japan, and if they have a separate US branch over whether or not to bring it out here.

256
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:16,740
Speaker 0: But I wonder, right, you know, this game will probably sell really well with the people who care about this sort of thing and perhaps also with some fighting game fans.

257
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:20,860
Speaker 0: But I mean, really, what kind of sales do they think this is going to have?

258
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,779
Speaker 0: People like Tatsunoko, what the fuck?

259
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:32,834
Speaker 0: All those sorts of games that sold well in the US were the Marvel versus Capcom or, you know, the ones where people are X, you know, the ones that were.

260
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:38,000
Speaker 0: people knew the characters when they tried to bring over like, you know, SNK versus Capcom.

261
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,180
Speaker 0: Only fighting game fanboys bought.

262
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,798
Speaker 1: Yes, but maybe they realize maybe they're doing the same thing that superhero comics in the US do.

263
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,560
Speaker 1: They know that they have a fairly large, insane fan base.

264
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:58,700
Speaker 1: I mean, the people who play SNK versus whatever and are good at it and play all those games, they will buy any of those games, especially because they're going to play in the tournaments.

265
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:03,620
Speaker 1: And you know that the convention circuit now is going to have this game be like the tournament.

266
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,900
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if you look at it, though, in the way I just described, you got to think, A Capcom versus SNK, I guess it did well enough, right?

267
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,020
Speaker 0: Sold to only the fighting game fanboys.

268
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,700
Speaker 0: This will sell to fighting game fanboys and anime fanboys.

269
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:18,188
Speaker 0: Double play.

270
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,719
Speaker 0: It's not going to be huge, but that's better than right.

271
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:23,940
Speaker 0: Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.

272
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,034
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

273
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,000
Speaker 0: Right.

274
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,800
Speaker 0: They don't just make Capcom versus SNK versus Marvel versus Tatsunoko.

275
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,739
Speaker 1: Why not?

276
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,280
Speaker 1: They will.

277
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,860
Speaker 0: Why don't they just do it?

278
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,536
Speaker 1: Here's the way to do it.

279
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:36,160
Speaker 0: There should be a million.

280
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,740
Speaker 0: There should be like 100 screens full of characters that no one can even figure it out.

281
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:48,259
Speaker 1: That's how I make one game and sell it once when you can break that into 10 games and I'll tell you why.

282
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,218
Speaker 0: I will tell you why.

283
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,258
Speaker 0: Here's what they should do.

284
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:55,280
Speaker 0: I have if my idea was the idea to make things the best possible way for the fan.

285
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,159
Speaker 1: Wait, because I have an idea.

286
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,875
Speaker 1: Are you ready for it?

287
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:57,672
Speaker 1: Modularly.

288
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:04,620
Speaker 0: I was about to tell you the way to make the most money is to sell a fighting game that only has the Street Fighter two characters.

289
00:16:04,988 --> 00:16:05,260
Speaker 0: Right.

290
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:14,160
Speaker 0: And then sell packs of 10 characters for like five dollars and everyone has to download all the packs or five bucks each.

291
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:14,979
Speaker 1: You got to rate it.

292
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,000
Speaker 1: You got to rank the prices differently.

293
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,980
Speaker 1: For example, much like you could probably sell a guitar.

294
00:16:20,341 --> 00:16:22,359
Speaker 0: It costs ten dollars to get the characters who are cheap.

295
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,651
Speaker 1: Much like you could sell one dollar to get the losers.

296
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,079
Speaker 1: No one likes you make of all equally powerful or you sell like Dolly outfits for him too.

297
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:37,918
Speaker 1: But much like you could sell Guitar Hero Stairway Edition for like fifty bucks on its own and people would probably buy it.

298
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:40,338
Speaker 1: You sell Wolverine for ten bucks by himself.

299
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:45,379
Speaker 1: No, but then for another dollar for another dollar, you get the clause.

300
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:48,080
Speaker 0: All right.

301
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think I think that's taken a little bit too far.

302
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,439
Speaker 0: But yeah, the obvious way to make the most money is to sell just like Street Fighter two and then so all these character packs actually put it on the Street Fighter four engine.

303
00:16:58,604 --> 00:16:59,096
Speaker 0: That would do it.

304
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:00,780
Speaker 0: Street Fighter four engine.

305
00:17:01,182 --> 00:17:04,359
Speaker 0: All the characters sell the characters and packs of 10 done.

306
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:04,979
Speaker 0: Big money.

307
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:05,797
Speaker 0: Capcom wins.

308
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:17,970
Speaker 1: But anyway, in things of the day, I've got a story from North America.

309
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,529
Speaker 0: No snaps.

310
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:24,329
Speaker 1: So at Anime Boston, we attended the much lauded Anime Hell.

311
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,410
Speaker 0: We had known about the Anime Hell for quite some time, but never attended.

312
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:28,910
Speaker 1: Not at least in fullness.

313
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:38,150
Speaker 1: But we went and it anime hell things like that in anime conventions are basically you go and people show you weird stuff that you've probably never seen before.

314
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:42,230
Speaker 1: And of course, this is a lot more difficult now that YouTube makes everything available.

315
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:48,390
Speaker 1: And yeah, I mean, there are a lot of people who try to do events like this, but you show up and those are all on CollegeHumor last week.

316
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:58,648
Speaker 0: I fully expected that most of the things would not be things I had seen, but I was actually, you know, even though I expected it, I was still surprised that I had not seen 90% of what I was shown.

317
00:17:58,971 --> 00:18:12,650
Speaker 1: But this animation far, far above and beyond anything I've seen in recent memory, partly because it was late, partly because it was unexpectedly bizarre, and partly because the song has just been stuck in my head since Anime Boston.

318
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,387
Speaker 1: Fuck this song.

319
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,488
Speaker 1: What if it did?

320
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,188
Speaker 1: What if it didn't?

321
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,350
Speaker 1: What if the world was made of pudding?

322
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:26,450
Speaker 1: This is indescribable and you all need to watch it and show it to other people.

323
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,889
Speaker 1: I warn you, the song will be stuck in your head.

324
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:38,650
Speaker 1: And two, I don't know, the body language, the posture, the way that that father enters that child's room is more frightening than anything I've ever seen.

325
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,190
Speaker 0: It's very aggressive.

326
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,629
Speaker 1: It's the most aggressive possible body posture.

327
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:43,688
Speaker 0: It reminds the dad.

328
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,190
Speaker 0: The style of the dad reminds me a lot of the Ren and Stimpy guy, Cricka Flusi.

329
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,789
Speaker 0: How do you, I don't even know how to say his name.

330
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:52,510
Speaker 0: Just look at the way he's standing in the room.

331
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,270
Speaker 1: It's like he's about to murder and rape the child.

332
00:18:54,911 --> 00:18:55,810
Speaker 0: What's your favorite part?

333
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:56,867
Speaker 1: I don't know.

334
00:18:57,211 --> 00:18:57,589
Speaker 1: What if he did?

335
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,202
Speaker 1: What if he didn't?

336
00:18:58,672 --> 00:18:59,909
Speaker 1: And when the spider kills the kid.

337
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,116
Speaker 0: When the spider, no, I like it.

338
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,250
Speaker 0: when the spider has like the knife to the kid's throat.

339
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:04,950
Speaker 1: That's a good part, but not as good.

340
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,590
Speaker 1: I think is when the spider just kills the kid with the poking in the face, just the stab in the eye.

341
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,390
Speaker 0: That's a good part too.

342
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:11,468
Speaker 0: All right.

343
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:12,590
Speaker 1: Just the song.

344
00:19:13,372 --> 00:19:15,429
Speaker 1: I listened to it last night before I went to sleep.

345
00:19:16,411 --> 00:19:21,110
Speaker 0: So I've been like, you know, I've been subscribing to video podcasts now with my iPhone.

346
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:25,350
Speaker 0: You know, I started with the Onion News video, which is far superior to the Onion News radio.

347
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,230
Speaker 0: And then I moved on to the, uh, the Ted talks, you know, which is, so now I can just watch all of them without having to go to the website or anything.

348
00:19:32,591 --> 00:19:36,450
Speaker 0: And actually, um, old Jews telling jokes has one now also.

349
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,210
Speaker 0: So I'm going to watch, I'm going to watch that.

350
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:43,050
Speaker 1: And also video podcasts that really, like it started petering out after the first several.

351
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,970
Speaker 0: Well, you know, everyone told all the good jokes right away, but there's a whole bunch I haven't seen yet.

352
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,009
Speaker 0: So I'm going to see if there's any gems in there and I will filter them out for you.

353
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,770
Speaker 1: It has to beat the dropkin fart.

354
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,169
Speaker 0: I don't know if we can beat the dropkin fart, but you can get close.

355
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,700
Speaker 0: Anyway, um, so there's a Ted talk.

356
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,709
Speaker 0: I watched today and I, you know, I think what happened to Ted, I think they just wanted to get so many speakers in that a lot of them are like doing shorter bits.

357
00:20:06,231 --> 00:20:13,590
Speaker 0: So this guy did like a three or four minute bit and you know, it didn't directly have anything to do with gaming whatsoever.

358
00:20:13,871 --> 00:20:22,610
Speaker 0: Well, neither did rims thing of the day, but I think this indirectly applies to things, uh, gaming related, at least things the way I think about them.

359
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:24,370
Speaker 0: And, uh, it's a bit of a stretch, but whatever.

360
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:33,450
Speaker 0: So in this video, this, uh, guy explains how they took these kids and they gave them, they're like four year olds, six year olds, whatever.

361
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:39,950
Speaker 0: And they gave them a marshmallow, but they told them, you're going to wait here with this marshmallow for 15 minutes and we're going to leave.

362
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:47,490
Speaker 0: And if we come back in 15 minutes and the marshmallow is still there, we will give you another marshmallow and then you will have two marshmallows.

363
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,070
Speaker 0: Right.

364
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,910
Speaker 0: And he explained how quite shockingly, right?

365
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,250
Speaker 0: Two out of three kids ate the marshmallow.

366
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:54,510
Speaker 1: Is it really that shocking?

367
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:56,309
Speaker 0: No, it's a four year old.

368
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,510
Speaker 0: The shocking part comes next.

369
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,383
Speaker 1: It's not even a five year old.

370
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:00,410
Speaker 0: shocking part comes next.

371
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,570
Speaker 1: It's not even at the point of the five year old.

372
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:07,570
Speaker 0: And one third of the kids sort of resisted the marshmallow and then got two marshmallows.

373
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:07,889
Speaker 0: Right.

374
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,370
Speaker 0: The shocking part is that they came back years later and found those same kids.

375
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,787
Speaker 0: Cause when you do a study on kids, you rattle the names down and then you can go find them later.

376
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:33,248
Speaker 0: So they found them later and they found out that, you know, 100%, 100%, that's the shocking number of the kids who resisted the marshmallow were successful by the general definition, you know, good grades in school, et cetera, et cetera.

377
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:46,407
Speaker 0: And not 100%, but a large percentage of the two thirds that did eat the marshmallow were not as successful by that general standard of good grades in school, money, jobs, et cetera, et cetera.

378
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:55,630
Speaker 1: The guy basically sums it up in the video as people who have the ability to delay gratification for a greater reward later will succeed almost universally.

379
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:06,870
Speaker 0: And the way this relates to gaming in my eyes, I may be stretching it, but whatever, because I'm curious where you're going to go with this because there's the, I guess what road I'm going down.

380
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,010
Speaker 1: Well, there are two roads to go down.

381
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:16,270
Speaker 1: There's the prescriptive, you know, you can either go down the road that, you know, you can use this principle to make better games or that's a good, I didn't think of that one.

382
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:26,010
Speaker 1: I know that's the one I figured that you didn't think of, but the one you're probably thinking of is that you can use games or the popularity of certain games to determine whether or not people are going to be successful.

383
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,130
Speaker 0: Well, that was one thing I was thinking.

384
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,509
Speaker 1: The marshmallow game worked pretty well and a world of Warcraft so far works pretty well.

385
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:36,550
Speaker 0: And you've hit where exactly where I was headed, right?

386
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:45,450
Speaker 0: Perhaps the reason that people like us do not like the world of Warcraft is this world of Warcraft is a game of instant and constant gratification.

387
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:51,189
Speaker 0: It's basically a game that keeps putting mushrooms, uh, marshmallows in front of you and you keep eating them and you keep getting more.

388
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:59,250
Speaker 0: So people who are the type that will just eat the marshmallow, the unsuccessful types will play world of Warcraft and just eat all these marshmallows and have a grand old time.

389
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:14,010
Speaker 0: Whereas we prefer games that most people hate hard games, games that suck games, games that have a lot of, you know, strategies and such, and are only rewarding if you actually win and suffer a great deal to get to the end.

390
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,599
Speaker 0: Those are the games that we like being successful.

391
00:23:16,901 --> 00:23:21,350
Speaker 1: marshmallow resistors would not say that German board games are only fun if you win.

392
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,770
Speaker 0: I would not say that either, but you just did perhaps.

393
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,750
Speaker 0: But did I say the word German board games?

394
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,028
Speaker 0: No, I said hard games.

395
00:23:28,714 --> 00:23:29,750
Speaker 0: There are easy German boards.

396
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,189
Speaker 1: There are even games that we don't like.

397
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,889
Speaker 0: There are many games we don't like.

398
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,429
Speaker 1: I respect age of steam.

399
00:23:34,995 --> 00:23:35,890
Speaker 1: That is a good game.

400
00:23:36,172 --> 00:23:36,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

401
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:36,833
Speaker 0: I don't like.

402
00:23:36,893 --> 00:23:37,657
Speaker 0: go enjoy playing.

403
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:38,080
Speaker 1: age of steam.

404
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:40,144
Speaker 0: Yes.

405
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:50,750
Speaker 0: I said it was a stretch and I am obviously generalizing and thus in, you know, introducing a lots of falsities on the fringes and the extreme cases and the not so extreme cases.

406
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,990
Speaker 0: However, I do think that, but I make a point.

407
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,570
Speaker 1: Nonetheless, I do think that use it as a player in a game who wants to win.

408
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:03,167
Speaker 1: This principle is very important because a lot of games unintentionally thinking of it that way.

409
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,690
Speaker 1: That's no, that's the third way games either intentionally or not.

410
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:09,410
Speaker 1: Mostly the fourth way is the moon game, right?

411
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,686
Speaker 1: But intentionally or not, a lot of games have mechanics where you can get an immediate reward now.

412
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,830
Speaker 1: Like in, Oh, she, we're going to talk about a little bit.

413
00:24:18,293 --> 00:24:19,869
Speaker 1: I can push your one off right now.

414
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:27,010
Speaker 1: Instant gratification, or I can not push him off, leave him threatened and use that as leverage to go after your two and three pieces.

415
00:24:27,154 --> 00:24:27,426
Speaker 0: Yep.

416
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:41,050
Speaker 1: So, but in terms of, you know, and also you could, what about mechanisms design of mechanism design, make games that encourage implicitly the holding off and get kids to play them to teach them this principle if they don't already have it.

417
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:41,728
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

418
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,930
Speaker 1: Because the very fascinating thing about this video is that they went at four year olds.

419
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:50,690
Speaker 1: I wonder what the factor is that will cause a child to be able to do this or not.

420
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,650
Speaker 0: I am very interested in that as well.

421
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,390
Speaker 1: Is it genetic?

422
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,330
Speaker 0: He said that they were teaching kids to resist gratification in South Korea.

423
00:24:57,471 --> 00:25:00,530
Speaker 0: So I wonder exactly how they're doing that teaching.

424
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,009
Speaker 1: Because the interesting thing is, is that going to work?

425
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,310
Speaker 0: He said they made like a book, like a marshmallow book.

426
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:09,110
Speaker 1: Or is that just a bandaid over a deeper behavioral thing?

427
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,229
Speaker 0: I also won.

428
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:14,050
Speaker 0: It was only four minutes, so he did not have time to tell us more information.

429
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:27,550
Speaker 1: I mean, the example I would use is that someone who was born autistic cannot be not autistic anymore, but you can use, if they have like very severe autism, you can use behavioral training to give them a better chance of integrating into society.

430
00:25:28,074 --> 00:25:29,810
Speaker 1: It doesn't actually make the autism better.

431
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,570
Speaker 1: It just makes the appearance and the interaction better.

432
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,710
Speaker 1: It makes it as a result easier on the person.

433
00:25:35,111 --> 00:25:42,330
Speaker 1: And while the net benefit is definitely there, it may not be as much of a benefit as some people think who don't study it more thoroughly.

434
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,150
Speaker 1: I think with this, it could be the same thing.

435
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,270
Speaker 1: I mean, maybe there is a don't eat the marshmallow gene.

436
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,890
Speaker 0: Maybe here's my final angle on this, right?

437
00:25:51,191 --> 00:25:57,790
Speaker 0: If you want to make a video game that sells a fuck ton and everyone loves, basically the games you just keep giving your marshmallows the whole way through.

438
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,509
Speaker 0: That way, those two thirds of people who are marshmallow eaters will love it.

439
00:26:01,072 --> 00:26:05,389
Speaker 0: And the game should also give you twice as many marshmallows if you don't eat the marshmallows along the way.

440
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,430
Speaker 0: So the one third and then everyone will love the game.

441
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,269
Speaker 0: It'll be psychologically fulfilling to all.

442
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:14,650
Speaker 1: If you could add that, if you could somehow add greater reward for delayed gratification to World of Warcraft.

443
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:17,590
Speaker 1: That might be bad.

444
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:26,229
Speaker 0: Hey, you know, hey, if you don't grind and you don't, it's like, don't pick up all the it's like you get some loot.

445
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:41,190
Speaker 0: If you don't pick it up and keep not picking it up and keep not doing what leveling up, then eventually you'll get even better than what you would have gotten because you know what will happen, what will happen with World of Warcraft players.

446
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:48,650
Speaker 1: They will grind one character all the way and then they'll have another account and I'll have that other character not grind and they'll do both at the same time.

447
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,030
Speaker 1: Effectively, you're still grinding.

448
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:56,282
Speaker 1: Perhaps as someone who played the realm a lot back in the day, I would have done something like that.

449
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:56,763
Speaker 0: Yeah.

450
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:04,947
Speaker 1: But you see the point that I think the more interesting tech is to look at this concept and try to make games that do.

451
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,125
Speaker 1: I mean, the carrot stick model is pretty solid.

452
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,910
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft is perfect.

453
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:11,250
Speaker 0: Instead of carrots and sticks, we should move to marshmallows.

454
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,710
Speaker 1: No, marshmallow management.

455
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,934
Speaker 1: Maybe there are models of carrot stick that we haven't explored yet or ratios we haven't explored yet.

456
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:20,369
Speaker 1: that might in the end to make more rewarding games.

457
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:28,490
Speaker 0: Perhaps there are many also areas in which I could explore this marshmallow idea outside of the gaming realm, but it's Tuesday, so that will be held up.

458
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:33,910
Speaker 1: I do note, Scott, that if we play Advance Wars, you have no capacity to not immediately eat the marshmallow.

459
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,628
Speaker 0: That is true.

460
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,770
Speaker 0: But there are other games where I will not eat the marshmallow ever.

461
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,290
Speaker 0: In fact, it will get to the end of the game.

462
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,310
Speaker 0: I'll get a pile of marshmallows and still not eat any.

463
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:41,769
Speaker 0: Of course.

464
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:45,330
Speaker 1: Then there are games like OSHI where you'll basically choke yourself on marshmallows.

465
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,190
Speaker 0: It's totally game dependent, so who knows?

466
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,310
Speaker 1: At Anime Boston.

467
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,930
Speaker 0: I'm successful, so whatever.

468
00:27:52,553 --> 00:27:53,530
Speaker 1: Well, that's debatable.

469
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,449
Speaker 0: Well, by his definitions of good grades, jobs, etc.

470
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:57,309
Speaker 1: In the university.

471
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,027
Speaker 1: Good grades?

472
00:27:58,832 --> 00:28:00,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, but grades didn't really matter.

473
00:28:01,237 --> 00:28:02,830
Speaker 1: Maybe that was a delayed gratification.

474
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:07,889
Speaker 0: Maybe I'm the girl who ate the inside of the marshmallow and is going to be successful, but should not work at the bank.

475
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,290
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

476
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,788
Speaker 0: That girl was like convulsing like an addict.

477
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,890
Speaker 1: She reminded me of Shall I warm, sirs, crack pile.

478
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:18,590
Speaker 0: All right.

479
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:26,610
Speaker 1: At Anime Boston, you know, we're friends with like all the people who are in Connecticut and they had a booth set up and, you know, board games were for sale at Anime Boston.

480
00:28:27,092 --> 00:28:33,370
Speaker 1: And it just so happened that two games that we had known about did not own had did not play, didn't know anything about other than that.

481
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,647
Speaker 1: They were made by whiz kids.

482
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,348
Speaker 0: I knew about one of the games, which is no more because I had played it at the.

483
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:42,550
Speaker 0: basically the story begins when I went to the NYC nerd gaming night with Alex.

484
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:42,968
Speaker 0: Right.

485
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,230
Speaker 0: And some coworker, Brian, I think his name was and whatever.

486
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:49,459
Speaker 0: We played a game called.

487
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:56,110
Speaker 0: we played a game of Vinci, but we also played a game of Tsuro, which is a game I had seen many times in stores right on shelves.

488
00:28:56,492 --> 00:29:00,107
Speaker 0: But I never played it, but I recognized it like I've seen that game around all over the place.

489
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,670
Speaker 0: It was made by whiz kids.

490
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:06,245
Speaker 0: The people who made Mage Knight and Hero clicks and et cetera, et cetera, gone, they're gone.

491
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,550
Speaker 0: And the only successful thing I think they had was the hero clicks.

492
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,070
Speaker 0: I think everything else was a bust.

493
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:12,918
Speaker 0: And, you know, they got shut down by now.

494
00:29:12,938 --> 00:29:15,657
Speaker 0: we were a division of tops and tops closed them out.

495
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:24,266
Speaker 1: We talked at length at Anime Boston with some other gamer people and the head of Anime Kineticon about why these kids went under and how they could have.

496
00:29:24,386 --> 00:29:28,330
Speaker 1: they could have been like one of the biggest game companies should have just stuck with the hero clicks only.

497
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,294
Speaker 0: And they should have made.

498
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:33,190
Speaker 0: if all of their clicks games work together properly, they probably would have done all right.

499
00:29:33,311 --> 00:29:35,570
Speaker 1: But instead, we got things like Mech Warrior, Mage Knight.

500
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,149
Speaker 0: And that game was bad.

501
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:46,630
Speaker 0: They had a thing about this tops closed whiz kids, a subdivision of whiz kids, even right, like even lower on the totem pole had was doing all the classic battle tech.

502
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,369
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure that's all dead now, too.

503
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,570
Speaker 1: So anyway, they had both these games.

504
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,029
Speaker 1: So we know we were bored hanging out.

505
00:29:54,352 --> 00:29:56,409
Speaker 1: So we asked Matt to teach us how to play oshi.

506
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,029
Speaker 1: And he basically point at it and said, read the book.

507
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:00,890
Speaker 1: So we sit down and read the book.

508
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:02,769
Speaker 1: And now it takes like two seconds to learn how to play oshi.

509
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rule book is a piece of cardboard.

510
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:05,343
Speaker 0: That's it.

511
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:05,888
Speaker 0: Yep.

512
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,830
Speaker 1: And then we just we just we bought oshi and suro right then and then.

513
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:17,626
Speaker 0: Because, you know, I had learned at, you know, at that game night that, you know, I played suro and discovered that it was an awesome game for two to eight players.

514
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:20,170
Speaker 0: that, you know, worked great with two to eight players.

515
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:23,229
Speaker 0: It was very easy to learn, easy to play, but also very good.

516
00:30:23,712 --> 00:30:27,640
Speaker 0: You know, I played it a few times and had a lot of fun, has a dragon in it, has a dragon in it.

517
00:30:28,231 --> 00:30:30,550
Speaker 0: And, you know, but they said it was out of print.

518
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,296
Speaker 0: So I went to.

519
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:35,888
Speaker 0: I went to Boston and we saw it in the dealer's room there at the Kineticon table.

520
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,010
Speaker 0: They had eight copies and I knew it was out of print and I had played it and liked it.

521
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,089
Speaker 0: So how can I not buy it?

522
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:40,237
Speaker 0: Yeah.

523
00:30:40,691 --> 00:30:45,310
Speaker 1: Lately, I have more and more of this thing for getting out of print games, even if they're not good, just because they're out of print.

524
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:45,806
Speaker 0: I know.

525
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:45,980
Speaker 1: Right.

526
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:50,470
Speaker 1: It's kind of a collector mentality, but at the same time, our copy dooms real good.

527
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:51,090
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

528
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,130
Speaker 0: I got used on eBay.

529
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:52,422
Speaker 1: Yeah.

530
00:30:52,975 --> 00:30:54,270
Speaker 1: I want to get a copy of the expansion.

531
00:30:55,173 --> 00:30:55,830
Speaker 0: There's oh, there's an expansion.

532
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,090
Speaker 0: There are several expansions.

533
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:57,688
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

534
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,990
Speaker 1: One one has burning wheel kind of combat.

535
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,625
Speaker 1: Really?

536
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:01,120
Speaker 1: Yeah.

537
00:31:01,291 --> 00:31:03,230
Speaker 1: When leaders fight like it gets it's intense.

538
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:03,629
Speaker 0: It's cool.

539
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,350
Speaker 0: I actually like that better than the straight up win with the, you know, reveals.

540
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:08,110
Speaker 0: Yeah.

541
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,790
Speaker 0: If you could actually use the kind of feels are good, though.

542
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,710
Speaker 1: It's good game theory stuff, but it is anyway.

543
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,748
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Suro first, because I have less to say about it, even though it's a very good game.

544
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,350
Speaker 0: OK, the way Suro works right is everyone has a dude, right?

545
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,829
Speaker 0: It is the game of the path.

546
00:31:22,056 --> 00:31:22,290
Speaker 0: Yes.

547
00:31:22,692 --> 00:31:27,338
Speaker 0: Everyone has a dude and you put your dude on the edge of the board somewhere and you can put them pretty much anywhere you want.

548
00:31:28,124 --> 00:31:29,070
Speaker 0: that isn't taken already.

549
00:31:29,811 --> 00:31:36,448
Speaker 0: And then on your turn, you take you have a hand of three tiles and you take a tile and put it in front of you.

550
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:36,809
Speaker 0: Right.

551
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:42,590
Speaker 0: And every tile is a square and every tile has two connections on each side.

552
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:45,909
Speaker 0: So there is no arrangement of tiles that will not fit.

553
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,710
Speaker 0: Right.

554
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,610
Speaker 0: Every edge of the board has two spots and every tile has two spots in each side.

555
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,250
Speaker 0: So you can always every tile fits in every spot.

556
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,070
Speaker 0: It's not like Carcassonne where you're going like doesn't fit there, doesn't fit.

557
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,404
Speaker 0: It always fits right.

558
00:32:01,031 --> 00:32:07,610
Speaker 0: Your guy starts in the edge of the board, which means you can never make a loop, because if you made a loop, you would go right back where you came from.

559
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,450
Speaker 0: And that's not possible.

560
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:08,730
Speaker 0: Right.

561
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,590
Speaker 0: So it's impossible to make a loop and you just keep playing tiles.

562
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:21,710
Speaker 0: And on your turn, all you do is put a tile in front of your guy and then slide your guy down the path until he reaches another edge until he can't go anymore.

563
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,570
Speaker 0: And then your next turn, you put another tile in front of you and you keep moving.

564
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,650
Speaker 1: Now, the game's really simple.

565
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,869
Speaker 1: It's pretty much whoever's on the board last wins.

566
00:32:28,139 --> 00:32:28,308
Speaker 0: Yep.

567
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:30,310
Speaker 0: Now, think about what this means.

568
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:30,550
Speaker 0: Right.

569
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:37,870
Speaker 0: Number one, the game really is, you know, you could say whoever's on the board last wins, but it's also whoever plays the most tiles wins.

570
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:38,530
Speaker 0: Right.

571
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:40,629
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, every turn you have to play a tile.

572
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,870
Speaker 0: So whoever plays the most tiles is on the board the longest.

573
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:44,429
Speaker 0: Right.

574
00:32:46,152 --> 00:32:56,350
Speaker 0: Also, if two players are on the edge of the same square, one of them is going to go before the other one, which means you get to control the other person's movements.

575
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:00,790
Speaker 0: You really don't want to end up right in front of someone if it's, you know, their turn.

576
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:05,610
Speaker 1: But if you cause the death of another player, they go off the board, then you get a little bit of a boon.

577
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,108
Speaker 1: You get to pick like some of their tiles.

578
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:07,649
Speaker 0: Yep.

579
00:33:07,771 --> 00:33:12,690
Speaker 0: Like, you know, in the course of playing all these tiles, there's going to be a lot of paths that are created that are unused.

580
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:19,850
Speaker 0: Some of those paths can be used on purpose to get your guy over to like an unused area of the board.

581
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,467
Speaker 1: However, most of them are dead.

582
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,288
Speaker 0: Yes, most of them are dead.

583
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,518
Speaker 0: But occasionally you can use.

584
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:35,849
Speaker 0: you can go across the already existing tiles and take a big long roundabout route, because really the goal is to get your guy into a position where there's lots of empty spaces in front of him.

585
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,930
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of like get to the unpaved road so I can pave it.

586
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:49,828
Speaker 0: If you're stuck in an area that doesn't have a lot of paved roads in it, you know, unpaved spots, you're pretty much going to die no matter what tiles you're in your hand, because you got nowhere to go.

587
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,910
Speaker 0: You have to keep paving.

588
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:56,707
Speaker 0: So getting your guy in a good position is just as important as, you know, putting the right tiles in front of you.

589
00:33:57,231 --> 00:34:05,690
Speaker 1: But the really cool thing about the game is that each piece is either unique or nearly so like the pieces are all completely crazy.

590
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,030
Speaker 0: Yep.

591
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,614
Speaker 0: Some of them are.

592
00:34:07,177 --> 00:34:09,290
Speaker 0: some of them are better, though, because they give you more options.

593
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:09,853
Speaker 1: Well, you have.

594
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:14,400
Speaker 1: you have this sort of weak drafting element where you'll have three in your hand and you play one draw once.

595
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,809
Speaker 1: you always have a choice of three.

596
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:16,226
Speaker 1: Yep.

597
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,389
Speaker 1: Except toward the end of the game when you're running out of tiles.

598
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:23,110
Speaker 1: But then you want the only way to switch up tiles is to kill someone else.

599
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:27,248
Speaker 0: Eventually, when the tiles run out, everyone stops drawing tiles and just has to use what they got.

600
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:29,770
Speaker 0: And by then, everyone's dying all over the place anyway.

601
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:35,310
Speaker 1: So it's not a big deal, you know, there's not much more else to say about the game, except that it scales really well.

602
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:43,862
Speaker 1: And if you want a game to get other people into gaming or a good social game to play, like at home, like bring all your friends over, just play like 10 games of it in a row for like 15 minutes.

603
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:44,579
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:34:45,032 --> 00:34:46,429
Speaker 0: I mean, it doesn't take long to play.

605
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:49,850
Speaker 0: It works well with two, three, four, five, six, seven or eight players.

606
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:58,410
Speaker 0: It's really fun with eight players because this stiff competition for territory right away, it gets crazy right off the bat and it's easy to learn.

607
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,510
Speaker 0: And it's also a good game, strategically speaking, even though there's also some randomness and I just got shit tiles.

608
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:05,208
Speaker 0: I got nothing to do.

609
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:05,690
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

610
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,290
Speaker 0: But it's not really a problem because you're going to play again in two seconds anyway.

611
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,510
Speaker 0: So whatever.

612
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,429
Speaker 1: It's also a great game to just like bring to a con and whip out.

613
00:35:13,731 --> 00:35:17,510
Speaker 0: It's out of print, but it's not too difficult to find at the moment.

614
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,150
Speaker 0: But if you wait too long, it probably will become more difficult to find.

615
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,826
Speaker 0: So the game is Tsuro, T-S-U-R-O from WizKids who are out of business and it comes in a nice little box.

616
00:35:27,312 --> 00:35:29,610
Speaker 1: Now, the second game that is much more interesting.

617
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:32,130
Speaker 1: Oh, she the game of influence.

618
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,822
Speaker 0: O-S-H-I.

619
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,030
Speaker 0: These games both have Asian themes to them.

620
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:40,109
Speaker 0: One is sort of like an Asian temple house, castle theme, and the other one sort of has a dragon theme.

621
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:41,770
Speaker 0: But I just thought that was interesting.

622
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,490
Speaker 1: This is a really simple, symmetric, perfect information to play a game like chess.

623
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:49,270
Speaker 0: You see, everyone puts the pieces on the board and moves them around.

624
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,670
Speaker 1: Basically, you'll have all these all these pieces on board.

625
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,050
Speaker 1: Some are one high, some are too high, some are three high.

626
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:54,888
Speaker 1: They're all like pagodas.

627
00:35:56,216 --> 00:35:56,570
Speaker 0: And all right.

628
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,850
Speaker 0: Pagoda.

629
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,367
Speaker 0: That's the word.

630
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:06,549
Speaker 1: If you have one high piece can move one space in any orthogonal direction and can push up to one piece of yours or the enemy's.

631
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:13,930
Speaker 1: Yes, in one orthogonal direction, a two piece can put can move up to two and can push up to two pieces up to two spaces.

632
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:16,930
Speaker 1: A three can push or move up to three spaces.

633
00:36:17,591 --> 00:36:25,929
Speaker 1: Now, the interesting thing here is that as a result, a three piece is strong in the offensive because it can push up to three pieces no matter what.

634
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:31,650
Speaker 1: But being a three piece is not a defense because you can be pushed just as far as a one piece.

635
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:40,190
Speaker 0: A one piece can push a three piece, one space, a three piece, a three piece can push three one pieces, three space.

636
00:36:43,812 --> 00:36:51,970
Speaker 0: The whole game is you just take turns and you turn, you move one of your pieces and you try to knock the other guy's pieces off the board that literally you start to push them off the board.

637
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,510
Speaker 0: It comes with a little push them off the back, the front or the side.

638
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:58,110
Speaker 1: A little shoddily put together glued piece of wood.

639
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,830
Speaker 0: Well, that sort of that sort of annoyed me, right?

640
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:05,190
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, I mean, game production is sort of is important when you're paying a lot of money for a German board game.

641
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:10,030
Speaker 0: If you buy a set of Scrabble for ten bucks, do you really care if you get plastic pieces instead of wooden?

642
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:10,869
Speaker 0: No, not really.

643
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:16,710
Speaker 0: But if you pay, you know, like 20, perhaps, you know, some German board games like a lot of money, right?

644
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,469
Speaker 1: You spend what?

645
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,950
Speaker 1: Seventy five bucks on stupid Twilight Struggle, right?

646
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,530
Speaker 0: You want high quality production values, right?

647
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:25,130
Speaker 0: Or lots of pieces, even if they're lower quality.

648
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:33,209
Speaker 0: So, you know, this game, the we played a demo unit at at the con that the Connecticut people had, and their board was a solid piece of wood.

649
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:37,890
Speaker 0: I you know, but our board was like two pieces of wood glued to each other.

650
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,090
Speaker 1: They're not even the same wood.

651
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,230
Speaker 0: They're not even the same wood.

652
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:44,906
Speaker 0: And I feel like it's the board is going to snap in half and I'm going to have to make a board, which is not a big deal to make.

653
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,310
Speaker 1: But it's still annoying.

654
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,670
Speaker 0: I paid for this piece of wood and it feels like it's going to break.

655
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:49,710
Speaker 0: And I want a board game geek.

656
00:37:50,111 --> 00:37:55,320
Speaker 0: And someone else also had, you know, a piece of wood that was glued together and was probably going to break solid wood.

657
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,649
Speaker 0: Some people are broken wood.

658
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:59,650
Speaker 1: The game was is not high production values.

659
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,149
Speaker 0: The plastic pieces are nice.

660
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:01,685
Speaker 1: The game.

661
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:02,204
Speaker 1: They're OK.

662
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,469
Speaker 1: They have glue marks on them.

663
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:04,090
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

664
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:04,397
Speaker 0: Yeah.

665
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,449
Speaker 0: All right.

666
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,110
Speaker 1: But the game itself is pretty complex.

667
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,110
Speaker 1: The rules are really simple.

668
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,070
Speaker 1: It's not really fiddly.

669
00:38:10,472 --> 00:38:12,870
Speaker 1: It's got a simple anti stalemate stalemate mechanism.

670
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:14,389
Speaker 0: I like the anti stalemate mechanism.

671
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,690
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good mechanism, but it is still possible to generate a recursive stalemate.

672
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:19,404
Speaker 0: it is.

673
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,450
Speaker 0: But it's pretty obvious whoever has the upper hand in such a recursive stalemate.

674
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:30,249
Speaker 0: And as we have seen, what you think might be a recursive stalemate might actually not be because it might go on for a little bit.

675
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,950
Speaker 0: You'll go to one end of the board, then go back to the other end of the board.

676
00:38:33,371 --> 00:38:38,688
Speaker 0: But then you'll be in a configuration where suddenly one of the other pieces on the board comes into play and busted up.

677
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,270
Speaker 0: Well, well, it's not always true, but it happened a couple of times.

678
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:46,470
Speaker 1: My warning to you is to not take advice from Scott on this game.

679
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:48,250
Speaker 0: I'm not.

680
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,770
Speaker 1: I'm one to trash talk pretty mercilessly.

681
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,530
Speaker 1: But in this case, it's just funny.

682
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:53,266
Speaker 1: We got the game.

683
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:54,568
Speaker 0: I can't stop laughing.

684
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,709
Speaker 1: We played it twice at the con and I won the first game and Scott won the second game and it was really cool.

685
00:38:58,791 --> 00:39:00,188
Speaker 1: So we just bought it and that was it.

686
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:00,565
Speaker 1: Yep.

687
00:39:00,991 --> 00:39:02,650
Speaker 1: We got home after anime Boston.

688
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,068
Speaker 1: We're hanging out and I proceeded to win like 15 in a row.

689
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:09,708
Speaker 1: You went a lot in a row and then Scott won one.

690
00:39:10,632 --> 00:39:12,689
Speaker 1: But then he accused me of letting him win, which is kind of true.

691
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,649
Speaker 1: And then I won like another whole bunch.

692
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,789
Speaker 1: And then Scott Johnson came over.

693
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,169
Speaker 1: I played against him once.

694
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:19,575
Speaker 0: He beat me, but I was.

695
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:23,248
Speaker 0: I was giving Scott Johnson advice, which sometimes he accepted and sometimes did not.

696
00:39:23,432 --> 00:39:24,490
Speaker 1: So then you're like, wait a minute.

697
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:25,189
Speaker 1: I know what to do now.

698
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,070
Speaker 1: And you play against me and I got dominated.

699
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,269
Speaker 1: 15 more games.

700
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:29,930
Speaker 0: I won one of those.

701
00:39:30,031 --> 00:39:31,189
Speaker 0: I think you did win one.

702
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:33,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Scott just can't play this game.

703
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:34,377
Speaker 0: I don't know what's going on?

704
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:37,930
Speaker 0: because like when I was helping Scott was I was watching Scott Johnson play.

705
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:43,070
Speaker 0: I like saw what to do and ended up working because Scott Johnson won like what I saw.

706
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,030
Speaker 0: I saw it play out.

707
00:39:44,094 --> 00:39:44,330
Speaker 0: Right.

708
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:47,950
Speaker 0: But when I was when I was playing, it's like I was seeing something completely different.

709
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:48,788
Speaker 0: I just got hosed.

710
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:56,590
Speaker 1: So I got to figure out I got to I got to do something really, really cool thing about this game is that one is almost straight up pattern recognition.

711
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:03,789
Speaker 1: Like all you have to do is recognize the patterns and you'll see immediately where each recursive kind of set of moves will end up at the end.

712
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,610
Speaker 1: And then you don't have to think about that anymore.

713
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:09,589
Speaker 1: You just enact the pattern knowing where it will end and then push the guy off the edge.

714
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:11,948
Speaker 1: What the game really is analogous to.

715
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:17,047
Speaker 1: And if you can conceptualize this in your mind, you will win this game almost all the time.

716
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,210
Speaker 1: There's that old game.

717
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:21,050
Speaker 1: I used to play it a ton in like middle school and elementary school.

718
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,506
Speaker 1: And I taught everyone in the crew how to play it.

719
00:40:23,051 --> 00:40:30,370
Speaker 1: I don't even know what it's called, but it's like the stick game where you draw like four sticks, three sticks and two sticks or five sticks, four sticks and two sticks.

720
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:36,610
Speaker 1: There are different variations and everyone takes turns picking up a number of sticks and whoever picks up the last stick loses.

721
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:37,408
Speaker 0: Yep.

722
00:40:37,775 --> 00:40:38,610
Speaker 1: It's a really simple game.

723
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:47,169
Speaker 0: For example, I'll cross off all four, then rim will cross off like two of the threes that I'll cross off one of the threes.

724
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:53,269
Speaker 0: I'll cross off the two at the bottom and then rim is left with just the one remaining stick in the middle and then he's done.

725
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,628
Speaker 1: Yep.

726
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:06,648
Speaker 1: But those that is still a game where if you can recognize patterns where like you don't have to get the game into a state where the other person picks up the last stick, you have to get the game into a state where the only possible option 10 moves later is for him to pick up the last stick.

727
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:07,069
Speaker 1: Yep.

728
00:41:07,374 --> 00:41:08,670
Speaker 1: Oh, she is exactly like that.

729
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,350
Speaker 1: And the math behind that is really cool.

730
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,610
Speaker 1: The game, the board basically alternates between stable and unstable states.

731
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:22,489
Speaker 1: I would define stable as there is no possible move that can cause one color to push another, any piece of another color off the board.

732
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:31,350
Speaker 1: And there's an unstable board to where one color or both colors, it doesn't matter which can push a piece of the other color off the board.

733
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,517
Speaker 1: Yep.

734
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:33,130
Speaker 1: And there are degrees of stability.

735
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,008
Speaker 1: The more pieces that can be pushed off, the more unstable the game is.

736
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:43,648
Speaker 1: And all you do is alternate the board between stable and unstable states iterating through these patterns until someone wins.

737
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,770
Speaker 0: Basically what sort of happens, right?

738
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:53,330
Speaker 0: Is you'll be, you'll, you start moving your pieces out right from the starting positions and then suddenly someone is in a position where they're going to lose a piece, right?

739
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,790
Speaker 0: So the beginning choice that you might do is to take that piece that's going to get killed and move it out of the way.

740
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:01,130
Speaker 0: So now it can't be killed, right?

741
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:09,890
Speaker 0: But it's actually because the way the game works, really difficult to run away from death, because usually it's like a three piece threatening a one piece.

742
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:13,270
Speaker 0: And it's probably, you know, one piece just can't get away.

743
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:16,710
Speaker 0: If it's too close to the edge of the board, it's, it's, it's doomed, right?

744
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:22,470
Speaker 0: So what you have to do instead is in the one piece is never going to run away.

745
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:26,630
Speaker 0: And if you spend all your actions running away, you're just going to lose a whole bunch of points all over the place.

746
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,570
Speaker 0: Instead, take one of your pieces and threaten elsewhere.

747
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:32,289
Speaker 0: So he's going to kill your one.

748
00:42:32,671 --> 00:42:38,407
Speaker 0: So put his two, instead of moving the one out of the way, move your three into a position where it's going to kill his two.

749
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:41,830
Speaker 0: So now it's like, all right, you can't waste your turn killing my one.

750
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,524
Speaker 0: I'll kill your two.

751
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:45,650
Speaker 0: And it sort of stacks up all over the place.

752
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:48,590
Speaker 1: And well, that's actually very similar to the patterns you see in chess.

753
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:49,087
Speaker 0: Yeah.

754
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:49,504
Speaker 0: Yeah.

755
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:54,690
Speaker 0: But it's, it's a little bit different in that, um, you know, it's much, much simpler.

756
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,370
Speaker 1: It's trivial to plan 10 or 15 moves in advance, even if you're not an expert at the game.

757
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:02,588
Speaker 1: Uh, you just win it all the time.

758
00:43:06,415 --> 00:43:12,750
Speaker 0: No, but, well, you know, it has a lot fewer pieces, a lot, you know, simpler patterns, a lot smaller board, all sorts of things.

759
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:17,809
Speaker 0: You know, there's, you'll, you'll be in a position where there's a lot, it's obvious, you know, what all the options are.

760
00:43:18,411 --> 00:43:21,090
Speaker 0: You know, you only need, you don't need to kill like, you know, any specific piece.

761
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,489
Speaker 0: You just need to kill seven points worth.

762
00:43:22,862 --> 00:43:23,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:38,110
Speaker 1: Also the way to win against unskilled players, if you guys pick this game up and you want to play it against a friend is think about the stable, unstable mechanic I talked about and just constantly put the game into an as unstable a position as possible, just push the stability crazily off balance.

764
00:43:38,674 --> 00:43:39,929
Speaker 1: And the other person will get kind of found it.

765
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:40,510
Speaker 1: And then you'll just win.

766
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:40,654
Speaker 1: Yeah.

767
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:54,710
Speaker 0: You always, if you're not on the offensive, you know, putting his guys in a position where they're going to get killed constantly, then as soon as you're on the run, we're like a bunch or a lot more of your guys are in a position to die than his guys are in a position to die.

768
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:56,010
Speaker 0: You're pretty much done.

769
00:43:56,271 --> 00:44:03,010
Speaker 0: It's very difficult to run away unless you have a really clever setup where like, with a, with like a one move, you can, you know, turn the tables.

770
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:11,030
Speaker 1: Now the, of course, the only significant drawback to the game is that like all small, perfect information game, eventually figure it out.

771
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,310
Speaker 1: The game is, is eminently solvable.

772
00:44:13,451 --> 00:44:17,588
Speaker 1: And I think mathematically, I don't think it would be that difficult to mathematically solve it.

773
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,450
Speaker 0: And then, no, I mean, they've solved checkers.

774
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:22,563
Speaker 0: You know, you could easily write a computer program.

775
00:44:22,603 --> 00:44:28,290
Speaker 1: checkers is a little bit because pieces all have, there are only two possible kinds of pieces and the number, the kinds of moves are simple.

776
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:30,409
Speaker 1: And also checkers has compelled moves.

777
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:31,650
Speaker 0: No, that's true.

778
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,010
Speaker 0: Compelled.

779
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,229
Speaker 1: There are no compelled moves here.

780
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:33,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

781
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:41,850
Speaker 0: But even so, I think it would be not very difficult to, you know, make a computer program that would know the optimal move for any possible board configuration.

782
00:44:42,684 --> 00:44:42,788
Speaker 1: Yep.

783
00:44:43,191 --> 00:44:49,690
Speaker 1: I, I would wager, I feel like because there are so many opportunities for stalemate, that the end game is perfect stalemate.

784
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:50,077
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:54,130
Speaker 0: The stalemate, you know, rules sort of, uh, basically the stalemate rule.

786
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,316
Speaker 0: I don't think we said what it was.

787
00:44:55,456 --> 00:45:11,470
Speaker 0: is it's not that, you know, if there's a stalemate, blah, it's, if you move it, if a piece was in, let's say a piece was that position, you cannot move one of your pieces to a position that it resided on, on the beginning of your previous term, right?

788
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:19,609
Speaker 0: So if my two piece was two pieces up from right, and then it got moved two pieces down, I can't just move it two spaces back up to where it used to be.

789
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:21,290
Speaker 0: I have to move it somewhere else.

790
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:31,370
Speaker 1: This, however, is a very elegant rule because it very succinctly prevents almost all of the possible stalemates and problems because you can push a piece.

791
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,270
Speaker 1: Like I can take a second piece and push the first piece to where it was before.

792
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,770
Speaker 1: I can do all sorts of interesting things with my other pieces or with that piece.

793
00:45:40,232 --> 00:45:44,030
Speaker 1: It prevents the very specific scenario of I push you back three spaces.

794
00:45:44,473 --> 00:45:45,930
Speaker 1: You can't push me back three spaces.

795
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:48,350
Speaker 1: And furthermore, it gives the offender the advantage.

796
00:45:49,056 --> 00:45:50,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, think about it, though, right?

797
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,049
Speaker 0: I push you three so you can only push me back to.

798
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:53,669
Speaker 1: Right.

799
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,429
Speaker 0: But then right then I can't push you back, you know, that I could push three.

800
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:01,889
Speaker 0: But that you to see how it goes.

801
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:06,330
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but it always gives the offense the advantage because it'll always put the defender.

802
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:14,630
Speaker 1: If you let someone else push you three, you will always have to be reacting or avoiding and you can play games.

803
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,990
Speaker 1: Well, I'll push two, but then you're going to be pushed back even further.

804
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:23,069
Speaker 1: And there's other than having other pieces to leverage or running away, you will always be an advantage if you attack fully.

805
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:28,190
Speaker 1: The game is really fun and I highly recommend it to just about anyone.

806
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:29,570
Speaker 1: It's a good addition to your household.

807
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:39,430
Speaker 0: It's also a rare, good two player game that doesn't take very long and is not, you know, just rock, paper, scissors or, you know, chess.

808
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,650
Speaker 0: Well, it is chess, but it doesn't take as long as chess.

809
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,970
Speaker 1: Not right away because chess is just rock, paper, scissors.

810
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,070
Speaker 0: That's also true.

811
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,310
Speaker 1: But, you know, you see the point.

812
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,670
Speaker 1: It's iterated rock, paper, scissors.

813
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,429
Speaker 1: However, because the game is out of print, if you can't find it, just make it.

814
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:53,690
Speaker 1: It's trivial to make.

815
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:54,730
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's true.

816
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,150
Speaker 1: This is four or five, six, seven.

817
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,970
Speaker 1: It's a nine by nine grid and you need two, three pieces to two pieces and for one pieces for each side.

818
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:01,284
Speaker 1: That's it.

819
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:02,850
Speaker 0: And then get the rules of board game.

820
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:03,387
Speaker 0: We dot com.

821
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:03,889
Speaker 0: That's it.

822
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:04,230
Speaker 1: You're done.

823
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:04,470
Speaker 1: Yeah.

824
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:05,409
Speaker 0: You can make this game.

825
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:07,210
Speaker 0: So, you know, try to buy it, though.

826
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:10,370
Speaker 0: I guess if you're lucky enough to get the solid piece of wood, that's nice.

827
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:13,085
Speaker 0: Hey, maybe we should make a copy of this game because we should.

828
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:20,130
Speaker 0: because I mean, I can go buy a piece of wood, polish it up, you know, I'll get some ox blood, take a wood burner, burn a wood grid onto it.

829
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:20,321
Speaker 0: Right.

830
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,750
Speaker 0: Then get all sorts of nice stain, make it a nice color.

831
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:25,659
Speaker 1: You got to have the ox blood or it's not.

832
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:27,450
Speaker 0: you can really just use a go board, right?

833
00:47:27,652 --> 00:47:28,688
Speaker 0: You don't even really need to make it.

834
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,976
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,430
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you can play.

836
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,710
Speaker 1: You got to get little pieces to fit in the squares of the go board.

837
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:42,428
Speaker 0: I think it might be interesting to see if you could, you know, you could extend the life of this game by putting the pieces in different configurations or having bigger boards with more pieces, et cetera, et cetera.

838
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:50,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem with bigger boards is that a game like this, you would have to have more stalemate rules or you'll have just long stalemates that might not even be obvious.

839
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll be the same game, just bigger.

840
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,930
Speaker 1: Because the game is just pattern recognition.

841
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:00,809
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times, Scott, did we play where we do the four opening moves and we're in the exact same position we were in for the last eight games?

842
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:02,210
Speaker 0: Yup, exactly.

843
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:08,930
Speaker 0: And I took me like, it's like, wait, if I go first and I do this, does it turn out like that or does it turn out like the other way?

844
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,250
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it turned out the same way.

845
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:14,590
Speaker 0: So I have to do the other move when I go first to make it turn out the different way.

846
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:16,630
Speaker 1: All right, let's play some oshi and then go to bed.

847
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:17,324
Speaker 1: I think we're done here.

848
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,910
