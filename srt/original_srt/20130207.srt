1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,708
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, February 7th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:10,909
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:13,918
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,508
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:17,419
Speaker 1: Tonight, the fake geek.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,558
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:24,859
Speaker 1: Warm today.

8
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:25,920
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,380
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty warm compared to previous days.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,611
Speaker 0: It's not particularly warm or cold.

11
00:00:30,652 --> 00:00:32,080
Speaker 0: I mean, today's colder than it is warm.

12
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,334
Speaker 0: But anyway, there's a blizzard coming.

13
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:33,799
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got the- Enough of a blizzard to make our phones go.

15
00:00:36,595 --> 00:00:37,079
Speaker 0: eh, eh, eh.

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,800
Speaker 1: Well, I had the moment where everyone in my office got the emergency alert over the cell network, except one dude who has not updated iOS in forever.

17
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,776
Speaker 1: So he was like, "How come you guys all got this warning and I

18
00:00:48,836 --> 00:00:49,058
Speaker 1: didn't?".

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Speaker 1: And then Modern Seinfeld tweeted basically the plot where that's Kramer.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,559
Speaker 1: So on the way home, you know, there's a typical thing that happens in New York City.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,480
Speaker 1: Subway train's about to close its doors and some jackass tries to like get in and fails and he's trapped in the door.

22
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:06,770
Speaker 1: He could just back out and the train could move, but no.

23
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:10,120
Speaker 1: He tries to hold the door open and like squeeze his way in.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,720
Speaker 0: That asshole.

25
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,079
Speaker 1: So usually, there's only one recourse that the conductor has.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,360
Speaker 0: Kick his ass out of the train.

27
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,820
Speaker 1: Which is, he can open and close the doors really quick to try to hurt the person.

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,820
Speaker 1: Which, if you're ever on a subway train and the doors go like open, close, open, close, open, close, the conductor is probably manually trying to hurt some asshole.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,300
Speaker 0: Yep.

30
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:34,400
Speaker 1: In this case, he does that a few times and then he just starts talking.

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,934
Speaker 1: He says, "Sir, please do not stand blocking the door.

32
00:01:39,034 --> 00:01:40,599
Speaker 1: It is a criminal offense to...".

33
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,319
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess you got on the train.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:56,660
Speaker 1: And then the train goes and while we're in the Steinway Tunnel going on our way to Queens, conductor speaks up again and says, "Ladies and gentlemen," I'm paraphrasing obviously, "I know we say this often, but I'm going to have a little personal moment with all of you.

35
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,340
Speaker 1: You see, when you hold the doors open, you're a jerk.

36
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,279
Speaker 1: You're delaying everybody, you're making me unhappy, you're probably damaging the doors, you're lucky you don't get

37
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:06,460
Speaker 1: hurt.".

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,880
Speaker 1: Now this goes on for like five minutes.

39
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:09,789
Speaker 0: Okay.

40
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,500
Speaker 1: He just keeps talking.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,420
Speaker 1: We get to a station, you know, Vernon Jackson, he's like, "I've got to let some passengers off the train.

42
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:21,340
Speaker 1: You who held the door open, you know who you are, so don't hold the door open now.

43
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:26,439
Speaker 1: And I hope everyone's given you dirty looks and we'll continue this conversation after I let these nice people

44
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:26,659
Speaker 1: off.".

45
00:02:27,701 --> 00:02:32,760
Speaker 1: And then the doors open and close, we start moving again, it's quiet and everyone's silent, everyone's just kind of waiting.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,600
Speaker 1: Whoever it was was not in my car, obviously.

47
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,457
Speaker 1: And then he's like, "So where was

48
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:38,598
Speaker 1: I?".

49
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:40,014
Speaker 1: "Right, that

50
00:02:40,054 --> 00:02:40,297
Speaker 1: jerk.".

51
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:41,360
Speaker 1: He keeps going.

52
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,020
Speaker 1: I thought that was brilliant and the guy had such a stereotypical kind of Brooklyn-y accent that that sealed the deal.

53
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:55,320
Speaker 1: If I had thought I would have recorded it with my phone, I was kind of too busy laughing.

54
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,140
Speaker 0: Maybe someone did, maybe we'll see it on Reddit.

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,644
Speaker 1: Yeah, so keep an eye out on YouTube.

56
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:02,740
Speaker 1: for conductor berates someone on a seven train going to Queens.

57
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,117
Speaker 0: Let's check the NYC Reddit, let's see.

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,336
Speaker 0: Bloomberg moved to North Korea, if you can't handle something, Blizzard morning.

59
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,639
Speaker 1: I don't think it'll be there yet because I just took that train.

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,703
Speaker 0: Please help.

61
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:16,320
Speaker 0: a radio station, goat chased in Bed-Stuy.

62
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,080
Speaker 1: I saw that goat thing, you know why that was notable?

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,919
Speaker 1: You know who caught the goat?

64
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:27,739
Speaker 1: A guy who apparently used to live in a country where his job was goat herder.

65
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,916
Speaker 1: For real.

66
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:32,619
Speaker 1: According to a comment on the Gothamist.

67
00:03:33,303 --> 00:03:35,720
Speaker 1: That was verified by another comment.

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
Speaker 0: Alright, so check this out.

69
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,180
Speaker 0: This is just a tiny news.

70
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:42,799
Speaker 0: Google Hangout, which everyone uses all the time now.

71
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,200
Speaker 0: Which really put a hurting on Skype pretty quickly.

72
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,720
Speaker 1: The thing is, I use Google Hangout unless I just use Google Voice straight up.

73
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:57,180
Speaker 0: But anyway, they added a feature which allows you to adjust the bandwidth manually with a slider.

74
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,799
Speaker 0: And also an audio only mode.

75
00:03:59,385 --> 00:04:00,340
Speaker 1: I did not notice that.

76
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,420
Speaker 0: They just added it like, there's an article about it right here.

77
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,380
Speaker 0: I don't even know if it's actually added yet or it's just going to be there soon, like you're rolling it out.

78
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:08,199
Speaker 0: You know, but it's super new, like today new.

79
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:14,417
Speaker 0: So this is kind of crazy because, you know, how come more things?

80
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:15,200
Speaker 0: don't do this?

81
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,099
Speaker 0: Just have the direct bandwidth adjuster.

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,000
Speaker 1: Because people who are clever UI designers think, which it's not, I can't say that it's a bad thought.

83
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:27,460
Speaker 1: I don't want to bother my users with this fiddly bandwidth thing.

84
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,660
Speaker 1: I'll have an algorithm that just kind of automatically does it.

85
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,700
Speaker 1: The problem is, those algorithms are never really that great.

86
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,148
Speaker 0: There's no way to do it.

87
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:35,560
Speaker 0: that's really good enough, right?

88
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, okay we're going to do it for a game.

89
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,699
Speaker 0: So you see how fast your internet is, but the game server is far away.

90
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,060
Speaker 0: So we ping, ping doesn't tell the whole story.

91
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,300
Speaker 1: Well in the old days, so I used to manually tweak my settings in Quake 2 for like the look ahead.

92
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,200
Speaker 0: Exactly, but they don't give you control over those settings, you can't adjust them.

93
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,400
Speaker 1: The reason they don't in games is because you could trivially cheat by setting those in certain ways.

94
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:07,940
Speaker 1: If you had a little ping and you turned up certain kinds of interpolation, you could basically be Neo and go into a room and shoot and leave and people with high pings would never see you, they would just die.

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,080
Speaker 0: It's also annoying how YouTube, it used to be when you paused a video, you could eventually load the whole video.

96
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:14,920
Speaker 0: And now it doesn't really work that way.

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,980
Speaker 1: A lot of people, I've noticed the Daily Show and a lot of like apps that are purpose built for like a particular show or a particular thing, they only let you buffer like 12 seconds.

98
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,340
Speaker 1: Like dude, I probably have 24 gigs of RAM, just download the whole fucking thing.

99
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,280
Speaker 0: Exactly, I think what they're trying to do is, I think they've realized that a lot of people would basically buffer a whole bunch.

100
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:42,600
Speaker 0: Then not watch, and so they're actually saving a bunch of money on bandwidth on their end by not sending you a bunch of video you're not going to watch.

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,060
Speaker 1: Or, I have a theory, this would almost be a conspiracy theory.

102
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,120
Speaker 0: But they could solve that by giving you, again, control that says press here to buffer entire video.

103
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,600
Speaker 0: Or gasp, let me just download the video as a fucking file.

104
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:58,220
Speaker 1: Ah, so this would almost be a conspiracy theory.

105
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:14,180
Speaker 1: I would wager that at least some of the companies that have content like this make the experience suboptimal on purpose because they want the buzz of having it online, but they still want you to pay for cable to see it some other way normally.

106
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:23,000
Speaker 1: They don't want you to be that guy who only ever watches the Daily Show online, and has Adblock, and only watches it at hours where there aren't ads anyway.

107
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:26,000
Speaker 0: But at least for a hangout, this could be pretty cool, right?

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,840
Speaker 0: Because you can just turn on the audio only mode and be really good for podcast talking where you don't need the video.

109
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:40,620
Speaker 0: And if you got the video and someone's far away, they can just turn their bandwidth down and things will still be super smooth in general for everyone.

110
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,895
Speaker 0: Instead of like, someone's cutting out, that won't happen anymore.

111
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:44,960
Speaker 0: It'll still be there.

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,004
Speaker 1: We should try this out.

113
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,680
Speaker 1: I'm feeling the itch to get a guest on Geek Nights again.

114
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,240
Speaker 1: And I got a couple of guests lined up, possibly, who are not that close to us physically.

115
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,319
Speaker 0: Physically?

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,779
Speaker 1: Physically.

117
00:06:57,102 --> 00:06:58,879
Speaker 1: Sorry, that's an inside joke that doesn't involve you.

118
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,400
Speaker 0: Okay.

119
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:04,040
Speaker 1: It's kind of like that song from two days ago.

120
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:04,768
Speaker 0: Yep, that song.

121
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:05,438
Speaker 0: I can't even remember it.

122
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,822
Speaker 1: So I got an aside.

123
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:07,965
Speaker 1: Total aside.

124
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:14,180
Speaker 1: I haven't had a primary care practitioner as a main doctor for a long time because I've basically been in perfect health.

125
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,820
Speaker 0: I think I said on the show how I found one using my insurance's website of list of doctors.

126
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:22,130
Speaker 0: And I went there a few years ago and it was an awesome doctor.

127
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,896
Speaker 0: I was like, yes, lucky, awesome doctor.

128
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,140
Speaker 0: The best doctor probably ever.

129
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:31,620
Speaker 0: And then before I could even see the guy a second time, he went to Florida to become a director because he was such a good doctor.

130
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:32,919
Speaker 0: He's like now a hospital director.

131
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,339
Speaker 0: So the last time... And I haven't been to a doctor since.

132
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:42,080
Speaker 1: It's the last time I had a primary care practitioner as in the generic doctor you go to for like your physicals and all your normal stuff.

133
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,700
Speaker 1: The one who writes all your referrals and everything.

134
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,694
Speaker 1: I never needed one because I was basically in perfect health.

135
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:47,980
Speaker 1: I would like go to a clinic.

136
00:07:48,021 --> 00:07:48,700
Speaker 1: And now you're dying.

137
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,278
Speaker 1: So basically I'm over 30 and it's been a few years since I've had even like basic blood work.

138
00:07:55,298 --> 00:07:55,820
Speaker 1: So I'm like, you know what?

139
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,245
Speaker 1: I should just get a legit doctor.

140
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,872
Speaker 1: I recently got new insurance.

141
00:07:58,973 --> 00:07:59,957
Speaker 1: You know, not that long ago.

142
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:00,439
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

143
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,286
Speaker 1: So I've never had this experience before of.

144
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:09,320
Speaker 1: I called easily, not exaggerating, 11 doctors on the list from my insurance.

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,100
Speaker 0: And you say, hey, are you accepting new patients?

146
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,860
Speaker 1: All of them said, no, they're not.

147
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:15,140
Speaker 0: Well, well, that's a problem.

148
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:23,719
Speaker 1: Every doctor I called was like, either I'm not accepting new patients or I am accepting patients, but not patients where I'm the PCP.

149
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,440
Speaker 1: Like I will see you, but I will not be your doctor.

150
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:34,140
Speaker 1: And the few who would see me could give me an appointment for a physical in like three months.

151
00:08:34,706 --> 00:08:35,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, it takes a while.

152
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:41,116
Speaker 0: I can tell you the office where the awesome doctor I went to was, and I'm sure there are other doctors there.

153
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:41,818
Speaker 0: You can attempt it.

154
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:44,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I have particular insurance, but anyway.

155
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,715
Speaker 0: You can check to see if any of the doctors in that nice office are on your insurance.

156
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:50,040
Speaker 0: I think that's what I'm going to do as well.

157
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:55,120
Speaker 1: So after two weeks of this last week, I finally called this one doctor's office.

158
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,344
Speaker 1: And here's the other thing.

159
00:08:56,444 --> 00:09:00,818
Speaker 1: Most of the people who answered the phone were really surly and really weird.

160
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,720
Speaker 1: And most of them would just take a message like, oh, I'll talk to the doctor, whatever.

161
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,440
Speaker 1: No one ever called me back from those places when I called back.

162
00:09:08,962 --> 00:09:12,360
Speaker 1: No idea who I was, nor any idea that I had ever called or anything.

163
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,347
Speaker 0: Here's something I've noticed right in New York.

164
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:17,740
Speaker 0: People when shopping for doctors are fucking racist.

165
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:18,443
Speaker 0: Right.

166
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:21,000
Speaker 0: And knowing that people out there are racist.

167
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:30,600
Speaker 0: You can basically just assume if you've got a doctor with like a white person's name or a Jewish name or something like that, that the doctor is probably full of patients.

168
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:34,780
Speaker 0: So you want to go and pick a doctor with an Indian name or something like that?

169
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,820
Speaker 1: There's one exception to that.

170
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,198
Speaker 0: Because you're being anti-racist.

171
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:45,220
Speaker 1: I called two doctors with traditional Chinese names who had noted, because my insurance says what languages the doctor speaks.

172
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 0: You had to make sure they speak English and it's not the Chinese doctor in Chinatown who only speaks Chinese.

173
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,340
Speaker 1: Oh, so they all speak English guaranteed.

174
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:50,698
Speaker 0: Right.

175
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:52,127
Speaker 1: In my insurance.

176
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,899
Speaker 1: But it's additional languages.

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,160
Speaker 1: So I called two doctors who spoke Cantonese and Mandarin because I work kind of near Chinatown.

178
00:09:59,404 --> 00:09:59,717
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

179
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:04,460
Speaker 1: They were also full because all the people who speak Chinese Mandarin go to them in Chinatown.

180
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,038
Speaker 0: Try to find a Long Island City Astoria Queens.

181
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:08,320
Speaker 0: doctor.

182
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so many.

183
00:10:09,186 --> 00:10:10,617
Speaker 1: They're mostly Manhattan or Queens.

184
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,856
Speaker 0: There's a bunch near me.

185
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're not my insurance.

186
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:19,860
Speaker 1: So anyway, last week I finally called this one office and I was like, you know, I'm expecting nothing.

187
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:27,100
Speaker 1: And the nicest lady who actually sounded kind of cute answered and she was like, all right, he can see you Tuesday and we'll sort everything out.

188
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,005
Speaker 0: This might be.

189
00:10:28,026 --> 00:10:30,140
Speaker 0: here's the thing where you start to worry, right?

190
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,997
Speaker 0: If the doctor is so open to new patients, maybe it's a shit doctor.

191
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:33,480
Speaker 0: Everyone left.

192
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:33,855
Speaker 1: Yep.

193
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,605
Speaker 0: Maybe.

194
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,519
Speaker 0: You don't know.

195
00:10:36,021 --> 00:10:38,979
Speaker 1: Or maybe he's just actually efficient and nice.

196
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,579
Speaker 0: That's possible as well.

197
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:41,489
Speaker 1: So we'll see.

198
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:42,320
Speaker 1: We'll see how this goes.

199
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,160
Speaker 1: First time I've had a doctor that I'm going to in a long time.

200
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,280
Speaker 0: If the doctor is good and not Randy, let me know and I'll go there.

201
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:49,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will let you know.

202
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,180
Speaker 1: In fact, it's funny because when I finally got it, I came back.

203
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,760
Speaker 0: If that doctor that I went to that other time didn't go to Florida, I would have told you.

204
00:10:57,102 --> 00:11:01,440
Speaker 1: So I come back into my desk and I sit down and I'm like, ah, finally found a doctor.

205
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,347
Speaker 1: Two of my coworkers like, who is he?

206
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,100
Speaker 1: Cause I've been trying to find a doctor like off and on for the last six months.

207
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,100
Speaker 0: You know what doctors, they make a lot of money.

208
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,440
Speaker 0: You could have been a doctor.

209
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,900
Speaker 1: I'm glad I'm not a doctor.

210
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,759
Speaker 0: I'm also glad I'm not a doctor because the first time I saw something gross, I would have been like, blah.

211
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,180
Speaker 1: That is not the reason I'm glad I'm not a doctor.

212
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,580
Speaker 1: I'm glad I'm not a doctor because if I had wanted to be a doctor, I would have had to do work in college and that would have ruined everything.

213
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,364
Speaker 1: That's true.

214
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,720
Speaker 0: But there are literally only two things that kept me from being a doctor.

215
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,000
Speaker 0: And that is number one, blargh guts.

216
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,620
Speaker 0: And number two, doctors don't work fucking nine to five.

217
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,380
Speaker 0: They got to do that shit in the hospital residency, stay in there all day.

218
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,880
Speaker 1: You can work nine to five if you run a private practice.

219
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you got to get to private practice.

220
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,540
Speaker 0: You got to go through all that other bullshit.

221
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:45,460
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:45,964
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:11:45,985 --> 00:11:47,139
Speaker 0: I wasn't going to go through any bullshit.

224
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,200
Speaker 0: If to become a doctor, I just went to regular college like everyone else and just learned doctoring and didn't have to look at guts.

225
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:57,980
Speaker 0: And then could just go straight to being a regular doctor who plays golf most of the time.

226
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,183
Speaker 1: We had two separate people.

227
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:04,600
Speaker 1: There's the one dude on the panel who was like, I can't deal with fake violence, but I can deal with doctor stuff.

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,840
Speaker 1: And you're like, I can deal with fake violence, but I can't deal with doctor stuff.

229
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,340
Speaker 0: Exactly.

230
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:09,642
Speaker 1: All right.

231
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,128
Speaker 1: So I got, I got a news.

232
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:11,810
Speaker 1: It's Thursday.

233
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:14,400
Speaker 1: It's the lounge here on geek nights.

234
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:18,420
Speaker 1: So there was a paper and I read this paper actually.

235
00:12:18,943 --> 00:12:20,259
Speaker 1: And I've been thinking a lot about this paper.

236
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,459
Speaker 1: They gave you the full text.

237
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,061
Speaker 1: I got it.

238
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:24,062
Speaker 1: Yeah.

239
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:35,400
Speaker 1: So the paper is published recursive fury, conspiracist ideation in the blogosphere in response to research on conspiracist ideation.

240
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,799
Speaker 0: Where was this published?

241
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:40,179
Speaker 1: Uh, this one is on, I just read the PDF.

242
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:41,980
Speaker 1: I don't know.

243
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,580
Speaker 0: It was published in a journal, right?

244
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:45,220
Speaker 0: It's not a bunch of bullshit, right?

245
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,180
Speaker 0: So I'm referencing two articles just because it has a non bullshit name.

246
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:48,662
Speaker 0: No, no.

247
00:12:48,682 --> 00:12:53,340
Speaker 1: So this is an article that is referencing a bunch of other articles.

248
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:13,900
Speaker 1: And basically the gist of all this is that the original research, the original article that I read a long time ago, and there's a bunch of related studies to it, was talking about that sort of Rumsfeld sort of remember the crazy guy at open everything, those kinds of people and how certain kinds of people are sort of prone to so-called conspiratorial thinking.

249
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:21,120
Speaker 1: And they will assume that things that are clearly not conspiracies are obviously conspiracies.

250
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,200
Speaker 1: Those kinds of people tend to have certain similar thought patterns and similar discussion and speech patterns.

251
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,173
Speaker 0: That's kind of obvious.

252
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:29,560
Speaker 0: Okay.

253
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

254
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:40,200
Speaker 1: You think, yeah, things like that are common sense and kind of obvious, but it's one thing to say that it's another thing to actually document the specific detailed similarities between those people.

255
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,080
Speaker 0: What are those detailed similarities besides bad graphic design?

256
00:13:43,582 --> 00:13:44,967
Speaker 1: It's not bad graphic design.

257
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:46,954
Speaker 1: It's particular kinds of graphic design.

258
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,440
Speaker 1: For example, one of the common signs.

259
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,660
Speaker 0: None of those kinds are good kinds.

260
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:59,800
Speaker 1: It's not just that they'll have bad graphic design, but that they will show you a piece of evidence linked to a result.

261
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:05,620
Speaker 1: And then they will show you like the link, like why that is the link.

262
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:22,760
Speaker 1: And they will have the assumption that the link itself is a revelation that the link, when they tell it to you, is something so self-evident and so obvious that the fact that no one has seen it until they saw it is mind boggling.

263
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,080
Speaker 1: But if you show that link to a normal person, they literally see no connection.

264
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,600
Speaker 1: But conspiratorial people, if they show it to another person who has similar thought patterns, sees the link.

265
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,708
Speaker 1: And basically conspiracy nut bags are all kind of the same.

266
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:43,380
Speaker 1: If a dude believes in chemtrails, he's likely to believe in similar kinds of crazy BS.

267
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,559
Speaker 0: If someone told it to him, yeah.

268
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,421
Speaker 0: Yes.

269
00:14:45,441 --> 00:14:46,402
Speaker 1: So obvious known thing.

270
00:14:46,782 --> 00:15:05,280
Speaker 1: So this paper, the separate one talks about how that research has built an entire community of denier skeptics saying that that research on conspiratorial thinking is a conspiracy to discredit the people who are uncovering conspiracies.

271
00:15:06,545 --> 00:15:08,720
Speaker 1: I am amazed at the recursive fury.

272
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,225
Speaker 0: I'm amazed at the conspiracy.

273
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:13,620
Speaker 0: people found legitimate research because usually they don't read that kind of stuff.

274
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:15,947
Speaker 1: No, they find legitimate research all the time.

275
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:20,320
Speaker 1: And it's, you know, in my eyes, the way to detect these people is pretty simple.

276
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:24,400
Speaker 0: If you find a look at one of their PowerPoints, if it looks like time cube, they're crazy.

277
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:24,903
Speaker 1: All right.

278
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:26,133
Speaker 1: So say you don't see the PowerPoint.

279
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:26,859
Speaker 1: Say you have a friend.

280
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,662
Speaker 0: Okay.

281
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,319
Speaker 0: If a friend ever show them time cube, ask him what they think.

282
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:43,680
Speaker 1: If you have a friend who denies anything that is actually pretty obvious, like, I don't know, climate change research or the 9/11, you know, inside job kind of people or chemtrails or lizard people or any of that.

283
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,720
Speaker 0: Well, you hope that you hope they deny chemtrails.

284
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:46,802
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

285
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:52,720
Speaker 1: The moon landing hoax or guys, the birthers, the truthers, the Sandy Hook truthers.

286
00:15:53,622 --> 00:16:02,800
Speaker 1: So any of those people will never actually offer a specific theory on why they think there is a conspiracy or what the end goal is.

287
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:08,500
Speaker 1: They will simply say that the official story is wrong and here is proof of that.

288
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:18,280
Speaker 1: And you can disprove every individual piece of evidence they have that the official story is untrue, but they will always retreat to further increasingly made up evidence.

289
00:16:18,463 --> 00:16:19,579
Speaker 1: And there is no bottom to that.

290
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:21,544
Speaker 1: That's all.

291
00:16:21,624 --> 00:16:23,800
Speaker 1: I just think this is an interesting set of links and articles.

292
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,525
Speaker 1: You should all read it.

293
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:25,432
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

294
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,340
Speaker 1: It's not news.

295
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,700
Speaker 1: Click at all these links and read it all.

296
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:35,980
Speaker 1: And if you know someone who doesn't, who rejects climate science and don't talk to that person, just read and all these things.

297
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:36,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,171
Speaker 1: Pretty much you should just stop talking.

299
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,680
Speaker 0: Get rid of that person from your life.

300
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,483
Speaker 0: Don't talk to them.

301
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 0: Don't be with them and just ignore them because if you spend time on them, you're just wasting your own life.

302
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,419
Speaker 0: You're allowing them to do damage.

303
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:48,262
Speaker 1: Yeah.

304
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:54,060
Speaker 1: The thing is we have a friend who had friends like this who seemed to be coming around.

305
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,740
Speaker 1: He'd been like trying to like really not give up on them and really logic them until they have to admit basic science is true.

306
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:07,180
Speaker 1: And I'm pretty sure most of those people have regressed and or still believe in crazy shit to this day.

307
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,019
Speaker 1: And it's been many years.

308
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,218
Speaker 0: The thing is, to be honest, when I was in high school, I didn't know better.

309
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:11,520
Speaker 0: Right.

310
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,180
Speaker 0: I used to think there were aliens and some crazy shit.

311
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:23,420
Speaker 1: If you were a kid, if you were 10 years old and you watched Unsolved Mysteries, you were 100 percent sure that aliens come down and Lincoln's ghost will tell you where the gold is.

312
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,160
Speaker 0: That was me for quite a few years.

313
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,420
Speaker 1: That's every 10 year old.

314
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:26,882
Speaker 0: Right.

315
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,120
Speaker 0: So but how come I'm not 10 years old anymore?

316
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:36,000
Speaker 1: Either there's something that flips someone from normal person to conspiratorial person.

317
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,657
Speaker 0: You know, but like if I would have met one of those crazy old conspiracy kooks when I was a kid, I would have been like, fuck yeah, man.

318
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:43,580
Speaker 1: Awesome.

319
00:17:43,842 --> 00:17:45,680
Speaker 1: Because you watched Unsolved Mysteries.

320
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,139
Speaker 0: I watched similar shows.

321
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,240
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

322
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,016
Speaker 0: That's the wrong show.

323
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,659
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

324
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:53,174
Speaker 1: Anyway.

325
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:54,979
Speaker 0: Wrong show.

326
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,680
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day you got for me.

327
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,479
Speaker 0: So check this out.

328
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:04,900
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

329
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:12,420
Speaker 0: A game I haven't thought about in a long time, but I actually own every iteration of is Super Smash Brothers Melee Brawl.

330
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,676
Speaker 0: I don't even know which I know one of them's GameCube.

331
00:18:14,736 --> 00:18:15,260
Speaker 0: One of them's Wii.

332
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,379
Speaker 0: I don't know which one is Brawl and which one's Melee.

333
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,639
Speaker 1: Brawl is new, Melee's old.

334
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:21,394
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't even know that anymore because it's been so fucking long.

335
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,544
Speaker 1: Anyway, I could play that game again.

336
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,408
Speaker 1: Let's play that game.

337
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,694
Speaker 0: We suck so bad.

338
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,743
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we suck even worse than a street fight.

339
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:32,660
Speaker 1: You and me and our friends playing that game is fine, but Fox only whatever.

340
00:18:33,801 --> 00:18:44,714
Speaker 0: Anyway, so here's a video of a brawl snake verse Meta Knight, two characters that are not often used exclusively play peach or Meta Knight.

341
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,135
Speaker 0: Yeah.

342
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:46,900
Speaker 0: But anyway, not by us used often.

343
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:49,609
Speaker 0: So they're fighting one on one.

344
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,215
Speaker 0: It looks like on a map with no items.

345
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,166
Speaker 0: And what ends up happening is an epic, epic battle.

346
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:59,627
Speaker 0: I don't know if this is two people with insane, insane skills or if it was computer assisted or whatever.

347
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:03,984
Speaker 1: Does anyone make computer assisted like versus street fighters?

348
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:04,908
Speaker 0: I don't know.

349
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,977
Speaker 0: Is that we can have a contest, right?

350
00:19:07,037 --> 00:19:08,182
Speaker 0: A street fighter AI.

351
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:16,172
Speaker 0: Basically you take an Arduino, you plug it, you, the Arduino has one or the four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 14 inputs, right?

352
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:19,645
Speaker 0: The all the joystick and the six buttons and the start button.

353
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,115
Speaker 0: So 15, you have 15 outputs from your Arduino.

354
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,887
Speaker 0: The ticket, basically it is a programmable joystick.

355
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:28,201
Speaker 0: And then you have, how would it know what was going on on the screen?

356
00:19:28,221 --> 00:19:34,727
Speaker 1: I was thinking more the way they do it with any S ones where they just frame by frame the input in an emulator.

357
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,073
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess you have.

358
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:42,140
Speaker 0: the video output comes into your computer and then your computer sends a serial output to the Arduino, which is a joystick.

359
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:44,733
Speaker 0: And that goes into the joystick port.

360
00:19:44,753 --> 00:19:45,818
Speaker 0: Well, you know, there's super Nintendo.

361
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:53,537
Speaker 0: And then we can have a competition where you program the program that takes the video input and outputs the joystick output and has to beat the other guy at street fighter.

362
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:54,903
Speaker 0: And he is versus his pro.

363
00:19:54,923 --> 00:19:56,309
Speaker 1: You know, it'd be more interesting.

364
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:00,285
Speaker 0: I would just write one that does flow chart can exactly flow chart.

365
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:10,844
Speaker 1: I was going to say, why not just make one where you simply make a series of input for the game and then you put series of inputs together and just watch the tournament unfold.

366
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:12,229
Speaker 0: So you just, you don't know.

367
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:18,372
Speaker 0: You just try to pre inputted a loop basically because it has to loop at some point.

368
00:20:18,392 --> 00:20:22,569
Speaker 0: There's no decisions it can make versus the other guy's loop of street fighter moves.

369
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:26,222
Speaker 1: Every, every round of a match, you start the same loop.

370
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,171
Speaker 1: That would be interesting to watch.

371
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:35,291
Speaker 0: I would hold down and crouch back and kick at basically random intervals, right?

372
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:36,657
Speaker 1: That's how I fight in real life.

373
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:40,012
Speaker 1: Kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, hold back and crouch kicking random.

374
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:44,293
Speaker 0: And hopefully I would eventually do enough damage and avert enough damage that I would win.

375
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:44,957
Speaker 1: You know what I would do?

376
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:48,920
Speaker 1: Hadoken hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken, hadoken.

377
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,727
Speaker 0: So the other guy does the same thing.

378
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:56,232
Speaker 0: And now that you have two hadoken infinite loops, the fireballs keep canceling each other out until time runs out.

379
00:20:56,272 --> 00:21:01,532
Speaker 1: Did I input the hadoken in a way that would overlap them faster than the other guy?

380
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:04,946
Speaker 0: Uh, you, you have to figure out the timing of fastest hadoken.

381
00:21:05,227 --> 00:21:07,456
Speaker 1: I think the fireballs, I have a theory.

382
00:21:07,537 --> 00:21:10,049
Speaker 0: It would start moving closer and closer to the other guy.

383
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,356
Speaker 1: Here's a blast from the past.

384
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:13,766
Speaker 1: What is your theory of fastest hadoken?

385
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:18,402
Speaker 0: Uh, down, down, forward, forward button, down, down, forward, forward button.

386
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:19,487
Speaker 0: Anyway.

387
00:21:19,828 --> 00:21:20,110
Speaker 0: All right.

388
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:21,636
Speaker 1: This is a pretty epic fight.

389
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:23,847
Speaker 0: Whether this fight is real or not, it doesn't matter.

390
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:24,570
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

391
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:29,409
Speaker 0: Pretend two real people had this battle in Smash Brothers and it's epic.

392
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:30,452
Speaker 0: So worth watching.

393
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,936
Speaker 1: It is in fact quite epic.

394
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:34,887
Speaker 1: So I'm a big fan of the super cut.

395
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:43,846
Speaker 1: You know, every time someone says whatever in a movie, every time, you know, anything like that, every time a gun is fired, every time a guy says, well, it's the nineties.

396
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:54,186
Speaker 1: This one was false advertising, but it was enjoyable to watch nonetheless primarily because it's so long and so many of the scenes involving this thing are the same scene.

397
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:58,003
Speaker 0: It also includes many TV shows, which I think is cheating to go movies and TV shows.

398
00:21:58,023 --> 00:22:00,254
Speaker 1: They did not say it is a movie super cut.

399
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:05,314
Speaker 1: They said it is a super I guess, but it's still, you know, anyway, this is a super cut.

400
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:07,925
Speaker 1: It claims to be of people being hit by buses.

401
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:11,058
Speaker 0: Some of them were hit by cars, vans, ambulances and non buses.

402
00:22:11,219 --> 00:22:11,340
Speaker 0: Yep.

403
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,496
Speaker 1: But it is enjoyable on the left and it is left less and it is super long.

404
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:31,928
Speaker 1: And also really I think hit by a bus is the right thing to call this video because the manner in which all these people are hit in this video, if I were going to call that a trope in a movie, I would call it hit by a bus.

405
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:36,344
Speaker 1: It's always like someone's talking to someone and someone's walking away.

406
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:40,621
Speaker 0: This video is a super cut of people hit by a literal and or figurative bus.

407
00:22:40,702 --> 00:22:41,003
Speaker 0: Yes.

408
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,673
Speaker 1: Because someone's hit by a car in a movie.

409
00:22:43,693 --> 00:22:44,838
Speaker 0: That's different.

410
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:45,059
Speaker 0: Yeah.

411
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,305
Speaker 1: It's not this kind of scene.

412
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,191
Speaker 1: It's a very different kind of thing.

413
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:58,017
Speaker 1: This is like dudes backing up into the street, yelling at a girl and then ironically is hit by a bus at a funny moment or serious moment or like I'm going to tell the cops what you'd bus.

414
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:58,599
Speaker 1: Yep.

415
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,244
Speaker 1: It's that kind of scene.

416
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:02,572
Speaker 1: So maybe they meant hit by a bus.

417
00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:06,427
Speaker 1: in that sense in the meta moment Pax East is coming up.

418
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:07,612
Speaker 1: We're doing two panels.

419
00:23:07,732 --> 00:23:12,956
Speaker 0: I feel like there's a whole bunch of conventions and things like looming on me and I haven't done anything for any of them.

420
00:23:12,996 --> 00:23:16,190
Speaker 1: Pax East, Pax Aus, Kineticon, Anime, Boston.

421
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:17,717
Speaker 0: I haven't done anything for any of those.

422
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:18,701
Speaker 0: What should I do first?

423
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,908
Speaker 1: Pax East is coming first.

424
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,767
Speaker 1: Kineticon requires a lot of planning on our part, way more than the other ones.

425
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:28,003
Speaker 0: I feel like there's a whole bunch of shit I'm supposed to do that I haven't done.

426
00:23:28,023 --> 00:23:29,309
Speaker 0: Should I just bail on all of it?

427
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,315
Speaker 1: Anime Boston.

428
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,661
Speaker 1: We have to write the one.

429
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:37,084
Speaker 1: All our panels in Anime Boston are really easy except the really complicated one that we decided to do.

430
00:23:37,104 --> 00:23:38,870
Speaker 1: We need to get a lot of clips.

431
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,416
Speaker 0: We was your idea.

432
00:23:40,436 --> 00:23:41,781
Speaker 0: Decided we would do it.

433
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I said, Scott, this will be a lot of work.

434
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:45,680
Speaker 1: I remember this conversation.

435
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,246
Speaker 1: We had it like three months ago.

436
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,700
Speaker 1: Scott, this is a great idea, but it'll take a lot of work.

437
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,225
Speaker 1: Are you sure you want to do it?

438
00:23:52,245 --> 00:23:55,016
Speaker 1: You said, yes, we have got plenty of time.

439
00:23:55,558 --> 00:23:59,838
Speaker 1: Let's just make sure we start on it soon and don't wait until a month before Anime Boston.

440
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,626
Speaker 0: When we did that, we had a lot of time.

441
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,236
Speaker 1: We have at least two months before Anime Boston.

442
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,203
Speaker 0: Let's get on.

443
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:07,288
Speaker 0: Let's do it the week in advance.

444
00:24:07,911 --> 00:24:09,258
Speaker 1: The Book Club book was The Great Gatsby.

445
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:09,700
Speaker 1: We read it.

446
00:24:09,721 --> 00:24:10,906
Speaker 1: We're doing a show on it soon.

447
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,778
Speaker 1: You should have read it if you haven't already.

448
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,025
Speaker 0: You probably have two weeks to read it.

449
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,157
Speaker 1: You could easily finish it before we do the show.

450
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:18,323
Speaker 1: It's a very short book.

451
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:20,252
Speaker 0: It takes like a day or two to read it.

452
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,964
Speaker 1: We got a bunch of videos up, forum, all that stuff.

453
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:23,386
Speaker 0: Yeah.

454
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,853
Speaker 1: And there's a blizzard coming.

455
00:24:24,893 --> 00:24:27,986
Speaker 1: So if New York City disappears off the radar, there won't be a show on Monday.

456
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:32,244
Speaker 0: Also, uh, I've been going to this Android net runner meetup in the city.

457
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:32,907
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

458
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:33,771
Speaker 1: Just go to one soon.

459
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:40,076
Speaker 0: If I can, if you just go to Google and search for net runner NYC, you'll find a, probably the top link will be a meetup.com link.

460
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,166
Speaker 0: And they apparently they go to this cafe every Tuesday and Friday.

461
00:24:44,206 --> 00:24:45,248
Speaker 0: And there's also tournaments.

462
00:24:45,288 --> 00:25:08,024
Speaker 0: The 16th, which is not this Saturday, but the next Saturday, the non blizzard Saturday, a basically the way the tournament work last time is you show up with a deck of each, you pay five bucks, you play according to the official tournament rules and everyone just sort of had plays net runner all day.

463
00:25:08,044 --> 00:25:08,445
Speaker 0: and that's it.

464
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:10,032
Speaker 1: Is there a prize?

465
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,417
Speaker 0: A very small prize.

466
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:12,400
Speaker 1: Is it more than $5?

467
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,761
Speaker 1: Uh, yes.

468
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:24,212
Speaker 0: It's more than $5 worth because I think the prize last time was that you get the next data pack for nothing from the strat.

469
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:27,925
Speaker 0: And also I think the top prize winner got like some action tokens.

470
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:36,759
Speaker 1: When I was in middle school, I had a friend who actually would run kind of for middle schoolers, high stakes, like invite only magic tournaments.

471
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:40,271
Speaker 1: Everyone would buy in with 20 or 30 bucks and the winner took all the twenties.

472
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:40,812
Speaker 0: Yes.

473
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:45,373
Speaker 1: He would take a 10% cut because he ran it in his house and his mom provided snacks.

474
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,242
Speaker 0: All these dollars I think go to Strad.

475
00:25:47,804 --> 00:25:48,446
Speaker 0: That's fine.

476
00:25:48,486 --> 00:25:49,128
Speaker 1: I like the Strad.

477
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:49,289
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:25:49,329 --> 00:25:49,590
Speaker 0: Anyway.

479
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:52,259
Speaker 0: Uh, so that's all the meta moment.

480
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,768
Speaker 0: Let's get to the main man.

481
00:25:56,009 --> 00:26:00,842
Speaker 1: Now I want to preface this entire conversation by something that is very important.

482
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:03,452
Speaker 1: We're talking about the fake nerd girl thing.

483
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:04,054
Speaker 0: Yeah.

484
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:04,697
Speaker 1: Don't get it.

485
00:26:04,757 --> 00:26:05,861
Speaker 1: We are talking about that.

486
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:07,909
Speaker 0: That's right.

487
00:26:07,949 --> 00:26:14,495
Speaker 0: Because it's something, the reason we're talking about it is because number one, it's something the whole internet of nerdery is raging about.

488
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:19,912
Speaker 0: So hopefully this will be controversial and generate lots of discussions and also lots of hits.

489
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:20,434
Speaker 0: Yes.

490
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:27,320
Speaker 0: Two, we have an opinion on the issue and that is different from everyone else's opinion and therefore, right.

491
00:26:30,902 --> 00:26:32,870
Speaker 0: Three, it'll be a really good episode.

492
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,231
Speaker 0: We hope.

493
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:39,134
Speaker 1: I think it'll be a pretty good episode, but no, I have another three that there is legitimate rage about this issue.

494
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:45,221
Speaker 1: Like it's not like there are, yeah, there are people out there not going to be our typical, why are you people talking about this?

495
00:26:45,261 --> 00:26:47,310
Speaker 1: No, this is a legit thing that we need to talk about.

496
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:51,444
Speaker 0: Okay, so let's, let's roll all the way to the backist backstory.

497
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:53,610
Speaker 0: So the backist back story is.

498
00:26:54,191 --> 00:27:01,914
Speaker 0: there are, as we know, sexist piece of shit people in the nerd community, especially nerd conventions of all kinds.

499
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:02,998
Speaker 1: Disagree with this.

500
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:05,929
Speaker 0: I take umbrage sir with your opinion.

501
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:07,535
Speaker 0: And of course also the internet.

502
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:09,502
Speaker 0: There are many sexist piece of shit people.

503
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:14,802
Speaker 0: and these sexist piece of shit people, what they have done is they're one of the things that they do.

504
00:27:15,463 --> 00:27:20,556
Speaker 0: is they believe in a crazy conspiracy theory, much like the people in rims news.

505
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:44,659
Speaker 0: and the crazy conspiracy theory they believe is that when cute girls go to conventions, cosplaying or doing nerdery that many, if not all of them don't actually like those nerdy things that they are simply using their feminine wiles to infiltrate and pose or up to no good something.

506
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,203
Speaker 0: And they're not actually geeks.

507
00:27:46,724 --> 00:27:56,129
Speaker 0: They are fake nerd girls because what girl needs to put on airs to attract geeky guys who have never seen a vagina in their lives?

508
00:27:57,132 --> 00:28:01,405
Speaker 1: That is not the because they will say, but that's the because that they know in their hearts.

509
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:01,906
Speaker 0: Yes.

510
00:28:02,387 --> 00:28:13,159
Speaker 1: Now, before we go any further, those people, irrespective of everything we're about to say, are sexist assholes and you should Brooke them.

511
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,922
Speaker 1: No sympathy.

512
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:14,644
Speaker 0: Exactly.

513
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:26,042
Speaker 0: So of course, the second part of the story in opposition to these piece of shit people, the good people of the internet come back and point the finger at them and say, you piece of shit people.

514
00:28:26,243 --> 00:28:35,130
Speaker 0: And they get mad, indignant and angry as per the incredibly accurate Penny Arcade comic, which I will now, which I will now read to you.

515
00:28:35,251 --> 00:28:38,502
Speaker 1: That was all of the most recent Penny Arcades.

516
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:40,770
Speaker 0: I'd like this has been the best Penny Arcade in months.

517
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,774
Speaker 1: I laughed out loud.

518
00:28:41,794 --> 00:28:45,808
Speaker 0: So in panel one, Gabe and Tyco, you can see this for yourself.

519
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,296
Speaker 1: Well, reading of a Penny Arcade, of course.

520
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,017
Speaker 0: So in panel one, Gabe and Tyco are sitting in a diner eating some fries and ketchup and shakes.

521
00:28:54,418 --> 00:28:59,153
Speaker 0: And Gabe says, I think Cheetos girlfriend is one of those fake geek girls.

522
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:05,036
Speaker 0: And Tyco says, all right, so Gabe in this comic, always being the bad guy is playing the part of the sexist piece of shit.

523
00:29:05,498 --> 00:29:07,908
Speaker 0: And Tyco is playing the part of the good people of the internet.

524
00:29:07,949 --> 00:29:14,922
Speaker 0: And he said, Tyco says, I'm going to use some words now that you might not be familiar with, but I want you to promise me that you'll look them up when I'm done.

525
00:29:14,942 --> 00:29:18,391
Speaker 0: And then the second panel Tyco continues.

526
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:24,488
Speaker 0: Listen up, Satan, who are you to assess her credentials as a woman or a gamer.

527
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,832
Speaker 0: There is no gate.

528
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:27,196
Speaker 0: You're not the gatekeeper.

529
00:29:27,598 --> 00:29:30,226
Speaker 0: So go drink some bad poison and shit out your life.

530
00:29:30,748 --> 00:29:41,305
Speaker 0: And then in the third panel, the punchline Cheeto is standing there with his fake geek girlfriend, who is a literal person made of straw with some glasses, lipstick, you know what she is?

531
00:29:41,405 --> 00:29:42,329
Speaker 0: Scarf and Batman.

532
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:46,222
Speaker 1: I think this is a crossover with the bracken from Ogloff.

533
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:47,505
Speaker 0: Sure.

534
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:49,429
Speaker 0: Right.

535
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:55,020
Speaker 0: The point here being there is no such thing as the fake geek girl, right?

536
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,965
Speaker 0: It is this imaginary thing.

537
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:57,507
Speaker 0: And yes.

538
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:59,433
Speaker 0: Who are you to assess?

539
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:02,642
Speaker 0: Who is anyone to assess another person's credentials?

540
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:08,199
Speaker 0: as a woman gamer, you know, even bring race into it, bring anything you want, right?

541
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,725
Speaker 0: Who is any person to assess someone else's credentials in anything except maybe a scientist judging someone's credentials as a sign.

542
00:30:15,745 --> 00:30:23,471
Speaker 1: Now, case in point, do football fans complain about the fake football girls who put on a jersey for the Super Bowl?

543
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:25,017
Speaker 1: No, they don't out and watch.

544
00:30:25,218 --> 00:30:26,081
Speaker 0: No, they do not.

545
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:33,149
Speaker 1: Do they turn to the girl who's hanging out with them to watch the Super Bowl, who may not be a huge fan of football, but is, you know, where?

546
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:40,978
Speaker 0: these people who are watching the football may indeed be also sexist assholes, possibly, but not always, but they keep it on the inside.

547
00:30:40,998 --> 00:30:43,949
Speaker 0: They don't say to some girl wearing a football jersey.

548
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,656
Speaker 1: Well, what's a two point conversion?

549
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:46,961
Speaker 1: When does the safety happen?

550
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:48,368
Speaker 0: Instead, they want to teach them.

551
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:53,770
Speaker 0: They say, hey, let me tell you what a two point conversion is, baby, which is also sexist, but assuming she doesn't know.

552
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:56,800
Speaker 0: But still, they don't have this thing.

553
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,928
Speaker 0: This is a unique thing to the nerdery sector.

554
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:02,715
Speaker 1: Now, I think that there's already.

555
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:07,170
Speaker 1: the fake geek girl or fake nerd girl argument already has too many preassumptions.

556
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,849
Speaker 1: Preassumption number one, why are we calling them fake nerd or geek girls?

557
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,520
Speaker 1: I'm going to use geek as the word for the rest of this discussion.

558
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,943
Speaker 1: So I have to keep saying geek or nerd.

559
00:31:16,865 --> 00:31:22,880
Speaker 1: So why is it a fake geek girl as opposed to a fake anime fan?

560
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,120
Speaker 0: Well, some people, some people say that they'll say fake gamer, fake, you know, you know, fake gamer girl.

561
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,144
Speaker 0: I've heard being said.

562
00:31:29,164 --> 00:31:29,625
Speaker 0: Right.

563
00:31:29,686 --> 00:31:30,609
Speaker 0: And it's not just girl.

564
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:30,910
Speaker 0: Right.

565
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,536
Speaker 0: It's it could be anything.

566
00:31:32,656 --> 00:31:38,914
Speaker 1: I've never seen it actually be not a girl in the recent conversations that people are doing this.

567
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:44,311
Speaker 1: I, I've literally never seen someone call someone else a fake gamer if they were a dude.

568
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:44,974
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

569
00:31:45,014 --> 00:31:54,830
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point here, right, that the good people are making on this side, the well-intentioned, well-meaning people who, if you have not foreseen, you know, we still disagree with on some sense.

570
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:55,492
Speaker 0: Right.

571
00:31:56,114 --> 00:32:06,170
Speaker 0: Is that, look, if somebody says that they like something, someone says they like Final Fantasy and they're not saying it in a sarcastic or sly way, who is anyone to disbelieve them?

572
00:32:06,211 --> 00:32:10,143
Speaker 0: You can't know what the person feels or thinks when they see Final Fantasy.

573
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:10,825
Speaker 0: Right.

574
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,213
Speaker 0: If they say they like it, you know, it's.

575
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:15,340
Speaker 0: it's not an objective thing you can argue.

576
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:16,022
Speaker 0: Right.

577
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:20,738
Speaker 0: Like you could say, no, Final Fantasy six was called Final Fantasy three in the US.

578
00:32:20,758 --> 00:32:22,645
Speaker 0: That's an objective fact that you can discuss.

579
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:24,272
Speaker 0: And there really is no argument.

580
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:24,915
Speaker 0: It's just a fact.

581
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:28,289
Speaker 0: But if someone says they like Final Fantasy, you can't argue with it.

582
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,920
Speaker 1: Now, if you disagree, everyone likes different things.

583
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,029
Speaker 0: They express their taste.

584
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,593
Speaker 0: That is their taste.

585
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,476
Speaker 0: There's no dispute.

586
00:32:36,516 --> 00:32:54,440
Speaker 0: If someone says they like games and if that means that that the label of gamer is an appropriate application, as in someone who likes games is a gamer, then someone who says they like games is a gamer, whether you, you know, whatever they know or whatever you want to challenge them on or what, you know, now that's all there is to it.

587
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:04,819
Speaker 1: This is why I really want to talk about the idea of the fake nerd specifically, because in this case, all right, so someone could say I, you know, you said someone likes something.

588
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:07,309
Speaker 1: you cannot impinge upon someone saying they like something.

589
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:07,831
Speaker 1: Exactly.

590
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:08,534
Speaker 1: I like cosplay.

591
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:09,317
Speaker 1: I like anime.

592
00:33:09,437 --> 00:33:10,040
Speaker 1: I like games.

593
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:11,822
Speaker 0: I like cowboy Viva.

594
00:33:11,842 --> 00:33:17,132
Speaker 1: Since when does liking in any way imply geek?

595
00:33:17,553 --> 00:33:17,974
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

596
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:20,378
Speaker 1: Liking implies fan.

597
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:29,660
Speaker 1: If I say I am a fan of games, it doesn't matter at all if I know almost nothing about games.

598
00:33:29,861 --> 00:33:31,627
Speaker 1: I like games.

599
00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:32,471
Speaker 1: I like the idea of games.

600
00:33:32,491 --> 00:33:34,538
Speaker 1: That's what the word fan is to be used for.

601
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:35,783
Speaker 1: We have a word for this.

602
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:36,084
Speaker 0: Yep.

603
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:50,668
Speaker 0: And the thing is, right, I think what's happening here is that there are many people in the world, many, many who are fans of things and the things that they are fans of are traditionally domains of geekery.

604
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:53,615
Speaker 0: For example, a fan of Star Trek, right?

605
00:33:54,136 --> 00:33:57,768
Speaker 0: That most people put a fan of Star Trek as a geek, right?

606
00:33:57,808 --> 00:34:00,377
Speaker 0: Because that is a geeky thing to like, right?

607
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:00,979
Speaker 0: Star Trek.

608
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,264
Speaker 0: It's pretty nerdy and geeky.

609
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,054
Speaker 0: So therefore, if you like it, that makes you a geek.

610
00:34:05,155 --> 00:34:13,043
Speaker 0: So because we can't dispute you liking it and you do like it, you say you like it, that makes you an automatic geek because you like Star Trek.

611
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:29,181
Speaker 1: So what you're saying and what I'm saying, what we're saying here is that things that are traditionally the purview of nerdy basement dudes and, you know, nerdy geeky, sort of colloquial like things that those kinds of people are into that quote unquote normal people are not into.

612
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:35,621
Speaker 1: If someone is into one of those things, then they are therefore one of those kinds of people.

613
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:45,730
Speaker 0: Ah, and here's the thing is that kind of person, that basement dweller, when he sees someone who is a fan of the same thing he is a fan of, right?

614
00:34:46,331 --> 00:35:01,231
Speaker 0: Yet that person, you know, is trying to label themselves the same labels he labels himself with and be in the same group, the same, you know, community as him, but yet is not actually the same as him.

615
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:08,432
Speaker 0: He is feeling threatened or infringed upon or that the other person is an opposer or fake in some way.

616
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:22,815
Speaker 1: Now I've run into this firsthand and it still really seems to only affect nerds because if you are a fan of something and you are deeply into it and you're a stereotypical nerd because that seems to be the kind of...

617
00:35:22,835 --> 00:35:23,457
Speaker 0: Who does exist.

618
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:24,863
Speaker 0: We've met that person many times.

619
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:28,740
Speaker 1: And those kinds of stereotypical nerdy people tend to also be kind of sexist.

620
00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:29,341
Speaker 0: No.

621
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:41,600
Speaker 1: Partly due to the fact that their hobbies, there is a sexist society, obviously, that, you know, there's no physical reason why more guys are into, say, comic books from the beginning than girls.

622
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:41,920
Speaker 1: Nope.

623
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:43,488
Speaker 1: There's social and cultural and all these...

624
00:35:43,568 --> 00:35:49,752
Speaker 0: It just so happens that most comic books are cheesecake superhero nonsense that no girl would want to read.

625
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:49,832
Speaker 0: Yep.

626
00:35:50,534 --> 00:35:52,541
Speaker 0: And a few girls would want to read.

627
00:35:53,023 --> 00:35:54,106
Speaker 0: But so there are many who do.

628
00:35:54,146 --> 00:36:10,600
Speaker 1: The people who were traditionally stereotypically in popular culture into those things and were socially awkward would have to sort of band together like you'd find the one other comic fan in your neighborhood and you knew that they were just like you because they like the same thing as you because no normal person would like that thing.

629
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:16,592
Speaker 1: And that ridiculous mentality has somehow survived into the year 2013.

630
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:16,933
Speaker 1: Somehow.

631
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:25,082
Speaker 1: So those people who are super... And you see this, like look at the Street Fighter guys who are like super into the tournament scene.

632
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:34,786
Speaker 1: There's a deep and surprising and really open sexist bent to the community of semi-professional Street Fighter tournament types.

633
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:44,869
Speaker 1: Professional gaming in general, you know, has a but they're also really hostile toward people who want to learn their hobby but aren't good at it.

634
00:36:47,321 --> 00:36:49,128
Speaker 1: And somehow that culture maintains...

635
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:53,724
Speaker 0: Obviously all these generalizations aren't 100% true, right?

636
00:36:54,286 --> 00:37:03,279
Speaker 0: But it's big enough, it's true enough of enough people of a great enough percentage that it is a problem in the community that is worthy of discussing and combating.

637
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:04,543
Speaker 1: Well, like let's put it this way.

638
00:37:05,547 --> 00:37:06,711
Speaker 1: I've been to nightclubs.

639
00:37:07,012 --> 00:37:08,980
Speaker 1: I've been to dances and raves and things.

640
00:37:09,663 --> 00:37:12,695
Speaker 1: I've been to many conventions, professional, non-professional, fan, whatever.

641
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:16,749
Speaker 1: How come anime cons smell like shit way more than any other con?

642
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,395
Speaker 0: That is a fact.

643
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:23,614
Speaker 1: The reasons behind it, but there is a correlation to an anime cons and smelly people.

644
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:24,779
Speaker 0: There is no question about that.

645
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,997
Speaker 1: So to get back to the definition of geek or nerd, I'm a geek/nerd.

646
00:37:31,017 --> 00:37:31,438
Speaker 1: I'm a geek.

647
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:32,822
Speaker 0: There is no disputing that.

648
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:34,006
Speaker 0: I care about...

649
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:43,415
Speaker 1: I have deep interests in a relatively narrow set of areas and as a result, I have a lot of knowledge about those areas.

650
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:47,836
Speaker 1: I also... One of the things that I'm a geek or nerd about... I guess I said I was going to not say geek or nerd.

651
00:37:47,876 --> 00:37:49,001
Speaker 1: I keep saying geek or nerd.

652
00:37:49,042 --> 00:37:49,403
Speaker 0: XCOM?

653
00:37:50,647 --> 00:37:52,452
Speaker 1: No, I was going to say language.

654
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,194
Speaker 0: Marching bands?

655
00:37:53,435 --> 00:37:56,223
Speaker 1: I'm really into grammar, like for real.

656
00:37:56,243 --> 00:37:59,059
Speaker 1: Like I really care about style and writing and things like this.

657
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,224
Speaker 0: Eats, shoots, and leaves.

658
00:38:00,947 --> 00:38:04,180
Speaker 1: So the lively art of writing is the book that I would ascribe to.

659
00:38:04,941 --> 00:38:09,855
Speaker 1: So as a result, I care also about nomenclature, which comes in from science.

660
00:38:10,578 --> 00:38:13,166
Speaker 1: You know, binomial nomenclature, how we classify animals.

661
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:20,330
Speaker 1: We say Pluto is no longer a planet because if we call Pluto a planet, the word planet means fucking nothing.

662
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,811
Speaker 0: That's right.

663
00:38:20,831 --> 00:38:29,643
Speaker 0: If you have a word, it needs to have a clear definition that differs it from other words, otherwise the word kind of becomes useless.

664
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:38,298
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the word game means so many things that it's not useful for argument or debate or intellectual discussions anymore because the meaning is so broad.

665
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:40,466
Speaker 1: So we'll say orthogame or casual game.

666
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:47,295
Speaker 0: We'll come up with a new term or we'll define our terms beforehand, you know, so that people are clear about what we're discussing.

667
00:38:47,316 --> 00:38:57,851
Speaker 1: But like, for example, the word punch, hit, strike, kick, they're all... They all mean similar things, but yet they have nuance and they have specific sort of differences.

668
00:38:58,152 --> 00:39:01,590
Speaker 1: If they actually literally meant the same thing, then we wouldn't have different words.

669
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:01,772
Speaker 0: Yeah.

670
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:04,792
Speaker 0: And there's no one claiming like, was that a punch or was it not a punch?

671
00:39:05,013 --> 00:39:07,708
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes... His fist was kind of half closed?

672
00:39:07,768 --> 00:39:11,185
Speaker 1: In law, we have that distinction between an open-handed and closed-handed strike.

673
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:12,170
Speaker 0: What if it's half opened?

674
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,160
Speaker 0: What if my pinky finger's out?

675
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,720
Speaker 1: Well, then the judge has to decide if there's ambiguity.

676
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,321
Speaker 0: Right.

677
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:21,060
Speaker 1: Usually they'll define one type and then everything else is the other type.

678
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,000
Speaker 0: What if I make a fist, but I swing it sideways like a slap?

679
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:29,686
Speaker 1: Ah, but at the same time, what if we have a definition of a closed fist and we have higher punishments for closed fist?

680
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:33,604
Speaker 1: Because that implies probably more intent to harm than an open fist slap.

681
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:37,920
Speaker 1: But in many martial arts, an open-handed strike is actually more powerful.

682
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,167
Speaker 0: Quite possibly.

683
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:43,286
Speaker 1: Now, what we just had is a stereotypically nerdy conversation.

684
00:39:45,574 --> 00:39:46,858
Speaker 0: Because we are those people.

685
00:39:46,898 --> 00:39:48,545
Speaker 0: We do a podcast called Geek Nights.

686
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,160
Speaker 0: We've been doing it for six years, if not seven years.

687
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,967
Speaker 1: We've been doing it since Halloween 2005.

688
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:53,348
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

689
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,348
Speaker 1: We used to do that shit four nights a week.

690
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:02,044
Speaker 0: So actually seven or eight, seven going on eight years.

691
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:06,439
Speaker 1: I've been doing Geek Nights longer than I've been doing anything else in my entire life except masturbating.

692
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,740
Speaker 0: Except adding all the elementary, middle, and high school together.

693
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:11,884
Speaker 1: Wow.

694
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:15,389
Speaker 0: Any one of those schools I spent less time in than I spent doing Geek Nights.

695
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:23,412
Speaker 1: So what I'm getting at here is that if we already have... It's going to sound like I'm justifying the people who are saying there are fake geeks.

696
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:23,473
Speaker 0: No.

697
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,502
Speaker 1: I'm not.

698
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:25,546
Speaker 1: Hear me out.

699
00:40:25,867 --> 00:40:29,120
Speaker 1: The problem with complex opinions is they don't travel well meme-wise.

700
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:29,903
Speaker 0: No, they don't.

701
00:40:30,023 --> 00:40:35,251
Speaker 0: Because again, people will misconstrue what you're saying due to definitions of words.

702
00:40:35,834 --> 00:40:40,733
Speaker 1: And again, to reiterate, the people who talk about fake nerd girls, 99.9% of the time are sexist douchebags.

703
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,242
Speaker 0: That's right.

704
00:40:43,904 --> 00:40:50,749
Speaker 1: So if we have a word fan that already means someone likes something.

705
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,136
Speaker 1: I like cosplay.

706
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:53,020
Speaker 1: I like anime.

707
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:06,763
Speaker 1: You cannot in any way impinge upon that opinion unless you have objective evidence that that person has literally never seen or has literally no understanding of what the word they say they like actually means.

708
00:41:06,783 --> 00:41:13,611
Speaker 1: If I say I like charmed quarks, and I literally don't know what a quark is.

709
00:41:13,651 --> 00:41:14,639
Speaker 0: What is a charmed quark?

710
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,028
Speaker 0: And then I look at I'm winning a video and you don't know what it is, then sure, you're not a fan of charmed quarks.

711
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:22,340
Speaker 1: That situation really doesn't exist.

712
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,268
Speaker 0: If you say you like Star Wars and you know you can recognize Jabba the Hutt, you can pick him out of a lineup.

713
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:29,254
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

714
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:30,784
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure you're a fan of Star Wars.

715
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:31,709
Speaker 0: Who are we to challenge you?

716
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:41,360
Speaker 1: Hell, if you don't know the name of any character in Star Wars, but you saw it once and liked it, or you just like the idea of space opera and you know Star Wars that and you say, yeah, I like things like Star Wars.

717
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:44,660
Speaker 1: Still, you really can't impinge too deeply upon that opinion.

718
00:41:44,881 --> 00:41:45,043
Speaker 0: Nope.

719
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,840
Speaker 0: There's nothing you can say to challenge that.

720
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:57,119
Speaker 0: And if you do try to challenge someone who says they like something, honestly, even if maybe they are lying and who knows why anyone would do that, because I have never met anyone who's ever done that ever.

721
00:41:59,102 --> 00:41:59,929
Speaker 0: Why are you doing that?

722
00:41:59,949 --> 00:42:01,340
Speaker 0: You're just a jerk, right?

723
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:06,285
Speaker 0: If someone comes up to me and says they like Star Trek and I say, you've never seen Star Trek.

724
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:10,839
Speaker 0: I'm just an asshole, whether they've seen Star Trek or not.

725
00:42:11,722 --> 00:42:13,680
Speaker 1: I don't think any of our listeners look at that reference.

726
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,220
Speaker 0: That is why it is there to weed out the true nerds from the fans in the games.

727
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,088
Speaker 1: So we have a word for that already.

728
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:36,460
Speaker 1: If I dress up as a character and go to a convention, I'm clearly a fan of either that character or costuming of some kind or acting or something.

729
00:42:36,801 --> 00:42:39,833
Speaker 0: If you didn't like doing it, why would you do it?

730
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:40,616
Speaker 1: Maybe I'm doing.

731
00:42:40,656 --> 00:42:43,048
Speaker 0: it is even more evidence than saying you like doing it.

732
00:42:43,068 --> 00:42:46,403
Speaker 1: I guess we could say there are fake nerd girls, like fake cosplayers.

733
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:59,114
Speaker 1: If a company that was trying to promote an anime hired girls to dress up to basically be booth babes and cosplay and wander around a convention that don't know about it, would be by definition a fake.

734
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:00,299
Speaker 0: I guess it wouldn't necessarily.

735
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:12,817
Speaker 0: I mean, it depends what your definition of the word fake is, but yes, that would be a person who is in some way physically appearing to be a fan or geek about a intellectual property.

736
00:43:12,837 --> 00:43:13,860
Speaker 0: that is not actually.

737
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:14,401
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

738
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:15,064
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

739
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:16,810
Speaker 1: I would suggest.

740
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:21,366
Speaker 0: A lot of people do get paid to do it when they do like it.

741
00:43:21,386 --> 00:43:29,530
Speaker 1: Do you believe in your heart that there, that anyone who has ever complained about a fake nerd girl has ever complained about a booth, babe?

742
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:30,272
Speaker 0: No.

743
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:33,481
Speaker 0: So that would be a very few people.

744
00:43:34,565 --> 00:43:36,772
Speaker 0: So that would be almost zero people.

745
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:42,874
Speaker 1: If there's even one, if we say that the word fan is unimpingable, I label myself as a fan of something.

746
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:44,821
Speaker 1: There's really no way to argue against that.

747
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:49,988
Speaker 1: You could argue that that thing is not good, but that's a totally separate conversation that nerds have all the time.

748
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:57,391
Speaker 1: We love talking about why we hate the thing you like, but what then Scott does nerd or geek mean?

749
00:43:57,431 --> 00:44:00,079
Speaker 1: If I say I am a geek, what does that mean?

750
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,784
Speaker 0: Well, we discussed this in a very long episode ago and we discuss it not as often because it's sort of a sealed deal, right?

751
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:13,325
Speaker 0: And, but surprisingly many people, even though this deal has been sealed, sort of are still confused.

752
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:18,387
Speaker 0: So let us go over this same topic again because the internet needs to get the records straight.

753
00:44:18,528 --> 00:44:19,494
Speaker 0: It's not going to matter though.

754
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:21,768
Speaker 0: This isn't going to set anyone straight except maybe two listeners.

755
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:24,262
Speaker 1: The definition we kind of use, but really it doesn't matter.

756
00:44:24,322 --> 00:44:25,930
Speaker 1: Nerd and geek are synonyms.

757
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,160
Speaker 1: We distinguish them just because we're nerds.

758
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,102
Speaker 0: That's right.

759
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:39,232
Speaker 0: So, so what a nerd is, at least by our definition, is somebody who has a deep, deep knowledge of one or extremely few number of areas.

760
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:45,973
Speaker 0: For example, that guy who knows everything there is to know about Star Trek, but doesn't know anything else.

761
00:44:46,274 --> 00:44:49,743
Speaker 0: He's typically so not even, regardless, right?

762
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:59,053
Speaker 0: Socially awkward, usually of high intellectual knowledge, like very good at school or maths or science, right?

763
00:44:59,173 --> 00:45:00,900
Speaker 1: See, already we disagree a little bit.

764
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,280
Speaker 0: Okay.

765
00:45:01,361 --> 00:45:03,628
Speaker 0: That is, that is the nerd person.

766
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,262
Speaker 1: I think of geeks nerd as being a hyper-focused geek, a geek to me.

767
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:09,165
Speaker 0: That's sort of what that is.

768
00:45:09,266 --> 00:45:14,283
Speaker 1: But I don't attach to nerd socially awkward or any of that stuff.

769
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:18,053
Speaker 1: That is a separate application of the word dork.

770
00:45:18,073 --> 00:45:20,661
Speaker 0: You want to move that over to dork?

771
00:45:20,701 --> 00:45:20,882
Speaker 0: Yeah.

772
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:24,052
Speaker 1: You can be dorky nerd or a cool nerd or dweebus.

773
00:45:25,577 --> 00:45:26,479
Speaker 1: I don't know what the difference is.

774
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,075
Speaker 1: I know what a doofus is, but I don't know the difference between a dork and a dweeb.

775
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:45,668
Speaker 0: Anyway, but you know, a geek is someone who does have deep knowledge of one or more areas, but compared to a nerd, they're usually into more areas, shallower in all of those areas, still deep relative to most people.

776
00:45:45,728 --> 00:45:48,536
Speaker 1: Scott and I are game theory geeks.

777
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:48,937
Speaker 1: Dr.

778
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,944
Speaker 1: Hazard is a game theory nerd.

779
00:45:50,984 --> 00:45:51,626
Speaker 0: That is right.

780
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:54,799
Speaker 0: His knowledge of game theory pretty much goes as deep as anyone's.

781
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,091
Speaker 0: Our knowledge is deeper than most people.

782
00:45:57,111 --> 00:46:01,471
Speaker 0: The fact that we even know it exists is deeper than most people, but it goes kind of deeper than most people.

783
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:02,777
Speaker 0: But do we really know about it?

784
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:03,400
Speaker 1: Fuck no.

785
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,663
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Dr.

786
00:46:04,703 --> 00:46:08,380
Speaker 1: Hazard doesn't know a whole lot about anime, nor would I expect him to.

787
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:11,130
Speaker 0: He's probably not even an anime fan.

788
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:12,739
Speaker 0: I have no idea how much anime he's seen.

789
00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:16,784
Speaker 1: In fact, Hint, if you have a doctorate in anything, you're probably a nerd and whatever it is, you've got to doctor it in.

790
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:16,985
Speaker 1: Yeah.

791
00:46:17,045 --> 00:46:21,022
Speaker 0: Geekery and nerdery applies to different topical areas, right?

792
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,529
Speaker 0: You know, you can be like a cream, right?

793
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:27,991
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, yeah, it's like you're an ex villain, the ex nerd or ex geek, right?

794
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:30,640
Speaker 0: You can actually be a nerd and a geek simultaneously.

795
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:33,904
Speaker 1: Simultaneously.

796
00:46:34,165 --> 00:46:48,221
Speaker 1: I mean, only recently would I say that we have transitioned like in the last four or five years from anime nerds to anime geeks, primarily because we don't watch nearly as much anime as we used to and don't pay nearly as much attention to the background of it as we used to.

797
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:50,209
Speaker 1: We know our focus has shifted.

798
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:57,554
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm rapidly going down the road of being like game design, game nerd, not game theory nerd, but game nerd.

799
00:46:57,574 --> 00:46:58,597
Speaker 1: But anyway, digression.

800
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:11,185
Speaker 1: So we, so geeks and nerds are just people who not only are a fan of a thing, but have sign of deep knowledge about that thing and deep interest in continuing to further their knowledge of said thing.

801
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,120
Speaker 1: The fan of Lord of the Rings really likes the Lord of the Rings.

802
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:24,643
Speaker 1: The nerd of Lord of the Rings can name all the dwarves and remembers their histories from the Hobbit and ties them into references in the Lord of the Rings and can quote the Simarillion at you.

803
00:47:24,904 --> 00:47:25,326
Speaker 0: Exactly.

804
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:32,611
Speaker 1: So Lord of the Rings geek can tell you the entire plot and name most of the characters, but doesn't remember Radagast.

805
00:47:32,953 --> 00:47:33,153
Speaker 0: Right.

806
00:47:33,173 --> 00:47:36,545
Speaker 0: So for example, let us take something we are both familiar with, right?

807
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:39,175
Speaker 0: Uh, Neon Genesis Evangelion, right?

808
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:39,617
Speaker 0: All right.

809
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:41,042
Speaker 0: I've seen that a bunch of times.

810
00:47:41,142 --> 00:47:43,370
Speaker 1: I've seen that entire show five times.

811
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:44,735
Speaker 0: I'm a huge fan of it.

812
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:46,200
Speaker 0: I enjoy it very much.

813
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,065
Speaker 0: I am a geek of that show.

814
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:49,892
Speaker 0: I know many things about it.

815
00:47:50,394 --> 00:47:54,993
Speaker 0: Uh, mostly because I've watched it so many times, but I've also read many Wikipedia and internets.

816
00:47:55,013 --> 00:47:59,833
Speaker 1: I would say you're on the deeper end of geek because you also know about the people who made Evangelion.

817
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:00,315
Speaker 0: I do.

818
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,925
Speaker 0: I know the name of the director is Hideaki Anno.

819
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:03,446
Speaker 0: I know that.

820
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:03,928
Speaker 0: Yeah.

821
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:07,338
Speaker 0: Uh, but rim, how many angels are there?

822
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:08,360
Speaker 1: 13.

823
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,769
Speaker 0: I think it's 12 or 13, right?

824
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:10,332
Speaker 0: But it's like, I don't know.

825
00:48:10,352 --> 00:48:11,298
Speaker 0: I'm not even that sure.

826
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:11,640
Speaker 0: Right?

827
00:48:12,021 --> 00:48:14,469
Speaker 0: So it's like any one piece of trivia.

828
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:16,275
Speaker 0: you might ask, even someone

829
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:25,596
Speaker 1: like us, I'm glad you said the word trivia because I was going to say that one of the biggest ways to say if someone is a nerd geek and our definition is if they are good at trivia on their thing,

830
00:48:25,616 --> 00:48:28,045
Speaker 0: right now, any single piece of trivia, right?

831
00:48:28,145 --> 00:48:36,996
Speaker 0: Is not going to determine whether someone truly has a deep or extremely deep knowledge in an area to determine if they are truly a geek or nerd of that area.

832
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:45,583
Speaker 0: But enough trivia, especially the easy trivia, like, can you name three characters from the on Genesis Evangelion?

833
00:48:45,603 --> 00:48:45,964
Speaker 0: All right.

834
00:48:46,045 --> 00:48:47,410
Speaker 1: Let's see.

835
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,642
Speaker 1: I was going to try to think of like the most obscure three characters.

836
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,229
Speaker 1: Like what's the name of the guitar playing guy?

837
00:48:52,992 --> 00:48:54,458
Speaker 0: Guitar playing guy.

838
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:56,566
Speaker 1: He works in the nerve operation center and he plays the guitar.

839
00:48:57,731 --> 00:48:58,394
Speaker 0: You're making shit up.

840
00:48:58,434 --> 00:48:58,554
Speaker 0: No.

841
00:48:58,574 --> 00:48:59,719
Speaker 0: All right.

842
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:03,556
Speaker 1: What about the glasses guy who has the crush on Masato who also works in the nerve data center?

843
00:49:03,576 --> 00:49:08,317
Speaker 0: Oh, I know the guy, but I don't know his name because I'm only a geek and not a nerd.

844
00:49:08,438 --> 00:49:09,362
Speaker 0: That's obscure trivia.

845
00:49:09,382 --> 00:49:18,362
Speaker 0: I'm saying, you know, name any three and yeah, you've proved that you're probably a geek because a fan, you know, actually I didn't name three, so I guess, I don't know, Masato, Ray, there you go.

846
00:49:18,743 --> 00:49:19,825
Speaker 0: I'll do three different ones.

847
00:49:19,905 --> 00:49:27,280
Speaker 0: I'll do, uh, Kaoru, uh, Asuka and, uh, it's Genda.

848
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:29,583
Speaker 1: There you go.

849
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:35,489
Speaker 1: I point out our delays where we were trying to think of names to say that would be funny or reflective or

850
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:40,452
Speaker 0: whatever, the kind of thing that geeks do, but here's the controversial thing that people might get mad at us for saying the

851
00:49:40,493 --> 00:49:41,559
Speaker 1: whole reason we're doing the show?

852
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,571
Speaker 1: because Scott has been on about this for a while lately for three days.

853
00:49:44,672 --> 00:49:44,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:49:45,094 --> 00:49:45,315
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:48,005
Speaker 0: Is you have this guy, this girl, here's the scene.

856
00:49:48,045 --> 00:49:57,785
Speaker 0: I sort of read a, I read something online that was a, an anecdote from a girl and I'm paraphrasing and or modifying that story because I don't remember it exactly because my memory sucks.

857
00:49:57,845 --> 00:50:00,358
Speaker 1: So we're going to construct the straw man for our point.

858
00:50:00,439 --> 00:50:00,961
Speaker 0: That's correct.

859
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:02,890
Speaker 0: So this is based on a true story.

860
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,260
Speaker 0: Construct the bracken wife girls at a convention.

861
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:09,659
Speaker 0: She sees a table at the convention, sexist assholes sitting behind the table.

862
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,205
Speaker 0: She doesn't know he's a sexist asshole yet.

863
00:50:11,727 --> 00:50:16,265
Speaker 0: She sees a merchandise on the table related to an intellectual property that she enjoys.

864
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:17,791
Speaker 0: She says, yeah.

865
00:50:18,192 --> 00:50:19,015
Speaker 0: Oh, that's from that.

866
00:50:19,276 --> 00:50:20,240
Speaker 0: I really like that.

867
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,210
Speaker 0: Sexist asshole says, oh, you really like that, huh?

868
00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:27,158
Speaker 0: Well, do you know piece of trivia?

869
00:50:27,459 --> 00:50:30,529
Speaker 0: And she says, no, it's been a while since I played it.

870
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:32,033
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

871
00:50:32,675 --> 00:50:38,272
Speaker 0: Oh, you're just a sexist asshole who is testing me to see if I was fake geek girl or not.

872
00:50:38,332 --> 00:50:40,098
Speaker 0: And he says, yes, I was.

873
00:50:40,198 --> 00:50:40,860
Speaker 0: And you failed.

874
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,004
Speaker 0: fake geek girl.

875
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:42,607
Speaker 0: Right.

876
00:50:42,647 --> 00:50:44,454
Speaker 0: That is a exaggerated paraphrase.

877
00:50:44,494 --> 00:50:46,542
Speaker 1: That is exactly how those kinds of people talk.

878
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:47,466
Speaker 0: So here are the thing.

879
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:48,029
Speaker 0: Yes.

880
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,278
Speaker 0: Dude behind table is sexist asshole.

881
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:52,747
Speaker 0: Why are you challenging people based?

882
00:50:52,827 --> 00:50:53,048
Speaker 0: Right.

883
00:50:53,108 --> 00:51:02,080
Speaker 0: And first, and even if it's okay to challenge people like that, which it isn't one piece of trivia determines the whole thing, even if it's not an easy trivia.

884
00:51:02,741 --> 00:51:03,082
Speaker 0: No.

885
00:51:03,743 --> 00:51:13,424
Speaker 0: However, the real question I have is girl or guy or whatever you are, black, purple, white, yellow person.

886
00:51:13,825 --> 00:51:16,554
Speaker 0: You said you were a fan of intellectual property.

887
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,484
Speaker 1: So I started with black and then a made up one.

888
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:20,247
Speaker 1: that isn't real.

889
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:22,757
Speaker 1: And then back to any species.

890
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:29,916
Speaker 0: If you're a dolphin and you say that you like Reagan, you know, secret of mana.

891
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:32,383
Speaker 1: I was really curious to see what you were going to say.

892
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:33,690
Speaker 0: Picking something, whatever.

893
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:35,016
Speaker 0: First thing that came to mind.

894
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:40,379
Speaker 1: One way to tell a nerd is that they really worry about what social currency they reference in a situation like this.

895
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:40,861
Speaker 0: Yeah.

896
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:44,053
Speaker 0: You're a dolphin and you say you like secret of mana.

897
00:51:44,254 --> 00:51:44,535
Speaker 0: Sure.

898
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:49,154
Speaker 0: If I ask you a random trivia, what's the name of that weird praying men is boss in the beginning.

899
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,219
Speaker 0: And you don't know that.

900
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,247
Speaker 0: So K not to know that.

901
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,503
Speaker 0: But if you say you're a fan of secret of mana and you don't know what mana sword is.

902
00:51:57,185 --> 00:51:57,526
Speaker 0: Right.

903
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:00,193
Speaker 1: What the fuck now?

904
00:52:00,413 --> 00:52:02,418
Speaker 1: Now, at the same time, you are a fan.

905
00:52:02,458 --> 00:52:03,542
Speaker 1: We're not saying you're not.

906
00:52:03,562 --> 00:52:03,923
Speaker 1: You're not.

907
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,494
Speaker 0: I mean, you know the word secret of mana.

908
00:52:06,574 --> 00:52:07,659
Speaker 0: You said you liked it.

909
00:52:07,779 --> 00:52:09,304
Speaker 0: You probably must have played it.

910
00:52:09,364 --> 00:52:09,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

911
00:52:10,247 --> 00:52:13,236
Speaker 0: But you're not a secret of mana geek.

912
00:52:13,537 --> 00:52:14,159
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

913
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:25,519
Speaker 0: I mean, if you can't get the basic trivia, if you really know nothing about it, then you really doesn't matter whether it's, you know, what sex, gender, race, whatever you are, you're not a geek.

914
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,805
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about it.

915
00:52:26,886 --> 00:52:30,282
Speaker 0: A geeky person learns a lot about the things that they're interested.

916
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:32,350
Speaker 0: They take their fandoms and learn things.

917
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:38,877
Speaker 0: If you like playing D and D and you play it often, but you don't know any of the rules because you just don't remember them.

918
00:52:39,219 --> 00:52:44,597
Speaker 0: You're a D and D fan, D and D player, D and D gamer, not a D and D geek geek.

919
00:52:44,717 --> 00:52:49,480
Speaker 0: I'm not going to say you're a fake D and D geek or you're pretending you might just be using the wrong label on yourself.

920
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:50,662
Speaker 1: Labels.

921
00:52:50,722 --> 00:52:51,607
Speaker 1: That's where we got to get into it.

922
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,114
Speaker 1: Cause here's the crux of the problem.

923
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:57,995
Speaker 1: There are, if nerds and geeks like to use prescriptive language for things like this.

924
00:52:58,457 --> 00:53:02,212
Speaker 1: So for example, a prescriptive label of geek means we have a definition of geek.

925
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,764
Speaker 1: Thereby semi objectively, people are geeks are not geeks.

926
00:53:06,206 --> 00:53:15,865
Speaker 1: If you are a fan of Star Wars, but you couldn't name any planet from Star Wars, don't know anything about Star Wars, never heard of George Lucas, you're pretty objectively not a Star Wars geek.

927
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:19,140
Speaker 0: If I make a joke about Alderaan and you don't laugh, right?

928
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:20,607
Speaker 1: Well, maybe the joke wasn't funny.

929
00:53:20,787 --> 00:53:21,872
Speaker 0: That's possibly true.

930
00:53:22,113 --> 00:53:32,170
Speaker 0: But if you see someone wearing the Alderaan weather thread t-shirt and I don't think it's threadless one and you don't get the joke, you're not a Star Wars geek.

931
00:53:32,552 --> 00:53:33,174
Speaker 0: I mean, that's true.

932
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:35,966
Speaker 0: It's only one trivia, but it's like, or, you know, here's another example.

933
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:40,451
Speaker 0: If you've never heard of George Lucas and you don't know who George Lucas is, you just know what Star Wars is.

934
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:42,100
Speaker 1: Then you're probably not a Star Wars geek.

935
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,084
Speaker 0: Probably not.

936
00:53:43,104 --> 00:53:45,620
Speaker 1: You might be the biggest Star Wars fan ever, but Scott's question is more subtle.

937
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,875
Speaker 0: If you can't tell an X-wing from a TIE fighter, not a Star Wars geek.

938
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:53,196
Speaker 1: Well, before I get back to Scott's question, the other way to look at labels is that they're self-descriptive.

939
00:53:53,457 --> 00:54:02,142
Speaker 1: If I want to label myself as X, who is anyone else to say that I am wrong because I am the one choosing the label for myself?

940
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:02,684
Speaker 0: Nobody.

941
00:54:02,764 --> 00:54:04,069
Speaker 0: Nobody can tell you you're wrong.

942
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:05,133
Speaker 1: Because I'm black.

943
00:54:05,715 --> 00:54:05,976
Speaker 0: Sure.

944
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:07,823
Speaker 0: You decided that black means white.

945
00:54:07,903 --> 00:54:11,375
Speaker 1: So yeah, by your definition, I am literally African-American.

946
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:12,640
Speaker 1: I have dark skin.

947
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:13,583
Speaker 0: No, you don't.

948
00:54:14,846 --> 00:54:15,328
Speaker 1: Who are you?

949
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:18,357
Speaker 0: Because those are objective labels.

950
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:33,560
Speaker 1: Colloquially, the words geek and nerd have come to mean anyone who likes things from a list of social currencies and properties and genres of things that in the seventies and eighties were considered nerdy.

951
00:54:33,801 --> 00:54:33,941
Speaker 0: Right.

952
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:39,705
Speaker 0: If someone says, you know, they're a fan of American Idol, no one calls that a geek, but I do.

953
00:54:39,825 --> 00:54:47,177
Speaker 0: I say, man, if you're deep into it, like, you know, who's won every season and shit, and you really study it and watch every episode and read about it online all the time.

954
00:54:47,298 --> 00:54:48,663
Speaker 0: I call you an American Idol geek.

955
00:54:48,683 --> 00:54:49,366
Speaker 0: That's what I do.

956
00:54:49,988 --> 00:54:50,229
Speaker 0: Right.

957
00:54:50,811 --> 00:55:00,468
Speaker 1: So, so here's, I guess the question Scott's getting at and correct me if I'm wrong is the kind of an aside from the whole fake nerd girl debate, which is pretty nicely one sided debate.

958
00:55:00,508 --> 00:55:02,636
Speaker 1: Luckily those people are assholes.

959
00:55:03,057 --> 00:55:03,840
Speaker 1: I can't reiterate that.

960
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:08,155
Speaker 0: I hate you guys is why don't you know about the thing you like?

961
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:12,732
Speaker 1: If you're into something, like you're really into something, why aren't you a geek about that thing?

962
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:13,535
Speaker 0: Why not?

963
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:24,695
Speaker 0: You, you, you're super, you're a fan of something enough to cosplay as it, to buy merchandise for it, to watch it, to read it, to, to, to play it all the time, to talk about it.

964
00:55:25,156 --> 00:55:28,649
Speaker 0: But you haven't even read the Wikipedia page for it.

965
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,553
Speaker 0: And you don't.

966
00:55:29,613 --> 00:55:36,015
Speaker 0: And I mean, I don't even know advanced trivia about lots of things, but you can't get any basic trivia questions.

967
00:55:36,095 --> 00:55:40,832
Speaker 0: Even with many, many chances, you have shown you have almost no knowledge of the thing.

968
00:55:40,872 --> 00:55:41,576
Speaker 0: Now, maybe you're not.

969
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:42,359
Speaker 0: Why don't you?

970
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:43,866
Speaker 1: Now, maybe you're not that interested in it.

971
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:44,469
Speaker 1: That's fine.

972
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:58,067
Speaker 1: But the question becomes, if you're the kind of person who was a fan of a lot of things, like you really like Sherlock and you really like doctor who, and you're really like, I don't know the old slayers anime, but you don't know anything about any of those things you consume.

973
00:55:58,991 --> 00:55:59,975
Speaker 1: What do you know a lot about?

974
00:56:00,336 --> 00:56:00,758
Speaker 0: Exactly.

975
00:56:00,778 --> 00:56:01,742
Speaker 1: Like, are you into something?

976
00:56:01,903 --> 00:56:09,610
Speaker 1: Cause I don't want to exaggerate, but I've met a lot of people in my life who don't have really any substantially deep interests.

977
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,917
Speaker 0: And now I will point out to you, right?

978
00:56:12,298 --> 00:56:20,644
Speaker 0: The reason that this is important, even if you disagree with our definitions of geek and nerd, which is fine, right?

979
00:56:21,226 --> 00:56:31,315
Speaker 0: Here is something that it's, this is the reason I have set the definitions in that way is to better describe this very real problem that I don't think is disputable.

980
00:56:31,978 --> 00:56:36,370
Speaker 0: Even if we can eliminate sexism, racism, and all the isms, right?

981
00:56:36,691 --> 00:56:38,135
Speaker 0: We have a situation now.

982
00:56:38,856 --> 00:56:42,186
Speaker 0: Let us, let us imagine a gaming convention.

983
00:56:43,008 --> 00:56:45,876
Speaker 0: At this gaming convention, many people will come together.

984
00:56:46,538 --> 00:56:51,313
Speaker 0: Some of those people by our definitions will be fans of a particular game.

985
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:53,380
Speaker 0: Let's call it world of Warcraft.

986
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:00,668
Speaker 0: Some people who come to this convention will be geeks of world of Warcraft and they have come together because it is a convention.

987
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:01,813
Speaker 0: Maybe it's Blizzcon.

988
00:57:02,034 --> 00:57:04,082
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft is pretty big there, right?

989
00:57:04,623 --> 00:57:09,660
Speaker 0: And these people come together thinking that they are of the same community, right?

990
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,205
Speaker 0: That they are, they are of one people.

991
00:57:11,446 --> 00:57:12,590
Speaker 0: They should get along.

992
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:16,042
Speaker 0: They all love world of Warcraft and play it great deal.

993
00:57:16,102 --> 00:57:21,838
Speaker 0: However, some of those people are by our definition geeks and some are fans.

994
00:57:22,259 --> 00:57:29,584
Speaker 0: And the fact is those people, even though they unite and come together on this single intellectual property, it should be happy times.

995
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:33,276
Speaker 0: They are actually of incredibly different psychologies.

996
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:36,045
Speaker 0: One of these people enjoys things.

997
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:39,316
Speaker 0: One group of them enjoys things on the surface level.

998
00:57:39,737 --> 00:57:42,891
Speaker 0: The other person enjoys the thing in a different way.

999
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,880
Speaker 0: They enjoy the same property in a different way.

1000
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:47,548
Speaker 0: They don't actually get along that well.

1001
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:55,519
Speaker 0: The same reason me and rim don't game well with people who aren't serious about games, even though we're playing the exact same goddamn board game.

1002
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,202
Speaker 1: Now don't get us wrong.

1003
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:00,140
Speaker 1: There is nothing wrong with, I mean, for example, I really like kung fu movies.

1004
00:58:00,521 --> 00:58:04,314
Speaker 1: I do not know a lot about kung fu movies, but here's what bothers me.

1005
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:06,723
Speaker 1: I know very little about kung fu movies.

1006
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:11,403
Speaker 1: I mean, Daryl Sarad, his pinky finger knows more about kung fu movies than I ever know in my life.

1007
00:58:11,484 --> 00:58:12,005
Speaker 0: That is true.

1008
00:58:12,146 --> 00:58:13,069
Speaker 1: I enjoy kung fu movies.

1009
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:13,831
Speaker 0: I watch them often.

1010
00:58:13,851 --> 00:58:26,983
Speaker 1: How come whenever I talk about kung fu movies with just random people I meet in the street or like coworkers or anything, they also will profess to like kung fu movies or might even be really into kung fu movies.

1011
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,734
Speaker 1: And yet somehow no less about kung fu movies than I do.

1012
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:31,280
Speaker 1: And I know almost nothing.

1013
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:31,801
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1014
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:35,698
Speaker 0: I mean, I know the only actor I can name in a kung fu movie is Bruce Lee.

1015
00:58:35,738 --> 00:58:38,353
Speaker 0: And I know that there was some fake ones like Bruce Lee and Bruce lie.

1016
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:39,841
Speaker 1: And that's all I learned about that from that thing.

1017
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:40,283
Speaker 1: We bought it.

1018
00:58:40,544 --> 00:58:42,551
Speaker 0: I can't name a kung fu movie director.

1019
00:58:42,571 --> 00:58:44,940
Speaker 0: I can name a few movie titles.

1020
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:47,768
Speaker 0: I can't even remember the names of ones I've seen.

1021
00:58:47,788 --> 00:58:48,591
Speaker 0: Right.

1022
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:52,663
Speaker 0: But that's still more than people who claim to be right.

1023
00:58:53,084 --> 00:58:56,695
Speaker 0: So people who have the deep interest, right.

1024
00:58:57,116 --> 00:59:04,644
Speaker 0: And people who have the light interest in the same property are often these days coming together into the same physical community space.

1025
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:09,159
Speaker 0: But they do not get along regardless of gender, race, whatever.

1026
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:11,267
Speaker 0: They're not actually of the same community.

1027
00:59:11,288 --> 00:59:14,942
Speaker 0: They're groups of Star Trek people who are surface level into Star Trek.

1028
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:18,900
Speaker 0: And there are people into it who are Trekkie, Trekker, whatever word you want to use.

1029
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:21,871
Speaker 0: And those two groups don't go well together.

1030
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:24,963
Speaker 0: And this is a conflict we are going to see happen.

1031
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:36,558
Speaker 0: It currently mostly exhibits itself in, you know, between these conventions and between the males of the deep interest group and the females of the fan group.

1032
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:37,140
Speaker 0: Right.

1033
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,370
Speaker 0: And this sex, you know, sexism allows the.

1034
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:54,224
Speaker 1: I think it is existing and being a problem everywhere and has been for a while as convention culture is growing because, you know, the Internet is basically connecting all these people and convention culture is going to be a huge thing in the next 20 years.

1035
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:55,509
Speaker 0: And it started huge.

1036
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:55,791
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1037
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:57,197
Speaker 1: You know, you think now is huge.

1038
00:59:57,337 --> 00:59:57,578
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1039
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,186
Speaker 1: I think now is such a bare beginning of that.

1040
01:00:00,206 --> 01:00:00,808
Speaker 0: I also think.

1041
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:09,216
Speaker 1: But the problem is that the sexist dudes are really going out of their way to get it all out there in the open.

1042
01:00:09,236 --> 01:00:09,778
Speaker 1: That is there.

1043
01:00:09,999 --> 01:00:13,389
Speaker 1: Basically, those guys stand out and I'm sick of them.

1044
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:14,633
Speaker 0: Who isn't sick of them?

1045
01:00:15,556 --> 01:00:15,797
Speaker 1: Them.

1046
01:00:15,817 --> 01:00:16,780
Speaker 0: That's about it.

1047
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,337
Speaker 1: Now, I wonder if it's because they want their thing to be exclusive.

1048
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:21,703
Speaker 1: Do they feel threatened?

1049
01:00:21,804 --> 01:00:22,547
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

1050
01:00:22,627 --> 01:00:30,858
Speaker 0: I think what it is and this is just a guess, right, is that because they're sexist, they see a girl and they assume that that is a person who doesn't know.

1051
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:30,978
Speaker 0: Right.

1052
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,346
Speaker 0: That that is a person of the other community.

1053
01:00:33,366 --> 01:00:34,631
Speaker 0: So they attack.

1054
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,638
Speaker 0: And if they weren't sexist.

1055
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:37,340
Speaker 0: Right.

1056
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,636
Speaker 0: They would perhaps look at dudes and recognize that as someone of the other.

1057
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:43,238
Speaker 0: Right.

1058
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:55,680
Speaker 0: Or maybe when there were no girls there, they would, for example, see a dude wearing his Star Trek logo pin on the wrong side of his uniform and challenge that person in the same way.

1059
01:00:56,541 --> 01:00:56,822
Speaker 0: Right.

1060
01:00:57,043 --> 01:01:04,652
Speaker 0: It's like they'll challenge anyone who is merely a fan and not a geek, who is of the other, of the not same community that they don't go well with together.

1061
01:01:05,275 --> 01:01:12,263
Speaker 0: But because they are sexist, they see a girl and immediately assume that that person is in the other side and challenges them straight out.

1062
01:01:12,323 --> 01:01:13,671
Speaker 0: And that is the sexism aspect.

1063
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:34,699
Speaker 1: Now, it's interesting if you think about it, the desire of these sort of specialist communities to have only people of their type at a gathering, at a convention, for example, is directly opposed by the fact that every convention, as soon as it gets beyond off the radar, immediately attracts every type of.

1064
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:38,392
Speaker 1: basically the social currency is the beacon, not the level of engagement.

1065
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:54,366
Speaker 1: So thus, while at the same time, there's an increased balkanization of specialization, there is simultaneously an increased merging of the communities to where the majority of the people at anime cons have seen less than 10 anime ever in their lives.

1066
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:56,693
Speaker 1: And I'm not exaggerating.

1067
01:01:57,455 --> 01:01:59,983
Speaker 1: I mean, you go to the Star Trek convention.

1068
01:02:00,023 --> 01:02:04,642
Speaker 1: There's only like, you know, not Star Trek celebration because that's Star Wars celebration.

1069
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:05,324
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1070
01:02:05,344 --> 01:02:06,247
Speaker 1: Star Wars celebration.

1071
01:02:06,508 --> 01:02:14,837
Speaker 1: You go to like a local, like sci fi Star Wars convention, for example, it's the 40 dudes from that area who are super into Star Wars.

1072
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:15,580
Speaker 0: And 501st people.

1073
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:16,020
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1074
01:02:16,603 --> 01:02:25,978
Speaker 1: You go to the Star Trek convention and a few kids and a few families heard about it on the radio, but you go to Star Wars celebration and you're really into Star Wars.

1075
01:02:26,038 --> 01:02:27,405
Speaker 1: It's more like the New York comic con.

1076
01:02:27,465 --> 01:02:29,054
Speaker 1: It's really, there's a lot of casual fans.

1077
01:02:29,074 --> 01:02:36,044
Speaker 0: There's people there who just sort of know Star Wars and like it because really even people who don't self identify as nerds and geeks fucking like Star Wars.

1078
01:02:36,084 --> 01:02:37,832
Speaker 0: It's rare to find a Star Wars not liker.

1079
01:02:37,952 --> 01:02:38,173
Speaker 1: Yup.

1080
01:02:38,676 --> 01:02:50,522
Speaker 1: But you go to an anime convention and you know, literally half the people in the audience of a panel who I can't believe they even went to a panel have never seen, I don't know, really any anime notable I'd ever can ever think of.

1081
01:02:50,582 --> 01:02:52,209
Speaker 1: listing and a list of notable anime.

1082
01:02:52,229 --> 01:02:52,390
Speaker 1: Right.

1083
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:52,952
Speaker 0: Right.

1084
01:02:53,093 --> 01:02:55,763
Speaker 0: And in, so basically the conclusion is right.

1085
01:02:56,665 --> 01:03:13,140
Speaker 0: We have this conflict of the deep interest geek nerd people and the shallow interest fan people of the same intellectual properties or topics or hobbies coming together and a conflict is brewing that currently mostly exhibits itself across sexist borders,

1086
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:14,303
Speaker 1: but will

1087
01:03:14,785 --> 01:03:18,735
Speaker 0: over time reveal itself, I believe, across all borders.

1088
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:19,638
Speaker 0: Right.

1089
01:03:19,778 --> 01:03:20,721
Speaker 1: And look at what's happening now.

1090
01:03:20,742 --> 01:03:21,445
Speaker 1: Look at magfest.

1091
01:03:21,485 --> 01:03:25,060
Speaker 1: Magfest is half people who are playing games the entire time.

1092
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:38,047
Speaker 1: And half people are going to concerts the entire time, but there is a huge undercurrent of people who are from the internet, not super into games or concerts, super into drinking and internet bullshit and running around making a ruckus.

1093
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:42,002
Speaker 1: Anime cons are primarily people who aren't super into anime.

1094
01:03:42,704 --> 01:03:51,348
Speaker 1: Every convention that grows at all is becoming an internet convention that is loosely tied to the intellectual property that spawned it.

1095
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:51,990
Speaker 1: And that's it.

1096
01:03:53,514 --> 01:03:55,440
Speaker 1: And there's no way around that.

1097
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:00,355
Speaker 1: The attempts to make hardcore anime conventions fail or they're tiny.

1098
01:04:00,977 --> 01:04:02,060
Speaker 1: And I don't even really.

1099
01:04:02,961 --> 01:04:04,669
Speaker 1: it's sad that I'm super into anime.

1100
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:10,938
Speaker 1: And as much as I complain about the fact that I go to an anime con and no one knows or cares about anime, the anime only cons are even sadder.

1101
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:11,239
Speaker 0: Right.

1102
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,487
Speaker 0: So here is the things that you need to do, right?

1103
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:19,428
Speaker 0: Number one, do not be a jerk and challenge people who are on the other side, right?

1104
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:24,768
Speaker 0: You know, because there's nothing wrong with being a fan or there's nothing wrong with being a geek.

1105
01:04:24,788 --> 01:04:28,083
Speaker 0: We're not, you know, it's not bad or right or wrong to be on either side.

1106
01:04:28,123 --> 01:04:36,593
Speaker 0: We simply have to recognize that even though two peoples or two groups of peoples may like the same thing, they are actually not people.

1107
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:44,463
Speaker 0: They approach it differently, enjoy it differently and don't actually get along, you know, and don't mesh as well together as you may think they should.

1108
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:50,443
Speaker 0: So just keep it civil and recognize that you aren't really the same, even though you should be.

1109
01:04:50,503 --> 01:04:52,934
Speaker 0: And don't start fighting and getting into bullshit drama.

1110
01:04:53,215 --> 01:04:53,436
Speaker 0: Right.

1111
01:04:53,718 --> 01:04:55,605
Speaker 0: It's not bad or right or wrong to be either one.

1112
01:04:56,610 --> 01:05:01,669
Speaker 0: And number two, don't go around fucking challenging people, you know, saying, ah, you're on the other side.

1113
01:05:01,709 --> 01:05:03,175
Speaker 0: You're bad pointing it out.

1114
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:06,045
Speaker 0: It's like it's not wrong to be on the other side.

1115
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:08,996
Speaker 0: And two, you're being a jerk and an asshole, right?

1116
01:05:09,377 --> 01:05:16,642
Speaker 0: Don't assume that just because someone may have boobs or have different colored skin or whatnot, that which side they are on.

1117
01:05:17,223 --> 01:05:17,504
Speaker 0: Right.

1118
01:05:17,564 --> 01:05:21,013
Speaker 0: That's fucking ist of any asterisk you want to put in front of it.

1119
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:32,771
Speaker 0: And we also finally would encourage all people to come to the side that we are on because whatever side you're on, that's the side you want more people to be on.

1120
01:05:32,811 --> 01:05:33,877
Speaker 1: You don't have to be a nerd.

1121
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:34,961
Speaker 1: At least be a geek.

1122
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:37,590
Speaker 1: At least be into something.

1123
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:37,891
Speaker 0: Right.

1124
01:05:37,951 --> 01:05:42,105
Speaker 0: It's like if you like something, if you're that fan person, nothing wrong with it.

1125
01:05:42,246 --> 01:05:43,189
Speaker 0: That's totally cool.

1126
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:44,333
Speaker 0: Good for you.

1127
01:05:44,353 --> 01:05:45,437
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1128
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:48,770
Speaker 0: Like we said, why don't you know more about the thing?

1129
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,478
Speaker 1: Like we said, I'm a fan of Kung Fu movies.

1130
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:52,829
Speaker 1: My knowledge is not going to get much deeper than it already is.

1131
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:53,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1132
01:05:53,291 --> 01:05:55,160
Speaker 0: I met a guy who's super into metal gear.

1133
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,584
Speaker 0: Metal gear is number one thing.

1134
01:05:56,685 --> 01:05:57,066
Speaker 1: Oh, you do.

1135
01:05:57,146 --> 01:05:58,712
Speaker 1: this anecdote is sad.

1136
01:05:59,876 --> 01:06:01,804
Speaker 0: I've never beaten a metal gear game in my life.

1137
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:05,802
Speaker 1: Scott, you've played less than half of the metal gear games that ever existed at all.

1138
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:09,053
Speaker 0: I've got through like the second room of metal gear solid.

1139
01:06:09,073 --> 01:06:11,261
Speaker 0: I can get to the trucks in metal gear.

1140
01:06:11,422 --> 01:06:12,104
Speaker 0: one on the NES.

1141
01:06:12,124 --> 01:06:13,349
Speaker 0: Did you play snakes revenge?

1142
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:18,490
Speaker 0: I don't know if that, I think maybe I turned it on once and then couldn't get anywhere and died and then turn it off.

1143
01:06:19,293 --> 01:06:19,534
Speaker 1: Right.

1144
01:06:20,297 --> 01:06:22,627
Speaker 0: But I know the original metal gear came out in Japan.

1145
01:06:22,788 --> 01:06:26,423
Speaker 0: What didn't suck like the NES one that it came out for the MSX too.

1146
01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:29,456
Speaker 0: I know that now all the metal gears are on the PlayStation.

1147
01:06:29,496 --> 01:06:30,882
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure there's four of them.

1148
01:06:30,922 --> 01:06:32,653
Speaker 0: And there's, I knew there's a new one coming out soon.

1149
01:06:32,753 --> 01:06:34,522
Speaker 1: What's the main character in metal gear?

1150
01:06:34,743 --> 01:06:36,327
Speaker 0: Solid snake, right?

1151
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:36,689
Speaker 0: Wow.

1152
01:06:36,829 --> 01:06:38,454
Speaker 1: I know this is one other character.

1153
01:06:38,634 --> 01:06:39,838
Speaker 0: All right.

1154
01:06:39,878 --> 01:06:40,400
Speaker 0: Gray Fox.

1155
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,241
Speaker 0: All right.

1156
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:41,803
Speaker 0: I know.

1157
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:42,727
Speaker 1: I gray Fox.

1158
01:06:42,927 --> 01:06:45,898
Speaker 0: I know some things about, uh, metal gear, big boss.

1159
01:06:46,138 --> 01:06:48,349
Speaker 0: I was about to say, I know the metal gear is a big Mac.

1160
01:06:48,369 --> 01:06:49,998
Speaker 0: I know a lot of things about metal gear.

1161
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:52,669
Speaker 1: Interestingly, there's no way to know the metal gear is a big Mac.

1162
01:06:52,730 --> 01:06:57,229
Speaker 0: If you just play the NES metal gear one, I met a person who was a super metal gear fan.

1163
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,340
Speaker 0: That was their literal number one thing.

1164
01:06:59,942 --> 01:07:04,535
Speaker 0: They did not know about the fact that the original metal gear was Japan.

1165
01:07:04,655 --> 01:07:07,284
Speaker 0: Only MSX two wasn't the same as the NES one.

1166
01:07:07,304 --> 01:07:09,293
Speaker 0: They thought any S one was the original metal gear.

1167
01:07:09,876 --> 01:07:12,346
Speaker 0: They had never played the original NES metal gear at all.

1168
01:07:12,386 --> 01:07:15,277
Speaker 0: The oldest metal gear that they had played was solid one.

1169
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:20,417
Speaker 0: And the only metal gear knowledge they had was metal gear knowledge from the games themselves.

1170
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:21,119
Speaker 0: Right.

1171
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:29,349
Speaker 0: And they knew the name of Hideo Kojima, which is more than nothing, but they literally had no other metal gear knowledge beyond that at all.

1172
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:40,464
Speaker 1: And you like if your favorite four movies were the lady vanishes psycho vertigo and rear window, and you'd heard of Alfred Hitchcock, but you didn't know we made any other movies.

1173
01:07:40,725 --> 01:07:42,993
Speaker 0: It's like, why don't you know more?

1174
01:07:43,114 --> 01:07:49,754
Speaker 0: You should, if you're listening to this, whatever thing you are into at least read the Wikipedia about it.

1175
01:07:49,894 --> 01:07:53,889
Speaker 0: I mean, you need to know about the things that you're a fan of.

1176
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:54,391
Speaker 0: that you're.

1177
01:07:54,692 --> 01:07:57,485
Speaker 0: you're nerdy and geeky enough to listen to a podcast called geek nights.

1178
01:07:58,309 --> 01:08:00,840
Speaker 1: I don't think the people who were talking to were listening to this.

1179
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:01,422
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1180
01:08:01,723 --> 01:08:02,366
Speaker 0: Probably not.

1181
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:10,139
Speaker 0: People who need to hear it are not the ones here, but you, but whether you need to hear this message or not, you know, someone else who needs to hear this message.

1182
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:29,444
Speaker 1: Here's a kind of a side, take the words geek and nerd back in the sense that use them to mean something along the lines of deeper than average interest in a narrower field of things, rather than just being a descriptor for things that happen to be associated with socially awkward smart people in the seventies.

1183
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:33,836
Speaker 0: Is there any more to say on this?

1184
01:08:33,997 --> 01:08:36,446
Speaker 0: I feel like we've iterated many points and emphasize them.

1185
01:08:36,466 --> 01:08:37,611
Speaker 1: a lot of points there.

1186
01:08:37,631 --> 01:08:39,680
Speaker 1: We've gone this the longest episode in a while.

1187
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:40,563
Speaker 0: That's fine.

1188
01:08:40,603 --> 01:08:41,648
Speaker 0: We needed something like this.

1189
01:08:42,573 --> 01:08:43,015
Speaker 1: We're done.

1190
01:08:43,236 --> 01:08:43,477
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1191
01:08:43,598 --> 01:08:43,959
Speaker 1: We're out.

1192
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:52,537
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1193
01:08:52,577 --> 01:08:57,413
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1194
01:08:57,635 --> 01:09:02,674
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1195
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:05,586
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

1196
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:10,346
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1197
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:14,685
Speaker 0: Geek nights is distributed under a creative commons attribution 3.0 license.

1198
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:21,260
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.
