Speaker 0: I'm just not doing anything to work.

14
00:00:44,006 --> 00:00:45,050
Speaker 0: I'm just thinking about packs.

15
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,056
Speaker 1: It's so weird like other conventions.

16
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:50,487

18
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,106
Speaker 1: I've been like yeah, fuck their packs is coming like weeks ago, and I think it's a different.

19
00:00:56,146 --> 00:00:57,350
Speaker 0: like two three days.

20
00:00:57,693 --> 00:01:13,265
Speaker 0: I'm excited about packs the way I used to be excited about things like Otakon you know in the early days of cons when Like every like being an attendee and nothing more was just crazy and amazing and like walk into a dealer's room and oh my god There's 26,000 nerds, but you know anime cons for us are about 75% work.

21
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:13,346
Speaker 0: now.

22
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:19,765
Speaker 1: Well packs is work too, but you know what packs is just so great.

23
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,170
Speaker 1: I would the greatest of the greats.

24
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:28,770
Speaker 0: One of the only regrets and now we have two in my entire life Is that I did not go to a pack sooner?

25
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:36,318
Speaker 1: I would have had to suffer to go to those packs as we we considered it is when they announced that first packs We're like let's go no matter what.

26
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:42,782
Speaker 1: but we didn't yeah because we didn't have enough money, and then the next year We're like let's go no matter what and eventually we went no matter what.

27
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:44,650
Speaker 1: last year far too late.

28
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,398
Speaker 1: We should have gone no matter what much much earlier.

29
00:01:47,418 --> 00:01:49,063
Speaker 0: It's very few things.

30
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:51,269
Speaker 1: how things have turned out then.

31
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,706
Speaker 1: Otakon might be mailing badges already.

32
00:01:53,928 --> 00:02:00,863
Speaker 0: Yep Just imagine going to that early packs is only what like 3,000 feet.

Speaker 1: a situation like you live in the middle of Kansas, and you wanted to go if you have no money well You know that you don't suck, but if you wanted to go and the only reason you're not going is cuz you waited too long To pre-reg hope you learn your lesson.

44

47
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,286
Speaker 1: look on Twitter see how many chumps there are.

48
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,795
Speaker 1: go to the packs forums For like Want badges.

49
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:05,700
Speaker 0: then there are badges.

50
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,215
Speaker 0: They're going to be jumps no matter what.

51
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:15,529
Speaker 0: people could have all registered on day one and then hour to day one It'd be the same number of jumps.

52
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,373
Speaker 1: That's right You got it.

53
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:30,346
Speaker 1: if you don't want to be a chump if someone told me that they were there as soon as the announcement was made Constantly refreshing the page and trying to buy a badge immediately And they sold out and they weren't able to get one then they are not a chump.

54
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:31,611
Speaker 0: the thing is it's funny How it.

55
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,743
Speaker 0: other cons like on the artist alley registration is like that.

56
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:39,550
Speaker 0: there are people who refresh that thing Register within like a minute, and you know what it's like.

57
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,694
Speaker 1: It's like back in the day.

58
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:41,899
Speaker 1: try two things I can.

59
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,990
Speaker 1: I can equate it to number one registering for classes at RIT.

60
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,930
Speaker 0: When you're a measly freshman, you know I never had to go through that.

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,119
Speaker 0: That's one of the few other than my first.

62
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,019
Speaker 0: I only had to do it like a couple times at RIT when I didn't know better.

63
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:54,574
Speaker 0: Remember I I was.

64
00:03:54,594 --> 00:03:55,597
Speaker 0: I was like uh-huh.

65
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:58,265
Speaker 1: anyway the number two thing I can relate it to.

66
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:04,089
Speaker 1: the number two thing is Trying to get the newest version to counter-strike the day it comes out.

67
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:04,857
Speaker 0: You know what.

68
00:04:04,998 --> 00:04:06,150
Speaker 0: I never had to deal with that either.

69
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,350
Speaker 0: You just waited till the next day because you would always get it And then I would just take it off like your windows share.

70
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,163
Speaker 1: I don't remember ever giving it to you, and I didn't have a windows share.

71
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,550
Speaker 0: I would get it from you.

72
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,168
Speaker 0: I don't usually because you'd be like hey you want to play counter-strike, and I'd be like I didn't download the patch.

73
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:20,329
Speaker 0: yet.

74
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,239
Speaker 1: I don't remember ever giving you a counter-strike.

75
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:24,229
Speaker 1: I remember everyone waiting in line, okay?

76
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:26,250
Speaker 1: I think in random mirrors until it worked.

77
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,978
Speaker 0: I usually wait until someone else got it then just so people.

78
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,670
Speaker 1: people don't appreciate how great steam is just automatically updating your shit.

79
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:34,050
Speaker 1: You know with no bullshit.

80
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,290
Speaker 1: You don't remember the days of counter-strike updates like you know trying to get beta 9 and when beta 8 was your current version.

81
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,792
Speaker 1: You know what.

82
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:41,816
Speaker 0: that wasn't the problem.

83
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:45,370
Speaker 0: that wasn't the part that bothered me because like I said I never waited those stupid lines.

84
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:47,969
Speaker 0: I just waited for some other chump to get it for me.

85
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:49,820
Speaker 1: I didn't you wasn't me Greg.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,650
Speaker 0: I always got someone to do it anyway.

87
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:55,050
Speaker 0: But the plus RIT you could get it off a direct connect.

88
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:58,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, like within an hour not freshman year directing.

89
00:04:58,327 --> 00:04:58,870
Speaker 1: that came later.

90
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,901
Speaker 1: The problem was by that time steam was out.

91
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:12,458
Speaker 0: the problem was that RIT that once they release an update like half the servers be running different versions and half the servers wouldn't work in the server side would be A mess for like a week after the update.

92
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:13,020
Speaker 1: that was true.

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:23,189
Speaker 0: Everyone would jump on to like the three servers that I had At the right very but at the same time as it moved you'd see the servers that didn't move getting more and more full as People who didn't have the update yet had to move to them.

94
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:27,102
Speaker 1: Yeah As they had to play while they're waiting the update to download plus half the servers.

95
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:31,137
Speaker 0: then like the admin mods wouldn't work anymore And you couldn't kick people.

96
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:33,566
Speaker 0: you'd have admins like breaking into patches.

97
00:05:33,787 --> 00:05:34,670
Speaker 0: It was it was crazy.

98
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:37,481
Speaker 1: Alright, so check out some video game news.

99
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,429
Speaker 0: you ready for this, and I'm ready alright.

100
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,448
Speaker 1: So rim when you go to the arcade right and you're playing the what there's no such thing as arcades.

101
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:50,949
Speaker 1: when you go to fun Spot or the the you mean when I go to a video or you go to video topia.

102
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,095
Speaker 1: Yes, it is video.

103
00:05:52,135 --> 00:05:55,070
Speaker 1: topia by the way is in the Rochester strong music?

104
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,677
Speaker 1: I think is it the strong museum of fun?

105
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:02,940
Speaker 0: so like I was about to say if I go to a museum Fun spots not a museum anyway effectively it is anyway.

106
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:09,643
Speaker 1: if you go to an arcade with the old-school games What are your old-school games that you play?

107
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:09,683
Speaker 1: I?

108
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,555
Speaker 0: Don't know all of them.

109
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:12,796
Speaker 1: Well.

110
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:16,210
Speaker 1: No like the games that are rims games like root beer tappers.

111
00:06:16,872 --> 00:06:19,020
Speaker 1: And you know cinestar is not your game.

112
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:19,943
Speaker 0: I like cinestar.

113
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:21,690
Speaker 1: You know, but it's not your game root beer.

114
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:23,344
Speaker 1: I think your games are root beer tapper.

115
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:24,050
Speaker 0: Here's the difference.

116
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:27,787
Speaker 0: Do you mean my game as in the games that I was transcendently good at?

117
00:06:27,908 --> 00:06:28,410
Speaker 0: yeah somehow?

118
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,321
Speaker 1: Yes, root beer tapper root beer tapper miss pac-man.

119
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:32,405
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it right.

120
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,650
Speaker 0: well ramparts later.

121
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,956
Speaker 0: I don't even consider that old-school.

122
00:06:35,056 --> 00:06:36,744
Speaker 1: I consider rampart old-school.

123
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,930
Speaker 0: I don't know what to consider it.

124
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,608
Speaker 0: It's so middle school Horton to my life.

125
00:06:41,294 --> 00:06:43,149
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what are my games?

126
00:06:44,594 --> 00:06:45,802
Speaker 0: Uh, what are your games?

127
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:49,877
Speaker 1: mega man to Arcade games of the old-school flavor.

128
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,140
Speaker 0: I don't know.

129
00:06:52,172 --> 00:06:56,430
Speaker 1: I consider my game to be Galaga even though I'm not a master of Scott likes.

130
00:06:56,551 --> 00:06:59,207
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so there's that the new champion of Galaga.

131
00:06:59,227 --> 00:06:59,859
Speaker 1: That's correct Yeah.

132
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:05,846
Speaker 1: So previously the champion of Galaga was Andrew Laidlaw from the United States with 2.7 million points.

133
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:16,642
Speaker 1: Some dude in Australia named Phil day has three point forty four million points Holy craps, and basically all he did.

134
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,450
Speaker 1: he's been playing it since he was seven years old.

135
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:31,289
Speaker 1: He had a machine He trained like intensely for six months out in the you know who knows middle of nowhere and the outback right and then He put up the video camera because people don't know right.

136
00:07:32,712 --> 00:07:48,730
Speaker 1: Twin galaxies is the like official video game high score keeping organization And you can either register your high score in the presence of a twin galaxies referee or You can do it via video tape where you basically videotape your machine to prove that it's the real deal.

137
00:07:49,031 --> 00:08:05,154
Speaker 1: Then videotape your entire play session and you know the whole and then mail your videotape to twin galaxies for them to verify that You didn't like photoshop it and such and so he chose the videotape method and he did it like just all on his own and his house with his machine and You know.

138
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:07,321
Speaker 0: basically I wonder how many attempts that took.

139
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,613
Speaker 0: like you wonder you know eight hours into his fourth session Fuck the.

140
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:25,522
Speaker 1: the interesting thing that they said about it was that you know when he crossed the high score point He just kept going and he was just sort of in a daze and he was real exhausted so that you didn't have he didn't Like celebrate or go like yeah when he passed the point He just kept going until he died and then he was like who?

141
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:28,255
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the video though But that's what they.

142
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:31,310
Speaker 0: that's what there's something about that zone and every gamer has it.

143
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,366
Speaker 0: I mean even playing DDR.

144
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:36,568
Speaker 0: You know you'll be playing and you get to a point to where you realize that you're not even looking at the arrows.

145
00:08:36,609 --> 00:08:39,380
Speaker 0: your feet Are just kind of moving yep, and you're getting them all.

146
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:43,356
Speaker 1: one thing that really interested me though is like you know You know what a Galaga machine looks like.

147
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:53,095
Speaker 1: right apparently if you want to register a high score for Galaga You can only do it on an unaltered 1981 Japanese Galaga machine.

148
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:57,408
Speaker 1: with this you can't like if you use like you know the new Galaga pack miss pac-man combo machine.

149
00:08:57,649 --> 00:08:57,950
Speaker 1: that don't.

150
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,436
Speaker 0: Why is there that different?

151
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:01,440
Speaker 1: that's what they said.

152
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,095
Speaker 1: you have to play it on the original Japanese 1981 Galaga tournament machine.

153
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:06,918
Speaker 1: that's the only machine.

154
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,041
Speaker 1: you get the high score this.

155
00:09:08,142 --> 00:09:10,810
Speaker 0: so this raises some very important questions.

156
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,625
Speaker 0: For example it raises the.

157
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,563
Speaker 1: I've never played I've never even I saw a picture of that machine online today, and I'm like.

158
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,210
Speaker 1: I've never seen a Galaga like that before.

159
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,757
Speaker 1: That's the original Galaga.

160
00:09:19,798 --> 00:09:20,420
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

161
00:09:20,441 --> 00:09:29,672
Speaker 0: this raises the ship of Theseus question How what percentage of the components can I have replaced over the years as they broke to have it still count as an original Machine?

162
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,140
Speaker 1: I think it just has to be.

163
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:33,090
Speaker 1: you know the the exact same.

164
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:43,634
Speaker 1: You know I'm sure if you like Manufactured the exact same thing with the exact same code with the exact same parts even if it wasn't all original parts You know they would be okay.

165
00:09:43,654 --> 00:09:48,410
Speaker 0: that might be unfair though because you have an advantage of all new workings all new perfect controller.

166
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:50,930
Speaker 1: But I mean you know they just have to be the same exact.

167
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:55,327
Speaker 1: It would be the same as if you had scored the high score in 1981, and what's the difference.

168
00:09:55,608 --> 00:09:56,190
Speaker 1: that's legitimate?

169
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:58,338
Speaker 1: You know when all the parts of the machines were brand.

170
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:04,950
Speaker 0: but at the same time that limits the scope of people have access to The best technology and it over time it'll be harder and harder to get these machines.

171
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:06,460
Speaker 1: Yeah You know it is.

172
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:07,350
Speaker 1: it is a question.

173
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:11,310
Speaker 1: I thought it was interesting and the question is are some of the questions that I was also raised?

174
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,002
Speaker 1: I'm also very supposed to score a high scoring Galaga.

175
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:15,770
Speaker 1: I've never even fucking seen that machine.

176
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,296
Speaker 1: I'm also only ever seen normal.

177
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:25,390
Speaker 0: I'm also curious as to why I mean it sounds like this is just I'm gonna go straight up petty fanboy rules, and I think partially.

178
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:39,659
Speaker 1: But also I do know for a fact that some other Galaga machines especially newer ones have various like difficulty setting switches And there's like some Galaga's let you shoot two bullets at a time and some let you shoot like infinity bullets as fast as you Can push the button and some let you know.

179
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,575
Speaker 1: so there's many different settings plus Hardware.

180
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:45,249
Speaker 0: hack my original machine.

181
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:49,369
Speaker 1: They would then you wouldn't be valid because they yet to when you see if you send in your videotape.

182
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:54,970
Speaker 1: Yet to video the like the whole machine so they can see it and inspect it And then they know what it's supposed to be all right.

183
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,576
Speaker 1: And if you have a referee the referee inspects the machine And they know what the fuck's going on.

184
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,405
Speaker 0: so if I don't have a referee when does the video start?

185
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:01,330
Speaker 0: when I start playing it?

186
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,876
Speaker 0: Shows me and the machine and my screen.

187
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,238
Speaker 1: you have to.

188
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:10,710
Speaker 1: if you if they're not satisfied with your videotape They just reject it and don't count your score, so it's completely up to twin galaxies whether your video counts or not.

189
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:12,014
Speaker 0: Yeah so I'm curious.

190
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:20,310
Speaker 0: I I think it would be fairly easy to hack the machine with a couple of Subtle bits here and there that wouldn't be noticed by someone watching or eight-hour video you are.

191
00:11:20,451 --> 00:11:29,377
Speaker 1: But I mean if they're they're they're real experts And they're examining every detail like if they notice like your ship like skip to the left ones You know which you know or something like that to be like.

192
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,306
Speaker 1: hey he died and then re-edited the video.

193
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:33,550
Speaker 1: That's bullshit and fail.

194
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:45,378
Speaker 0: while that is true I Very much doubt the competence of humans to detect very subtle changes in a long and tedious Video of someone playing an arcade game.

195
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,831
Speaker 1: I agree, but they they they're the experts on it I don't.

196
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:55,751
Speaker 1: I'd be very interested to hear what their actual method for you know verifying videos submissions is but you know I don't know.

197
00:11:55,772 --> 00:11:56,033
Speaker 0: I'm just.

198
00:11:56,093 --> 00:12:00,511
Speaker 0: I'm less and less impressed with these sort of things as time goes on especially after having watched the King of Kong.

199
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,058
Speaker 1: yeah, I didn't watch the King of Kong.

200
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,123
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't.

201
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:04,087
Speaker 0: it wasn't that good.

202
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,921
Speaker 1: I'll be honest I thought it was just about like some jerks playing Donkey Kong.

203
00:12:07,122 --> 00:12:07,926
Speaker 0: it basically was.

204
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:09,431
Speaker 0: it was kind of tedious And it just.

205
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:10,112
Speaker 0: I don't know.

206
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:25,379
Speaker 0: the games like this where the difficulty does not necessarily Grow beyond a certain point But at the same like a good example is WarioWare the difficulty keeps going up until it's effectively impossible So that it's going to eliminate people fairly quickly.

207
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,887
Speaker 0: these old-school arcade games if you're the expert at it.

208
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:28,770
Speaker 0: You're the world champion.

209
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,998
Speaker 0: It's just a test of endurance.

210
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:34,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much what it is especially these sorts of high score games.

211
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:35,380
Speaker 1: It's endurance.

212
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:42,070
Speaker 1: a game like Pitfall though is I think is the much more interesting game for the high score because it's not about right.

213
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:54,969
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of guys out there who can get perfect scores on Atari Pitfall on the 2600 But they're basically racing for the best possible time, and it's like some guys go left some guys go right some guys get.

214
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,158
Speaker 1: you know It's it's totally.

215
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:56,521
Speaker 1: you know.

216
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,734
Speaker 1: they mix it up all the time And it's like you know.

217
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:00,560
Speaker 1: there's actual competition there.

218
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,490
Speaker 0: well to a degree that remember that is still just a memorization game.

219
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,792
Speaker 1: Endurance.

220
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:05,354
Speaker 1: it's perfect.

221
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:06,337
Speaker 1: It's about perfection.

222
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:06,839
Speaker 0: It is well.

223
00:13:06,859 --> 00:13:10,150
Speaker 0: It's a performance art kind of like those Mario 1 racing guys exactly.

224
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:15,062
Speaker 1: Oh my god High score is a lot better than the you know say the pac-man's.

225
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,327
Speaker 0: what about doggy car?

226
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:17,070
Speaker 0: what about super pitfall?

227
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:21,810
Speaker 1: Super pitfall just sucks All right, what's your news there?

228
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:33,350
Speaker 1: So you a punk kid who wants to make games and you're probably in college or don't otherwise have a job Don't do what I did and spend your college doing nothing and then regret later not making something while you're in college.

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,904
Speaker 0: You mustn't kill time boys.

230
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:35,650
Speaker 0: He was cherished.

231
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:36,694
Speaker 1: Yeah Be like.

232
00:13:36,754 --> 00:13:43,750
Speaker 1: you know all those other guys who made some awesome Software while they were in college and then didn't have to get jobs when they got out because their software was their job.

233
00:13:44,572 --> 00:13:49,547
Speaker 0: It's it feels almost very old to be saying this but looking back at college.

234
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:55,205
Speaker 0: I wasted 99% of the time I had in college.

235
00:13:55,245 --> 00:13:58,657
Speaker 0: now at the same time It's tricky because I enjoyed that wasting.

236
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:06,139
Speaker 0: and could I have been the person I am today had I not wasted all that time Playing counter-strike and taking around.

237
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:12,890
Speaker 1: the thing is I would have be happier now if I had done something differently But I would not have been happier then if I had done something differently.

238
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,759
Speaker 1: So it's just you know, it's it evens out.

239
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,973
Speaker 0: Yes, because remember had we done something in college We would not have had quote those days Exactly.

240
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:35,930
Speaker 0: So kids either do something or cherish those days and by those days I mean days where you're in college in your little dorm or apartment and You don't have any homework to do and you don't have any classes to go to and you don't have a job yet And you have like three days of nothing.

241
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:40,469
Speaker 0: Those are the best days you will ever have and the weather's nice and the weather's not.

242
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:53,627
Speaker 1: Or college guys if you're a girl Or if you're you know, if you swing that way, you know, whatever doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

243
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:54,530
Speaker 1: Let's continue.

244
00:14:54,932 --> 00:14:59,593
Speaker 0: So if you don't want to have those days and you want to do something You can win.

245
00:14:59,694 --> 00:15:06,175
Speaker 0: actually the company Emily and Alex work for muse games is doing a $10,000 contest and all you have to do a lot of monies.

246
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:14,628
Speaker 0: all you have to do is make a Prototype of the game you want to make with the unity engine which is this 3d browser based platform.

247
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:16,854
Speaker 0: That's actually Surprisingly slick.

248
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:20,050
Speaker 1: So you how do you how do you enter this contest?

249
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,297
Speaker 0: Well, we're gonna link to it.

250
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,090
Speaker 0: basically check out this link and you'll see all the rules.

251
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:29,088
Speaker 0: But you have to make a very simple prototype of your game and tell them you know This is what I want the game to be.

252
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:36,310
Speaker 0: Here's the working super simple basic prototype and they're gonna go through all these rounds and everything and eventually they're gonna pick a winner.

253
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:42,613
Speaker 0: The winner gets 10 grand and help from them to make the game and then they'll help you publish it straight up Mm-hmm.

254
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:49,190
Speaker 0: So if you're in college and you want to make games This is pretty much what you should be doing 10 grand in college.

255
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,817
Speaker 0: That would have changed my entire life.

256
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:53,650
Speaker 1: and you know what if you make a game and it doesn't win?

257
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,670
Speaker 1: I know that the unity engine allows you to make iPhone things.

258
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:04,081
Speaker 1: So if you're gave you spend time making a game and it doesn't win Turn it into an iPhone game and you'll make some bank.

259
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:04,744
Speaker 1: I guarantee it.

260
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:05,950
Speaker 0: now remember I mean think about this.

261
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:06,634
Speaker 0: What do we always see?

262
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,970
Speaker 0: you're not wasting your time, especially on the Monday shows?

263
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,783
Speaker 0: You can't learn something by trying to learn it.

264
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,330
Speaker 0: You can only learn something by doing it.

265
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,086
Speaker 0: So if you think you want to be a game programmer, you're thinking I should learn game programming.

266
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,070
Speaker 0: No, just do it.

267
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,164
Speaker 0: Just enter this contest.

268
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:24,025
Speaker 1: exactly Like if you want to learn how to like use a table saw You can't be like I want to learn how to use a table saw.

269
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:24,790
Speaker 1: just get some wood.

270
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:36,121
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to be like I want to make a birdhouse or I want to make a cabinet and then in the course of Making cabinet you're gonna need that table saw and once you need the table saw You're gonna use it and learn how to use it.

271
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:42,550
Speaker 0: aside if you're using a bandsaw Don't think that you can sand wood with the flat side of the blade.

272
00:16:43,186 --> 00:16:43,712
Speaker 1: Yeah That'll.

273
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:48,290
Speaker 0: I'm gonna point that out because I've seen people do this and I've seen fingers get cut the fuck off.

274
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,455
Speaker 1: Always use proper safety.

275
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:58,201
Speaker 0: when in a wood or metal shop any sort of workshop scenario also a game shop I did not actually see the finger get cut off.

276
00:16:58,241 --> 00:16:58,966
Speaker 1: make and remember.

277
00:16:59,046 --> 00:17:01,976
Speaker 0: I heard ah And it's funny and there was a finger cut.

278
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,285
Speaker 1: funny as it is in that kind of situation.

279
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:05,790
Speaker 1: The goggles do not do nothing.

280
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:11,253
Speaker 1: You need the goggles Okay, but you can.

281
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:14,586
Speaker 1: they will stop the flying splinter of wood from stabbing you in the eye.

282
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:18,036
Speaker 0: submissions go until October 15.

283
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:18,839
Speaker 1: that's a lot of time.

284
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:19,665
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's only.

285
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:20,510
Speaker 1: it's a beginning of September.

286
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:29,225
Speaker 1: That's like a whole month Man, if you got a whole month and you're a college kid and all you need to do is make a prototype of a game You know I think back to college you crank that shit out.

287
00:17:29,285 --> 00:17:32,422

00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:22,448
Speaker 0: I thought this was cute.

307
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:23,451
Speaker 0: I just straight-up.

308
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:24,795
Speaker 0: there's nothing else I can say.

309
00:18:25,216 --> 00:18:28,898
Speaker 0: this is a Venn diagram of mystical beasts.

310
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:35,232
Speaker 0: So it's not like these human Eagle horse Narwhal dog and bull.

311
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:39,910
Speaker 0: and every intersection of all these circles is One or other various mythical beasts.

312
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:48,239
Speaker 0: for example horse and narwhal Unicorn yeah snake and eagle cockatrice lion and man trees cockatrice magic.

313
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,419
Speaker 1: are I like a manticore bull and mermaid?

314
00:18:53,782 --> 00:18:56,960
Speaker 1: What's a bull in a room it gets up there, but I like a hippo canvas.

315
00:18:57,201 --> 00:19:01,636
Speaker 0: I think my favorite part is there's dog dog and dog and in the middle of these three is Cerberus.

316
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about right.

317
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:04,629

Speaker 1: is there human and goat?

320
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:11,360
Speaker 0: They didn't add goat because if they had added goat along with lion they could have gotten like Samara.

321
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,580
Speaker 1: They could have had Seder and chimera, and yeah, they didn't have any of that, but those are magical beasts.

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,784
Speaker 1: What the fuck they've got.

Speaker 0: centaur Pegasus unicorn echidna harpy manticore sound.

324
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:22,340
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with this echidna.

325
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,911
Speaker 1: I thought echidna was like knuckles from Sonic the head clearly knuckles.

326
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:27,776
Speaker 1: the echidna know anything about Greek myth.

327
00:19:28,237 --> 00:19:29,100
Speaker 1: It should be a Lamia.

328
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,289
Speaker 0: Lamia is a type of monster Action is a specific monster.

329
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:40,451
Speaker 0: Scott is very into hot Lamia action as I discovered during final Action is a huge inside joke.

330
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,400
Speaker 0: There's the thing about hot Lamia action.

331
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:47,315
Speaker 0: It is difficult to deny the hotness of that Lamia as we all could agree.

332
00:19:47,355 --> 00:19:49,000
Speaker 1: actually that Lamia was not that hot.

333
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:51,898
Speaker 0: I don't know it for it was actually sort of a bitch Lamia.

334
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:59,540
Speaker 0: well It's really big do she wasn't that much of a bitch considering that we murdered all of her chefs and then her husband.

335
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:03,737
Speaker 1: We murdered her before we murdered her as we murdered them both at about the same time.

336
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:06,948
Speaker 0: in fact We tried to murder him first until she started healing him.

337
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:10,579
Speaker 0: we had to back up and kill her, but yeah, that's anyway poor mr.

338
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,747
Speaker 1: Mashant for Lamia's.

Speaker 1: and Yeah, you check it out.

356
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:24,820
Speaker 0: If you're an adventure game type person so if you are going or Star Wars type person if you're going to go to PAX Which hopefully you are then you should do certain things at PAX like go to our panels.

357
00:21:25,101 --> 00:21:31,958
Speaker 1: That's right, so if you're not going to PAX, and you don't have a badge already your SOL Just stay home.

358
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:40,383
Speaker 0: So on Friday in the Raven Theatre at 1130 in the morning We're doing beyond Candyland.

359
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:43,331
Speaker 0: that is the OMG German board games are the shit.

360
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:46,178
Speaker 0: you should play them panel yep on Saturday morning.

361
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:52,838
Speaker 0: We're doing on Saturday at 1030 a.m.. In the Wolfman theater.

362
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:57,851
Speaker 0: oh I wondered if you were going to make a sound effect or not We are going to be doing.

363
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,060
Speaker 0: losing should be fun.

364
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:02,060
Speaker 0: Which is the panel about how losing should be fun.

365
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:04,791
Speaker 1: Also, I just want to point out that packs.

366
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:07,120
Speaker 1: I don't think they like looked at their whole panel list.

367
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,126
Speaker 0: We already talked about this.

368
00:22:08,589 --> 00:22:09,253
Speaker 1: I'll talk about it again.

369
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:09,776
Speaker 1: Just quickly.

370
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:20,019
Speaker 1: on Friday I think night someone's doing a panel winning sucks Which is basically someone who seems to at least by judging by the panel description completely agree with us.

371
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:24,674
Speaker 1: So they have basically two redundant panels, and I want to go to that other guy's panel.

372
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:28,679
Speaker 1: so we can you know heckle Yeah, you know make nice.

373
00:22:29,401 --> 00:22:30,165
Speaker 0: Hopefully we agree.

374
00:22:30,185 --> 00:22:37,640
Speaker 1: I mean maybe you know I'm pretty sure he's like winning sucks And he's like losing sucks even worse, and we're like losing should be fun and winning should be even more fun.

375
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:40,249
Speaker 1: No, but I think he agrees.

376
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:42,400
Speaker 1: it's someone who agrees with us, and they have the same panel twice.

377
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:45,390
Speaker 0: Oh, well, so I don't think it's a popular idea.

378
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:49,748
Speaker 0: I don't think it's the same panel twice necessarily because remember It's not like they're trying to get like.

379
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,920
Speaker 0: we need a panel on this and a panel on this.

380
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,937
Speaker 1: No, no, but I mean they didn't notice that two panels had basically the same exact.

381
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:56,700
Speaker 1: I don't area.

382
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:01,100
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a matter of not noticing at all because talking to them They seem to have vetted the panels out very well.

383
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:05,940
Speaker 0: I think it's that They picked people who they think have interesting things to say and just put them in rooms.

384
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,985
Speaker 0: And I think that's it.

385
00:23:07,226 --> 00:23:08,090
Speaker 1: and we have the.

386
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,019
Speaker 1: we happen to have the same thing to say someone else.

387
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,000
Speaker 0: I don't think that's that far out there.

388
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,499
Speaker 0: I mean look Luke Crane and Jared Sorenson also have this thing to say and if they were more together They would probably have done a panel like this.

389
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:33,954
Speaker 1: And on Sunday morning if you didn't notice all our panels are basically morning panels one panel Friday morning one panel Saturday morning one panel Sunday morning at 10 a.m We are doing yet again a reprise at PAX Beyond Dungeons & Dragons last time ever at PAX West.

390
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:36,828
Speaker 0: most likely however We are going to be doing it at PAX East.

391
00:23:36,888 --> 00:23:39,320
Speaker 0: we're going to be doing it possibly at the New York Comic Con.

392
00:23:39,883 --> 00:23:46,067
Speaker 0: This panel will never die because people it's gonna die by 2011. see maybe what.

393
00:23:46,087 --> 00:23:48,115
Speaker 0: what if PAX just keeps wanting us to do it every year?

394
00:23:48,216 --> 00:23:48,698
Speaker 1: Well.

395
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:50,144
Speaker 1: I'll say no We're doing something different.

396
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:50,546
Speaker 0: I'll do it.

397
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:51,651
Speaker 1: Let's come up with something different.

398
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,158
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll do something different and I'll do it.

399
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,305
Speaker 1: No, we should replace it.

400
00:23:55,445 --> 00:24:03,009
Speaker 0: why if new people keep wanting to see it until we have a definitive films at least remix it With what it's perfect.

401
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,291
Speaker 1: No.

402
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,477

Speaker 1: That's you know Crook slightly, so why?

404
00:24:07,476 --> 00:24:07,880
Speaker 0: why bother?

405
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,580
Speaker 0: Megato Megatie until we just film it and put the definitive version online we might have to keep doing it.

406
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:23,610
Speaker 0: But Sunday 10 a.m.. In the Raven theater Beyond Dungeons & Dragons Yes beyond that don't come to see that.

Speaker 0: This is anything else going on during it.

442
00:25:51,849 --> 00:25:52,371
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

Speaker 0: To 9 p.m..

445
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,420
Speaker 1: All right Maybe we should Spend six hours of our time in Seattle playing Puerto Rico.

446
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,513
Speaker 0: Well, I imagine you think about if we're playing.

447
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:03,599
Speaker 0: we could ring it.

448
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:06,260
Speaker 0: We could both join the tournament get in the same games and pick a winner.

449
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:08,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how many people are gonna be in the tournament?

450
00:26:09,413 --> 00:26:09,714
Speaker 0: We'll see.

451
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,699
Speaker 0: I don't know how this is gonna work.

452
00:26:10,739 --> 00:26:12,779
Speaker 1: well We'll check it out at con.

453
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,767
Speaker 0: We'll check out the details.

454
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:18,696
Speaker 0: if it is not too much of a hassle I might just enter that because I think I can win.

455
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:19,440
Speaker 0: I can win.

456
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,567
Speaker 0: I think I'm a pretty optimal.

457
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:27,338
Speaker 1: maybe maybe we'll play against each other in the first round and then one of us will just be Out and it'll be real easy.

458
00:26:28,266 --> 00:26:35,037
Speaker 0: You know maybe it'll be a round-robin situation I might have to brush up because I don't remember the exact method to get the factory going well.

459
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:37,077
Speaker 1: Let's play when.

460
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,356
Speaker 1: Okay, so yeah if you're going to PAX do all those things also the game works outside of.

461
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:48,900
Speaker 1: PAX is a good place to Play some games and PAX is closed.

462
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:53,098
Speaker 0: I was thinking about renting the whole place out and having a party, but then I don't have the.

463
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:55,791
Speaker 0: yeah I just couldn't deal with that this year.

464
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:56,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, I called them.

465
00:26:56,736 --> 00:26:57,500
Speaker 0: I had it all set up.

466
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,369
Speaker 0: I just had to like give them money, and I just didn't.

467
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:03,190
Speaker 1: so last year at PAX We ate at a bunch of different restaurants.

468
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:04,820
Speaker 1: Von's was the best restaurant.

469
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,456
Speaker 0: No, this is a terrible restaurant.

470
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:11,566
Speaker 1: You shouldn't eat that If you've never been to Seattle before.

471
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:14,576
Speaker 1: the sci-fi museum is worth like an hour of your time.

472
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,587
Speaker 0: the Space Needle is mini But it's worth seeing.

473
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:17,554
Speaker 0: just don't ride the monorail.

474
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,239
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

475
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,119
Speaker 1: But actually I found out there's a monorail that goes from the airport to the the city.

476
00:27:23,199 --> 00:27:27,380
Speaker 1: yes But it was not built yet, but now it is built so we can use it to get to the city.

477
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,346
Speaker 1: Is it built yeah?

478
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,279
Speaker 0: Oh cuz I went as we could use it.

479
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,513
Speaker 0: I went to a website and it didn't say it worked yet, and I'm pretty sure.

480
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:36,024
Speaker 1: well if we if it's not working if we get There it's not working.

481
00:27:36,105 --> 00:27:42,994
Speaker 1: We'll take a car so it's not a big deal, but yeah There's a. we use the monorail to get from the airport to Seattle on a rail.

482
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:47,678
Speaker 1: I didn't check to see if there's any Football or baseball game, so I don't know about that.

483
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:51,517
Speaker 0: However, do not ride the monorail in Seattle it goes.

484
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,080
Speaker 1: Oh, it's lame.

485
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,430
Speaker 0: I'll tell you this it goes about 15 feet.

486
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,720
Speaker 1: do try to find the secret donut place.

487
00:27:56,983 --> 00:27:58,016
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna tell you where it is.

488
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:02,931
Speaker 0: however It is between The ma isn't in a tree in between packs and the Space Needle.

489
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,603
Speaker 0: it is somewhere in a triangle between the two monorail stops And packs.

490
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:09,514
Speaker 1: there is also this music festival.

491
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,863
Speaker 1: You know Woodstock style Yeah, the bumper chute.

492
00:28:12,883 --> 00:28:18,560
Speaker 1: That's going all weekend including Monday and Pat Monday is Labor Day and packs is not going on Monday.

493

Speaker 1: This is Friday Saturday Sunday.

494
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:28,860
Speaker 1: So you could go to the bumper chute Monday if you're still in Seattle you know and if you are Loser none of a packs badge you can just go to the bumper chute all weekend.

495
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:33,880
Speaker 0: I think next year I'm just gonna take like Tuesday off or Wednesday off and stay in Seattle longer and go to the bumper chute.

496
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:36,072
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we walked around it last year.

497
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:36,716
Speaker 1: We didn't go into it.

498
00:28:36,877 --> 00:28:47,000
Speaker 0: also guys Just let us know because you know I really seriously considered just renting out game works for like Sunday night after packs Because last year it was like some girls about Mitzvah.

499
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:57,416
Speaker 0: So if you guys will attend and you guys want me to do that just email us and for next facts I'll just do it because it wasn't that much money like I could have just paid for it.

500
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:01,415
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm In the exhibition hall.

501
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:02,602
Speaker 1: there are two things You know.

502
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:05,557
Speaker 1: of course there's gonna be a million awesome things in there for you to check out.

503
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,200
Speaker 0: unknown worlds.

504
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:09,700
Speaker 1: Yes, the two things that you should check out just go and give them money.

505
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,145
Speaker 0: Don't even just throw it at them.

506
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:17,866
Speaker 1: unknown worlds creators of natural selection will be there with natural selection to Most likely almost definitely.

507
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:24,126
Speaker 1: just go there and just give them your wallet and take you know whatever they're giving out Unknown worlds.

508
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:32,000
Speaker 1: and number two in the exhibition hall Our friend Eric Marshak the guy who does all of the chalks at the conventions.

509
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,989
Speaker 1: He didn't say what chalk he's doing.

510
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:37,840
Speaker 1: He's being paid by a company to do a chalk a spot He's.

511
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:42,320
Speaker 1: so it's a paid advertising chalks at PAX, and he didn't say what it was.

512
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:49,720
Speaker 1: He has an NDA but on his website He posted a section of an image that included a pointy drill.

513
00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:54,445
Speaker 1: So I would wager it is either a Gurren Lagann not likely.

514
00:29:54,465 --> 00:29:57,212
Speaker 1: it's probably a Bioshock to chalk.

515
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:58,074
Speaker 1: that is my guess.

516
00:29:58,414 --> 00:29:59,657
Speaker 1: I guess only so.

517
00:29:59,878 --> 00:30:02,587
Speaker 1: don't sue him Whoever makes Bioshock.

518
00:30:02,607 --> 00:30:05,557
Speaker 1: - so yeah, but there's gonna be awesome chalk going on.

519
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:06,220
Speaker 1: say hi to him.

520
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,404
Speaker 1: he likes to be interrupted and so he has you know time to stand up and stretch and Such man.

521
00:30:12,464 --> 00:30:14,892
Speaker 0: I didn't look at like anything that's going on.

522
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:18,872
Speaker 0: in terms of the like omega-thon Yeah, it's an omega-thon.

523
00:30:18,972 --> 00:30:20,140
Speaker 1: You'll watch the final round.

524
00:30:20,321 --> 00:30:22,571
Speaker 0: I found that the best way to deal with the omega-thon

525
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,661
Speaker 1: is to do music videos at an anime convention If you

526
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:30,238
Speaker 0: happen to wander into an area where a contest is going on watch it because it's usually great

527
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:30,860
Speaker 1: most definitely

528
00:30:31,102 --> 00:30:39,347
Speaker 0: But it's really doesn't seem to be worth it to stand in line to wait And you'll see the end at the end, and I don't know if they're gonna be able to top What they did last year.

529
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:47,576
Speaker 1: Excitebike - yep also at PAX our Amazing listener row she has printed up There's this PAX button near thing that goes on.

530

Speaker 0: play Leighton outside of packs.

594
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:07,000
Speaker 0: packs is the time to play games with other people?

595
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:10,819
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I'm saying you got it, you know lanes for when you're relaxing in handheld lounge B?

596
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:15,360
Speaker 1: No It's also for when you're in your hotel or in a car on the way to packs.

597
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:17,108

600
00:34:22,976 --> 00:34:23,359
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:23,659
Speaker 1: All right.

602
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:28,915
Speaker 1: So anyway, if you're not at packs, what other games should you be playing?

603
00:34:29,054 --> 00:34:30,800
Speaker 0: should you really be playing games?

604
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,992
Speaker 0: Because clearly you did not want packs enough.

605
00:34:34,313 --> 00:34:36,139
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's Labor Day weekend.

606
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,089
Speaker 1: So the first game you should play is barbecue.

607
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:44,039
Speaker 1: Otherwise Will Smith's gonna say I could have been at a barbecue I could have been at packs.

608
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:47,248
Speaker 1: Drag your ass to the burden desert.

609
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,150
Speaker 1: who's a man?

610
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:50,438
Speaker 1: So be sure to barbecue.

611
00:34:50,498 --> 00:34:58,836
Speaker 1: if you're not a pack Weekend go out in the United States and it's not Labor Day where you are Barbecue anyway, it's still Saturday and Sunday.

612
00:34:58,916 --> 00:35:00,906
Speaker 0: You could barbecue You know what as I've learned.

613
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:09,297
Speaker 1: and if you're in the southern hemisphere where it's cold Barbecue anyway, if you ever have a design in your house to barbecue just do it.

614
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:09,960
Speaker 1: just do it.

615
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,560
Speaker 1: Don't ever hesitate its barbecue weekend around the world.

616
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:14,907
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know you should be doing.

617
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:18,619
Speaker 0: if you're not a packs watch some TED Talks and enter this game contest.

618
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:20,727
Speaker 0: And I don't know edify yourself.

619
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:24,140
Speaker 1: well one game you should play is a free game.

620
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,659
Speaker 1: This Warsaw is basically is basically this open-source FPS But it got really polished and it's a lot like quake.

621
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:46,499
Speaker 1: Only you have this special movement button that makes it really basically it's like quake but bunny hopping is really easy Jumping off of walls is really easy And it's slick and polished and open-source and free for Mac Linux Windows and you can just get it.

622
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,804
Speaker 1: It's WARS.

623
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:52,460
Speaker 1: Oh W just search for it on Google and it's not the greatest game in the universe, but you know what?

624
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,543
Speaker 1: It's real fast.

625
00:35:53,603 --> 00:35:54,286
Speaker 1: It's an FPS.

626
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,229
Speaker 1: It's a lot like quake.

627
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,493
Speaker 1: It's real colorful.

628
00:35:56,614 --> 00:35:57,256
Speaker 1: It looks good.

629
00:35:57,276 --> 00:35:58,440
Speaker 1: I played it a little bit.

630
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,003
Speaker 1: It's nice.

631
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:01,376
Speaker 1: Just get it and it's free.

632
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:01,798
Speaker 1: What the hell?

633
00:36:02,963 --> 00:36:08,900
Speaker 1: Another game you should be playing Because you're not gonna be able to see unknown worlds in the exhibition hall at PAX.

634
00:36:09,462 --> 00:36:12,976
Speaker 1: You're just going to play NS one like a sad sack, but you know NS one.

635
00:36:13,016 --> 00:36:13,860
Speaker 1: I've been playing it lately.

636
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:15,991
Speaker 0: One is still one of my favorite.

637
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:20,485
Speaker 0: I pretty much play natural selection Civ for quake live.

638
00:36:20,686 --> 00:36:21,889
Speaker 1: so make this.

639
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:31,095
Speaker 1: if you're not going to PAX make this your weekend to play NS one and if You don't know how to play NS one Make this your weekend to learn how to play NS one in preparation for NS to.

640
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:32,360
Speaker 0: you want to know how to learn to play?

641
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,943
Speaker 0: NS one.

642
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:37,845
Speaker 0: read the dot read the documentation on the website, which is out of date But still mostly accurate.

643
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:40,456
Speaker 0: and then because that you know back in the day, you know with FPS is I?

644
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,340
Speaker 0: Used to like read the website and it would tell me how to play and then I would play and I'd know what to do And people today don't seem to read the website.

645
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:53,840
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of times the website doesn't have an instruction counter strike, especially for obscure mods.

646
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:04,187
Speaker 0: They don't have the instructions on the site and as does however But as does just join any NS game that isn't combat join a team and then ask the team in the chat What do I do?

647
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:06,299
Speaker 0: and someone will tell you to do something and just do it?

648
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,590
Speaker 1: Make sure you join Marines.

649
00:37:07,812 --> 00:37:09,484
Speaker 1: if you join aliens You're probably just gonna.

650
00:37:09,825 --> 00:37:17,820
Speaker 1: you have a lot more potential to hurt your team very badly and also You're just gonna be a lot harder to be aliens because it requires a lot more FPS skills.

651
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, one bad marine is basically just gonna die alone crying and scared in the dark But he's not gonna bring his team down with it.

652
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,017
Speaker 1: Yeah one Die one shitty alien is gonna basically get a whole bunch of res and not use them for shit and then die.

653
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,880
Speaker 1: and it's gonna Be.

654
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:30,523

723
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:57,140
Speaker 0: and or you think that team fortress 2 is an awesome game play some quake live.

724
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,935
Speaker 1: Quake live is available now for Linux Mac Windows.

725
00:41:00,995 --> 00:41:09,276
Speaker 0: So if you haven't played it yet Any time you think we're too harsh on modern FPS is or you think that we're you know, we're not.

Speaker 0: just go play quake live You'll see what we mean.

727
00:41:11,765 --> 00:41:17,210
Speaker 0: and here Warsaw if you don't set your FOV to at least 120 You're not hardcore Warsaw.

728
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,255
Speaker 1: Let's change the FOV.

729
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:19,220
Speaker 0: You know, what's bad?

730
00:41:20,182 --> 00:41:24,123
Speaker 1: There's an option in the options menu to just change FOV and worse NS.

731
00:41:24,163 --> 00:41:27,220
Speaker 0: it works because NS is a special kind of game but ricochet.

732
00:41:28,042 --> 00:41:32,240
Speaker 0: I had a lot of trouble playing ricochet because I'm so used to an FOV of 129.

733
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, ricochet cannot change the FOV.

734
00:41:34,347 --> 00:41:36,494
Speaker 1: I it's not gonna work.

735
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:40,106
Speaker 0: 129 was necessary and I've gotten to the point You gotta be 90 degrees in ricochet.

736
00:41:40,126 --> 00:41:41,390
Speaker 1: I figure out the angles properly.

737
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:43,959
Speaker 0: No, no, no, I don't know if I can change it.

738
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:45,512
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm allowed to.

739
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:49,008
Speaker 0: oh But I can't play with a 90 anymore.

740
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:52,520
Speaker 1: I forgot that when I play goes and I'll chop your head off with my you will.

741
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,301
Speaker 0: Chainsaw blade is back in the day Like.

742
00:41:54,341 --> 00:42:00,480
Speaker 0: it took me over a year when I started playing counter-strike to learn to play with a low FOV again.

743
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:07,212
Speaker 0: Well, because I used to play like with all the dynamic lighting, you know last year's packs We didn't actually go into the the.

744
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:08,660
Speaker 1: bring your own PC area.

745
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:11,779
Speaker 1: The thing is we can't bring our PCs obviously because you need to register to do that.

746
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,800
Speaker 1: But half the room was just filled with Dells that were already set up and it was a big room.

747
00:42:16,262 --> 00:42:17,166
Speaker 1: So this year I want to.

748
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:21,271
Speaker 1: I want to definitely go in that room a little bit more than last year Maybe get some PC game and go.

749
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:22,420
Speaker 0: I have very fond memories.

750
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:32,800
Speaker 0: I forget what con it was but me and Scott Johnson were doing like the anime programming for some gaming con in Rochester Mm-hmm as we did very often and they had a land gaming area.

751
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:36,478
Speaker 0: So we wandered over there late at night and kind of drunk and played games.

752
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:36,700
Speaker 1: tax.

753
00:42:36,941 --> 00:42:45,611
Speaker 1: I wish packs was just overnight because I would go to that land gaming area Friday night after the concerts and I would go to The tabletop gaming area Saturday night after the concerts.

754
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:46,214
Speaker 1: Well funny.

755
00:42:46,254 --> 00:42:47,640
Speaker 1: You should say that I just wouldn't go to bed.

756
00:42:48,382 --> 00:42:49,389
Speaker 0: Funny you should say that.

757
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:52,704
Speaker 0: let me get back to the packs website Because there was a news.

758
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,589
Speaker 0: our item of interest.

759
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:55,271
Speaker 0: blah blah blah.

760
00:42:55,351 --> 00:42:56,615
Speaker 0: Okay from 830.

761
00:42:56,615 --> 00:43:00,085
Speaker 0: I First want to clear up a common question.

762
00:43:00,105 --> 00:43:01,008
Speaker 0: We've been getting this week.

763
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:01,610
Speaker 0: Yes.

764
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,060
Speaker 0: We are sold out three-day Friday and Saturday badges.

765
00:43:05,481 --> 00:43:10,539
Speaker 0: Yes, this includes walk-up purchases given that we will sell out of Sunday badges in the next day or two.

766
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:12,547
Speaker 1: They're sold out of Sunday badges already.

767
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:16,120
Speaker 0: If you have not purchased a badge online, you will not get into packs.

768
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:18,089
Speaker 0: Please do not try to buy a badge on site.

769
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:20,380
Speaker 0: We have no badges to sell again.

770
00:43:20,782 --> 00:43:22,088
Speaker 0: We have no valid badges to sell.

771
00:43:22,108 --> 00:43:22,831
Speaker 0: we apologize.

772
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:23,173
Speaker 0: Now.

773
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:23,756
Speaker 0: Here's the quote.

774
00:43:23,776 --> 00:43:26,162
Speaker 0: that's interesting Quote.

775
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:32,161
Speaker 0: we are trying to secure more space for 2010 Mm-hmm.

776
00:43:32,603 --> 00:43:33,907
Speaker 0: I don't know what they're gonna get.

777
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:35,592
Speaker 1: Well another interesting remember last year.

778
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:36,916
Speaker 1: The tabletop was in the annex.

779
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:38,080
Speaker 1: this year.

780
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,053
Speaker 1: They got the top floor of the main building.

781
00:43:40,094 --> 00:43:40,879
Speaker 1: They don't have the annex.

782
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:53,299
Speaker 1: So what happened is they're moving all of the console gaming up top and all the a lot of the panel rooms up top and The tabletop is going down where the console and the panel rooms used to be down low.

783
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:54,648
Speaker 1: So that's gonna be.

784
00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:00,197
Speaker 1: it's gonna be a lot more like, you know The other kind of tabletop gaming cons we go to where there's like lots of small rooms.

785
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:05,360
Speaker 0: I think Connecticut I think the tabletop is gonna get a lot more walk-in traffic as a result, which I think will do very well for Luke Crane.

786
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:10,148
Speaker 1: I think you'll do very well for Luke Crane who is again Saturday in tabletop areas.

787
00:44:10,168 --> 00:44:12,698
Speaker 1: look for Luke Crane to play the burning wheels and such.

788
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:15,246
Speaker 0: Yes We will tweet his exact location.

789
00:44:15,346 --> 00:44:18,174
Speaker 0: Once we sort all that business follow the tweets in memory.

790
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:18,956
Speaker 1: There's a it's.

791
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:26,600
Speaker 1: it's hard to do a Search on Twitter for packs because you'll basically find a bunch of searches about peace not anymore.

792
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,289
Speaker 0: You're basically just gonna find packs.

793
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,873
Speaker 1: Well, I searched for pound Pax and that is how you will find the good.

794
00:44:32,893 --> 00:44:33,940
Speaker 0: Well, that's how Twitter works.

795
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,560
Speaker 1: Well, some people just search for you know, just packs on its own.

796
00:44:36,881 --> 00:44:40,474
Speaker 0: I only do that if I'm searching for something obscure like I don't know geek night.

797
00:44:40,515 --> 00:44:40,936
Speaker 1: Yeah.

798
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:41,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all good.

799
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,350
Speaker 1: It's real hard to search for so it's really hard to like.

800
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:44,912
Speaker 1: have I search?

801
00:44:45,053 --> 00:44:46,680
Speaker 1: I do a Twitter search like Python.

802
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,646
Speaker 1: It's like you see all these snakes posts.

803
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:52,597
Speaker 0: How much can people be posting about herpetology on a regular basis?

804
00:44:52,798 --> 00:45:02,895
Speaker 0: be surprised Anyway, but I wonder what they're gonna do and maybe I think the solution for packs would be to either move out of Seattle But that wouldn't really work.

805
00:45:02,976 --> 00:45:03,964
Speaker 1: now It's not gonna happen.

806
00:45:04,205 --> 00:45:09,511
Speaker 0: packs East has a better proposition is if they fill up Boston Which they're definitely gonna do in a few years pretty quickly.

807
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,460
Speaker 0: They could just move it to Baltimore.

808
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's not the best place.

809
00:45:14,669 --> 00:45:16,878
Speaker 0: I think the BCC can handle packs.

810
00:45:16,979 --> 00:45:19,084
Speaker 1: East Building is fine.

811
00:45:19,104 --> 00:45:20,388
Speaker 1: The city is no.

812
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:22,054
Speaker 1: I think they'd be better off.

813
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:23,057
Speaker 1: I don't know.

814
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:23,920
Speaker 1: I don't know.

815
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,540
Speaker 0: There aren't enough hotels in Boston.

816
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:38,032
Speaker 1: I don't think in the what I would do if I was packs though if he needed to expand as I basically get a Ballroom in every hotel because you know like one inches that you know CES right the consumer electronics show in Vegas the way it works Right.

817
00:45:38,073 --> 00:45:40,170
Speaker 1: Is this the main floor in the Convention Center?

818
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:45,270
Speaker 1: But then in all the hotels all like the companies get rooms and stuff.

819
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:48,492
Speaker 1: So it's like yes come to this hotel to check out I don't know.

820
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:54,409
Speaker 1: like company X's TV lineup and they'll have like a you know They'll bring all like reporters over there showing their TVs and stuff.

821
00:45:55,192 --> 00:46:07,383
Speaker 1: If Pax is more like that where suddenly you get like companies or people like getting all the ballrooms and all the hotels to basically Effectively expand packs so that like there's a route everyone in your hotel.

822
00:46:07,423 --> 00:46:09,789
Speaker 1: The ballroom has game and go hood on, you know.

823
00:46:10,571 --> 00:46:13,478
Speaker 1: Oh also a Pax badge pickup is at the Hyatt.

824
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,122
Speaker 1: It's not at the Convention Center.

825
00:46:15,142 --> 00:46:15,684
Speaker 1: It's at the Hyatt.

826
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:16,726
Speaker 1: Don't mess that up.

827
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:18,533
Speaker 1: I Think that's it.

828
00:46:19,299 --> 00:46:25,916
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much but I Feel like Pax is gonna have in the long run Hopefully 24/7 content.

829
00:46:25,956 --> 00:46:28,104
Speaker 0: if they don't maybe we'll try to make that happen.

830
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:31,870
Speaker 1: Maybe we will but Pax Whoa, whoa, that's an idea.

831
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:37,051
Speaker 0: But you know we keep saying we want to make the geek nights like a gaming con like a little thing and be just make It.

832
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:39,563
Speaker 1: just make it night at Pax instead geeky nights.

833
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:41,090
Speaker 1: It just be night at Pax.

834
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:42,529
Speaker 0: It's so trivial to do.

835
00:46:42,731 --> 00:46:52,725
Speaker 0: All we have to do is rent a hotel ballroom after between the hours of Pax closing and tax opening Just pick one of the hotels in Seattle and rent the rooms and sort it all out.

836
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,551
Speaker 1: and then we got to promote it big Time.

837
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:55,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, that wouldn't be hard to do.

838
00:46:55,876 --> 00:46:56,939
Speaker 0: I'm sure we could work something out.

839
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,083
Speaker 0: That's geek nights.

840
00:46:58,304 --> 00:46:59,950
Speaker 0: that that might happen.

841
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:02,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that's gonna be worked on.

842
00:47:02,824 --> 00:47:07,845
Speaker 1: we could do that at Otacon too Like hey Otacon after the doors closed everyone come to this hotel ballroom.

843
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,050
Speaker 0: I would rather do it for Pax.

844
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, me too.

845
00:47:10,855 --> 00:47:15,109
Speaker 1: And basically if you have a Pax badge, we'll let you in and that'll be our policy, huh?

846
00:47:18,173 --> 00:47:19,533
Speaker 0: This is Going to.

847
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:22,527
Speaker 0: you will hear news on this fairly quickly.

848
00:47:22,588 --> 00:47:24,958
Speaker 0: after pack We get some sponsors as I sort.

849
00:47:24,978 --> 00:47:29,600
Speaker 1: hopefully sumo will sponsor us so we can fill the room with bean bags And won't have to pay to rent tables and chairs.

850
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,270
Speaker 0: All they have to do is pay me in bean bags.

851
00:47:31,611 --> 00:47:32,093
Speaker 1: I know right.

852
00:47:32,133 --> 00:47:34,964
Speaker 1: I'll say they got a. sumo has a green bean bag.

853
00:47:35,004 --> 00:47:39,083
Speaker 1: now when I move a green bag Yes, when I move them getting one, I'm getting probably getting like three.

854
00:47:39,123 --> 00:47:42,138
Speaker 1: I think I might get red green blue Even though they're expensive.

855
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:42,904
Speaker 1: It's worth it.

856
00:47:42,924 --> 00:47:50,656
Speaker 0: All right I think we're done because I want to pack for packs and play games and packs Fuck.
