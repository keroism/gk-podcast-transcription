1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,769
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 21st, 2023.

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:10,010
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:14,015
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,603
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:24,940
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about gaming furniture, but not desk chairs for PC gamers.

6
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:27,297
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,286
Speaker 1: So we're doing all sorts of new setup.

8
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:36,600
Speaker 1: We're actually streaming this episode live into a Discord stage in the official Geek Nights Discord.

9
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:39,780
Speaker 1: It's also streaming to YouTube, where I see some people watching.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,460
Speaker 1: Though, YouTube viewership has dropped off precipitously now that we're in the Discord, which already says something about where people prefer to see this stuff.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,920
Speaker 0: They finally added video and screen sharing to Discord stages, so I suppose we can now do all the things we shit-talked about doing.

12
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,810
Speaker 0: If they were to add that feature, they added the feature.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,800
Speaker 0: Uh-oh, uh-oh, we might have to shit-talk.

14
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:07,956
Speaker 1: We both got into, and I'm assuming a lot of people got into it, but the Adobe Podcasts, like, alpha, I guess?

15
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:08,778
Speaker 1: Maybe beta?

16
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:09,860
Speaker 0: Early access.

17
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:10,365
Speaker 0: It's a beta.

18
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:11,360
Speaker 0: They said it's beta.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,684
Speaker 1: They said it's beta.

20
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:15,116
Speaker 1: There's not a lot in there yet compared to what they said.

21
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:15,900
Speaker 1: this thing's gonna do.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,214
Speaker 0: But it's not a lot in there, but it seems to have everything you need.

23
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:21,940
Speaker 0: It lets you record a podcast.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,180
Speaker 0: It dramatically improves the audio quality with minimal effort.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:31,240
Speaker 1: Unless you're us, where it actually degrades the audio quality by a tiny bit.

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,851
Speaker 0: But the point is, the terms of effort versus quality, right?

27
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:38,260
Speaker 0: Someone who doesn't know what the hell they're doing can get amazing quality.

28
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,449
Speaker 0: And then you can send really simple invite links to people.

29
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,399
Speaker 0: They click it, they join, and now they're in the podcast talking to you.

30
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:49,172
Speaker 0: All they need is, you know, a web browser, right?

31
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,560
Speaker 0: And to give it microphone permissions.

32
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:58,600
Speaker 0: And then, when you're done with your podcast, you can push save, and it will save just a WAV file of the whole recording, right?

33
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,999
Speaker 0: It won't be multi-track, I don't think.

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,107
Speaker 1: That's fatal to us.

35
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:03,981
Speaker 0: Yeah.

36
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:14,660
Speaker 0: But, and then, it makes a text transcript that you can edit in their nice UI, and when you push save to download the WAV, it also downloads the text file of the text transcript.

37
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,420
Speaker 0: Which is, that's the feature that, you know, we don't have at all right now, and we want desperately.

38
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:29,220
Speaker 1: Well, also, there's one thing, the synchronized recording, especially if they support multi-track at some point, and I want to give a lot of feedback to them.

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,080
Speaker 1: There is a step in the Geek Nights process that we only had to do when COVID happened, and we started doing the show remotely.

40
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,311
Speaker 1: Granted, it's actually, now it's easier to do the show remotely than in person.

41
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,260
Speaker 1: So, like, doing the show in person would be a special occasion.

42
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:58,680
Speaker 1: But Scott's clock on his audio interface is slightly jittery, and the tiniest bit, like, 0.1% slower than my clock, and all the clocks that I'm synchronized with.

43
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:10,580
Speaker 1: So, I have a step in the process to synchronize our audio, which is a minor step, but I have to do it, and I have to do it manually, because there's no good automatic way to do that, and it takes about 60 seconds.

44
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:13,180
Speaker 1: So, that would save me 60 seconds if I don't have to do that anymore.

45
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:21,019
Speaker 0: The point, I think what they would love to see them do is add a plugin for Audition for Adobe Podcasts.

46
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,340
Speaker 1: Oh, just give me fucking time code.

47
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:26,145
Speaker 0: Right, well, this is how I imagine it, right?

48
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:35,140
Speaker 0: One person opens Audition, and they make a multi-track session, and they send invite codes to people, and those people are using Adobe Podcasts.

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,025
Speaker 0: They don't even know Audition is happening, right?

50
00:03:37,547 --> 00:03:42,220
Speaker 0: But then, each of those people shows up in the Audition on their own track, right?

51
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:47,580
Speaker 0: And then, in the Audition, they make, like, a new tab where the transcript is or some shit, right?

52
00:03:47,660 --> 00:04:01,080
Speaker 0: And now, everyone except the one producer person is just using Adobe Podcasts, like, on the web like normal, but the one producer person has Audition open, everyone's on their own track, and you still get the transcript feature.

53
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:10,400
Speaker 0: And the recordings, all those people on their individual tracks are getting that, you know, improved quality automatically from Adobe Podcasts.

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:19,856
Speaker 1: And if they get to that point, I would say that would make Adobe Podcasts, like, it would become what cool that it was for the audio industry, for the modern podcasting industry.

55
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,879
Speaker 1: I think people would just ditch their pipelines for that.

56
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:25,720
Speaker 1: I think even Pro Studios would ditch their pipelines.

57
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:39,460
Speaker 0: We could probably talk about this in some other episode, but I think it's really interesting what's happening in the podcasting landscape right now, where, on the one hand, people who are trying to make money with podcasts, I think, are doing a little bit worse right now.

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,649
Speaker 0: Especially the companies that went into podcasting, like Spotify and whatever, right?

59
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:50,900
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not making them that much money, but demand for podcasts is up, it seems, from listeners.

60
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:54,119
Speaker 1: And I think podcasts, overall, is a way bigger space.

61
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,161
Speaker 0: Right.

62
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:01,889
Speaker 0: Sponsor money seems a bit down, and also professional podcast production quantity.

63
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:09,240
Speaker 0: It seems like there are less pro people making podcasts, and less, you know, amateur people, like us, making podcasts.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Speaker 0: I guess, technically, we're professional.

65
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:13,380
Speaker 0: Maybe we can get some listeners.

66
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:24,819
Speaker 1: It's funny, because I think, when I look at our old numbers, relative to the podcasting space, there was an era where Geek Nights was weird, like unduly big relative to the podcasting space, but then...

67
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:27,400
Speaker 0: I think a lot of those older numbers are also wrong.

68
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:28,374
Speaker 1: Well...

69
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,839
Speaker 0: A lot of those older numbers are wrong.

70
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,019
Speaker 1: I think there were podcatchers that were dodgy and were downloaded a bunch of times.

71
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

72
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:38,477
Speaker 0: Those are wrong numbers, you know.

73
00:05:38,678 --> 00:05:38,920
Speaker 0: Anyway.

74
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,019
Speaker 1: But, uh, there's a... Well, there's one risky thing in the setup, I'll just tell you.

75
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,700
Speaker 1: I'm using an out-of-spec, because it's so long, USB-C cable to connect the audio interface.

76
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,475
Speaker 1: That is, PreSonus says, "Do not fucking use

77
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:53,979
Speaker 1: extenders.".

78
00:05:54,361 --> 00:05:57,295
Speaker 1: So far, it seems to be working fine, but I'm taking that risk.

79
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:58,340
Speaker 1: I tested this thoroughly.

80
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,320
Speaker 1: But this is the production test with the super long USB-C cable.

81
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,410
Speaker 0: Okay.

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,500
Speaker 0: So yeah, in the news... No, we haven't done a Tuesday episode since then.

83
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,380
Speaker 1: We did a Tuesday episode the day it was, like, right before it came out, so we speculated.

84
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:18,577
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,530
Speaker 0: So anyway, what happened in that Nintendo Direct?

86
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:23,720
Speaker 0: Well, a bunch of stuff we don't really care about, right?

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,480
Speaker 0: Stuff we do care about, like the new Zelda game, but what are we gonna say about it?

88
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,719
Speaker 1: The new Advantage Wars game, guess what, RIM's gonna play again.

89
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,816
Speaker 0: Like... Yeah, it was already announced, but now they got a firm date.

90
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:36,580
Speaker 0: It's definitely coming.

91
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:49,580
Speaker 0: The biggest news was that they done the obvious thing that they should have did a long time ago, which is that they added Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games to the Nintendo Online emulator, right?

92
00:06:49,660 --> 00:07:02,160
Speaker 0: So if you have a Switch and you pay for Nintendo Online, then for free, you can play a selection of Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color games on your Switch in what's basically an emulator.

93
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,900
Speaker 0: And you might say, "Well, Scott, you know, why do you care about that?

94
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,605
Speaker 0: You have the upgraded GBA.

95
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:12,740
Speaker 0: You already have every single Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance game ever, right?

96
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,799
Speaker 0: On an upgraded system with an IPS screen, and it's like, why the hell do you want this,

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,020
Speaker 0: right?".

98
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,725
Speaker 0: So there's two answers, actually.

99
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:32,719
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna, you know, unlike the NES, SNES, N64 emulators that they have, which aren't really any improvement over, you know, the ones you might get illicitly.

100
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:36,740
Speaker 1: Well, except they have that really good rewind feature that I use heavily.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:58,355
Speaker 0: That's, right, so that's the first thing, is that in some of the emulators, I don't think the N64 one has it, but they have this rewind feature, which is basically the emulator is constantly making save states all the time, and you can press L and R, like, together, and then rewind, like if you fall into a pit, you can just be like,

102
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:58,816
Speaker 0: "Whoopsie!"

103
00:07:58,916 --> 00:08:00,980
Speaker 0: and come out of the pit and jump again immediately.

104
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:05,260
Speaker 0: You don't need to, like, constantly press save state, load state, save state, load state.

105
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,880
Speaker 0: It's like, just when you make a mistake, you go boop, and you rewind the game a little bit.

106
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,743
Speaker 0: And, is that cheating?

107
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:19,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously, but I'm not gonna sit here and play Gargoyle's Quest legitimately in the year 2023.

108
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm 41, I ain't got time for that.

109
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:28,160
Speaker 0: But, but playing Gargoyle's Quest with the cheating feature is actually a fun time.

110
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:36,059
Speaker 0: Like, that game has a lot of merit, it's just hard as balls, and if you make it easy, now it's like an okay, pretty good game with some interesting stuff going on.

111
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,903
Speaker 0: So, that's a good value.

112
00:08:40,424 --> 00:09:02,240
Speaker 0: The second reason that these emulators, I think, are worth it, and I would prefer to use them over even my fancy upgraded GBA, is that, yeah, okay, the Switch is nicer, it's got an even better screen, even better Bluetooth audio, whatever, you know, whatever, but, they went to the effort of emulating the multiplayer.

113
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:16,440
Speaker 0: So, if you bust open the Mario Kart Super Circuit GBA ROM on the Nintendo Switch Online, you can play it wirelessly against your friends who also have Switches and also have Nintendo Online.

114
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,715
Speaker 0: That is huge, assuming it works.

115
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,178
Speaker 0: The illicit emulators don't have that working, right?

116
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,800
Speaker 1: Nintendo does not have a track record of that working.

117
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:39,440
Speaker 0: I think it works, and the one last thing, which isn't new for the Switch, but was news to me, is that, you know, on the Wii U, they had Virtual Console.

118
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:51,880
Speaker 0: So, they also had Virtual Console on the Wii, but on the Wii U, the Virtual Console did include some GBA games and such, you know, because the Wii U was kind of like a portable deal, almost like the Switch, right?

119
00:09:52,641 --> 00:10:03,800
Speaker 0: And one of the games they released on the Wii U Virtual Console was Mario Advance 4, which is just a re-release of Mario 3 with different graphics, basically, but not quite the same as Mario All-Stars.

120
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,106
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, why do you care about a re-release of Mario 3?

121
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:14,740
Speaker 0: You could just play Mario 3, and Mario 3 NES version is already in the Switch Online emulator.

122
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:36,520
Speaker 0: It's because I didn't know until like a couple days ago that Mario Advance 4 Remake of Mario 3 for the GBA had an e-reader feature in which there were many, many levels, like a whole bunch of levels that you could only get if you had an e-reader and you had the cards, and a lot of those cards were Japan only.

123
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:41,980
Speaker 0: So, there's a whole bunch of Mario levels that I never knew existed that are official from Nintendo levels.

124
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,894
Speaker 1: I learned about this looking at that conversation.

125
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:56,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only way to play them until recently was to get a GBA, an e-reader, and those cards or replicas of those cards.

126
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:08,660
Speaker 0: When they released the game for the Virtual Console on the Wii U, which nobody had, they included all of those levels, all of them, even the ultra-rare Cocobean ones.

127
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 0: And in the release on the Switch, I confirmed it, I played them myself, the levels are there.

128
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:31,480
Speaker 0: So, if you want to play these Mario levels that have basically been inaccessible to most people, right, in the US especially, open up Mario Advance 4 Remake of Mario 3 in the GBA emulator on Nintendo Online on your Switch.

129
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:41,120
Speaker 0: And when you go to make a new game, it's going to be like File 1, File 2, File 3, and there's going to be another option that says something else, like something else levels.

130
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:48,980
Speaker 0: And you click on that, and it'll take you to a different Mario, yeah, card level or something, I don't know, level card maybe.

131
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,485
Speaker 0: It takes you to another overworld map.

132
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:58,040
Speaker 0: that's not the normal one, where you can choose between Mario and Luigi and pick any of these e-reader levels and just play them.

133
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,139
Speaker 0: So, I plan to play all of those levels.

134
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:16,300
Speaker 1: Last thing I'll point out, of all the games in there, if you are younger than us, you may have never encountered or thought about the Super Mario Land games, but Super Mario Land 2 is like a top-tier Game Boy Mario that is overlooked by a lot of people.

135
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:24,600
Speaker 1: It is not a full Wario game, but it is the first step toward Wario-like games, and Wario makes his appearance there.

136
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,150
Speaker 0: It's interesting that they put out Wario 3, but not Wario 2.

137
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,640
Speaker 0: They gotta be coming out with Wario 2 and 4 soon, you gotta imagine that, right?

138
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:33,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, Wario games!

139
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:44,160
Speaker 0: They also have Mario Super Circuit, but Mario Kart Super Circuit is the best, in my opinion, the best Mario Kart because there is no luck in that one.

140
00:12:44,561 --> 00:13:06,020
Speaker 0: If you drive perfectly and drift around every corner and never touch the dirt and never bump into a wall and never get in the water or the mud or mess up in any way and drive perfectly, the blue shell or the red shell in that game will follow you right on your ass, but will not touch you until you decelerate or tap the brake.

141
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:14,540
Speaker 0: So it's a perfect skill game, if you can run every course perfectly, you will never get shelled in that game.

142
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,078
Speaker 0: And so I like that Mario Kart the best, I was really good at it.

143
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,289
Speaker 0: And if you haven't played Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga, that's an all-time great RPG on there.

144
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:30,819
Speaker 0: that's like a JRPG that you can actually play without lots of random encounters.

145
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:42,837
Speaker 0: And Game Boy Tetris on there, which is I guess empirically not as good as other Tetrises, but Game Boy Tetris, it hits different, right?

146
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,139
Speaker 0: You gotta play the Game Boy Tetris.

147
00:13:47,662 --> 00:13:53,379
Speaker 1: That was terrifyingly revolutionary when it was first available, and it's easy to forget that.

148
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:05,420
Speaker 0: That Tetris movie they're coming out with apparently is like a ridiculous dramatization of what it took to bring Tetris out of the Soviet Union.

149
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,899
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine that as a hundred minutes of content.

150
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:16,900
Speaker 0: And I just saw in the trailer there was a scene where like in a jokey top secret lab and it's like, we're gonna show you something no one's allowed to see.

151
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,738
Speaker 0: This is the Game Boy.

152
00:14:19,641 --> 00:14:20,540
Speaker 0: It's like, okay.

153
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:36,850
Speaker 1: So in some other Nintendo news, in a headline I never thought I would say ever in my life, Microsoft signs a 10-year contract to bring Xbox games to Nintendo consoles.

154
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,059
Speaker 1: Let that sink in a little bit.

155
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,780
Speaker 0: So the real deal here, and this is such a transparent move.

156
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:54,320
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I think we're- I saw this, when I first saw this I thought it was a fake, and then I saw it was real, and I realized that I had the exact same initial reaction you did.

157
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,751
Speaker 0: Every single news outlet has the same reaction.

158
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,040
Speaker 0: It's like this is the most obvious move.

159
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,280
Speaker 0: It's like you couldn't be more, it's like playing with an open hand in poker, right?

160
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:17,219
Speaker 0: So there is currently a lawsuit going down to block Activision, Blizzard, and Microsoft from all merging together into some- And Activision, Blizzard stock.

161
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:22,979
Speaker 0: I suppose I probably own everything indirectly through total stock market ETFs.

162
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,920
Speaker 1: Oh, I own it directly.

163
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,740
Speaker 0: Index funds.

164
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,976
Speaker 1: Actually, I also own a bunch of Nintendo, so yeah.

165
00:15:31,477 --> 00:15:32,400
Speaker 1: Nothing I say is advice.

166
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, the FTC said that it would attempt to block this deal if it were to happen, right?

167
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:45,698
Speaker 0: So in order to look non-competitive, what they're gonna do is they're gonna be like, "Alright, well look, we'll get Call of

168
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:45,979
Speaker 0: Duty.".

169
00:15:46,741 --> 00:15:53,279
Speaker 0: They promised they would have Call of Duty on PlayStation for some amount of time, and everyone's like, "Yeah, as soon as that deal expires, they're gonna cut it off," right?

170
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:55,899
Speaker 0: So Call of Duty would become Xbox only.

171
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,925
Speaker 0: So now they made another deal with Nintendo.

172
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:00,929
Speaker 0: that's like a binding 10-year deal.

173
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:05,920
Speaker 0: that's like guaranteed Call of Duty on Switch for 10 years, right?

174
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:19,300
Speaker 0: To basically say, "Look, look, we're not gonna be a monopoly anti-competitive using our very popular Call of Duty game to strong arm the whole game industry and force Xbox to become popular," right?

175
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,231
Speaker 0: "We're gonna keep the Call of Duty cross-platform.

176
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,617
Speaker 0: We proved it with this 10-year

177
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:23,838
Speaker 0: deal.".

178
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:32,426
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Dude, it's just an obvious long play to get the deal done, to keep the FTC away,".

179
00:16:32,446 --> 00:16:39,791
Speaker 0: and then 10 years from now, shut down Sony and Nintendo and be like, "All you Call of Duty people gotta get Xboxes," right?

180
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:01,480
Speaker 1: And it just become Windows gaming, and the hardware doesn't matter anymore, but it's hard to speculate in that space, partly because no one's buying computers anymore.

181
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:06,060
Speaker 0: That's what Microsoft wanted to do with the first Xbox, and they never succeeded, and then they gave up on it.

182
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:19,140
Speaker 1: And now nobody, only turbo nerds even build gaming PCs anymore, so this might be good for Call of Duty long-term anyway, and even drive adoption, similarly to how Fortnite being on everything just gets more people playing Fortnite.

183
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,147
Speaker 0: So basically this whole article is like, "Here's all the countries that are trying to block it,".

184
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,512
Speaker 0: and at the bottom it's like, "Here's the countries that have approved

185
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:27,613
Speaker 0: it.".

186
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:30,178
Speaker 0: Chile, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Serbia.

187
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,360
Speaker 1: The end of the list.

188
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,904
Speaker 1: That is some great company to be in right there.

189
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,835
Speaker 1: It's like when you see, "Who still uses the imperial system instead of metric for

190
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:40,215
Speaker 1: everything?".

191
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:42,239
Speaker 1: It's like, "Oh, the US, Libya...".

192
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:43,720
Speaker 0: The bad countries.

193
00:17:46,823 --> 00:17:49,340
Speaker 0: All right, one last tiny news.

194
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, one little thing.

195
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:03,080
Speaker 0: So Magic the Gathering, a game I played for less than three years of my life, but it's left a major impact on myself and the gaming world, and we've talked about nonstop.

196
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:08,715
Speaker 0: They are coming out with some Lord of the Rings themed magic sets.

197
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:10,359
Speaker 0: It's a Middle Earth MTG.

198
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,302
Speaker 0: It's like, "You know what?

199
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,204
Speaker 0: That is a great move,".

200
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:30,500
Speaker 0: because even someone like me who would not collect magic cards, who would not get back into magic, who would not write for all the reasons, the gambling reasons, the collecting reasons, I could see that and be like, "You know, that magic set...".

201
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,888
Speaker 0: It's like you could do this with any old magic set.

202
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:36,556
Speaker 0: Just be like, "Just get together with your friends and be like, 'You know what?

203
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:37,819
Speaker 0: What's the new magic

204
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:38,100
Speaker 0: set?'"

205
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,678
Speaker 0: Some kind of... I don't know.

206
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,793
Speaker 1: Like, "Hey, that throws..." That's column.

207
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,300
Speaker 1: Like, whatever.

208
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:53,360
Speaker 0: No, not that, but you could just pick a magic set and be like, "Friends, let's play only that magic set, and that way we won't get sucked into the magic world," right?

209
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:07,400
Speaker 0: But when you make it with a different theme that's not in the theme and the setting of the rest of Magic the Gathering, it makes that some, you know, especially a setting you like or know about or care about or identify with, that makes that option even more appealing.

210
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:17,900
Speaker 0: Like, "Hey, friends, I know none of us play magic or like magic or want to do collecting or gambling on cards, but we could get these Lord of the Rings magic cards and play just those amongst

211
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,060
Speaker 0: us.".

212
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,862
Speaker 1: Yeah, we all agree.

213
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,144
Speaker 1: Nobody gets sweaty.

214
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:28,280
Speaker 1: No one uses a card outside of this set, and anyone who spends too much money buying, like, further Lord of the Rings expansions gets kicked out of our friends' circle forever.

215
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,221
Speaker 0: Right.

216
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:34,540
Speaker 0: You could just... You could even... Probably what you would do is just buy the box of boosters and draft a few times, right?

217
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,879
Speaker 0: And then maybe play some more with all the cards once all the packs are open, and that's it, right?

218
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,106
Speaker 0: Or you could recombine the cards to make a drafting cube after everyone got familiar with the cards from the regular draft.

219
00:19:46,266 --> 00:20:01,323
Speaker 0: Anyway, that seems like a good option, but it turns out that because the demand is so high, the pre-order price for a 36-pack draft box is now close to $400.

220
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:02,628
Speaker 0: So, no.

221
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,620
Speaker 0: That will not be happening.

222
00:20:07,202 --> 00:20:07,522
Speaker 1: Yep.

223
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:22,281
Speaker 1: So, the other reason this is important, I think, is rather than making a separate Lord of the Rings game to try to capture that lucrative "nerds who like games who also like Lord of the Rings but don't already play magic" demographic... Just... It's magic.

224
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:25,666
Speaker 1: Like, you already got a stable of game designers.

225
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:27,989
Speaker 1: Like, you have a whole pipeline to crank these things out.

226
00:20:28,449 --> 00:20:36,660
Speaker 1: I think this is going to bring a bunch of people to the table, literally, who only care about Lord of the Rings and barely even know this is magic.

227
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:38,843
Speaker 0: I don't know.

228
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:42,540
Speaker 0: They had Transformers magic cards, and I don't know how well those did or anything.

229
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:54,480
Speaker 0: I feel like the Transformers... They definitely have decided to go all in with the intellectual... Because it used to be that, like, you know, the intellectual property was magic itself.

230
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,660
Speaker 0: And then any other intellectual property was a different game or a different company entirely, right?

231
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:12,278
Speaker 0: And now, it seems like finally, after 20, 30 years of magic, there's been a cave-in where it's like everything except Pokémon, basically, is going to be like, "Fine.

232
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:13,460
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

233
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,419
Speaker 0: We'll just put all the intellectual properties on magic

234
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:17,540
Speaker 0: cards.".

235
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,478
Speaker 0: Magic will be the only CCG and we'll just be like, "Alright,

236
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:22,779
Speaker 0: fine.".

237
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:36,937
Speaker 0: And now people are going to show up to play Magic the Gathering and they're going to be like, "Fucking, you know, I put down a forest and I summon Optimus Prime and Gollum and Rainbow Dash and fucking Mr.

238
00:21:36,977 --> 00:21:39,440
Speaker 0: Monopoly and

239
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,820
Speaker 0: Gundam.".

240
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:44,478
Speaker 0: Not a Gundam, probably, but, you know, whatever intellectual properties...

241
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,260
Speaker 1: Any IP that's not owned by a Japanese company that's trying to make its own much less lucrative deals in similar card games.

242
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:58,200
Speaker 0: Basically, anything that's not Disney and anything that's not, you know, some Japanese CCG already, right?

243
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:15,500
Speaker 0: A GI Joe, a Ghostbusters, a Ninja Turtle, a Street Fighter, all that kind of stuff is going to be some... I mean, the only thing so far that I know about are the Transformers and the Lord of the Rings, but you have to imagine everything else that can is going to end up on a magic card.

244
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:16,884
Speaker 1: Yup.

245
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:21,240
Speaker 1: I feel like this is going to be very lucrative, especially based on that initial demand.

246
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:24,859
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so too.

247
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,380
Speaker 1: I'll leave out that Wall Street thing for another time.

248
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,260
Speaker 0: I wonder how long it can be lucrative for, especially if they add this to the MTG online.

249
00:22:30,661 --> 00:22:41,482
Speaker 1: I thought magic was going to die after they released Fallen Empires because it felt like they were making expansions too quickly, and they were diluting the card pool, and tournaments were getting weird, and... Yeah!

250
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:48,600
Speaker 1: Middle School Rim was the wrongest he could have possibly been about how good magic was doing.

251
00:22:50,673 --> 00:22:50,987
Speaker 0: Like... Yup.

252
00:22:57,132 --> 00:22:59,590
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

253
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,703
Speaker 1: So, Paisanos, you might have watched the terrible Super Mario Bros.

254
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:05,830
Speaker 1: Super Show, the cartoon and the live action.

255
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:08,050
Speaker 1: Not going to mince words, like...

256
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,370
Speaker 0: There were some positive aspects.

257
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,685
Speaker 1: There were positive aspects, and as a kid, I watched every single episode, like, religiously.

258
00:23:14,705 --> 00:23:16,169
Speaker 1: I made my parents, like, record it.

259
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,930
Speaker 1: Because it was on while we were at school, and we'd get home, and we'd rewind and watch that tape.

260
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:23,653
Speaker 1: Uh oh.

261
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:26,770
Speaker 1: We went to school the first day it premiered.

262
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:31,470
Speaker 1: We got home from school, and we were going absolutely apeshit.

263
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,846
Speaker 1: And when we get home, our dad, who had recorded it for us, is just like, "Kids, I got real bad news.

264
00:23:37,987 --> 00:23:39,090
Speaker 1: I don't know how to break this to

265
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:39,250
Speaker 1: you.".

266
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,729
Speaker 1: And we're like, "Oh no, did you not record

267
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:40,790
Speaker 1: it?".

268
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,413
Speaker 1: He's like, "No, no, I recorded it.

269
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,397
Speaker 1: It's real bad.

270
00:23:44,978 --> 00:23:50,209
Speaker 1: Like, it is so much worse than I expected that I just wanted to warn

271
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:50,329
Speaker 1: you.".

272
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:56,930
Speaker 1: And then, you know, us being, you know, stupid kids with KidBrain, we watched it, and we thought it was great.

273
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,984
Speaker 1: It was the best fucking thing I'd ever seen since Vampire Hunter D, so...

274
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:09,990
Speaker 0: KidBrain works... There were definitely some things... There were definitely some things that my parents thought were, like, you know, not good, right?

275
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:11,755
Speaker 1: Oh, he just thought it was badly done.

276
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:15,767
Speaker 1: Like, it was lazy and derivative, and the voice acting was bad.

277
00:24:15,807 --> 00:24:16,750
Speaker 1: My dad had opinions.

278
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,958
Speaker 0: But there were, yeah, my parents also, they had opinions.

279
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:22,763
Speaker 0: They were like, "Oh, that cartoon is no good.

280
00:24:22,803 --> 00:24:24,007
Speaker 0: That cartoon is, you know, is

281
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:24,348
Speaker 0: funny.".

282
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:24,950
Speaker 0: Whatever, right?

283
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:35,670
Speaker 0: And then there were other ones that they actually liked, and nowadays I see that, like, oh, you know, my dad, when I was a kid, and I thought every cartoon on TV was the best, right?

284
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:39,730
Speaker 0: My dad singled out, like, Rocko's Modern Life as actually being watchable.

285
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:39,971
Speaker 1: Yup.

286
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:46,988
Speaker 1: I remember my dad singled out, of all that anime I was watching, he was like, "Tenchi Muyo is way better than that Sailor Whatever you were watching

287
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:47,369
Speaker 1: before.".

288
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:49,848
Speaker 1: And my mom was deep into Ultraminer anime.

289
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:54,104
Speaker 0: And it's like, nowadays, I realize, it's like, yeah, they had the correct taste, right?

290
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:55,850
Speaker 0: So that was better than the other cartoons.

291
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,148
Speaker 0: I mean, KidBrain just...

292
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,346
Speaker 1: KidBrain has a serotonin hole, and you just cram stuff into that hole.

293
00:25:01,386 --> 00:25:02,230
Speaker 1: Doesn't matter what it is.

294
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so what's your actual thing of the day?

295
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,772
Speaker 1: The day is a YouTube video I bumped into.

296
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:23,650
Speaker 1: that is the entirety of the first season of this show, both the live-action and the animated segments, including the Zelda segments, from 1989, in one long nine-hour video, just back-to-back with no commercials.

297
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,269
Speaker 1: It's like those Daykiller tapes of The Simpsons we used to watch at RIT.

298
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,570
Speaker 0: I remember this thing just being easily available on DVD, though.

299
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,369
Speaker 1: It is, I have... It's not hard to get.

300
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,343
Speaker 1: Hey, you want some DVDs?

301
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:32,829
Speaker 1: I got 'em.

302
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:34,548
Speaker 0: No.

303
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:38,001
Speaker 1: But this is, like, full quality on YouTube.

304
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,910
Speaker 1: Like, honestly, it looks better than the DVDs I've got.

305
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:52,330
Speaker 1: And if you wanted to see what I put into that serotonin hole in my brain when I was young and stupid, here's nine hours of it just mainlined, ready to go.

306
00:25:53,771 --> 00:26:00,990
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's a thing of the day that crosses over between the technology, the gaming, and also the anime worlds, right?

307
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:04,060
Speaker 0: So in the anime world, there's a thing known as the Itano Circus.

308
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:05,565
Speaker 0: We've talked about it before.

309
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:07,230
Speaker 0: There's an animator, Ichiro Itano.

310
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,130
Speaker 0: He worked on things such as Macross.

311
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:21,429
Speaker 0: And whenever you watch an anime and you see some mech shoot missiles, and the missiles fly all over the place like a frickin' wasp hive, and then all explode, some of them hitting the target, some of them not, right?

312
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,680
Speaker 0: That's called an Itano Circus, right?

313
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,450
Speaker 0: Named after the person who animated that.

314
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:33,790
Speaker 0: This person just calls it Anime Homing Missiles, but they know who Ichiro Itano is because they have a link right here with his name on the caption of the image.

315
00:26:34,530 --> 00:27:00,190
Speaker 0: And what they developed is a very small, with a very small amount of computer programming, all their code is here, they're showing you the math of if you were to develop a video game and you wanted to have missiles like that in your game that are rendered in real time, they have figured all that out for you in advance, and they have a cute little obvious Macross-ish demo game, you know, low poly count situation here.

316
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:05,910
Speaker 1: Shoot the Dippin' Dots on the beige thing with missiles.

317
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:08,052
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:14,830
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, there's the math of how to make that animation and how to make that work in a video game in a really nice way.

319
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:21,970
Speaker 0: If you're out there making, you know, a little video game and you want to include this effect, here's how to do it.

320
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:31,710
Speaker 0: And without having to, you know, do it the way Itano did it, where he animated each frame by hand, drawing on cells, you can just have a computer draw it for you.

321
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,352
Speaker 1: Good stuff.

322
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:36,005
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book was Leaf the Unseen.

323
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:37,230
Speaker 1: We read it, the episode is out.

324
00:27:37,471 --> 00:27:45,090
Speaker 1: The upcoming current Geek Nights Book Club book, which I have purchased, but I have not started reading yet, is Simon Rushdie's The Satanic Verses.

325
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:51,204
Speaker 1: Deeply relevant to pretty much everything that's been going on in the world for the past...ever.

326
00:27:51,264 --> 00:27:51,304
Speaker 1: So...

327
00:27:53,552 --> 00:27:54,290
Speaker 0: Several decades?

328
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,331
Speaker 1: At least.

329
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,098
Speaker 1: It was either this or Foucault's Pendulum.

330
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,163
Speaker 1: I gave those two choices.

331
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:01,606
Speaker 1: Scott chose The Satanic Verses.

332
00:28:02,068 --> 00:28:03,050
Speaker 1: I would have been happy with either.

333
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,042
Speaker 0: I still don't know how to pronounce...you say Foucault?

334
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,310
Speaker 1: I don't know how to pronounce that properly.

335
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,350
Speaker 1: It's Foucault.

336
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,122
Speaker 0: Are you sure it's Foucault?

337
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:09,870
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

338
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:11,886
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure.

339
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,570
Speaker 0: What percent sure are you that it's Foucault?

340
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,118
Speaker 1: I am 100% sure.

341
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:17,114
Speaker 0: Okay.

342
00:28:17,134 --> 00:28:18,790
Speaker 0: You could be right because I have no idea.

343
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:20,385
Speaker 1: C'est français!

344
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:43,290
Speaker 1: Also, Geek Nights will be live on Thursday, March 23rd at 2.30 PM Eastern Time in the Bumblebee Theater at PAX East with a panel that is brand new to anyone who didn't go to one magfest and go to one room at one particular time where we did an early trial version of this panel and never did it again anywhere and never uploaded it to YouTube.

345
00:28:45,411 --> 00:28:46,836
Speaker 1: Partly because we didn't record it fully.

346
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:50,730
Speaker 1: I just recorded the slides and the audio just to workshop.

347
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:59,370
Speaker 0: Well, since we don't have a bunch of friends going to PAX East, I'm going to bring all kinds of video equipment there and we'll probably spend most of our time doing that instead of playing board games.

348
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,583
Speaker 1: We'll be there Thursday and Friday and not Saturday and Sunday.

349
00:29:03,644 --> 00:29:04,506
Speaker 1: We're not enforcing.

350
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:05,590
Speaker 1: We're just going to be there doing this panel.

351
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:13,410
Speaker 0: Well, the listener in the chat has informed me that on the magfest channel, the magfest YouTube channel, you might be able to find it.

352
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:18,084
Speaker 1: Oh, I will find that later and post a link to it.

353
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:18,626
Speaker 1: That's nice.

354
00:29:20,751 --> 00:29:25,477
Speaker 0: In a last meta moment, I have made significant progress on the Geek Nights website.

355
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:35,310
Speaker 0: We are now in the process of linking the few remaining episodes to the forum threads that go with those episodes.

356
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:44,950
Speaker 0: If I was not able to do it automatically and if those episodes actually still have forum threads because a lot of the old ones just don't have a forum thread to go with them.

357
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:54,730
Speaker 0: So once we fill out those numbers in the spreadsheet, then the data transferring ETL part will be basically complete.

358
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:04,370
Speaker 0: And then we can move on to just getting basically some remaining features just so that we have feature parity with the current website.

359
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,542
Speaker 0: And then we just got to get the front end polished up and finished.

360
00:30:08,622 --> 00:30:10,970
Speaker 0: I don't know if the person I was working with will come back or not.

361
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,574
Speaker 0: We might have to get some help from someone else.

362
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:15,075
Speaker 0: We don't know.

363
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:23,730
Speaker 0: And then we can launch the new website and then we can work on adding new features that don't exist on the current website to the new website.

364
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,630
Speaker 0: Possibly just evolving it as a continuing process.

365
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, things like transcripts because Adobe Podcast might help us with that.

366
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,210
Speaker 1: There's going to be a lot coming out.

367
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:37,190
Speaker 0: Well, the existing website does have an unused transcript feature.

368
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:38,999
Speaker 1: It was used for a brief time.

369
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,150
Speaker 1: I paid for a few transcripts at one point.

370
00:30:44,013 --> 00:30:48,650
Speaker 0: I should also mention that if you already follow us on Twitter, you've probably seen this.

371
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:57,950
Speaker 0: But because of the changes at the tweet company, we are no longer and never will again automatically pose, at least unless there are big changes.

372
00:30:59,272 --> 00:31:03,210
Speaker 0: There could always be some sort of delicious revival of Twitter where it fails and then someone buys it.

373
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,880
Speaker 1: I did not delete my Twitter account.

374
00:31:05,222 --> 00:31:06,369
Speaker 1: I just went private with it.

375
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:07,332
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

376
00:31:08,654 --> 00:31:17,090
Speaker 0: But the point is, for the foreseeable future, we will no longer automatically be tweeting links to new episodes when they come out.

377
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,010
Speaker 0: And I'm not going to do that manually either because that's a fucking pain in the ass.

378
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:25,883
Speaker 0: So if you want to find out when there are new Geek Nights episodes, you must find another avenue.

379
00:31:26,244 --> 00:31:28,550
Speaker 0: RSS, I would suggest, is the best one.

380
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,210
Speaker 1: Maybe someday we'll like post to a mess.

381
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,289
Speaker 0: We'll always be the best one.

382
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:33,889
Speaker 1: Or something like posting a bunch of places.

383
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:41,550
Speaker 0: When we get to the phase of adding new features to it, there will be many features like that, definitely, that is on the board.

384
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:42,251
Speaker 1: Yup.

385
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:42,753
Speaker 1: Who knows?

386
00:31:42,793 --> 00:31:46,430
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll run a Mastodon instance for the Geek Nights listener to use.

387
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,310
Speaker 1: But that's on me and I'm going to say it right now, the odds of that...

388
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,350
Speaker 0: That's on you personally.

389
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:57,350
Speaker 1: The odds of that, one, it would be on me personally and two, the odds of that, while not zero, are not super high.

390
00:31:58,313 --> 00:32:00,229
Speaker 1: I am running my own Mastodon instance for me.

391
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:07,990
Speaker 1: It works, but I do not envision caring enough to administer it for anyone other than me.

392
00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:11,430
Speaker 0: I have plans of running something else.

393
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,490
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's talk about the gaming furniture that is not gaming chairs.

394
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:15,710
Speaker 1: Yup.

395
00:32:15,831 --> 00:32:20,630
Speaker 1: So way back, and I got a lot to say about this topic because there's a lot of different kinds of gaming furnitures.

396
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,949
Speaker 1: Some of which you all, the listener, might not be thinking about.

397
00:32:23,451 --> 00:32:31,630
Speaker 1: But I remember we went to the first PAX that we'd ever been to in '08 and we saw, was it at that PAX or the next one?

398
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:33,148
Speaker 1: One of those two PAXes.

399
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,945
Speaker 0: It was either '08 or '09, I don't remember which one.

400
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:36,710
Speaker 0: It was one of the two.

401
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,510
Speaker 1: Back then, they let special guests, which we were, they gave us a perk that they just kind of got rid of like about eight years ago.

402
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:54,130
Speaker 1: And that perk was, they would let us into the expo hall on one of the days of PAX an hour before the sweaty masses were let in so we could just walk around and talk to everyone and see everything.

403
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,109
Speaker 0: And we availed ourselves of that.

404
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:08,110
Speaker 0: Nowadays, the only people who get into the expo hall early for the past many years, right, like decade plus since they changed that policy, are obviously exhibitors who need to go in there.

405
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:08,710
Speaker 0: Yup.

406
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:12,970
Speaker 0: The enforcers who actually work in there and need to be in there.

407
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,908
Speaker 1: Yup, and only while they need to be in there.

408
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:17,452
Speaker 0: Exactly.

409
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:23,886
Speaker 0: The all-access people, because they have all access, the building staff, and the media get in.

410
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,710
Speaker 0: The people with real media badges get a very brief window, right, I believe.

411
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:38,669
Speaker 1: Which, I guess if we wanted to, we could get in addition to our regular, like they've offered that before, we weren't really doing a lot of coverage, so I didn't get it.

412
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:50,090
Speaker 0: We could talk about the much controversy of media people getting special privileges after that time period has closed, but that's up to individual booths and that's not a PAX policy.

413
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:58,030
Speaker 1: So we're walking around in there, and we saw something that, at least at the time, that we had never seen before in our lives.

414
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:08,330
Speaker 1: Late 2000s, Rem and Scott brains immediately coveted, just because it felt like it would solve a lot of problems in our lives, and it just felt like a really cool thing.

415
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:25,750
Speaker 1: They were dedicated gaming tables that were designed for the exact kind of nerd like us who wants to play a war game, or play a board game that takes a week, or play D&D with all the features that you might think would be cool to facilitate that.

416
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:33,949
Speaker 1: But also, you can put the top back on it, and it's a regular-ass dining room table for the rest of your life when you're not playing games.

417
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:40,679
Speaker 0: Yep, the main features of the gaming table would be the cup holders so you don't spill on your game, right?

418
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,262
Speaker 0: Dice pits built in.

419
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:48,170
Speaker 0: Little hidden, shielded areas so you can hide hidden information for games that require it.

420
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,469
Speaker 1: A giant pit that you can just put a whole game in?

421
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,989
Speaker 0: Yep.

422
00:34:54,074 --> 00:35:04,710
Speaker 0: Yep, some sort of surface that you can either whiteboard on, or cover with a piece of plastic, and then whiteboard on that, or a felt surface, like a casino table, or, right?

423
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:12,330
Speaker 0: And then in a pit, so that you can play the game, pause it, put the table on, the leaves on top, you know, eat dinner, take 'em off and play again.

424
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:25,048
Speaker 0: You know, all these sorts of things that, on paper, and if you're a nerd and you see those things, you're just like, "Aw yeah, that's the greatest thing I've ever seen, I want that, I need that, why did we just have a boring table?

425
00:35:25,088 --> 00:35:26,029
Speaker 0: that's just a flat piece of

426
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:26,350
Speaker 0: wood?".

427
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:38,230
Speaker 1: Yep, especially when we still lived, like, in a house, not in a city apartment, and we lived together, and we just had imaginings of, "Hey, our D&D games would be so much easier to run if we had

428
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,410
Speaker 1: this.".

429
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,029
Speaker 1: Or, "We would play Ogre, or BattleTech, at all, 'cause it wouldn't ruin the table for a

430
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:44,229
Speaker 1: week.".

431
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:47,129
Speaker 1: And of course we never got one.

432
00:35:47,310 --> 00:36:02,450
Speaker 0: Now, it is possible that, yeah, I mean, it is possible that there is someone out there who, for whom the gaming table is not merely aspirational, and when I talk about aspirational, I don't mean obtaining the table as aspirational, plenty of people have these tables.

433
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:08,099
Speaker 0: It's using the table as it was, you know, imagined, right?

434
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,930
Speaker 0: Who out there as a gaming table and is actually has a constant war game going on inside of it, right?

435
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:24,210
Speaker 0: I imagine, you know, I don't have numbers on this, but I'm guessing a very small percentage of people who have gaming tables actually have a game hidden in there going on, right?

436
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,273
Speaker 0: At any amount of the time, right?

437
00:36:26,533 --> 00:36:31,240
Speaker 0: Who actually is, like, how much is the cup holder really improving?

438
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:37,950
Speaker 0: your experience, you know, and you're, you know, versus just having a normal, you know, how much is the hidden thing?

439
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,323
Speaker 1: Especially if 90% of people who buy these tables are just playing D&D anyway, what have you got to hide?

440
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:42,770
Speaker 1: A character sheet!

441
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:54,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, how many people are actually, you know, hiding the GM stuff in a special area and it's that much better and cooler than if they just had a GM screen?

442
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,079
Speaker 1: Or what most game masters I know have these days, just a laptop that they're sitting in front of.

443
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,142
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

444
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:08,435
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the added expense of the gaming table, right, is it really worth it?

445
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:09,938
Speaker 0: I, in my opinion, no.

446
00:37:11,301 --> 00:37:21,034
Speaker 1: I would say the concept would be worth it if you live that lifestyle and you're not lying about living that lifestyle.

447
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:22,757
Speaker 1: You are actually living that lifestyle.

448
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:25,040
Speaker 1: Like, you set up a war game.

449
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,527
Speaker 0: I think it's also very good for a gaming store to have, right?

450
00:37:32,547 --> 00:37:41,460
Speaker 0: If you have a gaming store, many people will be playing D&D and what other games on the table daily, nightly, several times a day, right?

451
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:47,810
Speaker 0: And that, you know, can make your store a place more appealing for people to come play rather than at home.

452
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,014
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of value in that.

453
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:53,139
Speaker 0: If I had a gaming store, I would have all gaming tables, right?

454
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:54,020
Speaker 0: All over the place.

455
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,066
Speaker 0: Just, you know, I would probably get custom special ones to fit my store perfectly.

456
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:02,875
Speaker 0: But for a person at home, unless you're wealthy or whatever, it's like, really?

457
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:05,218
Speaker 0: Or playing that many games for real?

458
00:38:05,799 --> 00:38:06,100
Speaker 1: I don't know.

459
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:14,957
Speaker 1: Of course, the problem is, and I'm going to studiously avoid saying the name of any specific company because there's a bunch of them and I don't want to get into that.

460
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:16,420
Speaker 1: There's even some news about one of them.

461
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:21,980
Speaker 0: For some reason, gaming table companies are rife with drama and we don't want to mention any of them.

462
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,542
Speaker 1: I think I know why.

463
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:38,240
Speaker 1: The market for these, for people who actually will buy them, is pretty small and that market is heavily segmented into people who have extremely specific wants, needs and desires.

464
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,544
Speaker 1: There is no way to have a sustainable industry of mass producing these.

465
00:38:42,884 --> 00:39:00,520
Speaker 1: So they tend to be built either low rent and ad hoc and on demand, or they tend to be low build quality, or they tend to be as expensive as actual, for real, fancy furniture like the $10,000 table you get at the fancy furniture store.

466
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:06,827
Speaker 1: So that really makes it hard to have companies that are healthy and sustainable in this space.

467
00:39:07,107 --> 00:39:16,176
Speaker 1: A lot of them relied on crowdfunding, a lot of them came up after these were a thing, and then people weren't happy with them, and then a bunch of them collapsed.

468
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:19,500
Speaker 1: There's been a big repeating boom and bust cycle of crowdfunding.

469
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:23,780
Speaker 0: A lot of companies have had slow deliveries because they can't churn them out that quickly.

470
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:32,280
Speaker 1: Or they deliver tables that suck and then they go out of business and you've got a bunch of nerds who have tables that break and can't be repaired because they were made with substandard products.

471
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:37,237
Speaker 0: Also, in my opinion, a lot of the tables are aesthetically...

472
00:39:37,881 --> 00:39:40,760
Speaker 1: Ugly as shit or not put together very well.

473
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,385
Speaker 0: I have seen some good and nice ones that are quality built, but it's rare.

474
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:56,355
Speaker 0: A lot of them are just, you're better off just spending your money on a, go to a furniture store or a woodworker, a furniture maker, and spend that money on a normal table.

475
00:39:56,715 --> 00:40:01,580
Speaker 0: that's just a big flat piece of wood, but is an amazing, big piece of wood.

476
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:09,880
Speaker 0: A really nice, normal table, and I think that will be a better experience than a fancy gaming table.

477
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,262
Speaker 1: There's a dichotomy.

478
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:20,040
Speaker 1: Half the people who imagine buying these things, imagine they have a place where they can only, they only have enough space to have one table, so they want a table that can do both things.

479
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,613
Speaker 1: Same reason people get a pool table.

480
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,780
Speaker 1: that's also a ping pong table.

481
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,780
Speaker 0: But a normal, you can play a game on a normal table just fine.

482
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:32,239
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're imagining that they will keep a game going.

483
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,399
Speaker 0: A normal table does both things.

484
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they'll keep a game going under that little thing.

485
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,397
Speaker 0: You probably won't.

486
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:45,060
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that, you know, if you were to spend the gaming table money on a normal table, if you have, you know, we're assuming you have enough space, right?

487
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,963
Speaker 0: You can probably get a bigger table.

488
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:47,524
Speaker 0: And you know what?

489
00:40:47,544 --> 00:40:55,960
Speaker 0: The problem I have when playing games is often not that the table doesn't have a pit built in, but that the table isn't big enough for the giant game of Eclipse.

490
00:40:56,882 --> 00:41:02,694
Speaker 0: So I would rather have a bigger, nicer normal table than, assuming I had the space for it, than a fancier, smaller gaming table.

491
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:12,560
Speaker 1: Remember the MagFest where we set up an auxiliary table that had all the science stuff and like all the auxiliary boards from that game of Eclipse that we were playing?

492
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,020
Speaker 1: We had two separate tables that we were walking around.

493
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:25,460
Speaker 1: But the other demographic, people who are making, who have enough space to make a dedicated gaming room, and I bring this up because it's a segue into other kinds of gaming furniture.

494
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:32,980
Speaker 1: A dedicated gaming room, you probably don't need a table like this either because it's the gaming room.

495
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,738
Speaker 1: The wargame, if it gets set up and stays up, can just stay set up.

496
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:45,540
Speaker 1: You're probably better off buying, if you want a pit, just buy like a giant casino pit from a company that sells that to casinos.

497
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,740
Speaker 1: That'll be way higher quality.

498
00:41:50,482 --> 00:41:53,340
Speaker 0: Just get an actual crap stable and just play your game.

499
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,480
Speaker 1: And just play board games on it.

500
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,880
Speaker 1: That would actually, that would be pretty cool.

501
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,914
Speaker 0: Throw your dice in there.

502
00:41:57,975 --> 00:41:58,159
Speaker 0: Bam!

503
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:05,380
Speaker 0: Also hire a dealer with a crop who can grab the dice for you and pull it back over.

504
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:14,120
Speaker 1: I want to cover, I want to talk about together, kinds of gaming furniture and furniture adjacent things that really only make sense in a dedicated gaming room.

505
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:18,260
Speaker 1: Like the whiteboard on the wall, just for gaming.

506
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,040
Speaker 1: The pull-down screen for projecting your stuff.

507
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,738
Speaker 1: The TV mounted on the wall that's dedicated to gaming.

508
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:31,100
Speaker 0: There is a lot of office, there is a lot of office stuff that is good for gaming as well, right?

509
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,040
Speaker 0: You know, a projector on the ceiling aimed straight down onto the table surface.

510
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:44,320
Speaker 1: Mount a table, mount just a big flat table on the ceiling like a ship's table and have a winch and a button that'll lower it down when you're playing a game.

511
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:57,180
Speaker 1: Like if you're making a custom gaming space, my advice to you is you'll probably be better served by customizing that space among things you can buy at normal stores rather than buying gamer focused specific shit.

512
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,380
Speaker 1: Like buying things aimed at an office.

513
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,360
Speaker 0: Just having a tiny, just a tiny crappy display up somewhere.

514
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,078
Speaker 0: It's like that's a scoreboard, that's a timer everyone can see, right?

515
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,460
Speaker 0: That's a place to look at for the tournament bracket.

516
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:20,420
Speaker 0: It's like that's a really, you know, that can really enhance a gaming day a lot more than, you know, a table that's different.

517
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:28,200
Speaker 1: Like, you know, like a Rumpus room that has the dartboard and the pool table and it has like the chalkboard kind of thing that's generically designed to be the scoreboard?

518
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,360
Speaker 1: Just make something like that but bigger?

519
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:35,560
Speaker 1: Holy crap, will that change your life more than a like $8,000 poorly built gaming table?

520
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:45,540
Speaker 1: The seating furniture is interesting because for tabletop games, they just have to be the right height and be comfortable.

521
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:49,553
Speaker 1: Like don't buy, never buy a chair that's aimed at gamers.

522
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:51,780
Speaker 1: They're almost always a ripoff just across the board.

523
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:55,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why we're not talking about chairs in this episode.

524
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,660
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're going for the long game sessions, right, you might want to opt for more comfier chairs.

525
00:44:01,841 --> 00:44:07,100
Speaker 0: But if it's a shorter one, it's like, you know, you got folding chairs at a convention and like they're not a problem.

526
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:17,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, or if they are a problem, I have my premium butt pad that I have brought to PAX before and I've sat on in tabletop on the folding chair and it was great.

527
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,300
Speaker 0: Right, but I'm saying it's like, you know, no one's ever been like, oh man, I can't play games all day.

528
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:31,340
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe someone has, but it's like the chair is not, you know, you go to a convention, it's like they got folding chairs and folding tables and it's no problem, right?

529
00:44:31,661 --> 00:44:39,320
Speaker 0: What's more important is that like, you know, if you got a table, right, and let's say it's not a gaming table, a tablecloth.

530
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,315
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

531
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,007
Speaker 0: Way cheaper, way cheaper than a table, right?

532
00:44:44,327 --> 00:44:50,380
Speaker 0: And it enhances, right, you get a nice, you know, some kind of velvety one or a felt one or something, right?

533
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,260
Speaker 0: It's like that, a tablecloth helps a lot.

534
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,400
Speaker 0: Do not underestimate.

535
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,159
Speaker 0: Especially, you know, things not sliding around.

536
00:44:57,825 --> 00:44:59,540
Speaker 1: And like it even helps see the board better.

537
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,239
Speaker 1: It makes the lighting feel better.

538
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:09,520
Speaker 1: They're cheap and this sounds like old person advice, but like even if you're at like a PAX or something, bring your own tablecloth with you.

539
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:16,260
Speaker 1: They're not big and it'll make it easier for your friends to find you and it'll feel so much better to play.

540
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:19,220
Speaker 0: Now there is a kind of chair.

541
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,940
Speaker 0: Black is the best color for the tablecloth.

542
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:21,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.

543
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:32,620
Speaker 1: If you're talking about video games, like you got a video game room, video game stuff, we're not talking about gamer chairs, but there is sort of a class of chair that actually is really good for gaming.

544
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,640
Speaker 1: Back in the day, we wanted these, but they were hard to get.

545
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,119
Speaker 1: They sold them at Walmart only.

546
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:38,839
Speaker 1: They called them a video rocker.

547
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,460
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of clones that came out later.

548
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:46,460
Speaker 1: They were aimed at little kids and they're basically like this little tiny rocking chair with no legs that would just sit on the floor.

549
00:45:47,181 --> 00:45:55,140
Speaker 1: And they were like weirdly perfect to play console games in a small room on the floor comfortably with your friends while they're like sitting on the couch.

550
00:45:56,202 --> 00:45:58,076
Speaker 1: And like, they're great.

551
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:05,060
Speaker 1: Like the floor pillows, things like that can really expand how many people you can get sitting around playing a game.

552
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,639
Speaker 1: Don't underestimate that kind of stuff.

553
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,682
Speaker 0: I think, right.

554
00:46:09,264 --> 00:46:16,560
Speaker 0: Well, I think that those things mattered more for, you know, when you have more friends, like most people can only afford like a couch, right?

555
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,640
Speaker 0: Or maybe an L-shaped one, right?

556
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:27,320
Speaker 0: But it's not going to, unless you're like in a big old mega McMansion at least with a giant room, you're not going to have enough couch seating for if you have enough people over, right?

557
00:46:27,761 --> 00:46:41,520
Speaker 0: So the floor pillows, the video rockers, those can give you additional seating that's more comfortable than just the floor at a low price point that you can then hide away when there isn't a big party of people coming over.

558
00:46:42,141 --> 00:46:48,180
Speaker 0: It can also help you if you don't have a bunch of money and you don't have a couch at all, right?

559
00:46:48,321 --> 00:46:50,359
Speaker 0: And you just want to not sit on your floor.

560
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:50,816
Speaker 1: Yeah.

561
00:46:51,604 --> 00:46:52,659
Speaker 0: That's also a good option.

562
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:05,020
Speaker 0: But I think the video rockers biggest utility was actually in the older days, like, you know, 10, 20 years ago when controllers were still wired and TVs were still smaller.

563
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,652
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'd often have closer to.

564
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:09,160
Speaker 0: Right.

565
00:47:09,641 --> 00:47:13,300
Speaker 0: You wouldn't want to put your couch that close unless you had a really small living room.

566
00:47:13,721 --> 00:47:19,420
Speaker 0: And so therefore you would get a different seating arrangement that you could use when you get close.

567
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,780
Speaker 1: When I was playing the Game of Q back in that day, I would sit on the video rocker right in front of the TV.

568
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:24,811
Speaker 1: I wouldn't sit on the couch.

569
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:25,479
Speaker 1: that was further back.

570
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,739
Speaker 1: Our friend who was just watching would sit on the couch.

571
00:47:29,586 --> 00:47:29,840
Speaker 0: Exactly.

572
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:36,040
Speaker 0: Nowadays, all the controllers are wireless and all the TVs are giant LCDs, even the cheaper ones.

573
00:47:36,501 --> 00:47:40,800
Speaker 0: It's like you can sit on your couch and you don't need some different furniture to get closer.

574
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:41,598
Speaker 0: It really is.

575
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,180
Speaker 0: But it still has that good purpose of when a whole bunch of people come over.

576
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:49,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially because when they're on the floor, one, they're small, like easier to hide away.

577
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,620
Speaker 1: But two, on the floor gives you sort of stadium seating.

578
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,860
Speaker 1: More people can see the screen and interact with stuff.

579
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:59,040
Speaker 1: Like you got 12 people trying to play Jackbox together in a living room.

580
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:03,939
Speaker 1: That's going to save your butt, those video rockers and literally save your butt and those floor pillows.

581
00:48:06,026 --> 00:48:06,660
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly.

582
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:07,920
Speaker 0: All right.

583
00:48:08,261 --> 00:48:12,340
Speaker 0: I think something else I want to talk about is, you know, your coffee table, right?

584
00:48:13,082 --> 00:48:15,274
Speaker 0: It's like, what, you just got a normal old coffee table.

585
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:16,220
Speaker 0: What's the big deal, right?

586
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,800
Speaker 0: The coffee table I have, right, is half coffee table, half footrest.

587
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:27,660
Speaker 0: It's like the right side of it is a cushion instead of a table because you don't need that much table space on the coffee table.

588
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,860
Speaker 0: It's like you're not doing, you know, you're just putting a drink on it or whatever, maybe.

589
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,900
Speaker 0: It's like you don't, doesn't need, so it's like you're going to put your feet on it more often than not.

590
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,080
Speaker 0: Why not have a squishy part instead of just putting your feet up on the wood?

591
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:40,380
Speaker 0: Then you don't need an ottoman.

592
00:48:41,002 --> 00:48:47,080
Speaker 0: But the thing is that if you, the way mine's constructed is this actually storage inside.

593
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:52,160
Speaker 0: If you lift up the cushion, there's a whole compartment in there and there's another compartment on the left.

594
00:48:52,642 --> 00:48:56,120
Speaker 0: And it's like, I store all the controllers and all the weird stuff.

595
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:02,980
Speaker 0: Like I got a Wii steering wheel and I got a fight stick and I got any S controller.

596
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,200
Speaker 0: I got all kinds of controllers and all sorts of video game accessories, all hidden inside the coffee table.

597
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,574
Speaker 0: Where you can't see them unless you need them.

598
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,399
Speaker 0: And then there they are.

599
00:49:12,141 --> 00:49:16,640
Speaker 1: Now, you could similarly put this stuff in the entertainment center that you probably have your TV on.

600
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,398
Speaker 0: But then you got to get your ass up to go get it.

601
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:25,340
Speaker 1: But also increasingly as it's cheaper and easier to mount thinner and lighter fancy TVs on walls.

602
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,189
Speaker 1: A lot of people issue the entertainment center.

603
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,860
Speaker 1: Like you don't necessarily need that taken up space anymore.

604
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,400
Speaker 1: The coffee table is where you store all the stuff that used to be on your entertainment center.

605
00:49:35,882 --> 00:49:41,100
Speaker 1: And whatever you're plugging into that TV, hide that somewhere else with cables in your wall.

606
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,417
Speaker 1: Like it's not that hard to do.

607
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,220
Speaker 0: Yup, I mean I've got, you know, I still have, it's not really an entertainment center so much.

608
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,957
Speaker 0: It's just a long sort of end table with like a compartment.

609
00:49:52,977 --> 00:49:53,680
Speaker 0: I don't know what you would call it.

610
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,100
Speaker 1: I mean I guess it's serving the function of an entertainment center.

611
00:49:57,601 --> 00:50:01,380
Speaker 0: Right, but it's not one of those ones you think of where it's got like big tall shit on the sides.

612
00:50:01,703 --> 00:50:03,760
Speaker 0: It's just a flat one level deal.

613
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,760
Speaker 0: And you know like the HDPC is on it, the switch is on it, right.

614
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,098
Speaker 0: And that, you know, there's a Lego Voltron on it.

615
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:17,580
Speaker 0: And then inside of it is just like storage for stuff that is not frequently accessed.

616
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:25,060
Speaker 0: Like old, you know, GameCube games and DVDs and tiny board games and whatever, right.

617
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,700
Speaker 0: It's like the controllers are in the coffee table so you don't have to get up to get the controller, right.

618
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,920
Speaker 0: It's like you sit down at the couch and you can do everything.

619
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:38,200
Speaker 0: If I put that stuff in the entertainment center I'd be walking back and forth all the time, right.

620
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,057
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

621
00:50:41,823 --> 00:50:43,540
Speaker 1: And that's probably, I don't think we want to talk about shelving.

622
00:50:43,601 --> 00:50:44,580
Speaker 0: Is there any other gaming?

623
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,559
Speaker 1: Shelving is sort of like an adjacent topic I think.

624
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:50,101
Speaker 0: I guess.

625
00:50:50,141 --> 00:50:56,000
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, people talk all about how you got to get the Cal-X to store your board games, right.

626
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,539
Speaker 0: But it's like I just have a normal Billy bookshelf.

627
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:04,420
Speaker 1: Mine are just on two shelves in the closet and I made a very simple rule.

628
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,418
Speaker 1: I will not own more board games than fit in that closet at any point.

629
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,519
Speaker 1: If a game, so now it's totally full.

630
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,080
Speaker 1: Most of my shelves have books.

631
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:14,818
Speaker 1: A game's going away.

632
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:21,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of my shelves have books, but I got one set of shelves that have some games.

633
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:23,820
Speaker 0: But part of that bookshelf isn't games.

634
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,140
Speaker 0: It's only like maybe three of the shelves on the bookcase are games.

635
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:34,960
Speaker 0: And it's like, yeah, unless it's a tiny game, in which case it can go in that entertainment center thingy and inside hidden away.

636
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,520
Speaker 0: If it's a big game, there's no room for any more big games.

637
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:41,259
Speaker 0: So if I get a new big game, one of the ones that's on there has to go.

638
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:41,843
Speaker 0: Right.

639
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:42,212
Speaker 0: There's no...

640
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:51,020
Speaker 1: Now one thing I do do is in that kind of place, I'll often leave like more accessible either two player games, because you know, me and Emily live together.

641
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:54,120
Speaker 1: So two player game, we might just play out of nowhere, like randomly.

642
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:57,476
Speaker 1: Or we even see it and think, oh, yeah, you want to play Seven Wonders Duel?

643
00:51:57,516 --> 00:51:58,159
Speaker 0: Alright, let's do it.

644
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:09,420
Speaker 1: But two, you can almost, if you're the kind of person like us and you have friends over a lot, especially as hopefully we're in the long decreasing tail of COVID and things slowly start to get better in that regard.

645
00:52:09,582 --> 00:52:10,598
Speaker 1: We see people more often.

646
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:22,960
Speaker 1: You can almost leave out one or two games in that like coffee table storage to be quickly accessible, or almost like a coffee table book where someone might be like, hey, I see that ozzel sitting there.

647
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,904
Speaker 1: You want to just play it?

648
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,360
Speaker 1: Like the coffee table game being visible?

649
00:52:28,001 --> 00:52:32,660
Speaker 1: As long as it's just one or two games, don't put a pile out there because they don't run into the same problem.

650
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:42,900
Speaker 1: That is a way to attract attention and get people to maybe want to play the game you want them to play, instead of having the argument of let's stand in front of the shelf of every game and everyone vetoes everything.

651
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:46,078
Speaker 1: And then everybody goes home after three hours without having played any game.

652
00:52:50,183 --> 00:52:54,080
Speaker 1: And I think any other furniture we might push off to another show.

653
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:58,820
Speaker 1: I almost think we could do a show around how to store your fucking board games like unboxing.

654
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:00,900
Speaker 1: Like I'm actually not unboxing games anymore.

655
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,420
Speaker 0: I mean, there's already 10 billion videos about that.

656
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,740
Speaker 0: I feel like an audio podcast doesn't really add much to that.

657
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,058
Speaker 1: That would just be my opinion already and ill-advised advice.

658
00:53:13,046 --> 00:53:13,600
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

659
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:21,220
Speaker 0: And also, I think you would get that advice might be better coming from someone who does have a shit ton of games and doesn't constantly get rid of them.

660
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,779
Speaker 1: Well, because my advice would be don't have that many games.

661
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:26,980
Speaker 0: If you have that many games, you should have a game storage room.

662
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:28,637
Speaker 1: Yup.

663
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:34,620
Speaker 0: Do you really need- In general, I think, you know, the- Do you really need what?

664
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:41,120
Speaker 1: Oh no, I've noticed using this new Discord there is more delay on your audio coming to me than with the other Discord.

665
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:43,759
Speaker 1: Because the bandwidth is lower, I think that's playing a factor here.

666
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:45,540
Speaker 1: Because we're interrupting each other a lot more.

667
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,591
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe because we didn't boost it.

668
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:57,920
Speaker 1: I'd already had a conversation with the listener in the YouTube channel which has more viewers now than the stage as people have moved over there because the audio quality is better.

669
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,360
Speaker 0: Oh, interesting.

670
00:54:00,882 --> 00:54:00,995
Speaker 1: Yeah.

671
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:09,200
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the advantage of the Discord stage is that one day, maybe, we'd let someone else talk.

672
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:15,620
Speaker 1: I might just take some Patreon money and buy enough boosts to fully maximize whatever we need to maximize on the Geeknight server.

673
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:17,520
Speaker 1: That feels like a good use of Patreon money.

674
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:18,759
Speaker 0: I think it only needs one level of boost.

675
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think I threw one boost there, but all my boosts that I have are going at our own private server.

676
00:54:27,245 --> 00:54:28,300
Speaker 1: Because I use that one a lot.

677
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:36,060
Speaker 0: But anyway, I think the final word on the gaming furniture is that really the best gaming furniture is really good normal furniture.

678
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,140
Speaker 0: The specialized gaming furniture is rarely a good idea.

679
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:41,060
Speaker 0: A couch from a good company.

680
00:54:41,223 --> 00:54:42,340
Speaker 0: Even for gamers.

681
00:54:42,961 --> 00:54:59,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, a couch that is well designed and a table that is well designed from actual furniture companies 90% of the time are just going to be better for the same number of dollars you spend than any gaming specific thing across the board in every domain.

682
00:54:59,281 --> 00:55:01,400
Speaker 1: Anything marketed to gamers is usually a ripoff.

683
00:55:01,683 --> 00:55:02,498
Speaker 1: Unless it's a game.

684
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,379
Speaker 1: And even then, most games are ripoffs, but that's a separate conversation.

685
00:55:08,382 --> 00:55:14,640
Speaker 0: So I would avoid the gaming stuff unless you have the specialized use case, like I said, gaming stuff.

686
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,440
Speaker 0: But yeah.

687
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:22,520

00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,098
Speaker 1: You'll feel like a fighter jet made of biceps!

711
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,720
Speaker 1: What about me and my blue collar?

712
00:56:59,409 --> 00:56:59,920
