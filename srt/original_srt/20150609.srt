1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,047
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 9th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:10,409
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,143 --> 00:00:14,200
Speaker 0: I am the Scott.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,926
Speaker 1: And this is The Geek Knights.

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:20,241
Speaker 1: Tonight we're talking about The Time Crisis 5.

6
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:20,546
Speaker 0: Mm-mm-mm.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,659
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,193
Speaker 1: You best watch yourselves, 'cause I have a new toy.

9
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,560
Speaker 1: I have a teleprompter.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:33,882
Speaker 1: - Okay.

11
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:35,359
Speaker 1: - And I'm gonna make use of it.

12
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:36,759
Speaker 0: Alright, you do that.

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,520
Speaker 1: I remember way back when I made that Five Nights at Freddy's, like, why this game is scary, like, video essay.

14
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:50,060
Speaker 1: It was a real pain in the ass to make that thing, because it's not like a lecture where Scott and I just talk, you know, to an audience, and then the video is just of that event.

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,900
Speaker 1: This is more like, I need, there's a bunch of things I need to say, and then I need to interleave that together with a whole bunch of video of, like, gameplay and things.

16
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,719
Speaker 1: So I needed, like, all these art assets together, and then I can make the thing.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:12,220
Speaker 1: Which meant I had to write a script, or else I'd have to have a video thing set up and wear the same shirt, or have the same shirt and lighting and everything available, like, every day for weeks.

18
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:19,440
Speaker 1: So I had to, like, write this stupid script, and set this giant thing up, and then sit there for, like, an hour, saying all my things.

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,920
Speaker 1: If I'd had a teleprompter, that would have been a lot faster.

20
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:29,220
Speaker 1: I am not good at memorizing paragraphs of text, and then saying them into a camera.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,128
Speaker 0: So, just ad lib it.

22
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:32,840
Speaker 0: What do you need to read the exact text for?

23
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:43,020
Speaker 1: I didn't even really read the exact text so much, but I had to make sure I said all the things, and the more I had to, like, go back and look at, you know, what points do I have to make, and did I say them all?

24
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,180
Speaker 1: Because if I miss a point, and I stop doing the video, I'm fucked, and I gotta go back and do this video over again.

25
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,360
Speaker 0: Just say all the things one at a time and edit the video.

26
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,188
Speaker 1: No, it took me weeks to edit that video.

27
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,380
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna leave the video shit set up to video myself for weeks.

28
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:00,620
Speaker 1: Ideally, you have all the video done.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,140
Speaker 0: The other part is all the parts in the video, see, what you do is you say each thing one at a time, right?

30
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:11,180
Speaker 0: And obviously, if you just cut those things together, right back to back, it's gonna look funny when you obviously cut.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,409
Speaker 1: Oh no, I did that, believe me.

32
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,538
Speaker 1: Every time I cut...

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,340
Speaker 0: You switch between you, voiceover, you, voiceover, you, voiceover, you, voiceover.

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,583
Speaker 1: Yup.

35
00:02:16,948 --> 00:02:18,240
Speaker 0: Every time I cut... That's the secret.

36
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,959
Speaker 1: But I did need video in my face.

37
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,340
Speaker 0: Now that you know that trick, and you watch people's videos on YouTube, you won't be able to unsee that trick.

38
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:25,821
Speaker 1: Yup.

39
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:38,499
Speaker 1: However, the funniest thing is, I've seen some cut points on our panels where, like, I change camera angle or something, but we just look like we did a cut, because, like, you move your head really funny suddenly, when really we didn't, so...

40
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:42,440
Speaker 0: You're supposed to edit those parts out to make them voiceover, so it doesn't look like that.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,402
Speaker 1: Yeah.

42
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:51,700
Speaker 1: But no, the teleprompter will be useful generally for, like, more complicated projects that we want to do, so stay tuned for more complicated projects.

43
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,240
Speaker 0: It's good for when you've written something for someone else to say, and they just read it.

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,199
Speaker 0: Their only job is to appear on screen.

45
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,050
Speaker 1: It's also good when you're doing...

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,430
Speaker 0: "Hey, I'm hiring you to be in this commercial for me, pretty person.

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,537
Speaker 0: You know, you are beautiful on the camera.

48
00:03:06,597 --> 00:03:06,778
Speaker 0: Read

49
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:07,039
Speaker 0: this.".

50
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:17,919
Speaker 1: It's also good for, like, if we were doing... Like, we have to do a Patreon video, so if we're making, like, a video that is just us saying our very specific thing with a very specific time limit, and we want it to be all one take.

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,360
Speaker 0: It's also good for mass production of video, like, make a thank you video for these hundred people.

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,265
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

53
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,795
Speaker 0: Just cue up the teleprompter.

54
00:03:24,836 --> 00:03:25,399
Speaker 0: stand there.

55
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:25,650
Speaker 0: Yup.

56
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,140
Speaker 0: Read, read, read, read, read.

57
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:36,620
Speaker 1: Now, what I don't have yet, but I could do it now, because I have the physical teleprompter, is the dynamic thing where I could have someone else feeding me stuff from off-screen.

58
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,346
Speaker 1: So, I'm gonna play around.

59
00:03:38,366 --> 00:03:40,100
Speaker 1: I'm gonna use this thing to the maximum extent.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,420
Speaker 0: It's best if you could see, like, comments on there.

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,041
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:49,138
Speaker 1: Like, what I want to do is have... Ideally, I might make an app, because now all I have to do is display, you know, stuff in an app.

63
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:49,700
Speaker 1: It'll just work.

64
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:59,518
Speaker 1: So, I could display, like, the comments from a Twitch stream while I'm videoing my face, while I'm playing the game much easier than putting an overlay on the game.

65
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,569
Speaker 0: You don't need an app for that.

66
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:01,380
Speaker 0: You can use the Twitch app to do that.

67
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

68
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:03,720
Speaker 1: No, because the Twitch app isn't reversed.

69
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,960
Speaker 0: It has... Oh, but it has chat-only mode.

70
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,795
Speaker 1: Yes, but it's not reversed.

71
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,260
Speaker 0: It's a teleprompter.

72
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,160
Speaker 0: Well, I can read in reverse, so not a problem.

73
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,780
Speaker 1: You... I defy you to read non-reversed text.

74
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,212
Speaker 0: Let me just turn my iPad upside down.

75
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:16,535
Speaker 0: Oh, wait.

76
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:17,160
Speaker 0: It corrected itself.

77
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:27,105
Speaker 1: So, in other, like, actual stuff I've been doing, game-wise, I bought a Wacom tablet, and I've been playing a lot of Civ 5.

78
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:30,160
Speaker 0: You're using the Civ 5... Your Wacom tablet for Civ 5?

79
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, that works real nice.

80
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:32,580
Speaker 0: Does it really?

81
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does.

82
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:34,080
Speaker 1: Okay.

83
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,283
Speaker 1: Way nice.

84
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:38,500
Speaker 1: At least, way better than the Lenovo touchpad.

85
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:39,444
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

86
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:40,189
Speaker 0: That is... Good God.

87
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:40,611
Speaker 0: Good God.

88
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:53,958
Speaker 1: So, if any of you are interested in a big Civ 5 game, I've done all the research, and I've almost done testing all the shit, and I'm trying to start a, like, for-real, semi-long-form, pit-boss Civ 5 game.

89
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:54,798
Speaker 0: It's all you.

90
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,767
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

91
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:57,059
Speaker 1: I think it'll be fun.

92
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,880
Speaker 1: You got any video game news?

93
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:09,580
Speaker 0: So, this is big news, at least it seemed big, based on the clamor I saw on the internet, that people are so excited that Capcom announced Mega Man Legacy Collection.

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:18,060
Speaker 0: So, what's happening is basically this new company that sort of is marketing themselves is we want to be the criterion collection for video games.

95
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:32,139
Speaker 0: We're gonna re-release all the old video games, you know, remastered, HD, Perfect Edition, with all sorts of added features, like, they're including, you know, a museum with all the old artwork, and high-res, and...

96
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:32,818
Speaker 1: Noble goal.

97
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,780
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, this isn't a bad thing at all, right?

98
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:46,620
Speaker 0: But I'm like, okay, first of all, they're making it HD, but it doesn't, like, they're not redrawing it, they're just directly scaling it to HD.

99
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,278
Speaker 0: It's like, well, my emulator does that.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only thing... And they're acting like, oh, it's a big re-release.

101
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:02,301
Speaker 0: It's like, dudes, I already have Mega Man Collection and Mega Man X Collection for the GameCube, and it has Mega Men 1 through 8, not Mega Men 1 through 6.

102
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:13,153
Speaker 1: Also, the other thing is, the only thing that would make this worthwhile, for real, would be if it was guaranteed to be NES accurate, because the problem with emulators is that they're not 100% accurate.

103
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,220
Speaker 1: Like, the game's a little different.

104
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,139
Speaker 0: Don't need it to be so.

105
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:20,780
Speaker 0: The differences are so small that if you care about that difference, you can go fuck yourself.

106
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:23,680
Speaker 1: It depends on the game, at least from a museum standpoint.

107
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,197
Speaker 1: Like, if you're looking at preservation...

108
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,540
Speaker 0: But, I mean, we have plenty of Mega Man cartridges.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,840
Speaker 0: There is no shortage of any Mega Man game on its original format.

110
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, but without that, I already have all these games on emulator.

111
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 0: Right, but it's weird that people are so excited about this.

112
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,140
Speaker 0: It's like, you don't know about emulators.

113
00:06:39,263 --> 00:06:42,400
Speaker 0: You don't... I mean, these games are even in Virtual Console, you can get them.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:50,720
Speaker 0: It's like, why was this made into the big deal, news-wise, marketing-wise, when really, it's like, uh...

115
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:51,618
Speaker 1: So, you say that...

116
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,057
Speaker 0: Every Mega Man person fucking can already be in these games 100 times.

117
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,280
Speaker 1: Almost no one I know who knows about things said anything about this.

118
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,920
Speaker 1: This... All I saw was other people's retweets of the press release stuff.

119
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Speaker 0: This filled my feeds for, like, half a day.

120
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:09,700
Speaker 0: What kind of feed do you have?

121
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,239
Speaker 0: Apparently Mega Man related.

122
00:07:12,442 --> 00:07:14,920
Speaker 1: You've got the internet figured out that Mega Man's a jam?

123
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:15,859
Speaker 0: I guess maybe.

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,680
Speaker 1: Here, leaderboards, challenges, replays.

125
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,000
Speaker 1: If that's global and works well, that's actually pretty good.

126
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:26,400
Speaker 0: I mean, it's nice, but it's like, is it really enough to spend 15 bucks on games that you already have beaten?

127
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:27,800
Speaker 1: It depends.

128
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,160
Speaker 0: And played, and can already play anytime you want?

129
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:40,058
Speaker 1: You know, someone made a point on Twitter today that people like us, pretty much every genre of video games came into existence while we were alive and gaming from nothing.

130
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,579
Speaker 0: Well, before, at the original video games, when video games started, there were no genres.

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,240
Speaker 0: Every game was its own genre.

132
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,339
Speaker 0: What genre is Dig Dug?

133
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:49,893
Speaker 0: What genre is...

134
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 1: A Digger, because Dig Dug 2.

135
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,760
Speaker 0: What genre is Mule?

136
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,080
Speaker 1: Mule is a resource allocation and bidding game.

137
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,600
Speaker 1: I would classify Mule the same way I classify board game.

138
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,057
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, what genre is...

139
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:01,860
Speaker 1: Pac-Man?

140
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,420
Speaker 1: Hubert.

141
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:03,497
Speaker 1: Hubert?

142
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:05,579
Speaker 1: Not actually a good game.

143
00:08:05,843 --> 00:08:07,875
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's... I'm just saying what genre is it?

144
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,619
Speaker 0: You know, games didn't have...

145
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:11,359
Speaker 1: Tile puzzler.

146
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,040
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, games didn't necessarily have genres.

147
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,060
Speaker 1: Real-time tile puzzler.

148
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, games didn't have genres.

149
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,099
Speaker 0: It was later on that genres came into existence, like NES days.

150
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:34,179
Speaker 1: But I'm saying, if you are young now, never played on a NES, like a kid who's growing up right now, not talking yet, when they're a little older, this is probably the best way for them to play all those old MegaMans.

151
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,979
Speaker 1: The question will be, will they ever want to?

152
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,299
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I just watched, you know, those YouTube channels that are like, old people react, babies react.

153
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,919
Speaker 1: Oh, kids react to NES games?

154
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:44,659
Speaker 1: I can summarize every one of them.

155
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,939
Speaker 1: This game's bullshit and hard, fuck it.

156
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,839
Speaker 0: Well, they just did Teens React Contra and they had them co-op.

157
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:51,219
Speaker 1: Oh, I watched that.

158
00:08:51,700 --> 00:09:00,577
Speaker 0: And they were... It's like, you know, on one hand, I always feel bad, like, man, young kids are so much better at video games than me with their reflexes and their whatnots.

159
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,300
Speaker 0: It's like, wow, they are garbage at Contra.

160
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:07,020
Speaker 0: Now, to be fair, it was bullshit that they didn't give them the instruction manual first.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,719
Speaker 1: I was like, I looked at that instruction manual.

162
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,660
Speaker 0: They spent a good amount of time, like, how do I drop down?

163
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
Speaker 0: How do I do this?

164
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,360
Speaker 0: It's like, you're supposed to read the fucking manual.

165
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,491
Speaker 1: You know, it's Contra.

166
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:21,080
Speaker 1: If you sit there when the game starts and mash the buttons, you literally figure out the entire game.

167
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,380
Speaker 0: They did eventually figure things out.

168
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,420
Speaker 0: But for example, they didn't know that you could shoot the mechanical turrets.

169
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,499
Speaker 0: They just tried to dodge them.

170
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:28,160
Speaker 0: They didn't know the water is safe.

171
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,840
Speaker 0: They didn't know the water ended at one point.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,114
Speaker 0: They didn't know, like, they didn't know all these things that you could figure out.

173
00:09:34,276 --> 00:09:37,060
Speaker 0: if you have, some of them you could figure out if you had the instruction manual.

174
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,820
Speaker 1: But you can also figure them out by playing a little.

175
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,818
Speaker 1: I've noticed that, you know what?

176
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:48,139
Speaker 1: That might be the same reason why even a lot of young people and just general people also suck at computers and everything else.

177
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,620
Speaker 0: They don't read manuals?

178
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,499
Speaker 1: No, fuck that.

179
00:09:50,741 --> 00:09:52,760
Speaker 1: They don't even try to do anything.

180
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,759
Speaker 1: Like, they don't attempt things.

181
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,620
Speaker 1: They don't say, huh, I wonder what that is.

182
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,160
Speaker 1: Like, when I was a kid and I got a new game and there was a pit, jump in it just to see what happened.

183
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,879
Speaker 1: Like, I would just try stuff.

184
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:07,600
Speaker 1: I didn't need the Mega Man, Mega Man, Mega Man.

185
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,600
Speaker 0: Some of the kids tried stuff and some of them didn't.

186
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,360
Speaker 0: But they were all so garbage at Contra.

187
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,540
Speaker 0: It's like, man, I can't beat Contra without Konami Code or whatever.

188
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,080
Speaker 1: Here's the question, Scott.

189
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,820
Speaker 0: I can get way farther than those kids.

190
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,520
Speaker 0: None of them got past level one.

191
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:26,080
Speaker 1: Without Konami Code, are you confident right now that if we both played Contra, you would get past level one?

192
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, 100% confidence.

193
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,519
Speaker 1: Would you bet money on it?

194
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:31,360
Speaker 0: I would bet a moderate amount of money.

195
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,814
Speaker 1: You want to do a live challenge of.

196
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 1: we each play Contra, one chance, no Konami Code.

197
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,020
Speaker 1: Whoever gets further wins with a pot.

198
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:39,910
Speaker 0: Further?

199
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:40,418
Speaker 0: No.

200
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,980
Speaker 0: I'm not betting on further than someone else.

201
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,178
Speaker 1: No, just me.

202
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
Speaker 0: I'm betting that I can beat level one.

203
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,640
Speaker 1: You're afraid that you're not as good as me.

204
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:52,839
Speaker 0: I can only do something that is guaranteed, which is that I can beat level one and possibly even level two.

205
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,658
Speaker 1: I'm dubious that you would beat one.

206
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,520
Speaker 1: There's no way you'd beat level two right now.

207
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,579
Speaker 1: When's the last time you played Contra?

208
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,159
Speaker 0: The upstrolling one?

209
00:10:58,627 --> 00:10:59,360
Speaker 1: Oh man, I know how to do that.

210
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,159
Speaker 1: When was the last time you beat Contra?

211
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:02,678
Speaker 0: A while ago.

212
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:12,839
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's got leaderboards, which is cool, but at the same time, I don't know enough people who will care about the leaderboards enough.

213
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,040
Speaker 0: $15 for games you already have.

214
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,464
Speaker 1: $15 for games?

215
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,100
Speaker 1: It's not a lot of money.

216
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,430
Speaker 0: Anyway.

217
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:23,506
Speaker 1: It's got a database of enemy lists and stuff, so I guess it replaces the existing Wikia.

218
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:29,880
Speaker 0: The Mega Man Wiki is now crying.

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,420
Speaker 1: And they've got a museum of a whole bunch of pictures of things.

220
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,980
Speaker 0: I guess I can throw out my Mega Man 25th anniversary edition.

221
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,639
Speaker 1: I mean, there is a place for this.

222
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,939
Speaker 1: I don't take quite the div views Scott takes on it, but at the same time, I didn't see a big press blitz like you did, so.

223
00:11:48,242 --> 00:11:48,414
Speaker 0: Whatever.

224
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,100
Speaker 1: I did not run afoul of this.

225
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,760
Speaker 1: This is something that I knew was coming and I thought, oh, that's cool.

226
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,060
Speaker 1: I didn't think about it anymore.

227
00:11:54,241 --> 00:11:54,899
Speaker 0: It's not bad.

228
00:11:55,061 --> 00:11:58,318
Speaker 0: I thought there was a disproportionate response for what it was.

229
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,659
Speaker 0: I saw all this Mega Man hype and I was like, oh, Mega Man hype, what's this?

230
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,589
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh, that's it?

231
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,319
Speaker 1: Look how balkanized the internet is.

232
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,100
Speaker 1: You and I are actually even in different ghettos of the internet.

233
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,416
Speaker 1: Apparently, you live in Mega Man town and I live in next door to Mega Man town.

234
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,100
Speaker 0: Bionic Commando town.

235
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, if there's Bionic Commando news, I'm all the fuck over that.

236
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,160
Speaker 0: It's okay.

237
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,716
Speaker 1: Even though Bionic Commando Rearm 2 is kind of garbagey.

238
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:22,700
Speaker 0: What is your news?

239
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:31,039
Speaker 1: So there is an article here that I don't think you even need to read, but the IGDA did a big satisfaction study and everything.

240
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,525
Speaker 1: And what they discovered is that developers in the video game industry, 50% of them earn less than 50K.

241
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,183
Speaker 0: Whoa.

242
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:48,280
Speaker 0: Like you think that video games is like What games are they developing that they're making so little money?

243
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,939
Speaker 0: If you have like your developer, specifically, you know how to program and write code?

244
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,540
Speaker 1: You can make 80K in New York and finance overnight.

245
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,279
Speaker 0: Are the people that we're talking about here?

246
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:57,633
Speaker 0: Yeah.

247
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,740
Speaker 0: We're not talking about like artists.

248
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,815
Speaker 1: We're talking about developers.

249
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:00,940
Speaker 0: Or testers.

250
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:02,738
Speaker 0: Developers.

251
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:06,533
Speaker 0: So somebody who knows how to code is working on a video game and only making 50K.

252
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:10,839
Speaker 0: If you know how to code, it doesn't matter what kind of code you know how.

253
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:16,280
Speaker 0: If you can actually code, you can make way more than 50K in any major city in the country.

254
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,680
Speaker 1: So anyway, there's a whole bunch of links here that are really fascinating.

255
00:13:21,243 --> 00:13:28,840
Speaker 1: But the biggest takeaway seems to be that developers are leaving the industry at a higher rate.

256
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaker 0: So they don't need the advice that we just gave them.

257
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,580
Speaker 0: They already figured it out.

258
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,759
Speaker 1: The churn rate in video games, which we all assumed was high, is way higher than we even assumed.

259
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,559
Speaker 0: How much did you assume?

260
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,660
Speaker 0: Because I assumed a lot.

261
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,960
Speaker 1: Well, at the same time, I know people who are highly stressed and way underpaid who continue to work in the video game industry.

262
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:49,280
Speaker 0: I do know such people.

263
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:49,778
Speaker 1: Yes.

264
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:55,800
Speaker 1: But the biggest takeaway is that the thing that is driving people out isn't even the money.

265
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,359
Speaker 1: It's the stress and the long hours and all the corporate bullshit.

266
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:01,940
Speaker 0: Stop doing that bullshit.

267
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:07,259
Speaker 1: So yeah, my continued dream of make a video game company that makes cool games.

268
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:15,479
Speaker 1: And if you make more money than you expect, instead of doing profits, just use that to make your lives better and don't try to be like a AAA profitable.

269
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:19,159
Speaker 0: If you're going to work in video games, only work for Valve, because you know what?

270
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,960
Speaker 0: Valve just releases games and they're done.

271
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Speaker 0: They don't push to get them out in a certain time or any bullshit.

272
00:14:23,401 --> 00:14:28,019
Speaker 1: I do know for a fact that some of the people who work for Blizzard, at least, are really happy and have good jobs.

273
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:35,299
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure that someone at every company, no matter, you know, you think of the most evil company you can think of, the most, you know, someone at Time Warner fucking loves their job.

274
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,397
Speaker 0: Someone that, you know.

275
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,155
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

276
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:38,019
Speaker 1: You know what?

277
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:41,039
Speaker 1: In Nazi Germany, the SS, they fucking love their jobs.

278
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,659
Speaker 1: The regular German army, not so much.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,417
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

280
00:14:44,902 --> 00:14:55,620
Speaker 1: I'm just, I'm trying to believe, yesterday I was reading this paper talking about, it was like this weird World War II thing about how the German army recognized pretty early, the Third Reich did.

281
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:07,580
Speaker 1: They recognized pretty early on that the average soldier, if they encountered the death camp stuff, could not deal with it and started going insane and suicides like crazy stuff.

282
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:21,459
Speaker 1: So they found that the SS people were way more into it and it's just an interesting study about how they tried to mitigate the damage that being literally the worst humans in history did to the people who were actually doing the work.

283
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:31,500
Speaker 1: So I'm glad all this discussion about stress in the video game industry went straight to Nazis, but this developer satisfaction survey is amazing.

284
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:49,420
Speaker 1: And seriously, if you work in video games and you work in video games because you're passionate about games and your job is stressful bullshit of working 80 hours a week for a company that doesn't care, either quit or find people who are like you, and just form your own game studio.

285
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,940
Speaker 1: I guarantee you'll do way better.

286
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:51,860
Speaker 0: Make a union.

287
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,217
Speaker 0: They can't stop you.

288
00:15:54,001 --> 00:15:54,236
Speaker 1: Laws.

289
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,680
Speaker 1: Except because of the high churn rate, they can.

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,718
Speaker 1: They'll just fire you.

291
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,108
Speaker 0: Good.

292
00:15:59,506 --> 00:16:02,499
Speaker 0: The other option was quit, so at least try to make a union first.

293
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,960
Speaker 0: Worst case, you get fired, which is even better than quitting because then you get unemployment.

294
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:18,939
Speaker 1: But seriously, the only truly happy video game people I know are people who work for cool people, not just want to make money people, and full stop, that's pretty much it.

295
00:16:19,704 --> 00:16:21,559
Speaker 1: Everyone else is the exception, the unicorn.

296
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,079
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

297
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,420
Speaker 1: So this is a fascinating article.

298
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,420
Speaker 1: Apparently satyrs or satyrs, depending on where you live.

299
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,620
Speaker 0: You mean a man with goat legs?

300
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,539
Speaker 1: Man with goat legs.

301
00:16:40,322 --> 00:16:44,439
Speaker 1: And I guess, I don't know if what cultures have a female equivalent.

302
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:45,620
Speaker 0: I've never seen one.

303
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,639
Speaker 0: The Witcher has that.

304
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,879
Speaker 0: Maybe Fantasia, but that's more like... Those are satyrs, kind of.

305
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,318
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

306
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,558
Speaker 1: But yeah, the Witcher too.

307
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:54,080
Speaker 1: There's that one girl.

308
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about Witcher.

309
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:55,680
Speaker 0: Really?

310
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,160
Speaker 0: I just know it's a Polish video game.

311
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,295
Speaker 1: There is a... Anyway, you know the Mr.

312
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:03,039
Speaker 1: Mashant's wife, the sexy Lamia?

313
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:03,699
Speaker 0: Yeah.

314
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,619
Speaker 1: There's an equivalent satyr woman, witch person in a Witcher game.

315
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,558
Speaker 0: When did you play Witcher?

316
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:10,299
Speaker 1: I just know about video games.

317
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,859
Speaker 0: You just know about Witcher?

318
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:12,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,319
Speaker 0: How witchy are you?

320
00:17:13,481 --> 00:17:14,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was Dave and Joel.

321
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,319
Speaker 1: That's how I know this.

322
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:15,858
Speaker 0: There you go.

323
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:17,420
Speaker 1: My brain was stretching back.

324
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:18,959
Speaker 0: That's the game they would play that you wouldn't play.

325
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:21,540
Speaker 1: I was stretching back in my brain like, "Wait, are you dreaming?

326
00:17:21,661 --> 00:17:22,419
Speaker 1: "How do you know this?

327
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,179
Speaker 1: "Is this real?

328
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:23,854
Speaker 1: "Do you have

329
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,020
Speaker 1: Witcher?"?

330
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,575
Speaker 1: "How did you get

331
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:24,780
Speaker 1: here?".

332
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:30,059
Speaker 1: But apparently satyrs, or satyrs, won't eat soup.

333
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:36,740
Speaker 1: And this is a theme in woodcuts, in carvings, in paintings.

334
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,679
Speaker 0: From ancient times.

335
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:38,881
Speaker 1: 1600s.

336
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:46,335
Speaker 1: So all these old images of satyrs, you'll see them sitting at a table and a peasant's eating soup like, "Check this shit

337
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:46,459
Speaker 1: out.".

338
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,389
Speaker 1: And satyrs are like, "Oh, fuck

339
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,613
Speaker 1: no.".

340
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, that satyr's too good for soup.

341
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,380
Speaker 1: Or the peasant reveals some soup and the satyr just faints.

342
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,127
Speaker 0: If someone's an artist, a good enough artist, to make art like that, you should draw a satyr in Japan being like, "Fuck no

343
00:17:59,167 --> 00:17:59,514
Speaker 0: ramen.".

344
00:17:59,847 --> 00:17:59,940
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,790
Speaker 0: But also he's like, "Hell

346
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:03,956
Speaker 0: no.".

347
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,658
Speaker 0: And they're eating pho.

348
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,460
Speaker 1: It's interesting seeing this painting from 1730.

349
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,883
Speaker 1: And then there's another painting from 1680 and 1615.

350
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:17,759
Speaker 1: And they all show the satyr leaving by the fact that the stool he's sitting on is being knocked over.

351
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:19,239
Speaker 0: Why are the satyrs always so buff?

352
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,719
Speaker 1: They historically are buff.

353
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,839
Speaker 1: They're supposed to be super hot.

354
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,360
Speaker 0: I guess that's from not eating soup.

355
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,299
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll stop eating soup.

356
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,140
Speaker 0: But wait, chicken soup too good.

357
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:35,780
Speaker 1: So this article explains why satyrs are so fucked up by soup.

358
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,279
Speaker 0: How did this person research this?

359
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,700
Speaker 0: What library had this information?

360
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:41,739
Speaker 1: Here, I'll read it.

361
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,759
Speaker 1: So satyrs, or hybrid beings who are part human and part goat, are famed for their love of wine and body behavior.

362
00:18:52,760 --> 00:19:04,499
Speaker 1: Marcantonio Riamondi's Bacchanal in 1510, derived from ancient sarcophagus bass relief and displaying a lot of drunken followers of Dionysus, is characteristic of the type of activity associated with satyrs.

363
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:13,739
Speaker 1: However, as the number of printed examples reveal, a bowl of soup placed before a satyr elicits some surprisingly sober conduct.

364
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,060
Speaker 1: So I'm not going to spoil it.

365
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,460
Speaker 1: Fucking go read this article.

366
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:19,820
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

367
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,839
Speaker 1: And the answer is actually pretty simple and pretty funny.

368
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,930
Speaker 0: So this guy on YouTube, he's got a YouTube account with over 140,000 subscribers.

369
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,439
Speaker 0: His name is Styro Pyro.

370
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:29,920
Speaker 1: That's a good name already.

371
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,299
Speaker 0: His latest video has almost three and a half million views.

372
00:19:33,822 --> 00:19:36,800
Speaker 0: It is my homemade 40 watt laser shotgun.

373
00:19:37,226 --> 00:19:37,519
Speaker 1: Wait,

374
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:38,488
Speaker 1: 40? 40

375
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:38,898
Speaker 1: watts.

376
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,375
Speaker 0: Like a light bulb 40 watts.

377
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,939
Speaker 1: I've witnessed a five watt laser before and that shit was not cool.

378
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,739
Speaker 0: Imagine all the photons coming out of a 40 watt light bulb, which is bright enough that when you look at it, it hurts.

379
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,259
Speaker 0: But instead of being spread all over the goddamn room, they're all aimed at one spot like bam.

380
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:00,620
Speaker 1: So I actually have seen this video.

381
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,279
Speaker 1: The best part about it is that when he turns it on, his camera goes, Oh, fuck no.

382
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:10,299
Speaker 1: And really has a hard time recovering from how bright it is.

383
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,340
Speaker 0: And he, you know, he shoots a bunch of balloons and set stuff on fire and whatever.

384
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,240
Speaker 0: he does exactly what you should do.

385
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,199
Speaker 0: The way it works is he's got a whole bunch of lasers and he shoots them all at a lens that focuses them at one point.

386
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:29,680
Speaker 0: This guy has also in the past made a six watt laser sword and many other projects that will get a lot of YouTube views.

387
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,120
Speaker 1: I look forward to seeing the video where this kid talks about why he lost his eye.

388
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:35,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's pretty much the I don't know.

389
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,180
Speaker 0: He's not that much of a kid.

390
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,260
Speaker 0: He seems younger than us, though.

391
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:42,420
Speaker 0: But yeah, this guy is the expert at making dangerous things that get a lot of views on YouTube.

392
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,779
Speaker 0: So give him your views.

393
00:20:45,341 --> 00:20:49,740
Speaker 1: So in the moment, the Book Club book is Scott's Choice and I disavow the selection.

394
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:57,740
Speaker 1: It is the Eye of Zawado, also known as the first book of the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan.

395
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,280
Speaker 1: Known so because it goes on and on and on and on until I start foaming at the mouth and falling over.

396
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:06,700
Speaker 0: I started reading book one.

397
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,960
Speaker 0: I'm about 100 pages in and it's a fantasy novel.

398
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,880
Speaker 1: I'm going to London next week and I plan to read most of it on the plane.

399
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,080
Speaker 0: It's a fantasy novel.

400
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,917
Speaker 0: If you're a nerd and you like fantasy novels, this is one of them.

401
00:21:18,783 --> 00:21:22,999
Speaker 1: So gut read better or worse than the Rothfussian offerings.

402
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:25,819
Speaker 1: You've only read the first Rothfuss.

403
00:21:28,144 --> 00:21:30,559
Speaker 0: I mean, I killer quality wise.

404
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:35,100
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, I guess ignoring the content, right?

405
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:44,559
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, the content is more generic, whereas the Rothfussian is more modernish despite having its issues of being, you know, Superman and whatnot.

406
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:53,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, this is a more of a classic plot, but I guess it's more well done in writing wise.

407
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:55,840
Speaker 1: Just curious what I'm getting into here.

408
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,299
Speaker 1: I'm still everyone I talk to.

409
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:09,660
Speaker 0: It's like perhaps Robert Jordan was a better writer than Rothfuss, but he wrote about something that is more, you know, the content is more typical and not surprising.

410
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,160
Speaker 0: It's just a fantasy adventure.

411
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:16,559
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of things are now ranging from, oh man, those books aren't that good too.

412
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,159
Speaker 1: Now you got to read like the seventh book.

413
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,380
Speaker 1: The early ones aren't that good.

414
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,778
Speaker 0: Mixed response all over.

415
00:22:21,026 --> 00:22:21,259
Speaker 0: Yeah.

416
00:22:21,581 --> 00:22:24,060
Speaker 0: And also the response of man, I don't like fantasy novels.

417
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,420
Speaker 0: It's like, why are you listening to geek nights?

418
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,720
Speaker 0: Are you a nerd or what?

419
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,639
Speaker 0: Cyberpunk only, maybe.

420
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,380
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean, it's real hard to not just really only two kinds of books that nerds read the sci fi's and the fantasy.

421
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,657
Speaker 0: They put them in the same section of the bookstore just for you.

422
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,077
Speaker 0: Reading only half of those seems kind of weird.

423
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,240
Speaker 1: You're real lucky.

424
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,280
Speaker 1: We don't just make the book club.

425
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,520
Speaker 1: Every prince of nothing chat.

426
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Speaker 0: And the thing is, they're usually fantasy and sci fi are also in the same section because they're usually the same thing.

427
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,920
Speaker 0: You just replace dragon with like computer virus and replace sword with laser sword.

428
00:22:52,322 --> 00:22:53,638
Speaker 1: And it's the same thing.

429
00:22:55,243 --> 00:23:00,939
Speaker 0: So otherwise we have no convention appearances until Connecticut, which is actually surprisingly soon.

430
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,480
Speaker 1: Connecticut is in about a month in July in Hartford, Connecticut at the Connecticut Convention Center.

431
00:23:07,104 --> 00:23:10,979
Speaker 1: It is not worth flying to, but it is definitely worth driving to.

432
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,158
Speaker 0: If you can get to it in a car, and you're a nerd, which you are if you're listening to this, you should go to it.

433
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,280
Speaker 0: Also, June 20th is the Philadelphia Netrunner Regional Championship.

434
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,679
Speaker 0: I'm going to live stream from there if their Internet doesn't suck.

435
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:28,680
Speaker 1: I may or may not tag along.

436
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,859
Speaker 0: You should come to make my life easier.

437
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could, but at the same time, I could do something else.

438
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,060
Speaker 0: You would be in this game store all day until the late night in Philadelphia.

439
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,759
Speaker 1: Unless it's a burning con.

440
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,180
Speaker 1: Pretty much any other like game store event.

441
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,940
Speaker 1: After about four hours, I want to be outside.

442
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,638
Speaker 0: You can stand outside the store.

443
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:52,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can walk around Philadelphia.

444
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:53,620
Speaker 0: You can play Netrunner.

445
00:23:55,062 --> 00:24:01,576
Speaker 0: You can entertain the people with all the who are going to be many viewers, probably hundreds.

446
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,980
Speaker 1: So we were in Wildwood, New Jersey last weekend.

447
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:14,299
Speaker 1: We've talked about it at length on the show many times in the past, but one thing that happened over the years is we pretty much started going at the peak of arcades.

448
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,858
Speaker 0: And then every year it was only the peak DDR.

449
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,119
Speaker 0: It wasn't the peak of arcades.

450
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,697
Speaker 0: The peak of arcades was Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat 2 era.

451
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:22,396
Speaker 1: Okay.

452
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,840
Speaker 0: In the United States, at least.

453
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,599
Speaker 1: The peak of arcades at the shore.

454
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,899
Speaker 0: The peak of arcades DDR wise.

455
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,057
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also the shore had its...

456
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,822
Speaker 0: Police 911.

457
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:33,498
Speaker 1: Hokuto no Ken.

458
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,579
Speaker 0: I'm just saying there was a time at the shore where they had Street Fighter 2, Mortal Kombat 2 at NBA Jam.

459
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,400
Speaker 1: No, but that was a different time, you understand.

460
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,939
Speaker 0: And just the peak of arcades at the shore with DDR was when we went.

461
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:53,160
Speaker 1: So over the years it declined and declined and declined until one year, last year, there was literally not a single arcade machine worth touching on the entire boardwalk.

462
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,000
Speaker 0: Unless you really want to play a rigged crane.

463
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,400
Speaker 1: But now there's a retro pinball museum that you can play awesome old mechanical pinball machines.

464
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a handful of good arcade machines on that boardwalk.

465
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:06,460
Speaker 1: With one exception, they're all in one arcade.

466
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:14,800
Speaker 1: So while we were walking around looking for something to do, we bumped into Time Crisis 5, which just came out.

467
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,572
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like, whoa, I didn't even know.

468
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,899
Speaker 0: this just came out because I mean, how would you even know?

469
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,700
Speaker 1: Well, because when was the last Time Crisis game?

470
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,621
Speaker 0: Right, it was actually in 2006.

471
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,097
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I looked to make sure.

472
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,820
Speaker 0: Time Crisis 4 was in 2006.

473
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,120
Speaker 1: On July 4th, 2006.

474
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,980
Speaker 0: In other words, when there were less than one year of Geek Nights episodes recorded.

475
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:44,020
Speaker 1: We did a show called Arcade Games colon Dance Dance Revolution House of the Dead 4 Time Crisis 4.

476
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,260
Speaker 0: This is Time Crisis 5.

477
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,880
Speaker 0: It came out nine years after Time Crisis 4.

478
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,760
Speaker 0: There've been nine years without an arcade Time Crisis game.

479
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,037
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, our things of the day back then were a guy lighting 45,000 bottle rockets at the same time.

480
00:25:57,561 --> 00:25:58,238
Speaker 0: I remember that one.

481
00:25:58,722 --> 00:26:00,620
Speaker 1: And the dog wielding a Roman candle.

482
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,419
Speaker 0: I remember that one.

483
00:26:01,702 --> 00:26:04,140
Speaker 1: And something about WG ad doesn't matter.

484
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,880
Speaker 1: The page is gone.

485
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

486
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,400
Speaker 0: OK, so Time Crisis is a really interesting game, right?

487
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,360
Speaker 0: Because I mean, gun games are some of the oldest arcade games, even in like pre-video game.

488
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:18,880
Speaker 0: A lot of arcade machines were shooting gallery.

489
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:25,000
Speaker 1: It was like a big wooden like bolt action rifle on a stick shooting mechanical targets.

490
00:26:25,261 --> 00:26:30,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they used various very clever methods of figuring out if your aim was accurate or not.

491
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:35,179
Speaker 0: And those methods worked or did not work to various degrees.

492
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:49,399
Speaker 0: But, you know, arcade, the gun games have always been a staple of the arcade, because even though you had the Zapper at home with your NES, it only worked so well and a mechanism to make it work better was not something you could have in your house.

493
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,977
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, lethal enforcers work pretty well on the SNES.

494
00:26:53,026 --> 00:26:53,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

495
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,220
Speaker 0: What did you use, a super scope?

496
00:26:54,561 --> 00:26:55,498
Speaker 1: Oh, it came with guns.

497
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,380
Speaker 0: Oh, it came with guns?

498
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,438
Speaker 1: It came with plastic guns.

499
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,020
Speaker 1: That's all right.

500
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,199
Speaker 1: Like big revolver looking things.

501
00:26:59,823 --> 00:27:04,891
Speaker 0: But I mean, especially when CRTs died and we had the LCD screens, it was even harder to make gun games.

502
00:27:04,932 --> 00:27:06,020
Speaker 0: that, you know, for home.

503
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:13,800
Speaker 0: And, you know, buying guns that all in every game used a different method and the arcades just kept getting fancier at a rate.

504
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,992
Speaker 0: So even today, right?

505
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,159
Speaker 0: The arcade gun game is still vastly superior to anything you can have at your home, unless you buy an arcade machine.

506
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,017
Speaker 0: And really it started with sort of lethal enforcers, but it moved on to, you know, area 51 sort of reignited that.

507
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:37,100
Speaker 0: And time crisis really just sort of blew them all out of the water and became sort of the king of the arcade gun game.

508
00:27:37,301 --> 00:27:40,439
Speaker 0: And nothing is really tried to stand up to it since, other than more time crisis.

509
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,960
Speaker 1: Here, there was actually the, that gun was a standard gun.

510
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,519
Speaker 1: It was the Konami justifier.

511
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:45,213
Speaker 0: Whoa.

512
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:49,300
Speaker 1: And it worked with lethal enforcers, lethal enforcers too.

513
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,120
Speaker 1: Oh, on the, on other systems that worked with a bunch of shit, but on the SNES in 92, it literally only ever worked.

514
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:56,646
Speaker 1: There you go.

515
00:27:59,012 --> 00:27:59,200
Speaker 0: Anyway.

516
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,200
Speaker 0: So time crisis, the big revolution reason time crisis was such a big deal is because time tries has introduced the pedal, right?

517
00:28:06,461 --> 00:28:09,499
Speaker 0: Not only were you shooting at the screen, you're also stepping on this thing.

518
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,118
Speaker 0: Yep.

519
00:28:10,361 --> 00:28:15,340
Speaker 0: And when you stepped on it and you, you would basically pop up and be able to shoot guys.

520
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,620
Speaker 0: And when you let go, your guy would hide and also instantly reload the gun.

521
00:28:21,163 --> 00:28:23,780
Speaker 0: So it combined the reloading with the hiding, which makes sense.

522
00:28:23,821 --> 00:28:24,840
Speaker 0: Cause you hide and reload.

523
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,080
Speaker 0: You don't want to reload with your head sticking out, but also the height.

524
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:28,980
Speaker 1: That was just fine.

525
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,899
Speaker 1: And operation Wolf.

526
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:30,515
Speaker 0: Sure.

527
00:28:31,281 --> 00:28:38,120
Speaker 0: Uh, but it also, you know, the, the aspect of hiding also added this sort of extra element to the game of the dodging.

528
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:43,939
Speaker 0: You could see bullets or rockets coming at you and dodge them by ducking and then pop out and shoot the bad guy.

529
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:45,040
Speaker 0: Right.

530
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:47,280
Speaker 0: And all these games were just rail shooters, right?

531
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,340
Speaker 0: You don't control your movement.

532
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,039
Speaker 0: You basically just had to kill all the guys on the screen.

533
00:28:51,586 --> 00:28:52,120
Speaker 0: Get served.

534
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,613
Speaker 0: Don't die.

535
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:53,778
Speaker 0: Get to the next screen.

536
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:59,680
Speaker 0: Before that, all the gun games would be the more like a duck con or.

537
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:03,300
Speaker 1: Well, like legal enforcers, there was the child's pop out and you shoot him.

538
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:07,460
Speaker 1: And then there was like operation Wolf, like the machine gun, a bunch of shit.

539
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:07,880
Speaker 0: Yeah.

540
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,620
Speaker 0: Well that was Terminator two arcade, right?

541
00:29:09,861 --> 00:29:11,779
Speaker 0: We got a bunch of shit, but that wasn't actually a gun.

542
00:29:12,142 --> 00:29:14,919
Speaker 0: It was actually a joystick that looked like a gun, right?

543
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:20,900
Speaker 0: So you felt like you were aiming at the screen, but really they just mapped the position of the joystick to positions on the screen.

544
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:23,480
Speaker 0: The gun was attached to the top of the thing.

545
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,379
Speaker 0: You couldn't pick up the gun and aim anywhere you wanted.

546
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:25,957
Speaker 1: Now nicely.

547
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,580
Speaker 1: That didn't really matter in terms of playing.

548
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,040
Speaker 0: Also the time crisis guns added a few other things.

549
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,159
Speaker 1: The force feedback, which is gone now.

550
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:44,740
Speaker 1: Well, it's still force feedback, but they've removed the actual physical, you know, clicking of that was when I first picked up a time crisis gun and that big bolt at the top would move.

551
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:46,340
Speaker 1: That was the shit.

552
00:29:46,482 --> 00:29:47,719
Speaker 0: It was, it was kind of awesome.

553
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:50,231
Speaker 0: Uh, they, you know, it's not there now.

554
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:54,840
Speaker 0: and time crisis five, at least the machine we played, but that really set time crisis apart.

555
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:57,240
Speaker 0: It got you to put quarters in just to play with that.

556
00:29:57,381 --> 00:29:58,759
Speaker 0: Cause it was fun to play with that.

557
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,060
Speaker 0: Even if you sucked also the shooting in time crisis, the way it worked, I don't know.

558
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,477
Speaker 0: I still don't actually know specifically what method they're using to make the gun work.

559
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:10,100
Speaker 0: The gun is ridiculously accurate, or at least it feels ridiculously accurate.

560
00:30:10,562 --> 00:30:15,540
Speaker 0: Like you never have a situation where you shoot and the bullet goes off somewhere else, or it doesn't hit the screen or whatever.

561
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:19,520
Speaker 0: Like you can have that happen even in games like area 51 and whatnot.

562
00:30:19,581 --> 00:30:20,520
Speaker 0: That'll happen sometimes.

563
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:20,796
Speaker 1: Yup.

564
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:23,320
Speaker 1: So time crisis five in terms of plot.

565
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,118
Speaker 1: I have fuck.

566
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
Speaker 1: If I know I've never cared.

567
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,958
Speaker 1: I skip every cut scene.

568
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:29,149
Speaker 1: As far as I know, time crisis is.

569
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,439
Speaker 1: there's a couple of pretty guys and you shoot things and the enemies are in.

570
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:45,659
Speaker 0: There's always an insane boss who has a huge, huge army consisting of ridiculous mechanical deadly contraptions and lots and lots of really boring foot soldiers and henchmen.

571
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:47,579
Speaker 0: And they're drat.

572
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,300
Speaker 0: They're chasing you through a dangerous, dangerous world of industrial shit.

573
00:30:52,722 --> 00:30:58,299
Speaker 0: And that crazy boss guys just keeps taunting you until eventually you murder him and have an even crazier boss in the next level.

574
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:58,573
Speaker 1: Yup.

575
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,379
Speaker 1: So time versus five, the shit gets got going on.

576
00:31:01,844 --> 00:31:03,439
Speaker 1: Is that daddy two pedals?

577
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,640
Speaker 0: Daddy two.

578
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:14,739
Speaker 0: So it's like, what can they possibly do for time crisis five that didn't already do in games like crisis zone with the submachine gun or time crisis for they already added co-op and time crisis too.

579
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,299
Speaker 0: They like, they advanced so quickly.

580
00:31:16,422 --> 00:31:17,380
Speaker 0: They got ahead of themselves.

581
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,800
Speaker 0: It took them nine years to come up with a way to advance this game.

582
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:22,820
Speaker 0: And all they could do is two pedals.

583
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,767
Speaker 0: And it's like two pedals.

584
00:31:24,787 --> 00:31:28,959
Speaker 0: that really isn't that big a leap, but it's actually kind of awesome.

585
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,680
Speaker 1: Cause basically when you put your foot on a pedal, you stand up in that spot.

586
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:34,200
Speaker 1: If you let go, you're ducking.

587
00:31:34,581 --> 00:31:39,340
Speaker 1: Put your foot up on the other pedal, you run around and come up on the other side of some bitches.

588
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:46,300
Speaker 0: So basically there's for any screen that you're on, there's two places you can stand and you can safely move between the two positions.

589
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:48,020
Speaker 1: And as a result, it'd be dangerous.

590
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,700
Speaker 1: Cause if Scott moves to one spot and I moved to another spot, like off to the side, we could shoot each other.

591
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,939
Speaker 1: I can see him over there.

592
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,339
Speaker 0: Well, that happens in time crisis too.

593
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,778
Speaker 1: Also, but now it's active depending upon me.

594
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,959
Speaker 0: Now there's like decisions that you make.

595
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:14,156
Speaker 0: Like if you coordinate with the other person, you can perhaps avoid any risk of that by always positioning yourselves in a certain way, but it actually kind of makes the game easier because when you appear and start shooting, all the bad guys will turn towards you and start shooting at you as they do.

596
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:15,100
Speaker 0: Right.

597
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,618
Speaker 0: They're not dumb.

598
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:17,480
Speaker 0: You switch to the other position.

599
00:32:17,581 --> 00:32:19,300
Speaker 0: They're still aiming where they were originally.

600
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,299
Speaker 1: Usually occasionally when we got to this one smart guy.

601
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:22,680
Speaker 1: Yeah.

602
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,440
Speaker 1: I come around and there's a guy like in the back with a worst gun covering his friends.

603
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,900
Speaker 1: I can be like, Oh shit and duck immediately.

604
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:28,200
Speaker 0: Right.

605
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,999
Speaker 0: But you and you pop up in the other position, you pretty much all the bad guys are still gonna be facing.

606
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,679
Speaker 0: You're going to shoot them from their side and flank them.

607
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:35,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

608
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:43,056
Speaker 0: So you just keep switching back and forth and you're pretty much almost always flanking all the bad guys and hitting them without being hit very much at all.

609
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:49,840
Speaker 0: It really makes it kind of easy in a way, but it encourages you to keep switching between the two pedals pretty much constantly.

610
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:52,299
Speaker 0: But there's sometimes you don't want to switch.

611
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:54,460
Speaker 1: Of course, we only got to the first main boss.

612
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,440
Speaker 1: We don't know how easy it remains.

613
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Speaker 0: I wasn't going to put that many quarters in there, but they do a lot of other interesting stuff with the pedals.

614
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,920
Speaker 0: Like that first main boss is a rotating flame turret thing.

615
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:03,537
Speaker 0: All right.

616
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:12,520
Speaker 0: So not only do you want to rotate to get to the right side of it based on its position, but you need to use that rotation to sort of duck under the flame thing.

617
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,880
Speaker 0: And if you do it wrong, that flame could just hit you in the head.

618
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:24,538
Speaker 0: If you pop up, say on the right pedal, when it's coming at you, you got to be able to see it coming at you, duck on the right, move to the left to get under it, and then pop out again where it's safe.

619
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:33,200
Speaker 0: So they incorporated a lot of, you know, the bosses and other elements in the environment really integrate well with the two pedal system.

620
00:33:33,962 --> 00:33:36,720
Speaker 1: And it just felt like the slickest time crisis to date.

621
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:37,873
Speaker 1: Like it was just fun, good.

622
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,820
Speaker 1: Like it's a perfect example of a great arcade gun game.

623
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:49,219
Speaker 0: Another thing that makes time crisis really stand out from other arcade gun games, especially say House of the Dead is the big screen.

624
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:51,440
Speaker 0: You never see time crisis with a tiny screen.

625
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,140
Speaker 0: Even time crisis one had the big screen.

626
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:53,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

627
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,058
Speaker 1: And the screens on this one are huge.

628
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,720
Speaker 0: And you're sort of far away from that screen.

629
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,980
Speaker 0: So it actually, you know, there is a lot of aiming shooting going on with House of the Dead is like a little screen usually.

630
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:09,779
Speaker 0: And you're like next to it and up close and going like, yeah, even police 911 is a tiny little screen.

631
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:15,300
Speaker 0: It's like the gun games is one case where it's like, yeah, a bigger TV actually matters.

632
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,214
Speaker 0: A whole crap ton goes in this more area to shoot at.

633
00:34:19,655 --> 00:34:22,520
Speaker 0: that makes aiming like sort of matter with a tiny screen.

634
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,960
Speaker 0: It's like you're just moving the gun like a little tiny bit.

635
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,597
Speaker 0: And it's like, whatever, right?

636
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:30,418
Speaker 0: When you're moving the gun, like shoot a guy in the way left, shoot a guy in the way, right?

637
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,020
Speaker 0: That's like more the physical action starts to get into it.

638
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,059
Speaker 0: It's, you know, that's what makes a gun game good.

639
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,529
Speaker 1: Yeah.

640
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,239
Speaker 1: So the co-op and ever like playing together was really fun.

641
00:34:38,561 --> 00:34:42,820
Speaker 1: And we actually died like basically within a few seconds of each other.

642
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,239
Speaker 1: Like I died finally.

643
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:46,480
Speaker 1: And then the boss comes in and Scott died.

644
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:46,931
Speaker 1: That was it.

645
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:47,436
Speaker 1: Yeah.

646
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:55,639
Speaker 1: But, uh, it has a pretty good competitive co-op thing in that there's some screens and some events where you both have a task.

647
00:34:56,121 --> 00:35:01,058
Speaker 1: Like one, there's one boss guy jumps on a pulley and starts like escaping and you get all these targets to shoot.

648
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,320
Speaker 1: And I shot the targets faster.

649
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,677
Speaker 1: So at the end of gave me a huge point bonus and it was like, yeah, you beat your friend.

650
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,959
Speaker 0: I mean, time crisis too is the first time of the co-op, but really it was, you, it was just, Hey, let's make the game easier because now there's two people shooting the bad guys.

651
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:19,198
Speaker 0: Even though if you didn't have a co-op friend, there was an AI that shot the bad guys poorly.

652
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:26,660
Speaker 0: Uh, really all that did is sort of let you beat the game with your friend and you could compare scores, but no one gave a shit about score.

653
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:29,453
Speaker 0: You just cared about seeing the end of the game and then ever playing it again.

654
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:33,600
Speaker 0: In this, that the, uh, the actual, it says on the screen to win, lose.

655
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:36,520
Speaker 0: It actually tells you we, the word win and the word lose.

656
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:41,857
Speaker 0: And somehow that makes you care and makes you want to do better than your friend.

657
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,435
Speaker 1: A lot.

658
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:45,720
Speaker 1: I started taking a lot of risks to kill more guys than Scott faster.

659
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:46,239
Speaker 0: Yup.

660
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,039
Speaker 1: It paid off.

661
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,379
Speaker 1: I won every screen.

662
00:35:49,146 --> 00:35:49,860
Speaker 0: I didn't really care.

663
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,208
Speaker 0: I just wanted to try to beat the game.

664
00:35:51,228 --> 00:35:56,617
Speaker 0: still, even though the fact is the first time I said win, lose, I was like, well, I didn't know that was going to happen.

665
00:35:57,122 --> 00:36:08,019
Speaker 1: So the interesting thing that's kind of sad is that it prevents one mode of gameplay that I used to do occasionally at older time crises, holding both guns and playing both sides.

666
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,160
Speaker 0: I mean, you can not do it.

667
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,979
Speaker 1: The pedals are physically too far apart.

668
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,379
Speaker 0: Time crisis too, right?

669
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,580
Speaker 0: Time crisis one, there was only one gun in one screen.

670
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:24,199
Speaker 0: Time crisis two, you could do it because they were kind of close enough to each other that you could step on both pedals and sort of shoot the left screen, shoot the right screen, shoot the left screen, shoot the right screen.

671
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,280
Speaker 0: I think I don't know if crisis zone.

672
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:36,620
Speaker 0: I don't remember that being two player with the submachine gun, but there were some other arcade games that had submachine guns that weren't time crisis where you could hold both submachine guns, one per hand, right?

673
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:36,912
Speaker 1: Yeah.

674
00:36:38,223 --> 00:36:39,720
Speaker 0: But yeah, time crisis five.

675
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,120
Speaker 0: The screens are so big and the guns with the two pedals are so far apart.

676
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,620
Speaker 0: You can't possibly play both sides at once.

677
00:36:47,022 --> 00:36:57,540
Speaker 0: You know, you no matter how much you can split your legs, you can't hit the left pedal on the left one and the right pedal on the right one at the same time and still shoot and still hold both guns.

678
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:08,720
Speaker 0: Maybe if you were a satyr, maybe if you have, uh, four people, two people can control pedals and two people can have guns or one person in a, both guns and then two people on the pedals.

679
00:37:09,001 --> 00:37:21,520
Speaker 0: Or I don't know, maybe you could just, you know, rig some sort of, if you have it in your house, you can just like connect like extra pedals that are right near you and you can have all four, all four pedals right in front of you with two guns and one screen.

680
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:22,639
Speaker 0: I don't know.

681
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:26,039
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, you couldn't have one screen because the two screens are going to be different.

682
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:33,480
Speaker 1: Well, honestly, in the modern era, like I don't see gun games really coming back on consoles or in houses.

683
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:39,960
Speaker 0: Just no one's going to shell out, you know, with an LCD TV, it's very hard to get the system to work.

684
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,459
Speaker 0: You're going to need like extra stuff.

685
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,900
Speaker 0: People already don't got tired of buying plastic guitars and DDR pads.

686
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,799
Speaker 0: No one's buying guns for how few gun games there are.

687
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,740
Speaker 0: Who's paying for this, right?

688
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,136
Speaker 0: Nobody.

689
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:50,712
Speaker 1: Yup.

690
00:37:51,662 --> 00:37:54,900
Speaker 1: So I don't think this is even going to make an arcade resurgence.

691
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,960
Speaker 1: Like I'm surprised.

692
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,679
Speaker 0: I mean, it's probably a big deal in Japan.

693
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I am shocked that there is the time crisis five machine on the East coast of the United States.

694
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,067
Speaker 0: Yeah.

695
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,580
Speaker 1: Let alone in Wildwood, New Jersey, randomly surrounded by a literal sea of shit and cranes.

696
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,839
Speaker 1: I mean, the arcade it's in is nothing but garbage and cranes.

697
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,719
Speaker 0: Dude, the Yahtzee machine was so bad.

698
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:16,640
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

699
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,200
Speaker 0: I thought I was going to play actual Yahtzee.

700
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:18,720
Speaker 0: It's like, Nope.

701
00:38:19,403 --> 00:38:19,497
Speaker 1: Yeah.

702
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:19,689
Speaker 1: Nope.

703
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:26,539
Speaker 1: Other than time crisis five, the only good games in the arcades anywhere were all those pinball games in the one place.

704
00:38:26,901 --> 00:38:27,720
Speaker 0: Old pinball.

705
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,760
Speaker 1: The old DDR supernova machine.

706
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,060
Speaker 0: There wasn't even a good air hockey.

707
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,859
Speaker 0: There was bad air hockey.

708
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,013
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,140
Speaker 1: All the good air hockey's are gone.

710
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,820
Speaker 1: That last photon table is gone.

711
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,020
Speaker 0: Now they just had the one that goes ding on the side, which is garbage.

712
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,231
Speaker 0: Yeah.

713
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:38,379
Speaker 1: I watched some people playing it.

714
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,659
Speaker 0: Might as well not even play air hockey.

715
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:39,932
Speaker 1: Yup.

716
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,420
Speaker 1: Just give up.

717
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:56,253
Speaker 0: But yeah, time crisis, you know, is this game with like this long history that somehow just by being in, you know, time crisis one and two, especially just by being in every arcade, you know, any nerd that went to an arcade between the years of like 2000, I don't know.

718
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,688
Speaker 0: Well, I guess time crisis one, 96, 96.

719
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:00,900
Speaker 0: Right.

720
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,487
Speaker 1: So I think area 51 was nice.

721
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:09,799
Speaker 0: So anyone who went to an arcade in the nineties up through the two thousands and he was a nerd in that era.

722
00:39:10,323 --> 00:39:12,239
Speaker 0: You can't not know time crisis.

723
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,558
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't know if there's anyone who's like a time crisis fan.

724
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,400
Speaker 0: I've never met such a person, but it's just like a staple.

725
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:20,359
Speaker 0: And there's like NBA jam is a staple.

726
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,815
Speaker 1: Like when I thought arcade, I thought like, yeah, there's the fighting games.

727
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,620
Speaker 1: There's the time crisis machine.

728
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,920
Speaker 0: There's the DDR machines in USA cruise in the world.

729
00:39:28,101 --> 00:39:28,619
Speaker 0: That's a staple.

730
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:28,997
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,320
Speaker 1: There's certain games like Ridge Racer was always hanging out somewhere.

732
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:33,719
Speaker 0: Yup.

733
00:39:34,501 --> 00:39:35,759
Speaker 0: And you know, Marvel, Marvel vs.

734
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,160
Speaker 0: Capcom was a staple, but that's sort of brought it home.

735
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,856
Speaker 0: A lot of those fighting games racer.

736
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:41,853
Speaker 0: Yeah.

737
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,515
Speaker 0: Those, a lot of those games are able to bring it home, but the ones that weren't, you know, it's like they sort of disappeared and never came back.

738
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,276
Speaker 0: But here we go.

739
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,940
Speaker 0: Time crisis five coming back for whatever reason.

740
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,780
Speaker 1: So I guess what I'll say is when I go back to Wildwood later in the summer, I might, cause it's only 50 cents to continue.

741
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,536
Speaker 1: I think I just want to beat it.

742
00:39:59,149 --> 00:39:59,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

743
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,800
Speaker 0: If I have enough quarter, maybe I can find my laundry quarters that don't need anymore.

744
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:03,740
Speaker 0: Cause I now have a car.

745
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,239
Speaker 1: Let's just bring a bag of quarters and be like that guy who was doing this, preventing us from playing earlier.

746
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,500
Speaker 0: We'll just find a day with bad weather.

747
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:13,639
Speaker 0: And if there's a bad weather day, just go to the time crisis machine and beat it.

748
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,820
Speaker 0: Cause it never takes that long to beat time crisis.

749
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:19,818
Speaker 0: Now the thing is they fuck you because like the final boss will just keep killing you.

750
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,060
Speaker 0: Cause it is an arcade machine.

751
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,219
Speaker 1: You're not going to give up at the final boss.

752
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:25,320
Speaker 1: You're not just like, well, that's my last quarter.

753
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,740
Speaker 0: It's just like X-Men arcade machine.

754
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,479
Speaker 0: Magneto kills you so many times.

755
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,578
Speaker 0: You know, he just cheats like bullshit and then eventually, but you put enough money to beat him.

756
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,519
Speaker 0: And then that's the, you know, the end.

757
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:34,895
Speaker 1: Yeah.

758
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:38,161
Speaker 0: But it's worth it to see some ending that you'll pretty much, I don't know.

759
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:39,560
Speaker 0: if you know, you can see this ending on YouTube.

760
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:39,920
Speaker 0: You're proud.

761
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,860
Speaker 0: I want to say you can't cause you can see anything on YouTube.

762
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:44,359
Speaker 1: We kept skipping that.

763
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:47,220
Speaker 1: Like all there were going, there was like something about a briefcase.

764
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,040
Speaker 0: Well, and there's always something about a briefcase.

765
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,137
Speaker 0: That's how time crisis is.

766
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,738
Speaker 1: And there's that Robert Baxter guy who came, who appeared, who was yelling the whole time.

767
00:40:55,006 --> 00:40:55,070
Speaker 0: Yep.

768
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,139
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess he's in older time crises.

769
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:58,478
Speaker 0: So yep.

770
00:40:59,209 --> 00:40:59,419
Speaker 1: Wow.

771
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,680
Speaker 1: The plots of time crisis is really, really don't research those on the.

772
00:41:04,002 --> 00:41:04,759
Speaker 0: That's not good for you.

773
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:06,959
Speaker 0: That's really bad for your health.

774
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:08,177
Speaker 0: Really bad.

775
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,398
Speaker 1: Three months prior to the events of the game, a VSSC auditor was murdered.

776
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:15,520
Speaker 0: The one thing that really bothers me though, is that it's called time crisis.

777
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,980
Speaker 0: People don't know this because in time crisis one, you're actually traveling in time.

778
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,099
Speaker 0: Isn't the first level like a medieval castle that you're in?

779
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,180
Speaker 1: or I don't even remember.

780
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,932
Speaker 1: I was never like, I'm pretty sure.

781
00:41:23,972 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaker 0: in time crisis one, the first level is like a medieval castle and like your dudes with guns going through history to stop these bad guys or something.

782
00:41:31,683 --> 00:41:35,159
Speaker 0: And, uh, in the other time, starting in time crisis two, there's no more time travel.

783
00:41:36,903 --> 00:41:38,839
Speaker 1: I don't know if there's any time travel.

784
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:40,300
Speaker 0: I remember a medieval.

785
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:45,179
Speaker 1: I think it's called time crisis because there's a countdown timer that you are fighting.

786
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,500
Speaker 0: Why are you in a medieval castle in time crisis one?

787
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,280
Speaker 1: All right.

788
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:48,760
Speaker 1: Let's see.

789
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,251
Speaker 0: Is it a plot of time crisis?

790
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:54,375
Speaker 1: involves an attempted coup in the fictional Republic of Circea.

791
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,499
Speaker 1: For a millennium, the Garo family ruled Circea with an iron fist.

792
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:05,240
Speaker 1: in 1995, the VSSC, the international intelligence agency sent William McPherson who successfully toppled the Garo regime and became the first democratically elected president.

793
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,460
Speaker 1: The last remaining member of the Garo family.

794
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,139
Speaker 1: God damn, there's a lot.

795
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,139
Speaker 1: There is no mention of time travel.

796
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:10,979
Speaker 0: Okay.

797
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:12,500
Speaker 1: I don't think there's time travel.

798
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,558
Speaker 1: I think you're just making that up.

799
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:16,600
Speaker 0: The first level though is definitely a medieval castle.

800
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:22,399
Speaker 0: So I must have falsely interpreted that when I was young in the 90s playing that, that I was a guy with a gun.

801
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:26,617
Speaker 1: I think that's just the family's incest for the Garo family's ancestral home.

802
00:42:27,342 --> 00:42:29,260
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, it was a present time castle.

803
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:32,240
Speaker 0: I falsely interpreted what was going on.

804
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:37,199
Speaker 0: There's any time travel because as a wise man said, don't pay attention to the plot of time crisis.

805
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:42,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we're done here.

806
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,540

820
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:39,500
Speaker 1: Now I am walking around in this side of the town.

821
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,979
Speaker 1: I just can't hide away.

822
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:46,119
Speaker 1: How can I look in your eyes when I feel like you died?

823
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:48,497
Speaker 0: I have to run away.

824
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,056
Speaker 0: I'm falling in love again.

825
00:45:08,513 --> 00:45:10,329
Speaker 0: And I'm falling in love again.

826
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:30,388
Speaker 0: Yes.

827
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:30,780
Speaker 0: Yes.

828
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:31,568
Speaker 0: This is it.

829
00:45:31,996 --> 00:45:32,346
Speaker 0: This is it.
