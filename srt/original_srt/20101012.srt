1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,575
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, October 12th.

2
00:00:11,736 --> 00:00:12,180
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:13,019
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,170
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,140
Speaker 0: Tonight, Boggle Boggle.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,956
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,599
Speaker 1: Waka waka waka.

8
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:28,375
Speaker 0: No.

9
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,420
Speaker 1: I don't know why we thought that was a good idea for a title.

10
00:00:32,842 --> 00:00:33,498
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't it be?

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,224
Speaker 1: I don't know.

12
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:35,799
Speaker 1: It just seems... odd.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,997
Speaker 0: What's odd about it?

14
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:38,440
Speaker 1: Boggle Boggle?

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:38,848
Speaker 1: Yeah.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,146
Speaker 1: Why not just say it once?

17
00:00:40,529 --> 00:00:41,999
Speaker 1: Like Arakawa under the bridgey bridgey?

18
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:42,683
Speaker 0: Yeah.

19
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:45,517
Speaker 0: And because one of our most popular episodes was...

20
00:00:46,283 --> 00:00:47,080
Speaker 1: Boggle Boggle.

21
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:47,818
Speaker 1: Exactly.

22
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:55,500
Speaker 1: So, exactly 47 hours ago, I stopped drinking caffeine.

23
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:56,594
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

24
00:00:57,121 --> 00:00:57,726
Speaker 1: Not permanently.

25
00:00:58,634 --> 00:00:59,279
Speaker 1: I did a bunch of research.

26
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,580
Speaker 0: Well, what's the point if it's not permanently?

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,201
Speaker 0: Well,

28
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:16,200
Speaker 1: because I got bored and I was reading something over lunch and I learned a lot, this was last week, about caffeine and the effects on the body and the fact that once you build up a tolerance, it takes 48 hours, almost exactly on average, to reach the peak withdrawal symptoms.

29
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:23,780
Speaker 1: And then after that, by five days, all effects of caffeine are reversed and you're back to normal and your tolerance is zero.

30
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:30,180
Speaker 1: So it's been a long time since I've experienced what caffeine does when you don't have a tolerance for caffeine.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,620
Speaker 0: So basically, it's kind of like, remember back in... It's hard to avoid though, because I mean, I don't drink coffee or soda, but I mean, if you eat a Hershey's chocolate bar, that's it.

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,439
Speaker 1: There's so little, it basically doesn't count.

33
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,560
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, it's still, you know, it's like you gotta get zero, otherwise you gotta add a few hours, you know.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm right now at the peak of caffeine withdrawal, something I've not experienced in like four or five years.

35
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,979
Speaker 0: What does it feel like?

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,860
Speaker 1: It feels like a pounding headache.

37
00:01:55,187 --> 00:01:55,356
Speaker 1: Really?

38
00:01:55,561 --> 00:01:56,339
Speaker 1: That will not cease.

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, you really have a big headache?

40
00:01:58,021 --> 00:01:59,200
Speaker 1: I have a crazy headache.

41
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,100
Speaker 0: Did you take a Tylenol?

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,040
Speaker 1: No, fuck that.

43
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:01,960
Speaker 0: That's right.

44
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,659
Speaker 0: I'm gonna man up.

45
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,219
Speaker 0: That's right.

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,699
Speaker 1: Actually, I'm gonna take some aspirin right after the show.

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:06,428
Speaker 0: Yeah?

48
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:06,957
Speaker 0: Yes.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,679
Speaker 1: There's no aspirin tolerance.

50
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:11,359
Speaker 0: Yes.

51
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:17,580
Speaker 1: But I'm interested to see, because caffeine is a performance enhancer in many ways.

52
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:22,620
Speaker 1: But if you're a habitual user, it has kind of, it's like a pro and con thing, it's like a min-max.

53
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,319
Speaker 1: Like in Fallout, when you take like the one medicine that gives you one thing but hurts you another way, like the rads.

54
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:27,917
Speaker 1: Yeah.

55
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,279
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to clear out my rads.

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:43,460
Speaker 1: Much like, I think you've done this once or twice, remember the high school or college days when you'd have the plan of... If I don't masturbate for like a day, then it'll be way awesome when I do finally masturbate.

57
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,698
Speaker 1: No, you never saved up?

58
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:46,159
Speaker 1: No.

59
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:46,447
Speaker 1: No?

60
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:46,956
Speaker 1: No.

61
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,139
Speaker 1: You just masturbated every day?

62
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,480
Speaker 0: No, I just did whatever I felt like it.

63
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:53,839
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'd feel like it and then I wouldn't feel like it.

64
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,717
Speaker 1: I don't know, sometimes I have those days where I just always felt like it.

65
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,639
Speaker 0: No, that's 'cause you got some heat.

66
00:03:00,342 --> 00:03:03,140
Speaker 1: Or I was just bored, like when the wand servers were down.

67
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,660
Speaker 0: I just play some video games that weren't wands.

68
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:06,786
Speaker 1: Like what?

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,660
Speaker 1: I guess tribes.

70
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,539
Speaker 0: And watch some animes.

71
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:11,960
Speaker 1: Alright.

72
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,386
Speaker 1: So?

73
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:13,879
Speaker 0: So I got some news here.

74
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:14,377
Speaker 1: Oh, do ya?

75
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:14,734
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:19,500
Speaker 0: So, you know, we saw at PAX, Sonic 4.

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,638
Speaker 0: And it was looking pretty good, wasn't it?

78
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it looks like they finally got rid of the stretchy werewolf and just went back to Sonic runs around the game.

79
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,740
Speaker 0: Well, they got two games, actually, that are coming out.

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,020
Speaker 0: Sonic 4, which is a two and a half D. It's like the old school Sonic side-scrolling game, but it's two and a half D. And that's what I've been asking for.

81
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,400
Speaker 0: I've been like, you know, Nintendo sorta did it.

82
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:47,400
Speaker 0: It's like, look, you have these old 2D games, just make the exact same game, only make it two and a half D. Use a 3D game engine, but just keep the camera to the side and move it, you know, don't move it in or out.

83
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,920
Speaker 1: Or occasionally do something clever.

84
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,740
Speaker 0: Occasionally, but keep that light.

85
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,420
Speaker 0: You still want it to be fundamentally a side-scrolling game.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,280
Speaker 1: I mean, even in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you could throw the dude at the screen.

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,039
Speaker 0: Exactly.

88
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,339
Speaker 0: Alright, that's perfectly fine.

89
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:08,900
Speaker 0: And you can make some really good games, you know, with the easiness of 3D engines and the good looking graphics without having to do sprites like the old days with the pixels, right?

90
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:11,920
Speaker 0: And, you know, it'd be really awesome.

91
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,039
Speaker 0: So they did that, they're coming out with Sonic 4, which is that.

92
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,840
Speaker 0: They're also coming up with Sonic Colors.

93
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,000
Speaker 0: And Sonic Colors is basically the werewolf game without the werewolf part, from what we can tell.

94
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:32,900
Speaker 0: What's interesting is what they're doing is they're basically telling all the stores, you know, to try to take all the other Sonic games off the shelves, right?

95
00:04:35,702 --> 00:04:41,960
Speaker 0: The only Sonic games on the shelves, once these games come out, there's also a Kinect Sonic free writing game.

96
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,719
Speaker 0: And I think Sonic 4 is also coming to DS or Sonic, something's coming to DS, I don't know.

97
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:51,520
Speaker 0: They're basically trying to say, hey, get these old games off the shelves so that only the good Sonic titles will be on the shelf.

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,200
Speaker 0: That way, if they can maintain the quality, you know, and keep only quality Sonic stuff available.

99
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,560
Speaker 1: So how are they going to get them off the shelves?

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,840
Speaker 0: I mean, they basically say, hey, don't sell these anymore or return them or sell them now before the new ones come out.

101
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:08,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no one buys them anyway.

102
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:09,979
Speaker 1: There's a reason they're on the shelves.

103
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:10,705
Speaker 0: Right.

104
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:12,220
Speaker 0: But, you know, they'll get into the discount.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,700
Speaker 1: Kind of like remember that GameStop we went to in Wildwood that had like five tables full of Madden games.

106
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,281
Speaker 0: Yeah.

107
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,180
Speaker 0: I mean, they'll at least get them into the discount bin and off the rack.

108
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,501
Speaker 0: Right.

109
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:30,547
Speaker 0: So that way, hopefully, you know, over time, the people will get a better impression of Sonic, you know, and they won't dilute the franchise.

110
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:34,480
Speaker 0: if all the Sonic games on the shelves are good and they may keep that that way.

111
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:35,969
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

112
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:37,080
Speaker 1: I mean, it'll take a while.

113
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,863
Speaker 0: It'll take a while.

114
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:38,485
Speaker 0: Gamers care.

115
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:42,520
Speaker 1: But this could only affect people who are not hardcore gamers and don't know anything.

116
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:42,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

117
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:49,140
Speaker 1: Because anyone who knows anything will either know what they did or will know, yes, the new Sonic games are better and I play those.

118
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:53,340
Speaker 1: Or maybe I prefer the old shitty Sonic games because I'm a terrible person.

119
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:53,841
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:05:53,901 --> 00:06:03,900
Speaker 0: I mean, the quote here from the from the person who works for Sega is we could make a lot of money on back catalog Sonic titles, but let's keep the number of Sonic games available under control.

121
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,920
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you can have cannibalization if there are 10 Sonic games on the shelves with people seeing Sonic Rush DS or Sonic Rush Adventure.

122
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,420
Speaker 0: This may not help our overall strategy, which is which is to make Sonic stop sucking.

123
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,340
Speaker 0: And it looks like, you know, at least from these previews of Sonic for I mean, I'm going to get Sonic for it.

124
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,560
Speaker 0: It's actually the episodic nous of it while sort of annoying is actually has a benefit in that I can try it out for less money than the whole game to see if it's any good.

125
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,351
Speaker 0: And that I don't have to buy the rest of the levels.

126
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,660
Speaker 1: And at the same time, it sucks.

127
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:44,160
Speaker 1: Wasn't there the demo problem we learned about at the previous packs where if there is a short demo of a game available, sales tend to collapse because people realize, oh, that's what that game is.

128
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,024
Speaker 1: I don't need to play anymore.

129
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,029
Speaker 0: But there might not be.

130
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,616
Speaker 0: The thing is, this isn't a demo.

131
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:48,420
Speaker 0: This is you buy.

132
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:56,840
Speaker 0: That's like saying, oh, man, Half-Life 2, episode two, you know, I guess no one will buy that if there's a demo called Half-Life 2, but Half-Life 2 is not free.

133
00:06:57,422 --> 00:06:59,409
Speaker 0: So, yeah, OK, so your demo is not free.

134
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:02,040
Speaker 0: So you're still making money off all the people who buy the first part.

135
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:05,860
Speaker 0: So and then maybe one day they'll buy the second part, you know, way later.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,120
Speaker 1: My only concern is, are they as are there any details on how they're trying to get these old Sonic games off the shelves?

137
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,740
Speaker 0: Because I already stopped printing them and stop releasing new ones that way.

138
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,803
Speaker 1: Oh, that's fine.

139
00:07:16,863 --> 00:07:17,265
Speaker 1: That's fine.

140
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:21,360
Speaker 1: But the thing is, what do you do with the GameStop that has every Sonic title in a giant pile?

141
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,040
Speaker 0: I'm sure they'll stay in a giant pile until the GameStop doesn't know.

142
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,963
Speaker 1: See, I'm curious.

143
00:07:26,003 --> 00:07:30,780
Speaker 1: I wonder if they're going to pull strong arm tactics like a lot of manufacturers do with Amazon, where they pull that B.S.

144
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,560
Speaker 1: where you see a thing in Amazon and it's like the MSRP is X, the real price.

145
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,069
Speaker 1: We can't show you unless you add it to your cart.

146
00:07:38,852 --> 00:07:41,039
Speaker 1: But then when you add it to your cart, you see what the real price is.

147
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what happened with some of the TVs I was looking at.

148
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:43,861
Speaker 0: Yep.

149
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:45,886
Speaker 1: However, notice how Amazon changed it now.

150
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:51,440
Speaker 1: Instead of having to add it to your cart, you click show me the price and it quote unquote adds it to your cart.

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,383
Speaker 0: It depends on the item.

152
00:07:52,403 --> 00:07:58,200
Speaker 0: There are some items you can click show me the price and some you actually have to go like proceed to check out, like all the way.

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,562
Speaker 1: I haven't seen that in a long time.

154
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:07,760
Speaker 1: It was a recent change because, you know, almost all of the audio and video equipment I'm looking at, Amazon selling way under MSRP.

155
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:09,268
Speaker 0: Interesting.

156
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,179
Speaker 0: All right.

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
Speaker 1: Because, you know, Project ST is coming along and I'm looking at HD cameras.

158
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,680
Speaker 1: I luckily Amazon reviews saved me from buying one that was really cheap and really awesome looking.

159
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:19,859
Speaker 0: But it wasn't good.

160
00:08:20,081 --> 00:08:21,085
Speaker 1: It was like a Canon one.

161
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,129
Speaker 1: It was like six hundred bucks.

162
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,377
Speaker 1: It looked super like good for like the HV 40, whatever.

163
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,082
Speaker 1: I forget.

164
00:08:26,142 --> 00:08:31,215
Speaker 1: All I remember is I heard that one's good at everything we needed, except it's medium and low light.

165
00:08:31,255 --> 00:08:33,059
Speaker 1: performance was the worst.

166
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,807
Speaker 1: Like if the lights don't have lights.

167
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:35,711
Speaker 1: Yeah.

168
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:37,520
Speaker 1: But even then, we need a good camera.

169
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:41,910
Speaker 1: Like it was way under way cheaper cameras in bad light.

170
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:43,434
Speaker 1: But it was great if you have awesome light.

171
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:44,116
Speaker 0: Interesting.

172
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:44,598
Speaker 0: Yeah.

173
00:08:44,918 --> 00:08:45,159
Speaker 0: All right.

174
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,066
Speaker 0: So what you got over there?

175
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,180
Speaker 1: Well, we were at the burning convention.

176
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,567
Speaker 0: You want to talk about the burning?

177
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:52,436
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the burning convention because it was.

178
00:08:52,637 --> 00:08:53,320
Speaker 0: Did you get burned?

179
00:08:53,901 --> 00:09:01,260
Speaker 1: I got burned once because I, you know, with the New York Comic-Con and all the other stuff going on, I did not technically register to play games.

180
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Speaker 1: So I was not going to show up and like manhandle my way into a game that someone flew from like Seattle to be there to play.

181
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:09,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

182
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,653
Speaker 0: I think there was at least one guy from the UK, I think.

183
00:09:12,713 --> 00:09:12,974
Speaker 0: Right.

184
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:13,295
Speaker 0: Yeah.

185
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:13,596
Speaker 0: Yeah.

186
00:09:13,817 --> 00:09:14,520
Speaker 0: It was pretty interesting.

187
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,532
Speaker 0: Basically, on Friday, we went to the New York Comic-Con New Guiana Festival.

188
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:18,998
Speaker 0: We'll talk about that another day.

189
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:19,079
Speaker 1: Yep.

190
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,385
Speaker 1: Some Wednesday forthcoming.

191
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:32,340
Speaker 0: The only I will say, though, this is gaming related, that I forgot that Inafune, the creator of Mega Man, well, one of the, you know, effectively creator of Mega Man, it was obviously a team effort, right, was there.

192
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,348
Speaker 0: And that was the only thing I forgot about and did not see.

193
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:37,100
Speaker 0: I could have gone to Chile with him at the Capcom booth, whatever.

194
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:40,208
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'll see him again someday.

195
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:44,625
Speaker 1: There was also the fact that WotC was there and I did not realize, I don't even know when they announced it.

196
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:47,333
Speaker 1: I'm just so disconnected from WotC's BS.

197
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,680
Speaker 1: They have D&D Gamma World.

198
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,387
Speaker 0: That's what everyone's talking about lately.

199
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:53,740
Speaker 1: And I looked at the mechanic as far as I can tell.

200
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,206
Speaker 0: It's D&D, but Gamma World.

201
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:55,467
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:58,540
Speaker 1: It's literally, hey, you thought Gamma World was cool, right?

203
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,660
Speaker 1: Well, we're going to put all the Gamma World proper nouns on top of your shitty same old Dungeons and Dragons.

204
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,322
Speaker 0: That's exactly.

205
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:06,456
Speaker 0: All they do is they sell a book that has different proper nouns.

206
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:06,959
Speaker 0: That's all they do.

207
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:08,726
Speaker 1: It's brilliant in a way.

208
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:09,188
Speaker 1: Yeah.

209
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,077
Speaker 0: I mean, they do change some numbers, right?

210
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:19,518
Speaker 0: They have to be like, OK, look, instead of sword, it's slime laser and it does not a D8 damage.

211
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:20,379
Speaker 0: It does a D6.

212
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:24,634
Speaker 1: It does a D8, but you have the special D8 that you got to buy.

213
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,939
Speaker 1: There's a picture of a laser on it.

214
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:27,102
Speaker 0: Whatever.

215
00:10:27,122 --> 00:10:27,985
Speaker 1: I'm waiting for that day.

216
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:31,157
Speaker 0: But yeah, I, you know, I went to the Comic-Con.

217
00:10:31,177 --> 00:10:31,960
Speaker 0: I took Friday off.

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,460
Speaker 0: I went to the Comic-Con MFS Live Friday, so I had Saturday and Sunday free to go to the Burning Con all day, both days.

219
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:41,200
Speaker 0: And I played in every session except the final one, because I was too tired.

220
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember Emily and I got back and you were just like passed out on the couch.

221
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

222
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:53,020
Speaker 1: So that was part of the reason why I decided to give up caffeine for a while, because at the con, I drank like four Red Bulls.

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,363
Speaker 0: That's too many.

224
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:59,220
Speaker 1: And then I like I felt the Red Bull running out as we're hanging out on the couch and I was just done.

225
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,086
Speaker 0: You know, you should do so.

226
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:00,308
Speaker 0: Wait.

227
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:01,840
Speaker 0: So what was the last time you had a caffeine?

228
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,099
Speaker 1: Forty seven and a half hours ago.

229
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:13,920
Speaker 0: You should you should call Conrad and challenge him to who has who can rack up more consecutive no caffeine hours, because maybe if it's a game might have to go into minutes.

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,386
Speaker 0: I'm just saying we can talk.

231
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:16,927
Speaker 0: We can get it.

232
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:21,500
Speaker 1: You know, I think if I called Conrad and pointed, what did you got it?

233
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,980
Speaker 0: What would it be fair to have a taurine, no sugar, but no caffeine beverage?

234
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,636
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what would not be fair is drinking like a rana because that just metabolizes into caffeine.

235
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:31,620
Speaker 0: Really interesting.

236
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:40,059
Speaker 1: That's how I learned a lot about caffeine, but it is a performance enhancer and it decreases the risk of Alzheimer's straight up.

237
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,141
Speaker 0: All right.

238
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:49,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, I do want to point out with the comic con, though, and the gaming stuff, I kind of got on my caffeine tangent there because it's kind of on my mind because of this blazing headache.

239
00:11:49,821 --> 00:11:50,367
Speaker 0: That's fine.

240
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,154
Speaker 0: You deserve it.

241
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:54,919
Speaker 1: Is that Watsy?

242
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,760
Speaker 1: It's weird how the perceptions of this con from us as like performers and people who work with the people on the back end went because before it was like, yeah, double con.

243
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,760
Speaker 1: We'll do like five or six panels, all our awesome stuff.

244
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:14,500
Speaker 1: And it looked like gaming was going to be a huge part because there was a lot of gaming at the New York Comic Con in previous years.

245
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,545
Speaker 0: The biggest gaming was.

246
00:12:15,565 --> 00:12:18,760
Speaker 0: there was a Square Enix booth, which had a bunch of anime fans pretty thrilled.

247
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,281
Speaker 0: Right.

248
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:22,820
Speaker 0: And there was a. there was a Capcom booth, which is really the best.

249
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,739
Speaker 0: And they because they had Marvel's Capcom three showing off.

250
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,905
Speaker 0: We got all the guys.

251
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,493
Speaker 0: That's definitely the game for a comic.

252
00:12:28,513 --> 00:12:29,820
Speaker 1: There was good art around that.

253
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,780
Speaker 1: You know what I found out about Marvel's Capcom three?

254
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,484
Speaker 1: Did you find out?

255
00:12:32,826 --> 00:12:34,719
Speaker 0: it has simple mode, you know, simple mode works.

256
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,708
Speaker 1: Mega Man wins.

257
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:39,620
Speaker 0: No, there's an attack button.

258
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:43,100
Speaker 0: There's a special move button and there's another button.

259
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:44,428
Speaker 1: I think I could be good at that.

260
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:46,158
Speaker 1: So all you do is got no, no, no.

261
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,040
Speaker 1: Fast forward to like a year from now, we've got this game.

262
00:12:49,381 --> 00:12:54,080
Speaker 1: You go online to play simple mode and some dude still just kicks our asses into the ground.

263
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,580
Speaker 0: Apparently in simple mode, you only have access to a couple of special moves.

264
00:12:57,741 --> 00:12:59,337
Speaker 0: It's basically like playing Smash Brothers.

265
00:12:59,418 --> 00:12:59,600
Speaker 0: Right.

266
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:04,139
Speaker 0: And when you play a non simple mode, you have a lot more moves available to you.

267
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:06,020
Speaker 0: But it's you know, it's not simple.

268
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:18,240
Speaker 1: But while there was gaming stuff prior to the con and based on previous comic cons, like gaming, because it's a thriving, vibrant industry, appeared like it was going to be a really big part of the comic con.

269
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,304
Speaker 1: Like originally we were talks.

270
00:13:19,324 --> 00:13:24,379
Speaker 1: They were like, yeah, run all those awesome gaming panels you run at PAX, because we really want to ramp up the gaming.

271
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 1: And as the con got bigger and bigger and, you know, we eventually it did sell out on Saturday.

272
00:13:29,781 --> 00:13:31,119
Speaker 1: It was a frickin enormous con.

273
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:39,340
Speaker 1: I think the hierarchy of industries at the very bottom is fan produced anime related stuff.

274
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:42,900
Speaker 1: At that con, the bottom of the bottom was fan anime.

275
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,960
Speaker 1: The anime artist alley was at the bottom left corner of the Javits.

276
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was.

277
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:47,691
Speaker 0: they separated it.

278
00:13:47,752 --> 00:13:48,980
Speaker 0: I kind of wish it would have been combined.

279
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:01,220
Speaker 0: They combined the dealers rooms, even though the exhibit hall, which was also the dealers room, right, was segregated, like all the old school, all the comic retailers in one corner and all the publishers in another area and all the toys in another area.

280
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,439
Speaker 0: You know, the best booth is Bandai booth.

281
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,420
Speaker 1: But the point I want to make is that so that's the bottom.

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,220
Speaker 1: And above that was, you know, professional anime stuff.

283
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:13,760
Speaker 1: And then like indie comics and then real comics and gaming.

284
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:17,480
Speaker 1: And above all of that, far and away was Hollywood bullshit.

285
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,977
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hollywood and TV.

286
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:22,740
Speaker 1: Animal Planet had one of the biggest booths in there.

287
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,379
Speaker 0: It wasn't that big, but it was the fanciest.

288
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all go inside.

289
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 0: You go inside.

290
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:28,052
Speaker 1: I looked outside.

291
00:14:28,072 --> 00:14:28,800
Speaker 1: There's a video playing.

292
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,660
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell, it's promoting a show that is about like searching for Bigfoot.

293
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:33,309
Speaker 0: OK.

294
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:33,860
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,500
Speaker 0: That's why is that an animal plant?

296
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,000
Speaker 1: The same reason Animal Planet's primary other programing seems to be midgets.

297
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,059
Speaker 0: We're talking about the Burning Con.

298
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:40,809
Speaker 0: Midgets?

299
00:14:41,075 --> 00:14:41,219
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:41,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, midgets.

301
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,800
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the Burning Con.

302
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:43,340
Speaker 1: And ghosts.

303
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,980
Speaker 1: But it was weird that the New York Universal Comic Con was going to have this big gaming presence and Hollywood just kicked it right to the curb.

304
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,393
Speaker 0: Yep.

305
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,099
Speaker 1: So we had to get all of our gaming at the Burning Con.

306
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:57,960
Speaker 0: Burning Con is pretty much just play burning games all weekend.

307
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,040
Speaker 0: And that's exactly what I did.

308
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,400
Speaker 0: And all the games were awesome to various degrees of awesome.

309
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,139
Speaker 1: It was funny to be there.

310
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,300
Speaker 0: Even the one that I ran.

311
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,700
Speaker 0: And the weirdest thing that I want to say is that during the course of the weekend, everyone kept talking about this RPG called Apocalypse World.

312
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,117
Speaker 0: And they keep telling me how awesome it is.

313
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:17,519
Speaker 0: And then when I played free market, right, I was running it.

314
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
Speaker 0: And they were all talking about this apocalypse world.

315
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:24,099
Speaker 0: And they were like, that guy who just got up from the table was the guy who made it.

316
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:27,920
Speaker 0: I was like, so the guy who made this game everyone was talking about played in my free market.

317
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,019
Speaker 0: And, you know, they seemed like they liked it.

318
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,619
Speaker 0: So I guess I did a good job.

319
00:15:32,004 --> 00:15:32,419
Speaker 1: We'll see.

320
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,080
Speaker 0: We'll see.

321
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:33,739
Speaker 0: We'll see.

322
00:15:34,321 --> 00:15:36,998
Speaker 1: I played in one game that was basically, all right, 60 years.

323
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,499
Speaker 1: You know, there was one of those like rim games where someone makes a weird like setting and you play Burning Wheel in it.

324
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:42,640
Speaker 0: I hate it when people do that.

325
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,660
Speaker 0: I just want to play straight up.

326
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,560
Speaker 1: Half the games there were like that.

327
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:44,860
Speaker 0: I know.

328
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,679
Speaker 0: I only played in straight up games.

329
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,320
Speaker 0: I didn't plan any weird hacks or anything.

330
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,999
Speaker 1: But it was all right.

331
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:52,620
Speaker 1: It's like 60 years before Sauron and all this bullshit in the Lord of the Rings world.

332
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,940
Speaker 1: And no man can kill the Witch King, right?

333
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,198
Speaker 0: So, well, I mean, yeah, people could.

334
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,176
Speaker 0: No man.

335
00:15:58,622 --> 00:15:58,818
Speaker 0: Real hard.

336
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,397
Speaker 1: No man.

337
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,109
Speaker 0: OK.

338
00:16:00,641 --> 00:16:06,479
Speaker 1: So knowing that they form a squad of female assassins and we went off to try to kill the Witch King.

339
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,520
Speaker 1: We succeeded in killing one Nazgul and then we ran out of time because it was one in the morning.

340
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,400
Speaker 0: OK.

341
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,572
Speaker 0: How about that?

342
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:19,800
Speaker 1: But it was funny to see, you know, Luke, you know, he's there and all the people are there and they're so excited.

343
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:20,840
Speaker 1: And he gave the keynote.

344
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,739
Speaker 1: I'm glad that he actually had a keynote and called it a keynote, even though he should have done something about that UPS that was beeping throughout the entirety of it.

345
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:28,278
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,920
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, it's not something he does that often.

347
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,758
Speaker 0: He's got to build the skills.

348
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's definitely true.

349
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,579
Speaker 0: But then there's no way to better way to build the skills and do it.

350
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:44,157
Speaker 1: The funny part was a lot of people traveled from way away to be here because burning wheel people who get into it are hardcore.

351
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:58,060
Speaker 1: Like you get to a point where you realize, yeah, I'm one of those burning wheel people and to be in a place where it was all hardcore burning wheel people and all of the Luke was basically it was weird because they were kind of nervous around him.

352
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,980
Speaker 1: But at the same time, gamers are generally more chill with each other.

353
00:17:01,345 --> 00:17:02,219
Speaker 1: They were also chill.

354
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,980
Speaker 1: So people would be like, really, really nervous and like almost hero worshiping Luke.

355
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:10,617
Speaker 1: But then, like, he'd start talking and then a second later, they're totally chill and just talking with him.

356
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:11,059
Speaker 1: Yeah.

357
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,261
Speaker 1: It's like the opposite of when we go to an anime con, there's the famous person and it's just.

358
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:18,040
Speaker 0: he's not Gary Gygax.

359
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,958
Speaker 0: He lives down the street.

360
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,159
Speaker 1: It's like, well, he lives down the street from us.

361
00:17:22,561 --> 00:17:25,255
Speaker 1: He doesn't live down the street from everyone, but it's still.

362
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,140
Speaker 0: it's like they were in his house the night before.

363
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,873
Speaker 0: It's not like.

364
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,380
Speaker 1: Yeah.

365
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,712
Speaker 1: Though we do definitely, I think, take I don't.

366
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:37,942
Speaker 1: we're too used to the fact that if we have a problem, like we have a rules issue, we just email Luke and he's like, oh, here you go.

367
00:17:38,922 --> 00:17:39,776
Speaker 0: He sort of gets it.

368
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,040
Speaker 0: I sort of bother him, whatever.

369
00:17:41,402 --> 00:17:42,257
Speaker 0: He doesn't like it.

370
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:42,595
Speaker 1: Yeah.

371
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,018
Speaker 1: Like Luke.

372
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,140
Speaker 0: Now that I got your head is a big typo in this page of the book.

373
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,672
Speaker 0: He's like, shut up.

374
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,580
Speaker 1: We're trying to do dual witch.

375
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,140
Speaker 1: And this happened.

376
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,610
Speaker 0: What do we do?

377
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,238
Speaker 0: What are you calling me?

378
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:04,980
Speaker 1: All right, it may be a low energy show, but it's time for things of the day.

379
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,325
Speaker 0: My thing today is rims.

380
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:09,840
Speaker 0: headache may grow large anyway, so here we go.

381
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,419
Speaker 0: Check this out.

382
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,560
Speaker 0: This is what I've always wanted.

383
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:14,820
Speaker 0: And I think this actually proves a lot of points I've made in the past.

384
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,920
Speaker 0: This is a thing called eight button Starcraft.

385
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:24,299
Speaker 0: And this guy basically made a mod for Starcraft and it adds this little interface to the top of the screen with eight buttons on it.

386
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:32,000
Speaker 0: And basically what the eight buttons are is there's one button for each of the major unit types in whatever race you've picked.

387
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:36,420
Speaker 0: And there are three buttons below that, which is attack, retreat and expand.

388
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,480
Speaker 0: So you pick a, you know, a type of creatures.

389
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,880
Speaker 0: Let's say you're the Zerg, you pick Hydra list and then you pick expand and it'll just automatically expand your base in the most efficient way possible and build Hydra lists.

390
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:54,460
Speaker 0: And then you click attack and it'll make the Hydra list that you have attack in the most efficient way possible.

391
00:18:55,704 --> 00:18:57,480
Speaker 0: And you don't have to do any micro or anything.

392
00:18:58,402 --> 00:19:00,600
Speaker 1: And I want nothing more than to play this.

393
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,858
Speaker 1: I don't think I'll even bother playing regular Starcraft if I get my hands on.

394
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:04,678
Speaker 0: this is totally awesome.

395
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,531
Speaker 0: This is the way to go.

396
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:18,280
Speaker 1: Uh, it proves the underlying problem with Starcraft and most RTS is I would argue the entire genre of RTS is as we know them, popular RTS is at least they're not strategy games.

397
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,500
Speaker 1: They're, they're like fighting games.

398
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,600
Speaker 1: You're just, you have this top down view, but they're not that much different from a Soul Calibur or a Street Fighter.

399
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,780
Speaker 0: Well, the difference is, right, is that you're the, the meaning, there are meaningful decisions, right?

400
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,559
Speaker 0: When do you attack?

401
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,300
Speaker 0: When do you retreat?

402
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,280
Speaker 0: When do you expand?

403
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,540
Speaker 0: How much, you know, that sort of thing.

404
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,880
Speaker 1: There are meaningful decisions to be made, but there are perfectly optimal strategies to enact things like kiting.

405
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,979
Speaker 1: The fact that I know exactly what I want to do.

406
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:52,640
Speaker 1: I want this guy to, you know, do this thing, but the only way to make the game do that is to go click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, You have to physically do it.

407
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,340
Speaker 0: And physically doing it is a solved problem.

408
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,916
Speaker 0: There is a perfect way to execute and it's simply a matter of, can you execute it with your hands?

409
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,360
Speaker 0: You know, otherwise, even though you made the correct decision, it won't happen.

410
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:08,000
Speaker 1: DDR is the same way in some regards.

411
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,280
Speaker 1: There are some songs I'm trying to beat all the max songs on maniac.

412
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,620
Speaker 1: And there are some of them that I know exactly what the pattern is.

413
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,699
Speaker 1: I simply cannot make my feet move fast enough to execute it.

414
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,920
Speaker 1: Did I solve it somehow?

415
00:20:21,562 --> 00:20:23,040
Speaker 0: DDR is a game of dexterity.

416
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,660
Speaker 0: It doesn't have the word strategy in the title.

417
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:30,400
Speaker 0: Ah, but, but at least, at least it's dance dance revolution.

418
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,500
Speaker 0: It's a rhythm game.

419
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,740
Speaker 0: It claims that you need to be able to dance and have rhythm.

420
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,957
Speaker 0: Starcraft is a game we have to craft and have strategy.

421
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:40,199
Speaker 1: At no point do I craft stars.

422
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,139
Speaker 0: No, that's, you know, play Minecraft instead.

423
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,719
Speaker 0: You'll craft a mine real quick.

424
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,460
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah, that's, you know, that, I guess it's not even just that.

425
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,639
Speaker 1: It's not that like, if it were like Counter-Strike, I solved, I know what to do.

426
00:20:54,981 --> 00:20:56,939
Speaker 1: Shoot the guy in the head, shoot the other guy in the head.

427
00:20:57,302 --> 00:20:59,320
Speaker 1: But the execution of it is difficult.

428
00:20:59,461 --> 00:21:02,360
Speaker 1: And that's, what's interesting because the, the, I tried.

429
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,180
Speaker 0: Well, but the thing that's the thing is the decision.

430
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,520
Speaker 0: There is no decision to be made.

431
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,860
Speaker 0: The decision is always shoot the guy in the head, right?

432
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:13,960
Speaker 1: You know, it's, it's one of the other hair, but there's also the decision making aspects like go around the corner or not.

433
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:17,120
Speaker 1: Do we storm the front or do we circle around back?

434
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,960
Speaker 0: But the execution of that is trivially easy.

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,679
Speaker 1: Circle around back.

436
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,480
Speaker 0: The execution of circling around back is trivially easy.

437
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,220
Speaker 1: No, not necessarily.

438
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:23,957
Speaker 1: I mean, depending on.

439
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,680
Speaker 0: You walk, you walk in the right direction.

440
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,337
Speaker 1: No playing against good players or on a good team, like on a non-pub server, like 8v8.

441
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:38,172
Speaker 1: Lately, I've been joining a lot of the pub tournament servers where they run tournament rules, but there's still a pub and it's much.

442
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,571
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike is a whole different game on that.

443
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:46,240
Speaker 1: If I were younger, I think I would consider planning again because it was such a different experience, whatever.

444
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,739
Speaker 1: But like even the execution of circling around back, like what rate do you go?

445
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,879
Speaker 1: You know, cover fire someone covering the hallway while someone moves up to the next cover.

446
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,520
Speaker 1: It's very procedural.

447
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:03,420
Speaker 1: There's a lot of very kind of not necessarily tedious, but there's a lot of dexterity based minimal elements bit by bit by bit along the way.

448
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:15,098
Speaker 1: It's not trivial to execute even something as simple as storm the front, but in Starcraft, not only do you have to do all of that, but it's boring as fuck and completely uninteresting to kites.

449
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,678
Speaker 1: That is not fun to do.

450
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:20,160
Speaker 1: That is an artifact of old games that didn't have the ability to have good.

451
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Speaker 0: I actually saw some Blizzard, some chat, some Blizzard person made some comments and they were like, they basically ought to summarize it and paraphrase.

452
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:31,460
Speaker 0: They know there's micro.

453
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,059
Speaker 0: They know they could eliminate it.

454
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,398
Speaker 0: They thought about eliminating it.

455
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:38,160
Speaker 0: They, you know, they probably even made some tests where it was eliminated.

456
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,160
Speaker 0: But, uh, but South Korea, well, no, but they basically said, look, no arts.

457
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,375
Speaker 0: Yes.

458
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,360
Speaker 0: That ever eliminated micro as increased sales dramatically.

459
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:48,238
Speaker 0: So why should we do it?

460
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,799
Speaker 1: See now what I would argue what they should have done.

461
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,620
Speaker 0: They should make a different game.

462
00:22:53,002 --> 00:22:55,537
Speaker 0: That is, you know, they should let Starcraft be.

463
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:55,980
Speaker 0: it's hard.

464
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:56,838
Speaker 0: Starcraft self.

465
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:57,400
Speaker 0: Exactly.

466
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,579
Speaker 0: They should make, they should make Warcraft for an arts.

467
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:00,746
Speaker 0: Yes.

468
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,498
Speaker 0: That's easy.

469
00:23:02,062 --> 00:23:04,257
Speaker 0: You know, that doesn't have micro doesn't have micro.

470
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:05,553
Speaker 0: Exactly.

471
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,440
Speaker 1: Because the thing is Starcraft is a legitimate kind of game.

472
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:16,300
Speaker 1: And while I don't like it and I will make arguments as to why it's not a good game from a lot of perspectives, it's a perfectly viable, popular game among hardcore people.

473
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,117
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with that.

474
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:26,600
Speaker 1: But the fact that that is the only direction that RTS have gone in the last decade really bothers me because it's an unexplored there's that we did all paddle about this.

475
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,280
Speaker 1: It packs on, you know, why don't you just do something cool?

476
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:31,140
Speaker 1: Do something interesting.

477
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,960
Speaker 1: Why is no one making an RTS that isn't just the, oh my God, spam click fast.

478
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,195
Speaker 1: He, he, he, he, he, he.

479
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:39,139
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

480
00:23:39,421 --> 00:23:40,060
Speaker 1: That's your thing of the day.

481
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,180
Speaker 1: So this is, I think, pretty cool.

482
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,998
Speaker 1: I love it when people make, like remember that, uh, silent star wars, the silent movie star wars.

483
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:49,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

484
00:23:49,688 --> 00:23:49,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

485
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:50,638
Speaker 1: Well, this is like that.

486
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,380
Speaker 1: It's a fifties horror sci-fi movie trailer to inception.

487
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,339
Speaker 1: That is actually crazily well done.

488
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,580
Speaker 1: It's in the style and it's actually accurate to the movie.

489
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,000
Speaker 1: However, spoilers.

490
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,200
Speaker 1: Okay.

491
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,597
Speaker 1: Yeah.

492
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,620
Speaker 1: Old movie trailers spoiled the shit out of things.

493
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,180
Speaker 1: And in true fashion, this spoils the shit out of inception.

494
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,560
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

495
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,260
Speaker 0: So the meta moment.

496
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:13,538
Speaker 1: Oh, you said it.

497
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,300
Speaker 1: Usually I say it anyway.

498
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,159
Speaker 0: They've met a moment.

499
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,180
Speaker 1: So we got no conventions until mag fast.

500
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:19,994
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

501
00:24:20,881 --> 00:24:24,600
Speaker 1: Uh, what other convention are we going to after mag fast?

502
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,369
Speaker 0: It's good.

503
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,716
Speaker 1: Magfest is in like January or February.

504
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,528
Speaker 1: All right.

505
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,578
Speaker 0: So that's, that's soon.

506
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,000
Speaker 0: But there's also holidays, which means there'll be holiday type events.

507
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,338
Speaker 0: Who knows?

508
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:36,300
Speaker 0: Um, there is a book club.

509
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,699
Speaker 0: The book club book is currently world war Z.

510
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,740
Speaker 1: I don't want to read that by max Brooks.

511
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,658
Speaker 1: You realize since you picked that book, I've read three other books because my brain is like, don't, I don't want her.

512
00:24:49,084 --> 00:24:49,600
Speaker 0: I haven't started.

513
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,159
Speaker 0: I haven't started it yet, but I got it.

514
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:51,959
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it soon.

515
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,719
Speaker 1: I just read, I just like blew through the second lock lab or a book.

516
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:55,938
Speaker 0: I'm going to read it soon.

517
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:56,455
Speaker 0: All right.

518
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:01,480
Speaker 1: You know, I haven't started, but whatever, by the way, as a total aside for book club interested listeners.

519
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:05,239
Speaker 1: Remember the lives of Locke Lamora and how we weren't, you know, we'll see where it goes with the sequel.

520
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,060
Speaker 1: I will not spoil anything.

521
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,200
Speaker 1: The sequel proves that the series is not bullshit.

522
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:10,700
Speaker 0: Okay.

523
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,119
Speaker 1: The sequel picks up where it should have picked up.

524
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:17,400
Speaker 1: And the problem that is introduced is the problem that needed to be introduced.

525
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:18,099
Speaker 0: Okay.

526
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:20,760
Speaker 1: I'll leave it at that, but I was pleased already.

527
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,840
Speaker 0: So, uh, also, you know, we have a forum and a website from recruit.com.

528
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,940
Speaker 1: Oh, we were scraping the bottom of the barrel for meta.

529
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,580
Speaker 0: Now you should go to it, you know, just cause people don't.

530
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:35,020
Speaker 1: No, I, there's been a recent change in the past at a con.

531
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,500
Speaker 1: Someone would come and be like, Oh my God, you're rim and Scott.

532
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:37,898
Speaker 1: Hey.

533
00:25:38,382 --> 00:25:40,059
Speaker 1: And usually when we ask, Hey, are you in the forum?

534
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,495
Speaker 1: They're like, I read it, but I don't pose.

535
00:25:44,515 --> 00:25:46,040
Speaker 1: this past weekend.

536
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:51,200
Speaker 1: Almost everyone I ran into had a forum account and had posted at least a couple of times.

537
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:51,424
Speaker 1: Whoa.

538
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,194
Speaker 0: All right.

539
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:52,830
Speaker 0: Yeah.

540
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,580
Speaker 0: Go to forum.

541
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:54,899
Speaker 0: And we also have a Twitter account.

542
00:25:55,103 --> 00:25:55,679
Speaker 0: It's geek nights.

543
00:25:56,142 --> 00:26:01,305
Speaker 0: And, uh, we have a thing that's automatically tweeting out links to old episodes once a day.

544
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,659
Speaker 0: So I know cause we only do two a week.

545
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:05,560
Speaker 0: Maybe you're a relatively new listener.

546
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:07,619
Speaker 0: You want to catch up on old shows.

547
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:11,340
Speaker 0: It'll just, it'll, you know, sort of alert you of an old episode once a day.

548
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:15,380
Speaker 0: So you can use that to, uh, you know, keep track of your potting or whatever.

549
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,000
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna, someone requested.

550
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,995
Speaker 0: I make some RSS feeds.

551
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,659
Speaker 0: So I'm going to get around to that and it'll be, it'll be all good.

552
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,280
Speaker 1: Yeah.

553
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:25,860
Speaker 1: However, you should bear in mind that we've been doing geek nights since 2005.

554
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,740
Speaker 0: Some of the old episodes, it's random.

555
00:26:27,841 --> 00:26:29,459
Speaker 0: Remember, I'm not picking these by hand.

556
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,740
Speaker 0: Quality may vary, will vary greatly.

557
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,520
Speaker 1: You might get the masturbation episode.

558
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Speaker 1: Take a look at the title before you, uh, you might get the, the first episode we ever put up on Halloween.

559
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:40,532
Speaker 0: Yeah.

560
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:45,040
Speaker 0: You might 2005 look at the episode title before you choose whether or not you can listen to it or not.

561
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,339
Speaker 1: I realized in the opening of the show, we should probably start saying the year.

562
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:49,797
Speaker 1: Why?

563
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,380
Speaker 1: Because we don't say that.

564
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,879
Speaker 1: And now we've had how many?

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,080
Speaker 1: It's October something.

566
00:26:55,843 --> 00:26:56,319
Speaker 0: That's fine.

567
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,600
Speaker 1: You can kind of tell by the audio quality, I guess.

568
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:01,460
Speaker 0: I don't think it's a problem.

569
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:02,539
Speaker 1: It might be.

570
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,040
Speaker 1: We're like, yeah, we're going to be at Otacon next weekend.

571
00:27:06,144 --> 00:27:07,319
Speaker 1: We're doing these panels.

572
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,859
Speaker 0: Anyone, you know, we say we're going to be at Otacon next weekend and someone goes, doesn't go to the Otacon website.

573
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,879
Speaker 0: They deserve what they get.

574
00:27:16,462 --> 00:27:19,660
Speaker 1: Oh, there's some funny, this is total inside baseball.

575
00:27:20,024 --> 00:27:21,299
Speaker 1: I haven't told Scott yet.

576
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,540
Speaker 1: I was talking to Daryl Surratt and he pointed out something funny in the Otacon forum.

577
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,598
Speaker 0: He pointed out to me.

578
00:27:26,285 --> 00:27:27,237
Speaker 1: Oh, well then I'll leave it at that.

579
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:27,997
Speaker 0: All right.

580
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:29,600
Speaker 1: So boggle boggle.

581
00:27:30,502 --> 00:27:30,818
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

582
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,620
Speaker 0: So, you know, I was thinking about the game boggle.

583
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:34,800
Speaker 0: Cause I saw it somewhere.

584
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,798
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no.

585
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:42,259
Speaker 1: We basically, you were like, we had the boggle boggle episode and we needed something, you know, we needed something to rhyme.

586
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,639
Speaker 1: And I was like boggle boggle.

587
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,380
Speaker 0: Is that a remember?

588
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,451
Speaker 1: That's how we decided.

589
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,039
Speaker 1: I have the chat.

590
00:27:47,221 --> 00:27:49,340
Speaker 1: I can pull up the transcript of the conversation.

591
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:51,519
Speaker 0: I did see a game of boggle recently though.

592
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:54,280
Speaker 1: Are you sure that wasn't confirmation bias?

593
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,877
Speaker 1: Because if it wasn't, then you know what it is.

594
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,340
Speaker 0: Confirmation unbiased.

595
00:27:58,980 --> 00:27:59,338
Speaker 1: Synchronicity.

596
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:08,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, so boggle, it's a game where you take a bunch of cubes, they have letters on them and you shake up the cubes inside a little plastic box.

597
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:18,300
Speaker 0: And then you take the lid off and you've got a grid of letters and you try to find as many words by, you know, that are made up of adjacent letters as you can before the timer runs out.

598
00:28:19,342 --> 00:28:19,554
Speaker 1: Adjacent.

599
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,280
Speaker 0: Uh, no, I thought you could also go diagonally.

600
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,380
Speaker 1: I always played orthogonal.

601
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,199
Speaker 0: I thought diagonal was also an option.

602
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,118
Speaker 1: If it was then.

603
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:37,100
Speaker 1: Anyway, I only ever played boggle like a handful of times when I was a little kid because my grandma had it laying around her house and my brother and I would find it, play it for like a little while, get bored and then move on to other things.

604
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:48,400
Speaker 0: I kind of like boggle better than a word search, like a straight up word search on paper that you buy in a book because you know, the word searches that are done on paper because they crafted by a human.

605
00:28:48,942 --> 00:28:51,454
Speaker 0: You know, there's sort of, I think some of them are automated.

606
00:28:51,494 --> 00:28:54,360
Speaker 0: now, but you know, the old ones used to be hand human made.

607
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,440
Speaker 0: You can sort of like figure them out.

608
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,809
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh, there's obviously a word.

609
00:28:57,829 --> 00:28:59,260
Speaker 0: there is obviously a word there.

610
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:13,160
Speaker 1: Now, now, now when I was in middle school, a lot of times if there's a substitute teacher or like in, you know, crappy teachers, they'd, they'd have an assignment like make a word search with the 10 like bro cab terms from whatever and then trade them with other people.

611
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:22,860
Speaker 1: I would basically make mine consists of nothing but all of the words mixed up, spelled slightly incorrectly and have no correct spellings anywhere.

612
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,980
Speaker 1: So what I would always do if you're going to point that out, I would make it legit.

613
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,059
Speaker 1: There were, they were all in there except one.

614
00:29:29,722 --> 00:29:31,639
Speaker 1: I'd always leave one out because I'm a Dick.

615
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:37,620
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, boggle is like, it's not a fancy game.

616
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,580
Speaker 0: It's not a hard, really hard game.

617
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,299
Speaker 1: It's barely a multiplayer game.

618
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,680
Speaker 1: At best it's multiplayer in the same way.

619
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,580
Speaker 1: That's a racing game in the same way that how long does it take you to run a mile?

620
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,959
Speaker 1: It takes me this long to run a mile.

621
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:55,040
Speaker 0: I guess I win, but you know, it is actually sort of a quality for what it is is quality, right?

622
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,620
Speaker 0: You actually need a big vocabulary.

623
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,740
Speaker 0: You got to have quick eyeball searching skills.

624
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:05,619
Speaker 0: You know, you got to, you know, it's actually a skill based game and the best person does win unless you cheat.

625
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:15,000
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it primarily, I mean, I guess if we're going to have a moral to this episode, it's that games that appear on the surface to be very similar actually test very different skills.

626
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:15,820
Speaker 1: If you don't pay attention.

627
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,480
Speaker 1: That's absolutely true, which is true of all gaming.

628
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

629
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,300
Speaker 0: Boggles boggles prime.

630
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:27,080
Speaker 0: You know, boggle test vocabulary, but primarily it tests, you know, quick looking Final Fantasy tests patients.

631
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,839
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft test boredom.

632
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:37,980
Speaker 1: I think they both test patients, but boggle really is just, you know, do you have good?

633
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,197
Speaker 1: Are you not dyslexic?

634
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:43,780
Speaker 1: And do you have a large vocabulary of like three to five letter words?

635
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,435
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, sometimes you can find really big words and boggling.

636
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:51,500
Speaker 1: pretty rarely, though, because of the statistical, like the way the dice would fall.

637
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,980
Speaker 0: That is one thing is that each die only has six letters on it.

638
00:30:55,481 --> 00:30:59,540
Speaker 0: And so you're not really going to get a whole bunch of alphabet every time.

639
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:06,459
Speaker 0: It would be cooler if you had a boggle where each die was actually a 26 cider, you know, and that way you never knew what was going to show up.

640
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:12,579
Speaker 1: Not only is that not a perfect shape, but there's basically unless you made it just a cylinder, you just digitize it.

641
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:13,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could.

642
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:14,400
Speaker 1: And it's digital online.

643
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:14,899
Speaker 1: And you know what?

644
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,980
Speaker 1: It looks like it emulates the original physical game.

645
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:17,458
Speaker 1: Really?

646
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,445
Speaker 1: The one I found is

647
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:29,560
Speaker 0: the thing is, well, the reason that you need to emulate the region that they did that in the original game is not only because the physical limitations of dice to fit into the slots, but because that way you can get a nice mix of vowels and common consonants.

648
00:31:29,923 --> 00:31:31,699
Speaker 0: So you can actually get some words every time.

649
00:31:32,021 --> 00:31:41,439
Speaker 0: If you did exactly if you did 26, you know, ciders, then it's possible you get a fuck ton of cues and nothing to do with them and unplayable boggle figure.

650
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,039
Speaker 1: Random aside, do you know what?

651
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,720
Speaker 1: There are test symbols in the stock market that are not real, but have real market data.

652
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:47,514
Speaker 0: OK.

653
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:48,813
Speaker 1: And one of them is ZVZT.

654
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:50,134
Speaker 0: OK.

655
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:53,715
Speaker 0: So can I buy some ZVZT?

656
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,200
Speaker 1: If you had an account that would let you.

657
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:57,838
Speaker 1: Yes, you could.

658
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:01,140
Speaker 0: And would I would actually be worth anything now so I can buy it for zero?

659
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:01,558
Speaker 0: Yes.

660
00:32:01,741 --> 00:32:05,800
Speaker 0: I can just send in a thing that says I want to buy all this and it would just happen.

661
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,440
Speaker 1: It's a little more complicated than that because there's no limit on ZVZT.

662
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,400
Speaker 0: Can I buy all the boggle?

663
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,380
Speaker 1: But I'd say boggle is really just a primitive form of more modern games like bookworm.

664
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,320
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, bookworm adventures is pretty much boggle plus worms.

665
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,840
Speaker 1: I really liked bookworm.

666
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,200
Speaker 1: I played a fuck ton.

667
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,238
Speaker 0: Well, there were different ones.

668
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,119
Speaker 0: There was the there was the straight up original, but then there was the adventure questing one where you actually fought monsters.

669
00:32:31,445 --> 00:32:32,139
Speaker 1: I didn't play that.

670
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:39,940
Speaker 0: Basically, what you would do is you would the worm would go up to a monster and you'd have to get enough words and big enough ones to kill the monster without getting hurt.

671
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,459
Speaker 0: And then you would move on a little bit more.

672
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,618
Speaker 1: So it's like typing of the dead.

673
00:32:43,765 --> 00:32:44,117
Speaker 0: Sort of.

674
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

675
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:45,379
Speaker 0: But it's bookworm of the dead.

676
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:47,020
Speaker 0: And, you know, there are levels.

677
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,799
Speaker 0: There was experience and levels and leveling up and that sort of thing.

678
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:53,020
Speaker 0: But it was sort of tacked on like puzzle quest.

679
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,640
Speaker 0: You know, it wasn't the core.

680
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,719
Speaker 1: People have made games like that.

681
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,920
Speaker 1: It's a neat concept, though.

682
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,480
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people have fantasized.

683
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,440
Speaker 1: Like I play involved battle balls, right?

684
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:00,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

685
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,759
Speaker 1: Imagine if battle balls was just battle balls.

686
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:11,260
Speaker 1: But at the top was some like the dragon and the Mount Fuji were having this wicked, epic Pokemon looking fight that was choreographed based on how well you were doing.

687
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,278
Speaker 0: And that's what Henry Hasserith was supposed to be.

688
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,952
Speaker 0: That wasn't.

689
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:19,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, but yeah, I actually think Boggle is a good game.

690
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,200
Speaker 0: It's a good game to have.

691
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:28,450
Speaker 0: If you know, if you want to whip something out really quickly and you're a very wordy kind of, you know, linguistic, lingual file kind of person, you know, Boggle is a good one.

692
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,180
Speaker 0: It's small.

693
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,780
Speaker 0: It's portable.

694
00:33:29,922 --> 00:33:31,080
Speaker 0: I think they even have travel Boggle.

695
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:33,298
Speaker 0: And it's actually a game of skill.

696
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:44,732
Speaker 1: It's also a good game to make your friends feel really stupid, especially if you've practiced, because if you break it open and figure out what's on all the dice, there are certain words that are very likely to be there and words that

697
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:49,920
Speaker 0: are also words that people that are likely to be there that are words that people are unlikely to know.

698
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:50,499
Speaker 1: Yeah.

699
00:33:50,723 --> 00:33:51,939
Speaker 0: And you could be like, yes, a word.

700
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,215
Speaker 0: And then what you do is you just write your words down on paper while you're playing the game.

701
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,960
Speaker 0: And at the very end, because of the timer, you can't dispute while the timer's running.

702
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:00,799
Speaker 0: You could dispute after you're done.

703
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,059
Speaker 0: And then someone would be like, that word doesn't count.

704
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,605
Speaker 0: And then you get.

705
00:34:03,706 --> 00:34:04,880
Speaker 0: then you get the dictionary out.

706
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:05,220
Speaker 0: Right.

707
00:34:05,681 --> 00:34:11,739
Speaker 0: And actually, that's what I kind of like about Boggle is that any challenges or anything weird like that only matter at the end when you have time.

708
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,539
Speaker 0: And it's not a pain in the ass to figure them out.

709
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:21,719
Speaker 1: Unlike I don't mind Scrabble and the way it does it, because the Scrabble, it's more like the challenge in football or something like, do I challenge it or not?

710
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,598
Speaker 1: I have to make a call.

711
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:23,638
Speaker 0: I like that.

712
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:32,239
Speaker 0: But, you know, it still interrupts the game in Scrabble, which is I don't like the penalties not big enough for getting caught and the reward for catching someone is not big enough.

713
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,000
Speaker 0: That's true.

714
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:37,320
Speaker 1: And in fact, it should be like you get punched in the face and you have to give up a foul.

715
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,760
Speaker 0: I mean, look at football, right?

716
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,020
Speaker 0: In football, if you challenge and you're correct, you just win.

717
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,320
Speaker 0: You get your challenge, right?

718
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,900
Speaker 0: If you're challenging, you're false.

719
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,239
Speaker 0: You lose a time out in Scrabble.

720
00:34:47,822 --> 00:34:50,018
Speaker 0: If you challenge falsely, don't you lose a turn?

721
00:34:50,762 --> 00:34:50,911
Speaker 0: Right.

722
00:34:51,141 --> 00:34:52,119
Speaker 0: That's a huge penalty.

723
00:34:52,621 --> 00:34:55,480
Speaker 1: Not near the end of the game where you don't have any you don't have shit to play anyway.

724
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:56,359
Speaker 0: That's true.

725
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:05,399
Speaker 0: But if you challenge and you're if you get challenged, all that happens is you take your tiles off the board and you lose the turn.

726
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,499
Speaker 1: Are you sure that's all that happens?

727
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:07,172
Speaker 0: I don't know.

728
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:08,820
Speaker 0: That's what I remember.

729
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,880
Speaker 0: It might not be correct.

730
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:10,818
Speaker 0: Someone can correct me.

731
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,260
Speaker 1: I mean, it might be a situation like Monopoly where fucking no one knows how Monopoly is actually played.

732
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,540
Speaker 0: The penalty for challenging needs to be less than the penalty for actually getting successfully challenged.

733
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,379
Speaker 1: I think the penalty should be pretty high, but the penalty for being caught should be even higher.

734
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,320
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

735
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:32,520
Speaker 0: The penalty for fucking up and getting caught should be a lot worse than the penalty for challenging falsely.

736
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,839
Speaker 0: That way, because otherwise people are going to hesitate to challenge when they should.

737
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:38,839
Speaker 1: So Scrabble hint.

738
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,376
Speaker 1: Pro tip.

739
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:43,120
Speaker 1: If you want to win at Scrabble, trick all of your friends.

740
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,900
Speaker 1: Be like, yeah, let's use the OED, the Oxford English Dictionary on a bridge.

741
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:49,060
Speaker 1: And they'll probably be like, yeah, whatever.

742
00:35:49,161 --> 00:35:50,620
Speaker 1: We don't care what dictionary we'll just play.

743
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,160
Speaker 1: And then just fucking make words up.

744
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,379
Speaker 1: Odds are they're in there.

745
00:35:54,801 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I used L-A-Z-E-R and I was like, I was like, I looked up and it was like, you know, it was like archaic something, something.

746
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,139
Speaker 1: It was Lazar.

747
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,080
Speaker 1: And then Lazar was an archaic form of Lazar.

748
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,080
Speaker 1: And I forget the definition, but it's got to just spell those.

749
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,380
Speaker 0: There's no way that those are in the Scrabble dictionary.

750
00:36:12,781 --> 00:36:18,440
Speaker 0: They're only in the OED because it's got every fucking word and every root of every English word imaginable.

751
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:18,668
Speaker 0: Yeah.

752
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,040
Speaker 0: But also you just write any old thing in there and you'll you'll get a point.

753
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,200
Speaker 1: You want to win at Scrabble.

754
00:36:23,461 --> 00:36:27,288
Speaker 1: You've pretty much got a big vocabulary, but everyone assumes that's the only thing you need.

755
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,100
Speaker 0: That is actually the least important skill.

756
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,920
Speaker 0: You need to memorize these very specific two letter words for Scrabble.

757
00:36:33,222 --> 00:36:34,339
Speaker 1: Not every two letter word.

758
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,780
Speaker 1: There's only twenty six times twenty six and most of those aren't even words.

759
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:39,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

760
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,080
Speaker 0: You know, you have to memorize all of the two letter words and then you can win.

761
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:45,360
Speaker 0: You'll have to be way better at Scrabble than anybody.

762
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,999
Speaker 1: All the two letter words, if you can.

763
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,399
Speaker 1: Pretty much every weird three letter word.

764
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:54,880
Speaker 0: And every word that has like you, you know, because there's a lot of them, like you, you eat, right?

765
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,456
Speaker 0: Is not a word.

766
00:36:55,844 --> 00:36:56,920
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of crazy.

767
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,600
Speaker 1: Well, that's the word in Spanish.

768
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,080
Speaker 1: Yeah.

769
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:05,399
Speaker 0: But I mean, there's all sorts of crazy things that are words that you wouldn't realize are words, you know, that you can score big points on.

770
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:12,260
Speaker 0: And because they're not a word that people use every day, most people would never even use them in Scrabble unless they're Scrabble players.

771
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:19,659
Speaker 0: And that's what bothers me is that Boggle is actually a game of mostly your actual vocabulary because it's all about speed.

772
00:37:20,561 --> 00:37:24,400
Speaker 0: So you can't do a two letter word in Boggle, I don't think.

773
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:30,800
Speaker 0: But Scrabble isn't about just your regular old everyday vocabulary and how big it is.

774
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:33,060
Speaker 0: It's also and there's no timer either.

775
00:37:33,601 --> 00:37:37,920
Speaker 0: It's mostly about did you memorize these specific Scrabble things?

776
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:42,919
Speaker 0: So it's like even if you're better at vocabulary, you might lose to someone who's just better at Scrabble.

777
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,660
Speaker 1: Now, to be fair, a lot of games are like that.

778
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:53,500
Speaker 1: Even if someone's really smart, if I've just played Puerto Rico a shit ton more than them, I am much more likely to win Puerto Rico because I know Puerto Rico specific things.

779
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Speaker 0: That's true.

780
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,960
Speaker 1: But Scrabble, I guess, just tricks a lot of people who think like I used to think I never played Scrabble.

781
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,540
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, I have an awesome vocabulary.

782
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,720
Speaker 1: I'll fucking rock this game.

783
00:38:02,163 --> 00:38:03,819
Speaker 1: And instead of rocking, I got wrecked.

784
00:38:04,602 --> 00:38:07,120
Speaker 1: I mean, neither one of those words on the triple word score.

785
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:12,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's a general problem when you have a game of knowledge versus a game of skill.

786
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,640
Speaker 1: Scrabble, there's some decisions to be made, but isn't a vocabulary game by definition, a game of skill or game of knowledge.

787
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,258
Speaker 1: How many words do you know?

788
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,460
Speaker 0: Well, no, because in Boggle has the skill of quickly recognizing them because the timer is involved.

789
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:27,520
Speaker 1: I think knowing the words is equally important.

790
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,100
Speaker 0: It is equally important, but there is a skill factor.

791
00:38:30,221 --> 00:38:33,620
Speaker 0: But, you know, Scrabble is just mostly knowledge.

792
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,420
Speaker 0: It's like 90 percent knowledge, 10 percent skill of picking the right spots.

793
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,438
Speaker 1: But see, I wanted it.

794
00:38:39,223 --> 00:38:45,180
Speaker 1: I guess my my assumption when I first played Scrabble as a kid was I assumed that it was testing just knowledge.

795
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,660
Speaker 1: How great is your vocabulary?

796
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got wrecked because it tested these other skills I didn't think about.

797
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, back then I thought Monopoly was a good game.

798
00:38:53,961 --> 00:39:02,220
Speaker 0: The other thing about Scrabble is that it does have a luck factor, which, you know, you don't you don't think is significant because there's so many tiles in the bag and you keep drawing.

799
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,140
Speaker 0: But it's actually pretty significant.

800
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:10,399
Speaker 0: Someone always gets screwed with useless letters and someone else always gets a really good word and it's just complete luck.

801
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,999
Speaker 0: Whereas in Boggle, you're all looking at the same thing.

802
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:18,699
Speaker 0: So you could you know, you have equal chances of winning, which I think is actually makes a little bit more fair.

803
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,100
Speaker 1: Scrabble also has the the mechanics of the board itself, and you've got the strategy of blocking or building out.

804
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,184
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's so.

805
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:31,139
Speaker 0: it's so obvious because the only thing you have to you basically do whatever move you can find that gets you the most points.

806
00:39:31,683 --> 00:39:33,675
Speaker 0: And the only thing is, well, you go in order.

807
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,300
Speaker 1: Only question is the same strategy as Carcassonne.

808
00:39:37,701 --> 00:39:39,580
Speaker 1: First, do the most for yourself.

809
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:45,680
Speaker 1: If you cannot do enough for yourself for it to matter, go down a notch and hurt someone else as much as you can.

810
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,500
Speaker 0: You can't really hurt someone else in Scrabble.

811
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,460
Speaker 0: What you can do is you can look at their tiles and figure out what you can look at their tiles unless you're cheating.

812
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,100
Speaker 0: But you can go into the spot that's the easiest to go to make it hard for anyone else to go.

813
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:08,180
Speaker 0: And you can also say, oh, this move is three points less than that move, but it makes it really hard for anyone to use that triple word score, which it will otherwise be made available.

814
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:14,339
Speaker 0: So I'll do that to, you know, make it harder for other players rather than, oh, man, this move gets me a ton of points.

815
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:14,979
Speaker 0: But you know what?

816
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,980
Speaker 0: It puts this E right out there where anyone can get a triple word score way easy.

817
00:40:19,101 --> 00:40:21,420
Speaker 0: So it actually adds up to less points in total for me.

818
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,760
Speaker 1: You know, left right actually matters a lot in Scrabble, too.

819
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:25,360
Speaker 1: It does.

820
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,800
Speaker 0: Going first, you get the double word score right at the beginning.

821
00:40:28,282 --> 00:40:30,120
Speaker 1: You know, that's not a double word score.

822
00:40:30,181 --> 00:40:30,858
Speaker 1: That's just a star.

823
00:40:31,224 --> 00:40:32,260
Speaker 0: No, that's double word score.

824
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

825
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:34,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is colored the same.

826
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,699
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to count it like that.

827
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,820
Speaker 0: Actually, you are really.

828
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:38,599
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure you are.

829
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,399
Speaker 1: Let's look it up right now.

830
00:40:48,442 --> 00:40:52,400
Speaker 1: A player begins the game by placing a word on the star square at the center of the board.

831
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,180
Speaker 1: The star square acts as a double word score.

832
00:40:55,541 --> 00:41:00,460
Speaker 1: I said the star square does not act as a double word score for subsequent players.

833
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:01,079
Speaker 1: So you were right.

834
00:41:01,364 --> 00:41:02,319
Speaker 0: Yes, that's correct.

835
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,500
Speaker 0: Whoever goes first gets a free double word score.

836
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:08,319
Speaker 0: And then it's really hard to get a double word score immediately off of that.

837
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:11,359
Speaker 0: So and it's like a two player game.

838
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,460
Speaker 0: Then that's in a four player game.

839
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:16,380
Speaker 0: It actually sort of balances out, but not in a two player game.

840
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:20,499
Speaker 0: Going first is a pretty good advantage, depending on the tiles you initially draw to.

841
00:41:21,122 --> 00:41:27,870
Speaker 0: If you initially draw shit tiles that could actually screw you because your first word will be like at or something like that, you know.

842
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:40,989
Speaker 1: Honestly, though, Scrabble aside, I mean, everyone knows Scrabble, but a lot of my favorite games in the genre of knowledge and words and that sort of stuff, I guess not just knowledge, because that would also include like Trivial Pursuit and all that BS.

843
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:41,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like that.

844
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:45,590
Speaker 1: We should do a show on that at some point, but that's way out of the scope of this.

845
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:46,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're looking at word games here.

846
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,890
Speaker 1: We got some obscure or at least relatively obscure games of that ilk that I don't think many of you have played that you can get a hold of.

847
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,209
Speaker 1: They're actually pretty fun, like like Probe.

848
00:41:55,591 --> 00:42:00,609
Speaker 0: Well, Probe is this game that like my grandma had in the closet that like my mom had when she was a kid.

849
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,570
Speaker 1: And basically your grandma probed you in the closet.

850
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:03,655
Speaker 0: It's a really.

851
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:06,290
Speaker 0: it's a probe is great for making jokes about probes.

852
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,910
Speaker 0: It's this really old game that I don't think has been reprinted in forever.

853
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:13,430
Speaker 0: And what it is, it's versus Hangman.

854
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:13,701
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:16,610
Speaker 0: So you make a word and you added these cards.

856
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:24,629
Speaker 0: You have a deck of cards with the alphabet in it and you make a word in a little tray and you have to get other people's words one letter at a time.

857
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:25,769
Speaker 0: Like Hangman.

858
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:31,890
Speaker 0: And you can actually use these different blank cards to trick people into thinking your word.

859
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:32,770
Speaker 1: That's the best mechanic.

860
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,410
Speaker 0: The word is longer or shorter.

861
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,190
Speaker 1: So say my word is anal.

862
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:42,190
Speaker 1: OK, I could put up to two of these blanks either in front of or behind my word.

863
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:42,339
Speaker 0: Yep.

864
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:49,430
Speaker 0: So you put one letter and you put one blank in front and people say banal and you go fail or they can get you.

865
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,829
Speaker 1: They can you know, they're trying to figure out your word and they're like, hey, and they see the A and they're not quite sure what it is.

866
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:57,610
Speaker 1: Or they can guess you got a blank and they can get you that way.

867
00:42:57,671 --> 00:42:59,309
Speaker 1: But then you only have to reveal one of your blanks.

868
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,199
Speaker 0: Yep, it's very.

869
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:02,490
Speaker 0: I like probe a lot.

870
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,205
Speaker 0: And I think that.

871
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:09,609
Speaker 0: OK, I think it's really good for making jokes.

872
00:43:10,074 --> 00:43:10,286
Speaker 1: It is.

873
00:43:10,752 --> 00:43:13,490
Speaker 1: It was published in 1964.

874
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,069
Speaker 0: God damn.

875
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,869
Speaker 1: We actually played this a lot at RIT.

876
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,310
Speaker 0: I don't think we played it that much.

877
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:18,567
Speaker 1: We did.

878
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,229
Speaker 1: There was that one.

879
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:23,370
Speaker 1: It was but it was around after tribes kind of died in colony.

880
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:29,470
Speaker 1: Remember, we'd all go into separate rooms and sit on dictionary sites for like 10 minutes coming up with the craziest fucking.

881
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did that like a couple of times.

882
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,769
Speaker 0: Not a lot.

883
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:34,323
Speaker 1: We played it a lot for a while, but then we stopped.

884
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:37,850
Speaker 1: like we played it a lot for like this three week span and then we stopped playing it.

885
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:38,749
Speaker 1: Never really played it again.

886
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still have it.

887
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:40,450
Speaker 0: It's in my apartment.

888
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,529
Speaker 0: We should we should play it.

889
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:45,210
Speaker 0: We can definitely play it if anyone else out there wants to.

890
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:49,290
Speaker 0: I'm sure you can find the rules on the Internet pretty easily and you know, to make it yourself.

891
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:51,178
Speaker 0: I mean, you don't really need.

892
00:43:51,259 --> 00:43:53,790
Speaker 0: you can just take pieces of paper and make this game.

893
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,350
Speaker 1: Why don't we just make this digitally?

894
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,890
Speaker 1: It's a game mechanics or fair game.

895
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:58,869
Speaker 0: It's trivial.

896
00:43:59,712 --> 00:44:00,950
Speaker 0: It's so easy to make this game.

897
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:02,150
Speaker 0: It's just versus hangman.

898
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:03,910
Speaker 1: I got to code a bunch of Java shit at work.

899
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,870
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll and what you do is maybe I'll write this just to remember Java.

900
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,950
Speaker 0: All you really need to know is the scoring mechanism.

901
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,170
Speaker 0: And you could probably come up with a better scoring mechanism than the official one.

902
00:44:13,052 --> 00:44:13,370
Speaker 0: Probably.

903
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,141
Speaker 1: Probably.

904
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,230
Speaker 0: And then you just play multiple rounds and see what's the best score.

905
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:19,130
Speaker 0: It's good, though, with four players, right?

906
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,130
Speaker 0: Because you have to guess against a person you can't just guess all about.

907
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,550
Speaker 1: Well, only one person on board game geek is a fan of this game.

908
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:31,268
Speaker 0: I think it'll be actually better than to do versus Wheel of Fortune than to do versus pro.

909
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:33,269
Speaker 1: You know what I've got laying around?

910
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,630
Speaker 1: I've got a board game version of Wheel of Fortune.

911
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's also board game Jeopardy, which I've played back in the past.

912
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:41,410
Speaker 0: I prefer video game Wheel of Fortune.

913
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:46,390
Speaker 0: The only thing the only problem with video game Wheel of Fortune is that they all have the built in puzzles and you memorize them all.

914
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,449
Speaker 0: You need to actually get one that we can load up.

915
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,150
Speaker 1: Mine came with a lot of puzzles and an incredibly surprisingly complex mechanism.

916
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing with board game Wheel of Fortune is that it's sort of like Clue where you have to close your eyes and you put the puzzle in.

917
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,550
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you can't play because you just saw the puzzle.

918
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,330
Speaker 0: And, you know, anyone can just look through the puzzles.

919
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:06,008
Speaker 1: And then, you know, we should start playing again.

920
00:45:06,551 --> 00:45:08,290
Speaker 1: SNES and NES Family Feud.

921
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,410
Speaker 0: That's like the best.

922
00:45:10,991 --> 00:45:18,970
Speaker 1: There's something about the like Nintendo versions of Family Feud because they're broken enough and difficult enough to try to guess what the thing's going after.

923
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,130
Speaker 0: I had Junior Jeopardy on the NES, which actually I got pretty good at.

924
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:37,948
Speaker 1: They also because you remember also for the fact that like when you're playing Family Feud, not only is it a busted ass NES game, you're trying to like type in the word on the NES, but it's from a culture that existed in the late 80s.

925
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:43,450
Speaker 0: I mean, the other thing the only other good thing about the video game versions of the game shows is the buzzers, right?

926
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:51,470
Speaker 0: Because I remember playing board game Jeopardy and you had a clicker and you just click it and it would be like judgment call who click first.

927
00:45:52,091 --> 00:45:54,270
Speaker 0: Whereas if you had the buzzer on the NES, you just push the A button.

928
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:55,550
Speaker 1: See, I had an advantage in high school.

929
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,430
Speaker 1: I got into Quiz Bowl.

930
00:45:56,691 --> 00:45:57,369
Speaker 0: You had a turbo button?

931
00:45:57,771 --> 00:46:03,908
Speaker 1: So no, whenever I would like want to play a game like that at home, I just borrow one of the Quiz Bowl boxes.

932
00:46:04,355 --> 00:46:04,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

933
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:05,489
Speaker 1: I just take it home.

934
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,569
Speaker 1: We had, you know, eight buzzers, four per team.

935
00:46:08,273 --> 00:46:09,750
Speaker 1: And it showed which team, which person.

936
00:46:09,872 --> 00:46:10,709
Speaker 1: It was actually pretty good.

937
00:46:10,933 --> 00:46:12,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good thing to have.

938
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,409
Speaker 0: You can make one of those in Arduino real easily.

939
00:46:17,091 --> 00:46:17,428
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

940
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:21,289
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Probe is definitely a good one that people have not heard of.

941
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,729
Speaker 0: And, you know, versus Hangman is not something people think of, even though everyone's played fricking Hangman.

942
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,070
Speaker 1: No, we played this game Probe about as long as we played Mahjong.

943
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:31,410
Speaker 1: Like it was that length of infatuation.

944
00:46:31,712 --> 00:46:32,389
Speaker 0: I think it was less.

945
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,270
Speaker 1: No, we didn't play Mahjong that long.

946
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:35,770
Speaker 1: We got sick of Mahjong by quick.

947
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:37,549
Speaker 1: That was like three weeks.

948
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,130
Speaker 0: The thing is, it's weird.

949
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,576
Speaker 0: It's like Jewish Lady.

950
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:45,810
Speaker 0: Mahjong is probably a worse game, but it's actually sort of a better game at the same time, right?

951
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,490
Speaker 0: Because it's got this betting factor, but the game itself is kind of weird.

952
00:46:49,911 --> 00:46:54,670
Speaker 0: But then actual Chinese Mahjong is just fucking gin rummy with a little bit extra on there.

953
00:46:55,432 --> 00:46:58,329
Speaker 0: And so it's actually, you know, it's completely almost luck.

954
00:46:59,952 --> 00:47:02,028
Speaker 1: It's slightly better of a game than Michigan rummy.

955
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:02,393
Speaker 0: Yeah.

956
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,249
Speaker 0: Michigan rummy isn't much of a game at all.

957
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:04,685
Speaker 1: Really?

958
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:05,510
Speaker 1: It's not a game.

959
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,150
Speaker 0: But Michigan rummy is a good sort of party thing because you get the bowls with the chips and you do all this weird stuff.

960
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,390
Speaker 1: Most people only know Michigan running a good ritual.

961
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:13,949
Speaker 1: I think they only know it through Tripoli.

962
00:47:14,937 --> 00:47:15,590
Speaker 0: I never played Tripoli.

963
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:16,409
Speaker 1: Never played Tripoli.

964
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:16,698
Speaker 1: No.

965
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:21,250
Speaker 1: Tripoli was actually a really fucking dumb game, but it's really popular.

966
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,490
Speaker 0: Was it a word game?

967
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:25,590
Speaker 1: Tripoli was three card games that you play.

968
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:37,889
Speaker 1: Like first, I forget the order, but you play some card game and then with the same cards you play Michigan rummy and then in the end you do like a poker hand showdown and then you have chips for like all three parts.

969
00:47:38,032 --> 00:47:38,889
Speaker 1: It's dumb as shit.

970
00:47:39,253 --> 00:47:39,347
Speaker 0: Okay.

971
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,550
Speaker 0: But yeah, the other word game that I want to talk about that a lot of people haven't played is Upwords, which is Scrabble.

972
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:48,049
Speaker 0: Except you can stack out of Upwords.

973
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,470
Speaker 0: I played it only a little bit because I didn't have it.

974
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,669
Speaker 1: I was really good at Upwords.

975
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:52,066
Speaker 0: Yeah.

976
00:47:52,090 --> 00:48:06,850
Speaker 0: I mean, it's basically Scrabble, but you can stack the letters, which I think actually made it sort of better because, uh, you know, a lot of times in Scrabble you might have a great word and nowhere to put it, but in Upwords you could be like, Hey, I found a place to put it only if that E was actually an S instead.

977
00:48:06,951 --> 00:48:07,848
Speaker 0: And you're like, Oh, there we go.

978
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:08,629
Speaker 0: All good.

979
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:17,327
Speaker 0: It did have you get a lot more creative and you know that the fact that you could stack both increase the skill because you had to, you know, when you stack.

980
00:48:17,387 --> 00:48:23,449
Speaker 0: the other word that you were stacking on top of still had to make sense, but at the same time you had a lot more options available to you.

981
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,048
Speaker 0: So you could always, you could usually get a big word out there instead of always having to resort to a little word.

982
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:30,550
Speaker 1: Of course it had some fiddly bits.

983
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:36,530
Speaker 1: I mean, I think there's a limit on like stacking up to five because otherwise you're like put pot, put pot, pet, put pot, put.

984
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:43,830
Speaker 0: And then, yeah, I mean, if I was playing, if I wrote the game of Upwords, I would say, you know, no two like letters could be stacked in the same spot.

985
00:48:44,252 --> 00:48:46,150
Speaker 1: So I'm looking at the board game geek for that.

986
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:50,289
Speaker 1: It's actually rated on similarly to, uh, bro, but many more people have rated it.

987
00:48:51,414 --> 00:48:53,150
Speaker 1: It has a language dependence warning.

988
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,290
Speaker 1: Unplayable in other languages.

989
00:48:56,690 --> 00:48:56,775
Speaker 0: Yeah.

990
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,128
Speaker 0: I try to play in Chinese.

991
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:01,630
Speaker 0: Yeah.

992
00:49:02,174 --> 00:49:04,490
Speaker 0: Actually, that is kind of interesting to think about that, right?

993
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:09,670
Speaker 0: There's all these games that are games of alphabets, but they only work because we have the English alphabet.

994
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:13,010
Speaker 1: Well, many languages use a similar alphabet or the same.

995
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,289
Speaker 0: I'm sure anyone had a Roman alphabet, but I mean, would it work in Cyrillic?

996
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:20,650
Speaker 1: Uh, probably just, you have to make Cyrillic tiles.

997
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,970
Speaker 0: That'd be, you know, I mean, there is elite Scrabble tile bag you can buy.

998
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:24,489
Speaker 0: Yeah.

999
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:25,810
Speaker 0: I always wanted to buy that.

1000
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,230
Speaker 0: Maybe I should.

1001
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,950
Speaker 1: I wonder if there's a Japanese equivalent of games like Scrabble.

1002
00:49:29,573 --> 00:49:33,109
Speaker 0: I do also wonder if there is, that'd be very interesting to see.

1003
00:49:33,575 --> 00:49:33,806
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1004
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:34,970
Speaker 0: Japanese Scrabble.

1005
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,810
Speaker 0: Cause it's Scrabble definitely seems like such an American thing.

1006
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:38,448
Speaker 0: It does.

1007
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:43,250
Speaker 1: I mean, they're, I mean, they're both like Hasbro, Milton Bradley kind of game.

1008
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:43,909
Speaker 0: I'd be interested.

1009
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:49,309
Speaker 0: I'd be very amazed if the history of Scrabble was that it was came from somewhere besides the United States.

1010
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,690
Speaker 1: I could have come from Britain, but it doesn't feel like it.

1011
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:53,650
Speaker 0: I don't, I don't.

1012
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:54,870
Speaker 0: I think that's very unlikely.

1013
00:49:55,171 --> 00:49:58,910
Speaker 1: It feels so much like one of those, like Americana games, like uncle Wiggly.

1014
00:49:59,332 --> 00:50:01,230
Speaker 0: And it's weird because on the one hand, right.

1015
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:08,549
Speaker 0: You'll have like regular, it's like a game that can regular old people will be like either into it or not into it.

1016
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,649
Speaker 0: But also really smart people will be into it or not into it.

1017
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:14,050
Speaker 0: You know, like people are super board game.

1018
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:19,370
Speaker 0: People might not like it, but people who are super smart, but not board game people might really love Scrabble.

1019
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:31,228
Speaker 0: So in 1938, architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation of an earlier game he invented called Lexico.

1020
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:32,284
Speaker 0: Lexico.

1021
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,109
Speaker 0: I want to play a Lexico.

1022
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,230
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1023
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:38,829
Speaker 0: Lexico sounds like a robot that lives in the Futurama world.

1024
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:46,590
Speaker 1: But basically the game that we know as Scrabble today came from, uh, James Brunot, not, but who was from Newtown, Connecticut.

1025
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:47,368
Speaker 0: There you go.

1026
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:48,150
Speaker 0: Wow.

1027
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:48,607
Speaker 0: That's close.

1028
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:49,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1029
00:50:49,351 --> 00:50:50,180
Speaker 0: Real close to what?

1030
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:51,901
Speaker 0: I've been there.

1031
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:53,989
Speaker 0: Geographically close.

1032
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:54,969
Speaker 1: I've been to a lot of places.

1033
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,449
Speaker 1: I mean, the land bridge, you know, Jersey is close.

1034
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:02,190
Speaker 0: Anyway, do we have anything else to say about wordy games?

1035
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:05,550
Speaker 0: I mean, do you want to talk about, uh, like cryptograms or anything stupid like that?

1036
00:51:06,154 --> 00:51:06,450
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1037
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:14,310
Speaker 1: I, I like games like this, but at the same time I hate them because as a gamer who's played German board games now, I look at these games.

1038
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:14,930
Speaker 1: I'm like, really?

1039
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,489
Speaker 1: I'm going to play this.

1040
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,230
Speaker 1: I'm going to just show off my vocabulary Wang.

1041
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:20,070
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1042
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,649
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the thing is I have this huge love hate relationship with these games.

1043
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:29,049
Speaker 0: is that, you know, I like playing them, but I recognize they're not as good cause.

1044
00:51:29,069 --> 00:51:31,650
Speaker 0: they're knowledge games and not decision strategy games.

1045
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:34,850
Speaker 1: Mostly knowledge games, but they serve a very different.

1046
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:35,218
Speaker 0: Yes.

1047
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:37,170
Speaker 0: And I like Lang.

1048
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:43,390
Speaker 0: I like using letters and stuff, but I recognize that it's stupid yet to use all these two letter words and the memorization.

1049
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:56,670
Speaker 0: It would be much better if it was just actual real words, not that the two letter words aren't real words, but if it was, you know, testing your actual vocabulary and not some, you know, memorized vocabulary, you're never actually going to use in real life.

1050
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,950
Speaker 0: And you know, it's, it's always, it's like back and forth kind of thing.

1051
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,842
Speaker 0: And I guess the thing is I am, I'm at least happy they exist.

1052
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:15,410
Speaker 0: because if you look at the shelf of crappy board games that you see at the toy store, all right, it's like, you look monopoly is terrible and all these games are terrible, but Scrabble is like, well, it's there, it's wicked popular.

1053
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:19,470
Speaker 0: You can even buy it in any old drug store and it's actually got something to it.

1054
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:24,254
Speaker 0: You know, at least there is a game that's popular among the normal mainstream board games.

1055
00:52:24,537 --> 00:52:25,810
Speaker 0: that isn't just crap.

1056
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:28,710
Speaker 0: Like all the other ones that are, you know, and that's like, okay, good.

1057
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,050
Speaker 0: We've at least got one good game in there, you know, that people are all about.

1058
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,550
Speaker 0: And apples to apples is actually coming on pretty strong in that, uh, in that department as well.

1059
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,830
Speaker 0: I saw apples to apples for sale and just like the Dwayne Reed.

1060
00:52:39,217 --> 00:52:39,407
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1061
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:43,690
Speaker 1: So however, apples to apples wall fun, I think is completely petered out for me.

1062
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:46,650
Speaker 1: Dixit is a far superior game that achieves the same purpose.

1063
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:47,386
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

1064
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,628
Speaker 1: By removing the words.

1065
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:55,850
Speaker 0: But I think that, uh, apples to apples, you know, could still get some play value if we had some new cards, you know, but not that many.

1066
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,130
Speaker 0: I'd much rather play Dixit, but Dixit doesn't do the party though.

1067
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,050
Speaker 1: There is a super Scrabble that Hasbro released.

1068
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:02,723
Speaker 0: Really?

1069
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:03,269
Speaker 0: What's in that?

1070
00:53:03,895 --> 00:53:05,450
Speaker 1: There are many international versions.

1071
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:06,930
Speaker 1: Here's one in Tagalog.

1072
00:53:07,755 --> 00:53:08,309
Speaker 0: What's Tagalog?

1073
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:09,188
Speaker 1: Really?

1074
00:53:09,774 --> 00:53:10,310
Speaker 1: Really, Scott?

1075
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:11,190
Speaker 1: Really?

1076
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:12,548
Speaker 0: What is it?

1077
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,348
Speaker 1: It's a language.

1078
00:53:14,071 --> 00:53:14,436
Speaker 0: A language.

1079
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,106
Speaker 0: where do they speak it?

1080
00:53:16,922 --> 00:53:17,050
Speaker 1: Really?

1081
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:17,909
Speaker 0: In Tag?

1082
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:19,409
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no place called Tag.

1083
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:26,310
Speaker 1: Anyway, Super Scrabble is relatively recent and I didn't know about it.

1084
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:27,088
Speaker 1: I'm going to look into it.

1085
00:53:27,536 --> 00:53:27,969
Speaker 0: What's it got?

1086
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:30,010
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure that out.

1087
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,670
Speaker 1: There's no pictures on the Wikipedia page.

1088
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:37,864
Speaker 0: My parents actually had a, um, a Scrabble deluxe edition, which if you're going to play Okay.

1089
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,708
Speaker 1: Here's the tagline on the box.

1090
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:43,229
Speaker 1: More spaces, more tiles, more points.

1091
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:44,210
Speaker 0: Okay.

1092
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,930
Speaker 0: So it's, so it's epic levels.

1093
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:47,801
Speaker 1: It's just bigger with quadruple word scores.

1094
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:49,559
Speaker 0: Okay.

1095
00:53:51,392 --> 00:53:54,010
Speaker 0: But yeah, I really actually, uh, what was I told?

1096
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,310
Speaker 0: So deluxe Scrabble, right?

1097
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:04,820
Speaker 0: So regular old Scrabble, which is what I have comes in a tiny box and it's really good cause it's portable and small and cheap, but it's basically a cardboard board and just a bag of tiles.

1098
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,309
Speaker 0: and that's it.

1099
00:54:05,511 --> 00:54:10,390
Speaker 0: The deluxe Scrabble has plastic trays to put your tiles in instead of little crappy trays.

1100
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,609
Speaker 0: And it's got pegs to keep score with.

1101
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,290
Speaker 0: So you don't have to write the score down on paper.

1102
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,710
Speaker 0: And it's got a board that's on a, that's on a spinning, uh, daisy kind of thing.

1103
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:23,929
Speaker 0: So you can spin the border on the face, whoever's playing and by God, more board games fucking need that.

1104
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:29,429
Speaker 0: Cause how many times do you fight over who's on the front of the board and who's sitting at the back of the board all the fucking time.

1105
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:36,530
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, if you're going to play Scrabble for serious, you should invest in the deluxe edition if you're going to play it a lot.

1106
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:42,708
Speaker 1: All right, Scott, it's Scrabble isn't in English, Afrikaans, Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Croatian, Czech, Danish.

1107
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:44,150
Speaker 1: It's in every fucking language.

1108
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,129
Speaker 1: There's pictures of all of them.

1109
00:54:45,351 --> 00:54:45,930
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

1110
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,310
Speaker 0: I want to see.

1111
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:47,648
Speaker 0: I want to see that.

1112
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:48,430
Speaker 0: That'd be pretty interesting.

1113
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:49,769
Speaker 1: Looking for the Japanese one.

1114
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:51,050
Speaker 0: It would work really well in Hebrew.

1115
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,170
Speaker 1: I don't know if it would work for Japanese at all.

1116
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:54,450
Speaker 0: I'm sure it would.

1117
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:55,770
Speaker 0: It just like hiragana's or whatever.

1118
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,530
Speaker 1: There appears to not be a Japanese version.

1119
00:54:58,731 --> 00:54:59,004
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

1120
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:02,789
Speaker 0: What about, I'm sure that, you know, there's some languages that works and some, it doesn't.

1121
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,630
Speaker 0: How would it work in Korean?

1122
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:04,950
Speaker 0: Right?

1123
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:06,145
Speaker 0: Cause you got to combine the leg.

1124
00:55:08,331 --> 00:55:14,468
Speaker 1: Maybe if they had transparencies like cells, like upwards and you have to form the characters like that.

1125
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:21,870
Speaker 0: Maybe they have a different game that is sort of the same, but not because like the new pool game that we learned about from, uh, yeah.

1126
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,750
Speaker 1: It's like the gas station.

1127
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,210
Speaker 0: Exactly.

1128
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,930
Speaker 0: If they have like a different game, that's their equivalent of Scrabble for their alphabet.

1129
00:55:27,111 --> 00:55:29,930
Speaker 0: And maybe we could adapt that game to English somehow.

1130
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:30,399
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1131
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,350
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, you really not know where Tagalog is spoken.

1132
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:34,247
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about it?

1133
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:35,270
Speaker 0: I know nothing about it.

1134
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:36,650
Speaker 0: I've never heard, I've never heard of it.

1135
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:39,070
Speaker 1: You never even read like, I don't know, Cryptonomicon?

1136
00:55:39,858 --> 00:55:40,110
Speaker 0: Uh, Nope.

1137
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:41,449
Speaker 1: No, you've never read that?

1138
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:41,755
Speaker 1: No.

1139
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:42,990
Speaker 1: Oh, all right.

1140
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,129
Speaker 1: It's Filipino.

1141
00:55:44,938 --> 00:55:45,230
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

1142
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,059
Speaker 1: Okay.

1143
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:47,047
Speaker 0: How about that?

1144
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,890
Speaker 0: There you go.

1145
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,450
Speaker 0: There you go.

1146
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:50,530
Speaker 1: You can use that word the next time you play Scrabble.

1147
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,328
Speaker 0: What does it sound like?

1148
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,709
Speaker 1: I have no idea what Tagalog sounds like.

1149
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:54,145
Speaker 0: Okay.

1150
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,010
Speaker 0: Check it out on YouTube.

1151
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,430
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
