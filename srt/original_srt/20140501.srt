1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,988
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 1st, 2014.

2
00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:12,051
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:13,155
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:14,720
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:21,220
Speaker 1: We've got a profile in Geek with Carl Custer, also known as Uncle Yo.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,777
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,211 --> 00:00:29,310
Speaker 0: Lasting subliminal messages.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:29,692
Speaker 1: They like that.

9
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:30,436
Speaker 1: I do stuff on the show.

10
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:30,778
Speaker 1: I don't know.

11
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:32,729
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone, the listener has never complained.

12
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:33,730
Speaker 2: The listener?

13
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:37,485
Speaker 1: For anyone who cares, I stole that joke from NPR.

14
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:38,210
Speaker 1: It's all politics.

15
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:38,646
Speaker 1: We know that.

16
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:40,535
Speaker 2: Alright, so yeah.

17
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,010
Speaker 2: Screw news and thing of the day because I can't find any and it's too nice out.

18
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's not like airliners are disappearing and Ukraine is on the brink of collapse.

19
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,470
Speaker 2: It's nothing we need to talk about on this show on Thursday.

20
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:51,950
Speaker 2: And I just want to go outside.

21
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,778
Speaker 1: You don't want to talk on the lounge?

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,722
Speaker 2: No, I want to go to the beautiful weather and the beautiful food.

23
00:00:57,104 --> 00:00:58,330
Speaker 2: So let's talk to Carl and then leave.

24
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,250
Speaker 1: I'm very much enjoying the fact that it was literally shit weather.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:05,804
Speaker 1: Shit was falling from the sky until about midday today.

26
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,050
Speaker 1: The sun came out.

27
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,629
Speaker 2: Now it is the best possible weather.

28
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,453
Speaker 1: We started singing.

29
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:13,910
Speaker 1: Jonathan Coulton was in Central Park and I guess he sang first of May, I heard, like for real.

30
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, within about two hours the weather outside suddenly went from an old Don Bluth movie to a newer Don Bluth movie.

31
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:21,208
Speaker 0: It was a weekly turnaround.

32
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,150
Speaker 2: So Carl, why haven't you been on this show before?

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,234
Speaker 0: You tell me, son!

34
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:31,609
Speaker 0: I'm like, I have lived, what, four subway stops away from RIM for how long?

35
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:34,548
Speaker 0: Oh goodness, no.

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,890
Speaker 0: No, actually one of the, I think it was the first instance that there was ever a meeting eye to eye.

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:49,550
Speaker 0: So New York Anime Festival, we're down still in the basement of the Javits before we had ever grown up to be subjugated and moved down into the attic.

38
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,433
Speaker 0: Before we were just like.

39
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:56,410
Speaker 0: basically, it was a lot like the Comic-Con was kind of trying to flush the anime circuit out of its own system.

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:06,670
Speaker 0: Like full on head cold was Anime Festival and then Comic-Con with a little bit of anime programming was when they were up in the attic and then they finally popped that zit and then just let all the weeaboos go and they said, here is New York Comic-Con.

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:11,345
Speaker 0: It'll be San Diego Comic-Con but there will be even fewer buses.

42
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:12,930
Speaker 0: More Walking Dead people.

43
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,682
Speaker 1: Man, we didn't even live in the city back then.

44
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,610
Speaker 1: I remember we were leaving.

45
00:02:15,872 --> 00:02:16,610
Speaker 0: No, still Beacon.

46
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:21,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, a bunch of people were heading back out to Flushing and I didn't even know where Flushing was.

47
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,850
Speaker 1: And I was like, well, time to get on my two hour train.

48
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,310
Speaker 2: I remember the very first New York Comic-Con when the Anime Festival was still separate.

49
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:31,647
Speaker 2: I was in the city for a day for some reason and I walked over there and I'm like, nope.

50
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:32,430
Speaker 2: And I walked away.

51
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:34,419
Speaker 1: I have an archive of that conversation.

52
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:36,549
Speaker 1: You were like, yeah, so the fire department's here.

53
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:40,703
Speaker 0: I still have the original recording from when you said, so just press this.

54
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:42,289
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get it to you after the show.

55
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,531
Speaker 0: Press what?

56
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,334
Speaker 0: That's the record button.

57
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:44,615
Speaker 0: Bye.

58
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,059
Speaker 0: I'm hungry.

59
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:46,581
Speaker 0: I'm going to go.

60
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:48,989
Speaker 0: Farewell, long haired man.

61
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:56,010
Speaker 1: So young, naive, thinking that Reed was going to run an Anime-Con and it was going to be totally okay.

62
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:02,170
Speaker 0: The idea that the Anime-Con was going to progress into something, into some sort of a business model.

63
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,710
Speaker 0: I mean, the only one that's been able to keep up with that has been Crunchyroll.

64
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,259
Speaker 0: And that's really just to the extent of like Denver.

65
00:03:08,339 --> 00:03:12,818
Speaker 0: legalizing marijuana was something similar to how Crunchyroll decided, we can't stop them from downloading.

66
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:19,469
Speaker 0: But if we make them keep thinking that they're downloading, because we can't teach them new habits, but maybe we can teach them to click here.

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,754
Speaker 1: Kids still pirate anime though.

68
00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:24,870
Speaker 1: And their argument is the watermark in Crunchyroll ruins the experience.

69
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:25,833
Speaker 2: Okay.

70
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:28,790
Speaker 1: Speaking of which, Scott, we're still logged into your Crunchyroll.

71
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:30,706
Speaker 2: Oh, that's fine.

72
00:03:30,787 --> 00:03:30,990
Speaker 2: Yeah.

73
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,034
Speaker 0: You want to fun with Crunchyroll.

74
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:39,970
Speaker 0: Out in, I think it was Penn State, someone raised their hand during a, it's the only show that will do an 18 plus panel called Tentacles and Trash Talk.

75
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,176
Speaker 0: And every year it becomes a different terrible fiasco.

76
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,932
Speaker 0: The one year that we actually did show like classic, what was it?

77
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,502
Speaker 0: Demon Beast Invasion, I think, just for the sake of the audience.

78
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,577
Speaker 0: Guy came up to me and after three years, he finally got laid after taking this girl to cause.

79
00:03:52,597 --> 00:03:56,830
Speaker 0: I said, I promise you that had nothing to do with Tentacles and Trash Talk.

80
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,150
Speaker 0: But for some reason, he's still wanted to thank me.

81
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,839
Speaker 2: You don't know that girl.

82
00:03:58,859 --> 00:03:59,629
Speaker 2: Who knows who that could be?

83
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,713
Speaker 0: Lord help us all.

84
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:07,550
Speaker 0: But there was someone who raised their hand and said, I get offended when people say that Attack on Titan is the new Fullmetal Alchemist.

85
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,050
Speaker 0: And the only thing- But now we say that, but Black Dynamite.

86
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:11,299
Speaker 2: I know.

87
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,430
Speaker 2: Attack on Titan is the new Fullmetal Alchemist.

88
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:19,529
Speaker 0: If you bring that up, then clearly those may be the only two anime you have ever heard of or seen on DeviantArt.

89
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,970
Speaker 1: These kids, I always try to remind them like, so you ever heard of this thing called Fushigi Yugi?

90
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was as big as your Attack on Titan.

91
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,190
Speaker 1: That's true.

92
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,430
Speaker 1: You will not only have never heard of it, but wouldn't watch it because it looks old.

93
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:37,310
Speaker 2: So he seemed to have diverted into a land of anime talk, but not all the listeners know who Carl is.

94
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,770
Speaker 2: We started taking that for granted.

95
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,301
Speaker 2: Yeah.

96
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:40,288
Speaker 2: No, not a problem.

97
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,467
Speaker 2: Shall we continue to do so?

98
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:42,247
Speaker 1: If you wish.

99
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,309
Speaker 1: So what exactly is it that you do?

100
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,192
Speaker 2: Who are you?

101
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:45,614
Speaker 2: Why do-?

102
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:59,770
Speaker 0: I'm a geek-specific stand-up comedian, and I only met you guys through our mutual burlesque buddy Stella Chu back when there was a real name to be had attached to that lovely woman.

103
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:08,750
Speaker 0: But my concept after running the anime club at SUNY Purchase was, I'd just been to New York Comic Convention, so it's still junior year of college.

104
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,692
Speaker 0: We're still talking like 2006 or 2007.

105
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:20,450
Speaker 0: And I wanted to try as hard as I could to get into more conventions, because growing up, '80s and '90s, that just meant cartoons were in my DNA.

106
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,922
Speaker 0: The Disney Afternoon was muscle memory at this point.

107
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:27,730
Speaker 0: The opening to Mighty Max was stuck in my heart and my soul.

108
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:28,509
Speaker 0: Mighty Max.

109
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,230
Speaker 0: Seeing that many people in costume.

110
00:05:30,392 --> 00:05:31,749
Speaker 2: Oh, I was thinking of Fantastic Max.

111
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:33,910
Speaker 0: Oh my god, yes.

112
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:34,650
Speaker 0: Easily confused.

113
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,609
Speaker 0: That and Super Ted.

114
00:05:36,456 --> 00:05:37,090
Speaker 2: Or Mighty Mouse.

115
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,263
Speaker 0: Mighty Mouse was wonderful.

116
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:40,149
Speaker 0: I was interested by that.

117
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,209
Speaker 2: All right, let's not carry this any further.

118
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,869
Speaker 0: So I don't remember what that if possum super dynamic radical rodent of tomorrow was if he was linked to the new Mighty Mouse or the new-.

119
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,990
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm a geek-specific stand-up comedian, and after like five years, I've simply toured around the Northeast.

120
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,405
Speaker 0: And now at this point, Otacon Anime Expo out on the West Coast.

121
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:04,310
Speaker 0: I've hit up Boston a couple of times.

122
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,750
Speaker 0: There's really not a college anime convention that I will not appear to, so long as they're cool with getting me up there.

123
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:17,830
Speaker 0: So what it originally started as was just a way to get into cons without needing to pay.

124
00:06:19,492 --> 00:06:22,700
Speaker 0: A lot of people have tried to sneak their way into that many times.

125
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:26,190
Speaker 0: It works great, especially if you walk around with a Bluetooth and a sports coat.

126
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,601
Speaker 0: It'll get you into almost any show, just letting them know, "I have a panel in five minutes.

127
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:30,123
Speaker 0: It's up to you.

128
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,069
Speaker 0: You can take it up with me or take it up with the con

129
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:32,250
Speaker 0: chair.".

130
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:37,450
Speaker 1: I do recall a certain unnamed con where we walked in, convinced them we were guests, and walked out of that room with guest badges.

131
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:47,870
Speaker 0: Kat ends up getting a guest pass more than I do, and it's fun because I get to see her get more backstage passes than actual guests or panelists at other conventions.

132
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,755
Speaker 0: You get more knowing me than actually being me.

133
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:55,025
Speaker 0: But no, I guess I've launched maybe three comedy albums.

134
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,110
Speaker 0: I've subjected you to enough of that, Rim.

135
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,898
Speaker 0: DVD as well, and after five or six years, Kat says, "Take a year off.

136
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:07,183
Speaker 0: Try to grow this brand.

137
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:10,589
Speaker 0: See what you can do if you market yourself as the loud white guy in the silver

138
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,889
Speaker 0: tie.".

139
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,497
Speaker 0: Which gets me into more trouble than necessary.

140
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:17,570
Speaker 0: If I do a show at a hotel for the first time, people think I'm either staff or I'm catering.

141
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:22,423
Speaker 0: I was in Harrisburg, and there was a catering event happening next door.

142
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,590
Speaker 0: Everyone was dressed like Uncle Yo in a black apron.

143
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,034
Speaker 0: So solid black, silver tie.

144
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:31,490
Speaker 0: And I just wondered, could I walk in and fire all those people and convince them that they were fired?

145
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,767
Speaker 1: What you should have done is taken a picture and then tweeted and said, "Everyone's cosplaying as me.

146
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:36,068
Speaker 1: This is

147
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:36,530
Speaker 1: amazing.".

148
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:42,810
Speaker 0: What's terrible is that there's a character in both One Piece and Homestuck that wears something very similar to Uncle Yo, especially since they go onto the text.

149
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:47,790
Speaker 0: And it's getting to a point where I can't determine whether people are or not cosplaying me at this point.

150
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,069
Speaker 1: I would have never thought I'd hear One Piece and Homestuck in the same sentence.

151
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:58,285
Speaker 2: If you change slightly to distinguish yourself from them, is that an admittance of failure?

152
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,269
Speaker 2: Or is that, in a way, leadership?

153
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,253
Speaker 0: Here's my deal.

154
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:14,270
Speaker 0: If the Angry Video Game Nerd and the Nostalgia Critic can get those background roles in an anime, how long do I have to do this before Japan recognizes I actually care about them so much more than Doug Walker?

155
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,366
Speaker 0: I know so much more of their medium than Mr.

156
00:08:18,387 --> 00:08:18,849
Speaker 0: Walker.

157
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:20,738
Speaker 2: Isn't that so strange?

158
00:08:20,758 --> 00:08:22,950
Speaker 2: I think you do more cons than anyone I know.

159
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:23,737
Speaker 0: I did 26 last year.

160
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,729
Speaker 1: You now do more than we did at our peak of cons.

161
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,630
Speaker 2: I think the second person to do the most cons that I know personally is us.

162
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:33,068
Speaker 1: Charles Dunbar?

163
00:08:33,451 --> 00:08:35,289
Speaker 2: Charles Dunbar and then us, right?

164
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:42,289
Speaker 2: It used to be that if you were in-person famous, that is the most famous, right?

165
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,870
Speaker 2: But now, you could never appear at a con ever, but if you're on YouTube famous, that's bigger.

166
00:08:48,091 --> 00:09:08,570
Speaker 0: Let me tell you, 26 weekend shows last year, at least half of those shows, these could be actual conventions, these could be in the basement of a library, which is where I was in Kentucky, there is a two-hour block dedicated to showing the abridged Dragon Ball Z. Not Dragon Ball Z kind, not Dragon Ball Z, but just the abridged people.

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,249
Speaker 2: Team Four Star?

168
00:09:09,411 --> 00:09:10,049
Speaker 0: Team Four Star.

169
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,570
Speaker 1: I got in trouble once for scheduling, apparently, the wrong abridged at a Kineticon.

170
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:19,250
Speaker 1: So all these people were like, that was called Dragon Ball abridged, but it wasn't.

171
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,409
Speaker 1: And I was like, what they did was Dragon Ball abridged.

172
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,690
Speaker 1: I don't know who you are or what to tell you.

173
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,150
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about abridged anything.

174
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,129
Speaker 2: All I know is that it's a popular thing, and Team Four Star has something to do with it.

175
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:39,510
Speaker 1: Well, it was telling at PAX because they had the giant bomb panel, and right before that, they had some YouTuber guys who streamed their Minecraft, and the latter was all 30-year-old white dudes.

176
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,649
Speaker 1: The former was all 12-year-old boys and their moms.

177
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:46,550
Speaker 1: That room filled, people lined up hours in advance.

178
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,310
Speaker 0: I love the video of the old cockney granny playing through Grand Theft Auto 5 and just cursing at people as she's hitting them with her rocket launcher.

179
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,028
Speaker 2: Oh, it's an old one but a good one.

180
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,770
Speaker 0: So much love because there's so much delicious spite.

181
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,082
Speaker 0: She doesn't want to fully dive into it and start screaming, but she will just delightfully, "Oh, take that, you knoblocker.

182
00:10:04,102 --> 00:10:04,564
Speaker 0: There you go.

183
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:05,548
Speaker 0: Oh, terrible, terrible

184
00:10:05,568 --> 00:10:05,709
Speaker 0: boy.".

185
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,510
Speaker 1: So Carl, why do you seek fame and adoration from the masses?

186
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:12,070
Speaker 1: Is it because you ran an anime club?

187
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,409
Speaker 2: You already said he wants to get into cons for free.

188
00:10:13,832 --> 00:10:14,870
Speaker 1: Is that the only reason, though?

189
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:22,910
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is with narcissism is that you don't need other people to tell you that you have it, but you do need other people to validate your personal belief for having it at that point.

190
00:10:24,111 --> 00:10:36,370
Speaker 0: The reason to go around to cons is I'm so much more comfortable on stage yelling at a room full of strangers than I am really one-on-one, and for me, it's part therapy, it's part self-discovery.

191
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:47,069
Speaker 0: I was born and raised a writer, so comedy for me is writing for myself, so it scratches the two itches that I've never been able to put a title to.

192
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:54,007
Speaker 0: But once I realize, "Oh, all I want to do is write and perform, if I can do both, oh, that's so much easier, yes,

193
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:54,229
Speaker 0: right?".

194
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:55,700
Speaker 0: Ah, yes.

195
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,849
Speaker 0: Let me do that some more.

196
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,773
Speaker 1: So is it hurting or helping that you're getting the Geek Night studio experience of?

197
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:03,049
Speaker 1: neither one of us looks at you?

198
00:11:03,771 --> 00:11:04,936
Speaker 0: It's absolutely spectacular.

199
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,830
Speaker 0: I mean, I've had my dick out this entire interview.

200
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:12,350
Speaker 2: That's not a first in this apartment.

201
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,810
Speaker 0: That I've had my dick out?

202
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:20,030
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know, you always talk about how we do the podcast with our eyes closed and not looking at anything.

203
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,410
Speaker 2: Well, you do.

204
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,910
Speaker 2: You pretty much never wear pants if you are in a house that belongs to you.

205
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,660
Speaker 1: So not wearing pants is for comfort.

206
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,370
Speaker 0: That is an American right.

207
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,990
Speaker 1: You lay down and close your eyes and won't look at anyone when we talk to them on the show.

208
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,150
Speaker 2: Do I need to look at someone when I'm talking to them on the show?

209
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,027
Speaker 1: That's what humans do.

210
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:38,339
Speaker 0: He knows where they are.

211
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,849
Speaker 0: He's going to his happy place.

212
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,249
Speaker 0: He's imagining us all as just these weird goat anemone puppets.

213
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:49,083
Speaker 2: I'm concentrating on what I'm going to say so I can say better things as opposed to trying to process visual stimuli.

214
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:57,350
Speaker 0: No one can tell, but Howard Stern always had those eyes peeled shut and just pine stapled behind the sunglasses.

215
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,730
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure everyone in the Howard Stern show is in a separate sealed booth.

216
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:10,289
Speaker 1: No, from what I saw they did it around a big table and they'd pass notes to someone who would come up with a joke and they'd pass the note around to get the joke perfect and then someone would deliver it at the right time.

217
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,330
Speaker 1: I vaguely recall seeing something to that effect somewhere.

218
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,749
Speaker 1: We will never achieve that level.

219
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:15,777
Speaker 0: Like live writing.

220
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,070
Speaker 0: No, you guys need a Robin.

221
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,870
Speaker 2: Also, isn't that show like six hours a day starting early in the morning or something like that?

222
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,007
Speaker 1: I guess it's an early form of Minecraft streaming just without the Minecraft.

223
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:26,570
Speaker 1: It's just him.

224
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,601
Speaker 2: It's super long and it's every day.

225
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:31,310
Speaker 2: I don't think we could ever do that.

226
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,208
Speaker 0: Originally when it was just called talking at people.

227
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,278
Speaker 0: Now to see it evolve.

228
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:38,150
Speaker 0: Then again, there's you guys who got started.

229
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,330
Speaker 0: I think you were the first people to ever name the noun podcast for me.

230
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:44,194
Speaker 2: For you?

231
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:44,841
Speaker 2: At least for me personally.

232
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,849
Speaker 2: We definitely didn't come up with it.

233
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,390
Speaker 1: Scott did podcasting before podcasting once.

234
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,536
Speaker 2: Yeah, back in RIT.

235
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:56,569
Speaker 2: Podcasting I think existed in 2004-ish, so this is probably around the same time.

236
00:12:57,211 --> 00:13:04,150
Speaker 2: I had a blog that was just a really crappy blog hosted in our colony apartment.

237
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,308
Speaker 2: I was just like, "Hey, what if I just recorded an mp3 of me talking and just put it in the blog

238
00:13:10,348 --> 00:13:10,589
Speaker 2: post?".

239
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:16,426
Speaker 2: There wasn't RSS feeds or podcast readers or anything like that.

240
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:17,330
Speaker 2: I just did it.

241
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:18,389
Speaker 0: No one knew how to find it.

242
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,789
Speaker 2: I don't think anyone listened to it or cared, but I did it.

243
00:13:20,952 --> 00:13:21,767
Speaker 1: I listened to it.

244
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,529
Speaker 2: Okay, that might have counted maybe.

245
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:38,110
Speaker 2: But yeah, it wasn't until the iPod Nano came out and they added podcasts to iTunes that I fully understood what a podcast was, what an RSS feed, how it worked with the embedding the media in it and everything.

246
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,192
Speaker 1: No, I'll be honest.

247
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:44,070
Speaker 1: We do geek nights as a podcast and it's fun and all, but podcasting is kind of plateaued if not dead.

248
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:45,555
Speaker 2: I think it's a weird thing.

249
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:46,599
Speaker 2: It's plateaued.

250
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,310
Speaker 2: It's much like broadcast radio, right?

251
00:13:49,591 --> 00:13:58,763
Speaker 0: I think the people who are going to discover it and find it to fill in those niche, whether it's for the long drive, whether it's for the jog, they have their eyes or hands occupied.

252
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,830
Speaker 0: They just need sound in the background.

253
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,270
Speaker 0: The people who are going to find that need that niche do.

254
00:14:03,991 --> 00:14:09,934
Speaker 0: You're not going to pitch a podcast to say someone like me who's on my feed eight hours a day at a restaurant, "Try checking out this.

255
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:10,577
Speaker 0: Try checking out this.

256
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:12,908
Speaker 0: I can get my news when I'm sitting down on the

257
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:13,250
Speaker 0: subway.".

258
00:14:13,732 --> 00:14:19,490
Speaker 0: It's hard to break people into it, but once they found that niche and it fit their time, they'll make time for it.

259
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,553
Speaker 0: That's the neat part about it.

260
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:27,797
Speaker 0: You want to argue that either NPR or Stuff You Should Know or Mark Maron or even Night Vale have plateaued it.

261
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:34,660
Speaker 0: The real question ends up being now that the medium has found itself, is there anywhere else for it to go?

262
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,530
Speaker 0: If there really isn't, totally content with that.

263
00:14:38,052 --> 00:14:49,489
Speaker 0: Find your audience, and if nothing else, the internet is this macrocosm of microcosms, so you're totally able to absorb just the media that you want, the opinions that you respect, and would otherwise vocalize yourself.

264
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,570
Speaker 2: And live in a tiny bubble and ignore the rest of society.

265
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,316
Speaker 2: Huzzah!

266
00:14:52,336 --> 00:14:53,390
Speaker 0: Welcome to Kentucky!

267
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:56,203
Speaker 0: I shouldn't say that.

268
00:14:56,223 --> 00:14:56,770
Speaker 0: I meant Tennessee.

269
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,590
Speaker 1: I think what's hurt podcasting at least is a lot of people thought they could make money doing it or turn it into their career.

270
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,790
Speaker 2: Yeah, those people all disappeared.

271
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,404
Speaker 1: You pretty much definitely can't do it as its own thing.

272
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:07,930
Speaker 1: It has to be auxiliary to something else.

273
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,689
Speaker 0: Almost like making money off of anime fans.

274
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're really working on trying to do this as your 100% career, making content, making things.

275
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,682
Speaker 1: You're doing the thing that we really never had the courage to do.

276
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:19,969
Speaker 1: We keep just working jobs.

277
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,450
Speaker 2: If I worked in a restaurant, I would be doing the same thing.

278
00:15:23,032 --> 00:15:25,390
Speaker 0: If you worked at a restaurant, you would not be at that restaurant very long.

279
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:37,470
Speaker 0: There was so close to strangling, especially the people who were coming in, especially the neighborhood that I'm in, you have to imagine one of those really primitive angry anthills where the ants have those massive jaws and spray acid.

280
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,668
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the queen ant is dead, so every other ant looked at each other and said, "I guess I'm the

281
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:42,849
Speaker 0: queen.".

282
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:45,256
Speaker 0: And they just go at it.

283
00:15:45,376 --> 00:15:49,528
Speaker 0: I have people, hour after hour, "You have to be my mommy

284
00:15:49,588 --> 00:15:49,769
Speaker 0: now!".

285
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,356
Speaker 0: Alright, as soon as I talked to these other four people, "No!

286
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,839
Speaker 0: You be my mommy!

287
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,905
Speaker 0: You do it this way!

288
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,529
Speaker 0: The way my mommy used

289
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:57,669
Speaker 0: to!".

290
00:15:58,272 --> 00:15:59,077
Speaker 0: "When did you last see your

291
00:15:59,117 --> 00:15:59,379
Speaker 0: mommy?".

292
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,346
Speaker 0: "In the Confederate

293
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:00,688
Speaker 0: War!".

294
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:05,138
Speaker 0: "You have been in this city for far too

295
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:05,480
Speaker 0: long.".

296
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,282
Speaker 0: "I smell

297
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:06,844
Speaker 0: colors!".

298
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:08,510
Speaker 0: I'm aware, lady, I'm aware.

299
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,770
Speaker 1: I'm definitely too misanthropic in some senses to ever deal with the public at large.

300
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,788
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

301
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:18,990
Speaker 1: I mean, I was known at RIT as literally the worst pizza chef the school had ever seen.

302
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,010
Speaker 2: I thought Greg Hartman was the worst pizza chef.

303
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:24,730
Speaker 1: Well, he quit literally the first day on the job, so I don't think that happened.

304
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:25,990
Speaker 2: How does that- it can't get worse than that!

305
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,943
Speaker 1: He showed up, we signed up, we're like, "Yeah, we're gonna get

306
00:16:27,963 --> 00:16:28,205
Speaker 1: jobs!".

307
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:29,818
Speaker 1: And they gave us jobs.

308
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,687
Speaker 1: They're like, "You wanna start right

309
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:30,848
Speaker 1: now?".

310
00:16:31,232 --> 00:16:31,534
Speaker 1: We said,

311
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:31,896
Speaker 1: "Sure!".

312
00:16:31,937 --> 00:16:33,770
Speaker 1: And we, like, washed dishes or something in the back.

313
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:35,869
Speaker 1: And then the next day, he just didn't show up to work.

314
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:41,950
Speaker 0: It's different from being a worse guy if you're talking about just in terms of how long you were behind the counter.

315
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:49,710
Speaker 0: Like, if you just quit within the first ten seconds, that's slightly different than you burned the store down, you cost them so much money, you ruined its reputation.

316
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,507
Speaker 1: Dick came out.

317
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,648
Speaker 0: Dick came out.

318
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,050
Speaker 0: Dick got on the pizza.

319
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,170
Speaker 0: Pizza got on the dick.

320
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:55,430
Speaker 0: Everybody lost.

321
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,470
Speaker 0: And, I mean, just RIT, he's popping up.

322
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,250
Speaker 0: I'll let you know, Toricon is now within five, six buildings on that campus.

323
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:01,850
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

324
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,510
Speaker 0: It is beautiful to see it expand.

325
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,490
Speaker 1: Every year, I get invited to Toricon, and it's always the same weekend as something else.

326
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:09,170
Speaker 1: So, it's been like four years.

327
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,829
Speaker 2: Isn't it usually close to, like, PAX East ahead of any Boston?

328
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:12,829
Speaker 0: That and/or Zenkai.

329
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,970
Speaker 2: Right, so, yeah.

330
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,150
Speaker 0: Far off dream someday.

331
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:24,410
Speaker 0: Someday, finding an audience that is not only within my age bracket, but also has disposable income.

332
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a rare commodity in the wider anime fandom, I think, sadly.

333
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,529
Speaker 2: It's hanging out with the unicorns.

334
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:31,266
Speaker 0: Precisely.

335
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:32,649
Speaker 0: Well, there you go.

336
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:39,050
Speaker 0: You break into either Brony Cons or Gaming Cons, or something that branches away from Tumblr.

337
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,270
Speaker 0: People were at least a generation that isn't getting their news source from Tumblr.

338
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:51,024
Speaker 0: So, we did an Ask a Supervillain panel with, like, me and +2 Comedy at a show, and our guy, Noah, is dressed as Gaston.

339
00:17:51,165 --> 00:17:52,090
Speaker 0: Disney's Gaston.

340
00:17:54,252 --> 00:18:02,050
Speaker 0: The first 10 minutes is he defeating the heckles of, like, six 16-year-old girls who weren't even sitting in chairs, just in one massive pile.

341
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,550
Speaker 0: Not even, like, a group hug, just a weird pile.

342
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,470
Speaker 0: Like, they're all supposed to merge, like, one coral reef.

343
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:11,536
Speaker 0: After the panel, they come out, get a bunch of pictures, and say, "You're that thing from Tumblr,".

344
00:18:11,556 --> 00:18:14,109
Speaker 0: and they leave, and I realize that they don't know.

345
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,490
Speaker 0: it's not a thing that generates new material.

346
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:19,810
Speaker 0: I don't even think they know the movie.

347
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,688
Speaker 0: Okay, time for sadness to kick in.

348
00:18:23,392 --> 00:18:24,489
Speaker 0: Ah, to be old again.

349
00:18:26,514 --> 00:18:27,364
Speaker 2: One day, they'll learn.

350
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,547
Speaker 2: They'll be like, "Oh, that's just like how, you know, you--".

351
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,804
Speaker 2: I can't think of a good example, but it's like, you see something, and you're like, "I know that from somewhere.

352
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:36,328
Speaker 2: Where is

353
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:36,428
Speaker 2: it?".

354
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, Zmetilu, Galaxy Express, how many of those kids?

355
00:18:40,131 --> 00:18:48,490
Speaker 1: They've seen that wave with the Russian hat and the yellow hair for their entire anime lives, Years and years later, you see it, and you see what it is.

356
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:52,289
Speaker 1: No, four people see it, because they go to, like, our panel, or Mike Tool's panel, and that's it.

357
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,250
Speaker 0: Passive, aggressive memories.

358
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,603
Speaker 1: They will literally never find out what that was.

359
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,272
Speaker 1: On their deathbed, they'll wonder, "What was that

360
00:18:59,333 --> 00:18:59,574
Speaker 1: thing?".

361
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,243
Speaker 0: And then, "The weird Russian

362
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:01,746
Speaker 0: anime.".

363
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:06,170
Speaker 1: I think the weird Russian anime is that that pirate goes ship.

364
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:13,130
Speaker 1: So, to pull the Daily Show bit at the end, what are you working on right now?

365
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,930
Speaker 0: That's a pretty nice segue, and that's actually why I contacted you guys.

366
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,157
Speaker 1: That wasn't a segue at all.

367
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,069
Speaker 1: That was a straight up, "I'm just going to

368
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:20,270
Speaker 1: redirect.".

369
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,250
Speaker 0: I mean, there's segue, and then there's the segue launching the president of segue off the cliff.

370
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:26,516
Speaker 0: I'm tired of you anymore.

371
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:28,024
Speaker 0: You've abused my people for too long.

372
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,150
Speaker 0: You're going down the cliff now.

373
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,890
Speaker 1: So, speaking of segues-- That's right.

374
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:34,530
Speaker 0: The last two years, I've just had this thought in my head, and I've always wanted to.

375
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,738
Speaker 0: Now, as anyone who does tabletop RPGs, the name Dungeons and Dragons eventually comes up, unless you want to branch into the indie circuit.

376
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:51,830
Speaker 0: I, by the way, over the last two months, have done, beyond Dungeons and Dragons, your panel that I've since altered-- Fevery of our Creative Commons license.

377
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:54,578
Speaker 0: Six times this year!

378
00:19:54,598 --> 00:19:56,166
Speaker 0: No, six times in the last two months.

379
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,010
Speaker 0: This time this year?

380
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:58,784
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it's been almost eight.

381
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:02,730
Speaker 1: If you do it 13 times, you'll have run it more times than we've run it.

382
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,019
Speaker 0: Over the last three, four years?

383
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:06,761
Speaker 0: Yeah, you bet.

384
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,210
Speaker 0: I'm actually up to closer to 30 times I've given a lecture.

385
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:10,949
Speaker 2: That's more times than we have.

386
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:15,250
Speaker 0: But to your credit, though, I do take it from a very different perspective.

387
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,576
Speaker 0: For me, it's not so much about the game mechanic.

388
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,950
Speaker 0: I come at it from an improv or director/writer background.

389
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:49,698
Speaker 0: So the things I'm trying to also pitch is D&D might not be the best, because maybe the charts are a tad too restrictive for newer players, but if you start at an improv camp, or you're just the theater kid who wants to get into RPing, quick to learn, quick to play games to give the power back to you, because you've got all this energy, you want it to go somewhere, and you might not be 300 plus pounds with an anthropology degree, and your starting city, its main export is corn.

390
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,350
Speaker 0: Tell me what I can hit with my sword and kill!

391
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,270
Speaker 0: Well, it's actually plutocracy, so you have to fill up these paper works.

392
00:20:58,831 --> 00:21:08,190
Speaker 0: So two years go by, and we're driving away from a self imploding convention, and the friends in the car night, we just start playing with voices.

393
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:18,890
Speaker 0: Everyone who tries to do it, like I'm wearing the one die short t-shirt right now, they're a six episode web series that you've seen a bunch of times if you're within that closed off circuit.

394
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,770
Speaker 0: Such as, where are the Cheetos, can I have a Mountain Dew, plus nine against killing ogres.

395
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:27,530
Speaker 0: It's always about the players, and their meta lives if you will.

396
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:34,450
Speaker 0: It's fun to go back and forth on that, but having LARPed for a while in college, it eventually becomes a trope within its own microsphere.

397
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:41,130
Speaker 0: I always ask myself, and I still ask this when I'm running fourth edition, what are the monsters doing when the players aren't there?

398
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,090
Speaker 0: Clearly, like the Manticore did something to build itself up to be as dangerous as it is.

399
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,730
Speaker 0: Clearly the dragon did something to accumulate that treasure.

400
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,250
Speaker 0: It just doesn't start that way.

401
00:21:49,570 --> 00:22:00,890
Speaker 0: Maybe it had a good investment, maybe it just shanked a bunch of people, maybe it was smart enough to make off with the loot one step at a time, maybe it was just like a pyramid scheme or it was trickle down economics and suddenly Smaug has just mountains of gold.

402
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:04,590
Speaker 0: So the series became Dungeon Crawlers.

403
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,430
Speaker 0: Dungeon Crawlers, completely puppet based.

404
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:13,537
Speaker 0: Originally I had the idea of making it an audio show because it's very easy for me to slip back and forth between.

405
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:23,990
Speaker 0: going through Thrak, he's socially anxious, going back to Benny, who's the brains of the operation I want to say.

406
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,558
Speaker 0: Benny's an out of work actor.

407
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:29,950
Speaker 0: slash wraith, suffers from clinical depression.

408
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:42,110
Speaker 0: In the first episode of Dungeon Crawlers, Benny essentially breaks up with his therapist when he realizes his therapist is still trying to prescribe him medication to give to his roommate, just as a way to tack onto the bill.

409
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,459
Speaker 0: You're sending me on a side quest?

410
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:46,770
Speaker 0: You can't do that, you're my therapist.

411
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:47,784
Speaker 0: You're supposed to help me.

412
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,290
Speaker 0: So we developed almost two seasons of the idea and Kat finally looks me in the eye.

413
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:04,139
Speaker 0: A lot of my decisions come from her putting her foot down on top of my foot and saying just do it and stop talking about, no stop, let me rephrase that, stop talking to me about it.

414
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,004
Speaker 0: Shut up.

415
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:14,670
Speaker 0: So we contact this amazing puppeteer inventor, her list goes on more than Charles Dunbar's panel selection.

416
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:21,548
Speaker 0: A woman named Katrina Davies working for Beale Street Puppets down in Washington D.C.

417
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:27,050
Speaker 0: and we commission Thrak, Benny and their NPC hook slash roommate Jill.

418
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:38,446
Speaker 0: And the goal for 2014 and really all my hats and credits and love has to go out to all of the guest voices who've been pimping at Nonstop as of right now, May 1st.

419
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:50,930
Speaker 0: We have one episode out and every week I'm going to release an episode or a half episode which there's one coming up where Thrak just reads out loud a pony slash fic.

420
00:23:51,571 --> 00:23:56,069
Speaker 0: The following mini episode is Benny apologizing for Thrak reading said slash fic.

421
00:23:56,851 --> 00:24:00,530
Speaker 0: But it's a 12 episode story arc and we want to see how far it can go.

422
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:18,310
Speaker 0: We want to just really culminate the last five years of building up a name at anime conventions, building up a name online, pitching to podcasts to get the word out, pitching to the wonderful voice actors and within the abridging circuit who've been volunteering to do some voices for this.

423
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:28,890
Speaker 0: The people who through the time and just dedication to blue screen, a cat doing all the backgrounds, friends making all the music, showing what we can really do on zero budget and just a love of gaming.

424
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,730
Speaker 0: Have you guys ever played Panty Explosion?

425
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,636
Speaker 2: - I've heard of it.

426
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:33,670
Speaker 1: - I've seen it around.

427
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,750
Speaker 0: - Okay, episode four, the guys, the puppets play Panty Explosion.

428
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:43,070
Speaker 0: So for me, I love the meta of Dungeons and Dragons monsters.

429
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:53,749
Speaker 0: They know they're in a campaign and everything that they're restocking, they talk in that language, HP, AC, all of your armor class abbreviations, the tropes that you're going to have.

430
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:57,550
Speaker 0: But my main writing inspirations hands down, Venture Brothers.

431
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:07,370
Speaker 0: For me, the Venture Brothers do such an amazing job of being so meta self aware and yet creating their own gags and their own tropes.

432
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:10,430
Speaker 0: Shore Leave is just the name himself.

433
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:16,389
Speaker 0: There are so many wonderful contradictions and gags that you wouldn't expect to see from unless someone knew GI Joe so much.

434
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:22,589
Speaker 0: All you need to do to take a character from GI Joe is put them in hot pants and suddenly that is the gayest thing I have ever seen.

435
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,250
Speaker 0: Tunnel Scrubs, Sergeant Slaughter, put them in hot pants.

436
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:26,015
Speaker 0: I get it.

437
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,270
Speaker 0: It can totally work.

438
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,690
Speaker 1: - I can see where you're going with that though.

439
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,990
Speaker 1: I mean, Venture Brothers and I think Archer kind of does the same thing.

440
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,550
Speaker 0: - Brilliantly.

441
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,510
Speaker 1: - The characters on the servers look like such a simple stereotype.

442
00:25:34,792 --> 00:25:38,355
Speaker 1: The advice I always give people learning to role play is just make an accent and just role play.

443
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,470
Speaker 1: that accent and everything else will just kind of happen automatically.

444
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,770
Speaker 1: So you get this really simple character but then by being aware and being self consistent you can do the same Venture Brothers thing and get deeper and deeper.

445
00:25:47,971 --> 00:25:49,250
Speaker 1: Oh, the character is actually kind of complex.

446
00:25:49,592 --> 00:25:50,669
Speaker 1: Oh, that was actually kind of sweet.

447
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,170
Speaker 1: Oh, that was actually kind of sad.

448
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,390
Speaker 2: - Accent stereotype only lasts so long, right?

449
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 1: - Yeah, because Willy is not in the Simpsons anymore.

450
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:06,117
Speaker 2: - No, but even Willy, it's like as soon as he's forced to do something for more than 30 seconds, right, it's like something has to happen.

451
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,123
Speaker 2: that's not just, you know, oi, I'm Willy.

452
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,950
Speaker 0: - Damn Scots, they don't have any accents.

453
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:15,229
Speaker 0: - Yes, they certainly are hateful people.

454
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:15,846
Speaker 2: - Me haggis.

455
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,750
Speaker 0: - You just made yourself an enemy for life.

456
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:18,888
Speaker 1: - Sir, the mic's on.

457
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,970
Speaker 0: - That is the absolute right way to put it.

458
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,509
Speaker 0: I mean, Venture Brothers and Archer do the same thing.

459
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,530
Speaker 0: Like they mentioned, season one, Pam works at a farm.

460
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,330
Speaker 0: So now cutbacks to the farm.

461
00:26:28,931 --> 00:26:32,310
Speaker 0: She's delivered cow, cattle, she's done a bunch of drugs.

462
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:37,670
Speaker 0: She is apparently the god of the sex because she grew up on a farm.

463
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,410
Speaker 0: Give him an inch and take a mile.

464
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:48,009
Speaker 0: And that's one of my favorite parts about looking over a series, especially if you get into Venture Brothers now, season five, look at the hints that they drop in season one.

465
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:54,939
Speaker 0: Because there's a flashback episode where the monarch in his like generation one outfit, the first night he bones Dr.

466
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:57,709
Speaker 0: Girlfriend back before she became Dr.

467
00:26:57,729 --> 00:27:05,130
Speaker 0: Girlfriend, he mentions a character that we've never heard of before, Captain Sunshine, who comes in season like three or four to be voiced by the great Kevin Conroy.

468
00:27:05,531 --> 00:27:07,490
Speaker 0: So I see that the trigger is still on.

469
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,908
Speaker 0: I say, "You'll never break my impervious

470
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:10,130
Speaker 0: armor.".

471
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,290
Speaker 0: And to this day, he thinks I'm immune to harm.

472
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,770
Speaker 2: - Now see, I don't know, something like that.

473
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,930
Speaker 2: It's like they didn't write four seasons at once, right?

474
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,110
Speaker 2: - They went and they're like, "All right, we're making season four now.

475
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,006
Speaker 2: "Let's watch season one.

476
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:22,530
Speaker 2: "Oh, I need a character.

477
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,410
Speaker 2: "Someone mentioned one.

478
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:23,737
Speaker 2: "Boom.".

479
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,950
Speaker 0: - Let's see what we can do with that.

480
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,069
Speaker 1: - So how are you doing it?

481
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,910
Speaker 1: How much of what you're doing is looking--.

482
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:28,769
Speaker 2: - It's only doing 12 episodes.

483
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:41,410
Speaker 1: - But leaving hints for the forward or future seasons versus, like if you did a season two, this gets really popular, are you gonna be going back, mining through the script, pulling out proper nouns that were mentioned offhandedly, and then charting everything together?

484
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:52,990
Speaker 0: - What we do have is just hours of the original three creators, Jack, Erin, and myself, just throwing ideas out at each other and realizing we should keep going back and wondering about this.

485
00:27:53,591 --> 00:28:01,510
Speaker 0: A couple of things that we established in the improv scene that got cut in the scripts, like Thrak is one of those idiots who knows a bunch of famous people but doesn't know why they're famous.

486
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,576
Speaker 0: "Yeah, it's just me and

487
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:02,738
Speaker 0: John.".

488
00:28:03,812 --> 00:28:04,039
Speaker 0: "John

489
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,203
Speaker 0: who?".

490
00:28:04,633 --> 00:28:05,161
Speaker 0: "Let me show you the

491
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:05,384
Speaker 0: photo.".

492
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:07,505
Speaker 0: "Jesus, how do you know John Bon

493
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:07,808
Speaker 0: Jovi?".

494
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:09,050
Speaker 0: "Oh, that's his last name.

495
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:10,810
Speaker 0: "I just call him John Tight Pants.

496
00:28:11,351 --> 00:28:12,578
Speaker 0: "He's a good friend of my mom's,

497
00:28:12,619 --> 00:28:12,840
Speaker 0: apparently.".

498
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:22,570
Speaker 0: What we're doing with the first 12 episodes is I'm working around the guest stars that I can pull in just to get ears turned in the directions.

499
00:28:23,292 --> 00:28:28,730
Speaker 0: There's a lot of heart that's going into it, and I actually get surprised when I get choked up or I start laughing at a script.

500
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:39,410
Speaker 0: Like, I was writing down last night, I was writing a dialogue with a dire kale, and I realized what is huge everywhere and so violently primitive?

501
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,190
Speaker 0: Dude, kale as opposed to regular lettuce.

502
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,210
Speaker 0: It's so high maintenance and crunchy and angry.

503
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:44,850
Speaker 2: And poison.

504
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,830
Speaker 0: And poison.

505
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:53,130
Speaker 0: You have to grind it and rub it in your hands before you can even think to chew it, and even then, it does not go down without a vicious fight.

506
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,150
Speaker 2: Well, you shouldn't eat raw kale.

507
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,270
Speaker 2: Only cooked kale.

508
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,650
Speaker 0: It's insanity.

509
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,830
Speaker 0: So, of course, what if there were, like, dire kale took over the cave?

510
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,810
Speaker 0: What could we do with that?

511
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:08,530
Speaker 0: So, to answer your question, I definitely have the first two seasons plotted out, figured out, and there are a couple of subplots.

512
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:17,009
Speaker 0: I just have to figure out what would be the best possible payoff, because the way the Venture Brothers love to write their script is they write a joke.

513
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:22,728
Speaker 0: They write an entire episode setting up for that joke, and when they finally are ready to record, they throw the joke out.

514
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,370
Speaker 0: And the episode stands on its own.

515
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:36,650
Speaker 0: So, what I've been able to do is take, like, these 10, 12-page scripts, because the episodes are only, like, 10 minutes long, what have you, with intro, outro, Benny does a, "This episode was brought to you by Jabalsag, Master of Beasts.

516
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:38,369
Speaker 0: Let's try it in a sentence.

517
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:41,064
Speaker 0: How the hell do you pronounce

518
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:41,387
Speaker 0: that?".

519
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,049
Speaker 0: Well, we do a lot of that.

520
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,190
Speaker 0: Thrax is always on the phone with a different one of our guest stars.

521
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,047
Speaker 0: Just working backwards from those payoff have been an amazing journey.

522
00:29:52,087 --> 00:30:15,001
Speaker 0: that, even though I exited school with a playwriting degree, we all looked at each other saying, "We should have just been writing College Humor and Funny or Die skits, because the year after we graduate, after they spend four years hammering us down, you must read Bronte, you must read Strindberg's plays, you must read Poe's plays, you must read all these weird esoteric, but we really like these five, 10-minute skits that make us

523
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:15,307
Speaker 0: laugh.".

524
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:18,189
Speaker 2: Because we're young, we're short attention spans, and so is the audience.

525
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,109
Speaker 0: There will never be an audience for that.

526
00:30:20,474 --> 00:30:25,190
Speaker 1: I mean, Penny Arcade, Michael Huleck, he was yelled at by all his teachers saying, "You shouldn't be drawing that stupid comic crap.

527
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,027
Speaker 1: Your style is too comic-y, your jokes are too mature,".

528
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,208
Speaker 1: and it kind of worked out for him.

529
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,090
Speaker 2: Didn't even go to college.

530
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:32,209
Speaker 1: That was high school, high school art.

531
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:39,330
Speaker 0: And Lord knows, it pays off when you just know your audience and you just start writing for yourself.

532
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:47,470
Speaker 0: That's been one of the neatest things for me, is writing something that I would care about, that would surprise me, weird side gags that would make me laugh.

533
00:30:47,571 --> 00:31:01,404
Speaker 0: I love the things that Archer will do, the way that everyone in that office has a shared dialogue or shared gags throughout those episodes, the way that they had phrasing, dropped phrasing, or everybody says, "This new place called, this new thing called,".

534
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:05,290
Speaker 0: you realize, these are people who are stuck living and working together for so long.

535
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:26,670
Speaker 0: They've acquired that alpha meme setters, trends, and gags, and I'm finding it by inventing words with Thrac, Benny, and Jill, but the process has truly been rewarding and the hope is, with the first season, is people like it, maybe at the end of the year, we do enough with it, 'cause it's not just the series that's gonna happen.

536
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:33,050
Speaker 0: Thrac has his own Twitter feed, primarily at the moment, - Yeah, him eating people, full internet.

537
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,970
Speaker 0: I wanna walk Thrac, he's a monstrous puppet, too.

538
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,699
Speaker 0: I mean, the head itself is like three and a half pounds, which for couch foam is a big head.

539
00:31:42,852 --> 00:31:50,090
Speaker 0: I wanna walk him around parks, now it's suddenly warm enough, I can walk him around Union Square, Central Park, hand out business cards, have him interact with people.

540
00:31:50,471 --> 00:32:02,790
Speaker 0: I'm trying to contact area LARPs, so I can film outside there, we're trying to contact gaming stores, and one of the ideas was either let's play with classic games like Golden Axe, but it's hard to do because Thrac's hands don't work.

541
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,586
Speaker 0: Benny is a puppet.

542
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,210
Speaker 2: - Ah, puppets doin' less play.

543
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,330
Speaker 0: (laughing) - Finally, we have reached the singularity of the internet.

544
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,830
Speaker 0: Thing is, Thrac's hands can't move, they're still.

545
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:20,810
Speaker 0: Benny's hands are my hands and gloves, so he can physically play, or maybe it just ends up being commentary, where-- - You don't need to show the hands, right?

546
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,289
Speaker 2: You can just put them on the couch.

547
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,129
Speaker 2: - No, no, realism.

548
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:37,469
Speaker 0: - While someone lays on the ground playing, or-- - It's me failing the game, and then just doing Thrac and Benny's commentating, or what I'd love to do is just have Benny and Thrac, a la The Gentleman's Guide to Gaming, review existing games.

549
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:49,990
Speaker 0: Like, when I first heard about Wraith the Oblivion, old World of Darkness game, it is Benny's life manifested, but so much more dark and emo, and the parallels made me just as sad as they made me happy.

550
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,405
Speaker 0: I'm hoping to really put in a lot of comedy heart behind this.

551
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:02,509
Speaker 0: Thrac breaks my heart in that he is so socially awkward, he can't turn away people who come to the door, but he's so good at his job--.

552
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,710
Speaker 2: - Better hope vampires don't knock.

553
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,646
Speaker 0: - Precisely.

554
00:33:05,593 --> 00:33:17,607
Speaker 0: In episode two, I'll let you know, episode three, he lets in a bunch of loth witnesses, who are just my, I guess my over-the-top Mormon parodies, they're just trying to give him literature, they're trying to, and he doesn't attack them until they ask for money.

555
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,950
Speaker 2: - That's that big spider thing that was at PAX, right?

556
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,249
Speaker 1: - Scott doesn't know anything about Forgotten Realms, I apologize.

557
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,068
Speaker 2: - I'm right, though, aren't I?

558
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,069
Speaker 1: - Spider girl.

559
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,049
Speaker 0: - No, he's totally right.

560
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,629
Speaker 2: - I said spider thing.

561
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:26,985
Speaker 2: - Yeah.

562
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,390
Speaker 0: - It didn't start on 4chan, it was Forgotten Realms.

563
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:31,789
Speaker 0: Saved me from Driedervor.

564
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,649
Speaker 2: - Listen, if I remembered the Realms, they wouldn't be forgotten, would they?

565
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,290
Speaker 0: - There you have it, yeah?

566
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,010
Speaker 0: Calling them out on their false advertising.

567
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:40,889
Speaker 0: What's it got to say about Dragonlance now?

568
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,770
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the only Forgotten Realm is Al-Kadim.

569
00:33:43,871 --> 00:33:48,950
Speaker 0: - Yeah, they brought back Greyhawk, they brought back Dark Sun, but they couldn't do, ah.

570
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,270
Speaker 2: - It's too racist.

571
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,750
Speaker 1: - Al-Kadim is a step below Ravenloft in terms of remembered and respected.

572
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,590
Speaker 0: - I love the art for that, though, it was so beautiful.

573
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,249
Speaker 2: - Oh, it is really good.

574
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:13,290
Speaker 0: - I have, I have under my bed, and when my nephew was born, I decided to keep his father around because he grew up with D&D, so I have a bunch of just second edition, not even like advanced D&D, but just second edition magic items as cards.

575
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:17,130
Speaker 0: I have the box set of the first release of Dark Sun.

576
00:34:17,451 --> 00:34:29,290
Speaker 0: It's too battered to play with, but it has the flip over cards for the initial campaign, it has the fluff literature, it has the fold out map, that delicious map of the world.

577
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:33,150
Speaker 2: - We should do some Dark Sun and Torchbearer, both equally deadly, it would work.

578
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:35,750
Speaker 1: - Dark Sun is way more deadly than Torchbearer.

579
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:36,308
Speaker 2: - You think so?

580
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,909
Speaker 1: - In the old rules, you started characters at I believe level three, because level one characters just couldn't make it.

581
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:57,479
Speaker 0: - They couldn't, like the lowest constitution you could have and survive a day in Dark Sun was like 16, 17, so they, all your stats weren't rolled on D6, they were rolled on like multiple D4s, plus add the following, and we thought, holy crap, I can play a half giant, I can play a half giant.

582
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:04,769
Speaker 0: that's not only psychic and psionic with telekinesis, but he's got like a strength of 24, I'm gonna need that, yeah, 'cause your wisdom score is three.

583
00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:16,730
Speaker 0: What, that's the max, this is great, I'm gonna play a mole, he's, it's like a bald half dwarf gladiator migrant who's also psychic, and that was like the flavoring of Dark Sun, is also your psychic.

584
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,770
Speaker 2: - Everyone's also psychic, even the bugs.

585
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,370
Speaker 0: - 'Cause they had released psionics, and that was, oh psionics in second edition.

586
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,540
Speaker 1: - Yep, they can wear armor, they have psychic powers, they can learn to disintegrate people by level three if they midmax.

587
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:31,390
Speaker 2: - And they're also not too shabby with swords, unlike some other people.

588
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,810
Speaker 1: - They can use a fucking scimitar.

589
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,150
Speaker 0: - Bitch, ugh, 'cause that's what hurt me.

590
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:40,220
Speaker 0: in second edition, that, and then when they released the ninja book, and then to this day-- - Oh my god, the ninja book.

591
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,249
Speaker 0: - The ultimate ninja.

592
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,337
Speaker 1: - The elf book was actually the most broken because there was, all elves could do something, a trick shot.

593
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:47,040
Speaker 2: - This is Rym's favorite thing in the world.

594
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,650
Speaker 0: - I have that book, I have the book, I know the trick shot.

595
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:59,049
Speaker 1: - Yep, you can shoot additional arrows with a minus four penalty stacking per each arrow, but because you always hit out of 20, you might as well shoot five arrows per turn.

596
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,498
Speaker 0: - Go for it, you have--.

597
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:03,339
Speaker 1: - Around, not turn, to be clear.

598
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:04,470
Speaker 0: - Back in the day.

599
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:05,669
Speaker 0: - Don't run out of arrows.

600
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:20,554
Speaker 0: - But yeah, for me, Dungeon Crawlers comes from a long, long-seated just love of stories of comedy, and for some reason, adding the puppets, and finally, I was always moving something with my hands, even talking.

601
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:22,550
Speaker 0: now, they never stop moving.

602
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:29,110
Speaker 0: Putting that energy into moving Thrak and moving Benny somehow makes it that much more magical.

603
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:46,150
Speaker 0: Some of the rules I've learned from the other puppeteers like I've been having on my show is, on Sesame Place, when they film in front of a live audience or on Sesame Street, on any of those, when the puppet is taken off the arm, it goes into a black trash bag so that the children never see a dead puppet.

604
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:57,938
Speaker 0: There is nothing friendlier or more satisfying than a live puppet talking at you, but the moment you set it in the corner, it is the darkest, scariest momento mori you will ever have.

605
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:05,530
Speaker 0: (laughing) 'Cause when Chucky, when a child's playing Chucky is talking, it's kind of funny, it's corny.

606
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:14,310
Speaker 0: Without a doubt, it's corny, but if he's just in the corner, just staring, not blinking, it is so inhuman, it's so unnerving, it just reminds us of creepy.

607
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:25,110
Speaker 1: - I will tell you, after I saw Child's Play when I was a young child, because I guess that was what my mom liked to do, show me horror movies, I remember I locked my buddy and my wrestling buddy in the closet.

608
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,840
Speaker 0: - They came out stronger than ever.

609
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,000
Speaker 0: No, I mean, how paralyzing was my fear of Child's Play?

610
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:40,280
Speaker 0: College, junior year of college, my room was next to the bathroom, as in, I didn't even have to step out and turn left.

611
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:57,695
Speaker 0: I could have done it in like a nice 75 degree turn if I just held onto my doorframe, and I couldn't step out because I just had this intense nightmare with Chucky, and it was only through like repeating lyrics from the on-campus band Fireflies, I was able to step off into the restroom, working the haunted house that I did back in Bucks County for 15 years.

612
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:47,880
Speaker 0: We have a replica of the Chucky doll that may or may not have been stolen from the set, that may or may not be canon, it's not for me to know, not for me to tell, but I would puppeteer George the skeleton, so my left hand would move his head and move his mouth, and my right hand had to move the hand, had to wear the glove, but to my left, no more than 15 feet away from me, who only has like a leg to defend himself because everything else is tucked into this corner to operate this puppet, is the Chucky doll with this strobe light flashing beneath him, so half the time, I can't see him because I'm backstage in a haunted house in total darkness, the other half, I can just make out that Chucky is still there, I'm not watching the audience, the whole night I'm thinking, okay, if he grabs a knife, I can bring up my knee and like whip kick him, he's small, he can't have any momentum, can't have any strength, I've got this, and I can beat him off with my left hand.

613
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:51,459
Speaker 0: if I free up the right hand, maybe my puppet can beat that puppet.

614
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,899
Speaker 2: - Skeleton, yeah, definitely.

615
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:03,200
Speaker 0: - I'm so scared of this son of a bitch, but it was finally working at that haunted house where I got over the fear of say Gremlins and Chucky, those were the two big things that I always saw in the darkness.

616
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,059
Speaker 1: - Oh, Gremlins, you know, I think we're in the same boat, when I was a kid, I didn't really get that was more comedy than horror.

617
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,800
Speaker 2: - Me either, I was a kid, I barely understood what I was seeing.

618
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,900
Speaker 1: - Like Beetlejuice too, I didn't get that Beetlejuice was supposed to be funny, I just thought it was a straight up for serious horror movie.

619
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,618
Speaker 1: - Yeah, me too.

620
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:27,680
Speaker 0: - Or like kids today watching Adventure Time, and you look at them, how are you laughing at this, do you not see what he just devoured, how that was dealt with, that was funny, he hit it with his butt.

621
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:38,018
Speaker 0: Oh God, they're completely desensitized, nope, they're just kids, I mean, kids can take apart anything that lays down still long enough, hello Mr.

622
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:42,195
Speaker 0: Worm, I wonder what you look like on the inside, whereas if you do it now, hello Mr.

623
00:39:42,235 --> 00:39:45,740
Speaker 0: Taxi Driver, I wonder what color your blood is, now we get arrested.

624
00:39:46,362 --> 00:39:49,338
Speaker 0: What happens in those times when we grow up, the magic is left.

625
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,840
Speaker 1: - Yeah, even in anime, I mean, Vampire Hunter D was the greatest thing I'd ever seen in my life.

626
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,339
Speaker 1: - Boobies.

627
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,540
Speaker 1: - Project Echo was a totally super, 100% serious, not a comedy story about a superhero girl.

628
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,140
Speaker 0: - More boobies.

629
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:01,900
Speaker 1: - Yeah, there were boobs in that.

630
00:40:03,146 --> 00:40:13,080
Speaker 0: - The first five minutes, I'm watching this, we were able to rent it from the video store, and it said clearly not for kids, my mom looked at the cover, oh, cartoon, it must be good for him.

631
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,660
Speaker 1: - Because usually the Disney stuff was literally right next to like Armageddon and Doom Megalopolis.

632
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,800
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the first tape, or even like volume four of Berserk, well it's a cartoon, so it must be like at worst, heavy metal.

633
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,559
Speaker 1: - Yup, and usually plague dogs hanging around in there too.

634
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,620
Speaker 2: - I guess you could tell how enlightened the blockbuster manager was based on where the videos were.

635
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Speaker 1: - They were under the Japanimation section.

636
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,280
Speaker 2: - Ugh.

637
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:44,480
Speaker 2: - Ours were actually next to like the Godzilla movies and stuff, pretty well organized.

638
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:47,959
Speaker 0: - You actually had a fan, you had an in guy.

639
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:51,079
Speaker 2: - Maybe, the selection wasn't any better, believe me.

640
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,559
Speaker 0: - Behind the desk and behind the curtain.

641
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,218
Speaker 0: Now if you wanted something good, you had to go to Funkoland for the $10 bid, that's how we discovered Bastard to this day.

642
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,679
Speaker 2: - I didn't discover Bastard 'til RIT.

643
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:07,540
Speaker 0: - Yeah, to this day it's still like George and I's favorite, we would do a thing at Purchase called Basterds and Baileys where we would introduce someone.

644
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,376
Speaker 1: - Anthraxia.

645
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:09,840
Speaker 2: - I think it's the Anthraxia.

646
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,199
Speaker 1: - Anthraxia, I haven't seen that in so long.

647
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:24,420
Speaker 0: - We would show someone all six episodes and then play The Darkness, I Believe in a Thing Called Love, but we also had this recipe for homemade Baileys Irish cream, so we would drink Baileys and watch Bastard and one of the final nights.

648
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,016
Speaker 2: - Is there a third B?

649
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,510
Speaker 2: Baileys, Bastard, and no?

650
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,220
Speaker 0: - Ballpipe?

651
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:28,818
Speaker 2: - Okay.

652
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:35,576
Speaker 0: - Oh, I've never, no I've never told you guys about Ballpipe, that is for a very different, the only man.

653
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,800
Speaker 1: - Is this 18 plus?

654
00:41:37,481 --> 00:41:51,520
Speaker 0: - The only man in the world who I could denote on the same level of almost sociopathical analytical critique and shameless charisma, on par with you, Rim, is a man named Pirate Dan Comstock.

655
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:54,279
Speaker 0: - Pirate Dan, I've heard Pirate Dan.

656
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,560
Speaker 0: - He is at Kineticon most years running the LARP.

657
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,860
Speaker 0: He ran Tales of the Dreaming, it was his original creation.

658
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:36,279
Speaker 0: His senior project was to become a certified experimental psychologist, but they, as pirates, they had terrible games such as the Hammer Game, Three Way Strangle, and then the epic that would be Ballpipe, which is you find a metal pipe, two guys rested on their scrotums, you count down from five, one guy pushes into the other guy until he stops, you count down from 10, then the other guy pushes as far as, and even though they had a tournament of this on the front park, UPD would not break it up because they realized all we can do is let them continue and help the gene pool, this is the best that we can do.

659
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:47,860
Speaker 0: And on the final nights of pirate television, the amazing Jesse Lear challenged Pirate Dan to Ballpipe, so you had two men, between the two of them weighed at least 92 pounds, playing Ballpipe.

660
00:42:48,062 --> 00:42:55,920
Speaker 0: It went to Extreme Ballpipe, where it poked through and tore through Jesse's genes, and then-- - I'm glad you said genes and not something else.

661
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:35,359
Speaker 0: - No, no, we had that incident too, because then it ran right, it cleared its way through Dan's boxers at that point, so it was simply, it was testy on testy, proving that nobody ever wins Ballpipe, until, until, I kid you not, they pushed into each other at the same time, and the bar, the metal bar, bent into a U-shape, to which they held it up and said, this is the wishbone that proves no one can win Ballpipe, so Bastard and Baileys, and our last year, we did a double batch of Baileys, we put it in one of those big hollow plastic tubs that you'd get like discount pretzels at like a Walgreens or what have you, and we froze it.

662
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:40,660
Speaker 0: So after like two hours in the freezer, it was a slushy, and I was with Pirate--.

663
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,799
Speaker 2: - Oh, I thought you were distilling it in the freezer.

664
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,288
Speaker 1: - No, I think fractional distillation of Baileys is a bad idea.

665
00:43:46,308 --> 00:43:48,086
Speaker 2: - I was gonna say, I'm like, did it ever come?

666
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:49,118
Speaker 2: you're not blind right now?

667
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:50,778
Speaker 0: - Temporarily.

668
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:59,440
Speaker 0: It was, we ended up doing double the whiskey content, because we were with Pirate Mike, and the rule is you open the bottle, you end the Jameson.

669
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:08,440
Speaker 0: So I can't remember, but there was, there's like part A, B, and C in the story, and for me, we finished watching, showing actually Kristen Benedict.

670
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,354
Speaker 0: We first showed her, Bastard.

671
00:44:11,742 --> 00:44:14,599
Speaker 0: A is me standing up saying, let's go to the hub before it closes.

672
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,560
Speaker 0: C is me waking up with my head on top of the Xbox saying, my head hurts now.

673
00:44:21,321 --> 00:44:23,015
Speaker 0: B was apparently one of those season.

674
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:25,040
Speaker 0: one family guy cuts away to collapse.

675
00:44:26,504 --> 00:44:26,660
Speaker 0: Good?

676
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:28,239
Speaker 0: Ah, I gotta make that recipe again.

677
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:41,660
Speaker 0: 'Cause you can actually taste a little bit of the coffee, you taste a little hint of the chocolate, but it's mainly, if you're a creamy fan, which I definitely am all the way, it is a wonderful after dinner cocktail to sip, and I should still have that recipe.

678
00:44:42,103 --> 00:44:44,779
Speaker 0: If not, my step sister's mother definitely does.

679
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:48,580
Speaker 0: That is the big project.

680
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,560
Speaker 0: It is a fantasy sitcom.

681
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:59,999
Speaker 0: Dungeon Crawlers is a fantasy sitcom about monsters living in a dungeon, in a fantasy campaign, but they must first survive being roommates.

682
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:05,280
Speaker 2: - Have you read D'Anjean, the comic, by Jean Sverre?

683
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,209
Speaker 0: - French, isn't it?

684
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,636
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

685
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:08,805
Speaker 1: - Yep.

686
00:45:09,472 --> 00:45:10,410
Speaker 0: - Do you have a copy of that, Ryan?

687
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,390
Speaker 2: - I have all the volume.

688
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:12,230
Speaker 1: - Scott owns everything.

689
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:13,250
Speaker 1: I don't buy comics anymore.

690
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,190
Speaker 0: - Okay, I remember the name, but I have not looked into it.

691
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,390
Speaker 2: - Yeah, you should get into that.

692
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,346
Speaker 2: It's not the same as what you're doing.

693
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:23,030
Speaker 2: - At least the zenith arc is worth reading.

694
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,190
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but it's got some of those elements, and also feathers.

695
00:45:27,531 --> 00:45:33,190
Speaker 1: So I guess we're at the portion where we get into the more rapid fire short answer questions, like we did with other people.

696
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,430
Speaker 1: We've done this profile in Geek, which not that many people.

697
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,830
Speaker 1: You're joining a hallowed hall of personalities.

698
00:45:41,173 --> 00:45:42,070
Speaker 2: - The handful of people.

699
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,170
Speaker 0: - I think I've had more guests on my podcast than you guys.

700
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,509
Speaker 2: - We don't do guests very often.

701
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:48,850
Speaker 1: - Kind of like how we don't take questions at our panels.

702
00:45:49,071 --> 00:45:53,090
Speaker 1: We were just thinking, in fucking Lancaster, at Zenkai Con, every lecture panel we did.

703
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,390
Speaker 2: - There's one guy we had to tell him, literally, we don't take questions.

704
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:57,142
Speaker 2: He's like, "No, but

705
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:57,510
Speaker 2: seriously.".

706
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,404
Speaker 2: I'm like, "We don't take

707
00:45:58,424 --> 00:45:58,830
Speaker 2: questions.".

708
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:04,650
Speaker 1: - Well, there's the guy in the back who kept raising his hand, and then he got really mad when I said something about candy candy.

709
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:06,270
Speaker 2: - But Carl, you're gonna take questions.

710
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,069
Speaker 0: - I think I know exactly who you were talking about.

711
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:11,430
Speaker 0: - He's a sweetheart on the internet.

712
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,229
Speaker 1: - So what was the first anime you ever saw that you knew was anime?

713
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:20,890
Speaker 0: - That I actually knew was anime was Project Echo, 'cause I knew it was from Japan, and I knew that it was not for me to watch.

714
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:24,070
Speaker 1: - We'll alternate.

715
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,270
Speaker 2: - Oh, we'll alternate?

716
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:26,890
Speaker 2: Okay, that makes it easier.

717
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:35,089
Speaker 2: What is the movie, not necessarily the best movie or your favorite movie, but the movie that you could watch 10 million times and not get tired of it?

718
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,689
Speaker 0: - Perfect Blue and Hedwig and the Angry Inch.

719
00:46:37,033 --> 00:46:39,089
Speaker 0: It has been since high school, and I think it always will be.

720
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,250
Speaker 0: Perfect Blue, I see it differently every single-- I should see it again.

721
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,450
Speaker 0: - Every single time something else comes out.

722
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,590
Speaker 0: There's something about the coloration, something about the mise-en-scene.

723
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:50,530
Speaker 2: - Right, it's short answers, but yeah, everyone knows Perfect Blue is awesome.

724
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,649
Speaker 1: - Have we ever reviewed that on the show?

725
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,550
Speaker 2: - No, but we should.

726
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:54,830
Speaker 1: - We should, I could watch it again.

727
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,190
Speaker 2: - Wednesday episode, done.

728
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:58,649
Speaker 0: - Woo, J-pop and K-pop, taken aback.

729
00:46:59,913 --> 00:47:02,110
Speaker 0: Predicted Britney Spears' downfall before Britney Spears.

730
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,869
Speaker 1: - What is the worst major motion picture you watched all the way to the end?

731
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:06,490
Speaker 0: - FernGully.

732
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,590
Speaker 0: - FernGully's not that bad.

733
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:09,609
Speaker 0: - The first FernGully.

734
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,370
Speaker 2: - I like FernGully.

735
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:19,270
Speaker 0: - FernGully for me was a turning point 'cause it was the first time I watched something that was animated, and within 10 minutes I turned to my father and say, "Dad, I think this is bad.

736
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:22,344
Speaker 0: "I think this is a bad, dumb

737
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:23,370
Speaker 0: movie.".

738
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,389
Speaker 0: He goes, "Yes, it is.

739
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,053
Speaker 0: "Happy

740
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:26,519
Speaker 0: birthday.".

741
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,230
Speaker 1: - Wow, Band of Brothers.

742
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:35,468
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, for me it was Clifford with Martin Short playing a 10-year-old boy, and I remember that was the moment when we were watching it.

743
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:45,030
Speaker 1: My whole family and my dad just stands up about a half hour in and says, "This is terrible," and walks out of the room, and in that moment I realized you don't have to watch a movie to the end.

744
00:47:45,591 --> 00:47:46,528
Speaker 1: You can just turn it off.

745
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:54,790
Speaker 0: - I didn't know you could even leave the audience until I saw Jack Nicholson's Wolf in the theater, and I stepped up because it's the first 10 minutes.

746
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,610
Speaker 1: - Oh my god, I just remembered that movie.

747
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,227
Speaker 0: - The first 10 minutes of the movie.

748
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:01,449
Speaker 0: I was, "Oh no, don't go up to the wolf, "the wolf's gonna bite you, "the wolf's gonna bite you, "the wolf's gonna bite you,".

749
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:09,449
Speaker 0: and I had actually been, I have been assaulted by wolves in my lifetime, so I did not want to see that on a big screen where there was nowhere for me to escape to.

750
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:10,488
Speaker 1: - You didn't miss much.

751
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:11,890
Speaker 2: - Yo, you work in a restaurant.

752
00:48:12,131 --> 00:48:14,449
Speaker 2: What's the best restaurant you've eaten at, and what'd you eat there?

753
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:17,250
Speaker 0: - Best restaurant that I have eaten at.

754
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:21,970
Speaker 0: Okay, in recent memory over the last couple years, I'm gonna go with Burgatory out in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

755
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:30,370
Speaker 0: Parallel to that is 5320 where they do alcoholic milkshakes made with ice cream that is churned in that restaurant.

756
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:34,330
Speaker 0: It is placed on buns baked in that restaurant.

757
00:48:34,673 --> 00:48:38,329
Speaker 0: It is fed with cows that are grown three miles outside of that restaurant.

758
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:39,568
Speaker 0: Talk about local.

759
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,530
Speaker 1: - What foods do you not like or not eat?

760
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:44,910
Speaker 0: - At this point, I really don't do, I don't do steak.

761
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:56,309
Speaker 0: I will give almost anything a shot, but I never knew foods that I would not touch until after Kat tried everything with me because the Chinese-- Maybe that's the best way to end it.

762
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:57,050
Speaker 0: I will just say that they--.

763
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:57,950
Speaker 0: - That's 'cause we know Kat.

764
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,090
Speaker 0: - We've been down that road.

765
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,361
Speaker 0: - They, Native Americans, and zombies have the same format of.

766
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:03,549
Speaker 0: it's fine, chew it.

767
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,010
Speaker 1: - What is it?

768
00:49:05,131 --> 00:49:05,669
Speaker 1: Eat it first.

769
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,449
Speaker 0: - Eat it first and then we'll tell you.

770
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:08,610
Speaker 2: - Eat it this.

771
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,290
Speaker 2: Oh, it's pig's ear sliced real thin.

772
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:11,430
Speaker 2: Great, it's unchewable.

773
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:12,622
Speaker 2: - It's fine, chew it.

774
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:14,469
Speaker 2: - It tastes fine, it tastes like bacon.

775
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,730
Speaker 0: - It's like there's mooing and then two seconds in boiling hot water.

776
00:49:18,053 --> 00:49:18,749
Speaker 0: It's safe now.

777
00:49:19,273 --> 00:49:20,428
Speaker 0: I don't believe you.

778
00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:22,429
Speaker 0: Where'd you buy this?

779
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:23,709
Speaker 0: Charnet town, it is not safe.

780
00:49:24,553 --> 00:49:26,350
Speaker 0: There's a hermit crab that just crawled out of the bok choy.

781
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:27,049
Speaker 0: It's fine.

782
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:33,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, something plastic just like broke off the sky.

783
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,319
Speaker 2: - Yeah, something broke on my chair.

784
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:34,939
Speaker 2: It's very strange.

785
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,780
Speaker 1: - That chair is so ancient.

786
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,479
Speaker 2: - Alright, what video game are you playing right now?

787
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,180
Speaker 0: - The only thing that could even constitute an asset and I don't think that it does is Candy Crush Saga.

788
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:46,600
Speaker 0: - It counts.

789
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:47,840
Speaker 0: - Okay, okay.

790
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:48,798
Speaker 0: I wanna get in.

791
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,140
Speaker 2: - Is it a piece of software?

792
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:50,838
Speaker 2: Is it a game?

793
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:59,379
Speaker 0: - Okay, last six months I've had Chris Troy's copy of Final Fantasy IX and because Dungeon Crawlers came up and I went back to work, have not had the time to touch it.

794
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,074
Speaker 0: - Join the club.

795
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,179
Speaker 0: - I want it.

796
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:02,440
Speaker 0: I wanna play it so bad.

797
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,658
Speaker 0: - Do you like the JRPGs?

798
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,040
Speaker 0: - No, I just wanna play through Final Fantasy IX.

799
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,100
Speaker 0: I love the character design and I loved watching my friend Dave run through it.

800
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,657
Speaker 0: I don't have the time or patience to commit to another Final Fantasy.

801
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,221
Speaker 2: - The only Final Fantasy IX I ever played was.

802
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,440
Speaker 2: I just watched Greasy Ken play the first two hours.

803
00:50:19,163 --> 00:50:19,756
Speaker 2: The day it came out.

804
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:23,600
Speaker 0: - They didn't even get to transit at two hours into it.

805
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,039
Speaker 2: - I spent a lot of time playing some card game with NPCs.

806
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:33,438
Speaker 1: - Oh yeah, I remember watching Luke Morgan pretty much play all of Final Fantasy VIII or X. I'm not sure.

807
00:50:34,123 --> 00:50:39,620
Speaker 0: - We spent a whole school semester breeding that goddamn golden chocobo and then another semester mastering Knights of the Round.

808
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:41,919
Speaker 0: It may or may not have been worth it.

809
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:49,298
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I remember spending a lot of time fighting dinosaurs so that I could have my entire party in Final Fantasy VI just cast Ultima over and over and over again.

810
00:50:50,783 --> 00:50:55,779
Speaker 1: I held down A with one character and beat Kefka and then I realized I hated JRPGs.

811
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,160
Speaker 2: - I realized that long before.

812
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,079
Speaker 1: - I think it was the last one I played earnestly.

813
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,240
Speaker 2: - I stopped playing them after high school.

814
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,240
Speaker 0: - I just don't think that they've matched the fun story and innovativeness that was Final Fantasy VI.

815
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,559
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if anything that has come along that's really captured or been that unique for me.

816
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,620
Speaker 0: - Well, Chrono Trigger.

817
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,055
Speaker 0: - Those two.

818
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,179
Speaker 0: - You put those two on par, yeah.

819
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,660
Speaker 0: For me, I don't think something has beaten Chrono Trigger.

820
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,718
Speaker 1: - I agree there.

821
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,095
Speaker 2: - No.

822
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,940
Speaker 0: - As far as JRPG goes, have other genres broken through that?

823
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:29,059
Speaker 0: Do you want to argue that Mass Effect redid first person shooter or maybe third person shooter or RPG?

824
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:35,140
Speaker 0: You could definitely make that argument, but in terms of JRPGs, for that time, it was Chrono Trigger.

825
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,499
Speaker 2: - Barkley shut up and jammed Gaiden.

826
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,170
Speaker 1: - Kill la kill.

827
00:51:40,373 --> 00:51:40,920
Speaker 1: Is it awesome?

828
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:44,320
Speaker 0: - No, because it's fabulously awesome, mother fucker.

829
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,740
Speaker 2: - Ram, you're asking two easy questions.

830
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:49,996
Speaker 1: - Too small.

831
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,219
Speaker 1: - I'm just trying to move quickly to put the pressure on you to ask better questions.

832
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:54,479
Speaker 2: - Lightning round.

833
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:55,359
Speaker 1: - Everything's a game.

834
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,120
Speaker 1: Someone we know just read Use of Weapons.

835
00:51:59,261 --> 00:52:00,158
Speaker 1: I'm using weapons.

836
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:06,760
Speaker 2: You know, you've never seen, I've never seen you really interested in anything sporty or athletic, but you are not unfit.

837
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,800
Speaker 2: Are you doing sport in secret?

838
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,800
Speaker 0: - Am I sporting in secret?

839
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,800
Speaker 0: I have my push-ups and set-up regiment that I've done most of my life.

840
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,820
Speaker 0: I have never liked team sports.

841
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,360
Speaker 0: I've never been physically an active team player.

842
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,240
Speaker 0: I really just ended up to my father's genes.

843
00:52:22,581 --> 00:52:33,298
Speaker 0: He set records at Penbury High School in Pennsylvania that remained unbroken for a good 15 years, and thankfully, I got enough of that DNA plus my mother's immune system.

844
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:42,999
Speaker 0: I'm pretty okay, but it takes no effort for me to get fat suddenly, but it takes, thankfully, not P90X effort to kind of lose it.

845
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:44,815
Speaker 0: - Just regular P90?

846
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:46,434
Speaker 0: - Just regular P90.

847
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,065
Speaker 0: - P80?

848
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,860
Speaker 0: - I just always wear dark clothing.

849
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:53,420
Speaker 1: - Oh, gotta do the vertical stripes and the flat form shoes, but Simpson style?

850
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,180
Speaker 0: - Simpson style, and walking a chihuahua as well, spike up the hair.

851
00:52:56,521 --> 00:52:58,079
Speaker 0: Every comedian wears black because it's slimming.

852
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,299
Speaker 0: However, I don't wear clothing that fits me appropriately.

853
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:02,920
Speaker 0: One of these days, I will.

854
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,800
Speaker 1: - What authors do you like?

855
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,440
Speaker 1: Do you have any particularly favored authors of novels?

856
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:09,819
Speaker 0: - Novels, particularly.

857
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,260
Speaker 0: Neil Gaiman and Neil Stevenson stand out for me.

858
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:13,600
Speaker 0: - All the Neils.

859
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,779
Speaker 0: - All the Neils.

860
00:53:15,686 --> 00:53:16,120
Speaker 0: Graphic novels.

861
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:25,420
Speaker 0: I am running back through Mike Carey's run of Lucifer, the spinoff to Neil Gaiman's The Sandman, and I love how that guy goes back and forth and everything.

862
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,160
Speaker 0: I love the scope of that story.

863
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,668
Speaker 0: His other book, The Unwritten, I've not gotten into just yet.

864
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:33,318
Speaker 0: It wrapped up, didn't it?

865
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,440
Speaker 2: - I don't know.

866
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,315
Speaker 2: I have a lot of trades.

867
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:36,519
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's over yet.

868
00:53:38,261 --> 00:53:39,735
Speaker 0: And then Mark Weed as well.

869
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:47,460
Speaker 0: I like any story that he gets the chance and has the time to flesh out those characters, get into their skin, get into their dialogue.

870
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,669
Speaker 1: - Marge's got.

871
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:50,320
Speaker 1: last question.

872
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:54,660
Speaker 2: - What is the farthest away convention you went to?

873
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,820
Speaker 2: Can you beat R Australia?

874
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:56,740
Speaker 0: - I cannot.

875
00:53:57,986 --> 00:54:03,460
Speaker 0: It was Anime Expo, which was a communitive and collective effort from the entire family.

876
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,980
Speaker 2: - I was hoping that you maybe went away to a con, like some weird place in Canada or something.

877
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:07,620
Speaker 0: - Lord knows.

878
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,960
Speaker 1: - Because that's further away than Australia.

879
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,740
Speaker 0: - I would fly out to Dubai to do a show.

880
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,339
Speaker 2: - Northern Territories is farther away than Australia.

881
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:15,100
Speaker 0: Woo!

882
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:17,959
Speaker 0: - Anime Expo for me.

883
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,740
Speaker 2: - I still haven't been to Anime Expo.

884
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,440
Speaker 2: I don't know if I will.

885
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,878
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you wanna just go to Soccer a Con first.

886
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,038
Speaker 2: - Probably, maybe.

887
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:25,489
Speaker 1: - Someday.

888
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,180
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that was a joke.

889
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,260
Speaker 1: I'm never going to Soccer a Con.

890
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:29,800
Speaker 0: - You're in loathing.

891
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,418
Speaker 0: - All right.

892
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,420
Speaker 1: I think on that note, I'm really fucking hungry.

893
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:33,320
Speaker 2: - I'm really hungry.

894
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,840
Speaker 2: The weather is too nice, everyone.

895
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,959
Speaker 2: - When the weather's fine.
