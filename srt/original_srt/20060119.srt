1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,171
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, January 19th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:17,361
Speaker 1: Tonight, Conventions Part 2.

3
00:00:17,361 --> 00:00:18,073
Speaker 1: Let's do this!

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,500
Speaker 1: Alright, so my work is sort of in the process of transferring me from the New York City office to the middle-of-fuck-no-where office.

5
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:39,680
Speaker 1: So, on Wednesday, I had to go work in this office, which meant an hour drive both ways, because locksmith was coming, and I had to let him in and write the amount of money on the check to pay him.

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,907
Speaker 1: And when I got there, the power was out.

7
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,620
Speaker 1: This makes it very difficult for a computer programmer to do any work.

8
00:00:49,562 --> 00:00:57,120
Speaker 1: And it just really sucked, especially driving there on this windy, middle-of-the-woods road with sticks falling out of the sky, hitting my car.

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,380
Speaker 0: Well, that was due to the fact that we had a freakish kind of weather pattern storm going on here.

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just like in crazy rain and crazy wind, and that was it.

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,980
Speaker 0: I mean, despite the fact that we live in New York State, and that we live in an area that's generally very cold in the winter, it's been 50, 60 degrees, sunny, rainy, thunderstorms.

12
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:26,720
Speaker 1: There was so much rain, I almost, like, pulled over the car a couple times, because I just couldn't see, even with my wipers going as fast as they go.

13
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:33,337
Speaker 1: But it just generally sucked, and I ended up just coming home at one and being like, "Screw this.

14
00:01:33,357 --> 00:01:33,558
Speaker 1: Screw

15
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:33,678
Speaker 1: it.".

16
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:42,200
Speaker 0: Now, interestingly enough, today, when I got home from work, I, you know, did the usual "I'm home, lift some weights," whatever, and then I go take a shower.

17
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,973
Speaker 0: And as I'm taking my shower, power goes out.

18
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,340
Speaker 1: Damn it.

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:57,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, I drove up to the house from the train station today, and I noticed the entire block, the street lights aren't on, and all the houses are dark, and I'm like, "Power's out, isn't

20
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:57,159
Speaker 1: it?".

21
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,535
Speaker 1: And I see this truck at the end of the street, and I'm like,

22
00:01:59,716 --> 00:01:59,918
Speaker 1: "Fuck.".

23
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:13,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, the thing is, they were working on something when I came home, up the street, and then while I was in the shower, they moved the truck to another spot, like one step down before our house, and they cut the power off, and then they went back over to where they were working.

24
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,580
Speaker 1: How did you see them do that if you were in the shower?

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,791
Speaker 0: 'Cause when I got home, they were at the end of the street working.

26
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,920
Speaker 0: I go into the shower, and the power goes out.

27
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,480
Speaker 0: So I get up, and I remember I saw guys working, so I look out the window, and now they're at the other end of the side.

28
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:27,579
Speaker 0: And they're up in the cherry picker messing with it.

29
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,660
Speaker 0: And then they go back to the first spot again and start working.

30
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:33,153
Speaker 0: And I sat there thinking,

31
00:02:33,193 --> 00:02:33,375
Speaker 0: "Crap.".

32
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:38,800
Speaker 0: Like twice, I sat down by my computer to try and do something and realized I couldn't.

33
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, that happens all the time.

34
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,837
Speaker 1: Like, especially when, like, the internet will be down, but the power will be on, and you'll sit at the computer and be like, "Yeah, I'm just gonna check my

35
00:02:47,878 --> 00:02:48,118
Speaker 1: fuck.".

36
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,449
Speaker 1: "I'm just gonna visit/the

37
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:49,651
Speaker 1: fuck.".

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,733
Speaker 0: Fine, I'll just play Counter-Strike.

39
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,319
Speaker 1: God damn it.

40
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

41
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:59,280
Speaker 0: So we got an email from an Eric G. of Newton, Kansas.

42
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,920
Speaker 1: This is apparently the guy who was listening to the show with his PSP.

43
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,100
Speaker 0: Yep, well he's one of actually three people who listen to the show on their PSPs now.

44
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,839
Speaker 1: Two more people started doing it?

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's better.

46
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:11,120
Speaker 0: He's two more.

47
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:23,100
Speaker 0: Now, basically he explained that the way he uses it is that apparently the 2.6 firmware update of the PSP, despite the fact that it breaks, you know, all your emulators and those hacks...

48
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,000
Speaker 1: Actually, I heard that, like, now that they can get everything working.

49
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,860
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, but if you had the old style ones, you gotta redo it all.

50
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:30,267
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess.

51
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:30,931
Speaker 1: I don't know.

52
00:03:30,972 --> 00:03:37,660
Speaker 1: I don't know the details, but... I know that the real-life guy has every emulator with ROMs for all of them, for every console, working.

53
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:47,360
Speaker 0: And basically, anyway, this firmware adds a web browser that has RSS capabilities, so you can subscribe to basically any podcast or any RSS, trivially.

54
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,540
Speaker 1: See, that's what the iPod really needs, is iTunes in the iPod.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,880
Speaker 1: So while I'm... without plugging it into a computer, I can download new podcasts on my iPod.

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:04,999
Speaker 1: That's... you know, the PSP is still too big to be... even though it can do this, it's still too big with the, you know, this extra stuff on it.

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:13,956
Speaker 1: But if you made the iPod a little bigger and threw in, like, a little wireless card or something, maybe like a Nano with a wireless card attached, that would be the shit.

58
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:14,900
Speaker 1: That would be awesome.

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,418
Speaker 0: Now, he also asked us how the hell we knew he was using the PSP.

60
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:23,580
Speaker 0: And basically we have two mechanisms for knowing exactly who's listening to this show.

61
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:31,500
Speaker 0: One, if you visit our site with a web browser and download the MP3, your web browser has a thing in it called a user agent string.

62
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:35,360
Speaker 0: And it basically tells us exactly what web browser you're using.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,965
Speaker 0: Of course, you might change it.

64
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,160
Speaker 0: Some people just put funny stuff in there, or they pretend to be IE or whatever.

65
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:44,520
Speaker 0: But we generally know about how many Firefox and Opera and IE users visit the site.

66
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,003
Speaker 1: And we know all sorts of things.

67
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:53,146
Speaker 1: Like, if you're visiting, like, Slashdot, and then you click on a link on Slashdot that takes you to our site, I see.

68
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,640
Speaker 1: Hey, one person from Slashdot came over to our site.

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,940
Speaker 1: And there's all kinds of stuff that, you know, you can use to figure out who's doing what on your website.

70
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,198
Speaker 1: It's never exact, but as the number of users you get increase, it's usually about 90% correct.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,060
Speaker 1: So the amount of effect the error has doesn't, you know, mess with the stats so much.

72
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,080
Speaker 0: Well, that was an interesting way of explaining statistics.

73
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:18,656
Speaker 1: Yeah.

74
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:30,620
Speaker 0: Basically, to sum that up, the more visitors you have, while the individual data are usually inaccurate or useless, in aggregate, the data is actually very useful because statistically all the outliers get eliminated.

75
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:33,620
Speaker 1: But if you have, like, three visitors, it's pretty much useless.

76
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,260
Speaker 0: Now, if you subscribe to the RSS, we have a normal feed for the site, but we also have the podcast feed, and that's what iTunes looks at.

77
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:51,320
Speaker 0: And we use FeedBurner to do that just because FeedBurner adds all that iTunes-specific BS that you need to get popular on iTunes.

78
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:58,760
Speaker 0: And we weren't going to modify our own site to do it, so we basically burn our feed through FeedBurner and then back and then out to you.

79
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:07,620
Speaker 0: And in addition to doing all that, it gives us a bunch of statistics, like, it tells us all the different clients that access the feed and what they use and how often they hit it.

80
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,419
Speaker 0: We know exactly how many Windows users versus Mac users are subscribed to the RSS.

81
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,680
Speaker 0: And, yeah, there are three of you out there using the PSP, so kudos to Eric for actually answering our question to you other two bastards.

82
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,692
Speaker 0: Well, uh...

83
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:23,681
Speaker 1: Yep.

84
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:30,640
Speaker 1: I don't think they were listening before, because I remember when we checked the first time, they were only one person with a PSP.

85
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,496
Speaker 0: Yeah.

86
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,620
Speaker 0: Though Eric seems like a cool guy, he's into robotics and all the stuff that we were into in high school.

87
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:37,302
Speaker 1: Yep.

88
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:40,814
Speaker 1: Little 16-year-old high school kid from Kansas seems pretty cool.

89
00:06:42,118 --> 00:06:42,620
Speaker 1: Keep listening.

90
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,556
Speaker 1: And, uh, to the rest of you, send cool emails and we will also, uh, respond to them on the show in kind.

91
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,100
Speaker 1: Unless they suck at emails.

92
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,473
Speaker 0: Nah, I think if an email sucks, we'll be more likely to respond to it.

93
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,860
Speaker 0: You just might not like our response.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,060
Speaker 1: Well, quite possibly, but, yeah, this is encouragement to, uh, be more like Eric here.

95
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:08,800
Speaker 0: 'Cause actually, he offered to show us a lot about how the PSP works, 'cause we're not that familiar with him.

96
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Speaker 0: So we might get some audio feedback from him in the future, maybe a little, uh, bit or something.

97
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember, you can always call the, uh, voicemail.

98
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,132
Speaker 1: Do you mean 206-333-1537?

99
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, the secret there is that we actually paused the recording and edited out the part where we fumbled around and looked for the number.

100
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,265
Speaker 1: I had it.

101
00:07:28,325 --> 00:07:29,151
Speaker 1: I didn't have to fumble.

102
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,139
Speaker 1: I just, um...

103
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,260
Speaker 0: You had to fumble a little bit.

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,497
Speaker 1: I had it right away, but I didn't know if it was the right one.

105
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:35,303
Speaker 0: Ha.

106
00:07:35,323 --> 00:07:42,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, 'cause you had a problem before where you told everyone it wasn't actually the number to call, it was the number of that other audio feedback we got that we haven't played yet.

107
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's alright, but... Yeah.

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:58,840
Speaker 1: You can either call that number and leave a message or just record your own MP3 or whatever and then email it to, uh, geekknights@gmail.com or put it on your website and then send us a link at geekknights@gmail.com or whatever.

109
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're working on setting up Skype to where if we really want to talk to someone, we'll just do a quick audio conference.

110
00:08:03,572 --> 00:08:06,760
Speaker 0: We're fine-tuning the details of that, but more to come.

111
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we'll need a new computer before we can do that.

112
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:09,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

113
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:17,520
Speaker 0: Though in my ever-present quest for a new computer, I accidentally shredded the credit card I was gonna use to buy the computer.

114
00:08:18,528 --> 00:08:18,718
Speaker 1: Awesome.

115
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:31,520
Speaker 0: Well, I was getting rid of old pieces of paper and old, just old, uh, documents, and I was cutting them up, and I saw what I thought was an empty envelope, and I went snip, and I met resistance, and I looked inside to find my old credit card cut in half.

116
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:32,285
Speaker 1: Hm?

117
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,091
Speaker 0: Luckily, I called and I told the credit card company what happened, and they laughed and they mailed me a new one.

118
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:40,140
Speaker 0: So I'm probably gonna order a new PC as soon as that thing arrives.

119
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,424
Speaker 1: That's not the story you told me.

120
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,340
Speaker 1: You told me, like, you lost the credit card, or you don't know what happened to it.

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,423
Speaker 0: No, I know what happened to it.

122
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:48,933
Speaker 0: Well, what it was is I didn't want to use it back when I was, you know, poor and in debt.

123
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,240
Speaker 0: I had two credit cards, keep in mind, in college.

124
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,526
Speaker 0: And because I was poor, I maxed them both out, paying for things like food.

125
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,817
Speaker 0: One of them I lost, which was fine because I, uh, never paid that one back.

126
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:00,940
Speaker 0: That's a long story.

127
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:07,540
Speaker 0: And maybe we'll do one someday on how you can have awesome credit no matter what you do, because the system's kinda broken.

128
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:18,199
Speaker 0: The other one I kept, but it was also maxed out and useless, but that one I paid back down to zero, and I just didn't use it for two years after that, and I finally wanted to use it again, and, uh...

129
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:20,420
Speaker 1: Alright.

130
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:28,800
Speaker 0: So in the news, Google, our wonderful friend, gave the giant finger to the federal government, and I am very pleased with this.

131
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:40,958
Speaker 1: Yup, it shows that even, no matter how much we think Google's becoming big and evil, it's still, to this day, not yet, even though it's definitely still the status of impending doom.

132
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,420
Speaker 1: It is not yet doom.

133
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,040
Speaker 0: Yup.

134
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,900
Speaker 1: So rest easily tonight, at least.

135
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,523
Speaker 0: I mean, basically what this is, is back.

136
00:09:48,563 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 0: a while ago, the Bush administration tried to push through this, uh, Internet Child Protection Act, and, among other things, its main thing was that it makes it illegal to provide pornographic content anywhere on the internet, without controls in place to make sure minors don't access it.

137
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,620
Speaker 1: What if my website is hosted in, you know, Kajikistan?

138
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:16,880
Speaker 0: Oh, or, you know, what if your definition of pornography differs from someone else's, or you just happen to have naked pictures of yourself on a website?

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, Flickr has people put up naked pictures.

140
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,520
Speaker 0: Plus, considering that there's almost no way to verify someone's age online, I mean, really, no way.

141
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:26,300
Speaker 1: Not at all.

142
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:32,679
Speaker 0: This law is just bullshit, and the Supreme Court's thought the same, and they voted almost unanimously to get rid of this law two years ago.

143
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,245
Speaker 1: Mhm.

144
00:10:34,182 --> 00:10:35,499
Speaker 0: And, Bush is trying to bring it back.

145
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:36,480
Speaker 0: Good job.

146
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:51,320
Speaker 0: And, in order to do so, they've got a task force, and a federal judge requested Google to send them basically every single search that was made on Google over an entire week, so that they could assess how much porn is accessible on the internet.

147
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,403
Speaker 1: Wow.

148
00:10:53,685 --> 00:10:53,898
Speaker 0: Yeah.

149
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:02,578
Speaker 0: Uh, Google said, and I think it's very succinct and to the point, "Google is not a party to this lawsuit, and the demand for the information is

150
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:03,159
Speaker 0: overreaching.".

151
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:08,234
Speaker 0: And, they went on to say that they will fight the government's effort

152
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:09,077
Speaker 0: "vigorously.".

153
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:15,100
Speaker 1: So, the "do no evil" motto still holding up?

154
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it really wouldn't have hurt them to hand the data over.

155
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,760
Speaker 0: I'm sure they could fairly easily, but I'm glad that they're standing up for my right to search for porn.

156
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:28,080
Speaker 1: Yup, because God knows porn is so hard to find, you need Google to help.

157
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:49,950
Speaker 0: Alright, so, in the spirit of having things of the day that tick me off a lot more than they entertain you, I got another little bit of Randy that I don't know if you're all familiar with, but you might find entertaining and/or scary.

158
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:59,150
Speaker 0: Now, I'm linking to the Wikipedia article involving it, because I've actually been involved in heavily editing this article for a number of weeks.

159
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:09,870
Speaker 0: And, crackpots seem to keep un-editing it, and it's poorly written to begin with for a number of reasons, so I assure you that the grammar and spelling are not mine.

160
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,190
Speaker 0: I've mostly added the words "supposedly" and "allegedly" and "so they claim" to this thing, more than anything else.

161
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:25,448
Speaker 0: But, basically, there are a couple of crackpots, Lee Carroll and Jan Tober, who came up with the idea of "Indigo

162
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:25,989
Speaker 0: children."

163
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:29,482
Speaker 0: Does that mean children with, like, skin?

164
00:12:29,603 --> 00:12:31,510
Speaker 1: that is, like, one of the colors of the rainbow?

165
00:12:32,071 --> 00:12:33,750
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, see, that would be sane.

166
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:41,670
Speaker 0: It turns out that, well, first of all, according to these two, well, I'll go with Lee, because he's the one who's really the advocate of this.

167
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:52,330
Speaker 0: These are magic special children who were born starting in the year 1982, but with increasing frequency, a-peaking around 1994.

168
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,483
Speaker 0: And they're called "Indigo children" because they have a "Indigo-hued

169
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:56,166
Speaker 0: aura.".

170
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:58,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, aura.

171
00:12:59,072 --> 00:12:59,725
Speaker 1: I was born in '82.

172
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:01,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, so was I.

173
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,049
Speaker 1: Do I have an aura that's indigo?

174
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,470
Speaker 0: I don't know, I'm looking, and, uh, your aura kinda looks like, uh, pseudoscience to me.

175
00:13:09,294 --> 00:13:12,290
Speaker 1: I look at you, and where the aura should be, I see air.

176
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,670
Speaker 0: Ah, ah, yeah, I guess we're not indigo children.

177
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:17,690
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't even see the air, I see the wall.

178
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:19,164
Speaker 1: What does that mean?

179
00:13:20,914 --> 00:13:21,930
Speaker 0: Uh, it might mean you're smart.

180
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:22,575
Speaker 1: Oh.

181
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, now, basically, this is, this is really kinda scary.

182
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:34,990
Speaker 0: The more you might look into this, I recommend you read the article if you don't believe that there are a lot of stupid people out there in the world who are trying to destroy everything good and knowledgeable.

183
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:49,910
Speaker 0: But, basically, these people believe that these children, who were born in this time period, are magic and special, and are either aliens, or a hybrid alien, or maybe they're messiahs, but the basic thing is that they're gifted.

184
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,710
Speaker 0: They come into this world, and they're here to save us from all evil and usher in a new era.

185
00:13:55,571 --> 00:14:00,768
Speaker 0: But, in actuality, they're most likely just normal kids with possibly ADHD.

186
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:12,350
Speaker 0: And this is just a system that allows parents who have a troubled child to believe that that child is somehow gifted or special, when, in fact, that child just needs professional help.

187
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,629
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what this is about.

188
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:30,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, so a parent will have a child who, you know, is maybe not the brightest kid, or they're having a lot of trouble in school, and instead of, you know, helping the kid learn, they'll decide that the child is an indigo child, and that they're actually a genius, they're just misunderstood.

189
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:40,910
Speaker 0: And that to send them to a normal school would be a crime, and thus they send them to these special schools, and it's a lot like Xavier's School for the Gifted if mutants didn't exist.

190
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:42,655
Speaker 1: Uh...

191
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:52,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, these are some crazy nutjobs, and I guess the scary part about this is that there are tens and hundreds of thousands of people around the world who believe in this.

192
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,130
Speaker 0: There are actual scientists who, for some reason, think this is legitimate.

193
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,630
Speaker 0: Really?

194
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:08,950
Speaker 0: I guess they're not really scientists, they're just crackpots, but look around, look at this Wikipedia, follow some of those links, and that's all I gotta say about this, 'cause I'll just get angry and go on a rant if I keep going.

195
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,892
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

196
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:23,050
Speaker 1: Even if this indigo thing was true, I think it's pretty obvious that the parents are a little special, and they should go to a special school.

197
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:30,383
Speaker 1: So again, my thing of the day is not something, uh, you know, it's something fun and normal.

198
00:15:30,944 --> 00:15:33,690
Speaker 1: Well, not so normal, but it's fun and happy.

199
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:38,090
Speaker 1: So, there are lots of generators for various things all over the internet.

200
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,053
Speaker 0: Haha!

201
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:41,910
Speaker 0: I'm generating a picture of the haha guy saying something!

202
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:42,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

203
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:48,836
Speaker 1: Well, I found one recently that allows you to generate a character in The Simpsons style.

204
00:15:48,936 --> 00:16:03,490
Speaker 1: You can select a head, an eyeball, a nose, a hair, a body, glasses, extras, which is really just facial hair or facial lipstick or something, and you can change the scene.

205
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:12,150
Speaker 0: Now, when Scott showed this to me, the first thing I did when I looked at it was I took a very feminine head and matched it up with the ugliest man body I could find.

206
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:20,650
Speaker 0: And then when we got home, I discovered that Scott had taken the manliest head and matched it up with the most feminine body he could find, and I found that amusing.

207
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much the first thing anyone's gonna do with it.

208
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:29,770
Speaker 1: There's not much you can, uh, you know, that's the funnest thing you can do with it anyways.

209
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,655
Speaker 1: But, uh, you can do all sorts of other cool things.

210
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,742
Speaker 1: You can try to make a Simpsons, like, what would you look like if you were a Simpson?

211
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:36,724
Speaker 1: You could go for that.

212
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:37,786
Speaker 1: You know.

213
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:39,550
Speaker 1: It's a lot of fun.

214
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:40,613
Speaker 0: Huh?

215
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:42,870
Speaker 0: It's not, uh, can you make an indigo child?

216
00:16:44,038 --> 00:16:44,470
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

217
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:50,863
Speaker 0: So, it being Thursday, we're continuing with part two of our ongoing series on how to attend conventions.

218
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,790
Speaker 0: Anime cons, gaming cons, what have you.

219
00:16:54,871 --> 00:17:01,690
Speaker 0: And, uh, last week we talked mostly about, you know, the planning stages, actually driving there, deciding if you want to go, all that sort of thing.

220
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,521
Speaker 1: The stuff you do before the actual con.

221
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:04,930
Speaker 0: The pre-con.

222
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,278
Speaker 0: So now, now we're hitting up on at-con.

223
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:10,450
Speaker 0: What do you actually do from the moment you arrive until the moment you depart?

224
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,189
Speaker 1: I don't know how far we'll actually make it, but we'll go until time runs out.

225
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:14,970
Speaker 0: Yep.

226
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,336
Speaker 0: 'Cause the first thing is you'll arrive into town.

227
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:22,869
Speaker 0: however you arrived, and depending on if you drove or flew or took a train, you'll have to deal with various different obstacles.

228
00:17:23,771 --> 00:17:30,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you took a train or a plane, you gotta get to your hotel somehow, and if you have a friend, that's real easy.

229
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:37,730
Speaker 1: If you don't have a friend that's, you know, already there with a car, you're gonna need to take a taxi, maybe a light rail, something.

230
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:44,190
Speaker 1: But, uh, you better figure it out and make haste with it, or you could be sitting at the airport slash train station for quite a while.

231
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,690
Speaker 0: Luckily, most airport train stations have very good taxi services to all surrounding hotels.

232
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,689
Speaker 1: Yep, you just say, "Take me to this hotel," and you go.

233
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,123
Speaker 0: Though if you're driving in, it's not a concern unless you go to the super, super big conventions.

234
00:17:57,183 --> 00:17:59,530
Speaker 0: Most cons are just free parking or you park at the hotel, whatever.

235
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,538
Speaker 0: But if you go to Otacon, we'll use Otacon as the example.

236
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:08,270
Speaker 0: just because it's the big, big, big con we go to, parking is hellishly expensive.

237
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:12,826
Speaker 0: As in, the hotel parking at the hotel we stay at is $20 a night.

238
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:21,250
Speaker 1: So if you get there, uh, let's say Thursday morning, it's Thursday night, Friday night, Saturday night, 60 bucks.

239
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

240
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:32,290
Speaker 1: That's not, you know, that's not super expensive, I mean, we can afford it, but a lot of poor geeks can't, and it's, you can buy a video game, man, and have change left over.

241
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:41,250
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess the moral of this story is just, know how much parking is gonna cost and leave that money aside, because we barely made it out of our first Otacon.

242
00:18:41,792 --> 00:18:41,877
Speaker 0: Yeah.

243
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,930
Speaker 0: They're scrapping together what little money we had left to buy gas to pay for parking.

244
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:47,770
Speaker 1: It's kinda rough.

245
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:57,030
Speaker 0: Of course, this most recent year, we actually got away almost scot-free entirely by accident, because we, uh, lost the little slip of paper that said how long we were in the garage.

246
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,630
Speaker 1: I don't think we actually lost it, but it was lost in the car.

247
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:00,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I couldn't find it, to this day.

248
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,564
Speaker 1: And when we drove up, you know, he, we, uh, we said we lost our slip of paper, he said, "Well, how long have you been parked

249
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:05,704
Speaker 1: here?".

250
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,687
Speaker 1: We said, "You know, a

251
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:06,908
Speaker 1: night.".

252
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:08,142
Speaker 0: *laughs*.

253
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,830
Speaker 0: Actually, I don't think the guy who was asking, either he, he just wanted a bribe, and then he let us out, or he didn't speak English.

254
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,349
Speaker 0: We're not sure, but we gave him twenty bucks and he let us go.

255
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we ended up saving a whole lot of money by, uh, luck.

256
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:24,227
Speaker 1: Yeah.

257
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,330
Speaker 1: And now we're gonna do it on purpose.

258
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, I guess after this coming Otacon, we'll be able to tell you whether or not you can get away with paying almost nothing for parking.

259
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:32,371
Speaker 1: Yep.

260
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:39,070
Speaker 1: 'Cause we'll definitely, you know, be willing to pay the full price if they catch us, and they don't let us get off with that trick, but it might work.

261
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:48,930
Speaker 0: Now, actually arriving, the first thing you wanna do, no matter what, I don't care whether you're registering or what, go to the hotel and check in first, even if your check-in time isn't until later in the day.

262
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,170
Speaker 1: Usually you can get checked in as soon as the hotel is your room ready.

263
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,430
Speaker 1: The check-in time, the hotel officially states, is the time when all the rooms are ready for getting in no matter what.

264
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:03,970
Speaker 1: So, depending on where your room is in the hotel, it's pretty much a crapshoot whether you can get in early or not.

265
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,353
Speaker 0: Also, how early you arrive.

266
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:13,770
Speaker 0: Like, we go to Otacon, we arrive Thursday morning, so we check in at, like, 11 AM, and they usually have some rooms ready and they just give them to us right away.

267
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,199
Speaker 1: Yep.

268
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:20,170
Speaker 0: And the earlier you check in, the more likely you'll be able to choose where your rooms are in the hotel if you have a preference or anything like that.

269
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, if they didn't already decide that when you made your reservation.

270
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,250
Speaker 0: And they'll also likely have more, uh, spare keys available if you need more than a few.

271
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:32,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it's not like the olden days where there were so many physical keys per room, now they're keycards that they program.

272
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:43,749
Speaker 1: So, they have a stack of spare ones, and, you know, if you ask for two extra, they take two spare ones and they program them for your room, and eventually they run out of those, so...

273
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:51,290
Speaker 0: Now, I highly recommend, if you can, that you ask for early check-in when you reserve the hotel room.

274
00:20:52,071 --> 00:20:59,450
Speaker 0: Because most hotels offer it free of charge, even if they don't say they do, and all that means is they'll make sure your room's ready long before the check-in time.

275
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:07,710
Speaker 1: That means you can dump off all your stuff in your hotel room real early in the morning when you show up, and then go do stuff!

276
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:17,870
Speaker 0: But now, talking about the hotel room, I promised last week that I'd give a nice succinct guide on how to overstuff a hotel room, because it's technically illegal and against the hotel's policies.

277
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,856
Speaker 1: But overstuffing is pretty much absolutely necessary for a convention.

278
00:21:21,957 --> 00:21:30,050
Speaker 1: If you pay for the actual number of rooms it would take to legally house, you know, like 20 people, you have to be like a rich guy.

279
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,440
Speaker 0: Well, actually, only if you're going to a big con like Otacon.

280
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,030
Speaker 0: Otacon and Katsucon have the most expensive hotel rooms.

281
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,490
Speaker 0: But like, OhioCon, it was like 90 bucks a night for the room, it didn't matter.

282
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,877
Speaker 1: You know, but still, 90 bucks, you know, it adds up.

283
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:48,808
Speaker 1: Even if it was 90 bucks a night, I'd rather have six people in the room than the limit of four.

284
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:59,810
Speaker 0: See, I used to feel that way, but when I went to Katsucon, even though the hotel room was expensive, I'd gone to so many cons where I overstuffed the room, it was real nice to share a room with just two other guys.

285
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,417
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

286
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:02,955
Speaker 0: I paid out the ass for it.

287
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:09,910
Speaker 0: But basically, there's a list of things and tricks that you have to do, because the hotel knows you're overstuffing.

288
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,357
Speaker 0: Don't think for a second that they don't know exactly what you're planning, especially if you're at a con.

289
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:21,490
Speaker 0: The thing is, they won't screw you, and they won't go out of their way to find you out, unless you really give them a hard time.

290
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,633
Speaker 0: So, it's kind of an open secret.

291
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:33,770
Speaker 0: The rule number one, everyone must bring their own towels, because if you get a room that has an occupancy of four people, it's gonna have four towels in it.

292
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:38,290
Speaker 0: If you request, you know, eight more towels, they're gonna be suspicious.

293
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:49,670
Speaker 1: The other thing is, the towels they give you are really small, so even if you try to use them, someone who's normal size, like what, we're almost six feet tall, I had to use two of those hotel towels.

294
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,750
Speaker 0: That's just because you use a giant freak towel.

295
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,070
Speaker 1: A giant awesome towel.

296
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:54,869
Speaker 1: Bring your own towel.

297
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, bring your own towel, and if you have extra people, bring your own pillows, blankets, all the extras.

298
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:03,590
Speaker 0: All the stuff that you might need that you would otherwise ask for the hotel.

299
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,070
Speaker 1: The awesome people get dibs on beds.

300
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,690
Speaker 0: Generally, that's the one perk, because we've been talking about how difficult it is, and time consuming, and frustrating to actually manage this for all your friends.

301
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:19,525
Speaker 0: The main perk is that if you do all this, you're pretty much guaranteed a bed, because you did it.

302
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,590
Speaker 0: You can just kick people out of your room if they don't comply.

303
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,170
Speaker 0: Yup.

304
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,870
Speaker 0: Now, rule number two, do not ever request anything extra from the hotel.

305
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:33,330
Speaker 1: You don't want room service, you don't even want the rollaway bed, you want nothing.

306
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, especially never ask for the rollaway bed.

307
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,049
Speaker 1: They often charge for the rollaway bed.

308
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:44,050
Speaker 0: Yes, and if you ask for the rollaway bed, they'll come into your room and they might see, you know, ten sets of bags where there should only be four.

309
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,630
Speaker 1: The other thing is, normally when you go on vacation, your hotel room is full of, like, your clothes and your toiletries.

310
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,550
Speaker 1: So you can let room service, you know, not room service, that's ordering food, uh, housekeeping, come in and clean up all you want.

311
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:06,330
Speaker 1: But at a con, your room is full of, like, drinks, snacks, toys, con goodies, extra people, con badges, all kinds of crazy shit.

312
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:10,790
Speaker 1: And it's just a mess everywhere, and you really don't want housekeeping touching anything.

313
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:19,830
Speaker 0: So that's rule number three, do not ever request housekeeping, and make sure you put the Do Not Disturb thing on your doorknob 24/7.

314
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,309
Speaker 1: Yup, never let it get off there.

315
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:26,650
Speaker 1: And if there isn't a Do Not Disturb thingy in your room, go ask for one at the desk.

316
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:28,029
Speaker 0: Or make one.

317
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't call them up and say, "Bring me one,".

318
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:33,547
Speaker 1: go down to the desk and say, "Can I have a Do Not Disturb

319
00:24:33,587 --> 00:24:33,788
Speaker 1: sign?".

320
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,129
Speaker 1: That way, they don't come in your room and look.

321
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,070
Speaker 0: Yup.

322
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:43,430
Speaker 0: Now, rule number three is don't have everyone go up to the desk when you check in.

323
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:52,150
Speaker 0: If you walk up to a desk with nine people, and you say, "Checking into room for Decoster, Occupancy 2," they're gonna know.

324
00:24:53,051 --> 00:25:01,370
Speaker 0: Have one guy go check in, and then meet everyone at the room, or go up to the room in stages, or something, you're smart, figure it out.

325
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:08,230
Speaker 1: Generally, it doesn't matter unless you travel in a big group, because people show up at all kinds of different times.

326
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,981
Speaker 1: So those people just show up and be like, "Hey, what room are you

327
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:11,101
Speaker 1: in?".

328
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:12,830
Speaker 1: And they go in the elevator and no one knows.

329
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,790
Speaker 1: And maybe one person shows up at a time, maybe two at a time.

330
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,309
Speaker 1: But if you show up at ten people at a time, you have to buffer it.

331
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,190
Speaker 1: You know, stay in the parking garage and then go up into the elevators.

332
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:29,290
Speaker 1: Or just send one person up to get the keys, then have that person come down and get everyone else.

333
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:30,996
Speaker 0: Yep, now getting the keys.

334
00:25:31,658 --> 00:25:34,910
Speaker 0: Don't ask for more keys than the room's occupancy.

335
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:40,890
Speaker 0: So if you have a room with an occupancy of four, you can safely ask for three extra keys, but don't ask for eight.

336
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,230
Speaker 0: It's kind of obvious why you should--.

337
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,610
Speaker 1: Usually the hotels will give you two keys by default.

338
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:45,925
Speaker 1: Yeah.

339
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,109
Speaker 1: And two might be all you need.

340
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,390
Speaker 0: It's always good to have extras, but you gotta make sure you keep track of them.

341
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:53,873
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot.

342
00:25:53,913 --> 00:26:01,670
Speaker 1: We're assuming that you're getting normal rooms with two double beds, which is two queen-sized beds, which is for four people.

343
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,091
Speaker 0: Yes.

344
00:26:02,211 --> 00:26:09,310
Speaker 0: In fact, you should probably request that, because usually it's interchangeable between two double beds or two queen-- Usually it's two queen beds or one king bed.

345
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:09,710
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,308
Speaker 0: Are your choices.

347
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:17,150
Speaker 1: You want two queen bedrooms, and you want as many adjacent rooms as you're gonna need.

348
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:29,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, most people only get one room, but if you're like us and you start making awesome and all your friends start wanting to stay with you, we get two, three rooms, and with the early check-in, we're assured that we'll get three rooms in a row.

349
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,757
Speaker 0: Because, basically, think of it this way.

350
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:34,930
Speaker 0: Shower space is pretty much the only reason for this, and also keys.

351
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,250
Speaker 0: If you have eight people in one room, that's eight people who share one bathroom and one shower and four keys.

352
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:50,550
Speaker 0: If you have sixteen people in two rooms, and the rooms are adjacent, now you have two bathrooms that can be used simultaneously between the two rooms.

353
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,687
Speaker 1: Because you leave the doors that connect the rooms together open at all times, so any key to one room is a key to both of the rooms.

354
00:26:58,529 --> 00:26:58,790
Speaker 1: You see?

355
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,521
Speaker 0: So if you ever go in a big group, unless you're going for a suite or something, just get rooms that are adjacent.

356
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:06,990
Speaker 0: You'll save money, and it'll make your overstuffing experience a lot better.

357
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,955
Speaker 1: Yeah, a suite is something completely different.

358
00:27:09,035 --> 00:27:11,763
Speaker 1: I can only recommend you get a suite if you're going to have a party.

359
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:14,610
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's just kind of silly.

360
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:15,170
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:24,150
Speaker 0: Now, my general recommendation is that you can probably take the occupancy of a room plus three people comfortably, unless it's like a Days Inn or something crappy.

362
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:30,570
Speaker 0: Now, if you have adjacent rooms, you can add two extra people per adjacency, basically.

363
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,035
Speaker 0: Say you've got four occupancy rooms.

364
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,620
Speaker 0: You could have seven people per room, fine.

365
00:27:35,961 --> 00:27:40,250
Speaker 0: But if you've got the door between them open, you can fit a couple extra people in addition to that fairly easily.

366
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,653
Speaker 1: It also depends on the kind of people you're bringing.

367
00:27:43,773 --> 00:27:55,650
Speaker 1: If you're bringing, let's say you're bringing ten giant fat people, or you're bringing a bunch of high-maintenance teenage girls, you're going to need to lower your estimates a little bit on how many you can fit in there.

368
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:56,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

369
00:27:57,154 --> 00:27:58,517
Speaker 0: Now, this is the rule.

370
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:01,063
Speaker 0: We're beyond the rules that'll prevent you from getting caught.

371
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:03,670
Speaker 0: Here's the rule that you really need to remember.

372
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:09,500
Speaker 0: Now, I recommend, first off, don't worry about other people following this rule.

373
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:14,870
Speaker 0: Follow it yourself, even if you're not running the room, if you're just in it, and then worry about other people.

374
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,572
Speaker 0: But keep your shit together.

375
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:30,410
Speaker 0: I mean, when you get into the room, pick a small area, put all your bags there, and state to the world that that is your spot, and make sure everything you own in the world that is at this convention with you is in that spot at all times when it is not on your person.

376
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:31,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

377
00:28:31,772 --> 00:28:35,057
Speaker 1: You can't tell you how many times people run around, "Where's my con badge?

378
00:28:35,378 --> 00:28:37,000
Speaker 1: Where's the piece of my costume?

379
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,084
Speaker 1: Where's that plushie I bought?

380
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:40,145
Speaker 0: Where's this?

381
00:28:40,226 --> 00:28:40,806
Speaker 0: Where's that?

382
00:28:40,847 --> 00:28:41,768
Speaker 1: Where's my toothbrush?

383
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:42,089
Speaker 1: Oh my

384
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:42,449
Speaker 1: god!".

385
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:48,450
Speaker 1: Keep it all together in one spot, and just don't mess around with it, and you'll be okay.

386
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,010
Speaker 0: Yep.

387
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:56,890
Speaker 0: Now, your friends may suck and not do this, but as long as you do it, and you keep their stuff out of your stuff, it'll make your life a thousand times easier.

388
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:05,550
Speaker 1: And then, 'cause if you're the guy who's got the room, then when everyone checks out, you go around the room and you pick everything up that looks good, and everything else, just leave there.

389
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:06,130
Speaker 1: Yeah.

390
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:20,766
Speaker 0: I mean, you wouldn't believe the things that our friends leave in their rooms, 'cause we usually check out, like we walk out of the room last, and there's just stuff everywhere, like underwear, socks, shoes, bathing suits, towels, everyone forgets their toiletries.

391
00:29:21,047 --> 00:29:23,970
Speaker 0: I think there were like five bottles of shampoo in one of our rooms last year.

392
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:24,595
Speaker 1: Wow.

393
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,410
Speaker 1: That was the most ever.

394
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, like everyone left their shampoo.

395
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:29,952
Speaker 1: Yikes.

396
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,030
Speaker 1: Alright, so I think that's about it for the hotel.

397
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,971
Speaker 0: Yep.

398
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:43,570
Speaker 0: And we've already talked last time about, when you distribute the keys, make sure you distribute the keys in a way that lets the people who need to go to the room the most often go to it without bothering you.

399
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:54,063
Speaker 1: Alright, so we already talked about registration, whether you should pre-register or register at the con, but the next thing you want to do is get your badge as soon as possible.

400
00:29:54,463 --> 00:29:58,790
Speaker 1: Even if it's a little tiny con, the sooner you get the badge, the sooner you can have fun at the con.

401
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,235
Speaker 0: Now if it's a little con, don't worry about it, just get in line and whatever.

402
00:30:02,255 --> 00:30:13,550
Speaker 0: If it's a big con like Oticon, bring water, bring your DS or PSP, bring all your friends and stand in line together, and be prepared to wait.

403
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:22,302
Speaker 1: Now, you want to check the weather, 'cause if you're gonna be outside, which is a pretty good chance you're gonna be waiting outside, there might be rain, you need an umbrella.

404
00:30:22,582 --> 00:30:24,505
Speaker 1: It might be crazy, crazy hot.

405
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:28,070
Speaker 1: Don't wear your furry cosplay in the crazy, crazy heat.

406
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:34,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, in fact, don't cosplay until you've gotten the hotel room and you're in it and you have a chance to shower and relax a little.

407
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,950
Speaker 1: It's okay to do like a light cosplay, like let's say you have a funny hat.

408
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:46,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, or you got a Fullmetal Alchemist uniform that's actually real clothing and is comfortable, like you wore it in the car on the way there.

409
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:56,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you have the typical cosplay like, you know, I don't know, a Koopa Troopa with a giant turtle shell, you don't want to wait in line with the giant turtle shell on you.

410
00:30:57,271 --> 00:31:03,190
Speaker 0: It'll suck ass and you won't look good because you'll be sweaty and miserable and frowning the whole time and no one will care about your cosplay.

411
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,482
Speaker 1: There are enough cosplays in line and there's enough time to do cosplay the rest of the con.

412
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,650
Speaker 1: You don't need to wait outside for two hours in the cosplay.

413
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:19,530
Speaker 0: Now also, regarding the cosplay, and as our friend Kat noted in the forums, if you're going to cosplay, make sure your cosplay is done before the con.

414
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:25,210
Speaker 1: I can't tell you how many times I've seen sewing machines at cons, people working on costumes while they're there.

415
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:32,409
Speaker 0: Now it's good to have a sewing machine if you're a cosplayer, because if your costume breaks, like right before the masquerade, Oh, then you can fix it, sure.

416
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,830
Speaker 0: But if you're spending more than half your time at the con making a new costume, you've got issues.

417
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,916
Speaker 1: I remember I saw in Artist Alley.

418
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:42,670
Speaker 1: once, people were selling like emergency cosplay repair kits.

419
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:43,046
Speaker 1: Yeah.

420
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:57,809
Speaker 1: You might want to test your cosplay before the con to make sure it doesn't fall apart, you know, with, you know, it doesn't have to go through intense like brawling activity, but like run around in it and see if it falls apart, unless it's the kind that, you know, you know it can't.

421
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:58,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

422
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:06,390
Speaker 0: Now if it's a really, really complex cosplay that's not going to last long and you know that, don't wear it Friday morning when no one's in the con yet because they're all in line.

423
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,321
Speaker 0: Wait until Friday night or Saturday afternoon when the most people are going to see it.

424
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:11,685
Speaker 0: Get the most bang for your buck.

425
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:13,130
Speaker 0: You worked hard on that costume.

426
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,619
Speaker 1: And if it's a really, really good costume, you're not going to be moving much in it.

427
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,430
Speaker 1: You're pretty much going to go into the biggest open space and stand there.

428
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,695
Speaker 0: God, I never really cosplayed on purpose before.

429
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:32,629
Speaker 0: Like I was on Fansview twice because I didn't shave and I was scruffly and I was wearing a tie and I was hot so I pulled my collar open and they took a picture of me that I was Kaji from Ava.

430
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,976
Speaker 0: But other than that, we'd never cosplayed before in our lives.

431
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:42,050
Speaker 0: And this past year, we decided to get all our friends and dress up as the axe gang from Kung Fu Hustle.

432
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:49,547
Speaker 0: And let me tell you, cosplayers, I have a whole new load of respect for you people.

433
00:32:49,888 --> 00:32:50,650
Speaker 0: How do you deal with it?

434
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,897
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm trying to go do my con business, right?

435
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,306
Speaker 1: And I'm just wearing a costume for fun and then people just say, "Stop!

436
00:32:57,607 --> 00:32:58,008
Speaker 1: I want to take a

437
00:32:58,028 --> 00:32:58,309
Speaker 1: picture.".

438
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:10,590
Speaker 1: And as soon as one person has the balls to actually ask you to stop, a hundred people who didn't have the balls will stop and try to take a picture of you and you'll end up standing there for minutes and minutes and minutes as people just keep taking pictures.

439
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:13,040
Speaker 1: And it's like, "Alright, I have stuff to do.

440
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,848
Speaker 1: I'm actually a con attendee

441
00:33:14,888 --> 00:33:15,069
Speaker 1: here.".

442
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:15,550
Speaker 0: Yep.

443
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:25,770
Speaker 0: You'll have to deal with, like, this may sound silly, but if you're an anime con especially, you're really going to have to deal with, like, prepubescent girls running up to you from behind and hugging you.

444
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:27,209
Speaker 1: That's not cool.

445
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,232
Speaker 0: Yeah.

446
00:33:28,493 --> 00:33:29,457
Speaker 0: Just be wary.

447
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,890
Speaker 0: There are going to be girls who are going to try to jump all over you if you're dressing up.

448
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:37,349
Speaker 1: So you only want to dress up at times and you don't want to do anything else.

449
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:41,810
Speaker 1: Or if you have a costume that, you know, no one will really care about or bug you about.

450
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:46,730
Speaker 0: Because we cosplayed for about half the day and then we couldn't deal with it anymore and we had to change out of our costumes.

451
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,310
Speaker 0: We were glad they were popular, but we couldn't actually do anything at the con.

452
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you're like a normal Sailor Scout, whatever, just who cares?

453
00:33:54,504 --> 00:33:56,210
Speaker 1: But this is a really good one.

454
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:02,490
Speaker 1: If you happen to be a really amazing Sailor Moon or something, then you might want to only do it when nothing else is happening.

455
00:34:03,311 --> 00:34:07,450
Speaker 0: Now, regarding cosplay, and once again, all this cosplay stuff applies mostly to anime cons.

456
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:09,818
Speaker 1: No, you'd be surprised.

457
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,770
Speaker 1: There's a lot of costuming at other cons.

458
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:19,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, not to stereotype, but if you go to a gaming con, most of the people who cosplay are real scary.

459
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,129
Speaker 1: Yup, that's for sure.

460
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:25,870
Speaker 0: But I guess if you've never been to an anime con, cosplay is much more accepted.

461
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,860
Speaker 0: Not in most people, but a lot of people do it.

462
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:30,650
Speaker 0: I'd say at least half the people do it.

463
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:34,389
Speaker 0: And there's not that stigma, and it's not just fat old guys dressed like Sailor Bubba.

464
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:40,389
Speaker 1: Yeah, like at comic conventions, there'll be cosplay, like people dressed up as superheroes, but it's only like a few freaks.

465
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,409
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, a thing that everyone does.

466
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:48,510
Speaker 1: At anime cons, it's weird because if not half, then more than half of the people are doing it.

467
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,804
Speaker 0: But a lot of people who do it are very normal, cool people.

468
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:51,730
Speaker 0: They're not creepy at all.

469
00:34:51,909 --> 00:35:02,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it ranges from stuff like a guy with like a sword to like someone dressed up as a giant Pikachu, you know, or crazy, crazy stuff.

470
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,750
Speaker 0: I mean, there are people who you could consider professional cosplayers out there.

471
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,850
Speaker 1: Those are the scary people.

472
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:12,470
Speaker 0: 'Cause I actually stayed in a room with a bunch of those types way back when I went to Anime Central.

473
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:17,070
Speaker 0: And we stayed in the Presidential Suite with like 20 people, and there was a crazy party.

474
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:28,810
Speaker 0: And all the girls who had the room were like super pro cosplayers, to the point that they made an entire intricate, beautiful costume from scratch Friday night so they could wear it Saturday.

475
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:30,489
Speaker 1: Wow.

476
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,605
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you've never been to an anime con, check it out just to see the cosplays.

477
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:35,830
Speaker 0: They're actually really impressive.

478
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:42,090
Speaker 1: Alright, so the next thing you do, you've got your badge, you've got your con packet, what do you do?

479
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:46,416
Speaker 1: Well, the first thing, I think I posted this on the forum, but I'll say it again here.

480
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:56,170
Speaker 1: You look at the con schedule, and there are things in the con schedule that will be so awesome and so amazing that you cannot possibly miss them.

481
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,114
Speaker 1: But there won't be so many of these things.

482
00:35:58,135 --> 00:35:59,559
Speaker 1: There'll maybe be two or three.

483
00:36:00,942 --> 00:36:03,510
Speaker 1: Guarantee to yourself that you will do those things no matter what.

484
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:05,890
Speaker 0: And don't commit to anything else.

485
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,590
Speaker 1: Don't commit to anything else at all.

486
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,329
Speaker 0: We're not saying don't do anything else, but don't commit to it.

487
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:18,709
Speaker 0: Agree with all your friends, "Alright, I'm going to this because it's going to be crazy, and I'm going to this because it's going to be crazy and you'll all meet and do

488
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:18,829
Speaker 0: it.".

489
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,269
Speaker 0: But the rest of the time, just wander around and do whatever strikes your fancy or whatever happens.

490
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:28,789
Speaker 1: I mean, if you try to open up the con schedule and say, "I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to do this, and then I'm going to do

491
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:28,949
Speaker 1: that."

492
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,435
Speaker 1: Alright, well you know what's going to happen?

493
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:34,370
Speaker 1: That's going to be cancelled, that's going to move to a different room and you'll get lost for a half hour.

494
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,409
Speaker 1: You'll get caught in a sea of traffic going to that.

495
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:41,630
Speaker 1: You know, there'll be a cool thing you'll stop to look at on your way to that.

496
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:45,390
Speaker 1: You know, who knows, your plan will be totally shot to hell, it doesn't work.

497
00:36:45,951 --> 00:36:46,669
Speaker 1: Don't even bother.

498
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:54,869
Speaker 1: Just, at any moment during the con, if you're not entertained enough, then you open up the schedule, you say, "What's going on right

499
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:55,170
Speaker 1: now?"

500
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:58,610
Speaker 1: And you go for what you think is going to be good right at that moment.

501
00:36:59,111 --> 00:37:05,370
Speaker 1: Unless one of your very, very few committed activities is occurring, in which case, you usually want to prepare for those ahead of time.

502
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:06,747
Speaker 1: Like, you know.

503
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:12,690
Speaker 0: Yup, and I've found this advice applies to really small conventions and really large conventions pretty much equally.

504
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:19,550
Speaker 0: Because I've been to some very, very small cons that had like two event rooms and like one tiny dealer's room.

505
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:28,590
Speaker 0: And even then, there's one or two events that you want to go to and the rest of the fun is really just kind of ad hoc and it comes randomly and you really can't prepare for it or expect it.

506
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:33,709
Speaker 0: And if you try to schedule out your whole day, you're going to end up missing out on a lot of fun.

507
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:40,930
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times do you look at the schedule and you say, "Gee, you know, I don't know if I want to go to this or if I want to go to that.

508
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,264
Speaker 1: That looks fun, I'm not

509
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:42,527
Speaker 1: sure.".

510
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:46,090
Speaker 1: The description in the con book isn't always very helpful.

511
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:54,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, we're not sure what it was to this day, but we saw an event at a con I went to called "Hentai Hot

512
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:55,229
Speaker 0: Tub."

513
00:37:56,513 --> 00:37:57,910
Speaker 0: And we weren't sure what that meant.

514
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:04,550
Speaker 0: We know what hentai is, we know what a hot tub is, but the two together, we were curious enough to try to figure out what the hell it was.

515
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:12,549
Speaker 0: But the con book didn't really give us any information other than the time and it didn't actually say where it was either.

516
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:15,206
Speaker 1: Maybe it was just made up.

517
00:38:15,613 --> 00:38:16,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure.

518
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,229
Speaker 1: But here's a good example that comes to mind.

519
00:38:19,951 --> 00:38:25,090
Speaker 1: At Otacon last year, there was the Great Teacher Largo panel.

520
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:27,450
Speaker 0: Oh, we thought that was going to be so awesome.

521
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,693
Speaker 1: We weren't sure exactly.

522
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:35,190
Speaker 1: was he going to show up, because he's a cool guy, or is this going to be some mega Tokyo fanboy thing, or what the hell was it going to be?

523
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:39,287
Speaker 1: And, you know, we didn't say, "Alright, we're definitely going to

524
00:38:39,327 --> 00:38:39,508
Speaker 1: that.".

525
00:38:39,931 --> 00:38:42,929
Speaker 1: But on Sunday, when the time came for it, we said, "Alright, what do we want to

526
00:38:42,949 --> 00:38:43,029
Speaker 1: do?".

527
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,790
Speaker 1: And we looked, and that was there, and there were some other things.

528
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,227
Speaker 1: So we said, "Alright, we'll go look at

529
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:47,288
Speaker 1: it.".

530
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,330
Speaker 1: We went there, and five minutes into it, there was an annoying kid, and nothing happened, and it kind of sucked.

531
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,610
Speaker 0: Was that kid a guy or a girl?

532
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:55,070
Speaker 1: I don't know.

533
00:38:55,293 --> 00:38:56,589
Speaker 0: It was just this annoying kid.

534
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:01,550
Speaker 0: Like, super fanboy, and followed us around, and we barely escaped with our lives.

535
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, it's good to meet people at conventions, new people.

536
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:09,990
Speaker 1: That's, in fact, most of the fun is meeting all kinds of cool people.

537
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:18,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I have friends that are con friends, that I see them at multiple cons every year, and I'm very close to them, but that's the only way I know them, is through the conventions.

538
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:30,590
Speaker 1: But if some annoying person comes up to you, like some fanboy, and starts talking to you, it's okay to just, you know, make them go away, because they're only going to make your time at the con painful.

539
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:42,070
Speaker 0: Now, if you're a polite person, or you have trouble brushing people off like that, a real good trick is to have a fake aim name ready, because eventually they'll ask you what your aim name is, and they can catch up with you later.

540
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:43,172
Speaker 0: Just lie.

541
00:39:43,934 --> 00:39:46,038
Speaker 0: Just lie straight up, and then you'll never see them again.

542
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:47,521
Speaker 0: The con's so big, it won't matter.

543
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:51,810
Speaker 0: Or the con's so small, you're screwed, because they'll follow you around for the whole con.

544
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:56,614
Speaker 1: Another good idea is to team up with someone who can brush them off.

545
00:39:57,235 --> 00:40:08,750
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of times, if, you know, there'll be a nerdy guy who's trying to bother you, but you're hanging out with someone who he, like, is kind of afraid of going near, even though he really wants to get close to you.

546
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:14,210
Speaker 1: But as long as you stay close to that safety person, it's sort of like a repelling magnet, you can keep them away.

547
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:19,730
Speaker 0: Now, at the same time, don't push people away automatically, because you'll meet a lot of cool people, like we said.

548
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,630
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, only brush someone away if they're, like, a super annoying fan person that's just painful to stand next to.

549
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:29,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if a big ol' fat guy comes over and starts telling you about his hentai collection, brush him off.

550
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:36,029
Speaker 1: Or if a little nerdy kid comes up and says, "Oh my god, DDR, blah blah blah, I can get this on this song, I can get this on this song, oh my god, I beat this song on this song...".

551
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,305
Speaker 1: You say, "Alright, shut up and go

552
00:40:38,346 --> 00:40:38,487
Speaker 1: away.".

553
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:44,450
Speaker 0: But if you run into, say, us, if you say, "Hey," we'll say, "Hey," and we'll probably end up going to the AMV contest together.

554
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you say Leroy, we say Jenkins.

555
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:55,810
Speaker 0: Actually, we went to Otacon, and just so you know, we yelled Leroy, and in fact, an entire crowd of people screamed Jenkins back.

556
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are certain things you can do with cons, sort of like a litmus test, to tell if people are cool.

557
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:07,610
Speaker 1: You know, and that's sort of like a really weak one, is to say Leroy and see if they say Jenkins.

558
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,930
Speaker 1: Because if they say Jenkins, that means that, you know, they're cool, happening-on-the-internet type of people.

559
00:41:13,634 --> 00:41:14,170
Speaker 1: You know that much.

560
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,049
Speaker 0: I mean, it depends on what kind of con it is and who you're looking for.

561
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:16,692
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

562
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:23,423
Speaker 1: Well, if it's, like, BotCon, you can say, like, what's that thing the Transformers say?

563
00:41:23,443 --> 00:41:25,949
Speaker 1: The little internet, the universal...

564
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:27,170
Speaker 0: I don't even remember.

565
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:34,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what, because I've seen that movie so many times, but that universal peace thing is so complicated, I've never memorized it.

566
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,770
Speaker 1: It's like Chub Niffy something.

567
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:36,078
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:36,950
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

569
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,827
Speaker 0: Neither do I.

570
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,875
Speaker 1: If I see it, I'll go, "Oh, that's what that...".

571
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:44,750
Speaker 1: I recognize it immediately, but yeah, if you say that kind of thing, you know, it all depends on the con.

572
00:41:45,150 --> 00:42:08,190
Speaker 0: I mean, the main thing to remember is that while anime cons and gaming cons and all these different geeky cons are all, like, a different subset of geekery... We're kind of leaving out the trade conventions a little bit here, but they're all geeks, and a lot of geeks have similar interests, and they may not be super in... Like, you're in an anime con, there's a good chance you'll find some Linux geeks or some gaming geeks and hang out with them independent of the anime.

573
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I actually didn't watch, really, any anime at all at Otacon.

574
00:42:14,231 --> 00:42:19,070
Speaker 1: I did so few anime-related activities, actually, other than buying anime merchandise, it was scary.

575
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:25,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, one of the highlights was seeing Entertainment System, the band, play NES songs for us in a little concert.

576
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,449
Speaker 1: That was one of the things we committed to.

577
00:42:28,031 --> 00:42:29,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

578
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:29,648
Speaker 0: It was worth it.

579
00:42:30,371 --> 00:42:30,889
Speaker 1: Definitely worth it.

580
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,350
Speaker 1: So, eating at the con is sort of tricky, depending on where the con is at.

581
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:39,970
Speaker 0: Now, if it's a small con, it really doesn't matter, you don't have to worry about it at all.

582
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:48,450
Speaker 0: Because every small con I've gone to, basically, everyone just gets together, and then they either go out, because there's a million restaurants nearby, or they order a pizza and have it delivered to the hotel.

583
00:42:49,352 --> 00:42:55,850
Speaker 0: I mean, at UberCon, there were literally like a hundred pizzas delivered to the hotel under various names over the course of the evening on Saturday.

584
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:59,450
Speaker 1: You never want to eat in the hotel or convention center, ever.

585
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,209
Speaker 0: Yes, that goes doubly so.

586
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,970
Speaker 1: Unless it's free food provided by the convention itself.

587
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, Anime Central used to have the most awesome thing.

588
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,309
Speaker 0: I don't know if they still do it, but basically, they had a green room that had infinite free food.

589
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:20,330
Speaker 0: And by infinite free food, I mean actual food, like sandwiches with meat and cheese on them, and chips and crackers and soda and fruit and drinks.

590
00:43:21,811 --> 00:43:23,610
Speaker 0: It was absolutely free to anyone who went to the con.

591
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,170
Speaker 0: You could go to Anime Central and not spend a dime on food and not die.

592
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,170
Speaker 1: Also, most cons provide free water, so never buy bottled water, ever.

593
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, but make sure you have money for food.

594
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:39,590
Speaker 0: Make sure your group either has a way to get in touch, or has a planned time to meet for dinner.

595
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:43,070
Speaker 0: Don't worry so much about lunch, because you're all going to be doing different things anyway.

596
00:43:44,293 --> 00:43:47,170
Speaker 0: It takes a long time to organize a group to go out for dinner.

597
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:53,008
Speaker 1: I usually just take as many people as I can get right now, and then we go, "Okay, good, let's

598
00:43:53,028 --> 00:43:53,129
Speaker 1: eat."

599
00:43:54,695 --> 00:43:57,827
Speaker 1: Our total group of people that we knew at the con was like 30 or 40 people.

600
00:43:59,531 --> 00:44:10,490
Speaker 0: And we always organize the crazy dinners, because it takes about an hour to gather a group of that size, get them together, get them all to agree on a restaurant, drag them all there, sit them all down, and then finally start eating.

601
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:12,709
Speaker 0: You don't want to do that three times a day.

602
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:18,150
Speaker 0: So over lunch, me and Scott and five or six other people would all find each other and go eat.

603
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,746
Speaker 0: And then while we're eating, we'd see half of our group come in to eat, just as we're leaving.

604
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,670
Speaker 0: We kind of trade off.

605
00:44:26,432 --> 00:44:31,170
Speaker 1: And the other thing is, you have to know the food places in the area.

606
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:38,290
Speaker 1: I remember the first Otacon, I didn't really realize that the walkway went to the little mini mall with the food court.

607
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,450
Speaker 0: Yep, I walked across the street to this other crat mall, and all they had was pizza, and it was bad pizza.

608
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:51,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, so make sure before you eat to ask either people at the con or con staff or someone where the food is at.

609
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:58,989
Speaker 0: If it's a hotel or you're in a hotel, the concierge will always know good restaurants, and they're usually very polite about it.

610
00:44:59,591 --> 00:45:05,190
Speaker 0: And if you're really worried about money, you can give them a dollar range, and they'll be very good and give you restaurants that you can afford.

611
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,608
Speaker 0: Don't be afraid to ask.

612
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, and even if you ask people in the hotel, they won't just say, "Eat in the restaurant at the

613
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:12,087
Speaker 1: hotel!"

614
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:12,730
Speaker 1: all the time.

615
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,944
Speaker 0: They'll usually say, "Don't eat

616
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:14,166
Speaker 0: here.".

617
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll actually help you out.

618
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:21,550
Speaker 1: And you don't want to eat at a sit-down restaurant unless it's dinner at night.

619
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,713
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, we did that.

620
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:24,922
Speaker 0: We dragged everyone to a Japanese sushi place.

621
00:45:24,962 --> 00:45:26,790
Speaker 0: We took the entire back room.

622
00:45:27,911 --> 00:45:30,849
Speaker 0: But it's kind of difficult to pull off, so don't worry about that so much.

623
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:37,569
Speaker 1: If you're going to eat breakfast, because I really don't eat breakfast at a con, I'll just buy an orange juice and a bottle and drink it, and that's it.

624
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,770
Speaker 1: But if you're going to eat breakfast, eat it before the con opens in the morning.

625
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,230
Speaker 1: Just because, why waste precious con time when you don't have to?

626
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:49,526
Speaker 0: Your best bet is to buy a bunch of cheapo Entenmann's donuts or something.

627
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:50,310
Speaker 0: Just keep them in the room.

628
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's another good plan.

629
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:56,610
Speaker 0: Or our friend Nuri brought cheese Danish that was most excellent, and that kept us going at Otakon.

630
00:45:57,731 --> 00:46:11,350
Speaker 1: For lunch, you generally want to find a time in the middle of the day when there's not much happening at the con, and you want to eat somewhere food court style, or maybe even fast food, even though I never eat fast food anymore.

631
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the key is eat something.

632
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:15,767
Speaker 0: A lot of people forget to eat at these conventions.

633
00:46:15,887 --> 00:46:16,550
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding.

634
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:26,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, or some people are fat and they eat too much, but don't forget to eat, because you will totally be burnt out, you'll sleep too much, you'll miss con, you'll feel bad.

635
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:27,990
Speaker 1: Remember to eat.

636
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,977
Speaker 0: Yep, and corollary to that, stay hydrated.

637
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:41,610
Speaker 0: Convention centers, especially larger ones, use cooling systems, because even though it may be winter at your con, the air in that convention center is so dry it is sucking the life out of you.

638
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,142
Speaker 0: You will dehydrate twice as fast as you expect.

639
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:45,650
Speaker 0: Drink water constantly.

640
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,390
Speaker 1: I just go around drinking free water, like any time I see one, I drink like three glasses.

641
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:56,086
Speaker 0: It's not so much a concern at small conventions, but like Otakon or Anime Expo, drink water.

642
00:46:56,106 --> 00:46:57,270
Speaker 0: I'm not even kidding.

643
00:46:58,871 --> 00:47:02,369
Speaker 1: It's pretty, especially if you're doing one of those crazy cosplays, I don't know how those people do it.

644
00:47:04,172 --> 00:47:06,309
Speaker 1: I mean, I freaking need like a camel pack in there.

645
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,850
Speaker 0: That, or people are in the DDR tournaments, or people at the dances at cons.

646
00:47:13,232 --> 00:47:14,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to the dances.

647
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:20,650
Speaker 0: But along the lines of remembering to eat and remembering to drink, for the love of God, take a goddamn shower.

648
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:32,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't, you know, if you wake up, like, I don't know, five minutes before the con opens, right, and it's something you really wanted to do, but you smell like ass, and you feel dirty, it doesn't matter, take a shower.

649
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, this shouldn't be a problem, and it's not just anime cons.

650
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,690
Speaker 0: Gaming cons are even worse, and sci-fi cons are worse still.

651
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:46,870
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is, but these people just don't have basic hygiene, and it's not cool.

652
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,450
Speaker 1: It's alright, because cons are starting to crack down on that sort of thing.

653
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, Otakon, I'm very pleased with, is bit by bit introducing policies to where if you smell bad, you've gotta leave.

654
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, so don't be the guy who smells bad and has to leave.

655
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,010
Speaker 0: If you're not sure if you smell bad, ask someone.

656
00:48:04,472 --> 00:48:09,010
Speaker 1: There are drugstores every freaking two blocks in the United States and Canada.

657
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:13,910
Speaker 1: There is no reason that you can't go to one and get some deodorant, because your only excuse is that you left it at home.

658
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:23,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is, if you're gonna take part in the DDR tournament at 5 AM, or like 10 AM in the morning on Saturday, take a shower before you continue with the rest of your con experience.

659
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:28,390
Speaker 1: And then take a shower after, or before the con, before the DDR tournament and after it.

660
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:33,030
Speaker 0: Just take showers, because I swear to God, if I run into another smelly fanboy, I'm just gonna kill him.

661
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:41,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing worse than like, you're in the dealer's room, and you wanna buy something on a table, and you're trying to get close to the table to take a look at it.

662
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:48,570
Speaker 1: And you have to squeeze in next to some guy who's like wet and slimy and nasty, and it's like, alright, now I'm not buying that.

663
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:49,859
Speaker 1: You know?

664
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:58,180
Speaker 0: Now one aspect that a lot of people forget about when they go with a big group to a con is communication between group members.

665
00:48:59,881 --> 00:49:11,339
Speaker 0: It's not as much of an issue as it used to be, like we used to bring radios, actually there's a- We have a story to tell, a little bit of it inside a joke.

666
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:20,940
Speaker 0: Alright, so before cellphones were completely ubiquitous, our first convention, OhioCon.

667
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:21,500
Speaker 0: Two.

668
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, the second OhioCon we went to, and cellphones were pretty widespread, but- They were ubiquitous, we didn't have them.

669
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't have cellphones.

670
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:30,940
Speaker 0: Not, oh in fact, no one in our group had a cellphone.

671
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:31,611
Speaker 1: Wow.

672
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:42,000
Speaker 0: And we got there, and because we ran the RIT Anime Club, we took the walkie-talkies from the club vault and brought them with us, because, you know, we have that privilege, whatever.

673
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:50,120
Speaker 0: So we had all these walkie-talkies, and we discovered that a lot of other people at this con had the same walkie-talkies with the same frequency bands.

674
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,220
Speaker 1: Or at least other walkie-talkies on the same frequency.

675
00:49:53,921 --> 00:50:00,540
Speaker 0: And we also discovered that one channel, I forget which one it was, was the Staff/Security Coordination channel.

676
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:11,799
Speaker 0: So, we're sitting there, and I don't know which one of us started, it was either me or Scott, but we picked it up and one of us was like into the microphone in a random channel or some other people were talking.

677
00:50:12,941 --> 00:50:13,960
Speaker 0: It's-a me, Mario!

678
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,545
Speaker 1: Hello?

679
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,899
Speaker 1: Is he looking at us so good?

680
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,106
Speaker 0: And then we started doing Luigi.

681
00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:25,880
Speaker 0: And then other people who heard this started doing it too.

682
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:30,840
Speaker 0: And the walkie-talkies that everyone had brought to this con became useless.

683
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,900
Speaker 0: It just became a flood of Marios and Luigis yelling crap at each other.

684
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,715
Speaker 0: To the point that the security people were like, "We can't use these anymore, backup plan, backup plan,".

685
00:50:39,735 --> 00:50:41,120
Speaker 0: and they stopped using the walkie-talkies.

686
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:43,360
Speaker 0: It was hilarious.

687
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,350
Speaker 1: There's nothing better than picking it up and being like, "Hello?

688
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:48,514
Speaker 1: Is Mario there?

689
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:49,518
Speaker 1: I cannot find

690
00:50:49,578 --> 00:50:49,739
Speaker 1: him.".

691
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:52,184
Speaker 1: And they'd be like,

692
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,378
Speaker 1: "Tiddle-A-Luigi-bo-de-ba-de-ba-do.".

693
00:50:54,981 --> 00:51:03,839
Speaker 0: But now everyone just has cell phones, make sure everyone has each other's numbers, and make sure that if- Don't expect that anyone's going to answer your phone.

694
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,220
Speaker 0: Because if you call someone, odds are they don't notice it ringing until an hour later.

695
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:10,980
Speaker 0: So never expect quick communication.

696
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:14,899
Speaker 1: And then you have those next telephones that do the walkie-talkie thing.

697
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:23,840
Speaker 1: Even then, someone won't feel it vibrating, they'll be busy and they can't pick it up, they'll be watching a movie, they won't want to pick it up, they won't hear it ring.

698
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,640
Speaker 1: Just don't worry about it.

699
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,826
Speaker 0: If you're the caller, call someone once.

700
00:51:28,307 --> 00:51:32,640
Speaker 0: If they don't answer, call someone else, or don't worry about it, you're not going to get ahold of them.

701
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:38,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the time when you're calling, you're looking for people to group up, or you're trying to figure out where people are.

702
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,080
Speaker 1: Maybe in the future we'll have awesome GPS technology, you'll know exactly where everyone is, just looking at a little screen.

703
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,212
Speaker 0: And if you're calling people to organize dinner, it's already too late.

704
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,540
Speaker 0: You had to coordinate the dinner long before it's done.

705
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,291
Speaker 1: If it's a sitting down dinner, you have to take care of that way earlier.

706
00:51:54,331 --> 00:51:57,280
Speaker 1: You have to say early in the morning when everyone's still in the hotel room.

707
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,129
Speaker 1: "Alright everyone, remember...".

708
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,300
Speaker 1: And this will be the third time you're reminding them, by the way.

709
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:06,133
Speaker 1: "Tonight, at 8, we're all going to meet here and then decide on a restaurant.

710
00:52:06,394 --> 00:52:07,718
Speaker 1: If you're not there at 8, you're not

711
00:52:07,778 --> 00:52:08,039
Speaker 1: going.".

712
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:21,020
Speaker 0: Now if you're the one receiving calls, especially us, or if you're the person who's running this room or you're the one coordinating everything, just look at your phone periodically and see all the missed messages and then call back the people who deserve calls back.

713
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I make it a note that whenever I enter or leave an event at the con, I always just look at the phone.

714
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:30,960
Speaker 1: Mostly to see what time it is, but also to see if anyone left me a voicemail.

715
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:31,500
Speaker 0: Yep.

716
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,809
Speaker 0: And make sure you have some predefined meeting places.

717
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:39,300
Speaker 0: Like, pick a few places where you can meet that are obvious and you'll be able to find each other.

718
00:52:39,821 --> 00:52:43,040
Speaker 0: Again, not so much a concern at small cons, but large cons, it's critical.

719
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:44,599
Speaker 1: Very critical.

720
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:48,160
Speaker 0: And make sure it's a place where you can actually find the person.

721
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,980
Speaker 1: Make sure it's a place everyone actually knows, because a lot of times you'll be like, "Alright, everyone meet here," and people will go right, and they'll all go someplace different.

722
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:54,899
Speaker 1: Because they're all dumb.

723
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,340
Speaker 0: Or they'll all meet somewhere, and the place you specified is a giant auditorium with a movie playing full of people.

724
00:53:00,962 --> 00:53:01,051
Speaker 1: Yeah.

725
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:01,468
Speaker 1: Great.

726
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,991
Speaker 1: You usually want to pick an outdoors location that's not crowded.

727
00:53:05,212 --> 00:53:07,600
Speaker 1: That is sort of like a little ways from the con.

728
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:13,260
Speaker 0: And if you go to Otacon, don't pick the freaking fountains, because everyone's trying to meet everyone at the fountains.

729
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:14,899
Speaker 1: Fountains bad.

730
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:15,462
Speaker 1: Yeah.

731
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:17,600
Speaker 0: Plus all the cosplayers are there constantly.

732
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,940
Speaker 1: We usually pick, like, sculptures, or any sort of landmark is always good.

733
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:30,900
Speaker 0: Now, almost all cons have a dealer's room, and this will be pivotal to your experience at a con if you've never been to a con before.

734
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:38,180
Speaker 0: I mean, just to give you an example, Otacon, the dealer's room is, what, eleven football fields?

735
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:39,120
Speaker 1: It's not eleven football fields.

736
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,360
Speaker 0: It was nine football fields, right?

737
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,580
Speaker 1: I thought it was like four or five.

738
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,899
Speaker 0: No, it was nine at least.

739
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:43,616
Speaker 1: It was huge.

740
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,306
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

741
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:45,680
Speaker 1: It's very, very large.

742
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,260
Speaker 1: You can't see from one end to the other.

743
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:55,560
Speaker 1: I mean, it was about as big as more than one whole room at the Jacob Javits Center.

744
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:56,958
Speaker 1: Very large.

745
00:53:57,582 --> 00:54:03,120
Speaker 0: Now, basically to sum up, make sure you have money to pay for gas and everything home.

746
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,320
Speaker 0: Don't spend all your money in the dealer's room.

747
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:14,400
Speaker 0: Two, you probably want to pay with credit cards, because all the dealers will take it, even at little crap cons, and you don't want to be carrying wads of cash around in a sea of people.

748
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:23,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, but sometimes, like, one time I tried to buy a Gundam with a credit card, and they accepted it, but I had to go to, like, another booth and pay there, and it was a pain in the ass.

749
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:24,643
Speaker 1: So have cash also.

750
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:32,580
Speaker 1: But to make sure you can make it home, have enough cash to make it home and leave it in your hotel room in a safe spot so you can't possibly spend it.

751
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,670
Speaker 0: Furthermore, and this is kind of an aside, but ATMs and cash.

752
00:54:37,171 --> 00:54:40,480
Speaker 0: Bring cash with you to the con and keep it in the room or something.

753
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:44,119
Speaker 0: Or, if you don't have it with you yet, get it immediately from an ATM.

754
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,860
Speaker 1: And make as few withdrawals from ATMs as possible, because near convention centers, the ATM fees are insane.

755
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,420
Speaker 0: Well, not only that, more importantly...

756
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,939
Speaker 1: You don't pay ATM fees, but other people do.

757
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:54,388
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, whatever.

758
00:54:54,428 --> 00:54:55,340
Speaker 0: Your bank kinda sucks.

759
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,199
Speaker 1: My bank's awesome.

760
00:54:57,501 --> 00:55:05,080
Speaker 0: Paying...using ATMs is important more because the ATMs within a several mile radius of any large con will be completely empty by Friday night.

761
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:07,300
Speaker 1: And no one fills those things on the weekends.

762
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:13,056
Speaker 0: I was actually at a con, uh, Anime Central, where it was time to pay the lady for the suite.

763
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:14,380
Speaker 0: So I owed her, like, 80 bucks.

764
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:18,440
Speaker 0: And I figure, alright, fine, I go down to the ATM and I try to get money out, and it's empty.

765
00:55:19,301 --> 00:55:21,380
Speaker 0: And now I have no way of paying this woman.

766
00:55:23,066 --> 00:55:23,340
Speaker 1: Sucks.

767
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I ended up writing her a check, which I felt bad about.

768
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:29,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't write checks so much.

769
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:30,558
Speaker 0: Yeah.

770
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,500
Speaker 1: Another thing is, you generally want to have a dealer's room strategy.

771
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,960
Speaker 1: Like, if it's a little tiny dealer's room at a tiny con, don't worry about it.

772
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,660
Speaker 1: Just go in there once or twice and look over everything and buy anything you really want.

773
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:52,600
Speaker 1: And on Sunday, you can probably...well, on the last day of any convention, any dealer is usually trying to sell, you know, a whole bunch of stuff at the last minute.

774
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,780
Speaker 0: You'll get crazy deals.

775
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,060
Speaker 1: You can probably get a crazy deal if you're savvy.

776
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:59,199
Speaker 0: Our friend Scott Johnson is probably the Mac Master of this.

777
00:55:59,620 --> 00:55:59,711
Speaker 1: Yeah.

778
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:07,200
Speaker 0: We don't know how he does it, but Sunday, he just went into the dealer's room on his own, and he walked out with, like, a sack full of various goodies.

779
00:56:07,804 --> 00:56:09,180
Speaker 0: And it cost him almost nothing.

780
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:12,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, he comes up to us and he's like, "Here's all the DVDs I got at the

781
00:56:12,598 --> 00:56:12,880
Speaker 1: con.".

782
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,145
Speaker 1: And he's got this, like, tower.

783
00:56:14,165 --> 00:56:18,080
Speaker 1: It's like a five foot tall...well, not like five feet, but like a two and a half foot tall tower of DVDs.

784
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,886
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Yep, I got 40 DVDs here.

785
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:23,973
Speaker 1: Cost me, uh, let's see, 40 DVDs.

786
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:25,577
Speaker 1: It usually costs, let's see, times

787
00:56:25,577 --> 00:56:27,463
Speaker 1: $2,800.".

788
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:28,993
Speaker 1: He's like, "Yep, I paid, like, 150 bucks for

789
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:29,113
Speaker 1: this.".

790
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:31,449
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Holy

791
00:56:31,469 --> 00:56:32,778
Speaker 1: damn.".

792
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:35,699
Speaker 0: Granted, he's got a lot of bad anime as a result of this.

793
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:37,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know...

794
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,208
Speaker 0: But also the goodies.

795
00:56:38,289 --> 00:56:39,820
Speaker 0: He gets every little goodie for nothing.

796
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:41,103
Speaker 1: Mhm.

797
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:42,570
Speaker 1: Also, there's a lot of free stuff.

798
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,540
Speaker 1: they give away in dealer's rooms often.

799
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:46,189
Speaker 0: Well, only really at large cons.

800
00:56:46,229 --> 00:56:48,100
Speaker 0: I mean, I didn't get crap at Katsu-Con.

801
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:48,701
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

802
00:56:49,001 --> 00:57:02,860
Speaker 1: But when they give away free stuff, you want to have a time when you're about to go to your hotel room, go in, collect every free thing that you want at all, and then bring it back to your hotel room, because carrying it around the con sucks.

803
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:04,508
Speaker 0: That goes for buying things, too.

804
00:57:04,548 --> 00:57:06,940
Speaker 0: If you're buying anything big, buy it before you go into the room.

805
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:13,760
Speaker 0: Now, also, don't buy things that you can get outside of the con, because you'll probably pay a lot more.

806
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, be smart.

807
00:57:15,143 --> 00:57:21,420
Speaker 1: If you see something in the convention center that you can buy online or you can buy in another store, there's no reason to buy it there.

808
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,464
Speaker 0: The worst thing are those frickin' swords.

809
00:57:23,864 --> 00:57:31,240
Speaker 0: Every con now, they'll have one or two guys selling, like, paintball guns and airsoft guns and giant swords and stupid crap like that.

810
00:57:31,841 --> 00:57:33,587
Speaker 0: And fanboys just eat it up and they buy 'em.

811
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:34,610
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

812
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,040
Speaker 0: They're overpriced, they're crappy, you can't actually carry it around at the con.

813
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,758
Speaker 1: Now, if you're over 18 and a little kid comes up to you and says, "Hey, if I give you money, will you buy me a

814
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:45,099
Speaker 1: sword?".

815
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,242
Speaker 1: You say, "All

816
00:57:46,282 --> 00:57:46,463
Speaker 1: right.".

817
00:57:46,844 --> 00:57:49,250
Speaker 1: You don't say no, even though that's a good thing to say.

818
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:51,395
Speaker 1: You sure as hell don't just say yes, sure.

819
00:57:51,756 --> 00:57:53,140
Speaker 1: That's also a stupid thing to say.

820
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:55,345
Speaker 1: What you say is, "How much is the

821
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:55,766
Speaker 1: sword?".

822
00:57:56,388 --> 00:57:57,971
Speaker 1: And let's say he says the sword's 100 bucks.

823
00:57:57,992 --> 00:58:00,297
Speaker 1: You say, "You give me 150 and I'll buy you the $100

824
00:58:00,297 --> 00:58:00,397
Speaker 1: sword.".

825
00:58:01,641 --> 00:58:05,560
Speaker 1: That's the way to do it, because then you go and you get a $50 awesome thing somewhere else.

826
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, I generally disagree with that.

827
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,651
Speaker 1: No, I like it.

828
00:58:09,692 --> 00:58:10,139
Speaker 1: It's a good way.

829
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:21,540
Speaker 0: Well, one, that doesn't work, because usually they ship the sword to your hotel room or they give it to you in a giant sealed box and you're escorted out, then you have to take it and store it somewhere.

830
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,659
Speaker 0: Mostly they make you ship them home.

831
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:25,487
Speaker 1: I'd ship them home.

832
00:58:25,608 --> 00:58:26,720
Speaker 1: I'd just give them the kid's address.

833
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't work if you have the credit card.

834
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:31,320
Speaker 1: I guess not.

835
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,639
Speaker 0: Because the billing address doesn't match up.

836
00:58:33,342 --> 00:58:33,880
Speaker 1: It all depends.

837
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's dumb.

838
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,079
Speaker 0: Don't buy swords for little kids.

839
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,313
Speaker 1: Well, not like little kids, but like a 16-year-old kid.

840
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, a 16-year-old punk kid.

841
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:42,860
Speaker 0: You want to give him a sword at an anime con.

842
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,640
Speaker 1: Hey, if he's done with it, that's his problem.

843
00:58:47,542 --> 00:58:48,907
Speaker 1: Plus, you can always deny.

844
00:58:48,927 --> 00:58:52,700
Speaker 1: You can be like, "No, I was just buying the sword for me," and then you make off with the kid's money.

845
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:54,119
Speaker 1: All right.

846
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,018
Speaker 1: He was dumb enough to give it to you.

847
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:03,640
Speaker 0: Well, that said, we've talked a long time about a lot of topics with very little organization, and I think we're going to have to do a part three in this series.

848
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,000
Speaker 1: What are we going to talk about in part three?

849
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:12,260
Speaker 0: Basically, first of all, we've got to talk about how to leave the con, which is actually more complicated than you'd think.

850
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,244
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised.

851
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:21,860
Speaker 0: If you don't plan out leaving the con at the end of your experience, you're going to have a nightmare, and you won't do anything fun on Sunday.

852
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:29,840
Speaker 1: If there's a time when you have to check out of the hotel by, and if you don't check out by then, the hotel yells at you for leaving late.

853
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,953
Speaker 0: And in fact, that time is a lie, because you want to check out four hours before that.

854
00:59:33,993 --> 00:59:35,920
Speaker 0: if you want any chance of having a good time on Sunday.

855
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, because think about it.

856
00:59:37,625 --> 00:59:40,580
Speaker 1: That time when you have to check out is while there's convention happening.

857
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:48,060
Speaker 0: That, and we'll also talk about most cons have a dance or a rave, and we have many opinions regarding those.

858
00:59:48,843 --> 00:59:49,980
Speaker 1: That's a good thing to talk about.

859
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:50,905
Speaker 0: So?

860
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:59,040
Speaker 1: Oh, we should probably also talk about if a lot of conventions, even of all sorts, have artists' alleys or things nowadays.

861
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:00,960
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, we'll also talk about the artists' alleys.

862
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:05,540
Speaker 1: We'll talk about what to do if you want to be in the artists' alley or visit it and such.

863
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,244
Speaker 0: Yep.

864
01:00:06,874 --> 01:00:07,260
Speaker 0: We out.

865
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:16,699
Speaker 0: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

866
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:19,310

Speaker 0: Geek Nights airs every weeknight, Monday through Thursday.

873
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:46,130
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

874
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,010
Speaker 1: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
