1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,327
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 17th.

2
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:11,989
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,592
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,672 --> 00:00:13,877
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:16,181
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about four swords on the GameCube.

6
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:26,946
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,575
Speaker 1: So, you know, I used to, I'm not Irish, Rym, you're not Irish at all, are you?

8
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:35,459
Speaker 1: Faith in Bagora!

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,503
Speaker 1: No, you're not.

10
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:37,568
Speaker 1: But, you know, St.

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,649
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day was always just sort of like this fun sort of nothing holiday.

12
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:44,698
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't really care about it either way, but it was sort of fun.

13
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:55,234
Speaker 1: Like, you know, the leprechaun and, you know, it's sort of, you know, you get some lucky charms and all that, you know, it's all right.

14
00:00:55,254 --> 00:01:00,554
Speaker 0: Well, I remember when I was a kid, it was my favorite non-Christmas, non-birthday holiday.

15
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:01,398
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

16
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:01,960
Speaker 1: Wow.

17
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:04,048
Speaker 1: I've never had strong feelings about it.

18
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:07,742
Speaker 0: It speaks of my ego when I think about it that I called my birthday a holiday.

19
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:10,774
Speaker 0: But, I remember as a kid, St.

20
00:01:10,794 --> 00:01:18,332
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day was the best day in the world because one, in preschool, we had, there was one area of the preschool that had this giant tank of water and all these pumps and stuff.

21
00:01:18,934 --> 00:01:20,398
Speaker 0: They dyed the water green.

22
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:24,890
Speaker 0: And two, I liked green a lot when I was a kid.

23
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,374
Speaker 1: I also liked green.

24
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:26,562
Speaker 1: So it was the green holiday.

25
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:29,217
Speaker 1: Even though I liked green, I didn't like it enough to care about the holiday.

26
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:32,734
Speaker 0: I would wear like green sweatpants and a green sweater on St.

27
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:33,337
Speaker 0: Patrick's Day.

28
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:33,719
Speaker 0: Anyway.

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,623
Speaker 0: When I was like six.

30
00:01:35,064 --> 00:01:37,917
Speaker 1: But in recent years, I have come to dislike St.

31
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:38,580
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day.

32
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,713
Speaker 1: And the reason for that, well, it's not that much that I dislike the holiday is that I dread the holiday because what happens is there are two things.

33
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,830
Speaker 1: Number one, in Beacon, the town in which we live, there is a pub crawl.

34
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,696
Speaker 1: A pub crawl is cool if you like.

35
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:56,495
Speaker 0: I believe last year the pub crawl was, we were recording the show when it was going on.

36
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:57,098
Speaker 1: Yeah.

37
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:01,858
Speaker 1: And basically what, if you don't know, these people walk around town getting drunk.

38
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,277
Speaker 0: Now you might think it couldn't be that big of a deal in Beacon, but Beacon's a city.

39
00:02:06,317 --> 00:02:07,182
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people here.

40
00:02:07,202 --> 00:02:10,678
Speaker 0: And two, the pub crawl has been going on forever.

41
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,411
Speaker 1: When the pub crawl happens, I think they said there were like a few thousand people.

42
00:02:14,472 --> 00:02:18,105
Speaker 1: It's just everyone from all the surrounding towns comes in.

43
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,892
Speaker 1: You know, it's not just the Beacon people.

44
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:21,722
Speaker 0: It's this long old tradition.

45
00:02:21,742 --> 00:02:30,445
Speaker 0: Like the Beacon pub crawl has been going on forever and they'll gather at one part, like on the edge of town, which, and we live kind of on the edge of town and they'll all walk past our house.

46
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:32,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, we live right near some pubs too.

47
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,923
Speaker 1: There's like two across the street from each other.

48
00:02:34,245 --> 00:02:36,133
Speaker 1: And then there's a long road without any pubs.

49
00:02:36,193 --> 00:02:40,932
Speaker 0: Oh, speaking of which, speaking of which, that bar down the street is for sale, right?

50
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:42,699
Speaker 1: Which bar for sale?

51
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:46,553
Speaker 0: The white one on the left, right down, like right across in the Barking Frog.

52
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:46,895
Speaker 1: Yes.

53
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,421
Speaker 0: OK, so I looked into it.

54
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:49,886
Speaker 0: It's not that expensive.

55
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:53,464
Speaker 0: And it's dual use residential commercial because there's an apartment in it upstairs.

56
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:54,911
Speaker 1: You want to live in the bar?

57
00:02:55,553 --> 00:02:57,199
Speaker 0: It's not more expensive than a house.

58
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,394
Speaker 0: I could just use the bar as the most awesome party room ever.

59
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:03,723
Speaker 1: I thought you would actually want to run the bar.

60
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:07,979
Speaker 0: No, I would just stock the bar and have my own private bar.

61
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,026
Speaker 1: I thought you wanted to run the bar to get money.

62
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:11,633
Speaker 0: No, no, because I don't want to.

63
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:15,715
Speaker 0: I don't want to deal with having the commercial property to be used for commercial business anyway.

64
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:20,048
Speaker 1: So also on this today is actually St.

65
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,256
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day, which means that there's a St.

66
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:25,651
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day parade in the city, which is cool because parades are awesome.

67
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:30,510
Speaker 1: And it's it's got some of my favorite things in that parade, like pipes and drums.

68
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:35,588
Speaker 0: Now, luckily, I get up in the morning early enough to not have to deal with this.

69
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:37,876
Speaker 0: So my morning train, like I forgot it was St.

70
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:38,479
Speaker 0: Patty's Day.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,001
Speaker 1: Yep.

72
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:39,824
Speaker 0: I went to work.

73
00:03:39,864 --> 00:03:46,345
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, if you take most of the trains, most of the trains you take today on St.

74
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:49,959
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day are full of people going to the parade, which is fine.

75
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,947
Speaker 1: You know, you know, parade people on the train.

76
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,835
Speaker 1: Big deal just means there's a few less seats.

77
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:54,778
Speaker 1: No, no problem.

78
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:55,441
Speaker 1: I get a seat.

79
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,809
Speaker 1: You know, the thing is the St.

80
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,993
Speaker 1: Patrick's Day parade, most of the people going to it are drunken and stupid high school and college kids.

81
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,402
Speaker 1: And they they can't wait to get to the parade.

82
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:14,247
Speaker 1: So as a result, they get drunk and go, woo, which I, you know, I dealt with that in college, living in colony.

83
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,090
Speaker 1: It was no problem.

84
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,716
Speaker 0: In fact, I would say is entertaining.

85
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:21,940
Speaker 0: I would say that the pub crawl every year when it happens, while I'm annoyed because there's drunks everywhere.

86
00:04:21,982 --> 00:04:28,207
Speaker 0: And of course, at the end of the night, every year, there's a giant police rush as someone get hurts themselves.

87
00:04:28,327 --> 00:04:29,571
Speaker 1: I get to talk about that.

88
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:36,047
Speaker 0: But it's weird how nostalgic it makes me feel for college.

89
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:40,422
Speaker 0: I was laying in bed and I heard like, woo, and a bunch of people yelling outside.

90
00:04:41,044 --> 00:04:43,433
Speaker 0: And if I kept my eyes closed, I felt like I was in colony.

91
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,060
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the warm glow of a burning couch.

92
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:46,622
Speaker 1: Yep.

93
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:56,330
Speaker 1: But when they're going, woo, when it's nine thirty in the morning and I'm going or eight thirty or whatever eight to

94
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:59,480
Speaker 0: fuck you, I think the five thirty train,

95
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:07,698
Speaker 1: it's like eight thirty and I'm on this train and I'm in all these college and high school kids are going woo and getting drunk because they brought beers with them and it's not good.

96
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:11,837
Speaker 1: And then like as soon as they get off the train in Grand Central, they all light up.

97
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:16,373
Speaker 1: So now it's like they got to walk through all this smoke to get back to Grand Central.

98
00:05:16,855 --> 00:05:26,090
Speaker 1: And the only thing that saves like them from smoking actually in Grand Central is the fact that like the police lined up at the end before they actually got into the train station.

99
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,935
Speaker 0: Yeah.

100
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:31,104
Speaker 1: But so, yeah, that was it was not a pleasant ride in.

101
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:37,013
Speaker 1: I mean, the weird thing was, you know, I sort of listened to what some of the kids are saying and most of them are just saying stupid nonsense.

102
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:37,334
Speaker 1: Yeah.

103
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:44,650
Speaker 0: It's weird when you listen to those people because there's like the stereotype of the people what get drunk on trains and talk to each other who obviously aren't commuters.

104
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,950
Speaker 0: They always have the same like, I don't know, inane would be the word.

105
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,196
Speaker 0: But that doesn't really do it justice.

106
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,290
Speaker 0: Like the conversations don't make sense.

107
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 0: Like I'll listen to these kids.

108
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:56,110
Speaker 1: One thing doesn't make sense.

109
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:02,573
Speaker 1: One thing they were saying was this is the quiet car, which to me I felt really bad for people in the other cars.

110
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:10,430
Speaker 1: If my car was the quiet car, because even with my etymotic, it was pretty rough and I couldn't take a little nap to the train home for.

111
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:13,790
Speaker 0: Well, the best part of the day for me was I went out for lunch.

112
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:26,109
Speaker 0: I went out late and I'm walking around in the street and I see like 15 high school, early college girls all lined up, all being written citations as the police pour their containers of booze onto the street.

113
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:28,610
Speaker 0: It was pretty hilarious.

114
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,730
Speaker 0: Two of them were crying.

115
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:31,233
Speaker 1: It's good times.

116
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:35,286
Speaker 1: But so on the towards the end of the pub crawl.

117
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,889
Speaker 1: that night of the pub crawl, was it Saturday or Sunday?

118
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,189
Speaker 1: I forget which day it was.

119
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,450
Speaker 1: You know, there was this police rush.

120
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:50,210
Speaker 0: We noticed all these police cars going whoosh past our past our house because me, Scott and Emily, we were watching It Happened One Night, which is a fantastic old movie.

121
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:50,913
Speaker 1: It's very good.

122
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:55,114
Speaker 0: It's like it's the opposite of the screwball comedy Scott hates, because this is a movie.

123
00:06:55,134 --> 00:06:57,210
Speaker 1: Well, it's not that I don't like the screwball comedy.

124
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,210
Speaker 0: God doesn't like it when a character is stupid and could have solved something by just saying no or punching someone.

125
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:03,713
Speaker 1: Exactly.

126
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,269
Speaker 1: Which is why Astro Boy is so great.

127
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:06,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

128
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,673
Speaker 0: But anyway, we're watching this movie and like a cop goes by like, all right, you know, that happens.

129
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:13,790
Speaker 0: then another then another and then like five more.

130
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,739
Speaker 0: Basically, every cop in town went by and a couple of state troopers and then detectives start going by.

131
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,069
Speaker 1: So do you know why?

132
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,270
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

133
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,889
Speaker 1: I'd rest on Google News.

134
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:23,612
Speaker 1: I didn't real.

135
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,927
Speaker 1: I saw the story on Google News a couple of times, but I didn't.

136
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:29,489
Speaker 1: I didn't actually stop to read it until I realized it said Beacon on it.

137
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,650
Speaker 1: Oh, apparently it was not just cops from Beacon.

138
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,690
Speaker 1: It was cops from Fishkill and Newburgh and Wappingers.

139
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:39,930
Speaker 0: Did the incident itself happen in Beacon?

140
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:40,934
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

141
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,770
Speaker 1: I think it happened right over there at the Barking Frog or whatever.

142
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,710
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be the Barking Frog in that other bar.

143
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,610
Speaker 0: That's like where they all congregate at the end of the night.

144
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,739
Speaker 1: I think that's where it happened.

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,628
Speaker 1: But do you know what it was?

146
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:50,890
Speaker 0: A stabbing.

147
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,970
Speaker 1: A three hundred man brawl.

148
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,465
Speaker 1: Yeah, really.

149
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,369
Speaker 1: Oh, see that night.

150
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:57,720
Speaker 0: What did I say?

151
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,570
Speaker 0: What did Rym say?

152
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,549
Speaker 0: Let's walk over there and see what's going on.

153
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,190
Speaker 0: What did what did Scott Emily say?

154
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,529
Speaker 0: Now we shouldn't go over there.

155
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:05,350
Speaker 0: We could have seen a brawl.

156
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,990
Speaker 1: I think we were too late for the brawl by the time the cops showed up.

157
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,890
Speaker 0: You're never too late for a brawl because the best part of the brawl is the after man.

158
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,570
Speaker 1: Now, plus, I think something like 16 or so people were arrested for like riot something something.

159
00:08:20,514 --> 00:08:21,610
Speaker 0: They were trying to wait a minute.

160
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,410
Speaker 0: So we had a riot at RIT while we were there and now we had a riot in Beacon.

161
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,330
Speaker 1: We have this power where we never actually cause any trouble.

162
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,506
Speaker 1: But there are riots near us all the time, at least twice in less than a decade.

163
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,427
Speaker 0: So I think if we live in a place for more than three years, the chance of a riot happening approaches one.

164
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:47,590
Speaker 1: So let's move somewhere where they really want a riot, like, you know, some place that really needs one, like Darfur or something.

165
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,449
Speaker 1: Let's move there and a riot will happen.

166
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,910
Speaker 0: So usually riots rarely accomplish much.

167
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,090
Speaker 0: I don't think there are any places that need riots have accomplished a little bit.

168
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,236
Speaker 0: You know, I'd make a Firefly joke that's relevant, but you wouldn't get it because you don't like Firefly.

169
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:04,150
Speaker 0: But there's a thuggy guy, right?

170
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,977
Speaker 0: And his name's Jane.

171
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,270
Speaker 0: He's like the biggest thug in the world.

172
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:10,010
Speaker 0: And a bunch of people revolted and had a riot because of some legend about him.

173
00:09:10,772 --> 00:09:11,495
Speaker 0: And he gets drunk.

174
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:16,968
Speaker 0: And when he finds out about this, he says, and I quote, you guys had a riot on account of me.

175
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:19,590
Speaker 0: It's a very bender moment.

176
00:09:19,932 --> 00:09:21,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty bender right there.

177
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:22,897
Speaker 1: They have riots.

178
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:24,329
Speaker 1: Riots can accomplish things.

179
00:09:25,091 --> 00:09:33,570
Speaker 0: They can accomplish me being thoroughly entertained as I watch the dogs take down a drunk college kid who tried to throw a second beer bottle at the police.

180
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:39,152
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there there's some famous riots that have, you know, that are that are good.

181
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:41,590
Speaker 1: Well, the violence part is not good.

182
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,570
Speaker 0: But, you know, name a riot that accomplished something, Scott.

183
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,674
Speaker 0: Well, you know, there was like the at the I mean, the French Revolution, they just murdered thousands.

184
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:54,474
Speaker 1: Well, no, like in Chicago and in the 60s with the with the students, what was the school?

185
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:57,030
Speaker 0: I don't think that accomplished.

186
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,490
Speaker 1: No, but, you know, you know what I'm saying?

187
00:09:59,670 --> 00:09:59,791
Speaker 1: Right.

188
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,629
Speaker 1: Or like the Rodney King or whatever.

189
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:02,856
Speaker 0: What?

190
00:10:02,876 --> 00:10:04,510
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

191
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:05,073
Speaker 1: What?

192
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
Speaker 0: I don't think I agree with you here.

193
00:10:08,051 --> 00:10:11,209
Speaker 1: But, you know, it wasn't riots just like drunken woo.

194
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,169
Speaker 1: It was, you know, it was a serious thing.

195
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,558
Speaker 0: But that I wouldn't say it's a I don't.

196
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,470
Speaker 0: I think everyone involved would have been better off had those riots not happened.

197
00:10:19,851 --> 00:10:21,790
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the riot at RIT was awesome.

198
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,950
Speaker 1: Well, at RIT, it wasn't much of a riot, really.

199
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,350
Speaker 0: It would have been more of a riot if the police hadn't come in in full SWAT gear with the pepper paint right away.

200
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,310
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, according to a newspaper, right.

201
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:39,969
Speaker 1: The what happened near us was a brawl, which is a little different from RIT, which is just a woo times a lot.

202
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,309
Speaker 0: Well, the chant of they can't.

203
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,667
Speaker 1: There's a difference between woo and hoda hoda hoda hoda hoda.

204
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:53,178
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's video game day.

205
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:55,960
Speaker 0: What do you got for me, Scott?

206
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,265
Speaker 1: So there was I guess there was some video game news going around, like, you know, you know, like the.

207
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:06,986
Speaker 1: there's part of the iPhone announcement today had some video game stuff in there.

208
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:08,280
Speaker 1: But I don't I don't give a shit.

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:08,622
Speaker 1: Right.

210
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:11,760
Speaker 0: But I got I got stuff to say about all that anyway.

211
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:24,120
Speaker 1: On Steam, Square Enix is on there now, which is sort of weird because you don't think of them as a PC game company or you think of them more as a PlayStation, you know, Super Nintendo and portable.

212
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:24,541
Speaker 1: Right.

213
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:29,865
Speaker 1: But now they got some PC games and one of the games they have in there is Last Remnant.

214
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:31,540
Speaker 1: So what the hell?

215
00:11:31,642 --> 00:11:32,519
Speaker 1: It's a free demo.

216
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:33,980
Speaker 1: Why the fuck not?

217
00:11:34,142 --> 00:11:34,407
Speaker 1: Right.

218
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:34,937
Speaker 1: I played it.

219
00:11:35,701 --> 00:11:38,110
Speaker 1: I didn't play the whole demo because it was.

220
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:41,126
Speaker 1: as I'm not even going to I'm not even going to delay.

221
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:42,078
Speaker 1: It was pretty ass.

222
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,556
Speaker 0: Well, you didn't say it right.

223
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,300
Speaker 0: And there you go.

224
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:56,439
Speaker 1: So basically this game sucks for all the same reasons that Final Fantasy eight sucks only with more suckage added on top of that.

225
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:56,842
Speaker 1: Right.

226
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,520
Speaker 1: So so just so people understand what I'm talking about.

227
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,440
Speaker 1: I played the Final Fantasy eight demo on the PC a long time ago, and I also played it on the PlayStation a little bit, you know, to its credit.

228
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,306
Speaker 0: I will say one thing.

229
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,380
Speaker 0: I did not like the game Final Fantasy eight.

230
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:11,200
Speaker 0: I think it would have made a great movie.

231
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,396
Speaker 1: No, no, probably.

232
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:12,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:18,859
Speaker 1: But the main problem I had with Final Fantasy eight and was that the menu, you know, you had to play the game of these menu things.

234
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,820
Speaker 1: Yet those basically menu things, there are menus, they were complicated, nonintuitive and incomprehensible, even with the instruction manual.

235
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:26,202
Speaker 1: Right.

236
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:32,020
Speaker 1: And I was like, I do the tutorial and the tutorial would be like, use a conjunction to combine magic.

237
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,840
Speaker 1: So I'd go into the menu and the word conjunction would be great out.

238
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,839
Speaker 1: And I'd be like, you just told me to do this.

239
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:41,560
Speaker 1: And the menu option is great out and it doesn't do anything.

240
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:45,180
Speaker 1: And I just got so frustrated with that incomprehensible bullshit.

241
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:49,560
Speaker 1: And because I couldn't figure out what they wanted, I couldn't beat any guys.

242
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,860
Speaker 1: So I died and was like, fuck that game.

243
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:54,357
Speaker 0: Yet I at least figured that part out.

244
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:55,187
Speaker 1: I couldn't.

245
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,079
Speaker 1: I couldn't even get that far.

246
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,568
Speaker 0: My beefs with the game were more long term and dealt with, you know, general Final Fantasy issues.

247
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,260
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this game last remnant.

248
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:03,581
Speaker 1: Right.

249
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:11,060
Speaker 1: So I start playing the game and basically, you know, there's a little bit of intro bits, but it sort of lets me play relatively quickly, which is nice.

250
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:15,240
Speaker 1: And I was using my Xbox 360 controller for the PC, which made it also nice.

251
00:13:15,481 --> 00:13:15,641
Speaker 1: Right.

252
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,600
Speaker 1: So I'm in a room with all these people and I can talk to them.

253
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,560
Speaker 1: And the user interface of talking is pretty good.

254
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:21,785
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:22,520
Speaker 1: You sort of look at you.

256
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,740
Speaker 1: It's a third person walking around thing and I'm walking around.

257
00:13:27,061 --> 00:13:30,121
Speaker 1: And, you know, if there's someone to talk to, they have a speech bubble above their head.

258
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:30,382
Speaker 1: Right.

259
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,782
Speaker 1: So I look at different people and whoever I'm looking at has the speech bubble.

260
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:35,974
Speaker 1: So that's how I know I can push A to.

261
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,100
Speaker 1: I always know who I'm talking to.

262
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,381
Speaker 1: Right.

263
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:42,886
Speaker 1: So I talk to everyone in the room and then I talk to the king and the king tells me to do some stuff.

264
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:44,819
Speaker 1: So there's a map and there's all these places to go.

265
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:47,958
Speaker 1: So I go to a place and there's all these people to talk to.

266
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,919
Speaker 1: So I'm like talking to people and doing nothing but talking to people for a good like 10 minutes.

267
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,879
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, back in Resident Evil land, zombies going up the hill.

268
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:58,783
Speaker 1: Right.

269
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,600
Speaker 1: It's like I'm just going around talking to people.

270
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,260
Speaker 1: And I'm like, fuck, I don't want to talk to people.

271
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,170
Speaker 1: I want to do something.

272
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,020
Speaker 1: Where the hell is the game?

273
00:14:06,182 --> 00:14:06,403
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:10,566
Speaker 1: So and plus what they were saying, I didn't care about it, didn't make any sense.

275
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,760
Speaker 1: I guess it looked kind of pretty.

276
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,160
Speaker 1: Right.

277
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:22,580
Speaker 1: Anyway, I eventually talked to someone who was like, you know, and I forget exactly what they were saying, but it was basically like, hey, you want to go fight in a dungeon where there's an adventure?

278
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,569
Speaker 1: Let's go on this quest.

279
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:24,440
Speaker 1: And I could be like, yes, no.

280
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,388
Speaker 1: So I was like, yeah, let's go.

281
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,560
Speaker 1: Fuck, finally.

282
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,480
Speaker 1: So I pretty much just like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

283
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,939
Speaker 1: To everything that they said until I actually got somewhere with something to do.

284
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:35,880
Speaker 1: So I get there, this dungeon and there's some more talking.

285
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:41,960
Speaker 1: And then eventually I'm done talking and I see sort of a monster walking around.

286
00:14:42,021 --> 00:14:42,427
Speaker 1: So that was.

287
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,200
Speaker 1: that was nice.

288
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,780
Speaker 1: It wasn't random encounters, right?

289
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:45,123
Speaker 1: It was.

290
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:46,859
Speaker 1: you can see a monster over there.

291
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:49,660
Speaker 1: And if you want to fight it, you know, you walk over to it.

292
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,020
Speaker 1: And instead of the speech bubble above its head, it's like two swords, right, that are crossed, which means combat.

293
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:55,867
Speaker 0: All right.

294
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:56,071
Speaker 0: All right.

295
00:14:56,802 --> 00:14:57,940
Speaker 1: So I enter some combat.

296
00:14:58,441 --> 00:15:04,939
Speaker 1: And for some reason, even though up until now I've only ever seen my one character, I had a whole party I didn't know about.

297
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:06,379
Speaker 1: So that was a little strange.

298
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,700
Speaker 1: And I go to fight this monster and like this combat.

299
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:20,620
Speaker 1: Right now, I expected, you know, RPG turn based combat guys, good guys on the left, bad guys on the right, attack, magic, defend, run away, that sort of thing.

300
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:20,922
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:22,980
Speaker 1: And I think that was in there somewhere.

302
00:15:23,581 --> 00:15:29,080
Speaker 1: But if it was, I couldn't find it because basically what happened is this camera is jumping around all over the place.

303
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,420
Speaker 1: It's like and everyone is like constantly doing something.

304
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,840
Speaker 1: So it's like it's like a bad guy attacked me, another bad guy attacked someone else.

305
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,120
Speaker 1: And I attacked someone and I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on.

306
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,360
Speaker 1: There was no explanation, no tutorial, no nothing.

307
00:15:42,882 --> 00:15:45,020
Speaker 1: There was some choices to me, like push buttons.

308
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:50,784
Speaker 1: But it wasn't like basic, you know, comprehensible things like attack that bad guy.

309
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:52,199
Speaker 1: It was it was something else.

310
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:57,308
Speaker 1: And I just sort of like push some buttons and then some stuff happened and I didn't understand it.

311
00:15:57,329 --> 00:15:58,019
Speaker 1: And I think I won.

312
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:03,283
Speaker 1: I killed the bad guys, but it was going so fast and the camera was jumping all over the place.

313
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,138
Speaker 1: I didn't I couldn't tell.

314
00:16:04,804 --> 00:16:05,979
Speaker 1: It just sort of did its thing.

315
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,883
Speaker 1: And I was like, what the.

316
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:23,386
Speaker 1: So after all that talking and not doing anything I cared about, there was a combat which, you know, if it was a standard RPG combat that I was used to, I would have been like, OK, it's a lovely RPG, but it was a RPG combat that made no sense.

317
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,060
Speaker 1: So I was like all that.

318
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,378
Speaker 1: And there's still no game here.

319
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:29,990
Speaker 1: The game is just walk around and like.

320
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,565
Speaker 1: there was no game as far as I could tell, at least in this demo.

321
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,000
Speaker 1: And at that point, I didn't even finish the demo.

322
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Speaker 1: I was just like, fuck this, I'm done.

323
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:54,519
Speaker 1: I mean, I expected it to be a black modern RPG that I would not like, but it was just, you know, if it was a black modern RPG, you know, say something like, you know, like a Final Fantasy seven kind of structure to it.

324
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:56,520
Speaker 1: I probably would have played the whole demo.

325
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,180
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have been like, oh, it's the best game ever.

326
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,360
Speaker 1: But I've been like, hey, it's a standard RPG.

327
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,862
Speaker 1: What do you want?

328
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,308
Speaker 1: But no, this was.

329
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,920
Speaker 1: this was pretty painful for me to play.

330
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:12,739
Speaker 1: So painful, I couldn't bear to continue or bother to invest any amount of effort to figure it out because it was not worth it.

331
00:17:13,181 --> 00:17:22,500
Speaker 1: It's like even if I had taken the time to figure out how that combat worked, there was no conceivable way in which that combat would have been fun, no matter how it worked.

332
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,980
Speaker 1: It would it was less.

333
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,895
Speaker 1: Even if I knew every detail about the system, it would have been.

334
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:29,015
Speaker 1: I can.

335
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:33,760
Speaker 1: I just know it would have been less fun than like Final Fantasy six combat.

336
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:49,130
Speaker 1: So fucking last remnant demo on steam, if you like Japanese RPGs and such, you know, maybe I guess Final Fantasy, more of the recent ones like twelve or X two or whatever the hell they're doing now, you might want to try it.

337
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,719
Speaker 1: Hell, it's a free demo.

338
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,900
Speaker 1: Try it anyway.

339
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,879
Speaker 1: You know, who gives a shit, but don't spend your money on it unless you're a crazy Square Enix fanboy.

340
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:03,159
Speaker 0: Well, I haven't played it, so I guess I can't say you should you should try it.

341
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:03,864
Speaker 0: Should I?

342
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I will try the free demo.

343
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:07,559
Speaker 1: Don't try the real thing.

344
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,440
Speaker 0: But there's there's much more.

345
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,060
Speaker 0: It's pretty news something.

346
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,770
Speaker 0: It's frightening, but in a different way, this.

347
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,162
Speaker 0: this sounds like it was frightening in a very visceral way.

348
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:30,047
Speaker 0: I realized how old I am today because 10 years and one day ago, an entire decade ago on this day and another day on this day, March 17th, well, 10 years and a day.

349
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,581
Speaker 1: OK, so March 16.

350
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:31,841
Speaker 1: All right.

351
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:33,447
Speaker 0: EverQuest started.

352
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,420
Speaker 0: EverQuest is 10 years, 10 years ago was EverQuest.

353
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,700
Speaker 0: You know, it was 10 years before EverQuest Paris Troika.

354
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,641
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:18:42,304 --> 00:18:45,640
Speaker 1: So that's sort of crazy because I remember in late high school.

356
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,424
Speaker 1: So we're talking.

357
00:18:46,504 --> 00:18:50,334
Speaker 1: it must have been like ninety seven, ninety eight, something around those times.

358
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:50,558
Speaker 1: Right.

359
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,588
Speaker 0: Nineteen ninety seven.

360
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:52,919
Speaker 1: I was playing some muds.

361
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,127
Speaker 1: I was playing muds.

362
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,140
Speaker 1: I had a mud client on a floppy disk.

363
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:11,119
Speaker 1: I'd bring to school, press F3 to get the search window, then right click on something and explore, get the to get Explorer open because they took the icon away, go to the a drive, double click on my mud client, then connect to the mud server and play muds in the computer lab during study hall.

364
00:19:11,444 --> 00:19:12,580
Speaker 0: See, I carried around.

365
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:16,260
Speaker 0: I had the realm installer and I would install the realm on all the PCs I use.

366
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:17,222
Speaker 0: Whoa.

367
00:19:17,383 --> 00:19:21,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I installed a thing where it knew when you installed something.

368
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,024
Speaker 1: So it would work.

369
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:26,559
Speaker 1: But then someone would get alerted to it and they'd come and get you like I installed flash once.

370
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,419
Speaker 0: And they're like, hey, see, well, I just logged in through the winds.

371
00:19:31,361 --> 00:19:32,129
Speaker 1: We didn't have winds.

372
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,340
Speaker 1: We had Nobel Netwares.

373
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:40,479
Speaker 0: See, we had the winds and I had the administrator password because it was written on a piece of paper on the desk in the computer room.

374
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:41,309
Speaker 1: Wow.

375
00:19:41,391 --> 00:19:41,492
Speaker 1: Wow.

376
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:46,760
Speaker 1: But anyway, the mud that I played, I forget what the mud was called.

377
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,630
Speaker 1: My brother also played it, but it was just.

378
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:53,000
Speaker 1: it was just some it was just a mud out there that had like 50 or so people playing it.

379
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,440
Speaker 1: And I even made a cool area in the mud and whatever.

380
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:59,894
Speaker 1: But the mud was running on.

381
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:01,940
Speaker 1: you know, there are many mud engines out there.

382
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,161
Speaker 1: Right.

383
00:20:02,181 --> 00:20:06,303
Speaker 1: And it was this one was running on Daiku mud, which was a very popular mud engine in the days.

384
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:09,300
Speaker 1: And people don't realize this nowadays.

385
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:17,059
Speaker 1: But EverQuest, you know, and in those days, you know, before my newfound, you know, I'm pretty sure we've talked about this on the show before.

386
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

387
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:22,500
Speaker 1: But in those days, long before, you know, MMOs and my dislike of them.

388
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:22,861
Speaker 1: Right.

389
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:32,400
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, man, if only this had graphics amends amends and EverQuest is literally it is a Daiku mud with graphics.

390
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,558
Speaker 1: That's literally what it is.

391
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,159
Speaker 1: People don't realize that, but it's the exact same thing.

392
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:45,940
Speaker 0: But I realize now what's going on with MMOs because thinking about EverQuest being this old and seeing the progression in the areas of MMOs, it is EverQuest still playable.

393
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:47,780
Speaker 0: I imagine.

394
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,321
Speaker 0: All right.

395
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:56,201
Speaker 0: EverQuest went live on March 16th, nineteen ninety nine and rose to gamer fame over the next decade, spawning fifteen expansions, full blown sequel, blah, blah, blah, whatever.

396
00:20:56,241 --> 00:21:02,965
Speaker 0: Anyway, what I realized is that remember FPS is FPS is came out and there were a few initial forays.

397
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:08,699
Speaker 0: and then there was like the Doom era where Doom was the FPS and there were a lot of copiers of Doom.

398
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:09,798
Speaker 0: But Doom was it.

399
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,680
Speaker 0: And some people played all those kind of half ass Doom clones and whatever.

400
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:19,160
Speaker 0: And it took a long time for someone to break the mold and make a different game.

401
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,840
Speaker 0: You know, that was when Quake came out and that was like the first steps.

402
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,320
Speaker 0: And then there was the Quake two era rise of the trade and that lasted forever.

403
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:28,060
Speaker 0: And then, you know, after that, things changed.

404
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,559
Speaker 0: Then there was like the third era and FPS has kept changing.

405
00:21:31,882 --> 00:21:33,138
Speaker 0: MMOs are not that old.

406
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:38,857
Speaker 0: And I feel like the MMOs have not tried that much ground compared to like.

407
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,080
Speaker 0: they're having the same number of eras, but it's taking more time to get from one era to the next.

408
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:55,121
Speaker 0: I mean, MMOs today are like the World of Warcraft, which is like the best MMO in the world is basically just the kind of most polished you can have version of the original MMO.

409
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:58,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's fundamentally on the fundamental level.

410
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:00,900
Speaker 1: It is identical to the Daiku mud.

411
00:22:01,261 --> 00:22:04,736
Speaker 1: It's just that what they did is they polished all of the surface level.

412
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:11,878
Speaker 1: frustrations is the same way that, you know, Mario three is actually fundamentally identical.

413
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:15,259
Speaker 1: to say Mario one is really no different than the same thing.

414
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:18,300
Speaker 1: It's just Mario three has all this polish on it.

415
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,759
Speaker 1: And that's what World of Warcraft is.

416
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,543
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

417
00:22:20,563 --> 00:22:24,160
Speaker 0: But then Mario 64 was I mean, the different dimension.

418
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,920
Speaker 0: You were basically making a different game.

419
00:22:26,264 --> 00:22:27,240
Speaker 0: It is completely different.

420
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,196
Speaker 0: And FPS is when they jump to 3D.

421
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:30,930
Speaker 0: Everything changed.

422
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,880
Speaker 0: It was a completely different game.

423
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,140
Speaker 0: And then the Half-Life mod revolution changed things a thousand times over again.

424
00:22:36,881 --> 00:22:41,721
Speaker 0: But MMOs like World of Warcraft, I don't feel like it's really gotten past its roots and no one.

425
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,360
Speaker 0: I don't see anyone doing anything terribly innovative.

426
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:48,259
Speaker 0: And the people that are those MMOs don't succeed.

427
00:22:48,841 --> 00:22:55,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of MMOs that try to do something cool or pretend they're doing something cool, but really they're not.

428
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:06,050
Speaker 0: But anyway, I don't want to talk about EverQuest, so it's time for things of the day.

429
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:12,233
Speaker 0: Now, this might seem like a strange aside, but it's relevant to my interest and I hope you find it cool.

430
00:23:12,715 --> 00:23:22,402
Speaker 0: A while ago, I talked about this book by Dan Simmons called The Terror, and I highly recommend it unless you're squeamish because you'll learn a lot about scurvy and lead poisoning and yetis.

431
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:24,628
Speaker 1: I like yetis.

432
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:25,964
Speaker 0: It is a...

433
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,325
Speaker 1: Wait, what's your favorite yeti?

434
00:23:29,656 --> 00:23:30,749
Speaker 0: The Abominable Snowman.

435
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:31,730
Speaker 1: From what?

436
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:37,866
Speaker 0: I assume you're referring to the one that is modeled after Of Mice and Men, the Bugs Bunny one.

437
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,610
Speaker 1: No, let's talk about the one in Ski Free.

438
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:45,149
Speaker 1: Oh, I like the one in Ski Free because he's like...

439
00:23:47,313 --> 00:23:49,709
Speaker 0: So I hated him because he stopped me from skiing free.

440
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,910
Speaker 1: Well, no, I dodged him.

441
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,150
Speaker 1: What's the most times you ever dodged him in one go?

442
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,789
Speaker 0: I don't know, like once I played Ski Free a few times and got sick of it.

443
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:58,309
Speaker 1: Oh, I played Ski Free a lot.

444
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,509
Speaker 1: I could dodge the snowman like five times in a row.

445
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,690
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is a fantastic book and Dan Simmons is a fantastic author.

446
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:29,710
Speaker 0: But the book I didn't realize until I got about three quarters of the way through was based with one important exception, that exception being yetis on an absolutely true story and the number of like primary resources and accounts that the book, the accuracy of the book in terms of names and people and letters kind of disturbed me when I realized that these were real people who died.

447
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:34,030
Speaker 0: And I was reading this account that was, with the exception of yetis, 100 percent accurate.

448
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,123
Speaker 0: But the thing is, the book points out that, you know, this.

449
00:24:38,283 --> 00:24:41,209
Speaker 0: this was an Arctic expedition where everyone died.

450
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:47,450
Speaker 0: And part of the reason they died was that everyone went insane from lead poisoning and died of botulism and scurvy.

451
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,749
Speaker 0: It was a horrible experience.

452
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty bad.

453
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,569
Speaker 0: Well, there was a lot of debate as to what happened and like what really went on and why they died.

454
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,749
Speaker 1: And people in the Arctic unprepared will have those things happen to them.

455
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,048
Speaker 1: That's pretty much it.

456
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:04,666
Speaker 0: But similar expeditions had death rates of 15 to 20 percent.

457
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,462
Speaker 0: This one had 100 percent.

458
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:09,030
Speaker 0: And the thing is, people wondered what happened.

459
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:16,410
Speaker 0: And eventually they found the bodies and then they discovered that the bodies all were full of lead, like tons of lead, like crazy amounts of lead.

460
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:18,650
Speaker 0: So they were trying to figure out why.

461
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,870
Speaker 0: And they were blaming the solder on the tin food for a bunch of things.

462
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:32,810
Speaker 0: And I found this theory, this PDF that explains probably the best scientific theory as to what happened to these people that has ever been put forth.

463
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:33,995
Speaker 0: And it is.

464
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,090
Speaker 0: it is absolutely a fascinating read.

465
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:37,628
Speaker 0: It's short.

466
00:25:37,933 --> 00:25:38,729
Speaker 0: You can understand it.

467
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,750
Speaker 0: It's not super technical.

468
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:40,847
Speaker 0: It's pretty well backed up.

469
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:47,890
Speaker 0: It is entitled Identification of the Probable Source of the Lead Poisoning Observed in Members of the Franklin Expedition.

470
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,550
Speaker 0: The Franklin Expedition is famous.

471
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,790
Speaker 0: You can read about it on Wikipedia.

472
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:55,590
Speaker 0: If you want to read about it plus yetis, you can read Dan Simmons, The Terror.

473
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:10,770
Speaker 0: Seriously, this is a this is really neat to read, because basically the reason there was so much lead in these bodies was that they use this awesome, fancy, modern system of distilling fresh water from steam, from salt water.

474
00:26:11,594 --> 00:26:13,070
Speaker 0: And they made the whole thing out of lead.

475
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,470
Speaker 0: And within a year of being out at sea and trapped in the ice, everyone on the ship was completely insane with terminal lead poisoning.

476
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,348
Speaker 1: So if they had made that fancy system out of like steel, it would have been all good iron.

477
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:26,688
Speaker 0: There's a good chance they would have made it.

478
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:27,287
Speaker 1: Wow.

479
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:27,736
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,556
Speaker 0: Dang.

481
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,568
Speaker 0: Now, the thing is, botulism also played a big role because they went with the lowest bidder for the tin food.

482
00:26:36,272 --> 00:26:38,289
Speaker 0: But the lead was the primary factor here.

483
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:39,216
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

484
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:39,971
Speaker 1: What?

485
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:43,390
Speaker 1: There's no way to go back and punish that tin food guy.

486
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,470
Speaker 0: No, there really isn't.

487
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,710
Speaker 0: But the thing is, I found that out and then I read all the history and I'm mad at that guy.

488
00:26:48,972 --> 00:26:50,989
Speaker 0: I'm really mad, but he's already dead.

489
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,991
Speaker 1: Yeah.

490
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:54,190
Speaker 1: It's like he did it to himself and others.

491
00:26:54,993 --> 00:26:56,710
Speaker 0: But I don't think he died of lead poisoning.

492
00:26:57,713 --> 00:26:59,310
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe he died of too much money.

493
00:26:59,470 --> 00:26:59,756
Speaker 0: I don't know.

494
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:02,989
Speaker 1: OK, anyway, this is a fascinating read.

495
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,569
Speaker 1: So really, you know, looking at Nintendo's like what games are coming out from them.

496
00:27:07,936 --> 00:27:08,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

497
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:11,390
Speaker 1: There's only one real game that is looking any good in the near future.

498
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:12,770
Speaker 1: That's the Punch-Out remake.

499
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,976
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

500
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,470
Speaker 0: I think I made the trailer for that.

501
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,209
Speaker 0: My thing of the day.

502
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:20,870
Speaker 1: Speaking of Punch-Out, I have a Mike Tyson related thing of the day.

503
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,050
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

504
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,290
Speaker 0: We've had him on before.

505
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:24,433
Speaker 1: Yeah.

506
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:31,969
Speaker 1: You know, as I've said before, Mike Tyson is a terrible person, but he's incredibly fascinating and was incredibly talented at beating the shit out of people.

507
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:35,990
Speaker 0: Watching him punch people is like watching a gazelle punch people.

508
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:36,472
Speaker 1: Right.

509
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:37,248
Speaker 1: So.

510
00:27:38,552 --> 00:27:42,690
Speaker 1: Here is a photo gallery of Mike Tyson punching people.

511
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:49,810
Speaker 0: No, of at the parapety at the moment where someone realizes they're about to be punched by Mike Tyson.

512
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:58,470
Speaker 1: No, this is a photo gallery of Mike Tyson's abandoned Ohio mansion.

513
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:03,990
Speaker 1: Oh, there's like pool full of green water.

514
00:28:04,674 --> 00:28:06,110
Speaker 1: There's stereo equipment.

515
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:07,022
Speaker 1: It's like VCRs.

516
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,890
Speaker 1: And it's it's weird because you look at this place.

517
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:10,312
Speaker 1: Right.

518
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:13,185
Speaker 1: And it's such like 80s and 90s luxury.

519
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:16,710
Speaker 1: There's like furniture lying around and stuff.

520
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,921
Speaker 1: And I mean, like this is like a dual cassette deck and an old cable box, dual cassette.

521
00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:23,610
Speaker 0: Yeah.

522
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,950
Speaker 1: You can dub his own tapes and like you just look at like the switches on the wall.

523
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,635
Speaker 1: It's like everything about.

524
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:33,564
Speaker 1: it is so 80s and 90s, but it's.

525
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,530
Speaker 1: it's very, very interesting.

526
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,029
Speaker 1: And you should take a look.

527
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,210
Speaker 1: And it's amazing, like how much stuff is just left in there, you know?

528
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,475
Speaker 1: Well, I guess no one wants.

529
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,430
Speaker 1: no one wants this place, I guess, because it's in Ohio.

530
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:49,169
Speaker 0: And I'm going to make a joke about that.

531
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:52,070
Speaker 1: And also because, you know, Mike Tyson's name is written over.

532
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,850
Speaker 1: He's like his name is on the front gate.

533
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,630
Speaker 1: His name is on the patio, as you know, like the Hammer Mansion.

534
00:28:57,453 --> 00:28:57,758
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:58,409
Speaker 1: Sort of like the hair.

536
00:28:58,651 --> 00:28:58,852
Speaker 1: Right.

537
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:00,922
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's really kind of.

538
00:29:00,942 --> 00:29:04,070
Speaker 1: I mean, it's like this really weird zebra print like carpet.

539
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,670
Speaker 1: It's you should check it out.

540
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:07,648
Speaker 1: It's it's pretty cool.

541
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,405
Speaker 1: I kind of want to go there.

542
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:16,568
Speaker 0: So the other day we were sitting around thinking of something to do, you know, the usual beacon crew with this harkens back to our days.

543
00:29:17,431 --> 00:29:22,854
Speaker 0: We'll spend more time sitting around thinking, hey, what should we do than actually doing anything?

544
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:30,270
Speaker 0: But suddenly the idea came to us to play four swords because we had Emily, who had never played it, and we had Alex who played it a little bit.

545
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,989
Speaker 0: But and none of us had actually played it all the way through.

546
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:33,431
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:45,190
Speaker 1: And four swords is a game that I've played, you know, many times, but I've played like the early parts of the game over and over because every time we played, we started from the beginning and no, we never actually continued to get to the end.

548
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:51,729
Speaker 1: So I've only played like half the game, maybe, and I've played like the first parts of the game, you know, multiple times.

549
00:29:52,311 --> 00:30:03,130
Speaker 0: Now, it just so happens to that we have in our possession a basket of, I think, five GBAs and an SP and an extra D.S

550
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:15,169
Speaker 1: It's weird to think, right, when Nintendo first came out with this GBA GameCube connection cable system, right, for it was mostly used for four swords and Crystal Chronicles and not much else that I could think of.

551
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,556
Speaker 1: I guess you could use it with WarioWare GameCube so that you could use the GBA as your controller.

552
00:30:20,657 --> 00:30:21,810
Speaker 0: But there was no point.

553
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,862
Speaker 1: But I used it.

554
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:23,389
Speaker 1: It was all right.

555
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,370
Speaker 1: You used it because you could not that for any other reason, because I guess the GBA was a little bit simpler controller for you.

556
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,130
Speaker 1: There were some micro games where it helped.

557
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:34,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I kind of like to fidget with the L and R.

558
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:38,129
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it was actually easier to do the L and R on the.

559
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:39,790
Speaker 0: No, but you get so much analog.

560
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,750
Speaker 0: You get so much more fidgeting with the GameCube.

561
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you can push it so many more times with the digital.

562
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:55,090
Speaker 1: Anyway, the you know, and it was at the time that came out, there was all this, you know, hubbub like who has four GBAs and four cables?

563
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,630
Speaker 1: And it was like, well, everyone should have one GBA.

564
00:30:58,312 --> 00:31:00,709
Speaker 1: And if you have three friends, they should all have one GBA.

565
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,930
Speaker 1: Well, Nintendo made everyone buy one of these lousy cables for like 10 bucks.

566
00:31:05,211 --> 00:31:07,149
Speaker 0: Nintendo assumed two things.

567
00:31:07,731 --> 00:31:21,229
Speaker 0: And these two assumptions, I feel like more and more, especially after reading that whole Miyamoto was said during the GameCube era thing, Nintendo assumed that one, people want good games and two, that people who play games have friends.

568
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:21,990
Speaker 1: Yeah.

569
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:26,550
Speaker 1: And those were two assumptions that they sort of, I guess, realized were wrong.

570
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:42,550
Speaker 0: Well, at least have friends that live near them, because I realized that outside of college, very few people can snap their fingers and have four geeky friends willing to sit down and play a video game at the same time together.

571
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:47,290
Speaker 0: But yet in college, we had like 30 people who all had GPUs.

572
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:56,450
Speaker 0: When Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out, there were like five independent parties of four all playing the game the same weekend that we knew of.

573
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,469
Speaker 0: That was just the people in our friend group.

574
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:05,230
Speaker 0: It was pretty much everyone at RIT who wasn't masturbating or playing Counter-Strike or getting drunk was playing Crystal Chronicles that weekend.

575
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:05,718
Speaker 1: Yep.

576
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:14,490
Speaker 1: But anyway, so, you know, with four swords, you know, and these four, you know, you needed these four GBAs and a GameCube and the game.

577
00:32:15,292 --> 00:32:18,270
Speaker 1: Not a lot of people have had this experience, right?

578
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:22,290
Speaker 1: But the reality is that it's actually completely fantastic.

579
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,671
Speaker 1: When I

580
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:45,089
Speaker 0: think back to the GameCube era, I mean, there were like, it's weird how I look back now and I liked a lot of games in the GameCube, but after a couple of years of the Wii and playing a lot of the new games that Nintendo has been pushing out, I find myself gravitating when I have people over, you know, friend games, playing games with people in person more and more to GameCube games because the Wii is just not doing

581
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:45,149
Speaker 1: it.

582
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,650
Speaker 1: I mean, like the Smash Brothers for the Wii is an improvement over the GameCube, at least a little bit, right?

583
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,690
Speaker 0: Well, because it's just an incremental improvement on the GameCube game.

584
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,910
Speaker 1: They brought Mario Tennis to the Wii.

585
00:32:57,412 --> 00:33:01,528
Speaker 1: It's the same exact game, only worse because they changed the controls, which were perfect.

586
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:04,890
Speaker 0: And we need not speak of the abortion that was Smooth Moves.

587
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:11,830
Speaker 0: That game, that game was the biggest disparity between what I expected from a game and what I got that I've ever experienced.

588
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:16,310
Speaker 0: All expectations for everything in the rest of my life were lowered as a result of playing that game.

589
00:33:16,354 --> 00:33:16,486
Speaker 0: Yep.

590
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,456
Speaker 0: You've got wept the day.

591
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:25,190
Speaker 1: you've got some WiiWare party games on the Wii, like the Bomberman, which is actually kind of nice because you can get all eight people on it.

592
00:33:25,652 --> 00:33:27,469
Speaker 1: It says, yeah, it's pretty good.

593
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:37,790
Speaker 0: But it begs me how few people have played what I feel were some of the best multiplayer in the same room offerings in all of gaming.

594
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:45,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, Crystal Chronicles for the GameCube, even though Crystal Chronicles is really just sort of gauntlet as game wise, right?

595
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:55,090
Speaker 1: The the experience of each person having different information on their little Game Boy really just changes the whole thing around.

596
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,890
Speaker 0: It's weird how people look at the Wii and how innovative it was.

597
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:03,210
Speaker 0: But really, when you look back, the GameCube was where Nintendo really innovated.

598
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:08,370
Speaker 0: And I guess they realized that a lot of their innovation is not how to make money.

599
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:16,489
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't think anyone would say that the the GameCube controller hook up to the GBA was abominable failure.

600
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:17,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, all fronts.

601
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:20,710
Speaker 1: It was pretty much a monster, a monstrous failure.

602
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:24,451
Speaker 1: If you're from business perspective, you know, it probably didn't make them a lot of money.

603
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:30,089
Speaker 1: Well, Nintendo profits off everything, but it made them probably pennies compared to what they're making now.

604
00:34:30,192 --> 00:34:30,550
Speaker 1: Right.

605
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:40,929
Speaker 1: But actually, the games that came out of it and the potential for other games that never happened was so crazily large and so crazily amazing.

606
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:48,283
Speaker 1: I mean, you think about co-op games, nothing beats the co-op of the four GBA GameCube system.

607
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:48,570
Speaker 1: Yes.

608
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,070
Speaker 0: I mean, co-op with multiplayer on the PC or on the Xbox is great.

609
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,589
Speaker 0: And that's a wonderful way to play games.

610
00:34:54,032 --> 00:34:57,569
Speaker 0: But there's a different kind of gaming when you're sharing the same room.

611
00:34:58,232 --> 00:35:09,790
Speaker 0: And in the past, like until the first until these controllers came out, the only way to do that really was to either have hot seat, which isn't the same thing, or to have the split screen, which, while great.

612
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:13,890
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember I have fond memories of Bond was still not a massive improvement.

613
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:29,109
Speaker 0: But what the GameCube controller hook up with the GBA had to offer was a shared space in a physical location among four people, coupled with secret information, a private space for each individual player.

614
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:35,790
Speaker 0: And I can't impress upon you enough how much of a gaming revolution that was.

615
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,590
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, you could play Goldeneye, which is nothing secret.

616
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,330
Speaker 1: It's just a four way split screen.

617
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:42,674
Speaker 1: Right.

618
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,250
Speaker 1: You could play Counter Strike.

619
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:46,409
Speaker 1: Everyone has their own private screen.

620
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:54,462
Speaker 1: But what this is, is there's a public screen and everyone has a private screen and they could do this with the way the DS connects to the way.

621
00:35:54,482 --> 00:35:56,828
Speaker 1: there's no reason they couldn't make four swords.

622
00:35:56,951 --> 00:35:58,570
Speaker 1: We or even eight swords.

623
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,810
Speaker 1: We right where you have eight DS's that have two private screens.

624
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,290
Speaker 1: And then there's the one big public screen.

625
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,468
Speaker 1: They could totally do it.

626
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,252
Speaker 0: They just don't.

627
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:11,890
Speaker 0: They could even with the GBA or not the GBA, the DS, it has two screens.

628
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,189
Speaker 0: You could have just made Crystal Chronicles where everyone shares the top screen for private bottom screen.

629
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:21,390
Speaker 1: Well, there are co-op games for the DS's together, but they're all terrible.

630
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:30,310
Speaker 0: Like I think the example was Crystal Chronicles on the DS, which basically poke much like smooth moves or, you know, every other warrior or other than the GameCube one.

631
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:38,149
Speaker 0: They they took the parts of the game that were not worthwhile and enhance them and they got rid of the only part of the game we liked.

632
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:39,232
Speaker 1: Right.

633
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,140
Speaker 0: But I don't want to talk about.

634
00:36:41,422 --> 00:36:43,310
Speaker 0: I want to talk specifically about four.

635
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:45,690
Speaker 1: So well, four swords, actually, right.

636
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:49,570
Speaker 1: People I don't know how many people realize this, you know, who aren't Nintendo fans.

637
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:49,912
Speaker 1: Right.

638
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:53,710
Speaker 1: But Super Nintendo Zelda, which is what linked to the past.

639
00:36:54,031 --> 00:36:54,292
Speaker 0: Yep.

640
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:59,610
Speaker 1: Zelda three Zelda three linked to the past was re-released for the Game Boy Advance.

641
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:00,054
Speaker 1: Right.

642
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,650
Speaker 1: So it had come out for the Super Nintendo.

643
00:37:01,851 --> 00:37:07,698
Speaker 1: But by the time the GBA came out, a lot of people had not played it and the GBA was capable of playing it.

644
00:37:07,718 --> 00:37:09,190
Speaker 1: So they re-released it for the GBA.

645
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:13,450
Speaker 1: And when they did re-release it for the GBA, they added a dungeon to it.

646
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,350
Speaker 1: The hero's dungeon or the colored or whatever they called it.

647
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,574
Speaker 1: Right.

648
00:37:17,594 --> 00:37:21,410
Speaker 1: And they also added to it four swords, the original four swords.

649
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:26,993
Speaker 1: And the way that would work is you get four GBAs and you would connect them with the GBA link cables.

650
00:37:27,054 --> 00:37:27,275
Speaker 1: Right.

651
00:37:27,295 --> 00:37:30,670
Speaker 1: So you needed three GBA link cables, four GBAs.

652
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:37,732
Speaker 1: And I don't know, I think I forget if you needed one or four cartridges, but and you hooked it up.

653
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:51,567
Speaker 1: And then if you had that all set up, you could play four swords, which is a you know, the thing is that original four swords right for that GBA did not have that shared screen.

654
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:51,770
Speaker 1: Right.

655
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,170
Speaker 1: Everyone only had their one GBA screen.

656
00:37:54,751 --> 00:38:03,851
Speaker 1: So what you did is you just sort of were playing Zelda and there were three other people on the screen with you, you know, a red link, a green link, a magenta link and a blue link.

657
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:10,769
Speaker 0: And, you know, it was a pretty good game, but it wasn't quite there yet because the shared space really adds a lot.

658
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:11,803
Speaker 1: Yeah.

659
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:11,904
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:18,173
Speaker 0: It's also the problem that we have an old beautiful picture of us trying to use the GBA link cables.

661
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:21,530
Speaker 0: They were not long enough, nor were they fast enough.

662
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:32,809
Speaker 1: I mean, we played Mario Kart Super Circuit with them a few times and Advance Wars with them and you sort of everyone had to huddle together and the connection would inevitably be lost in a long game of Advance Wars and you go, fuck.

663
00:38:33,473 --> 00:38:34,449
Speaker 1: And that was that.

664
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:34,931
Speaker 0: Yep.

665
00:38:35,152 --> 00:38:41,950
Speaker 0: Also, I should point out, just, you know, while we're talking, the Dreamcast was close to this because it had that little screen on the controller.

666
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,350
Speaker 1: Well, no, it wasn't on the controller.

667
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,550
Speaker 1: It was on the memory card.

668
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,317
Speaker 0: Well, that's even better.

669
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:46,709
Speaker 0: But you could put little stuff there.

670
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:55,510
Speaker 1: Well, the interesting thing about the Dreamcast VMU, right, is like, you know, let's say there was a. there was never a Pokemon for the Dreamcast, but I guess there was Monster Rancher, if I'm not mistaken.

671
00:38:56,191 --> 00:38:58,770
Speaker 1: And, you know, you would play it on the big screen.

672
00:38:59,251 --> 00:38:59,492
Speaker 1: Right.

673
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:02,610
Speaker 1: And while you were playing, there might be stuff on your little screen.

674
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:03,454
Speaker 1: Right.

675
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:04,890
Speaker 1: Which was also your memory card.

676
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:09,533
Speaker 1: And then you would take that memory card out and the memory card actually had a D-pad and two buttons on it.

677
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,952
Speaker 1: And it would only had a crappy little shitty Tiger LCD type of display.

678
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:23,351
Speaker 1: But you could like, you know, train your little monsters on there and play your little tiny games on there, just carry your memory card around with you, which is sort of neat.

679
00:39:25,238 --> 00:39:28,370
Speaker 0: But with four swords specifically, it's a game.

680
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:35,637
Speaker 0: It's just your four links and you play through a Super Nintendo Zelda game and you're all kind of on the same screen.

681
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,290
Speaker 0: But then you can kind of break apart and go to different dungeons, different holes and houses.

682
00:39:39,391 --> 00:39:41,230
Speaker 0: And you just have to solve puzzles.

683
00:39:41,452 --> 00:39:44,010
Speaker 0: And it's it's one of those brilliant games.

684
00:39:44,473 --> 00:39:46,510
Speaker 0: I love games where you have a co-op goal.

685
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,810
Speaker 0: You're all trying to do the same thing, but you also have this slightly competitive goal.

686
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:54,129
Speaker 0: that doesn't really matter, but it ends up really mattering.

687
00:39:55,012 --> 00:39:55,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just sort of like.

688
00:39:56,077 --> 00:39:59,984
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter for winning the game, but it just matters, you know, for fun.

689
00:40:00,247 --> 00:40:00,450
Speaker 1: Right.

690
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,516
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, think about this.

691
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:01,737
Speaker 1: Right.

692
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:05,046
Speaker 1: Let's say let's say the game didn't have the competitive aspect.

693
00:40:05,106 --> 00:40:05,330
Speaker 1: Right.

694
00:40:05,852 --> 00:40:12,830
Speaker 1: So the game would be sort of this march to the end of solving all the puzzles and everyone just rush forward, solving all the puzzles and then the game be over.

695
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,250
Speaker 1: And that that would actually be a pretty damn good game.

696
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:15,834
Speaker 1: Right.

697
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:17,630
Speaker 1: But this competitive aspect.

698
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,032
Speaker 1: Right.

699
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:18,354
Speaker 1: OK.

700
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:21,710
Speaker 1: So let's say you beat a boss instead of just going, yeah, we beat the boss.

701
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,423
Speaker 1: High fives.

702
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:22,690
Speaker 1: Right.

703
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,389
Speaker 1: All these gems fall from the sky.

704
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:29,265
Speaker 1: So everyone starts running around trying to pick up more than everyone else.

705
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:31,910
Speaker 0: or the classic moment that happened.

706
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,750
Speaker 0: We were playing, you know, the other night and we just beat the stage.

707
00:40:34,951 --> 00:40:37,650
Speaker 0: And I had like a thousand more force gems than everyone.

708
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:42,658
Speaker 0: And I also had the bombs and I also had half of a heart left because I was throwing bombs at the boss.

709
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:43,669
Speaker 0: I messed up a couple of times.

710
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,130
Speaker 0: We're going to stand on the end and I, you know, we're done.

711
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:58,228
Speaker 0: I stand on the little teleporter thing and just before someone else stands there, I accidentally hit A and didn't notice there's a bomb behind me and it blew up and I died and all my force gems fell out.

712
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,229
Speaker 0: And Emily, Scott and Alex go, fuck, and they grab them all.

713
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,112
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,250
Speaker 0: And that wouldn't happen if you weren't competing over these force gems.

715
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,245
Speaker 0: And even though you don't get anything out of it, really, it did.

716
00:41:11,466 --> 00:41:19,170
Speaker 0: that little bit of competitiveness causes like it causes the game to be great where you're always trying to rush ahead and solve the puzzle before everyone else.

717
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:19,914
Speaker 0: And that ended it up.

718
00:41:20,297 --> 00:41:22,110
Speaker 0: But then you all run in four different directions.

719
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:27,790
Speaker 0: But then someone gets to a spot where they need another person to help them and you've got to go and throw him over.

720
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,949
Speaker 0: But you see that gem there and you don't want to do it.

721
00:41:30,391 --> 00:41:33,344
Speaker 0: But then the game screws him and you get the gem and all that sort of.

722
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:39,530
Speaker 0: there's so much just like exploratory fun in four swords that it's a fantastic game as a result.

723
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:49,110
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, I think about like, you know, the game doesn't have, you know, finding items, right, because the items just sort of sitting on these little pedestals.

724
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:49,312
Speaker 1: Right.

725
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:50,790
Speaker 1: So you can always get them when you need them.

726
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,212
Speaker 1: Right.

727
00:41:52,518 --> 00:41:55,090
Speaker 1: And it doesn't have shops to buy anything with rupees.

728
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:55,892
Speaker 1: Right.

729
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:57,882
Speaker 1: So really the only kind of item.

730
00:41:57,902 --> 00:42:01,950
Speaker 1: they and, you know, and all the all the weapons have unlimited ammos, never run out of arrows or anything.

731
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,130
Speaker 1: So what could they really give you when you stab enemies?

732
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,409
Speaker 1: What are you supposed to drop hearts?

733
00:42:06,871 --> 00:42:09,950
Speaker 1: If they only drop hearts, you're going to be invincible, basically.

734
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,237
Speaker 1: And you are sort of invincible.

735
00:42:11,257 --> 00:42:13,410
Speaker 1: I mean, you can die, but it's hard to die.

736
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:15,109
Speaker 1: So what could they really give you?

737
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:21,194
Speaker 1: So they give you these force gems and, you know, you start, you know, and but what do you.

738
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,450
Speaker 1: OK, so they give you force gems.

739
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:24,024
Speaker 1: What do you want them for?

740
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:24,530
Speaker 1: What do you care?

741
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,190
Speaker 1: You can't buy anything with them, right?

742
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:37,375
Speaker 1: What you get with them is you get the satisfaction of, yeah, it took all of us together to beat this level, but really, I'm better than all of you at this and I'm carrying it all the way.

743
00:42:37,435 --> 00:42:41,053
Speaker 1: And it's sort of, you know, it gives you that extra good feeling of like.

744
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:47,510
Speaker 1: not only did we solve this puzzle together, but I'm actually, you know, the real go to guy here.

745
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:52,430
Speaker 0: You guys are just sort of hangers on having the shared space and the non shared space.

746
00:42:52,771 --> 00:43:00,812
Speaker 0: Like two good examples of why that's so great is one, oftentimes like you'll be all on the screen together and you can see everyone there and someone finds a little hidey hole.

747
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:07,290
Speaker 0: So you run in and now you're on your GBA by yourself and you're like running ahead to get all the treasures before other people get them.

748
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,469
Speaker 0: And there's this mad rush and it's usually really fun.

749
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:10,152
Speaker 1: Yeah.

750
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:18,390
Speaker 1: It's like if you go into, say, a house or a cave or something like that, you know, people can only see you when you're on the big screen in the overworld.

751
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:21,830
Speaker 1: If you go into something, you're on your own little GBA screen.

752
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,733
Speaker 1: People can't see you unless they're in the same place, you know, like if they also go in the house.

753
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:29,030
Speaker 1: So you go in the house and you start getting treasures.

754
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:31,970
Speaker 1: No one's seeing you getting these treasures like.

755
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,445
Speaker 0: But number two, the shared space and the private space.

756
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:43,973
Speaker 0: at the end of every round, you have that vote where you secretly get to vote someone up and someone down in the final tally.

757
00:43:44,437 --> 00:43:46,230
Speaker 1: And you like rim was really helpful.

758
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:50,712
Speaker 1: And you can't vote for yourself and be like, Alex, he was really a pain in the ass this level.

759
00:43:50,733 --> 00:43:50,874
Speaker 1: Yeah.

760
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,149
Speaker 0: He set me on fire like four times that jerk.

761
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:53,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

762
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:54,778
Speaker 1: That's something else.

763
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:55,523
Speaker 1: is that you have all these.

764
00:43:55,623 --> 00:43:56,630
Speaker 1: you get these weapons, right?

765
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,695
Speaker 1: And the sword is the sword.

766
00:43:58,117 --> 00:44:01,273
Speaker 1: But the way that you can interact with the other links, right?

767
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:01,596
Speaker 1: You can.

768
00:44:01,717 --> 00:44:02,970
Speaker 1: you can stab them, I guess.

769
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:03,316
Speaker 1: Right.

770
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:04,029
Speaker 1: It doesn't do much.

771
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,610
Speaker 0: The only way you can damage anyone really is with Bob.

772
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,629
Speaker 1: Well, you can you could throw them into a hole.

773
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:10,132
Speaker 0: Yep.

774
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:16,910
Speaker 0: The fact that the game lets you pick people up and throw them around and call all you need to throw people around to throw them over holes.

775
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:17,295
Speaker 0: Yes.

776
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:18,409
Speaker 1: But to get stuff.

777
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,949
Speaker 0: But you are often, often tempted to pick someone up and throw them into a hole so you can get the force jammies.

778
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:24,533
Speaker 0: Yep.

779
00:44:24,855 --> 00:44:25,701
Speaker 1: You can also.

780
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:26,930
Speaker 1: there's the fire rod.

781
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,169
Speaker 1: You can set people on fire, which is a pain in the ass.

782
00:44:30,612 --> 00:44:32,470
Speaker 0: It doesn't do any damage, but it's hilarious.

783
00:44:33,372 --> 00:44:34,016
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

784
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:36,170
Speaker 1: And it's incredibly frustrating because once you're set out.

785
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,551
Speaker 1: Right.

786
00:44:36,692 --> 00:44:47,831
Speaker 1: So you think you always want the fire rod because then you you're the guy who's setting everyone else on fire and you're just getting up, even if you're trying to be good and you're not me, you're just going to start accidentally setting someone on fire one.

787
00:44:47,871 --> 00:44:51,250
Speaker 1: And then once they're on fire, if they touch you, you're on fire.

788
00:44:51,371 --> 00:44:54,910
Speaker 1: So the force, you know, the fire rod is not like some ha ha ha.

789
00:44:55,011 --> 00:44:56,490
Speaker 1: I can torture all the other players.

790
00:44:57,052 --> 00:45:00,190
Speaker 1: If you torture someone with it, they can torture you back by touching you.

791
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:01,150
Speaker 1: You have to run away.

792
00:45:01,352 --> 00:45:03,070
Speaker 0: And then at the end of the round, they're on fire.

793
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,008
Speaker 0: They run real fast.

794
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,189
Speaker 0: The question is usually, hey, who had the fire rod?

795
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:11,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like both someone down rim set everyone on fire.

796
00:45:11,331 --> 00:45:12,429
Speaker 1: Let's vote rim down.

797
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:16,290
Speaker 0: Of course, in terms of griefing, nothing beats the mega bomb.

798
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:27,348
Speaker 0: Yeah, that pretty much we 10 minutes would go by where someone gets the mega bomb and they're holding everyone hostage by just putting it in the middle of the screen and hiding and then putting it in the middle of the screen and hiding.

799
00:45:29,171 --> 00:45:34,131
Speaker 0: But there's the fact that you vote secretly and then you can't actually see who voted for whom.

800
00:45:34,513 --> 00:45:37,990
Speaker 0: But you can see what the votes were in the end.

801
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:41,250
Speaker 0: And it adds this subtle bit of rivalry and fun.

802
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,558
Speaker 1: And it's like you'll get.

803
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:44,370
Speaker 1: you'll see that you got voted down twice.

804
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,661
Speaker 1: You don't know who, but you know that you were.

805
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:48,934
Speaker 1: two of the three other players voted you down.

806
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,190
Speaker 1: You're like, fuck you guys.

807
00:45:50,332 --> 00:45:51,389
Speaker 1: I was doing a good job.

808
00:45:51,971 --> 00:45:54,902
Speaker 0: And the game has all these non like.

809
00:45:54,922 --> 00:46:09,068
Speaker 0: they're not directly tied to winning or losing, but they're all these meta elements and all these kind of tertiary, enjoyable elements that make the four swords experience a fantastic game experience that is unlike almost anything else out there.

810
00:46:09,832 --> 00:46:11,330
Speaker 0: There aren't other games like this.

811
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:12,970
Speaker 0: There aren't other experiences like this.

812
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:23,151
Speaker 0: If you can get three friends together and sit down with GBAs and play this game all the way through, there are few experiences that you will ever have in gaming even close to it.

813
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:29,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't even think of any other game that, like, has anything remotely similar to the kind of experience you get with four swords.

814
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,571
Speaker 1: Not one.

815
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:39,083
Speaker 0: I mean, Crystal Chronicles and like Pac-Man versus have similar types of shared experiences, but Crystal Chronicles is the closest.

816
00:46:39,143 --> 00:46:40,670
Speaker 1: Pac-Man first comes after that.

817
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,775
Speaker 0: But even then, they're still.

818
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:49,792
Speaker 0: they're so unique in their own ways and they showcase this kind of abandoned avenue, kind of like how people say that the point and click adventures kind of died.

819
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:55,610
Speaker 0: There were this as the genre of gaming that just kind of petered out and is dead and people are trying to bring it back.

820
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:01,189
Speaker 0: But it's tough and whole genres of gaming fall out of favor and disappear and people get so locked into.

821
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:02,508
Speaker 0: Is it an RPG?

822
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:07,170
Speaker 1: These are really, you know, four swords isn't really a different genre.

823
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:08,242
Speaker 1: It's an action RPG.

824
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,770
Speaker 1: It's not even really an action RPG because there's not much RPG.

825
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,230
Speaker 0: This is even more of a crime.

826
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,970
Speaker 1: It is a it's really a top down action puzzler.

827
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:30,470
Speaker 0: It is a gaming technology that failed and disappeared and was effectively stillborn because the controls, the setup, the Gameboy GBA controller connection to the GameCube was not really ready yet.

828
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:32,030
Speaker 0: It was almost a tech demo.

829
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,569
Speaker 0: It was basically Nintendo saying, look at this.

830
00:47:34,992 --> 00:47:36,110
Speaker 0: No one's ever done this before.

831
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,555
Speaker 0: Effectively, this is a new avenue of gaming and you can have unique gaming experiences with this.

832
00:47:43,302 --> 00:47:44,230
Speaker 0: And no one gave a shit.

833
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:45,450
Speaker 0: And Nintendo said, you know what?

834
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,094
Speaker 0: Never mind.

835
00:47:46,357 --> 00:47:47,950
Speaker 0: We're going to make games for old people now.

836
00:47:48,292 --> 00:47:48,574
Speaker 1: Yep.

837
00:47:48,837 --> 00:47:50,190
Speaker 1: And that's what they've done.

838
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,653
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, with the GameCube, people complain that releases were few and far between.

839
00:47:54,693 --> 00:47:56,970
Speaker 1: They didn't come out with new, awesome games often enough.

840
00:47:57,051 --> 00:47:58,289
Speaker 1: And that's sort of true.

841
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:07,830
Speaker 1: But every every year there would be three or four games that were like, oh, yeah, but I mean, Soul Calibur two, F zero, Crystal Chronicles.

842
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,059
Speaker 1: So what would happen with the GameCube?

843
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:14,130
Speaker 1: as we turn it on and play it like crazy for like a month or so, then we turn it off.

844
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,689
Speaker 1: But we played if someone came over for a party, but it would be off.

845
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,770
Speaker 1: Then another game would come out and you play it like crazy.

846
00:48:19,212 --> 00:48:21,250
Speaker 1: The Wii that was happening for a little while.

847
00:48:21,492 --> 00:48:21,695
Speaker 1: Right.

848
00:48:21,715 --> 00:48:22,587
Speaker 1: You know, we got it.

849
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:23,798
Speaker 1: We played it like crazy.

850
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:24,969
Speaker 1: Turned it off.

851
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:25,917
Speaker 1: We got nothing.

852
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,170
Speaker 1: We got like Smash Brothers.

853
00:48:27,231 --> 00:48:28,162
Speaker 1: We played it like crazy.

854
00:48:28,304 --> 00:48:28,750
Speaker 1: Turned it off.

855
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:29,051
Speaker 0: Right.

856
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:32,190
Speaker 0: Part of the problem is that with the Wii, the shared experience thing came back.

857
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:38,129
Speaker 0: I mean, playing Wii Sports and all these things with a group of people was a similar new, unique kind of game experience.

858
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:45,408
Speaker 0: The problem was after they made that experience, they didn't improve upon it and they didn't go anywhere with it.

859
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:46,072
Speaker 1: Yeah.

860
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:51,807
Speaker 1: I mean, even look at the Wii games that are coming out now are not really doing any of that stuff at all.

861
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,130
Speaker 1: And I mean, the last Wii game I bought that was at all exciting was like the Wario game.

862
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:01,110
Speaker 1: Which was a 2D side scroller with a little bit of shaky controller business.

863
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:01,892
Speaker 1: And that was it.

864
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:12,392
Speaker 0: But people basically they abandon the shared experience and went back to make a single player or two player game or a really weak four or a painfully weak eight player game.

865
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:17,250
Speaker 0: Add a little bit of waggle, but make it mostly a normal controller, two dimensional style game.

866
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:19,750
Speaker 0: I mean, look at the biggest games like Smash Brothers.

867
00:49:20,314 --> 00:49:21,910
Speaker 0: It's just a GameCube game made better.

868
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:23,709
Speaker 0: It's not anything innovative or special.

869
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,816
Speaker 1: Twilight Princess.

870
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:26,330
Speaker 1: People sort of forget this.

871
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:28,030
Speaker 1: It had a release on the GameCube.

872
00:49:28,873 --> 00:49:31,269
Speaker 1: It came out for GameCube and for Wii.

873
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:35,550
Speaker 0: It was not because they didn't do anything with the Wii controller.

874
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:41,452
Speaker 0: The Wii controller is is more and more the waggle is becoming just like the GBA controller.

875
00:49:41,512 --> 00:49:45,147
Speaker 1: It was still like at first, at first, you know, it was.

876
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:48,730
Speaker 1: we thought it was going to be the revolution, you know, and it was called the revolution.

877
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:51,350
Speaker 1: And on paper, it was like, oh, yeah, this is the business.

878
00:49:51,511 --> 00:50:04,410
Speaker 1: And playing bowling, the bowling is actually still pretty great until you get bored of it, you know, but really it did that, you know, I mean, the DS, the touch screen, people said the same thing, you know, that's gimmicky.

879
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,730
Speaker 1: But while it wasn't, the DS is still the business.

880
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:12,430
Speaker 1: But with the Wii, you know, I guess parts of the Wii, you know, are not gimmicky.

881
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:20,109
Speaker 0: But I guess the trouble is the Wii is from a business perspective, possibly the most successful console ever.

882
00:50:20,452 --> 00:50:24,110
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously, excluding the days when Nintendo had a monopoly on gaming.

883
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:27,630
Speaker 1: Who knows if the NES that we made more money, it's a tough call.

884
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:30,590
Speaker 0: But the Wii is people say this all the time.

885
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:31,910
Speaker 0: It's a license to print money.

886
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,030
Speaker 0: Nintendo's Blue, Blue Ocean strategy was brilliant.

887
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:38,890
Speaker 0: Like, I cannot think of a better business direction for Nintendo to have gone.

888
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:40,215
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, that's why.

889
00:50:40,295 --> 00:50:44,614
Speaker 1: that's why those recent articles said Miyamoto was sad during the GameCube era.

890
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,302
Speaker 1: They made this great thing in.

891
00:50:46,362 --> 00:50:48,617
Speaker 1: Four Swords was like the greatest game experience.

892
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,850
Speaker 1: that made no money.

893
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,613
Speaker 0: It was new.

894
00:50:50,733 --> 00:50:54,070
Speaker 0: It was equivalently new to when someone said, what if I made it?

895
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:58,529
Speaker 0: I made a game from the first person perspective where you shot things.

896
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:00,221
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it was it was.

897
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:01,310
Speaker 0: it was on that order.

898
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,430
Speaker 0: It was a new kind of gaming.

899
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,410
Speaker 0: It was a fundamental shift, something that couldn't have been done before.

900
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,849
Speaker 0: And no one cared.

901
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:09,892
Speaker 1: Yeah.

902
00:51:10,636 --> 00:51:14,332
Speaker 1: I mean, there's other things about Four Swords, too, like that make it really cool.

903
00:51:14,392 --> 00:51:18,690
Speaker 0: Like, well, there's Tingle's Tower and the bucking Broncos.

904
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:19,596
Speaker 1: Right.

905
00:51:19,637 --> 00:51:20,690
Speaker 1: Well, we'll ignore that for now.

906
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:27,190
Speaker 0: But I mean, sexual towers, they've only it is it is great and how horrifying it is.

907
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:29,402
Speaker 1: I mean, there are just some things in that game like there'll be.

908
00:51:29,422 --> 00:51:37,710
Speaker 1: there'll be scenes where you walk onto a mat onto the next screen and like a million bad guys will come at you like a whole bunch, like a hundred soldiers.

909
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:38,990
Speaker 1: And it's like, oh, it's pretty cool.

910
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,510
Speaker 0: The thing is, the game, what it did is it has these concepts.

911
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:45,403
Speaker 0: It's a pretty simple game, but it keeps it fresh by surprising you.

912
00:51:45,443 --> 00:51:55,412
Speaker 0: that Four Swords surprised me many times during the course of playing it in ways that very few games have since then.

913
00:51:55,814 --> 00:52:01,450
Speaker 0: Like, and they'll do subtle little things like you'll be playing, you'll be going around doing stuff and you find a room with a puzzle.

914
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,169
Speaker 0: But there was another room somewhere else with the puzzle you didn't do.

915
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:14,549
Speaker 0: And if you do this, this easy puzzle first without doing the other one, you solve it and a million million force gems fall from the sky into a pit in the middle of the room.

916
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:27,350
Speaker 0: And you just stand there and watch this and they don't overuse that, but they use their little moments like that, moments where you go, oh, they really they really took.

917
00:52:29,298 --> 00:52:30,527
Speaker 1: I mean, and it's just 2D Zelda.

918
00:52:30,991 --> 00:52:31,111
Speaker 1: Right.

919
00:52:31,131 --> 00:52:37,310
Speaker 1: And you think, what could they possibly do with 2D Zelda that they didn't already do in the Game Boy games or the SNES game?

920
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:37,612
Speaker 1: Right.

921
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:41,150
Speaker 1: Well, look at like the search, the searchlight part of the game.

922
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:45,772
Speaker 0: Oh, my God, that is brilliant and and one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced.

923
00:52:45,852 --> 00:52:53,830
Speaker 1: or the mystery forest or, you know, every level in the game is not just walk around with pushing block puzzles and stabbing bad guys.

924
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,727
Speaker 1: Every level has this really unique and interesting shit going on.

925
00:52:58,767 --> 00:53:01,530
Speaker 1: that is just not happening, even in any other Zelda game.

926
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:07,609
Speaker 0: And in every puzzle all the time and more and more, they always give you the ability to fuck with the other players.

927
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:15,289
Speaker 0: Case in point, there's a couple of places where everyone else is going inside some cave to do stuff, but it's dark in there.

928
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:17,090
Speaker 0: But there's a skylight.

929
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:21,409
Speaker 0: So one person stands outside on the switch to keep the skylight open so people can see.

930
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:27,569
Speaker 0: But nothing is more satisfying than stepping off of that switch and having your three friends go, what the fuck?

931
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:31,042
Speaker 1: Seriously, you know, that's good times.

932
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:37,450
Speaker 0: So I guess the moral here, we've talked about four swords off and on.

933
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:47,189
Speaker 0: If you have not played four swords all the way through with three other people, I mean, you can or the way you can play the game on your own.

934
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,076
Speaker 1: Don't that's that's.

935
00:53:49,357 --> 00:53:53,243
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's kind of fun because it's still a really good 2D Zelda game.

936
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,330
Speaker 0: But the thing is, you're defeating the purpose.

937
00:53:55,657 --> 00:53:56,330
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

938
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:05,606
Speaker 1: If you do that, unlike Crystal Chronicles, which is if you really if you really don't have enough friends and enough GBAs, then do that anyway, just because, you know, it's worth it.

939
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:14,429
Speaker 1: But if you can, in any circumstance, get it on with the four GBAs and the four cables, then you really have to.

940
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:19,502
Speaker 0: Well, because if you don't play it with, you know, the full four people and the full, you know, the way the game was, you could do three people.

941
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:20,509
Speaker 1: also, you know, it's yeah.

942
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,312
Speaker 0: But what?

943
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:28,790
Speaker 0: what you're missing, if you play it by yourself, is all the things that make this a unique gaming experience as opposed to just a good gaming experience.

944
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:30,630
Speaker 0: I mean, there's good and there's unique.

945
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:32,250
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's uniquely good.

946
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,729
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's uniquely bad.

947
00:54:33,982 --> 00:54:34,088
Speaker 1: Yeah.

948
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:40,769
Speaker 1: Also, also, if you play it alone, the game is actually a little bit frustrating and that you have to keep switching between the different links.

949
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:49,430
Speaker 1: So it's like you're playing this frustrating game as opposed to a sort of a fun, happy game, you know, but play four swords and play Crystal Chronicles.

950
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:52,310
Speaker 0: But only if you can play them the way they were meant to be played.

951
00:54:52,631 --> 00:54:54,008
Speaker 0: Be what you were meant to be.

952
00:54:54,297 --> 00:54:54,490
Speaker 1: Yeah.

953
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:59,729
Speaker 1: And, you know, one of the original complaints was that, you know, hey, it's expensive to get all this stuff.

954
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:00,469
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

955
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:02,209
Speaker 1: How many years later is it now?

956
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,943
Speaker 1: Like three, four years later, you've got like you can get.

957
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:11,770
Speaker 1: you can get GBAs and cables in the game and you get game cubes or, you know, you could play it on your Wii.

958
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:12,150
Speaker 1: Right.

959
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:15,970
Speaker 1: You can get all this stuff really cheap now, really cheap.

960
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:22,889
Speaker 1: So, you know, I mean, compare this to something like like getting a whole bunch of plastic instruments.

961
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:23,366
Speaker 1: Right.

962
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,550
Speaker 1: No one complained about the expensive plastic instruments.

963
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:30,070
Speaker 1: No one complained about the expensive price of that steel battalion for the Xbox.

964
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:30,279
Speaker 1: Right.

965
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,809
Speaker 1: So this is cheaper than that.

966
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:33,905
Speaker 1: So you should do it.

967
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,390
