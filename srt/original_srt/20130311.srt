1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,615
Speaker 1: It's Monday, March 11th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,898
Speaker 1: I'm Rin.

3
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,221
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:16,810
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, everyday technology.

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,208
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,531 --> 00:00:27,161
Speaker 1: So, over the weekend, I come home from a thing like a do.

7
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,630
Speaker 1: Actually, I went to see Wolf Children, Morosna's new movie.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,371
Speaker 0: Wolf Children?

9
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:32,716
Speaker 0: It is... Did they bite you?

10
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,345
Speaker 1: No, it is the best.

11
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,750
Speaker 1: It is so good.

12
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:42,009
Speaker 1: But, and also, the main reason it was great, not the main reason, but eight reasons.

13
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:42,310
Speaker 0: it was great.

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,178
Speaker 0: Didn't you save this for Wednesday?

15
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:44,349
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm just saying he was there.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,577
Speaker 0: We do have a Wednesday show this week.

17
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:46,665
Speaker 1: I know, I'm just saying he was there.

18
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:47,410
Speaker 0: We've seen him before.

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,399
Speaker 1: And the kids, you know, ask questions or whatever.

20
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:50,961
Speaker 0: Just like last time.

21
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:53,250
Speaker 1: And the first kid question was the best question ever.

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,638
Speaker 1: He was like, "Why did you make the movie so

23
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:56,581
Speaker 1: depressing?".

24
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:59,170
Speaker 1: And his answer was great.

25
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,069
Speaker 1: He was basically, "Well, you know, it's not really depressing if you're older when you watch it.

26
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:07,788
Speaker 1: So watch it again when you're older, and you'll see what your parents went through raising

27
00:01:07,828 --> 00:01:07,929
Speaker 1: you.".

28
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:16,150
Speaker 1: But, so I come home from all that, and there's an official notice on the door to the entrance of my building.

29
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,776
Speaker 0: I saw this notice when I came in.

30
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:21,710
Speaker 1: Because it's still there, and there's some law about how many weeks they have to leave it publicly noticed.

31
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:24,059
Speaker 1: It's duct taped to the window.

32
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,269
Speaker 1: And when I came home, I start reading it.

33
00:01:26,891 --> 00:01:35,909
Speaker 1: And my first thought, because if you read it, until you get to the point where it only affects the stellar, it's basically the notice of everyone in this building's got to get the fuck out.

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,960
Speaker 1: So I'm reading it going, "Ah, fuck me.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,804
Speaker 1: There goes my week.

36
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:40,266
Speaker 1: Oh,

37
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:40,627
Speaker 1: cellar.".

38
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,241
Speaker 1: So, basically, I read this thing.

39
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:46,710
Speaker 1: I took a picture of it, you know, just because.

40
00:01:47,351 --> 00:01:51,310
Speaker 1: And then I walked inside, and I went down to the cellar, and I looked at the thing it was referring to.

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,500
Speaker 1: And sure enough, there's two things down there.

42
00:01:55,342 --> 00:02:00,609
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of, and I hate to sound stereotypical, but there's a bunch of Mexican people moving out in a hurry.

43
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:12,058
Speaker 1: So my building basically had two illegal apartments in the cellar that were really big, relatively nice apartments, very similarly set up to my apartment.

44
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:13,924
Speaker 1: But they were in the cellar.

45
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:16,170
Speaker 1: And they were totally illegal.

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,517
Speaker 0: Now, it's not clear if- Now, usually when a building is built, and this building is kind of new- This building's brand new.

47
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,150
Speaker 1: We're the first people to live in our apartment.

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,810
Speaker 0: The inspectors come and make sure the building is legit.

49
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:31,990
Speaker 0: So was those apartments not there when the inspectors came and the building was built?

50
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,450
Speaker 1: So when I moved, we moved in almost exactly a year after the building was built.

51
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,870
Speaker 1: It hadn't been fully occupied ever at that point.

52
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:44,737
Speaker 1: So I remember the first day when we moved in, I walked down to the cellar, just because, you know, you do.

53
00:02:44,778 --> 00:02:46,570
Speaker 1: You poke around the building and see what's what.

54
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,441
Speaker 1: And down there, there's a crazy boiler room.

55
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,089
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of machine rooms.

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,318
Speaker 1: There's a trash room and all this crazy stuff.

57
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,030
Speaker 1: And actually, there's a lot of big stuff because it's a big building.

58
00:02:56,911 --> 00:03:01,930
Speaker 1: And there's, like, the emergency egress hatches in case you need to get out from the exploding boiler or whatever.

59
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,877
Speaker 1: And there's a door.

60
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,070
Speaker 1: There's a white door that's always open.

61
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:09,370
Speaker 1: Behind that, it was just a little, like, sort of antechamber.

62
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,527
Speaker 1: And then beyond that, there were two apartments, just 0A and 0B.

63
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,474
Speaker 1: Like, apartment 0 and 0.

64
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:20,050
Speaker 1: And I never really thought much of it.

65
00:03:20,211 --> 00:03:27,929
Speaker 0: And then from the back of the building- Wait, 0A and 0B, wouldn't they be- I mean, there's an A. A is the second floor.

66
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:28,656
Speaker 0: What?

67
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:28,720
Speaker 0: No.

68
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,761
Speaker 1: The A, B, C is just on each floor.

69
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,590
Speaker 1: There's an A, B, C, D, E, F, G, whatever.

70
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:35,665
Speaker 0: Oh, it's like that.

71
00:03:35,685 --> 00:03:35,726
Speaker 0: OK.

72
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:36,876
Speaker 1: That's how my building is.

73
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:39,010
Speaker 1: What do you think the A is on our apartment?

74
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,749
Speaker 0: I thought that the next one was, you know, A, whatever.

75
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,590
Speaker 1: So you thought I live on the eighth floor of the building?

76
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:50,162
Speaker 1: Anyway.

77
00:03:51,232 --> 00:04:02,450
Speaker 1: So yeah, either the building company just fucking put these illegal apartments straight up in the blueprint of the building, or- And how did they get away with that, putting them in the blueprints?

78
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:19,690
Speaker 1: Or the blueprint of the building just had this area with two apartment-sized rooms that were designated to not be apartments, and then someone decided to turn them into apartments that look just like apartments in all the other parts of the building.

79
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:26,170
Speaker 1: So I'm not sure how deeply I'll follow it, but I'm going to try to figure out what actually happened.

80
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,070
Speaker 1: But when I walked down there, there were straight up a bunch of Mexican people moving out in a hurry.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,996
Speaker 0: Are you sure they were Mexican?

82
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,870
Speaker 0: They could have been some other variety of people.

83
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,613
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident.

84
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:47,109
Speaker 1: they were Mexican because I work actually heavily in Latin America, and I can actually kind of tell the difference between, like, Colombians and Puerto Ricans and Mexicans and Argentinians, just because I do a lot of business with them.

85
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:49,150
Speaker 1: I can tell by the accent particularly.

86
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:59,467
Speaker 1: But yeah, they were Mexicans, and they were moving out in a hurry, and I don't know what's going on, but I went down there, and there's crazy eviction notices on the doors.

87
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:01,928
Speaker 1: that's basically like, "If you come in here, you'll be fucking

88
00:05:01,948 --> 00:05:02,150
Speaker 1: arrested.".

89
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:06,129
Speaker 1: I guess the building inspector showed up.

90
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:08,115
Speaker 1: I feel bad for those people.

91
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:12,670
Speaker 1: I don't know if they were in on it, or if they got scammed by whoever put those apartments there.

92
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:23,770
Speaker 1: But what's funny is it was like, one of the reasons they can't live down there is poor ventilation, poor lighting, illegally installed gas line, which I'm not super happy about.

93
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:29,850
Speaker 1: And you know, it's funny, when I tried to buy that house in Beacon, it had an illegally installed gas line.

94
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,770
Speaker 0: What is up with these illegally installed gas lines?

95
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,170
Speaker 1: And it had an illegally installed kitchen, and an illegally installed fifth and sixth bedroom.

96
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:40,189
Speaker 0: What the fuck is up with this shit?

97
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,470
Speaker 1: That's just how it goes.

98
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:56,150
Speaker 0: If I ever get a building, if I ever had to build a building of any kind, I'm going to make the person doing the building in a contract accept all liability that the thing is 100% legal, and if it's not, they're going to pay to make it legal.

99
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what's going to happen?

100
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:00,229
Speaker 1: You're basically not going to find anyone who will do the contract work for you.

101
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,509
Speaker 0: I'm going to have to pay to find someone who will make sure that everything they do is legal.

102
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,789
Speaker 1: They'll have some sort of bonded insurance, and they'll take care of it.

103
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, so now I'm watching this crazy thing unfold, and it seems to have mostly unfolded.

104
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,290
Speaker 0: I'm also going to call the inspector, whoever it is, to be like, "Hey, I'm having some shit done.

105
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,068
Speaker 0: I want to make sure it's legal before it's fucking

106
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:18,189
Speaker 0: done.".

107
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,749
Speaker 1: So when I got the inspection of that house I was going to build, right?

108
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:30,530
Speaker 1: The guy's walking around, and he looks at the kitchen, and he's like, "Yeah, this is totally, I'm going to bet you money that there is no permit for all the work that was done here.

109
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,764
Speaker 1: This isn't a multi-family

110
00:06:31,845 --> 00:06:32,210
Speaker 1: dwelling.".

111
00:06:32,613 --> 00:06:34,449
Speaker 1: And he was very honest about it, but he was like, "Tell you what.

112
00:06:35,832 --> 00:06:51,890
Speaker 1: If and when you buy this house, if you want to keep it, let me know, and I'll draw up blueprints for the planned work you expect to do, and then you can get them approved, and then you can have them come and inspect the completed work after a reasonable interval.

113
00:06:52,471 --> 00:07:02,407
Speaker 1: Or you can have me draw up the blueprints of what you want it to look like after it's fixed, and we can arrange that the inspections happen after it is actually

114
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:02,749
Speaker 1: fixed.".

115
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,590
Speaker 1: And he was pretty open about how much it would cost to do those two things.

116
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,889
Speaker 0: That's just fun.

117
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,235
Speaker 1: That building had a much more egregious thing.

118
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:14,670
Speaker 1: It had a sliding glass door on the second floor to nowhere.

119
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,970
Speaker 0: As in you slide it open, walk out and die?

120
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,385
Speaker 0: Yes.

121
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:18,930
Speaker 0: Or at least break your leg?

122
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,430
Speaker 1: And it was a story and a half up, because it was a bi-level, and it was kind of situated on a hill, and basically there was a deck that either never got built or had to be torn down.

123
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,709
Speaker 0: So there should have been a deck outside of that door, but instead it was just nothing?

124
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:39,510
Speaker 1: And it was like 20 feet up, and there was a corrugated steel shanty town shed next to the house.

125
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:41,550
Speaker 0: Directly underneath the sliding door?

126
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,370
Speaker 1: No, that was actually off to the side.

127
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,430
Speaker 0: Why don't you just put the pool underneath that sliding door, and then you're all set?

128
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:58,670
Speaker 1: So yeah, the rules around having pools installed in suburbia means that you never want a pool installed, because if a random kid breaks into your property and drowns in the pool, you're at fault.

129
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:07,210
Speaker 0: That's why I will have a system by which anyone walking onto the property gets shot, because then that will make me less liable.

130
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott, New York State law has a specific rule against so-called

131
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,050
Speaker 0: "mantraps."

132
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the whole country has a law against mantraps, but then is the pool not a mantrap?

133
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,130
Speaker 1: Is everything not a mantrap?

134
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,890
Speaker 0: I mean, it's basically a water filled- It's not life, but a mantrap.

135
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,950
Speaker 0: It's basically a water filled, piranha filled pit trap, right?

136
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,348
Speaker 0: In a way.

137
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:29,970
Speaker 1: In a way, aren't we all mantraps?

138
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,903
Speaker 0: And if I drain it for the winter, isn't it just a pit?

139
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,530
Speaker 0: A pit is a trap.

140
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,145
Speaker 1: I mean, it's the most basic trap.

141
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:43,669
Speaker 1: A pit is only a trap if you're trying to catch tigers or adventurers in a 10 foot by 10 foot configuration.

142
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,018
Speaker 0: Come on, and then what do you do in the winter to that pit?

143
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,770
Speaker 0: You put a concealing tarp over the top of it.

144
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,290
Speaker 0: How is that not a trap?

145
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,210
Speaker 1: When I was a kid on the beach one time, here's some technology.

146
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:58,890
Speaker 1: I made a possibly lethal mantrap with a bunch of neighborhood kids in Lexington.

147
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,795
Speaker 0: I have done this in a playground once.

148
00:09:00,855 --> 00:09:05,050
Speaker 0: I took a bunch of sticks that I found and I dig a hole and I put the sticks face up in the hole.

149
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,210
Speaker 1: Whoa, that's way worse than what I did.

150
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,779
Speaker 0: And then I stepped in it and went, "Ow,".

151
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,570
Speaker 0: and then I got rid of it because I hurt myself in my own trap.

152
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,177
Speaker 1: Okay, mine was better and worse.

153
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,110
Speaker 1: We basically took some sticks, we dug a deep hole.

154
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,110
Speaker 0: It's not like I sharpened the sticks, they were just sticks.

155
00:09:19,451 --> 00:09:28,490
Speaker 1: We dug a deep hole, like really deep, and then we covered it with sticks, we covered those sticks with fronds, we covered those fronds with leaves, we covered those leaves with sand.

156
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,601
Speaker 1: Then we went home and we told our parents, and my dad was like, "That is awesome.

157
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,808
Speaker 1: Now you're going to go dig it up before someone

158
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:37,269
Speaker 1: dies.".

159
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:38,889
Speaker 0: How deep was this pit?

160
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,210
Speaker 1: Like five feet.

161
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,730
Speaker 0: That's not, no one's going to die in that.

162
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,150
Speaker 1: If you suddenly fell into a five foot pit, you might severely hurt yourself, and if the tide then came in...

163
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,329
Speaker 0: You wouldn't die if you left out the essential pointy sticks face up.

164
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,288
Speaker 1: So I learned you don't actually face them up, you face them at an angle inward, anyway.

165
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,910
Speaker 0: That's porcupine style.

166
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,389
Speaker 1: That's not porcupine style, there's a specific name for that.

167
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,849
Speaker 1: Now if you poop on it, it's I think a punchy stick?

168
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,190
Speaker 0: I'm going to look that up.

169
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:06,810
Speaker 0: That's going to give someone an infection.

170
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,010
Speaker 1: I learned about that in middle school, anyway.

171
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,068
Speaker 0: I think it's called a poop-dibber.

172
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:12,815
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got any news.

173
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:15,610
Speaker 1: when I look up if this is a thing or if I just made it up from my childhood?

174
00:10:15,671 --> 00:10:17,430
Speaker 0: I actually don't have news.

175
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:18,268
Speaker 1: No news?

176
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,890
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, it is punchy stick.

177
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,290
Speaker 1: So that fuck-filled, oh my god, there's, okay, anyway.

178
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,189
Speaker 1: Don't Google image search that.

179
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,509
Speaker 1: Yeah, poop on a stick, people step on it, they get sepsis.

180
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:33,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what'll happen, sure.

181
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:41,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I learned that in middle school, we had to pick a novel from this box of novels that our teacher had in like sixth grade.

182
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:51,430
Speaker 1: So I fish around, I find this fuck-violent, crazy Vietnam trash novel that I don't know if it was there by design or by accident.

183
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,750
Speaker 1: But good god, it was that 500 pages of the word fuck, and that's where I learned about punchy sticks.

184
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:06,810
Speaker 0: Okay, so I don't have a tech news, but I do have something that our listeners say they enjoy, at least some of them say they enjoy, which is esoteric, really advanced technology bullshit.

185
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:24,729
Speaker 0: So at work, right, got this problem, there's a thing called PyPy, it's the place where you get your packages from the cheese shop, because, you know, Python the language, Monty Python, the cheese shop, where you get your packages, right?

186
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:32,010
Speaker 0: So the first one of these, at least that I know of, right, was called CPAN, which is still around, it's for Perl.

187
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,889
Speaker 0: So if you program in Perl and you need to get a helping library, maybe you want to work with SSL.

188
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:53,650
Speaker 0: So what you would do is you would do like CPAN something something and the name of the SSL library, and then your computer will go out to CPAN, find the SSL library, and then install it so that now when you load Perl, you can now use that library.

189
00:11:54,411 --> 00:12:08,210
Speaker 0: So for Python, this package, you know, repository is called PyPy, and it's notoriously sort of slow and unreliable compared to, say, CPAN and the others, which are much better in those regards, right?

190
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:17,033
Speaker 0: So there's a few mirrors, but not many, there's an art, there was a mirror at RIT, apparently hasn't been updated in a very long time, it's way out of date, right?

191
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:25,510
Speaker 0: So we had a problem at work where trying to access this, you know, PyPy was like timing out, it wasn't working.

192
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:29,650
Speaker 0: So I tried to install something from Amazon and it was working just fine.

193
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:36,230
Speaker 0: So the connection between work and PyPy was not good, but the connection between Amazon and PyPy was just fine.

194
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,234
Speaker 0: So I'm like, what can I do about this?

195
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:44,810
Speaker 0: Aha, I will create my own private mirror of PyPy, right, on Amazon.

196
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:45,875
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost that much.

197
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,060
Speaker 0: It costs like 50 cents a month.

198
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,430
Speaker 0: It'll just take a long time to download the whole thing, right?

199
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:57,430
Speaker 0: And then when I'm at work, I can install things from our own private copy that I know I can keep up, right, even if the real PyPy goes down.

200
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:59,935
Speaker 0: OK, so I find how you do this.

201
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:07,570
Speaker 0: First, you have to install something from PyPy and then you run it and it starts to make a mirror of the original PyPy and then you're all set.

202
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:15,510
Speaker 0: So I'm running this and I let it go over the weekend and I come into work this morning and it says error or something.

203
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,252
Speaker 0: Something.

204
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:20,386
Speaker 0: HTTP response, bad, bad response, evil.

205
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,590
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what the fuck?

206
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,072
Speaker 0: This thing is so broken.

207
00:13:23,113 --> 00:13:23,373
Speaker 0: You can't.

208
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:30,910
Speaker 0: And then I go searching online and there was I saw the funniest thing, which was a Google groups post and a guy was like our news group post.

209
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,886
Speaker 0: And the guy was like, I was running Mirror D and I got this error after a long time.

210
00:13:36,926 --> 00:13:38,210
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure out how to fix it.

211
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,239
Speaker 0: So I'm just not going to run Mirror D anymore.

212
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,489
Speaker 0: And I'm like, well, that's where all those mirrors went to.

213
00:13:46,453 --> 00:13:50,890
Speaker 0: So then I found in Bitbucket there was actually a patch to make it work again.

214
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,270
Speaker 0: So I manually applied this patch to the mirror making thing and then started it up again.

215
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:00,535
Speaker 0: This is really a fucking problem.

216
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:08,890
Speaker 0: These PyPy people got to get their shit together because none of the other programming languages have this problem with their repositories.

217
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:19,230
Speaker 1: I've seen the opposite problem of a lot of people who want to write code in Perl have no idea how to get Perl modules.

218
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,797
Speaker 1: They can't even figure out how to get them.

219
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:32,030
Speaker 1: And that's why you'll see so many people post just raw Perl code in a forum and people just take it and copy paste it into their Perl script.

220
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,416
Speaker 0: I actually don't blame those people entirely, right?

221
00:14:34,496 --> 00:14:39,650
Speaker 0: Because the fact is when I was you know, I had a degree in computer science, right?

222
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,350
Speaker 0: The two things they never taught you at all in four years.

223
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,589
Speaker 1: Oh, because I can tell you the things they never teach you in IT.

224
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,516
Speaker 0: RIT, computer science education.

225
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,980
Speaker 0: Number one, they don't teach you.

226
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,090
Speaker 0: They didn't teach us anything at all about the Web.

227
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,830
Speaker 0: The only reason I knew how to make websites is because in high school, I did HTML on my fucking own middle school also.

228
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:58,171
Speaker 0: Right.

229
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,540
Speaker 0: They did not teach you anything about the Web at all.

230
00:15:01,981 --> 00:15:03,927
Speaker 0: Zero in college.

231
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:04,709
Speaker 0: None.

232
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:05,130
Speaker 0: Right.

233
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,401
Speaker 0: Which is the number one way to make money these days.

234
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:07,963
Speaker 1: Just the Web.

235
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:09,370
Speaker 1: or how about networking in general?

236
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:14,848
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I took networking classes on purpose, but yeah, I think maybe one was required.

237
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:15,310
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

238
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:15,650
Speaker 0: Anyway.

239
00:15:16,511 --> 00:15:17,252
Speaker 0: And number two.

240
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:18,113
Speaker 0: Right.

241
00:15:18,393 --> 00:15:34,530
Speaker 0: They teach you how to program in the language, but they don't teach you anything about, you know, development environments and, you know, setting up all that other stuff around the actual type, you know, typing of the code and knowing how the code works.

242
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:39,570
Speaker 0: It's like they don't tell you how to go, you know, get a library, install it and use it.

243
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,131
Speaker 0: Right.

244
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:42,818
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, you know, that's it.

245
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:47,790
Speaker 0: It's like if you're learning C, they they're like, oh, you just include Iostream and that's it.

246
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,283
Speaker 0: They don't tell you how to go and get, say, you know, libXML and start using that.

247
00:15:52,604 --> 00:15:53,747
Speaker 0: They tell you how to write an XML parse.

248
00:15:55,030 --> 00:16:00,647
Speaker 1: What's interesting is I see just people I talk to or hire or interview from non-RIT schools.

249
00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:01,650
Speaker 1: It's the opposite.

250
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,950
Speaker 1: That's the stuff they learn, but they don't learn the actual core fundamentals of program.

251
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:08,375
Speaker 0: Well, you need to learn both.

252
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:08,736
Speaker 0: You need to.

253
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:12,530
Speaker 0: you need to know how to program so that you could perhaps write your own library.

254
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:22,230
Speaker 0: But you also need to know how to go and get other people's code and then use it yourself and reuse it and install and get and do and such and such.

255
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,475
Speaker 1: Well, I've seen that, you know, and IT was kind of the same thing.

256
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:29,830
Speaker 1: Like they would teach you how DNS works, like what DNS was and how it worked.

257
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:34,229
Speaker 1: But they would not tell you anything about what demon it was or how to run it.

258
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like what is bind?

259
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:37,978
Speaker 0: There's a thing called bind.

260
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,522
Speaker 0: You apt-get install bind.

261
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:41,206
Speaker 0: The config files are here.

262
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:42,810
Speaker 0: You edit them like this.

263
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:44,508
Speaker 0: You restart it like this.

264
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,062
Speaker 1: So what about name-d?

265
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:46,469
Speaker 1: What's that?

266
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,430
Speaker 0: It's just an alternative.

267
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:49,011
Speaker 1: Yeah.

268
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,161
Speaker 1: So why would you use one over the other?

269
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,170
Speaker 1: Where do you get either one?

270
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,510
Speaker 0: Bind is like the do everything one and name-d.

271
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:56,630
Speaker 1: We're running Red Hat Bullshit Edition just because that's what's in the lab.

272
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:58,509
Speaker 0: Well, what year is it from?

273
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:01,630
Speaker 0: 2002? 2001?

274
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:09,790
Speaker 0: Well, any any DNS that's, you know, comes with that in the on the CD or whatever is probably way out of date and insecure.

275
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:13,249
Speaker 0: So what you need to do is you need to go get the source code for the modern one.

276
00:17:13,631 --> 00:17:15,010
Speaker 1: It's not going to help these people.

277
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,150
Speaker 0: The new version from the Internet and then compile it using the C stack.

278
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:28,690
Speaker 1: So in general, in IT, Red Hat, they did not teach anyone even the barest hints of how to use Linux.

279
00:17:29,492 --> 00:17:36,630
Speaker 0: You know, I took it was assumed a handful of IT classes that taught me bullshit that I already knew.

280
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,944
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they were pretty much how to use Linux.

281
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:41,390
Speaker 0: I had to write like some shell scripts.

282
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,202
Speaker 1: And then you take OS scripting.

283
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

284
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,869
Speaker 1: OS scripting is the guy's bash said awk.

285
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, I took that class.

286
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,469
Speaker 1: That class assumed you already fucking knew how to, you know, log in.

287
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,490
Speaker 0: I knew all three of those things before.

288
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:54,806
Speaker 1: And why did you take that class?

289
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,015
Speaker 0: Because easy credits.

290
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,770
Speaker 0: How do you think I fucking graduated failing calculus three, three times?

291
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,589
Speaker 1: I took that class when I was a freshman because it was a required class.

292
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,942
Speaker 1: Maybe I took it as a sophomore.

293
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:05,509
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

294
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,301
Speaker 0: It's also because I for my.

295
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:14,710
Speaker 1: That was the class where the two cool kids were those of us who would type start X when we got there and have a GUI.

296
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,841
Speaker 1: Anyway, all their kids would be like, how do you do that?

297
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:18,310
Speaker 1: I was like, you're not going to graduate.

298
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,002
Speaker 0: Because I chose a non C.S.

299
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:23,490
Speaker 0: concentration of security.

300
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,367
Speaker 0: And basically there were these two I.T.

301
00:18:26,387 --> 00:18:26,710
Speaker 0: security.

302
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:27,877
Speaker 1: Talk about I.T.

303
00:18:27,897 --> 00:18:29,690
Speaker 0: security, which are useless, by the way.

304
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:30,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I took the I.T.

305
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:32,630
Speaker 0: security, but I chose that when I was a freshman.

306
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:37,630
Speaker 0: And then the thing is, the prerequisites for those classes were things such as OS scripting.

307
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:38,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what?

308
00:18:39,037 --> 00:18:41,030
Speaker 1: I took that security class and it was garbage.

309
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:45,710
Speaker 1: I decided to not pursue the security sort of concentration stuff at RIT.

310
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:52,110
Speaker 0: Well, I had to choose this as a freshman and then it was already kind of what I had to pay to take other classes to change it up.

311
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,370
Speaker 1: I changed it up because I had so many extra credits.

312
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:54,953
Speaker 1: It didn't matter.

313
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:57,730
Speaker 1: But so, yeah, they did.

314
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:08,690
Speaker 1: So that class, when they talk about compilation, that one of the lab part was basically here are secure servers and here are servers that students set up.

315
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,589
Speaker 1: You've got to try to hack into both of them and document what you do.

316
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:12,554
Speaker 1: You know what?

317
00:19:12,936 --> 00:19:15,770
Speaker 1: They don't actually teach you anything about hacking.

318
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,439
Speaker 0: They didn't teach us one thing at all in that class.

319
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:21,169
Speaker 0: I had the same class and they didn't tell us what to do.

320
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,729
Speaker 0: It's like you just sort of had to do it on your own.

321
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you know what most kids did?

322
00:19:25,696 --> 00:19:28,928
Speaker 1: They infected themselves with viruses because they'd go online and be like,

323
00:19:30,471 --> 00:19:31,032
Speaker 1: "I.E.S.,

324
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:37,829
Speaker 1: crack, hack," and they'd find some Windows program that would purport to hack an I.I.S.

325
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:38,210
Speaker 1: server.

326
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,110
Speaker 1: And then it would just proceed to destroy their own computer.

327
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, the real problem I had in that class is what I did is I just went and looked.

328
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,570
Speaker 0: What I did in that class is I went to the Windows updates and I saw that there was a, you know, a recent fix, a recent patch.

329
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,309
Speaker 0: So I said, "Aha, I will go get the proof of concept exploit for that patch that was just made

330
00:19:56,349 --> 00:19:56,590
Speaker 0: today.".

331
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:59,050
Speaker 0: I know they haven't fucking updated those dumbasses, right?

332
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,749
Speaker 0: And I knew that they were using old ass Windows also.

333
00:20:02,573 --> 00:20:03,865
Speaker 0: The rule was they had to have a Windows 98 machine.

334
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:05,582
Speaker 0: So I was like, "Ah, ha, ha,

335
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:05,845
Speaker 0: ha.".

336
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:13,770
Speaker 0: So I went and I downloaded the source code for the, you know, it was an MSN messenger thingy, right?

337
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:24,427
Speaker 0: So all I had to do, and I even tested this on, I basically made a fresh computer, installed Windows 98 on it from the image, and then hit that computer and then I was going to repeat the process and it worked.

338
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 0: It totally worked.

339
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:34,630
Speaker 0: All I had to do was run MSN messenger and then like open this file and then basically it would open up a root command terminal on that machine.

340
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,789
Speaker 0: It was the easiest thing in the world.

341
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:43,210
Speaker 0: So I went to the Windows 98 machine that I was only allowed to attack one of the other groups, not all of them.

342
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:47,530
Speaker 0: So I went to their only Windows 98 machine, which was a virtual machine, right?

343
00:20:48,231 --> 00:21:03,849
Speaker 0: And what they had done is they had disabled every single, the execution rights from the user that we could log in as to every single executable file in the entire file system except for the, you know, extremely small handful that they were forced not to.

344
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:07,368
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, I can't run MSN messenger.

345
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:17,350
Speaker 1: And the worst part is, the first thing I thought, as every smart person thinks, and this is the old saying, amateurs attack technology, professionals attack people.

346
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:20,930
Speaker 1: I was just going to fucking go walk in and get physical access.

347
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:21,632
Speaker 0: We weren't.

348
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:24,170
Speaker 0: We also were not allowed to use physical access specifically.

349
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,260
Speaker 1: We were told specifically that it wasn't a joke.

350
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,490
Speaker 1: The rule is you can't go attack them physically.

351
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:33,430
Speaker 0: As soon as before they said that, I was like, I'm going to home to get my crowbar.

352
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,470
Speaker 0: I'm going to come back within an hour and get an A in this class so easily.

353
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,640
Speaker 1: And they were like, no, don't do it.

354
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:40,610
Speaker 1: Seriously, don't do it.

355
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,675
Speaker 1: Me saying don't do it isn't a test.

356
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:49,430
Speaker 0: And it's not like I was going to be able to fool other students in the same class who were on the lookout on purpose.

357
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,432
Speaker 0: Right.

358
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:54,469
Speaker 0: It's like and who, you know, really, they should make people just have normal.

359
00:21:55,051 --> 00:22:00,350
Speaker 0: You know, it's like everyone locked everything down to the point where they were just useless computers that couldn't do anything.

360
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:00,631
Speaker 0: Right.

361
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,223
Speaker 0: Because they were anticipating what the class was.

362
00:22:03,263 --> 00:22:04,650
Speaker 0: You can't possibly learn anything.

363
00:22:04,971 --> 00:22:14,610
Speaker 0: They should just force people to install default windows, all the updates, and then, you know, install a whole bunch of programs and then not be able to change anything on those user machines.

364
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:15,955
Speaker 1: I'd make it a little more clever.

365
00:22:15,975 --> 00:22:16,557
Speaker 1: It'd be a race.

366
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:19,970
Speaker 1: Like you have to run all these computers and make them do a bunch of stuff.

367
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:25,069
Speaker 1: And your grade is if you can get them to do that stuff, despite people attacking you.

368
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:27,555
Speaker 1: They also told us not to.

369
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,358
Speaker 0: It was a very bad class.

370
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:31,350
Speaker 1: They also told us not to DDoS the servers down, which was my go to.

371
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,153
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's like that's another thing.

372
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:41,010
Speaker 0: I found another exploit that was pretty much a, you know, if you DDoS this thing, then you can actually get root off of that.

373
00:22:41,713 --> 00:22:41,954
Speaker 0: Right.

374
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:45,570
Speaker 0: And I was like, well, how many computers in this lab can I provision?

375
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,595
Speaker 1: But basically all the exercises came down to.

376
00:22:50,376 --> 00:23:00,410
Speaker 1: you either need to be a programmer to take this exploit and write code to use it, or you need to be a script kitty and go find something online, which is just going to compromise you and it.

377
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,909
Speaker 1: It was a useless class.

378
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,452
Speaker 0: It was.

379
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:03,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, not good.

380
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:04,106
Speaker 0: Yeah.

381
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:04,610
Speaker 0: Anyway.

382
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:20,150
Speaker 1: Things of the day, I forgot this game existed until very recently when I was a kid, an adult friend of my dad's gave me a whole bunch of pirated games.

383
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,750
Speaker 0: So did everybody.

384
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:22,554
Speaker 1: Yep.

385
00:23:22,574 --> 00:23:24,450
Speaker 1: Because, you know, when I think back and I had my computer.

386
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,570
Speaker 0: First time I saw Wolfenstein 3D was a similar situation.

387
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,570
Speaker 1: The first games I ever got were pirated and I didn't even realize that was a thing.

388
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,862
Speaker 1: People were just like, oh, you want to try this game?

389
00:23:33,902 --> 00:23:34,686
Speaker 1: Here's a bunch of floppies.

390
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:35,290
Speaker 1: I was like, thanks.

391
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,840
Speaker 0: Yeah.

392
00:23:36,252 --> 00:23:37,008
Speaker 1: I didn't even think.

393
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:38,189
Speaker 0: I didn't even know.

394
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:44,104
Speaker 1: So one of the games he gave me was called Life and Death from 1988.

395
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:46,370
Speaker 1: I was obsessed with this game.

396
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:58,670
Speaker 1: This game is a disturbingly realistic simulator of hospital procedure, examination and surgery centering on the lower abdomen.

397
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:00,230
Speaker 1: Only the lower abdomen?

398
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:00,611
Speaker 1: Yes.

399
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,445
Speaker 1: You can.

400
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:06,550
Speaker 1: So you can poke the patients and they'll, you know, go, ah, or not say anything.

401
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,373
Speaker 1: You can tickle them.

402
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,000
Speaker 1: You can get ultrasounds.

403
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:10,204
Speaker 1: You can get X-rays.

404
00:24:10,385 --> 00:24:11,650
Speaker 1: You can prescribe medication.

405
00:24:12,191 --> 00:24:14,056
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of things that can be wrong with people.

406
00:24:14,096 --> 00:24:18,610
Speaker 1: They can have a lower respiratory or a lower abdominal infection of some kind.

407
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,198
Speaker 1: They could have appendicitis.

408
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,567
Speaker 1: They could have all these things.

409
00:24:21,648 --> 00:24:21,930
Speaker 1: Gas.

410
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:24,879
Speaker 1: And you just had to be a doctor.

411
00:24:25,241 --> 00:24:26,850
Speaker 1: It was super realistic and super tedious.

412
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,690
Speaker 1: If you think that these modern DS games of surgery are hard, play this fucking game.

413
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:33,128
Speaker 0: Good God.

414
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:39,930
Speaker 1: What I present to you is a speed run of a person performing an appendectomy.

415
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,770
Speaker 0: Is it computer assisted or legit?

416
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,362
Speaker 1: It looks legit.

417
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,350
Speaker 1: I never got the farthest I ever got.

418
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,610
Speaker 0: Just cut them open and they die?

419
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:51,005
Speaker 1: No, I figured out how to get the gas going.

420
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:54,670
Speaker 1: And I figured out when to inject them with atropine and all that stuff.

421
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:56,190
Speaker 1: And, you know, how to stop bleeding.

422
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,068
Speaker 1: The point where I always fuck up is when you get the periodontinum.

423
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:02,008
Speaker 0: Great.

424
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:05,230
Speaker 0: I'm glad you're not a doctor.

425
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,920
Speaker 1: The peritoneum, as Emily corrected me.

426
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:13,347
Speaker 1: I would always rupture it.

427
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:13,990
Speaker 1: Always.

428
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,829
Speaker 0: Let me look with that.

429
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:15,835
Speaker 1: And then the patient would die.

430
00:25:15,996 --> 00:25:18,270
Speaker 1: Basically, I would cut their bowels open and they would die.

431
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,548
Speaker 0: I'm looking this up.

432
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,410
Speaker 1: Now, there's a way to save them if you fuck that up, which I was never able to do.

433
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's what you're trying to do.

434
00:25:25,631 --> 00:25:27,400
Speaker 1: This game is super hard and this is a speed run.

435
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,510
Speaker 1: You should all watch it and play this game on DOSBox.

436
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:32,646
Speaker 0: Okay, so...

437
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,490
Speaker 1: Don't forget to do... Oh my god, there's a sequel.

438
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:38,838
Speaker 1: Life and death 2, the brain.

439
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:41,552
Speaker 0: Really?

440
00:25:41,572 --> 00:25:42,697
Speaker 0: They went straight for the brain?

441
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:45,490
Speaker 0: Wouldn't you think that level 2 would be like upper abdomen?

442
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,670
Speaker 0: Like, you know, rib breaking, heart surgeries, lungs?

443
00:25:51,612 --> 00:25:52,590
Speaker 0: It's a brain surgery.

444
00:25:53,712 --> 00:25:55,690
Speaker 0: Oh, those graphics are vastly improved.

445
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,467
Speaker 1: I think that one of these games is on the Apple 2GS.

446
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:01,769
Speaker 0: Oh, but actually the brain is severely... Well, that's the skull.

447
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:04,448
Speaker 1: They haven't cut that bit open yet.

448
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:05,870
Speaker 0: Okay.

449
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:08,009
Speaker 1: These games are so hard.

450
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:08,920
Speaker 0: Anyway...

451
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,730
Speaker 1: Also, they're super gross because they're super realistic.

452
00:26:12,252 --> 00:26:13,990
Speaker 0: Oh, it's super DOS pixelated.

453
00:26:14,251 --> 00:26:18,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's still... I'm not even great at grossed out and I'm usually, you know... It's still super realistic.

454
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:19,949
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

455
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:20,910
Speaker 1: Anyway...

456
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,384
Speaker 0: Okay, so someone made this cute little video.

457
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:24,450
Speaker 0: It's just two minutes long.

458
00:26:25,015 --> 00:26:28,790
Speaker 0: In which the D train... They're trying to coax the D train out of the tunnel.

459
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,768
Speaker 1: This is adorbs.

460
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,385
Speaker 0: It's cute.

461
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,022
Speaker 0: You should watch it.

462
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,490
Speaker 0: If you're from New York City or you've been here, it's funnier.

463
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,928
Speaker 0: If you're not from here, you don't get the joke because we're better than you.

464
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:40,835
Speaker 1: Ah.

465
00:26:42,056 --> 00:26:43,009
Speaker 1: I had that conundrum today.

466
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,930
Speaker 1: Sitting on a train that's stuck because of some other bullshit.

467
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,050
Speaker 1: And then the local train comes up across the platform and I debate.

468
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:51,330
Speaker 1: Do I bail?

469
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:52,309
Speaker 0: Yes.

470
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:54,910
Speaker 1: Bailing was the correct choice in this case.

471
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,210
Speaker 0: In my case, basically my new policy is any sign of anything, immediate bail.

472
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,450
Speaker 1: But bail to what?

473
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,963
Speaker 1: What if you're at like fucking 23rd street?

474
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,770
Speaker 0: Okay, and what train am I trying to get?

475
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,909
Speaker 1: Well, you're on the 6th and you're trying to get home.

476
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,422
Speaker 0: And I switch to the N to 23rd.

477
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:10,546
Speaker 0: You can do that.

478
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,220
Speaker 1: Can you?

479
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:12,710
Speaker 0: Madison Square Park, there's N trains.

480
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,770
Speaker 1: You have to walk all the way... I guess you could walk over there.

481
00:27:14,931 --> 00:27:15,988
Speaker 0: Walk a little... It's not far.

482
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:16,789
Speaker 0: It's a block.

483
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,670
Speaker 1: If you don't have an unlimited card though, that's not a free transfer.

484
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,110
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

485
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,229
Speaker 0: Too bad I have an unlimited card because I'm the best.

486
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,629
Speaker 1: I'm ditching my unlimited card because I calculated it is bullshit to have an unlimited card nowadays.

487
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,141
Speaker 0: I've been thinking about it, but it's sort of...

488
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,330
Speaker 1: If I bike one day every other week this summer, it's not worth it to have an unlimited card.

489
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,488
Speaker 0: The thing is, if it's raining and...

490
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:40,349
Speaker 1: And you do a show.

491
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,210
Speaker 0: And I do a show.

492
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:42,328
Speaker 0: A show is three trips.

493
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:49,188
Speaker 1: Scott, I read somebody that calculated you have to use it twice a day every weekday and eight times over the course of every weekend or it's not worth it.

494
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:51,886
Speaker 1: One, two, three... Anyway, anyway.

495
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,249
Speaker 0: Metamoment.

496
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,069
Speaker 1: The Book Club book is a book.

497
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,568
Speaker 0: It is The Player of Games by E.N.M.

498
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:57,830
Speaker 0: Banks.

499
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,590
Speaker 1: It has been described as being in our collective wheelhouse.

500
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,129
Speaker 0: It is the wheelhouse.

501
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,108
Speaker 0: Have you read any of it yet?

502
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,989
Speaker 1: Not yet because I've been busy getting ready for... Oh my God, PAX.

503
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,750
Speaker 0: PAX East is really close.

504
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,129
Speaker 0: Let's talk a whole bunch about it.

505
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,370
Speaker 1: Oh my God, PAX is coming.

506
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,350
Speaker 0: It's fucking next week.

507
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,570
Speaker 0: As in, there is a weekend approaching.

508
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,207
Speaker 0: The weekend after the approaching weekend is PAX East.

509
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,710
Speaker 1: We are doing two lectures at the PAX East, the PAX, the Penny Arcade Expo.

510
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,510
Speaker 1: At noon on Saturday, Mastering Game Mechanics Tabletop Workshop.

511
00:28:27,971 --> 00:28:29,015
Speaker 1: At 1.30 p.m.

512
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:32,650
Speaker 1: on Saturday, same room, Practical Game Theory.

513
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:37,510
Speaker 1: Think of this as like Games 101, Games 203.

514
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,990
Speaker 1: This is like hardcore.

515
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,330
Speaker 1: We're going to teach you guys stuff.

516
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,549
Speaker 0: We're also enforcing.

517
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:48,268
Speaker 0: So don't expect to see us too much because we'll be working, I guess, a shift each day or whatever it is.

518
00:28:48,371 --> 00:28:49,366
Speaker 0: Whatever they tell me to do.

519
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,290
Speaker 1: I put in primarily for hardcore main theater logistics.

520
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,908
Speaker 1: So maybe I'll be in there.

521
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,730
Speaker 1: Jam Space, maybe I'll be in there dicking around with my harmonica.

522
00:28:59,151 --> 00:28:59,829
Speaker 0: Oh, thank God.

523
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,050
Speaker 0: You'll be in the Jam Space and not bothering anyone else.

524
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,450
Speaker 1: Or I'm going for line entertainment.

525
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,150
Speaker 0: Okay, I chose Tabletop, Info Boof, and whatever, whatever, whatever.

526
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,030
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit really.

527
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,909
Speaker 1: You've got to print out a Bidoof for the Info Boof.

528
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,988
Speaker 0: Maybe I will.

529
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,304
Speaker 0: Info Bidoof.

530
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:17,569
Speaker 1: Also, Kineticon, our panel submissions are still open.

531
00:29:17,953 --> 00:29:19,210
Speaker 1: Though we are currently scheduling.

532
00:29:19,432 --> 00:29:19,850
Speaker 1: And you know what?

533
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,365
Speaker 1: Someone just submitted like 15 panels.

534
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,530
Speaker 1: So good on you.

535
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,127
Speaker 0: Nice.

536
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,410
Speaker 1: Might have been multiple people, but those all came in today.

537
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,048
Speaker 1: I'm at work and I just see this flood of panels coming in.

538
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,489
Speaker 0: Hopefully they're not bad.

539
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:30,929
Speaker 1: One of them looked really good.

540
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,090
Speaker 1: I didn't look at the rest of them yet.

541
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:33,069
Speaker 0: Fourteen look really good.

542
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,730
Speaker 1: Fourteen Homestuck panels.

543
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,203
Speaker 0: Great.

544
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,349
Speaker 0: We only need one, guys.

545
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,069
Speaker 0: One is enough.

546
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:41,770
Speaker 0: There's still more meta.

547
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,349
Speaker 1: You want to do more meta?

548
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:44,290
Speaker 0: A little bit.

549
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:44,687
Speaker 0: All right.

550
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:44,983
Speaker 1: Go.

551
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:45,529
Speaker 1: Go for it.

552
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,330
Speaker 1: I just stopped recording.

553
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,129
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought you did.

554
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,130
Speaker 0: No, I didn't do anything.

555
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:49,066
Speaker 1: Don't do.

556
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,450
Speaker 1: What?

557
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,490
Speaker 1: Are you reading my body language?

558
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,350
Speaker 0: Anyway, the Grand Prix is still ongoing.

559
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,269
Speaker 1: Well, because.

560
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:06,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of delayed the backgammon one because as I pointed out, Timo and I could mutually share a score of one times ten to the two hundred and three anyway in the first round.

561
00:30:06,781 --> 00:30:06,870
Speaker 0: Sure.

562
00:30:07,311 --> 00:30:10,070
Speaker 0: So the second round is backgammon.

563
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,168
Speaker 0: It will be backgammon.

564
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:18,290
Speaker 0: But I think, you know, we have had much discussion after the announcement around of changing of the format specifically.

565
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,629
Speaker 1: You don't want me to collaborate with someone to have a score of one times ten to the two hundred and three?

566
00:30:23,012 --> 00:30:24,829
Speaker 0: I really don't think that it would matter that much.

567
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,550
Speaker 1: I think it would matter heavily because no one else had the dedication to do that.

568
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,470
Speaker 1: Also, because of the possibility of capturing pieces, the game could go on forever.

569
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,879
Speaker 0: But why would you let it go on forever?

570
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,560
Speaker 1: So that my score is effectively infinity.

571
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,718
Speaker 0: But what if you lose?

572
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,038
Speaker 0: Now your score is zero.

573
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,520
Speaker 1: So the other guy's infinity.

574
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,460
Speaker 1: So me and Timo collaborate.

575
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,480
Speaker 1: One of us wins the five games and at the end of it, his score is five times effectively infinity and my score is three times effectively infinity.

576
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,520
Speaker 0: So you're in big trouble.

577
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:00,520
Speaker 0: You're going to get two more infinities.

578
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,840
Speaker 1: So the next highest score is probably like 40 and I get a guaranteed second place, which is a shit ton of points in the Grand Prix.

579
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're going to change the format.

580
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:20,440
Speaker 0: I have a feeling we're going to have to sacrifice at least one of the principles of the Grand Prix, and I think I have decided to sacrifice the principle of the Grand Prix won't take fucking forever.

581
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,679
Speaker 0: So it's probably going to last some months.

582
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:24,198
Speaker 1: That's how it's going to go.

583
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:24,540
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,577
Speaker 1: So honestly, if you had to do the original timeline, I actually wasn't.

585
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:31,540
Speaker 1: I was going to do that first round infinity and then not compete in the rest of it because I'm busy.

586
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:31,852
Speaker 0: Right.

587
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:35,100
Speaker 0: So the Grand Prix is going to be a slow Grand Prix, right?

588
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,440
Speaker 0: Maybe in fact, we should just change it to be forever ongoing.

589
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,539
Speaker 0: Do we just keep having rounds and we keep seeing who's the best?

590
00:31:43,521 --> 00:31:48,499
Speaker 0: Of course, as the rounds go on, you know, there'll be a lot less movement in the upper ranks, but you never know.

591
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,154
Speaker 0: Someone might bail and you can sneak up there with the.

592
00:31:51,335 --> 00:31:52,079
Speaker 1: I'd rather finish it.

593
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:59,460
Speaker 1: And then you can start a new one with different parameters, like maybe one that isn't accessible, one that, you know what, PC games only got to own them all.

594
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,260
Speaker 0: Got to have a real hardcore computer and a fast Internet.

595
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,758
Speaker 0: Got to have a physical Atari.

596
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:04,679
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,298
Speaker 0: Anyway, you just want to win.

598
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:08,320
Speaker 0: Don't worry, rim.

599
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,937
Speaker 0: I have a feeling some of the rounds may be favorable to you.

600
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,457
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm thinking now, you know, maybe we'll to make it more fair.

601
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:16,703
Speaker 0: Right.

602
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:21,900
Speaker 0: We're going to make it go a little longer, add some more rounds, take some push some of the time limits back on things.

603
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,401
Speaker 0: Right.

604
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:32,459
Speaker 0: And so look for an updated post on the reformatted backgammon second round, you know, and we'll see what happens.

605
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,940
Speaker 0: And it's still an experiment to write.

606
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:41,060
Speaker 0: It's like once we can figure out the logistics of this kind of thing, maybe, you know, it could evolve into something better.

607
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:41,844
Speaker 1: Yep.

608
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:44,500
Speaker 1: And don't forget our relatively new, ongoing show.

609
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:52,107
Speaker 1: Geek Nights presents is continuing with Shoujo Kakamei Utena or five in thirty five or so to go.

610
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:52,777
Speaker 1: That's a lot.

611
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,080
Speaker 1: OK, so this is Scott's idea.

612
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:58,540
Speaker 0: So, you know, we're trying to think of a tech show.

613
00:32:58,681 --> 00:33:00,060
Speaker 0: We're pretty much out of ideas.

614
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,861
Speaker 0: So if there's anything you want us to talk about at a Monday show, you should let us know about that.

615
00:33:05,206 --> 00:33:09,982
Speaker 0: But one idea that I came up with just out of nowhere is a lot of these tech websites.

616
00:33:10,042 --> 00:33:24,646
Speaker 0: What they do is they'll find a famous or semi-famous tech person and they'll sort of do a post like what's in their bag, like what, you know, and they'll empty the person's bag out, take a photo of it and ask them about all the gadgets they have and use frequently.

617
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:25,960
Speaker 0: So I don't carry a bag anymore.

618
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:26,642
Speaker 0: Great.

619
00:33:27,123 --> 00:33:38,860
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking, hey, let's just do a show where we discuss sort of our technological arsenals, like what are the gadgets and devices of technological nature?

620
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,040
Speaker 0: or relatively, I mean, even a fork is technology, right?

621
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:56,156
Speaker 0: I'm talking about like an advanced, right, fire, the items of an advanced transistor based, you know, Scott was really unhappy with my questioning of the parameters of this discussion before the show.

622
00:33:57,641 --> 00:33:57,883
Speaker 0: Right.

623
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:01,340
Speaker 1: That you use frequently, there was a little bit of consternation.

624
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:07,987
Speaker 0: I don't want to get talking into like what pens I've got or notebooks or, you know, about that.

625
00:34:08,309 --> 00:34:09,014
Speaker 0: That's not Monday shit.

626
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,199
Speaker 0: That's that shit is all good.

627
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,003
Speaker 0: But it's not.

628
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:14,981
Speaker 1: So I wake up in the morning feeling like P. Diddy.

629
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:25,799
Speaker 1: OK, so pretty much if I think about what I interact with first and last and what I interact with the most times throughout the day, it's my cell phone.

630
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,560
Speaker 0: Well, obviously, it's what phone you have.

631
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:29,817
Speaker 1: I still have my Samsung Nexus S.

632
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:32,199
Speaker 0: And you don't feel like you need something better?

633
00:34:32,782 --> 00:34:39,438
Speaker 1: I refuse to upgrade until I'm forced to, because there's no phone that small that exists, that isn't a piece of shit.

634
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:49,219
Speaker 1: So I'm going to hold on to this phone until either Google forces me to to make Google Glass work or I physically break it, can't get another one.

635
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,779
Speaker 1: I've replaced it with a refurbished one already once.

636
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:58,120
Speaker 1: And I'm not going to get an iPhone because I'm morally opposed to the lockdown.

637
00:34:59,282 --> 00:35:02,740
Speaker 0: You realize the iPhone is probably less locked down.

638
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,264
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see.

639
00:35:04,364 --> 00:35:07,580
Speaker 0: I mean, in terms I mean, a Verizon iPhone is evil as Verizon.

640
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,478
Speaker 0: I don't have Verizon.

641
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,162
Speaker 1: What?

642
00:35:09,182 --> 00:35:10,040
Speaker 0: I don't have Verizon.

643
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,311
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you could switch, but it's not locked at all.

644
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:17,219
Speaker 0: I can go to any country with this phone, with any SIM card, and it'll totally work.

645
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,498
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm saying there's iOS.

646
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

647
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,780
Speaker 0: I mean, jailbreaking iOS is no different than rooting Android.

648
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,613
Speaker 0: It's the same shit.

649
00:35:23,716 --> 00:35:23,940
Speaker 0: True.

650
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,727
Speaker 0: So how?

651
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,880
Speaker 0: what's the difference in lockdown?

652
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,608
Speaker 1: Honestly, it's mostly not like it's.

653
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:32,619
Speaker 0: not like they give you a dev kit for the Android phone and say, go nuts, kid.

654
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:33,025
Speaker 0: Right.

655
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,039
Speaker 0: Hack it all you want.

656
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,599
Speaker 1: If you really want to get down to it is that I plan to, as much as is feasible, side load bullshit for glass if I get glass.

657
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:44,640
Speaker 0: Well, what do you need to side load bullshit for glass?

658
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,478
Speaker 0: The glasses itself.

659
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:46,620
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,587
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

661
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,199
Speaker 1: I need applications to do cool stuff.

662
00:35:50,001 --> 00:35:51,900
Speaker 0: You load those into the glass themselves.

663
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,594
Speaker 1: Not 100 percent.

664
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:53,818
Speaker 1: There's.

665
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:56,460
Speaker 1: Have you read any of the documents about how this thing all works?

666
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,880
Speaker 0: What documents are you reading?

667
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,060
Speaker 0: Bob, stuff on the internet.

668
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,172
Speaker 0: Because it says glass works with iPhone.

669
00:36:00,212 --> 00:36:00,900
Speaker 0: So how is that going to work?

670
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,620
Speaker 1: It does work with iPhone, but I think more cool stuff is going to come out for Android first.

671
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:15,319
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think that the here's my thinking, right, is that if glass comes to be, which it will, and, you know, we're definitely going to have it by next year.

672
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:19,459
Speaker 0: Even if they don't give them to us early in the Explorers Club, we'll just buy them.

673
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:20,223
Speaker 0: Right.

674
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:20,747
Speaker 0: Yeah.

675
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:22,379
Speaker 0: And that should be by the end of the year.

676
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,462
Speaker 0: Right.

677
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:35,362
Speaker 0: So a large phone will become still annoying and stupid, but slightly less annoying and stupid because you could just keep that large phone in your pocket and never take it the fuck out.

678
00:36:35,382 --> 00:36:40,999
Speaker 1: The problem is, if I have glass, I actually want an even smaller phone because I'll use it less.

679
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:47,343
Speaker 1: I want is in fact, at that point, I just want a tiny brick that I stick in my bag and never touch again.

680
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,860
Speaker 1: I just charge it once a day wirelessly wherever I am.

681
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,321
Speaker 1: And that's it.

682
00:36:52,626 --> 00:36:59,439
Speaker 1: Anyway, but I'm thinking about it when I wake up in the morning, literally my phone wakes me up and replace my alarm clock.

683
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:00,724
Speaker 1: A hundred percent.

684
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 0: I still have a clock, but the phone is has the alarm on it.

685
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,620
Speaker 1: But I also have a clock.

686
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,799
Speaker 0: And the only reason I have the clock is that if I open my eyes, I can see the time without having to grab and touch the phone.

687
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:21,040
Speaker 1: I have glasses and the clock is on Emily's side of the bed, so I can't actually see the clock, but it is the clock that I had in middle school.

688
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,759
Speaker 0: I have an ice tube clock.

689
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:24,440
Speaker 0: It was actually a kit that I built.

690
00:37:25,183 --> 00:37:27,540
Speaker 0: You can get it from Adafruit.

691
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,920
Speaker 0: I mean, you buy it and then you solder it together.

692
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,840
Speaker 1: I wake up because my alarm is going off.

693
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,619
Speaker 1: I reach over, I pick up my phone, I look at it.

694
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,219
Speaker 1: It's the first thing I see.

695
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,939
Speaker 1: I fuck around the Internet for like five minutes.

696
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

697
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:43,318
Speaker 1: And at the end of the day, I look at my phone, make sure the alarm set, fucker out for five minutes and go to sleep.

698
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,840
Speaker 1: So it literally bookends my life and is my source of data throughout the entire day.

699
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,959
Speaker 0: I have iPhone five, pretty much the same thing.

700
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:53,324
Speaker 0: Yeah.

701
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,500
Speaker 0: So what other things do I have?

702
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,179
Speaker 1: Oh, the other reason I'm waiting is that when I, you know, lockdown, think of it more in the sense of I'm not on contract right now.

703
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:04,900
Speaker 1: I don't want to be on contract with anyone for as long as possible.

704
00:38:05,842 --> 00:38:08,520
Speaker 1: OK, that way I can switch providers suddenly if I want.

705
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,079
Speaker 0: I just switched every two years and the contract runs out.

706
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm currently out of contract.

707
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:16,140
Speaker 0: So if that's what that's how I constantly have a new phone.

708
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,461
Speaker 0: Yeah.

709
00:38:16,481 --> 00:38:22,019
Speaker 1: But if I upgrade or re-up or switch, I'll be locked in again because I don't really want to pay the six or seven hundred.

710
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,419
Speaker 0: You could buy it on like.

711
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:24,142
Speaker 0: Yeah.

712
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:30,363
Speaker 0: OK, so I have this pebble watch that I got because Kickstarter has that working out for you.

713
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:35,560
Speaker 0: You know, on the one hand, when it works, it does one and only one thing.

714
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,044
Speaker 0: Well, you see notifications, you see notifications on your arm without having to take your phone out of your pocket.

715
00:38:40,788 --> 00:38:45,640
Speaker 0: The problem is and I'm not sure how much this is the fault of the pebble and how much is the fault of the iPhone.

716
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,684
Speaker 0: It seems to forget to.

717
00:38:48,648 --> 00:38:52,240
Speaker 0: I guess I think the iPhone forgets to notify the pebbles.

718
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:01,600
Speaker 0: You have to go into the iPhone and sort of like touch a bunch of stuff to get it to remember, you know, for each app, like, yeah, by the way, Gmail app, you should notify.

719
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:02,664
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

720
00:39:02,725 --> 00:39:05,140
Speaker 0: By the way, Twitter app, you should notify.

721
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:07,319
Speaker 0: And it takes like about a minute to do that.

722
00:39:07,521 --> 00:39:08,589
Speaker 1: So it's useless.

723
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:10,120
Speaker 0: then it's a little bit annoying.

724
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:13,880
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for that iPhone watch so I can get rid of this pebble watch.

725
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm thinking about buying Apple stock ahead of that watch coming out.

726
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,159
Speaker 1: I think people are just underestimating how crazy awesome a working AR watch will be.

727
00:39:22,581 --> 00:39:24,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's not an AR watch.

728
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,919
Speaker 0: It's really just a cell phone on your arm.

729
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's a display for your cell phone on your arm.

730
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,076
Speaker 0: Well, I think that will probably run on iOS.

731
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:36,023
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that it'll be a device in itself and not necessarily something that needs to work with.

732
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:38,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'll buy one of those day one, no matter what.

733
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:41,298
Speaker 0: And maybe not if it's a thousand dollars, but it won't be.

734
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,525
Speaker 0: Let's see what other.

735
00:39:43,646 --> 00:39:50,080
Speaker 1: So if we go in order of things I interact with that are notable, it's kitchen appliances, which Scott seems incredibly unhappy.

736
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,316
Speaker 0: I don't think kitchen appliances are applicable to Monday.

737
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,446
Speaker 1: These are technology.

738
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:57,980
Speaker 0: We could do a whole Thursday show just on kitchen appliances.

739
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,540
Speaker 1: But I want to talk about these two things.

740
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,320
Speaker 0: Why would he waste them all on Monday?

741
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,167
Speaker 0: Because I interact with these.

742
00:40:03,187 --> 00:40:07,899
Speaker 1: if we're talking about the 10 significant things I interact with on a daily basis.

743
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,540
Speaker 0: Who said that you're coming up with that 10 significant things out of nowhere and five.

744
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,748
Speaker 1: I don't interact with that.

745
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,040
Speaker 0: I'm not saying any specific number.

746
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,640
Speaker 0: I'm saying what is your technological arsenal?

747
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:21,459
Speaker 1: Well, if it's my arsenal that I carry around with me, it's literally just my cell phone.

748
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,144
Speaker 0: And that's it.

749
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:24,540
Speaker 1: And possibly my laptop.

750
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:29,080
Speaker 1: If I'm going somewhere where I'm going to do work at some point while I'm out there.

751
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,339
Speaker 0: No, I have many more items.

752
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,562
Speaker 0: I got this Lenovo X 201, which is the last one that had the good keyboard and the good touchpad.

753
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:43,144
Speaker 1: You mean the slightly not the worst touchpad in the world, but still terrible touchpad.

754
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:45,660
Speaker 1: I don't like that touchpad.

755
00:40:45,982 --> 00:40:48,583
Speaker 0: Oh, this one is way better than the X 230.

756
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:48,929
Speaker 1: I'll agree.

757
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,479
Speaker 0: My work.

758
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:53,020
Speaker 0: I have the X to whatever the one above this.

759
00:40:53,381 --> 00:40:54,045
Speaker 0: But right.

760
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:56,720
Speaker 0: And that one, the touchpad is horrendously useless.

761
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,160
Speaker 0: You know, this one is just fine.

762
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
Speaker 1: Dells actually have really nice touchpads.

763
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,840
Speaker 0: The Apple touchpad is the best.

764
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,840
Speaker 1: But every other aspect of Dell laptops makes me want to kill babies.

765
00:41:05,645 --> 00:41:07,700
Speaker 0: The Apple touchpad, the magic trackpad.

766
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:15,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have my Lenovo X 230, but I don't consider it part of my arsenal because I literally only carry it when I'm going to need horsepower on the go.

767
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,420
Speaker 0: I use mine at conventions.

768
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,780
Speaker 0: I use mine to bring here for podcasting.

769
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,739
Speaker 0: I use mine to compute if I don't want to get out of bed.

770
00:41:23,962 --> 00:41:27,540
Speaker 0: I use it when I need like, you know, a separate computer to be doing something.

771
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,980
Speaker 0: And I don't want my main computer to be doing it.

772
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,060
Speaker 1: I do it for all those things.

773
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:32,520
Speaker 1: But it's not in terms.

774
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:40,139
Speaker 1: I interact with my Japanese fancy hot water heater way more often than I interact with my laptop because that shit saves me time.

775
00:41:41,022 --> 00:41:41,283
Speaker 0: OK.

776
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,480
Speaker 1: It keeps water at the exact right temperature for either coffee or tea.

777
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:45,879
Speaker 1: And it's just sitting there already.

778
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:46,924
Speaker 1: Super efficient.

779
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,159
Speaker 1: And I just hit a button and I make my tea.

780
00:41:49,662 --> 00:41:49,963
Speaker 0: Great.

781
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:52,760
Speaker 0: What other things do I have?

782
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,993
Speaker 0: I have stuff.

783
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,300
Speaker 1: I mean, in front of me, I got a Samsung Sync Master 172 X. And I got Adele.

784
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,920
Speaker 0: That's my monitor that you took.

785
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,405
Speaker 0: It is.

786
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,199
Speaker 1: Want it back?

787
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,442
Speaker 0: Not really.

788
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:12,658
Speaker 1: And I got Adele UltraSharp 16 by 10, which I'm going to get a second one of those and get rid of the Samsung Sync Master 172 X.

789
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:14,520
Speaker 0: I have two of that monitor.

790
00:42:14,761 --> 00:42:15,880
Speaker 1: I'm going to have two of this monitor.

791
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,680
Speaker 1: I'm going to put them like this.

792
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,778
Speaker 0: I have them on arms.

793
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,940
Speaker 0: I think they're ergo whatever arms.

794
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,300
Speaker 0: If you look at my Amazon review history, you'll see what kind of arms they are.

795
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,620
Speaker 1: I'm not going to arm it until I replace my desk with a permanent desk.

796
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,980
Speaker 0: Your desk would not arm well at all.

797
00:42:29,182 --> 00:42:30,740
Speaker 0: At least not with the kind of arms I get.

798
00:42:31,461 --> 00:42:33,560
Speaker 1: I would get a different kind of desk, I think, in the long run.

799
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:34,959
Speaker 1: I would get one that I can hang.

800
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,200
Speaker 1: Basically, I need one that I can actually fit the monitor on.

801
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Speaker 1: The monitor is too big to fit in the monitor hole.

802
00:42:41,964 --> 00:42:43,159
Speaker 1: So it's in front of the monitor hole.

803
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,880
Speaker 0: I didn't like that desk when you got it, but you got it.

804
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,140
Speaker 1: Oh, I loved it up until this point.

805
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,200
Speaker 1: I mean, I fit that gigantic CRT in there for the longest time.

806
00:42:51,841 --> 00:42:52,999
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's see.

807
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,479
Speaker 0: What other things do I have?

808
00:42:55,343 --> 00:42:56,440
Speaker 1: We talk about all the Geeknight stuff.

809
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:02,720
Speaker 1: I mean, I got my awesome computer, but I haven't really fussed with that computer much in a long time.

810
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,220
Speaker 1: And it's so powerful.

811
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,738
Speaker 1: I won't need to upgrade it for easily another year.

812
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:08,639
Speaker 0: Probably even longer than that.

813
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,240
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to have to add a new video card to it within the next year because I have a GTX 260 in there.

814
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:16,073
Speaker 0: That's pretty old, right?

815
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:16,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

816
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:17,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:18,840
Speaker 1: I'm going to get a 680.

818
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,779
Speaker 1: I was waiting for a price drop.

819
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:20,725
Speaker 0: I would just wait.

820
00:43:20,947 --> 00:43:22,459
Speaker 0: I just get a 780 when it came out.

821
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:23,144
Speaker 1: Depends.

822
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:24,320
Speaker 0: Maybe it depends.

823
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:27,620
Speaker 1: I don't know if I. if the 780 comes out, I might get the 680 super cheap.

824
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it'll still be.

825
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:32,272
Speaker 0: now the 780 will be like 260.

826
00:43:32,272 --> 00:43:34,840
Speaker 1: plays all my games at pretty high frame rates.

827
00:43:35,041 --> 00:43:38,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, I only want the 680 for Premiere live rendering of effects.

828
00:43:38,861 --> 00:43:41,540
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, on the one hand, I totally agree.

829
00:43:41,641 --> 00:43:43,818
Speaker 0: I had a 460 and I just got rid of it.

830
00:43:44,502 --> 00:43:44,683
Speaker 0: All right.

831
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:46,733
Speaker 0: And the 460 when I got rid of it could still play.

832
00:43:46,753 --> 00:43:48,200
Speaker 0: all the games are pretty high frame rates.

833
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:50,502
Speaker 0: But now they have the 680.

834
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:50,744
Speaker 0: Right.

835
00:43:51,127 --> 00:43:52,820
Speaker 0: I can play every game.

836
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:54,114
Speaker 0: All the games.

837
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:54,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

838
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:01,540
Speaker 1: Scott, can you play settings in full frame vertical sync no matter what of your last 10 hours of PC gaming?

839
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,760
Speaker 1: How many of them have been something that wasn't natural selection to all natural selection to natural selection to run fine on my computer?

840
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,739
Speaker 0: Bob, but are you playing at full settings?

841
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:12,225
Speaker 1: Actually, no, I'm not.

842
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,853
Speaker 0: Are you playing at 19, whatever?

843
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,940
Speaker 1: I am playing at my full resolution.

844
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,120
Speaker 0: OK, but yeah, I have the full set.

845
00:44:19,884 --> 00:44:22,780
Speaker 1: I couldn't play my games in my full native resolution.

846
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:23,942
Speaker 1: Fuck that noise.

847
00:44:24,022 --> 00:44:24,223
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:44:24,543 --> 00:44:30,860
Speaker 0: I'm playing a full res 100 percent max, every possible setting, even anti aliasing, even endisotropic.

849
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:35,859
Speaker 1: Apparently in the new Tomb Raider, there is an effect called Tress something that's just her hair.

850
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:36,783
Speaker 0: OK.

851
00:44:37,104 --> 00:44:39,255
Speaker 1: And if you turn it on, you lose 15 and 30 FPS.

852
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,900
Speaker 0: It's so I have vertical sync at 60 FPS on all the time.

853
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,020
Speaker 0: 100 percent of the time, if you look at the benchmarks.

854
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,182
Speaker 0: Right.

855
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:48,359
Speaker 0: It's just a flat line.

856
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:54,900
Speaker 0: And I can run fraps at 60 FPS recording while I'm playing and still not lose.

857
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:56,246
Speaker 1: I have a feeling.

858
00:44:56,286 --> 00:44:58,319
Speaker 1: the fraps are you writing to an SSD?

859
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,528
Speaker 0: All it also works.

860
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:02,040
Speaker 0: writing to the magnetic drive I tested.

861
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,000
Speaker 0: No, it's great, you know, but I mean, that's a 60 gig per second seriality either way.

862
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:07,341
Speaker 0: Right.

863
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:13,640
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not like it's a slow magnet drive, but yeah, the video card was five hundred dollars.

864
00:45:14,181 --> 00:45:22,140
Speaker 0: But having the best video card once you have it, you realize sort of like, oh, that's why those crazy people, SLI and crazy shit.

865
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:23,739
Speaker 1: I bet that is real.

866
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:30,440
Speaker 1: I remember when I spent four hundred bucks on a creative graphics blaster extreme.

867
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,904
Speaker 0: This is why I will never buy.

868
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:36,820
Speaker 0: Well, unless I win a lottery or something, I should never buy a Ferrari because then I won't be able to drive a different car.

869
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,499
Speaker 0: I'll be like, what the fuck is this really fast, not hundred thousand dollar car?

870
00:45:43,602 --> 00:45:46,020
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, I think this applies to other aspects of your life.

871
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,540
Speaker 1: How would you feel about going to the Outback Steakhouse?

872
00:45:51,028 --> 00:45:51,659
Speaker 1: See what happens?

873
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:53,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I see what happens.

874
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:57,576
Speaker 1: Actually, I could feel Outback because they make a particular kind of average prime rib.

875
00:45:57,596 --> 00:45:58,480
Speaker 1: that's actually pretty good.

876
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,479
Speaker 0: I mean, I really like that fucking bloomin' onion thing.

877
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,320
Speaker 1: That's basically carnal food, though.

878
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,040
Speaker 0: You can get it at Chili's also, and I think I'm not going to Chili's.

879
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,540
Speaker 0: I think those both might actually be owned by the same people.

880
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:08,958
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

881
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:09,746
Speaker 1: They probably are.

882
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:10,620
Speaker 1: It's all the same freezing.

883
00:46:10,781 --> 00:46:12,378
Speaker 0: It's that same onion thingy.

884
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:12,981
Speaker 1: Whatever.

885
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:16,160
Speaker 1: Someone I knew who was restaurant, you know, a pendulum, like some people are circus.

886
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:24,500
Speaker 1: Someone I knew who was restaurant said that all those restaurants, all their desserts and most of their entrees are literally from the same factory and they're just frozen, delivered.

887
00:46:25,163 --> 00:46:26,140
Speaker 0: And yeah, most of the food.

888
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,820
Speaker 1: And the quote unquote chefs just warm them and then serve them.

889
00:46:29,102 --> 00:46:30,199
Speaker 0: There was a term for that.

890
00:46:31,426 --> 00:46:32,579
Speaker 1: No, most people don't know that.

891
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:33,540
Speaker 0: It's not a secret.

892
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,038
Speaker 1: Most people don't know that.

893
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:38,099
Speaker 0: OK, well, my dad works in food service, so I know a lot of these things.

894
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,560
Speaker 1: Yes, most people don't know that.

895
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:51,080
Speaker 1: I had a conversation with someone a month ago or so where they were shocked that chocolate cake and for dessert at the vast majority of restaurants is the same frozen chocolate cake is not baked at that restaurant.

896
00:46:51,381 --> 00:46:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, because there's people at Applebee's who know how to make chocolate cake.

897
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,059
Speaker 0: People in Applebee's are no cheesecake and and and they bake them every day.

898
00:46:59,261 --> 00:47:00,715
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they always have them ready, right?

899
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:01,762
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

900
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,420
Speaker 0: Even Capitol Grill, someplace that's fancy in a chain.

901
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,440
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised what goes on in the back.

902
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,819
Speaker 1: I would not be surprised at all.

903
00:47:08,205 --> 00:47:08,580
Speaker 0: No, you should.

904
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,740
Speaker 1: You can start to tell which restaurants have or don't usually comes down to one of those.

905
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:19,820
Speaker 1: You can tell a rich person's dessert because it involves some weird ritualistic preparation at the table.

906
00:47:20,361 --> 00:47:25,160
Speaker 0: I mean, if you really think about it, you go to let's say I go to a fancy Italian restaurant, I get a fancy pasta dish, right?

907
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:26,243
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

908
00:47:27,027 --> 00:47:29,700
Speaker 0: And it costs, what, 15 bucks, maybe average place, right?

909
00:47:30,141 --> 00:47:39,420
Speaker 0: If I just go to a everything lunch place and have them make me a custom pasta, which takes about three minutes, that's basically the same exact thing the fancy restaurant did for fifteen dollars.

910
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,099
Speaker 1: Well, because it's not actually the fancy restaurant.

911
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:41,923
Speaker 1: That's the.

912
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:44,780
Speaker 1: that's the normal restaurant for half as much money.

913
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,320
Speaker 0: And, you know, it's an amazing return.

914
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,899
Speaker 1: You spend, you know, five hundred bucks on the video card.

915
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:54,020
Speaker 1: The nine hundred dollar video card is not that much better.

916
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:54,778
Speaker 0: No, you don't need that.

917
00:47:55,021 --> 00:48:00,120
Speaker 1: If you go to the Italian restaurant where it's sixty dollars, that's some amazing pasta.

918
00:48:00,241 --> 00:48:03,020
Speaker 1: But is it fifty dollars more?

919
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,660
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is that a reasonable person buys a three hundred dollar video card and that's enough to last a long time.

920
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:15,140
Speaker 0: But if you haven't had five hundred dollar video card when you have it, you know what?

921
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,520
Speaker 0: It's real hard to go back to three hundred dollars video card.

922
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,060
Speaker 1: New PC gaming is your thing as opposed to just a dablence.

923
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:25,680
Speaker 1: Then, yeah, you should have the second best video card.

924
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,819
Speaker 0: Also, it's real nice.

925
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:34,320
Speaker 0: Once I got Premiere to actually use the GPU, everything renders in real fucking time all the time.

926
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,979
Speaker 0: Like just previews, just play like it's a video I downloaded and I'm playing it in VLC.

927
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,460
Speaker 1: Now, what's interesting is mine.

928
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,319
Speaker 1: Just do that, too.

929
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:49,500
Speaker 1: The only time that is not the case is if I have multiple scaled 1080p streams simultaneously and I'm trying to do that multi camera mode.

930
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:50,436
Speaker 1: Then no, I can't.

931
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:52,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, let's move on to other.

932
00:48:53,461 --> 00:48:57,390
Speaker 1: So logical items that we use every day that none of you care about is?

933
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,720
Speaker 1: I got a whole bunch of analog audio equipment such as.

934
00:49:02,121 --> 00:49:06,900
Speaker 1: So I got my beta 87, a fancy hypercardioid microphone.

935
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,656
Speaker 0: Tell us about it.

936
00:49:08,503 --> 00:49:10,898
Speaker 1: It's a condenser microphone that's hypercardioid.

937
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:15,600
Speaker 1: OK, meaning it's hyper directional like just now.

938
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,760
Speaker 1: I'm now at the side of the microphone slightly.

939
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,967
Speaker 1: Scott can verify I'm.

940
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:21,040
Speaker 1: I'm not far away from the microphone.

941
00:49:21,383 --> 00:49:23,260
Speaker 1: And now I'm back in front of the microphone like normal.

942
00:49:24,042 --> 00:49:26,220
Speaker 1: And it's like night and day, the pickup patterns.

943
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,120
Speaker 1: Scott has a less expensive microphone because he refused to buy the fancy one when I upped the microphones.

944
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:33,439
Speaker 0: What do I need it for?

945
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,640
Speaker 0: Is anyone having a problem with how I sound on this podcast?

946
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,738
Speaker 1: It just makes it easier for me.

947
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:37,980
Speaker 0: That's not my problem.

948
00:49:39,001 --> 00:49:40,680
Speaker 0: Why should I pay money to make things easy for you?

949
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,199
Speaker 0: You don't do anything to make things easier for me.

950
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,080
Speaker 1: Except all the audio and video editing for Geek Nights.

951
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,657
Speaker 0: Except making annoying noises when no one wants you to stop.

952
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:49,587
Speaker 0: Exactly.

953
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:56,820
Speaker 0: So when you stop making annoying noises, I will stop doing everything I can to make your life miserable as well.

954
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,910
Speaker 1: But that I we upgraded those years ago.

955
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,578
Speaker 0: It's not like microphones.

956
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,179
Speaker 0: Microphones last a lot longer than video cards.

957
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,140
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, we used to use the SM57, which are really good microphones, but they're ancient technology.

958
00:50:13,623 --> 00:50:13,785
Speaker 0: Yep.

959
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:15,159
Speaker 0: But they're really good.

960
00:50:15,742 --> 00:50:18,299
Speaker 1: We got these just because we wanted to step up.

961
00:50:18,701 --> 00:50:22,080
Speaker 1: We'll never really need to upgrade beyond these ever unless I break them.

962
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,200
Speaker 0: Well, unless someone has like a huge, sudden advance in microphone technology, which I highly doubt.

963
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,419
Speaker 1: Well, what I want.

964
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:30,839
Speaker 1: Talk about technology I want.

965
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,200
Speaker 0: They could miniaturize them somehow.

966
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,160
Speaker 1: I want to get the exact same lavaliers that the TED Talk people use because they're so expensive.

967
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're about three hundred bucks.

968
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:41,780
Speaker 0: a major advance would be like making those really cheap.

969
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:43,060
Speaker 1: They're about three hundred bucks each.

970
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,840
Speaker 1: Not counting the transmission stuff you need for the wireless, the receivers.

971
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:54,540
Speaker 1: And yeah, OK, but all our audio equipment is actually from the some of the earliest days of Geek Nights.

972
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,599
Speaker 1: We have not upgraded this shit at all.

973
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:59,080
Speaker 0: Why don't you tell us about that little box there?

974
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,319
Speaker 0: It says fire on it.

975
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,976
Speaker 1: Oh, so the fire studio I got when I found this one like 2009, I bought it some years ago.

976
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:09,236
Speaker 1: But basically for the for the longest time, the way Geek Nights worked is.

977
00:51:09,276 --> 00:51:10,200
Speaker 1: we had a mixer.

978
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,120
Speaker 1: I'll post a picture of our first mixer.

979
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,768
Speaker 1: It's kind of cute.

980
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:13,720
Speaker 0: Didn't we give it to Nuri?

981
00:51:14,082 --> 00:51:16,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we gave it to Nuri because she was doing our Artist Alley podcast.

982
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,817
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

983
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,787
Speaker 1: So that mixer, we would plug into this little.

984
00:51:21,988 --> 00:51:34,166
Speaker 1: well, actually, originally I plugged it into an internal sound card, which was actually my graphics blaster, graphics blaster, my sound blaster, the last sound blaster, the sound blaster live.

985
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:37,140
Speaker 1: that I spent some ridiculous amount of money for at RIT.

986
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,438
Speaker 1: Let me tell you what.

987
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:43,140
Speaker 1: The era of the internal sound card ended around the year 2000.

988
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,359
Speaker 1: Fuck internal sound cards, garbage ass pieces of shit.

989
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:48,180
Speaker 0: I use my worthless.

990
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,360
Speaker 0: I use mine just so I get the front headphone jacks on the computer playing audio.

991
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:53,064
Speaker 1: They're fine.

992
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:55,940
Speaker 1: You're not if you notice the static and the noise.

993
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,040
Speaker 0: Well, I had static and noise in the previous computer, but the new computer now you still do.

994
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,000
Speaker 1: You just don't notice it because it doesn't really matter.

995
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:02,364
Speaker 0: It's really.

996
00:52:02,404 --> 00:52:03,540
Speaker 0: it's much less than it was.

997
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,179
Speaker 0: The other one used to be like, but it is in there.

998
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:12,420
Speaker 1: So early on, we switched to a little cheapo external USB sound card.

999
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,960
Speaker 1: And it was like night and day in terms of sound quality, but wasn't great.

1000
00:52:16,462 --> 00:52:18,360
Speaker 1: We could really only record two channels.

1001
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:22,040
Speaker 1: And even then, that was by doing something so awesome and ghetto.

1002
00:52:22,742 --> 00:52:24,200
Speaker 1: Scott was on the left channel.

1003
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:25,939
Speaker 1: I was on the right channel.

1004
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:27,739
Speaker 1: I recorded in stereo.

1005
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1006
00:52:28,661 --> 00:52:33,920
Speaker 0: I mean, if I really needed to, I would get one of those gaming headsets that comes with the USB sound card as part of it.

1007
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,579
Speaker 1: I have that as well.

1008
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:38,617
Speaker 1: In fact, in my computer right now are one, two.

1009
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,879
Speaker 1: I have five active sound cards.

1010
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:41,421
Speaker 0: Great.

1011
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:43,108
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1012
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:45,780
Speaker 1: No, four, because right now the gaming headsets unplugged for some reason.

1013
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:47,680
Speaker 0: So other things.

1014
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,040
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

1015
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:56,380
Speaker 1: So I bought the Fire Studio Mobile, which was the cheapest good firewire audio thing, because USB basically sucks for audio.

1016
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:57,527
Speaker 1: It just doesn't have.

1017
00:52:58,452 --> 00:52:59,719
Speaker 1: there's not good support for it.

1018
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:01,800
Speaker 0: I need professional audio.

1019
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:02,102
Speaker 0: Right.

1020
00:53:02,162 --> 00:53:04,760
Speaker 0: If you're if you're just doing your gaming, USB is just fine.

1021
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:08,440
Speaker 1: But I have a fire studio which has eight channels on it.

1022
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:13,040
Speaker 1: It has two preamplified microphone inputs with phantom power in the front.

1023
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,080
Speaker 1: We could just plug our microphones directly into this thing and just record straight up in super high quality.

1024
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:19,642
Speaker 0: And so the way.

1025
00:53:19,682 --> 00:53:23,260
Speaker 0: the reason this thing is so great is you connect it to your computer with a firewire cable.

1026
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,139
Speaker 0: And then in Adobe Audition.

1027
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:26,783
Speaker 0: Right.

1028
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:31,900
Speaker 0: And everyone talking shows up separately on their own tracks.

1029
00:53:32,261 --> 00:53:40,180
Speaker 0: So if like one person's too loud, you can easily just make that track quieter instead of having to somehow split the people apart or do anything like that.

1030
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,843
Speaker 0: It's like now.

1031
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:43,620
Speaker 1: the thing has tons of inputs, tons of outputs.

1032
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,920
Speaker 1: I didn't actually realize because I didn't need it at the time.

1033
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,360
Speaker 1: But it has this crazy MIDI functionality that I might start using if I start trying to make music again.

1034
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:50,801
Speaker 1: Great.

1035
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:56,140
Speaker 1: But it is super useful, but I don't actually use the microphone inputs on the front of it.

1036
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,240
Speaker 1: I've never plugged shit into those things because I have a gigantic analog mixer.

1037
00:54:02,183 --> 00:54:04,200
Speaker 1: And a gigantic analog compressor.

1038
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,821
Speaker 1: And you know what?

1039
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:21,100
Speaker 1: To this day, having an analog compressor and a good preamplifier inline analog before you digitize is way better than recording in a high bit rate and a high sort of ceiling digital all the way and then doing it all in post.

1040
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:34,880
Speaker 1: Audio compression still really needs to be done for this kind of audio at the analog level, partly just because we don't have the technology to have a microphone that has such a wide dynamic range.

1041
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:44,220
Speaker 1: My voice doing what I'm doing right now will completely surpass the dynamic range of the microphone in the course of an episode of Geek Nights.

1042
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:46,403
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1043
00:54:46,544 --> 00:54:46,806
Speaker 0: All right.

1044
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:48,680
Speaker 0: So let's try to think of other things.

1045
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:49,767
Speaker 1: The mixer's gigantic.

1046
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:50,875
Speaker 1: It's some XENIX piece of shit.

1047
00:54:50,895 --> 00:54:51,157
Speaker 1: You know what?

1048
00:54:51,177 --> 00:54:51,660
Speaker 1: It works fine.

1049
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1050
00:54:52,182 --> 00:54:53,151
Speaker 0: It means a mixer, right?

1051
00:54:53,171 --> 00:54:54,220
Speaker 0: It either works or doesn't work.

1052
00:54:54,521 --> 00:54:59,300
Speaker 1: No, actually, the argument of it works or it doesn't work primarily applies to digital stuff.

1053
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:04,459
Speaker 1: With analog audio equipment, there is a wide degree of works or doesn't work.

1054
00:55:05,501 --> 00:55:05,782
Speaker 1: There is.

1055
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:10,040
Speaker 1: it is literally the better connectors sound better because there's less noise.

1056
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:11,060
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1057
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:18,660
Speaker 0: I mean, once you get to the level of, you know, not ten dollars, though, usually there's not enough noise to matter for all but the most professional of applications.

1058
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:22,840
Speaker 0: There's significant recording studio or gigantic arena concert.

1059
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,800
Speaker 1: There is significant noise in the mixer we use, actually.

1060
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,519
Speaker 1: You know how I got around that?

1061
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:33,860
Speaker 1: That's part of the reason why I bought the nicer microphones, because they have much higher gain on their own.

1062
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:36,160
Speaker 1: So I don't need to put the preamp up as high.

1063
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,980
Speaker 0: The preamps, the quality of the preamps in the mixer.

1064
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,100
Speaker 1: But a standalone preamp that's good is like five hundred bucks.

1065
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:43,641
Speaker 0: Well, you could.

1066
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:43,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1067
00:55:43,782 --> 00:55:48,080
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, that's the thing is you can get a preamp and plug it into the non amplified channels on the mixer.

1068
00:55:48,421 --> 00:55:55,880
Speaker 1: But if I was doing that, I would at that point, I would go preamp direct into the fire studio, the studio has its own preamps, but they actually kind of suck.

1069
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,320
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, very rarely is that do any anyone put the highest, awesomest preamps into something.

1070
00:56:02,483 --> 00:56:03,519
Speaker 0: They're usually on their own.

1071
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:09,120
Speaker 1: Anyway, if you want to hear me talk about the audio equipment, I think I did a show on this in like 2007.

1072
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,899
Speaker 1: That hasn't changed much.

1073
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:10,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1074
00:56:10,605 --> 00:56:12,460
Speaker 0: Let's talk about camera equipment.

1075
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:13,181
Speaker 0: All right.

1076
00:56:13,462 --> 00:56:23,040
Speaker 0: So I have a Panasonic GF two camera, which is a micro four thirds camera, which means it's sort of like a DSLR, but it's not what it has.

1077
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,520
Speaker 0: It's a mirrorless DSLR.

1078
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:27,960
Speaker 0: You know, the way DSLR works is there's a mirror, a physical mirror.

1079
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,980
Speaker 0: And you look in the camera and there's light that goes in the lens of the camera on the front hits the mirror.

1080
00:56:34,222 --> 00:56:35,578
Speaker 0: The mirror bounces the light up.

1081
00:56:35,901 --> 00:56:39,160
Speaker 0: There's another mirror that bounces it forward again and sort of like an S shape.

1082
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,120
Speaker 0: And that's how you can look into the viewfinder and see out the front of the camera.

1083
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:49,060
Speaker 0: And when you push the button to take a picture, the mirror moves physically up right out of the way.

1084
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:56,860
Speaker 0: So if the light coming in the lens hits the sensor, which then records the picture in the olden days, instead of a digital sensor being there, there'd be film.

1085
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,281
Speaker 0: Right.

1086
00:56:57,642 --> 00:57:02,520
Speaker 0: So a mirrorless camera, you open it up and you take the lens off and you just see the sensor just fucking right there.

1087
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:04,339
Speaker 0: It's like, there it is, no mirror in the way.

1088
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,940
Speaker 0: And you go, oh, shit, don't let any dust get on that motherfucker.

1089
00:57:07,021 --> 00:57:08,299
Speaker 0: And you know, you close it back up.

1090
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,439
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you take a CPU out of your motherboard, you're like, I got to put it back.

1091
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:13,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1092
00:57:13,101 --> 00:57:19,360
Speaker 0: So what this means is that the camera, because there's no mirror in there, can be much, much smaller than a DSLR.

1093
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:23,320
Speaker 0: But the quality is almost as good, obviously not as good.

1094
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,460
Speaker 0: Obviously, you can't look into the viewfinder and see out the front of the camera.

1095
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:32,780
Speaker 0: What you see is just a screen on the back like any other digital camera and showing you what the sensor is seeing.

1096
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,061
Speaker 0: Right.

1097
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:38,480
Speaker 0: You can get a digital viewfinder to get that experience of holding the camera up to your face.

1098
00:57:39,082 --> 00:57:41,640
Speaker 0: But inside of that is just a very tiny monitor.

1099
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:44,659
Speaker 1: Well, the holding the camera up to your face stabilizes.

1100
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,320
Speaker 1: Well, no, in video especially is actually really important, which is why I spent a lot more money to get the camera I got.

1101
00:57:52,101 --> 00:58:00,240
Speaker 1: Now, it's an old camera now, but when I bought it, the Panasonic HDC HS 700, which Panasonic has gobbledygook bullshit when it comes.

1102
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,059
Speaker 1: There's like a hundred different models of this thing.

1103
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:03,723
Speaker 1: It's basically a handicam.

1104
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:09,200
Speaker 1: It's kind of the upper end of prosumer, because anything beyond this is going to be a sort of for real studio camera.

1105
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:11,548
Speaker 1: It's 1080p, 60fps.

1106
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,320
Speaker 1: It actually is pretty good quality, all things considered.

1107
00:58:15,282 --> 00:58:17,639
Speaker 1: Pretty much all the ignites video you see is shot with this thing.

1108
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:19,869
Speaker 1: And it was actually really cheap.

1109
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:21,579
Speaker 1: I spent like 1200 bucks on it.

1110
00:58:23,902 --> 00:58:30,900
Speaker 1: But it has, and part of the reason why it was expensive, is I can have the slide out screen or I can pull out an eyepiece.

1111
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:34,899
Speaker 1: And inside of there is just a tiny LCD, just a little baby LCD.

1112
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:35,621
Speaker 1: But you know what?

1113
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:41,380
Speaker 1: When you're videoing in a dark room, that shit be useful in a big way.

1114
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:54,980
Speaker 1: Also, if you're videoing in a super sunny situation, if you're videoing where you really need precision and you can't be distracted by just stuff going on around you, that viewfinder is so important to being a good cameraman.

1115
00:58:56,821 --> 00:59:08,580
Speaker 0: But yeah, the Micro Four Thirds camera, the other thing about it, besides being mirrorless, is that the lens mount is this Micro Four Thirds standard, which is somewhat more open.

1116
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:16,900
Speaker 0: I mean, if you can buy a Sony mirrorless camera, the next five and the next seven, the next seven is actually one of the best mirrorless cameras there is, if not the best, even though I hate Sony.

1117
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,400
Speaker 0: But the only lenses you can get for that fucker are these handful of Sony lenses, and that's it, because it's got some weird mount.

1118
00:59:23,842 --> 00:59:26,700
Speaker 0: The Micro Four Thirds mount is sort of open-ish.

1119
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,480
Speaker 0: So there's all kinds of crazy things you can buy and there's even all kinds of crazy adapters you can buy.

1120
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:43,060
Speaker 0: So I can go and get like some old ass lens from an old school four thirds camera, get this little adapter and stick it on there, and it'll totally work as long as the camera's in manual mode.

1121
00:59:43,561 --> 00:59:53,420
Speaker 0: So if you want to try out all sorts of weird attachments and things, you know, and you don't want to get the real DSLR action, the Micro Four Thirds is definitely the one.

1122
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,967
Speaker 1: Well, see, the reason I said there was a future, because one of my coworkers was like, "Hey, I want to get a camera for my son who thinks he wants to get into photography,".

1123
00:59:58,987 --> 01:00:09,120
Speaker 1: and I've recommended some of the kind of the mid-range Micro Four Thirds Lumixes just because they're a good price point for him, because they're, you know, it's a kid who might not follow on forever.

1124
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:14,320
Speaker 1: You don't want to buy the most expensive camera, but you don't want to buy them point and shoot because then he'll just use the cell camera instead.

1125
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:27,571
Speaker 1: So I found multiple articles of professional photographers in their blogs that were basically saying they have, you know, like $4,000 like crazy DSLRs, but even but more and more.

1126
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:38,260
Speaker 1: in their professional shoots, they're using their Micro Four Thirds cameras, the mirrorless ones, because the ease of use compared to the loss of quality, it's just it's a done deal.

1127
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:52,220
Speaker 1: They get better pictures with the Micro Four Thirds because they carry it with them everywhere, they use it more often, they can set up their studio shots faster, and they just made all these arguments how that's basically the future, and that big form factor is going to slowly disappear.

1128
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,139
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, not for like, you know, some things, but yeah.

1129
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:01,596
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean, for some things, like, yes, that like I have in the palm of my hand, a pretty tiny 1080p 60fps camera.

1130
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,236
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I have a GoPro, that's a pretty tiny 4K, right, whatever camera.

1131
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:11,660
Speaker 1: So did you get your new GoPro?

1132
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,507
Speaker 0: No, I'm not going to.

1133
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:13,800
Speaker 0: You don't have it in your hand.

1134
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,335
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you don't have 4K.

1135
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:16,820
Speaker 0: I'm saying it exists.

1136
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,380
Speaker 1: In fact, the GoPro only does 1080p 30.

1137
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,699
Speaker 0: The GoPro Hero 2, which we have.

1138
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:22,348
Speaker 1: Yes.

1139
01:01:22,552 --> 01:01:22,756
Speaker 0: Yes.

1140
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:26,380
Speaker 1: But actually the video on that is not that great because of heavy compression.

1141
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,100
Speaker 0: I use the 720 60.

1142
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:33,100
Speaker 1: This thing, the camera on my hand gets a much more close to native format is much better quality.

1143
01:01:33,661 --> 01:01:40,100
Speaker 1: But this thing is tiny and does crazy, crazy, crazy high quality video compared to what most people have.

1144
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:53,020
Speaker 1: And even if we get to a future where a red style camera is like this, there's still going to be the situation where you need the crazy, gigantic, durable camera, you know, mounted on the helicopter with gyroscopes to do some crazy video.

1145
01:01:53,221 --> 01:01:53,484
Speaker 0: Right.

1146
01:01:53,706 --> 01:01:55,159
Speaker 1: Until we replace all video with CG.

1147
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,400
Speaker 0: But the thing is, like even, you know, the four thirds, it's in, you know, the Lumix, whatever, mirrorless.

1148
01:02:00,561 --> 01:02:05,880
Speaker 0: It's you look at those pictures and you're like, wow, those are really good pictures, way better than cell phones or point and shoots or anything.

1149
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:12,280
Speaker 0: But then I look at some crazy good photography, you look at a DSLR and you're like, well, yeah, not totally the best.

1150
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,000
Speaker 0: So there's still a gap there that I would still if I had a DSLR, it would still be way awesome.

1151
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:18,752
Speaker 0: It's still better.

1152
01:02:18,996 --> 01:02:19,119
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1153
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:27,320
Speaker 0: But at the same time, there's the argument you made that the no, if you just showed that the if you put the two pictures next to each other, people would be able to tell.

1154
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,820
Speaker 0: But if you just showed them, you know, the one picture on its own, people like, wow, awesome pictures.

1155
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,260
Speaker 1: Scott, I see pictures people took with their iPhones and little bullshit lenses.

1156
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,940
Speaker 1: They stuck to them that look better than some professional photographs.

1157
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:38,682
Speaker 0: That's true.

1158
01:02:38,762 --> 01:02:43,760
Speaker 0: People somehow people are able to photography can cover a lot of technology.

1159
01:02:44,163 --> 01:02:45,214
Speaker 0: It covers way too much.

1160
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:46,141
Speaker 0: Right.

1161
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:52,260
Speaker 0: It's like people who know what they're doing is they can take these fucking amazing pictures like the shittiest 640 by 480 digital cameras.

1162
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,838
Speaker 0: And it's like, how the fuck did you do that?

1163
01:02:54,981 --> 01:02:57,240
Speaker 0: Anything I take with that looks just like a blurry piece of shit.

1164
01:02:57,420 --> 01:02:57,867
Speaker 0: You can't even tell.

1165
01:02:57,888 --> 01:02:58,619
Speaker 0: You know what?

1166
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,060
Speaker 1: I don't use anymore printers.

1167
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:01,590
Speaker 0: I have one.

1168
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:02,400
Speaker 1: I have one.

1169
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:06,820
Speaker 1: Every time I print with it, I got to stand there and shove the paper through because it can't roll properly.

1170
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:07,900
Speaker 0: Mine works just fine.

1171
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:08,998
Speaker 0: I have a brother something.

1172
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,339
Speaker 0: It actually does double sided, the kind where it sucks the paper.

1173
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:14,259
Speaker 1: I know you do because I have the old Samsung, which you know what?

1174
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,617
Speaker 1: Same ink cartridge.

1175
01:03:16,923 --> 01:03:17,959
Speaker 1: Well, toner cartridge.

1176
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:18,463
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1177
01:03:18,806 --> 01:03:20,420
Speaker 0: Black and white laser printers, everybody.

1178
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:21,265
Speaker 0: Right.

1179
01:03:21,326 --> 01:03:22,639
Speaker 1: How do you use your printer for?

1180
01:03:23,223 --> 01:03:26,620
Speaker 1: Print out a ticket for Megabus because they refuse to look at your cell phone.

1181
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,021
Speaker 1: Right.

1182
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:30,160
Speaker 0: How often do you actually need to print something in color?

1183
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:33,080
Speaker 0: You can just go to FedEx, Kinko's, whatever the fuck print shop.

1184
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:33,422
Speaker 0: Right.

1185
01:03:33,845 --> 01:03:36,080
Speaker 0: You rarely, rarely, rarely need to print in color.

1186
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:41,240
Speaker 0: Ninety nine percent of the time you still need to print if you need to print at all ever is going to be black and white.

1187
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:46,320
Speaker 0: Black and white laser gives you the cheapest price per page, the fastest.

1188
01:03:47,142 --> 01:03:49,700
Speaker 0: It's just the best in, you know, for actual.

1189
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:55,740
Speaker 0: So if you need a printer at all, which you should avoid getting, if at all possible, black and white laser printer of some kind.

1190
01:03:56,161 --> 01:04:01,400
Speaker 1: I got the highest grade because the inkjet, if it sits there for a month and then you print, you're going to waste a bunch of ink and there's all this trouble.

1191
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,800
Speaker 1: Inkjets are dead for that kind of thing.

1192
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,103
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1193
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,440
Speaker 0: I think inkjets are dead, period.

1194
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:13,000
Speaker 0: I think the only people who really would still get inkjets and things are like if you have kids who are printing out colored things like school projects all the time or some shit.

1195
01:04:13,341 --> 01:04:13,986
Speaker 0: Are you kidding?

1196
01:04:14,047 --> 01:04:15,318
Speaker 0: You know how expensive that would be?

1197
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:17,085
Speaker 0: Because schools are old.

1198
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:19,440
Speaker 0: That's the only time in my life I printed a lot of colored things.

1199
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,319
Speaker 0: It was like for high school projects and whatnot.

1200
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:24,120
Speaker 1: At RIT, I would print out art to stick on my wall.

1201
01:04:24,682 --> 01:04:25,207
Speaker 0: I would do that.

1202
01:04:25,227 --> 01:04:25,307
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1203
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:26,840
Speaker 0: That's what I was doing at RIT.

1204
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,140
Speaker 1: I printed it on photo paper so it looked all glossy.

1205
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,340
Speaker 0: Print out a picture of Choo Choo with a white castle.

1206
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:32,520
Speaker 1: Yup, yup.

1207
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,100
Speaker 0: Various webcomics.

1208
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,120
Speaker 1: I remember that picture.

1209
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:37,520
Speaker 1: I had this crazy CG picture.

1210
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,700
Speaker 1: It's like a girl looking up into the like into the moonlight with cherry blossoms.

1211
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,340
Speaker 1: It's beautiful.

1212
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:46,671
Speaker 1: One day this nerd came into my dorm room because he was doing.

1213
01:04:46,711 --> 01:04:49,560
Speaker 1: he knew I was in the anime club and that I was running for the board or whatever.

1214
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:55,800
Speaker 1: And he was doing an article for a class and for the school newspaper on like like fans and anime in the school or whatever.

1215
01:04:56,222 --> 01:04:57,740
Speaker 1: And he sees this picture I got printed out.

1216
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:03,440
Speaker 1: He's like, oh, I didn't know you were a fan of and I think he said palette, palette something.

1217
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,919
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, I didn't actually know this picture is from.

1218
01:05:06,461 --> 01:05:09,040
Speaker 1: And then he's like, oh, and he didn't say anything.

1219
01:05:09,281 --> 01:05:10,979
Speaker 1: And I was like, is it porn?

1220
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:16,180
Speaker 1: And he was like, yeah, and I was like, are you a fan of it?

1221
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,718
Speaker 1: And you thought I was a fan of it, too.

1222
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,335
Speaker 1: And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:24,759
Speaker 0: OK, this is going on for a while.

1224
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:25,560
Speaker 1: Want to just stop?

1225
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,740
Speaker 0: But I have a feeling that people want to hear more about the technological things.

1226
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:30,198
Speaker 1: We'll do another Monday show on it.

1227
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:31,420
Speaker 0: We should just do Thursday.

1228
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,079
Speaker 1: You know what?

1229
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,440
Speaker 1: I could talk about my Marantz.

1230
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,679
Speaker 1: I got shit to say about that.

1231
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:36,738
Speaker 1: We should save that for another time, though.

1232
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:38,254
Speaker 1: Gone over an hour.

1233
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:39,338
Speaker 1: It's done.

1234
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:40,400
Speaker 1: I'm hungry.

1235
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,299
Speaker 1: I heard the doorbells of fresh direct came and I want to eat the zucchini bread that's in there.

1236
01:05:44,421 --> 01:05:44,879
Speaker 1: Something fierce.

1237
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:52,340
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
